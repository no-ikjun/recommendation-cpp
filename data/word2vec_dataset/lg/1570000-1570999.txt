 After the start of the war , Himmler intensified the activity of the SS within Germany and in Nazi occupied Europe . An increasing numbers of Jews and German citizens deemed politically suspect or social outsiders were arrested . As the Nazi regime became more oppressive , the concentration camp system grew in size and lethal operation , and grew in scope as the economic ambitions of the SS intensified . 
 Intensification of the killing operations took place in late 1941 when the SS began construction of stationary gassing facilities to replace the use of Einsatzgruppen for mass killings . Victims at these new extermination camps were killed with the use of carbon monoxide gas from automobile engines . During Operation Reinhard , run by officers from the Totenkopfverbände , who were sworn to secrecy , three death camps were built in occupied Poland : Bełżec ( operational by March 1942 ) , Sobibór ( operational by May 1942 ) , and Treblinka ( operational by July 1942 ) , with squads of Trawniki men ( Eastern European collaborators ) overseeing hundreds of Sonderkommando prisoners , who were forced to work in the gas chambers and crematoria before being murdered themselves . On Himmler 's orders , by early 1942 the concentration camp at Auschwitz was greatly expanded to include the addition of gas chambers , where victims were killed using the pesticide Zyklon B. 
 For administrative reasons , all concentration camp guards and administrative staff became full members of the Waffen @-@ SS in 1942 . The concentration camps were placed under the command of the SS @-@ Wirtschafts @-@ Verwaltungshauptamt ( SS Main Economic and Administrative Office ; WVHA ) under Oswald Pohl . Richard Glücks served as the Inspector of Concentration Camps , which in 1942 became office " D " under the WVHA . Exploitation and extermination became a balancing act as the military situation deteriorated . The labor needs of the war economy , especially for skilled workers , meant that some Jews escaped the genocide . On 30 October 1942 , due to severe labor shortages , Himmler ordered that large numbers of able @-@ bodied people in the Soviet occupied territories should be taken prisoner and sent to Germany as forced labor . 
 By 1944 , the SS @-@ TV had been organized into three divisions : staff of the concentration camps in Germany and Austria , in the occupied territories , and of the extermination camps in Poland . By 1944 , it became standard practice to rotate SS members in and out of the camps , partly based on manpower needs , but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen @-@ SS members . This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS knew what was going on inside the concentration camps , making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity . 
 = = Business empire = = 
 In 1934 , Himmler founded the first SS business venture , Nordland @-@ Verlag , a publishing house that released propaganda material and SS training manuals . Thereafter , he purchased <unk> Porcelain , which then began to produce SS memorabilia . Because of the labor shortage and a desire for financial gain , the SS started exploiting concentration camp inmates as slave labor . Most of the SS businesses lost money until Himmler placed them under the administration of Pohl 's Verwaltung und <unk> Hauptamt ( Administration and Business office ; <unk> ) in 1939 . Even then , most of the enterprises were poorly run and did not fare well , as SS men were not selected for their business experience , and the workers were starving . In July 1940 Pohl established the Deutsche <unk> GmbH ( German Businesses Ltd ; DWB ) , an umbrella corporation under which he took over administration of all SS business concerns . Eventually the SS founded nearly 200 holding companies for their businesses . 
 In May 1941 the <unk> founded the Deutsche <unk> GmbH ( German Equipment Works ; DAW ) , which was created to integrate the SS business enterprises with the burgeoning concentration camp system . Himmler subsequently established four major new concentration camps in 1941 : Auschwitz , Gross @-@ Rosen , Natzweiler @-@ <unk> , and Neuengamme . Each had at least one factory or quarry nearby where the inmates were forced to work . Himmler took a particular interest in providing laborers for IG Farben , which was constructing a synthetic rubber factory at Auschwitz III – Monowitz . The plant was almost ready to commence production when it was overrun by Soviet troops in 1945 . Life expectancy of inmates at Monowitz averaged about three months . This was typical of the camps , as inmates were underfed and lived under disastrously bad living conditions . Their workload was intentionally made impossibly high , under the policy of extermination through labor . 
 In 1942 , Himmler consolidated all of the offices for which Pohl was responsible into one , creating the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office ( <unk> und Verwaltungshauptamt ; WVHA ) . The entire concentration camp system was placed under the authority of the WVHA . The SS owned <unk> <unk> , a mineral water producer in Sudetenland . By 1944 , the SS had purchased 75 percent of the mineral water producers in Germany and were intending to acquire a monopoly . Several concentration camps produced building materials such as stone , bricks , and cement for the SS @-@ owned Deutsche <unk> und <unk> ( German Earth And Stone Works ; <unk> ) . In the occupied Eastern territories , the SS acquired a monopoly in brick production by seizing all 300 extant brickworks . The DWB also founded the Ost @-@ Deutsche <unk> ( East German Building Supply Works ; GmbH or <unk> ) and Deutsche <unk> GmbH ( German Noble Furniture ) . These operated in factories the SS had confiscated from Jews and Poles . 
 The SS owned experimental farms , bakeries , meat packing plants , leather works , clothing and uniform factories , and small arms factories . Under the direction of the WVHA , the SS sold camp labor to various factories at a rate of three to six Reichsmarks per prisoner per day . The SS confiscated and sold the property of concentration camp inmates , confiscated their investment portfolios and their cash , and profited from their dead bodies by selling their hair to make felt and melting down their dental work to obtain gold from the fillings . The total value of assets looted from the victims of Operation Reinhard alone ( not including Auschwitz ) was listed by Odilo Globocnik as 178 @,@ 745 @,@ 960 @.@ 59 Reichsmarks . Items seized included 2 @,@ 909 @.@ 68 kilograms of gold worth 843 @,@ 802 @.@ 75 RM , as well as 18 @,@ 733 @.@ 69 kg of silver , 1 @,@ 514 kg of platinum , 249 @,@ 771 @.@ 50 American dollars , 130 diamond solitaires , 2 @,@ 511 @.@ 87 carats of brilliants , 13 @,@ 458 @.@ 62 carats of diamonds , and 114 kg of pearls . According to Nazi legislation , Jewish property belonged to the state , but many SS camp commandants and guards stole items such as diamonds or currency for personal gain , or took seized foodstuffs and liquor to sell on the black market .

 On 5 July 1943 , the Germans launched the Battle of Kursk , an offensive designed to eliminate the Kursk salient . The Waffen @-@ SS by this time had been expanded to 12 divisions , and most took part in the battle . Due to stiff Soviet resistance , Hitler halted the attack by the evening of 12 July . On 17 July he called off the operation and ordered a withdrawal . Thereafter , the Germans were forced onto the defensive as the Red Army began the liberation of Western Russia . The losses incurred by the Waffen @-@ SS and the Wehrmacht during the Battle of Kursk occurred nearly simultaneously with the Allied assault into Italy , opening a two @-@ front war for Germany . 
 = = = Normandy landings = = = 
 Alarmed by the raids on St Nazaire and Dieppe in 1942 , Hitler had ordered the construction of fortifications he called the Atlantic Wall all along the Atlantic coast , from Spain to Norway , to protect against an expected Allied invasion . Concrete gun emplacements were constructed at strategic points along the coast , and wooden stakes , metal tripods , mines , and large anti @-@ tank obstacles were placed on the beaches to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks . In addition to several static infantry divisions , eleven panzer and Panzergrenadier divisions were deployed nearby . Four of these formations were Waffen @-@ SS divisions . In addition , the SS @-@ Das Reich was located in Southern France , the LSSAH was in Belgium refitting after fighting in the Soviet Union , and the newly formed panzer division SS @-@ Hitlerjugend , consisting of 17- and 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hitler Youth members supported by combat veterans and experienced NCOs , was stationed west of Paris . The creation of the SS @-@ Hitlerjugend was a sign of Hitler 's desperation for more troops , especially ones with unquestioning obedience . 
 The Normandy landings took place beginning 6 June 1944 . 21st Panzer Division under Generalmajor Edgar Feuchtinger , positioned south of Caen , was the only panzer division close to the beaches . The division included 146 tanks and 50 assault guns , plus supporting infantry and artillery . At 02 : 00 , Generalleutnant Wilhelm Richter , commander of the 716th Static Infantry Division , ordered 21st Panzer Division into position to counter @-@ attack . However , as the division was part of the armoured reserve , Feuchtinger was obliged to seek clearance from OKW before he could commit his formation . Feuchtinger did not receive orders until nearly 09 : 00 , but in the meantime on his own initiative he put together a battle group ( including tanks ) to fight the British forces east of the Orne . SS @-@ Hitlerjugend began to deploy in the afternoon of 6 June , with its units undertaking defensive actions the following day . They also took part in the Battle for Caen ( June – August 1944 ) . On 7 – 8 and 17 June , members of the SS @-@ Hitlerjugend shot and killed twenty Canadian prisoners of war in the Ardenne Abbey massacre . 
 The Allies continued to make progress in the liberation of France , and on 4 August Hitler ordered a counter @-@ offensive ( Operation Lüttich ) from Vire towards Avranches . The operation included LSSAH , Das Reich , 2nd , and 116th Panzer Divisions , with support from infantry and elements of the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division Götz von Berlichingen under SS @-@ <unk> Paul Hausser . These forces were to mount an offensive near Mortain and drive west through Avranches to the coast . The Allied forces were prepared for this offensive , and an air assault on the combined German units proved devastating . On 21 August , 50 @,@ 000 German troops , including most of the LSSAH , were encircled by the Allies in the Falaise Pocket . Remnants of the LSSAH which escaped were withdrawn to Germany for refitting . Paris was liberated on 25 August , and the last of the German forces withdrew over the Seine by the end of August , ending the Normandy campaign . 
 = = = Battle for Germany = = = 
 Waffen @-@ SS units which had survived the summer campaigns were withdrawn from the front line to refit . Two of them , the 9th SS and 10th SS Panzer Divisions , did so in the Arnhem region of Holland in early September 1944 . Coincidentally , on 17 September , the Allies launched in the same area Operation Market Garden , a combined airborne and land operation designed to seize control of the lower Rhine . The 9th and 10th Panzers were among the units that repulsed the attack . 
 In December 1944 , Hitler launched the Ardennes Offensive , also known as the Battle of the Bulge , a significant counterattack against the western Allies through the Ardennes with the aim of reaching Antwerp while encircling the Allied armies in the area . The offensive began with an artillery barrage shortly before dawn on 16 December . Spearheading the attack were two panzer armies composed largely of Waffen @-@ SS divisions . The battle groups found advancing through the forests and wooded hills of the Ardennes difficult in the winter weather , but they initially made good progress in the northern sector . They soon encountered strong resistance from the US 2nd and 99th Infantry Divisions . By 23 December , the weather improved enough that the Allied air forces could attack the German forces and their supply columns , causing fuel shortages . In increasingly difficult conditions , the German advance slowed and was stopped . Hitler 's failed offensive cost 700 tanks and most of their remaining mobile forces in the west , as well as most of their irreplaceable reserves of manpower and materiel . 
 During the battle , SS @-@ Obersturmbannführer Joachim Peiper left a path of destruction , which included Waffen @-@ SS soldiers under his command murdering American POWs and unarmed Belgian civilians in the Malmedy massacre . Captured SS soldiers who were part of Kampfgruppe Peiper were tried during the Malmedy massacre trial following the war for this massacre and several others in the area . Many of the perpetrators were sentenced to hang , but the sentences were commuted . Peiper was imprisoned for eleven years for his role in the killings . 
 In the east , the Red Army resumed their offensive on 12 January 1945 . German forces were outnumbered twenty to one in aircraft , eleven to one in infantry , and seven to one in tanks on the Eastern Front . By the end of the month , the Red Army had made bridgeheads across the Oder , the last geographic obstacle before Berlin . The western Allies continued to advance as well , but not as rapidly as the Red Army . The Panzer Corps conducted a successful defensive operation on 17 – 24 February at the Hron River , stalling the Allied advance towards Vienna . The 1st and 2nd SS Panzer Corps made their way towards Austria , but were slowed by damaged railways . 
 Budapest fell on 13 February . Hitler ordered Dietrich 's 6th SS Panzer Army to move into Hungary to protect the Nagykanizsa oilfields and refineries , which he deemed the most strategically valuable fuel reserves on the Eastern Front . <unk> ( Operation Spring Awakening ) , the final German offensive in the east , took place in early March . German forces attacked near Lake Balaton , with 6th SS Panzer Army advancing north towards Budapest and 2nd Panzer Army moving east and south . Dietrich 's forces at first made good progress , but as they drew near the Danube , the combination of muddy terrain and strong Soviet resistance brought them to a halt . By 16 March the battle was lost . Enraged by the defeat , Hitler ordered the Waffen @-@ SS units involved to remove their cuff titles as a mark of disgrace . Dietrich refused to carry out the order . 
 By this time , on both the Eastern and Western Front , the activities of the SS were becoming clear to the Allies , as the concentration and extermination camps were being overrun . Allied troops were filled with disbelief and repugnance at the evidence of Nazi brutality in the camps . 
 On 9 April 1945 Königsberg fell to the Red Army , and on 13 April Dietrich 's SS unit was forced out of Vienna . The Battle of Berlin began at 03 : 30 on 16 April with a massive artillery barrage . Within the week , fighting was taking place inside the city . Among the many elements defending Berlin were French , Latvian , and Scandinavian Waffen @-@ SS troops . Hitler , now living in the Führerbunker under the Reich Chancellery , still hoped that his remaining SS soldiers could rescue the capital . In spite of the futility of the situation , members of the SS patrolling the city continued to shoot or hang soldiers and civilians for what they considered to be acts of cowardice or defeatism . The Berlin garrison surrendered on 2 May , two days after Hitler committed suicide . As members of SS expected little mercy from the Red Army , they attempted to move westward to surrender to the western Allies instead .

 = = = Reich Main Security Office = = = 
 Heydrich held the title of Chef des Sicherheitspolizei und SD ( Chief of the Security Police and SD ) until 27 September 1939 , when he became chief of the newly established Reich Main Security Office ( RSHA ) . From that point forward , the RSHA was in charge of SS security services . It had under its command the SD , Kripo , and Gestapo , as well as several offices to handle finance , administration , and supply . Heinrich Müller , who had been chief of operations for the Gestapo , was appointed Gestapo chief at this time . Arthur Nebe was chief of the Kripo , and the two branches of SD were commanded by a series of SS officers , including Otto Ohlendorf and Walter Schellenberg . The SD was considered an elite branch of the SS , and its members were better educated and typically more ambitious than those within the ranks of the Allgemeine SS . Members of the SD were specially trained in criminology , intelligence , and counter @-@ intelligence . They also gained a reputation for ruthlessness and unwavering commitment to Nazi ideology . 
 Heydrich was attacked in Prague on 27 May 1942 by a British @-@ trained team of Czech and Slovak soldiers who had been sent by the Czechoslovak government @-@ in @-@ exile to kill him in Operation Anthropoid . He died from his injuries a week later . Himmler ran the RSHA personally until 30 January 1943 , when Heydrich 's positions were taken over by Ernst Kaltenbrunner . 
 = = = SS @-@ Sonderkommandos = = = 
 Beginning in 1938 and throughout World War II , the SS enacted a procedure where offices and units of the SS could form smaller sub @-@ units , known as SS @-@ Sonderkommandos , to carry out special tasks , including large @-@ scale murder operations . The use of SS @-@ Sonderkommandos was widespread . According to former SS Sturmbannführer Wilhelm Höttl , not even the SS leadership knew how many SS @-@ Sonderkommandos were constantly being formed , disbanded , and reformed for various tasks , especially on the Eastern Front . 
 A SS @-@ Sonderkommando unit led by SS @-@ Sturmbannführer Herbert Lange murdered 1 @,@ 201 psychiatric patients at the <unk> psychiatric hospital in the Free City of Danzig , 1 @,@ 100 patients in <unk> , 2 @,@ 750 patients at Kościan , and 1 @,@ 558 patients at <unk> , as well as hundreds of Poles at Fort VII , where the mobile gas van and gassing bunker were developed . In 1941 – 42 , SS @-@ Sonderkommando Lange set up and managed the first extermination camp , at Chełmno , where 152 @,@ 000 Jews were killed using gas vans . 
 After the battle of Stalingrad in February 1943 , Himmler realised that Germany would likely lose the war , and ordered the formation of Sonderkommando 1005 , a special task force under SS @-@ Standartenführer Paul Blobel . The unit 's assignment was to visit mass graves on the Eastern Front to exhume bodies and burn them in an attempt to cover up the genocide . The task remained unfinished at the end of the war , and many mass graves remain unmarked and unexcavated . 
 The Eichmann Sonderkommando was a task force headed by Adolf Eichmann that arrived in Budapest on 19 March 1944 , the same day that Axis forces invaded Hungary . Their task was to take a direct role in the deportation of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz . The SS @-@ Sonderkommandos enlisted the aide of antisemitic elements from the Hungarian gendarmerie and pro @-@ German administrators from within the Hungarian Interior Ministry . Round @-@ ups began on 16 April , and from 14 May , four trains of 3 @,@ 000 Jews per day left Hungary and travelled to the camp at Auschwitz II @-@ Birkenau , arriving along a newly built spur line that terminated a few hundred metres from the gas chambers . Between 10 and 25 percent of the people on each train were chosen as forced laborers ; the rest were killed within hours of arrival . Under international pressure , the Hungarian government halted deportations on 6 July 1944 , by which time over 437 @,@ 000 of Hungary 's 725 @,@ 000 Jews had died . 
 = = = Einsatzgruppen = = = 
 The Einsatzgruppen had its origins in the ad hoc Einsatzkommando formed by Heydrich following the Anschluss in Austria in March 1938 . Two units of Einsatzgruppen were stationed in the Sudetenland in October 1938 . When military action turned out not to be necessary because of the Munich Agreement , the Einsatzgruppen were assigned to confiscate government papers and police documents . They secured government buildings , questioned senior civil servants , and arrested as many as 10 @,@ 000 Czech communists and German citizens . The Einsatzgruppen also followed Wehrmacht troops and killed potential partisans . Similar groups were used in 1939 for the occupation of Czechoslovakia . 
 Hitler felt that the planned extermination of the Jews was too difficult and important to be entrusted to the military . In 1941 the Einsatzgruppen were sent into the Soviet Union to begin large @-@ scale genocide of Jews , Romani people , and communists . Historian Raul Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the Einsatzgruppen and related agencies killed more than two million people , including 1 @.@ 3 million Jews . The largest mass shooting perpetrated by the Einsatzgruppen was at Babi Yar outside Kiev , where 33 @,@ 771 Jews were killed in a single operation on 29 – 30 September 1941 . In the Rumbula massacre ( November – December 1941 ) , 25 @,@ 000 victims from the Riga ghetto were killed . Another mass shooting early in 1942 claimed the lives of over 10 @,@ 000 Jews in Kharkov . 
 The last Einsatzgruppen were disbanded in mid @-@ 1944 ( although some continued to exist on paper until 1945 ) due to the German retreat on both fronts and the consequent inability to continue extermination activities . Former Einsatzgruppen members were either assigned duties in the Waffen @-@ SS or concentration camps . Twenty @-@ four Einsatzgruppen commanders were tried for war crimes following the war . 
 = = = SS Court Main Office = = = 
 The SS Court Main Office ( Hauptamt SS @-@ Gericht ) was an internal legal system for conducting investigations , trials , and punishment of the SS and police . It had more than 600 lawyers on staff in the main offices in Berlin and Munich . Proceedings were conducted at 38 regional SS courts throughout Germany . It was the only authority authorized to try SS personnel , except for SS members who were on active duty in the Wehrmacht ( in such cases , the SS member in question was tried by a standard military tribunal ) . Its creation placed the SS beyond the reach of civilian legal authority . Himmler personally intervened as he saw fit regarding convictions and punishment . The historian Karl Dietrich Bracher describes this court system as one factor in the creation of the Nazi totalitarian police state , as it removed objective legal procedures , rendering citizens defenseless against the " summary justice of the SS terror . " 
 = = = SS Cavalry = = = 
 Shortly after Hitler seized power in 1933 , most horse riding associations were taken over by the SA and SS . Members received combat training to serve in the Reiter @-@ SS ( SS Cavalry Corps ) . The first SS cavalry regiment , designated SS @-@ Totenkopf <unk> 1 , was formed in September 1939 . Commanded by then SS @-@ Standartenführer Hermann Fegelein , the unit was assigned to Poland , where they took part in the extermination of Polish intelligentsia . Additional squadrons were added in May 1940 , for a total of fourteen . 
 The unit was split into two regiments in December 1939 , with Fegelein in charge of both . By March 1941 their strength was 3 @,@ 500 men . In July 1941 , they were assigned to the Pripyat swamps punitive operation , tasked with rounding up and exterminating Jews and partisans . The two regiments were amalgamated into the SS Cavalry Brigade on 31 July , twelve days after the operation started . Fegelein 's final report , dated 18 September 1941 , states that they killed 14 @,@ 178 Jews , 1 @,@ 001 partisans , and 699 Red Army soldiers , with 830 prisoners taken . The historian Henning Pieper estimates the actual number of Jews killed was closer to 23 @,@ 700 . The SS Cavalry Brigade took serious losses in November 1941 in the Battle of Moscow , with casualties of up to 60 per cent in some squadrons . Fegelein was appointed as commander of the 8th SS Cavalry Division Florian Geyer on 20 April 1943 . This unit saw service in the Soviet Union in attacks on partisans and civilians . In addition , SS Cavalry regiments served in Croatia and Hungary . 
 = = = SS Medical Corps = = = 
 The SS Medical Corps were initially known as the <unk> ( sanitary units ) . After 1931 , the SS formed the headquarters office Amt V as the central office for SS medical units . An SS medical academy was established in Berlin in 1938 to train Waffen @-@ SS physicians . SS medical personnel did not often provide actual medical care ; their primary responsibility was <unk> genocide . At Auschwitz , about three @-@ quarters of new arrivals , including almost all children , women with small children , all the elderly , and all those who appeared on brief and superficial inspection by an SS doctor not to be completely fit were killed within hours of arrival . In their role as <unk> ( <unk> ) , SS doctors also made selections among existing prisoners as to their fitness to work , and supervised the killing of those deemed unfit . Inmates in deteriorating health were examined by SS doctors , who decided whether or not they would be able to recover in less than two weeks . Those too ill or injured to recover in that time frame were killed . 
 At Auschwitz , the actual delivery of gas to the victims was always handled by the SS , on the order of the supervising SS doctor . Many of the SS doctors also conducted inhumane medical experiments on camp prisoners . The most infamous SS doctor , Josef Mengele , served as a medical officer at Auschwitz under the command of Eduard Wirth of the camp 's medical corps . Mengele undertook selections even when he was not assigned to do so in the hope of finding subjects for his experiments . He was particularly interested in locating sets of twins . In contrast to most of the doctors , who viewed undertaking selections as one of their most stressful and horrible duties , Mengele undertook the task with a flamboyant air , often smiling or whistling a tune . After the war , many SS doctors were charged with war crimes for their inhumane medical experiments and for their role in gas chamber selections .

 The Ahnenerbe ( Ancestral Heritage Organization ) was founded in 1935 by Himmler , and became part of the SS in 1939 . It was an umbrella agency for more than fifty organizations tasked with studying the German racial identity and ancient Germanic traditions and language . The agency sponsored archaeological expeditions in Germany , Scandinavia , the Middle East , Tibet , and elsewhere to search for evidence of Aryan roots , influence , and superiority . Further planned expeditions were postponed indefinitely at the start of the war .

 The SS @-@ <unk> was an auxiliary reporting and clerical unit , which included the SS @-@ <unk> ( Women Helper Corps ) , made up of female volunteers . Members were assigned as administrative staff and supply personnel , and served in command positions and as guards at women 's concentration camps . Like their male equivalents in the SS , females participated in atrocities against Jews , Poles , and others . 
 In 1942 , Himmler set up the <unk> für SS <unk> ( Reich school for SS helpers ) in <unk> to train women in communications so that they could free up men for combat roles . Himmler also intended to replace all female civilian employees in his service with SS @-@ <unk> members , as they were selected and trained according to NSDAP ideology . The school was closed on 22 November 1944 due to the Allied advance .

 The SS @-@ <unk> ( Auxiliary @-@ SS ) were not considered regular SS members , but were conscripted from other branches of the German military , the NSDAP , SA , and the Volkssturm for service in concentration camps and extermination camps . 
 = = Foreign legions and volunteers = = 
 Beginning in 1940 , Himmler opened up Waffen @-@ SS recruiting to ethnic Germans that were not German citizens . In March 1941 , the SS Main Office established the <unk> <unk> ( Germanic Guidance Office ) to establish Waffen @-@ SS recruiting offices in Nazi @-@ occupied Europe . The majority of the resulting foreign Waffen @-@ SS units wore a distinctive national collar patch and preceded their SS rank titles with the prefix Waffen instead of SS . Volunteers from Scandinavian countries filled the ranks of two divisions , the SS @-@ Wiking and SS @-@ Nordland . Belgian Flemings joined Dutchmen to form the SS @-@ Nederland legion , and their Walloon compatriots joined the SS @-@ Wallonien . By the end of 1943 about a quarter of the SS were ethnic Germans from across Europe , and by June 1944 , half the Waffen @-@ SS were foreign nationals . 
 Additional Waffen @-@ SS units were added from the Ukrainians , Albanians from Kosovo , Serbians , Croatians , Turkic , Caucasians , Cossack , and Tatars . The Ukrainians and Tatars , who had suffered persecution under Stalin , were likely motivated primarily by opposition to the Soviet government rather than ideological agreement with the SS . The exiled Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Amin al @-@ Husseini was made an SS @-@ Gruppenführer by Himmler in May 1943 . He subsequently used antisemitism and anti @-@ Serb racism to recruit a Waffen @-@ SS division of Bosnian Muslims , the SS @-@ Handschar . The year @-@ long Soviet occupation of the Baltic states at the beginning of World War II resulted in volunteers for Latvian and Estonian Waffen @-@ SS units . The Estonian Legion had 1 @,@ 280 volunteers under training by the end of 1942 . Eventually , approximately 25 @,@ 000 men served in the Estonian SS division , with thousands more conscripted into Police Front battalions and border guard units . Most of the Estonians were fighting primarily to regain their independence and as many as 15 @,@ 000 of them died fighting alongside the Germans . In early 1944 , Himmler even contacted Pohl to suggest releasing Muslim prisoners from concentration camps to supplement his SS troops . 
 The Indian Legion was a Wehrmacht unit formed in August 1942 chiefly from disaffected Indian soldiers of the British Indian Army captured in the North African Campaign . In August 1944 it was transferred to the auspices of the Waffen @-@ SS as the Indische Freiwilligen @-@ Legion der Waffen @-@ SS . There was also a French volunteer division , SS @-@ Charlemagne , which was formed in 1944 mainly from the remnants of the Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism and French Sturmbrigade . 
 = = Ranks and uniforms = = 
 The SS established its own symbolism , rituals , customs , ranks and uniforms to set itself apart from other organizations . Before 1929 , the SS wore the same brown uniform as the SA , with the addition of a black tie and a black cap with a Totenkopf ( death 's head ) skull and bones symbol , moving to an all @-@ black uniform in 1932 . In 1935 , the SS combat formations adopted a service uniform in field grey for everyday wear . The SS also developed its own field uniforms , which included reversible smocks and helmet covers printed with camouflage patterns . Uniforms were manufactured in hundreds of licensed factories , with some workers being prisoners of war performing forced labor . Many were produced in concentration camps . 
 Hitler and the NSDAP understood the power of emblems and insignia to influence public opinion . The stylized lightning bolt logo of the SS was chosen in 1932 . The logo is a pair of runes from a set of 18 Armanen runes created by Guido von List in 1906 . It is similar to the ancient <unk> rune , which symbolizes the sun , but was renamed as " Sig " ( victory ) in List 's iconography . The Totenkopf symbolized the wearer 's willingness to fight unto the death , and also served to frighten the enemy .

 = = Austrian SS = = 
 The term " Austrian SS " is often used to describe that portion of the SS membership from Austria , but it was never a recognized branch of the SS . In contrast to SS members from other countries , who were grouped into either the Germanic @-@ SS or the Foreign Legions of the Waffen @-@ SS , Austrian SS members were regular SS personnel . It was technically under the command of the SS in Germany , but often acted independently concerning Austrian affairs . The Austrian SS was founded in 1930 and by 1934 was acting as a covert force to bring about the Anschluss with Germany , which occurred in March 1938 . Early Austrian SS leaders were Kaltenbrunner and Arthur Seyss @-@ Inquart . Austrian SS members served in every branch of the SS . Political scientist David Art of Tufts University notes that Austrians constituted 8 percent of the Third Reich 's population and 13 percent of the SS ; he states that 40 percent of the staff and 75 percent of commanders at death camps were Austrian . 
 After the Anschluss , the Austrian SS was folded into SS @-@ Oberabschnitt Donau . The third regiment of the SS @-@ Verfügungstruppe ( Der Führer ) and the fourth Totenkopf regiment ( Ostmark ) were recruited in Austria shortly thereafter . On Heydrich 's orders , mass arrests of potential enemies of the Reich began immediately after the Anschluss . Mauthausen was the first concentration camp opened in Austria following the Anschluss . Before the invasion of the Soviet Union , Mauthausen was the harshest of the camps in the Greater German Reich . 
 The Hotel Metropole was transformed into Gestapo headquarters in Vienna in April 1938 . With a staff of 900 ( 80 percent of whom were recruited from the Austrian police ) , it was the largest Gestapo office outside Berlin . An estimated 50 @,@ 000 people were interrogated or tortured there . The Gestapo in Vienna was headed by Franz Josef Huber , who also served as chief of the Central Agency for Jewish Emigration in Vienna . Although its de facto leaders were Adolf Eichmann and later Alois Brunner , Huber was nevertheless responsible for the mass deportation of Austrian Jews .

 Following Nazi Germany 's collapse , the SS ceased to exist . Numerous members of the SS , many of them still committed Nazis , remained at large in Germany and across Europe . On 21 May 1945 , the British captured Himmler , who was in disguise and using a false passport . At an internment camp near Lüneburg , he committed suicide by biting down on a cyanide capsule . Several other leading members of the SS fled , but some were quickly captured . Kaltenbrunner , chief of the RSHA and the highest @-@ ranking member of the SS upon Himmler 's suicide , was captured and arrested in the Bavarian Alps . He was among the 24 defendants put on trial at the International Military Tribunal in 1945 – 46 . 
 Some SS members were subject to summary execution , torture , and beatings at the hands of freed prisoners , displaced persons , or Allied soldiers . American soldiers of the 157th Regiment , who entered the concentration camp at Dachau in April 1945 and saw the human deprivation and cruelty committed by the SS , shot some of the remaining SS camp guards . On 15 April 1945 , British troops entered Bergen @-@ Belsen . They placed the SS guards on starvation rations , made them work without breaks , forced them to deal with the remaining corpses , and stabbed them with bayonets or struck them with their rifle butts if they slowed their pace . Some members of the US Army Counter Intelligence Corps delivered captured SS camp guards to displaced persons camps , where they knew they would be subject to summary execution .

 The Allies commenced legal proceedings against captured Nazis , establishing the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg in 1945 . The first war crimes trial of 24 prominent figures such as Göring , Albert Speer , Joachim von Ribbentrop , Alfred Rosenberg , Hans Frank , and Kaltenbrunner took place beginning in November 1945 . They were accused of four counts : conspiracy , waging a war of aggression , war crimes , and crimes against humanity in violation of international law . Twelve received the death penalty , including Kaltenbrunner , who was convicted of crimes against humanity and executed on 16 October 1946 . The former commandant at Auschwitz , Rudolf Höss , who testified on behalf of Kaltenbrunner and others , was tried and executed in 1947 . 
 Additional SS trials and convictions followed . Many defendants attempted to exculpate themselves using the excuse that they were merely following superior orders , which they had to obey unconditionally as part of their sworn oath and duty . The courts did not find this to be a legitimate defense . A trial of 40 SS officers and guards from Auschwitz took place in Kraków in November 1947 . Most were found guilty , and 23 received the death penalty . In addition to those tried by the Western allies , an estimated 37 @,@ 000 members of the SS were tried and convicted in Soviet courts . Sentences included hangings and long terms of hard labor . Piotr <unk> , the director of the Auschwitz @-@ Birkenau Museum , estimates that of the 70 @,@ 000 members of the SS involved in crimes in concentration camps , only about 1 @,@ 650 to 1 @,@ 700 were tried after the war . The International Military Tribunal declared the SS a criminal organization in 1946 .

 After the war , many former Nazis fled to South America , especially to Argentina , where they were welcomed by Juan Perón 's regime . In the 1950s , former Dachau inmate Lothar Hermann discovered that Buenos Aires resident Ricardo Klement was in fact Adolf Eichmann , who had in 1948 obtained false identification and a landing permit for Argentina through an organization directed by Bishop Alois Hudal , an Austrian cleric with Nazi sympathies then residing in Italy . Eichmann was captured in Buenos Aires on 11 May 1960 by Mossad , the Israeli intelligence agency . At his trial in Jerusalem in 1961 , he was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging . Eichmann was quoted as having stated , " I will jump into my grave laughing , because the fact that I have the death of five million Jews [ or Reich enemies , as he later claimed to have said ] on my conscience gives me extraordinary satisfaction . " Franz Stangl , the commandant of Treblinka , also escaped to South America with the assistance of Hudal 's network . He was deported to Germany in 1967 and was sentenced to life in prison in 1970 . He died in 1971 . 
 Mengele , worried that his capture would mean a death sentence , fled Germany on 17 April 1949 . Assisted by a network of former SS members , he traveled to Genoa , where he obtained a passport under the alias " Helmut Gregor " from the International Committee of the Red Cross . He sailed to Argentina in July . Aware that he was still a wanted man , he moved to Paraguay in 1958 and Brazil in 1960 . In both instances he was assisted by former Luftwaffe pilot Hans @-@ Ulrich Rudel . Mengele suffered a stroke while swimming and drowned in 1979 . 
 Thousands of Nazis , including former SS members such as Trawniki guard Jakob Reimer and Circassian collaborator <unk> <unk> , fled to the United States under the guise of refugees , sometimes using forged documents . Other SS men , such as <unk> , SD officer Wilhelm Höttl , Eichmann aide Otto von <unk> , and accused war criminal Theodor <unk> , were employed by American intelligence agencies against the Soviets . As CIA officer Harry Rositzke noted , " It was a visceral business of using any bastard so long as he was anti @-@ Communist ... The eagerness or desire to enlist collaborators means that sure , you didn 't look at their credentials too closely . " Similarly , the Soviets used SS personnel after the war ; Operation Theo , for instance , disseminated " subversive rumours " in Allied @-@ occupied Germany . 
 Simon Wiesenthal and others have speculated about the existence of a Nazi fugitive network code @-@ named ODESSA ( an acronym for Organisation der <unk> SS @-@ <unk> , Organization of former SS members ) that allegedly helped war criminals find refuge in Latin America . British writer Gitta Sereny , who conducted interviews with SS men , considers the story untrue and attributes the escapes to postwar chaos and Hudal 's Vatican @-@ based network . While the existence of ODESSA remains unproven , Sereny notes that " there certainly were various kinds of Nazi aid organizations after the war — it would have been astonishing if there hadn 't been .

 = John William Finn = 
 John William Finn ( 23 July 1909 – 27 May 2010 ) was a sailor in the United States Navy who , as a chief petty officer , received the United States military 's highest decoration , the Medal of Honor , for his actions during the attack on Pearl Harbor in World War II . As a chief aviation ordnanceman stationed at Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay , he earned the medal by manning a machine gun from an exposed position throughout the attack , despite being repeatedly wounded . He continued to serve in the Navy and in 1942 was commissioned an ensign . In 1947 he was reverted to chief petty officer , eventually rising to lieutenant before his 1956 retirement . In his later years he made many appearances at events celebrating veterans . At the time of his death , Finn was the oldest living Medal of Honor recipient and the last living recipient from the attack on Pearl Harbor . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Born on 24 July 1909 , in Compton , California , Finn dropped out of school after the seventh grade . He enlisted in the Navy in July 1926 , shortly before his seventeenth birthday , and completed recruit training in San Diego . After a brief stint with a ceremonial guard company , he attended General Aviation Utilities Training at Naval Station Great Lakes , graduating in December . By April 1927 he was back in the San Diego area , having been assigned to Naval Air Station North Island . He initially worked in aircraft repair before becoming an aviation ordnanceman and working on anti @-@ aircraft guns . He then served on a series of ships : the USS Lexington ( CV @-@ 2 ) , the USS Houston ( CA @-@ 30 ) , the USS Jason ( AC @-@ 12 ) , the USS Saratoga ( CV @-@ 3 ) , and the USS Cincinnati ( CL @-@ 6 ) . 
 Finn was promoted to chief petty officer ( E @-@ 7 , the highest enlisted rank in the Navy at that time ) in 1935 after only nine years of active duty . He later commented on his promotions , " Everybody thought I was a boy wonder . I was just in the right place at the right time . " As a chief , Finn served with patrol squadrons in San Diego , Washington , and Panama . 
 = = Attack on Pearl Harbor = = 
 By December 1941 , Finn was stationed at Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay on the island of Oahu in Hawaii . As a chief aviation ordnanceman , he was in charge of twenty men whose primary task was to maintain the weapons of VP @-@ 11 , a PBY Catalina flying boat squadron . At 7 : 48 a.m. on the morning of Sunday , 7 December 1941 , Finn was at his home , about a mile from the aircraft hangars , when he heard the sound of gunfire . Finn recalled how a neighbor was the first to alert him , when she knocked on his door saying , " They want you down at the squadron right away ! " He drove to the hangars , catching sight of Japanese planes in the sky on the way , and found that the airbase was being attacked , with most of the PBYs already on fire . 
 Finn 's men were trying to fight back by using the machine guns mounted in the PBYs , either by firing from inside the flaming planes or by detaching the guns and mounting them on improvised stands . Finn later explained that one of the first things he did was to take control of a machine gun from his squadron 's painter . " I said , ' Alex , let me take that gun ' ... knew that I had more experience firing a machine gun than a painter . " 
 Finding a movable tripod platform used for gunnery training , Finn attached the .50 caliber machine gun and pushed the platform into an open area , from which he had a clear view of the attacking aircraft . He fired on the Japanese planes for the next two hours , even after being seriously wounded , until the attack had ended . In total , he received 21 distinct wounds , including a bullet through his right foot and an injury to his left shoulder , which caused him to lose feeling in his left arm . 
 " I got that gun and I started shooting at Jap planes , " Finn said in a 2009 interview . " I was out there shooting the Jap planes and just every so often I was a target for some , " he said , " In some cases , I could see their [ the Japanese pilots ' ] faces . " 
 Despite his wounds , Finn returned to the hangars later that day . After receiving medical treatment , he helped arm the surviving American planes . His actions earned him the first Medal of Honor to be awarded in World War II . He was formally presented with the decoration on 14 September 1942 , by Admiral Chester Nimitz , for courage and valor beyond the call of duty . The ceremony took place in Pearl Harbor on board the USS Enterprise ( CV @-@ 6 ) . 
 In 1942 Finn was commissioned , and served as a Limited Duty Officer with the rank of ensign . In 1947 he was reverted to his enlisted rank of chief petty officer , eventually becoming a lieutenant with Bombing Squadron VB @-@ 102 and aboard the USS Hancock ( CV @-@ 19 ) . He retired from the Navy as a lieutenant in September 1956 .

 From 1956 until shortly before his death , Finn resided on a 90 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 36 km2 ) ranch in Live Oak Springs , near Pine Valley , California . He and his wife became foster parents to five Native American children , causing him to be embraced by the Campo Band of <unk> Mission Indians , a tribe of Kumeyaay people in San Diego . His wife , Alice Finn , died in 1998 . John Finn was a member of the John Birch Society . 
 In his retirement he made many appearances at events honoring veterans . On 25 March 2009 , he attended National Medal of Honor Day ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery . With the aid of walking sticks , he stood beside U.S. President Barack Obama during a wreath @-@ laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier . Later that day , Finn was a guest at the White House . It was his first visit to the White House , and his first time meeting a sitting President . 
 On June 27 , 2009 , a crowd of over 2 @,@ 000 made up of family , friends and well @-@ wishers came to Pine Valley to celebrate Finn 's 100th birthday . The Association of Aviation <unk> presented him with an American flag which had flown on each of the 11 aircraft carriers then in active service . 
 When called a hero during a 2009 interview Finn responded : 
 That damned hero stuff is a bunch [ of ] crap , I guess . [ ... ] You gotta understand that there 's all kinds of heroes , but they never get a chance to be in a hero 's position . 
 Finn died at age 100 on the morning of 27 May 2010 , at the Chula Vista Veterans Home . He was buried besides his wife at the Campo Indian Reservation 's cemetery , after a memorial service in El Cajon . He was the last surviving Medal of Honor recipient from the attack on Pearl Harbor , the oldest living recipient , and the only aviation ordnanceman to have ever received the medal . Upon his death , fellow World War II veteran Barney F. <unk> became the oldest living Medal of Honor recipient .

 The headquarters building for Commander , Patrol and Reconnaissance Force , United States Pacific Fleet at Marine Corps Base Hawaii Kaneohe was named in Finn 's honor , and in 2009 a boat used to bring visitors to the USS Arizona Memorial was also named after him . In that same year , part of Historic U.S. Route 80 , was named " John Finn Route " . Three buildings in the former Naval Training Center San Diego were named the John and Alice Finn Office Plaza .

 For extraordinary heroism , distinguished service , and devotion above and beyond the call of duty . During the first attack by Japanese airplanes on the Naval Air Station , Kaneohe Bay , Territory of Hawaii , on December 7 , 1941 , he promptly secured and manned a .50 caliber machine gun mounted on an instruction stand in a completely exposed section of the parking ramp , which was under heavy enemy machine gun strafing fire . Although painfully wounded many times , he continued to man this gun and to return the enemy 's fire vigorously and with telling effect throughout the enemy strafing and bombing attacks and with complete disregard for his own personal safety . It was only by specific orders that he was persuaded to leave his post to seek medical attention . Following first @-@ aid treatment , although obviously suffering much pain and moving with great difficulty , he returned to the squadron area and actively supervised the rearming of returning planes . His extraordinary heroism and conduct in this action are considered to be in keeping with the highest traditions of the Naval Service . 
 = Miodrag Tomić = 
 Miodrag Tomić ( Serbian Cyrillic : <unk> <unk> ; 17 May [ O.S. 5 May ] 1888 – 20 February 1962 ) was a Serbian and Yugoslav military pilot who flew during the Balkan Wars and World War I. 
 Tomić belonged to the first class of six Serbian pilots trained in France in 1912 . In August 1914 , he participated in the first aerial dogfight of the war , when he exchanged gunfire with an Austro @-@ Hungarian plane over western Serbia . In the winter of 1915 , during the Serbian Army 's retreat across Albania to the Greek island of Corfu , he evacuated General Petar Bojović from Scutari by plane , delivered mail by air and transported the Serbian Government 's gold and hard currency reserves from Niš to keep them from falling into enemy hands . Following the occupation of Serbia by the Central Powers , Tomić went to France and flew over the Western Front , where he had one confirmed kill . He returned to the Balkans in late 1916 , conducted combat missions over Bulgarian @-@ occupied Macedonia and shot down one enemy plane . Tomić continued flying after the war and became head of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force 's pursuit squadron in Novi Sad . During World War II , he was captured by the Germans and detained as a prisoner of war . Tomić left Yugoslavia following the war and settled in the United States with his wife . He died in Chicago in 1962 . 
 = = Early life , education and the Balkan Wars = = 
 Miodrag Tomić was born on 17 May [ O.S. 5 May ] 1888 in the village of <unk> , near Kragujevac . <unk> , he was a descendant of Serbian warlord <unk> <unk> , who was killed fighting the Turks during the First Serbian Uprising . Tomić finished primary school and gymnasium in Kragujevac . In 1905 , he enrolled into non @-@ commissioned officers ' school . He graduated successfully and became a member of King Peter 's Royal Guard . Serbia had been the first country in the Balkans to take interest in aerial warfare . Shortly after Austria @-@ Hungary 's annexation of Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina in 1908 , Serbia purchased two German reconnaissance balloons . In 1912 , prior to the First Balkan War , it sent six soldiers to France to receive pilots ' training and ordered eleven French planes . On 29 April 1912 , Tomić was sent to France to attend Louis Blériot 's flying school in Étampes , near Paris . He graduated on 1 October 1912 , after four months of training , and was issued diploma # 1026 . This made him one of Serbia 's first military pilots . 
 By the time Tomić had returned home , Serbia was embroiled in the Balkan Wars . On 24 December 1912 , the Serbian Aviation Command was established in Niš . Tomić was actively involved in the Siege of Scutari . On 29 March 1913 , Sergeant Tomić and Lieutenant Živojin Stanković spent forty @-@ five minutes flying over Scutari at a height of 2 @,@ 200 metres ( 7 @,@ 200 ft ) and spying on Turkish positions . In July 1913 , Tomić flew several flights over Bulgaria , conducting reconnaissance missions and dropping small bombs . At the end of the Balkan Wars , the Royal Serbian Army promoted Tomić to the rank of second lieutenant . 
 = = World War I = = 
 At the outbreak of World War I , the Royal Serbian Army had only three planes , one of which was piloted by Tomić . His plane was quite primitive even for 1914 . Misha Glenny , a journalist who has written extensively on the Balkans , likens it to " a box kite on perambulator wheels " . At the beginning of the war , Tomić was attached to the 1st Danube Division . On the afternoon of 12 August 1914 , he flew a reconnaissance mission over Šabac , and disclosed to the Serbian High Command that , contrary to initial reports , the Austro @-@ Hungarians had not set up pontoon bridges on the Sava and were attempting to cross the river with boats . On 15 August , Tomić encountered an enemy plane while conducting a reconnaissance flight over Austria @-@ Hungary . The Austro @-@ Hungarian aviator initially waved at Tomić , who waved back . The enemy pilot then took a revolver and began shooting at Tomić 's plane . Tomić produced a pistol of his own and fired back . He swerved away from the Austro @-@ Hungarian plane and the two aircraft eventually parted ways . This incident is considered the first recorded dogfight of the war . Within weeks , all Serbian and Austro @-@ Hungarians aircraft were armed . The Serbs equipped each of their planes with 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) Schwarzlose MG <unk> / 12 machine guns , six 100 @-@ round boxes of ammunition and several bombs . The first armed Serbian plane was given the name <unk> ( <unk> ) , or " storm " . It was mostly flown by Tomić . 
 Tomić was ordered to form an aerial unit of the Šumadija Division on 16 August . On 22 October , he became the first Serbian pilot to face enemy anti @-@ aircraft fire when his Blériot XI was targeted by Austro @-@ Hungarian field batteries . The first Serbian escadrille was formed in Belgrade the same day . Tomić went on to participate in multiple combat missions , dropping explosive ordnance on Austro @-@ Hungarian military positions and supply lines . In May 1915 , a number of French pilots came to Serbia to help the country 's war effort . Tomić was assigned to Požarevac airfield following the arrival of the French and flew missions over the Banat . A soldier named Milutin Mihailović was assigned to fly with him as a military observer . On 9 June , Tomić downed one German plane . Six days later , he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant . He shot down another German plane on 23 June . In total , Tomić and Mihailović flew nineteen combat missions over the Banat between early May and late August 1915 . 
 In October 1915 , Serbia was invaded by a combined Austro @-@ Hungarian , Bulgarian and German force . The Serbian Army was overwhelmed within weeks and forced to retreat across Albania to the Greek island of Corfu . The small Serbian Air Force withdrew from its headquarters in Banjica to Kruševac via <unk> , <unk> Palanka and <unk> . In Kruševac , Tomić and lieutenant Živojin Stanković were tasked with destroying four obsolete airplanes to keep them from falling into enemy hands . Upon completing the task , Tomić and Stanković manned two small biplanes and headed for Peć . Tomić successfully reached Kosovo , but Stanković did not . His plane crashed near the town of <unk> , leaving him seriously injured . Tomić continued south , successfully transporting the Serbian Government 's gold reserves out of Niš and ensuring they did not fall into the hands of the Central Powers . He also flew important mail in and out of Serbia , and evacuated the country 's hard currency reserves . In Kosovo , Tomić contracted typhus . On 19 November , he and aerial mechanic <unk> Milekić landed in Prizren . They spent the next two days wandering the countryside and walking through knee @-@ deep snow . During the day , the air temperature reached − 40 ° C ( − 40 ° F ) . The two stayed near their plane , waiting for orders from the Serbian High Command . On 21 November , Tomić and Milekić received orders to destroy their plane and go to Albania on foot . They decided against destroying the Blériot XI and took off the following morning , headed for Durrës . The Blériot XI was designed to fly for a maximum of four hours , but Tomić managed to keep it flying for the duration of the four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hour flight to Durrës and landed safely on a field near the town . Locals soon discovered the plane and escorted Tomić and Milekić to Serbian envoy <unk> <unk> . Tomić recovered from his ordeal and later evacuated General Petar Bojović from Scutari to Lezhë . Heavy winds over the town caused Tomić 's plane to crash on 23 January 1916 . He escaped unharmed . 
 While the Serbian Army recovered on Corfu , Tomić was assigned to the Western Front and flew with a French escadrille — Escadrille 389 . During his time in France , he successfully downed one German plane . Colonel <unk> , the C.O. of the Serbian Air Force , commended Tomić on 16 November 1916 . Tomić soon returned to the Balkans , ready to conduct aerial missions on the Salonika Front . He flew a Nieuport 23 fighter on a number of combat missions over Bulgarian @-@ occupied Macedonia as part of Escadrille 387 . At about 10 a.m. on 17 April 1917 , Tomić and his escadrille attacked a group of fourteen Bulgarian planes conducting a bombing raid against the Serbian rear . His plane sustained serious damage during the encounter ; it was struck by a number of incendiary bullets and its fuel line was severed . Unable to continue flying , Tomić was forced to land near Demir Kapija . In another aerial confrontation on 8 July , he successfully shot down a Bulgarian plane . This was Tomić 's first recorded kill in Salonika , and his fourth overall . He was commended for this feat on 12 July , by order of the Serbian High Command . Following the Allied breakthrough in Macedonia , Tomić and his escadrille landed at Novi Sad , after which he was promoted to the rank of captain .

 Tomić remained in the armed forces after the war , serving with the Royal Yugoslav Air Force and becoming the commander of the Novi Sad pursuit squadron . In the 1920s , he achieved the rank of colonel . He married a woman named Danica , who later also became a pilot . In April 1941 , Tomić was captured as a prisoner of war during the German @-@ led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia . Following World War II , he and his wife immigrated to the United States .

 Iore , often stylized <unk> , is a class of 26 electric locomotives built by Adtranz and its successor Bombardier Transportation for the Swedish mining company LKAB 's railway division Malmtrafik . The class is a variation of Adtranz 's <unk> modular product platform , thus related to Bombardier 's later TRAXX platform . The locomotives haul iron ore freight trains on the Iron Ore Line and Ofoten Line in Sweden and Norway , respectively . The 8 @,@ 600 @-@ tonne ( 8 @,@ 500 @-@ long @-@ ton ; 9 @,@ 500 @-@ short @-@ ton ) 68 @-@ car trains are hauled by two single @-@ ended Co ′ Co ′ locomotives , each with a power output of 5 @,@ 400 kW ( 7 @,@ 200 hp ) . Each operates with 600 kilonewtons ( 130 @,@ 000 pounds @-@ force ) tractive effort and has a maximum speed of 80 km / h ( 50 mph ) . Delivery of the first series of 18 locomotives was made from 2000 to 2004 , and they replaced some of the aging Dm3 and El 15 units . In 2007 , eight more vehicles ( 4 double units ) were ordered , with production to be completed by 2011 , by which time , another four double units were ordered . These units are scheduled to be delivered from 2013 to 2014 . 
 = = History = = 
 The Ofoten Line and the Iron Ore Line are two railroad lines which were built to allow iron ore to be hauled from the LKAB 's mines in Kiruna , Svappavaara and Malmberget in Sweden to Luleå on the Baltic Sea in Sweden and to Narvik on the Norwegian Sea in Norway . Historically , these lines were operated by the Norwegian State Railways ( NSB ) in Norway and the Swedish State Railways ( SJ ) in Sweden , but in 1996 the operations , but not the infrastructure , were transferred to the new company Malmtrafik i Kiruna ( MTAB ) , a joint venture between LKAB , NSB and SJ , and its Norwegian subsidiary <unk> ( <unk> ) . At the time , the line was using El 15 and Dm3 locomotives . 
 In 1998 , LKAB estimated a steady 35 % increase in iron ore production until 2005 , and requested that the governments grant sufficient funding to upgrade the lines from 25 @-@ tonne ( 25 @-@ long @-@ ton ; 28 @-@ short @-@ ton ) to 30 @-@ tonne ( 30 @-@ long @-@ ton ; 33 @-@ short @-@ ton ) maximum permitted axle load . Combined with new locomotives , this would give increased efficiency in hauling the ore from the mines . The upgrade was estimated to cost 180 million Norwegian krone ( NOK ) for the Ofoten Line alone . 
 In March 1998 , LKAB awarded the contract to build 750 new 100 @-@ tonne hopper cars to <unk> of South Africa . In August , an agreement was reached whereby LKAB would pay NOK 100 million of the NOK 130 million needed to upgrade the Ofoten Line . The contract to deliver 18 locomotives was signed with Adtranz Switzerland on 15 September 1998 . In 1999 , LKAB bought SJ 's and NSB 's share in MTAB . 
 The first two sections were delivered by Adtranz in August 2000 , and was subjected to intensive tests before the manufacture of the rest of the series . Commissioning concluded in December 2000 , the locomotive started regular service on 10 January 2001 , and started operation with the new hopper cars and 30 @-@ tonne ( 30 @-@ long @-@ ton ; 33 @-@ short @-@ ton ) axle load on 7 March 2001 . In May 2001 , Bombardier Transportation took over Adtranz . Bombardier delivered the rest of the Iore series from 2002 to 2005 . In March 2004 , LKAB decided not to purchase additional hopper cars from <unk> , and instead purchased 750 heavier cars from K @-@ Industrier . Since 1969 , the ore trains have been using the Soviet SA3 coupler . However , LKAB wanted to also try Janney couplers ( also known as AAR coupler , used in much heavier trains in USA and South Africa ) , as the SA3 couplers were not much tested with the new weights . While the first pair of locomotives had Janney couplers , the rest of the first batch were equipped with SA3 couplers to handle the existing hopper cars , and later retrofitted with Janney couplers . In 2004 , the El 15 locomotives were sold to Hector Rail . 
 On 23 August 2007 , LKAB ordered another four twin units , with delivery in 2010 and 2011 , and costing € 52 million . These will replace all remaining Dm3 locomotives by 2011 , and LKAB convert all the ore trains to 68 cars . This will increase the capacity from 28 to 33 million tonnes per year , and at the same time reduce the number of departures per day from 21 to 15 . 
 The name Iore is a mixture between the term Iron ore , and the fictional character Eeyore from Winnie @-@ the @-@ Pooh , spelled I @-@ or in Swedish .

 The Iore class was a cold @-@ adapted and heavy @-@ haul derivation from Adtranz 's <unk> modular electric locomotive platform , which was launched in 1998 on the basis of Adtranz 's latest models for Deutsche Bahn at the time . Adtranz and later Bombardier Transportation conducted the final assembly of the locomotives at Kassel , Germany . When Bombardier Transportation introduced the brand name TRAXX for its updated modular locomotive platform , the type designation TRAXX <unk> AC was applicable to the Iore class , however , it was excluded from the TRAXX family by the time of the second batch order in 2007 . The manufacturer has also referred to the locomotive type as the Bombardier Kiruna . 
 Each Iore consists of twin units with one driver 's cab at each . They normally operate in fixed units of two , making a pair capable of hauling a 8 @,@ 600 @-@ tonne ( 8 @,@ 500 @-@ long @-@ ton ; 9 @,@ 500 @-@ short @-@ ton ) ore train . Technically an Iore section is also capable to operate as single locomotive , an option that is seldom used in operation . The units are fed with 15 kV 16 2 ⁄ 3 Hz AC via a pantograph . The power is transformed and then converted via a single water @-@ cooled gate turn @-@ off ( GTO ) thyristor based converter per bogie . The converters belong to the Camilla family , which was developed by ABB 's Swiss branch as successor for its oil @-@ cooled converters , and found previous use in the FS Class <unk> . The converters operate independently , with their own cooling and control systems and are shut down automatically in case of failure . The converters consist of seven line @-@ replaceable unit modules to minimize maintenance costs . Each locomotive has six three @-@ phase asynchronous alternating current traction motors , each rated at 918 kW ( 1 @,@ 231 hp ) and each powering a single axle . This gives a Co ′ Co ′ wheel arrangement . The tractive effort of each locomotive is 600 kN ( 130 @,@ 000 lbf ) and the maximum dynamic braking effort is 375 kN ( 84 @,@ 000 lbf ) . There is also a boost function , allowing a temporary traction effort of 700 kN ( 160 @,@ 000 lbf ) . The units are capable of 80 km / h ( 50 mph ) in single runs , 70 km / h ( 43 mph ) with empty trains and 60 km / h ( 37 mph ) with loaded trains . 
 The locomotives are 22 @.@ 905 m ( 75 ft 1 @.@ 8 in ) long , 4 @.@ 465 m ( 14 ft 7 @.@ 8 in ) tall and 2 @.@ 950 m ( 9 ft 8 @.@ 1 in ) wide . The distance between the bogie centers is 12 @.@ 890 m ( 42 ft 3 @.@ 5 in ) and the bogie wheel @-@ base is 1 @.@ 920 m ( 6 ft 3 @.@ 6 in ) . The wheel diameter is 1 @.@ 250 m ( 4 ft 1 @.@ 2 in ) when new and 1 @.@ 150 m ( 3 ft 9 @.@ 3 in ) when worn . Each locomotive weighs 180 tonnes ( 180 long tons ; 200 short tons ) , of which 38 tonnes ( 37 long tons ; 42 short tons ) is electrical equipment . Each locomotive has 30 tonnes ( 30 long tons ; 33 short tons ) of dead weight to increase the locomotive 's weight to the maximum axle weight , and further weight increase has been achieved by making the walls 4 centimetres ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) wide with armored steel . The extra wall thickness also provides for increased structural strength , to withstand collisions with snowdrifts and elk . The sides of the walls were built as flat as possible to reduce the sticking of blowing snow and ice formation . 
 The auxiliary system is powered via a separate transformer winding feeding three independent insulated gate bipolar transistor ( IGBT ) converters each providing a three @-@ phase 400 volt system . The locomotive is designed with an open system architecture that can be adapted later . Diagnostic information is available to the driver and can be sent to the control center via GSM @-@ R. The locomotive has a large and bright cab with space for up to three people . The second series of locomotives have an improved driver 's chair , which has been retrofitted on the older trains . The machine room has a center hallway . All high @-@ current equipment is located behind a door which can only be opened with a special key . This key is locked in such a way that it cannot be accessed without grounding the locomotive , and similarly the locomotive cannot be ungrounded again until the key is back in place . 
 = = Operation = = 
 LKAB operates iron ore mines in Kiruna , Svappavaara and Malmberget in Norrbotten County , Sweden . Most of the output is transported by rail to the ice @-@ free Port of Narvik , a route named the Northern Circuit . A minority of the ore is transported to Luleå on the Southern Circuit . Located on the Baltic Sea , ore is shipped to Baltic customers , or delivered to furnaces operated by <unk> in Luleå and <unk> . The Iron Ore and Ofoten Lines are 536 km ( 333 mi ) long , including the branch to Svappavaara , with the route from Kiruna to Narvik being 170 km ( 110 mi ) , and from Malmberget to Luleå being 220 km ( 140 mi ) . Operations are handled by LKAB 's subsidiary Malmtrafik i Kiruna ( MTAB ) in Sweden , and <unk> ( <unk> ) in Norway . As of 2010 , six pairs of the first batch Iore locomotives operate 11 to 13 trains daily in each direction on the Northern Circuit , and the remaining three pairs of the first batch operate five to six trains on the Southern Circuit . The four pairs of second @-@ batch locomotives will replace Dm3 locomotives on the Northern Circuit by 2011 . 
 The trains hauled by Iore are 68 cars long and weigh 8 @,@ 600 tonnes ( 8 @,@ 500 long tons ; 9 @,@ 500 short tons ) . From <unk> on the national border to the Port of Narvik , the trains use only a fifth of the power they regenerate . The regenerated energy is sufficient to power the empty trains back up to the national border . Although the trains and hopper cars are all owned by LKAB , the line is owned by the Swedish Transport Administration and the Norwegian National Rail Administration . The Iron Ore and Ofoten Lines are also used by passenger and container trains . 
 = General Dynamics F @-@ 111C = 
 The General Dynamics F @-@ 111C ( nicknamed " Pig " ) is a variant of the F @-@ 111 Aardvark medium @-@ range interdictor and tactical strike aircraft , developed by General Dynamics to meet Australian requirements . The design was based on the F @-@ 111A model but included longer wings and strengthened undercarriage . The Australian government ordered 24 F @-@ 111Cs to equip the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) in 1963 , but the aircraft were not delivered until 1973 because of long @-@ running technical problems . During 1979 and 1980 four of these aircraft were converted to the RF @-@ 111C reconnaissance variant . Four ex @-@ United States Air Force ( USAF ) F @-@ 111As were purchased by Australia and converted to F @-@ 111C standard in 1982 to replace F @-@ 111Cs destroyed during accidents . Australia also operated 15 F @-@ 111Gs between 1993 and 2007 , mainly for conversion training . The RAAF retired its remaining F @-@ 111Cs in December 2010 . 
 The F @-@ 111Cs gave the RAAF a powerful strike capability but were never used in combat . The aircraft went through modernisation programs in the 1980s and 1990s , and the RAAF acquired improved weapons to maintain their ability to penetrate hostile airspace . Despite this , by the 2000s the F @-@ 111Cs were becoming outdated and expensive to maintain , leading to a decision to retire them in 2010 rather than 2020 as originally planned . The F @-@ 111s were replaced by 24 Boeing F / A @-@ 18F Super Hornets pending delivery of F @-@ 35 Lightning IIs in development .

 In June 1960 , the United States Air Force issued a requirement for an F @-@ 105 Thunderchief replacement . The U.S. Navy began a program to develop a new air defence fighter for use on its large aircraft carriers . On 14 February 1961 , newly appointed United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara formally directed that the services study the development of a single aircraft that would satisfy both requirements . The Tactical Fighter Experimental ( TFX ) requirements were based largely on the Air Force 's needs . A request for proposals ( RFP ) for the TFX was provided to industry in October 1961 . After four rounds of proposals , General Dynamics ( GD ) was selected over Boeing ; GD signed the TFX contract in December 1962 . 
 The USAF F @-@ 111A and Navy F @-@ 111B variants used the same airframe structural components and TF30 @-@ P @-@ 1 turbofan engines . They featured side @-@ by @-@ side crew seating in an escape capsule , as required by the Navy . Because of conflict between the Air Force and Navy over whose requirements had precedence , McNamara intervened in 1961 , declaring that the Air Force desires would override suggestions by the Navy . The F @-@ 111A variant first flew on 21 December 1964 from Carswell AFB , Texas . It was followed by the F @-@ 111B , which first flew on 18 May 1965 . 
 As F @-@ 111 development continued , stall issues arose in certain parts of the flight regime ; these were addressed by modifying the engine inlet in 1965 – 66 , ending with the " Triple Plow I " and " Triple Plow II " designs . The F @-@ 111B was cancelled by the Navy in 1968 due to weight and performance deficiencies . The improved F @-@ 111E , F @-@ <unk> , F @-@ 111F models were subsequently developed for the USAF . The FB @-@ 111A strategic bomber and the EF @-@ 111 electronic warfare versions were also later developed for the USAF . Production ended in 1976 , with a total of 563 F @-@ 111 variants built , well below the prediction of 1 @,@ 500 . 
 = = = Replacing the Canberra = = = 
 The Menzies government first publicly discussed the need for replacing the English Electric Canberra in 1954 , only a year after the RAAF began receiving the bomber . The non @-@ supersonic Canberra lacked radar and electronic countermeasures , all disadvantages based on Korean War experience . The RAAF believed that it needed a new strategic bomber to fulfill the nation 's obligations to the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve in Malaysia , ANZUS , and SEATO . Air Staff Requirement 36 that year mandated an all @-@ weather attack aircraft by 1959 capable of delivering a variety of bombs and missiles . A study recommended one of the British V bombers , but Prime Minister Robert Menzies ' Minister of Defence Frederick Shedden decided in 1956 that at £ 1 million each they were too expensive . 
 Air Marshal Valston Hancock , Chief of the Air Staff , stated in April 1960 that Australia needed a replacement for the Canberra . Although in mid @-@ 1962 the Menzies government again decided to not replace the Canberra , Indonesia 's increasingly aggressive statements regarding Malaysia soon caused Australia to reevaluate the decision . The Sydney Morning Herald reported in October 1962 that the Indonesian Air Force 's Soviet Tupolev Tu @-@ 16 bombers could reach Sydney or any other Australian city with a light bomb load , while the Canberras could not fly in all weather and had a range of 900 miles ( 1 @,@ 400 km ) , insufficient to reach Djakarta . The opposition Labor Party , led by Arthur Calwell , used the report to criticize Menzies . The government denied that the Tu @-@ 16 could reach Sydney , but Minister for Air Frederick Osborne acknowledged that the Canberras were " the weakest link in our armoury at the present moment " . He stated , however , that the available foreign bombers were unsuitable for the RAAF . The American Boeing B @-@ 52 Stratofortress and Convair B @-@ 58 Hustler , for example , were too large for existing Australian runways . More suitable aircraft such as the British BAC TSR @-@ 2 and the American TFX ( later the F @-@ 111 ) would soon be available , Osborne said . 
 = = = Hancock study = = = 
 In May 1963 Menzies announced an A £ 200 million increase in defence spending over the next five years , and proposed to send a team led by Hancock overseas to evaluate Canberra replacements . Early candidates were the French Dassault Mirage IV , the TSR @-@ 2 , and the U.S. North American A @-@ 5 Vigilante , McDonnell Douglas F @-@ 4 Phantom II and the TFX . From June to August , Hancock 's team visited France , Britain and the United States to evaluate the competitors , and determined that the TFX would be the aircraft best suited for the role . The Mirage IV had insufficient range and the A £ 108 million price was too expensive . The F @-@ 4 and the A @-@ 5 were immediately available , but the less expensive F @-@ 4 would need air @-@ to @-@ air refueling to reach Indonesia from Australia . The TSR @-@ 2 was behind schedule and over budget , was the most expensive at A £ 122 million for 24 aircraft , and British government support for the program was uncertain . While the TFX was also controversial in the United States , its promised performance specifications and per @-@ aircraft cost were superior to that of the TSR @-@ 2 . As he did not expect TFX to be available before 1970 , however , Hancock recommended buying 36 A @-@ 5 aircraft for A £ 88 million to counteract the perceived imminent threat from Indonesia . 
 The Menzies government was reluctant to choose as interim replacement the A @-@ 5 or the F @-@ 4 , which could not be deployed until 1966 and would cost A $ 120 – 180 million . Waiting for the TSR @-@ 2 or TFX in 1969 or 1970 seemed to pose great risk , but when considering Hancock 's findings in September 1963 it wanted to be able to offer a substantial response to the Labor party 's criticism of its defence strategy . The British and American governments competed on behalf of their nations ' unbuilt bombers , as both believed that export sales would increase domestic support for the aircraft . The Menzies government viewed the British promise to deploy a squadron of V bombers in Australia for interim defense until the TSR @-@ 2 was ready as unacceptable for both technical and political reasons . Beyond its cost , the Royal Air Force had not ordered the TSR @-@ 2 ; the Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Louis Mountbatten , who opposed it , advised the Australians against buying the aircraft and the RAAF feared being the only customer . 
 = = = Decision = = = 
 The government determined that it did not need to go ahead with an immediate replacement for the Canberra and preferred Hancock 's original choice of the TFX as a long @-@ term solution , leading to the Menzies government 's announcement on 24 October that it was ordering 24 F @-@ 111s for US $ 125 million , enough for two squadrons . The announcement came during the campaigning for the 1963 general election . Calwell 's Labor party had on 22 October reiterated its pre @-@ campaign promise that it would replace the Canberras as soon as it formed a government . The government 's announcement , and the consequent improvement of its chances against Labor , likely also benefited the United States ; the purchase helped rebut American critics of the TFX , and the Kennedy administration preferred Menzies ' defence policies to the opposition 's . The contract was signed the following year through the U.S. Department of Defense . The British government 's cancellation of the TSR @-@ 2 in April 1965 showed that Australia 's decision to not order it was correct . 
 = = = Procurement , delays , and renaming = = = 
 The U.S. offered two squadrons of Boeing B @-@ 47 Stratojets for free lease pending the delivery of the F @-@ 111 ; Australia declined the offer in June 1964 — despite the aircraft having been demonstrated around the country just before the 1963 election as an interim Canberra replacement , likely another sign of the American preference for Menzies — because the B @-@ 47 did not offer significant improvements over the Canberra and , like the V bombers , would require longer runways . 
 The immensely complex and ambitious F @-@ 111 design and construction process forced the Australian government to quickly adopt sophisticated American procurement and project management methods . Although Australia originally planned to buy the American F @-@ 111A design , RAAF liaison officers requested country @-@ specific changes such as a long @-@ distance radio , Aeronautical Research Laboratories in Melbourne participated in an intake redesign and provided metal fatigue expertise , and an Australian test pilot evaluated the Australian version 's longer wings and performance in tropical conditions . The differences from the F @-@ 111A caused it to be designated the F @-@ 111C in 1966 . 
 = = = Delivery = = = 
 The first F @-@ 111C was officially delivered in 1968 , finally giving Australia an aircraft that could fly to Jakarta , drop bombs , and return without refueling . ( The RAAF only acquired air @-@ to @-@ air refueling for the F / A @-@ 18 , possibly to avoid causing difficulties with other Asian countries by increasing the F @-@ 111C 's already great range . ) Training began in 1967 , with RAAF personnel seeing terrain @-@ following radar and other sophisticated equipment for the first time . However , development delays and structural problems delayed acceptance of aircraft by the RAAF until 1973 . These issues were mainly to do with the wing attach points , and the redesign of the F @-@ 111 engine intakes . Completion of contractual requirements to the satisfaction of Australia also took time , damaging the morale of the hundreds of trained RAAF personnel who had little to do . The program costs , during 1963 – 1967 , grew at an alarming rate ; estimates by the USAF at the start of the program was placed at US $ 124 @.@ 5 million , but by April 1967 had risen to $ 237 @.@ 75 million . While the initial price of US $ 5 @.@ 21 million per aircraft was capped at US $ 5 @.@ 95 million , R & D , labor , and other costs were not . The rising price , three unexplained losses of USAF F @-@ 111As in Vietnam during their first month of deployment , and the British and U.S. Navy 's orders ' cancellations caused further controversy in Australia during 1968 . By 1973 , however , when the F @-@ 111A had accumulated 250 @,@ 000 flight hours , it had the best safety record among contemporary aircraft , which presaged the F @-@ 111C 's own excellent record . 
 Four aircraft were modified to RF @-@ 111C reconnaissance configuration during 1979 – 80 , retaining their strike capability . The RF @-@ 111C carried a reconnaissance pack with four cameras and an infrared <unk> unit . Four ex @-@ USAF F @-@ 111As were refitted to F @-@ 111C standard and delivered to Australia as attrition replacements in 1982 . There F @-@ 111Cs were equipped to carry Pave Tack FLIR / laser pods in the mid @-@ 1980s . They underwent an extensive Avionics Upgrade Program through 1998 . Under this program , the F @-@ 111C was upgraded to digital avionics . This included twin mission computers , modern digital <unk> , digital weapon management system , new AN / APQ @-@ 171 terrain @-@ following radar , new AN / APQ @-@ 169 attack radar , and twin ring @-@ laser gyro INS . 
 In late 2001 , wing fatigue problems were discovered in one of the F @-@ 111C fleet . As a result , a decision was made in May 2002 to replace the wings with spares taken from ex @-@ USAF F @-@ <unk> stored at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center ( <unk> ) . The short span wings underwent a refurbishment in Australia , which included extending the span , in effect making the wings the same as the F @-@ 111C and F @-@ 111G models . Following the Avionics Upgrade Program , Australian F @-@ 111s received weapons system and various other upgrades .

 The F @-@ 111 was an all @-@ weather attack aircraft capable of low @-@ level penetration of enemy defences to deliver ordnance on the target .

The F @-@ 111 had a three @-@ point undercarriage arrangement with a two @-@ wheel nose gear and two single @-@ wheel main undercarriage . Most F @-@ 111 variants included a terrain @-@ following radar system connected to the autopilot . The aircraft were powered by two Pratt & Whitney TF30 afterburning turbofan engines . 
 The F @-@ 111 's internal weapons bay could also carry bombs , a removable 20 mm M61 cannon , or auxiliary fuel tanks . The F @-@ 111C was equipped to carry the AN / <unk> @-@ 26 Pave Tack targeting system on a rotating carriage that kept the pod protected within the weapons bay when not in use . Pave Tack is a FLIR and laser rangefinder / designator that allowed the F @-@ 111 to designate targets and drop laser @-@ guided bombs on them . RF @-@ 111Cs carried a pallet of sensors and cameras for reconnaissance use .

 = = = Entry into service = = = 
 The Australian government ordered 24 F @-@ 111C aircraft to replace the RAAF 's English Electric Canberras in the bombing and tactical strike role . While the first aircraft was officially handed over on 4 September 1968 , structural issues delayed the entry into service of the F @-@ 111C . Twenty @-@ four USAF F @-@ 4 Phantom IIs were leased as an interim measure . The Phantoms were delivered in September and October 1970 to No. 82 Wing at RAAF Base Amberley , Queensland . During its next three years in RAAF service , one F @-@ 4 was lost . By June 1973 , the remaining 23 Phantoms were returned to the U.S. Like the F @-@ 111 , the F @-@ 4 was a two @-@ seat , multi @-@ role , supersonic aircraft . Much more sophisticated than the Canberra , capable of air @-@ to @-@ air and air @-@ to @-@ ground attack roles ; it had inertial navigation , a gun and radar . Experience with the F @-@ 4 likely contributed to the RAAF 's success with the F @-@ 111 . The RAAF proposed keeping the F @-@ 4 and using it with the F @-@ 111 , but the government decided that the cost was too great . 
 The F @-@ 111C entered Australian service after the technical problems were resolved , and the first F @-@ 111C was accepted at Nellis Air Force Base on 15 March 1973 . On 31 March , the RAAF Washington Flying Unit was formed at McClellan Air Force Base in California with the mission of ferrying the first 12 F @-@ 111Cs to Australia . This unit was commanded by Group Captain John Newham , who later served as Chief of the Air Staff between 1985 and 1988 . The RAAF 's first six F @-@ 111Cs arrived at Amberley on 1 July 1973 , and three subsequent groups of six F @-@ 111s arrived on 27 July , 28 September and 4 December . F @-@ 111Cs were allocated to No. 1 Squadron and No. 6 Squadron , under the control of No. 82 Wing . No. 1 Squadron was the RAAF 's strike squadron , and maintained a nominal strength of 12 F @-@ 111s . No. 6 Squadron mainly served as the F @-@ 111 operational conversion unit , though it also operated the RF @-@ 111 aircraft at times and could serve in the strike role if required . Once in RAAF service , all F @-@ 111 maintenance was undertaken at Amberley . From 1973 to 2001 No. 482 Squadron conducted intermediate maintenance of the aircraft , while heavy maintenance was the responsibility of No. 3 Aircraft Depot . No. 482 Squadron also operated the RAAF 's F @-@ 111 flight simulator . From 2001 onwards , Boeing Australia performed all F @-@ 111 maintenance under a contract with the Australian government . 
 After entering service the F @-@ 111 proved highly successful . Although it never saw combat , the F @-@ 111C was the fastest , longest range combat aircraft in Southeast Asia . Aviation historian Alan Stephens has written that they were " the preeminent weapons system in the Asia @-@ Pacific region " throughout their service and provided Australia with " a genuine , independent strike capability " . Stewart Wilson , in his book Lincoln , Canberra and F @-@ 111 in Australian Service , described the F @-@ 111C as " an unqualified success ... , providing Australia with a potent strike capability in an aircraft which , a quarter of century after its first flight remains second to none . " Former Indonesian defense minister Benny <unk> told his counterpart Kim Beazley that when others became upset with Australia during cabinet meetings , <unk> told them " Do you realise the Australians have a bomber that can put a bomb through that window on to the table here in front of us ? " 
 = = = Gulf War and East Timor = = = 
 During late 1990 and early 1991 the Australian government considered deploying F @-@ 111Cs to expand the Australian contribution to the 1991 Gulf War , which mainly comprised a Royal Australian Navy task group . The Department of Defence and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade 's ( <unk> ) preferred option if the government decided to expand Australia 's commitment was to deploy at least two RF @-@ 111s , though these aircraft would need to have their electronic warfare equipment upgraded to operate in this war zone . Due to the small size of the RF @-@ 111 force , the loss of any of these aircraft in combat would have inflicted a heavy blow on Australia 's reconnaissance capability . The second preference in the advice put to the government was to deploy a squadron of four to eight F @-@ 111Cs , though Defence did not support this . In the event , the government decided to not expand the Australian force . As a result , the F @-@ 111Cs ' contribution to the war was limited to conducting intensive exercises with the Naval ships as they sailed through Australian waters en route to the Persian Gulf . 
 The Australian @-@ led INTERFET intervention into East Timor in September 1999 marked the closest Australia 's F @-@ 111s came to combat . F @-@ 111s from both No. 1 and No. 6 Squadrons were deployed to RAAF Base Tindal , Northern Territory , on 28 August to support the international forces , and remained there until 17 December 1999 . This was a maximum effort for No. 82 Wing , and up to 10 F @-@ 111Cs were available at Tindal ; No. 1 Squadron 's commitment peaked at six aircraft and about 100 personnel . No. 75 Squadron also maintained 12 F / A @-@ 18s at its home base of Tindal to support INTERFET if needed . From 20 September , when INTERFET began to arrive in East Timor , the F @-@ 111s were maintained at a high level of readiness to conduct reconnaissance flights or air strikes if the situation deteriorated . For the latter role two F @-@ 111s armed with concrete @-@ filled bombs fitted with precision guidance kits were kept available at all times . INTERFET did not encounter significant resistance , however , and F @-@ 111 operations were limited to reconnaissance missions conducted by RF @-@ 111Cs from 5 November . Each of these sorties were made after gaining approval from the Indonesian government and normally focused on bridges and communications installations . The last RF @-@ 111C flight over East Timor took place on 9 December . War games had the F @-@ 111s achieving complete success if a strike was necessary against Indonesian military headquarters near the capital . 
 = = = Other roles and controversies = = = 
 The Royal Australian Air Force 's F @-@ 111 fleet was at times controversial . The long delay to the delivery of the aircraft was a significant political issue in the late 1960s and early 1970s . This occurred around the same time that massive delays and cost blowouts to the Sydney Opera House were making headlines , prompting some commentators to dub the F @-@ 111 the " Flying Opera House " . In 1983 the Hawke government tasked an RF @-@ 111 to take surveillance photos of the Franklin Dam project in Tasmania . The use of an RAAF aircraft to " spy " on its own territory led to the minister responsible , Senator Gareth Evans , earning the nickname " Biggles " ( after the famous hero pilot of a number of books by Captain W.E. Johns ) . Another aspect of the F @-@ 111 which drew criticism was the poor work conditions for F @-@ 111 ground crew involved in sealing / de @-@ sealing F @-@ 111 fuel tanks resulted in a class action lawsuit and the Australian government paying out more than A $ 20 million in damages . The health issues with chemical exposure included permanent brain damage to a number of ground crew before conditions were improved . 
 A number of ex @-@ USAF aircraft were delivered to Australia as attrition replacements and to enlarge the fleet . Four aircraft modified to the F @-@ 111C standard were delivered in 1982 . The government bought 15 F @-@ 111Gs to supplement its F @-@ 111Cs in 1992 and delivered in 1994 . Additional stored ex @-@ USAF F @-@ 111s were reserved as a spare parts sources . In Australian military and aviation circles , the F @-@ 111 Aardvark was affectionately known as the " Pig " , due to its long snout and terrain @-@ following ability . 
 Seven of the 28 F @-@ 111Cs and one of the 15 F @-@ 111Gs were destroyed in accidents during their service with the RAAF . These accidents took the lives of 10 air crew . The accidents occurred from 1977 to 1999 . 
 In mid @-@ 2006 , an RAAF F @-@ 111 was chosen to scuttle the North Korean ship Pong Su which had been involved in one of Australia 's largest drug hauls in recorded history . The ship had been sitting in Snails Bay , off Birchgrove , while the government considered its fate , and it was decided in March 2006 it would be scuttled by air attack . The Pong Su was sunk on 23 March 2006 by two GBU @-@ 10 Paveway II laser @-@ guided bombs . 
 = = = Retirement = = = 
 In 2007 , Australia decided to retire all of its RAAF F @-@ 111s . The drawdown of the RAAF 's F @-@ 111 fleet began with the retirement of the F @-@ 111G models operated by No. 6 Squadron in late 2007 . One of the reasons given for the F @-@ 111s ' retirement was that they required an average of 180 hours maintenance for every flight hour . In March 2008 , after a review , the new Labor government confirmed its purchase of the 24 F / A @-@ 18F Super Hornets as an " interim " measure until the delivery of the F @-@ 35s ; in 2010 , the government signed the acquisition contract . The final RAAF F @-@ 111 aircrew conversion took place in 2009 , with four pilots and two Air Combat Officers ( <unk> ) qualifying . The RAAF retired its last F @-@ 111s on 3 December 2010 , after the final flight by aircraft from No. 6 Squadron over southern Queensland . 
 Australia is currently a partner in the development of the Lockheed Martin F @-@ 35 Lightning II stealth fighter , with plans for the country to procure up to 100 examples to replace the F @-@ 111 as well as the F / A @-@ 18 Hornet . 
 Between 21 and 24 November 2011 , 23 of the RAAF 's F @-@ 111C and F @-@ 111Gs which had not been selected for preservation were buried at the <unk> landfill site outside of Ipswich , Queensland . The RAAF had considered scrapping these aircraft , but concluded that it would be cheaper to bury them . The remaining ex @-@ RAAF F @-@ 111s will be placed on display .

 The F @-@ 111C was the export version for Australia , combining the F @-@ 111A design with the longer F @-@ 111B wings and the strengthened FB @-@ 111A undercarriage . 
 = = = RF @-@ 111C = = = 
 Four F @-@ 111C aircraft were modified to RF @-@ 111C reconnaissance configuration . These aircraft met the RAAF 's requirement for aircraft to reinstate its photographic reconnaissance capacity . While the original order for F @-@ 111s specified that 18 would be strike variants and six reconnaissance variants , the RAAF later agreed to accept all 24 as strike aircraft and later retrofit six with reconnaissance pallets . In 1971 the USAF dropped plans to fit some of its F @-@ 111s as reconnaissance aircraft , but sold the design of the reconnaissance pallet to Australia for $ 3 million . At this time the RAAF decided to fit the pallet to four rather than six aircraft . The reconnaissance pallet contains four cameras and an infrared <unk> unit and is fitted in the F @-@ 111 's weapons bay . The RF @-@ 111Cs retained their strike capability . 
 The first F @-@ 111C , A8 @-@ 126 selected for conversion to the RF @-@ 111C variant was modified at General Dynamics plant at Fort Worth , Texas between October 1978 and 18 April 1979 . After four months of test flights , the aircraft returned to Australia in August 1979 where it conducted further tropical weather trials at Darwin . The other three aircraft were modified by the RAAF 's No. 3 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Base Amberley in 1980 , using kits purchased from General Dynamics . The RF @-@ 111C variant proved to be highly successful , and was considered to be among the best tactical reconnaissance aircraft in the world . Three of the four RF @-@ 111Cs remained in RAAF service until 2010 . The other aircraft was retired in 2006 after suffering damage from landing on its belly after one of its main wheels separated during take off ; although the aircraft was repairable it was judged not worthwhile doing so due to the impending retirement of the entire F @-@ 111 fleet . The RAAF does not have an aircraft with the RF @-@ 111C 's intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities since they were retired .

 = Operation Badr ( 1973 ) = 
 Operation Badr ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> ; <unk> Badr ) or Plan Badr ( <unk> <unk> ; <unk> Badr ) was the code name for the Egyptian military operation to cross the Suez Canal and seize the Bar @-@ Lev Line of Israeli fortifications on October 6 , 1973 . Launched in conjunction with a Syrian assault on the Golan Heights , this attack marked the start of the Yom Kippur War . 
 Operation Badr was preceded by training exercises starting in 1968 , operational planning from 1971 onwards and a deception operation . In the opening stages of the attack , known as The Crossing ( <unk> ; al- ' <unk> ) , combat engineers used water cannons to rapidly clear numerous passages through the sand wall lining the east bank of the canal , laid bridges and operated ferries , allowing armor to cross . Egyptian infantry assaulted the Bar @-@ Lev fortifications and were counterattacked by Israeli armor and infantry . 
 The attack surprised the Israelis , and by October 7 the crossing was complete , and the east bank of the canal was occupied by five Egyptian infantry divisions . The infantry proceeded to establish defensive positions in bridgeheads spanning the 160 kilometres ( 99 mi ) front . Following a lull in the fighting on October 7 , Israeli armor reserves arrived at the front and launched a counterattack opposite the city of Ismailia . The Egyptian forces were successful in employing anti @-@ tank weapons to repel the Israeli armor and advanced once more . By the end of October 8 , Egypt occupied a strip of territory along the entire east bank of the canal to a depth of approximately 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) . 
 In addition to the canal crossing , Egypt laid a successful naval blockade against Israel in the Red Sea and Mediterranean Sea . The 1973 war is commemorated in a special Egyptian museum , the 6th of October Panorama in Cairo and in Damascus . 
 = = Prelude : 1967 – 1970 = = 
 At the end of the Six Day War , Israel held the entire Sinai peninsula , with the exception of Port Fouad . Israel 's victory in the Six Day War brought about a sense of security within Israel ; the occupied territory added strategic depth to the country 's defense . Consequently , Israel and Egypt ignored United Nations Security Council Resolution ( UNSCR ) 242 , which called for withdrawal from occupied territories in return for Arab recognition , and negotiations between the countries ceased . Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir aimed to maintain the status quo and believed that her country 's military strength would secure peace with Arab nations on their terms . Egypt , on the other hand , refused to recognize Israel or even negotiate with directly , preferring talks via third parties . 
 The 1967 war severely depleted Egypt 's military strength , as most of their air force and a large quantity of equipment was destroyed . Soviet assistance helped the Egyptian military to start the rebuilding of their armed forces shortly after the war , and by September 1968 Egyptian ground forces sufficiently recovered to challenge the Israeli presence east of the Suez canal . The War of Attrition began with Egyptian artillery barrages and commando raids into the Sinai , which were countered by deep @-@ striking Israeli airstrikes and <unk> @-@ borne raids into Egypt . Egypt 's inability to challenge Israeli air superiority led to the deployment of Soviet @-@ operated air @-@ defense assets to protect parts of Egypt 's interior , deterring the Israelis from launching their deep penetration raids and allowing the Egyptians to rebuild their air defenses . The defensive upgrades incurred increasing Israeli air losses , leading to an August 1970 ceasefire that lasted until 1973 . Nasser died in September 1970 and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat . 
 = = Egyptian strategy = = 
 President Sadat believed that Egypt 's economic , political , social and military problems were a result of the Six Day War . He believed the solution to these problems lay with erasing the humiliation of the 1967 defeat , which required regaining the Sinai . In 1971 Sadat began the coordinated political and military groundwork to achieve this . In February , he proposed a phased Israel withdrawal from the Sinai , which would involve a reopening of the Suez Canal , and Israeli fulfillment of the UNSCR 242 , including resolving the Palestinian refugee problem . In return Egypt would sign a peace treaty with Israel and reestablish relations with the United States . However Israeli insistence on retention of territory necessary for its security ended diplomatic efforts . 
 Simultaneously , Sadat sought to improve Egypt 's military capabilities , and in March began the first of four trips to the Soviet Union to obtain arms and munitions to cover those expended in the War of Attrition . He publicly stated his desire to go to war and marked 1971 the " year of decision " . However , the Soviets failed to deliver the promised supplies , and Sadat ruled out an offensive that year . As 1971 drew to a close , Sadat 's threats were dismissed as hollow Arab rhetoric . Added to their already weak political position , Arab leaders reached a consensus in 1972 that a diplomatic solution to the conflict was hopeless . American mediation steadily declined , ceasing entirely by mid @-@ 1973 . 
 By 1972 the United States and the Soviet Union were focused on détente . The Arabs were worried , as it meant their military situation vis @-@ à @-@ vis Israel would remain at a disadvantage . Believing diplomatic avenues had reached a dead end , Sadat focused on taking decisive military action . A renewed conflict with Israel would disrupt Soviet @-@ American détente , force superpower intervention and make the solution of the Arab @-@ Israeli conflict a center @-@ stage issue to Israel , the US and the USSR . 
 A number of Egyptian commanders wanted to carry out a general war to regain at least a significant part of the Sinai . This view was notably held by the Minister of War , General Mohammed Ahmed Sadek . However , in January 1972 Sadek acknowledged that Egypt 's Armed Forces were not ready for a land reclamation war before some five to ten years . Sadek cited studies in opposition of a limited offensive ; Egyptian analyses estimated 17 @,@ 000 casualties in a canal crossing , while Soviet estimates placed casualty figures at 35 @,@ 000 troops . Sadek stressed the immense losses that would be sustained would overshadow any military and political gains from a limited offensive , which required following up by liberating all or most of the Sinai . 
 For political reasons , Sadat dismissed Sadek 's arguments . The government 's political position was perilous as the Egyptian public , angered by the " No War , No Peace " situation with Israel , demanded action . The economy , already suffering from the loss of the Suez Canal revenues and the Sinai oil fields , could not cope with the country being on a war footing for an extended period . War was a desperate option , and a limited offensive under the current circumstances was the only solution . 
 At a session of the Arab League 's Joint Defence Council on January 27 – 30 , 1973 , Egypt presented a report stressing that an attack against Israel would have to be carried out simultaneously from Egypt , Syria and Jordan because of the Israeli air superiority . According to the report , Egypt and Syria 's air forces , if reinforced with 16 air squadrons from other Arab countries would achieve numerical superiority . However , the Israelis offset this by superior training , avionics , aircraft payload and weaponry . A simultaneous Arab attack could dilute the effectiveness of the Israeli Air Force ( IAF ) , and would force Israeli ground forces to fight a two @-@ front war . 
 During that month , Syrian President Hafez al @-@ Assad indicated his intentions of going to war against Israel . Egypt and Syria agreed to coordinate military action via negotiations , and the respective Ministers of War formulated a common military strategy . Egypt enlisted the political support of several more Arab countries , some producers of oil . Sadat discussed the possibility of using oil as an economic weapon to pressure Western governments into adopting more pro @-@ Arab policies . During the war , oil @-@ producing Arab nations , primarily Libya and Saudi Arabia , initiated an oil embargo , and several sent token forces to the front lines . 
 Sadat bred caution into his commanders , even warning his later Minister of War , Ahmed Ismail Ali , " not to lose the army as had happened in 1967 . " On 3 June 1971 he outlined his vision of a limited war : 
 I want us to plan [ the offensive ] within our capabilities , nothing more . Cross the canal and hold even ten centimeters of the Sinai . I 'm exaggerating , of course , but that will help me greatly and alter completely the political situation internationally and within Arab ranks . 
 Sadat 's strategy was designed to achieve political success without needing a comprehensive military victory , and hence , and in view of the Egyptian military 's marked inferiority to the Israeli Defense Forces , this required only a limited war . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Planning and Preparations = = = 
 Major General Mohammed Fawzi , who was Sadek 's predecessor as defense minister , regularly held command simulations . These exercises had unrealistic objectives and operational aims that were considerably outside the capabilities of the Egyptian military . When Lieutenant General Saad El Shazly became Chief of Staff on 16 May 1971 , no offensive plans yet existed . Rather , there was a defensive plan code named Operation 200 , and a more aggressive alternative named Operation Granite . Although Granite incorporated raids and assaults into the Sinai , it was essentially defensive . In his assessment of the military 's capabilities , he concluded the air force was the weakest arm . It was outmatched by its Israeli counterpart in various aspects , and Israeli pilots were also more experienced . A pivotal equipment advantage for the IAF was the F @-@ 4 Phantom II , a third generation fighter / bomber . By the outbreak of the war in October 1973 , the IDF had 122 F @-@ 4E and 6 RF @-@ 4Es ( R denotes the reconnaissance variant ) in service . 
 To compensate for the weaknesses of Egyptian air power , the Egyptians developed their air defenses . They fielded immobile SA @-@ 2 and SA @-@ 3 SAMs , the backbone of the air defenses , as well as mobile SA @-@ 6 SAMs and ZSU @-@ 23 @-@ 4 <unk> ( Self Propelled Anti @-@ Air Gun ) , portable infantry SA @-@ 7s , in addition to thousands of conventional anti @-@ air artillery . These air defenses would provide a protective " umbrella " over Egyptian ground forces . However , the SA @-@ 2 and SA @-@ 3 systems , being immobile , could only be moved over a nine @-@ hour period at best , exposing the air defenses to degradation in case of a redeployment to keep up with advancing forces . On the other hand , the SA @-@ 6 systems were available in limited numbers insufficient to provide adequate protection to advancing armored forces . 
 Due to these restrictions , Shazly supported a limited war to retake only the east bank of the canal , as opposed to Sadek . However , Sadek authorized the planning of two offensive plans , starting in July 1971 . The first was Operation 41 , which involved an offensive along the entire Suez Canal with the objective of seizing the key passes of the Sinai . The plan was developed in cooperation with Soviet advisers . As it was , the objectives of the operation were outside the capabilities of the Egyptian military and Shazly saw it only as a means of inducing the Soviets to supply more arms and equipment . The plan would also encourage the Syrians to join in an attack against Israel . Operation 41 was completed by September 1971 , and the following month , Sadat and Sadek flew to Moscow to conclude Egypt 's largest arms deal yet , receiving 100 MiG @-@ 21 fighters , 10 Tu @-@ 16 bombers , SA @-@ 6 anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) missiles and heavy artillery . Operation 41 was renamed Granite Two . 
 The second plan — codenamed the " High Minarets " — called for a crossing at five separate areas along the length of the canal . The Egyptians would advance 10 – 15 kilometers ( 6 @.@ 2 – 9 @.@ 3 mi ) , then establish defensive positions . By restricting their advance , Egyptian ground forces would remain within range of their own SAM defences , which would provide a protective " umbrella " , negating the Israeli advantage in the air . In this way the High Minarets was planned in accordance with the capabilities of the Egyptian Army . The plan 's outline was completed by September 1971 in absolute secrecy . 
 As Sadek continued to refuse the concept of a limited war , tensions rose between him and Sadat . Following a heated meeting of senior commanders , the Minister of War was sacked . His replacement , Major General Ahmed Ismail , was in favor of a limited offensive . The High Minarets continued to be developed as the only viable offensive plan , with the spring of 1973 being a possible launch date . Based on intelligence estimates , the main Israeli counterattacks would take place 6 – 8 hours after the assault began by three armored divisions , while armored support for the crossing would not be available before at least 12 hours . To deal with this , Egyptian infantry would be supplied with large numbers of anti @-@ tank guided missiles ( ATGM ) and rocket propelled grenades ( RPG ) . The portable anti @-@ tank weapons were principally the RPG @-@ 7 and the less numerous wire @-@ guided AT @-@ 3 Sagger , as well as hundreds of recoilless rifles and conventional weapons . The manually guided Sagger missile had a long range and a powerful warhead but suffered from low velocity in flight , allowing the target ( such as a tank ) time to take evasive maneuver or return fire . Its minimum range of 500 – 800 meters ( 1 @,@ 600 – 2 @,@ 600 ft ) created a significant area of dead ground , which was to be covered by the RPG , along with the B @-@ 10 and B @-@ 11 recoilless rifles . In addition , there were RPG @-@ 43 anti @-@ tank grenades . Assault infantry were equipped with night vision devices , infrared scopes , and welder 's goggles to counter a tactic often used by the Israelis ; mounting xenon floodlights on tanks and vehicles to blind enemy infantry at night . To allow the infantry to carry an assortment of heavy weaponry — <unk> , RPGs , flamethrowers , machine guns , and mines — before the bridges were laid , was achieved by two steps . Firstly , five different field kits were created that were lighter , accommodated larger water bottles and could carry 24 hours ' food supply . Each field kit was specifically designed to meet the needs of the various assault teams . The other solution was to use four @-@ wheel wooden carts to transport equipment , weaponry and ammunition . Over 2 @,@ 200 such carts would be used in the crossing , providing the capacity to transport nearly 330 tons ( 150 @,@ 000 lb ) of matériel . Rope ladders with wooden steps would be deployed to lift ammunition and heavy equipment , such as the B @-@ 11 recoilless rifle , to the top of the sand wall . 
 The High Minarets called for assault infantry to establish bridgeheads 5 kilometers ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) deep and 8 kilometers ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) wide . The relatively short perimeter would increase fire density , and initially the attack would receive supporting fire from sand ramparts on the western bank . Once reinforcements and armor crossed , the bridgeheads would be deepened to 8 kilometers ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) . This had to be accomplished within 18 hours of the start of the operation . Airborne and seaborne forces would conduct attacks and ambushes to delay Israeli reserves heading for the Bar Lev line . 
 The spring of 1973 passed with no offensive being launched . On 21 August of that year , in complete secrecy , six senior Syrian commanders , using false names and passports , arrived from Latakia at Alexandria harbor in a Soviet passenger liner carrying holiday makers . Among the Syrian commanders were , principally , the Minister of Defense General Mustafa Tlass and the Chief of Staff General Yusuf <unk> . For the next two days , they convened with their Egyptian counterparts at Egyptian Naval Headquarters in Ras el Tin Palace . By August 23 , two documents were ratified by Shazly and <unk> concluding that the Egyptian and Syrian armed forces were ready for war . All that remained was to choose a date ; either September 7 – 11 or October 5 – 10 . The date was to be chosen jointly by Presidents Sadat and Hafez al @-@ Assad , and they were required to communicate their decision to their commanders fifteen days before the date of attack . 
 When 27 August , fifteen days before 7 September , passed without a reply from either Sadat or Assad , it was clear no offensive would take place in September . During 28 and 29 August , Sadat met with Assad in Damascus , where they agreed to start the war in October . They specified October 6 as D @-@ Day , and informed Ahmed Ismail and Tlass on 22 September , who in turn relayed the decision to the Chiefs of Staff . At the request of Ahmed Ismail , Sadat produced a presidential directive for war . Therefore , it was only in September , less than a month before the attack , that the date October 6 was finally selected as D @-@ Day . The coordinated offensive would begin at 14 : 00 ( Cairo Local Time ) . October 6 was chosen for several reasons . The speed of the water current and the tide were optimal for a crossing operation , and for most of the night there was a full moon , facilitating bridge construction . The date coincided with Yom Kippur , the Jewish Day of Atonement . This was an important factor in choosing October 6 for an attack ; Jews fast on that day , abstain from the use of fire or electricity ( which meant transportation would be at a standstill ) , and much of the Israeli army would be demobilised . October also coincided with the month of Ramadan in the Muslim Calendar , which meant that Muslim soldiers would be fasting . It was in Ramadan that the Muslims won their first victory at the Battle of Badr in the year 634 . Opting for something more inspirational than the High Minarets as a name , Operation Badr was chosen by Egyptian commanders as the codename for the assault . 
 = = = Combat engineering = = = 
 In any crossing of the Suez Canal by Egyptian forces , success was highly dependent on the performance of the Egyptian Corps of Engineers , which had several daunting tasks to accomplish . Israeli engineers had constructed a massive artificial sand barrier spanning 160 kilometers ( 99 mi ) of the canal 's east bank ( except for the Great Bitter Lake , where the width of the canal made a crossing unlikely ) . To prevent erosion , the sand barrier was supported by concrete , which was one meter ( 3 ⅓ ft ) above the water at high tide , and three meters ( 10 ft ) above water at low tide . The canal was 180 – 220 meters ( 590 – 720 ft ) wide and approximately 18 meters ( 59 ft ) deep . Engineers had to clear seventy passages through this sand wall , each seven meters ( 23 ft ) wide . This meant the removal of 1 @,@ 500 cubic meters ( 2 @,@ 000 cu yd ) of sand for each passage . Initially , conventional methods were tested for breaching the sand wall . It was found that , to clear a single passage required 60 men , 1 bulldozer , 600 lb of explosives and five to six hours , uninterrupted by enemy fire . Since the crossing sites would likely be congested and under enemy fire , these methods proved to be impractical and too costly . 
 The solution to this dilemma was simple but nonetheless ingenious . Late in 1971 , an Egyptian officer suggested the use of small , light , gasoline fueled pumps that could be ferried across the canal in inflatable rafts to blast through the sand barrier . The suggestion proved worthwhile , and the Egyptian Military ordered some 300 British @-@ made pumps . Tests showed that five of these pumps could remove 1 @,@ 500 cubic meters of sand in three hours . In 1972 another 150 more powerful German @-@ made pumps were purchased . A combination of three British @-@ made and two German @-@ made pumps made it possible to clear a passage in two hours . 
 Once the passages were cleared , engineers had to construct ten heavy bridges ( using MTU bridgelayers , TMM bridgelayers and pontoon bridges ) , five light bridges , ten pontoon bridges and 35 ferries . The passages had to be opened in five to seven hours , immediately followed by the ferries , then the bridges two hours later , all the while under enemy fire . Of the heavy bridges , the Egyptians had only two Soviet @-@ made <unk> heavy folding bridges , which could be erected in a shorter time than most other bridges in their inventory , saving a few critical hours . These bridges were also much easier to repair . The speed with which the engineers cleared the passages and laid the bridges and ferries would affect the course of the entire operation . Engineers also had to man the boats that would cross the assault infantry initially . Finally , they had to breach the minefields around Israeli defenses for the assault infantry . 
 = = = Israeli defences = = = 
 The Israelis had constructed a series of fortifications along the canal called the Bar Lev Line , which was considered impregnable . The main obstacle of these defences was a massive artificial sand wall erected by Israeli engineers , 18 – 25 meters ( 59 – 82 ft ) high with a 45 – 60 degree incline , along the entire Suez Canal . The rampart were reinforced by concrete that also prevented any attempt by amphibious vehicles to climb the sand wall . To blast through the sand barrier the Israelis estimated would take at least twenty @-@ four , probably forty @-@ eight hours . Behind this rampart were a series of 22 fortifications comprising 35 strongpoints . On average , the fortifications were 10 kilometers ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) apart . A strongpoint was several stories deep into the sand and provided protection from a 1000 @-@ pound ( ~ ½ ton ) bomb . <unk> incorporated trenches , barbed wire , minefields 200 meters deep , numerous bunkers and troop shelters , and firing positions for tanks . Each strongpoint had an underground reservoir filled with crude oil . The oil could be pumped into the Suez Canal via a pipe system , and ignited to create temperatures reaching 700 ° C ( 1 @,@ 292 ° F ) . A second defensive line , 300 – 500 meters ( 980 – 1 @,@ 640 ft ) behind the main line , was concentrated at likely crossing areas , and designed to be occupied by armored forces , incorporating tank firing positions . A third defensive line , 3 – 5 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 9 – 3 @.@ 1 mi ) behind the Bar Lev Line ( the defenses on the canal ) , had its defences concentrated on the main roads and principal routes of advance for an attacker . Behind the main line on the canal were concentration areas for armor and infantry , supply depots , numerous artillery positions and so forth . 
 The Israeli command developed a basic defensive plan codenamed Dovecote ( <unk> <unk> ) , the details of which were known to the Egyptians . The plan divided the Bar Lev Line into three sectors : the northern sector defended Arish on the coast to El @-@ Qantarah el @-@ <unk> , the central sector defended Ismailia to Abu @-@ <unk> , and the southern sector defended the area from the Great Bitter Lake to the end of the Suez Canal , and prevented a thrust to the <unk> and Gedy Passes . The 252nd Armored Division , led by Major General Albert Mandler , was charged with the defense of the Bar Lev Line , and incorporated three armored brigades . Positioned 5 – 9 kilometers ( 3 @.@ 1 – 5 @.@ 6 mi ) behind the series of fortifications was a brigade of 110 – 120 tanks , led by Colonel Reshef , split into three battalions of 36 – 40 tanks each , with one battalion to a sector . In case of an Egyptian attack , the brigade was to move forward to occupy tank platforms and firing positions along the Bar Lev Line . A further 20 – 35 kilometers ( 12 – 22 mi ) behind the canal were two additional armored brigades led by Colonels Gabi Amir and Dan <unk> , each with around 120 tanks . One brigade was to reinforce the forward armored brigade , while the other brigade counterattacked against the main Egyptian assault . 
 The Sinai garrison numbered 18 @,@ 000 men . The overall commander was Shmuel Gonen , who served as head of the Israeli Southern Command . Of the garrison stationed in the Sinai , one infantry brigade occupied the strongpoints on the canal on October 6 , while a further 8 @,@ 000 could be deployed to the line within 30 minutes to two hours along with the armor . 
 = = = Deception and final days to war = = = 
 Positioning the Second and Third Armies with their bridging equipment along the canal in preparation for Operation Badr would put the Israelis on high alert . Without the element of surprise Egyptian forces would suffer high losses in the attack ( estimates for casualties already ran in the thousands ) . The Directorate of Military Intelligence ( abbreviated Aman ) , which formulated Israel 's intelligence estimate and was known for its competency , was tasked with detecting troop movements and activity along Egyptian and Syrian forces ; military activity which would be particularly intensive in the last days preceding the assault . 
 The deception plan mounted by the Egyptians , which included their intelligence services , relied on producing a series of events and incidents , militarily and politically , internationally and nationally , aimed at convincing Israeli intelligence analysts that the Arab world was not preparing for war . Among the plan 's requirements was that senior echelon commanders preserve superficial normality while working secretly on the final preparations for the offensive . 
 The core of the Egyptian deception plan was based on the prevalent Israeli mentality following their lightning @-@ quick victory over Arab forces in the 1967 Six Day War . This mentality is clearly illustrated in the following Israeli saying : 
 In his thesis of the Yom Kippur War , USMC Major Michael C. Jordan explains that this quote and the prevailing opinion it represented pre @-@ October 1973 : 
 ... also reflects the contempt Israelis held for the military abilities of Arab neighbors Egypt and Syria . The 1967 preemptive victory was so complete and won so cheaply , Israelis viewed their military forces as invincible , their intelligence service as unmatched , and their Arab foes as inferior and incapable . 
 The Israelis expected a forty @-@ eight @-@ hour warning beforehand from their intelligence services . At any rate , they were confident that any Arab attack would be swiftly decimated by the IAF . 
 The Egyptians sought to exploit this Israeli belief to their advantage . Ever since assuming office , Sadat had continually threatened Israel with war , engaging in brinkmanship , until his threats became ignored by Israel and the world . In order to position their forces for the attack against Israel , the Egyptians announced an exercise by the canal . Exercises had been conducted numerous times before , and in May and August 1973 false alarms had caused the Israeli army to mobilise in response to these exercises , costing Israel some $ 10 million on each occasion . This time , when the Egyptians began exercises on October 1 to last until October 7 , Aman disregarded the heightened military activity as training maneuvers . Troop movements on the Syrian front were detected as well , but Aman concluded that the Syrians would not go to war without the Egyptians . 
 The pretext of exercises allowed the Egyptians to conceal their preparations . These were further facilitated by the fact that the Egyptian Second and Third Field Armies were normally stationed along the Suez Canal for defence . Troops , armor , and crucially , the bridging equipment , were moved to their concentration areas over a period of fifteen nights up to the night of October 5 / 6 , with a peak of activity during the final five nights . 
 Ever since it occupied the Sinai in 1967 , Israel had openly declared it would remain in Sharm el @-@ Sheikh to ensure the sea lanes to the port of Eilat through the Straits of Tiran remained opened ( the closing of the Straits to Israeli shipping in 1967 was one of the causes of the Six Day War ) . Egypt aimed to nullify Sharm el @-@ Sheikh 's importance to Israel by imposing a naval blockade at the straits of Bab @-@ el @-@ Mandeb , almost 2 @,@ 500 kilometers ( 1 @,@ 600 mi ) from Israel . To this end , arrangements were made with Pakistan to receive Egyptian vessels for repair early in 1973 . Approval was sought , and obtained , from Sudan and Yemen to receive the submarines on their way to Pakistan in Port Sudan and Aden as a friendly visit . Pakistan 's approval to receive Egyptian vessels for repairs were made public . On 1 October , a force containing several submarines , destroyers and missile boats set sail on a route planned to ensure their arrival at Bab @-@ el @-@ Mandeb on October 6 . The fleet was fully equipped for combat , and the force was ordered to maintain complete radio silence ; which meant there was no way of recalling the submarines . The commanding officers , unaware of their real mission , were issued sealed envelopes detailing their orders and mission , and were instructed to open the envelopes on 6 October , only a few hours before the war was to begin , whereupon they would break their radio silence . Once the fleet had set sail that day , 1 October , " the war had effectively begun " . 
 The military sought to maintain an impression of normality . Just before Ramadan was to begin on 26 September , the Ministry of War publicly announced that military personnel could register to take leave to perform a Umrah ( pilgrimage ) in Mecca . Egyptian newspapers announced that sailboat races would be held , participants of which included several high @-@ ranking officers of the Egyptian Navy . In addition , a visit planned for October 8 ( two days after the scheduled attack ) by the Romanian Minister of Defense to Egypt was also publicized by the Ministry of War , and a program for his visit was announced . This coincidental visit would be promptly canceled once war broke out on 6 October , but it proved useful as part of the deception plan . 
 On 27 September , a large batch of reservists were given orders for mobilization . To lull suspicion , the Cabinet Ministers of the Egyptian Government were invited to an open tour of General Headquarters , where all planning and coordination of the operation took place . Another batch of reservists were called up on September 30 . To quell suspicion once more , the Egyptians publicly announced on 4 October the demobilization of the reservists who had been called up on 27 September , but only demobilized 20 @,@ 000 men . 
 From 1 October onwards , the order for war began to spread outside the circle of senior commanders in Egypt . Generals Saad <unk> and Abdel Munim <unk> , commanders of the Second and Third Field Armies respectively , were informed of the decision to implement Operation Badr . On 3 October , they informed their divisional commanders . Brigade commanders were told on 4 October , battalion and company commanders on 5 October , while platoon commanders and troops were told on 6 October , six hours before the start of the attack . 
 Sadat also played his role the deception plan ; in September he had attended the Non @-@ Aligned conference in Algeria , and upon his return was rumored to be ill . Sadat remained , for several days leading up to 6 October , out of public sight . Egyptian intelligence planted false stories of his illness in the press and initiated a search for a home in Europe , where Sadat would receive treatment , adding to the rumor 's credibility . 
 Implementing the deception operation did not go through entirely without incident . Initially the Soviets were kept in the dark about Egyptian intentions to go to war . Instead , on October 2 , they were told that an Israeli raid was expected . Over the next two days the director of the Defense Intelligence Service , General Fouad Nassar , informed the Chief Soviet Liaison Officer , General <unk> , that the raid was expected to be a large @-@ scale attack , coupled with an air strike . Though <unk> appeared at first to believe Nassar 's story , it became clear to the Egyptians that the Soviets were suspicious . In particular Soviet advisors serving with Egyptian and Syrian units were by October 3 reporting the unusually heightened activities of the Egyptian and Syrian forces . Both Sadat and Assad decided to inform the Soviets of their intention to go to war on October 3 . Promptly , the Soviets requested permission to evacuate their personnel in Egypt , and both leaders reluctantly agreed . Egyptian commanders were taken completely by surprise , when , beginning late evening on October 4 , Soviet experts serving with field units , embassy personnel and their families were hurriedly evacuated . By October 5 , the evacuation was complete . This incident would be an important factor in convincing the Israelis that war was likely . 
 October 4 also provided another worrying incident to Egyptian commanders , who became aware that evening that EgyptAir , the country 's national airline , had canceled all its flights and was arranging the protection of its civil air fleet by dispersing its aircraft to refuges outside Egypt . The orders came from the Minister of Aviation , Ahmed <unk> . General Headquarters quickly intervened to reverse the dispersal orders , and by October 5 flights were back to their normal schedule . It was believed the incident was a breach of security and a leak on Egyptian plans for war . It was not clear to Egyptian commanders however , whether the Israelis were aware of the incident . 
 On September 13 , 1973 , an air battle took place between Syrian and Israeli fighters . It was an alarming skirmish in which twelve Syrian aircraft were shot down while the Israelis lost only one fighter . Tension ran high between both countries . The Egyptians in particular were very concerned ; on April 7 , 1967 , an air battle between Syria and Israel had escalated the military situation and was one of the causes of the Six Day War . Aware that war was to be launched only days later , the Syrians chose not to retaliate . The air battle aided the Syrians in concentrating their forces for the war , as the Israelis interpreted it to be a defensive reaction on the part of the Syrians . The Israelis closely monitored this buildup near the front , but their intelligence remained adamant that Syria would not go to war without Egypt , which the Israelis believed was currently occupied with internal issues . 
 Throughout September 1973 , Aman had received eleven warnings , including a warning from Jordan 's King Hussein , that Egypt and Syria were bent on waging war , but they were all disregarded , as Aman maintained the belief that the Arabs would not launch an attack . Mossad director Zvi Zamir remained of the opinion that war was not an Arab option . 
 However , there remained too many signs for the Israelis to ignore , chief among which was the hasty Soviet evacuation from Cairo and Damascus , and the constant buildup of forces on the Syrian front when Egypt , it was assumed , would not enter war . Though the Chief of Staff , David Elazar , was assured that the probability of war remained low , he took precautionary steps on October 5 . Elazar placed the entire military on alert , canceled all leaves , and ordered the Air Force to assume a full @-@ alert posture . He also ordered the 7th Armored Brigade to relocate from the Sinai to the Golan Heights . This raised Israeli numbers in the Golan Heights to 177 tanks and 44 artillery pieces on October 6 . To replace the 7th Armored Brigade , the Armor School , under the command of Colonel Gabi Amir , was ordered to activate its tank brigade for immediate airlift ; it was in the Sinai by October 6 , before the war began . Ultimately though , no orders for mobilization were issued to reservists ; Elazar and other senior commanders still expected a 24- to 48 @-@ hour warning from the intelligence services if the Arab nations were bent on war . 
 During the night of October 5 / 6 , Zvi Zamir went to Europe to meet personally with Ashraf Marwan , an Egyptian double agent . Marwan informed Zamir that a joint Egyptian @-@ Syrian attack was imminent . Combined with other warnings and incidents , Marwan 's warning finally convinced Zvi Zamir of the imminence of war . Eli <unk> , the director of Aman , sent a definite warning of war to the Israeli leadership at 04 : 30 on October 6 . Aman erred when it concluded the Arabs were to attack at 18 : 00 , an estimation in fact four hours late . Israel 's Prime Minister Golda Meir met with Defence Minister Moshe Dayan and General David Elazar at 08 : 05 for over an hour . Meir asked both men to present their views , which were conflicting : Dayan continued to believe war was not a certainty , while Elazar believed otherwise , arguing for a preemptive air strike against Syria . Dayan also proposed a partial mobilization of reserves , while Elazar favored a mobilization of the entire Air Force , and four armored divisions , totaling around 100 @,@ 000 – 120 @,@ 000 troops . Meir concluded the meeting by stating that no preemptive strike would be launched , in order to ensure the backing of the United States , but she sided with Elazar on the issue of mobilization , and orders were issued to reservists to mobilize . 
 Aman delivered its warning to Israeli commanders just nine and a half hours before the outbreak of hostilities , falling considerably short of the expected 24 – 48 hours warning period . The Arabs had won the intelligence war , achieving full surprise and gaining the initiative on the battlefield . 
 = = Course of the Operation = = 
 = = = October 6 – The Crossing = = = 
 Badr began at 14 : 00 on October 6 , 1973 . As the Israelis expected the attack to begin four hours later , only part of the troops and none of the armor assigned to man the Bar Lev Line were in position , except for a few platoons in the northernmost forts . Sixteen fortifications on the line were fully manned , and another two were partially manned . 
 The operation began with a major air strike involving more than 200 aircraft against three airbases , Hawk SAM batteries , three command centers , artillery positions and several radar stations , employing MiG @-@ 21s , MiG @-@ 17s , and Su @-@ 7s . This was in concert with artillery strikes starting at 14 : 05 from nearly 2 @,@ 000 pieces against the Bar @-@ Lev line , and against armor concentration areas and artillery positions , using field guns , howitzers , mortars , tank guns , B @-@ 10 and B @-@ 11 recoilless rifles . The self @-@ propelled 152 mm howitzers and 130 mm field guns were assigned counter @-@ battery fire missions against Israeli artillery . The 53 @-@ minute long fire preparation , one of the largest in history , was divided into four barrages . The first , fifteen minutes long , was aimed at enemy targets on the eastern bank up to a depth of 1 @.@ 5 kilometers . An estimated 10 @,@ 500 shells were fired against Israeli targets in the first minute alone . 
 With the start of the fire preparation , tank hunting detachments — groups of ten equipped with RPG @-@ 7 rockets , RPG @-@ 43 grenades , and AT @-@ 3 Sagger missiles — crossed the canal to deploy one kilometer deep , quickly occupying the tank ramparts , and proceeded to set up ambushes and lay mines . When the first barrage ended , Egyptian artillery began a second , 22 minute @-@ long barrage , against targets at a depth of 1 @.@ 5 – 3 kilometers . At this time , 14 : 20 , the first wave of assault infantry , 4 @,@ 000 men , began crossing the canal , crying " Allahu Akbar ... Allahu Akbar ... " ( God is Great ) . Around 2 @,@ 500 dinghies and wooden boats were used to transport the troops . Smoke canisters were used at the crossing points to provide cover . During the night of October 5 , engineers had blocked the underwater pipes on the opposite bank , preventing the Israelis from releasing flammable oil into the canal and igniting it . The first wave was lightly equipped , armed with RPG @-@ 7s , Strela 2 AA missiles and rope ladders to deploy on the sand wall . Among the first wave were combat engineers and several units of Sa 'iqa ( lit. lightening ; these were commando forces ) , who were tasked with setting up ambushes on reinforcement routes . The Sa 'iqa attacked command posts and artillery batteries in order to deny the Israelis control over their forces , while the engineers breached the minefields and barbed wire surrounding Israeli defenses . Immediately following them , military engineers transported the water pumps to the opposite bank and began setting them up . At this time Egyptian aircraft involved in the air strike began returning . Five aircraft were lost , although by the end of the day this rose to ten . The air strike put the Bir <unk> and Bir <unk> air bases out of operation for 48 hours , and damaged the Ras <unk> and Bir <unk> airbases . Around ten <unk> batteries , at least two <unk> artillery batteries , an electronic jamming center at Umm <unk> , and various radar stations were destroyed . This allowed the Egyptian Air Force to operate for the rest of the war without any ground @-@ based communications interference , as the only other jamming center in the Sinai was located at el @-@ Arish , considerably behind the front . Over a dozen AS @-@ 5 Kelt missiles were fired from Tu @-@ 16 bombers as well . Several were shot down , but at least five hit their targets , including two missiles fitted with anti @-@ radiation seekers that knocked out Israeli radars . The success of the air strike caused the Egyptians to cancel a planned second air strike . Another account however states that 18 Egyptian aircraft were lost , and these losses prompted the canceling of a second wave of airstrikes . 
 At the Great Bitter Lake , the Egyptian 130th Amphibious Brigade performed its own crossing . Composed of the 602nd and 603rd Mechanized Infantry Battalions with 1 @,@ 000 men , including a Sagger anti @-@ tank battalion , an anti @-@ air battalion , 20 PT @-@ 76 tanks and 100 amphibious armored personnel carriers , it was tasked with seeking and destroying enemy installations at the entrances of the Gedy and <unk> Passes . The sand rampart that lined the entire Suez Canal did not exist in the Bitter Lakes , and there were no Israeli defences or units to be encountered , and the brigade reached the opposite bank around 14 : 40 without any losses . The Egyptians discovered a minefield blocking their advance , and military engineers worked to clear a path . 
 Subsequently , at around 16 : 00 , the 603rd was regrouping outside the minefield when it was attacked by a company of tanks from Kibrit East ( codenamed <unk> by the Israelis ) , a fortification of the Bar Lev located on the Bitter Lake . The battalion had been reinforced with a tank hunting detachment from the 7th Division , and managed to destroy two tanks and three armored vehicles before the Israelis withdrew . Afterwards , its original assignment was canceled and it was ordered to capture the Kibrit East position ( Fort <unk> ) . It occupied the abandoned position on October 9 which the battalion — despite being cut off and coming under numerous attacks — held for the remainder of the war . As for the 602nd battalion , it began to move eastwards some time after dusk , and stumbled upon an Israeli battalion of 35 tanks along Artillery Road , some 15 kilometers ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) from the Bitter Lake . The battalion 's ten PT @-@ 76s with 76 mm guns were outmatched and outnumbered by the heavier Israeli M48 Pattons with 105 mm guns . The manually guided Saggers were difficult to operate at night , and Israeli tanks were employing blinding xenon floodlights . Caught in the open Sinai desert , the 602nd was defeated and lost many of its tanks and armored vehicles , along with significant casualties . The remaining troops retreated to Third Army lines . Some units may have reached their objectives , although this is disputed . 
 Egyptian troops raised their national flag on the eastern bank of the canal at 14 : 35 . By that time company and battalion @-@ size units of Israeli tanks and infantry began reaching the Bar Lev Line , but were prevented from reaching their positions by Egyptian ambushes . Those tanks that broke through came under fire from the west bank ramparts . At 14 : 45 , a second wave of infantry landed on the opposite bank . Subsequent waves of infantry arrived at fifteen @-@ minute intervals . However , after the fourth wave , fatigue and technical problems with the boats gradually widened the time intervals . The Egyptians abandoned their schedules , giving priority to anti @-@ tank teams and weaponry that could critically affect the battle . Amphibious vehicles were also used to cross equipment . The wooden carts were ferried to the east bank via boats , where they were initially lifted to the top of the sand wall with their loads . However , this method proved clumsy , and the carts were first emptied then lifted , after which they were re @-@ loaded and dragged to troops on the front line . The carts greatly facilitated the supply and transportation of matériel on the east bank . 
 Meanwhile , Israeli Southern Command attempted to pinpoint the main Egyptian effort to launch a counterattack with Dan <unk> 's reserve armored brigade , when , in fact , there was no main effort . As a result , Southern Command wasted several critical hours without taking decisive action . Tactical errors also showcased themselves when Reshef moved his tank brigade forward ; Israeli commanders neglected to conduct reconnaissance beforehand , causing their units to fall into Egyptian ambushes . In the confusion ensuing the surprise assault , no attempt was made at evacuating the Bar Lev garrison . 
 At 15 : 30 , Egyptian forces captured Fort Lahtzanit , the first fortification of the Bar Lev Line to fall , and by then the infantry had been reinforced with <unk> B @-@ 10 and <unk> B @-@ 11 rifles . At the same time , engineers began operating their water pumps against the sand wall , opening the first passage in less than an hour , and the Egyptians moved up their bridging units to the canal . By 16 : 30 eight waves had brought across the canal ten infantry brigades in all five bridgeheads , totaling 23 @,@ 500 men ( around 4 @,@ 700 at each bridgehead ) . Each bridgehead was on average six kilometers ( 3 ¾ mi ) wide and around two kilometers deep . The Egyptians had high @-@ velocity 85mm and 100mm rifled anti @-@ tank guns in action on the east bank by that time . 
 At 17 : 30 , three hours into the war , the twelfth and final infantry wave crossed , bringing the total in all five bridgeheads to 32 @,@ 000 men ( around 6 @,@ 400 in each bridgehead ) . By then Israeli armored losses had reached around 100 tanks . The magnitude of Israeli losses stemmed from their insistence to reach their comrades in the Bar Lev Line , and they repeatedly ran into aggressive ambushes by Egyptian soldiers . 
 Taking advantage of dusk , at 17 : 50 four Sa 'iqa battalions were airdropped deep into the Sinai by helicopters flying at low altitude . The Sa 'iqa were assigned the objective of hampering reserves en route from Israel . The helicopters left the range of friendly SAMs and were not assigned air cover , resulting in a number of them being shot down . 
 At 18 : 00 Egyptian armor and anti @-@ tank units on the west bank began moving to the crossing sites . Fifteen minutes later engineers completed the assembly of all 35 ferries and waited for the breaches to be opened . By 18 : 30 the bridgeheads were nearly five kilometers ( 3 mi ) deep . With Israeli artillery on the Bar Lev Line eliminated , the immobile SA @-@ 2 and SA @-@ 3 units were moved forward . From 22 : 30 to 01 : 30 after midnight , all bridges — eight heavy and four light — were laid , and along with the ferries , began transporting reinforcements to the opposite bank . In the far south of the canal , at 19th Division 's sector , the sand turned into mud making it difficult to clear . Consequently , four ferries and three bridges assigned to that division were deployed seven hours behind schedule . Periodically the bridges were relocated to confuse Israeli air strikes targeting them — the Egyptians had opened 60 passages but were operating only 12 bridges , allowing each bridge to be moved to one of five passages . Throughout the night and up to the following morning , tanks and vehicles kept crossing the canal . Military police were responsible for directing this enormous traffic , utilizing color @-@ coded signs . 
 = = = = Port Said Sector = = = = 
 The Port Said Sector was an independent military command in the Egyptian Military , unattached to the Second Army . It incorporated Port Said , Port Fouad and their vicinity . The sector contained two infantry brigades . Military operations in this area were directed against three fortifications : Budapest , Orkal and Lahtzanit . As with the rest of the front , the offensive here began with a fire preparation . However , high trajectory weapons were not employed because Egyptian aircraft were flying through the sector 's airspace , hence only direct fire guns were used to bombard Israeli positions . 
 Fort Lahtzanit , 19 kilometers ( 12 mi ) south of Port Fouad , was isolated by Egyptian infantry prior to the attack , preventing Israeli reinforcements from reaching it . At 15 : 00 , the Egyptians breached the minefield and barbed wire surrounding the fort , at which point approximately a company @-@ sized force of Egyptian troops assaulted the defenses . By 15 : 30 , the fort was declared under Egyptian control . The Egyptians proceeded to clear a few bunkers still occupied by Israeli soldiers , some of whom surrendered when they began facing flamethrowers . By 18 : 00 , the Egyptians had cleared the fort completely . ( see Battle of Fort Lahtzanit ) 
 Fort Orkal , 10 kilometers ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) south of Port Fouad , was also isolated prior to an attack . The Egyptians approached by land from Port Fouad , and across the Suez Canal . The attack quickly ground to a halt as the force approaching from the north failed to breach the minefield , leaving the force attacking across the canal pinned down at the sand wall by enemy fire . Subsequently , an infantry company crossed and renewed the attack from the south , seizing several positions . Reinforcements soon allowed more positions to be captured . On October 7 , the remaining defenders made a break @-@ out attempt to join friendly forces , but they were intercepted and either killed or captured . 
 Located on a narrow strip of land southeast of Port Fouad , Fort Budapest was surrounded by water on two sides . The fort came under air and artillery strikes at 14 : 00 . A Sa 'iqa company cut off the only route to the fort for reinforcements , while a battalion attacked from Port Fouad , advancing along a narrow strip of land bereft of natural cover . The battalion 's attack bogged down at the minefield , which was 600 meters ( 2 @,@ 000 ft ) deep . It soon came under air attacks , as the fort was outside of the SAM " umbrella " , and faced stiff resistance from the fort 's garrison . The battalion eventually broke off its attack and retreated , while the Sa 'iqa unit east of the fort prevented reinforcements from reaching the fort for four days before it too withdrew . Another attack on October 15 came close to succeeding but ultimately failed , and hence Fort Budapest became the only position of the Bar Lev Line to be remain in Israeli hands . ( see Battles of Fort Budapest ) 
 = = = = Naval actions = = = = 
 By October 6 the Egyptian naval task force was at Bab @-@ el @-@ Mandeb where they broke radio silence . When Operation Badr began at 14 : 00 , Rear Admiral Fuad Abu <unk> authorized the fleet to proceed with the blockade via a codeword . Egyptian submarines and destroyers intercepted ships traveling through Bab @-@ el @-@ Mandeb destined for Eilat , and all Israeli maritime navigation in the Red Sea ceased . The blockade was a strategic success for Egypt , while the Israeli Navy and Air Force were incapable of lifting the blockade due to the long distance between Israel and Bab @-@ el @-@ Mandeb . Mines were laid at the entrance to the Gulf of Suez to prevent Israel from transporting oil from the Sinai fields to Eilat . Historian Gammal Hammad claims that a blockade was also enforced in the Mediterranean , while other sources dispute this . News of the blockade was censored in Israel . 
 Aside from the blockade , the Egyptian Navy carried out several other missions . Coastal artillery at Port Said participated in the fire preparation by bombarding Fort Budapest and Fort Orkal , while coastal artillery at Suez hit targets opposite the Third Army . Missile boats bombarded <unk> and Ras <unk> on the Mediterranean , Ras Masala and Ras Sidr on the Gulf of Suez , and Sharm el Sheikh . Naval frogmen raided the oil installations at Bala <unk> , disabling the massive <unk> . 
 Several naval engagements took place between Egyptian and Israeli missile boats off the coast between Port Said and Damietta , including one on October 8 , when a flotilla of ten Israeli missile boats attempted to shell coastal targets along the Nile delta . Four Egyptian Osa class missile boats confronted six of them , leading to Battle of <unk> in which three of the Egyptian missile boats were sunk within forty minutes , with no Israeli casualties . Egypt claimed to have sunk four Israeli " targets " , three they believed to be motor torpedo boats and one missile boat . 
 According to Chaim Herzog , Israel responded with a naval blockade of Egypt which damaged the Egyptian economy . However , the sea routes to Egypt 's principal ports — Alexandria on the Mediterranean and Port <unk> on the Red Sea — remained secure and open to shipping for the duration of the war . 
 = = = October 7 = = = 
 In the early hours of Sunday October 7 , just after midnight , Egyptian infantry , now with tank support , advanced to expand their bridgeheads . Israeli armored formations had experienced heavy losses in trying repeatedly to reach the Bar Lev Line and were disorganized and confused . Many Israeli units , however , stubbornly resisted the Egyptian advance . Twice during the night of October 6 to October 7 , groups of tanks and infantry penetrated the bridgeheads to reach the canal line , where they managed to damage two bridges and destroy a number of ferries . Surrounded on all sides , however , these units were soon destroyed . Before sunrise the bridgeheads had reached a depth of 6 – 9 kilometers ( 3 @.@ 7 – 5 @.@ 6 mi ) , and the attacking Israeli units retreated . With sufficient numbers of armor finally on the east bank , reinforcements of infantry began to cross . Dawn on October 7 saw a total of 50 @,@ 000 men ( around 10 @,@ 000 to each bridgehead ) and 400 Egyptian tanks occupying five bridgeheads in the Sinai across the Suez Canal . Egyptian forces reorganised and entrenched themselves in anticipation of Israeli counterattacks . 
 David Elazar continued to instruct Gonen to evacuate soldiers from strongpoints which were not yet surrounded , even though by October 7 most Israeli defences were encircled . Egyptian losses up to the morning of October 7 were only 280 killed and 20 tanks destroyed . Israeli losses were far heavier ; the brigade in the Bar Lev Line was completely surrounded and most of its men were casualties while 200 were captured . Armored losses were 200 – 300 tanks destroyed . One source puts the losses at roughly 200 by morning , but several battalion @-@ sized attacks to regain the forts around El @-@ Qantarah , and to reach some of the central and southern forts incurred further casualties with over 50 tanks being destroyed . In subsequent days some of the defenders in the Bar Lev Line managed to break though Egyptian forces and return to their lines , or were extracted by Israeli forces in counterattacks that came later on . 
 As the magnitude of Israeli losses became clear , Gonen made the decision at noon to form a defensive line on the Lateral Road , 30 kilometers ( 19 mi ) east of the canal , and ordered his divisional commanders to deploy accordingly . At noon , elements of Abraham Adan 's 162nd Division and Ariel Sharon 's 143rd Division began to reach the fronts . Consequently , Gonen divided the front into three divisional commands : Adan was deployed in the northern sector , Sharon in the central sector , and Mandler in the southern sector . 
 Air strikes continued throughout the day , and Southern Command received optimistic reports during the afternoon from the IAF , which claimed seven bridges knocked out of action , with the remaining ones to be destroyed by evening . In fact , several of the bridges that had been destroyed were decoys . The real bridges meanwhile , had their damaged sections quickly repaired and returned to service . Ten heavy bridges had been laid during the crossing ( two bridges in the south were laid but not operational ) . Now , on October 7 , five of these bridges were removed and placed with the two already in reserve , leaving each division with one heavy bridge and one light bridge . 
 Egyptian forces widened their bridgeheads that day to narrow the 14 – 15 kilometers ( 8 @.@ 7 – 9 @.@ 3 mi ) gaps between them . Meanwhile , General Headquarters worked on organizing its forces on the east bank . Egyptian troops had crossed with 24 @-@ hours ' worth of supplies . By Sunday it became necessary to resupply these forces , but administrative and supply units were in disarray , and to the south problems with laying the bridges further handicapped supply efforts there . October 7 offered a relative lull from the intense fighting that had taken place , allowing the Egyptians to organize battlefield administration . At 19th Division 's bridgehead to the south , all efforts to lay three bridges there were abandoned due to difficulties with the terrain . Instead , supplies and reinforcement destined for the division were transferred over 7th Division 's bridges to the north , where engineers were more successful in laying the bridges . 
 Fighting throughout the front did not cease entirely for the rest of the day , most of it taking part around the besieged Israeli defences and strongpoints that still resisted . Meanwhile , the Sa 'iqa units airdropped into Sinai the previous day began engaging Israeli reserves heading for the front . The main areas of operation were the central mountain passes , the northern coastal routes , and near the Gulf of Suez . One battalion , transported in 18 helicopters , captured the Ras Sidr Pass south of Port Tawfiq , near the Gulf of Suez . En route four helicopters were shot down , but the survivors , including 9 crewmen , managed to regroup with the rest of the battalion . It held its position for the remainder of the war under extremely difficult conditions , preventing Israeli reserves from using the pass to reach the front . Two companies attempted to establish themselves in central Sinai , between Tasa and Bir <unk> . Israeli air interdiction resulted in six helicopter making a forced landing after being hit , while two helicopters turned and withdrew . The forced landings incurred many casualties , particularly due to burns , and the survivors trekked their way back to friendly lines . Only four helicopters reached the designated landing zone , and they could not be flown once more , indicating the suicidal nature of these operations . Albeit a third of their original force , the Sa 'iqa managed to block Israeli reserves for over eight hours . Both companies were almost completely destroyed , suffering around 150 dead , including 15 officers . Israeli estimates claim to have downed between ten and twenty helicopters on the first day of the war . 
 In northern Sinai , a company established itself along the coastal road between Romani and Baluza on October 6 . The following day , it ambushed Colonel Natke Nir 's armored brigade , part of Adan 's division , destroying around 18 tanks along with other vehicles . The coastal road was blocked for over five hours . Airborne Israeli infantry was committed to support the armor , and in the ensuing battle , another 12 tanks and 6 half @-@ tracks were destroyed . Some 30 soldiers of the brigade were killed , while the Sa 'iqa company lost 75 dead . In addition to delaying Israeli reserves , commandos carried out sabotage operations . 
 The report cards for these operations are highly controversial . Some sources claim the commandos suffered immense casualties and were <unk> . However , it is clear that these operations inflicted damage and caused confusion and anxiety among the Israelis , who diverted resources to counter these threats , while reservists were slowed down . One Israeli divisional commander also commended the Egyptian Sa 'iqa . 
 El @-@ Qantarah also saw heavy fighting as troops from the 18th Division engaged Israeli forces within and around the town . By early morning the division commander , Brigadier General Fuad ' Aziz Ghali , was able to set up his command post there . Close quarter combat and even hand @-@ to @-@ hand fighting took place as the Egyptians cleared the ghost town building by building . Fighting was intense , and by the end of October 7 , the town and its outskirts as well as two nearby fortifications of the Bar Lev Line were under Egyptian control . 
 = = = = Israeli conference at Umm Hashiba = = = = 
 David Elazar , encouraged by reports of IAF successes , decided to visit Israeli Southern Command . He was accompanied by his aide , Colonel Avner <unk> and the former Israeli Chief of Staff , Yitzhak Rabin . Elazar arrived at Gonen 's advance command post at Gebel Umm Hashiba at 18 : 45 ; chief among those attending were Gonen , Adan and Mandler . Sharon only arrived after the meeting had been concluded . 
 At the conference , in light of the little information available on Egyptian dispositions and intentions , and due to a shortage of infantry and artillery , the commanders agreed they could not relieve the surrounded strongpoints on the canal in the near future . There was a general consensus to attack Egyptian forces throwing them off balance , but disagreed on how to do so . Southern Command expected to have 640 tanks on Monday October 8 , of which 530 tanks would be distributed among three divisions : 200 tanks under Adan , 180 under Sharon , and 150 under Mandler after part of his losses were replaced . Estimates put the number of Egyptian tanks at 400 , when there were in fact 800 tanks across the canal by Sunday evening . In light of the apparent superiority , Gonen recommended a frontal attack at night with Adan 's 162nd Division crossing to the west bank at El @-@ Qantarah and Sharon 's 143rd Division crossing into Suez City . Adan however , lacking infantry , urged a cautious approach until more reserves reached the front . 
 Elazar favored caution as well , and decided on a limited attack on the morning of October 8 . Adan would attack southward against Second Army , remaining 3 – 5 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 9 – 3 @.@ 1 mi ) away from the canal to avoid Egyptian anti @-@ tank weaponry . Sharon would continue the southward probes towards Ismailia as his division moved into its sector , concentrating at Tasa to support Adan if needed . Kept open was the question of an Israeli counter @-@ crossing should such the Egyptians collapse under Israeli counterattacks . Should Adan succeed , Sharon would attack Third Army 's bridgehead in a manner similar to Adan , and then cross to the west bank . Mandler would remain on the defensive , organizing his division which had been mauled by the fighting , and was down to a few dozen tanks . Elazar clearly emphasized that no canal crossing and no attempt to reach the strongpoints would occur without his approval . The meeting ended at 22 : 00 . 
 Thereafter , Sharon arrived after missing the entire conference . Speaking with Gonen and the other commanders after Elazar had left , Sharon recommended an immediate assault to relieve the beleaguered strongpoints . Gonen pointed out that this had been the Israeli course of action for the past 14 – 16 hours , to no avail . However he did not reject Sharon outright , and indeed told him to prepare for such an attack , promising a final decision on the matter before 6 : 00 at dawn . Nevertheless , Sharon would conform to the original plan for a limited attack on the following day . 
 = = = October 8 = = = 
 The five division @-@ size bridgeheads consolidated themselves on Monday , October 8 into two army @-@ size bridgeheads : the Second Army with its three divisions occupied El @-@ Qantarah in the north to Deversoir in the south , while the Third Army with two divisions occupied the southern end of the Bitter Lakes to a point southeast of Port Tawfiq ( at the far end of the canal ) . These two bridgeheads incorporated a total of 90 @,@ 000 men and 980 tanks , dug in and entrenched . Each division deployed , in accordance with Operation Badr , two infantry brigades in its forward echelon , and one mechanized infantry brigade in the second echelon . In reserve was one armored brigade . The Egyptians had established anti @-@ tank defences along their lines employing Sagger <unk> , RPGs , B @-@ 10 and B @-@ 11 anti tank recoilless rifles . 
 At dawn a friendly fire incident occurred as the 2nd and 16th Divisions in Second Army were closing the gap between their bridgeheads . While cresting a ridge , two tank platoons from either division confronted each other at 460 meters ( 1 @,@ 510 ft ) . The tank crews were so agitated that they opened fire immediately . Each platoon lost two of its three tanks to direct hits within minutes , and several men were killed . 
 Shazly visited the front in the early morning before the Israeli attack to form an assessment of the situation . He arrived at Second Army Headquarters where he was briefed on the situation , then went to 2nd Division 's advanced headquarters , where he met Brigadier General Hasan Abu Sa 'ada and visited the frontline troops . Many of the soldiers had not slept for two nights , but the successful crossing was a moral booster , a tonic as he described it . 
 Shazly then went southward to 7th Division 's bridgehead in Third Army 's sector , where traffic was almost at a standstill . Shazly met with 7th division commander Brigadier General <unk> , who informed him of the bridge @-@ laying problems experienced by 19th Division 's engineers further south , leading all Third Army supplies and reinforcements to be sent over 7th Division 's already congested bridges , creating a solid traffic jam . Despite Sunday 's lull , the situation had not yet improved . This created complications , as soldiers and tank crews lost contact with their units and consequently had no idea of their designated positions . Many troops were low on supplies , and some even returned to the west bank of the canal to replenish their food and water supply . 
 After conferring with the chief engineers of the Second and Third field armies , Shazly became aware that IAF , despite heavy losses , had destroyed so many bridge sections that the Egyptians had lost the equivalent of three heavy bridges , leaving four bridges in reserve along with the five already laid in the canal . This gave rise to concerns about supply in the coming days and weeks . Shazly then discussed the possibility of constructing three bridges in the canal using earth and sand . This would make causeways impregnable against air strikes and artillery . The chief engineer of the Third Army , with whom he discussed the idea , was confidant that , given enough bulldozers , the causeways could be constructed in one week .

 Shortly after midnight on October 8 , optimistic field reports expecting an imminent Egyptian collapse caused Gonen to alter plans for the attack . Adan would now attack in the direction of the strongpoints at Firdan and Ismailia . The change was not formulated on precise tactical intelligence , and would come to cause some confusion among Israeli commanders for the rest of the day . 
 Adan 's 162nd Armoured Division was deployed along the Baluza – Tasa road to the north . His division was composed of Colonel Natke Nir 's armored brigade with 71 tanks , Gabi Amir 's brigade with 50 M60 tanks , and Aryeh Keren 's brigade with 62 tanks ( still en route to the area ) for a total of 183 tanks . Adan still planned to avoid Egyptian anti @-@ tank weaponry by having Amir 's brigade move southward between Lexicon and Artillery roads ( the former road ran immediately alongside the canal , and the latter was 10 – 15 kilometers ( 6 @.@ 2 – 9 @.@ 3 mi ) east of it ) , to reach a position that would link the brigade to the <unk> strongpoint opposite Firdan and the Purkan strongpoint opposite Ismailia . Nir would move in a similar manner to link up with Purkan . Keren would move east of Artillery Road and position his brigade opposite the Matzmed strongpoint at the northern end of the Bitter Lakes . A mechanized infantry brigade with 44 Super Shermans was expected to join in the attack by late morning . Little or no air support would come for the attack ; the IAF was concentrated on the Syrian front . 
 At 07 : 53 , minutes before the Israeli attack was to commence , Israeli forces near El @-@ Qantarah became heavily engaged with a brigade composing the 18th Division 's right flank , as Egyptian troops sought to secure the town and its vicinity . Fuad , the division commander supported the brigade with two companies of T @-@ 62 tanks . To prevent Israeli forces in the area from being outflanked , Gonen ordered Nir to remain near El @-@ Qantarah to help contain the Egyptian attack . This left Adan with only 50 tanks under Amir 's command to carry out the attack . 
 Amir began the drive south at 08 : 06 , and was ordered to prepare to reach the strongpoints on Adan 's signal . Keren was still en route to the area . Once his brigade arrived he would conduct an assault against 16th Division 's bridgehead in the direction of Matzmed . However , Amir made an error in navigation , and instead of moving 3 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) from the canal , he moved along Artillery road , 15 kilometers ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) away . Consequently , Amir would be forced to conduct a frontal assault in an east @-@ west direction instead of the north @-@ south flanking maneuver which Adan had planned . 
 Amir 's brigade began to reach the plain between Artillery Road and the Firdan bridge at 09 : 00 . So far no Egyptian resistance of any significance had been encountered . The brigade had the objective of attacking 2nd Division 's bridgehead . Abu Sa 'ada , the division commander , had the 24th Armored Brigade as the divisional reserve , but he could only commit it in case of an Israeli penetration . Gonen wanted Adan to reach the <unk> strongpoint , and contacted Elazar in Tel Aviv at 09 : 55 to request a crossing of the canal . Gonen either downplayed or ignored negative reports and only told Elazar of positive developments . Elazar , who was at a meeting , communicated with Gonen through his assistant and approved of a crossing , also giving permission for Sharon 's division to move south . 
 At 10 : 40 , Gonen ordered Adan to cross to the west bank and Sharon to move towards Suez City . Short of forces , Adan requested that Sharon send a battalion to protect his southern flank . Gonen consented , but Sharon would not comply , and consequently several critical positions would be lost to the Egyptians later on . 
 Just before the assault commenced , one of Amir 's battalions disengaged to restock on ammunition and fuel . The other battalion proceeded with the assault at 11 : 00 . Some 25 tanks carried out an assault planned to be performed by 121 tanks . The Israelis broke through the first Egyptian troops and advanced to within 800 meters ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) of the canal . At this point the Israelis came under heavy fire from anti @-@ tank weaponry , artillery and tanks . The battalion lost 18 tanks within minutes , and most of its commanders were either killed or wounded . 
 By now Nir had disengaged at El @-@ Qantarah , leaving a battalion behind , and arrived opposite the Firdan bridge at 12 : 30 with two tank battalions . While Amir and Nir discussed plans for an attack , Keren arrived and Adan ordered him to support Nir and Amir by attacking towards Purkan . Meanwhile , Sharon left Tasa and headed for Suez City , leaving a single reconnaissance company to hold vital ridges such as <unk> and <unk> , but not the hills to the north , such as Hamutal . Instead , Keren 's brigade gained responsibility for these areas , but Sharon 's action further endangered Adan 's position . 
 Amir 's brigade was now down to one battalion , which was to attack with Nir 's brigade of 50 tanks . To Amir 's surprise , a reserve armored battalion of 25 tanks commanded by Colonel Eliashiv <unk> arrived in the area , en route to Keren 's brigade . Short of forces , Amir , with Adan 's approval , commandeered <unk> 's battalion , and ordered him to provide covering fire for Nir 's assault on the Firdan bridge . 
 At around 13 : 00 , a recon group from 2nd Division discovered around 75 tanks concentrating north east of the bridgehead . Ten minutes later the Egyptians intercepted a radio signal in Hebrew . Nir was informing his command that he was ready to attack within twenty minutes . With little time left , Abu Sa 'ada decided to take a risky move . Estimating , correctly , that the attack would come be directed between his two forward brigades , the weakest point in his lines , Abu Sa 'ada planned to draw Israeli forces into his bridgehead to within three kilometers of the canal before engaging them from all sides , committing all his anti @-@ tank reserves . At 13 : 30 , the attack was carried out by Amir and Nir 's brigades . A lack of coordination and communication difficulties between both brigades hampered the attack . Nir 's two battalions attacked at the same time in two echelons . The Egyptians allowed the Israelis to advance , then encircled them . When the attackers entered the prepared killing zone , Egyptian armor of the 24th Brigade opened fire on the advancing tanks , complemented by infantry anti @-@ tank weapons on either flank of the Israeli forces , while tank hunting detachments attacked from the rear . Within just 13 minutes , most of the Israeli force was destroyed — the Egyptians destroyed over 50 tanks and captured eight intact . Among the captured were Lieutenant Colonel Asaf <unk> , a battalion commander , whose unit lost 32 killed . By the end of the attack Nir had just four operational tanks remaining , including his own . Gabi Amir 's battalion , attacking to Nir 's right , was forced to halt his advance after encountering stiff resistance . Amir requested air support several times , but did not receive any . 
 = = = = Egyptian advance = = = = 
 Operation Badr called for an enlargement of the bridgeheads on October 8 . To accomplish this , each of the five infantry divisions had to reorganize its forces . Mechanized infantry brigades in the second echelon of divisional lines were to advance between the two forward infantry brigades . Thus the mechanized brigade would form the first line , the two infantry brigades would form the second line , and the reserve armored brigade would constitute a third echelon . 
 During the afternoon of the 8th , Egyptian artillery barrages and air strikes took place along the entire front against opposing Israeli forces . The Israelis , who believed they were on the counter @-@ offensive , were surprised at the sight of advancing Egyptian troops . Not all advancing Egyptian units managed to reach the 12 kilometers ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) mark necessary to control Artillery Road , but each division held positions more than 9 kilometers ( 5 @.@ 6 mi ) deep . In Second Army 's sector , the 16th Infantry Division was the most successful by occupying the strategic positions of <unk> , <unk> , Missouri and Hamutal after fighting that lasted between 2 : 00 and 4 : 30 PM . Hamutal was 15 kilometers ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) from the canal and overlooked the juncture of Ismailia and Artillery Roads . Brigadier General ' Adil <unk> lost his leg while commanding his brigade 's attack on these positions . The deepest penetration was in Third Army 's sector , where the bridgehead reached a depth of nearly 18 kilometers ( 11 mi ) . The Egyptians also captured several additional Bar Lev forts . 
 The Israelis now made an attempt to regain the lost ground . Keren 's brigade organized for an assault on Hamutal Hill . One battalion provided covering fire , while two battalions under Lieutenant Colonels Dan <unk> and Amir ( not to be confused with the brigade commander Gabi Amir ) attacked with 27 tanks . Nearly 1 @,@ 000 meters ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) from Egyptian positions , Dan Sapir was killed when his tank took a direct hit , disrupting his battalion 's attack . Amir 's battalion continued fighting until dusk after losing seven tanks . 
 Gonen , starting to realise the gravity of Adan 's position , ordered Sharon at 14 : 45 to pull back and return to his initial positions . The Erez Armored Brigade arrived to offer assistance to Keren , but poor coordination between the commanders led to the failure of further attempts to capture Hamutal Hill . By the end of the day Adan 's division alone had lost around 100 tanks . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Operation Badr was the opening battle of the Yom Kippur War in the Sinai , and the first major Arab victory against the Israelis in years . 
 By repelling a division @-@ sized counterattack on October 8 , and establishing bridgeheads on the east bank to a depth of around 15 kilometers , the Egyptians had accomplished the objectives of Operation Badr . At the start of the war , U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger believed that the better @-@ equipped Israelis would secure victory within a few days , and thus tried to delay a ceasefire in the United Nations Security Council . The counterattack on October 8 however , came against American expectations . Kissinger was taken aback when told of the extent of Israel 's losses on the morning of October 9 by Israeli Ambassador Simcha Dinitz , and asked " Explain to me , how could 400 tanks be lost to the Egyptians ? " Dinitz may have threatened Kissinger with the use of nuclear weapons against Egypt and Syria in order to underline the urgency of Israel 's situation and push the U.S. into initiating an airlift to replace Israel 's losses . Later that day Kissinger relayed U.S. President Richard Nixon 's decision to initiate Operation Nickel Grass — which aimed to replace all of Israel 's material losses — to Dinitz . 
 The prevailing view of Kissinger and many IDF officers on the Sinai Front was that the tide would quickly turn in their favor . The course of combat on October 8 thus came as a shock . At the end of the day Gonen , commented " It 's not the Egyptian Army of 1967 . " In a press conference at night on October 8 , not knowing that the counteroffensive had been defeated , Elazar claimed that the destruction of the Egyptian Army was underway , and that the IDF would soon " break their [ the Arabs military personnel 's ] bones . " He would later regret these statements . Israeli commanders began to doubt Gonen 's ability . In a meeting with Israeli commanders after midnight on October 9 , Elazar decided to suspend offensive operations until the Syrians had been neutralized , especially since there were just 400 tanks left in the Sinai . Disregarding this new order , Sharon division mounted a major brigade @-@ sized attack the following day . Despite initial successes , the Israelis had been repulsed by the end of the day with no gains , losing around 60 tanks in the process . Gonen was furious at Sharon , not only because of his violation of the decision to remain on the defensive , but also because he had repeatedly disobeyed direct orders from Gonen on a number of occasions . Elazar was equally livid , but rather than remove Sharon , an insubordinate but innovative commander with political connection to the opposition party , Elazar decided to replace Gonen , who had proven to be out of his depth , inept at being an operational commander . Former Chief of Staff Chaim Bar @-@ Lev was brought out of retirement to replace Gonen . To avoid the appearance of firing him , Gonen was retained as deputy to Bar @-@ Lev by Elazar . By October 10 , the front settled into a stalemate . 
 The success achieved by Operation Badr surprised Egyptian commanders , whose confidence soared . Sadat came under pressure to press the offensive towards the Sinai Passes , but remained unyielding , holding to the original goal of waging a limited war . Ahmed Ismail and Shazly were also on par with Sadat 's opinion . However , appeals from the Syrians , whose situation was desperate by October 9 , ultimately forced Sadat to change his mind for political reasons , against the protests of his commanders . Consequently , Egypt would lose the initiative to Israel when it launched its unsuccessful attack eastwards on October 14 . 
 = = = Political impact = = = 
 Soon after the war , many Israelis demanded an impartial inquiry to investigate what became known as the <unk> ( the blunder ) , with a focus on the shortcomings of the government and the army , particularly their lack of preparedness for the attack and its ramifications . Golda Meir finally agreed to the formation of the <unk> Commission towards the end of November 1973 . War veterans and members of the public attacked Meir and Moshe Dayan , while Israeli generals criticised one another 's performance . 
 While Meir and the Israeli Labor Party won the elections held in late @-@ December , the release of the <unk> Commission 's findings in April 1974 and its failure to accuse the nation 's political leadership of any shortcomings — while recommending the dismissal of several senior officers — led to widespread public outrage . Meir resigned in response to public criticism , but Dayan remained steadfast . Eventually , the 1977 elections saw the end of Labor Party 's unchallenged reign over Israeli politics with the election of Menachem Begin and the Likud Party . 
 The 1973 war convinced the Israelis of the necessity of negotiations with the Arabs . This unprecedented willingness , coupled with Sadat 's diplomatic initiatives and intercession by the United States to break barriers of mistrust between Egypt and Israel , made possible the long series of discussions between both nations . The negotiations ultimately resulted in the 1978 Camp David Agreements , and the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel in 1979 . Thus , without resorting to another major war , Sadat had been able to regain the Sinai through diplomatic means .

 Sorga Ka Toedjoe ( [ <unk> kə <unk> ] ; vernacular Malay for Seventh Heaven ; also advertised under the Dutch title In Den <unk> Hemel ) is a 1940 film from the Dutch East Indies ( present @-@ day Indonesia ) directed by Joshua and Othniel Wong for Tan 's Film . It follows an older couple ( Kartolo and Annie Landouw ) who are reunited after years of separation by another , younger couple ( Roekiah and Djoemala ) . The black @-@ and @-@ white film , the first production by Tan 's Film after the departure of Rd Mochtar , featured kroncong music and was targeted at lower @-@ class native audiences . It was a commercial and critical success . Roekiah and Djoemala took leading roles in three more films before Tan 's closed in 1942 . Sorga Ka Toedjoe is now thought lost . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Rasminah ( Roekiah ) is living with her blind aunt Hadidjah ( Annie Landouw ) in Puncak , a village south @-@ east of Buitenzorg ( now Bogor ) . Hadidjah has been separated from her husband , Kasimin , for several years , ever since she accused him of adultery . Although she regretted the incident almost immediately , it was too late ; a corpse resembling Kasimin was found floating in a river , and in her hurry to see the body Hadidjah was struck by a car , blinding her . Now she sings the kroncong song " Sorga Ka Toedjoe " , which Kasimin declared to be a symbol of his love , at 5 p.m. every day . Unknown to Hadidjah , Kasimin ( Kartolo ) is alive and well ; he also sings " Sorga Ka Toedjoe " every day at the same time . 
 Following an encounter with the rich and detestable Parta , who intends to take her as his second wife , Rasminah goes to the nearby city of Batavia ( now Jakarta ) to find a job . Several days later , having found work , she returns to Puncak to pick up Hadidjah and take her to Batavia . However , Parta and his cohort Doel are waiting in ambush . When Rasminah 's carriage is stuck in a rut , the two begin to chase after her . Rasminah runs into the woods and , after several close calls , finds shelter in a small house . There she rests the night , without seeing the owner . 
 The following morning , Rasminah is awakened by the sound of a guitar , played by the house 's owner , Hoesin ( Djoemala ) . Afraid that he is collaborating with Parta , she sneaks outside , only to be confronted by Parta and Doel . Retreating , she is chased by the pair . Hoesin intervenes and , after a fierce fight , defeats the two and chases them away . He then reassures Rasminah and escorts her home . 
 Over the following days Hoesin repeatedly visits Rasminah , and slowly the two begin to fall in love . When Rasminah takes her aunt to Batavia to live , Hoesin follows . They begin discussing their future together , but Rasminah insists that she will only marry when her aunt is reunited with Kasimin . After a lengthy search , in which he almost gives up hope , Hoesin finds Kasimin at a small plantation in the hills outside of the city – Hadidjah 's long @-@ lost husband previously operated his own orchard , but had been evicted by a conniving and greedy landlord only days before . Kasimin and Hadidjah are reunited , allowing Hoesin and Rasminah to begin their own preparations .

 Sorga Ka Toedjoe was directed by brothers Joshua and Othniel Wong for Tan 's Film , a company owned by the ethnic Chinese brothers Khoen Yauw and Khoen Hian . The Tan brothers , who owned a pair of cinemas , had been active in the industry since Njai Dasima in 1929 . The Wongs had worked for Tan 's since 1938 , when they directed the hit film Fatima , helping to reestablish the company after it had been dissolved in 1932 . Sorga Ka Toedjoe was shot in black @-@ and @-@ white , with some scenes filmed at <unk> Warna , near Buitenzorg . 
 The film starred Roekiah , Rd Djoemala , Kartolo , and Annie Landouw and featured Titing , Ismail , and Ramli . Roekiah had regularly been paired on @-@ screen with Rd . Mochtar – despite being married to Kartolo – beginning with Terang Boelan . In 1938 the three had come to Tan 's , where they acted together in three films beginning with Fatima . However , after a wage dispute following Siti Akbari ( 1940 ) , Mochtar left the company . To replace him , Tan 's hired the tailor Djoemala as Roekiah 's romantic foil . Sorga Ka Toedjoe was their first film together . 
 Kartolo handled the film 's music , and many of the cast had experience singing kroncong ( traditional music with Portuguese influences ) . Before making their feature film debut in Albert Balink 's Terang Boelan ( Full Moon ; 1937 ) , Roekiah and Kartolo had found popularity with the stage musical troupe Palestina . Landouw had been a kroncong singer with Hugo Dumas ' Lief Java orchestra , and Titing was likewise an established singer . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 Sorga Ka Toedjoe had its Surabaya premiere on 30 October 1940 , one of fourteen domestic productions released that year . By March 1941 it had reached Singapore , then part of the Straits Settlements . As with all of Tan 's productions , the film was targeted at lower @-@ class native audiences of all ages . It was advertised , sometimes under the Dutch title In Den <unk> Hemel , as a " simple yet compelling film " which featured " good music , catchy songs , and beautiful scenery " . A novelisation of the film was released by the Yogyakarta @-@ based publisher Kolff @-@ Buning and included several production stills . 
 The film was a commercial success . Reviews were likewise positive . The Soerabaijasch Handelsblad gave the film high praise , stating that it had good dialogue and music as well as a " well chosen , romantic and not exaggerated " theme . According to the reviewer , Sorga Ka Toedjoe seemed to have been inspired by American films but still showed its Indies character . The reviewer also opined that Djoemala was as good as , if not better , than Mochtar . De Indische Courant praised the scenery and noted that the film criticised rich landlords who abused their power , while the Singapore Free Press praised Roekiah 's acting .

 After Sorga Ka Toedjoe , Tan 's Film produced a further four films , a much lower number than its competitors such as The Teng Chun 's Java Industrial Film and its subsidiaries . Three of these productions starred Roekiah and Djoemala in the leading roles , and featured Kartolo . Landouw , according to JB Kristanto 's Katalog Film Indonesia ( Indonesian Film Catalogue ) , did not make another film . Tan 's was ultimately shut down in 1942 , following the Japanese occupation of the Indies . 
 The film is likely lost . Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable nitrate film , and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara 's warehouse in 1952 , old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed . As such , the American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost . However , Kristanto records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia 's archives , and film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service .

 = Battle of Flores ( 1592 ) = 
 The Battle of Flores ( 1592 ) , also known as Cruising Voyage to the Azores of 1592 , or the Capture of the Madre de Deus describes a series of naval engagements that took place from 20 May to 19 August 1592 , during the Anglo @-@ Spanish War . The battle was part of an expedition by an English fleet initially led by Sir Walter Raleigh , and then by Martin Frobisher and John Burrough . The expedition involved the capture of a number of Portuguese and Spanish ships including the large Portuguese carrack Madre de Deus , after a long naval battle off the island of Flores in the Azores . The expedition , particularly the capture of the great carrack , was a financial and military success . The rich cargo aboard the carrack , which at the time equaled nearly half the size of the Kingdom of England 's royal annual revenue , was subject to mass theft when it arrived in Dartmouth , England , followed by quarrels over the shares of the prize . The expedition had formative consequences for the English both financially and on the future of English exploration . 
 = = Background = = 
 By virtue of the Iberian Union that joined the crowns of Portugal and Spain in 1580 , the Anglo @-@ Portuguese Treaty of 1373 had fallen in abeyance . As the Anglo – Spanish War was ongoing , Portuguese shipping was a fair target for the Royal Navy . Sir Walter Raleigh , having only just been released from the Tower of London , received a commission from Queen Elizabeth I for an expedition to the West Indies . He outfitted a sixteen ship naval squadron of which two , the Garland and Foresight belonged to the Queen . 
 = = = Expedition = = = 
 The expedition was a private venture much like the Drake @-@ Norris expedition , supported by limited assistance and subsidies from the crown . Its objective was to pillage Spanish and Portuguese ships within the Atlantic , off the Spanish coast or within the Caribbean and to make a profit from which the Queen 's portion would amount to a large sum . 
 Raleigh appointed Burrough as his vice @-@ admiral and was joined in commission with Frobisher , who had knowledge of maritime affairs . George Clifford , the Earl of Cumberland had the largest stake in the expedition and helped Raleigh to finance and gather the fleet . The majority of the fleet were owned by investors ; the ship Dainty for example was owned by John Hawkins , but was captained by John Norton . The fleet included notables such as William Monson , Robert Crosse , captain of the Foresight , Samuel Purchas , Richard Hawkins and Christopher Newport , captain of the Golden Dragon . 
 The expedition launched from Dartmouth , setting sail on 6 May 1592 after delays due to bad weather . The planned voyage to the West Indies was put on hold as supplies had already been depleted during the delay . Instead the fleet intended to head towards the Azores to intercept a Spanish treasure fleet or Portuguese carracks heading homeward from the East Indies . Initially Raleigh commanded , but on the following day , 7 May , the fleet was overtaken by Frobisher in the pinnace <unk> . Raleigh was given letters from the Queen ordering his immediate recall to England , and thus Frobisher took command . On 11 May a storm struck just off Cape Finisterre , scattering the majority of the fleet ; three small ships were sunk and Garland very nearly foundered . 
 Nearing Cape St Vincent on the Portuguese coast , the fleet split into two sections as ordered by Raleigh . One , under Burrough , headed to the Azores to lie in wait for Spanish and Portuguese ships . The other , under Frobisher in Garland with Clifford , cruised off Cape St. Vincent with the strategy to pin the Spanish fleet against their own lee coast . 
 = = = First engagements = = = 
 The fleet sailed further south , and by the end of May encountered the Santa Clara , an armed , 600 @-@ ton Spanish galleon , just off Cape St. Vincent . The English captured the ship after heavy resistance , taking whatever goods the Spanish had failed to retrieve from her burnt @-@ out hull . She was carrying a large amount of ironware valued at £ 7 @,@ 000 and was sailing to Sanlúcar de Barrameda where further freight was destined for the West Indies . With the capture , the fleet separated , leaving the prize and goods in the hands of Frobisher and Clifford . 
 As the fleet continued south from the Cape in early June , Burrough in the Roebuck took a Spanish flyboat after a long chase that brought him near the Spanish coast . The flyboat 's master revealed that a great fleet was prepared at Cadiz and Sanlúcar de Barrameda . Having received intelligence that Raleigh was fitted out with a strong force for the West Indies , Philip II of Spain had provided a large fleet to oppose Raleigh and to escort the rich East India carracks to port . Don Alonso de Bazán , brother to the Marquis of Santa Cruz and Captain General of the Armada , was to pursue and intercept Raleigh 's fleet . As Burrough 's men were burning the flyboat , part of the Spanish fleet was spotted , and Burrough , having rejoined his own fleet , soon sailed to the Azores . 
 Further north off Portugal , Frobisher 's position became untenable , although he captured a prize fresh from Brazil laden with sugar heading to Lisbon on 18 June and a few days later captured a Spanish caravel . Frobisher 's group returned to England from Cape St. Vincent having missed Alvaro de Bazán 's fleet further south . 
 = = Battle = = 
 Burrough did not have to wait long : on 25 June his scout ships spotted a large vessel approaching them near Corvo Island , the northernmost of the Azores . 
 = = = Santa Cruz = = = 
 The vessel , the 800 @-@ ton Portuguese carrack Santa Cruz , was pursued by three of Cumberland 's ships . A storm arrived and forced the English away from the lee shore , but Santa Cruz was beached on the coast of Corvo . The following morning , once the storm had passed , the Portuguese who had disembarked set up entrenchments nearby , taking off the cargo and burning the vessel . Burrough immediately dispatched 100 soldiers who waded ashore and easily dispersed those who guarded the shore ; after some resistance the site was captured , and the Portuguese fled . The cargo burnt inside the ship although some was salvaged by the English . Prisoners were taken , including the ship 's purser and two foreign gunners . Under threat of torture they confessed that within fifteen days , three other carracks would arrive at the island . The fleet of five carracks had departed from Goa and were headed for Lisbon and consisted of the Santa Cruz , Buen Jesus admiral , Madre de Deus , San Bernardo , and San <unk> . Madre de Deus was the largest of the fleet , a thirty @-@ two gun vessel of 1 @,@ 600 tons and was one of the Portuguese crown 's greatest and one of the largest sailing ships ever built . 
 With the news , the English ships waited and raided the villages on Corvo for supplies . For the month of July the English ships formed a picket line spaced about six miles apart along a north / south axis . From the southern flank near Flores Island , the order of ships was Dainty , Golden Dragon , Roebuck , Tiger , Sampson , Prudence and Foresight . The Spanish fleet , which had been sighted briefly , seemed no longer a threat ; Alvaro de Bazan had made a major miscalculation : he disobeyed orders and headed further west , allowing the English to first reach the area of interception . 
 = = = Madre de Deus = = = 
 On 3 August Dainty sighted a large ship heading directly towards them and as it drew nearer , its enormous size became apparent . The carrack was far larger than Santa Cruz , fully three times the size of England 's biggest ship . Madre de Deus was attacked by the much smaller Dainty . Around midday Newport 's Golden Dragon , followed by Roebuck - bigger than Dainty , but only a fraction of the Madre , joined the fray . These were followed at two @-@ hour intervals by Foresight and Prudence in the evening . The Dainty had her foremast shot away and was out of the battle for five hours . 
 The English hoped to avoid sinking their opponent and to prevent her from running aground . The damage on Madre de Deus 's defences was becoming serious . With her bow rigging all but disabled , Burrough sent Roebuck which then crashed into Madre de Deus , followed by Foresight . Both moved directly under her main guns . The English boarded her in the dark at 10 pm . Golden Dragon , Sampson and Tiger and the repaired Dainty came up in support . The English took the ship after a bloody hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat . 
 The bloody decks of Madre De Deus were strewn with bodies , especially around the helm . The carrack was nearly destroyed when a cabin full of cartridges caught fire , and only quick English action saved the prize . Burrough spared Captain Fernão de Mendonça and the rest of the wounded , sending them ashore . Burrough was trying to keep his own Roebuck afloat , as it had sustained damage when it crashed into Madre . Only when Burrough came aboard and claimed the prize in the name of the Queen did pillaging stop . Sailors were stripped of " stolen " goods ; however , this proved only temporary . 
 The carrack was quickly repaired , heavily guarded by all ships , and the expedition set sail for England . Bazan now closed in on the English but he was too late ; for a hundred leagues he pursued the English in vain before returning to Spain . The fleet reached the English Channel in early September without incident . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 As the fleet sailed back to England , Burrough produced an inventory - the report mentions 
 " Gods great favor towards our nation , who by putting this purchase into our hands hath manifestly discovered those secret trades & Indian riches , which hitherto lay strangely hidden , and cunningly concealed from us " . 
 Among these riches were chests filled with jewels and pearls , gold and silver coins , ambergris , bolts of the highest @-@ quality cloth , fine tapestries , 425 tons of pepper , 45 tons of cloves , 35 tons of cinnamon , 3 tons of mace and 3 of nutmeg , 2 @.@ 5 tons of <unk> ( a highly aromatic <unk> resin used for perfumes and medicines ) , 25 tons of the precious red dye cochineal and 15 tons of <unk> inventory was taken : 
 " spices , drugs , silks , calicos , quilts , carpets and colors , & c . The spices were pepper , cloves , maces , nutmegs , cinnamon and <unk> ginger : the drugs were <unk> , frankincense , <unk> , mirabilis , aloes <unk> , <unk> : the silks , <unk> , <unk> , alto <unk> , that is , counterfeit , cloth of gold , <unk> China silk , sleeved silk , white twisted silk , curled <unk> . The calicos were book @-@ calicos , calico @-@ <unk> , broad white calicos , fine starched <unk> , course white calicos , brown broad calicos , brown course calicos . There were also canopies , and course <unk> , quilts of course <unk> and of calico , carpets like those of <unk> ; whereunto are to be added the pearl , <unk> , civet , and amber @-@ <unk> . The rest of the wares were many in number , but less in value ; as elephants teeth , porcelain vessels of China , coco @-@ nuts , hides , <unk> as black as jet , bested of the same , cloth of the rind 's of trees very strange for the matter , and artificial in workmanship " . 
 There was also a <unk> and a document , printed at Macau in 1590 , containing valuable information on the China and Japan trade ; Hakluyt observed that it was " enclosed in a case of sweet Cedar wood , and lapped up almost an hundredfold in fine Calicut @-@ cloth , as though it had been some incomparable jewel " . 
 Madre de Deus entered Dartmouth harbor on 7 September , towering over the other ships and the town 's small houses as it sailed by . The only vessel guarding the great ship was Roebuck , as the other vessels had slipped off to Portsmouth to sell off some of the plunder . Nothing like Madre had ever been seen in England - the frame from the beakhead to the stern was 165 feet long . The breadth at the broadest deck , was just over 46 feet and her draft was twenty @-@ six feet at her arrival in Dartmouth . Her several decks ; consisted of a main orlop , three main decks , and a forecastle and a spar deck of two floors each . The length of the keel was 100 feet , the main @-@ mast was 121 feet , and its circumference at the partners was just over ten feet . The main @-@ yard was 106 feet long . 
 = = = Mass theft = = = 
 Madre de Deus attracted all manner of traders , dealers , <unk> and thieves from miles around , from as far as London and beyond . At seeing this huge vessel , pandemonium broke out amongst the townspeople ; they visited the floating castle and sought out drunken sailors in taverns and pubs , buying , stealing , pinching and fighting for the takings . Local fishermen as well ventured aboard , further depleting the cargo . 
 English law at the time provided that a large share of the loot was owed to the sovereign . When Queen Elizabeth discovered the extent of the theft , she sent Raleigh to reclaim her money and punish the looters . He swore , " If I meet any of them coming up , if it be upon the wildest heath in all the way , I mean to strip them as naked as they were ever born , for Her Majesty has been robbed and that of the most rare things . " By the time Raleigh had restored order , a cargo estimated at half a million pounds nearly , almost half the wealth of the English treasury at the time and perhaps the second @-@ largest treasure ever after the Ransom of Atahualpa , had been reduced to £ 140 @,@ 000 . Still , ten freighters were needed to carry the treasure around the coast and up the River Thames to London . In all the expedition as a whole yielded Elizabeth a 20 @-@ fold return on her investment . 
 Both Burrough and Clifford however were disappointed in what they were given and they and other investors contested their share . Clifford received nothing , although as special compensation , the queen allotted him a sum in consideration of his money venture . For Burrough there was no compensation , and bitter quarrels continued , leading to a fatal duel two years later . 
 = = Consequences = = 
 Alonso de Bazan , despite having a greater fleet , failed to intercept any English ship , lost two large carracks and was disgraced by the King of Spain for his negligence . By contrast the English learned that the fleet should not divide itself as had been done before capturing Madre de Deus , making a more effective force . When later ships were brought into the Thames for unloading , the dockers were made to dress in " suits of canvas doublet without pockets " to reduce opportunities for theft . 
 The taste of the riches of the East galvanized English interest in the region . Madre de Deus 's <unk> from Macau was a forerunner to voyages that would end up establishing the East India Company in 1600 . By 1603 the newly formed company itself would end up with a trading factory at Bantam . 
 = Castlevania : Aria of Sorrow = 
 Castlevania : Aria of Sorrow , released in Japan as Castlevania : Akatsuki no <unk> ( <unk> ～ <unk> ～ , " Castlevania : Minuet of Dawn " ) , is a side @-@ scrolling platforming video game developed and published by Konami for the Game Boy Advance . It is the third and final installment of the Castlevania series on the Game Boy Advance and was released in North America on May 6 , 2003 and in Japan on May 8 , 2003 . Producer Koji Igarashi , who had led the production teams for previous Castlevania titles , led Aria of Sorrow 's development as well . Michiru Yamane also returned to compose the music for the game alongside Takashi Yoshida and <unk> Hokkai . Director Junichi Murakami was new to the Castlevania series . 
 Aria of Sorrow is set in the year 2035 , when Dracula has long been sealed away after a battle in 1999 . The plot follows the journey of Soma Cruz , a teenager granted occult power as a result of being a potential vessel of Dracula 's reincarnation , as he battles dark figures that wish to inherit the undead lord 's power . The game incorporates the same combination of elements from platform games and role @-@ playing video games as in the previous game Castlevania : Symphony of the Night . Aria of Sorrow introduces several new features to the series , such as the " Tactical Soul " system and employs a futuristic storyline in contrast to the medieval setting of many other Castlevania games . 
 Although Aria of Sorrow sold poorly in Japan , selling only 27 @,@ 000 units nearly one month after its release , it was commercially successful in the United States , with more than 158 @,@ 000 units sold in the three months following its release . Aria of Sorrow received praise from several video game publications , with some considering it one of the best games in the Castlevania series since Symphony of the Night . Konami released a sequel to Aria of Sorrow , titled Castlevania : Dawn of Sorrow , on August 25 , 2005 in Japan . It incorporated many elements from its predecessor , including the " Tactical Soul " system . Aria of Sorrow was re @-@ released as part of Konami 's " Konami the Best " line on November 3 , 2005 in Japan , and in a dual pack with Harmony of Dissonance , titled the Castlevania Double Pack , in North America on January 11 , 2006 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Aria of Sorrow features a 2D side @-@ scrolling style of gameplay where the player controls the onscreen character from a third @-@ person perspective to interact with people , objects , and enemies . Like previous games in the series and most role @-@ playing games , characters level up each time they earn a set number of experience points from defeating enemies ; each " level " gained increases the character 's statistics , thus improving their performance in battle . <unk> examples include hit points , the amount of damage a character can receive ; magic points , which determine the number of times a character can use magical attacks ; strength , the power of a character 's physical attacks ; and intelligence , the power of a character 's magical spells . Upon encountering an enemy , the player can use a variety of weapons to attack and defeat the enemy . Despite the game being set in 2035 , the available weapons are largely medieval , including swords , axes , and spears ; though a handgun is available . These weapons differ in their damage output , the range of the weapon , and the speed of the attack . Items and other accessories can be found by defeating enemies or by purchasing items from the game 's shop . 
 Similar to previous games in the series , Aria of Sorrow is set within Dracula 's castle , which is further subdivided into several areas that the player traverses . These areas feature different components , such as different enemies , varying terrain characteristics , and a unique piece of theme music . Similar to most platform games , progression between areas is limited by the abilities the player currently has . While the method in which the player progresses through the game is initially linear , the player 's options become more diverse as the number of character abilities increases . 
 = = = Tactical Soul = = = 
 Aria of Sorrow introduces a new ability system , Tactical Soul system , to the Castlevania series . It involves absorbing the souls of enemies in order to gain additional abilities . Except for human enemies and the game 's final opponent , all souls can be absorbed by the player . The rate at which enemies ' souls are obtained varies between enemies . Players can trade souls between two Aria of Sorrow cartridges using two Game Boy Advance consoles and a link cable . 
 Souls provide a variety of effects , and are separated into four categories : Bullet , Guardian , Enchant , and Ability souls . The player can only have one type of Bullet , Guardian , and Enchant soul equipped at any given time . Bullet souls are Soma Cruz 's replacement for Sub Weapons in this game , and enable the player to consume a set amount of magic points to use an ability , often some form of projectile . Guardian souls provide continuous effects , including transforming into mythical creatures and summoning familiars . Guardian souls continually drain magic points so long as they are activated . Enchant souls are continuously active so long as they are equipped , and provide increases in statistics or other innate abilities — such as the ability to walk on water . Ability souls give the player innate abilities , which are often required to traverse certain areas of the castle . Because the souls are automatically activated and stay active unless the player specifically disables them , they do not consume magic points . 
 = = = Additional modes = = = 
 Aria of Sorrow includes additional modes of play that display elements not seen in the game 's primary scenario . The New Game + option allows a player that has completed the game to replay the game with all equipment and souls the player had acquired in a previous file . Additionally , the player can opt to start the game in Hard Mode , offering the same gameplay at a higher difficulty level . Two other modes offer alternatives to the standard gameplay . Boss Rush mode involves the player facing all of the game 's bosses in quick succession , and is unlocked after the player completes the game once . Julius Mode is an additional mode of play unlocked with the same method . The player takes control of Julius Belmont , the member of the Belmont clan featured in the game .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 Aria of Sorrow takes place in the fictional universe of the Castlevania series . The series ' premise is the conflict between the vampire hunters of the Belmont clan and the immortal vampire Dracula . Thirty @-@ six years before the start of Aria of Sorrow , Dracula was defeated once and for all by the Belmont clan , and his powers sealed into a solar eclipse . Shortly after Dracula 's death , a prophecy was made that Dracula 's reincarnation would come to his castle in 2035 and inherit all of Dracula 's powers . This prophecy acts as the driving force behind the plot of Aria of Sorrow , and is the primary motivation of the supporting characters to be present . The game takes place in Dracula 's castle , the most common setting for the series , with the castle divided into numerous areas that the player traverses over the course of the game . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 The protagonist and primary playable character of Aria of Sorrow is Soma Cruz , a transfer student studying in Japan who possesses the " power of dominance " , which allows him to absorb the souls of monsters and use their abilities . He is initially accompanied by his childhood friend , Mina Hakuba , the daughter of the priest of the Hakuba shrine . Over the course of the game , Soma meets additional characters that aid him in his quest : Genya Arikado , an enigmatic government agent and disguise for Alucard , the son of Dracula ; Yoko Belnades , a witch and member of the Belnades clan ; J , an amnesiac man drawn to Dracula 's castle ; and Hammer , a soldier of the United States Army ordered to investigate the events occurring at Dracula 's castle , although he abandons this mission and sets up a shop to sell Soma equipment ( potions , weapons and the like ) . Graham Jones , a missionary who believes he is Dracula 's reincarnation , serves as the game 's antagonist . 
 The characters were designed by Ayami Kojima , who had previously worked on the characters in Castlevania games such as Castlevania : Symphony of the Night and Castlevania : Harmony of Dissonance . Due to the game being set in the future , Kojima 's designs are notably more contemporary , utilizing modern clothing , in contrast to the medieval attire that characters from previous games wore .

 The story begins in the year 2035 , when Soma Cruz is visiting Japan as a transfer student and living near the Hakuba shrine . During a solar eclipse , he visits the Hakuba shrine with his childhood friend Mina Hakuba . He and Mina are then drawn into the eclipse , landing in a mysterious castle , where they meet a government agent named Genya Arikado . Arikado reveals that they are in Dracula 's castle . After a group of monsters appear and are dispatched by Arikado , one of the monsters ' souls is absorbed by Soma . Arikado explains this as the awakening of Soma 's " power of dominance " . Arikado then directs Soma to enter the castle and seek " the master 's chamber " . 
 As Soma proceeds through the castle , he confronts several characters , each present due to a prophecy related to Dracula 's powers . Graham Jones , a missionary that has come to the castle , befriends Soma . Graham explains the nature of the castle and reveals that Dracula , long thought to be immortal , was destroyed for good in 1999 , and that his powers will be passed down onto his reincarnation . When Soma proceeds further into the castle , he meets the witch Yoko Belnades , who is present on the orders of the Roman Catholic Church . Yoko is looking for Graham , who she believes is dangerous and the inheritor of Dracula 's powers . She clarifies the nature of Soma 's powers , revealing that they are not necessarily evil , but inherent to Soma himself . Later , Soma encounters Hammer , a member of the United States Army ordered to come to the Hakuba shrine . He has forfeited his mission , however , in favor of selling goods . He becomes Soma 's vendor , selling numerous goods to aid Soma 's mission . A mysterious man then accosts Soma , asking about the nature of Soma 's dark power . When Soma continues to converse with him , the man reveals that he has amnesia , and the only thing he remembers is his name starts with " J " . 
 Soma meets Graham again , and questions him on Yoko 's suspicions . Graham claims he will receive Dracula 's powers , believing himself to be Dracula as he was born on the day Dracula was slain . Graham inquires as to the nature of Soma 's powers , to which Soma responds that he has " the power to rule , " causing Graham to panic and flee . Concerned , Soma confides this incident to Yoko , who recommends that Soma join her in stopping Graham . As Soma proceeds further through the castle , he comes upon a scene of Graham stabbing Yoko with a knife . Graham retreats , and Yoko warns Soma of Graham 's power . Arikado arrives , promises Soma he will look after Yoko , and demands that Soma pursue Graham . Soma meets " J " again , who reveals he is Julius Belmont , the man who defeated Dracula in 1999 . As he leaves , he remarks that he knows something about the current situation , but does not elaborate . 
 Soma ascends to the castle 's keep and confronts Graham in the throne room . Although Soma 's sole desire is to leave the castle , Graham is convinced that Soma must be killed for absorbing the souls of the castle 's monsters . Soma manages to defeat Graham , even after Graham uses his newfound powers to assume a demonic form . As Graham falls in defeat , Soma absorbs his powers , and realizes he is Dracula 's reincarnation . Arikado arrives and reveals a way for Soma to save himself by halting the flow of chaos into the castle . Soma proceeds to the Chaotic Realm , but Julius attacks him , believing that Soma is Dracula . Julius allows Soma to defeat him , as he sensed Soma 's soul fighting against Dracula 's influence . Before he leaves , Soma elicits a promise from Julius to kill him if he fully becomes Dracula . Soma travels through the Chaotic Realm and finally locates the source of chaos . Soma manages to defeat the manifestation of chaos and is sent congratulations by Yoko , Hammer , Julius , and Arikado . Soma awakens back in the Hakuba Shrine with Mina , pleased that the conflict is over . 
 = = Development = = 
 Aria of Sorrow was first unveiled at a press conference in San Francisco by executive producer Koji Igarashi on January 16 , 2003 . Igarashi had worked on previous Castlevania games such as Castlevania : Symphony of the Night and Castlevania : Harmony of Dissonance . Aria of Sorrow was placed in production alongside Harmony of Dissonance , resulting in both games sharing similar programming engines and gameplay elements . Aria of Sorrow 's Ability souls , for example , provide the protagonist with innate abilities like the Relic items in Harmony of Dissonance . Nevertheless , Igarashi claimed he wished to try a " different route " for the series with Aria of Sorrow via placing the game in a futuristic setting . Ayami Kojima , who had previously collaborated with Igarashi on the designs for the characters of Symphony of the Night and Harmony of Dissonance , was brought into the project . Following the " different route " motif , the character designs were made more contemporary , using modern clothing over the more medieval look of the previous Castlevania installments . In developing the game 's back story , Igarashi partially based it on Nostradamus 's prediction of a " big evil lord in 1999 " and the 1999 solar eclipse in Eastern Europe . 
 One of Igarashi 's prominent concerns during development was addressing the criticism expressed concerning Harmony of Dissonance . Igarashi noted that the music in Harmony of Dissonance had not been well received and Michiru Yamane , who had previously worked on the acclaimed music for Symphony of the Night , was hired in order to compose for Aria of Sorrow . The development team worked on the game 's audio cycles , as well as delegating more cartridge space and processor cycles for the sound . Maintaining the visual quality of Harmony of Dissonance was a chief objective during development , as many reviewers had felt that Harmony of Dissonance had excelled in graphics at the cost of the audio . Furthermore , the staff tried to improve the series ' gameplay system while retaining fan @-@ favorite elements . Certain aspects that were missing in Harmony of Dissonance , such as hidden rooms , were incorporated into Aria of Sorrow . Igarashi added Soul trading via a link cable to assist players with collecting every soul in the game , which he believed would be cumbersome to accomplish alone . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Aria of Sorrow has received favorable reviews from several video game publications , with many comparing it to Castlevania : Symphony of the Night , widely considered the best game in the Castlevania series . Famitsu , considered to be one of the most respected video game news magazines in Japan , gave Aria of Sorrow a 36 / 40 , the highest score any game in the Castlevania series has received from Famitsu . It was rated by Nintendo Power as the 22nd best game made on a Nintendo System in their Top 200 Games list . In Japan , the game sold only 27 @,@ 000 units one month after its release , considered to be a poor showing for a major video game franchise . Conversely , the game was significantly more successful in the United States , with more than 158 @,@ 000 units in sales three months after its release . 
 As the third installment of the Castlevania series on the Game Boy Advance , many reviewers made note of the game 's differences as versus its predecessors , Castlevania : Circle of the Moon and Castlevania : Harmony of Dissonance , with many considering it the definitive Castlevania game for the Game Boy Advance . GameSpy noted that Aria of Sorrow " managed to get just about everything right " as versus its predecessors , and lauded it as " the best portable Castlevania game yet created . " RPGFan claimed that Aria of Sorrow " [ showcased ] the true art of game development : to adapt and change as necessary yet remain consistent . " RPGamer considered Aria of Sorrow one of the best games ever released for the Game Boy Advance . 
 In 2007 IGN ranked it as the second best Game Boy Advance game of all time . Game Informer 's Tim Turi ranked it among the best Castlevania games on the Game Boy Advance . He praised its gameplay and visuals for setting a standard for future Castlevania games . GameZone ranked it as the seventh best Castlevania title and the best of the Game Boy Advance Castlevania titles . 
 The gameplay , specifically the Tactical Soul system , was a frequent subject of acclaim among reviewers . RPGFan called the Tactical Soul system " addictively [ sic ] fun " , and GameSpot lauded the simplicity and depth of the gameplay . RPGamer considered the gameplay " one hundred percent solid , " lauding the game 's controls and interaction with enemies , as well as the Tactical Soul system . RPGFan asserted that the game had " a chance to be the most revered installment of the series , hardly caught in the shadow of Symphony of the Night like its predecessors . " The game 's length and difficulty were brought into question by several reviewers . GameSpot noted that a single play through the game would only last ten hours , and that the player grew " practically unstoppable " over the course of the game . RPGamer echoed this assessment , deriding the fact that the game " never [ offered ] much of a challenge " , but noted that the " simplistic fun " of the gameplay rectified this . 
 The game 's graphics and audio were widely praised by reviewers . RPGFan extolled the game 's environments as " gorgeous and well layered , " and noted while the game did not achieve the level of graphical quality set by Symphony of the Night , it " made a damn good attempt at it . " GameSpy called the graphics " crisp , clear and colorful , " with " good animation on easily viewable sprites . " GameSpy additionally noted that the game 's audio , a particularly lambasted feature of Harmony of Dissonance , was " fitting and well @-@ composed . " Prior to the game 's release , IGN commented that the music was " pretty darn good . " GameSpot , although labeling the music as " mostly forgettable , " noted that it was far better than the audio of Harmony of Dissonance , and celebrated the individual audio used for enemies . 
 In terms of storyline and characters , RPGamer welcomed the characters ' depth , and the emphasis placed into the personalities and development of supporting characters , asserting that previous Castlevania games ignored the development of the supporting characters in exchange for concentrating on the protagonist . IGN called the game 's ending " incredibly unfulfilling and disappointing , " but lauded the change from the conventional plot of a Castlevania game , in which a member of the Belmont clan defeats Dracula with the aid of a host of supporting characters . GameSpy criticized the presence of a " weak female who needs protection " and an " effeminate @-@ looking man who does all the slaying " as stereotypical Castlevania elements , but noted that the " powerful and compelling scenario " the game had was the best in the series since Symphony of the Night . 
 = = Sequel and re @-@ release = = 
 Due to the success of Aria of Sorrow , the production of Castlevania : Dawn of Sorrow , a rare sequel in the Castlevania series , was announced on January 6 , 2005 . In an interview , Koji Igarashi noted that he felt that the Tactical Soul system used in Aria of Sorrow , as well as the storyline with Soma Cruz , were a waste to use in only one game , and contributed to his desire to make a sequel . As such , the Tactical Soul system was reintroduced in Dawn of Sorrow , as well as several new developments , such as an anime character design , as Ayami Kojima was not part of the production staff for Dawn of Sorrow . Though Aria of Sorrow was successful , its sales figures failed to meet expectations and prompted the switch to anime @-@ style designs . In 2005 , Igarashi expressed a desire to develop a game centered on the battle between Julius Belmont and Dracula , but commented that the project would be dependent on available production time . Aria of Sorrow was re @-@ released in both Japan and in the United States . On November 3 , 2005 , it was re @-@ released as part of Konami 's " Konami the Best " line in Japan . Aria of Sorrow was re @-@ released , along with Harmony of Dissonance , in the Castlevania : Double Pack in North America on January 11 , 2006 . 
 = Mountjoy Prison helicopter escape = 
 The Mountjoy Prison helicopter escape occurred on 31 October 1973 when three Provisional Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) volunteers escaped from Mountjoy Prison in Dublin , Ireland , aboard a hijacked Alouette II helicopter , which briefly landed in the prison 's exercise yard . The escape made headlines around the world and was an embarrassment to the Irish coalition government of the time , led by Fine Gael 's Liam Cosgrave , which was criticised by opposition party Fianna Fáil . A manhunt involving twenty thousand members of the Irish Defence Forces and Garda Síochána was launched for the escapees , one of whom , Seamus Twomey , was not recaptured until December 1977 . The Wolfe Tones wrote a song celebrating the escape called " The Helicopter Song " , which topped the Irish popular music charts despite being banned by the government . 
 = = Background = = 
 Following the outbreak of the Troubles in 1969 , the Provisional IRA had conducted an armed campaign that sought to create a united Ireland by ending Northern Ireland 's status as part of the United Kingdom . As a result of increasing levels of violence in Northern Ireland , internment without trial was introduced there in August 1971 , and in the Republic of Ireland the coalition government led by Fine Gael 's Liam Cosgrave was attempting to curb IRA activity . Fine Gael had come to power on a law and order ticket , with a policy of " getting tough on crime " . Suspected IRA members were arrested and accused of IRA membership by a superintendent in the Garda Síochána , a crime under the Offences against the State Act . They were tried at the <unk> Special Criminal Court in Dublin , where the traditional IRA policy of not recognising the court resulted in a fait accompli as no defence was offered and IRA membership carried a minimum mandatory one @-@ year sentence , resulting in internment in all but name . In September 1973 IRA Chief of Staff Seamus Twomey appeared at the Special Criminal Court charged with IRA membership , and stated " I refuse to recognise this British @-@ orientated quisling court " . He was found guilty and received a five @-@ year sentence . By October 1973 the IRA 's command structure was seriously curbed , with Twomey and other senior republicans J. B. O 'Hagan and Kevin Mallon all being held in Mountjoy Prison . 
 = = Planning of the escape = = 
 The IRA immediately began making plans to break Twomey , O 'Hagan and Mallon out of the prison . The first attempt involved explosives that had been smuggled into the prison , which were to be used to blow a hole in a door which would give the prisoners access to the exercise yard . From there , they would scale a rope ladder thrown over the exterior wall by members of the IRA 's Dublin Brigade who would have a getaway car waiting to complete the escape . The plan failed when the prisoners could not gain access to the exercise yard and the rope ladder was spotted , so the IRA began making new escape plans . The idea of using a helicopter in an escape had been discussed before , an idea to break Gerry Adams out of Long Kesh internment camp had been ruled out because of faster and more sophisticated British Army helicopters being stationed at a nearby base . The IRA 's GHQ staff approved the plan to break out Twomey , O 'Hagan and Mallon , and arrangements were made to obtain a helicopter . A man with an American accent calling himself Mr. Leonard approached the manager of Irish Helicopters at Dublin Airport , with a view to hiring a helicopter for an aerial photographic shoot in County Laois . After being shown the company 's fleet of helicopters , Leonard arranged to hire a five @-@ seater Alouette II for 31 October . 
 = = The escape = = 
 Leonard arrived at Irish Helicopters on 31 October and was introduced to the pilot of the helicopter , Captain Thompson Boyes . Boyes was instructed to fly to a field in <unk> , in order to pick up Leonard 's photographic equipment . After landing Boyes saw two armed , masked men approaching the helicopter from nearby trees . Boyes was held at gunpoint and told he would not be harmed if he followed instructions . Leonard left with one gunman , while the other gunman climbed aboard the helicopter armed with a pistol and an Armalite rifle . Boyes was instructed to fly towards Dublin following the path of railway lines and the Royal Canal , and was ordered not to register his flight path with Air Traffic Control . As the helicopter approached Dublin , Boyes was informed of the escape plan and instructed to land in the exercise yard at Mountjoy Prison . 
 In the prison 's exercise yard , the prisoners were watching a football match . Shortly after 3 : 35 pm the helicopter swung in to land in the prison yard , with Kevin Mallon directing the pilot using semaphore . A prison officer on duty initially took no action as he believed the helicopter contained the Minister for Defence , Paddy Donegan . After prisoners surrounded the eight prison officers in the yard , fights broke out as the officers realised an escape attempt was in progress . As other prisoners restrained the officers , Twomey , Mallon and O 'Hagan boarded the helicopter . As the helicopter took off , in the confusion one officer shouted " Close the gates , close the fucking gates " . The helicopter flew north and landed at a disused racecourse in the <unk> area of Dublin , where the escapees were met by members of the IRA 's Dublin Brigade . The escapees were transferred to a taxi that had been hijacked earlier , and transported to safe houses . 
 = = Reaction = = 
 The escape made headlines around the world and was an embarrassment for Cosgrave 's government , which was criticised for " incompetence in security matters " by opposition party Fianna Fáil . An emergency debate on security was held in Dáil Éireann on 1 November , where leader of the opposition Jack Lynch stated : 
 It is poetic justice that a helicopter is now at the heart of the Government 's embarrassment and in the centre of their dilemma . Indeed , it was hard to blame the prison officer who observed that he thought it was the Minister for Defence paying an informal visit to Mountjoy Prison yesterday because , of course , we all know the Minister for Defence is wont to use helicopters , as somebody observed already , as other Ministers are wont to use State cars . 
 The IRA released a statement on the escape , which read , " Three republican prisoners were rescued by a special unit from Mountjoy Prison on Wednesday . The operation was a complete success and the men are now safe , despite a massive hunt by Free State forces " . Shortly after the escape Twomey gave an exclusive interview to German magazine Der Spiegel , where the reporter said people throughout Europe were joking about the incident as " the escape of the century " . Irish rebel band the Wolfe Tones wrote a song celebrating the escape called " The Helicopter Song " , which was immediately banned by the government yet still topped the Irish popular music charts after selling twelve thousand copies in a single week . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The escape resulted in all IRA prisoners being held at Mountjoy Prison and Curragh Camp being transferred to the maximum security Portlaoise Prison . In order to prevent any further escapes the perimeter of the prison was guarded by members of the Irish Army , and wires were erected over the prison yard to prevent any future helicopter escape . Cosgrave stated there would be " no hiding place " for the escapees , and a manhunt involving twenty thousand members of the Irish Defence Forces and Garda Síochána ensued . Mallon was recaptured at a Gaelic Athletic Association dance in a hotel near Portlaoise on 10 December 1973 , and imprisoned in Portlaoise Prison . He escaped from there in a mass break @-@ out on 18 August 1974 , when nineteen prisoners escaped after overpowering guards and using gelignite to blast through the gates . He was recaptured in <unk> in January 1975 and returned to Portlaoise Prison . O 'Hagan was recaptured in Dublin in early 1975 , and also imprisoned in Portlaoise Prison . After the end of his original twelve @-@ month sentence , he was immediately arrested and sentenced to a further two years imprisonment for escaping . Twomey evaded recapture until 2 December 1977 , when he was spotted sitting in a car in Sandycove by members of the Garda 's Special Branch who were investigating an arms shipment after a tip @-@ off from police in Belgium . Twomey drove away after spotting the officers , before being recaptured in the centre of Dublin after a high @-@ speed car chase . He was also imprisoned in Portlaoise Prison until his release in 1982 .

The band used this name for a while until Lennon decided to change the name to " the Beatles " , from the word beat . As a member of the group when it was a five @-@ piece band , Sutcliffe is one of several people sometimes referred to as the " Fifth Beatle " . 
 When he performed with the Beatles in Hamburg , he met photographer Astrid Kirchherr , to whom he was later engaged . After leaving the Beatles , he enrolled in the Hamburg College of Art , studying under future pop artist Eduardo Paolozzi , who later wrote a report stating that Sutcliffe was one of his best students . Sutcliffe earned other praise for his paintings , which mostly explored a style related to abstract expressionism . 
 While studying in Germany , Sutcliffe began experiencing severe headaches and acute sensitivity to light . In April 1962 he collapsed in the middle of an art class after complaining of head pains . German doctors performed various checks , but were unable to determine the exact cause of his headaches . On 10 April 1962 , he was taken to hospital , but died in the ambulance on the way . The cause of death was later revealed to have been an aneurysm in his brain 's right hemisphere . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Sutcliffe 's father , Charles Sutcliffe ( 25 May 1905 – 18 March 1966 ) , was previously married to his first wife Martha with whom he already had 4 children . He was a senior civil servant , who moved to Liverpool to help with wartime work in 1943 , and then signed on as a ship 's engineer , and so was often at sea during his son 's early years . His mother , Millie , was a schoolteacher at an infants ' school . Sutcliffe had two younger sisters , Pauline and Joyce with but also had three older brothers , Joe , Ian , and Charles , as well as an older sister Mattie , from his father 's first marriage . 
 Sutcliffe was born at the Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion Hospital in Edinburgh , Scotland , and after his family moved south , he was brought up at 37 Aigburth Drive in Liverpool . He attended Park View Primary School , Huyton ( 1946 – 1951 ) , and Prescot Grammar School from 4 September 1951 to 1956 . When Sutcliffe 's father did return home on leave , he invited his son and art college classmate , Rod Murray ( also Sutcliffe 's roommate and best friend ) , for a " real good booze @-@ up " , slipping £ 10 into Sutcliffe 's pocket before disappearing for another six months . The Beatles ' biographer , Philip Norman , wrote that Charles Sutcliffe was a heavy drinker and physically cruel to his wife , which the young Sutcliffe had witnessed . 
 During his first year at the Liverpool College of Art , Sutcliffe worked as a bin man on the Liverpool Corporation 's waste collection trucks . Lennon was introduced to Sutcliffe by Bill Harry , a mutual friend , when all three were studying at the Liverpool College of Art . According to Lennon , Sutcliffe had a " marvellous art portfolio " and was a very talented painter who was one of the " stars " of the school . He helped Lennon to improve his artistic skills , and with others , worked with him when Lennon had to submit work for exams . Sutcliffe shared a flat with Murray at 9 Percy Street , Liverpool , before being evicted and moving to Hillary Mansions at 3 Gambier Terrace , where another art student lived , Margaret Chapman , who competed with Sutcliffe to be the best painter in class . The flat was opposite the new Anglican cathedral in the rundown area of Liverpool 8 , with bare lightbulbs and a mattress on the floor in the corner . Lennon moved in with Sutcliffe in early 1960 . ( Paul McCartney later admitted that he was jealous of Sutcliffe 's relationship with Lennon , as he had to take a " back seat " to Sutcliffe ) . Sutcliffe and his flatmates painted the rooms yellow and black , which their landlady did not appreciate . On another occasion the tenants , needing to keep warm , burned the flat 's furniture . 
 After talking to Sutcliffe one night at the Casbah Coffee Club ( owned by Pete Best 's mother , Mona Best ) , Lennon and McCartney persuaded Sutcliffe to buy a Höfner President 500 / 5 model bass guitar on hire @-@ purchase from Frank Hessey 's Music Shop . Sutcliffe was versed in music : he had sung in the local church choir in Huyton , his mother had insisted on piano lessons for him since the age of nine , he had played bugle in the Air Training Corps , and his father had taught him some chords on the guitar . In May 1960 , Sutcliffe joined Lennon , McCartney , and George Harrison ( then known as " the Silver Beatles " ) . Sutcliffe 's fingers would often blister during long rehearsals , as he had never practised long enough for his fingers to become <unk> , even though he had previously played acoustic guitar . Sutcliffe started acting as a booking agent for the group , and they often used his Gambier Terrace flat as a rehearsal room . 
 In July 1960 , the Sunday newspaper , The People , ran an article entitled " The Beatnik Horror " that featured a photograph taken in the flat below Sutcliffe 's of a teenaged Lennon lying on the floor , with Sutcliffe standing by a window . As they had often visited the Jacaranda club , its owner , Allan Williams , arranged for the photograph to be taken , subsequently taking over from Sutcliffe to book concerts for the group : Lennon , McCartney , Harrison and Sutcliffe . The Beatles ' subsequent name change came during an afternoon in the Renshaw Hall bar when Sutcliffe , Lennon and his girlfriend , Cynthia Powell , thought up names similar to Holly 's band , the Crickets , and came up with Beetles . Lennon later changed the name because he thought it sounded French , suggesting Le Beat or Beat @-@ less . 
 = = The Beatles and Hamburg = = 
 Sutcliffe 's playing style was elementary , mostly sticking to root notes of chords . Harry — an art school friend and founder and editor of the Mersey Beat newspaper — complained to Sutcliffe that he should be concentrating on art and not music , as he thought that Sutcliffe was a competent musician whose talents would be better used in the visual arts . While Sutcliffe is often described in Beatles ' biographies as appearing very uncomfortable onstage , and often playing with his back to the audience , their drummer at the time , Best , denies this , recalling Sutcliffe as usually good @-@ natured and " animated " before an audience . When the Beatles auditioned for Larry Parnes at the Wyvern Club , Seel Street , Liverpool , Williams later claimed that Parnes would have taken the group as the backing band for Billy Fury for £ 10 per week , but as Sutcliffe turned his back to Parnes throughout the audition — because , as Williams believed , Sutcliffe could not play very well — Parnes said that he would employ the group only if they got rid of Sutcliffe . Parnes later denied this , stating his only concern was that the group had no permanent drummer . Klaus Voormann regarded Sutcliffe as a good bass player , although Beatles ' historian Richie Unterberger described Sutcliffe 's bass playing as an " artless thump " . 
 Sutcliffe 's popularity grew after he began wearing Ray @-@ Ban sunglasses and tight trousers . Sutcliffe 's high spot was singing " Love Me Tender " , which drew more applause than the other Beatles , and increased the friction between him and McCartney . Lennon also started to criticise Sutcliffe , making jokes about Sutcliffe 's size and playing . On 5 December 1960 , Harrison was sent back to Britain for being under @-@ age . McCartney and Best were deported for attempted arson at the Bambi Kino , which left Lennon and Sutcliffe in Hamburg . Lennon took a train home , but as Sutcliffe had a cold he stayed in Hamburg . Sutcliffe later borrowed money from his girlfriend , Astrid Kirchherr , in order to fly back to Liverpool on Friday , 20 January 1961 , although he returned to Hamburg in March 1961 , with the other Beatles . 
 In July 1961 , Sutcliffe decided to leave the group to continue painting . After being awarded a postgraduate scholarship , he enrolled at the Hamburg College of Art under the tutelage of Paolozzi . He briefly lent McCartney his bass until the latter could earn enough to buy a specially made smaller left @-@ handed Höfner 500 / 1 bass guitar of his own in June 1961 , but specifically asked McCartney ( who is left @-@ handed ) not to change the strings around or <unk> the instrument , so McCartney had to play the bass as it was . In 1967 , a photo of Sutcliffe was among those on the cover of the Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band album ( extreme left , in front of fellow artist Aubrey Beardsley ) . 
 = = Astrid Kirchherr = = 
 Kirchherr was brought up by her widowed mother , <unk> Kirchherr , in <unk> Strasse , in a wealthy part of the Hamburg suburb of Altona . Sutcliffe met Kirchherr in the Kaiserkeller club , where she went to watch the Beatles perform . After a photo session with the group , Kirchherr invited them to her mother 's house for tea and showed them her bedroom ; decorated in black , including the furniture , with silver foil on the walls and a large tree branch hanging from the ceiling . Sutcliffe began dating Kirchherr shortly thereafter . 
 Sutcliffe wrote to friends that he was infatuated with Kirchherr , and asked her German friends which colours , films , books and painters she liked . Best commented that the beginning of their relationship was , " like one of those fairy stories " . Kirchherr and Sutcliffe got engaged in November 1960 , and exchanged rings , as is the German custom . Sutcliffe later wrote to his parents that he was engaged to Kirchherr , which they were shocked to learn , as they thought he would give up his career as an artist , although he told Kirchherr that he would like to be an art teacher in London or Germany in the future . After moving into the Kirchherr family 's house , Sutcliffe used to borrow her clothes . He wore her leather pants and jackets , collarless jackets , oversized shirts and long scarves , and also borrowed a corduroy suit with no lapels that he wore on stage , which prompted Lennon to sarcastically ask if his mother had lent him the suit . 
 = = Art = = 
 Sutcliffe displayed artistic talent at an early age . Helen Anderson ( a fellow student ) , remembered his early works as being very aggressive , with dark , moody colours , which was not the type of painting she expected from such a " quiet student " . One of Sutcliffe 's paintings was shown at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool as part of the John Moores exhibition , from November 1959 until January 1960 . After the exhibition , Moores bought Sutcliffe 's canvas for £ 65 , which was then equal to 6 – 7 weeks ' wages for an average working man . The picture Moore bought was called Summer Painting , and Sutcliffe attended a formal dinner to celebrate the exhibition with another art student , Susan Williams . Murray remembered that the painting was painted on a board , not a canvas , and had to be cut into two pieces ( because of its size ) and hinged . Murray added that only one of the pieces actually got to the exhibition ( because they stopped off in a pub to celebrate ) , but sold nonetheless because Moores bought it for his son . 
 Sutcliffe had been turned down when he applied to study for an ATD ( Art Teachers Diploma ) course at the Liverpool Art College , but after meeting Kirchherr , he decided to leave the Beatles and attend the Hamburg College of Art in June 1961 , under the tutelage of Paolozzi , who later wrote a report stating that Sutcliffe was one of his best students . He wrote : " Sutcliffe is very gifted and very intelligent . In the meantime he has become one of my best students . " 
 Sutcliffe 's few surviving works reveal influence from the British and European abstract artists contemporary with the Abstract Expressionist movement in the United States . His earlier figurative work is reminiscent of the kitchen sink school , particularly of John <unk> , though Sutcliffe was producing abstract work by the end of the 1950s , including The Summer Painting , purchased by Moores . Sutcliffe 's works bear some comparison with those of John Hoyland and Nicolas de Staël , though they are more lyrical ( Sutcliffe used the stage name " Stu de Staël " when he was playing with the Beatles on a Scottish tour in spring 1960 ) . His later works are typically untitled , constructed from heavily <unk> slabs of pigment in the manner of de Staël , whom he learned about from Surrey born , art college instructor , Nicky Horsfield , and overlaid with scratched or squeezed linear elements creating enclosed spaces . Hamburg Painting no . 2 was purchased by Liverpool 's Walker Art Gallery and is one of a series entitled Hamburg in which the surface and colour changes produced atmospheric energy . European artists ( including Paolozzi ) were also influencing Sutcliffe at the time . The Walker Art Gallery has other works by Sutcliffe , which are Self @-@ portrait ( in charcoal ) and The Crucifixion . Lennon later hung a pair of Sutcliffe 's paintings in his house ( Kenwood ) in Weybridge , and McCartney had a Paolozzi sculpture in his Cavendish Avenue home . 
 = = Death = = 
 While in Germany , Sutcliffe began experiencing severe headaches and acute sensitivity to light , and Kirchherr stated that some of the headaches left him temporarily blind . In 1962 , Sutcliffe collapsed in the middle of an art class in Hamburg . Kirchherr 's mother had German doctors perform various checks on him , but they were unable to determine exactly what was causing the headaches . They suggested he go back to Britain and have himself checked into a hospital with better facilities , but Sutcliffe was told there was nothing wrong with him , so he returned to Hamburg . While living at the <unk> ' house his condition got worse , and after collapsing again on 10 April 1962 , he was taken to hospital by Kirchherr ( who rode with him in the ambulance ) , but he died before the ambulance reached the hospital . The cause of death was revealed to have been a cerebral haemorrhage , specifically , a ruptured aneurysm resulting in " cerebral paralysis due to bleeding into the right ventricle of the brain . " 
 On 13 April 1962 , Kirchherr met the group at Hamburg Airport , telling them that Sutcliffe had died a few days before . Sutcliffe 's mother flew to Hamburg with the Beatles ' manager Brian Epstein , and returned to Liverpool with her son 's body . Sutcliffe 's father did not hear of his son 's death for three weeks , as he was sailing to South America , although the family arranged for a padre to tell him when he docked in Buenos Aires . After Sutcliffe 's death , Kirchherr wrote a letter to his mother , apologising for being too ill to attend his funeral in Liverpool and saying how much she and Lennon missed him : " Oh , Mum , he ( Lennon ) is in a terrible mood now , he just can 't believe that darling Stuart never comes back . [ He 's ] just crying his eyes out ... John is marvellous to me , he says that he knows Stuart so much and he loves him so much that he can understand me . " 
 The cause of Sutcliffe 's aneurysm is unknown , although it is believed to have been started by an earlier head injury , as he was either kicked in the head , or thrown , head first , against a brick wall during a fight outside <unk> Hall , after a performance in January 1961 . According to former manager Allan Williams , Lennon and Best went to Sutcliffe 's aid , fighting off his attackers before dragging him to safety . Sutcliffe sustained a fractured skull in the fight and Lennon 's little finger was broken . Sutcliffe refused medical attention at the time and failed to keep an X @-@ ray appointment at Sefton General Hospital . 
 Although Lennon did not attend or send flowers to Sutcliffe 's funeral , his second wife , Yoko Ono , remembered that Lennon mentioned Sutcliffe 's name very often , saying that he was " [ My ] alter ego ... a spirit in his world ... a guiding force " .

 The Beatles ' compilation album Anthology 1 , released in 1995 , featured previously unreleased recordings from the group 's early years . Sutcliffe plays bass with the Beatles on three songs they recorded in 1960 : " Hallelujah , I Love Her So " , " You 'll Be Mine " , and " Cayenne " . In addition , he is pictured on the front covers of both Anthology 1 and Anthology 3 . 
 In 2011 , Sutcliffe 's estate released a recording claimed to be Sutcliffe singing " Love Me Tender " , recorded in 1961 and donated to the estate in 2009 . The cover art shows a Sutcliffe painting entitled Homage to Elvis . The authenticity of the recording has been much debated .

 Part One of the The Beatles Anthology video documentary covers Sutcliffe 's time with the group . There is no mention of his death in the documentary , but it is discussed in the accompanying book . 
 Sutcliffe was portrayed by David Nicholas Wilkinson in the film Birth of the Beatles ( 1979 ) and by Lee Williams in In His Life : The John Lennon Story ( 2000 ) . Sutcliffe 's role in the Beatles ' early career , as well as the factors that led him to leave the group , is dramatised in the film Backbeat ( 1994 ) , in which he was portrayed by American actor Stephen Dorff . Sutcliffe doesn 't appear in the film Nowhere Boy ( 2009 ) but is briefly mentioned toward the end of the film . Four television documentaries have been broadcast that deal with Sutcliffe 's life :

 In chemistry , a nonmetal ( or non @-@ metal ) is a chemical element that mostly lacks metallic attributes . Physically , nonmetals tend to be highly volatile ( easily vaporized ) , have low elasticity , and are good insulators of heat and electricity ; chemically , they tend to have high ionization energy and electronegativity values , and gain or share electrons when they react with other elements or compounds . Seventeen elements are generally classified as nonmetals ; most are gases ( hydrogen , helium , nitrogen , oxygen , fluorine , neon , chlorine , argon , krypton , xenon and radon ) ; one is a liquid ( bromine ) , and a few are solids ( carbon , phosphorus , sulfur , selenium , and iodine ) . 
 Moving rightward across the standard form of the periodic table , nonmetals adopt structures that have progressively fewer nearest neighbours . Polyatomic nonmetals have structures with either three nearest neighbours , as is the case ( for example ) with carbon ( in its standard state of graphite ) , or two nearest neighbours ( for example ) in the case of sulfur . Diatomic nonmetals , such as hydrogen , have one nearest neighbour , and the monatomic noble gases , such as helium , have none . This gradual fall in the number of nearest neighbours is associated with a reduction in metallic character and an increase in nonmetallic character . The distinction between the three categories of nonmetals , in terms of receding metallicity is not absolute . Boundary overlaps occur as outlying elements in each category show ( or begin to show ) less @-@ distinct , hybrid @-@ like or atypical properties . 
 Although five times more elements are metals than nonmetals , two of the nonmetals — hydrogen and helium — make up over 99 per cent of the observable Universe , and one — oxygen — makes up close to half of the Earth 's crust , oceans and atmosphere . Living organisms are also composed almost entirely of nonmetals , and nonmetals form many more compounds than metals . 
 = = Definition and properties = = 
 There is no rigorous definition of a nonmetal . They show more variability in their properties than do metals . The following are some of the chief characteristics of nonmetals . Physically , they largely exist as monatomic gases , with a few having more substantial ( but still open @-@ packed ) diatomic or polyatomic forms , unlike metals , which are nearly all solid and close @-@ packed ; if solid , they generally have a <unk> or dull appearance and are brittle , as opposed to metals , which are lustrous , ductile or malleable ; they usually have lower densities than metals ; are poor conductors of heat and electricity when compared to metals ; and have significantly lower melting points and boiling points than those of metals ( with the exception of carbon ) . Chemically , the nonmetals have relatively high ionisation energy and high electronegativity ; they usually exist as anions or oxyanions in aqueous solution ; generally form ionic or interstitial compounds when mixed with metals , unlike metals , which form alloys ; and have acidic oxides whereas the common oxides of the metals are basic . 
 = = Applicable elements = = 
 The elements generally classified as nonmetals include one element in group 1 ( hydrogen ) ; one in group 14 ( carbon ) ; two in group 15 ( nitrogen and phosphorus ) ; three in group 16 ( oxygen , sulfur and selenium ) ; most of group 17 ( fluorine , chlorine , bromine and iodine ) ; and all of group 18 ( with the possible exception of ununoctium ) . 
 The distinction between nonmetals and metals is by no means clear . The result is that a few borderline elements lacking a preponderance of either nonmetallic or metallic properties are classified as metalloids ; and some elements classified as nonmetals are instead sometimes classified as metalloids , or vice versa . For example , selenium ( Se ) , a nonmetal , is sometimes classified instead as a metalloid , particularly in environmental chemistry ; and astatine ( At ) , which is a metalloid and a halogen , is sometimes classified instead as a nonmetal . 
 = = Categories = = 
 Nonmetals have structures in which each atom usually forms ( 8 − N ) bonds with ( 8 − N ) nearest neighbours , where N is the number of valence electrons . Each atom is thereby able to complete its valence shell and attain a stable noble gas configuration . Exceptions to the ( 8 − N ) rule occur with hydrogen ( which only needs one bond to complete its valence shell ) , carbon , nitrogen and oxygen . Atoms of the latter three elements are sufficiently small such that they are able to form alternative ( more stable ) bonding structures , with fewer nearest neighbours . Thus , carbon is able to form its layered graphite structure , and nitrogen and oxygen are able to form diatomic molecules having triple and double bonds , respectively . The larger size of the remaining non @-@ noble nonmetals weakens their capacity to form multiple bonds and they instead form two or more single bonds to two or more different atoms . Sulfur , for example , forms an eight @-@ membered molecule in which the atoms are arranged in a ring , with each atom forming two single bonds to different atoms . 
 From left to right across the standard form of periodic table , as metallic character decreases , nonmetals therefore adopt structures that show a gradual reduction in the numbers of nearest neighbours — three or two for the polyatomic nonmetals , through one for the diatomic nonmetals , to zero for the monatomic noble gases . A similar pattern occurs more generally , at the level of the entire periodic table , in comparing metals and nonmetals . There is a transition from metallic bonding among the metals on the left of the table through to covalent or Van der Waals ( electrostatic ) bonding among the nonmetals on the right of the table . Metallic bonding tends to involve close @-@ packed centrosymmetric structures with a high number of nearest neighbours . Post @-@ transition metals and metalloids , sandwiched between the true metals and the nonmetals , tend to have more complex structures with an intermediate number of nearest neighbours . <unk> bonding , towards the right of the table , features open @-@ packed directional ( or disordered ) structures with fewer or zero nearest neighbours . As noted , this steady reduction in the number of nearest neighbours , as metallic character decreases and nonmetallic character increases , is mirrored among the nonmetals , the structures of which gradually change from polyatomic , to diatomic , to monatomic . 
 As is the case with the major categories of metals , metalloids and nonmetals , there is some variation and overlapping of properties within and across each category of nonmetal . Among the polyatomic nonmetals , carbon , phosphorus and selenium — which border the metalloids — begin to show some metallic character . Sulfur ( which borders the diatomic nonmetals ) , is the least metallic of the polyatomic nonmetals but even here shows some discernible metal @-@ like character ( discussed below ) . Of the diatomic nonmetals , iodine is the most metallic . Its number of nearest neighbours is sometimes described as 1 + 2 hence it is almost a polyatomic nonmetal . Within the iodine molecule , significant electronic interactions occur with the two next nearest neighbours of each atom , and these interactions give rise , in bulk iodine , to a shiny appearance and semiconducting properties . Of the monatomic nonmetals , radon is the most metallic and begins to show some cationic behaviour , which is unusual for a nonmetal . 
 = = = Polyatomic nonmetals = = = 
 Four nonmetals are distinguished by polyatomic bonding in their standard states , in either discrete or extended molecular forms : carbon ( C , as graphite sheets ) ; phosphorus ( as P4 molecules ) ; sulfur ( as S8 molecules ) ; and selenium ( Se , as helical chains ) . Consistent with their higher coordination numbers ( 2 or 3 ) , the polyatomic nonmetals show more metallic character than the neighbouring diatomic nonmetals ; they are all solid , mostly semi @-@ lustrous semiconductors with electronegativity values that are intermediate to moderately high ( 2 @.@ 19 – 2 @.@ 58 ) . Sulfur is the least metallic of the polyatomic nonmetals given its dull appearance , brittle comportment , and low conductivity — attributes common to all sulfur allotropes . It nevertheless shows some metallic character , either intrinsically or in its compounds with other nonmetals . Examples include the malleability of plastic sulfur and the lustrous @-@ bronze appearance and metallic conductivity of <unk> nitride ( <unk> ) . 
 The polyatomic nonmetals are distinguished from the diatomic nonmetals by virtue of having higher coordination numbers , higher melting points ( in their thermodynamically most stable forms ) , and higher boiling points ; and having wider liquid ranges and lower room temperature volatility . More generally they show a marked tendency to exist in allotropic forms , and a stronger inclination to catenate ; and have a weaker ability to form hydrogen bonds . The ability of carbon to catenate , in particular , is fundamental to the field of organic chemistry and life on Earth . All of the polyatomic nonmetals are solids , and all are known in either malleable , pliable or ductile forms ; most also have lower ionisation energies and electronegativities than those of the diatomic nonmetals . 
 = = = Diatomic nonmetals = = = 
 Seven nonmetals exist as diatomic molecules in their standard states : hydrogen ( H2 ) ; nitrogen ( N2 ) ; oxygen ( O2 ) ; fluorine ( F2 ) ; chlorine ( Cl2 ) ; bromine ( Br2 ) ; and iodine ( I2 ) . They are generally highly insulating , highly electronegative , non @-@ reflective gases , noting that bromine , a liquid , and iodine , a solid , are both volatile at room temperature . Exceptions to this generalised description occur at the boundaries of the category : hydrogen has a comparatively low electronegativity due to its unique atomic structure ; iodine , in crystalline form , is semi @-@ lustrous , and a semiconductor in the direction of its layers , both of these attributes being consistent with incipient metallic character . 
 The diatomic nonmetals are distinguished from the polyatomic nonmetals by virtue of having lower coordination numbers , lower melting points ( compared to the polyatomic nonmetals in their thermodynamically most stable forms ) , and lower boiling points ; and having narrower liquid ranges and greater room temperature volatility . More generally , they show less inclination to exist in allotropic forms , and to catenate ; and have a stronger ability to form hydrogen bonds . Most are also gases , and have higher ionisation energies and higher electronegativities than those of the polyatomic nonmetals . 
 = = = Noble gases = = = 
 Six nonmetals occur naturally as monatomic noble gases : helium ( He ) , neon ( Ne ) , argon ( Ar ) , krypton ( Kr ) , xenon ( Xe ) , and the radioactive radon ( Rn ) . They comprise a group of chemical elements with very similar properties . In their standard states they are all colorless , odourless , nonflammable gases with characteristically very low chemical reactivity . 
 With their closed valence shells , the noble gases have the highest first ionization potentials in each of their periods , and feeble interatomic forces of attraction , with the latter property resulting in very low melting and boiling points . That is why they are all gases under standard conditions , even those with atomic masses larger than many normally solid elements . 
 The status of the period 7 congener of the noble gases , element 118 ( temporary name ununoctium ) is not known — it may or may not be a noble gas . It was originally predicted to be a noble gas but may instead be a fairly reactive solid with an anomalously low first ionisation potential , due to relativistic effects . On the other hand , if relativistic effects peak in period 7 at element 112 , copernicium ( as is thought to be the case ) , element 118 may turn out to be a noble gas after all , albeit more reactive than either xenon or radon . 
 = = = Elemental gases = = = 
 Hydrogen , nitrogen , oxygen , fluorine , chlorine , plus the noble gases are collectively referred to as the elemental gases . These elements are gaseous at standard temperature and pressure ( STP ) . They are also distinguished by having the lowest densities , lowest melting and boiling points , strongest insulating properties , and highest electronegativity and ionization energy values in the periodic table . 
 It is not known if any synthetic elements with atomic number above 99 are gases . If it transpires that copernicium and flerovium are gaseous metals at or near room temperature , as some calculations have suggested , the category of elemental gases may need to be sub @-@ divided into metallic and nonmetallic gases . 
 = = = <unk> , <unk> and <unk> = = = 
 Carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , phosphorus and sulfur are sometimes referred to or categorised as <unk> , <unk> elements or <unk> . Collectively these six nonmetals are required for all life on Earth . They are further distinguished — in comparison to the halogens ( F , Cl , Br , I , At ) and noble gases — by their general capacity ( or potential ) to form allotropes ; high atomisation energies ; intermediate electron affinities ; reactivity combined with low toxicity ; ability to form alloys with metals ; and the weak or neutral acid @-@ base character of their group hydrides . 
 = = = Other nonmetals = = = 
 Selenium , and possibly boron , silicon , arsenic and tellurium , plus the <unk> elements are sometimes categorized together as other nonmetals . The first five of these ( Se ; B , Si , As , Te ) differ from the <unk> : none are universally required for life ; arsenic is notoriously poisonous ; and tellurium hydride is a fairly strong , rather than weak , acidic hydride .

 Characteristic and other properties of polyatomic nonmetals , diatomic nonmetals , and the monatomic noble gases are summarized in the following table . Physical properties are listed in loose order of ease of determination ; chemical properties run from general to specific , and then to descriptive . 
 = = Allotropes = = 
 Many nonmetals have less stable allotropes , with either nonmetallic or metallic properties . Graphite , the standard state of carbon , has a lustrous appearance and is a fairly good electrical conductor . The diamond allotrope of carbon is clearly nonmetallic , however , being translucent and having a relatively poor electrical conductivity . Carbon is also known in several other allotropic forms , including semiconducting buckminsterfullerene ( C60 ) . Nitrogen can form gaseous <unk> ( N4 ) , an unstable polyatomic molecule with a lifetime of about one microsecond . Oxygen is a diatomic molecule in its standard state ; it also exists as ozone ( O3 ) , an unstable polyatomic nonmetallic allotrope with a half @-@ life of around half an hour . Phosphorus , uniquely , exists in several allotropic forms that are more stable than that of its standard state as white phosphorus ( P4 ) . The red and black allotropes are probably the best known ; both are semiconductors ; black phosphorus , in addition , has a lustrous appearance . Phosphorus is also known as <unk> ( P2 ) , an unstable diatomic allotrope . Sulfur has more allotropes than any other element ; all of these , except plastic sulfur ( a metastable ductile mixture of allotropes ) have nonmetallic properties . Selenium has several nonmetallic allotropes , all of which are much less electrically conducting than its standard state of grey " metallic " selenium . Iodine is also known in a semiconducting amorphous form . Under sufficiently high pressures , just over half of the nonmetals , starting with phosphorus at 1 @.@ 7 GPa , have been observed to form metallic allotropes . 
 = = Abundance and extraction = = 
 Hydrogen and helium are estimated to make up approximately 99 per cent of all ordinary matter in the universe . Less than five per cent of the Universe is believed to be made of ordinary matter , represented by stars , planets and living beings . The balance is made of dark energy and dark matter , both of which are poorly understood at present . 
 Hydrogen , carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen constitute the great bulk of the Earth 's atmosphere , oceans , crust , and biosphere ; the remaining nonmetals have abundances of 0 @.@ 5 per cent or less . In comparison , 35 per cent of the crust is made up of the metals sodium , magnesium , aluminium , potassium and iron ; together with a metalloid , silicon . All other metals and metalloids have abundances within the crust , oceans or biosphere of 0 @.@ 2 per cent or less . 
 Nonmetals , in their elemental forms , are extracted from : brine : Cl , Br , I ; liquid air : N , O , Ne , Ar , Kr , Xe ; minerals : C ( coal ; diamond ; graphite ) ; F ( fluorite ) ; P ( phosphates ) ; I ( in sodium iodate <unk> and sodium iodide NaI ) ; natural gas : H , He , S ; and from ores , as processing byproducts : Se ( especially copper ores ) ; and Rn ( uranium bearing ores ) .

 For prevalent and speciality applications of individual nonmetals see the main article for each element . 
 Nonmetals do not have any universal or near @-@ universal applications . This is not the case with metals , most of which have structural uses ; nor the metalloids , the typical uses of which extend to ( for example ) oxide glasses , alloying components , and semiconductors . 
 Shared applications of different subsets of the nonmetals instead encompass their presence in , or specific uses in the fields of cryogenics and refrigerants : H , He , N , O , F and Ne ; fertilisers : H , N , P , S , Cl ( as a micronutrient ) and Se ; household accoutrements : H ( primary constituent of water ) , He ( party balloons ) , C ( in pencils , as graphite ) , N ( beer widgets ) , O ( as peroxide , in detergents ) , F ( as fluoride , in toothpaste ) , Ne ( lighting ) , P ( matches ) , S ( garden treatments ) , Cl ( bleach constituent ) , Ar ( insulated windows ) , Se ( glass ; solar cells ) , Br ( as bromide , for purification of spa water ) , Kr ( energy saving fluorescent lamps ) , I ( in antiseptic solutions ) , Xe ( in plasma TV display cells ) and Rn ( as an unwanted , potentially hazardous indoor pollutant ) ; industrial acids : C , N , F , P , S and Cl ; inert air replacements : N , Ne , S ( in sulfur hexafluoride <unk> ) , Ar , Kr and Xe ; lasers and lighting : He , C ( in carbon dioxide lasers , CO2 ) , N , O ( in a chemical oxygen iodine laser ) , F ( in a hydrogen fluoride laser , HF ) , Ne , S ( in a sulfur lamp ) , Ar , Kr and Xe ; and medicine and pharmaceuticals : He , O , F , Cl , Br , I , Xe and Rn . 
 The number of compounds formed by nonmetals is vast . The first nine places in a " top 20 " table of elements most frequently encountered in 8 @,@ 427 @,@ 300 compounds , as listed in the Chemical Abstracts Service register for July 1987 , were occupied by nonmetals . Hydrogen , carbon , oxygen and nitrogen were found in the majority ( greater than 64 per cent ) of compounds . The highest rated metal , with an occurrence frequency of 2 @.@ 3 per cent , was iron , in 11th place .

 Sulfur and carbon were known in antiquity . The earliest known use of charcoal dates to around <unk> BCE . The Egyptians and Sumerians employed it for the reduction of copper , zinc , and tin ores in the manufacture of bronze . Diamonds were probably known from as early as 2500 BCE . The first true chemical analyses were made in the 18th century ; Lavoisier recognized carbon as an element in 1789 . Sulfur usage dates from before 2500 BCE ; it was recognized as an element by Antoine Lavoisier in 1777 .

 Cavendish , in 1766 , was the first to distinguish hydrogen from other gases , although Paracelsus around 1500 , Robert Boyle ( 1670 ) , and Joseph Priestley { ? ) had observed its production by reacting strong acids with metals . Lavoisier named it in 1793 . Carl Wilhelm Scheele obtained oxygen by heating mercuric oxide and nitrates in 1771 , but did not publish his findings until 1777 . Priestley also prepared this new " air " by 1774 , but only Lavoisier recognized it as a true element ; he named it in 1777 . Rutherford discovered nitrogen while he was studying at the University of Edinburgh . He showed that the air in which animals breathed , after removal of exhaled carbon dioxide , was no longer able to burn a candle . Scheele , Henry Cavendish , and Priestley also studied this element at about the same time ; Lavoisier named it in 1775 @-@ 6 .

Fluorine was eventually isolated by Moissan , in 1886 . In 1894 , Lord Rayleigh and Ramsay discovered argon by comparing the molecular weights of nitrogen prepared by liquefaction from air and nitrogen prepared by chemical means . It was the first noble gas to be isolated .

 = Jessica Anderson = 
 Jessica Margaret Anderson ( 25 September 1916 – 9 July 2010 ) was an Australian novelist and short story writer . Born in Brisbane , Anderson lived the bulk of her life in Sydney apart from a few years in London . She began her career writing short stories for newspapers and drama scripts for radio , especially adaptations of well @-@ known novels . Embarking on her career as a novelist relatively late in life - her first novel was published when she was 47 - her early novels attracted little attention . She rose to prominence upon the publication of her fourth novel , Tirra Lirra by the River , published in 1978 . Although she remains best known for this work , several of her novels have garnered high acclaim , most notably The Impersonators ( 1980 ) and Stories from the Warm Zone and Sydney Stories ( 1987 ) , both of which have won awards . She won the Miles Franklin Literary Award twice , and has been published in Britain and the United States . Jessica Anderson died at Elizabeth Bay , New South Wales in 2010 , following a stroke . She was the mother of Australian screenwriter Laura Jones , her only child . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Jessica Anderson was born Jessica Margaret Queale in Gayndah , Queensland , on 25 September 1916 to Charles James Queale and Alice Queale ( née Hibbert ) . Anderson 's father , Charles Queale ( 1867 – 1933 ) , was the youngest child of a large Irish family , and the only one to be born in Australia . Upon their arrival in Queensland , the <unk> set up residence at Gayndah in a house to which Anderson fleetingly refers in Stories from the Warm Zone and Sydney Stories as " the Old Barn " . Coming from a family of farmers , Charles Queale acquired a veterinarian 's certificate and took up a position in the Department of Agriculture and Stock . Anderson 's mother , Alice Queale ( 1879 – 1968 ) , was born in England , and emigrated to Queensland with her family at the age of three . The daughter of a Church of England music teacher , she had learnt the violin as a child and sometimes played for her family as an adult . Before marrying , Alice worked in the public service and joined the Queensland labour movement , in which she met Anderson 's father , Charles . Staunch Anglicans , Alice 's family disapproved of her marriage to Charles , and for the rest of her life Alice 's mother refused to see Charles or any of Alice 's children . 
 Jessica was the youngest of four children ; her elder siblings were Alan Lindsay Queale ( 1908 – 1982 ) , Vida Joan Queale ( 1910 – 1954 ) , and Patricia Queale . While each features to some extent in her semi @-@ autobiographical work , Stories from the Warm Zone and Sydney Stories , Anderson 's relationship with her brother , Alan ( Neal in the memoirs ) , who was eight years her senior , is the least developed in the collection . Indeed , Anderson stated in one interview that for many years , she and her brother " lived in different channels of the same family , " and that it was only during the later years of his life , when they were the last surviving members of their immediate family that they grew close . Alan Queale rose to some renown in his own right as a prolific archivist , mostly of Australiana and artefacts of Queensland 's history , and many of his collections remain in the State Library of Queensland and the National Library of Australia . Beyond the brief glimpses afforded by Stories from the Warm Zone and Sydney Stories , little is known about Anderson 's relationships with her two sisters , Joan and Patricia . Her eldest sister , Joan , died in her early forties , when Anderson was in her thirties , tragically leaving behind several young children . Her other sister , Patricia , also died of cancer some years later . Anderson writes very affectionately of her sisters . 
 For the benefit of their children 's schooling , the Queale family moved from Gayndah to the Brisbane suburb of Annerley when Anderson was five years old . Anderson 's father , Charles , somewhat begrudgingly left his father 's " meagre acres " and took up a job in an office in Brisbane 's CBD , from which " he instructed others how to farm , how to treat disease in stock and crops , but still longed to return to farming himself . " 
 For the remainder of Anderson 's childhood , the <unk> lived at 56 Villa Street , in a house abutting Yeronga Memorial Park . On the opposite side of the park was Yeronga State School , the school at which Anderson began her formal education . In spite of its reputation as one of the best state schools in Queensland at the time , Yeronga State School rapidly became a site of dread and frustration for Anderson , who suffered from a speech impediment that caused strife for her in the classroom . Anderson 's speech impediment ( as well as her occasional flirtations with truancy ) became such a hindrance to her education that her parents decided that she was to be home @-@ schooled by her mother for a year , while attending weekly speech therapy sessions in the city . In spite of these efforts , Anderson 's slight stammer was to stay with her for the rest of her life ; several observers commented that the impediment lent her speech a careful and deliberate air . Following her primary school education , Anderson attended high school at Brisbane State High School . Upon graduation , she attended Brisbane Technical College Art School . 
 Anderson 's father died when she was just sixteen . Suffering from chronic bronchitis and emphysema , and having survived diphtheria and typhoid fever , her father 's illness is a pall that hangs over many of the tales in Stories from the Warm Zone , and his death was undoubtedly a " bitter blow " to the young girl and her siblings . 
 Anderson appeared to have a complicated relationship with Brisbane , a city " where brutality and gentleness rested so easily side by side . " Although she believed 1920s Brisbane to be quite parochial , she stated that it was not " altogether narrow and rigid . " She took the well @-@ thumbed copies of the great Russian novels in Brisbane 's public libraries as evidence of the presence of many frustrated people in Brisbane ; " people with aspiration beyond their society . " Herself a victim of the stifling social expectations of the old colonial town , she has stated that she " would have like to be an architect , but it seemed at the time absolutely impossible for a girl to be an architect , especially in Brisbane . " 
 = = Life as a commercial writer = = 
 In 1935 , at the age of 18 , Anderson left her Brisbane home to live in Sydney . Despite the fact that she spent her childhood in Queensland , she stated in interviews that she felt more affinity with Sydney , the city where she was to spend the bulk of her adult life . There she subsisted on wages from a number of sources , including a slide @-@ painting job , and a job designing electric signs , where she was able to make use of her art school training , and later from work in shops and factories . She and her friends lived at Potts Point in " big seedy decaying mansions with gardens running right down to the harbour . " In a city still recovering from the ravages of The Great Depression , life for Anderson was not altogether easy : " Times were very hard , " she recalled ; " People were poor , but very free . We had a good life . " 
 As Anderson remained throughout her life evasive about the details of her life as a commercial writer , it is not known when she began writing commercially under pseudonyms , what those pseudonyms were , or , indeed , how much she wrote . She revealed only that she began writing for magazines and newspapers out of commercial necessity , and rarely under her own name . Although she achieved success later in this field , she sometimes stated that , as her writing improved , her pieces were more frequently turned down for publication . In her thirties , she began to write for commercial radio . Beginning with half @-@ hour slots , Anderson gradually became interested in the technique of crafting radio plays , and began submitting some of her better work to the ABC under her own name . She later ascribed her fondness for writing the expansive dialogue in her novels to her early experience writing radio plays . 
 It was in Sydney that Anderson met her first husband , Ross McGill , with whom she lived for three years before their marriage in 1940 . Anderson described McGill as " a commercial artist who longed to be a painter . " Tragically , nearly all of his works were destroyed in a fire , and Anderson was left with only a few drawings of his that he had given to a mutual friend , who then generously shared them with Anderson . 
 Anderson and McGill temporarily relocated to London in 1937 . There , Anderson found employment that she described as " donkey work " : she did research for a magazine named <unk> , and worked as a typist . Meanwhile , her husband , McGill , worked as a layout artist for Lever Brothers Agency , while continuing to paint in his spare time . While some critics have proffered this stint in England as evidence of the semi @-@ autobiographical nature of Tirra Lirra by the River , Anderson rejected such claims , asserting that , while all of her characters had something of her in them , none were entirely autobiographical . 
 In 1940 , Anderson and McGill returned to Sydney . During the war , Anderson worked as a seasonal fruit picker in the Australian Women 's Land Army . She gave birth to her only child , Laura Jones ( née McGill ) in 1946 . Jones now works as a film and television screenwriter in Australia . 
 = = First novels = = 
 After fourteen years of marriage , Anderson and McGill divorced , and she married Leonard Culbert Anderson in 1955 . More comfortable financial circumstance 's following her second marriage allowed her to fulfil her lifelong intention to write a novel . 
 = = = An Ordinary Lunacy = = = 
 She began work on her first novel , An Ordinary Lunacy , relatively late in life : she started writing in her late thirties , and it was published only in 1963 , by which time she was aged 47 . Although it began life as a radio play , Anderson quickly found that An Ordinary Lunacy was " interesting enough for a novel , so I went off , and it got quite out of hand . " The novel detailed the romance between thirty @-@ five @-@ year @-@ old Sydney barrister , David Byfield , and Isobel Purdy , a woman accused of murdering her husband . Acclaimed for its adept portrayal of the protean nature of romantic love , An Ordinary Lunacy foregrounds the different perspectives of three women : Isobel , Daisy Byfield ( David 's mother ) , and Myra <unk> , David 's ex @-@ lover . Pam Gilbert writes that " Anderson 's construction of the tensions existing between three women such as Daisy , Isobel and Myra offers an interesting platform for an exposition of romance and passion from a woman 's perspective . " 
 Upon completion of the novel , Anderson felt that it did not stand a good chance of being published in Australia , taking it instead to London publishing houses . It was taken up by Macmillan Publishers in London , and by Scribner in New York , and although it was not a great commercial success , it received a good deal of positive critical feedback . Anderson modestly maintained that the novel was little more than " a good start . " 
 = = = A Question of Money = = = 
 Anderson 's second novel , A Question of Money , was never published . She maintained that this unpublished work merited publication , and suggested that it had been " rejected at a time when sex was new in writing and everything had to be strongly sexual or violent . " Although she considered revising A Question of Money for publication in the 1980s , as a more established author , she did not , and the work remains unpublished . Following the disappointment of A Question of Money , Anderson returned temporarily to radio script writing . She adapted a number of great works , including several by Henry James and Charles Dickens , which she found to be a " very healing " experience . 
 = = = The Last Man 's Head = = = 
 Anderson 's second published novel , The Last Man 's Head , published in 1970 , centres on the appropriately named detective , Alec Probyn , and his struggle to resolve a murder , of which he suspects his brother @-@ in @-@ law , Robbie Maciver , to be guilty . Probyn 's efforts are frustrated by the complex structure of the dominant Maciver family , which seeks to deal with Robbie internally . Detective novel becomes a psychological thriller when a tormented Probyn kills Robbie . Like An Ordinary Lunacy , The Last Man 's Head features a number of female characters who test the limits of their social roles , if not outright rebelling against them . Although Macmillan Publishers in London immediately accepted the novel for publication , it was inappropriately typecast as a simple crime novel , a decision with which Anderson and critics disagreed . 
 = = = The Commandant = = = 
 Anderson 's third and favourite novel was her only work of historical fiction , The Commandant , published in 1975 . Based on the story of the murder of the infamously brutal penal Commandant , Captain Patrick Logan , which Anderson had initially heard recounted in her childhood , the story is given a " new , partly feminist perspective in that it is centred on the experience of Logan 's young sister @-@ in @-@ law . " Seventeen @-@ year @-@ old Frances O 'Beirne , Letty Logan 's sister , travels from Ireland to Moreton Bay Penal Settlement in 1830 to visit her sister . Although Frances is an invented character , most of the other characters are , in fact , based on accounts of real people from Anderson 's extensive primary research . She created Frances to give voice to her own narrative commentary . Anderson once playfully likened the Moreton Bay social climate to Elizabeth Gaskell 's Cranford ; Susan Sheridan notes that the likeness is particularly true of the discord between the elegant gentility of the middle @-@ class , and the cruelty of the penal colony . 
 As was the case with The Last Man 's Head , Anderson and many critics felt that publishers packaged The Commandant inappropriately , making it look like a " Regency romance . " She states in one interview that this " was very disappointing . Design and presentation , those things really matter . " 
 = = Success and later novels = = 
 Anderson 's second marriage ended in divorce in 1976 . By this time , Anderson had established herself as a professional novelist , with each of her novels achieving moderate success . 
 = = = Tirra Lirra by the River = = = 
 Her greatest mainstream success , however , was to come in 1978 with the publication of her fourth novel , Tirra Lirra by the River . The title is a quote from Tennyson 's great ballad , " The Lady of Shalott " , which tells the tale of a female artist who meets a tragic end when she attempts to move beyond artistic isolation . The novel details the life of Nora Porteous , whose natural creativity is constrained by the fact that " she herself doesn 't know that she 's an artist . She struggles through , trying to arrive at her art and never succeeding . " After thirty odd years away , Nora , now elderly , returns to Brisbane , where she spent her childhood . The novel is essentially a " personally commentated replay of a life , " during which Nora recounts and reflects upon the events that have shaped the course of her life . Anderson chose to create a woman from a very specific era : born several decades before Anderson herself was alive , Nora would have lived through World War I , World War II and The Great Depression , in a time and pace where " artists , although they were known to exist , were supposed to exist elsewhere . " Nora struggles to submerge her various artistic and unconventional selves in favour of a more socially acceptable constructed persona . Nora uses the " spinning globe , " her equivalent of the Lady of Shalott 's " crystal mirror , " to explore the various stages and facets of her life , and to conceal some of its more unsavoury aspects from herself , and from the reader . 
 The novel began its life as a 20 @,@ 000 @-@ word novella , which was prize @-@ winning in its own right . As it was an awkward length for a novel , publishers requested that Anderson extend the story , which she did following a trip to London in 1974 . In 1975 Tirra Lirra was broadcast as a radio play , and in 1977 Macmillan Publishers in Melbourne accepted it for publishing . In the year of its publication , Tirra Lirra won the Australian Natives ' Association Literary Award , and the Miles Franklin Literary Award , Australia 's most prestigious literary award . Anderson attributed its tremendous success in some degree to the fact that " it is less complex , I think . It 's easier to read than most of my others . " 
 = = = The Impersonators = = = 
 Anderson 's fifth novel , The Impersonators , published in 1980 , won her the prestigious Miles Franklin Literary Award for the second time . The novel enjoyed further critical acclaim when , in 1981 , it won the Christina Stead Fiction Award at the New South Wales Premier 's Literary Awards . Renamed The Only Daughter for publication in the United States , the novel details Sylvia Foley 's return to Australia after having lived in England for twenty years . Having come to the conclusion that worldly possessions and marriage are the main stumbling blocks to achieving freedom , Sylvia returns to find each of her Australian relatives bound by both constraints , making them " impersonators . " 
 = = = Stories from the Warm Zone and Sydney Stories = = = 
 In 1987 , Anderson published Stories from the Warm Zone and Sydney Stories . As the title suggests , the book is divided into two sections : the first details a number of anecdotes from Anderson 's childhood involving her family , to all of whom she gives false names , which has been described as " her most poignant evocation of her childhood home " ; the second part , less obviously autobiographical , sketches various lives and relationships against the backdrop of urban Sydney . The book was well @-@ received and won The Age Book of the Year in 1987 . 
 = = = Taking Shelter = = = 
 In 1989 , Anderson published her sixth novel , Taking Shelter . Set in Sydney in the winter of 1986 , the novel 's focus is twenty @-@ one @-@ year @-@ old Beth <unk> and her relationships . Overwhelmed by her six half brothers , Beth travels to Sydney at the request of her cousin , Kyrie . Although she is engaged to Miles <unk> , a twenty @-@ nine @-@ year @-@ old lawyer , at the beginning of the novel , he eventually admits that he is gay , and Beth leaves him . Almost immediately she meets and begins a relationship with Marcus Pirie , whom she discovers she had met in Rome when they were both children . When Beth discovers that she is pregnant , she and Marcus settle into a house owned by Juliet McCracken , who calls herself Miles ' " spare old godmother . " In fact , Juliet performs the role of fairy @-@ godmother to a number characters in the novel , including Beth and Marcus ; Elaine Barry suggests that this , along with Anderson 's " use of coincidence , dreams , [ and a ] superficially happy ending , " makes Taking Shelter " almost a parody of popular romantic fiction . " 
 = = = One of the Wattle Birds = = = 
 One of the Wattle Birds , Anderson 's seventh and final novel , was published in 1994 . Set in Sydney , it details three days in the life of Cecily <unk> . Although the novel is ostensibly set in the present , the final paragraph of the novel reveals that the three @-@ day sequence has been devised by Cecily as a means of coping with the fact that a year earlier , her mother , Christine had died of breast cancer , while Cecily had been away on holiday . Throughout the novel , Cecily attempts to resolve two quandaries : she does not understand why her mother did not tell her about that fatal illness and let her go overseas , refusing to let family members call her back , even for the funeral , nor why Christine included the cruel stipulation in her will that Cecily must marry before she can inherit . In addition to its adept depiction of the intricacies of social and family life , One of the Wattle Birds speaks to the process of writing and creating , as Cecily is herself a writer . 
 On 9 July 2010 , Anderson died in Sydney at the age of 93 following a stroke . She was survived by her daughter , Laura Jones , Laura 's husband , Peter Jones , and their daughter , Olivia Farrell . 
 = = Starting too late = = 
 Anderson was by no means alone in her late emergence onto the literary stage : Geordie Williamson notes that several of Anderson 's Australian female contemporaries including Elizabeth Jolley , Olga Masters , and Amy Witting did not begin publishing until they had reached retirement age . He suggests that each of these women was constrained largely by material circumstances , including " the demands of family and work , lack of financial independence , an indifferent publishing environment . " When discussing her career , Anderson was quite clear about where her duties lay : " When I was married , and writing at home ( writing was my second job ; my first was the house ) ... I never craved to be out in the workplace . " He suggests that , as well as adverse material circumstances , Anderson 's career was delayed , and her success mitigated by modesty and a certain " diffidence regarding her gifts . " In her own essay entitled " Starting Too Late , " Anderson complains that " they are unwilling servants , those skills we learn too late . " She would perhaps have described success as such a skill . When asked about how winning awards had affected her life , she replied that : 
 ... it 's encouraging to win a prize . But the success of Tirra Lirra , plus the prize it won and the two prizes The Impersonators won , made me feel less private and more vulnerable , and I had to get over that in order to go on at all . I had never been interviewed before , or I had never been asked to be interviewed , and suddenly I had all these interviews . It was a challenge I found hard to meet . I almost wished I had kept writing under a pseudonym as I had begun … 
 In spite of her late start , Anderson 's career as a novelist spanned three decades during which she produced eight critically acclaimed works . Of these , only Tirra Lirra by the River remains in print .

 = Contact ( 1997 American film ) = 
 Contact is a 1997 American science fiction drama film directed by Robert Zemeckis . It is a film adaptation of Carl Sagan 's 1985 novel of the same name ; Sagan and his wife Ann Druyan wrote the story outline for the film . 
 Jodie Foster portrays the film 's protagonist , Dr. Eleanor " Ellie " Arroway , a SETI scientist who finds strong evidence of extraterrestrial life and is chosen to make first contact . The film also stars Matthew McConaughey , James Woods , Tom Skerritt , William Fichtner , John Hurt , Angela Bassett , Jake Busey , and David Morse . 
 Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan began working on the film in 1979 . Together , they wrote a 100 + page film treatment and set up Contact at Warner Bros. with Peter Guber and Lynda Obst as producers . When development stalled on the film , Sagan published Contact as a novel in 1985 and the film adaptation was rejuvenated in 1989 . Roland Joffé and George Miller had planned to direct it , but Joffé dropped out in 1993 and Warner Bros. fired Miller in 1995 . Robert Zemeckis was eventually hired to direct , and filming for Contact lasted from September 1996 to February 1997 . Sony Pictures Imageworks handled most of the visual effects sequences . 
 The film was released on July 11 , 1997 , to mostly positive reviews . Contact grossed approximately $ 171 million in worldwide box office totals . The film won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and received multiple awards and nominations at the Saturn Awards . The release of Contact was plagued by controversies from the Clinton administration and CNN , as well as individual lawsuits from George Miller and Francis Ford Coppola . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Dr. Ellie Arroway ( Jodie Foster ) works for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ( SETI ) program at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico . Fascinated by science and communication since she was a child , she listens to radio emissions from space hoping to find evidence of alien life . Science Advisor to the President David Drumlin ( Tom Skerritt ) pulls the funding from SETI because he believes the endeavor is futile . Arroway gains backing from secretive billionaire industrialist S. R. Hadden ( John Hurt ) , which allows her to continue the project at the Very Large Array ( VLA ) in New Mexico . 
 Four years later , with Drumlin seeking to close SETI , Arroway discovers a signal repeating a sequence of prime numbers , apparently sent from the star system Vega some 26 light @-@ years away . This announcement causes Drumlin and the National Security Council led by Michael Kitz ( James Woods ) , to attempt to take control of the facility . Arroway 's team then discover a video picture buried in the signal : Adolf Hitler 's opening address at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin . Arroway and her team postulate that this would have been the first television signal strong enough to leave Earth 's atmosphere , taking 26 years to reach Vega and then transmitted back from there . 
 The project is put under tight security and its progress followed worldwide . Arroway learns that the signal also contains more than 60 @,@ 000 pages of indecipherable data . The reclusive Hadden secretly meets with Arroway to provide the means to decode the pages , found when they are arranged in three dimensions rather than two @-@ dimensional pages . The pages reveal schematics for a complex machine which is determined to be some kind of transport for a single occupant . 
 The nations of the world fund the construction of the machine at Cape Canaveral . An international panel is assembled to choose a candidate to travel in the machine . Although Arroway is a frontrunner to go , her hopes are scuppered by Christian philosopher Palmer Joss ( Matthew McConaughey ) , a panel member whom Arroway met in Puerto Rico and had a brief romantic encounter . When he brings attention to her atheism , the panel selects Drumlin instead on the belief he would be more representative of humanity . However , on the day the machine is tested , a religious fanatic ( Jake Busey ) destroys the machine in a suicide bombing , killing Drumlin and many others . 
 A cancer @-@ stricken Hadden , now in residence on the Mir space station , reveals to Arroway that a second machine was secretly made in Japan , and that Arroway will be the one to go . Outfitted with several recording devices , Arroway enters the machine 's pod which is then dropped into four rapidly spinning rings causing the pod to apparently travel through a series of wormholes . Arroway sees a radio array @-@ like structure at Vega and signs of an advanced civilization on another planet . She then finds herself in a surreal beachfront landscape , similar to a childhood picture she drew of Florida , and a blurry figure approaches that becomes her deceased father ( David Morse ) . Arroway recognizes him as an alien taking her father 's form and attempts to ask questions . The alien tells her that the familiar landscape and form were used to make their first contact easier for her and that this journey was just humanity 's first step to joining other spacefaring species . 
 Arroway falls unconscious as she begins traveling back through a wormhole . She awakens to find herself on the floor of the pod , the mission control team repeatedly hailing her . She learns that , from outside the machine , it appears the pod merely dropped through the machine 's rings and landed in a safety net . Arroway insists that she was gone for approximately 18 hours , but her recording devices show only static . A Congressional Committee is formed and speculates that the Vega signal and machine were a hoax designed by the now deceased Hadden . Although she cannot prove it happened , Arroway asks the committee to accept the truth of her testimony on faith . In a private conversation , Kitz and White House official Rachel Constantine ( Angela Bassett ) reflect on confidential information that , although Arroway 's recording device only recorded static , it recorded 18 hours of it . Arroway and Joss reunite , and Arroway receives ongoing financial support to expand the SETI program .
