 " These Words " ( also known as " These Words ( I Love You , I Love You ) " ) is a song by Natasha Bedingfield . It was written by Steve Kipner , Andrew Frampton , Wayne Wilkins and Bedingfield for her 2004 debut album , Unwritten . The song is the album 's opening track , and was released as its second single . " These Words " details Bedingfield 's lack of inspiration and her reaction to pressure from her record label to produce a hit song . 
 " These Words " was released as the album 's second international single and as the lead single in North America . The single sold well , reached the top forty worldwide , and topped the charts in both Ireland and the United Kingdom . It was certified platinum in the United States and Australia , and was nominated for " Best British Single " at the 2005 BRIT Awards . The song was very well received by music critics , and was frequently cited as a highlight of the album . 
 = = Background and writing = = 
 Bedingfield began recording her debut album in mid @-@ 2003 , following the signing of a recording contract with Sony BMG earlier that year . She was determined not to be shaped into " some music biz pigeonhole " and wanted to write songs that were " organic , different and real " . Bedingfield began collaborating with Steve Kipner , Andrew Frampton and Wayne Wilkins in London and Los Angeles , but their sessions were largely unproductive due to Bedingfield 's writer 's block and the pressure that she felt to produce a hit song . Frustrated , she began to sing " I love you , I love you , I love you " over and over . She was at " wit 's end and just wanted to say what I meant in a simple way , without using all those flowery words . " The line that Bedingfield sang out of frustration became the song 's hook and its subject matter inspired by her real life difficulty writing a love song .

 " These Words " was generally very well received by contemporary pop music critics . PlayLouder 's Daniel Robson described the song as a " compelling chunk of <unk> joy " , while Allmusic wrote that the track was " near @-@ perfect " and merged " the rhythms and flavors of hip @-@ hop and R & B with unique melodies and Bedingfield 's vocal confidence " . The BBC called it a " classic love song " with a " really catchy tune " , and commented that it was worthy of reaching number one on the UK singles chart . Josh Timmermann of Stylus Magazine called it " best single so far this year " , and David Welsh of musicOMH.com wrote that the song had a " virally @-@ infectious chorus and ( relatively ) clever wordplay . " 
 Stylus Magazine 's Colin Cooper ranked " These Words " at number thirteen on his list of the Top 20 Singles of 2004 and About.com ranked the song at number five on its list of the Top 10 Most Memorable Pop Song Lyrics 2005 . The website wrote that Bedingfield 's naming of the famous poets George Byron , Percy Bysshe Shelley , and John Keats in the song enables the listener to " almost hear the classic poetry over a drum machine " as Bedingfield sings .

 The song 's international music video was directed by Scott Lyon and Sophie Muller and premiered in August 2004 . The video features several sequences . It opens with Bedingfield sitting at a table in her Spanish villa , in MÃ¡laga , frustrated by her inability to find inspiration to write a song , and she cuts the flowers off by the window . She is then seen walking through the villa in colorful outfits , and sitting by the swimming pool , surrounded by dancing chairs , dancing radios , dancing books in the library , and multiple versions of herself . The video concludes with Bedingfield scribbling in her notebook on the roof of her villa . Her scribblings lead her boyfriend to the front of her home where she admits that she loves him and she goes to the balcony , asking him if her feelings are " okay " .

 The North American music video was directed by Chris Milk and filmed in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil in March 2005 . The music video , however , was discarded by the record label , though this version won four Annual MVPA Awards . The video begins with Bedingfield waking up next to a boombox , dressing , brushing her teeth and leaving her home with the boombox . While performing on a beach in New York City , she kicks her boombox , which comes alive and begins to dance , and she leaves the beach and walks down the street . The video concludes with Bedingfield arriving back home to a house full of dancing boomboxes in the bedroom . 
 An alternate version of the North American video was directed by Jim Gable using much of the footage from the original . The boomboxes featured in the video are animated to look like drawings and a performance by Bedingfield in a room with flowing white drapery has been added . The video debuted in June 2005 and proved successful on U.S. video @-@ chart programs . It debuted on MTV 's Total Request Live on 28 June 2005 at number ten and remained on the program for a total of six days . VH1 ranked the video at number twenty @-@ two on its Top 40 Videos of 2005 countdown .

 Kevin Lee Grady , Jr . ( born June 24 , 1986 ) is a former American football running back . He completed his athletic eligibility for the Michigan Wolverines football team during the 2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season . He began his Michigan career as a tailback but was converted to fullback . He has also played for the Chicago Slaughter of the Indoor Football League . 
 In high school , he led his team to consecutive Michigan High School Athletic Association Championships . Along the way , he established numerous Michigan High School Athletic Association career football rushing records while playing for East Grand Rapids High School , many of which still stand . He was also widely @-@ regarded as the best junior class high school football player in the nation during the 2003 high school football season . 
 At the University of Michigan , he became the school 's first athlete to graduate high school a semester early in order to participate in Spring football practice . He was Mike Hart 's backup at tailback during his first two years at Michigan . He missed his third year due to injury and returned to play fullback during his final two years of eligibility . 
 = = High school career = = 
 Grady was born in Grand Rapids , Michigan . During high school , Grady was a four @-@ year varsity starter at East Grand Rapids High School . There he earned many honors and achievements , including being named All @-@ State and the title of EA Sports junior player of the year . He led East Grand Rapids to consecutive state Division 3 football championships . He was one of the top high school running backs in the nation in high school on par with Jonathan Stewart , Rashard Mendenhall , Marlon Lucky , Antone Smith and Jamaal Charles . He was a 5 @-@ star blue chip recruit ranked among the top 5 running backs in the nation according to both Scout.com and Rivals.com. He holds the following Michigan High School Athletic Association records : 
 Most career rushing yards ( 8 @,@ 431 ) 
 Most career touchdowns ( 151 ) 
 Most career points ( 924 ) 
 Most career rushing attempts ( 1 @,@ 154 ) 
 He formerly held the following record : 
 Most consecutive games with 100 yards rushing ( 24 ) 
 Grady did not consider any other schools en route to signing with Michigan . 
 = = College career = = 
 Although football players had been enrolling early at Bowl Championship Series ( BCS ) programs for several years , Grady was the first University of Michigan football player to do so . In subsequent years several other players followed his lead , including Justin Boren and Carlos Brown the following year . By graduating high school early , he was able to attend the 2005 Rose Bowl and participate in 2005 Spring football practice .

 As a freshman in 2005 , Grady rushed 121 times for 483 yards and five touchdowns as a backup and injury replacement for starter Mike Hart , who only played in eight games due to injuries . Grady also caught 14 passes for 113 yards receiving . One of his touchdowns gave Michigan an 18 â 12 lead in the third quarter of the Ohio State game . In the end Grady made two starts at tailback , and was one of only six freshman to have played for the 2005 Michigan Wolverines football team .

 Based on his performance during 2006 spring practice , Grady received the John F. Maulbetsch Award . In 2006 , he entered the season as Hart 's primary backup , ahead of senior Jerome Jackson , freshmen Brandon Minor , and Carlos Brown on the depth chart . On opening day , Grady 's five carries were second on the team , but some questioned why his total was so low . As the season progressed , he remained second on the depth chart , seeing limited playing time due to injuries as well as starter Mike Hart being healthy and starting all thirteen games . Grady rushed for 187 yards and three touchdowns on 55 carries and added one reception for eight yards . His net rushing yards from scrimmage ranked fourth on the 2006 Michigan Wolverines football team .

 Prior to spring football practice in 2007 , Grady switched his jersey number from 3 to 24 , his high school number and the day on which he was born . Later that year he was converted to fullback . During a scrimmage in early April , Grady tore his anterior cruciate ligament . On April 16 , 2007 , he had surgery . He would miss the entire 2007 season recovering from his injuries ; by making use of a redshirt year , however , he was able to not use up a year of eligibility .

 In 2008 , Rich Rodriguez replaced Lloyd Carr as head coach . During spring football , Grady was still recovering from injuries . 
 In July 2008 , Grady was pulled over while driving in Wyoming , Michigan with a blood alcohol content of .281 , more than three times the state 's legal limit . He originally pleaded not guilty . Grady began the 2008 season on suspension from the 2008 Wolverines , while Brown , Minor and freshmen Michael Shaw and Sam McGuffie fought for time . During the season , Grady pleaded guilty to misdemeanor drunken driving . 
 In early August , it appeared that juniors Brown and Minor would vie for the starting job because of Grady 's suspension . With both Brown and Minor nursing injuries , Sam McGuffie was tentatively penciled into the starting position on the depth chart . In the end , Grady only accumulated 33 yards rushing for the season .

 In the spring of 2009 , Grady was accused by court officials of not adhering to his probation reporting requirements and not meeting the 24 hours of community service requirement of his probation , among other violations . As a result , he was jailed for seven days in May 2009 . 
 Kevin 's brother , Kelvin Grady , was a point guard on the Michigan Wolverines men 's basketball team before transferring to the Michigan football team after the 2008 â 09 season . On October 17 , 2009 , the two became the first pair of brothers to score a touchdown in the same game for Michigan as far as could be told by the school 's record books . Over the course of the season , Kevin started three games at fullback for the 2009 Wolverines . He compiled 80 yards rushing on 10 carries bringing his career total to 783 yards on 200 carries and 10 touchdowns . He also made 5 receptions bringing his career total to 20 for 150 yards . 
 Grady was not selected in the 2010 NFL Draft and was not an immediate undrafted free agent . However , only 17 % of the top 100 high school football players from 2003 â 05 were selected in the NFL Draft .

 On November 26 , 2010 , Grady was arrested and charged again for driving under the influence after recording a .3 blood @-@ alcohol level on a breathalyzer test . He is required to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings three times a week . On December 31 , 2010 , the Indoor Football League announced that the Chicago Slaughter had signed Grady . On May 11 , 2011 , four days after scoring 6 touchdowns for the Slaughter , Grady was sentenced to twenty days in jail for his November drunk driving offense . The sentence included two years of probation , 80 hours of community service , random drug tests , confinement to the state of Michigan until given leave by the judge , and 180 days of car immobilization . In addition , the sentence resulted in him being dropped from the Slaughter .

 In the C + + programming language , decltype is a keyword used to query the type of an expression . Introduced in C + + 11 , its primary intended use is in generic programming , where it is often difficult , or even impossible , to express types that depend on template parameters . 
 As generic programming techniques became increasingly popular throughout the 1990s , the need for a type @-@ deduction mechanism was recognized . Many compiler vendors implemented their own versions of the operator , typically called typeof , and some portable implementations with limited functionality , based on existing language features were developed . In 2002 , Bjarne Stroustrup proposed that a standardized version of the operator be added to the C + + language , and suggested the name " decltype " , to reflect that the operator would yield the " declared type " of an expression . 
 decltype 's semantics were designed to cater to both generic library writers and novice programmers . In general , the deduced type matches the type of the object or function exactly as declared in the source code . Like the sizeof operator , decltype 's operand is not evaluated . 
 = = Motivation = = 
 With the introduction of templates into the C + + programming language , and the advent of generic programming techniques pioneered by the Standard Template Library , the need for a mechanism for obtaining the type of an expression , commonly referred to as typeof , was recognized . In generic programming , it is often difficult or impossible to express types that depend on template parameters , in particular the return type of function template instantiations . 
 Many vendors provide the typeof operator as a compiler extension . As early as 1997 , before C + + was fully standardized , Brian Parker proposed a portable solution based on the sizeof operator . His work was expanded on by Bill Gibbons , who concluded that the technique had several limitations and was generally less powerful than an actual typeof mechanism . In an October 2000 article of Dr. Dobb 's Journal , Andrei Alexandrescu remarked that " [ h ] aving a typeof would make much template code easier to write and understand . " He also noted that " typeof and sizeof share the same backend , because sizeof has to compute the type anyway . " Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo also recognized the usefulness of a built @-@ in typeof facility , with the caveat that " using it often invites subtle programming errors , and there are some problems that it cannot solve . " They characterized the use of type conventions , like the typedefs provided by the Standard Template Library , as a more powerful and general technique . However , Steve Dewhurst argued that such conventions are " costly to design and promulgate " , and that it would be " much easier to ... simply extract the type of the expression . " In a 2011 article on C + + 0x , Koenig and Moo predicted that " decltype will be widely used to make everyday programs easier to write . " 
 In 2002 , Bjarne Stroustrup suggested extending the C + + language with mechanisms for querying the type of an expression , and initializing objects without specifying the type . Stroustrup observed that the reference @-@ dropping semantics offered by the typeof operator provided by the GCC and <unk> compilers could be problematic . Conversely , an operator returning a reference type based on the lvalue @-@ ness of the expression was deemed too confusing . The initial proposal to the C + + standards committee outlined a combination of the two variants ; the operator would return a reference type only if the declared type of the expression included a reference . To emphasize that the deduced type would reflect the " declared type " of the expression , the operator was proposed to be named decltype . 
 One of the cited main motivations for the decltype proposal was the ability to write perfect forwarding function templates . It is sometimes desirable to write a generic forwarding function that returns the same type as the wrapped function , regardless of the type it is instantiated with . Without decltype , it is not generally possible to accomplish this . An example , which also utilizes the trailing @-@ return @-@ type : 
 decltype is essential here because it preserves the information about whether the wrapped function returns a reference type . 
 = = Semantics = = 
 Similarly to the sizeof operator , the operand of decltype is <unk> . Informally , the type returned by decltype ( e ) is deduced as follows : 
 If the expression e refers to a variable in local or namespace scope , a static member variable or a function parameter , then the result is that variable 's or parameter 's declared type 
 Otherwise , if e is an lvalue , decltype ( e ) is T & , where T is the type of e ; if e is an <unk> , the result is T & & ; otherwise , e is a <unk> and the result is T. 
 These semantics were designed to fulfill the needs of generic library writers , while at the same time being intuitive for novice programmers , because the return type of decltype always matches the type of the object or function exactly as declared in the source code . More formally , Rule 1 applies to <unk> id @-@ expressions and class member access expressions . Example : 
 The reason for the difference between the latter two invocations of decltype is that the parenthesized expression ( a- > x ) is neither an id @-@ expression nor a member access expression , and therefore does not denote a named object . Because the expression is an lvalue , its deduced type is " reference to the type of the expression " , or const double & . 
 In December 2008 , a concern was raised to the committee by Jaakko JÃ¤rvi over the inability to use decltype to form a qualified @-@ id , which is inconsistent with the intent that decltype ( e ) should be treated " as if it were a <unk> @-@ name " . While commenting on the formal Committee Draft for C + + 0x , the Japanese ISO member body noted that " a scope operator ( : : ) cannot be applied to decltype , but it should be . It would be useful in the case to obtain member type ( nested @-@ type ) from an instance as follows " : 
 This , and similar issues pertaining to the wording inhibiting the use of decltype in the declaration of a derived class and in a destructor call , were addressed by David <unk> , and voted into the working paper in March 2010 . 
 = = Availability = = 
 decltype is included in the C + + Language Standard since C + + 11 . It is provided by a number of compilers as an extension . Microsoft 's Visual C + + 2010 and later compilers provide a decltype type specifier that closely mimics the semantics as described in the standards committee proposal . It can be used with both managed and native code . The documentation states that it is " useful primarily to developers who write template libraries . " decltype was added to the mainline of the GCC C + + compiler in version 4 @.@ 3 , released on March 5 , 2008 @.@ decltype is also present in <unk> 's C + + Builder 2009 , the Intel C + + Compiler , and <unk> . 
 = Grey heron = 
 The grey heron ( Ardea cinerea ) is a long @-@ legged predatory wading bird of the heron family , Ardeidae , native throughout temperate Europe and Asia and also parts of Africa . It is resident in much of its range , but some populations from the more northern parts migrate southwards in autumn . A bird of wetland areas , it can be seen around lakes , rivers , ponds , marshes and on the sea coast . It feeds mostly on aquatic creatures which it catches after standing stationary beside or in the water or stalking its prey through the shallows . 
 Standing up to a metre tall , adults weigh from 1 to 2 kg ( 2 @.@ 2 to 4 @.@ 4 lb ) . They have a white head and neck with a broad black stripe that extends from the eye to the black crest . The body and wings are grey above and the underparts are greyish @-@ white , with some black on the flanks . The long , sharply pointed beak is pinkish @-@ yellow and the legs are brown . 
 The birds breed colonially in spring in " <unk> " , usually building their nests high in trees . A clutch of usually three to five bluish @-@ green eggs is laid . Both birds incubate the eggs for a period of about 25 days , and then both feed the chicks , which fledge when seven or eight weeks old . Many juveniles do not survive their first winter , but if they do , they can expect to live for about five years . 
 In Ancient Egypt , the deity <unk> was depicted as a heron in New Kingdom artwork . In Ancient Rome , the heron was a bird of divination . Roast heron was once a specially @-@ prized dish ; when George Neville became Archbishop of York in 1465 , four hundred herons were served to the guests . 
 = = Description = = 
 The grey heron is a large bird , standing up to 100 cm ( 39 in ) tall and measuring 84 â 102 cm ( 33 â 40 in ) long with a 155 â 195 cm ( 61 â 77 in ) wingspan . The body weight can range from 1 @.@ 02 â 2 @.@ 08 kg ( 2 @.@ 2 â 4 @.@ 6 lb ) . The plumage is largely ashy @-@ grey above , and greyish @-@ white below with some black on the flanks . Adults have the head and neck white with a broad black supercilium that terminates in the slender , dangling crest , and bluish @-@ black streaks on the front of the neck . The scapular feathers are elongated and the feathers at the base of the neck are also somewhat elongated . Immature birds lack the dark stripe on the head and are generally duller in appearance than adults , with a grey head and neck , and a small , dark grey crest . The pinkish @-@ yellow beak is long , straight and powerful , and is brighter in colour in breeding adults . The iris is yellow and the legs are brown and very long . 
 The main call is a loud croaking " <unk> " , but a variety of guttural and raucous noises are heard at the breeding colony . The male uses an advertisement call to encourage a female to join him at the nest , and both sexes use various greeting calls after a pair bond has been established . A loud , harsh " <unk> " is used by the male in driving other birds from the vicinity of the nest and a soft " <unk> " expresses anxiety , as when a predator is nearby or a human walks past the colony . The chicks utter loud chattering or ticking noises . 
 = = Taxonomy and evolution = = 
 Herons are a fairly ancient lineage and first appeared in the fossil record in the Paleogene period ; very few fossil herons have been found however . By seven million years ago ( the late Miocene ) , birds closely resembling modern forms and attributable to modern genera had appeared . 
 Herons are members of the family Ardeidae , and the majority of extant species are in the subfamily <unk> and known as true or typical herons . This subfamily includes the herons and egrets , the green herons , the pond herons , the night herons and a few other species . The grey heron belongs in this subfamily and is placed in the genus Ardea , which also includes the cattle egret and the great egret . The grey heron was first described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus who gave it the name Ardea cinerea . The scientific name comes from Latin <unk> " heron " , and cinerea , " ash @-@ grey " ( from <unk> ashes ) . 
 Four subspecies are recognised : 
 A. c. cinerea â Linnaeus , 1758 : nominate , found in Europe , Africa , western Asia 
 A. c. <unk> â Clark , 1907 : found in eastern Asia 
 A. c. <unk> â Hartert , 1917 : found in Madagascar 
 A. c. monicae â Jouanin & Roux , 1963 : found on islands off Banc d 'Arguin , Mauritania . 
 It is closely related and similar to the North American great blue heron ( Ardea herodias ) , which differs in being larger , and having chestnut @-@ brown flanks and thighs , and to the <unk> heron ( Ardea <unk> ) from South America that forms a superspecies with . Some authorities believe that the subspecies A. c. monicae should be considered a separate species . It has been known to hybridise with the great egret ( Ardea alba ) , the little egret ( Egretta garzetta ) , the great blue heron and the purple heron ( Ardea purpurea ) . The Australian white @-@ faced heron is often incorrectly called a grey heron . In Ireland , the grey heron is often colloquially called a " crane " . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The grey heron has an extensive range throughout most of the Palearctic ecozone . The range of the nominate subspecies A. c. cinerea extends to 70 Â° North in Norway and 66 Â° North in Sweden , but otherwise its northerly limit is around 60 Â° North across the rest of Europe and Asia eastwards as far as the Ural Mountains . To the south , its range extends to northern Spain , France , central Italy , the Balkans , the Caucasus , Iraq , Iran , India and Myanmar ( Burma ) . It is also present in Africa south of the Sahara Desert , the Canary Islands , Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia and many of the Mediterranean Islands . It is replaced by A. c. <unk> in eastern Siberia , Mongolia , eastern China , Hainan , Japan and Taiwan . In Madagascar and the Aldabra Islands , the subspecies A. c. <unk> is found , while the subspecies A. c. monicae is restricted to Mauritania and offshore islands . 
 Over much of its range , the grey heron is resident , but birds from the more northerly parts of Europe migrate southwards , some remaining in central and southern Europe , others travelling on to Africa south of the Sahara Desert . 
 Within its range , the grey heron can be found anywhere with suitable watery habitat that can supply its food . The water body needs to be either shallow enough , or have a shelving margin in which it can wade . Although most common in the lowlands it also occurs in mountain tarns , lakes , reservoirs , large and small rivers , marshes , ponds , ditches , flooded areas , coastal lagoons , estuaries and the sea shore . It sometimes forages away from water in pasture , and it has been recorded in desert areas , hunting for beetles and lizards . Breeding colonies are usually near feeding areas but exceptionally may be up to 8 kilometres ( 5 mi ) away , and birds sometimes forage as much as 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) from the nesting site . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 The grey heron has a slow flight , with its long neck retracted ( S @-@ shaped ) . This is characteristic of herons and bitterns , and distinguishes them from storks , cranes , and spoonbills , which extend their necks . It flies with slow wing @-@ beats and sometimes glides for short distances . It sometimes soars , circling to considerable heights , but not as often as the stork . In spring , and occasionally in autumn , birds may soar high above the heronry and chase each other , undertake aerial manoeuvres or swoop down towards the ground . The birds often perch in trees , but spend much time on the ground , striding about or standing still for long periods with an upright stance , often on a single leg . 
 = = = Diet and feeding = = = 
 Fish , amphibians , small mammals and insects are taken in shallow water with the heron 's long bill . It has also been observed catching and killing juvenile birds such as ducklings , and occasionally takes birds up to the size of a water rail . It may stand motionless in the shallows , or on a rock or sandbank beside the water , waiting for prey to come within striking distance . Alternatively , it moves slowly and stealthily through the water with its body less upright than when at rest and its neck curved in an " S " . It is able to straighten its neck and strike with its bill with great rapidity . 
 Small fish are swallowed head first , and larger prey and eels are carried to the shore where they are subdued by being beaten on the ground or stabbed by the bill . They are then swallowed , or have hunks of flesh torn off . The bird regurgitates pellets of indigestible material such as fur , bones and the chitinous remains of insects . The main periods of hunting are around dawn and dusk , but it is also active at other times of day . At night it roosts in trees or on cliffs , where it tends to be gregarious . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 This species breeds in colonies known as <unk> , usually in high trees close to lakes , the seashore or other wetlands . Other sites are sometimes chosen , and these include low trees and bushes , bramble patches , reed beds , heather clumps and cliff ledges . The same nest is used year after year until blown down ; it starts as a small platform of sticks but expands into a bulky nest as more material is added in subsequent years . It may be lined with smaller twigs , strands of root or dead grasses , and in reed beds , it is built from dead reeds . The male usually collects the material while the female constructs the nest . Breeding activities take place between February and June . When a bird arrives at the nest , a greeting ceremony occurs in which each partner raises and lowers its wings and plumes . In continental Europe , and elsewhere , nesting colonies sometimes include nests of the purple heron and other heron species . 
 Courtship involves the male calling from the chosen nesting site . On the arrival of the female , both birds participate in a stretching ceremony , in which each bird extends its neck vertically before bringing it backwards and downwards with the bill remaining vertical , simultaneously flexing its legs , before returning to its normal stance . The snapping ceremony is another behaviour where the neck is extended forward , the head is lowered to the level of the feet and the mandibles are vigorously snapped together . This may be repeated twenty to forty times . When the pairing is settled , the birds may caress each other by attending to the other bird 's plumage . The male may then offer the female a stick which she incorporates into the nest . At this , the male becomes excited , further preening the female and copulation takes place . 
 The clutch of eggs usually numbers three to five , though as few as two and as many as seven eggs have been recorded . The eggs have a matt surface and are greenish @-@ blue , averaging 60 mm Ã 43 mm ( 2 @.@ 36 in Ã 1 @.@ 69 in ) . The eggs are normally laid at two @-@ day intervals and incubation usually starts after the first or second egg has been laid . Both birds take part in incubation and the period lasts for about twenty @-@ five days . Both parents bring food for the young . At first the chicks seize the adult 's bill from the side and extract regurgitated food from it . Later the adult disgorges the food at the nest and the chicks squabble for possession . They fledge at seven to eight weeks . There is usually a single generation each year , but two broods have been recorded . 
 The oldest recorded bird lived for twenty @-@ three years but the average life expectancy in the wild is about five years . Only about a third of juveniles survive into their second year , many falling victim to predation . 
 = = = City life = = = 
 Grey herons have the ability to live in cities where habitats and nesting space are available . In the Netherlands , the grey heron has established itself over the past decades in great numbers in urban environments . In cities such as Amsterdam , they are ever present and well adapted to modern city life . They hunt as usual , but also visit street markets and <unk> . Some individuals make use of people feeding them at their homes or share the catch of recreational fishermen . Similar behaviour on a smaller scale has been reported in Ireland . Garden ponds stocked with ornamental fish are attractive to herons , and may provide young birds with a learning opportunity on how to catch easy prey . 
 Herons have been observed visiting water enclosures in zoos , such as spaces for penguins , otters , pelicans , and seals , and taking food meant for the animals on display .

 Being large birds with powerful beaks , grey herons have few predators as adults , but the eggs and young are more vulnerable . The adult birds do not usually leave the nest unattended , but may be lured away by marauding crows or kites . A dead grey heron found in the Pyrenees is thought to have been killed by an otter . The bird may have been weakened by harsh winter weather causing scarcity of its prey . 
 A study performed by <unk> and <unk> in the Czech Republic between 1962 and 2013 suggested that central European grey herons host 29 species of parasitic worms . The dominant species consisted of <unk> cornu ( 67 % prevalence ) , <unk> <unk> ( 41 % prevalence ) , <unk> <unk> ( 39 % prevalence ) , <unk> <unk> ( 36 % prevalence ) , <unk> <unk> ( 31 % prevalence ) , <unk> <unk> ( 29 % prevalence ) and <unk> polonica ( 5 % prevalence ) . Juvenile grey herons were shown to host fewer species , but the intensity of infection was higher in the juveniles than in the adult herons . Of the <unk> flatworms found in central European grey herons , 52 % of the species likely infected their definitive hosts outside central Europe itself , in the pre @-@ migratory , migratory , or wintering quarters , despite the fact that a substantial proportion of grey herons do not migrate to the south .

 In Ancient Egypt , the bird deity <unk> , associated with the sun , creation , and rebirth , was depicted as a heron in New Kingdom artwork . 
 In Ancient Rome , the heron was a bird of divination that gave an augury ( sign of a coming event ) by its call , like the raven , stork , and owl . 
 Roast heron was once a specially @-@ prized dish in Britain for special occasions such as state banquets . For the appointment of George Neville as Archbishop of York in 1465 , four hundred herons were served to the guests . Young birds were still being shot and eaten in Romney Marsh in 1896 . Two grey herons feature in a stained glass window of the church in Selborne , Hampshire . 
 The English surnames Earnshaw , <unk> , Herne , and Heron all derive from the heron , the suffix <unk> meaning a wood , referring to a place where herons nested . 
 = Decipherment of rongorongo = 
 There have been numerous attempts to decipher the rongorongo script of Easter Island since its discovery in the late nineteenth century . As with most undeciphered scripts , many of the proposals have been fanciful . Apart from a portion of one tablet which has been shown to deal with a lunar calendar , none of the texts are understood , and even the calendar cannot actually be read . There are three serious obstacles to decipherment : the small number of remaining texts , comprising only 15 @,@ 000 legible glyphs ; the lack of context in which to interpret the texts , such as illustrations or parallels to texts which can be read ; and the fact that the modern Rapanui language is heavily mixed with Tahitian and is unlikely to closely reflect the language of the tablets â especially if they record a specialized register such as incantations â while the few remaining examples of the old language are heavily restricted in genre and may not correspond well to the tablets either . 
 Since a proposal by Butinov and Knorozov in the 1950s , the majority of philologists , linguists and cultural historians have taken the line that rongorongo was not true writing but proto @-@ writing , that is , an <unk> and rebus @-@ based mnemonic device , such as the <unk> script of the <unk> people , which would in all likelihood make it impossible to decipher . This skepticism is justified not only by the failure of the numerous attempts at decipherment , but by the extreme rarity of independent writing systems around the world . Of those who have attempted to decipher rongorongo as a true writing system , the vast majority have assumed it was logographic , a few that it was syllabic or mixed . Statistically it appears to have been compatible with neither a pure <unk> nor a pure syllabary . The topic of the texts is unknown ; various investigators have speculated they cover genealogy , navigation , astronomy , or agriculture . Oral history suggests that only a small elite were ever literate , and that the tablets were considered sacred . 
 = = Accounts from Easter Island = = 
 In the late 19th century , within a few years to decades of the destruction of Easter Island society by slave raiding and introduced epidemics , two amateur investigators recorded readings and recitations of rongorongo tablets by Easter Islanders . Both accounts were compromised at best , and are often taken to be worthless , but they are the only accounts from people who may have been familiar with the script first @-@ hand . 
 = = = Jaussen = = = 
 In 1868 the Bishop of Tahiti , <unk> @-@ Ãtienne Jaussen , received a gift from recent converts on Easter Island : a long cord of human hair wound around a discarded rongorongo tablet . He immediately recognized the importance of the tablet , and asked Father Hippolyte Roussel on Easter Island to collect more tablets and to find islanders capable of reading them . Roussel was able to acquire only a few additional tablets , and he could find no @-@ one to read them , but the next year in Tahiti Jaussen found a laborer from Easter Island , Metoro Tau â a Ure , who was said to know the inscriptions " by heart " . 
 Sometime between 1869 and 1874 , Jaussen worked with Metoro to decipher four of the tablets in his possession : A <unk> , B Aruku <unk> , C Mamari , and E Keiti . A list of the glyphs they identified was published posthumously , along with a complete account of the chants for A and B. This is the famous Jaussen list . Though at first taken for a Rosetta Stone of rongorongo , it has not led to an understanding of the script . It has been criticized for , among other inadequacies , glossing five glyphs as " porcelain " , a material not found on Easter Island . However , this is a mistranslation : Jaussen glossed the five glyphs as <unk> , French for both " cowrie " and the cowrie @-@ like Chinese ceramic which is called porcelain in English . Jaussen 's Rapanui gloss , pure , means specifically " cowrie " . 
 Almost a century later , Thomas Barthel published some of Jaussen 's notes . He compared Metoro 's chants with parallel passages in other tablets and discovered that Metoro had read the lines of Keiti forwards on the reverse but backwards on the obverse . Jacques Guy found that Metoro had also read the lunar calendar in Mamari backwards , and failed to recognize the " very obvious " pictogram of the full moon within it , demonstrating a lack of any understanding of the contents of the tablets . 
 = = = Thomson = = = 
 William J. Thomson , paymaster on the USS Mohican , spent twelve days on Easter Island from 19 December to 30 December 1886 , during which time he made an impressive number of observations , including some which are of interest for the decipherment of the rongorongo . 
 = = = = Ancient calendar = = = = 
 Among the ethnographic data Thomson collected were the names of the nights of the lunar month and of the months of the year . This is key to interpreting the single identifiable sequence of rongorongo , and is notable in that it contains thirteen months ; other sources mention only twelve . MÃ©traux criticizes Thomson for translating <unk> as August when in 1869 Roussel identified it as July , and Barthel restricts his work to MÃ©traux and Englert , because they are in agreement while " Thomson 's list is off by one month " . However , Guy calculated the dates of the new moon for years 1885 to 1887 and showed that Thomson 's list fit the phases of the moon for 1886 . He concluded that the ancient Rapanui used a lunisolar calendar with <unk> as its <unk> month ( its " leap month " ) , and that Thomson chanced to land on Easter Island in a year with a leap month . 
 = = = = Ure Va â e Iko 's recitations = = = = 
 Thomson was told of an old man called Ure Va â e Iko who " professes to have been under instructions in the art of hieroglyphic reading at the time of the Peruvian raids , and claims to understand most of the characters " . He had been the steward of King Nga â ara , the last king said to have had knowledge of writing , and although he was not able to write himself , he knew many of the rongorongo chants and was able to read at least one memorized text . When Thomson plied him with gifts and money to read the two tablets he had purchased , Ure " declined most positively to ruin his chances for salvation by doing what his Christian instructors had forbidden " and finally fled . However , Thomson had taken photographs of Jaussen 's tablets when the USS Mohican was in Tahiti , and he eventually cajoled Ure into reading from those photographs . The English @-@ Tahitian landowner Alexander Salmon took down Ure 's dictation , which he later translated into English , for the following tablets : 
 Salmon 's Rapanui was not fluent , and apart from Atua Matariri , which is almost entirely composed of proper names , his English translations do not match what he transcribed of Ure 's readings . The readings themselves , seemingly reliable although difficult to interpret at first , become clearly ridiculous towards the end . The last recitation , for instance , which has been accepted as a love song on the strength of Salmon 's English translation , is interspersed with Tahitian phrases , including words of European origin , such as " the French flag " ( te <unk> <unk> ) and " give money for revealing [ this ] " ( <unk> <unk> e <unk> ) , which would not be expected on a pre @-@ contact text . The very title is a mixture of Rapanui and Tahitian : <unk> â a is Tahitian for " death " ; the Rapanui word is <unk> . Ure was an unwilling informant : even with duress , Thomson was only able to gain his cooperation with " the cup that cheers " ( that is , rum ) : 
 Finally [ Ure ] took to the hills with the determination to remain in hiding until after the departure of the Mohican . [ U ] <unk> strategy was the only resource after fair means had failed . [ When he ] sought the shelter of his own home on [ a ] rough night [ we ] took charge of the establishment . When he found escape impossible he became sullen , and refused to look at or touch a tablet [ but agreed to ] relate some of the ancient traditions . [ C ] <unk> stimulants which had been provided for such an emergency were produced , and [ â¦ ] as the night grew old and the narrator weary , he was included as the " cup that cheers " made its occasional rounds . [ A ] t an auspicious moment the photographs of the tablets owned by the bishop were produced for inspection . [ â¦ ] The photographs were recognized immediately , and the appropriate legend related with fluency and without hesitation from beginning to end . 
 Nonetheless , while no one has succeeded in correlating Ure 's readings with the rongorongo texts , they may yet have value for decipherment . The first two recitations , <unk> and Atua Matariri , are not corrupted with Tahitian . The verses of Atua Matariri are of the form X ki â ai ki roto Y , ka pÃ» te Z " X , by mounting into Y , let Z come forth " , and when taken literally , they appear to be nonsense : 
 " Moon , by mounting into Darkness , let Sun come forth " ( verse 25 ) , 
 " Killing , by mounting into Stingray , let Shark come forth " ( verse 28 ) , 
 " <unk> Fly , by mounting into Swarm , let Horsefly come forth " ( verse 16 ) . 
 These verses have generally been interpreted as creation chants , with various beings <unk> additional beings . However , they do not conform to Rapanui or other Polynesian creation mythology . Guy notes that the phrasing is similar to the way compound Chinese characters are described . For example , the composition of the Chinese character <unk> tÃ³ng " copper " may be described as " add å tÃ³ng to é jÄ«n to make <unk> tÃ³ng " ( meaning " add Together to Metal to make Copper " ) , which is also nonsense when taken literally . He hypothesizes that the Atua Matariri chant which Ure had heard in his youth , although unconnected to the particular tablet for which he recited it , was a genuine rongorongo chant : A mnemonic which taught students how the glyphs were composed . 
 = = Fanciful decipherments = = 
 Since the late nineteenth century , there has been all manner of speculation about rongorongo . Most remained obscure , but a few attracted considerable attention . 
 In 1892 the Australian pediatrician Alan Carroll published a fanciful translation , based on the idea that the texts were written by an extinct " Long @-@ Ear " population of Easter Island in a diverse mixture of Quechua and other languages of Peru and Mesoamerica . Perhaps due to the cost of casting special type for rongorongo , no method , analysis , or sound values of the individual glyphs were ever published . Carroll continued to publish short communications in Science of Man , the journal of the ( Royal ) Anthropological Society of Australasia until 1908 . Carroll had himself founded the society , which is " nowadays seen as forming part of the ' lunatic fringe ' . " 
 In 1932 the Hungarian Vilmos Hevesy ( Guillaume de Hevesy ) published an article claiming a relationship between rongorongo and the Indus Valley script , based on superficial similarities of form . This was not a new idea , but was now presented to the French Academy of Inscriptions and Literature by the French Sinologist Paul Pelliot and picked up by the press . Due to the lack of an accessible rongorongo corpus for comparison , it was not apparent that several of the rongorongo glyphs illustrated in Hevesy 's publications were spurious . Despite the fact that both scripts were undeciphered ( as they are to this day ) , separated by half the world and half of history ( 19 @,@ 000 km ( 12 @,@ 000 mi ) and 4000 years ) , and had no known intermediate stages , Hevesy 's ideas were taken seriously enough in academic circles to prompt a 1934 Franco â Belgian expedition to Easter Island led by <unk> and MÃ©traux to debunk them ( MÃ©traux 1939 ) . The Indus Valley connection was published as late as 1938 in such respected anthropological journals as Man . 
 At least a score of decipherments have been claimed since then , none of which have been accepted by other rongorongo epigraphers . For instance , ethnographer Irina Fedorova published purported translations of the two St Petersburg tablets and portions of four others . More rigorous than most attempts , she restricts each glyph to a single logographic reading . However , the results make little sense as texts . For example , tablet P begins ( with each rongorongo ligature marked by a comma in the translation ) : 
 he cut a rangi sugarcane , a tara yam , he cut lots of taro , of stalks ( ? ) , he cut a yam , he harvested , he cut a yam , he cut , he pulled up , he cut a <unk> , he cut a sugarcane , he cut , he harvested , he took , a kihi , he chose a kihi , he took a kihi â¦ 
 and continues in this vein to the end : 
 he harvested a yam , a poporo , a calabash , he pulled up a yam , he cut , he cut one plant , he cut one plant , a yam , he cut a banana , he harvested a sugarcane , he cut a taro , he cut a <unk> yam , a yam , a yam â¦ 
 The other texts are similar . For example , the Mamari calendar makes no mention of time or the moon in Fedorova 's account : 
 a root , a root , a root , a root , a root , a root [ that is , a lot of roots ] , a tuber , he took , he cut a potato tuber , he dug up yam shoots , a yam tuber , a potato tuber , a tuber â¦ 
 which even Fedorova characterized as " worthy of a maniac " . 
 Moreover , the allographs detected by Pozdniakov are given different readings by Fedorova , so that , for example , otherwise parallel texts repeatedly substitute the purported verb ma â u " take " for the purported noun <unk> " a kind of yam " . ( Pozdniakov has demonstrated that these are graphic variants of the same glyph . ) As it was , Fedorova 's catalog consisted of 130 glyphs ; Pozdniakov 's additional <unk> would have made her interpretation even more repetitive . Such extreme repetition is a problem with all attempts to read rongorongo as a logographic script . 
 Many recent scholars are of the opinion that , while many researchers have made modest incremental contributions to the understanding of rongorongo , notably Kudrjavtsev et al . , Butinov and Knorozov , and Thomas Barthel , the attempts at actual decipherment , such as those of Fedorova here or of Fischer below , " are not accompanied by the least justification " . All fail the key test of decipherment : a meaningful application to novel texts and patterns . 
 = = Harrison = = 
 James Park Harrison , a council member of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland , noticed that lines <unk> â 7 of the Small Santiago tablet featured a compound glyph , 380 @.@ 1 @.@ 3 ( a sitting figure 380 holding a rod 1 with a line of chevrons ( a garland ? ) 3 ) , repeated 31 times , each time followed by one to half a dozen glyphs before its next occurrence . He believed that this broke the text into sections containing the names of chiefs . Barthel later found this pattern on tablet K , which is a paraphrase of Gr ( in many of the K sequences the compound is reduced to 380 @.@ 1 ) , as well as on A , where it sometimes appears as 380 @.@ 1 @.@ 3 and sometimes as 380 @.@ 1 ; on C , E , and S as 380 @.@ 1 ; and , with the variant 380 @.@ 1 @.@ 52 , on N. In places it appears abbreviated as 1 @.@ 3 or 1 @.@ 52 , without the human figure , but parallels in the texts suggest these have the same separating function . Barthel saw the sequence 380 @.@ 1 as a tangata rongorongo ( rongorongo expert ) holding an inscribed staff like the Santiago Staff . 
 = = Kudrjavtsev et al . = = 
 During World War II , a small group of students in Saint Petersburg ( then Leningrad ) , Boris Kudrjavtsev , Valeri <unk> , and Oleg <unk> , became interested in tablets P , and Q , which they saw on display at the Museum of Ethnology and Anthropology . They discovered that they bore , with minor variation , the same text , which they later found on tablet H as well : 
 Parallel texts : A short excerpt of tablets H , P , and Q 
 Barthel would later call this the " Grand Tradition " , though its contents remain unknown . 
 The group later noticed that tablet K was a close paraphrase of the recto of G. Kudrjavtsev wrote up their findings , which were published posthumously . Numerous other parallel , though shorter , sequences have since been identified through statistical analysis , with texts N and R found to be composed almost entirely of phrases shared with other tablets , though not in the same order . 
 Identifying such shared phrasing was one of the first steps in unraveling the structure of the script , as it is the best way to detect ligatures and allographs , and thus to establish the inventory of rongorongo glyphs . 
 Ligatures : Parallel texts Pr4 â 5 ( top ) and <unk> ( bottom ) show that a figure ( glyph 200 ) holding an object ( glyphs 8 , 1 , and 9 ) in P may be fused into a ligature in H , where the object replaces either the figure 's head or its hand . ( Elsewhere in these texts , animal figures are reduced to a distinctive feature such as a head or arm when they fuse with a preceding glyph . ) Here also are the two hand shapes ( glyphs 6 and 64 ) which would later be established as allographs . Three of the four human and turtle figures at left have arm ligatures with an orb ( glyph 62 ) , which Pozdniakov found often marks a phrase boundary . 
 = = Butinov and Knorozov = = 
 In 1957 the Russian epigraphers Nikolai Butinov and Yuri Knorozov ( who in 1952 had provided the key insights which would later lead to the decipherment of the Maya writing system ) suggested that the repetitive structure of a sequence of some fifteen glyphs on <unk> â 6 ( lines 5 and 6 of the verso of the Small Santiago Tablet ) was compatible with a genealogy . It reads in part , 
 Now , if the repeated independent glyph 200 is a title , such as " king " , and if the repeated attached glyph 76 is a patronymic marker , then this means something like : 
 King A , B 's son , King B , C 's son , King C , D 's son , King D , E 's son , 
 and the sequence is a lineage . 
 Although no @-@ one has been able to confirm Butinov and Knorozov 's hypothesis , it is widely considered plausible . If it is correct , then , first , we can identify other glyph sequences which constitute personal names . Second , the Santiago Staff would consist mostly of persons ' names as it bears 564 occurrences of glyph 76 , the putative patronymic marker , one fourth of the total of 2320 glyphs . Third , the sequence 606 @.@ 76 700 , translated by Fischer ( below ) as " all the birds copulated with the fish " , would in reality mean ( So @-@ and @-@ so ) son of 606 was killed . The Santiago Staff , with 63 occurrences of glyph 700 , a rebus for Ã®ka " victim " , would then be in part a kohau Ã®ka ( list of war casualties ) . 
 = = Barthel = = 
 German ethnologist Thomas Barthel , who first published the rongorongo corpus , identified three lines on the recto ( side a ) of tablet C , also known as Mamari , as a lunar calendar . Guy proposed that it was more precisely an astronomical rule for whether one or two intercalary nights should be inserted into the 28 @-@ night Rapanui month to keep it in sync with the phases of the moon , and if one night , whether this should come before or after the full moon . <unk> and <unk> propose that it is the text which follows the identified calendar which shows where the intercalary nights should appear . The Mamari calendar is the only example of rongorongo whose function is currently accepted as being understood , though it cannot actually be read . 
 In Guy 's interpretation , the core of the calendar is a series of 29 left @-@ side crescents ( " <unk> " , colored red on the photo of the table at right ) on either side of the full moon , , a pictogram of te <unk> kÄ â umu â a rangi <unk> ' the old woman lighting an earth oven in the <unk> sky ' â the Man in the Moon of Oceanic mythology . These correspond to the 28 basic and two intercalary nights of the old Rapa Nui lunar calendar . 
 These thirty nights , starting with the new moon , are divided into eight groups by a " heralding sequence " of four glyphs ( above , and colored purple on the tablet at right ) which ends in the pictogram of a fish on a line ( yellow ) . The heralding sequences each contain two right @-@ side lunar crescents ( " <unk> " ) . In all four heralding sequences preceding the full moon the fish is head up ; in all four following it the fish is head down , suggesting the waxing and waning of the moon . The way the crescents are grouped together reflects the patterns of names in the old calendar . The two <unk> crescents at the end of the calendar , introduced with an expanded heralding sequence , represent the two intercalary nights held in reserve . The eleventh crescent , with the bulge , is where one of those nights is found in Thomson 's and MÃ©traux 's records . 
 Guy notes that the further the Moon is from the Earth in its eccentric orbit , the slower it moves , and the more likely the need to resort to an intercalary night to keep the calendar in sync with its phases . He hypothesizes that the " heralding sequences " are instructions to observe the apparent diameter of the Moon , and that the half @-@ size <unk> crescents ( orange ) preceding the sixth night before and sixth night after the full moon represent the small apparent diameter at apogee which triggers intercalation . ( The first small crescent corresponds to the position of <unk> in Thomson and MÃ©traux . ) 
 Seven of the calendrical crescents ( red ) are accompanied by other glyphs ( green ) . Guy suggests syllabic readings for some of these , based on possible <unk> and correspondences with the names of the nights in the old calendar . The two sequences of six and five nights without such accompanying glyphs ( beginning of line 7 , and transition of lines 7 â 8 ) correspond to the two groups of six and five numbered <unk> nights , which do not have individual names . 
 = = Fischer = = 
 In 1995 independent linguist Steven Fischer , who also claims to have deciphered the enigmatic <unk> Disc , announced that he had cracked the rongorongo " code " , making him the only person in history to have deciphered two such scripts . In the decade since , this has not been accepted by other researchers , who feel that Fischer overstated the single pattern which formed the basis of his decipherment , and note that it has not led to an understanding of other patterns . 
 = = = Decipherment = = = 
 Fischer notes that the long text of the 125 @-@ cm Santiago Staff is unlike other texts in that it appears to have punctuation : The 2 @,@ 320 @-@ glyph text is divided by " 103 vertical lines at odd intervals " which do not occur on any of the tablets . Fischer remarked that glyph 76 , identified as a possible patronymic marker by Butinov and Knorozov , is attached to the first glyph in each section of text , and that " almost all " sections contain a multiple of three glyphs , with the first bearing a 76 " suffix " . 
 Fischer identified glyph 76 as a phallus and the text of the Santiago Staff as a creation chant consisting of hundreds of repetitions of X â phallus Y Z , which he interpreted as X copulated with Y , there issued forth Z. His primary example was this one : 
 about half @-@ way through line 12 of the Santiago Staff . Fischer interpreted glyph 606 as " bird " + " hand " , with the phallus attached as usual at its lower right ; glyph 700 as " fish " ; and glyph 8 as " sun " . 
 On the basis that the Rapanui word ma â u " to take " is nearly homophonous with a plural marker mau , he posited that the hand of 606 was that plural marker , via a semantic shift of " hand " â " take " , and thus translated 606 as " all the birds " . Taking penis to mean " copulate " , he read the sequence 606 @.@ 76 700 8 as " all the birds copulated , fish , sun " . 
 Fischer supported his interpretation by claiming similarities to the recitation Atua Matariri , so called from its first words , which was collected by William Thomson . This recitation is a litany where each verse has the form X , ki â ai ki roto ki Y , ka pÃ» te Z , literally " X having been inside Y the Z comes forward " . Here is the first verse , according to Salmon and then according to MÃ©traux ( neither of whom wrote glottal stops or long vowels ) : 
 Atua Matariri ; Ki ai <unk> , Kia <unk> , Kapu te <unk> . 
 " God Atua Matariri and goddess <unk> produced thistle . " 
 Atua @-@ <unk> ki ai ki roto ki a te <unk> , ka pu te poporo . 
 " God @-@ of @-@ the @-@ angry @-@ look by copulating with Roundness ( ? ) produced the poporo ( black nightshade , Solanum nigrum ) . " 
 Fischer proposed that the glyph sequence 606 @.@ 76 700 8 , literally <unk> : MA â U. â AI <unk> RA â Ã " bird : <unk> fish sun " , had the analogous phonetic reading of : 
 te manu mau ki â ai ki roto ki te Ã®ka , ka pÃ» te ra â Ã¢ 
 " All the birds copulated with the fish ; there issued forth the sun . " 
 He claimed similar phallic triplets for several other texts . However , in the majority of texts glyph 76 is not common , and Fischer proposed that these were a later , more developed stage of the script , where the creation chants had been abbreviated to X Y Z and omit the phallus . He concluded that 85 % of the rongorongo corpus consisted of such creation chants , and that it was only a matter of time before rongorongo would be fully deciphered . 
 = = = Objections = = = 
 There are a number of objections to Fischer 's approach : 
 When Andrew Robinson checked the claimed pattern , he found that " Close inspection of the Santiago Staff reveals that only 63 out of the 113 [ sic ] sequences on the staff fully obey the triad structure ( and 63 is the maximum figure , giving every Fischer attribution the benefit of the doubt ) . " Glyph 76 occurs sometimes in isolation , sometimes compounded with itself , and sometimes in the ' wrong ' part ( or even all parts ) of the triplets . Other than on the Staff , Pozdniakov could find Fischer 's triplets only in the poorly preserved text of Ta and in the single line of Gv which Butinov and Knorozov suggested might be a genealogy . 
 Pozdniakov and Pozdniakov calculated that altogether the four glyphs of Fischer 's primary example make up 20 % of the corpus . " Hence it is easy to find examples in which , on the contrary , ' the sun copulates with the fish ' , and sometimes also with the birds . Fischer does not mention the resulting chaos in which everything is copulating in all manner of unlikely combinations . Furthermore , it is by no means obvious in what sense this ' breakthrough ' is ' phonetic ' . " 
 The plural marker mau does not exist in Rapanui , but is instead an element of Tahitian grammar . However , even if it did occur in Rapanui , Polynesian mau is only a plural marker when it precedes a noun ; after a noun it 's an adjective which means " true , genuine , proper " . 
 No Polynesian myth tells of birds copulating with fish to produce the sun . Fischer justifies his interpretation thus : This is very close to [ verse ] number 25 from Daniel Ure Va â e Iko 's procreation chant [ Atua Matariri ] " Land copulated with the fish <unk> <unk> : There issued forth the sun . " However , this claim depends on Salmon 's English translation , which does not follow from his Rapanui transcription of 
 <unk> ; Ki ai <unk> <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> Kapu te Raa . 
 MÃ©traux gives the following interpretation of that verse : 
 He Hina [ He ima ? ] ki ai ki roto kia Rui @-@ haka @-@ ma @-@ <unk> , ka pu te <unk> . 
 " Moon ( ? ) by copulating with Darkness ( ? ) produced Sun " , 
 which mentions neither birds nor fish . 
 Given Fischer 's reading , Butinov and Knorozov 's putative genealogy on tablet Gv becomes semantically odd , with several animate beings copulating with the same human figure to produce themselves : 
 [ turtle ] copulated with [ man ] , there issued forth [ turtle ] 
 [ shark ? ] copulated with [ man ] there issued forth [ shark ] 
 etc . 
 <unk> Tomi <unk> deduced that Fischer 's hypothesis cannot be true for the entire Staff , let alone other texts . 
 Computational linguist Richard Sproat could not replicate the parallels Fischer claimed between the Santiago Staff and the other texts . He automated the search for string matches between the texts and found that the staff stood alone : 
 As an attempt at a test for Fischer 's " phallus omission " assumption , we computed the same string matches for a version of the corpus where glyph 76 , the phallus symbol , had been removed . Presumably if many parts of the other tablets are really texts which are like the Santiago Staff , albeit sans explicit phallus , one ought to increase one 's chance of finding matches between the Staff and other tablets by removing the offending member . The results were the same as for the unadulterated version of the corpus : the Santiago staff still appears as an isolate . 
 = = Pozdniakov = = 
 In the 1950s , Butinov and Knorozov had performed a statistical analysis of several rongorongo texts and had concluded that either the language of the texts was not Polynesian , or that it was written in a condensed telegraphic style , because it contained no glyphs comparable in frequency to Polynesian grammatical particles such as the Rapanui articles te and he or the preposition ki . These findings have since been used to argue that rongorongo is not a writing system at all , but mnemonic proto @-@ writing . However , Butinov and Knorozov had used Barthel 's preliminary encoding , which Konstantin Pozdniakov , senior researcher at the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg ( until 1996 ) , noted was inappropriate for statistical analysis . The problem , as Butinov and Knorozov , and Barthel himself , had admitted , was that in many cases distinct numerical codes had been assigned to ligatures and allographs , as if these were independent glyphs . The result was that while Barthel 's numerical transcription of a text enabled a basic discussion of its contents for the first time , it failed to capture its linguistic structure and actually interfered with inter @-@ text comparison . 
 In 2011 , Pozdniakov released a pre @-@ press publication analyzing Text E Keiti , including a glyph @-@ by @-@ glyph comparison of the transcription in Barthel ( 1958 ) , with misidentified glyphs corrected per Horley ( 2010 ) . 
 = = = Revising the glyph inventory = = = 
 To resolve this deficiency , Pozdniakov ( 1996 ) reanalyzed thirteen of the better preserved texts , attempting to identify all ligatures and allographs in order to better approach a one @-@ to @-@ one correspondence between graphemes and their numeric representation . He observed that all these texts but I and G verso consist predominantly of shared phrases ( sequences of glyphs ) , which occur in different orders and contexts on different tablets . By 2007 he had identified some one hundred shared phrases , each between ten and one hundred glyphs long . Even setting aside the completely parallel texts Gr â K and the ' Grand Tradition ' of H â P â Q , he found that half of the remainder comprises such phrases : 
 <unk> : Variants of this twenty @-@ glyph phrase , all missing some of these glyphs or adding others , are found twelve times , in eight of the thirteen texts Pozdniakov tabulated : lines <unk> , <unk> â 3 , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> â 3 , <unk> , <unk> , Ra6 , <unk> , and <unk> . Among other things , such phrases have established or confirmed the reading order of some of the tablets . 
 These shared sequences begin and end with a notably restricted set of glyphs . For example , many begin or end , or both , with glyph 62 ( an arm ending in a circle : ) or with a ligature where glyph 62 replaces the arm or wing of a figure ( see the ligature image under Kudrjavtsev et al . ) . 
 Contrasting these phrases allowed Pozdniakov to determine that some glyphs occur in apparent free variation both in isolation and as components of ligatures . Thus he proposed that the two hand shapes , 6 ( three fingers and a thumb ) and 64 ( a four @-@ fingered forked hand ) , are graphic variants of a single glyph , which also attaches to or replaces the arms of various other glyphs : 
 <unk> : The ' hand ' allographs ( left ) , plus some of the fifty pairs of <unk> ' hand ' ligatures to which Barthel had assigned distinct character codes . 
 The fact the two hands appear to substitute for each other in all these pairs of glyphs when the repeated phrases are compared lends credence to their identity . Similarly , Pozdniakov proposed that the heads with " gaping mouths " , as in glyph 380 , are variants of the bird heads , so that the entirety of Barthel 's 300 and 400 series of glyphs are seen as either ligatures or variants of the 600 series . 
 Despite finding that some of the forms Barthel had assumed were allographs appeared instead to be independent glyphs , such as the two orientations of his glyph 27 , , the overall conflation of allographs and ligatures greatly reduced the size of Barthel 's published 600 @-@ glyph inventory . By recoding the texts with these findings and then <unk> them , Pozdniakov was able to detect twice as many shared phrases , which enabled him to further consolidate the inventory of glyphs . By 2007 , he and his father , a pioneer in Russian computer science , had concluded that 52 glyphs accounted for 99 @.@ 7 % of the corpus . From this he deduced that rongorongo is essentially a syllabary , though mixed with non @-@ syllabic elements , possibly determinatives or logographs for common words ( see below ) . The data analysis , however , has not been published . 
 The shared repetitive nature of the phrasing of the texts , apart from Gv and I , suggests to Pozdniakov that they are not integral texts , and cannot contain the varied contents which would be expected for history or mythology . In the following table of characters in the Pozdniakov & Pozdniakov inventory , ordered by descending frequency , the first two rows of 26 characters account for 86 % of the entire corpus . 
 = = = Statistical evidence = = = 
 With a rigorously derived inventory , Pozdniakov was able to test his ideas about the nature of the script . He tabulated the frequency distributions of glyphs in ten texts ( excluding the divergent Santiago Staff ) and found that they coincided with the distribution of syllables in ten archaic Rapanui texts such as the <unk> recitation , with nearly identical deviations from an ideal <unk> distribution . He took this as evidence both for rongorongo being essentially syllabic and for its being consistent with the Rapanui language . For example , the most common glyph , 6 , and the most common syllable , / a / , both make up 10 % of their corpora ; the syllables te and he , which Butinov and Knorozov found so problematic , could at 5 @.@ 7 % and 3 @.@ 5 % be associated with any number of common rongorongo glyphs . In addition , the numbers of glyphs linked or fused together closely match the numbers of syllables in Rapanui words , both in the texts overall and in their respective lexicons , suggesting that each combination of glyphs represents a word : 
 In both corpora there were many more monosyllables / single glyphs in running text than in the lexicon . That is , in both a relatively small number of such forms are very frequent , suggesting that rongorongo is compatible with Rapanui , which has a small number of very frequent monosyllabic grammatical particles . Rongorongo and Rapanui are also almost identical in the proportion of syllables / glyphs found in isolation and in initial , medial , and final position within a word / ligature . 
 However , while such statistical tests demonstrate that rongorongo is consistent with a syllabic Rapanui script , syllables are not the only thing which can produce this result . In the Rapanui texts , some two dozen common polysyllabic words , such as ariki ' leader ' , <unk> ' name ' , and <unk> ' two ' , have the same frequency as a score of syllables , while other syllables such as / tu / are less frequent than these words . 
 This suspicion that rongorongo may not be fully syllabic is supported by positional patterns within the texts . The distributions of Rapanui syllables within polysyllabic words and of rongorongo glyphs within ligatures are very similar , strengthening the syllabic connection . However , monosyllabic words and isolated glyphs behave very differently ; here rongorongo does not look at all syllabic . For example , all glyphs but 901 are attested in isolation , whereas only half of the 55 Rapanui syllables occur as monosyllabic words . Furthermore , among those syllables which do occur in isolation , their rate of doing so is much lower than that of the glyphs : Only three syllables , / te / , / he / , and / ki / , occur more than half the time in isolation ( as grammatical particles ) , whereas a score of glyphs are more commonly found in isolation than not . Contextual analysis may help explain this : Whereas Rapanui monosyllables are grammatical particles and generally precede polysyllabic nouns and verbs , so that monosyllables rarely occur together , isolated rongorongo glyphs are usually found together , suggesting a very different function . Pozdniakov hypothesizes that the difference may be due to the presence of determinatives , or that glyphs have dual functions , as phonograms in combination but as logograms in isolation , parallel to the Maya script . On the other hand , no glyph approaches the frequency , when in isolation , of the articles te and he or the preposition ki in running text . It may be that these particles were simply not written , but Pozdniakov suspects that they were written together with the following word , as is the case with prepositions and articles in Classical Latin and written Arabic . 
 Further complicating this picture are repetition patterns . There are two types of repetition in Rapanui words : double syllables within roots , as in <unk> , and grammatical reduplication of <unk> , as seen in rongorongo . In the Rapanui lexicon , double syllables as in <unk> are 50 % more likely than chance can explain . However , in the rongorongo texts , analogous double AA glyphs are only 8 % more likely than chance . Similarly , in the Rapanui lexicon reduplicated <unk> such as rongorongo are seven times as common as chance , constituting a quarter of the vocabulary , whereas , in rongorongo texts , ABAB sequences are only twice as likely as chance , and 10 % of the vocabulary . If rongorongo is a phonetic script , therefore , this discrepancy needs to be explained . Pozdniakov suggests that perhaps there was a ' <unk> ' glyph , or that modifications of glyphs , such as facing heads to the left rather than to the right , may have indicated repetition . 
 = = = Sound values = = = 
 The results of statistical analysis will be strongly affected by any errors in identifying the inventory of glyphs , as well as by divergence from a purely syllabic representation , such as a glyph for reduplication . There are also large differences in the frequencies of individual syllables among the Rapanui texts , which makes any direct identification problematic . While Pozdniakov has not been able to assign any phonetic values with any certainty , statistical results do place constraints on which values are possible . 
 One possibility for a logogram of the most common word in Rapanui , the article te , is the most common glyph , 200 , which does not pattern like a <unk> . Glyph 200 occurs mostly in initial position and is more frequent in running text than any syllable in the Rapanui lexicon , both characteristics of the article . A possibility for a <unk> glyph is 3 , which is also very common and does not pattern like a <unk> , but occurs predominantly in final position . 
 Because a repeated word or phrase , such as the ubiquitous ki â ai ki roto in the Atua Matariri recitation , will skew the statistics of that text , phonetic frequencies are best compared using word lists ( considering each word individually ) rather than the full texts . Pozdniakov used a few basic correlations between Rapanui and rongorongo to help narrow down the possible phonetic values of the glyphs . For instance , the relative frequencies of rongorongo glyphs in initial , medial , and final position in a ligature presumably constrain their possible sound values to syllables with similar distributions within the lexicon . Syllables beginning with ng , for example , are more common at the ends of words than in initial position . The overall frequencies , and the patterns of doubling and reduplication , on the other hand , seem to associate arm glyphs specifically with vocalic syllables : 
 Overall frequency . Syllables without a consonant ( vocalic syllables ) are more common in Rapanui than syllables beginning with any of the ten consonants . Of the vowels , / a / is more than twice as frequent as any of the others . Thus the syllables comprising more than 3 % of the Rapanui lexicon are / i / , / e / , / a / , / o / , / u / ; / ta / , / ra / , / ka / , / na / , / ma / ; and / ri / . ( The three most common , the vocalic syllables / a / , / i / , / u / , comprise a full quarter of the corpus . ) The glyphs comprising more than 3 % of the rongorongo corpus are , in order , 200 , 6 or , 10 , 3 , 62 , 400 , 61 . As noted above , 200 and 3 do not pattern as phonograms . Of the remaining five , four are limbs ( arms or wings ) . 
 Reduplication . In grammatical reduplication , vowels are also the most common syllables ; so are the glyphs 6 , 10 , 61 , 62 , 901 , all limbs . 
 Doubling . Among doubled syllables , however , vocalic syllables are much less common . Four syllables , / i / , / a / , / u / , / ma / , are less commonly doubled than chance would dictate . Three glyphs are less common when doubled than chance as well : 6 , 10 , and 63 , two of them limbs . 
 The exceptionally high frequencies of glyph 6 and of the syllable / a / , everywhere except when doubled , suggest that glyph 6 may have the sound value / a / . Pozdniakov proposes with less confidence that the second most extreme glyph , 10 , might have the sound value / i / . 
 = = = Objections = = = 
 As Pozdniakov readily admits , his analysis is highly sensitive to the accuracy of the glyph inventory . Since he has not published the details of how he established this inventory , it is not possible for others to verify his work . 
 As of 2008 , there has been little response to Pozdniakov 's approach . However , Sproat ( 2007 ) believes that the results from the frequency distributions are nothing more than an effect of Zipf 's Law , and furthermore that neither rongorongo nor the old texts were representative of the Rapanui language , so that a comparison between them is unlikely to be enlightening . 
 = = De Laat = = 
 Another decipherment , self @-@ published by Mary de Laat in 2009 , covers three texts , A , B , and E. Horley ( 2010 ) is a critical review . All three texts are proposed to consist of nothing but extended dialogue . It would be remarkable enough for these rare pieces of wood to record the banal exchanges de Laat attributes to them , yet the ligature 380 @.@ 1 , which de Laat identified as a man named Taea , is found in six of the surviving texts , fully half of the corpus that is indisputably authentic and in good condition , presenting this figure , who is supposed to have murdered his wife , as one of the most important protagonists in the Rapa Nui tradition . Yet there is no such Taea in the surviving Rapa Nui oral literature . This ligature for Taea is the one that was identified by Harrison as a marker for dividing lists , and found by Barthel to have parallels on yet other texts in the forms 380 @.@ 1 @.@ 3 and 1 @.@ 3 . However , despite the parallel content of these texts , de Laat 's translations of them are quite divergent , because his purely phonetic reading does not allow him to read 1 @.@ 3 as " Taea " . The participants in the dialogues must therefore be different , and de Laat 's segmentation of the texts is " unstable " . There are also fatal grammatical errors , and readings that turn out to be post @-@ colonial Tahitian loans . In response to such criticism , de Laat has begun to " substantially revise " his translations . 
 = Black honeyeater = 
 The black honeyeater ( Sugomel nigrum ) is a species of bird in the family of honeyeaters , Meliphagidae , and the sole species in the genus Sugomel . The black honeyeater exhibits sexual dimorphism with the male being black and white while the female is a speckled grey @-@ brown ; immature birds look like the female . The species is endemic to Australia , and ranges widely across the arid areas of the continent , through open woodland and shrubland , particularly in areas where the emu bush and related species occur . 
 Black honeyeaters feed on nectar , and have a long curved bill to reach the base of tubular flowers such as those of the emu bush . They also take insects on the wing , and regularly eat charcoal left behind at campfires . The male engages in a soaring song flight in the mating season , but contributes little to nest building and incubation . Both sexes feed and care for the young . While the population appears to be decreasing , they are sufficiently numerous and widespread to be considered of Least Concern in terms of conservation . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The black honeyeater was first described by John Gould in 1838 as Myzomela nigra , using the Latin adjective niger to refer to the black plumage of the male . The genus name was derived from the Ancient Greek words <unk> ' to suckle ' and meli ' honey ' , and referred to the bird 's <unk> habits . In 1967 ornithologist Finn Salomonsen transferred the species from Myzomela to the genus Certhionyx , which also contained the banded honeyeater ( Certhionyx pectoralis ) and pied honeyeater ( Certhionyx variegatus ) , and later authorities accepted this classification . However , in 2004 genetic study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of honeyeaters resolved it as in a natural group with Myzomela after all , although it was an early offshoot and quite divergent genetically . It was subsequently reclassified in its own genus Sugomel . It is identified as Sugomel niger by most taxonomic authorities , and Sugomel nigrum by the IOC <unk> . 
 DNA analysis has shown honeyeaters to be related to the Pardalotidae ( pardalotes ) , Acanthizidae ( Australian warblers , scrubwrens , thornbills , etc . ) , and the Maluridae ( Australian fairy @-@ wrens ) in a large Meliphagoidea superfamily . The Papuan black myzomela , ( Myzomela <unk> ) , found in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea is also known as the black honeyeater . It is a different but related species . 
 = = Description = = 
 The black honeyeater is a small honeyeater with a long slender down @-@ curved bill , a small rounded head and slender neck set on a plump body , and a short , slightly cleft tail . It has relatively long , pointed wings compared with other Meliphagidae , and very long wings for such a small bird , the development of which has been attributed to its feeding behaviour of flying between shrubs and hovering over flowers . 
 The species is strongly sexually dimorphic . Adult males are black and white , with a black head , neck , wings and upperparts , and a black stripe running down from the centre of the chest to the abdomen , and with a white belly , flanks and under @-@ tail coverts . The female â s crown , ear coverts and upper parts are buff brown , scalloped paler , with a pale eyebrow , and the chest is speckled grey @-@ brown grading into a dull white belly . In both male and female the iris is dark brown and the bill and legs blackish brown . Immature birds are similar to the adult female , however the upper breast and throat tend to be more uniform and the base of the bill is paler . Immature birds are not separable from adults at a distance . 
 The black honeyeater is quiet outside the breeding season , but calls before and during nesting , often early in the morning . The calls include a soft metallic " <unk> , <unk> " ; a louder note , a " tieee " , with a monotonously even pitch and spacing at intervals of several seconds ; and a weak " <unk> " , usually uttered by breeding males . In high song flights the males give a double noted " tieee @-@ tieee " . A soft scolding call is given by both sexes after the young hatch , which may be a food call for the young . The species is also heard making a bill snap when hawking insects . It is constantly on the move , hovering and hawking when feeding , and constantly chasing intruders at food sources . Gould described its flight as " remarkably quick , and performed with zigzag starts " . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The black honeyeater is a bird of the dry inland of Australia , being generally widespread if scattered in western Queensland and New South Wales to the South Australian border and occasionally recorded in the Victorian Mallee and Wimmera regions . In South Australia , it occurs in the south @-@ east and it is widespread in the central and northern regions of Western Australia , with some rare records in the south near Kalgoorlie . In the Northern Territory it is widespread around Alice Springs , with some vagrants to the Top End . 
 It is dependent on the presence of the emu bush Eremophila longifolia and related species . As a result , the black honeyeater is found in open woodlands and shrublands of arid and semi @-@ arid regions , as well as in mulga or mallee woodlands , and it will also be found in spinifex savanna where flowering shrubs such as grevilleas and paperbarks occur . It has been noted that the black honeyeater is able to locate emu bushes , even when clumps consisted of only two or three trees and were separated by many kilometres of country , which suggests the importance of this plant @-@ bird association . 
 The black honeyeaters is considered to be migratory rather than nomadic , with regular seasonal movements related to flowering of food plants , especially the emu bush . Some movements are southwards in spring and summer , moving northwards again in autumn and winter . During severe droughts it has been recorded south of Bendigo and in the Hunter Region . <unk> ( sudden population increases ) can occur in some areas after rain or the movement of floodwaters . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 = = = Food and feeding = = = 
 The black honeyeater feeds on nectar , probing flowers and foliage with its long fine bill . It is mainly found in the crowns of eucalypts , at clumps of mistletoe or in shrubs , especially emu bushes Eremophila . Observations over a twelve @-@ month period in South Australia recorded black honeyeaters visiting the flowers of Eremophila longifolia , Eremophila oppositifolia , Eucalyptus <unk> , and Grevillea ilicifolia . They were also frequently observed hawking for small insects . The black honeyeater hovers briefly around flowers when feeding . Normally found alone , in pairs or in small flocks , they may sometimes form large mixed flocks at food sources , associating with other birds such as pied honeyeaters and white @-@ browed woodswallows . Like many other honeyeaters , the black honeyeater catches insects on the wing . The male , in particular , will rise to a height of 15 metres ( 49 ft ) to seize an insect in mid @-@ air , and then drop to a regularly used perch . 
 A study of black honeyeaters at seven sites in Western Australia regularly recorded breeding females eating ash from the campsite fires and often making repeated visits over a brief period of time . It was noted that the birds seemed attracted to the remote campfire with groups of around six hovering around and landing beside the fire , an activity described as similar to " bees buzzing around a honeypot . " After pecking at the ash , some of the females foraged for insects , sallying from the foliage of nearby Wheatbelt <unk> ( Eucalyptus <unk> ) before returning for more ash . The activity of the females approaching the fire ranged from a single peck to sustained feeding for a minute or more . Male birds occasionally landed near the fire , but none were seen to take ash . Well developed brood patches on the birds mist netted near the fires , suggest that the females take ash around the time of laying , and throughout the incubation and feeding period . Wood ash is rich in calcium and it was hypothesised that the females were eating ash to form medullary bone before egg @-@ laying or to repair a calcium deficit after laying . When other small birds , such as American hummingbirds , were recorded eating calcium @-@ rich ash , bones or shell it was suggested that the bones of small species may not be able to store enough calcium for egg production . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 The breeding season is from July to December ( mostly between August and November ) , or opportunistically after rain . There is apparently some variation based upon location , with birds in West Australia breeding earlier and breeding in March in Queensland . Black honeyeater populations concentrate for breeding wherever the right plants are in flower and there is an abundance of insects , essential for feeding the young . At the beginning of the mating season , males can be seen soaring in " song flights " which consist of a series of zigzagging movements , high into the air , accompanied by constant calling . The birds appear to stiffen themselves , with wings pointed downward , as they rise , while uttering a two @-@ note call . 
 Breeding pairs of black honeyeaters will nest in groups or loose colonies , with males aggressively defending a small breeding territory against members of their own species as well as other honeyeaters . Both members of the pair seem to be involved in selecting the nest site . The nest is usually situated low on a dead limb or in a fork of a small tree or shrub , though sometimes fallen timber including a fallen Callitris pine is chosen as the nest site . The female gathers nesting material close to the nest site , while the male is engaged in song flights , and she builds the shallow , open , cup @-@ shaped nest from fine twigs , grass , and other plant material bound with spiderweb , lining it with grass , roots , fibre , horse hair , flowers or wool . As the young grow the nest can become flattened to a saucer shape , and may be an almost flat platform by the time the chicks fledge . 
 The female lays two to three eggs that are 15 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 59 in ) long , 12 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 47 in ) wide and an unusual swollen oval shape . The eggs are slightly lustrous , buffy white in colour and dotted with reddish @-@ brown and grey blotches that often appear in a cloud over the larger end of the eggs . Black honeyeater nests are occasionally parasitised by Horsfield 's Bronze Cuckoo . The female incubates alone , leaving the eggs exposed for short periods during the day to take insects on the wing . When approached , the sitting bird attempts to hide by sinking into the nest and , if unsuccessful in deterring the intruder , will tumble to the ground with outstretched wings , giving weak calls in an effort to lure the intruder away from the nest . 
 While the female is incubating , the male remains on guard at one of several regular vantage points . The incubation period is around sixteen days , and the fledging period approximately eighteen days . On hatching , the young birds ' eyes are closed , and they are naked except for tufts of down on the head , nape and back . Both sexes feed and care for the young , taking all of the insects for the young birds on the wing . At one nest , two small young were fed every ten minutes or so , with the male bringing food three to four times more often than the female . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 The black honeyeater may be adversely affected by the loss of the emu bush to grazing and weed control by farmers . Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing , the decline is not believed to be particularly rapid ; the current population seems to be of sufficient numbers , and the species has a sufficiently large range , for the species to be evaluated as of Least Concern . 
 = A2 ( Croatia ) = 
 The A2 motorway ( Croatian : Autocesta A2 ) is a motorway in the Hrvatsko Zagorje region of northern Croatia , connecting Zagreb to the Macelj border crossing and Slovenia . The A2 motorway is part of the European route E59 and the Pan @-@ European Corridor Xa . The motorway spans 59 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 36 @.@ 8 mi ) between the Slovenian border and the Jankomir interchange within the Zagreb bypass , providing road connections to a number of cities and towns besides Zagreb , including Krapina , Zabok and ZapreÅ¡iÄ . All sections of the motorway , except the northernmost one between the Macelj border crossing and TrakoÅ¡Äan , and the southernmost one near Zagreb , are tolled , using a closed toll collection system . 
 Construction of the motorway began in 1990 , <unk> a decade @-@ long hiatus between the mid @-@ 1990s and 2004 caused by funding issues and the setting up of a separate company to develop and operate the motorway meant it was not completed until 2007 . As of July 2011 , the entire motorway route is completed , consisting of a dual @-@ carriageway and four traffic lanes , except for a relatively short segment which is still a single carriageway road . The motorway is currently operated by Autocesta Zagreb - Macelj . 
 The motorway carries a considerable volume of traffic throughout the year ; however , in the summer , its peak volume is nearly double the average , as traffic intensifies because of tourists travelling to Adriatic Sea resorts and back . Furthermore , the southernmost sections of the motorway serve Zagreb 's sizeable suburban traffic . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The A2 motorway is an important north â south motorway in Croatia , connecting the capital of the country , Zagreb , to Graz , Austria , via Maribor , Slovenia , as well as Vienna and other destinations along the <unk> route . The motorway follows a route through the Hrvatsko Zagorje region . Part of the road network of Croatia , the motorway is also part of European route E59 Zagreb â Graz â Vienna â Prague . The motorway is of major importance to Croatia in terms of economic development , especially for tourism and as a transit transport route . The road carries significant transit and tourist traffic as it connects to the Zagreb bypass segment of the A3 motorway , which serves as a hub distributing the southbound traffic to either eastbound A3 or southbound A1 , and vice versa . As of the June 1997 Pan @-@ European Transport Conference in Helsinki , the motorway is part of the Pan @-@ European Corridor Xa . 
 The motorway spans 59 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 36 @.@ 8 mi ) between the Macelj border crossing , Slovenia and the Zagreb â Jankomir interchange on the A3 motorway . The route serves Zagreb via the <unk> at the Jankomir interchange , ZapreÅ¡iÄ via the D225 , Zabok , <unk> and <unk> via the <unk> , Sveti KriÅ¾ <unk> via the <unk> , Krapina and <unk> via the <unk> , Äurmanec via the <unk> and TrakoÅ¡Äan via the <unk> . The D1 state road runs as a parallel , toll @-@ free route along the motorway , and most of the motorway exits connect to that route directly , switching to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> shortly afterwards . 
 The A2 motorway has at least two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each direction along its entire length , except in tunnels , where there are emergency bays instead . All of the interchanges are trumpet interchanges , except the Jankomir interchange , which is a cloverleaf interchange . There are a number of rest areas along the motorway providing various types of services , ranging from simple parking spaces and restrooms to filling stations , restaurants and hotels . As of July 2011 , the motorway has seven interchanges providing access to numerous towns and cities and the Croatian state road network . The motorway is operated by the Autocesta Zagreb â Macelj company . 
 An automatic traffic monitoring and guidance system is in place along the motorway . It consists of measuring , control and signalling devices located in zones where driving conditions may vary , such as at interchanges , viaducts , bridges , tunnels and zones where fog and strong wind are known to occur . The system uses variable traffic signs to communicate changing driving conditions , possible restrictions and other information to motorway users . The A2 motorway mainly runs through the plains and rolling hills of Hrvatsko Zagorje region , although the northernmost sections of the route traverse rugged terrain , requiring a number of viaducts and long tunnels along the route . 
 = = Toll = = 
 The A2 is a tolled motorway , based on the vehicle classification in Croatia , using a closed toll system . As of July 2011 , the toll charged along the A2 route between the ZapreÅ¡iÄ and TrakoÅ¡Äan mainline toll plazas varies depending on the length of route travelled , ranging from 11 @.@ 00 kuna ( 1 @.@ 44 euros ) to 42 @.@ 00 kuna ( 5 @.@ 48 euros ) for passenger cars and 47 @.@ 00 kuna ( 6 @.@ 13 euro ) to 187 @.@ 00 kuna ( 24 @.@ 40 euro ) for semi @-@ trailer trucks . The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros and by major credit and debit cards . A prepaid toll collection system is also used . The A2 is the only motorway in Croatia which does not provide for use of the ENC â an electronic toll collection ( ETC ) system shared by most motorways in Croatia that provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas . In addition to the vehicle classification in Croatia , the motorway operator maintains an additional vehicle category for motorbikes , which are charged from 7 @.@ 00 kuna ( 0 @.@ 91 euros ) to 25 @.@ 00 kuna ( 3 @.@ 26 euros ) toll . The southernmost Jankomir â ZapreÅ¡iÄ section of the motorway is not tolled , as it is part of the Zagreb bypass . 
 The toll collected by Autocesta Zagreb â Macelj from the A2 motorway in the first quarter of 2011 amounted to 27 @.@ 7 million kuna ( 3 @.@ 61 million euros ) ; however , this period does not include the significantly increased tourist traffic during the summer . In 2010 , Autocesta Zagreb â Macelj collected 166 @.@ 9 million kuna ( 22 @.@ 4 million euros ) from A2 tolls .

 The southernmost section of the motorway , between the Jankomir and ZapreÅ¡iÄ interchanges , forms part of the Zagreb bypass and entails a number of viaducts spanning roads and railways , including a 373 @-@ metre ( 1 @,@ 224 ft ) viaduct across the Zagreb â Ljubljana railway . Furthermore , the section comprises the Sava River Bridge , spanning 1 @,@ 072 metres ( 3 @,@ 517 ft ) . All the structures along the section are executed as dual structures with four traffic lanes . 
 The northernmost segment between the Krapina interchange and the Macelj border crossing traverses rugged terrain , requiring further viaducts and tunnels . Among those , the most notable ones are the 579 @-@ metre ( 1 @,@ 900 ft ) <unk> Viaduct and the 1 @,@ 740 @-@ metre ( 5 @,@ 710 ft ) Sveta Tri <unk> Tunnel . The tunnel is part of a sequence of two tunnels and three viaducts in a 3 @.@ 7 @-@ kilometre ( 2 @.@ 3 mi ) segment between Krapina and Äurmanec . Generally , the Krapina â Macelj border crossing segment of the A2 motorway required numerous expensive engineering works , including six tunnels and nine viaducts , which caused the construction cost to be over 235 million euros . 
 = = History = = 
 In the 1960s , various levels of government in the Socialist Republic of Croatia initiated planning processes aimed at development of road transport infrastructure of the then constituent republic of Yugoslavia . The first proposal of a motorway link in Croatia was made by Josip <unk> , a member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts at the time . He proposed the motorway to be built between Zagreb and Split . In 1962 , a formal proposal was made by local authorities in Split , resulting in Croatian government adopting a framework motorway development plan in 1966 . Designs were commissioned in 1967 , extending the route north to Maribor , Slovenia for the first time . The extension largely used the same corridor as an existing Zagreb â Maribor road â Zagorje Highway â a congested and insufficiently safe two @-@ lane road with at @-@ grade intersections , connecting numerous towns and villages between Zagreb and Maribor . The road itself represented yet another upgrade of a transport route recorded along Zagreb â Maribor corridor since Middle Ages . The plan was shelved because of political pressures following suppression of Croatian Spring only to be reinstated upon Croatian independence from Yugoslavia . 
 The first section of the present A2 motorway was completed as a single @-@ carriageway limited @-@ access road between the Jankomir and ZapreÅ¡iÄ interchanges , forming the westernmost section of Zagreb bypass , in 1990 . The section included a number of bridges and viaducts , spanning the Sava River and numerous roads and railroads , making construction of a dual @-@ carriageway prohibitively expensive at the time . In 1991 , the 7 @.@ 4 @-@ kilometre ( 4 @.@ 6 mi ) section was extended by 17 kilometres ( 11 mi ) of dual @-@ carriage motorway to Zabok . Lack of funding greatly slowed further construction , and the following 16 @.@ 2 @-@ kilometre ( 10 @.@ 1 mi ) section to Velika Ves , south of Krapina , was only completed in 1996 . Further construction was suspended due to lack of available funding . 
 In 1997 , the governments of the Republic of Croatia and the German state of Bavaria made a joint declaration regarding their future transport infrastructure development cooperation . The cooperation primarily dealt with the construction of the remaining A2 motorway sections and the Franjo TuÄman Bridge , and the two issues were formally settled between the Croatian government and Walter Bau AG . In 2003 , the Autocesta Zagreb â Macelj company was established by the Croatian government and was awarded a concession contract to operate the motorway . Furthermore , a joint investment agreement with Walter Bau AG was signed by the government , effectively securing the financial assets required to resume construction . In 2004 , <unk> replaced Walter Bau AG as a contract partner and construction finally resumed . In 2006 , the section between Jankomir and ZapreÅ¡iÄ was upgraded to dual @-@ carriage motorway , and the motorway was extended to Krapina itself . In 2007 , after 33 months of construction defined by the contracts , the motorway was completed along its entire length , except for a short segment near Krapina which , as of July 2011 , is still a single @-@ carriageway road . The total cost of the motorway was approximately 372 million euros . The largest portion of the total pertains to the northernmost 20 @-@ kilometre ( 12 mi ) section between Krapina and Macelj , which was reported to cost 235 million euros . 
 = = Further construction = = 
 As of 2012 , the 3 @.@ 7 @-@ kilometre ( 2 @.@ 3 mi ) segment of the motorway between Krapina and Äurmanec is still missing the second carriageway . The upgrading of this segment is planned , as the Croatian government reportedly concluded talks regarding the matter with the motorway operator in 2010 . The upgrade is expected to take one year and cost 50 million euros . 
 = = Traffic volume = = 
 Traffic is regularly counted and reported by Autocesta Zagreb â Macelj , the operator of the motorway , and is published by Hrvatske <unk> . As the motorway traffic volume is measured through an analysis of toll ticket sales , the southernmost section of the motorway , Jankomir - ZapreÅ¡iÄ , is not included in this report , as it is not tolled . However , since the section is a part of Zagreb bypass , it is considered to carry heavier traffic than any other section of the A2 motorway . In 2006 , it carried more than 22 @,@ 000 vehicles per day , and its traffic volume grew considerably since the completion of the motorway in 2007 . 
 Variations between AADT and average summer daily traffic ( ASDT ) traffic volumes are attributed to the fact that the motorway carries substantial tourist traffic to the Adriatic Sea resorts during the summer . On average , the tolled section of the A2 motorway carries 90 % more ASDT than AADT . The largest increase , 125 % , of the ASDT relative to the AADT is observed on the Äurmanec â TrakoÅ¡Äan section . 
 = = Rest areas = = 
 As of July 2011 , there are three rest areas along the A2 motorway . Legislation identifies four types of rest areas designated as types A through D : A @-@ type rest areas comprise a full range of amenities , including a filling station , a restaurant and a hotel or motel ; B @-@ type rest areas have no lodging ; C @-@ type rest areas are very common and include a filling station and a cafÃ© , but no restaurants or accommodations ; D @-@ type rest areas only offer parking spaces , possibly picnicking tables and benches and restrooms . Most rest areas along the A2 motorway generally follow this ranking system , although some offer extra services . Many filling stations have small convenience stores , and some offer LPG fuel . 
 The primary motorway operator , Hrvatske autoceste ( HAC ) , leases the A , B and C type rest areas to various operators through public tenders . As of July 2011 , there are two such rest area operators on the A2 motorway : INA and OMV . The rest area operators are not permitted to sub @-@ lease the fuel operations . The A2 motorway rest areas are accessible from both directions of the motorway and operate 24 hours a day , 7 days a week .

 = The Wire = 
 The Wire is an American crime drama television series set and produced in and around Baltimore , Maryland . Created and primarily written by author and former police reporter David Simon , the series was broadcast by the cable network HBO in the United States . The Wire premiered on June 2 , 2002 , and ended on March 9 , 2008 , comprising 60 episodes over five seasons . 
 Each season of The Wire introduces a different institution in the city of Baltimore and its relationship to law enforcement , while retaining characters and advancing storylines from previous seasons . In chronological order these institutions are : the illegal drug trade , the seaport system , the city government and bureaucracy , the school system , and the print news media . The large cast consists mainly of actors who are little known for their other roles , as well as numerous real @-@ life Baltimore and Maryland figures in guest and recurring roles . Simon has said that despite its framing as a crime drama , the show is " really about the American city , and about how we live together . It 's about how institutions have an effect on individuals . Whether one is a cop , a longshoreman , a drug dealer , a politician , a judge or a lawyer , all are ultimately compromised and must contend with whatever institution to which they are committed . " 
 The Wire is lauded for its literary thematics ; its uncommonly acute exploration of social and political themes ; and its realistic portrayal of urban life . Although the show received average ratings throughout its run , and never won any major television awards , it has since come to be regarded by many critics as one of the greatest television dramas of all time . 
 = = Production = = 
 = = = Conception = = = 
 Simon has stated that he originally set out to create a police drama loosely based on the experiences of his writing partner Ed Burns , a former homicide detective . Burns , when working on protracted investigations of violent drug dealers using surveillance technology , had often been frustrated by the bureaucracy of the Baltimore police department ; Simon saw similarities with his own ordeals as a police reporter for The Baltimore Sun . 
 Simon chose to set the show in Baltimore because of his familiarity with the city . During his time as a writer and producer for the NBC program Homicide : Life on the Street , based on his book Homicide : A Year on the Killing Streets ( 1991 ) , also set in Baltimore , Simon had come into conflict with NBC network executives who were displeased by the show 's pessimism . Simon wanted to avoid a repeat of these conflicts and chose to take The Wire to HBO , because of their working relationship from the miniseries The Corner ( 2000 ) . HBO was initially doubtful about including a police drama in its lineup but eventually agreed to produce the pilot episode . Simon approached the mayor of Baltimore , telling him that he wanted to give a bleak portrayal of certain aspects of the city ; Simon was welcomed to work there again . He hoped the show would change the opinions of some viewers but said that it was unlikely to affect the issues it portrays . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 The casting of the show has been praised for avoiding big @-@ name stars and using character actors who appear natural in their roles . The looks of the cast as a whole have been described as defying TV expectations by presenting a true range of humanity on screen . Most of the cast is African @-@ American , consistent with the demographics of Baltimore . 
 The initial cast was assembled through a process of auditions and readings . Lance Reddick received the role of Cedric Daniels after auditioning for several other parts . Michael K. Williams got the part of Omar Little after only a single audition . 
 Several prominent real @-@ life Baltimore figures , including former Maryland Governor Robert L. Ehrlich Jr . ; Rev. Frank M. Reid III ; former police chief , convicted felon , and radio personality Ed Norris ; Virginia Delegate Rob Bell ; Baltimore Sun reporter and editor David <unk> ; Howard County Executive Ken <unk> ; and former mayor Kurt Schmoke have appeared in minor roles despite not being professional actors . " Little Melvin " Williams , a Baltimore drug lord arrested in the 1980s by an investigation that Ed Burns had been part of , had a recurring role as a deacon beginning in the third season . Jay Landsman , a longtime police officer who inspired the character of the same name , played Lieutenant Dennis Mello . Baltimore police commander Gary D 'Addario served as the series technical advisor for the first two seasons and has a recurring role as prosecutor Gary <unk> . Simon shadowed D 'Addario 's shift when researching his book Homicide : A Year on the Killing Streets and both D 'Addario and Landsman are subjects of the book . 
 More than a dozen cast members previously appeared on HBO 's first hour @-@ long drama Oz . J. D. Williams , Seth Gilliam , Lance Reddick , and Reg E. Cathey were featured in very prominent roles in Oz , while a number of other notable stars of The Wire , including Wood Harris , Frankie Faison , John Doman , Clarke Peters , <unk> Lombardozzi , Michael Hyatt , Michael Potts , and Method Man appeared in at least one episode of Oz . Cast members Erik Dellums , Peter Gerety , Clark Johnson , Clayton LeBouef , Toni Lewis and Callie Thorne also appeared on Homicide : Life on the Street , the earlier and award @-@ winning network television series also based on Simon 's book ; Lewis appeared on Oz as well . A number of cast members , as well as crew members , also appeared in the preceding HBO miniseries The Corner including Clarke Peters , Reg E. Cathey , Lance Reddick , Corey Parker Robinson , Robert F. Chew , Delaney Williams and <unk> Berger . 
 = = = Crew = = = 
 Alongside Simon , the show 's creator , head writer , showrunner and executive producer , much of the creative team behind The Wire were alumni of Homicide and Emmy @-@ winning miniseries The Corner . The Corner veteran , Robert F. Colesberry , was executive producer for the first two seasons and directed the season 2 finale before dying from complications from heart surgery in 2004 . He is credited by the rest of the creative team as having a large creative role for a producer , and Simon credits him for achieving the show 's realistic visual feel . He also had a small recurring role as Detective Ray Cole . Colesberry 's wife Karen L. Thorson joined him on the production staff . A third producer on The Corner , Nina Kostroff Noble also stayed with the production staff for The Wire rounding out the initial four @-@ person team . Following Colesberry 's death , she became the show 's second executive producer alongside Simon . 
 Stories for the show were often co @-@ written by Ed Burns , a former Baltimore homicide detective and public school teacher who had worked with Simon on other projects including The Corner . Burns also became a producer on The Wire in the show 's fourth season . Other writers for The Wire include three acclaimed crime fiction writers from outside of Baltimore : George Pelecanos from Washington , Richard Price from the Bronx and Dennis Lehane from Boston . Reviewers drew comparisons between Price 's works ( particularly <unk> ) and The Wire even before he joined . In addition to writing , Pelecanos served as a producer for the third season . Pelecanos has commented that he was attracted to the project because of the opportunity to work with Simon . Staff writer Rafael Alvarez penned several episodes ' scripts , as well as the series guidebook The Wire : Truth Be Told . Alvarez is a colleague of Simon 's from The Sun and a Baltimore native with working experience in the port area . Another city native and independent filmmaker , Joy Lusco , also wrote for the show in each of its first three seasons . Baltimore Sun writer and political journalist William F. Zorzi joined the writing staff in the third season and brought a wealth of experience to the show 's examination of Baltimore politics . 
 Playwright and television writer / producer Eric Overmyer joined the crew of The Wire in the show 's fourth season as a consulting producer and writer . He had also previously worked on Homicide . Overmyer was brought into the full @-@ time production staff to replace Pelecanos who scaled back his involvement to concentrate on his next book and worked on the fourth season solely as a writer . Emmy @-@ award winner , Homicide and The Corner writer and college friend of Simon David Mills also joined the writing staff in the fourth season . 
 Directors include Homicide alumnus Clark Johnson , who directed several acclaimed episodes of The Shield , and Tim Van Patten , an Emmy winner who has worked on every season of The Sopranos . The directing has been praised for its uncomplicated and subtle style . Following the death of Colesberry , director Joe Chappelle joined the production staff as a co @-@ executive producer and continued to regularly direct episodes . 
 = = = Episode structure = = = 
 When broadcast on HBO and on some international networks , the episodes are preceded by a recap of events that have a bearing upon the upcoming narrative , using clips from previous episodes . Each episode begins with a cold open that seldom contains a dramatic juncture . The screen then fades or cuts to black while the intro music fades in . The show 's opening title sequence then plays ; a series of shots , mainly close @-@ ups , concerning the show 's subject matter that changes from season to season , separated by fast cutting ( a technique rarely used in the show itself ) . The opening credits are superimposed on the sequence , and consist only of actors ' names without identifying which actors play which roles . In addition , actors ' faces are rarely seen in the title sequence . At the end of the sequence , a quotation is shown on @-@ screen that is spoken by a character during the episode . The three exceptions were the first season finale which uses the phrase " All in the game " , attributed to " Traditional West Baltimore " , a phrase used frequently throughout all five seasons including that episode ; the fourth season finale which uses words written on boarded up vacant homes attributed to " Baltimore , traditional " and the series finale , which started with a quote from H. L. Mencken that is shown on a wall at The Baltimore Sun in one scene , neither quote being spoken by a character . Progressive story arcs often unfold in different locations at the same time . Episodes rarely end with a cliffhanger , and close with a fade or cut to black with the closing music fading in . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Rather than overlaying songs on the soundtrack , or employing a score , The Wire primarily uses pieces of music that emanate from a source within the scene , such as a jukebox or car radio . This kind of music is known as diegetic or source cue . This practice is rarely breached , notably for the end @-@ of @-@ season montages and occasionally with a brief overlap of the closing theme and the final shot . 
 The opening theme is " Way Down in the Hole , " a gospel @-@ and @-@ blues @-@ inspired song , written by Tom Waits for his 1987 album Franks Wild Years . Each season uses a different recording and a different opening sequence , with the theme being performed by The Blind Boys of Alabama , Waits , The Neville Brothers , <unk> and Steve Earle . The season four version of " Way Down in the Hole " was arranged and recorded for the show and is performed by five Baltimore teenagers : Ivan Ashford , Markel Steele , Cameron Brown , Tariq Al @-@ Sabir and Avery <unk> . Earle , who performed the fifth season version , is also a member of the cast , playing the recovering drug addict Walon . The closing theme is " The Fall , " composed by Blake <unk> , who is also the music supervisor of the show . 
 During season finales , a song is played before the closing scene in a montage showing the lives of the protagonists in the aftermath of the narrative . The first season montage is played over " Step by Step " by Jesse Winchester , the second " I Feel Alright " by Steve Earle , the third " Fast Train " written by Van Morrison and performed by Solomon Burke , the fourth " I Walk on Gilded Splinters " written by Dr. John and performed by Paul Weller and the fifth uses an extended version of " Way Down In The Hole " by the Blind Boys of Alabama , the same version of the song used as the opening theme for the first season . While the songs reflect the mood of the sequence , their lyrics are usually only loosely tied to the visual shots . In the commentary track to episode 37 , " Mission Accomplished " , executive producer David Simon said : " I hate it when somebody purposely tries to have the lyrics match the visual . It <unk> the visual in a way to have the lyrics dead on point . ... Yet at the same time it can 't be totally off point . It has to glance at what you 're trying to say . " 
 Music by the Celtic punk band The Pogues is used throughout the series . The band 's song " The Body of an American , " which is always played at detectives ' wakes at Kavanaugh 's Bar , occurs in three episodes . In the episode " Dead Soldiers , " the song " Sally <unk> " can be heard when Bunk and McNulty are drinking on the street outside Kavanaugh 's Bar . The song " Transmetropolitan " is heard in the opening sequence of the episode " Duck and Cover " during season two , where McNulty crashes his car while drunk . 
 Two soundtrack albums , called The Wire : And All the Pieces Matter â Five Years of Music from The Wire and Beyond Hamsterdam , were released on January 8 , 2008 on Nonesuch Records . The former features music from all five seasons of the series and the latter includes local Baltimore artists exclusively . 
 = = Style = = 
 = = = Realism = = = 
 The writers strove to create a realistic vision of an American city based on their own experiences . Simon , originally a journalist for the Baltimore Sun , spent a year researching a homicide police department for his book , Homicide : A Year on the Killing Streets , where he met Burns . Burns served in the Baltimore Police Department for 20 years , and later became a teacher in an inner @-@ city school . The two of them spent a year researching the drug culture and poverty in Baltimore for their book , The Corner : A Year in the Life of an Inner @-@ City Neighborhood . Their combined experiences were used in many of the storylines of The Wire . 
 Central to the show 's aim for realism was the creation of truthful characters . Simon has stated that most of them are composites of real @-@ life Baltimore figures . For instance , Donnie Andrews served as the main inspiration of Omar Little . Martin O 'Malley served as " one of the inspirations " for Tommy Carcetti . The show often cast non @-@ professional actors in minor roles , distinguishing itself from other television series by showing the " faces and voices of the real city " it depicts . The writing also uses contemporary slang to enhance the immersive viewing experience . 
 In distinguishing the police characters from other television detectives , Simon makes the point that even the best police of The Wire are motivated not by a desire to protect and serve , but by the intellectual vanity of believing they are smarter than the criminals they are chasing . However , while many of the police do exhibit altruistic qualities , many officers portrayed on the show are incompetent , brutal , self @-@ aggrandizing , or hamstrung by bureaucracy and politics . The criminals are not always motivated by profit or a desire to harm others ; many are trapped in their existence and all have human qualities . Even so , The Wire does not minimize or gloss over the horrific effects of their actions . 
 The show is realistic in depicting the processes of both police work and criminal activity . There have even been reports of real @-@ life criminals watching the show to learn how to counter police investigation techniques . The fifth season portrayed a working newsroom at the Baltimore Sun and has been hailed as the most realistic portrayal of the media in film and television . 
 In December 2006 , The Washington Post carried an article in which local African @-@ American students stated that the show had " hit a nerve " with the black community , and that they themselves knew real @-@ life counterparts of many of the characters . The article expressed great sadness at the toll drugs and violence are taking on the black community . 
 = = = Visual novel = = = 
 Many important events occur off @-@ camera and there is no artificial exposition in the form of voice @-@ over or flashbacks , with the exceptions of two flashbacks â one at the end of the pilot episode that replays a moment from earlier in the same episode and one at the end of the fourth season finale that shows a short clip of a character tutoring his younger brother earlier in the season . Thus , the viewer needs to follow every conversation closely to understand the ongoing story arc and the relevance of each character to it . Salon.com has described the show as novelistic in structure , with a greater depth of writing and plotting than other crime shows . Each season of The Wire consists of 10 â 13 full @-@ hour episodes , which form several multi @-@ layered narratives . Simon chose this structure with an eye towards long story arcs that draw a viewer in , which then results in a more satisfying payoff . He uses the metaphor of a visual novel in several interviews , describing each episode as a chapter , and has also commented that this allows a fuller exploration of the show 's themes in time not spent on plot development . 
 = = = Social commentary = = = 
 Simon described the second season as " a meditation on the death of work and the betrayal of the American working class ... it is a deliberate argument that unencumbered capitalism is not a substitute for social policy ; that on its own , without a social compact , raw capitalism is destined to serve the few at the expense of the many . " He added that season 3 " reflects on the nature of reform and reformers , and whether there is any possibility that political processes , long calcified , can mitigate against the forces currently arrayed against individuals . " The third season is also an allegory that draws explicit parallels between the Iraq War and drug prohibition , which in Simon 's view has failed in its aims and has become a war against America 's underclass . This is portrayed by Major Colvin , imparting to Carver his view that policing has been allowed to become a war and thus will never succeed in its aims . 
 Writer Ed Burns , who worked as a public school teacher after retiring from the Baltimore police force shortly before going to work with Simon , has called education the theme of the fourth season . Rather than focusing solely on the school system , the fourth season looks at schools as a porous part of the community that are affected by problems outside of their boundaries . Burns states that education comes from many sources other than schools and that children can be educated by other means , including contact with the drug dealers they work for . Burns and Simon see the theme as an opportunity to explore how individuals end up like the show 's criminal characters , and to dramatize the notion that hard work is not always justly rewarded . 
 = = Themes = = 
 = = = Institutional dysfunction = = = 
 Simon has identified the organizations featured in the show â the Baltimore Police Department , City Hall , the Baltimore public school system , the Barksdale drug trafficking operation , The Baltimore Sun , and the stevedores ' union â as comparable institutions . All are dysfunctional in some way , and the characters are typically betrayed by the institutions that they accept in their lives . There is also a sentiment echoed by a detective in Narcotics â " Shit rolls downhill " â which describes how superiors , especially in the higher tiers of the police department in the series , will attempt to use subordinates as scapegoats for any major scandals . Simon described the show as " cynical about institutions " while taking a humanistic approach toward its characters . A central theme developed throughout the show is the struggle between individual desires and subordination to the group 's goals . Whether it is Officer Jimmy McNulty using all his cards to pursue a high @-@ profile case despite resistance from his own department , or gang member D 'Angelo Barksdale accepting a 20 @-@ year prison sentence contrary to his strong desire to turn in his uncle Avon and walk , this type of conflict is pervasive in all aspects of the show . 
 = = = Surveillance = = = 
 Central to the structure and plot of the show is the use of electronic surveillance and wiretap technologies by the police â hence the title The Wire . Salon.com described the title as a metaphor for the viewer 's experience : the wiretaps provide the police with access to a secret world , just as the show does for the viewer . Simon has discussed the use of camera shots of surveillance equipment , or shots that appear to be taken from the equipment itself , to emphasize the volume of surveillance in modern life and the characters ' need to sift through this information . 
 = = Cast and characters = = 
 The Wire employs a broad ensemble cast , supplemented by many recurring guest stars who populate the institutions featured in the show . The majority of the cast is black , which accurately reflects the demographics of Baltimore . 
 The show 's creators are also willing to kill off major characters , so that viewers cannot assume that a given character will survive simply because of a starring role or popularity among fans . In response to a question on why a certain character had to die , David Simon said , 
 We are not selling hope , or audience gratification , or cheap victories with this show . The Wire is making an argument about what institutions â bureaucracies , criminal enterprises , the cultures of addiction , raw capitalism even â do to individuals . It is not designed purely as an entertainment . It is , I 'm afraid , a somewhat angry show . 
 = = = Main cast = = = 
 The major characters of the first season were divided between those on the side of the law and those involved in drug @-@ related crime . The investigating detail was launched by the actions of Detective Jimmy McNulty ( Dominic West ) , whose insubordinate tendencies and personal problems played counterpoint to his ability as a criminal investigator . The detail was led by Lieutenant Cedric Daniels ( Lance Reddick ) who faced challenges balancing his career aspirations with his desire to produce a good case . Kima Greggs ( Sonja Sohn ) was a capable lead detective who faced jealousy from colleagues and worry about the dangers of her job from her domestic partner . Her investigative work was greatly helped by her confidential informant , a drug addict known as Bubbles ( Andre Royo ) . Like Greggs , partners Thomas " Herc " Hauk ( <unk> Lombardozzi ) and Ellis Carver ( Seth Gilliam ) were reassigned to the detail from the narcotics unit . The duo 's initially violent nature was eventually subdued as they proved useful in grunt work , and sometimes served as comic relief for the audience . Rounding out the temporary unit were detectives Lester Freamon ( Clarke Peters ) and Roland " Prez " <unk> ( Jim True @-@ Frost ) . Though not initially important players in the operation , Freamon proved a quietly capable and methodical investigator with a knack for noticing tiny but important details , and Prez turned out to be a natural at following paper trails and his persistence when dealing with seemingly unbreakable codes paid off eventually . 
 These investigators were overseen by two commanding officers more concerned with politics and their own careers than the case , Deputy Commissioner Ervin Burrell ( Frankie Faison ) and Major William Rawls ( John Doman ) . Assistant state 's attorney Rhonda Pearlman ( Deirdre Lovejoy ) acted as the legal liaison between the detail and the courthouse and also had a sexual relationship with McNulty . In the homicide division , Bunk Moreland ( Wendell Pierce ) was a gifted , dry @-@ witted , hard @-@ drinking detective partnered with McNulty under Sergeant Jay Landsman ( Delaney Williams ) , the sarcastic , sharp @-@ tongued squad supervisor . Peter Gerety had a recurring role as Judge Phelan , the official who started the case moving . 
 On the other side of the investigation was Avon Barksdale 's drug empire . The driven , ruthless Barksdale ( Wood Harris ) was aided by business @-@ minded Stringer Bell ( Idris Elba ) . Avon 's nephew D 'Angelo Barksdale ( Larry Gilliard , Jr . ) ran some of his uncle 's territory , but also possessed a guilty conscience , while loyal Wee @-@ Bey Brice ( Hassan Johnson ) was responsible for multiple homicides carried out on Avon 's orders . Working under D 'Angelo were Poot ( Tray Chaney ) , Bodie ( J.D. Williams ) , and Wallace ( Michael B. Jordan ) , all street @-@ level drug dealers . Wallace was an intelligent but naive youth trapped in the drug trade , and Poot a randy young man happy to follow rather than lead . Omar Little ( Michael K. Williams ) , a renowned Baltimore stick @-@ up man robbing drug dealers for a living , was a frequent thorn in the side of the Barksdale clan . 
 The second season introduced a new group of characters working in the Baltimore port area , including Spiros " Vondas " <unk> ( Paul Ben @-@ Victor ) , Beadie Russell ( Amy Ryan ) , and Frank Sobotka ( Chris Bauer ) . Vondas was the underboss of a global smuggling operation , Russell an inexperienced port authority officer and single mother thrown in at the deep end of a multiple homicide investigation , and Frank Sobotka a union leader who turned to crime to raise funds to save his union . Also joining the show in season 2 were Nick Sobotka ( Pablo Schreiber ) , Frank 's nephew ; Ziggy Sobotka ( James <unk> ) , Frank 's troubled son ; and " The Greek " ( Bill Raymond ) , Vondas 's mysterious boss . As the second season ended , the focus shifted away from the ports , leaving the new characters behind . 
 The third season saw several previously recurring characters assuming larger starring roles , including Detective Leander Sydnor ( Corey Parker Robinson ) , Bodie ( J.D. Williams ) , Omar ( Michael K. Williams ) , Proposition Joe ( Robert F. Chew ) , and Major Howard " Bunny " Colvin ( Robert Wisdom ) . Colvin commanded the Western district where the Barksdale organization operated , and nearing retirement , he came up with a radical new method of dealing with the drug problem . Proposition Joe , the East Side 's cautious drug kingpin , became more cooperative with the Barksdale Organization . Sydnor , a rising young star in the police department in season 1 , returned to the cast as part of the major crimes unit . Bodie had been seen gradually rising in the Barksdale organization since the first episode ; he was born to their trade and showed a fierce aptitude for it . Omar had a vendetta against the Barksdale organization and gave them all of his lethal attention . 
 New additions in the third season included Tommy Carcetti ( Aidan Gillen ) , an ambitious city councilman ; Mayor Clarence Royce ( Glynn Turman ) , the incumbent whom Carcetti planned to unseat ; Marlo Stanfield ( Jamie Hector ) , leader of an upstart gang seeking to challenge Avon 's dominance ; and Dennis " Cutty " Wise ( Chad Coleman ) , a newly released convict uncertain of his future . 
 In the fourth season , four young actors joined the cast : Jermaine Crawford as <unk> " Dukie " Weems ; Maestro Harrell as Randy Wagstaff ; Julito McCullum as Namond Brice ; and Tristan Wilds as Michael Lee . The characters are friends from a West Baltimore middle school . Another newcomer was Norman Wilson ( Reg E. Cathey ) , Carcetti 's deputy campaign manager . 
 The fifth season saw several actors join the starring cast . <unk> <unk> returns as the previously recurring Chris Partlow , chief enforcer of the now dominant Stanfield Organization . Neal Huff reprises his role as Mayoral chief of staff Michael <unk> having previously appeared as a guest star at the end of the fourth season . Two other actors also join the starring cast having previously portrayed their corrupt characters as guest stars â Michael Kostroff as defense attorney Maurice Levy and Isiah Whitlock , Jr. as senator Clay Davis . Crew member Clark Johnson appeared in front of the camera for the first time in the series to play Augustus Haynes , the principled editor of the city desk of The Baltimore Sun . He is joined in the newsroom by two other new stars ; Michelle <unk> and Tom McCarthy play young reporters Alma Gutierrez and Scott Templeton . 
 = = Plot = = 
 = = = Season 1 = = = 
 The first season introduces two major groups of characters : the Baltimore police department and a drug dealing organization run by the Barksdale family . The season follows the police investigation of the latter over its 13 episodes . 
 The investigation is triggered when detective Jimmy McNulty meets privately with judge Daniel Phelan following the acquittal of D 'Angelo Barksdale for murder after a key witness changes her story . McNulty tells Phelan that the witness has probably been intimidated by members of a drug trafficking empire run by D 'Angelo 's uncle , Avon Barksdale , having recognized several faces at the trial , most notably Avon 's second @-@ in @-@ command , Stringer Bell . He also tells Phelan that no one is investigating Barksdale 's criminal activity , which includes a significant portion of the city 's drug trade and several unsolved homicides . 
 Phelan takes issue with McNulty 's report and complains to senior Police Department figures , embarrassing them into creating a detail dedicated to investigating Barksdale . However , owing to the department 's dysfunction , the investigation is intended as a faÃ§ade to appease the judge . An <unk> struggle between the more motivated officers on the detail and their superiors spans the whole season , with interference by the higher @-@ ups often threatening to ruin the investigation . The detail 's commander , Cedric Daniels , acts as mediator between the two opposing groups of police . 
 Meanwhile , the organized and cautious Barksdale gang is explored through characters at various levels within it . The organization is continually antagonized by a stick @-@ up crew led by Omar Little , and the feud leads to several deaths . Throughout , D 'Angelo struggles with his conscience over his life of crime and the people it affects . 
 The police have little success with street @-@ level arrests or with securing informants beyond Bubbles , a well known West Side drug addict . Eventually the investigation takes the direction of electronic surveillance , with wiretaps and pager clones to infiltrate the security measures taken by the Barksdale organization . This leads the investigation to areas the commanding officers had hoped to avoid , including political contributions . When an associate of Avon Barksdale is arrested by State Police and offers to cooperate , the commanding officers order the detail to undertake a sting operation to wrap up the case . Detective Kima Greggs is seriously hurt in the operation , triggering an overzealous response from the rest of the department . This causes the detail 's targets to suspect that they are under investigation . 
 Wallace is murdered by his childhood friends Bodie and Poot , on orders from Stringer Bell , after leaving his " secure " placement with relatives and returning to Baltimore . D 'Angelo Barksdale is eventually arrested transporting a kilo of uncut heroin , and learning of Wallace 's murder , is ready to turn in his uncle and Stringer . However , D 'Angelo 's mother convinces him to rescind the deal and take the charges for his family . The detail manages to arrest Avon on a minor charge and gets one of his soldiers , Wee @-@ Bey , to confess to most of the murders , some of which he did not commit . Stringer escapes prosecution and is left running the Barksdale empire . For the officers , the consequences of antagonizing their superiors are severe , with Daniels passed over for promotion and McNulty assigned out of homicide and into the marine unit . 
 = = = Season 2 = = = 
 The second season , along with its ongoing examination of the drug problem and its effect on the urban poor , examines the plight of the blue @-@ collar urban working class as exemplified by stevedores in the city port , as some of them get caught up in smuggling drugs and other contraband inside the shipping containers that pass through their port . In a season @-@ long subplot , the Barksdale organization continues its drug trafficking despite Avon 's imprisonment , with Stringer Bell assuming greater power . 
 McNulty harbors a grudge against his former commanders for reassigning him to the marine unit . When thirteen unidentified young women are found dead in a container at the docks , McNulty successfully makes a spiteful effort to place the murders within the jurisdiction of his former commander . Meanwhile , police Major Stan Valchek gets into a feud with Polish @-@ American Frank Sobotka , a leader of the International Brotherhood of Stevedores , a fictional dockers ' union , over competing donations to their old neighborhood church . Valchek demands a detail to investigate Sobotka . Cedric Daniels is interviewed , having been praised by Prez , Major Valchek 's son @-@ in @-@ law , and also because of his work on the Barksdale case . He is eventually selected to lead the detail assigned just to investigate Sobotka ; when the investigation is concluded Daniels is assured he will move up to head a special case unit with personnel of his choosing . 
 Life for the blue @-@ collar men of the port is increasingly hard and work is scarce . As union leader , Sobotka has taken it on himself to reinvigorate the port by lobbying politicians to support much @-@ needed infrastructure improvement initiatives . Lacking the funds needed for this kind of influence , Sobotka has become involved with a smuggling ring . Around him , his son and nephew also turn to crime , as they have few other opportunities to earn money . It becomes clear to the Sobotka detail that the dead girls are related to their investigation , as they were in a container that was supposed to be smuggled through the port . They again use wiretaps to infiltrate the crime ring and slowly work their way up the chain towards The Greek , the mysterious man in charge . But Valchek , upset that their focus has moved beyond Sobotka , gets the FBI involved . The Greek has a mole inside the FBI and starts severing his ties to Baltimore when he learns about the investigation . 
 After a dispute over stolen goods turns violent , Sobotka 's son Ziggy is charged with the murder of one of the Greek 's underlings . Sobotka himself is arrested for smuggling ; he agrees to work with the detail to help his son , finally seeing his actions as a mistake . However , the Greek learns about this through his mole inside the FBI and has Sobotka killed . The investigation ends with the fourteen homicides solved but the perpetrator already dead . Several drug dealers and mid @-@ level smuggling figures tied to the Greek are arrested , but he and his second @-@ in @-@ command escape uncharged and unidentified . The Major is pleased that Sobotka was arrested ; the case is seen as a success by the commanding officers , but is viewed as a failure by the detail . 
 Across town , the Barksdale organization continues its business under Stringer while Avon and D 'Angelo Barksdale serve prison time . D 'Angelo decides to cut ties to his family after his uncle organizes the deaths of several inmates and blames it on a corrupt guard to shave time from his sentence . Eventually Stringer covertly orders D 'Angelo killed , with the murder staged to look like a suicide . Avon is unaware of Stringer 's duplicity and mourns the loss of his nephew . 
 Stringer also struggles , having been cut off by Avon 's drug suppliers and left with increasingly poor @-@ quality product . He again goes behind Avon 's back , giving up half of Avon 's most prized territory to a rival named Proposition Joe in exchange for a share of his supply . Avon , unaware of the arrangement , assumes that Joe and other dealers are moving into his territory simply because the Barksdale organization has too few enforcers . He contracts a feared assassin named Brother Mouzone . Stringer deals with this by tricking his old adversary Omar into believing that Mouzone was responsible for the vicious killing of his partner in their feud in season one . Seeking revenge , Omar shoots Mouzone but , realizing Stringer has lied to him , calls 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 . Mouzone recovers and leaves Baltimore , and Stringer ( now with Avon 's consent ) is able to continue his arrangement with Proposition Joe . 
 = = = Season 3 = = = 
 In the third season , the focus returns to the street and the Barksdale organization . The scope , however , is expanded to include the city 's political scene . A new subplot is introduced to explore the potential positive effects of de facto " legalizing " the illegal drug trade , and incidentally prostitution , within the limited boundaries of a few uninhabited city blocks â referred to as Hamsterdam . The posited benefits , as in Amsterdam and other European cities , are reduced street crime city @-@ wide and increased outreach of health and social services to at @-@ risk populations . These are continuations of storylines hinted at earlier . 
 The demolition of the residential towers that had served as the Barksdale organization 's prime territory pushes their dealers back out onto the streets of Baltimore . Stringer Bell continues his reform of the organization by cooperating with other drug lords , sharing with one another territory , product , and profits . Stringer 's proposal is met with a curt refusal from Marlo Stanfield , leader of a new , growing crew . Against Stringer 's advice , Avon decides to take Marlo 's territory by force , and the two gangs become embroiled in a bitter turf war with multiple deaths . Omar Little continues to rob the Barksdale organization wherever possible . Working with his new boyfriend , Dante , and two women , he is once more a serious problem . The violence related to the drug trade makes it an obvious choice of investigation for Cedric Daniels ' now @-@ permanent Major Crimes Unit . 
 Councilman Tommy Carcetti begins to prepare himself for a mayoral race . He manipulates a colleague into running against the mayor to split the black vote , secures a capable campaign manager and starts making headlines for himself . 
 As he approaches the end of his career , Major Howard " Bunny " Colvin of Baltimore 's Western District wants to effect some real change in the troubled neighborhoods for which he has long been responsible . Without the knowledge of central command , Colvin sets up areas where police would monitor , but not punish , the drug trade . The police crack down severely on violence in these areas , and also on drug trafficking elsewhere in the city . For many weeks , Colvin 's experiment works , and crime is reduced in his district . However , Colvin ' superiors , the media , and city politicians eventually find out about the arrangement , and the " Hamsterdam " experiment ends . With top brass outraged , Colvin is forced to cease his actions , accept a demotion , and retire from the police department on a lower @-@ grade pension . Tommy Carcetti uses the scandal to make a grandstanding speech at a weekly Baltimore city council meeting . 
 Dennis " Cutty " Wise , once a drug dealer 's enforcer , is released from prison alongside Avon . His struggles to adapt to life as a free man show an attempt at personal reform . Cutty tries to work as a manual laborer and then flirts with his former life , going to work for Avon . Finding he no longer has the heart for murder , he eventually uses funding from Avon to purchase new equipment for his nascent boxing gym . 
 The Major Crimes Unit learns that Stringer has been buying real estate and developing it to fulfill his dream of being a successful legitimate businessman . Believing that the bloody turf war with Marlo is poised to destroy everything the Barksdale crew had worked for , Stringer gives Major Colvin information on Avon 's weapons stash . But Stringer is himself being betrayed by Avon : Brother Mouzone had returned to Baltimore and tracked down Omar to join forces . Mouzone tells Avon that his shooting must be avenged . Avon , remembering how Stringer disregarded his order which resulted in Stringer attempting to have Brother Mouzone killed , possibly still furious over D 'Angelo 's murder ( Stringer having finally confessed the truth ) , and fearing Mouzone 's ability to harm his reputation outside of Baltimore , informs Mouzone of Stringer 's upcoming visit to his construction site . There , Mouzone and Omar corner him and shoot him to death . 
 Colvin tells McNulty about Avon 's hideout , and armed with the information gleaned from selling the Barksdale crew pre @-@ wiretapped disposable cell phones , the detail stages a raid , arresting Avon and most of his underlings . Barksdale 's criminal empire lies in ruins , and Marlo 's young crew simply moves into their territory . The drug trade in West Baltimore continues with little change . 
 = = = Season 4 = = = 
 The fourth season expanded its scope again to include an examination of the school system . Other major plots include the mayoral race that continues the political storyline begun in season three , and a closer look at Marlo Stanfield 's drug gang , which has grown to control most of western Baltimore 's trafficking . 
 The show introduces Dukie , Randy , Michael , and Namond , four boys from West Baltimore , as they enter the eighth grade . At the same school , Prez has begun a new career as a math teacher . Despite mentorship from the more seasoned faculty , Namond , and later Michael , work as drug runners for Bodie , who has had middling success selling Proposition Joe 's product independently . 
 The cold @-@ blooded Marlo has come to dominate the streets of the west side , using murder and intimidation to make up for his weak @-@ quality drugs and lack of business acumen . His enforcers Chris Partlow and Snoop conceal their numerous victims in abandoned and boarded @-@ up row houses where the bodies will not be readily discovered . The disappearances of so many known criminals come to <unk> both the major crimes unit investigating Marlo and the homicide unit assigned to solve the presumed murders . Marlo coerces Bodie into working under him . 
 McNulty has found peace working as a patrolman and living with Beadie Russell , and refuses promotions from Daniels , now a major commanding the Western District . Detectives Kima Greggs and Lester Freamon , as part of the major crimes unit , investigate Avon Barksdale 's political donations and serve several key figures with subpoenas . Their work is shut down by Commissioner Ervin Burrell at Mayor Clarence Royce 's request , and after being placed under stricter supervision within their unit , both Greggs and Freamon request and receive transfer to the homicide division . 
 Meanwhile , the city 's mayoral primary race enters its closing weeks . Royce initially has a seemingly insurmountable lead over challengers Tommy Carcetti and Tony Gray , with a big war chest and major endorsements .

 The fifth season focuses on the media and media consumption . The show features a fictional depiction of the newspaper The Baltimore Sun , and in fact elements of the plot are ripped @-@ from @-@ the @-@ headlines events ( such as the Jayson Blair New York Times scandal ) and people at the Sun . The season , according to David Simon , deals with " what stories get told and what don 't and why it is that things stay the same . " Issues such as the quest for profit , the decrease in the number of reporters , and the end of aspiration for news quality would all be addressed , alongside the theme of homelessness . John Carroll of The Baltimore Sun was the model for the " craven , prize hungry " editor of the fictional newspaper . 
 Fifteen months after the fourth season concludes , Mayor Carcetti 's cuts in the police budget to redress the education deficit force the Marlo Stanfield investigation to shut down . Cedric Daniels secures a detail to focus on the prosecution of Senator Davis for corruption . Detective McNulty returns to the Homicide unit and decides to divert resources back to the police department by faking evidence to make it appear that a serial killer is murdering homeless men .

 Baltimore Sun reporter Scott Templeton claims to have been contacted by McNulty 's fake serial killer . City Editor Gus Haynes becomes suspicious , but his superiors are enamored of Templeton . The story gains momentum and Carcetti spins the resulting attention on homelessness into a key issue in his imminent campaign for Governor and restores funding to the police department . 
 Bubbles is recovering from his drug addiction while living in his sister 's basement . He is befriended by Sun reporter Mike Fletcher , who eventually writes a profile of Bubbles . 
 Bunk is disgusted with McNulty 's serial killer scheme and tries to have Lester Freamon reason with McNulty . Instead , Freamon helps McNulty perpetuate the lie and uses resources earmarked for the case to fund an illegal wiretap on Stanfield . Bunk resumes working the vacant house murders , leading to a murder warrant against Partlow for killing Michael 's stepfather . 
 Freamon and Leander Sydnor gather enough evidence to arrest Stanfield and most of his top lieutenants , seizing a large quantity of drugs . Stanfield suspects that Michael is an informant , and orders him killed . Michael realizes he is being set up and kills Snoop instead . A wanted man , he leaves Bug with an aunt and begins a career as a stick @-@ up man . With his support system gone , Dukie lives with drug addicts . 
 McNulty tells Kima Greggs about his fabrications to prevent her wasting time on the case . Greggs tells Daniels , who , along with Rhonda Pearlman , takes this news to Carcetti , who orders a cover @-@ up because of the issue 's importance to his campaign . 
 Davis is acquitted , but Freamon uses the threat of federal prosecution to blackmail him for information . Davis reveals Maurice Levy has a mole in the courthouse from whom he illegally purchases copies of sealed indictments . Herc tells Levy that the Stanfield case was probably based on an illegal wiretap , something which would jeopardize the entire case . After Levy reveals this to Pearlman , she uses Levy 's espionage to blackmail him into agreeing to a plea bargain for his defendants . Levy ensures Stanfield 's release on the condition that he permanently retires , while his subordinates will have to accept long sentences . Stanfield sells the connection to The Greeks back to the Co @-@ Op and plans to become a businessman , although he appears unable or unwilling to stay off the corner . 
 As the cover @-@ up begins , a copy @-@ cat killing occurs , but McNulty quickly identifies and arrests the culprit . Pearlman tells McNulty and Freamon that they can no longer be allowed to do investigative work and warns of criminal charges if the scandal becomes public . They opt to retire . Haynes attempts to expose Templeton but the managing editors ignore the fabrications and demote anyone critical of their star reporter . Carcetti pressures Daniels to falsify crime statistics to aid his campaign . Daniels refuses and then quietly resigns rather than have his FBI file leaked . 
 In a final montage , McNulty gazes over the city ; Freamon enjoys retirement ; Templeton wins a Pulitzer ; Carcetti becomes Governor ; Haynes is sidelined to the copy desk and replaced by Fletcher ; Campbell appoints Valchek as commissioner ; Carcetti appoints Rawls as Superintendent of the Maryland State Police ; Dukie continues to use heroin ; Michael becomes a <unk> boy ; Pearlman becomes a judge and Daniels a defense attorney ; Bubbles is allowed upstairs where he enjoys a family dinner ; Chris serves his life sentence alongside Wee @-@ Bey ; the drug trade continues ; and the people of Baltimore go on with their lives .

 = = = Critical response = = = 
 All seasons of The Wire have received positive reviews from many major television critics , several naming it the best contemporary show and one of the best drama series of all time . The first season received mainly positive reviews from critics , some even calling it superior to HBO 's better @-@ known " flagship " drama series such as The Sopranos and Six Feet Under . On the review aggregation website Metacritic , the first season scored 78 out of 100 based on 22 reviews . One reviewer pointed to the retread of some themes from HBO and David Simon 's earlier works , but still found it valuable viewing and particularly resonant because it parallels the war on terror through the chronicling of the war on drugs . Another review postulated that the series might suffer because of its reliance on profanity and slowly drawn @-@ out plot , but was largely positive about the show 's characters and intrigue . 
 Despite the critical acclaim , The Wire received poor Nielsen ratings , which Simon attributed to the complexity of the plot ; a poor time slot ; heavy use of esoteric slang , particularly among the gangster characters ; and a predominantly black cast . Critics felt the show was testing the attention span of its audience and that it was mistimed in the wake of the launch of the successful crime drama The Shield on FX . However , anticipation for a release of the first season on DVD was high at Entertainment Weekly . 
 After the first two shows of season two , Jim Shelley ( a British TV critic writing for The Guardian ) called The Wire the best show on TV , praising the second season for its ability to detach from its former foundations in the first season . Jon <unk> with the Boston Phoenix was of the opinion that the subculture of the docks ( second season ) was not as absorbing as that of the housing projects ( first season ) , but he went on to praise the writers for creating a realistic world and populating it with an array of interesting characters . 
 The critical response to the third season remained positive . Entertainment Weekly named The Wire the best show of 2004 , describing it as " the smartest , deepest and most resonant drama on TV . " They credited the complexity of the show for its poor ratings . The Baltimore City Paper was so concerned that the show might be cancelled that it published a list of ten reasons to keep it on the air , including strong characterization , Omar Little , and an unabashedly honest representation of real world problems . It also worried that the loss of the show would have a negative impact on Baltimore 's economy . 
 At the close of the third season , The Wire was still struggling to maintain its ratings and the show faced possible cancellation . Creator David Simon blamed the show 's low ratings in part on its competition against Desperate Housewives and worried that expectations for HBO dramas had changed following the success of The Sopranos . 
 As the fourth season was about to begin , almost two years after the previous season 's end , Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that The Wire " has tackled the drug war in this country as it simultaneously explores race , poverty and ' the death of the American working class , ' the failure of political systems to help the people they serve , and the tyranny of lost hope . Few series in the history of television have explored the plight of inner @-@ city African Americans and none â not one â has done it as well . " Brian Lowry of Variety wrote at the time , " When television history is written , little else will rival ' The Wire . ' " The New York Times called the fourth season of The Wire " its best season yet . " Doug Elfman of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times was more reserved in his praise , calling it the " most ambitious " show on television , but faulting it for its complexity and the slow development of the plotline . The Los Angeles Times took the rare step of devoting an editorial to the show , stating that " even in what is generally acknowledged to be something of a golden era for thoughtful and entertaining dramas â both on cable channels and on network TV â The Wire stands out . " TIME magazine especially praised the fourth season , stating that " no other TV show has ever loved a city so well , damned it so passionately , or sung it so searingly . " The website Metacritic , which gathers reviews from news sources and translates them into a percentage score , assigned The Wire 's fourth season a weighted average score of 98 % , the second highest score for any television season in Metacritic history ( with the fifth season of Breaking Bad being the first ) . 
 Several reviewers have called it the best show on television , including TIME , Entertainment Weekly , the Chicago Tribune , Slate , the San Francisco Chronicle , the Philadelphia Daily News and the British newspaper The Guardian , which ran a week @-@ by @-@ week blog following every episode , also collected in a book , The Wire Re @-@ up . Charlie Brooker , a columnist for The Guardian , has been particularly enthusiastic in his praise of the show , both in his " Screen Burn " column and in his BBC Four television series Screenwipe , calling it possibly the greatest show of the last 20 years . In 2007 , TIME listed it among the one hundred best television series of all @-@ time . In 2013 , the Writers Guild of America ranked The Wire as the ninth best written TV series . In 2013 , TV Guide ranked The Wire as the sixth greatest show of all time . In 2013 , Entertainment Weekly listed the show at # 6 in their list of the " 26 Best Cult TV Shows Ever , " describing it as " one of the most highly praised series in HBO history " and praising Michael K. Williams 's acting as Omar Little . Entertainment Weekly also named it the number one TV show of all @-@ time in a special issue in 2013 . 
 Critics have often described the show in literary terms : the New York Times calls it " literary television ; " TV Guide calls it " TV as great modern literature ; " the San Francisco Chronicle says the series " must be considered alongside the best literature and filmmaking in the modern era ; " and the Chicago Tribune says the show delivers " rewards not unlike those won by readers who conquer Joyce , Faulkner or Henry James . " ' The Wire Files ' , an online collection of articles published in <unk> Journal , critically analyzes The Wire 's racialized politics and aesthetics of representation . Entertainment Weekly put it on its end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ decade , " best @-@ of " list , saying , " The deft writing â which used the cop @-@ genre format to give shape to creator David Simon 's scathing social critiques â was matched by one of the deepest benches of acting talent in TV history . " 
 President of the United States Barack Obama has said that The Wire is his favorite television series . The 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature Laureate , Mario Vargas Llosa , wrote a very positive critical review of the series in the Spanish journal El PaÃ­s . The comedian turned mayor of ReykjavÃ­k , Iceland , JÃ³n Gnarr , has gone so far as to say that he would not enter a coalition government with anyone who has not watched the series . 
 Robert Kirkman , creator of The Walking Dead , is a strong follower of The Wire ; he has tried to cast as many actors from it into the television series of the same name as possible , so far having cast Chad Coleman , Lawrence Gilliard , Jr . , and Seth Gilliam . 
 = = = Awards = = = 
 The Wire was nominated for , and won a wide variety of awards , including nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series for " Middle Ground " and " â 30 â " , nominations for the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Drama Series in each of its five seasons ; and nominations for the Television Critics Association Awards ( TCA ) , and Writers Guild of America Awards ( WGA ) . 
 Most of the awards the series won were in seasons 4 and 5 . These included TCA 's Heritage Award for season 5 and WGA 's Award for Best Dramatic Series for season 4 , plus Crime Thriller , Eddie , Edgar , Directors Guild of America , and Irish Film and Television awards . The series also won ASCAP , Peabody and Artios awards for season 2 . 
 The series won the Broadcasting & Cable critics poll for Best Drama ( season 4 ) and won Time 's critics choice for top television show for seasons 1 and 3 . 
 Despite the above mentioned awards and unanimous critical approval , The Wire never won a Primetime Emmy Award nor received any major nominations . Several critics recognized its lack of recognition by the Emmys . According to a report by Variety , anonymous Emmy voters cited reasons such as the series ' dense and multilayered plot , the grim subject matter , and the series ' lack of connection with California , as it is set and filmed in Baltimore . 
 = = = Academia = = = 
 In the years following the end of the series ' run , several colleges and universities such as Johns Hopkins , Brown University , and Harvard College have offered classes on The Wire in disciplines ranging from law to sociology to film studies . Phillips Academy , a boarding high school in Massachusetts , offers a similar course as well . University of Texas at San Antonio offers a course where the series is taught as a work of literary fiction . In an article published in The Washington Post , Anmol <unk> and William Julius Wilson explain why Harvard chose The Wire as curriculum material for their course on urban inequality : " Though scholars know that deindustrialization , crime and prison , and the education system are deeply intertwined , they must often give focused attention to just one subject in relative isolation , at the expense of others . With the freedom of artistic expression , The Wire can be more creative . It can weave together the range of forces that shape the lives of the urban poor . " University of York 's Head of Sociology , Roger Burrows , said in The Independent that the show " makes a fantastic contribution to their understanding of contemporary urbanism " , and is " a contrast to dry , dull , hugely expensive studies that people carry out on the same issues " . The series is also studied as part of a Master seminar series at the Paris West University Nanterre La DÃ©fense . In February 2012 , Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Å½iÅ¾ek gave a lecture at Birkbeck , University of London titled The Wire or the clash of civilisations in one country . In April 2012 , Norwegian academic Erlend <unk> posted online a 36 @-@ minute video essay called " Style in The Wire " which analyzes the various visual techniques used by the show 's directors over the course of its five seasons . 
 The Wire has also been the subject of growing numbers of academic articles by , amongst others , Fredric Jameson ( who praised the series ' ability to weave utopian thinking into its realist representation of society ) ; and Leigh Claire La Berge , who argues that although the less realistic character of season five was received negatively by critics , it gives the series a platform not only for representing reality , but for representing how realism is itself a construct of social forces like the media ; both commentators see in The Wire an impulse for progressive political change rare in mass media productions . While most academics have used " The Wire " as a cultural object or case study , Benjamin Leclair @-@ Paquet has instead argued that the " creative methods behind HBO 's The Wire evoke original ways to experiment with speculative work that reveal the merit of the imaginary as a pragmatic research device . " This author posits that the methods behind The Wire is particularly relevant for contentious urban and architectural projects .

 = Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria = 
 Ivan Alexander ( Bulgarian : ÐÐ²Ð°Ð½ <unk> , transliterated Ivan <unk> ; pronounced [ <unk> <unk> ] ; original spelling : <unk> <unk> ) , also sometimes Anglicized as John Alexander , ruled as Emperor ( Tsar ) of Bulgaria from 1331 to 1371 , during the Second Bulgarian Empire . The date of his birth is unknown . He died on 17 February 1371 . The long reign of Ivan Alexander is considered a transitional period in Bulgarian medieval history . Ivan Alexander began his rule by dealing with internal problems and external threats from Bulgaria 's neighbours , the Byzantine Empire and Serbia , as well as leading his empire into a period of economic recovery and cultural and religious renaissance . 
 However , the emperor was later unable to cope with the mounting incursions of Ottoman forces , Hungarian invasions from the northwest and the Black Death . In an ill @-@ fated attempt to combat these problems , he divided the country between his two sons , thus forcing it to face the imminent Ottoman conquest weakened and divided . 
 = = Early rule = = 
 Ivan Alexander was the son of the despotÄs Sracimir of Kran by <unk> , a sister of Michael Asen III of Bulgaria . Therefore , Ivan Alexander was a nephew of Michael Asen III . <unk> , Ivan Alexander descended from the Asen dynasty . By 1330 Ivan Alexander was himself a despotÄs and governed the city of Lovech . Together with his father and his father @-@ in @-@ law Basarab of Wallachia , Ivan Alexander fought in the Battle of Velbazhd against the Serbs at modern @-@ day Kyustendil in 1330 , in which Bulgaria suffered defeat . The defeat , combined with the worsening relations with the Byzantine Empire , precipitated an internal crisis , which was exacerbated by an invasion of the Byzantines . A coup d 'Ã©tat drove Ivan Stefan out of the capital Tarnovo in 1331 , and the conspirators placed Ivan Alexander on the throne . 
 The new ruler set about consolidating his position by regaining territories recently lost to the Byzantine Empire . In 1331 Ivan Alexander campaigned around Adrianople and reconquered northeastern Thrace . Meanwhile , Stefan UroÅ¡ IV DuÅ¡an deposed his father Stefan UroÅ¡ III DeÄanski and became Serbian king in 1331 . This helped normalize the previously tense relations between the two countries . Ivan Alexander and Stefan UroÅ¡ IV DuÅ¡an concluded an alliance , which was cemented by the marriage of the Serbian king to Helena of Bulgaria , a sister of Ivan Alexander , on Easter 1332 . 
 At about the same time , Belaur , a brother of Michael Asen III , rebelled in Vidin , probably in support of his deposed nephew Ivan Stefan 's claim to the throne . The advance of the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos against Bulgaria in the summer of 1332 protracted military operations against the rebels . The Byzantines overran Bulgarian @-@ controlled northeastern Thrace , but Ivan Alexander rushed southward with a small army and swiftly caught up with Andronikos III at Rusokastro . 
 After giving the impression that he wished to negotiate , Ivan Alexander , reinforced by Mongol cavalry , overwhelmed the smaller but better organized Byzantine army in the Battle of Rusokastro . The contested cities surrendered to Ivan Alexander , while Andronikos III sought refuge within the walls of Rusokastro . The war ended with Ivan Alexander meeting Andronikos and agreeing a peace based on the status quo . To seal the alliance , he betrothed his eldest son , Michael Asen IV , to Andronikos 's daughter Maria ( Eirene ) , the marriage eventually taking place in 1339 . The Bulgarian emperor was now free to turn his attentions to Belaur , but it was not until 1336 or 1337 that the rebellion in the northwest was put down . 
 In about 1332 Ivan Alexander had crowned his eldest son Michael Asen IV co @-@ emperor , perhaps to safeguard possession of the throne by his own family . He followed up this traditional association with the coronation of his younger sons Ivan Sracimir and Ivan Asen IV in 1337 . Ivan Alexander may have intended the creation of two younger co @-@ emperors to establish immediate control over important cities and regions , as Ivan Sracimir was eventually based in Vidin , and Ivan Asen IV perhaps in Preslav . Nevertheless , this was a marked departure from Byzantine practice , in which younger sons of the sovereign were made despotÄs , whether they were charged with a territorial administration or not . 
 = = Relations with the Byzantine Empire = = 
 In the early 1340s relations with the Byzantine Empire temporarily deteriorated . Ivan Alexander demanded the extradition of his cousin Å iÅ¡man , one of the sons of Michael Asen III , threatening the Byzantine government with war . Ivan Alexander 's show of force backfired , as the Byzantines managed to see through his intentions and sent against him the fleet of their ally , the Turkish emir of Smyrna Umur Beg . Landing in the Danube Delta , they pillaged the countryside and attacked nearby Bulgarian cities . Forced to restrain his demands , Ivan Alexander invaded the Byzantine Empire again at the end of 1341 , claiming that he was summoned by the people of Adrianople . However , Ivan Alexander 's troops were defeated twice by Turkish allies of the Byzantines near the city . 
 In 1341 â 1347 the Byzantine Empire was plunged into a protracted civil war between the regency for Emperor John V Palaiologos under Anna of Savoy and his intended guardian John VI Kantakouzenos . The neighbours of the Byzantines took advantage of the civil war , and while Stefan UroÅ¡ IV DuÅ¡an of Serbia sided with John VI Kantakouzenos , Ivan Alexander backed John V Palaiologos and his regency . Although the two Balkan rulers picked opposite sides in the Byzantine civil war , they maintained their alliance with each other . As the price for Ivan Alexander 's support , the regency for John V Palaiologos ceded him the city of Philippopolis ( Plovdiv ) and nine important fortresses in the Rhodope Mountains in 1344 . This peaceful turnover constituted the last major success of Ivan Alexander 's foreign policy . 
 = = Rise of Serbia and the Ottoman threat = = 
 During the same period , the Serbian king took advantage of the Byzantine civil war to take possession of what is now Macedonia , and of most of Albania and northern Greece . In 1345 he began to call himself " Emperor of Serbs and Greeks " , and in 1346 he was crowned as such by the newly created Serbian Patriarch . These actions , which the Byzantines received with indignation , appear to have been supported by Bulgaria , as the Patriarch of Bulgaria Simeon had participated in both the creation of a Serbian Patriarchate and the imperial coronation of Stefan UroÅ¡ IV DuÅ¡an . 
 By the second half of the 1340s , little remained of Ivan Alexander 's initial successes . John VI Kantakouzenos ' Turkish allies pillaged parts of Bulgarian Thrace in 1346 , 1347 , 1349 , 1352 and 1354 , to which were added the ravages of the Black Death . The Bulgarians ' attempts to repel the invaders met with repeated failure , and Ivan Alexander 's third son and co @-@ emperor , Ivan Asen IV , was killed in battle against the Turks in 1349 , as was his older brother Michael Asen IV in 1355 or a little earlier . 
 By 1351 the Byzantine civil war was over , and John VI Kantakouzenos had realized the threat posed by the Ottomans to the Balkan Peninsula . He appealed to the rulers of Serbia and Bulgaria for a united effort against the Turks and asked Ivan Alexander for money to construct warships , but his appeals fell on deaf ears as his neighbours distrusted his intentions . A new attempt for cooperation between Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire followed in 1355 , after John VI Kantakouzenos had been forced to abdicate and John V Palaiologos had been established as supreme emperor . To cement the treaty , Ivan Alexander 's daughter <unk> Marija was married off to the future Byzantine Emperor Andronikos IV Palaiologos , but the alliance failed to produce concrete results . 
 = = Further stability problems and external conflicts = = 
 At home Ivan Alexander compromised the internal stability of his realm by divorcing his first wife Theodora of Wallachia ( in about 1349 ) and marrying a converted Jew , also named Theodora . The new marriage produced new sons , whom Ivan Alexander proceeded to crown co @-@ emperors , Ivan Å iÅ¡man in about 1356 and Ivan Asen V by 1359 . Ivan Alexander 's last surviving son from his first marriage , the co @-@ emperor Ivan Sracimir , became effectively independent around 1356 ; and Ivan Alexander 's control over other powerful vassals , such as the rulers of Wallachia and Dobruja , who pursued their own foreign policies , was hardly stronger . 
 From the middle of the 14th century , Bulgaria fell prey to the aspirations of the Angevin king Louis I of Hungary , who annexed Moldavia in 1352 and established a vassal principality there , before conquering Vidin in 1365 , and taking Ivan Sratsimir and his family into captivity . 
 In the meantime Bulgarians and Byzantines had clashed again in 1364 . In 1366 , when Emperor John V Palaiologos was returning from his trip to the west , the Bulgarians refused to let him pass through Bulgaria . This stance backfired , as another Byzantine ally , Count Amadeus VI of Savoy , leading the Savoyard crusade , captured several Bulgarian maritime cities in retaliation , including <unk> ( <unk> ) and Mesembria ( NesebÇr ) , though he failed to take Varna . Outmanoeuvred , Ivan Alexander was forced to make peace . 
 The captured cities were turned over to the Byzantine Empire , while Emperor John V Palaiologos paid the sum of 180 @,@ 000 florins to Ivan Alexander . The Bulgarian emperor used this sum and territorial concessions to induce his at least de jure vassals <unk> of Dobruja and Vladislav I of Wallachia to reconquer Vidin from the Hungarians . The war was successful , and Ivan Sracimir was reinstalled in Vidin in 1369 , although the Hungarian king forced him to acknowledge his overlordship . 
 The relatively successful resolution of the crisis in the northwest did nothing to help recover the losses in the southeast . To make matters worse , in 1369 ( the date is disputed ) , the Ottoman Turks under Murad I conquered Adrianople ( in 1363 ) and made it the effective capital of their expanding state . At the same time , they also captured the Bulgarian cities of Philippopolis and <unk> ( Stara Zagora ) . As Bulgaria and the Serbian princes in Macedonia prepared for united action against the Turks , Ivan Alexander died on February 17 , 1371 . He was succeeded by his sons Ivan Sracimir in Vidin and Ivan Å iÅ¡man in TÇrnovo , while the rulers of Dobruja and Wallachia achieved further independence . 
 = = Culture and religion = = 
 During Ivan Alexander 's rule , the Second Bulgarian Empire entered a period of cultural renaissance , which is sometimes referred to as the " Second Golden Age of Bulgarian culture " , the original one being the rule of Simeon the Great . A large number of Bulgarian monasteries and churches were constructed or renovated on the order of Ivan Alexander . Mural portraits of him as a donor can be seen in the Bachkovo Monastery 's ossuary and in the Rock @-@ hewn Churches of Ivanovo . Donor 's deeds of Ivan Alexander prove that the monasteries of the Holy Mother of God <unk> and St Nicholas in NesebÇr were reconstructed during that period , as was the St Nicholas monastery near Pernik , according to a Hilandar monastery deed . In addition , the tsar also initiated the construction of the <unk> and <unk> monasteries . 
 Literary activity also flourished during the reign of Ivan Alexander . Several important literary works were created in the period , such as the Middle Bulgarian translation of the Manasses Chronicle ( 1344 â 1345 ) , currently preserved in the Vatican Secret Archives in Rome , the richly illustrated Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander ( 1355 â 1356 ) , now exhibited in the British Library , the TomiÄ Psalter ( 1360 ) , today in Moscow , and the Sofia Psalter ( 1337 ) . 
 Ivan Alexander 's rule was also marked by efforts to strengthen the position of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church by pursuing heretics and Jews . He organized two anti @-@ heretical church councils , in 1350 and 1359 â 1360 , that condemned various sects such as the <unk> , the <unk> and the Judaizers . 
 The spiritual practice of hesychasm , a form of incantatory prayer , deeply influenced certain areas of the Eastern Orthodox world of the 14th century . A notable Bulgarian representative of the movement during Ivan Alexander 's reign was Theodosius of TÇrnovo . 
 During this time , the Bulgarian Empire had trade relations with the Mediterranean maritime powers Venice , Genoa and Ragusa . In 1353 , Ivan Alexander issued a charter allowing Venetian merchants to buy and sell goods throughout Bulgaria after Doge Andrea Dandolo assured him they would observe the prior treaties between the two countries . 
 In modern times , the rule of Ivan Alexander inspired Bulgarian national writer Ivan Vazov to write the novelette Ivan @-@ <unk> and the drama <unk> <unk> ( Towards an Abyss ) , in both of which the tsar is the main character . 
 A piece of a garment signed by Ivan Alexander and interwoven with gold was discovered in a noble 's grave near Pirot in the 1970s ; today it is preserved in the National Museum of Serbia in Belgrade . It is the first find of its kind , demonstrating a medieval tradition attested in writing according to which Orthodox rulers would present their most eminent dignitaries with a piece of a garment they had worn .

 = Marojejy National Park = 
 Marojejy National Park is a national park in the Sava Region of northeastern Madagascar . It covers 55 @,@ 500 ha ( 214 sq mi ) and is centered on the Marojejy Massif , a mountain chain that rises to an elevation of 2 @,@ 132 m ( 6 @,@ 995 ft ) . Access to the area around the massif was restricted to research scientists when the site was set aside as a strict nature reserve in 1952 . In 1998 , it was opened to the public when it was converted into a national park . It became part of the World Heritage Site known as the Rainforests of the Atsinanana in 2007 . Despite its rugged terrain , poaching and selective logging are still persistent problems , particularly since the start of the 2009 political crisis in Madagascar . Mining , slash @-@ and @-@ burn agriculture , and wood collection also pose threats to the park and its wildlife . 
 The wide range of elevations and rugged topography of the massif create diverse habitats that transition quickly with changes in altitude . Warm , dense rainforest can be found at lower elevations , followed by shorter forests at higher elevations , followed still by cloud forest , and topped near the peaks with the only remaining undisturbed mountain scrub in Madagascar . Better growing conditions for plants can be found on the eastern side of the mountains , which receives more rain than the western side . This habitat diversity lends itself to high levels of biodiversity . At least 118 species of bird , 148 species of reptile and amphibian , and 11 species of lemur are known to occur within Marojejy National Park . One of the lemurs , the silky sifaka ( Propithecus candidus ) is listed among " The World 's 25 Most Endangered Primates " . The helmet vanga ( <unk> <unk> ) is considered the iconic bird species of the park . 
 One path leads from the entrance of the park to the summit . There are three camps along the route : Camp Mantella at 450 m ( 1 @,@ 480 ft ) in elevation in lowland rainforest , Camp <unk> at 775 m ( 2 @,@ 543 ft ) at the transition between lowland and montane rain forest , and Camp Simpona at 1 @,@ 250 m ( 4 @,@ 100 ft ) in the middle of the montane rainforest . Camp Simpona acts as a base camp for the trek to the summit , a route that stretches 2 km ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) and can take up to four or five hours to traverse . 
 = = History = = 
 Marojejy National Park is located in the northeast of Madagascar between the towns of Andapa and Sambava and extends approximately 32 km ( 20 mi ) from east to west and 22 km ( 14 mi ) from north to south . It is centered on the chain of mountains known as Marojejy Massif . Despite a scientific survey of some of the other mountains in the region by the 1929 Mission Zoologique Franco @-@ Anglo @-@ AmÃ©ricaine , Marojejy was not surveyed until 1937 when <unk> <unk> of the Service GÃ©ographique de Madagascar ascended Marojejy Est . <unk> did not conduct any field research during his visit . The massif was not geologically described until after the French botanist Henri Jean Humbert from the National Museum of Natural History in Paris explored the mountains in 1948 . Humbert had previously explored numerous mountain ranges in continental Africa before going to Marojejy . Between November 1948 and November 1950 , he spent five months collecting 4 @,@ 039 dried plant ( herbarium ) specimens for study . After several expeditions , he published the book " A Marvel of Nature " in 1955 , in which he claimed the massif was the most impressive range in all of Madagascar because of its size , floral diversity , and pristine natural state . 
 Marojejy was set aside as one of Madagascar 's strict nature reserves in 1952 largely due to Humbert 's enthusiasm and support . Under this protection , only research scientists were permitted to visit the site . In 1998 , Marojejy was converted into a national park and thus became open to visitors . 
 Originally seen as a transitional zone between the eastern rainforests and the central highlands , Marojejy is now recognized as having its own unique features , with some of the richest biodiversity on the island . Several studies from the early 1970s through the 1990s surveyed the mountain ecosystems and inventoried the flora and fauna . In 2007 , Marojejy was listed as a World Heritage Site as part of the Rainforests of the Atsinanana . Due to illegal logging and trafficking of valuable hardwoods , and especially after the 2009 political crisis in Madagascar , the Rainforests of the Atsinanana was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger in 2010 . 
 = = = Park boundaries and size = = = 
 The boundaries of Marojejy National Park were originally established by approximation when the park was established in 1952 . With a second decree ( no . 66 @-@ 242 ) from the government of Madagascar in 1966 , the park 's status as a strict nature reserve was reaffirmed , and its boundaries were marked by 89 points . From these markers , the size of the park was estimated at 60 @,@ 150 ha ( 232 @.@ 2 sq mi ) . At the time , two families were living 450 m ( 1 @,@ 480 ft ) within the park boundaries , which initially was permitted under the conditions that they did not extend their cultivated land into the park or allow others to join them . The families were later expelled for violating these conditions . Many families from the local communities did not understand why such a large area so rich in resources and necessary for their survival was forbidden to them , and between the late 1980s and 1993 , they stopped honoring the status of the park . They began clearing the outer edges of the reserve to start plantations of vanilla and coffee . In 1993 , the World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) and the Service des Eaux et ForÃªts renewed conservation efforts in the area , evicted the people living inside the reserve , and renegotiated the borders with the local community , based on the 1966 decree . Trails and posts were then used to clearly mark the edges of the reserve . In the years following these events , many communities living near the borders of the park have become more involved in forest surveillance , and deforestation has fallen off sharply to only a few hectares a year . 
 In 1998 , the WWF requested that the government of Madagascar relax the restrictions on the reserve to allow for ecotourism , the revenue from which could benefit the people living in the periphery of the park . With a decree ( no . 98 @-@ 375 ) in May 1998 , the reserve became a national park . The boundaries were renegotiated , particularly in the western and northwestern regions of the park , and this time using clear natural landmarks , such as ridge crests , as markers . The size of the park was adjusted to 60 @,@ 050 ha ( 231 @.@ 9 sq mi ) , with some western communities gaining access to untouched forest zones while communities in the northwest lost agricultural land . Approximately 5 @,@ 000 ha ( 19 sq mi ) had been illegally cleared within the park and are still part of the park . There are now 91 boundary markers and the boundaries are <unk> . Intermediate boundary markers are placed between existing markers to demarcate the edges of the park during disputes with the local community . 
 During October 2005 , reports surfaced showing that boundary markers were being moved with the approval of park employees and that areas within the park were being cleared for agriculture . In January 2006 , the Park Logistics Coordinator was fired for moving boundary markers while employed as the Park Conservation Agent and selling the 9 ha ( 0 @.@ 035 sq mi ) of park land to a local farmer for 2 million Malagasy francs ( ~ US $ 200 ) . In 2010 , a new demarcation adjusted the size the park down to 55 @,@ 500 ha ( 214 sq mi ) . 
 = = Topography and habitat = = 
 Marojejy National Park covers 55 @,@ 500 ha ( 214 sq mi ) and protects almost the entire massif , which ranges in elevation from 75 to 2 @,@ 132 m ( 246 to 6 @,@ 995 ft ) at the summit . The massif is part of a mountain chain that stretches from Tsaratanana in the northwest to the Masoala Peninsula in the south . The crests of the massif form an east â west line with a series of distinct peaks along its irregular structure , which consists of parallel or divergent crest lines broken apart by steep and irregular slopes . Rising 2 @,@ 000 m ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) over as little as 8 km ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) , the Marojejy Massif has some of the most precipitous terrain in Madagascar . As a result of this sharp rise in elevation and rugged topography , it has a variety of microclimates and a visible change in habitat , making it one of the few places in the world where cloud @-@ covered rainforest rapidly transitions to high mountain shrubland over a distance that can be covered on foot . Also due to the rugged topography , the vegetative mosaic varies between the crests and slopes of the massif , even at the same elevations . For example , crests and adjoining slopes often have less than 20 % of their flowering plant species in common . 
 Temperatures in the region are fairly constant , with both the daily temperature range and the seasonal range varying only slightly . February is the hottest month , averaging 25 Â° C ( 77 Â° F ) , while August is the coolest , averaging 19 Â° C ( 66 Â° F ) . Climbing the peaks , temperature decreases by 1 Â° C per 200 m of increased altitude ( 1 Â° F per 360 ft ) , and temperatures on the summit decline to 1 @.@ 5 Â° C ( 34 @.@ 7 Â° F ) in July . The relative humidity for the region hovers around 87 % throughout most of the year , although it rises to 97 % between March and April . Rain falls every month on the southern side of the mountain , with the region receiving at least 2 @,@ 300 mm ( 91 in ) of rain annually , making it one of the wettest areas in Madagascar . The northern side of the mountain is more tropical , with a 6 @-@ month dry season , and receives about 1 @,@ 500 mm ( 59 in ) of rain per year . The general region receives the most rainfall during the warm season , from November through April , when heavy rain and occasional cyclones are delivered from the northwest by monsoons . During the cooler season , between May and October , lighter rains are delivered by winds from the southeast . 
 Both temperature and rainfall vary significantly by location within the park . Lower temperatures are found at higher elevations , and the eastern slopes of the massif receive the most of the rainfall , since the western slopes lie in the rain shadow of the mountain and consequently experience a prolonged dry period . The tops of the ridges experience strong winds and offer poor soil conditions . The effect can be seen in the plant life and their growth rates . The wide range in elevations and the rugged topography also play a crucial role in creation of the varied habitats distributed across the mountain slopes by affecting air temperature , fluctuations in temperature , and humidity levels . The interplay between these factors impacts the growth and development of plants , which form the foundation of the ecosystem . The result is an extremely varied and unevenly distributed forest that covers 90 % of the park . 
 The mountains of both Marojejy and nearby Anjanaharibe @-@ Sud Special Reserve feed several drainage basins , including the <unk> River , which is sourced from the western and southern slopes of Marojejy , and the <unk> River , which originates from the northern slopes of Marojejy . Both rivers travel towards Sambava and drain into the Indian Ocean . Marojejy is connected to the Anjanaharibe @-@ Sud Special Reserve by the Betaolana corridor , a narrow mid @-@ elevation strip of forest extending west and slightly south . 
 = = = Geology = = = 
 As with the rest of Madagascar , the rocks of Marojejy National Park were once part of the supercontinent of Gondwana , which began to break up 160 million years ago to form the southern continents . However , the bedrock of Marojejy formed over 500 million years ago during the Precambrian beneath an ancient mountain range that has since eroded away completely . The bedrock is composed mostly of granitic rocks , although it also contains a significant amount of gneiss , a high @-@ grade metamorphic rock that formed under high pressure and temperature deep beneath the ancient mountain range . In places where heat and pressure were highest , the rock melted completely and eventually recrystallized at depth as granite , an igneous rock . Later , veins of quartz formed in cracks in the bedrock ; these are the source of the quartz and amethyst crystals mined in the region today . In more recent geological times , the area 's abundant quartzite formed when quartz @-@ rich sands were deposited on the bedrock , and were then buried and recrystallized ( metamorphosed ) . The soil pH is expected to be acidic to neutral . 
 The highest , most rugged peaks of Marojejy owe their form to the gneiss from which they are made . The gneiss consists of alternating bands of light and dark colored minerals . The light minerals , consisting mostly of quartz and feldspar , are the hardest and most resistant , whereas the dark minerals , which are mostly biotite mica and hornblende , are softer and weather out faster . This layered composition , in combination with the north @-@ facing 45 @-@ degree angle at which the rocks are tilted , accounts for the asymmetric character of the peaks . The northern slopes dip moderately , while the southern faces are typically near @-@ vertical cliffs where the rocks fractured counter to the layered grain . The cliff named <unk> , with its sheer , south @-@ facing rock wall , is an example .

 Marojejy National Park is noted for its rich biodiversity , which can appeal to both scientist and ecotourist . There are a wide range of habitats within the park , and many of its plants and animals are endemic to the area . Scientific expeditions regularly discover species that are either not previously documented in Marojejy , or in some cases , completely new to science . Some new species are highly endangered . In the case of many large groups , such as invertebrates , very little is known and much remains to be discovered . 
 = = = Flora = = = 
 The vegetation of Marojejy National Park is extremely diverse due to the various microclimates . The microclimates also affect plant growth rates , with the wet eastern slopes showing faster plant growth , the dry western slopes exhibiting slower plant growth , and the plants on the ridge tops hindered by high winds and poor soils . More than 2 @,@ 000 species of flowering plants ( angiosperms ) have been discovered at the park so far . At least four plant families are found at all elevations : Clusiaceae and Poaceae are generally common , while <unk> and <unk> are rare . 
 There are four basic types of forest found at Marojejy : 
 Lowland rainforest : Below 800 m ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) , species diversity is the highest due to abundant rainfall , consistently warm weather , and protection from strong winds . The canopy of the primary forests is dense with tall trees reaching heights of 25 â 35 m ( 82 â 115 ft ) . Many tree trunks measure over 30 cm ( 12 in ) in diameter . A great variety of palms , epiphytes , and ferns are also present , with 130 species of fern known from this zone . Secondary growth , which primarily includes bamboo , wild ginger or <unk> ( genus <unk> ) , and traveller 's palm ( Ravenala madagascariensis ) , is found in disturbed areas . The most common families of flowering plant are <unk> , Rubiaceae , Euphorbiaceae , and <unk> . The most common families of plants in the light groundcover are Poaceae , <unk> , Acanthaceae , <unk> , Melastomataceae , and <unk> . The lowland rainforest region covers 38 % of the surface area of the park . 
 Moist montane rainforest : Between 800 and 1 @,@ 400 m ( 2 @,@ 600 and 4 @,@ 600 ft ) and also covering 38 % of the surface area of the park , trees and shrubs become increasingly smaller due to lower temperatures and poorer soils , and tree ferns become more abundant as elevation increases . The lower temperatures cause moisture to condense onto surfaces without forming mist . The transition between the lowland rainforests and the mid @-@ altitude rainforest is gradual . The canopy reaches heights of 18 â 25 m ( 59 â 82 ft ) , and sun @-@ loving epiphytes , shrubs , and other forest floor species take advantage of the elevated light levels . The increased humidity also favors mosses and ferns . The families Rubiaceae , Euphorbiaceae , Myrtaceae , Arecaceae , Pandanaceae , and <unk> are the most common in this zone . 
 <unk> montane <unk> : At 1 @,@ 400 to 1 @,@ 800 m ( 4 @,@ 600 to 5 @,@ 900 ft ) and covering 11 @.@ 5 % of the surface area of the park , the trees are significantly shorter , gnarled and stunted , with the canopy extending to a maximum height of only 10 or 15 m ( 33 or 49 ft ) . The most common plant families are Lauraceae , Rubiaceae , Clusiaceae , and <unk> . The ground layer in the cloud forest is rich , and moss and lichen drape the branches of the trees . At least 122 species of fern are found in this zone . Temperatures are lower , and heavy clouds brought in by eastern winds blanket the forest . Endemism is very high at this altitude , particularly between the various peaks due to long isolation . The area is also highly susceptible to fire due to its thick layer of humus . 
 Montane scrub : Above 1 @,@ 800 m ( 5 @,@ 900 ft ) on only 1 @.@ 5 % of the surface area of the park , the last remaining mountain scrub in Madagascar can be found . Unlike all other high mountain scrub on the island , it has not been altered by fire . The region has an open , tundra @-@ like cover , over thin , rocky soils . Soil conditions , along with the cool temperatures , windy conditions , and low rainfall limits the vegetation , which reaches a maximum height of 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) . Low , dense thickets of shrubs dominate , although terrestrial orchids and miniature palms and bamboos are also present . The dominant families of plant are Poaceae , Ericaceae , Asteraceae , <unk> , <unk> , and Clusiaceae . 
 Of the many plant species found in Marojejy , 35 are palms , several of which are critically endangered and have extremely low populations . Only three of these palm species can be found outside of Madagascar , and seven can only be found at Marojejy . More than 275 fern species are present in the rainforests of the massif , 18 of which are tree ferns and seven are found only at Marojejy . Many of these fern species are very rare and have highly restricted distributions . 
 Marojejy also contains several types of rare rosewood and <unk> ( genus Dalbergia ) , all of which are endemic to Madagascar . Rosewood , or <unk> in Malagasy , is a type of hardwood with a lustrous deep red color , while <unk> , such as Dalbergia madagascariensis , lacks the red color . Of the three species of Dalbergia found in Marojejy , D. madagascariensis and D. <unk> are listed as " vulnerable " on the IUCN Red List , while D. <unk> is listed as " endangered . " The park has few large specimens of the former two due to overexploitation , and specimens are rarely found in the surrounding 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) surrounding the park . The latter , D. <unk> , is not found outside of the park . 
 = = = Fauna = = = 
 Marojejy National Park is best known for its two iconic species , the helmet vanga ( <unk> <unk> ) and the critically endangered silky sifaka or simpona ( Propithecus candidus ) . The silky sifaka has been listed as one of " The World 's 25 Most Endangered Primates " since the inception of the list in 2000 . According to estimates , fewer than 1 @,@ 000 individuals of this species remain , and none exist in captivity . 
 The wealth of species of well @-@ known groups of animals demonstrates the depth of the biodiversity found at Marojejy National Park . For example , 75 of the 118 species of birds ( 64 % ) found in or around Marojejy are forest @-@ dwelling birds , a total that surpasses any other mountain site in Madagascar . All of these forest @-@ dependent bird species are endemic to Madagascar and utilize the forest for some portion of their life @-@ cycle . One of these birds is the Madagascar serpent @-@ eagle ( <unk> <unk> ) , which prior to being reported in 1990 , had not been seen by ornithologists since 1932 . 
 In addition to the silky sifaka , Marojejy is home to 10 other species of lemur , several of which are also endangered due mainly to habitat loss . The nocturnal aye @-@ aye has only been seen once at the park , although one old nest and traces of its feeding have been found at various elevations . Other mammals include at least 15 species of tenrec , seven species of native rodent , the fossa ( Cryptoprocta ferox ) , and the Madagascar sucker @-@ footed bat ( <unk> <unk> ) 
 The reptile and amphibian diversity at Marojejy is also rich , higher than any other protected area in Madagascar . A total of 148 species have been inventoried , and 17 of these are found only in Marojejy , including <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , two species of several chameleons found there . The panther chameleon ( <unk> pardalis ) , leaf @-@ tailed geckos ( genus <unk> ) , and many species of frogs are also reported from this locality . Invertebrates include large millipedes , spiders , and an abundance of small leeches . 
 = = Camps and accommodations = = 
 Marojejy National Park is open all year , with <unk> Travel Guides recommending April to May and September to December as the best times to visit due to less rainfall . The park is one of the only national parks in Madagascar offering wooden chalets or bungalows , in addition to having a kitchen and toilet facilities at each of its three main camps inside a primary rainforest . The housing provides beds and basic bedding , while the kitchen and eating areas are covered and offer basic cooking utensils . These three camps have basic tent sites for campers . Tent campsites are also offered outside the park , while the only other overnight accommodations outside the park are in Andapa and Sambava . The park is unable to accommodate large groups . Because of the rugged terrain and variable temperatures , the <unk> Travel Guide also recommended advanced planning for visiting the park . 
 Payment of the entrance fees , renting of the facilities , and hiring of guides , cooks , and porters are handled at either the park headquarters in Andapa or the Park Visitor Center in Manantenina , which is along the main Andapa @-@ Sambava road , 66 km ( 41 mi ) from Sambava and 40 km ( 25 mi ) from Andapa . The park has a single trail that leads from the information center in Manantenina to the highest peak . The path into the rain forest is divided into three treks that vary in length and lead to each of the three main camps , each of which is situated at different altitudes and offer views of their own distinctive flora and fauna . 
 The first section of the path , known as the Mantella Trek , takes visitors just inside the park entrance , and leads to a picnic area after the first 2 @.@ 5 km ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) . The first camp , Camp Mantella , is 4 @.@ 5 km ( 2 @.@ 8 mi ) further along the path . The camp is in the lowland rain forest above the Manantenina River at an elevation of 450 m ( 1 @,@ 480 ft ) . The camp is 800 m ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) from the Humbert waterfalls , and offers opportunities to see lemurs , such as the northern bamboo lemur ( Hapalemur occidentalis ) ; many species of bird , such as the helmet vanga ; as well as a variety of amphibians and reptiles , such as leaf @-@ tailed geckos , leaf chameleons ( genus <unk> ) , and many types of frogs . 
 The next 2 km ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) along the path is known as the Simpona Trek ; the name comes from the Malagasy name for the silky sifaka , which is found in the area . The trail leads to Camp <unk> , located at an elevation of 775 m ( 2 @,@ 543 ft ) at the transition between lowland and montane rain forest . The camp sits on a mountainside , and its dining area overlooks a forested outcrop of rock , which includes the peak named <unk> , or " Leaning Rock " . This camp is reported to be the best location for spotting the silky sifaka , although the staff recommend that visitors hire a specialist tracker to aid in the search . 
 The Marojejy Summit Trek continues up the mountain for another 2 km ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) to Camp Simpona , which is in the middle of the moist montane forest at an elevation of 1 @,@ 250 m ( 4 @,@ 100 ft ) . There is a ridge with a viewing platform built on it near the camp . Despite the stunted height of the trees in this high @-@ altitude region , silky sifakas can occasionally be spotted from the bungalows . The rufous @-@ headed ground @-@ roller ( <unk> <unk> ) and yellow @-@ bellied sunbird @-@ <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) can be seen here , and a nearby stream teems with a diverse collection of frog species . Camp Simpona also serves as a <unk> for the steep climb to the summit of Marojejy Massif , one of Madagascar 's highest but most accessible peaks . The climb to the peak stretches 2 km ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) and takes four to five hours . 
 = = Local people = = 
 The Andapa Basin , surrounded by the high , rugged mountains of Marojejy and Anjanaharibe @-@ Sud , was extremely remote and difficult to access until relatively recently . As a consequence , the area was not permanently settled until the mid @-@ 1800s , when refugees fled the Merina Kingdom . Nearly half a century later , another wave of refugees settled in the area , this time fleeing from French colonists . The population in the region , however , remained relatively small , despite a last small wave of immigration following World War I when people from RÃ©union came to the region to grow vanilla . The population did not increase noticeably until the early 1970s when construction of the Andapa â Sambava road was completed , connecting the region to the coast . This improved transportation route encouraged agricultural development and spawned another wave of immigration . Over the next 30 years , it was estimated that the population tripled , with more than 100 @,@ 000 people living in the region by 2003 . With 37 villages surrounding Marojejy , the population density is one of the highest in Madagascar and it continues to grow . The dominant ethnic groups in the region are the Tsimihety ( the first settlers ) and the Betsimisaraka , although other groups from the southern part of the island have also established themselves . 
 The local people have traditionally utilized material from the forest , whether for use in their architecture , to make pirogues ( dugout canoes ) , to provide fiber for weaving , to provide firewood , to gather leaves for traditional medicine , or to flavor their drinks . Most of the residents are subsistence rice farmers who cultivate irrigated paddies in valleys or who plant on hillsides that have been cleared and burned ( slash and burn agriculture , known locally as tavy ) . The swamps which formerly covered vast areas of Andapa Basin have been converted to rice paddies which are intensively cultivated ; however the Tsimihety traditionally practice slash and burn techniques on the hillsides in preference to irrigated rice fields . Coffee was an important cash crop before market prices fell in the 1970s , but vanilla remains an important crop for the area . Until the mid @-@ 2000s , vanilla prices were high , but they have since fallen off significantly . The crash of vanilla prices , along with a rapidly growing population and steady decrease in <unk> land , has resulted in widespread and extreme poverty . Between January and April , before the main rice harvest , many people in the region do not receive enough food to eat . The <unk> Region , which includes Marojejy , is the poorest region in Madagascar , and in 2011 , continued rises in global food prices â particularly that of imported rice â has made obtaining food more difficult for rural families . 
 Not only have international environmental organizations ( such as Conservation International , Wildlife Conservation Society , World Wide Fund for Nature , and Care International ) established programs to help local residents , many local people work to improve their situation through environmental and health education programs . An increase in sustainable agriculture , silviculture , conservation awareness , and improved education and health care have also furthered the goal of protecting the environment and promoting livelihoods centered on the remaining forest . Limited and responsible ecotourism is also seen as a long @-@ term alternative to continued deforestation . 
 = = Conservation concerns = = 
 The protections normally afforded to national parks have not halted the degradations of Marojejy National Park . The hunting of lemurs , including the silky sifaka , is a persistent problem , as is the harvesting of precious hardwoods , such as rosewood and <unk> . Semi @-@ precious gemstones , such as amethyst , are still mined within the boundaries of the park , while slash and burn agriculture and wood collection for firewood and construction continue to cause the periphery to recede . These pressures are growing strong as the population in the region continues to increase . In 2003 , approximately 200 @,@ 000 people lived within 40 km ( 25 mi ) of the park , 80 % of whom were farmers that were still dependent upon the forest for agricultural land and various products , such as honey , firewood , and plant fibers , as well as tree bark from plants of the family Rutaceae ( primarily genus <unk> ) used to ferment <unk> , a local sugarcane spirit . Additionally , inappropriate use of the park or excessive visitation by guests could also pose a threat to the fragile high @-@ altitude scrub . 
 = = = Illegal logging = = = 
 Madagascar 's northeastern rain forests are severely threatened by illegal logging of precious hardwood , which not only dries out the forest ( making it susceptible to fire ) , introduces invasive species , degrades habitat , and reduces genetic diversity , but also violates local taboos and traditions . Additional species , such as species of <unk> , are typically cut to make rafts for floating the heavier hardwoods down rivers and out of the parks . Rosewood trees are cut into multiple logs for easier transport , and five or more high @-@ buoyancy trees are cut per hardwood log . To tie the rafts together , the loggers cut thousands of lianas or vines , which are used by 75 % of the forest fauna as avenues for moving around in the canopy . The logging activities are labor @-@ intensive and dangerous . The labor employs the impoverished local population , but the officials who facilitate the process primarily benefit . 
 In 2005 , illegal logging of rosewood was reported to have occurred more than 20 times . In 2007 at the port cities of <unk> , Antalaha , and Toamasina , authorities confiscated thousands of logs valued at millions of dollars ( US $ ) . Some of this material was reportedly logged from eastern and northeastern parts of the park . At the start of the Malagasy political crisis in March 2009 , thousands of woodcutters intensely logged precious hardwoods for six to eight weeks in the <unk> Region . An estimated 52 @,@ 000 tons of rosewood lumber , or nearly 100 @,@ 000 trees , were logged that year , with one @-@ third of the total coming from Marojejy National Park and the remainder from nearby Masoala National Park . As a result , the park was closed briefly , but reopened in May 2009 . In 2010 , the situation improved in Marojejy , but illegal logging intensified in Masoala and the Makira Protected Area . 
 Illegal logging has been facilitated by insufficient governance , unclear forest regulation , and undermined judicial control while the exportation of the acquired logs ( in 1992 , 2006 , and 2009 â 2010 ) has been permitted by government decrees that either precede elections or are issued during periods of political instability . The trade is organized and operated by high @-@ ranking officials and influential businessmen .

 Oliver Evans ( September 13 , 1755 â April 15 , 1819 ) was an American inventor , engineer and businessman . A pioneer in the fields of automation , materials handling and steam power , Evans was one of the most prolific and influential inventors in the early years of the United States . He left behind a long series of accomplishments , most notably designing and building the first fully automated industrial process ; America 's first high @-@ pressure steam engine ; and the first ( albeit crude ) amphibious vehicle and American automobile . 
 Born in Newport , Delaware , Evans received little formal education and in his mid @-@ teens was apprenticed to a wheelwright . Going into business with his brothers , he worked for over a decade designing , building and perfecting an automated mill with devices such as bucket chains and conveyor belts . In doing so Evans designed a continuous process of manufacturing that required no human labor . This novel concept would prove critical to the Industrial Revolution and the development of mass production . Later in life Evans turned his attention to steam power , and built the first high @-@ pressure steam engine in the United States in 1801 , developing his design independently of Richard Trevithick , who built the first in the world a year earlier . Evans was a driving force in the development and adoption of high @-@ pressure steam engines in the United States . Evans dreamed of building a steam @-@ powered wagon and would eventually construct and run one in 1805 . Known as the Oruktor Amphibolos , it was the first automobile in the country and the world 's first amphibious vehicle , although it was too primitive to be a success as either . 
 Evans was a visionary who produced designs and ideas far ahead of their time . He was the first to describe vapor @-@ compression refrigeration and propose a design for the first refrigerator in 1805 , but it would be three decades until his colleague Jacob Perkins would be able to construct a working example . Similarly , he drew up designs for a solar boiler , machine gun , steam @-@ carriage gearshift , dough @-@ kneading machine , perpetual baking oven , marine salvage process , quadruple @-@ effect evaporator and scheme for urban gas lighting ; ideas and designs which would not be made reality until some time after his death . Evans had influential backers and political allies , but lacked social graces and was disliked by many of his peers . Disappointed and then angry at the perceived lack of recognition for his contributions , Evans became combative and bitter in later years , which damaged his reputation and left him isolated . Despite the import of his work , his contributions were frequently overlooked ( or attributed to others after his death ) so he never became a household name alongside the other steam pioneers of his era . 
 = = Early life , 1755 â 83 = = 
 Oliver Evans was born in Newport , Delaware on September 13 , 1755 to Charles and Ann <unk> Evans . His father was a cordwainer by trade , though he purchased a large farm to the north of Newport on the Red Clay Creek and moved his family there when Oliver was still in his infancy . Oliver was the fifth of twelve children ; he had four sisters and seven brothers . Little else is known of Evans 's early life , and surviving records provide few details as to his formative years . The nature and location of his early education has not been preserved , however his literacy was demonstrably strong from a young age , both as a writer and an avid reader on technical subjects . Aged 17 , Evans was apprenticed to a wheelwright and wagon @-@ maker in Newport . An anecdote from the period recalls that his master , an illiterate and extremely frugal man , forbade Evans the use of candles to illuminate his reading in the evenings . Evans found another way by collecting scraps and shavings of wood from his work during the day to serve as fuel for small fires . The Revolutionary War began when Evans was 19 . He enlisted in a Delaware militia company , but saw no active service during the war . 
 By the age of 22 , Evans moved out of wheel @-@ making and became a specialist in forming the fine wire used in textile cards , which were used to comb fibers in preparation for the spinning process to make thread or yarn . A desire to increase the efficiency of this process led him to his first invention â a machine which would bend wire into teeth and cut them off rapidly to aid the assembly of cards . George Latimer , then a justice of the peace in Newport , saw its potential and tasked a blacksmith with creating the machine , which became one of Evans 's early successes when it was introduced in 1778 . Evans wished to go further in <unk> the production of textile cards by developing a machine which could puncture the leather into which the wire teeth were inserted . His invention greatly speeded the card manufacturing process , producing around 1 @,@ 500 teeth every minute , though Evans himself was unable to find financial backing to commercialize his invention . Nevertheless , over the next two decades card manufacturing innovations inspired by Evans 's led to the development of automated textile card production , then in great demand due to the growth of the Southern cotton industry . Early pioneers of mechanized textile @-@ card production , including Giles Richards and Amos Whittemore , are thought to have borrowed heavily from his original designs . 
 Evans also began experimenting in this period with steam power and its potential for commercial application . His early ideas culminated in a Delaware state patent application in 1783 for a steam @-@ powered wagon , but it was denied as Evans had yet to produce a working model . That same year , aged 27 , Evans married Sarah Tomlinson , daughter of a local farmer , in Old Swedes ' Episcopal Church in Wilmington . 
 = = Developing the automatic flour mill , 1783 â 90 = = 
 Evans 's attention turned to flour milling in the early 1780s , an industry which was booming in rapidly industrializing northern Delaware . In this era , the operation of grist mills was labor @-@ intensive . Although the stages of the milling process â grinding , cooling , sifting and packing â were beginning to be mechanized to various degrees , gravity or manual labor was required to move grain from one stage to the next . Additionally , some stages ( particularly cooling ) were slow and inefficient , creating significant production process bottlenecks . Mills were becoming commonplace in populated areas and those with ready access to waterways for power , but the bulk of milling in the 1780s was done in the home through hand milling . Furthermore , the quality of milled wheat was poor in colonial America . Hard wheat varieties were insufficiently ground and sifted by mills , leaving a flour that was coarse and brown . Cross @-@ contamination was a major problem : mill processes were not well @-@ partitioned ; the many people moving about the mill contaminated the flour with dirt , grain and other impurities . The end result , Evans recognized , was a low quality product that took too many laborers to make . 
 In 1783 , two of Evans 's brothers began building a mill in Newport on part of the family 's farm estate which they purchased from their father , and Evans was recruited to oversee its construction on the Red Clay Creek . When the mill opened in 1785 it was of a conventional design , but over the next five years Evans began to experiment with inventions to reduce the reliance upon labor for milling . Moving wheat from the bottom to the top of the mill to begin the process was the most onerous task of all in contemporary mills . Evans 's first innovation was a bucket elevator to facilitate this process . Chains of buckets to raise water was a Roman technology had been used in various guises since antiquity . Evans had seen diagrams of their use for marine applications and realized with some modification and careful engineering they could be used to raise grain , so a series of bucket elevators around a mill could move grain and flour from one process to the next . Another labor @-@ intensive task was that of spreading meal . This came out of the grinding process warm and moist , needing cooling and drying before it could be sifted and packed . Traditionally the task was done by manually shoveling meal across large floors . In response , Evans developed the " hopper boy " , a device which gathered meal from a bucket elevator and spread it evenly over the drying floor â a mechanical rake would revolve around the floorspace . This would even out newly deposited meal for cooling and drying , while a gentle incline in the design of the rake blades would slowly move the flour towards central chutes , from which the material would be sifted . Used in conjunction , the two innovations saved many hours of labor and greatly reduced the risk of contamination . 
 Despite their technical complexity , neither device was revolutionary by the standards of the time . However , the total vision of their design was . Evans was attempting a radical shift in thinking about the manufacturing process , treating it as a continuous integrated whole rather than a series of isolated processes . Thus , manufacturing could be a fully automated production line . The missing link was materials handling , and Evans 's mill designs sought to feed materials continuously through a system without the need for any human intervention . This was the first fully automated industrial process , and the idea of continuous production was proved to be a critical ingredient of the industrial revolution , and would ultimately lay the foundation for modern mass production . 
 Constructing the machinery to realize this vision was complicated . Evans struggled to find the money to pay the highly skilled carpenters needed to construct his complex machines . The nearby flour milling industry on the Brandywine River was large , but dominated by the Quaker millers of Wilmington who saw little potential in Evans 's designs . James Latimer , a Newport flour merchant upon hearing Evans 's ideas exclaimed " Ah ! Oliver , you cannot make water run uphill , you cannot make wooden millers ! " Latimer 's son , George , however once more saw the promise in Evans 's ideas and helped him to secure patent protection over the inventions throughout 1787 and 1788 . By this time Evans converted his brothers ' mill at Red Clay Creek into a fully automated prototype based on his perfected designs , and the Evans brothers sent handbills and diagrams to the major milling centers of the United States offering free licensing of the designs for the first miller in each county who would commission Evans to refit their mills . Yet this campaign was to prove a major disappointment , and little commercial interest materialized . 
 Evans lacked patience however , and coupled with a prickly disposition , was prone to display frustration and bewilderment towards those who could not immediately see the value of his ideas . His ideas and designs were often far ahead of their time , and the idea of a fully automated production process was difficult for contemporaries to comprehend . Evans recalled when some Brandywine millers happened to visit the Red Clay Creek mill in the early years of its operation after it was fully automated . He was alone at the mill that day and making hay in a nearby field , and purposely stayed out of sight so his visitors could observe the mill running independently without human supervision . Evans then appeared and at great length explained how the feat they witnessed was possible , and was convinced that the chance visit would bring about a breakthrough with the Brandywine millers . However , he was frustrated at reports that the millers returned to Wilmington and reported that the Evans mill was " a set of <unk> , unworthy the notice of any man of sense " . <unk> continued even after Evans convinced a Brandywine miller to have his mill converted . 
 After years of persistence and attempts at marketing , Evans 's designs were finally given a trial on larger scales and adopted elsewhere . A breakthrough came in 1789 when the <unk> , a progressively minded Quaker family in Baltimore , invited Evans to refit their mills on the Patapsco River . The refits proved a success , and Evans worked with Jonathan Ellicott to develop a modified form of Archimedean screw that could act as a horizontal conveyor to work alongside the vertically orientated bucket elevators . He added a rake @-@ drill and conveyor belt to his designs , and now possessed a full complement of materials handling machines for just about every possible configuration . In 1790 , Evans moved from Newport to Wilmington and constructed a working model of his designs in the town . Evans 's inventions were given a major boost when leading miller Joseph Tatnall converted his mills to the Evans system , and estimated that in one year the changes saved his operation a small fortune amounting to $ 37 @,@ 000 . Local millers quickly followed suit , and Brandywine Village was soon a showcase for Evans 's milling technology . After almost a decade , the Brandywine millers were finally convinced , and within a short period automated mills began to spread across the eastern seaboard . In 1790 , upon introduction of federal patent law , Evans immediately applied for protection for his milling designs and was granted the third US patent , with his application personally examined and approved by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson , Secretary of War Henry Knox , and Attorney @-@ General Edmund Randolph . 
 = = Writer and merchant , 1790 â 1801 = = 
 Having secured patent protection for his designs and general adoption by the Brandywine millers , Evans now turned his attention outside Delaware . His brother Joseph travelled widely to promote Evans 's work , and according to some sources , by 1792 over one hundred mills were operating Evans machinery . When George Washington called upon Joseph Tatnall in 1790 to thank him for the flour he provided to feed the Continental Army during the War of Independence , he saw Evans 's technology at work in the mills in Brandywine Village and was so impressed that had his own gristmill at Mount Vernon converted to the Evans system in 1791 , the completion of which was overseen by Evans 's brothers . In 1793 , Evans sold his share in the Red Clay Creek mill and moved his family from Wilmington to Philadelphia , where he opened a store for milling supplies . 
 His early years in Philadelphia though were dominated by writing . Initially Evans intended to write a pamphlet to assist millers in the construction of milling machinery , as well as promoting his own automated designs . However , Evans became so engrossed in the project that he ultimately devoted several years to writing a comprehensive book on milling technology that included long chapters on the basic principles of physics , hydraulics and mechanics ; at times neglecting his family 's financial security in order to complete it . The Young Mill @-@ wright and Miller 's Guide when it appeared consisted of five parts : ' Principles of Mechanics and Hydraulics ' , ' Of the different Kinds of Mills ' , ' Description of the Author 's Improvements ' , ' On the Manufacturing of Grain into Flour ' , ' Ellicott 's Plans for Building Mills ' , and a lengthy appendix in which Evans detailed various ideas for other inventions , such as a hot @-@ air system of central heating . Thomas Ellicott , whose family were early adopters of Evans 's designs in Baltimore , contributed a section on mill construction . Much of the theoretical work of the book was based on earlier scientific work on mechanical principles , yet Evans insisted that theoretical sections align with observations in the practical sections , and hence often revised standing theories to comport with experiments he conducted and observations he made . For example , he found what was written on the theoretical mechanical principles of waterwheels did not match what he could replicate in practice , so he revised them based on observation to form a " true theory " and concluded that " neither the old or new theories agree with practice , therefore we must suspect that they are founded on error . But if , what I call the true theory , should continue to agree with practice , the practitioner need not care on what it is founded . " 
 The guide 's list of subscribers was topped by George Washington , Thomas Jefferson and Edmund Randolph when the first edition appeared in print in 1795 . The book proved very popular and remained a staple manual for millers for over half a century , undergoing several revisions and fifteen printed editions between 1795 and 1860 . The book 's popularity rested on its detailed practical explanations of mill design and construction , and as the principal guidebook for American milling it would not be superseded until after the Civil War . 
 After the publication of the Guide , Evans concentrated on his work as a milling supply merchant and gaining financial security through licensing his patented designs . With enough millers now using Evans 's machinery , adoption began to accelerate rapidly after 1800 , as did his considerable wealth from the license fees . In these years Evans concentrated on growing his commercial operations in Philadelphia , expanding his store several times , becoming an agent for English imports , and taking on blacksmiths to complete more complicated metal work for mills . All the while Evans continued to refine various elements of mill design , including patenting a new process for making millstones and developing a screw mill for grinding plaster of Paris , which was in great demand in Philadelphia for stucco work . Evans and his younger brother Evan , along with blacksmith Thomas Clark , developed a device for packing flour barrels using a wooden disc operating by a compound lever and a toggle joint . 
 = = Developing the high @-@ pressure steam engine , 1801 â 06 = = 
 Steam engines appeared in the United States as a source of power in the late 18th century , and living in Delaware and Philadelphia meant Evans was exposed to early examples of their application there . John Fitch had launched the first rudimentary steamboat onto the Delaware River in the late 1780s , and the Philadelphia waterworks was by 1802 operating two low @-@ pressure steam engines to pump water from the Schuylkill River , but these were rare examples and most instances of this new technology were to be found in Europe . Much of the development of steam power had occurred in Great Britain , with Thomas Newcomen and James Watt instrumental in developing and commercializing steam power there and elsewhere in Europe , with several hundred of machines operating there in industrial and labor @-@ saving applications by 1800 . 
 Evans had first begun to consider the potential applications of steam power for transportation while still an apprentice in the 1780s , and had developed rudimentary designs for ' steam carriages ' in the 1790s . In 1801 , Evans definitively began work on making his long @-@ held dream of a steam carriage into reality . Early steam engineers , most notably Watt contemporary William Murdoch , had developed plans for a steam @-@ propelled carriage incorporating a heavy flywheel , in which pressure was converted directly to rotary power , however it became apparent in experimentation that a low @-@ pressure , rotary steam engine would never be powerful enough to propel a carriage of any weight forward . Evans 's attention thus turned to a reciprocating engine , not only for his steam carriage ideas , but also for industrial application . Importantly , Evans became an early proponent of ' strong steam ' or high @-@ pressure engines , an idea long resisted by Watt and earlier steam pioneers because the necessary iron making and metal working technology was lacking . Evans recognized that a high @-@ pressure steam engine would be essential to the development of a steam carriage because they could be built far smaller while providing similar or greater power outputs to low @-@ pressure equivalents . Some experiments with high @-@ pressure steam engines had been made in Europe , most notably an unsuccessful steam tractor developed by Nicolas @-@ Joseph <unk> . However the prevailing fear of early steam engineering was that no boiler could safely contain high @-@ pressure steam . Evans ignored potential drawbacks , and developed radically different designs which called for engines operating at high @-@ pressure and the elimination of the condenser â a central component of conventional designs . His designs also incorporated a grasshopper beam , a double @-@ acting cylinder , and four steam valves . Each valve was independently operated by one of four cams . The resulting design was a high @-@ pressure steam engine that had a higher power @-@ to @-@ weight ratio that prevailing designs , making locomotives and steamboats practical . It was also mechanically simpler than condensing engines , making it less costly to build and maintain , and did not require large volumes of condensing water . These features would make it similarly suited for a variety of industrial applications . 
 As with the automated mill , Evans 's ideas were harshly criticized by other engineers â most notably some of the Philadelphia engineering community including the influential Benjamin Latrobe . As it happened , Cornish engineer Richard Trevithick had simultaneously developed similar ideas in favor of high @-@ pressure engines and begun to experiment with them in developing the first locomotives , but neither knew of the other 's work . 
 Constructing his designs proved far more difficult than Evans initially envisaged â with just six working steam engines in the United States at this time , and a handful of workshops with any experience making them , it took Evans much of his savings and two years to yield a working example to display to the public in 1803 . This first engine was powered by a double @-@ acting cylinder six inches in diameter and with a piston stroke length of eighteen inches . Many components , such as the flywheel and <unk> , were made of wood in order to simplify construction . The boiler , the engineering of which was critical to the safe operation of the engine , consisted of a large copper shell encased in wood and cast iron rings in order to contain the pressure . The output of the machine was approximately five horsepower . This work output was modest by contemporary standards â the low @-@ pressure engine of the nearby waterworks produced about twelve horsepower . But his steam engine was just a fraction of the size of pre @-@ existing machines â the waterworks machine was over twenty @-@ five times larger in volume . Evans unveiled his engine at his store and put it to work crushing plaster of Paris and , more sensationally , sawing slabs of marble . The showmanship paid off , and thousands came to see the machine in operation , while the Philadelphia newspaper Aurora declared " a new era in the history of the steam engine . " 
 = = = Oruktor Amphibolos = = = 
 Evans received a patent for his new steam engine in 1804 , and set about looking for commercial applications . The first of his proposals was for the Lancaster Turnpike Company . He proposed to construct a steam wagon with the capacity to carry 100 barrels of flour between Philadelphia and Lancaster in two days , which by his estimation would greatly increase profits compared to the equivalent five horse wagons , for whom the trip took three days . Evans declared in his proposal that " I have no doubt but that my engines will propel boats against the current of the Mississippi , and waggons [ sic ] on turnpike roads with great profit . " With the company unsure of the reliability and cost of the technology , the proposal was rejected . 
 Despite this setback , within a year Evans had found a client . The Philadelphia Board of Health was concerned with the problem of dredging and cleaning the city 's dockyards and removing sandbars : in 1805 Evans convinced them to contract him to develop a steam @-@ powered dredge . The result was the Oruktor Amphibolos , or " Amphibious Digger " . The vessel consisted of a flat @-@ bottomed scow with bucket chains to bring up mud and hooks to clear away sticks , stones and other obstacles . Power for the dredging equipment and propulsion was supplied by a high @-@ pressure Evans engine . The end result was a craft nearly thirty feet long , twelve feet wide and weighing some seventeen tons . To move this ungainly hulk to the waterfront , as well to give a demonstration of his long @-@ held beliefs in the possibility of land @-@ based steam transportation , Evans mounted the hull on four wheels ( twice , as the first set collapsed under the weight ) and connected the engine to them in order to drive the Oruktor from his workshop through the Philadelphia streets on the way to the Schuylkill River on July 13 , 1805 . The Oruktor Amphibolos is thus believed to have been the first automobile in the United States , and the first motorized amphibious craft in the world . However , very few contemporary accounts of the craft survive , and Evans 's tendency to exaggerate its success in his own annals make verification of its performance difficult . Although Evans himself claimed it proceeded successfully around Philadelphia ( and circled his erstwhile rival Benjamin Latrobe 's Philadelphia waterworks ) before launching into the river and paddling at speed to Philadelphia harbor ; the great weight of the craft make land @-@ propulsion based on its limited engine capacity and jury @-@ rigged power train fairly improbable over any significant distance . It is similarly unknown how well , if at all , the Oruktor functioned as a steamboat , and Evans 's claims on this point vary significantly over the years . Nevertheless , it is known that the invention proved ineffective for its ostensible purpose as a dredger , and it was scrapped for parts by the Board of Health in 1808 . Nevertheless , Evans 's ideas of steam carriages were not an impossible dream . Evans would continue to promote the idea . In 1812 he published a futuristic description of a world connected by a network of Shipping lines railroad tracks and steam locomotives , accurately describing what will happen in the <unk> long before any such potential could be realized : 
 " The time will come when people will travel in stages moved by steam engines , from one city to another , almost as fast as birds fly , fifteen or twenty miles in an hour " 
 = = = Steam Engineer 's Guide = = = 
 Evans frequently quarrelled with fellow inventors and engineering peers over steam technology in the mid @-@ 1800s . His increasing frustration led to his premature publication of what he had hoped would be the equivalent of his earlier manual for millers â the <unk> titled The Abortion of the Young Steam Engineer 's Guide . The Steam Engineer 's Guide was significantly shorter than this first book and less structured in its approach . A third of the book is devoted to an ongoing argument between Evans and John Stevens ( another prominent steam engineer of the day ) , much of which had previously appeared in the journal The Medical Repository and to which now Evans added various additional criticisms of Stevens ' contentions . Evans concludes his book by renouncing inventing and any further work on his designs , complaining of the ingratitude of the public and the unprofitability of the endeavour , although this would prove to be just one of many such assertions by Evans over the coming years . Regardless , the Steam Engineer 's Guide proved to be a popular work , though not on the same scale as his guide to milling , however it was the first book in the United States to make accessible to anyone ideas and techniques for steam engineering . 
 The book begins with an introductory discussion of the principles of steam engines and the relevant physical principles , as well as designs for the Evans high @-@ pressure steam engine , boilers , screw @-@ mills and others . Evans developed a similar suite of tools and tables for potential steam engineers as he had for potential millers , such as tables <unk> the heat and pressure tolerances of various metals , instructions for assembling the basic components of a steam @-@ powered system , and schematics for useful components such as valves and boilers . Evans also used the book to justify the safety of high @-@ pressure steam engines if properly constructed , despite the fact that by this time Evans himself had experienced several boiler explosions in his workshop . However , thermodynamics were little understood in his time . As such , many of Evans 's theoretical contentions , including the ' grand principle ' of steam he develops to guide the mathematical modelling of pressure and fuel in steam engines , were substantially flawed . Although Evans was to be quite successful in the development of high @-@ pressure steam engines ( and his designs were widely used ) , his theoretical understanding of them was limited and he was generally unable to accurately predict the inputs and outputs of his machines . The guide also indulged in a far wider range of topics of interest to Evans , including a compendium of inventions from others which he deemed to be worthy of further circulation â such as a straw @-@ cutter and flour press developed by his brother Evan , and a horse @-@ drawn scraper and earth mover invented by Gershom Johnson . Evans also used the opportunity to encourage government sponsorship of research : 
 " If government would , at the expense of uncertainty , employ ingenious persons , in every art and science , to make with care every experiment that might lead to the extension of our knowledge of principles , carefully recording the experiments and results so that they might be fully relied on , and leaving readers to draw their own inferences , the money would be well expended ; for it would tend greatly to aid the progress of improvement in the arts and sciences . " 
 This suggestion stemmed from the observation that many engineers relied on the basic principles of physics and mechanics to guide their work , and yet this often required inventors and engineers to become scientists as well to obtain experimental data â something that they were rarely qualified or resourced to do . Short of government funding of such research , Evans also attempted to create in the aftermath of the Steam Engineer 's Guide what he called ' The Experiment Company ' , which would be a private research consortium to conduct reliable experiments and gather data for the benefits of subscribed members . The venture failed and Evans could find no paying stockholders to launch it , possibly due to Evans committing the new venture to developing a steam wagon of his own design . The Franklin Institute would be founded in Philadelphia a few years after Evans 's death on similar principles . 
 = = = Refrigeration = = = 
 Despite an incomplete understanding of the principles behind them , in some ways Evans 's thinking about the potential for steam engines was once again far ahead of its time . In the postscript of the Steam Engineer 's Guide , Evans noted that drawing a vacuum on water reduces its boiling point and cools it . He further observed that a vacuum would have the same effect upon ether , and the resulting cooling should be sufficient to produce ice . He went on to describe a piston vacuum pump apparatus to produce this effect , and also showed that a compression cylinder , or the compression stroke of the vacuum pump , should produce heat in a condenser . Thus Evans had produced the first detailed and theoretically coherent design for a vapor @-@ compression refrigerator , identifying all the major components ( expander , cooling coil , compressor and condenser ) of a refrigeration cycle , leaving some to credit him as the ' grandfather of refrigeration ' . Although Evans never developed a working model of his designs , and there is no evidence that he ever attempted to , Evans in his later life worked and associated extensively with fellow inventor Jacob Perkins on steam engines and the potential for refrigeration . Perkins would later develop and build a refrigeration device for which he received patents in 1834 â 1835 , employing much the same principles originally put forward by Evans . 
 = = Mars Works , 1806 â 12 = = 
 Having , in his view , perfected many of his ideas and designs for steam engines , Evans turned his attention once more to the commercial propagation of his inventions . His first steam engines had been constructed on an ad @-@ hoc basis , often with improvised tools and workers , and he had relied heavily on blacksmiths and other metal @-@ working shops in Philadelphia with little experience in the more precise metal @-@ work required to build steam engines . In particular , Evans soon realized that unlike his milling machines of wood and leather he would need specialist skills , precision tools and a large foundry in order to build steam machines on a commercial basis . Thus , Evans constructed the Mars Works on a large site a few blocks north of his store in Philadelphia . The choice of name , after the Roman god of war , is thought to have been aspirational and a challenge to the Soho Foundry near Birmingham in the United Kingdom , famous for building the Watt and Boulton engines . Indeed , the completed Mars Works was one of the largest and best equipped outfits of its kind in the United States â by contemporary accounts it featured a substantial foundry , <unk> 's shop , blacksmith 's shops , millstone maker , a steam engine works and a large steam engine of its own to grind materials and work wrought iron . With over thirty @-@ five staff , the Mars Works produced a wide range of manufactures ranging from working steam engines to cast iron fittings , as well as milling and farming machines for Evans 's now well @-@ established agricultural clientele . Steam engine orders alone proved insufficient to support the extensive business costs ; hence the works became highly experienced in producing all kinds of heavy machinery , contributing to Philadelphia 's emergence as a leading center for such work in the 19th century . Indeed , the works even received military orders , casting naval cannons during the War of 1812 . Evans also proved highly innovative in designing steam power solutions for his clients . In one example where the Mars Works was commissioned to build engines for wool processing factories in Middletown , Connecticut , Evans designed a network of accompanying pipes with radiators to heat the factory with engine exhaust . 
 Although there are no records as to the designs of the early steam engines produced by the Mars Works , Evans 's most famous engine design appeared around 1812 . Called the Columbian Engine as a patriotic gesture , it would prove to be the most advanced and successful steam engine design created by Evans â he brought to bear his now extensive experience in designing and building high @-@ pressure steam engines . This horizontally oriented engine allowed the crankshaft and piston rod to work closely together at one end of the machine , thus reducing the need for a heavy working beam like those required for conventional engines . The piston rod itself was kept working to a straight line while by a new type of linkage wherein two sets of pivoted bars guided the movements of the working bar . This linkage is still known as the Evans straight @-@ line linkage , though it was superseded within a few years by more precise straight line mechanisms . The Columbian was also the culmination of the grasshopper @-@ style of steam engine . Perfected designs like the Columbian saw a popularization of the grasshopper @-@ style and its wide use in a range of applications . In 1813 he made the decision to introduce a condenser to the Columbian design . This significantly cut the running cost to the engine , and at this point his engines were as efficient and powerful as low @-@ pressure Watt @-@ Boulton designs , yet far cheaper to build and smaller in size . Within a year 27 Columbian engines were operating or under construction in applications ranging from sawmilling and grain milling to the manufacturing of paper , wire and wool . 
 = = = Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company = = = 
 As the reputation of the Mars Works grew , so too did the demand for its products . After a few years the Mars Works began exporting its engines inland . Oliver Evans 's son George was the first such order , having moved to Pittsburgh in 1809 to operate the Pittsburgh Steam Flour Mill . George and the mill were highly successful , and generated a great deal of interest in Evans 's engines across the interior . However exporting engines to western Pennsylvania , Kentucky or Ohio was challenging and expensive from a logistical perspective . In 1811 Evans and George , as well as another successful steam miller and engineer Luther Stephens , founded the Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company , which in addition to engines would , like the Mars Works , produce heavy machinery and castings in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . With high demand for industrial products and relatively little industrial capacity , the Pittsburgh works added to its repertoire the capacity for brasswork , as well as producing finer products for domestic purposes like hinges and fittings . 
 The location of the Pittsburgh factory in the Mississippi River watershed was important in the development of high @-@ pressure steam engines for the use in steamboats , and the new company began to promote its engines for river transport . Evans had long been a believer in the application of steam engines for maritime purposes . In his book of 1805 , Evans had stated : 
 " The navigation of the river Mississippi , by steam engines , on the principles here laid down , has for many years been a favorite subject of the author , and among the fondest wishes of his heart " 
 Evans had long been an acquaintance of John Fitch , the first to build a steamboat in the United States , and the two had worked together on steam projects . The Oruktor Amphibolos was Evans 's lone attempt at building his own steamboat powered by a high @-@ pressure engine and Evans himself was often vague in appraising its capabilities . Yet Robert Fulton had found success with the North River Steamboat on the Hudson River in 1807 , and thereafter steamboats became a reality . Although he used low @-@ pressure engines , Fulton had in 1812 contacted Evans about the possibility of using Evans 's engines , though that correspondence did not lead to the implementation of any of Evans 's designs for Fulton 's steamships . The Mississippi and tributaries experienced far stronger currents than eastern counterparts , and low @-@ pressure steamboats lacked the power to counteract these . The Enterprise was the first viable steamboat to run on these rivers , and its designer Daniel French employed an adapted Evans ' engine for the purpose . High @-@ pressure engines became the standard on the Mississippi , though relatively few of those were actually built by the Pittsburgh works as Evans ' patent on high @-@ pressure engines was not widely enforced , and many other engine shops opened on the Mississippi that freely adapted Evans ' designs for their own purposes . 
 Notable examples of river steamboats that were constructed by the Pittsburgh and Mars Works include the Franklin , the Aetna and the Pennsylvania . Another , christened the Oliver Evans but renamed the Constitution by its eventual owners , was lost along with the eleven crew members when its boiler exploded near Point <unk> , Louisiana . Evans was deeply distressed by the news , although he defended the safety of high @-@ pressure engines and cited any explosions as an extremely rare occurrences . 
 = = = Patent battles = = = 
 Evans found himself in battles to protect his intellectual property many times throughout his career , but he pursued the cause most doggedly during his latter years . His first and most successful patents concerning flour @-@ milling proved the most problematic to defend , and Evans ' battles proved influential in setting precedent for the newly established area of federal patent law . His original patent for his automated flour @-@ mill expired in January 1805 , but Evans believed that the fourteen year patent term was too brief and petitioned the Congress to extend it . In January 1808 An Act for the Relief of Oliver Evans was passed and signed by President Jefferson , a long @-@ time admirer of Evans 's work . The act took the extraordinary step of reviving to Evans his expired patent and giving it another fourteen year term â Evans was delighted , but the move was to highly problematic , particularly regarding those who had implemented Evans 's designs in the intervening three year period between the patent terms , as many millers had waited for Evans 's patent to expire before upgrading their mills . 
 Evans and his agents set about aggressively collecting royalties from those using his designs . Furthermore , Evans significantly raised the license fees for his use of his patented technology , raising claims of extortion from those being asked to pay , and a great many cases ended up in court . The 1808 act had indemnified those who had adopted Evans 's technologies from 1805 to 1808 , but did not specify whether this indemnity was perpetual ( as defendants argued ) or whether it was only for the three years in question ( as Evans argued ) . Evans by this stage of his life had also established a poor reputation for himself amongst the milling community , and his abrasive and often petty pursuit of patent rights stiffened resistance . Several major legal cases questioned whether laws to extend private patents in this manner were even constitutional , but Evans ultimately prevailed in each case . 
 The most bitter legal battle began in 1809 . Evans sued Samuel Robinson â a miller near Baltimore who was using Evans 's improvements without a license to produce a very modest amount of flour â for damages of $ 2 @,@ 500 . That sum was deemed unjustifiably high and harsh by many , and Evans 's actions rallied the Baltimore community against him , and when the case was finally heard in 1812 many appeared in support of the defendant . Evans 's detractors presented evidence and witnesses at the trial to press the argument that Evans did not truly invent much of what his patents protected . Although the hopper @-@ boy was undoubtedly original , the use of bucket chains and Archimedean screws had been used since ancient times and Evans had only modified some of their features and adapted them for use in a milling context . A now retired Thomas Jefferson weighed into the debate in letters to both Evans and his detractors , questioning the philosophy of patent law and what truly defined ' invention ' and ' machine ' ( and to some extent the validity of his claims ) but ultimately defended the purpose of patent law , which was to incentivize innovation by rewarding inventors for their development and sharing of new technology . And Jefferson noted that though Evans 's designs consisted of devices that had long existed beforehand , everyone had access to these and yet only Evans had thought to modify and use them in conjunction to build an automatic mill . Ultimately the jury found in favor of Evans , but it was a pyrrhic victory as Evans had put most of the milling community offside in the process , and ultimately reduced his claim against Robinson to $ 1 @,@ 000 . In response , prominent Evans critic Isaac McPherson , made submission to Congress in the wake of the trial entitled Memorial to the Congress of Sundry Citizens of the United States , Praying Relief from the <unk> Operations of Oliver Evans ' Patent , seeking to limit the compensation Evans could seek for his patent 's use or for Congress to void it altogether . Although the Senate drafted a bill that would roll @-@ back some of Evans 's patent rights , it did not pass , and he continued to vigorously pursue his patent fees . It would not be until the Patent Act of 1836 that many of these issues , including what constituted originality in the context of a patent , would be addressed . 
 = = Later life and death , 1812 â 19 = = 
 Although Evans had always suffered from bouts of depression , and bitterness towards those he felt did not appreciate his inventions , such sentiments seemed to peak in his later years . During one of his many legal battles in 1809 , comments from the presiding judge sent Evans into a particular fury in which he dramatically incinerated many schematics and papers regarding his inventions , both prior and future . Evans declared at the time that inventing had led only to heartache , disappointment and under @-@ appreciation ; and committed himself to business and material acquisition for the sake of his family . Ultimately what was burned represents only a small proportion of what survives from Evans , and he did continue his interest in inventing , but the tone of Evans 's later life was undoubtedly one of hostility and disappointment . 
 Evans gradually withdrew from the operations of his workshops , with his son George managing operations in Pittsburgh and his sons @-@ in @-@ law James Rush and John Muhlenberg likewise in Philadelphia . The Mars Works was by now an established entity , receiving prestigious commissions such as the engines for the Philadelphia Mint in 1816 . Records indicate the Mars Works would turn out more than one hundred steam engines by the time of Evans death . In retirement Evans became increasingly consumed with pursuing his patent dues from those using his technology , which was now widespread . In 1817 he stated that his time was " wholly engrossed by law suits " . Evans had become somewhat obsessed and took on a siege mentality , penning to his numerous lawyers ( at its height he had fifteen working on his various cases across the United States ) his final work , known as Oliver Evans to His Counsel : Who are Engaged in Defence of His Patent Rights , for the Improvements He Has Invented : Containing a Short Account of Two Out of Eighty of His Inventions , Their Rise and Progress in Despite of All Opposition and Difficulties , and Two of His Patents with Explanations . Evans undertook travel to distant areas of the country in order to find offenders . On a trip to Vermont , Evans visited various mills and then promptly engaged a lawyer there to press charges against twenty @-@ two of them for perceived breeches of his patent rights . 
 In his last years Evans compiled a list , since lost , of all his inventions â eighty in total , as alluded to in the title of his last publication to his lawyers . Some of his unfinished ideas that are known include a scheme for the gas lighting of cities in the United States , a means for raising sunken ships , a machine gun , a self @-@ oiling shaft bearing , various types of gearshift for steam carriages , a dough @-@ kneading machine and a perpetual baking oven . In one proposal in 1814 , as the British Navy threatened Washington , D.C. during the War of 1812 , Evans ventured to build a steam @-@ powered frigate , but the scheme didn 't get far . 
 In 1816 his wife Sarah died , although the cause is unrecorded . Evans remarried two years later in April 1818 to Hetty Ward , who was many years his junior and the daughter of the New York innkeeper . In these last years Evans lived in New York with his new wife . In early 1819 Evans developed an inflammation of the lungs and after a month of illness , died on April 15 , 1819 . Just four days prior , on April 11 , news had reached him in New York that the Mars Works in Philadelphia had burned down , though his sons @-@ in @-@ law were committed to re @-@ establishing the business and did so further outside of the city . Evans was buried at Zion Episcopal Church in Manhattan , but when that church was sold his body was moved several times until finally resting in 1890 in an unmarked common grave at Trinity Cemetery , Broadway at 157th Street , New York City .

 Undoubtedly , Evans ' contributions to milling were profound and the most rapidly adopted . Within his lifetime American milling had undergone a revolution , and his designs allowed mills to be built on industrial @-@ scales with far greater efficiency . Now a more profitable enterprise , the number of mills increased dramatically across the United States . The price of flour fell significantly , availability increased , and the automated drying and bolting processes increased the quality and fineness of flour . In turn this led to major shift in bread making â cheaper and better quality flour lowered the cost of bread production and within a generation the majority of bread consumption shifted from the home @-@ made to store @-@ bought . The revolution was even more far @-@ reaching in Europe where the so @-@ called " American System " was quickly adopted by the milling industry and triggered major increases in food production â sorely needed in a period of almost continual warfare at the turn of the 18th century . 
 Although several key elements of Evans 's designs â such as bucket elevators and Archimedean screws â were merely modified rather than invented by him , the combination of many machines into an automated and continuous production line was a unique idea that would prove pivotal to both the Industrial Revolution and the development of mass production . Scientific and technical historians now generally credit Evans as the first in a line of industrialists that culminated with Henry Ford and the modern assembly line . His concept of industrial automation was far ahead of its time , and the paradigm shift within manufacturing towards that concept would take more than a century to be fully realized . However continuous process manufacturing would spread from Evans 's milling designs , first to related industries such as brewing and baking , then eventually to a wide variety of products , as technology and prevailing opinion caught up . Evans contributions were later deemed to be so important that eminent industrial historian Sigfried Giedion would conclude that in this respect , Evans " opens a new chapter in the history of mankind " . 
 Evans ' contributions to steam were not as ground @-@ breaking as his earlier work in milling but he played a critical role by inventing and propagating the high @-@ pressure steam engine in the United States . Evans ' engines , particularly the Columbian , were highly influential in early steam @-@ power applications in United States ( particularly in the evolution of steamboats and steam @-@ powered industrial processes ) . Yet once more Evans was ahead of the curve with many of his ideas , and his death during steam 's infancy in the United States meant that it would be some time before many of his ideas would come to fruition . For example , although a leading advocate for high @-@ pressure engines , it would not be until the 1830s that such engines definitively replaced low @-@ pressure designs . And Evans ' dream of a steam wagon , notwithstanding the brave attempt of the Oruktor Amphibolos , would not see widespread adoption until even later . And unlike his earlier contributions , Evans was just one of many brilliant minds in steam technology . It would be another inventor , Richard Trevithick , working totally independently of Evans who would develop the high @-@ pressure engine that would make that dream possible . 
 And yet despite his formidable record and undoubted importance in the history of technology , Evans never became a household name . In this respect Evans was his own worst enemy . He was deeply affected by a perceived lack of recognition and appreciation from his peers for his work , and his bouts of depression would lead him to act in the extreme , prematurely ending projects and vowing to give up inventing many times over the course of his life . In time these feelings turned to bitterness and vengeance towards those who criticized or doubted him , and led him to become notoriously bombastic and combative , often aggrandizing his accomplishments and fiercely denouncing critics ( such as the wild exaggerations as to the success of the Oruktor Amphibolos at the end of his life ) . While his relentless pursuit of patent rights did indeed force people to pay him his due , the process badly damaged his reputation and made him many enemies . A leading Philadelphia merchant summed it up in 1802 , stating " few if any [ millers ] are inclined to give pompous blockhead , Oliver Evans , the credit of inventing any of the useful contrivances in milling for which he now enjoys patents . " 
 And yet in spite of his anguish and the weight of his detractors , Evans was steadfastly persistent in the pursuit of his ideas , a quality which Evans felt would ultimately see him triumph . The French translator of the Young Steam Engineer 's Guide agreed , concluding " posterity will place his name among those who are most truly distinguished for their eminent services rendered to their country and to humanity .

 Saint @-@ Inglevert Airfield is a general aviation airfield at Saint @-@ Inglevert , Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais , [ Note 1 ] France . In the First World War an airfield was established near Saint @-@ Inglevert by the Royal Flying Corps , later passing to the Royal Air Force on formation and thus becoming RAF Saint Inglevert . 
 In 1920 , a civil airfield was established on a different site which was a designated customs airfield . During the Second World War , Saint @-@ Inglevert was occupied by the Royal Air Force and the ArmÃ©e de l 'Air . The airfield was captured by the Germans towards the end of the Battle of France and occupied by the Luftwaffe . It was abandoned in 1941 , but in 1943 field artillery units were based around the airfield as part of the Atlantic Wall . Although civil flying returned to Saint @-@ Inglevert post @-@ war , the airfield was abandoned in 1957 and returned to agriculture . It was reopened by l <unk> du Boulonnais ( English : Boulogne Aero Club ) in 1986 .

From 29 June to 23 October , No. 214 Squadron RAF were based there flying Handley Page O / 400s , and in November , they were replaced by No. 115 Squadron RAF , who were flying the same type of aircraft . Two more squadrons , No. 97 Squadron RAF and No. 100 Squadron RAF , were based there from 17 November , to be joined by two squadrons of the United States Navy in 1918 , flying Sopwith Camels . All Royal Air Force squadrons departed from Saint @-@ Inglevert on 4 March 1919 .

 In 1920 , an airfield was established at Saint @-@ Inglevert on a different site to the former military airfield . Facilities developed over the years to include two hangars , customs facilities and ultra short wave radio . In March 1920 , a Notice to Airmen was issued stating that Saint @-@ Inglevert was open and fuel , oil and water were available , but there were no hangars or repair facilities . A proposal to designate Saint @-@ Inglevert as a customs airfield in order to relieve Le Bourget of some of its workload was made in April 1920 . Facilities then in existence included hangars , repair facilities and a radio station . Later that month , it was notified [ Note 2 ] that an aerial lighthouse had been installed at the airfield , flashing the Morse letter A , and Saint @-@ Inglevert became a customs airport on 20 May . By July , the provision of ground signals at Saint @-@ Inglevert had begun . A 10 @-@ metre @-@ long ( 33 ft ) arrow was displayed indicating the wind direction . In August , it was reported that Saint @-@ Inglevert was sending weather report by radio seven times a day to Le Bourget . By October , aids available included a windsock and a landing T. Requirements for aircraft to perform clockwise or anticlockwise circuits when landing were indicated by the flying of a red or white flag respectively . The aerial lighthouse was reported to be out of action in November 1920 . 
 It was notified that the road forming the eastern boundary of the airfield was to be marked by a series of posts 1 m ( 3 ft 3 in ) high , surmounted by vertical white discs 50 cm ( 20 in ) in diameter , in January 1921 , and the following month , a Notice to Airmen issued in the United Kingdom stated that radio communication with Saint @-@ Inglevert was to be in French . As part of a series of trials to assess the viability of civil aviation in France , a Farman F.60 Goliath flew a 4 @,@ 500 @-@ kilometre ( 2 @,@ 800 mi ) test flight carrying 2 @,@ 250 kg ( 4 @,@ 960 lb ) of cargo on 1 May . Three laps of a circuit Paris - OrlÃ©ans - Rouen - Saint @-@ Inglevert - Metz - Dijon - Paris were flown . Saint @-@ Inglevert was one of the designated landing places for the 1921 Coupe Michelin , an aerial circuit of France with a â£ 20 @,@ 000 prize . In November , a Compagnie des Messageries AÃ©riennes aircraft called at Saint @-@ Inglevert to collect a cargo of six 18 @-@ pounder and three 4 @.@ 5 â inch live shells for onward transmission to Croydon Airport in Surrey , United Kingdom . In a paper read to the Royal Aeronautical Society on 17 November , Colonel Frank Searle , managing director of Daimler Airway , criticized the organization of Saint @-@ Inglevert and Le Bourget . 
 In or about March 1922 , the wireless station at Saint @-@ Inglevert was destroyed in a fire . A meeting of airlines and the British Air Ministry in April following the first mid @-@ air collision of airliners on 7 April at <unk> @-@ Saint @-@ Antoine , Oise resulted in a number of resolutions being passed with the intention of improving the safety of aviation , one of which was that the Saint @-@ Inglevert wireless station should be replaced . The aerial lighthouse at Saint @-@ Inglevert was in operation again by 11 April , when a test flight was flown at night on the British part of the London - Paris air route . The aircraft flew as far as Saint @-@ Inglevert before turning back and landing at Lympne , Kent . In December , a Notice to Airmen stated that a portable searchlight was in operation at Saint @-@ Inglevert by prior arrangement for aircraft landing at night , and that the " T " was illuminated at night . 
 In April 1923 , a â£ 25 @,@ 000 prize ( then worth Â£ 360 ) was offered by the daily newspaper Le Matin for the first French aviator to fly from Saint @-@ Inglevert to Lympne and back in one day in an aircraft of French design and construction , with an engine capacity of less than 1 @,@ 100 cubic centimetres ( 67 cu in ) . Georges <unk> won the prize when he completed the journey during the evening of 6 May in a Dewoitine aircraft fitted with a Clerget engine . It took him 2 hours and 25 minutes , including a 40 @-@ minute stop at Lympne while one of the struts supporting the undercarriage was repaired . 
 Imperial Airways were operating cross @-@ channel services using Armstrong Whitworth Argosy aircraft in 1924 , with the first stop in France at Saint @-@ Inglevert . When an aircraft departed from Lympne for St Inglevert , the destination airfield was advised , and if arrival was not notified within two hours , the British coastguard was informed . Communication between the airfields used Carmichael <unk> UHF transmitters . A new system was introduced for non @-@ radio aircraft crossing the English Channel in August . Aircraft crossing from Lympne to Ostend , Belgium had to make a circuit of the airfield at an altitude of 1 @,@ 000 ft ( 300 m ) , while two circuits were made if departing for Saint @-@ Inglevert . The destination was then informed by radio of the departure . Arrival was confirmed by the aircraft flying another circuit , and was then reported back to Lympne by radio . If the aircraft had not arrived within an hour of departure , it would be considered as missing . A similar arrangement applied for aircraft flying in the reverse direction . In September , Saint @-@ Inglevert was one of the landing points for an aerial " Tour de France " , in which a specified route had to be flown on a 2 @,@ 120 @-@ kilometre ( 1 @,@ 320 mi ) course . Sixteen aircraft competed in four classes . 
 The airfield has been involved in several aviation records . On 18 September 1928 , Juan de la Cierva completed the first cross @-@ Channel flight in an autogyro when he landed there after departing from Lympne in a Cierva <unk> <unk> Beardmore completed the first cross @-@ Channel flight in a glider on 19 June 1931 . He took off from Lympne and was towed by an aircraft to an altitude of 14 @,@ 000 ft ( 4 @,@ 300 m ) , landing at Saint @-@ Inglevert after a flight of one and a half hours to the surprise of the airfield manager . The first double crossing of the Channel in a glider was made by Austrian Robert Kronfeld on 20 June . In a glider called Wien , he took off from Saint @-@ Inglevert by means of an aero @-@ tow to an altitude of 5 @,@ 000 ft ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) , and landed at the former RAF Swingfield airfield near Dover , Kent . From Swingfield , another aero @-@ tow to an altitude of 10 @,@ 000 ft ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) enabled him to return to Saint @-@ Inglevert . Kronfeld received a Â£ 1 @,@ 000 prize from the Daily Mail for his flights , which were verified by the British Gliding Association . On 10 September 1929 , Charles <unk> departed from Saint @-@ Inglevert in a Mauboussin aircraft fitted with an ABC Scorpion engine . The 848 @-@ kilometre ( 527 mi ) flight to Pau set a new FÃ©dÃ©ration AÃ©ronautique Internationale world record for distance flown by a single seat aircraft weighing less than 200 kg ( 440 lb ) . 
 In November 1932 , it was reported that new radio equipment was to be installed at Lympne and St Inglevert operating on the 15 centimetre waveband at 2 @,@ 000 MHz , which would be used for the announcement of departures of non @-@ radio aircraft across the Channel . Messages sent by radio were also printed out by a teleprinter , providing a record of the communication . The British Air Ministry and the French MinistÃ¨re de l 'Air co @-@ operated in the arrangements for setting up the system , which was scheduled to come into operation in Spring 1933 . It proved its effectiveness on 7 March 1933 , when a non @-@ radio de Havilland DH.60 Moth of British Air Transport failed to arrive at Lympne . The aircraft had ditched in the Channel and both occupants were rescued by a steamship bound for Amsterdam , the Netherlands . A new short @-@ wave radio system came into operation on 16 January 1934 , using equipment manufactured by Le <unk> <unk> , Paris . 
 In the mid @-@ 1930s , a number of notable people used Saint @-@ Inglevert Airfield . King Edward VIII made three visits , the first on 4 February 1935 , while still the Prince of Wales , when he arrived from Fort Belvedere , Surrey on the first part of a journey to take a holiday at KitzbÃ¼hel , Austria . As king , he departed on 26 July 1936 to RAF Hendon on his return from the ceremony to unveil the Canadian National Vimy Memorial , and flew in from the Great West Aerodrome , Harmondsworth , UK on 8 August , in order to catch the Orient Express at Calais , as part of a holiday in Yugoslavia . Henri Mignet flew from Saint @-@ Inglevert to Lympne on 13 August 1935 , in his Flying Flea , then the world 's smallest aircraft . 
 = = = Second World War = = = 
 Following the outbreak of the Second World War , Saint @-@ Inglevert was taken over by the ArmÃ©e de l 'Air in December 1939 . Groupe <unk> d <unk> 516 ( GAO 516 ) of the <unk> Corps d 'ArmÃ©e ( English : Air Observation Group 516 of the 16th Army Corps ) were based here , operating five Potez 63 @-@ 11 and five Breguet 27 aircraft , and carrying out air reconnaissance over the Nord @-@ Pas de Calais region . " B " Flight , No. 615 Squadron RAF was stationed at Saint @-@ Inglevert in the early months of 1940 , equipped with Gloster Gladiator II aircraft . [ Note 3 ] Following the discovery of a dismantled Morane @-@ Saulnier <unk> in one of the hangars , a wager was made between the British and French as to whether or not the aircraft could be returned to the air . With the aid of materials supplied by the French , the aircraft was made flyable , but when 615 Squadron received orders to relocate to Vitry @-@ en @-@ Artois , an attempt to fly the aircraft to the new base was unsuccessful , and a forced landing had to be made in a field . On 10 May 1940 , the airfield was attacked by the Luftwaffe , with over 110 bombs being dropped , resulting in a Breguet being destroyed , another Breguet and a Potez being severely damaged and the radio facilities being temporarily put out of action . 
 During April 1940 , No. 607 Squadron RAF was based at Saint @-@ Inglevert , flying Gloster Gladiator Mk II HR aircraft . The military commander General Maxime Weygand visited the airfield on 21 May , and ordered 516 GAO to prepare to evacuate as the Germans were in the neighbouring Somme department . The following day , the order came to evacuate to Boos airfield , Rouen , Haute @-@ Normandie , but only four of the ten aircraft that departed from Saint @-@ Inglevert arrived safely at Boos . All aircraft carried as many passengers as could be accommodated . Two Potez 63 @-@ 11 's and a Bloch <unk> were abandoned at Saint @-@ Inglevert , and were destroyed to prevent their use by the enemy , as were supplies of fuel . Personnel from 516 GAO were evacuated from <unk> on the French destroyer <unk> , although nineteen of them were killed when the ship struck a mine and sank . 
 Saint @-@ Inglevert was captured by the Luftwaffe towards the end of the Battle of France . 1 Gruppe , Lehrgeschwader 2 moved in on 20 June , equipped with Messerschmitt Bf 109 aircraft . They departed for Jever , Germany , on 12 July , and were replaced by 1 Gruppe , Jagdgeschwader 51 , also equipped with Bf 109s . From August until November Stab JG 51 were in occupation , and AufklÃ¤rungsgruppe 32 ( H ) aircraft were also based at Saint @-@ Inglevert during this period , with the unit operating Henschel Hs 126 parasol monoplanes . On 30 July 1940 , Saint @-@ Inglevert was bombed by the Royal Air Force , who claimed that hangars and aircraft were damaged , and a subsequent raid on 19 August resulted in a fire , smoke from which could be seen in Kent . 
 From 24 September to 5 November , 2 Gruppe , Jagdgeschwader 27 were based there . Facilities at the airfield were improved , by erecting new hangars and constructing a new 600 @-@ by @-@ 50 @-@ metre ( 1 @,@ 970 ft Ã 160 ft ) concrete runway . On 27 December 1940 , Saint @-@ Inglevert was again bombed by the Royal Air Force . The airfield was largely abandoned by 1941 , with occasional use by Junkers 52s as a refuelling station . 
 In 1943 , the airfield was designated as StÃ¼tzpunkt 134 Paderborn , housing defence units as part of the Atlantic Wall coastal fortifications . The units were equipped with 10 @.@ 5 cm leFH 18 howitzers . During the winter of 1943 @-@ 44 , 10 @.@ 5 cm leFH 324 ( f ) howitzers replaced the leFH 18s . A number of concrete bunkers were constructed to house the guns , which were still standing around the airfield in October 2007 . Following Operation Overlord at the start of the Allied invasion of western Europe , the Germans committed various acts of sabotage on departure from Saint @-@ Inglevert . 
 = = = Post @-@ war = = = 
 Post @-@ war , the airfield was restored to operational condition and civil flying returned . On 10 April 1957 , a report was published which resulted in the abandonment of Saint @-@ Inglevert in favour of an airport 6 km ( 4 mi ) east of Calais . The airfield was returned to agriculture . 
 In 1986 , l <unk> du Boulonnais took over Saint @-@ Inglevert following closure of their previous base at Ambleteuse . Since its closure , the runway had been used as a dump for old tyres and scrap vehicles , and it took three years to restore the airfield , which reopened on 30 July 1989 . On the night of 5 â 6 April 2010 , a fire in a hangar at Saint @-@ Inglevert destroyed the hangar and eight aircraft . The destroyed aircraft were replaced by a Robin <unk> , a Robin <unk> , a Piel Emeraude <unk> and a <unk> <unk> . A Piper PA @-@ 28 was also acquired which needed restoration to make it airworthy . The replacement aircraft were housed in a 10 @-@ by @-@ 10 @-@ metre ( 33 ft Ã 33 ft ) tent hangar erected on the airfield , or temporarily <unk> at Calais or Le Touquet . A new 30 @-@ by @-@ 20 @-@ metre ( 98 ft Ã 66 ft ) hangar , replacing the one destroyed by the fire , was officially opened on 30 March 2012 , and can accommodate ten aircraft . Following the fire , a NOTAM was issued temporarily restricting the use of the airfield until 15 November 2010 to aircraft based there . On 26 August 2010 , Saint @-@ Inglevert was given the ICAO identifier <unk> , allowing it to be classed as a public airfield instead of a private one . This had taken ten years to achieve .

 In 2006 , the sculpture was removed and returned to its owner due to construction of the MAX Light Rail . The University of Washington 's Architectural Commission considered moving the work to a " very unique site " because of its design and size . Young was a professor of art at the institution .

 According to Young , Soaring Stones represents the " interface between man and nature " . It consists of six irregularly shaped pieces of Washington granite that were quarried from the Cascade Range , displayed in a row in ascending height . While installed in Portland , the first stone was sunk into the pavement . The rest were set on polished stainless steel pedestals , the tallest of which reached 11 @.@ 5 ft ( 3 @.@ 5 m ) .

 In 1990 , The Seattle Times said Soaring Stones ' ascending pieces looked " as if they were taking off into flight ... [ r ] ather like Young 's career " . The sculpture was included in at least one published walking tour of Portland and in another by Whitman College about art on the campus . David Glenn , professor of music at Whitman College , took inspiration from Soaring Stones # 4 and other art pieces on the campus for his composition " Sculpture Garden for Piano Quintet " , a piano quintet commissioned for the opening concert of the 2009 Walla Walla Chamber Music Festival . Glenn based his work on a September 2008 walk through the campus ; he used Young 's sculpture as inspiration for the quintet 's final movement . He said of the sculpture 's influence : 
 Since there are six boulders used in the sculpture , I based this movement in the time signature of 6 / 4 , with a sub @-@ division of four and two ( four on pedestals ; two on ground ) . I also used a six @-@ note melodic theme that rises six times , descends six times and then rises again six times . The rising and falling represent different perspectives the viewer of the sculpture can have â either looking from right to left or left to right .

 Born and raised in Lafayette , Indiana , Rose moved to Los Angeles in the early 1980s , where he became active in the local hard rock scene and joined several bands , including Hollywood Rose and L.A. Guns . In 1985 , he co @-@ founded Guns N ' Roses , with whom he had great success and recognition in the late 1980s and early 1990s .

 Axl Rose was born William Bruce Rose , Jr. in Lafayette , Indiana , the oldest child of Sharon E. ( nÃ©e Lintner ) , then 16 years old and still in high school , and William Bruce Rose , then 20 years old . His father has been described as " a troubled and charismatic local delinquent , " and the pregnancy was unplanned . His parents separated when Rose was approximately two years old , prompting his father to abduct and allegedly molest him before disappearing from Lafayette . His mother remarried to Stephen L. Bailey , and changed her son 's name to William Bruce Bailey . He has two younger siblings â a sister , Amy , and a half @-@ brother , Stuart . Until the age of 17 , Rose believed that Bailey was his natural father . He never met his biological father as an adult ; William Rose , Sr. was murdered in Marion , Illinois , in 1984 by a criminal acquaintance who was convicted even though the body was never recovered . Rose did not learn about the murder until years later . 
 The Bailey household was very religious ; Rose and his family attended a Pentecostal church , where he was required to attend services three to eight times per week and even taught Sunday school . Rose later recalled an oppressive upbringing , stating , " We 'd have televisions one week , then my <unk> would throw them out because they were Satanic . I wasn 't allowed to listen to music . Women were evil . Everything was evil . " He accused his stepfather of physically abusing him and his siblings and sexually abusing his sister . Rose found solace in music from an early age . He sang in the church choir from the age of five , and performed at services with his brother and sister under the name the Bailey Trio . At Jefferson High School , he participated in the school chorus and studied piano . A second baritone , Rose began developing " different voices " during chorus practice to confuse his teacher . He eventually formed a band with his friends , one of whom was Jeff Isbell , later known as Izzy Stradlin . 
 At the age of 17 , while going through insurance papers in his parents ' home , Rose learned of his biological father 's existence , and he unofficially readopted his birth name . However , he referred to himself only as W. Rose , because he did not want to share a first name with his biological father . Following the discovery of his true family origins , Rose became the local juvenile delinquent in Lafayette ; he was arrested more than 20 times on charges such as public intoxication and battery , and served jail terms up to three months . After Lafayette authorities threatened to charge him as a habitual criminal , Rose moved to Los Angeles , California , in December 1982 . After moving to Los Angeles , he became so engrossed in his band <unk> that his friends suggested he call himself Axl Rose ; he legally changed his name to W. Axl Rose prior to signing his contract with Geffen Records in March 1986 .
