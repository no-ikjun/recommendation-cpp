 With 35 shotgun pellets still in his body , including three in the lining of his heart and five more embedded in his liver , LeMond attempted to return to racing in 1988 . His comeback was hampered by over @-@ training which resulted in tendonitis in his right shin requiring surgery . He missed the Tour for the second year running . Tensions in the relationship between LeMond and PDM were aggravated when LeMond discovered that doping was going on at the PDM squad . The result was that LeMond moved from PDM , one of the strongest teams in the peloton , to ADR , a team based in Belgium . The team was co @-@ sponsored by Coors Light for American races . The deal was completed on New Year 's Eve , just hours before LeMond would have been legally obligated to ride another season for the Dutch team . Joining the Belgian ADR squad allowed LeMond to continue to compete , but with teammates like Johan <unk> who were better suited to riding Classics than Grand Tours . 
 = = = 1989 : Return to elite level = = = 
 After struggling in the 1989 Paris – Nice early @-@ season race and failing to improve his condition , LeMond informed his wife Kathy that he intended to retire from professional cycling after the 1989 Tour de France . He had some flashes of form in the two @-@ day Critérium International , sharing an escape with Fignon , Indurain , <unk> , Roche and Madiot and finishing 5th overall . He started the 1989 Giro d 'Italia in May as preparation for the Tour to follow , but struggled in the mountains and was not in contention for any of the leaders ' jerseys before the final 53 km ( 33 mi ) individual time trial into Florence . LeMond placed a <unk> second there , more than a minute ahead of overall winner Laurent Fignon . Some of his improvement he attributed to an anti @-@ anemia treatment he received twice during the race . 
 Coming into the 1989 Tour de France LeMond was not considered a contender for the general classification ( GC ) . His own most optimistic hope was to finish his final Tour in the top 20 . Without the weight of expectation and other pressures of being a Tour favorite , LeMond surprised observers with a strong ride in the 7 @.@ 8 km ( 4 @.@ 8 mi ) prologue in Luxembourg , finishing fourth out of 198 riders . Buoyed by the result , LeMond continued to ride well over the opening flat stages , winning the 73 km ( 45 mi ) stage 5 individual time trial , and gaining the yellow jersey of race leader for the first time in three years . LeMond seemed to ride himself into better condition during the first week 's flat stages , and he was coming into peak form by the time the Tour reached the mountains . LeMond remained at the front of the race in the Pyrénées , but lost the lead to his former teammate and rival Laurent Fignon on stage 10 in <unk> . Five days later LeMond reclaimed yellow in the Alps , after the 39 km ( 24 mi ) stage 15 mountain time trial from Gap to <unk> @-@ <unk> . The see @-@ saw battle continued , and when Fignon attacked on the upper slopes of Alpe d 'Huez LeMond was unable to go with him , placing the yellow jersey back on the shoulders of Fignon . Fignon held a 50 @-@ second advantage over LeMond going into the 21st and final stage , a rare 24 @.@ 5 km ( 15 @.@ 2 mi ) individual time trial from Versailles to the Champs @-@ Élysées in Paris . 
 Fignon had won the Tour twice before , in 1983 and 1984 , and was a very capable time trialist . It seemed improbable that LeMond could take 50 seconds off Fignon over the short course . This would require LeMond to gain two seconds per kilometer against one of the fastest chrono @-@ specialists in the world . LeMond had done wind tunnel testing in the off season and perfected his riding position . He rode the time trial with a rear disc wheel , a cut @-@ down Giro aero helmet and the same Scott clip @-@ on aero bars which had helped him to the Stage 5 time trial win . Holding his time trialing position LeMond was able to generate less aerodynamic drag than Fignon , who used a pair of disc wheels but chose to go <unk> and did not use the aero bars that are now commonplace in time trials . <unk> his support car not to give him his split times , LeMond rode flat @-@ out and finished at a record pace to beat Fignon by 8 seconds and claim his second Tour de France victory . As LeMond embraced his wife and rejoiced on the Champs @-@ Élysées , Fignon collapsed onto the tarmac , then sat in shock and wept . 
 The final margin of victory of eight seconds was the closest in the Tour 's history . LeMond 's 54 @.@ 545 km / h ( 33 @.@ 893 mph ) average speed for the stage 21 time trial was , at that time , the fastest in Tour history . Since then the 1994 and 2015 prologues and David Zabriskie 's 2005 time trial performance have been faster . The press immediately labeled LeMond 's come @-@ from @-@ behind triumph as , " the most astonishing victory in Tour de France history , " and while LeMond admitted that it felt almost " too good to be true , " he personally rated it as " much more satisfying " than his first overall Tour win in 1986 . 
 LeMond 's return to the pinnacle of cycling was confirmed on August 27 , when he won the 259 km ( 161 mi ) World Championships road race in Chambéry , France , defeating Fignon again and edging Dimitri Konyshev and Sean Kelly on the line . Fignon attacked repeatedly on the wet , treacherous final climb , but LeMond and a select group caught his rival and then LeMond made the perfect sprint to take the title . Fignon finished 6th . LeMond was only the fifth person in history to win both the Tour de France and the World Championship in the same year . In December , Sports Illustrated magazine named LeMond its 1989 " Sportsman of the Year " , the first time a cyclist received the honor . 
 = = = 1990 : A third tour win = = = 
 LeMond parlayed the success of his 1989 season into the then @-@ richest contract in the sport 's history , signing a $ 5 @.@ 5 million deal for three years with Z @-@ <unk> of France . He entered the 1990 Tour de France as defending champion and a pre @-@ race favorite after leaving ADR to join the much stronger Z @-@ <unk> team . At " Z " his team mates included Robert Millar , Eric Boyer and Ronan Pensec , all of whom already had finishes in the top six of the Tour de France . This unified roster of strong riders appeared capable of supporting LeMond in the mountains and controlling the race on the flats . 
 The squad 's tactical plan was upset on the first day , when a breakaway that included LeMond 's teammate Ronan Pensec , but no major favorites , arrived ten minutes ahead of the field . LeMond was prevented from challenging for the lead until the yellow jersey left the shoulders of teammate Ronan Pensec . LeMond closed in on race leader Claudio Chiappucci , finally overtaking him in the final individual time trial on stage 20 , where he finished over two minutes ahead of the unheralded Italian . LeMond at last had the yellow jersey , wearing it the following day as the Tour rode into Paris . LeMond had the distinction of winning the 1990 Tour without taking any of the individual stages . He remains the last rider to win the Tour while wearing the world champion jersey . Over the course of the 1990 Tour the perceived strength of the Z team was confirmed , as they led the team classification through most of the race , adding the team title to LeMond 's yellow jersey . 
 In September , LeMond attempted to defend his title at the 1990 UCI Road World Championships , but finished fourth , eight seconds behind the winner , his former teammate Rudy <unk> of Belgium . 
 = = = 1991 – 1994 : Change in the peloton and retirement = = = 
 LeMond felt confident before the 1991 Tour de France . He was the defending champion , trained well and had a solid team to support him . LeMond was among the leaders going into the Stage 8 individual time trial , and he finished second to the Spaniard Miguel Indurain . LeMond felt he was riding extremely well , and though his TT @-@ effort had propelled him into the yellow jersey , losing eight seconds to Indurain shook his confidence . He held the yellow jersey for the next four days until Stage 12 , a challenging 192 km ( 119 mi ) mountain stage . LeMond experienced difficulty on the first climb and he cracked on the Col de Tourmalet , losing significant time to Claudio Chiappucci , and eventual winner Indurain . He continued to race , but was unable to seriously challenge for the lead thereafter , finishing the 1991 Tour seventh overall . 
 In 1992 , LeMond won the Tour DuPont . It would be the last major win of his career . In the 1992 Tour de France he quit the race in the mountains , on the same day that his compatriot and former domestique Andy Hampsten won atop Alpe d 'Huez . While LeMond claimed a serious saddle sore caused him to abandon , he had earlier stated , " My climbing is not like usual . I 've climbed much better in the past Tours . This year I 'm just not feeling my usual self . " 
 LeMond did extensive endurance training on the road the following winter , but his performances the following spring failed to improve . LeMond had to abandon the 1993 Giro d 'Italia two days before the final stage after difficult racing left him third @-@ from @-@ last on GC . He was too exhausted to enter the 1993 Tour de France . Following the 1993 season LeMond hired renowned Dutch physiologist <unk> van Diemen to advise him on a new technique to monitor training and measure performance . The ( SRM ) power @-@ based training would make use of the watt as a guide to power output . In November 1993 LeMond confided to Sam Abt that power output in watts would become the key metric . The watt has gained wide acceptance as the best measure of a cyclist 's training performance . 
 The following year LeMond began the 1994 Tour de France but found he was unable to race effectively . He had to abandon after the first week before the race had reached the difficult mountain stages . That December he announced his retirement . At the time the reasons for LeMond 's increasing difficulties were not entirely known . At a loss , he speculated that a condition known as mitochondrial myopathy might be responsible for the difficulty he was having performing against the current riders . In 2007 , however , LeMond speculated that he might not have had the condition after all , and suggested that lead toxicity from the shotgun pellets still embedded in his body might have been responsible , the effects of which were increased by heavy training . 
 Since 2010 LeMond acknowledged that the increasing prevalence of doping contributed to his lack of competitiveness . Said LeMond : " Something had changed in cycling . The speeds were faster and riders that I had easily out performed were now dropping me . At the time , the team I was on , Team Z , became more and more demanding , more and more concerned ... " He stated he had been told in 1994 that he would need to blood dope in order to win again . LeMond did not focus solely on doping for his difficulties . He frankly admitted to Abt in 1999 : " I figure I had three months that went right for me after the hunting accident , " three months in which he won the two Tours and a world road race championship . " The rest were just pure suffering , struggling , fatigue , always tired . " 
 In a wide @-@ ranging interview with American novelist Bryan <unk> in 1998 , LeMond was asked if his career had not been interrupted by the hunting accident , how did he feel he would compare to five time Tour winners such as Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain . LeMond responded : " Of course you can 't rewrite racing history , but I 'm confident that I would have won five Tours . " 
 Two years after his retirement LeMond was inducted into the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame in a ceremony at Rodale Park in <unk> , Pennsylvania . The event was held on June 8 , 1996 , during the U.S. Olympic Cycling Team Trials . 
 In July 2014 , ESPN announced the premiere of a new 30 for 30 film titled Slaying the Badger which centers on LeMond and his former teammate Hinault at the 1986 Tour de France . The film is based on the book of the same name by Richard Moore and premiered July 22 , 2014 on ESPN . 
 = = Business interests = = 
 Greg LeMond was a pioneer in the use of carbon fiber bicycle frames in European professional road cycling , and his Tour de France win in 1986 ahead of Bernard Hinault was the first for a carbon @-@ framed bicycle . Ironically , given the rivalry that existed at the time between the American and his French teammate , LeMond rode a " Bernard Hinault " Signature Model Look prototype that year . LeMond also won the 1989 Tour de France , the 1989 World Championship , and his final Tour de France in 1990 on carbon fiber frames . These bicycle frames featured " Greg LeMond " branding . 
 = = = LeMond Cycles = = = 
 In 1990 , LeMond founded LeMond Bicycles to develop machines for himself that would also be marketed and sold to the public . The following year , searching for an equipment edge for Team Z at the 1991 Tour de France , LeMond concluded an exclusive licensing agreement between his company and Carbonframes , Inc . , to access the latter 's advanced composites technology . While LeMond briefly led the 1991 Tour overall , riding his Carbonframes @-@ produced " Greg LeMond " bicycle , the company eventually faltered , something LeMond blamed on " under @-@ capitalization " and poor management by his father . Carbonframes and LeMond Cycles " parted amiably two years later . " In 1995 , with his company allegedly nearly bankrupt , LeMond reached a licensing @-@ agreement with Trek Bicycle Corporation , according to which the Wisconsin @-@ based company would manufacture and distribute bicycles designed with LeMond that would be sold under the " LeMond Bicycles " brand . LeMond would later claim that going into business with Trek " destroyed " his relationship with his father . The lucrative partnership , which generated revenue for Trek in excess of $ 100 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 USD , would be renewed several times over the course of 13 years , but it ultimately ended in acrimony after LeMond 's relationship with Trek deteriorated over his staunch anti @-@ doping advocacy . 
 The two parties first found themselves at odds in July 2001 , after LeMond expressed public concern over the relationship between Italian doping doctor Michele Ferrari and Trek 's star athlete , Lance Armstrong . " When I heard he was working with Michele Ferrari , I was devastated , " LeMond was quoted as saying of Armstrong . " If Lance is clean , it is the greatest comeback in the history of sports . If he isn 't , it would be the greatest fraud . " 
 Trek 's president John Burke pressured LeMond to apologize , claiming , " Greg 's public comments hurt the LeMond brand and the Trek brand . " Burke allegedly justified his demand for an apology by advising that , " As a contractual partner , he [ LeMond ] could criticize doping only generally – not point his finger at specific athletes , particularly one that happens to be the company 's main cash cow . " 
 In April 2008 , Trek announced that it was dropping LeMond Bicycles from its product line and would sue to sever the licensing agreement . It quickly emerged that in March 2008 , LeMond had filed a complaint against Trek for breach of contract , claiming that they had not made a " best efforts " attempt to sell his bicycles , as well as describing attempts to ' silence ' him about doping , including incidents in 2001 and 2004 . His complaint included statistics detailing slow sales in some markets , including the fact that between September 2001 and June 2007 , Trek only sold $ 10 @,@ 393 worth of LeMond bikes in France , a country in which LeMond was both famous and popular . 
 As promised , Trek counter @-@ sued and stopped producing bicycles under the LeMond brand . After nearly two years of litigation , in February 2010 , LeMond reached an out @-@ of @-@ court settlement with Trek in their breach @-@ of @-@ contract dispute , the terms of which were confidential . The settlement permitted the case to be dismissed with prejudice , meaning , " neither side can produce the same claims against one another in a future lawsuit . " And although settlement terms were not disclosed , LeMond reportedly obtained full control over the LeMond Bicycles name , while Trek made a donation of $ 200 @,@ 000 USD to the charity <unk> , of which LeMond was a founding member of the board of directors .

 In 2002 , LeMond , Bernie <unk> and others founded LeMond Fitness , Inc . " to help individuals achieve their fitness and performance goals and train more effectively . " The company 's primary business is the development and manufacture of bicycle trainers and indoor exercise bikes for consumers in the United States and internationally . LeMond himself serves as Chairman of the Board , and , according to company sources , " is integrally involved in the development and design of our products and programs . " In 2012 , Hoist Fitness negotiated to purchase an interest in the company and announced plans to move its headquarters to Hoist 's offices in San Diego , CA . In late 2012 , Greg LeMond purchased the LeMond Revolution from Hoist , relaunching with a new management team in Minneapolis . He also formed LeMond LLC to introduce a suite of brands in late 2013 , early 2014 . Professional cycling 's Garmin @-@ Sharp team recently renewed its sponsorship with LeMond to use its Revolution trainers for another three seasons . The team has won several stages of the Tour de France , plus the general classification of the 2012 Giro d 'Italia .

 At the <unk> trade show in September 2013 LeMond announced that he was returning to the business of bicycle manufacture and sales by partnering with French company Time .

LeMond purchased Time Sport USA , the US distributor for the company . He will be responsible for US distribution of the company 's line of frames , bikes , and components . Said LeMond : " I 'm really excited to be back in the bike industry . "

 In 2002 LeMond joined with his parents @-@ in @-@ law David and <unk> Morris , friend Michael Snow and J.P. Morgan & Co. fund manager Jorge <unk> to invest in the exclusive Yellowstone Club , a Big Sky , Montana private ski and golf community founded by timber baron Tim Blixseth and his wife <unk> . Each of the five partners paid Blixseth $ 750 @,@ 000 for one percent shares in the exclusive resort . LeMond also purchased several building lots and maintained a property at the resort . Four years later LeMond and partners sued Blixseth in 2006 following reports of a Credit Suisse loan to the resort of $ 375 million from which Blixseth reportedly took $ 209 million in a disputed partial payout for his ownership stake . The Credit Suisse loan was based on a $ 1 @.@ 16 billion Cushman & Wakefield valuation of the resort , for which LeMond and partners each sought $ 11 @.@ 6 million for their one @-@ percent shares . In 2007 , LeMond settled his suit with the Blixseths for $ 39 million ; however , he and his partners remained creditors as the Blixseths defaulted on a $ 20 million payment ( after having already paid the group $ 18 million ) , followed by their divorce and the bankruptcy of the Club in 2009 . 
 = = = Restaurants = = = 
 LeMond became a restaurateur in August 1990 , when , in partnership with his wife and her parents , he opened Scott Kee 's Tour de France on France Avenue in the Minneapolis suburb of Edina , Minnesota . LeMond described the restaurant , which was named for its chef ( LeMond 's brother @-@ in @-@ law ) , as " a dream of five years come true . " Explaining the origin of the concept , LeMond said , " Kathy and I have eaten at the finest establishments in France , Italy and Belgium . Our favorites have always been small places , family @-@ owned . " LeMond also partnered in several Bruegger 's bagel bakery @-@ café franchises .

 In 2014 , LeMond joined Eurosport as a pundit for the channel 's cycling coverage , providing analysis at Paris – Roubaix , the Giro d 'Italia and the Tour de France , and hosting his own monthly programme LeMond of Cycling . 
 = = Anti @-@ doping stance and controversies = = 
 LeMond is a longtime vocal opponent of performance @-@ enhancing drug use . He first spoke on @-@ record against doping in cycling after winning the 1989 Tour de France . LeMond received intense criticism in 2001 when he publicly expressed doubts about the legitimacy of Lance Armstrong 's Tour success after learning of his relationship with Dr. Michele Ferrari . His outspokenness placed him in the center of the anti @-@ doping controversy . 
 LeMond has consistently questioned the relationship between riders and unethical sports doctors like Ferrari , and has pointed out that doping products ultimately <unk> the professional cyclists who make use of them . Said LeMond : " When I speak out about doping people could translate it and think it was about the riders . Actually I feel like I am an advocate for the riders . I look at them as being treated like lab rats that are test vehicles for the doctors . The doctors , the management , the officials , they 're the ones that have corrupted riders . The riders are the only ones that pay the price . " 
 LeMond 's most notable conflicts have been with fellow Tour riders Lance Armstrong and Floyd Landis . He has also been critical of Alberto Contador , the UCI , and its former president , Pat McQuaid . In December 2012 , LeMond claimed that a change needed to be made at the head of leadership for the UCI , and stated if called upon he would be willing to take the position himself if necessary to lead cycling out of the mire of doping . Said LeMond : " It is now or never to act . After the earthquake caused by the Armstrong case another chance will not arise . I am willing to invest to make this institution more democratic , transparent and look for the best candidate in the longer term . " 
 McQuaid rejected LeMond 's call for new leadership and was dismissive of LeMond . " Ultimately McQuaid was defeated in his bid for a third term by British Cycling president Brian Cookson at the September 2013 UCI Congress in Florence , Italy . <unk> had supported Cookson in the UCI Presidential battle . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 LeMond grew up living an active , outdoor life . Hiking , hunting , skiing and <unk> were boyhood pastimes . The ranch country of the Sierra Nevada mountain range lent itself to such pursuits . A hyperactive youngster , LeMond believes these outdoor activities helped keep him out of trouble . " I was a boy who just could not sit still . I had trouble focusing in school . Parents and educators then did not have the skill set to diagnose and cope with what we know now was a classic case of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) . ADHD certainly was not the frequently medicated childhood disease it is today . My triumph over the symptoms was found atop two thin tires over many dusty miles . " Said LeMond : " That 's one of the traits . It 's the inability to sit down [ and listen ] to something you are not really interested in and absorb it . If they are interested in it , people with ADD excel in really good ways . When I got into cycling I would say the sport itself took a fog off my brain . I was able to absorb stuff I read . It changed my life . " 
 LeMond is married to his wife Kathy ( previously Kathy Morris ) and together they have three children : sons Geoffrey and Scott , and daughter Simone . LeMond and his wife live in Medina , Minnesota . Since his retirement , LeMond has become increasingly involved in philanthropic efforts relating to causes that have affected him personally ( including ADHD and sexual abuse ) , and he and Kathy both sit on the board of the non @-@ profit <unk> . 
 LeMond is an avid outdoor enthusiast and fly angler , and in 1991 – while still racing full @-@ time – he made the world @-@ record fly fishing catch of a four @-@ pound smallmouth bass on a reel with a four @-@ pound <unk> . The record was certified by the National Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame in Hayward , Wisconsin . The catch exceeded the then @-@ previous record of three pounds , six ounces made on the same size <unk> back in 1986 . LeMond confessed , " I always pack my fly fishing equipment when I travel to bike events . I fish every chance I get . " 
 After retiring from pro cycling , LeMond competed in Formula Ford 2000 series auto racing . He is also a motivational speaker and was the guest speaker for Sumitomo Drive Technologies ' International Sales Meeting in Cancun , Mexico on May 2 , 2008 . LeMond narrated an award @-@ winning documentary for Adventures for the Cure that same year . 
 On July 16 , 2007 , LeMond rode the L <unk> du Tour <unk> with his son , and found it to be a defining moment in his post @-@ competition life . " I had the time of my life " , he said , despite getting " 650th place " and being " impressed that I even finished " . LeMond continued , " I decided that day that nobody 's going to keep me from cycling , not Trek , not Armstrong , not Verbruggen , not anybody . " At the time , LeMond was alluding to a series of public and private disputes related to his anti @-@ doping advocacy that hampered his enjoyment of cycling . Especially significant was LeMond 's appearance as a USADA witness in the Floyd Landis doping case . There , on the eve of LeMond 's testimony in May 2007 , Landis ' business manager called and threatened to disclose publicly that LeMond was the victim of childhood sexual abuse , should he appear in court as scheduled the following day . Undeterred , LeMond took the stand and testified , before admitting to the world that he had been molested . 
 Several weeks later , LeMond and his wife Kathy gave an extensive interview to Paul <unk> of The Sunday Times . LeMond provided additional details concerning the circumstances of his 2001 apology to Armstrong , stating that Trek , the longtime manufacturer and distributor of LeMond Racing Cycles , had threatened to end the relationship at the behest of Armstrong . He described the two years following the forced apology as the worst in his life , marked by self @-@ destructive behavior that ultimately led him to disclose his sexual abuse to his wife and seek help . LeMond also described how being a victim of molestation had impacted both his racing career and his life since . 
 In September 2007 , Greg LeMond became a founding board member of the non @-@ profit organization <unk> , whose mission is " to help men who have had unwanted or abusive sexual experiences in childhood live healthy , happy lives " . 
 LeMond was in a car crash on the morning of January 30 , 2013 . He was driving through wintery and icy conditions to his dentist in Wayzata , Minnesota , when he lost control of his car . LeMond suffered a concussion and was left with no memory of the incident . According to Associated Press , a Plymouth police report says LeMond left the road , hit a fence and shrubs , and then hit an embankment before ending up in the backyard of a home . LeMond may have lost consciousness before the accident , according to his wife Kathy , and he suffered a compression fracture in his back and would have to wear a brace for three months . The accident curtailed LeMond 's public appearances in the first half of 2013 , but he made a full recovery .

 " The Purple Piano Project " is the premiere episode of the third season of the American musical television series Glee , and the forty @-@ fifth overall . The episode was written by series co @-@ creator Brad Falchuk , directed by Eric Stoltz , and first aired on September 20 , 2011 on Fox in the United States . It features the start of a new school year at McKinley High , and for its glee club , New Directions . Members of the club have left , and a recruitment drive is launched to bring the numbers back up . Blaine Anderson ( Darren Criss ) , Kurt Hummel 's ( Chris Colfer ) boyfriend , transfers from Dalton Academy to McKinley High , and Mercedes Jones gets a new boyfriend . Sue Sylvester is running for Congress . 
 The episode received mixed @-@ to @-@ positive reviews , with favorable notice being taken of the renewed focus on the core characters , though there was a lack of overall enthusiasm from several reviewers . The subplot with Kurt and Rachel Berry ( Lea Michele ) , and its introduction of Harmony ( Lindsay Pearce ) , garnered praise for all three performers . The musical performances were generally well @-@ received , and the " Anything Goes " / " Anything You Can Do " mash @-@ up featuring Pearce was widely acclaimed . Five covers were released as singles , three of which charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Canadian Hot 100 . Upon its initial airing , this episode was viewed by 9 @.@ 21 million American viewers and garnered a 4 @.@ 0 / 11 Nielsen rating / share in the 18 – 49 age group . The total viewership and ratings for this episode were down significantly from the previous episode , " New York " .

 It is a new year at McKinley High . New Directions glee club director Will Schuester ( Matthew Morrison ) and guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury ( Jayma Mays ) are now sharing an apartment and a bed . Sue Sylvester ( Jane Lynch ) , coach of the Cheerios cheerleading squad , is running for Congress but doing badly in the polls . Glee club member Mike Chang ( Harry Shum , Jr . ) is now a senior , while fellow members Tina Cohen @-@ Chang ( Jenna Ushkowitz ) and Artie Abrams ( Kevin McHale ) are juniors . Club co @-@ captain Finn Hudson ( Cory Monteith ) , a senior , has no idea what to do about his future . Mercedes Jones ( Amber Riley ) has a new boyfriend ( LaMarcus Tinker ) ; her former boyfriend Sam Evans ( Chord Overstreet ) moved to another state . Three New Directions members have left : Sam , Lauren Zizes ( Ashley Fink ) , who also broke up with Puck ( Mark Salling ) , and Sam 's ex @-@ girlfriend Quinn Fabray ( Dianna Agron ) , who has completely reinvented herself with pink hair , a nose ring and a tattoo ; she has taken up smoking , and has made friends with a group of outcast girls called the <unk> . She refuses to rejoin either the Cheerios or New Directions . 
 To recruit new talent , Will places several purple pianos around the school and encourages the club to sing whenever they see one . When Mike and Tina play on one in a hallway , Sue interrupts them by snapping the piano strings with wire cutters , and is praised for doing so by an arts @-@ hating teacher ( Barbara Tarbuck ) , who promises to vote for her . An inspired Sue goes on television and vows that , if elected , she will cut all funding for school arts programs until all students read at or above grade level . She makes Santana Lopez ( Naya Rivera ) and Becky Jackson ( Lauren Potter ) cheerleading co @-@ captains , to their mutual disgust , and gets their pledge to help her sabotage the glee club . After New Directions performs " We Got the Beat " in the cafeteria , Becky starts a food fight that targets the club . Following lunch , Sugar Motta ( Vanessa Lengies ) auditions , but cannot sing in tune . An agonized Will eventually rejects Sugar , but gains a new recruit when Kurt Hummel ( Chris Colfer ) convinces his boyfriend Blaine Anderson ( Darren Criss ) to transfer from Dalton Academy . 
 Kurt and Rachel see Emma about their plans to attend college in New York City . She suggests they consider a top school for the dramatic arts there , and the two of them attend an Ohio " mixer " for students interested in applying . They have rehearsed " Ding @-@ Dong ! The Witch Is Dead " , and expect to overawe the other attendees with the performance , but are instead intimidated by their performance of an " Anything Goes " and " Anything You Can Do " mash @-@ up led by Harmony ( Lindsay Pearce ) . Although badly shaken , they vow to persevere . 
 Blaine sings " It 's Not Unusual " to a large crowd in the school courtyard while a growing number of Cheerios , directed by Santana , join in as back @-@ up dancers . As the number is ending , the Cheerios circle the purple piano , and they each sprinkle it with lighter fluid . Quinn flicks her lit cigarette onto the piano , and it bursts into flames . Will tells Santana that because of her sabotage she is banned from New Directions . Rachel breaks up the resulting pity party by singing the opening to " You Can 't Stop the Beat " , and they all perform the song in the auditorium , while Quinn secretly watches from above .

 The first day of filming for the episode was August 9 , 2011 , though some cast members were called the day before to begin recording musical numbers . Murphy realized that The Glee Project runner @-@ up Lindsay Pearce would be ideal for an already @-@ written role in the episode , but the filming needed to take place before the project 's finale was broadcast on August 21 , 2011 , upon which it would be revealed that she had won a two @-@ episode prize . They " kept delaying " the shoot , and " snuck [ her ] into a soundstage to make sure no one recognized her . " In aid of this secrecy , her name was omitted from the Fox press release for the episode . Once Murphy had cast Pearce , he made the musical number she was to appear in bigger . According to Lea Michele , the filming of the first episode ended on August 19 , 2011 .

Effective with this episode , former recurring guest stars Harry Shum , Jr. as Mike Chang and Darren Criss as Blaine Anderson join the main cast , while Jessalyn Gilsig and Mike O 'Malley , who play Will 's wife Terri Schuester and Kurt 's father Burt Hummel respectively , are no longer given starring credits . Gilsig was in the main cast for the first two seasons , and her change had been previously reported . O 'Malley 's had not , but he is listed in the Fox press release for the second episode as being a guest star , his credit in the first season . Barbara Tarbuck guest starred as Nancy <unk> , a geometry teacher at McKinley . 
 At the 2011 San Diego Comic @-@ Con International on July 24 , 2011 , series creator Brad Falchuk said that in the first episode of the third season , " The opening sequence is everybody saying what they want to do when they grow up , so you see everyone 's anxieties . " He also stated , " Come the first episode back , you see who the seniors and juniors are . " 
 The episode features seven musical cover versions . Two are in the form of a mash @-@ up of " Anything Goes " from the Cole Porter musical Anything Goes and " Anything You Can Do " from Irving Berlin 's Annie Get Your Gun , with the lead sung by Pearce .

 Twitter was also used to advertise the show . To highlight the beginning of the third season and its move to a new channel , Sky was the first company to use Twitter 's geographically targeted ad capability in the UK with a " promoted trend " that was displayed on September 22 , 2011 , the day that Glee debuted on Sky1 . 
 = = = Critical response = = = 
 " The Purple Piano Project " was given mixed to positive reviews by critics . Jenna Mullins of E ! Online called it " a perfect season @-@ starter of an episode " . The Atlantic 's Kevin Fallon appreciated that it tackled some of the show 's biggest problems , such as the surfeit of central characters and their previously un @-@ addressed ages . He was particularly pleased that the episode focussed on typical high school life , rather than the adult characters or more serious issues . Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle approved of the " clear trajectory " set out for the characters , and noted that he looked forward to seeing their various storylines develop . Though AOLTV 's Crystal Bell worried that <unk> the teenagers ' ages could result in the younger characters being overlooked in future episodes , she was glad that the premiere saw the show return to its roots : " underdogs , show tunes and Sue Sylvester " . A similar sentiment was expressed by Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times , who was hopeful that renewed focus on the core characters would lead to " a great year " . The Huffington Post 's Amy Lee observed that " Glee has a tendency to oscillate between sappy and nasty , sometimes without any warning " , and then noted that " The Purple Piano Project " was more tonally balanced than the majority of the second season . Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times deemed the episode " admirably straightforward " , <unk> by the sentimentality and inconsistencies which plagued previous episodes . His praised was tempered , however , and he wrote , " I wouldn 't go so far as to call the episode good , it was oddly lifeless and the stakes seemed almost nonexistent at times . It has the feel of a show rediscovering itself , but , all things considered , Ryan Murphy and Co. handled the task relatively well . " 
 James Poniewozik of Time took a more negative stance . He wrote that " The Purple Piano Project " " was not a particularly good episode of Glee " , one which was hindered by the vast number of central characters , " but it did at least suggest where the third season of the show could find its strong core stories , and also ... the numerous ways in which it could get sidetracked into tangential ridiculousness . " The A.V. Club 's Todd VanDerWerff graded the episode " D + " . He summarised it as " a handful of okay performances , one or two pretty good lines , and then a whole bunch of awful " . Rolling Stone 's Erica Futterman praised the episode 's humor and plot development , but commented that it " didn 't hit any of the emotional notes Glee is capable of . " Robert Canning of IGN rated it an " okay " 6 @.@ 5 out of 10 . He too found " there were still quite a few laughs to be had " , but felt the episode suffered from its repetitiveness , as Sue 's hatred of the glee club and New Directions ' recruitment problems have been thoroughly explored before . The Dallas Morning News 's Samantha Urban noted that Murphy failed to deliver on his promise to increase Mercedes and Tina 's roles , and couldn 't accept that Sue would be allowed to promote her congressional campaign on her local news commentary spot , but overall was " pretty impressed " with what she called " a solid episode of Glee that made [ her ] feel cautiously optimistic about the season ahead . " Lisa Respers France of CNN summed up the episode in a single word : " Meh . " 
 The plot which involved Rachel and Kurt attracted uniformly favorable reviews . Fallon called it " one of the episode 's strongest subplots " , and Salon.com 's Matt Zoller Seitz deemed it the episode 's " most successful and affecting . " Bell named Rachel and Kurt as her favorite Glee pairing , and Futterman wrote that their " friendship has grown from something catty into something genuine and relatable and their interactions are likely the most authentic for any aspiring musical theater performers among Glee 's viewers . " Within his generally negative review of the episode , VanDerWerff noted that the NYADA mixer scene " features some of the best work Chris Colfer and Lea Michele have contributed to the show . " In contrast , the adult storylines were generally poorly received . Zoller Seitz branded Will and Emma 's relationship boring , and Abby West of Entertainment Weekly disliked the fact the season began with them in an established relationship : " I feel like I missed a huge leap for Emma and we need to have it acknowledged . " Fallon disparaged Will as being " insufferable " , and attributed this to " Morrison 's wooden characterization , the stilted writing [ and ] the flat purpose that the character serves on the show " . Sue 's storyline was described as nonsensical by VanDerWerff , who wrote that she " has decided to take her crusade against the glee club to a congressional district @-@ wide audience , because , well , she was the most popular character in season one , and she will be again , via blunt force , if necessary . " Reiter , however , found Sue to be " in perfect form in this episode , neither too mean nor too misty " , and enjoyed her storyline . 
 The introduction of Harmony and Sugar garnered critical praise . VanDerWerff wrote that the former " may be the best new character ever " , TVLine 's Michael Slezak said she was " brillantly brought to life " by Pearce , and Fallon felt that her arrival boded well for the introductions of the other finalists from The Glee Project . He said that " she brought , which the best new characters do , fresh and exciting aspects in the show 's established leads . Zoller Seitz described Sugar as " an entitled little snot " , but a " great character " nonetheless , and one he hoped to see more of . West praised Lengies ' performance and opined that with Sue otherwise occupied , " it 'll be great to have another person as a thorn in the Glee club 's side . " Not everyone was thrilled with Sugar 's advent , however ; VanDerWerff called the character " awful " . 
 = = = Music and performances = = = 
 The episode 's musical numbers were generally well received . Hankinson appreciated that they " felt to proper scale " , with a realism which the previous season 's " over @-@ the @-@ top " performances lacked . Though Benigno criticized the song selection for being too focused on Broadway tracks , which he felt limited its appeal for younger viewers , Urban called the choices " outstanding " and VanDerWerff commented that the wide range represented progress from season two . He noted that there were no performances he disliked , but found some " shockingly poorly motivated for dramatic purposes " . Canning enjoyed the songs both vocally and visually : " Everything was upbeat , familiar and fun . The dancing was entertaining and most of the performances were group numbers , which added plenty of visual flair . " 
 " We Got the Beat " garnered praise for Brittany and Mike 's dancing from Lee , though she described the vocals as <unk> , a comment echoed by Futterman , who was nevertheless glad that Brittany and Rachel " match [ ed ] the rawness of Santana 's voice " . Slezak and Benigno were pleased that Morris and Rivera received lead vocals , but while the former commended the number as a great musical start to the season and awarded it an " A " grade , the latter found it hard to differentiate between the Glee cover and the original , observed that it failed to advance the plot , and graded it " C " . Respers France was entirely unimpressed with the routine . For her , Sugar 's scene following it was one of the episode 's few highlights , although she described Sugar as having " a horrible voice " . 
 Rachel and Kurt 's duet of " Ding @-@ Dong ! The Witch Is Dead " made Billboard 's Rae Votta long for them to share more material . It encapsulated everything Futterman wanted in a duet between the two ; she observed " it 's effortless , charming , full of power musical theater vocals and Rachel gets to channel Barbra Streisand " . Lee , however , felt the number was an odd choice to demonstrate their talent , and although Slezak graded it a " B " , he contrasted it negatively with their previous duets . West opined that the song was too insubstantial and gave it a " B – " . Its highest grade , an " A – " , came from Benigno . He noted its lack of significance to the plot and wished that the vocal split had not been so strongly in Michele 's favor , but called it " a fun , infectious number . " 
 Criss 's performance of " It 's Not Unusual " attracted comparisons to comical renditions of the number in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air , but earned an " A " from West regardless . Fallon said the routine was " embarrassingly enjoyable " and lauded Criss 's screen presence , and Benigno called it a " wonderful performance " , but felt it was hampered by the simplicity of the arrangement and gave it a " B + " . Futterman and Slezak both generally like Blaine as a lead vocalist , but felt the song was not his best : Futterman wrote that " some of the belting felt strained and the energy a little forced " , and Slezak awarded the song a " B – " . 
 The " Anything Goes " / " Anything You Can Do " mash @-@ up was widely acclaimed . Respers France named Pearce 's performance the best moment of the episode , and found that the character positively reminded her of " Glee of old " . The song was also a favorite of Lee 's , who wrote that the intensity of the actress was perfectly matched to the character 's disposition . West , Slezak and Benigno gave the performance an " A " ; the former called it an " outstanding rendition " which " felt like it belonged on a big stage or in a big @-@ screen musical " , and the latter two praised her vocal talent , which Benigno deemed unequalled on Glee . Futterman and Bell found Harmony a credible rival to Rachel vocally , and eagerly anticipated future competition between them . Urban called Pearce 's performance merely " serviceable " . Though she felt her acting was a weak point , she compared her favorably to season two guest star Charice and praised her vocals . Criticism came from New York 's Lindy West , who did not understand Rachel 's humiliation , as New Directions " sing way more elaborate and equally competent arrangements four to five times an episode " . She elaborated , " This is a thing that drives me crazy about Glee . As a viewer , there 's no knowing whether a performance was ' good ' like ' Anything Goes , ' or ' bad ' like ' We 've Got the Beat , ' until Rachel starts crying or some cheerleader starts throwing spaghetti . " 
 " You Can 't Stop the Beat " was called a " perfect ending to a perfect season premiere " by Mullins . Futterman described it as a " standard Glee episode finale , full of inspiration and importance for the future , and catchy as all hell . " Slezak enjoyed Rachel 's slow opening verse , said the full performance " felt a lot like the shiny , happy Glee of yore " and gave it an " A – " as did Benigno , who also found it a typical final number but was less enthused by the familiarity . Votta 's only disappointment with the rendition was that the televised version did not include the " adorable duet " between Kurt and Artie that is present on the single .

 = Hamersley , Western Australia = 
 Hamersley is a residential suburb 14 kilometres ( 8 @.@ 7 miles ) north @-@ northwest of the central business district of Perth , the capital of Western Australia , and six kilometres ( 4 mi ) from the Indian Ocean . The suburb adjoins two major arterial roads — Mitchell Freeway to the west and Reid Highway to the south — and is within the City of Stirling local government area . It was built during the late 1960s and 1970s as part of the Government of Western Australia 's response to rapidly increasing land prices across the metropolitan area . 
 Before development , Hamersley was a remote district covered in jarrah , marri , banksia and other vegetation typical of the Swan Coastal Plain , with small areas cleared for small @-@ scale agriculture such as market gardening and poultry farming . By 1974 , six years after the first subdivision , Hamersley was home to the district 's first community hall , an annual parade and fair which were broadcast on Perth TV and radio , an active progress association , and its own newspaper , the Hamersley Gazette , a forerunner to today 's Stirling Times . Rapid growth further north removed the focus from Hamersley , which was completed in 1981 and has remained relatively stable since then . 
 Significant reserves of remnant bushland remain in parts of the suburb . The largest of these is an exclusion zone around the 180 metres ( 590 feet ) high ABC radio tower in the suburb 's southeast , which broadcasts AM stations to the Perth metropolitan area . The guyed tower was built in 1939 and is a landmark in the region , although it has become a local political issue over the past decade . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Hamersley is in the northern suburbs of Perth , Western Australia , within the City of Stirling , and 6 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 miles ) from the Indian Ocean . Its borders are the Mitchell Freeway to the west , Reid Highway and the Balcatta industrial area to the south , Wanneroo Road to the east , and Beach Road and the City of Joondalup to the north . The suburb is divided into western and eastern portions by Erindale Road . Hamersley was one of the first Perth suburbs to be guided by the principles of cul @-@ de @-@ sac design , and many of its minor streets are joined by parks and pathways . 
 Hamersley covers 3 @.@ 267 square kilometres ( 807 acres ) and averages 29 metres ( 95 feet ) above sea level , although portions of the loop formed by Rannoch Circle in the eastern portion are 50 – 55 metres ( 164 – 180 ft ) above sea level . A real estate magazine remarked in 1994 that " homes around the Rannoch circle enjoy some spectacular views to the city and the hills " , and that " a few lucky householders ... could even catch ocean glimpses , despite being more than six kilometres from the water . " 
 The restricted @-@ access bushland reserve surrounding the ABC radio tower in the suburb 's southeast covers 14 @.@ 4 % ( 0 @.@ 47 km2 or 120 acres ) of its area , while parks and areas of natural bushland are spread throughout . The largest of these are Aintree @-@ Eglinton Reserve , a 3 @.@ 38 hectares ( 8 @.@ 4 acres ) grassed reserve next to the community centre complex , and Rannoch @-@ Tay @-@ Earn Reserve , a 4 @.@ 83 hectares ( 11 @.@ 9 acres ) reserve containing large areas of native bushland interspersed with grassed and paved walkways . A biodiversity site north of the community centre is recognised by the City of Stirling 's Green Plan 2 . 
 Streets in western Hamersley are generally named after English towns , while eastern Hamersley uses the names of Scottish Highland and Perthshire towns and lochs . There are exceptions – the origins of Vickers Street precinct street names are unknown , while streets in the south @-@ western corner are named after the " Bentley Boys " , a group of British racing drivers from the 1920s and 1930s , and their car designer Walter Owen Bentley . 
 = = = Natural history = = = 
 Hamersley 's soil is an infertile yellow @-@ brown sand composed of fine to coarse quartz grains , with <unk> Limestone beneath . Locally known as Karrakatta Sand , it is almost certainly the leached remnants of coastal sand deposited by eolian processes in the late Pleistocene period , between 11 @,@ 000 and 100 @,@ 000 years ago . Below the sand are Paleozoic rocks of the Perth Basin . The sand contains an unconfined aquifer with large supplies of low @-@ salinity potable groundwater which is recharged by rainfall . 
 As with other infertile areas of the Swan Coastal Plain , Hamersley would have supported open forests of Eucalyptus marginata ( Jarrah ) with Corymbia calophylla ( <unk> ) or Eucalyptus gomphocephala ( <unk> ) , and an understorey of Banksia attenuata ( Candlestick Banksia ) , B. menziesii ( Firewood Banksia ) , B. grandis ( Bull Banksia ) , Allocasuarina fraseriana ( Western Sheoak ) and Agonis flexuosa ( Swan River Peppermint ) . The main shrub species would have been <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , J. <unk> ( Grey <unk> ) , Acacia cyclops ( Coastal Wattle ) , Acacia saligna ( Orange Wattle ) , Hibbertia species , Allocasuarina humilis ( Dwarf Sheoak ) , <unk> quadrifidus ( One @-@ sided <unk> ) and Grevillea <unk> ( Spider Net Grevillea ) . Biodiversity surveys in 2006 have also identified a relatively rare species , <unk> sericea ( <unk> ) , in two eastern Hamersley reserves . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Name = = = 
 Hamersley was named after the Hamersley family who arrived in the Swan River Colony in 1837 and established themselves at Guildford . There is no evidence they ever visited modern Hamersley , but in 1869 they built a summer home in what is now North Beach , 6 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 miles ) to the west , and bought considerable holdings in the area over the following years . 
 The name first came into use to describe the north @-@ western section of the Perth Road District in 1906 . Hamersley Ward was a large area of land covering what is now Hamersley , Carine , <unk> Bay , North Beach , <unk> and parts of Balcatta , Karrinyup and Trigg . The Hamersley townsite , consisting of Hamersley Ward , was gazetted in 1945 . As a result , many facilities in North Beach , including a primary school , a golf course , several sporting clubs and residents ' and seniors ' associations , were called Hamersley . After the Hamersley Development Scheme started in 1968 , confusion as to exactly what Hamersley referred to led to conflict between established organisations in North Beach and emerging ones in Hamersley – the Hamersley Gazette noted in 1973 that " North Beach people have the prior claim but ours is more officially accepted " . 
 The suburb was gazetted as a locality by the City of Stirling on 24 October 1975 , although it had existed as a postal locality since 1971 . 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 Before European settlement , Hamersley was part of a larger area of land that was occupied by the <unk> people , an Indigenous Australian people who traversed the lakes and wetlands running parallel to the coast between what is now Perth and Yanchep . 
 Soon after the establishment of the Swan River Colony , colonial authorities divided up the land into grants which were given to settlers who had brought capital and to the new settlement . Southern Hamersley became part of Location K , a 2 @,@ 585 hectares ( 6 @,@ 390 acres ) strip of land extending 19 kilometres ( 12 miles ) west from Caversham on the Swan River to Big Carine Swamp , which was granted to Robert Ansell Partridge in September 1829 . The western part of this , first surveyed by <unk> Chauncy in 1843 , remained fairly inaccessible , and the only development in the area was the construction of the <unk> Park cottage on Old Balcatta Road 500 metres ( 0 @.@ 31 miles ) southwest of Hamersley . By the late 1930s , portions in the far west and south @-@ east of the suburb had been cleared for small @-@ scale agriculture such as market gardening , and in 1939 the Department of the Interior constructed a 180 metres ( 590 feet ) tower and other facilities for ABC AM and shortwave radio broadcasts on Wanneroo Road . 
 Northern Hamersley , meanwhile , became part of Swan Location 1315 , which extended north to Lake <unk> and west to the coast and was granted in the 1890s to the Midland Railway Company after being surveyed by Crossland & Co. in 1892 , and by N. <unk> in 1894 . It appears that no development occurred in northern Hamersley , other than the construction of Beach and Carine Roads in 1900 , and the State Housing Commission resumed the land in November 1950 . In 1962 , a <unk> grower with a property on Duffy Road , Carine applied to use the northern half of the suburb as a sheep run . The Shire President , Herbert R. Robinson , refused to grant permission , saying that " land might soon be needed for housing " . The West Australian reported in 1967 that the area was still " virtually untouched bushland " . 
 = = = Hamersley Development Scheme = = = 
 In the late 1960s , concern about the growth of land prices in the Perth metropolitan area , which for several years had exceeded the consumer price index , led to the Premier of Western Australia , David Brand , convening an inter @-@ departmental committee to study the problem . One of the committee 's recommendations to Cabinet was to release 300 hectares of land owned by the State Housing Commission in Hamersley , Warwick and Greenwood which was on a much larger area that had been designated as " deferred urban " land under the Metropolitan Region Scheme in 1963 . On 13 December 1967 , the Metropolitan Region Planning Authority decided to rezone as urban all land bounded by Hepburn Avenue , Marmion Avenue , North Perimeter Highway and Wanneroo Road , on the condition that subdivision would be approved when " Town Planning ( Development ) Scheme ( s ) have been approved with the general object of serving the best possible development at the least cost to the community " . 
 The Shires of Perth and Wanneroo combined to prepare Town Planning Scheme <unk> ( Hamersley Development Scheme ) , and by early March 1968 , the scheme , which included provisions for water supply , sewerage , drainage , road construction and undergrounding of power mains , was presented to both councils for consideration . A time limit of 3 ½ years for developers to construct homes on released land was built into the scheme in an effort to prevent land speculation , which the inter @-@ departmental committee believed was a key factor in spiralling prices in Perth . By July , however , negotiations between the councils broke down , and the Shire of Perth ( now City of Stirling ) decided to administer its own part of the scheme independently . The scheme was divided into nine sections , with what is now the suburb of Hamersley being the first stage . 
 In April 1968 the R & I Bank , a government @-@ owned bank , was granted permission to subdivide a small area in northern Ardleigh Crescent in the suburb 's west . The first auction of 80 lots on Saturday , 14 December 1968 was anticipated on the front page of The West Australian , with Premier Brand advising intending buyers to be cautious about their bids . At the auction , 76 lots were sold at an average price of $ 4 @,@ 784 , compared to $ 6 @,@ 700 at a recent R & I Bank sale in the nearby suburb of Karrinyup , with newspapers agreeing that the Premier 's warning had been heeded by bidders . 
 The western portion of Hamersley grew steadily over the following months and years , with segments being released , auctioned and developed by the R & I Bank , T & S Plunkett Homes and Parkland Housing . The Hamersley Development Scheme , however , was doomed almost before it started . Disagreements over issues such as undergrounding of power and the time limit clauses between the Town Planning Board and the Shire of Perth had caused delays in the scheme 's approval . In July 1970 , the Shire Planner reported that " there is little point in proceeding with the Scheme , especially in view of the large areas already subdivided " , and recommended the council agree " that for all practical purposes , Town Planning Scheme No. 26 @.@ is defunct " . By the February 1971 state election , over 1 @,@ 000 eligible voters lived in the district .

 In June 1970 , the Metropolitan Region Planning Authority released land in the southwestern corner of Hamersley , which had previously been held in reserve under the Metropolitan Region Scheme for a large freeway interchange between the future Mitchell Freeway ( then known as Stephenson Freeway ) and Reid Highway ( North Perimeter Freeway ) . The result of these changes was to allow the construction of Walter Way , Dutton Crescent and connecting streets , which were named after racing drivers from the 1920s and 1930s . 
 Between 1971 and 1973 , reserves , public recreation areas and drainage sites were set aside in western Hamersley , and facilities were erected in quick succession – the 1st Hamersley Scout Group in 1973 , the colonial @-@ style Holy Cross Anglican Church in 1974 , and a community hall at Aintree Street in 1975 . Residents in the region were at this time on the fringe of Perth 's suburban area , relying on partly built main roads , distant shopping centres and overstretched local facilities for several years after the suburb 's construction . A locally produced fortnightly newspaper , the Hamersley Gazette , started in early 1973 by Peter Flanigan , from his home in Manton Court , covering the suburbs of Carine , Hamersley , Warwick and Greenwood , with the open aim of helping to form community associations and campaign for better facilities . A July 1973 article , for example , lamented that " work on Erindale Road appears to have come to a standstill ... great piles of dirt and unmade road surfaces bear testimony to the fact that something is going on , or should be going on , but this one is taking a very long time . " 
 However , there were also celebrations – the paper reported in detail on the annual Glendale Spring Fair , held between 1973 and 1976 by the Glendale P & C Association on the second Saturday in November . It included activities for children , marching bands provided by The Salvation Army and the Australian 10th Light Horse Regiment , and a parade along Glendale Avenue and Beach Road at 10 : 30 am Intended originally as a fundraiser for the school , the Gazette reported that it was " a sort of glorified <unk> that rapidly outgrew its origins " , with live coverage of the parade on ABC radio and on television station <unk> @-@ 7 and personalities such as Jeff Newman in attendance . The fair , however , became the victim of a dispute over naming rights between the Glendale P & C , community groups and commercial sponsors . Other events included the grand opening of Warwick Grove Shopping Centre on 13 November 1974 , the greening of Aintree @-@ Eglinton Reserve and the activities of the Hamersley Progress Association . The paper was acquired in February 1977 by Bill Marwick of the Wanneroo Times , and evolved into the Stirling Times in 1980 . 
 Meanwhile , work was only starting in eastern Hamersley . In 1973 Project Homes acquired a poultry farm and agricultural holding , and completed the construction of Vickers Street and adjoining roads , with Don Place becoming a display village . In 1974 the City of Stirling agreed , after complex negotiations , to sell 4 @.@ 2 hectares of land comprising Carine Road and Allen Street to the State Housing Commission and to War Service Homes in order to " facilitate a satisfactory <unk> design of adjoining land held by the State Housing Commission " in the eastern portion of the suburb . All that remains of these two early roads are paved pathways within the Rannoch @-@ Tay @-@ Earn Reserve , which was gazetted in 1976 . By July 1975 , 200 defence service homes were under construction on land immediately to the east of Erindale Road , to be made available to veterans from March 1976 . The rest of eastern Hamersley was built over the next few years , and by 1981 development was essentially complete . The community hall was redeveloped into a full @-@ fledged community centre , which officially opened in 1990 . 
 Despite Hamersley 's stability in the years since 1981 and its relatively low crime rate , it has periodically drawn the attention of the Perth media . In July 2000 , a man bludgeoned his former girlfriend , mother @-@ of @-@ two Deborah Boyd , to death in a rented home in Brabant Way . He was subsequently sentenced to strict @-@ security life imprisonment . On 23 January 2006 , a large scrub fire caused the closure of Reid Highway and delays in rail line services during the afternoon rush hour .

 At the ABS 2011 census , Hamersley had a population of 4 @,@ 982 people . This was an increase of 17 people from the 2006 census , a decline of 246 people from the 2001 census , and a decline of 605 people from the 1996 census . 
 Hamersley residents had a median age of 39 , compared to the Perth average of 36 . The median household income in Hamersley was around the average for the region and for Perth — $ 1 @,@ 489 per week compared with $ 1 @,@ 518 and $ 1 @,@ 459 per week respectively . The 2011 Census figures put Hamersley 's unemployment rate at 0 @.@ 9 % below the Perth average .

All Saints Catholic Church is in neighbouring Warwick and the local Uniting Churches are in Carine and Greenwood . 
 = = Amenities and facilities = = 
 Hamersley is a residential suburb , relying on the Warwick Grove shopping centre on its northern boundary for commercial services , and is 7 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 miles ) by road from Karrinyup Shopping Centre . A light industrial area is to the south in Balcatta which includes a large <unk> Warehouse on Erindale Road approximately 200 metres ( 660 ft ) south of Hamersley . 
 Aintree @-@ Eglinton Reserve , a grassed area covering 3 @.@ 38 hectares ( 8 @.@ 4 acres ) , contains a cricket pitch , several practice runs and night lights for Australian rules football , which are utilised by local amateur and junior clubs . Within the reserve is the Hamersley Community Recreation Centre , first built in the 1970s as a community hall and opened in its present form on 22 April 1990 . The centre is a small village area consisting of a central pergola crossed with walking paths , flanked by four buildings : a sports hall with basketball courts and kiosk , an arts and crafts building , a community hall and function building hosting discos and other social events , and a purpose @-@ built children 's centre . Near the centre are the 1st Hamersley Scout Group , a child health centre and the Holy Cross Anglican Church , a colonial @-@ style building built in 1974 and consecrated on 14 December 1980 to serve the newly formed Balcatta @-@ Hamersley Parish . 
 Numerous small parks are throughout all parts of Hamersley , usually joining the ends of several cul @-@ de @-@ sacs and in some cases containing wooden benches or children 's play equipment . The Rannoch @-@ Tay @-@ Earn reserve in eastern Hamersley also contains two barbecues . The introduction of a barbecue and new playground equipment to the reserve first came in the late 1990s . 2008 – 2009 has seen the introduction of a new barbecue area due west of the playground with more introductions to the reserve to come . 
 The southeastern corner contains the ABC 50 kW radio tower which transmits ABC AM radio in Perth , including ABC Local Radio ( <unk> ) , Radio National and ABC NewsRadio . Several other towers , including a 20 kW and 10 kW tower , are also at the site . Some residents argue that electromagnetic interference from the towers is adversely affecting their television and telephone reception , with the issue taken up in Federal parliament by local MPs . An inquiry was held by ACMA in November 2010 into the situation , which found that apart from some disturbance to ABC2 signals , TV and radio signals in the area were of acceptable strength and quality . 
 = = Education = = 
 Hamersley contains two state primary schools , each of which includes facilities for pre @-@ primary students , and a teaching resource centre . Hamersley is within the catchment area for Warwick Senior High School for students from Years 8 to 12 . 
 Hamersley 's first school , Glendale Primary School in Glendale Avenue , opened in 1971 in the western portion of the suburb . The school and neighbouring kindergarten quickly became overcrowded as their catchment area initially extended to Hepburn Avenue , taking in Warwick and Greenwood to its north . As schools were built in those suburbs in 1974 – 1976 , congestion eased considerably . The school and kindergarten were also used as a hall and meeting place by residents and groups until the recreation centre opened in April 1975 . In 2016 , the school provided for 248 primary students between Year 1 and Year 6 , and 28 pre @-@ primary students . 
 From 1976 onward , the eastern portion of the suburb developed , and East Hamersley Primary School , in Doon Way , opened in February 1979 . In 2006 , the school provided for 109 primary , 30 pre @-@ primary and 29 kindergarten students . Computer studies and Indonesian language are required subjects for students from Years 3 to 6 . In the 1990s , the West Coast Resource Centre , a specialist borrowing library for teachers of kindergarten , pre @-@ primary and primary classes , was built on the East Hamersley site by the Department of Education ( now Education and Training ) to serve schools in the northern suburbs . 
 = = Transport = = 
 Cars are the preferred mode of transport in the suburb . At the 2011 census , the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that 68 @.@ 8 % of Hamersley 's residents were drivers or passengers of cars in their commute to work , a figure only slightly lower than the north metropolitan average of 71 @.@ 3 % . Other private modes of transport included motorcycling ( 0 @.@ 7 % ) , cycling ( 1 @.@ 1 % ) and walking ( 1 @.@ 3 % ) . The low number of walking commuters compared to the north metropolitan average of 1 @.@ 5 % and the Perth Statistical Region average of 1 @.@ 81 % is most likely due to the limited number of workplaces within walking distance . 
 Hamersley is situated at the intersection of several key arterial roads and highways . It is connected to North Beach ( 7 km ) , Scarborough ( 10 km ) and Perth Airport ( 22 km ) via Reid Highway , to the Perth CBD ( 15 km ) and to Joondalup ( 17 km ) via Reid Highway and Mitchell Freeway , and to the Balcatta industrial area and Karrinyup Shopping Centre ( 7 km ) by Erindale Road . Traffic within Hamersley is distributed by a number of backbone streets , of which the main ones are Eglinton Crescent , Belvedere Road , Rannoch Circle , Blissett Way and Vickers Street . 
 However , the controlled access highways on Hamersley 's southern and western boundaries physically isolate the suburb from its neighbours and limit southbound exits to just two , Erindale Road and Wanneroo Road . This results in considerable rush hour congestion on the stretch of Erindale Road between Eglinton Crescent and Reid Highway . In 2004 , Main Roads Western Australia provided a grant of $ 48 @,@ 000 to the City of Stirling under its Black Spot Programme to improve the traffic flow in this area . 
 = = = Public transport = = = 
 Public transport in Hamersley is generally in the form of Transperth buses operated by Swan Transit from the Warwick railway station at its northwestern corner , linking via the Joondalup railway line to the Perth CBD . 
 At the 2011 census , the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that 13 @.@ 9 % of Hamersley 's residents used public transport to get to work . This was a sizable jump from 8 @.@ 5 % in the 2006 census , and was higher than the north @-@ western metropolitan average of 13 @.@ 1 % . Public transport usage was highest ( 16 @.@ 8 % ) in the section of Hamersley closest to the train station , and lowest ( 8 @.@ 3 % ) in the Vickers Street section to the southeast , where many residents live more than 10 minutes ' walk from the nearest bus stop . 
 Currently , the only service in the suburb is the 387 daytime service between Warwick and Perth via Balcatta Road , which travels along Eglinton Crescent . Eastern Hamersley does not have a direct service , other than those along Erindale and Wanneroo Roads . However , service along Wanneroo Road is very limited outside standard weekday hours . 
 Originally , Hamersley was served by a shuttle service to Wanneroo Road , <unk> , to connect with other routes to the Perth CBD . In September 1973 , the Metropolitan Transport Trust introduced the 358 and 359 services , which linked Greenwood to Perth via Eglinton Crescent and Glendale Avenue / Aintree Street respectively , travelling along Blissett Way , then becoming limited @-@ stops Wanneroo Road services . An after @-@ hours service , the 369 , was also introduced . In 1987 , following the construction of the Warwick Transfer Station and the Mitchell Freeway , services along Glendale Avenue and through East Hamersley ceased , with two new routes – the 347 and the Freeway @-@ bound 387 – being created to serve Eglinton Crescent . 
 On 21 March 1993 , the Joondalup railway line came into operation as part of the Northern Suburbs Transit System , resulting in the creation of the 449 and 457 services to replace the 387 service . The 449 operated only during the morning and evening rush @-@ hour , while the 457 operated after @-@ hours and at weekends . These services operated virtually unchanged until 6 November 2011 , when the 347 was replaced with the present @-@ day 387 , and the 457 and weekday evening services were withdrawn . On 31 January 2016 , the 449 was also withdrawn , leaving Hamersley without weekend bus services . 
 = = Politics = = 
 Hamersley has consistently favoured the centre @-@ right Liberal Party at both federal and state elections throughout its history . However , in the 2001 and 2005 state elections and at the 1983 federal election , Hamersley booths recorded a majority for the centre @-@ left Australian Labor Party ( ALP ) . Hamersley has also shown a higher preference than the regional average for progressive minor parties such as the Australian Greens and Australian Democrats . Hamersley is both socially and geographically between the safe Liberal suburbs west of the Mitchell Freeway such as Carine , Duncraig and North Beach , and the safe Labor suburbs east of Wanneroo Road such as Balga and <unk> . 
 At federal level , Hamersley is within the Division of Stirling , a marginal seat which historically has alternated between the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party . It has been held since 2004 by Michael Keenan of the Liberal Party . At polling place and subdivision level , Hamersley has supported the Liberal Party at every election since its first in 1972 , the only exception being the 1983 election . In the 2001 election , the booth at East Hamersley Primary School was only won by the Liberal Party with a 0 @.@ 3 % two @-@ party @-@ preferred majority . Hamersley was in the Division of Cowan for elections held between 1984 and 1996 . 
 In the Western Australian Legislative Assembly , Hamersley is split between the electorates of <unk> and Balcatta , ordinarily both safe seats for the Australian Labor Party . At polling place level , Hamersley supported the Liberal Party at every election since its first in 1971 until the 1996 election . In both the 2001 and 2005 elections , polling places in Hamersley , as with those in many northern Perth suburbs , switched to the Australian Labor Party at state level . However , at the 2008 and 2013 elections , the suburb returned a majority for the Liberals . 
 At local level , Hamersley is represented within the City of Stirling by the two councillors of the Hamersley Ward , which covers the suburbs of Carine , Hamersley , <unk> and northern Balcatta . At present , Samantha Jenkinson , whose term expires in October 2017 , and Andrew Guilfoyle , whose term expires in October 2015 , represent Hamersley Ward . 
 In the early 1970s , the Hamersley Progress Association was formed to represent the views of Hamersley residents to all levels of government . It was , however , fairly short @-@ lived . In 1999 , the Hamersley Reference Group was formed to advise then @-@ Federal Member for Stirling Jann McFarlane MHR on issues related to the ABC radio transmission towers and their effect on local residents . It was renamed to Radio Interference Group – Hamersley Towers after it moved to complete community management , and lobbies the government and makes submissions to public inquiries on behalf of the community on the issue .

 = Marge on the Lam = 
 " Marge on the Lam " is the sixth episode of The Simpsons ' fifth season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 4 , 1993 . When Marge invites her neighbor Ruth Powers to attend the ballet with her , the two become friends and begin to go out , making Homer jealous as he wants Marge to spend time with him . Ruth and Marge agree to remain friends but not go out together after a large police pursuit with Chief Wiggum . It was written by Bill Canterbury and directed by Mark Kirkland . Phil Hartman , Pamela Reed and George <unk> guest star . 
 = = Plot = = 
 After donating money to public television , Marge receives complimentary ballet tickets . She asks Homer to accompany her , and much to Marge 's surprise he agrees , confusing ballet with a circus . On the day of the ballet , however , he inadvertently gets his arm stuck in a vending machine while trying to steal a can of soda from it and then gets his other arm stuck in a candy machine , and so is unable to attend the ballet as a result . In disbelief about Homer 's story , Marge invites her neighbor , Ruth Powers to attend with her . They both enjoy themselves and arrange to go out again the next night . Marge and Ruth 's friendship annoys Homer , who feels Marge should be spending time with him instead . However , ignoring Homer 's protests , Marge and Ruth visit bars and clubs in Springfield , and Ruth later shows Marge how to use a pistol . 
 Homer , attempting to prove to himself he can have a good time without Marge , leaves Bart , Lisa and Maggie under the supervision of Lionel Hutz and goes out by himself . Finding Moe 's Tavern more depressing than usual , Homer visits the hilltop where he and Marge used to come to on dates before they got married . Ironically , Marge has also taken Ruth there to finish the night , but they leave just before Homer arrives . Chief Wiggum finds Homer depressed and offers him a ride home , which Homer accepts . As Ruth and Marge are driving home , Chief Wiggum , with Homer as a passenger in his patrol car , spots Ruth 's car and claims that one tail light is slightly smaller than the other . He decides to pull them over . Reluctant to stop , Ruth reveals to Marge that the car she 's driving actually belongs to her ex @-@ husband , and that she had stolen it as revenge for <unk> her on child support ( although Marge points out that Ruth could 've just reported him to child services ) . Ruth leads the police on a high @-@ speed chase rather than turning herself in . Homer realizes it is Marge in the car , and believes she is leaving him after discovering that she can have a better time without him . Ruth successfully evades Wiggum by turning off her headlights , which leads him to believe her car is a ghost car . 
 After seeing Marge and Ruth again while cooking breakfast on his car engine , Wiggum continues his chase of the two , aided by other Springfield Police vehicles . After noticing a cliff ahead , Homer believes that Marge and Ruth are attempting suicide because of him and , using a megaphone , apologizes to Marge for all the mistakes he has made in their marriage and urges them not to drive into the chasm . Ruth , who had not noticed the chasm , slams on the brakes and stops in time ; however , Homer and Wiggum fail to stop and fly over the edge of the cliff only to crash into a landfill . The episodes ends with a description of the fates of each of the characters involved in the episode .

 Dan Castellaneta actually used a bullhorn to record his part when Homer was talking on one . The sunset shown when Marge and Ruth are at the café was airbrushed in , although the episode was done before computer animation was put into practice .

 Much of the plot , including Ruth 's blue convertible and Homer and Wiggum 's fall over the chasm , is a parody of the Ridley Scott film Thelma & Louise . Crystal Buzz Cola is a reference to the fad drink Crystal Pepsi , and when Homer reaches into the vending machine , a can of Fresca is seen in a skeletal hand . The comedian who performs at the telethon who the Simpson family does not find funny is a parody of Garrison Keillor . Ruth mistakenly inserts Lesley Gore 's song " Sunshine , Lollipops and Rainbows " into her car stereo before beginning her and Marge 's wild night out ; later , Chief Wiggum plays the song on his police cruiser 's stereo as " appropriate " car chase music . After extracting the wrong tape , Ruth pops in " Welcome to the Jungle " by Guns N ' Roses . The scene when Homer is in Moe 's Tavern is emulated from Thelma & Louise . Quimby dancing in a night club is in reference to the Kennedys . When Marge gets hit on in the bar , the guy who does not talk is a caricature of show runner David Mirkin . The old man that comes out when Marge is shooting his cans is a parody of Walter Brennan . The episode 's closing sequence is a reference to Dragnet . George <unk> recorded the ending in the same fashion as he did on Dragnet . 
 = = Reception = = 
 In its original broadcast , " Marge on the Lam " finished 32nd in ratings for the week of November 1 – 7 , 1993 , with a Nielsen rating of 13 @.@ 1 , equivalent to approximately 12 @.@ 2 million viewing households . It was the highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week , beating Beverly Hills , 90210 . 
 The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , said " Marge getting to let her hair down is always a treat , and in Ruth Powers she seems to have a real friend . A pity we don 't see more of her " . The A.V. Club named Homer 's line " Stupid TV ! Be more funny ! " as one of the quotes from The Simpsons that can be used in everyday situations . On their 2000 album And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside Out , indie rock band Yo La Tengo has a song entitled " Let 's Save Tony Orlando 's House " ; the song is named after a telethon in Troy McClure 's fictional CV seen in this episode . 
 = Zaireeka = 
 Zaireeka is the eighth studio album by the alternative rock band The Flaming Lips . Released on October 28 , 1997 , the experimental rock album consists of four Compact Discs . Each of its eight songs consists of four stereo tracks , one from each CD . The album was designed so that when played simultaneously on four separate audio systems , the four CDs would produce a harmonic or juxtaposed sound . The discs can also be played in different combinations , omitting one , two or three discs . The album 's title is a portmanteau of two words : Zaire , chosen as a symbol of anarchy after Wayne Coyne heard a radio news story about the political instability of the African nation , and eureka ( literally : " I have found it " ) , an expression of joyous discovery . 
 Zaireeka was the first album made by the band since the departure of guitarist Ronald Jones . It acted as a preview of the music and style that would surface on the next album , The Soft Bulletin ( 1999 ) and is the predecessor to the band 's more conventional surround sound releases . 
 = = Background = = 
 Adverse circumstances led to the production of Zaireeka . The departure of guitarist Ronald Jones compelled the band to change fundamentally . In addition , the limited success of the previous album , Clouds Taste Metallic , threatened their status at Warner Bros. Records . They eventually found that drummer Steven Drozd could compensate for the loss of Jones by becoming a multi @-@ instrumentalist . However , live shows proved to be more challenging and in order to maintain activity and output , Wayne Coyne conceived an experimental show . 
 = = = The Parking Lot Experiments = = = 
 During 1996 and 1997 , The Flaming Lips ran a series of events known as " The Parking Lot Experiments " . The concept was inspired by an incident in Coyne 's youth , where he noticed that car radios in the parking lot at a concert were playing the same songs at the same time , Wayne Coyne created 40 cassette tapes to be played in synchronization . The band invited people to bring their cars to parking lots , where they would be given one of the tapes and then instructed when to start them . The music was " a strange , fluid 20 minute sound composition " . 
 = = = Production = = = 
 Production of the album was preceded by two unfortunate events , which were recounted in " The <unk> Song " from The Soft Bulletin . Michael Ivins was involved in a car crash , and Steven Drozd 's hand became severely infected . Drozd initially claimed that his hand had been bitten by a spider , although later he admitted the infected abscess was caused by injection of heroin . 
 The Flaming Lips began work on Zaireeka in April 1997 in the then @-@ new Tarbox Road Studios . Initially , the band was frustrated while making the album . Even after diverting half of the budget for the next album into Zaireeka , there were no tangible results . The band experienced difficulty writing songs for the album . Finally , Coyne exclaimed " Look , we don 't have to be friends ... but we have to make this record ! " While this philosophy aided progress , the band only began to complete songs when they learned to write for the medium as opposed to trying to split normal songs across four CDs . 
 The group wrote several songs that were unsuccessful in the four @-@ CD format . These songs , including " Race for the Prize " , were reserved for the next album , which would eventually become The Soft Bulletin . 
 = = = Release = = = 
 Warner Bros. Records was initially apprehensive about releasing Zaireeka , so manager Scott Booker carefully researched the costs of releasing a box set . Booker discovered that Zaireeka could be released so that once 12 @,@ 000 copies had been sold , the label would break even . ( Advance orders for the album came to 14 @,@ 000 copies . ) Booker pitched the album to Warner Bros. Records president Steven Baker . 
 Eventually , the two factions reached an agreement in which the album would be released , although Zaireeka would not count towards the seven albums the band was contracted to deliver to Warner Bros. For an advance of $ 200 @,@ 000 , the band would make both Zaireeka and The Soft Bulletin . In addition , Booker mentioned that by allowing the media to proclaim how " weird " the band was with Zaireeka , they would be more prepared to treat The Soft Bulletin as a serious album . Zaireeka was released in October , 1997 . As of 2006 , 28 @,@ 000 copies have been sold .

 The speakers being used may be physically positioned in many different configurations ( e.g. at different heights or even in entirely different rooms ) . Some listeners may even choose to disable the left or right speaker of one or more systems . Synchronization errors between the audio systems may cause effects such as reverb or echo being heard on one disc before the original sound is produced from another . Further , the type and quality of each audio system affects the relationship between the four CDs . 
 = = = The Boom Box Experiments = = = 
 After completion of Zaireeka , The Flaming Lips tried an unconventional method to tour the album . " The Boom Box Experiments " , like " The Parking Lot Experiments " , involved tapes being played at the same time . However , these shows were held in conventional rock venues , and the band supplied their own boom boxes . Coyne and Drozd conducted two " choirs " of people controlling the boom boxes , giving them instructions for actions like turning the volume up or down , while Ivins controlled the mixer . 
 Songs played in The Boom Box Experiments include : 
 " The Big Ol ' Bug Is the New Baby Now " 
 " A Winter 's Day Car Accident Melody " 
 " Altruism , or That 's the Crotch Calling the Devil Black " 
 " <unk> in a Better Ego " 
 " Realizing the Speed of Life " 
 " Schizophrenic Sunrise , or The Loudest Blade of Grass " 
 " Should We Keep the Severed Head Awake ? ? " ( used in both the Parking Lot and Boom Box experiments . Part of it was included on " Sleeping on the Roof " on The Soft Bulletin . ) 
 = = = Aftermath and legacy = = = 
 With Zaireeka , The Flaming Lips had overcome the loss of Ronald Jones and proved they could still work as a band . The situation at Warner Bros. Records was still dire , including a risk of being dropped from the label . However , songs had already been written for the next album , The Soft Bulletin , which would be both a critical hit for the band and their breakthrough into mainstream success . Following the release of Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots in 2002 , The Flaming Lips would return to the concept of surround sound with a DVD @-@ Audio special @-@ edition of that album in 2003 . 
 Zaireeka is viewed by the band as nothing more than an experimental release . " It was , and still is , intended to be listened to by other artists , musicians and producers , " Coyne would later state in the liner notes for The Soft Bulletin 5 @.@ 1 , adding that they " never expected the less involved members of our audience to care about it . " 
 = = Songs = = 
 Zaireeka opens with " Okay I 'll Admit That I Really Don 't Understand " , a mantra of sorts about the admitted lack of comprehension regarding one 's situation . The second track , " Riding to Work in the Year 2025 ( Your Invisible Now ) " [ sic ] tells a science @-@ fiction story about a man who pretends to be a secret agent in the future and imagines his own psychological demise from the stress " of being the most important secret agent in the world " . " Thirty @-@ Five Thousand Feet of Despair " , the third song , is the tragic story of an airplane pilot who ( somehow ) hangs himself mid @-@ flight . The next song , " A Machine in India " , is about the " dull and depressing , mild insanity " that the speaker 's partner slips into during her menstrual cycle . Next , " The Train Runs over the Camel but Is Derailed by the Gnat " , is a speech by a man who is on the verge of discovery , but ends up " talking himself into circles " . Track six , " How Will We Know ? ( Futuristic <unk> ) " , is based on an urban legend that being exposed to high and low frequencies can cause a person to experience premonitions , and thus contains its infamously extensive frequencies that caused the band to place a warning on the album cover and inside the booklet . The seventh song , " March of the Rotten Vegetables " , is " music for a cartoon about a group of demented vegetables " . The eighth and final song , " The Big Ol ' Bug Is the New Baby Now " , contains a spoken @-@ word story about Coyne 's dogs ; the track ends the album with loud barking from each disc . On the 10th anniversary of Zaireeka , Wayne Coyne himself made and distributed an additional 5th disc to go along with the set . A limited amount of copies were made , and were handed out at the 10th anniversary listening party for the album . The disc , which looks identical to the other four discs with an exception of the disc being numbered 10 , contains what was originally discs 5 through 10 . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Critical reaction to Zaireeka was polarized . Josh Kun of Rolling Stone wrote that the album 's " wall @-@ of @-@ surround @-@ sound approach melds droning @-@ rock dissonance with warped , off @-@ kilter pop melodies , producing a totally immersing post @-@ Pet Sounds audio séance . " Jason <unk> of AllMusic stated that the album would only really be accessible to hardcore Flaming Lips fans , but that " they 're in for the musical experience of a lifetime " . 
 Critics who disliked the album cited what they viewed as a ridiculous concept . Salon remarked in its review that " Musically [ ... ] their 1995 album Clouds Taste Metallic offers the same psychotic results without all the technological hassle . And conceptually ? The same thing , just all at once : stupid , stupid , stupid , stupid . " Jason Josephes from Pitchfork awarded the album a score of 0 @.@ 0 out of 10 ; in a scathing review , Josephes criticized the album for being inaccessible , asking " Do I want to buy three more CD players with which to enjoy Zaireeka or , say , eat ? " and derided the band 's fans . Further , in October 2009 , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Pitchfork , Mark Richardson , wrote a book titled Zaireeka for the 33 1 / 3 book series , published by Continuum International Publishing , now owned by Bloomsbury Publishing . In it , Richardson chronicles the creation of the album , praises it from multiple angles , and discusses the impact the album has had on music since its release . The album was included in Pitchfork 's 2010 list of " ten unusual CD @-@ era gimmicks " .

 Tropical Storm Barry was a rapidly forming tropical cyclone that made landfall on Florida , United States , in early June 2007 . The second named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season , Barry developed from a trough of low pressure in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on June 1 . It tracked rapidly northeastward , reaching peak winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) before weakening and making landfall near Tampa Bay as a tropical depression . Barry quickly lost tropical characteristics after wind shear removed much of the convection , and early on June 3 it completed the transition into an extratropical cyclone . The extratropical remnants tracked up the East Coast of the United States , and were absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone on June 5 . 
 The precursor trough produced heavy rainfall across the western Caribbean Sea , which on Cuba unofficially reached over 7 @.@ 8 inches ( 200 mm ) . Outer rainbands in Pinar del Río Province injured three people and damaged 55 houses . In Florida , Barry dropped a moderate amount of precipitation across the drought @-@ ridden state ; rainfall peaked at 6 @.@ 99 inches ( 178 mm ) . The rain caused some flooding and wet roads , which led to two indirect traffic fatalities . Rough seas killed one Florida surfer in Pinellas County . In Florida and Georgia , the precipitation assisted firefighters in combating severe wildfires . Overall damage from the storm was minor .

 By late on May 29 , a weak trough over the Yucatán Peninsula produced a small area of convection over the Yucatán Channel . Convection increased in association with the trough , and the next day a broad envelop of cyclonic turning developed within the system . By May 30 , the moisture from the trough extended from Nicaragua through the southeastern Gulf of Mexico , with the greatest area of convection near Cuba . A westward moving tropical wave spawned a broad area of low pressure on May 30 , and by May 31 a circulation developed within the system to the southeast of Cozumel , Mexico . The low moved north @-@ northeastward , and gradually became better organized despite high amounts of vertical wind shear . The deep convection became more concentrated near the center , and it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression at 1200 UTC on June 1 just to the northwest of the western tip of Cuba . Operationally , it was not classified until eleven hours later . 
 The depression developed a large area of squalls , and organized enough to warrant a Hurricane Hunters flight into the area . The plane reported flight level winds of 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) and a pressure of 1000 mbar near the increasingly well @-@ defined low @-@ level circulation . Initially it maintained characteristics of both a tropical and subtropical cyclone , although deep convection continued to organize near the center ; based on the observations , the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories on Tropical Storm Barry at 2100 UTC on June 1 while the storm was centered about 235 miles ( 375 km ) west of Key West , Florida . Embedded within the southwesterly flow ahead of an approaching mid @-@ level trough , it tracked quickly northward , and early on June 2 attained peak winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) . 
 Shortly after reaching peak intensity , strong wind shear removed most of the deep convection ; the cloud pattern consisted of an exposed yet well @-@ defined center surrounded by a curved convective band extending from Cuba along the eastern Gulf of Mexico . The center became elongated and weakened as it accelerated northeastward , and at 1400 UTC on June 2 Barry made landfall near Tampa , Florida , as a weakening tropical depression . As it continued inland , it rapidly lost tropical characteristics , and later that day the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories on Barry while it was located over northeastern Florida . The extratropical remnants strengthened as the system continued northeastward , and on June 3 it moved ashore along South Carolina . Spiral bands developed to the north of the system as it moved up the coast , and a large plume of moisture extended well ahead of the low @-@ level circulation . Late on June 4 , the extratropical remnant entered New England , and late on June 5 the remnants of Barry were absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone near the border between the U.S. state of Maine and the Canadian province of Quebec .

 Coinciding with its classification as a tropical storm , the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning for the west coast of Florida from Bonita Beach through Keaton Beach , with a tropical storm watch declared from Keaton Beach northward to Saint Marks . An inland tropical storm warning was also issued for non @-@ coastal and non @-@ tidal areas of Charlotte , Citrus , DeSoto , Hardee , Hernando , Highlands , Lee , Levy , Manatee , Pasco , Pinellas , Polk , Sarasota , and Sumter counties . The passage of the storm resulted in an increased threat for rip currents , with officials recommending that swimmers stay out of the water until the storm leaves the area . A tornado watch was also posted for the southern portion of the state , though was dropped after the storm weakened . 
 After becoming an extratropical cyclone , local National Weather Service offices issued flood watches for portions of South Carolina , much of eastern North Carolina , southeastern Virginia , and southeastern Maryland . Later , flood and flash flood watches were issued for southeast Pennsylvania , northern Delaware , northern New Jersey , east @-@ central New York , and southern New England . Wind and lake wind advisories were posted in parts of Georgia .

 In El Salvador , the precursor trough produced about 2 @.@ 76 inches ( 70 mm ) of rainfall in about ten hours . 
 The precursor system dropped heavy rainfall across western Cuba , peaking at 12 @.@ 0 inches ( 305 mm ) in Sancti Spíritus Province . Several other locations recorded over 4 inches ( 100 mm ) of precipitation , which caused flooding along rivers and low @-@ lying areas . The city of Guane was isolated after flooding cut off communications . In total , more than 2 @,@ 000 people were evacuated due to the threat for flooding .

 Barry dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across Florida , peaking at 6 @.@ 99 inches ( 178 mm ) at Palm Beach International Airport ; several other locations reported over 3 inches ( 75 mm ) . The rainfall alleviated persistent drought conditions and assisted in combating severe wildfires across the state . In Brevard County , the rainfall closed a portion of Eau Gallie Boulevard after a large sinkhole developed . Several other roads across the area were flooded , and on Interstate 95 near Lake Worth , a sinkhole closed two lanes of traffic . Wet roads caused several traffic accidents across the state ; in both Brevard and Volusia counties , a motorist was killed from an accident . On Interstate 4 , a tractor trailer led to disruptions near Orlando after it crashed into a guardrail . 
 The storm produced heavy surf along the western coastline , as well as a storm tide of 4 @.@ 78 feet ( 1 @.@ 46 m ) at Clearwater Beach . The wave action caused minor beach erosion , with 50 – 60 feet ( 15 – 18 m ) of sand washed away at Bradenton Beach . The increased ocean action caused minor flooding along several roads in the Tampa Bay area , which trapped some automobile travelers . At Indian Shores , a woman died after sustaining injuries from the rough surf . 
 High winds across the state included a report of 47 mph ( 76 km / h ) near the state 's southeastern coastline . The winds downed some trees and resulted in power outages , and one person in <unk> was injured after a tree fell onto a house . The storm spawned several tornadoes in the southern portion of the state , some of which damaged fences and power lines . One possible tornado in Goulds left about 2 @,@ 000 people without power after it knocked down a power line . Another tornado near Miami damaged a few homes and trees .

 Rainfall in Georgia peaked at 8 inches ( 203 mm ) in Mount Vernon . The precipitation assisted firefighters in combating wildfires in the southern portion of the state , which gave thousands of workers a brief respite after they had fought the fires daily for over a month . The rainfall caused some minor flooding , and in Savannah a few minor traffic accidents occurred . Gusty winds blew down trees and power lines , and along the coast , rough surf was reported . Heavy rainfall from the storm spread across much of the East Coast of the United States . State totals peaked at 6 @.@ 12 inches ( 155 mm ) near <unk> , South Carolina , 3 @.@ 73 inches ( 95 mm ) in <unk> @-@ Varina , North Carolina , and 3 @.@ 75 inches ( 95 mm ) near Pennington Gap , Virginia .

 The extratropical remnants of Barry produced gusty winds along the Atlantic coastline which peaked at 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) near Charleston , South Carolina . Around 200 houses in Craven County , North Carolina , were without power after winds downed a power line . In North Carolina , adverse conditions from the storm delayed an elimination baseball game between the East Carolina University and Western Carolina University teams . In southeastern Virginia , the remnants of Barry caused over 60 traffic accidents , which resulted in 10 injuries . Rough seas off of Cape Fear left a sailboat containing three people requiring rescue from the Coast Guard . Rainfall extended into the Mid @-@ Atlantic states through New England , with 4 @.@ 50 inches ( 113 mm ) reported at Absecon , New Jersey , 3 @.@ 91 inches ( 99 mm ) recorded near Central Park , New York , and 3 @.@ 19 inches ( 81 mm ) at Taunton , Massachusetts .

Flash flooding was also reported in southeast New York , and high wind gusts caused sporadic tree damage . In New Jersey , northeast onshore flow associated with the remnants of Barry produced high tides and minor coastal flooding . 
 = 1946 Cleveland Browns season = 
 The 1946 Cleveland Browns season was the team 's first in the All @-@ America Football Conference ( AAFC ) . The Browns , coached by Paul Brown , ended the year with a record of 12 – 2 , winning the AAFC 's Western Division . Led by quarterback Otto Graham , fullback Marion Motley and ends Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie , the team won the first AAFC championship game against the New York Yankees . 
 The Browns were founded by Arthur B. McBride , a Cleveland taxi @-@ cab tycoon , as a charter franchise in the new AAFC . McBride in 1945 hired Brown , a successful coach at the high school and college levels . Brown , who was serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II , began to assemble a roster as the team prepared to begin play in 1946 . After beating the Brooklyn Dodgers in an exhibition game , Cleveland opened the regular season against the Miami Seahawks at Cleveland Stadium on September 6 , winning 44 – 0 . The Browns proceeded to win six more games before losing for the first time in October against the San Francisco 49ers at home by a score of 34 – 20 . Cleveland lost a second game in a row against the Los Angeles Dons the following week , but rebounded to win the final five games of the season , including a 66 – 14 victory over the Dodgers . Cleveland finished with the league 's best record and a spot in the championship game against the Yankees . The Browns won the game 14 – 9 . 
 Lavelli led the AAFC in receiving with 843 yards and 8 touchdowns , while placekicker Lou Groza led the league in points scored , with 84 . Graham had the league 's best passing average , with 10 @.@ 5 yards per attempt . His quarterback rating of 112 @.@ 1 was the highest in professional football history until Joe Montana surpassed it in 1989 . Cleveland played all of its home games in Cleveland Stadium . The 1946 Browns set a professional football record with 67 defensive takeaways ; the record still stands as of 2016 . 
 = = Founding of the Browns in the AAFC = = 
 In 1944 Arch Ward , the influential sports editor of the Chicago Tribune , started a new professional football league called the All @-@ America Football Conference ( AAFC ) . Ward , who had gained fame for starting all @-@ star games for baseball and college football , lined up deep @-@ pocketed owners including Arthur B. " Mickey " McBride , a Cleveland businessman who grew up in Chicago and knew Ward from his involvement in the newspaper business . 
 McBride developed a passion for football attending games at Notre Dame , where his son went to college . In the early 1940s he tried to buy the NFL 's Cleveland Rams , owned by millionaire supermarket heir Dan Reeves , but was rebuffed . Having been awarded the Cleveland franchise in the AAFC , McBride asked Cleveland Plain Dealer sportswriter John Dietrich for head coaching suggestions . Dietrich recommended Paul Brown , the 36 @-@ year @-@ old Ohio State Buckeyes coach . After consulting with Ward , McBride followed Dietrich 's advice in early 1945 , naming Brown head coach and giving him an ownership stake in the team and full control over player personnel . Brown , who had built an impressive record as coach of a Massillon , Ohio high school team and brought the Buckeyes their first national championship , at the time was serving in the U.S. Navy and coached the football team at Great Lakes Naval Station near Chicago . 
 The name of the team was at first left up to Brown , who rejected calls for it to be christened the Browns . McBride then held a contest to name the team in May 1945 ; " Cleveland Panthers " was the most popular choice , but Brown rejected it because it was the name of an earlier failed football team . " That old Panthers team failed , " Brown said . " I want no part of that name . " In August , McBride gave in to popular demand and named the team the Browns , despite Paul Brown 's objections . 
 = = Building a roster = = 
 As the war wound down with Germany 's surrender in May 1945 , the team parlayed Brown 's ties to college football and the military to build its roster . The first signing was Otto Graham , a former star quarterback at Northwestern University who was then serving in the Navy . The Browns later signed kicker and offensive tackle Lou Groza and wide receivers Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie . Fullback Marion Motley and nose tackle Bill Willis , two of the earliest African @-@ Americans to play professional football , also joined the team in 1946 . Cleveland 's first training camp took place at Bowling Green University in northwestern Ohio . Brown 's reputation for winning notwithstanding , joining the team was a risk ; the Browns and the AAFC were nascent entities and faced tough competition from the NFL . " I just went up there to see what would happen , " center Frank Gatski said many years later . 
 Almost all of the players Brown signed were war veterans . Gatski hitchhiked to Bowling Green from West Virginia in a military uniform . Once at training camp , the players faced intense competition for spots on the final roster . Rookies who had their college careers cut short by the war faced off against veteran players from NFL teams including the Chicago Cardinals and Chicago Bears . " It was a tough , dog @-@ eat @-@ dog situation , and you really had to hustle , " Groza said later . Almost all of the men Brown signed had played for or against his teams at Ohio State and Great Lakes . 
 Five former Rams players also jumped to the Browns in 1946 : center Mike Scarry , tackle Chet Adams and backs Gaylon Smith , Tommy Colella and Don Greenwood . Their move gave rise to a legal battle with the Rams , who left Cleveland for Los Angeles shortly after winning the 1945 NFL championship rather than compete with the Browns . Reeves , the Rams ' owner , filed an injunction against Adams in federal court after he signed with the Browns , claiming the tackle unlawfully broke his contract to play for the Rams . Adams argued he had no obligation under his contract to play for the Rams because the team had changed to the Los Angeles Rams following the move . At the end of August 1946 , federal judge <unk> Freed denied the Rams ' injunction , allowing Adams to play for the Browns . The judge rejected the Rams ' contention that Adams had signed to play for Reeves , not a specific team . He ruled the Cleveland Rams had ceased to exist , and that Adams therefore was not bound to fulfill a contract with the Los Angeles Rams . 
 In addition to the players , Brown hired a number of assistant coaches . John Brickels , an Ohio native , was brought in early on to sign players while Brown was still in the Navy . He later served as a backfield coach . Another hire was Blanton Collier , a high school coach for 16 years who had been an assistant to Brown at Great Lakes . Collier succeeded Brown in 1963 as the team 's head coach . Fritz Heisler was brought in as a guard coach and stayed with the Browns until the 1970s .

 The Browns ' first and only preseason game took place at the Rubber Bowl in Akron , Ohio against the Brooklyn Dodgers . Cleveland won the game 35 – 20 . Brooklyn opened the scoring with a touchdown in the first quarter and another on the first play of the second quarter . Both touchdowns followed interceptions thrown by Otto Graham . Substituting for Graham , Cliff Lewis threw a short touchdown pass to Fred Evans near the end of the second quarter to give the Browns their first points . Cleveland scored again in the second half after John <unk> picked up a fumble by Brooklyn halfback Glen Dobbs and ran it 55 yards for a touchdown , giving the Browns the lead . Graham threw a short pass to Mac Speedie for another touchdown in the third quarter , and added a 20 @-@ yard pass to George Young in the fourth quarter to widen the lead .

 A week before the championship game , three Browns players were arrested after a confrontation with Cleveland police . Team captain Jim Daniell , end Mac Speedie , tackle Lou Rymkus and halfback Edgar Jones were drinking and waiting for Speedie 's wife to arrive on a flight from Utah . They dropped Jones off and came up behind a police car that was blocking their way . Daniell , who was driving the car , honked the horn , and an argument ensued that ended with the arrest of all three men . Daniell was booked on public intoxication , and Speedie and Rymkus were charged with creating a disturbance . Paul Brown fired Daniell after the incident , saying he had " a special obligation to be exemplary in his behavior " because he was the team captain . 
 The first @-@ ever AAFC championship took place on December 22 , 1946 at Cleveland Stadium before a crowd of 41 @,@ 181 . Temperatures were in the 30s , which contributed to the low attendance numbers compared to other Browns home games , but the championship game drew more people than all but three NFL championship games up to that point . The Yankees were in close competition with the Browns as the AAFC 's leading team , and finished the season by winning seven of their last eight games . The Browns and Yankees had different styles of play : while the Browns used a T formation offense , the Yankees had a single @-@ wing formation . New York 's roster included Spec Sanders , who led the AAFC with 709 yards of rushing and 12 touchdowns . 
 The championship game was largely a defensive battle with little scoring from either team . New York scored the game 's first points in the first quarter on a 21 @-@ yard field goal by Harvey Johnson , but the Browns went into the lead in the second quarter when Marion Motley ran for a touchdown after a 70 @-@ yard drive . The Yankees retook the lead in the third quarter , marching 80 yards down the field for a Sanders touchdown . Cleveland reached the New York 18 @-@ yard line at the end of the third , but the drive stalled and Lou Groza missed a short field goal , his third failed attempt of the game . Groza had suffered a sprained left ankle , and Chet Adams substituted for him . Adams , however , missed another field goal in the fourth quarter . The Browns took the lead again in the fourth quarter when Graham passed to Lavelli for a 16 @-@ yard touchdown . Groza came back in and kicked the extra point , giving Cleveland a 14 – 9 advantage with 4 : 31 to play in the game . Sanders returned the ensuing kickoff 35 yards , and the Yankees started the drive at the Browns ' 45 @-@ yard line . The Yankees appeared poised for a comeback , but Graham intercepted a pass on a third down and Cleveland was almost able to run out the clock . Time expired after a Tommy Colella punt and one short Yankees completion . 
 Graham had 213 yards of passing in the championship game . Lavelli registered 87 receiving yards , and Speedie had 71 . Motley was the team 's leading rusher , with 98 yards on 13 carries . Cleveland 's defense was able to hold Sanders and New York quarterback Ace Parker in check . Parker had only 81 yards of passing , and Sanders ran for just 55 yards . 
 = = Season leaders = = 
 Graham had an average of 10 @.@ 5 yards per passing attempt , the second @-@ most in history at the time . He had a passer rating of 112 @.@ 1 , setting a single @-@ season record not exceeded until Joe Montana eclipsed it in 1989 . Motley finished the season with 601 yards rushing , the fourth most in the AAFC . Edgar Jones was the league 's fifth @-@ most @-@ prolific rusher , gaining 539 yards . Greenwood had six rushing touchdowns , tying for the league lead . Lavelli tied for first place in receptions , with 40 , and led the league in receiving yards , with 843 . His eight receiving touchdowns gave him second place in the league . Speedie , meanwhile , led all receivers in yards per reception , with 23 @.@ 5 . On defense , Colella led the AAFC with 10 interceptions ; as a team , the Browns were the league 's interception leaders by a large margin , with 41 . The Browns had 67 total defensive takeaways , a professional football record that still stands . Groza scored the most field goals and extra points and set a professional football record for a kicker by scoring 84 points . He was the first @-@ ever kicker to make two field goals from beyond 50 yards in a season . A number of Browns players were named to sportswriters ' All @-@ Pro teams , including Motley , Speedie , Lavelli , Willis and Mike Scarry .

 Where We Land is the first studio album by Australian Idol 2006 winner Damien Leith . It was released by Sony BMG in Australia on 18 August 2007 , and in Ireland on 28 September 2007 . Leith produced the album for seven months and created the album entirely with acoustic songs . He wrote or co @-@ wrote nine of the twelve songs , collaborating with Alex Lloyd and his music director Paul Gray ( Wa Wa Nee ) in a few songs . All of his original songs were inspired by his friends and family . Leith included two cover songs in the album , Fleetwood Mac 's " Songbird " from the album Rumours and the traditional Irish song " Danny Boy " . Where We Land received mostly average reviews from critics . It debuted in the Australian Albums Chart at number @-@ one and was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association . The album spawned the singles " 22 Steps " , " All I Want Is You " and " Not Just For The Weekend " . Leith embarked on a national tour across Australia to promote the album in November 2007 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Damien Leith stated how his debut studio album wanted to pan out : " I didn 't really want to do anybody else 's songs ... I just wanted this album to be mine " . Immediately after Australian Idol concluded , he convinced the producers of the show to break from protocol by giving him longer time to record the album . The protocol was that the Australian Idol winners had only one week after the competition ended to record their first album . He decided to work on his first studio album for the next few months . Leith was aware of the little success of the previous two Idol winners , Casey Donovan and Kate DeAraugo , so he decided to turn something more palpable than the previous winners by producing an album of original songs . He comments , " I suppose the main thing for me was trying to establish myself as a songwriter out of it because that 's something that hasn 't really been promoted in the past . " He was determined to create as much original material as possible for the album , and create songs that truly represent who he was . He also wanted the themes in the lyrics to not only be personal , but broad enough so that listeners can relate to them . 
 = = Production and recording = = 
 Leith remarked that recording the album was an exciting but nerve @-@ racking experience . He recorded his music at Sony BMG 's recording studio in East Sydney . His producers already had in mind what kind of album they want to produce for Leith . He , however wanted his album to be totally acoustic . Knowing that he was well known by the Australian public as the new Australian Idol , he knew that it was risky to produce an acoustic based album because it was very different from the records produced by the previous Idol contestants , as many of their records predominantly featured up @-@ beat pop songs . He noted that the music he was making could make the album harder to sell commercially . 
 As a result , he and his producers spent the time to work on the songs which would appeal to a broader audience . Leith did this by holding onto several elements in his music that people had enjoyed on Australian Idol . However , he still wanted to show new elements to the album , so he held on some elements of acoustic music . Leith comments , 
 " We didn 't want to be too acoustic , or too rocky . I 've been conscious of the people who bought The Winner 's Journey , but also conscious about grabbing a new audience as well ... I think this album 's got all those kind of Winner 's Journey elements – the falsetto and the emotional thing . But it 's got a lot of me in it too . " 
 Damien Leith was also conscious of the lyrics we wrote . He added a few emotional ballads which contained strong lyrics , but had left out the songs he thought were too depressing . 
 Leith spent seven months of recording and writing and worked with Bryon Jones , James Roche and Ross Fraser . Initially , he wanted the album to be released in March , but it was pushed back to August , partly due to the prolonged success of The Winner 's Journey and partly because of the large amount of songs they had to cull . 
 = = Writing and inspiration = = 
 The songs he wrote were inspired by his family and friends . A few of the songs explored the themes of love and fulfilment . " Not Just for the Weekend " was a song he wrote after the birth of his second son , Jagger . The song " Beautiful " is a love song written to his wife Eileen . Other songs in the album explored much darker themes . " Blew It All Away " is a heartfelt song about the suicide of a friend , which happened shortly after another friend died from cancer . Another song , " Alone " was inspired from a friend who was struggling after his father 's death . " Shine Like the Sun " is about a friend in Ireland who was experiencing a rough relationship . 
 Leith wrote or co @-@ wrote a total of nine tracks out of the twelve in the album . Incidentally , the first single and the opening track " 22 Steps " was a song he did not write ; it was written by Canadian singer @-@ songwriter Andy <unk> . Another non @-@ original track Leith recorded was a cover of Fleetwood Mac 's " Songbird " from their album Rumours . This song holds special meaning for Leith , as his sister sang this song during his and Eileen 's wedding . Leith collaborated with Australian writers in a few songs , including Alex Lloyd who co @-@ wrote with Leith the songs " Beautiful " and " Blew It All Away " . They also wrote four other songs which they did not include in the album because they were too alternative . His musical director Paul Gray of Wa Wa Nee co @-@ wrote the track " Alone " . He left out his debut single " Night of My Life " , originally written for his win on Idol , because he could not relate to the lyrics in his everyday life , only within the context of the show . Sony BMG added a raw bonus track , the traditional Irish song " Danny Boy " which Leith did a one @-@ take recording of for a fan . Initially , Leith was hesitant to include it in the album because it was so raw . 
 Damien Leith chose to name the album Where We Land as it described all the things that happened to him in the past year individually and professionally , and also illustrated his journey to Australia in various ways . 
 = = Album and single releases = = 
 Where We Land was officially released on 18 August 2007 in Australia .

The music video for " 22 Steps " premiered on rage on 22 June . The second single , " All I Want Is You " , was released as a non @-@ commercial single ; its music video debuted on rage on 19 October .

 Responses from critics have given mostly average reviews of the album . Polly Coufos from The Sunday Times considers Damien Leith as " the most complete artist Australian Idol has yet uncovered " . Coufos rated the album 3 @.@ 5 stars , and comments that " Leith uses that heavenly falsetto as often as possible without making himself appear a one @-@ trick pony " . Coufos , however says that the two cover songs , " Songbird " and " Danny Boy " are an " unnecessary hedging of bets " . Andrew Murfett from The Age notices the album 's different arrangement from the previous Idol debuts and considers it to be better than those , but says that the album still contains too many ballad songs . Murfett remarks " Songbird " as a good choice for a cover song . Lauren <unk> from ' Oz Music Scene ' compliments Leith 's songwriting and composing , and says that Where We Land " is a great indication of the potential of Australia 's revamped Idol franchise " . Lucy Tyler from the Sydney Anglican Network says that though the album is well @-@ produced ; it is unbalanced and bland , and " its lack of variety means that it gives listeners little to think about " . Tyler notes that Where We Land focuses on the melancholic aspects of life and remarks that " Leith appears to have forgotten that life can sometimes be happy , too " .

 = Tony Parker = 
 William Anthony " Tony " Parker Jr . ( born 17 May 1982 ) is a French professional basketball player for the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . The son of a professional basketball player , Parker played for two years in the French basketball league before entering the 2001 NBA draft . He was selected by the San Antonio Spurs with the 28th overall pick in the draft and quickly became their starting point guard . Parker has helped the Spurs win four NBA championships in 2003 , 2005 , 2007 and 2014 . 
 Employing his pace and high field goal percentage to great effect , Parker has been named to six NBA All @-@ Star games , three All @-@ NBA Second Teams , and an All @-@ NBA Third Team . He was also the 2007 NBA Finals MVP . 
 Playing for the France national basketball team , Parker was named as the EuroBasket 2013 MVP following his team 's victory over Lithuania ( 80 – 66 ) in the gold medal game . The point guard finished as the tournament 's top scorer with 19 points per game . In 2015 he became the all @-@ time leading scorer in the EuroBasket competition . 
 Parker is also a music artist with his own music album , TP . He married actress Eva Longoria on 7 July 2007 . In November 2010 , both parties filed for divorce . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Parker was born in Bruges , Belgium , but raised in France . His father , Tony Parker Sr. , an African American , played basketball at Loyola University Chicago as well as professionally overseas . His mother , Pamela Firestone , is a Dutch model . Parker enjoyed close relationships with his brothers and they would often attend their father 's basketball games together . At first , Parker was more interested in soccer , but after watching the evolution of Michael Jordan into a global basketball superstar during summer trips to his father 's native city of Chicago , he changed his mind . Moreover , Parker 's two younger brothers were also heavily involved in basketball ; T.J. and Pierre would go on to play basketball at college and professional levels . As Parker built his skill , his lack of size ( notwithstanding a growth spurt at 15 ) decided his position on @-@ court . He played the point guard position , recognizing that his speed and agility made this position ideal for him . He was eventually talent @-@ spotted and asked to attend the <unk> in Paris . After playing in the French amateur leagues for two seasons , Parker turned professional and signed with Paris Basket Racing in 1999 . 
 In the summer of 2000 , Parker was invited to the Nike Hoop Summit in Indianapolis . There , in front of professional scouts and college coaches , he competed against the likes of future NBA players Darius Miles , Zach Randolph and Omar Cook . In a contest between the American and European All @-@ Stars , Parker recorded 20 points , seven assists , four rebounds and two steals . The Frenchman 's performance prompted a recruiting war among several colleges , including UCLA and Georgia Tech , who were on the verge of persuading Parker to join them . However , Parker decided to forgo the NCAA and to remain in France ; he spent the next year with Paris Basket Racing in the French League before entering the 2001 NBA draft .

 Before the 2001 NBA draft , Parker was invited to the San Antonio Spurs ' summer camp . Parker 's first experiences were daunting ; coach Gregg Popovich had him play against Spurs scout and ex @-@ NBA player Lance Blanks . Parker was so overwhelmed by Blank 's tough and physical defense that Popovich was ready to send him away after just 10 minutes . But after seeing a " best of " mix tape of Parker 's best plays , Popovich decided to invite Parker a second time . This time , Parker made a better impression against Blanks ; the Frenchman later described Blanks as a " one @-@ man wrecking crew " . But while Popovich decided that Parker was worth the gamble , the Spurs still had to hope that other teams would not pick Parker during the draft . As it happened , Parker 's name was barely mentioned in the pre @-@ draft predictions and the point guard was drafted 28th overall by the Spurs on draft day . 
 After initially playing backup to Antonio Daniels , Parker became a starter and made 77 regular @-@ season appearances in his rookie season , averaging 9 @.@ 2 points , 4 @.@ 3 assists and 2 @.@ 6 rebounds in 29 @.@ 4 minutes per game . When he played against the Los Angeles Clippers on 30 November 2001 , he became the third French player to play in an NBA game , after Tariq Abdul @-@ Wahad and Jerome <unk> . Parker increased the Spurs ' game tempo , getting his teammates better looks at the basket whenever he was involved in transition offense . He could also hit open jump shots , and this created greater space for the big men on the team , Tim Duncan and David Robinson . By the end of the season , the rookie led San Antonio in assists and steals , and was named to the All @-@ Rookie First Team for 2001 – 02 , becoming the first foreign @-@ born guard to earn the honor . Although the Spurs were eliminated during the playoffs , Parker 's performances did not go unnoticed . 
 In 2002 – 03 , Parker played in all 82 regular @-@ season games as San Antonio 's starting point guard on a team that was largely revamped from previous years . He improved his regular season statistics significantly , averaging 15 @.@ 5 points per game ( ppg ) , 5 @.@ 3 assists per game ( apg ) and 2 @.@ 6 rebounds per game ( rpg ) . Parker 's role as the team 's playmaker was reflected in his leading the team in assists on 49 occasions . During the 2003 NBA All @-@ Star Weekend , Parker represented the Sophomores in the Got Milk ? Rookie Challenge , and also participated in the inaugural 989 Sports Skills Challenge . In the post season , the Spurs , led by Tim Duncan , defeated the New Jersey Nets 4 – 2 in the finals , and Parker earned his first NBA championship ring . Despite the victory , Parker struggled with inconsistent play throughout the playoffs , and was often substituted for the more experienced guards Steve Kerr and Speedy Claxton late in the games . Throughout the season , Parker also felt that he was often criticized too harshly by coach Popovich ; in retrospect , coach Popovich admitted he was critical of his young playmaker , stating he wanted Parker to build a thick skin and mature sooner than his peers . 
 = = = = Second championship = = = = 
 Despite winning a championship with the Spurs , doubts lingered over Parker 's future . The Spurs had attempted and failed to acquire New Jersey Nets ' Jason Kidd , but Parker told coach Popovich that he wanted to be San Antonio 's starting point guard and he was ready to work hard to become a great player . Parker played well during the regular season , recording 14 @.@ 7 ppg , 5 @.@ 5 apg and 3 @.@ 2 rpg . However , the Spurs were defeated by perennial rivals Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference semi @-@ finals in the 2004 NBA Playoffs , and the favorites were denied back @-@ to @-@ back titles . 
 During the 2004 – 05 season , Parker recorded improved regular season statistics , tallying 16 @.@ 6 ppg , 6 @.@ 1 apg and a career @-@ high 3 @.@ 7 rpg . He was also ranked 13th in the league in total assists , and was third among point guards in field goal percentage . The Spurs were strong in the playoffs , and Parker was instrumental in the victories over the Denver Nuggets , Seattle SuperSonics and Phoenix Suns . However , Parker struggled in the Finals series against the Detroit Pistons . Spurs colleagues Manu Ginóbili and Brent Barry often took over playmaking duties as Parker was unable to perform as well as he did in the regular season . Pitted against ex @-@ Finals MVP and All @-@ Defensive Team member Chauncey Billups , Parker 's jump shot became inconsistent , and his trademark drives to the hoop were often smothered by the defensively strong Pistons frontcourt anchored by four @-@ time NBA Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace . Nevertheless , with the combination of Tim Duncan 's consistent performances , the emergence of Argentine star Ginóbili , clutch shooting by Robert Horry and Parker operating as playmaker , the Spurs won their third ever NBA championship by defeating the defending champions 4 – 3 in the 2005 NBA Finals . 
 = = = = Third championship = = = = 
 Parker was selected for the first time in his career an NBA All @-@ Star for the 2005 – 06 season as he managed 18 @.@ 9 ppg and an impressive <unk> in field goal percentage . Parker 's scoring average was even higher than Duncan 's , and his form propelled the Spurs to a 63 – 19 win – loss record and qualification for the 2006 NBA Playoffs . However , the top @-@ seeded Spurs were again unable to win back @-@ to @-@ back titles as they were eliminated in the second round by the Dallas Mavericks . 
 On 14 February 2007 , after delivering consistent numbers in the first half of the 2006 – 07 season , Parker was selected to play in the 2007 NBA All @-@ Star Game as a reserve guard . With Parker operating as the starting point guard in the 2006 – 07 season , the Spurs qualified for the 2007 NBA Playoffs and finished second in the Southwest Division . In the Western Conference Semifinals , the Spurs met the Phoenix Suns led by two @-@ time and reigning NBA MVP Steve Nash . In the match @-@ up versus the best point guard of his generation , Parker used his speed to score an easy layup , or hit with his improved mid @-@ range jump shot . Suns coach Mike D 'Antoni even used All @-@ Defensive Team forward Shawn Marion to cover Parker , but the Frenchman used the pick and roll to beat his much bigger counterpart . After eliminating the Suns , the Spurs defeated the Utah Jazz 4 – 1 to win the Western Conference Finals . Parker and the Spurs went on to face the Cleveland Cavaliers and swept them 4 – 0 to win the 2007 NBA Finals . In this series , Parker consistently outplayed his Cavaliers counterparts Daniel Gibson and All @-@ Defensive Team member Larry Hughes and scored a series @-@ high 24 @.@ 5 points , accompanied by a high field goal percentage of 56 @.@ 8 % and of 57 @.@ 1 % from three @-@ point range . For his performances , he was named the 2007 NBA Finals MVP , becoming the first European @-@ born player to receive the award . 
 = = = = Falling short = = = = 
 In the 2007 – 08 regular season , Parker recorded similar averages as the previous two seasons for points and rebounds , and slightly increased his assists per game average . The Spurs finished third in the Western Conference and faced the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the 2008 NBA Playoffs . For the third time in four years , San Antonio prevailed over Phoenix ; Parker had an outstanding first round series , averaging nearly 30 points and 7 assists a game . In the next round against Chris Paul 's New Orleans Hornets , the Spurs dropped the first two road games before responding with a strong win in the third game . In that game , Parker recorded a double @-@ double with 31 points and 11 assists . The experienced Spurs took seven games to defeat the Hornets , but were unable to get past arch @-@ rivals Los Angeles Lakers in the Conference Finals , and the Spurs once again failed to capture back @-@ to @-@ back NBA championships . 
 San Antonio got off to a rocky start in their 2008 – 09 NBA season , losing the first three contests . In their fourth game against the Minnesota Timberwolves , however , Parker scored a career @-@ high 55 points to lead the Spurs to their first victory of the campaign . The Spurs recovered soon enough , and approached the All @-@ Star break ranked second in the Conference . With Parker averaging a career @-@ high in points per game , he was named as a reserve for the 2009 All @-@ Star game . The Spurs were without influential shooting guard Ginóbili for much for the season , and greater responsibility fell on Parker 's shoulders . He helped lead the team to a 54 – 28 record and the third seed for the playoffs , In Game 4 of the first round against Dallas , Parker matched George Gervin 's franchise playoff record for points in a half with 31 . However , the Spurs were put on the back pedal from the start and eventually lost 4 – 1 , bowing out of the playoffs in the first round for the first time since 2000 . Parker 's 28 @.@ 6 points and 4 @.@ 2 rebounds per game broke his previous playoffs career @-@ best averages of 22 @.@ 4 points and 3 @.@ 7 rebounds . On 13 May 2009 , he was named to the All @-@ NBA Third Team . 
 During the 2011 – 12 NBA season , Parker helped the Spurs reach the best record in the West for the second straight season ; the team tied the Chicago Bulls for the best overall record in the league . On 4 February 2012 , Parker became the all @-@ time assist leader of the franchise with 4 @,@ 477 , surpassing Avery Johnson , while adding 42 points in a victory against Oklahoma City Thunder . The Spurs secured their 13th straight 50 win season despite the lockout ( a new NBA record ) , and Parker received his fourth All @-@ Star nod . He finished fifth in MVP award voting , receiving four first @-@ place votes . Late in the season , the Spurs signed Parker 's longtime friend Boris Diaw , who was claimed off waivers from the Charlotte Bobcats , to add energy to the Spurs . In the 2012 NBA Playoffs , Parker averaged 20 @.@ 1 points and 6 @.@ 8 assists as the Spurs swept through the first two rounds , defeating the Utah Jazz and the Los Angeles Clippers . In the Western Conference Finals the Spurs faced the young Oklahoma City Thunder . After winning Game 1 and Game 2 , 101 – 98 and 120 – 111 respectively , and taking a 2 – 0 series lead , the Spurs lost four consecutive games , thus losing the series 4 – 2 . 
 In their second game of the 2012 – 13 season , the Spurs faced the Thunder in a rematch of the previous Western Conference Finals , and Parker hit a game @-@ winner to secure a win for the Spurs . On 10 December 2012 , Parker got his first career triple @-@ double after 825 regular season games against the Houston Rockets in overtime with 27 points , 12 rebounds , and 12 assists . He was the 4th player in NBA history to have gone 800 games or more into their career before their first triple @-@ double , joining Karl Malone ( 860 ) , Patrick Ewing ( 834 ) , and Cedric Maxwell ( 824 ) . Parker was named Western Conference Player of the Month for the month of January 2013 for leading the Spurs to a 12 – 3 record , and the best record in the NBA . He averaged 21 @.@ 9 points per game and 7 @.@ 9 assists per game that month while shooting 56 @.@ 3 % from the field . He became the first Spurs player to receive the honor since Tim Duncan in April 2002 . On May 21 , 2013 , Parker recorded a career high 18 assists to go with 15 points in the Spurs ' Western Conference finals game 2 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies . 
 In game 1 of the 2013 NBA Finals against the defending champion Miami Heat , Parker hit a clutch jump shot off the glass with 5 @.@ 2 seconds remaining in the game , securing a 92 – 88 victory for San Antonio . In Game 6 , Parker hit a clutch game @-@ tying 3 pointer with 1 : 27 remaining in regulation , but the Spurs lost the game in overtime . The Spurs eventually lost the series in seven games .

 Standing at 6 feet 2 inches tall ( 1 @.@ 88 m ) and weighing 185 pounds ( 84 kg ) , Parker plays the point guard position and has established himself as a potent offensive player . Voted by his peers in a 2007 poll as one of the quickest players in the NBA , he often slashes to the basket for a layup or teardrop shot . Despite his relatively small size for a basketball player , he led the league in " points in the paint " for a large portion of the 2005 – 06 season . 
 In the initial part of his NBA career , Parker was still considered an erratic shooter of the ball and during the 2005 off @-@ season , coach Popovich decided to work on this aspect of his play . Seeing his mediocre shooting percentages ( at that point , Parker only hit 65 % of his free throws , and only 27 @.@ 6 % of his three @-@ point shots ) , he let him train extra sessions with Spurs shooting coach Chip Engelland . Engelland forbade Parker to shoot any three @-@ point shots , and among others , corrected his shooting motion and his thumb position . As a result , by the 2006 – 07 season , Parker had reduced his three @-@ point shots by 117 while shooting 147 more normal field goal attempts compared to 2005 , and his accuracy rose by 4 % ( field goals and three @-@ point shots ) and he was able to connect on 78 % of his free throws that season . Parker 's field goal percentage is also high for a point guard , and his speed also makes him a fast break player . However , his style of play has had adverse effects on his knees ( tendinitis ) .

 Parker met actress Eva Longoria , seven years his senior , in November 2004 . In August 2005 , Longoria confirmed she and Parker were dating , and on 30 November 2006 , the couple became engaged . Longoria , a Texas native from nearby Corpus Christi , was a courtside regular at Spurs home games . Parker was quoted during the 2007 NBA All @-@ Star Game saying that , " Eva is doing everything , I 'm just going to show up and say yes . " They were officially married in a civil service on 6 July 2007 , at a Paris city hall . It was followed by a full Roman Catholic wedding ceremony at the Saint @-@ Germain l <unk> Church in Paris , France , on 7 July 2007 . Fellow Frenchman NBA player ( and future teammate ) Boris Diaw was Parker 's best man for the wedding . 
 In December 2007 , tabloid websites and magazines reported that Parker had been having an extramarital affair with supposed model Alexandra <unk> .

" 
 On 17 November 2010 , Longoria filed for divorce in Los Angeles , citing " irreconcilable differences " , and seeking spousal support from Parker . The couple had a prenuptial agreement that was signed in June 2007 , the month before their wedding , and amended two years later in June 2009 . Longoria believed that Parker had been cheating on her with another woman ; .

 = The X @-@ Files ( season 5 ) = 
 The fifth season of the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files commenced airing on the Fox network in the United States on November 2 , 1997 , concluding on the same channel on May 17 , 1998 , and contained 20 episodes . The season was the last in Vancouver , Canada ; subsequent episodes would be shot in Los Angeles , California . In addition , this was the first season of the show where the course of the story was planned , due to the 1998 The X @-@ Files feature film being filmed before it , but scheduled to be released after it aired . 
 The fifth season of the series focused heavily on FBI federal agents Fox Mulder 's ( David Duchovny ) loss of faith in the existence of extraterrestrials and his partner , Dana Scully 's ( Gillian Anderson ) , resurgence of health following her bout with cancer . New characters were also introduced , including agents Jeffrey Spender ( Chris Owens ) and Diana Fowley ( Mimi Rogers ) and the psychic Gibson Praise ( Jeff Gulka ) . The finale , " The End " , led up to both the 1998 film and the sixth season premiere " The Beginning " . 
 Debuting with high viewing figures and ranking as the eleventh most watched television series during the 1997 – 98 television year in the United States , the season was a success , with figures averaging around 20 million viewers an episode . This made it the year 's highest @-@ rated Fox program as well as the highest rated season of The X @-@ Files to air . Critical reception from television critics was generally positive . 
 = = Plot overview = = 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . At the end of fourth season , Scully is dying of cancer . Mulder is convinced that her condition is a result of her earlier abduction , and is prepared to make a deal with the Syndicate to find a cure . While being pursued by an assassin responsible for a hoax alien corpse discovered on a mountaintop , Mulder fakes his own suicide , mutilating the assassin 's face to provide a decoy body . In the fifth season opener " Redux " , he uses the distraction to infiltrate The Pentagon to find a cure for Scully 's cancer , while Scully is able to uncover and reveal a Syndicate connection within the FBI . Due to the information he learns from Michael Kritschgau ( John Finn ) , Mulder loses his belief in extraterrestrials . 
 Later , as a rebel alien race secretly attacks several groups of former alien abductees , the agents meet Cassandra Spender ( Veronica Cartwright ) , a woman who claims to be a multiple abductee and wants to deliver a positive message about aliens . Eventually , Mulder has Scully put under hypnosis to learn the truth about her abduction after Cassandra goes missing and her son , Jeffrey Spender ( Chris Owens ) , angrily attempts to push his way up in the FBI . The Syndicate , meanwhile , quicken their tests for the black oil vaccine , sacrificing their own to do so . Later , the assassination of a chess grandmaster leads Mulder and Scully into an investigation that they soon discover strikes at the heart of the X @-@ Files ; they learn that the real target was a telepathic boy named Gibson Praise ( Jeff Gulka ) .

 Due to the pending release of The X @-@ Files feature film , this was the first season where the course of the season was planned in advance , as it had to set up for the film . Originally , the season was supposed to be the show 's last . In this manner , the finale was originally supposed to have segued the television series into a movie franchise . David Duchovny explained , " we were saying , ' Okay , we 're going to do five . We 'll get out of here at five . ' And then five came around , and no one was going anywhere . " The series proved to be so lucrative for Fox that two additional seasons were ordered . Thus , the season was created in a way to segue into the 1998 film , as well as the sixth season premiere , " The Beginning " . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Due to the necessity of filming reshoots for the upcoming movie , both Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny are absent in places throughout the season . For instance , the episodes " Unusual Suspects " and " Travelers " — both of which being flashback episodes — do not feature Anderson 's character Dana Scully at all . In fact , the former was written entirely as a stop @-@ gap episode when the show 's producers were forced to start production of the fifth season in the last week of August in Vancouver , but still needed series stars Duchovny and Anderson for the filming of The X @-@ Files movie in Los Angeles . The producers decided to create an episode dedicated to The Lone Gunmen , and writing duties were assigned to Vince Gilligan . Other episodes such as " Chinga " and " Christmas Carol " feature minimal appearances by Duchovny 's character Fox Mulder . 
 The season 's fifth episode , " The Post @-@ Modern Prometheus " , written and directed by Carter , was filmed entirely in black @-@ and @-@ white — in homage to James Whale 's 1931 film version of Frankenstein . The director of photography , Joel Ransom , had to spend longer than usual lighting each scene because of the grayscale . The stormy skies in the episode , added to emulate the atmosphere of old Frankenstein movies , were a visual effect . Carter also used a wide @-@ angle camera lens throughout the episode , which forced the actors to act directly to the camera , rather than to each other . According to Carter , it also enabled him to give scenes in the episode a more surreal staging than was usual for the show . 
 This season finale , " The End " , was the last episode of the series to be filmed in Vancouver , Canada prior to production moving to Los Angeles , although the second film in the franchise , The X @-@ Files : I Want to Believe , released in 2008 , was once more filmed in Vancouver . The move was influenced in part by Duchovny , who after five years of filming wanted to be closer to his wife . The audience at the chess match was made up of local fans as a " thank you " to the city for hosting the production during its first five years . The chess match was filmed at Rogers Arena — then known as GM Place — the home of the Vancouver Canucks as well as the Vancouver Grizzlies at the time . While the producers expected five thousand people to show up , twelve thousand appeared . Instructions were given to the crowd by director R. W. Goodwin using giant video screens attached to the scoreboard . During breaks between shooting concession stands , music and videos were made available to the attendees . Actors Duchovny and Anderson also answered questions for the audience and over $ 20 @,@ 000 worth of equipment was raffled off . Series creator Chris Carter directed the second unit filming for the episode in order to be with the show 's Canadian crew members .

 = Hurricane Emily ( 1993 ) = 
 Hurricane Emily in 1993 caused record flooding in the Outer Banks of North Carolina while remaining just offshore . The fifth named storm and first hurricane of the year 's hurricane season , Emily developed from a tropical wave northeast of the Lesser Antilles on August 22 . It moved northwestward and strengthened into a tropical storm on August 25 , after becoming nearly stationary southeast of Bermuda . Emily then curved to the southwest but quickly resumed its northwest trajectory while strengthening into a hurricane . Late on August 31 , the hurricane reached peak winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) on its approach to North Carolina . Although part of the eye passed over Hatteras Island in the Outer Banks , its absolute center remained 23 mi ( 37 km / h ) offshore . Gradually weakening , the hurricane swerved away from the coast toward the northeast and later east . Emily stalled again , this time northeast of Bermuda , and dissipated on September 6 to the southeast of Newfoundland . 
 The threat of Emily prompted hurricane warnings for much of the North Carolina coast and northward through Delaware . A mandatory evacuation for Ocracoke and Hatteras islands displaced 160 @,@ 000 people during the busy Labor Day weekend ; the loss in tourism revenue amounted to $ 10 million ( 1993 USD ) . About 1 @,@ 600 residents on these islands rode out the storm in their homes , and emergency officials stayed behind . Most of the evacuees went to hotels or stayed with friends or relatives , causing an increase in business across southeastern Virginia , where effects were minimal . Due to uncertainty in forecasting Emily 's path , there were also evacuations from the coasts of Virginia , Maryland , Delaware , and Fire Island in New York . 
 While bypassing the Outer Banks , Emily produced strong winds that coincided with high tides during a full moon , causing severe flooding along the Pamlico Sound . In Buxton , the floods left behind water marks as high as 10 @.@ 54 ft ( 3 @.@ 21 m ) , and the entire villages of Avon and Hatteras were inundated . The storm downed thousands of trees and wrecked 553 homes — 168 of which completely destroyed — leaving a quarter of the Cape Hatteras population homeless . Structural damage in North Carolina was estimated at $ 35 million . Along the coasts of North Carolina and Virginia , three swimmers drowned as a result of Emily . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Hurricane Emily originated from an African tropical wave that passed through the Cape Verde Islands on August 17 , 1993 . The wave traversed the tropical Atlantic and developed a closed cyclonic circulation five days later about 800 miles ( 1 @,@ 300 km ) east @-@ northeast of Puerto Rico , when the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) classified it as a tropical depression . Moving northwestward , the depression remained poorly organized for several days , with an ill @-@ defined circulation center and sporadic thunderstorms , in part due to unfavorable wind shear from an upper @-@ level low to its north . On August 25 , the depression became nearly stationary in response to weakening steering currents . As the upper environment turned less hostile to development , a reconnaissance aircraft found unusually high sustained winds — an indication that the cyclone had quickly strengthened into a strong tropical storm . The NHC named the storm Emily and upgraded it to a hurricane the following day , based on reports of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) winds from a second reconnaissance mission . 
 Upon becoming a hurricane , Emily was centered roughly 1 @,@ 000 mi ( 1 @,@ 600 km ) east of the Florida peninsula , passing well south of Bermuda . A ridge of high pressure began to mature to its north , forcing the hurricane westward on August 27 . Emily 's winds vacillated between tropical storm and hurricane force over the course of the day , although the cyclone resumed its strengthening by August 28 upon developing favorable upper @-@ level outflow . Traversing warm sea surface temperatures , the hurricane continued to improve in appearance on satellite images , and the barometric pressure within its eye steadily decreased . Emily retraced toward the northwest on August 29 , when a shortwave trough eroded the southern periphery of the contiguous ridge . The NHC expressed uncertainty in forecasting Emily 's track , stating that South Carolina , North Carolina , and Mid @-@ Atlantic states were at risk of a direct hit from the hurricane . As high pressure re @-@ established itself off the North Carolina coast , Emily briefly turned west @-@ northwestward on August 30 before initiating a prolonged curve toward the north . By that time , the NHC forecast Emily to remain offshore , though one tropical cyclone forecast model projected that the hurricane would move inland . 
 Early on August 31 , a reconnaissance flight indicated that Emily had become a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson scale , and further intensification was expected because of warm waters . Later that day , reconnaissance reported that Emily had achieved a peak intensity of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) , a Category 3 major hurricane ; the aircraft also observed flight @-@ level winds of 152 mph ( 245 km / h ) . At its peak , the center of the hurricane was located 23 mi ( 37 km ) east of Hatteras Island while turning northward . Its eye measured 45 mi ( 75 km ) in diameter , and a portion moved over Hatteras and the Pamlico Sound , constituting a direct hit but not a landfall . After affecting the Outer Banks , Emily continued around the large high @-@ pressure area , turning northeastward into an area with cooler ocean temperatures . The eye nonetheless remained distinct , and Emily maintained much of its intensity through September 2 . Later that day , the hurricane turned sharply eastward in response to a trough nearby . Wind shear over the region increased , weakening Emily as its eye feature quickly dissipated . Emily turned to the southeast and diminished to a tropical storm on September 3 , about 500 mi ( 800 km ) northeast of Bermuda , with a significant deterioration of the convection . Once again becoming nearly stationary , Emily further weakened to a tropical depression late on September 4 , after only a small area of thunderstorms remained near the center . It accelerated toward the northeast and became extratropical on September 6 , dissipating shortly thereafter . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 The NHC forecasts for Emily were generally accurate . On August 29 , two days before the storm 's closest approach , the NHC issued a hurricane watch from Cape Romain , South Carolina , to Fenwick Island , Delaware , including the Albemarle and Pamlico sounds of North Carolina as well as the Chesapeake Bay south of the Patuxent River . The next day , the watch was discontinued south of Little River , South Carolina . A hurricane warning was issued from Bogue Inlet to the border of North Carolina and Virginia on August 30 , and was extended a day later to Cape Henlopen , Delaware . The watches and warnings were canceled as Emily turned out to sea . 
 During the week when Emily approached shore , the North Carolina government was scheduled to have a two @-@ day emergency management exercise involving a hurricane strike ; the storm caused the exercise to be postponed . On August 29 , a voluntary evacuation was issued for the Outer Banks , and within 36 hours of the storm 's approach , a mandatory evacuation was issued for Ocracoke and Hatteras Island . A total of 160 @,@ 000 people ( mostly tourists ) evacuated from the Outer Banks , representing about 90 % of the population there . The evacuation was completed within 12 hours , expedited by highway patrol and making U.S. Route 158 and the Wright Memorial Bridge only one direction , away from the coast . About 1 @,@ 000 residents on Hatteras Island and another 600 on Ocracoke rode out the storm in their homes . The United States Coast Guard evacuated personnel to the mainland , leaving behind a skeleton crew to maintain their facilities . The National Park Service closed the campground on Ocracoke two days before the storm . Several towns in southeastern North Carolina were also evacuated , and schools closed across the region . 
 Because of the uncertainty in forecasting when and if Emily would make its northeast turn , Virginia Governor Douglas Wilder declared a state of emergency and put the National Guard on alert . In Virginia Beach , residents of seaside homes and low @-@ lying areas were recommended to evacuate , while a mandatory evacuation was ordered for Tangier Island in the Chesapeake Bay . Residents in mobile homes and on campgrounds were also advised to seek shelter . At least 750 people left their homes , 711 of whom resided in storm shelters . The Norfolk International Airport was closed for 13 hours , and rail service was suspended . To the north , officials in Ocean City , Maryland , declared a phase @-@ one emergency ahead of the storm ; beaches were closed , and tourists were recommended to leave . About 100 @,@ 000 people evacuated from the coast of Maryland ; 3 @,@ 600 stayed in storm shelters . In Delaware , 892 people used storm shelters after voluntarily evacuating . Beaches in New Jersey closed due to threatening waves . About 20 @,@ 000 people also evacuated from Fire Island , New York . Across the Atlantic coast , 33 emergency shelters were opened in response to Emily , though most evacuees instead relied on hotels or the homes of friends and relatives to ride out the storm . 
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) assisted in coordinating preparations for Emily . The United States Department of Defense sent power equipment , previously used during the Great Flood of 1993 , to Fort Bragg , while the United States Department of Agriculture stockpiled food in risk zones . Power companies deliberately shut off the power in the Outer Banks to reduce damage to the system and mitigate the risk of electrocutions . At Naval Station Norfolk , 28 ships sailed out to sea to ride out the storm ; aircraft were evacuated , and nonessential personnel were sent home . The North Carolina government announced ahead of the storm that it would not create a State Disaster Fund , instead relying on private relief organizations such as the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army . The state 's park service pre @-@ positioned 60 members with chainsaws to help clear downed trees . Because Emily hit during the busy Labor Day weekend , the tourism industry suffered about $ 10 million in business losses . Many of the evacuees relocated to southeastern Virginia , which saw greatly increased business during the weekend . 
 = = Impact = = 
 = = = North Carolina = = = 
 As Emily approached the Outer Banks of North Carolina , Diamond Shoal Light off Cape Hatteras recorded 2 @-@ minute sustained winds of 99 mph ( 159 km / h ) , along with gusts of 147 mph ( 237 km / h ) . Closer to shore , surface winds reached 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) in the Pamlico Sound . The National Weather Service in Buxton reported sustained winds of 60 mph ( 96 km / h ) , with gusts to 98 mph ( 158 km / h ) , before the wind recording instrument failed due to water intrusion . A reliable but unofficial wind station at a commercial building reported a gust of 107 mph ( 172 km / h ) . These high winds lasted for several hours due to the storm 's slow movement . There were two possible tornadoes in the Outer Banks region . On the south side of Hatteras Island , the storm coincided with high tides , producing a peak storm surge of 10 @.@ 2 ft ( 3 @.@ 1 m ) in Buxton . Large waves caused moderate beach erosion , comparable to that of a winter storm . The heaviest rainfall related to Emily occurred over the Outer Banks , where a peak total of 7 @.@ 51 in ( 191 mm ) was recorded in Buxton . Minimal rain fell farther inland , with only 1 @.@ 00 in ( 25 mm ) reported at Gum Neck in mainland Tyrrell County . 
 Overall damage from the storm was lighter than expected , largely confined to the barrier islands of Dare and Hyde counties . Severe flooding from the storm affected a 17 mi ( 27 km ) stretch of the Hatteras Island . Coinciding with high tides during a full moon , the hurricane 's winds pushed water from the Pamlico Sound to the south , lowering levels along the mainland and inundating the barrier islands ; surge flooding was minor on the ocean side . At Frisco and Hatteras , water levels along the Pamlico Sound reached 8 @.@ 5 ft ( 2 @.@ 6 m ) above normal — their highest in the 20th century , surpassing those in Hurricane Gloria eight years prior . These water levels may have been the highest in the region since the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane . In Buxton , the waters rose 3 to 4 ft ( 0 @.@ 9 to 1 m ) per hour at one point , leaving behind flood marks as high as 10 @.@ 54 ft ( 3 @.@ 21 m ) . The entire villages of Avon and Hatteras were inundated . Only the highest dunes along the Cape Hatteras National Seashore remained dry , and a section of dunes just north of Buxton was nearly breached . The waters — 1 to 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 3 to 0 @.@ 6 m ) higher than the predicted 100 @-@ year flood — broke through windows and entered houses ; some residents who did not exit their homes had to ride out the storm in their attics to escape the flooding . Officials at the Dare County Emergency Operations Center evacuated due to intrusion of floodwaters . The Cape Hatteras National Weather Service office was flooded for the first time since its inception in 1957 , and sustained damage to its rain chart and an antenna . Many boats in marinas were wrecked , and hundreds of cars floated away from parking lots or streets ; flooded police cars had their emergency lights activated after the wires were damaged . Farther south , impact from the storm was limited on Ocracoke Island . 
 Emily 's winds destroyed several roofs and knocked down thousands of trees and power lines , with many signs and sheds damaged . All towns south of the Bonner Bridge were without power , affecting at least 1 @,@ 500 people , and Buxton lost water supply after the main water line was damaged . The combination of strong winds and floods left 553 homes uninhabitable in the Outer Banks , with 168 houses completely destroyed , including three that were washed away . Six of the destroyed homes were owned by the Coast Guard . The heaviest damage was largely in older homes or structures not up to code . About 25 % of the Hatteras population was left homeless . The Cape Hatteras School sustained about $ 3 @.@ 1 million in damage , after flooding 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) deep destroyed computers and textbooks . Tidal floods , sand , and debris forced authorities to close Highway 12 . Traffic lights along the route were damaged , and downed trees blocked the road in two areas . <unk> , some the size of three cars , developed along the route . Throughout North Carolina , damage from the storm was estimated at $ 35 million , mostly on Hatteras Island and chiefly to the south of Avon . Rough surf killed two people in Nags Head , despite the beach being closed to swimming , and one person suffered injuries while escaping a flooded home . 
 = = = Elsewhere = = = 
 Outside of North Carolina , Emily produced gusts of 37 mph ( 59 km ) at the Chesapeake Bay Bridge – Tunnel . To the north of the storm , Ocean City , Maryland , measured 2 @.@ 80 in ( 71 mm ) of precipitation . Above @-@ normal tides were reported as far south as Charleston , South Carolina ; high tides also spread farther north , with a storm surge of 1 @.@ 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 37 m ) at the Chesapeake Bay Bridge – Tunnel and 0 @.@ 6 ft ( 0 @.@ 18 m ) in Lewes , Delaware . 
 High waves caused beach erosion northward through Virginia . At Virginia Beach , the waves led to minor flooding along the Sandbridge section ; rough surf and a strong undertow drowned one swimmer there . The storm triggered statewide power outages that affected about 5 @,@ 000 residents , as well as the Hampton Roads Bridge – Tunnel . In Newport News , lightning set a roof on fire in the Lee Hall section of the city . Emily 's light rains in the area were not enough to break a prolonged drought that plagued Virginia . Rough seas and high tides later caused coastal flooding along Fire Island in New York . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 As Emily 's winds eased over land , various assessment teams left Fort Bragg , North Carolina , to determine the extent of damage . FEMA informed the North Carolina congressional delegation about the storm 's threat to their constituents . The agency later received compliments for their timely preparations for storm @-@ related operations . All airports on the Outer Banks were reopened by September 1 . In response to the extensive scale of the power outages , power companies flew a helicopter over the region to assess the damage . The power was expected to be out for two weeks . Six emergency vehicles were sent to Dare County to provide drinking water . 
 On September 3 , Governor Jim Hunt declared a state of disaster for North Carolina , while President Bill Clinton declared Dare County a disaster area a week later . This allowed residents there to apply for federal assistance , as well as local governments to request aid to rebuild public buildings . Operating out of Avon , FEMA distributed about $ 1 million in housing assistance to 444 people and provided $ 400 @,@ 000 in individual grants to 153 applicants . The Small Business Administration received 812 applications for small business loans . 
 Shelters closed by September 1 and residents returned to their homes , although Hatteras Island remained off @-@ limits to everyone but emergency workers for several days . Unemployment across Hatteras rose in the wake of the damage to local businesses , and many restaurants lost product when their refrigerators failed during the power outages . Residents piled debris from their damaged homes on roads , primarily Highway 12 , and workers responded by clearing the debris . The highway was speedily reopened and repaired at a cost of around $ 1 million . Within two weeks of the storm , businesses resumed as cleaning work was under way , and the island was reopened to tourists . Clean @-@ up operations in the region lasted weeks to months . In the three months after the storm , saltwater intrusion into the Cape Hatteras water supply boosted chlorine levels from 40 milligrams ( 0 @.@ 0014 ounces ) to 280 milligrams ( 0 @.@ 01 ounces ) per liter ; it took another three months for the chlorine to decrease to normal concentrations . Around 50 homeowners affected by Emily raised their houses to prevent a recurrence , partially funded by flood insurance payments . 
 = Romanus ( bishop of Rochester ) = 
 Romanus ( died before 627 ) was the second bishop of Rochester and presumably was a member of the Gregorian mission sent to Kent to Christianize the Anglo @-@ Saxons from their native Anglo @-@ Saxon paganism . Romanus was consecrated bishop around 624 and died before 627 by drowning . Little is known of his life beyond these facts . 
 = = Career = = 
 Presumably Romanus came to England with Augustine of Canterbury 's mission to Kent , He would have arrived either in 597 with the first group of missionaries , or in 601 with the second group . He was consecrated as bishop by his predecessor Justus in 624 , after Justus became Archbishop of Canterbury . He was the second bishop at Rochester . 
 Romanus died before 627 , probably about 625 . He drowned in the Mediterranean Sea off Italy while on a mission to Rome for Justus . Presumably this happened before Justus ' death in 627 . He was certainly dead by 633 , when Paulinus of York became bishop at Rochester after fleeing Northumbria . 
 Nothing else is known of Romanus ' life beyond these facts . The medieval writer Bede is the main source of information , as Romanus is mentioned twice in the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum ; the first time in connection with his consecration , where Bede says that Justus " consecrated Romanus as Bishop of Rochester in his place " . The second mention concerns Romanus ' death after Paulinus had left Northumbria . Bede says that " [ a ] t this time , the church of Rochester was in great need of a pastor , since Romanus its bishop who had been sent by Archbishop Justus to Pope Honorius I as his representative , had been drowned at sea off Italy . " Romanus is further mentioned in both the Winchester Manuscript ( Version A ) and the Peterborough Manuscript ( Version E ) of the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , but the reference is not likely to be contemporary and probably draws on Bede for its information . 
 = William III of England = 
 William III ( Dutch : Willem III ; 4 November 1650 – 8 March 1702 ) was sovereign Prince of Orange from birth , Stadtholder of Holland , Zeeland , Utrecht , Gelderland , and Overijssel in the Dutch Republic from 1672 , and King of England , Ireland , and Scotland from 1689 until his death . It is a coincidence that his regnal number ( III ) was the same for both Orange and England . As King of Scotland , he is known as William II . He is informally known by sections of the population in Northern Ireland and Scotland as " King Billy " . 
 William inherited the principality of Orange from his father , William II , who died a week before William 's birth . His mother Mary , Princess Royal , was the daughter of King Charles I of England . In 1677 , he married his fifteen @-@ year @-@ old first cousin , Mary , the daughter of his maternal uncle James , Duke of York . 
 A Protestant , William participated in several wars against the powerful Catholic king of France , Louis XIV , in coalition with Protestant and Catholic powers in Europe . Many Protestants heralded him as a champion of their faith . In 1685 , his Catholic father @-@ in @-@ law , James , became king of England , Ireland and Scotland . James 's reign was unpopular with the Protestant majority in Britain . William , supported by a group of influential British political and religious leaders , invaded England in what became known as the " Glorious Revolution " . On 5 November 1688 , he landed at the southern English port of Brixham . James was deposed and William and Mary became joint sovereigns in his place . They reigned together until her death on 28 December 1694 , after which William ruled as sole monarch . 
 William 's reputation as a strong Protestant enabled him to take the British crowns when many were fearful of a revival of Catholicism under James . William 's victory at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 is still commemorated by the Orange Order . His reign in Britain marked the beginning of the transition from the personal rule of the Stuarts to the more Parliament @-@ centred rule of the House of Hanover . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Birth and family = = = 
 William III was born in The Hague in the Dutch Republic on 4 November 1650 . Baptised William Henry , he was the only child of stadtholder William II , Prince of Orange , and Mary , Princess Royal . Mary was the eldest daughter of King Charles I of England , Scotland and Ireland , and sister of King Charles II and King James II . 
 Eight days before William was born , his father died of smallpox ; thus William was the Sovereign Prince of Orange from the moment of his birth . Immediately , a conflict ensued between his mother the Princess Royal and William II 's mother , Amalia of Solms @-@ Braunfels , over the name to be given to the infant . Mary wanted to name him Charles after her brother , but her mother @-@ in @-@ law insisted on giving him the name William or Willem to bolster his prospects of becoming stadtholder . William II had appointed his wife as his son 's guardian in his will ; however , the document remained unsigned at William II 's death and was void . On 13 August 1651 , the Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland ( Supreme Court ) ruled that guardianship would be shared between his mother , his paternal grandmother and Frederick William , the Elector of Brandenburg , whose wife , Louise Henriette , was William II 's eldest sister . 
 = = = Childhood and education = = = 
 William 's mother showed little personal interest in her son , sometimes being absent for years , and had always deliberately kept herself apart from Dutch society . William 's education was first laid in the hands of several Dutch governesses , some of English descent , including <unk> Howard and the Scottish noblewoman , Lady Anna Mackenzie . From April 1656 , the prince received daily instruction in the Reformed religion from the Calvinist preacher Cornelis <unk> , a follower of the Contra @-@ <unk> theologian <unk> <unk> . The ideal education for William was described in Discours sur la <unk> de S. H. Monseigneur le Prince d <unk> , a short treatise , perhaps by one of William 's tutors , Constantijn Huygens . In these lessons , the prince was taught that he was predestined to become an instrument of Divine Providence , fulfilling the historical destiny of the House of Orange . 
 From early 1659 , William spent seven years at the University of Leiden for a formal education , under the guidance of ethics professor Hendrik <unk> ( though never officially enrolling as a student ) . While residing in the <unk> at Delft , William had a small personal retinue including Hans Willem Bentinck , and a new governor , Frederick Nassau de Zuylenstein , who ( as an illegitimate son of stadtholder Frederick Henry of Orange ) was his paternal uncle . 
 Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt and his uncle Cornelis de Graeff pushed the States of Holland to take charge of William 's education and ensure that he would acquire the skills to serve in a future — though undetermined — state function ; the States acted on 25 September 1660 . This first involvement of the authorities did not last long . On 23 December 1660 , when William was 10 years old , his mother died of smallpox at Whitehall Palace , London , while visiting her brother King Charles II . In her will , Mary requested that Charles look after William 's interests , and Charles now demanded the States of Holland end their interference . To appease Charles , they complied on 30 September 1661 . That year , Zuylenstein began to work for Charles and induced William to write letters to his uncle asking him to help William become stadtholder someday . After his mother 's death , William 's education and guardianship became a point of contention between his dynasty 's supporters and the advocates of a more republican Netherlands . 
 The Dutch authorities did their best at first to ignore these intrigues , but in the Second Anglo @-@ Dutch War one of Charles 's peace conditions was the improvement of the position of his nephew . As a countermeasure in 1666 , when William was 16 , the States officially made him a ward of the government , or a " Child of State " . All pro @-@ English courtiers , including Zuylenstein , were removed from William 's company . William begged de Witt to allow Zuylenstein to stay , but he refused . De Witt , the leading politician of the Republic , took William 's education into his own hands , instructing him weekly in state matters — and joining him in a regular game of real tennis . 
 = = Early offices = = 
 = = = Exclusion from <unk> = = = 
 After the death of William 's father , most provinces had left the office of stadtholder vacant . At the demand of Oliver Cromwell , the Treaty of Westminster , which ended the First Anglo @-@ Dutch War , had a secret annexe that required the Act of Seclusion , which forbade the province of Holland from appointing a member of the House of Orange as stadtholder . After the English Restoration , the Act of Seclusion , which had not remained a secret for very long , was declared void as the English Commonwealth ( with which the treaty had been concluded ) no longer existed . In 1660 , Mary and Amalia tried to persuade several provincial States to designate William as their future stadtholder , but they all initially refused . 
 In 1667 , as William III approached the age of 18 , the Orangist party again attempted to bring him to power by securing for him the offices of stadtholder and Captain @-@ General . To prevent the restoration of the influence of the House of Orange , de Witt , the leader of the States Party , allowed the <unk> of Haarlem , Gaspar Fagel , to induce the States of Holland to issue the Perpetual Edict . The Edict declared that the Captain @-@ General or Admiral @-@ General of the Netherlands could not serve as stadtholder in any province . Even so , William 's supporters sought ways to enhance his prestige and , on 19 September 1668 , the States of Zeeland appointed him as First Noble . To receive this honour , William had to escape the attention of his state tutors and travel secretly to Middelburg . A month later , Amalia allowed William to manage his own household and declared him to be of majority age . 
 The province of Holland , the center of anti @-@ <unk> , abolished the office of stadtholder and four other provinces followed suit in March 1670 , establishing the so @-@ called " Harmony " . De Witt demanded an oath from each Holland regent ( city council member ) to uphold the Edict ; all but one complied . William saw all this as a defeat , but the arrangement was a compromise : de Witt would have preferred to ignore the prince completely , but now his eventual rise to the office of supreme army commander was implicit . De Witt further conceded that William would be admitted as a member of the Raad van State , the Council of State , then the generality organ administering the defence budget . William was introduced to the council on 31 May 1670 with full voting rights , despite de Witt 's attempts to limit his role to that of an advisor . 
 = = = Conflict with republicans = = = 
 In November 1670 , William obtained permission to travel to England to urge Charles to pay back at least a part of the 2 @,@ 797 @,@ 859 guilder debt the House of Stuart owed the House of Orange . Charles was unable to pay , but William agreed to reduce the amount owed to 1 @,@ 800 @,@ 000 guilders . Charles found his nephew to be a dedicated Calvinist and patriotic Dutchman , and reconsidered his desire to show him the Secret Treaty of Dover with France , directed at destroying the Dutch Republic and installing William as " sovereign " of a Dutch rump state . In addition to differing political outlooks , William found that his lifestyle differed from his uncles , Charles and James , who were more concerned with drinking , gambling , and cavorting with mistresses . 
 The following year , the Republic 's security deteriorated quickly as an Anglo @-@ French attack became imminent . In view of the threat , the States of Gelderland wanted William to be appointed Captain @-@ General of the Dutch States Army as soon as possible , despite his youth and inexperience . On 15 December 1671 , the States of Utrecht made this their official policy . On 19 January 1672 , the States of Holland made a <unk> : to appoint William for just a single campaign . The prince refused this and on 25 February a compromise was reached : an appointment by the States General for one summer , followed by a permanent appointment on his 22nd birthday . 
 Meanwhile , William had written a secret letter to Charles in January 1672 asking his uncle to exploit the situation by exerting pressure on the States to appoint William stadtholder . In return , William would ally the Republic with England and serve Charles 's interests as much as his " honour and the loyalty due to this state " allowed . Charles took no action on the proposal , and continued his war plans with his French ally . 
 = = Becoming stadtholder = = 
 = = = " Disaster year " : 1672 = = = 
 For the Dutch Republic , 1672 proved calamitous . It became known as the <unk> ( " disaster year " ) , because in the Franco @-@ Dutch War and the Third Anglo @-@ Dutch War the Netherlands was invaded by France and its allies : England , Münster , and Cologne . Although the Anglo @-@ French fleet was disabled by the Battle of Solebay , in June the French army quickly overran the provinces of Gelderland and Utrecht . On 14 June , William withdrew with the remnants of his field army into Holland , where the States had ordered the flooding of the Dutch Water Line on 8 June . Louis XIV of France , believing the war was over , began negotiations to extract as large a sum of money from the Dutch as possible . The presence of a large French army in the heart of the Republic caused a general panic , and the people turned against de Witt and his allies . 
 On 4 July , the States of Holland appointed William stadtholder , and he took the oath five days later . The next day , a special envoy from Charles II , Lord Arlington , met with William in <unk> and presented a proposal from Charles . In return for William 's capitulation to England and France , Charles would make William Sovereign Prince of Holland , instead of stadtholder ( a mere civil servant ) . When William refused , Arlington threatened that William would witness the end of the Republic 's existence . William answered famously : " There is one way to avoid this : to die defending it in the last ditch . " On 7 July , the inundations were complete and the further advance of the French army was effectively blocked . On 16 July , Zeeland offered the <unk> to William . 
 Johan de Witt had been unable to function as Grand Pensionary after being wounded by an attempt on his life on 21 June . On 15 August , William published a letter from Charles , in which the English king stated that he had made war because of the aggression of the de Witt faction . The people thus incited , de Witt and his brother , Cornelis , were murdered by an Orangist civil militia in The Hague on 20 August . Subsequently , William replaced many of the Dutch regents with his followers . 
 Though William 's complicity in the lynching has never been proved ( and some 19th @-@ century Dutch historians have made an effort to disprove that he was an accessory ) he thwarted attempts to prosecute the ringleaders , and even rewarded some , like Hendrik <unk> , with money , and others , like Johan van <unk> and Johan <unk> , with high offices . This damaged his reputation in the same fashion as his later actions at Glencoe . 
 William continued to fight against the invaders from England and France , allying himself with Spain and Brandenburg . In November 1672 , he took his army to Maastricht to threaten the French supply lines . By 1673 , the Dutch situation further improved . Although Louis took Maastricht and William 's attack against Charleroi failed , Lieutenant @-@ Admiral Michiel de Ruyter defeated the Anglo @-@ French fleet three times , forcing Charles to end England 's involvement by the Treaty of Westminster ; after 1673 , France slowly withdrew from Dutch territory ( with the exception of Maastricht ) , while making gains elsewhere . 
 Fagel now proposed to treat the liberated provinces of Utrecht , Gelderland and Overijssel as conquered territory ( Generality Lands ) , as punishment for their quick surrender to the enemy . William refused but obtained a special mandate from the States General to newly appoint all delegates in the States of these provinces . William 's followers in the States of Utrecht on 26 April 1674 appointed him hereditary stadtholder . On 30 January 1675 , the States of Gelderland offered him the titles of Duke of Guelders and Count of Zutphen . The negative reactions to this from Zeeland and the city of Amsterdam made William ultimately decide to decline these honours ; he was instead appointed stadtholder of Gelderland and Overijssel . 
 = = = Marriage = = = 
 During the war with France , William tried to improve his position by marrying , in 1677 , his first cousin Mary , elder surviving daughter of James , Duke of York , later James II of England ( James VII of Scotland ) . Mary was eleven years his junior and he anticipated resistance to a Stuart match from the Amsterdam merchants who had disliked his mother ( another Mary Stuart ) , but William believed that marrying Mary would increase his chances of succeeding to Charles 's kingdoms , and would draw England 's monarch away from his pro @-@ French policies . James was not inclined to consent , but Charles II pressured his brother to agree . Charles wanted to use the possibility of marriage to gain leverage in negotiations relating to the war , but William insisted that the two issues be decided separately . Charles relented , and Bishop Henry Compton married the couple on 4 November 1677 . Mary became pregnant soon after the marriage , but miscarried . After a further illness later in 1678 , she never conceived again . 
 Throughout William and Mary 's marriage , William had only one reputed mistress , Elizabeth Villiers , in contrast to the many mistresses his uncles openly kept . 
 = = = Peace with France , intrigue with England = = = 
 By 1678 , Louis sought peace with the Dutch Republic . Even so , tensions remained : William remained very suspicious of Louis , thinking that the French king desired " Universal Kingship " over Europe ; Louis described William as " my mortal enemy " and saw him as an obnoxious warmonger . France 's annexations in the Southern Netherlands and Germany ( the Réunion policy ) and the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 , caused a surge of Huguenot refugees to the Republic . This led William III to join various anti @-@ French alliances , such as the Association League , and ultimately the League of Augsburg ( an anti @-@ French coalition that also included the Holy Roman Empire , Sweden , Spain and several German states ) in 1686 . 
 After his marriage in November 1677 , William became a strong candidate for the English throne should his father @-@ in @-@ law ( and uncle ) James be excluded because of his Catholicism . During the crisis concerning the Exclusion Bill in 1680 , Charles at first invited William to come to England to bolster the king 's position against the exclusionists , then withdrew his invitation — after which Lord Sunderland also tried unsuccessfully to bring William over , but now to put pressure on Charles . Nevertheless , William secretly induced the States General to send Charles the " <unk> " , a plea beseeching the king to prevent any Catholics from succeeding him , without explicitly naming James . After receiving indignant reactions from Charles and James , William denied any involvement . 
 In 1685 , when James II succeeded Charles , William at first attempted a conciliatory approach , at the same time trying not to offend the Protestants in England . William , ever looking for ways to diminish the power of France , hoped that James would join the League of Augsburg , but by 1687 it became clear that James would not join the anti @-@ French alliance . Relations worsened between William and James thereafter . In November , James 's second wife Mary of Modena was announced to be pregnant . That month , to gain the favour of English Protestants , William wrote an open letter to the English people in which he disapproved of James 's pro @-@ Roman Catholic policy of religious toleration . Seeing him as a friend , and often having maintained secret contacts with him for years , many English politicians began to urge an armed invasion of England . 
 = = Glorious Revolution = = 
 = = = Invasion of England = = = 
 William at first opposed the prospect of invasion , but most historians now agree that he began to assemble an expeditionary force in April 1688 , as it became increasingly clear that France would remain occupied by campaigns in Germany and Italy , and thus unable to mount an attack while William 's troops would be occupied in Britain . Believing that the English people would not react well to a foreign invader , he demanded in a letter to Rear @-@ Admiral Arthur Herbert that the most eminent English Protestants first invite him to invade . In June , James 's second wife , Mary of Modena , after a string of miscarriages , bore a son ( James Francis Edward Stuart ) , who displaced William 's Protestant wife , Mary , to become first in the line of succession and raised the prospect of an ongoing Catholic monarchy . Public anger also increased because of the trial of seven bishops who had publicly opposed James 's Declaration of Indulgence granting religious liberty to his subjects , a policy which appeared to threaten the establishment of the Anglican Church . 
 On 30 June 1688 — the same day the bishops were acquitted — a group of political figures , known afterward as the " Immortal Seven " , sent William a formal invitation . William 's intentions to invade were public knowledge by September 1688 . With a Dutch army , William landed at Brixham in southwest England on 5 November 1688 . He came ashore from the ship Brill , proclaiming " the liberties of England and the Protestant religion I will maintain " . William had come ashore with approximately 11 @,@ 000 @-@ foot and 4 @,@ 000 horse soldiers . James 's support began to dissolve almost immediately upon William 's arrival ; Protestant officers defected from the English army ( the most notable of whom was Lord Churchill of Eyemouth , James 's most able commander ) , and influential noblemen across the country declared their support for the invader . 
 James at first attempted to resist William , but saw that his efforts would prove futile . He sent representatives to negotiate with William , but secretly attempted to flee on 11 December , throwing the Great Seal into the Thames on his way . He was discovered and brought back to London by a group of fishermen . He was allowed to escape to France in a second attempt on 23 December . William permitted James to leave the country , not wanting to make him a martyr for the Roman Catholic cause ; it was in his interests for James to be perceived as having left the country of his own accord , rather than having been forced or frightened into fleeing . William is the last person to successfully invade England by force of arms . 
 = = = Proclaimed king = = = 
 William summoned a Convention Parliament in England , which met on 22 January 1689 , to discuss the appropriate course of action following James 's flight . William felt insecure about his position ; though his wife preceded him in the line of succession to the throne , he wished to reign as king in his own right , rather than as a mere consort . The only precedent for a joint monarchy in England dated from the 16th century , when Queen Mary I married Philip of Spain . Philip remained king only during his wife 's lifetime , and restrictions were placed on his power . William , on the other hand , demanded that he remain as king even after his wife 's death . When the majority of Tory Lords proposed to acclaim her as sole ruler , William threatened to leave the country immediately . Furthermore , Mary , remaining loyal to her husband , refused . 
 The House of Commons , with a Whig majority , quickly resolved that the throne was vacant , and that it was safer if the ruler was Protestant . There were more Tories in the House of Lords , which would not initially agree , but after William refused to be a regent or to agree to remain king only in his wife 's lifetime , there were negotiations between the two houses and the Lords agreed by a narrow majority that the throne was vacant . The Commons made William accept a Bill of Rights , and , on 13 February 1689 , Parliament passed the Declaration of Right , in which it deemed that James , by attempting to flee , had abdicated the government of the realm , thereby leaving the throne vacant . 
 The Crown was not offered to James 's infant son , who would have been the heir apparent under normal circumstances , but to William and Mary as joint sovereigns . It was , however , provided that " the sole and full exercise of the regal power be only in and executed by the said Prince of Orange in the names of the said Prince and Princess during their joint lives " . 
 William and Mary were crowned together at Westminster Abbey on 11 April 1689 by the Bishop of London , Henry Compton . Normally , the coronation is performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury , but the Archbishop at the time , William Sancroft , refused to recognise James 's removal . 
 William also summoned a Convention of the Estates of Scotland , which met on 14 March 1689 and sent a conciliatory letter , while James sent haughty uncompromising orders , swaying a majority in favour of William . On 11 April , the day of the English coronation , the Convention finally declared that James was no longer King of Scotland . William and Mary were offered the Scottish Crown ; they accepted on 11 May .

 William encouraged the passage of the Toleration Act 1688 , which guaranteed religious toleration to certain Protestant nonconformists . It did not , however , extend toleration as far as he wished , still restricting the religious liberty of Roman Catholics , non @-@ <unk> , and those of non @-@ Christian faiths . In December 1689 , one of the most important constitutional documents in English history , the Bill of Rights , was passed . The Act , which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier Declaration of Right , established restrictions on the royal prerogative . It provided , amongst other things , that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament , levy taxes without parliamentary consent , infringe the right to petition , raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent , deny the right to bear arms to Protestant subjects , unduly interfere with parliamentary elections , punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates , require excessive bail or inflict cruel and unusual punishments . William was opposed to the imposition of such constraints , but he chose not to engage in a conflict with Parliament and agreed to abide by the statute . 
 The Bill of Rights also settled the question of succession to the Crown . After the death of either William or Mary , the other would continue to reign . Next in the line of succession was Mary II 's sister , Princess Anne , and her issue , followed by any children William might have had by a subsequent marriage . Roman Catholics , as well as those who married Catholics , were excluded .

 Although most in Britain accepted William and Mary as sovereigns , a significant minority refused to acknowledge their claim to the throne , instead believing in the divine right of kings , which held that the monarch 's authority derived directly from God rather than being delegated to the monarch by Parliament . Over the next 57 years Jacobites pressed for restoration of James and his heirs . <unk> in England and Scotland , including over 400 clergy and several bishops of the Church of England and Scottish Episcopal Church as well as numerous laymen , refused to take oaths of allegiance to William . 
 Ireland was controlled by Roman Catholics loyal to James , and Franco @-@ Irish Jacobites arrived from France with French forces in March 1689 to join the war in Ireland and contest Protestant resistance at the Siege of Derry . William sent his navy to the city in July , and his army landed in August . After progress stalled , William personally intervened to lead his armies to victory over James at the Battle of the Boyne on 1 July 1690 , after which James fled back to France . 
 Upon William 's return to England , his close friend Dutch General <unk> de <unk> , who had accompanied William to Ireland and had commanded a body of Dutch cavalry at the Battle of the Boyne , was named Commander in Chief of William 's forces in Ireland and entrusted with further conduct of the war there . <unk> took command in Ireland in the spring of 1691 , and following several ensuing battles , succeeded in capturing both Galway and Limerick , thereby effectively suppressing the Jacobite forces in Ireland within a few more months . After difficult negotiations a capitulation was signed on 3 October 1691 — the Treaty of Limerick . Thus concluded the Williamite pacification of Ireland , and for his services the Dutch general received the formal thanks of the House of Commons , and was awarded the title of Earl of Athlone by the king . 
 A series of Jacobite risings also took place in Scotland , where Viscount Dundee raised Highland forces and won a victory on 27 July 1689 at the Battle of Killiecrankie , but he died in the fight and a month later Scottish <unk> forces subdued the rising at the Battle of Dunkeld . William offered Scottish clans that had taken part in the rising a pardon provided that they signed allegiance by a deadline , and his government in Scotland punished a delay with the Massacre of Glencoe of 1692 , which became infamous in Jacobite propaganda as William had countersigned the orders . Bowing to public opinion , William dismissed those responsible for the massacre , though they still remained in his favour ; in the words of the historian John Dalberg @-@ Acton , " one became a colonel , another a knight , a third a peer , and a fourth an earl . " 
 William 's reputation in Scotland suffered further damage when he refused English assistance to the Darien scheme , a Scottish colony ( 1698 – 1700 ) that failed disastrously . 
 = = = Parliament and faction = = = 
 Although the Whigs were William 's strongest supporters , he initially favoured a policy of balance between the Whigs and Tories . The Marquess of Halifax , a man known for his ability to chart a moderate political course , gained William 's confidence early in his reign . The Whigs , a majority in Parliament , had expected to dominate the government , and were disappointed that William denied them this chance . This " balanced " approach to governance did not last beyond 1690 , as the conflicting factions made it impossible for the government to pursue effective policy , and William called for new elections early that year . 
 After the Parliamentary elections of 1690 , William began to favour the Tories , led by Danby and Nottingham . While the Tories favoured preserving the king 's prerogatives , William found them unaccommodating when he asked Parliament to support his continuing war with France . As a result , William began to prefer the Whig faction known as the Junto . The Whig government was responsible for the creation of the Bank of England following the example of the Bank of Amsterdam . William 's decision to grant the Royal Charter in 1694 to the Bank of England , a private institution owned by bankers , is his most relevant economic legacy . It laid the financial foundation of the English take @-@ over of the central role of the Dutch Republic and Bank of Amsterdam in global commerce in the 18th century . 
 William dissolved Parliament in 1695 , and the new Parliament that assembled that year was led by the Whigs . There was a considerable surge in support for William following the exposure of a Jacobite plan to assassinate him in 1696 . Parliament passed a bill of attainder against the ringleader , John Fenwick , and he was beheaded in 1697 . 
 = = = War in Europe = = = 
 William continued to be absent from the realm for extended periods during his Nine Years ' War with France , leaving each spring and returning to England each autumn . England joined the League of Augsburg , which then became known as the Grand Alliance . Whilst William was away fighting , his wife , Mary II , governed the realm , but acted on his advice . Each time he returned to England , Mary gave up her power to him without reservation , an arrangement that lasted for the rest of Mary 's life . 
 After the Anglo @-@ Dutch fleet defeated a French fleet at La Hogue in 1692 , the allies for a short period controlled the seas , and Ireland was pacified thereafter by the Treaty of Limerick . At the same time , the Grand Alliance fared poorly in Europe , as William lost Namur in the Spanish Netherlands in 1692 , and was badly beaten at the Battle of Landen in 1693 .

 Mary II died of smallpox on 28 December 1694 , leaving William III to rule alone . William deeply mourned his wife 's death . Despite his conversion to Anglicanism , William 's popularity plummeted during his reign as a sole monarch . 
 = = = Allegations of homosexuality = = = 
 During the 1690s , rumours grew of William 's alleged homosexual inclinations and led to the publication of many satirical pamphlets by his Jacobite detractors . He did have several close male associates , including two Dutch courtiers to whom he granted English titles : Hans Willem Bentinck became Earl of Portland , and Arnold Joost van Keppel was created Earl of Albemarle . These relationships with male friends , and his apparent lack of mistresses , led William 's enemies to suggest that he might prefer homosexual relationships . William 's modern biographers , however , still disagree on the veracity of these allegations . Some have suggested that there may have been some truth to the rumours , while more affirm that they were no more than figments of his enemies ' imaginations , and that there was nothing unusual in someone childless like William adopting or evincing paternal affections for a younger man . 
 Bentinck 's closeness to William did arouse jealousies in the Royal Court at the time , but most modern historians doubt that there was a homosexual element in their relationship . William 's young protegé , Keppel , aroused more gossip and suspicion , being 20 years William 's junior and strikingly handsome , and having risen from being a royal page to an earldom with some ease . Portland wrote to William in 1697 that " the kindness which your Majesty has for a young man , and the way in which you seem to authorise his liberties ... make the world say things I am ashamed to hear . " This , he said , was " tarnishing a reputation which has never before been subject to such accusations " . William tersely dismissed these suggestions , however , saying , " It seems to me very extraordinary that it should be impossible to have esteem and regard for a young man without it being criminal . "

 In 1696 , the Dutch territory of Drenthe made William its Stadtholder . In the same year , Jacobites plotted to assassinate William III in an attempt to restore James to the English throne , but failed . In accordance with the Treaty of Rijswijk ( 20 September 1697 ) , which ended the Nine Years ' War , Louis recognised William III as King of England , and undertook to give no further assistance to James II . Thus deprived of French dynastic backing after 1697 , Jacobites posed no further serious threats during William 's reign . 
 As his life drew towards its conclusion , William , like many other European rulers , felt concern over the question of succession to the throne of Spain , which brought with it vast territories in Italy , the Low Countries and the New World . The King of Spain , Charles II , was an invalid with no prospect of having children ; amongst his closest relatives were Louis XIV ( the King of France ) and Leopold I , Holy Roman Emperor . William sought to prevent the Spanish inheritance from going to either monarch , for he feared that such a calamity would upset the balance of power . William and Louis XIV agreed to the First Partition Treaty , which provided for the division of the Spanish Empire : Duke Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria would obtain Spain , while France and the Holy Roman Emperor would divide the remaining territories between them . Charles II accepted the nomination of Joseph Ferdinand as his heir , and war appeared to be averted . 
 When , however , Joseph Ferdinand died of smallpox , the issue re @-@ opened . In 1700 , the two rulers agreed to the Second Partition Treaty ( also called the Treaty of London ) , under which the territories in Italy would pass to a son of the King of France , and the other Spanish territories would be inherited by a son of the Holy Roman Emperor . This arrangement infuriated both the Spanish , who still sought to prevent the dissolution of their empire , and the Holy Roman Emperor , to whom the Italian territories were much more useful than the other lands . Unexpectedly , the invalid King of Spain , Charles II , interfered as he lay dying in late 1700 . <unk> , he willed all Spanish territories to Philip , a grandson of Louis XIV . The French conveniently ignored the Second Partition Treaty and claimed the entire Spanish inheritance . Furthermore , Louis XIV alienated William III by recognising James Francis Edward Stuart , the son of the former King James II who had died in 1701 , as de jure King of England . The subsequent conflict , known as the War of the Spanish Succession , continued until 1713 . 
 = = = English succession = = = 
 The Spanish inheritance was not the only one that concerned William . His marriage with Mary had not yielded any children , and he did not seem likely to remarry . Mary 's sister , Anne , had borne numerous children , all of whom died during childhood . The death of her last surviving child , Prince William , Duke of Gloucester , in 1700 left her as the only individual in the line of succession established by the Bill of Rights . As the complete exhaustion of the line of succession would have encouraged a restoration of James II 's line , Parliament passed the Act of Settlement 1701 , which provided that if Anne died without surviving issue and William failed to have surviving issue by any subsequent marriage , the Crown would be inherited by a distant relative , Sophia , Electress of Hanover , a granddaughter of James I , and her Protestant heirs . The Act debarred Roman Catholics from the throne , thereby excluding the candidacy of several dozen people more closely related to Mary and Anne than Sophia . The Act extended to England and Ireland , but not to Scotland , whose Estates had not been consulted before the selection of Sophia . 
 = = Death = = 
 In 1702 , William died of pneumonia , a complication from a broken collarbone following a fall from his horse , Sorrel . Because his horse had stumbled into a mole 's burrow , many Jacobites toasted " the little gentleman in the black velvet waistcoat . " Years later , Sir Winston Churchill , in his A History of the English @-@ Speaking Peoples , stated that the fall " opened the door to a troop of lurking foes " . William was buried in Westminster Abbey alongside his wife . His sister @-@ in @-@ law , Anne , became queen regnant of England , Scotland and Ireland . 
 William 's death brought an end to the Dutch House of Orange , members of which had served as stadtholder of Holland and the majority of the other provinces of the Dutch Republic since the time of William the Silent ( William I ) . The five provinces of which William III was stadtholder — Holland , Zeeland , Utrecht , Gelderland , and Overijssel — all suspended the office after his death . Thus , he was the last patrilineal descendant of William I to be named stadtholder for the majority of the provinces . Under William III 's will , John William <unk> stood to inherit the Principality of Orange as well as several lordships in the Netherlands . He was William 's closest agnatic relative , as well as son of William 's aunt Albertine Agnes . However , King Frederick I of Prussia also claimed the Principality as the senior cognatic heir , his mother Louise Henriette being Albertine Agnes 's older sister . Under the Treaty of Utrecht ( 1713 ) , Frederick I 's successor , Frederick William I of Prussia , ceded his territorial claim to King Louis XIV of France , keeping only a claim to the title . <unk> 's posthumous son , William IV , succeeded to the title at his birth in 1711 ; in the Treaty of Partition ( 1732 ) he agreed to share the title " Prince of Orange " with Frederick William . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 William 's primary achievement was to contain France when it was in a position to impose its will across much of Europe . His life 's aim was largely to oppose Louis XIV of France . This effort continued after his death during the War of the Spanish Succession . Another important consequence of William 's reign in England involved the ending of a bitter conflict between Crown and Parliament that had lasted since the accession of the first English monarch of the House of Stuart , James I , in 1603 . The conflict over royal and parliamentary power had led to the English Civil War during the 1640s and the Glorious Revolution of 1688 . During William 's reign , however , the conflict was settled in Parliament 's favour by the Bill of Rights 1689 , the Triennial Act 1694 and the Act of Settlement 1701 . 
 William endowed the College of William and Mary ( in present @-@ day Williamsburg , Virginia ) in 1693 . Nassau , the capital of The Bahamas , is named after Fort Nassau , which was renamed in 1695 in his honour . Similarly Nassau County , New York , a county on Long Island , is a namesake . Long Island itself was also known as Nassau during early Dutch rule . Though many alumni of Princeton University think that the town of Princeton , New Jersey ( and hence the university ) were named in his honour , this is probably untrue . Nassau Hall , at the university campus , is so named , however . 
 New York City was briefly renamed New Orange for him in 1673 after the Dutch recaptured the city , which had been renamed New York by the British in 1665 . His name was applied to the fort and administrative center for the city on two separate occasions reflecting his different sovereign status — first as Fort Willem Hendrick in 1673 , and then as Fort William in 1691 when the English evicted Colonists who had seized the fort and city . Nassau Street ( Manhattan ) was also named some time before 1696 in his honor . Orange County , just north of New York City , is his namesake , as was Fort Orange ( now Albany ) .

 Bedford Castle was a large medieval castle in Bedford , England . Built after 1100 by Henry I , the castle played a prominent part in both the civil war of the Anarchy and the First Barons ' War . The castle was significantly extended in stone , although the final plan of the castle remains uncertain . Henry III of England besieged the castle in 1224 following a disagreement with Falkes de Breauté ; the siege lasted eight weeks and involved an army of as many as 2 @,@ 700 soldiers with equipment drawn from across England . After the surrender of the castle , the king ordered its destruction . Although partially refortified in the 17th century during the English Civil War , the castle remained a ruin until the urban expansion in Bedford during the 19th century , when houses were built across much of the property . Today only part of the motte still stands , forming part of an archaeological park built on the site between 2007 and 2009 .
