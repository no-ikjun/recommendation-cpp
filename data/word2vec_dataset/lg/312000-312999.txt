 = Lad , A Dog ( film ) = 
 Lad : A Dog is a 1962 American dramatic film based on the 1919 novel Lad : A Dog written by Albert Payson Terhune . Starring Peter Breck , Peggy McCay , Carroll O 'Connor , and Angela Cartwright , the film blends several of the short stories featured in the novel , with the heroic Lad winning a rigged dog show , saving a handicapped girl from a snake , and capturing a poacher who killed his pups and injured one of his owners . Warner Brothers purchased the film rights for the novel from Vanguard Productions , and acquired the film rights for the other two Lad novels from the late Terhune 's wife . 
 Aram Avakian was initially selected to be the film 's director , but when he continually refused to do a sentimental @-@ type dog story , he was replaced by Leslie H. Martinson . Lillie Hayward and Roberta Hodes wrote the screenplay for the film , adapting several of the short stories from the novel to create a single narrative , and adding in an all @-@ purpose villain . The film was released on June 6 , 1962 . The studio hoped it would be successful enough to be followed by a second film and a television series . Though praised by fans and modern reviewers , contemporary critiques felt Terhune 's work did not translate well to film and it was considered a low budget , B @-@ movie . It was released to home video in 1995 .

 Purebred rough collie Lad and his owners , Stephen ( Peter Breck ) and Elizabeth Tremayne ( Peggy McCay ) , are visited by their wealthy neighbor Hamilcar Q. Glure ( Carroll O 'Connor ) and his 8 @-@ year @-@ old daughter Angela ( Angela Cartwright ) , who is crippled from polio . While Lad befriends the girl , Glure invites the <unk> to show the prize @-@ winning Lad at his upcoming dog show . However , Glure is jealous of Lad 's success and has rigged one event to have such specialized rules that he believes only his recently purchased high @-@ priced , English @-@ trained collie can win . During the competition , which involves directing the dogs through a tricky set of a maneuvers , Lad is able to complete the course , while Glure 's champion does not recognize the hand signals Glure makes while holding a cigar . 
 Later , Lad saves Glure 's daughter Angela from a poisonous snake by knocking her backwards to get her out of harm 's way , then fighting and killing the snake , getting bitten in the process . Her nurse ( Alice Pearce ) initially does not see the snake , and begins beating Lad for " attacking " the little girl . Distraught , Angela stands and walks for the first time since her illness to stop the nurse 's abuse of her friend . Lad disappears for three days , reappearing covered in mud but cured of the poison . 
 After his return , Lad is bred with another prize @-@ winning collie , Lady , and they have two male puppies which are named Little Lad & Wolf . Angela is allowed her choice of one as a present to her when they are old enough to leave their mother & she chooses Little Lad . However , Jackson White ( Jack Daly ) , a poacher Lad fought and chased off the property before , sets fire to barn out of vengeance . Elizabeth is injured and Little Lad is killed but not Wolf . Lad later aids in capturing White when he breaks into the house to try to steal Lad 's gold trophy from the dog show . Angela is initially inconsolable over the loss of her puppy Little Lad , and refuses to have anything to do with Wolf . After he is nearly lost in another accident , she changes her mind and accepts Wolf as her new dog .

 Max J. Rosenberg , of Vanguard Productions , purchased the film rights for Albert Payson Terhune 's Lad : A Dog from publisher E.P. Dutton , then later sold the rights to Warner Brothers . When the studio learned of the other two Lad novels , Further Adventures of Lad and Lad of Sunnybank , they were concerned to learn that Dutton had the rights to only the first novel , as they were hoping the film would be successful enough to develop a sequel and possibly a television series . Executive Bruce Chapman negotiated for the film rights for the other two novels with Anice Terhune , the late wife of the author . She set up a foundation , Terhune Lad Stories , Inc , to negotiate the rights for other two novels . All told , Warner paid $ 25 @,@ 000 for the rights to all three books , though the bulk of the funds went to Dutton . 
 Warner Brothers initially hired Aram Avakian , a " talented , aggressive young ex @-@ film editor " known for his avant @-@ garde tendencies , to direct the film . The studio wanted a sentimental dog story that played true to the novel , which Avakian opposed . In a 1969 Life interview , Avakian stated that he " wanted to make a kind of pop , camp thing that wouldn 't be a complete ordeal for parents " while everyone else involved in the production wanted " Dick , Jane and Doggie " . Jack Warner , then head of the studio , eventually fired him , bringing the more conventional Leslie H. Martinson to complete the film . Peter Breck and Peggy McCay were cast as Lad 's owners , renamed to Stephen and Elizabeth Tremayne . Veteran actor Carroll O 'Connor was hired to play the pompous and newly wealthy Hamilcar Q. Glure , with the role of his daughter played by Angela Cartwright , a noted young actress who had starred in The Danny Thomas Show . To cast the role of Lad , a talent search was conducted , eventually resulting in the selection of a collie from the San Fernando Valley who was credited simply as " Lad " . The film is set in a modified version of the Place , with Pompton Lake reduced to a river with a large dock . The house , though similar to the real Terhune home , even including duplicates of the stone lions on the veranda , was built on a scale three times larger than the original . 
 Well @-@ known screenwriter Lillie Hayward , and newcomer Roberta Hodes , were hired to adapt the novel for film . They combined several of the stories from the novel , modifying characters to create a single flowing narrative . For example , the crippled girl who was a neighbor girl in the original novel became Glure 's daughter . Noting Terhune 's frequent disdain for the <unk> Mountain Indians , they named the film 's villain Jackson White , a play on the nickname used to refer to those people . White became the catch all villain of the film , who <unk> deer , sets fire to the Tremayne barn , and break into the house to try to steal a gold trophy won by Lad . 
 Lad : A Dog was released to theaters on June 6 , 1962 . The 98 minute film was released to VHS format on January 31 , 1995 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The film was considered to be a " B @-@ movie " with its low production budget . Terhune biographer Irving <unk> praised O 'Connor 's performance as Glure , feeling his talent made him " seem human " and " a person of dignity and love " versus Terhune 's " overdrawn and exaggerated " silly character . He felt the setting and cinematography was " typical Hollywood overstatement " , and that as a whole found that Terhune 's " sentimental writing " did not do well in film form , calling the resulting film " cloying " and a " minor , unsung film . " However , he noted that fans of the novels seemed to thoroughly enjoy the film , suspecting part of it was the " handsome collie " found to play the titular role , and seeing the names of the beloved collies they knew on the screen . A New York Times reviewer called it a " bucolic drama of no discernible merit " . The Monthly Film Bulletin praised the dog actors , but felt the film was " <unk> mawkish , with a touch of supposed humor contributed by an allegedly English chauffeur " . Bob Ross , of the Tampa Tribune , considered it to be an " earnest , well @-@ acted story " . Leonard Maltin felt it was a " genuine if schmaltzy " adaptation of the novel . 
 = Christ Episcopal Church ( Waltham , Massachusetts ) = 
 Christ Church is a historic Episcopal church at 750 Main Street in Waltham , Massachusetts . The church is a parish of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts , and was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 . 
 The church was founded in 1848 , but a local hall was used for services until a wooden church was built in 1849 . The wooden structure eventually proved inadequate and a larger church designed by Peabody and Stearns was built of local fieldstone at the current location between 1897 and 1898 . 
 The church contains stained glass windows produced by several noteworthy manufacturers , including Clayton and Bell , Charles Connick , Louis Comfort Tiffany , and Donald MacDonald . Eight rectors have served the church since its founding . 
 = = History = = 
 The community of Christ Church was founded in 1848 by Albert C. Patterson , an Episcopal clergyman and missionary who identified the growing industrial city of Waltham as an ideal place to build a church . The new Episcopal community met in Rumford Hall ( later Waltham City Hall ) until a Gothic wooden church was completed on Central Street in Waltham in 1849 . The land for the church and much of its funding was provided by founding member J.S. Copley Greene . 
 Christ Church 's first rector was the Rev. Thomas F. Fales , from St. Paul 's Episcopal Church in Brunswick , Maine . Fales remained the church 's rector for more than 40 years , until retiring in 1890 . During this time , Christ Church 's membership grew from 15 members to more than 400 . 
 At about the time Fales retired , the church outgrew the Central Street building . In 1892 , the parish bought land with the intent of building a larger church at 750 Main Street . In 1895 , the old church building was sold to a French Canadian Roman Catholic community . Christ Church held services in Waltham 's Maynard Hall until the new building could be completed . 
 In 1896 , after four years of planning , the architectural firm of Peabody and Stearns was hired to design the new structure and construction began in the early months of 1897 . Philanthropist and Christ Church senior warden Robert Treat Paine , Jr. signed the contract for construction , and financed much of the building with his own fortune . Philanthropist sisters and Christ Church parishioners Harriet Sarah and Mary Sophia Walker also contributed significantly to the funding . 
 The first service in the completed building was held on June 17 , 1898 . That Sunday , the retired Rev. Fales delivered the church 's inaugural sermon from the wooden pulpit that was his gift to the new building . 
 The church is a parish of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts , and was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 . 
 = = Architecture and design = = 
 Christ Church was designed by Peabody and Stearns , masters of American Shingle style architecture , and was constructed of native Waltham fieldstone in the English Country style . The inspiration for the church 's stone exterior came indirectly from architect H. H. Richardson , who was also a friend and Harvard classmate of Robert Treat Paine , Jr . When Paine remodeled and expanded his Waltham home in 1883 , it was Richardson who designed the residence that would become Stonehurst , a Shingle style mansion built of glacial stones quarried on site from Paine 's estate . Richardson died in 1886 and played no part in the planning of Christ Church , but it was his Stonehurst design that inspired Robert Treat Paine , Jr. to use the same stones from his property for the exterior of the church . 
 The church features several stained glass windows of significance . The east window , by Clayton and Bell , was a gift from Robert Treat Paine , Jr. in memory of his wife , Lydia Lyman Paine , who died in 1897 during the construction of the church . At Paine 's request , his wife 's likeness was incorporated into the left panel of the window as a red @-@ clad figure kneeling before Christ . The west window , designed by Charles Connick , pays homage to Waltham 's manufacturing history . In addition to images of Ruth , Solomon , and Noah — all industrious figures in the Bible — the window features rivets , a bicycle wheel , a watch escapement , a Metz car , and other symbols that reference Waltham 's industrial character . Along the south wall is a signed Tiffany window , designed by Tiffany artist Frederick Wilson . The window depicts the Nativity , and was given to the church in 1908 by John H. Storer in memory of Frank Henry Perkins and Mary Ella Perkins . Also along the south wall is a window by noted Boston stained glass artist Donald MacDonald . This work , given in memory of Harriet K. Parmenter , depicts the Easter scene of the risen Christ revealing himself to Mary Magdalene .

 = Raven banner = 
 The raven banner ( Old Norse : <unk> ; Middle English : <unk> ) was a flag , possibly totemic in nature , flown by various Viking chieftains and other Scandinavian rulers during the 9th , 10th and 11th centuries . The flag , as depicted in Norse artwork , was roughly triangular , with a rounded outside edge on which there hung a series of tabs or tassels . It bore a resemblance to ornately carved " weather @-@ vanes " used aboard Viking longships . 
 Scholars conjecture that the raven flag was a symbol of Odin , who was often depicted accompanied by two ravens named Huginn and Muninn . Its intent may have been to strike fear in one 's enemies by invoking the power of Odin . As one scholar notes regarding encounters between the Christian Anglo @-@ Saxons and the invading pagan Scandinavians : 
 The Anglo @-@ Saxons probably thought that the banners were imbued with the evil powers of pagan idols , since the Anglo @-@ Saxons were aware of the significance of Óðinn and his ravens in Norse mythology . 
 = = Raven symbolism in Norse culture = = 
 The raven is a common iconic figure in Norse mythology . The highest god Odin had two ravens named Huginn and Muninn ( " thought " and " memory " respectively ) who flew around the world bringing back tidings to their master . Therefore , one of Odin 's many names was the " raven god " ( <unk> ) . In Gylfaginning ( c . 1220 ) , the medieval Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson explains : 
 Odin was also closely linked to ravens because in Norse myths he received the fallen warriors at Valhalla , and ravens were linked with death and war due to their predilection for carrion . It is consequently likely that they were regarded as manifestations of the Valkyries , goddesses who chose the valiant dead for military service in Valhalla . A further connection between ravens and Valkyries was indicated in the shapeshifting abilities of goddesses and Valkyries , who could appear in the form of birds . 
 The raven appears in almost every skaldic poem describing warfare . To make war was to feed and please the raven ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) . An example of this is found in <unk> @-@ <unk> þáttr , where Regin recites the following poem after Sigurd kills the sons of Hunding : 
 Above all , kennings used in Norse poetry identify the raven as the bird of blood , corpses and battle ; he is the gull of the wave of the heap of corpses , who screams dashed with hail and craves morning steak as he arrives at the sea of corpses ( <unk> <unk> <unk> már <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> er <unk> at <unk> <unk> ) . 
 In black flocks , the ravens hover over the corpses and the skald asks where they are heading ( <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> hart með <unk> <unk> <unk> ) . The raven goes forth in the blood of those fallen in battle ( <unk> <unk> í <unk> ) . He flies from the field of battle with blood on his beak , human flesh in his talons and the reek of corpses from his mouth ( Með <unk> <unk> , hold <unk> í <unk> en <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) . The ravens who were the messengers of the highest god , Huginn and Muninn , increasingly had hellish connotations , and as early as in the Christian <unk> , stanza 67 , the ravens of Hel ( l ) ( <unk> <unk> ) who tear the eyes off <unk> are mentioned . Two curses in the Poetic Edda say " may ravens tear your heart asunder " ( <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) . and " the ravens shall tear out your eyes in the high gallows " ( <unk> <unk> <unk> á <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) . Ravens are thus seen as instruments of divine ( if harsh and unpleasant ) justice . 
 Despite the violent imagery associated with them , early Scandinavians regarded the raven as a largely positive figure ; battle and harsh justice were viewed favorably in Norse culture . Many Old Norse personal names referred to the raven , such as Hrafn , <unk> and <unk> .

 The raven banner was used by a number of Viking warlords regarded in Norse tradition as the sons of the Danish Ragnar Lodbrok . The first mention of a Viking force carrying a raven banner is in the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle . For the year 878 , the Chronicle relates : 
 And in the winter of this same year the brother of Ivar and Halfdan landed in Wessex , in Devonshire , with 23 ships , and there was he slain , and 800 men with him , and 40 of his army . There also was taken the war @-@ flag ( <unk> ) , which they called " Raven " . 
 The 12th @-@ century Annals of St Neots claims that a raven banner was present with the Great Heathen Army and adds insight into its <unk> ( <unk> ) influenced creation and totemic and oracular nature : 
 <unk> Gaimar 's <unk> des Engles ( written around 1140 ) mentions the <unk> being borne by the army of <unk> at the Battle of Cynwit ( 878 ) : " [ t ] he Raven was <unk> 's banner ( <unk> ) . He was the brother of <unk> ; he was buried by the vikings in a very big mound in Devonshire , called <unk> . " 
 = = = 10th century = = = 
 In the 10th century , the raven banner seems to have been adopted by Norse @-@ Gaelic kings of Dublin and Northumbria . Many of the Norse @-@ Gaelic dynasts in Britain and Ireland were of the Uí Ímair clan , which claimed descent from Ragnar Lodbrok through his son Ivar . A triangular banner appearing to depict a bird ( possibly a raven ) appears on a penny minted by Olaf Cuaran around 940 . The coin features a roughly right isosceles triangular standard , with the two equilateral sides situated at the top and staff , respectively . Along the hypotenuse are a series of five tabs or tassels . The staff is topped by what appears to be a cross ; this may indicate a fusion of pagan and Christian symbolism . 
 The raven banner was also a standard used by the Norse Jarls of Orkney . According to the Orkneyinga Saga , it was made for Sigurd the Stout by his mother , a völva or shamanic seeress . She told him that the banner would " bring victory to the man it 's carried before , but death to the one who carries it . " The saga describes the flag as " a finely made banner , very cleverly embroidered with the figure of a raven , and when the banner fluttered in the breeze , the raven seemed to be flying ahead . " Sigurd 's mother 's prediction came true when , according to the sagas , all of the bearers of the standard met untimely ends . The " curse " of the banner ultimately fell on Jarl Sigurd himself at the Battle of Clontarf : 
 Earl Sigurd had a hard battle against Kerthialfad , and Kerthialfad came on so fast that he laid low all who were in the front rank , and he broke the array of Earl Sigurd right up to his banner , and slew the banner @-@ bearer . Then he got another man to bear the banner , and there was again a hard fight . Kerthialfad smote this man too his death blow at once , and so on one after the other all who stood near him . Then Earl Sigurd called on Thorstein the son of Hall of Sida , to bear the banner , and Thorstein was just about to lift the banner , but then Asmund the White said , " Don 't bear the banner ! For all they who bear it get their death . " " Hrafn the Red ! " called out Earl Sigurd , " bear thou the banner . " " Bear thine own devil thyself , " answered Hrafn . Then the earl said , " <unk> fittest that the beggar should bear the bag ; ' " and with that he took the banner from the staff and put it under his cloak . A little after Asmund the White was slain , and then the earl was pierced through with a spear .

 The army of King Cnut the Great of England , Norway and Denmark bore a raven banner made from white silk at the Battle of Ashingdon in 1016 . The <unk> <unk> reports that Cnut had 
 a banner which gave a wonderful omen . I am well aware that this may seem incredible to the reader , but nevertheless I insert it in my <unk> work because it is true : This banner was woven of the cleanest and whitest silk and no picture of any figures was found on it . In case of war , however , a raven was always to be seen , as if it were woven into it . If the Danes were going to win the battle , the raven appeared , beak wide open , flapping its wings and restless on its feet . If they were going to be defeated , the raven did not stir at all , and its limbs hung motionless . 
 The Lives of Waltheof and his Father <unk> Digri ( The Stout ) , the Earl of Northumberland , written by a monk of Crowland Abbey ( possibly the English historian William of Ramsey ) , reports that the Danish jarl of Northumbria , Sigurd , was given a banner by an unidentified old sage . The banner was called <unk> . 
 According to the Heimskringla , Harald Hardrada flew a raven banner called Landøyðan or " Land @-@ waster " ; whether this was the same banner as that flown by Sigurd of Northumbria is unclear . In a conversation between Harald and King Sweyn II of Denmark , 
 Sveinn asked Haraldr which of his possessions of his he valued most highly . He answered that it was his banner ( merki ) , Landøyðan . Thereupon Sveinn asked what virtue it had to be accounted so valuable . Haraldr replied that it was prophesied that victory would be his before whom this banner was borne ; and added that this had been the case ever since he had obtained it . Thereupon Sveinn said , " I shall believe that your flag has this virtue if you fight three battles with King Magnús , your kinsman , and are victorious in all . " 
 Years later , during Harald 's invasion of England , Harald fought a pitched battle against two English earls outside York . Harald 's Saga relates that 
 when King Haraldr saw that the battle array of the English had come down along the ditch right opposite them , he had the trumpets blown and sharply urged his men to the attack , raising his banner called Landøyðan . And there so strong an attack was made by him that nothing held against it . 
 Harald 's army flew the banner at the Battle of Stamford Bridge , where it was carried by a warrior named <unk> . After Harald was struck by an arrow and killed , his army fought fiercely for possession of the banner , and some of them went berserk in their frenzy to secure the flag . In the end the " magic " of the banner failed , and the bulk of the Norwegian army was slaughtered , with only a few escaping to their ships . 
 Other than the dragon banner of Olaf II of Norway , the Landøyðan of Harald Hardrada is the only early Norwegian royal standard described by Snorri Sturluson in the Heimskringla . 
 In two panels of the famous Bayeux tapestry , standards are shown which appear to be raven banners . The Bayeux tapestry was commissioned by Bishop Odo , the half @-@ brother of William the Conqueror ; as one of the combatants at the Battle of Hastings , Odo would have been familiar with the standards carried into the fight . In one of the panels , depicting a Norman cavalry charge against an English shield @-@ wall , a charging Norman knight is depicted with a semicircular banner emblazoned with a standing black bird . In a second , depicting the deaths of Harold Godwinson 's brothers , a triangular banner closely resembling that shown on Olaf Cuaran 's coin lies broken on the ground . Scholars are divided as to whether these are simply relics of the Normans ' Scandinavian heritage ( or for that matter , the Scandinavian influence in Anglo @-@ Saxon England ) or whether they reflect an undocumented Norse presence in either the Norman or English army . 
 = = Modern reception = = 
 Despite claims that the <unk> was " the first European flag in the New World " , there is no indication that it was ever carried as a universal flag of Scandinavians , and no source assigns it to the Vinland settlers ( or any other Icelandic or Greenlandic group ) . 
 It is still used by some Danish army regiments , such as the shoulder sleeve insignia on the Guard Hussars regiment 's 1st Battalion 1st Tank Squadron . 
 In Shetland an alternate form of the banner ( black raven on a rectangular , red field ) is used as the symbol of Up @-@ Helly @-@ Aa , a festival that celebrates the Islands ' Norse heritage . 
 = Three Witches = 
 The Three Witches or Weird Sisters or Wayward Sisters are characters in William Shakespeare 's play Macbeth ( c . 1603 – 1607 ) . Their origin lies in Holinshed 's Chronicles ( 1587 ) , a history of England , Scotland and Ireland . Other possible sources , aside from Shakespeare 's imagination itself , include British folklore , such contemporary treatises on witchcraft as King James VI of Scotland 's Daemonologie , the Norns of Norse mythology , and ancient classical myths of the Fates : the Greek Moirai and the Roman <unk> . Productions of Macbeth began incorporating portions of Thomas Middleton 's contemporaneous play , The Witch , circa 1618 , two years after Shakespeare 's death . 
 Shakespeare 's witches are prophets who hail Macbeth , the general , early in the play , and <unk> his ascent to king . Upon killing the king and ascending the throne of Scotland , Macbeth hears them ambiguously <unk> his eventual downfall . The darkly contradictory witches , their " filthy " trappings and supernatural activities , all set an ominous tone for the play . 
 Artists in the eighteenth century ( e.g. , Henry Fuseli , William Rimmer ) depicted the witches variously , as have many directors since . Some have exaggerated or sensationalized the hags , or have adapted them to different cultures , as in Orson Welles 's rendition of the weird sisters as voodoo priestesses . Some film adaptations have cast the witches as such modern analogues as hippies on drugs , or goth schoolgirls . Their influence reaches the literary realm as well in such works as The Third Witch and the Harry Potter series . 
 = = Origins = = 
 The name " weird sisters " is found in most modern editions of Macbeth . However , the first folio 's text reads : 
 The <unk> Sisters , hand in hand , 
 Posters of the Sea and Land ... 
 In later scenes in the first folio the witches are called " <unk> , " but never " weird . " The modern appellation " weird sisters " derives from Holinshed 's original Chronicles . It should be noted however that modern English spelling was only starting to become fixed by Shakespeare 's time and also that the word ' weird ' ( from Old English wyrd , fate ) had connotations beyond the common modern meaning . 
 One of Shakespeare 's principal sources for the Three Witches is found in the account of King Duncan in Raphael Holinshed 's history of Britain , The Chronicles of England , Scotland , and Ireland ( 1587 ) . In Holinshed , the future King Macbeth of Scotland and his companion Banquo encounter " three women in strange and wild apparell , resembling creatures of elder world " who hail the men with glowing prophecies and then vanish " immediately out of their sight . " Holinshed observes that " the common opinion was that these women were either the Weird Sisters , that is … the goddesses of destiny , or else some nymphs or fairies <unk> with knowledge of prophecy by their <unk> science " 
 Another principal source was the <unk> of King James published in 1597 which included a news pamphlet titled Newes from Scotland that detailed the infamous North Berwick witch trials of 1590 . Not only had this trial taken place in Scotland , witches involved confessed to attempt the use of witchcraft to raise a tempest and sabotage the very boat King James and the Queen of Scots were on board during their return trip from Denmark . This is evidenced by the following passages : 
 purposely to be <unk> into the sea to raise winds for destruction of <unk> Macbeth , I. iii . 15 @-@ 25 . 
 The news pamphlet states : 
 Moreover she confessed that at the time when his Majesty was in Denmark , she being accompanied with the parties before specially named , took a Cat and christened it , and afterward bound to each part of that Cat , the <unk> parts of a dead man , and several joints of his body , and that in the night following the said Cat was conveyed into the midst of the sea by all these witches sailing in their riddles or Cues as aforesaid , and so left the said Cat right before the Town of Leith in Scotland : this done , there did arise such a tempest in the Sea , as a greater has not been seen : which tempest was the cause of the perishing of a Boat or vessel coming over from the town of Brunt Island to the town of Leith , of which was many Jewels and rich gifts , which should have been presented to the current Queen of Scotland , at her Majesty ’ s coming to Leith . Again it is confessed , that the said christened Cat was the cause that the King Majesty ’ s Ship at his coming forth of Denmark , had a contrary wind to the rest of his Ships , then being in his company , which thing was most strange and true , as the King ’ s Majesty acknowledges - Daemonologie , Newes from Scotland 
 The concept of the Three Witches themselves may have been influenced by the Old Norse skaldic poem Darraðarljóð ( found in chapter 157 of Njáls saga ) , in which twelve valkyries weave and choose who is to be slain at the Battle of Clontarf ( fought outside Dublin in 1014 ) . 
 Shakespeare 's creation of the Three Witches may have also been influenced by an anti @-@ witchcraft law passed by King James nine years previously , a law that was to stay untouched for over 130 years . His characters ' " <unk> fingers , " " skinny lips , " and " beards , " for example , are not found in Holinshed . Macbeth 's Hillock near Brodie , between Forres and Nairn in Scotland , has long been identified as the mythical meeting place of Macbeth and the witches . ( Map ) Traditionally , Forres is believed to have been the home of both Duncan and Macbeth . 
 However , Samuel Taylor Coleridge proposed that the three weird sisters should be seen as ambiguous figures , never actually being called witches by themselves or other characters in the play . Moreover , they were depicted as more fair than foul both in Holinshed 's account and in that of contemporary playgoer Simon Forman .

 = = Analysis = = 
 The Three Witches represent evil , darkness , chaos , and conflict , while their role is as agents and witnesses . Their presence communicates treason and impending doom . During Shakespeare 's day , witches were seen as worse than rebels , " the most notorious traitor and rebel that can be . " They were not only political traitors , but also spiritual traitors as well . Much of the confusion that springs from them comes from their ability to straddle the play 's borders between reality and the supernatural . They are so deeply entrenched in both worlds that it is unclear whether they control fate , or whether they are merely its agents . They defy logic , not being subject to the rules of the real world . 
 The witches ' lines in the first act : " Fair is foul , and foul is fair : Hover through the fog and filthy air " are often said to set the tone for the remainder of the play by establishing a sense of moral confusion . Indeed , the play is filled with situations in which evil is depicted as good , while good is rendered evil . The line " Double , double toil and trouble , " ( often sensationalized to a point that it loses meaning ) , communicates the witches ' intent clearly : they seek only to increase trouble for the mortals around them . 
 Though the witches do not deliberately tell Macbeth to kill King Duncan , they use a subtle form of temptation when they inform Macbeth that he is destined to be king . By placing this thought in his mind , they effectively guide him on the path to his own destruction . This follows the pattern of temptation attributed to the Devil in the contemporary imagination : the Devil was believed to be a thought in a person 's mind , which he or she might either indulge or reject . Macbeth indulges the temptation , while Banquo rejects it .

 In a version of Macbeth by William Davenant ( 1606 – 1668 ) a scene was added in which the witches tell Macduff and his wife of their future as well as several lines for the two before Macbeth 's entrance in Act 4 . Most of these lines were taken directly from Thomas Middleton 's play The Witch . David Garrick kept these added scenes in his eighteenth @-@ century version . Horace Walpole created a parody of Macbeth in 1742 entitled The Dear Witches in response to political problems of his time . The witches in his play are played by three everyday women who manipulate political events in England through marriage and patronage , and manipulate elections in order to have Macbeth made Treasurer and Earl of Bath . In the final scene , the witches gather around a cauldron and chant " Double , double , Toil and Trouble / parties burn and Nonsense bubble . " In their concoction they throw such things as " Judgment of a <unk> Youth " and " Liver of a Renegade . " The entire play is a commentary on the political corruption and insanity surrounding the period . 
 Orson Welles ' stage production of Macbeth sets the play in Haiti , and casts the witches as voodoo priestesses . As with earlier versions , the women are bystanders to the murder of Banquo , as well as Lady Macbeth 's sleepwalking scene . Their role in each of these scenes suggests they were behind Macbeth 's fall in a more direct way than Shakespeare 's original portrays . The witches encroach further and further into his domain as the play progresses , appearing in the forest in the first scene and in the castle itself by the end . Directors often have difficulty keeping the witches from being exaggerated and overly @-@ sensational . 
 Charles <unk> created A Macbeth in 1969 , a streamlined version of the play which requires only eleven actors . The production strongly suggests that Lady Macbeth is in league with the witches . One scene shows her leading the three to a firelight incantation . In Eugène Ionesco 's satirical version of the play Macbett ( 1972 ) , one of the witches removes a costume to reveal that she is , in fact , Lady Duncan , and wants to be Macbeth 's mistress . Once Macbeth is King and they are married , however , she abandons him , revealing that she was not Lady Duncan all along , but a witch . The real Lady Duncan appears and denounces Macbeth as a traitor . 
 The Spanish poet and playwright León Felipe wrote a version of Shakespeare 's play in Spanish which significantly changes the witches ' role , especially in the final scene . After Macbeth 's death , the Three Witches reappear in the midst of wind and storm , which they have been associated with throughout the play , to claim his corpse . They carry it to a ravine and shout , " Macbeth ! Macbeth ! Macbeth ! / We have an appointment with you in Hell ! " In the play , they also connect themselves to a painting by Francisco Goya called <unk> , in which three mysterious figures are flying through the air and supporting a more discernible royal female figure .

 Drawings contained in Holinshed 's Chronicles , one of the sources Shakespeare used when creating the characters , portray them as members of the upper class . They are wearing elaborate dresses and hairstyles and appear to be noblewomen as Macbeth and Banquo approach . Shakespeare seems to have diverted quite a bit from this image , making the witches ( as Banquo says ) " withered , and so wild in their attire , / That look not like th ' inhabitants o ' th ' earth . . . each at once her choppy fingers laying / Upon her skinny lips . You should be women , / And yet your beards forbid me to interpret / That you are so . " 
 The Three Witches of Macbeth have inspired several painters over the years who have sought to capture the supernatural darkness surrounding Macbeth 's encounters with them . For example , by the eighteenth century , belief in witches had waned in the United Kingdom . Such things were thought to be the simple stories of foreigners , farmers , and superstitious Catholics . However art depicting supernatural subjects was very popular . John Runciman , as one of the first artists to use Shakespearean characters in his work , created an ink @-@ on @-@ paper drawing entitled The Three Witches in 1767 – 68 . In it , three ancient figures are shown in close consultation , their heads together and their bodies <unk> . Runciman 's brother created another drawing of the witches called The Witches show Macbeth The Apparitions painted circa 1771 – 1772 , portraying Macbeth 's reaction to the power of the witches ' conjured vision . Both brothers ' work influenced many later artists by removing the characters from the familiar theatrical setting and placing them in the world of the story . 
 Henry Fuseli would later create one of the more famous portrayals of the Three Witches in 1783 , entitled The Weird Sisters or The Three Witches . In it , the witches are lined up and dramatically pointing at something all at once , their faces in profile . This painting was parodied by James Gillray in 1791 in Weird Sisters ; Ministers of Darkness ; Minions of the Moon . Three figures are lined up with their faces in profile in a way similar to Fuseli 's painting . However , the three figures are recognizable as Lord Dundas ( the home secretary at the time ) , William Pitt ( prime minister ) , and Lord Thurlow ( Lord Chancellor ) . The three of them are facing a moon , which contains the profiled faces of George III and Queen Charlotte . The drawing is intended to highlight the insanity of King George and the unusual alliance of the three politicians . 
 Fuseli created two other works depicting the Three Witches for a Dublin art gallery in 1794 . The first , entitled Macbeth , Banquo and the Three Witches was a frustration for him . His earlier paintings of Shakespearean scenes had been done on horizontal canvases , giving the viewer a picture of the scene that was similar to what would have been seen on stage . Woodmason requested vertical paintings , shrinking the space Fuseli had to work with . In this particular painting he uses lightning and other dramatic effects to separated Macbeth and Banquo from the witches more clearly and communicate how unnatural their meeting is . Macbeth and Banquo are both visibly terrified , while the witches are confidently perched atop a mound . Silhouettes of the victorious army of Macbeth can be seen celebrating in the background , but lack of space necessitates the removal of the barren , open landscape seen in Fuseli 's earlier paintings for the Boydell Shakespeare Gallery of the same scene . 
 Fuseli 's other Macbeth Woodmason painting Macbeth and the Armed Head depicts a later scene in which Macbeth is shown MacDuff and warned to be wary of him . Fuseli evidently intended the two paintings to be juxtaposed . He said , " when Macbeth meets with the witches on the heath , it is terrible , because he did not expect the supernatural visitation ; but when he goes to the cave to ascertain his fate , it is no longer a subject of terror . " Fuseli chose to make MacDuff a near @-@ likeness of Macbeth himself , and considered the painting one of his most poetic in that sense , asking , " ' What would be a greater object of terror to you if , some night on going home , you were to find yourself sitting at your own table . . . would not this make a powerful impression on your mind ? "

 At least fifteen operas have been based on Macbeth , but only one is regularly performed today . This is Macbeth , composed by Giuseppe Verdi to a libretto by Francesco Maria Piave and premièred in Florence in 1847 . In the opera , the Three Witches became a chorus of at least eighteen singers , divided into three groups . Each group enters separately at the start of the opera for the scene with Macbeth and Banquo ; after the men 's departure , they have a chorus of triumph which does not derive from Shakespeare . They reappear in Act 3 , when they conjure up the three apparitions and the procession of kings . When Verdi revised the opera for performance in Paris in 1865 , he added a ballet ( rarely performed nowadays ) to this scene . In it , Hecate , a non @-@ dancing character , mimes instructions to the witches before a final dance and Macbeth 's arrival .

 Orson Welles created a film version of the play in 1948 , sometimes called the Übermensch Macbeth , which altered the witches ' roles by having them create a voodoo doll of Macbeth in the first scene . Critics take this as a sign that they control his actions completely throughout the film . Their voices are heard , but their faces are never seen , and they carry forked staves as dark parallels to the Celtic cross . Welles ' voiceover in the prologue calls them " agents of chaos , priests of hell and magic . " At the end of the film , when their work with Macbeth is finished , they cut off the head of his voodoo doll . 
 Throne of Blood , a Japanese version filmed in 1958 by Akira Kurosawa , replaces the Three Witches with the Forest Spirit , an old hag who sits at her spinning wheel , symbolically entrapping Macbeth 's equivalent , Washizu , in the web of his own ambition . She lives outside " The Castle of the Spider 's Web " , another reference to Macbeth 's entanglement in her trap . Behind her hut , Washizu finds piles of rotting bones . The hag , the spinning wheel , and the piles of bones are direct references to the Noh play <unk> ( also called <unk> ) , one of many artistic elements Kurosawa borrowed from Noh theater for the film . Roman Polanski 's 1971 film version of Macbeth contained many parallels to his personal life in its graphic and violent depictions . His wife Sharon Tate had been murdered two years earlier by Charles Manson and three women . Many critics saw this as a clear parallel to Macbeth 's murders at the urging of the Three Witches within the film . 
 Scotland , PA , a 2001 parody film directed by Billy <unk> , sets the play in a restaurant in 1970s Pennsylvania . The witches are replaced by three hippies who give Joe <unk> drug @-@ induced suggestions and prophecies throughout the film using a Magic 8 @-@ Ball . After <unk> has killed his boss , Norm Duncan , one of them suggests , " I 've got it ! Mac should kill McDuff 's entire family ! " Another hippie sarcastically responds , " Oh , that 'll work ! Maybe a thousand years ago . You can 't go around killing everybody . " 
 Vishal Bhardwaj 's 2004 film Maqbool takes place in the setting of warring gangs in the Bombay underworld . The Three Witches are replaced by two corrupt policemen , who don 't just pronounce prophecies but also actively shape events in order to " balance forces " . 
 Geoffrey Wright 's 2006 Macbeth takes place in the midst of a modern Australian gang and drug culture . The Three Witches are replaced by three teenage goth schoolgirls who are knocking down headstones in a graveyard in the opening scene . They whisper their prophecies in Macbeth 's ear as they dance in a deserted nightclub . 
 Justin <unk> 's <unk> 2015 Macbeth portrays the witches as poor women dabbling in witchcraft ( who may be sisters ) living off the countryside of Scotland with their children . They seem real and though they appear amidst battles and make strangely accurate prophecies , they do not manifest anything supernatural otherwise . The movie gives one hint they are not <unk> beings as in one scene they simply disappear in the fog while Macbeth tells Banquo they disappeared in thin air , alluding to the beginning of his mental illness .

 Come and Go , a short play written in 1965 by Samuel Beckett , recalls the Three Witches . The play features only three characters , all women , named Flo , Vi , and Ru . The opening line : “ When did we three last meet ? ” recalls the “ When shall we three meet again ? ” of Macbeth : Act 1 , Scene 1 . The Third Witch , a 2001 novel written by Rebecca <unk> , tells the story of the play through the eyes of a young girl named Gilly , one of the witches . Gilly seeks Macbeth 's death out of revenge for killing her father . 
 J. K. Rowling has cited the Three Witches as an influence in her Harry Potter series . In an interview with The Leaky Cauldron and <unk> , when asked , " What if [ Voldemort ] never heard the prophecy ? " , she said , " It 's the ' Macbeth ' idea . I absolutely adore ' Macbeth . ' It is possibly my favourite Shakespeare play . And that 's the question isn 't it ? If Macbeth hadn 't met the witches , would he have killed Duncan ? Would any of it have happened ? Is it fated or did he make it happen ? I believe he made it happen . " On her website , she referred to Macbeth again in discussing the prophecy : " the prophecy ( like the one the witches make to Macbeth , if anyone has read the play of the same name ) becomes the catalyst for a situation that would never have occurred if it had not been made . " More playfully , Rowling also invented a musical band popular in the Wizarding world called The Weird Sisters that appears in passing in several books in the series as well as the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire . The third Harry Potter movie 's soundtrack featured a song by John Williams called " Double Trouble " , a reference to the witches ' line , " Double double , toil and trouble " . The lyrics of the song were adapted from the Three Witches ' spell in the play . 
 Terry Pratchett 's 1988 Discworld novel Wyrd Sisters bears obvious reference to Shakespeare 's three witches , as well as to a number of other plays by Shakespeare . 
 = Roper steam velocipede = 
 The Roper steam velocipede was a steam @-@ powered velocipede built by inventor Sylvester H. Roper of Roxbury , Boston , Massachusetts , United States sometime from 1867 – 1869 . It is one of three machines which have been called the first motorcycle , along with the Michaux @-@ Perreaux steam velocipede , also dated 1867 – 1869 , and the 1885 Daimler Reitwagen . Historians disagree over whether the Roper or the Michaux @-@ Perreaux came first . Though the Reitwagen came many years later than the two steam cycles , it is often , perhaps most often , known as the " first motorcycle " because there is doubt by some experts that a steam cycle meets the definition of a motorcycle . 
 After his initial prototype of the late 1860s , Roper built a new and revised version in 1884 , based on the then state of the art safety bicycle frame type . Sylvester Roper died of an apparent heart attack while riding this machine in 1896 . 
 An 1869 Roper machine is now in the Smithsonian Institution , and one from 1868 is in private hands after being offered at auction in 2012 . An 1894 Roper velocipede was exhibited in the Guggenheim Museum 's The Art of the Motorcycle show at their Las Vegas venue , and was shown in 2011 at the Deeley Museum collection in Vancouver . 
 = = First motorcycle ? = = 
 There are competing claims for the title of first motorcycle , depending on whether a steam motorcycle , or only one with an internal combustion engine , counts as a true motorcycle , and the uncertainty as to which of the two earliest steam motorcycles , the Roper or the Michaux @-@ Perreaux , was built first . 
 = = = Date = = = 
 The earliest date claimed for the existence of the Roper steam velocipede is 1867 , but some say the Michaux @-@ Perreaux also could have been made in 1867 . <unk> historians Charles M. Falco and David Burgess @-@ Wise , and Motorcycle Consumer News design columnist Glynn Kerr date the Roper later , to 1868 , and the Owls Head museum 's example is of that year . The AMA Hall of Fame and motoring author Mick Walker put Roper 's steam velocipede at 1869 , in accordance with the date of the machine in the Smithsonian . Cycle World 's Alan Girdler dates both at 1868 , while Mick Walker also declares a tie , but in the year 1869 . Classic Bike editor Hugo Wilson says the existence of an 1869 patent for the Michaux @-@ Perreaux gives it " the better claim to ' first ' " , even though the Roper was built around the same time . Though Sylvester Roper took out a number of patents for firearms , industrial machinery and other inventions , he did not obtain patents for any of his steam cycles or cars . 
 = = = True motorcycle ? = = = 
 If the definition of a motorcycle requires an internal combustion engine , as asserted by the Oxford English Dictionary and others , then the two pre @-@ 1870 steam cycles are disqualified and the first motorcycle may be Bernardi 's 1882 motorized tricycle , or the Reitwagen of Wilhelm Maybach and Gottlieb Daimler , patented in 1885 . Encyclopedia Britannica defines a motorcycle as , " any two @-@ wheeled or , less commonly , three @-@ wheeled motor vehicle , usually propelled by an internal @-@ combustion engine . " 
 A somewhat different argument acknowledges that while the several steam two- and three @-@ wheelers that preceded the Reitwagen might have been technically motorcycles , none are candidates for the historical milestone of " the first motorcycle " because the technology they used was a dead end . Instead , the recognition should go to the internal combustion <unk> because it blazed a trail that was followed by the thousands of successful motorcycles subsequently built in the 20th century . As Cycle World 's Technical Editor Kevin Cameron noted , " History follows things that succeed , not things that fail . " 
 Allan Girdler and Glynn Kerr nonetheless still favor the Roper , even by Cameron 's criterion . The reason , they say , is that it did in fact pioneer successful motorcycle technologies , including the <unk> throttle control , and the frame geometry and engine placement used by the motorcycle as we know it today , while the Reitwagen was exceedingly crude , failing to employ the well understood principles of rake and trail to remain upright by movements of the front fork , and turn by leaning . Rake and trail are created by having the steering axis angled to varying degrees , rather than perfectly vertical , and by having the steering axis slightly offset , creating trail . This subtle engineering makes it possible for the rider to turn the bicycle or motorcycle by the counterintuitive , and typically unconscious , technique of countersteering , in which the handlebar is turned slightly to the left , causing the machine to lean to the right , and turning the vehicle to the right . Trail , also called fork offset , is an element contributing to the stability of bicycle and motorcycle dynamics , and the lack of it was one reason why the Reitwagen had to rely on two outrigger wheels to keep it from falling down , so it remained vertical and was steered much like a tricycle . David Burgess @-@ Wise called the Daimler @-@ Maybach test bed " a crude makeshift " , saying , " as a bicycle , it was 20 years out of date . " 
 = = 1867 – 1869 version = = 
 According to the Smithsonian , Roper 's first velocipede of 1867 – 1869 used a purpose built frame rather than adapting an existing velocipede frame by retrofitting a steam engine , but one contemporary newspaper account does assert that Roper repurposed a velocipede frame , and Setright and motoring author Roland Brown say Roper used a hickory wood frame built by the Hanlon Brothers , who made and demonstrated <unk> at fairs and circuses , although the Smithsonian 's Roper has an iron frame . It had a wheelbase of 49 in ( 1 @,@ 200 mm ) and two 34 in ( 860 mm ) diameter wheels made of iron bands on wooden <unk> with wooden spokes . It had a rigid , forged iron fork , and a solid handlebar with wooden grips . Unlike the modern <unk> , where the grip on only one side is a sleeve that rotates around the handlebar to open the throttle , the Roper velocipede 's entire bar was rotated with both hands , and it had a dual function . When turned forward , the throttle opened , and when turned backwards it applied the spoon brake on the front wheel . The seat doubled as the water reservoir ; or the water tank can be described as saddle shaped . A hand pump transferred water from this tank to the boiler . The boiler was between the wheels with a " nautical looking " chimney from the boiler angling backwards behind the rider , with the firebox in the lower half of this housing , all of which hung from the frame with a spring to absorb shock , while two stay rods attached the bottom of the housing to the back of the frame . There were three water level cocks on the left side , near the water pump , and a drain valve on the bottom . The two cylinders , with bores of about 2 1 ⁄ 4 in ( 57 mm ) were located on either side of the frame , from the upper part of the boiler near the chimney , connecting to 2 1 ⁄ 2 in ( 64 mm ) cranks on the rear wheel . Exhaust steam , conveyed by tubing to the base of the chimney , provided a forced draft . 
 The original 1868 version of the velocipede is attributed to W.W. Austin of Winthrop , Massachusetts by some early newspaper accounts , which were taken up in later histories . Motoring author L. J. K. Setright believes Austin was only the rider or demonstrator of a Roper machine , and had been misidentified as its inventor . Austin is also mentioned as the owner , in 1901 , of both the 1867 – 1869 Roper velocipede and an older four wheeled Roper steam car . The Smithsonian says a " Professor " W.W. Austin had exhibited a Roper steamer of unknown date , leading to the erroneous attrition to Austin instead of Roper . A Roper velocipede was on display at the first New York Auto Show in Madison Square Garden in November 1900 , and again Austin was sometimes described as the inventor . 
 The 1867 – 1869 Roper velocipede , or one like it , was later given to the Smithsonian by John H. Bacon , and is currently in the America on the Move exhibit in the National Museum of American History , Washington , D.C. It is the oldest self @-@ propelled road vehicle in the Smithsonian , and the second oldest in America , after the Dudgeon steamer . 
 = = 1884 – 1896 version = = 
 Roper 's second steam cycle was apparently constructed in 1884 , and was further developed in 1896 , when Colonel Albert Pope , owner of Pope Columbia bicycles safety bicycle , commissioned Roper to build a ' pacer ' for his bicycle racing team , . Motorized bicycle pacers had recently emerged with crude <unk> @-@ based gasoline engines , but these were unreliable and often disappointed racing fans . Pope supplied a Columbia frame to Roper , who added an improved single @-@ cylinder coal fired steam engine to the center of the frame . The weight , including coal and water , was 150 lb ( 68 kg ) . The steam engine normally generated 150 pounds of steam pressure , but could go as high as 185 pounds , which the Boston Daily Globe in 1896 described as equivalent to 8 hp ( 6 @.@ 0 kW ) . Roper was known to regularly ride this machine , which he called his ' self propeller ' , from his home at 299 Eustis Ave in Roxbury to the Boston harbor , a distance of 7 miles , the engine 's maximum range . Roper claimed his machine could ' climb any hill and outrun any horse ' , and American Machinist magazine noted , " the exhaust from the stack was entirely invisible so far as steam was concerned ; a slight noise was perceptible , but not to any disagreeable extent . " . 
 Roper was asked to demonstrate his ' self propeller ' at the Charles River velodrome , a banked concrete bicycle racing track , where he first paced the racing cyclists , then raced professional rider Nat Butler , easily outpacing the bicyclists with timed laps at around 30 mph ( <unk> / mile on the 1 / <unk> track ) . He was then encouraged to give a demonstration of maximum speed , and was timed at over 40 mph , when a ' sudden pallor ' was ween on his face , and his machine wobbled to a stop , Roper falling off his cycle . He died at the track @-@ side with his son Charles , of ' natural causes ' , at age 72 . 
 This machine was on exhibit in the 1960s at <unk> 's Cars of Yesterday in Sarasota , Florida . An 1894 Roper velocipede was lent from the R. J. <unk> family collection to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum 's 2001 expansion , Guggenheim Las Vegas , where The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition was the only show there until the expansion closed in 2003 . It was the fourth venue for the motorcycle design show which had first opened at the Guggenheim New York in 1998 , where the Michaux @-@ Perreaux velocipede had been the first machine viewers saw upon entering the rotunda of the museum . Later , the <unk> Roper velocipede was on view at the 2011 Deeley Motorcycle Exhibition in Vancouver .

Li gets caught in the middle of the crossfire between Ah Jong and the Triad . Ah Jong and Li flee , and while Ah Jong 's wounds are mended , they find themselves bonding and becoming friends . Ah Jong tells Li that should anything happen to him , Li should have Ah Jong 's eyes donated for Jennie 's surgery or use Ah Jong 's money to fly her overseas to have her surgery performed by more experienced doctors . Li , Ah Jong , and Jennie wait in a church for Fung Sei to return with Ah Jong 's money . Fung Sei arrives with the money , horribly beaten by Wong Hoi 's gangsters who have followed him . He is mortally wounded when the hitmen barge into the church . After Ah Jong ends Fung Sei 's misery , he and Li engage in a long and bloody shootout with the Triad all over the church . The battle ends with a Mexican standoff between Ah Jong , Li and Wong Hoi . Ah Jong manages to wound Wong Hoi , but the Triad leader lands two bullets in Ah Jong 's eyes before the latter dies of his wounds .

 Director John Woo has described The Killer as being about " honour and friendship " , " trying to find out if there is something common between two people " and as a " romantic poem " . The structure of the film follows two men on opposite sides of the law who find a relation to each other in their opposition to a greater evil , Wong Hoi , a Triad boss . Li and Ah Jong 's relationship was influenced by the Spy vs. Spy comics from Mad Magazine . Woo recalled " When I was young I was fascinated with the cartoon – I love it very much ... the white bird and the black bird are always against each other , but deep in their heart , they are still friendly , and the idea came from that . " Woo uses Ah Jong and Li as a central motif to illustrate moral points . Scenes with this reflective doubling include the hospital sequence with Li and Ah Jong on opposite sides of a hospital hall and in the final battle scene where Li and Ah Jong are in a standoff with Wong . The focus on male friendships in Woo 's film have been interpreted as homoerotic . Woo has responded to these statements stating " People will bring their own preconceptions to a movie .... If they see something in The Killer that they consider to be homoerotic then that is their privilege . It 's certainly not intentional . " 
 Woo is a Christian and instills his films with religious imagery while stating that The Killer is " not a religious film " . In the opening of The Killer , Ah Jong is found in a church stating he enjoys the " tranquility " . Ah Jong is later found in the church again getting several slugs pulled out of his back showing his intense pain while the altar and cross are shown prominently behind him . The idea was influenced by Martin Scorsese 's film Mean Streets , Woo stated the imagery was used to show that " God is welcoming , no matter if it 's a good or a bad man , everyone is welcome " . 
 Woo draws on animal symbolism throughout the film . He filled the church with doves and pigeons , employing doves to represent the spirits of the people . This was the first film where Woo used the dove symbolism and he has used it to similar effect in Hard Target and Face / Off . A cat appears when Ah Jong first meets Jennie on her visit home , and secondarily when Li 's partner Chang tries to catch Ah Jong in Jennie 's apartment . In Chinese culture , a cat coming into a home is an omen of ruin and poverty for its inhabitants . Both Chang and Jennie meet negative outcomes in the film .

 The Killer was director Woo 's follow @-@ up to A Better Tomorrow 2 which was released in 1987 . The first cut of A Better Tomorrow 2 was too long for the studio so the film was edited within a week separately by both producer Tsui Hark and Woo . According to producer Terence Chang , Tsui Hark felt that John Woo ruined A Better Tomorrow 2 and asked Chang to fire Woo from the studio . When Chang refused , Hark began rejecting Woo 's new film ideas , including ideas for films that would later be made , such as Bullet in the Head and Once a Thief . When Woo proposed the story of The Killer to Tsui Hark , it was denied ; Hark 's reaction was that " [ n ] obody wants to see a film about a killer " . 
 The Killer was not able to be filmed until actor Chow Yun @-@ fat stepped in and enlisted the company he was contracted with , Golden Princess Film , to fund part of the project . Chow had worked previously with Woo on the two A Better Tomorrow films . Woo wanted Danny Lee to play Li Ying , but Lee was under an exclusive contract with Cinema City and was only able to work on The Killer if his production company , Magnum , was involved . John Woo approached his friend , Sally Yeh , asking her to be in a film to play an important female character . Yeh was currently contracted with Tsui Hark and accepted the role but later felt she did not give her best performance . The supporting roles were filled out by friends of the actors and director . Chu Kong was a friend of Chow Yun @-@ fat who had entered retirement and returned to acting in The Killer as a favor . Two of Woo 's close friends joined the cast : actor Kenneth Tsang and screenwriter Barry Wong . Wong Wing @-@ Hang was hired to be the director of photography for The Killer but had to leave the set for an extended period of time , so Peter Pau was added to shoot the rest of the film . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Woo had over 90 days to shoot The Killer which was nearly double the amount of time that the average Hong Kong film was shot in the late 1980s . Woo went into filming with only a short treatment for the film and wrote the details of the script while filming . During promotion periods for the film , Woo described the film as a tribute to Martin Scorsese and French director Jean @-@ Pierre Melville . Woo cites Melville 's Le Samouraï as an influence on the story . Woo borrows plot elements for the film , including the set @-@ up where Jef enters a nightclub and looks at the female singer . Woo also described the influence of a Japanese film , <unk> , about a killer ( Ken <unk> ) who only kills delinquents . When a mob tricks him into killing an innocent person , he swears revenge but then meets a woman who has tuberculosis and wants to go home . The killer promises the woman that he will take her home after getting his revenge . 
 The scene where Danny Lee chases a gunman onto a tram was filmed in Causeway Bay and the crew only had three hours to film . Residents thought it was a real gunfight and phoned the police . However , when the police arrived , Danny Lee talked to the superintendent so they could continue filming . Scenes from the Dragon Boat festival were shot months apart , some footage was of the boat races and rest of the footage involving the actors was shot months later . It was planned for the boats to flip over during the chase but the owners refused because they felt it would bring bad luck . The scene at the airport were filmed at the Kai Tak Airport . The scenes at Paul Chu Kong 's character 's house were filmed in Stanley , Hong Kong . John Woo wanted this house to be by a beach but a suitable location could not be found . The action scene inside the house took 28 days to shoot . The final action scene took 36 days to shoot and was shot at a remote building made to look like a church while the exterior seen from Ah Jong 's apartment is a real church . The original ending of the film involved Jennie waiting at an airport for Li to give her the money and for them to travel to the United States . Due to Sally Yeh 's tight filming schedule , the scene was not filmed and replaced with Ah Jong playing the harmonica . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Tsui and Woo disagreed on the musical aspects of the film . For the opening scene , Woo wanted the singer to perform a jazz song and have the killer playing a saxophone . Tsui rejected this idea as he felt that the Hong Kong audiences did not understand or like jazz . Woo stated that he " had to change it to a Chinese song , the kind of song they always use in Hong Kong movies . " Actress Sally Yeh who performed the Cantopop songs did not feel they were appropriate for the film . The songs were requested by the studio and written specifically for The Killer . 
 The film 's music was composed by Lowell Lo and edited by David Wu . A reoccurring musical theme is a haunting vibraphone theme which is first heard over the opening credits . The harmonica motif in the film was influenced by the soundtracks of Ennio Morricone , specifically the soundtrack to Once Upon a Time in America , and used a bottle blower to give the music a haunting effect . David Wu said the influence of the Harmonica music in Sergio Leone 's western films was a strong influence on his work . During the final action scene when the statue of the Virgin Mary is destroyed , the action music transitions to " Overture " from Messiah by George Frideric Handel . This was the idea of editor David Wu who felt that it would break up the numbing effect of the kinetic violence .

 The Killer was first released in Taiwan in March 1989 with a running time of 124 minutes . It was then cut to its current running time of 110 minutes and released in Hong Kong during July 1989 , Woo felt this cut was " much better " . The film was not an immediate success in Hong Kong due to the Tiananmen Square massacre but eventually gained fame , grossing $ 18 @,@ 255 @,@ 083 and reached ninth at the 1989 Hong Kong box office . At the 9th Hong Kong Film Awards , the film won for Best Director ( John Woo ) and Best Editing ( Fan Kung Ming ) and was also nominated for Best Picture , Best Supporting Actor ( Paul Chu Kong ) , Best Screenplay ( Woo ) and Best Cinematography ( Wong Wing Hang and Peter Pau ) . The Killer was popular in Korea taking seventh highest place in the year end box office receipts . 
 The Killer was shown at several film festivals outside Asia including the 1989 Toronto Film Festival and , during the film 's United States premiere , at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in January 1990 . It was also shown at the Sundance Film Festival in the United States and the Cannes Film Festival in France in 1990 . Film producer Terence Chang suggested that The Killer 's success around the world made several Hong Kong filmmakers jealous : " It created a certain kind of resentment in the Hong Kong film industry . One thing I can say for sure is , the American , European , Japanese , Korean and even the Taiwanese audiences and critics appreciated The Killer a lot more than it was in Hong Kong . " The Killer received a wide release in the United Kingdom on 8 October 1993 .

 The Killer received critical acclaim on its initial release outside Hong Kong with critics focusing their praise on the action scenes in the film . Stephen Holden of The New York Times referred to the film as " Alternately gripping and laughable " and that " The scenes of gore and destruction are even more spectacular than Hong Kong 's fog @-@ shrouded skyline " . Variety gave a positive review , describing the film as an " extremely violent and superbly made actioner demonstrates the tight grasp that director John Woo has on the crime meller genre " . Kathleen Maher of The Austin Chronicle praised the film stating that it " defies all categorization but demands comparisons , if only to prove that there 's never been anything like this before . " Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote a positive review , describing the film as " like eating popcorn , but it 's not just any old brand ; it 's escape @-@ velocity popcorn , popcorn with a slurp of rocket fuel ... [ Woo 's ] ideas overreach themselves with such a virile swagger that they border on comedy . With excess like this you can 't help but laugh . This is a rush of a movie " . The Christian Science Monitor gave the film a mixed review , stating that " This violent Hong Kong thriller has more psychological depth than most of its kind , but ultimately seems like a pointless exercise in style " . 
 Later critiques of the film remained positive . The Washington Post stated that " the plot doesn 't exactly break new crime @-@ story ground . It 's all the Woo flourishes ... that elevates The Killer to another level " . Lucia Bozzola of the online film database Allmovie gave the film a five star rating , and stated it as " One of the high points of 1980s Hong Kong action cinema " . Empire gave the film five stars and proclaimed that " John Woo 's trademark style reached its zenith in The Killer " . In 2010 , Time Out New York ranked The Killer at number 50 on their list of the top 50 foreign films of all time . As of 2014 , The Killer is one of the several films to maintain a perfect 100 % rating on Rotten Tomatoes . In 2014 , Time Out polled several film critics , directors , actors and stunt actors to list their top action films . The Killer was listed at 24th place on this list .

 The Killer is an important and influential film for both Western and Asian filmmakers . Film scholars have noted the similarities between Woo 's style and The Killer with the films Nikita ( 1990 ) and Léon ( 1994 ) directed by French director Luc Besson . Kenneth E. Hall described Léon as having the similar character configuration of a hitman and the person he protects . In Nikita , the main character 's crisis of conscience after performing a number of hits is also seen in The Killer . Lucy <unk> described the style of Nikita as recalling " the work of directors like John Woo . Like Nikita , Woo 's films show alienated and often brutal characters and graphic violence " . In the United States , directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino developed films that were influenced by The Killer . Rodriguez 's films El Mariachi ( 1992 ) and Desperado ( 1995 ) contain stylistic homages to The Killer . In the film Jackie Brown , Tarantino wrote dialog referencing The Killer . No references to the film are made in the original novel . Asian @-@ based directors were also influenced by the film . Hong Kong director Johnnie To borrows from The Killer 's gunfighting style , oppositional character pairing , and parody in his films A Hero Never Dies , Running Out of Time , and <unk> Killer . 
 The Killer was also influential on hip hop music . American hip hop artist , and Wu @-@ Tang Clan member Raekwon released his critically praised debut album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx ... ( 1995 ) that sampled numerous portions of dialog from the film . RZA , the producer of the album described the album 's themes by stating that " Rae and Ghost was two opposite guys as far as neighborhoods was concerned , I used John Woo 's The Killer . [ In that movie ] you got Chow Yun Fat [ playing the role of Ah Jong ] and Danny Lee [ Inspector Li ] . They have to become partners to work shit out . " Woo felt honored that the group sampled The Killer and asked for no monetary return from them . In 2005 , Vibe magazine placed The Killer at number 20 on their list of top fifty films that shaped hip hop .

 In 1992 , American director and writer Walter Hill wrote a screenplay titled The Killer , Based on the Hong Kong Action Film by John Woo that was dated 6 April 1992 . A year later , screenwriters Jim Cash and Jack Epps , Jr. were hired by producers Charles Roven and Robert Cavallo to write a screenplay based on The Killer for Tri @-@ Star Pictures . The press release of this remake stated the script was written for actors Richard Gere and Denzel Washington . In June 1992 , it was announced Walter Hill and David Giler were writing a script titled Hong Kong based on The Killer with Hill directing . The producers had difficulty with the relationship between two main characters in the script as they felt that American audiences would interpret it as a homoerotic one . Producer Terence Chang , who worked with Woo on several productions , suggested to the American producers to have Hong Kong actress Michelle Yeoh play the role of the police officer to resolve any homoerotic reading of the film . A third draft of the script was released by 23 August 1993 which featured a story of a Caucasian hitman living in Hong Kong . This screenplay moved the focus from the pairing the hit man and the police detective characters to the characters of blinded night club singer and the hit man . 
 In October 2007 , The Hollywood Reporter announced that a remake of The Killer was announced with American @-@ Korean director John H. Lee directing . The remake would take place in Los Angeles 's <unk> , Chinatown , and South Central . Lee has stated that The Killer is one of his favourite films and that he is excited to make his own version of the film . Lee 's version was set to be produced by Woo , and star Jung Woo @-@ sung and shot in 3D . Seven Stars Film Studios was slated to finance the production with a screenplay by Josh Campbell . Sarah Li was initially cast to play the role of the blind singer . Woo spoke about the remake in October 2015 , stating that Lee 's film was in development for some time and Lee eventually took on other projects . Woo commented that after completing his film Manhunt , he " probably will go back to Hollywood to make another action thriller . I ’ m going to make The Killer in an American version . " 
 = Persuasion ( 1995 film ) = 
 Persuasion is a 1995 period drama film directed by Roger Michell and based on Jane Austen 's 1817 novel of the same name . In her theatrical film debut , the British actress Amanda Root stars as protagonist Anne Elliot , while Ciarán Hinds plays her romantic interest , Captain Frederick Wentworth . The film is set in 19th century England , nine years after Anne was persuaded by others to reject Wentworth 's proposal of marriage . Persuasion follows the two as they become reacquainted with each other , while supporting characters threaten to interfere . 
 The film was adapted by the writer Nick Dear , who considered the story more mature than Austen 's other novels . He characterised it as one of realism and truthfulness , particularly in telling the story of two people separated and then reunited . As Austen 's narrative style conveys Anne 's thoughts internally , Dear and Root felt compelled to express the character 's emotions using comparatively little dialogue . Persuasion was shot in chronological order , allowing the actress to portray Anne 's development from being downtrodden to happy and blossoming . 
 Originally the BBC was the sole producer of Persuasion , until it partnered with the American company WGBH Boston and the French company Millesime . This decision gave the production a larger budget and allowed it to be filmed at locations featured in the novel , including Lyme Regis and Bath . Michell believed this was Austen 's most emotional and poignant novel , as well as her most autobiographical . While directing , he avoided what he felt was the polished , artificial feel of other 19th @-@ century depictions , and discouraged his actors from wearing make @-@ up or appearing too hygienic . Costume designer Alexandra Byrne produced clothing that appeared " lived @-@ in " , winning a BAFTA for her efforts . 
 Persuasion was filmed during a period of popularity for Austen 's works ; it was one of six adaptations of her novels produced during the mid @-@ 1990s . The film originally aired on 16 April 1995 , when it broadcast on the British television channel BBC Two . Sony Pictures Classics released the film in American cinemas on 27 September 1995 , as Austen 's increasing popularity became apparent to Hollywood . Persuasion 's cinematic release attracted the attention of film critics , and it received generally positive reviews , with many praising Root 's performance . Film scholars have since observed significant changes from the source material , as well as class and gender themes . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The film opens by cutting back and forth between scenes of a naval ship carrying Admiral Croft ( John Woodvine ) , and a buggy carrying Mr. Shepherd ( David Collings ) and his daughter Mrs. Clay ( Felicity Dean ) to Kellynch Hall . Shepherd and Clay are accosted by creditors due to the debts owed by the residence 's owner , Sir Walter Elliot ( Corin Redgrave ) , while Croft discusses the end of the Napoleonic Wars with fellow men of the navy . Sir Walter , a vain foppish baronet , is faced with financial ruin unless he <unk> . Though Sir Walter initially opposes the idea , he eventually agrees to temporarily move to Bath while the hall is let ; the idea came from Shepherd , family friend Lady Russell ( Susan Fleetwood ) , and Sir Walter 's second eldest daughter , the intelligent Anne ( Amanda Root ) . 
 Anne is visibly upset upon learning that the new tenant of Kellynch Hall will be Admiral Croft , who is the brother @-@ in @-@ law of Frederick Wentworth ( Ciarán Hinds ) — a naval captain she was persuaded to reject in marriage nine years previously because of his lack of prospects and connections . Wentworth is now wealthy from serving in the Wars , and has returned to England , presumably to find a wife . Later , Anne expresses to Lady Russell her unhappiness at her family 's current financial predicament , and her past decision to reject the captain 's proposal of marriage . Anne visits her other sister Mary ( Sophie Thompson ) , a hypochondriac who has married into a local farming family . Anne patiently listens to the various complaints confided in her by each of the Musgrove family ; this includes Mary 's husband Charles , sisters @-@ in @-@ law Louisa ( Emma Roberts ) and Henrietta ( Victoria Hamilton ) , and parents @-@ in @-@ law Mr and Mrs Musgrove ( Roger Hammond and Judy Cornwell ) . 
 Captain Wentworth comes to dine with the Musgroves , but Anne avoids going when she volunteers to nurse Mary 's injured son . The following morning at breakfast , Anne and Mary are suddenly met briefly by Wentworth , the first time he and Anne have seen each other since she rejected him . Anne later hears that Wentworth thought her so altered that he " would not have known [ her ] again " . Louisa and Henrietta begin to pursue marriage with Wentworth , as the family is unaware of his and Anne 's past relationship . Hurt and rejected by Anne 's refusal years before , Wentworth appears to court Louisa , much to Anne 's chagrin . Later , Wentworth learns Anne also was persuaded by Lady Russell to refuse Charles ' offer of marriage , after which Charles instead proposed to Mary . 
 Anne , Wentworth , and the younger Musgroves go to Lyme and visit two of Wentworth 's old naval friends , Captain Harville ( Robert Glenister ) and Captain Benwick ( Richard McCabe ) . While there , Louisa rashly jumps off a staircase in the hopes Wentworth will catch her , sustaining a head injury . Afterwards , Anne goes to Bath to stay with her father and sister . Sir Walter and Elizabeth reveal they have repaired their relationship with a previously disreputable cousin , Mr. Elliot ( Samuel West ) , the heir to the Elliot baronetcy and estate . Anne is introduced to him , and they realise they briefly saw each other in Lyme . Much to Lady Russell 's pleasure , Mr. Elliot begins to court Anne , but she remains uncertain of his true character . Meanwhile , Louisa has recovered and become engaged to Captain Benwick . Wentworth arrives in Bath and encounters Anne on several occasions , though their conversations are brief . 
 Anne learns from an old friend , Mrs. Smith ( Helen Schlesinger ) , that Mr. Elliot is bankrupt and only interested in marrying Anne to help ensure his inheritance from her father . Anne also is told that Mr. Elliot wishes to keep the baronet from possibly marrying Mrs. Clay to produce a male heir . Soon after , Wentworth overhears Anne talking with Captain Harville about the constancy of a woman 's love , and writes her a letter declaring that he still cares for her . Anne quickly finds him and the two happily walk off down a street , arm in arm . That night at a party , Wentworth announces his intention to marry Anne , much to Mr. Elliot 's consternation . The final scene shows Wentworth and Anne on a naval ship , happy to be together .

 The filming of Persuasion coincided with a sudden resurgence of Jane Austen adaptations , as it was one of six such productions released during the mid @-@ 1990s . The media dubbed the phenomenon " <unk> " . While it was common for a successful adaptation to lead to the production of others , this surge in Austen 's popularity involved many simultaneous projects — Persuasion 's production , for instance , coincided with the TV serial Pride and Prejudice and the feature film Sense and Sensibility . Despite the surge , film scholar Andrew Higson and others argue that there is little evidence that the various producers — who were employed by different companies — communicated when conceiving their adaptations . 
 The idea for a film version of the 1817 Austen novel Persuasion began with the English producer Fiona Finlay , who had wanted to create an adaptation for several years . The novel had last been adapted by ITV in a 1971 serial starring Ann Firbank . Finlay felt that the " very romantic " story was one " everyone can relate to . There 's something very touching about long @-@ lost love " . She approached the writer Nick Dear about adapting it for television ; Finlay had enjoyed his contributions to theatre , particularly his play about William Hogarth , The Art of Success . Dear first suggested they try one of Austen 's other works — either Sense and Sensibility or Pride and Prejudice — but agreed to adapt Persuasion after reading it . Dear considered the novel — the author 's last completed work — a maturer story than the others . 
 Dear later wrote that Persuasion was superficially " a love story in the Cinderella mould " but it was also one of " realism and truthfulness " , particularly in telling the story of two people separated and then reunited . He spent two years working on a script , and found this task difficult for several reasons . First , he needed to find a structure that would be faithful to the novel . Second , his protagonist barely spoke for the first half , and " therefore can 't motor the action along as a central character conventionally does " . Adapting Austen 's wit was another challenge ; much could not be used " because it 's almost all in the author 's voice telling us about characters , with a certain wit or lightness that came from the characters themselves . It 's a craft job , interpreting the novel for oneself and then finding a film language for it " . 
 An experienced theatre and serial director , Roger Michell was chosen to direct Persuasion , in what was to be his first feature film . As a young child , Michell had been an admirer of Austen 's , which set him apart from his male classmates . " I was the only boy in my class who took Austen as a special paper " , he said . His attraction to Persuasion was based on his belief that it was Austen 's most emotional and poignant novel , as well as her most autobiographical . He described the work as an " erotic love story which is full of sexual yearning " . While directing , Michell sought to emphasise contrasts in Austen 's story , seen for instance between " the chilly formality of Kellynch Hall and the warm , wet feel of Uppercross " . The Royal Navy was another point of interest , as officers like Wentworth would often have returned to society wealthy and full of stories . The director wished to depict the integration of cultures , as naval officers came back with " an informality of behaviour and language which was in marked contrast to what was there before " . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Root made her theatrical film debut playing Anne Elliot , the film 's protagonist . According to Root , " every actress in England " read for the part . Having worked with the director previously on the 1993 TV serial The Buddha of Suburbia , Root won the role by writing him a letter to gain an audition . The character was described to Root as " haggard " , which attracted the actress . " I relish a job like this , starting off downtrodden and gradually blossoming " , she said . WGBH Boston , the American company co @-@ producing the film , had wanted a better known actress for the part but agreed to Root 's casting after seeing Root 's screen test . 
 Root came to realise that while the novel 's narrative style allowed Anne 's thoughts to come through , the film adaptation offered comparatively little dialogue . As a result , she " had to cover pages and pages of the story without uttering anything , much of the time . I couldn 't even think about technique , I just had to keep looking at the [ novel ] and then somehow radiate the feelings " . Persuasion was shot in chronological order , which allowed Root to see " what a difference [ her character 's ] sense of unhappiness can create " , as by the end of the film Anne is " happier and looks better " . Root considered the role to be much quieter than her experiences working with the Royal Shakespeare Company , which included her portrayal of Lady Macbeth . The Irish actor Ciarán Hinds , who depicted Frederick Wentworth , commented that Austen " understands a man 's heart and how delicate it can be sometimes " . He also appreciated that , though Wentworth was a " competent leader of men in his profession " , he was " socially inept " in Anne 's presence . Susan Fleetwood , the actress who played Lady Russell , had also worked with Michell on The Buddha of Suburbia . She died soon after filming ; Persuasion was her last film role . 
 = = = Make @-@ up and costume design = = = 
 Michell attempted to be as faithful to the novel as possible , in particular avoiding what he felt was the polished , artificial feel of other period dramas set in the 19th @-@ century . The director explained , " I was desperately trying to make it feel like it could be happening in the next room . I tried to make it something which is absolutely about real people and not about dressing or hairstyles or carpet " . Consequently , because he felt the realistic look of the age would make the film more dramatic , Michell chose to depict the actors without make @-@ up , and disallowed them from looking too hygienic . Root commented about the film 's natural look in an interview , " I basically didn 't wear any makeup [ in the film ] , and my hair was obviously set in a very unflattering way ... I suppose the lighting was quite harsh , as well . None of us looked good " . She said in a separate interview , " I wanted to make Anne Elliot a somewhat plain woman who was not really miserable but had found a way to be content somehow , and yet emotions are buzzing around her all the time " . Root believed the film 's realistic depiction of the age was a key aspect of its appeal . 
 The film 's costume design was overseen by Alexandra Byrne , who created clothing that appeared " lived @-@ in " and " realistic " . Like Fleetwood , Byrne had also worked with Michell on The Buddha of Suburbia . It was her first time designing period costumes for film . During shooting , the crew often had to compete for costumes and props with the BBC production Pride and Prejudice , which was being filmed at the same time . Persuasion 's crew consequently had to send for replacement items from Italy and Australia . For her work in the film , Byrne won a BAFTA for Best Costume Design . 
 Louise Watson , writing for Screenonline , felt the film 's costume and make @-@ up help " convey the full Cinderella transformation of Austen 's heroine . At first the undervalued family martyr , Anne is the wallflower who has lost her ' bloom ' . Her loose @-@ fitting costumes hint at how she has pined away since refusing Wentworth ... As she regains her confidence , she blossoms ; she dresses <unk> , her eyes sparkle and her features become animated " . Paulette Richards argues that the film 's " unreliable " male characters , such as Sir Walter , are identified as such by the flamboyant nature of their clothing . This flamboyance is especially clear to modern viewers , who live in a culture where " real men " are expected to care little for their clothing . Conversely , the film 's Wentworth is typically depicted in naval uniforms , which is a contrast to Bryan Marshall 's version of the character in the 1971 adaptation . This uniform helps set Wentworth apart from many of the other male characters , allowing him to appear romantic but isolated . Gina and Andrew MacDonald had a similar view of the film , writing that it accurately captures Austen 's satire by juxtaposing the upper classes ' extravagance in fashion with the virtuous qualities of the Royal Navy . The naval men 's profession is emphasised by the frequency of wearing their uniforms , in contrast to other adaptations of the novel .

 As a BBC production , Persuasion originally received a budget of £ 750 @,@ 000 . The British broadcaster proposed a collaboration with the American public television station WGBH Boston , a partnership that had also produced the American anthology television series Masterpiece Theatre as well as literary adaptations like the serial Pride and Prejudice . Rebecca Eaton , executive producer of Masterpiece Theatre , approved the co @-@ production as she had a preference for Persuasion out of all Austen 's novels . The decision led to additional funding . Eaton would cite Persuasion as a successful example of WGBH using its small budget to invest in television projects , though she later expressed regret that the adaptation was two hours rather than a " luscious " six @-@ part miniseries . Additionally , the French company Millesime co @-@ produced the film in exchange for airing it on television in France . This decision further increased funding to £ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . Mobil Oil Corporation , a major sponsor of Masterpiece Theatre , co @-@ produced the film . 
 The diverse sources of funding meant that the production team had to field opinions from various sources . Millesime was unhappy with certain aspects of the story , for instance wanting the entire Lyme sequence removed because they considered it " too boring " . WGBH gave the BBC detailed notes , which were then integrated into the script . One change concerned the ending . To display the climax when Anne and Wentworth finally approach each other with their feelings , two different scenes were shot , one in which they kiss and one in which they do not . Dear first wrote a scene closely modelled after Austen 's ending : Anne reunites with Wentworth on the streets of Bath , and the two exchange words and hold hands . Eaton felt that after hours of waiting , audiences " would go nuts with frustration and irritation " if the two did not kiss . Eaton also thought " a kiss would be an emotional pay @-@ off " , and WGBH believed it would give the film a wider appeal . Michell agreed to compromise , opting to shoot one British version and one American version — the latter included the kiss . The American ending is reflected on the international poster , which shows the two protagonists embracing . While the kiss attracted some criticism among fans , actress Amanda Root defended it . " After the great suspense of the story , by the end you 're desperate for Anne and Captain Wentworth to get together , desperate ! Film is a visual medium , after all . You don 't necessarily want to see them in bed together , but you do want to see something like a kiss " , she said . 
 In comparison to its adaptations of the 1970s and 1980s , the BBC provided increased funding for many of its productions in the 1990s . Persuasion consequently benefited , allowing it to frequently film on @-@ location in places including Lyme Regis and Bath , and in the south @-@ eastern English countryside . Both Lyme and Bath are prominent locales in Austen 's novel . Dear desired the opening sequence be on board a Royal Navy ship of the period , but the only authentic vessel available was the HMS Victory . It was dry docked as part of a museum in Portsmouth , and filming was only possible during short periods when the vessel was closed to the public . The final shot , in which Anne and Wentworth gaze into the ocean , was taken from the 1984 historical film The Bounty . The film 's low budget also resulted in one of the opening shots , depicting Admiral Croft 's ship on the ocean , being taken from The Bounty . 
 = = Themes and analysis = = 
 = = = Changes from source material = = = 
 While Dear has received praise for " remarkably ... retain [ ing ] most of the source novel 's complex plot and numerous characters " , literary scholars have noted significant differences between the film and the source material . Sarah R. Morrison observes that the film 's version of Anne articulates thoughts that the character would never say in the novel . Morrison cites Anne 's adamant defence of her visit to Mrs. Smith — where Anne visits a poor old friend rather than go to the party of a titled relative — in the film as an example , as " Austen 's narrator makes it abundantly clear that Anne would never presume to dispute with her father upon such terms of absolute equality " . The film 's Anne also engages in actions not visible in the novel , such as her haste to stop Wentworth from leaving a musical concert when he feels demeaned by disparaging comments about his profession . Morrison attributes these differences to the difficulty in adapting novel to film , particularly as the latter form lacks a narrator to convey Anne 's inner thoughts . 
 The film also expands upon Austen 's subtle characterisation by exaggerating the emotions of characters and certain scenes . For example , in the novel during an early party Anne offers to play the pianoforte like usual ; while doing so , she is slightly tearful but also " extremely glad to be employed " and " unobserved " . Conversely , Dear 's screenplay has Wentworth quickly giving up his seat to Anne and then immediately dancing with the Musgrove sisters , furthering the contrast between Anne and the others . According to David Monaghan , Austen 's novel displays a " relatively radical vision " of societal change , such as the rise of a professional class challenging the old order of landed gentry . Monaghan posits that this vision appealed to Dear and Michell , who used visuals and movement to emphasise this change . However , the two " deviate significantly " from the source material by depicting Anne and Wentworth as " single @-@ mindedly oriented " to the future and thus 20th @-@ century viewers ' sensibilities . 
 Sue Parrill observes that Persuasion 's larger production budget , which allowed the crew to film much content on @-@ location , " enabled the filmmakers to make fuller use of setting for symbolism and for creation of mood " . The weather , for instance , is particularly important to Anne 's state of mind in the novel . Persuasion 's opening scenes establish its historical context , as well as the financial predicament in which the Elliot family finds itself . Indeed , for Rachel Brownstein , by opening the film with a depiction of sailors , the director is confronting a common complaint of Austen 's works — her failure to mention the Napoleonic Wars . The juxtaposition between the navy and the Elliots establishes their differences , with the former group discussing the fall of Napoleon and the latter group discussing the relatively minor inconvenience of overspending . 
 = = = Class and gender = = = 
 In his introduction to the published screenplay , Dear said he was in part attracted to adapt Persuasion because it depicted a " world in transition " . To him , the novel showed " an old order fading away into decadence , and a new tribe , a meritocracy , coming to the fore " . While directing , Roger Michell felt that the story included " the prototype of the postmodern family " — Anne 's mother is dead , her father is bankrupt , and " the old social orders are breaking down " . Root described Anne as a " feminist in a prefeminist period " and a " strong , independent character " , to whom modern viewers can relate despite the story 's period setting . 
 Austen scholars have studied the film 's intersection with class and social change . Carole M. Dole notes that , among the many productions of Austen 's work that appeared in the 1990s , Persuasion was the only one to " insistently draw attention to class issues " , and " provide striking visual testimony to the workings of the British class system " . The film , she adds , accomplishes this in part by focusing on the servants ' faces , gauging their negative reactions to events . Richards , too , finds Michell " visually more aware " of the lower classes , adding that the film 's inclusion of black servants alludes to the " colonial sources of wealth " supporting those superior in class and rank . Anne @-@ Marie Scholz writes that the film and Emma Thompson 's Sense and Sensibility both highlight the theme of class , but in different ways . Unlike Sense and Sensibility , Persuasion depicts general class divisions rather than just how the working class impacts the protagonists — the camera focuses on the faces and expressions of servants and working people , personifying them . 
 In Michell 's opinion , Austen was a " proto @-@ feminist " who possessed a " clear @-@ sighted vision of the ways the world is tilted against women " . As evidence , Michell cites a book scene in which Anne discusses how songs and proverbs about women 's fickleness were all written by men . Scholz argues that Anne 's marginal status as a woman in the film is linked to that of the servants ; the parallel between class and gender is conveyed with Anne 's trip to Uppercross in a cart containing animals . Julianne Pidduck adds that the director " pointedly foregrounds themes of class and gendered social constraint by juxtaposing the stuffy interiors of mannered society with the inviting , open horizons of the sea " . As an example , Pidduck discusses Anne 's stay in a gated residence in Bath , where she gazes out of an upper story window in search for Wentworth on the streets below . To her , Wentworth and the sea represent freedom and possibility .

 Persuasion premiered on 16 April 1995 , Easter Day , on the British television channel BBC Two . An estimated 3 @.@ 8 million viewers watched the production . BBC Two aired it again on 25 December , Christmas Day . It also later aired on the American television channel PBS on 6 April 1997 . 
 Near the end of filming , Rebecca Eaton noticed the growing " buzz " surrounding Austen and costume dramas in Hollywood . WGBH had never made a theatrical film before , but " decided to try its luck on the big screen " . Sony Pictures Classics saw a cut of the adaptation and requested permission to show it in American cinemas , releasing it on 27 September 1995 . There , it was characterised as an " art @-@ house " film , with a small niche audience . It was shown at the Toronto and Chicago International Film Festivals . Persuasion earned $ 56 @,@ 000 in its first week of release in New York , and grossed $ 150 @,@ 000 in Los Angeles . The total US gross was $ 5 @,@ 269 @,@ 757 . It was less financially successful than the popular Sense and Sensibility , which was released in cinemas several months later . The film was released in VHS format on 12 November 1996 ; a DVD version followed on 1 February 2000 . 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 Upon its release , Persuasion at first failed to attract many critical reviews . This changed when Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility were released in late 1995 to great success in the UK . Their reception lifted the earlier film out of obscurity , as Austen 's popularity became apparent among critics . Persuasion garnered highly positive reviews from major film critics , and critical review website Rotten Tomatoes has since calculated a rating of 83 % , which refers to the percentage of positive reviews . Caryn James of The New York Times deemed it a " critic 's pick " , praising " a cast completely in sync with Austen 's warm but piercing style " . Jay Carr of The Boston Globe highlighted Root 's performance , calling it " a heart @-@ stoppingly reticent yet glorious debut " . 
 In a contribution for The Washington Post , Desson Howe said " there 's a wonderful , unhurried delicacy about Persuasion ... as if everyone concerned with the production knows that , if given time and patience , Austen 's genius will emerge . Thanks to assured performances , exacting direction and , of course , inspired writing , it does , in subtle , glorious ways " . Writing for Entertainment Weekly , critic Ken Tucker graded the film with an " A – " , saying it " should enthral even those who haven 't read " the novel . Tucker concluded that the film was " the sort of passionate yet precise comedy that reminds me why Austen remains such a vital writer " . Susan Ostrov Weisser , a professor of nineteenth @-@ century literature , called the film a " faithful parade of Austen 's world " , and praised Root as the film 's " crown jewel " for playing a " fiercely intelligent , regretful , and frustrated Anne Elliot with subtlety and nuance " . In 2008 , James Rampton of The Independent rated it the fourth best Austen adaptation of all time . 
 When reviewing , film critics often compared the respective adaptations of Persuasion and Sense and Sensibility . Thompson 's film received more recognition and accolades from Hollywood , while Michell 's production gained the admiration of up @-@ market critics , who felt it was a more authentic and thoughtful representation of Austen 's world . Janet Maslin of The New York Times , for instance , wrote that Sense and Sensibility " can 't match the brilliant incisiveness of the more spartan Persuasion , still the most thoughtful new Austen adaptation " . The Los Angeles Times characterised Persuasion as " the most authentically British version and the one closest to the spirit of the novels " and Sense and Sensibility as " the audience @-@ friendly Hollywood version of Austen , easygoing and aiming to please " . Time magazine named them both the best films of 1995 , referring to Persuasion as " reserved " and Sense and Sensibility as " more bustling " . Higson , when analysing both productions , felt Persuasion captured a sense of " gritty realism " that would influence such later Austen adaptations as Mansfield Park ( 1999 ) and Becoming Jane ( 2007 ) .

 = Adlington Hall = 
 For Adlington Hall , Lancashire see Adlington Hall , Lancashire 
 Adlington Hall is a country house near Adlington , Cheshire . The oldest part of the existing building , the Great Hall , was constructed between 1480 and 1505 ; the east wing was added in 1581 . The Legh family has lived in the hall and in previous buildings on the same site since the early 14th century . After the house was occupied by Parliamentary forces during the Civil War , changes were made to the north wing , including encasing the Great Hall in brick , inserting windows , and installing an organ in the Great Hall . In the 18th century the house was inherited by Charles Legh who organised a series of major changes . These included building a new west wing , which incorporated a ballroom , and a south wing with a large portico . It is possible that Charles Legh himself was the architect for these additions . He also played a large part in planning and designing the gardens , woodland and parkland , which included a number of buildings of various types , including a bridge known as the Chinese Bridge that carried a summerhouse . 
 The hall was reconstructed and reduced in size in 1928 . The work included demolition of much of the west wing , building a screen wall to fill the gap , and removing parts of the south wing . During the 19th and early 20th centuries the gardens , parkland and woodland became overgrown , and the condition of some of the buildings in them deteriorated . From the middle of the 20th century , work has been undertaken to restore some of the parkland and its buildings , and to create new formal gardens near the hall . 
 Adlington Hall is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building . The stable block has been converted for modern uses ; part of it is listed at Grade II * , and the rest is at Grade II . The grounds contain eleven Grade II listed buildings , and the grounds themselves have been designated at Grade II * on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens . The hall is open to the public for visits and guided tours , and parts of the building can be hired for weddings and social functions . 
 = = History = = 
 The first known building on the site was a Saxon hunting lodge for Earl Edwin . After the Norman conquest the estate was given to Hugh Lupus , and it remained in the possession of the Norman earls until 1221 , when it passed to the Crown . Henry III granted the manor to Hugh de Corona . Hugh 's son Thomas , who had no children , granted it to his sister Ellen , who married John de Legh of Booth in the early 14th century during the reign of Edward II , after which it became the ancestral home of the Leghs of Adlington . Originally the hall consisted of timber @-@ framed buildings on three or four sides of a courtyard surrounded by a moat . The Great Hall , on the north side of the courtyard , was built between 1480 and 1505 for Thomas Legh I. The east wing and porch were added for Thomas Legh III in 1581 . During the Civil War the hall was held by Colonel Thomas Legh for the Royalists but was taken twice , in 1642 and in 1644 , by the Parliamentary forces . The hall was returned to the Leghs in 1656 , and the north front was restored in 1660 . Between 1665 and 1670 the north wing was rebuilt for Thomas Legh IV . Windows were inserted and along with the Great Hall , excluding the porch , it was encased in brick . 
 The estate was inherited in 1739 by Charles Legh , who embarked on a major programme of reconstruction , transforming the hall " from a medium @-@ sized Tudor house into a large Georgian manor " . He built a new west wing , which contained a dining room , a drawing room , a library , and a ballroom , the last occupying the whole length of the first floor . He then rebuilt the south wing , connecting it with the new west wing and the older Tudor east wing . At each end of the south wing was a pavilion with a canted bay on its south front . The west pavilion contained the southern end of the ballroom , and the east pavilion housed a chapel . During this time the stable block and other buildings were constructed in the grounds . The architect responsible for this work is unknown , although it has been suggested that the design was by Charles himself . A major reconstruction took place in 1928 under the direction of the architect Hubert Worthington . Much of the west wing was demolished , removing the ballroom but retaining the drawing and dining rooms . To avoid leaving a gap exposing the courtyard , Worthington filled it with a screen wall containing a corridor linking the west and south wings . He decorated this with quoins , cornices and sash windows . The projecting pavilions at the ends of the south front were also demolished . In the 1960s the stable block was converted into mews flats . Between 2004 and 2009 the east wing was restored .

 The plan of the hall consists of four ranges or wings arranged as a quadrangle around a courtyard , and comprises a mixture of architectural styles . The north and east wings are in 15th- and 16th @-@ century black @-@ and @-@ white timber framing , and the south and west wings are in brick dating from the middle of the 18th century . The north front is in brick with stone quoins enclosing the timber @-@ framing . It is irregular , in two or three storeys with six gables . It contains a mixture of 12- and 16 @-@ pane sash windows , and two Venetian windows . On the courtyard side is a two @-@ storey timber @-@ framed porch bearing a long inscription dated 1581 . The east wing is timber @-@ framed , with close studding , on a rubble stone plinth . It contains mullioned and transomed windows , a small oriel window , and 12- and 16 @-@ pane sash windows . There is also a two @-@ storey staircase turret . The south wing is in Flemish bond brick with sandstone dressings . It is symmetrical , in two and three storeys , and 13 bays . It is set on a low stone plinth , and has rusticated quoins . In the centre is a portico rising to the full height of the building . This consists of four plain Ionic columns each of which is carried on an octagonal pedestal . It has a frieze bearing the inscription " CHARLES & <unk> <unk> 1757 " , and its pediment contains the Legh arms . Behind the portico are two round @-@ arched windows and a round @-@ arched door on the ground floor , over which is a window with a Palladian pediment . On each side of the portico are 12 @-@ pane sash windows under flat rusticated heads . Only the left and right ends of the west wing are still present , and they are joined by a screen wall . Inside the courtyard , on the south and west sides , is a cloister . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 The major part of the north wing is occupied by the medieval Great Hall . This has a hammer @-@ beam roof , with carvings of angels that were added at a later date . The roof is plastered , but has been painted in such a way that it appears to be panelled . At the end that would have originally been occupied by the high table is " the finest canopy in the county " , according to the authors of the Buildings of England series . This is " a rare wooden version of the cloths of estate hung over the high table in the Middle Ages to give splendour to the appearance of the Lord of the Manor " . It consists of five tiers of panels , divided by oak ribs into 60 compartments , each of which is painted with the arms of Cheshire families . At the intersections of the ribs , instead of bosses , there are carved letters spelling out an inscription including the date 1505 . At one time the scheme may have been greater , as an account dated 1611 records a display of over 180 coats of arms . Under the canopy is a mural of Hector and Andromache . The side walls contain murals depicting the history of Troy . The latter had been painted over until they were revealed in 1859 , when the family were playing with a <unk> and damaged the overlying plaster . The other end of the hall is supported by a spere truss formed by two giant oak trunks , carved into an octagonal shape and covered in panels . Within the spere truss is an organ ( see below ) . To the sides of the organ are murals depicting , on one side Arabella Hunt , and on the other Saint Cecilia playing a harp . Below the murals were the doors to the buttery and pantry . Both doors are now blocked , replaced by panels carved with animals and foliage . Also in the Great Hall is a fireplace decorated with the head of Apollo . 
 In the west wing are the surviving rooms from Charles Legh 's extension , the dining room on the ground floor and the drawing room above it . Both rooms are panelled and decorated in Classical style , with pediments over the doors and chimneypieces . The dining room is the simpler of the two , and contains a white marble fireplace that has been dated to 1742 . The fireplace in the drawing room is also in white marble but is more elaborate , carved with scrolls , garlands , and a profile of Minerva . This room also contains giant Corinthian pilasters . Above its doors are wood @-@ carvings in the style of William Kent , depicting the heads of Bacchus , Ceres , Flora , and Neptune . The rooms in the south wing include family sitting rooms decorated with Rococo style ceilings , and Gothic and <unk> motifs . Also in the rooms of this wing are items moved from the demolished parts of the west wing . The east wing contains service rooms . 
 = = Organ = = 
 The organ was installed in the Great Hall in the late 17th century . There is some dispute in respect of the precise date of installation and the builder . It was probably built in about 1670 , and has been attributed to Bernard " Father " Smith , but " no conclusive evidence has come to light either to substantiate or to dismiss this theory " . It has two manuals , no pedals , and fourteen speaking stops . It includes three 17th @-@ century reed stops , which is a rarity for the time . The organ was " remade " in about 1680 by Christian Smith , and rebuilt in 1741 – 42 by Glyn and Parker . In 1958 – 59 it was restored by Noel Mander , at which time it had been derelict for a century or more . The organ has a " very fine Renaissance case " , in two tiers . In the lower tier are the two manual keyboards over which is a row of pipes . The upper tier consists of five panels containing pipes , which are flanked by Corinthian pilasters . Over the top is a large curved hood containing gilded statues of putti playing trumpets , and a coat of arms celebrating the marriage of John Legh to Isabella <unk> in 1693 . The hall 's website states it is " without doubt England 's most important surviving instrument from the late 17th century " . It has been awarded a Historic Organ Certificate . The organ was filmed and recorded for the documentary The Elusive English Organ . 
 The composer Handel was a friend of the Legh family and played the organ in 1741 or 1742 . He also composed the music for a hunting song , the words of which had been written by Charles Legh . There is a tradition that Handel composed The Harmonious Blacksmith at the hall , but it is not possible to confirm this . 
 = = Grounds = = 
 The hall is surrounded by a landscape park and woodland , covering in total about 160 acres ( 65 ha ) . In addition to the buildings in the grounds , Charles Legh played a large part in designing the layout of the gardens in the 18th century . Over the years parts of the grounds have become overgrown , and the condition of the buildings has deteriorated . Since the 1950s work has been carried out to improve the grounds , and to develop parts of the gardens in a more modern style . To the north of the house a rose garden has been created and , beyond that a yew maze . 
 To the southeast of the hall is the stable block which partly surrounds a courtyard . It has a south front of nine bays , the middle three of which project forwards and have a pediment carried on four large Doric pilasters . The block originally had a cupola , but this has been removed . A formal garden has been built between the east wing and the stable block . Standing in this garden is a lead statue of a reclining , naked male figure , said to be Father Tiber , the river god . This formerly stood in the Wilderness garden . On the wall behind the statue are two carved unicorn heads , the emblem of the Legh family . These formerly stood on pillars at the eastern entrance to the grounds . The statues have been designated as a Grade II listed building . A Grade II building is one that is " nationally important and of special interest " . To the south of the formal garden is a stone statue of Napoleon carved by George Turner and dated 1837 . To the west of the hall is a ha @-@ ha in rubble sandstone dating from the 18th century . It was built to act as a barrier between the west side of the garden and the deer park beyond it , and is listed Grade II . Immediately to the south of the hall is a circular lawn , in the centre of which is a sundial that probably dates from about 1825 . Constructed in ashlar buff sandstone and standing on a pair of circular steps , it consists of an octagonal base with a partly fluted baluster supporting an octagonal moulded capstone . The capstone carries a copper plate inscribed with Roman numerals and the initials " TL " , and has a simple triangular gnomon . The sundial is also listed Grade II . Leading south from the lawn is a walk known as the Lime Avenue , which is entered through gates dated 1688 . The gates are in wrought iron and the piers in ashlar buff gritstone ; these are again listed Grade II . The avenue leads to another Grade II listed building , a structure known as the Shell House , so @-@ called because its interior is decorated with shells and coloured mirrors . It is a single @-@ storey cottage constructed in red brick with buff sandstone dressings . The roof is in stone @-@ slate and the chimney is brick . The wall is in brick with a stone coping . In front of Shell Cottage another sundial , also listed Grade II . This was probably built in the early 18th century for John Legh , and moved to its present position in the middle of that century . It is thought that the pillar on which it stands was originally a Saxon cross base . The octagonal copper plate is inscribed with Roman numerals , the longitude of Adlington , and John Legh 's initials . To the front of the Shell House is another walk , known as the Yew Walk . At the back and side of the house is a rockery . To the south and west of the Shell House is a wooded area known as the Wilderness , through which runs the River Dean ( or Dene ) . Many of the winding paths created by Charles Legh in the Wilderness are now overgrown , and some of the buildings are in a poor condition , or have collapsed into ruin . One building still in good condition is the Tig House , a small square pavilion overlooking the river , an early example of a building in the <unk> style . It is constructed in red brick and partly clad in black and white timber framing . It has a stone @-@ slate pyramidal roof with a wooden finial , and is listed Grade II . Near to this is the a bridge known as the Chinese Bridge crossing the river , but the summerhouse which once stood on the bridge is no longer present . Another structure in the Wilderness is the Temple of Diana . This is a circular temple with a dome constructed in ashlar buff sandstone . It stands on a stylobate which supports six Doric columns and an entablature . The structure is listed Grade II . This appears to be in good condition , but in the early 2000s was said to be suffering from damp . Other buildings known as the <unk> and the Hermitage , have been damaged by falling trees . At the north entrance to the grounds is a pair of gate piers that are listed Grade II . The piers are in rusticated ashlar sandstone and are surmounted by ball finials . The gates are iron and are similar to those at the end of the lime avenue . At the other end of the grounds , at the site of the former south approach , is a pair of sandstone gate piers dating from the middle of the 18th century . They originally carried the carved unicorn heads that are now in the formal garden , and were left isolated when the route of the turnpike road was moved . They are listed Grade II .

 Adlington Hall stands in open countryside to the west of the village of Adlington , Cheshire , England . It was designated a Grade I listed building on 25 July 1952 . Grade I listing means that the building is acknowledged to be " of exceptional interest , sometimes considered to be internationally important " . The hall is still privately owned by the Legh family , who live in the hall . It is open to the public and for guided tours for groups at advertised times . The Great Hall and the Hunting Lodge are available to be hired for weddings and social functions . The south wing of the stable block has been converted into eight flats and is known as The Mews . It has been designated as a Grade II * listed building . Grade II * listing applies to " particularly important buildings of more than special interest " . The east wing is listed Grade II and has been converted into two flats and tea rooms . The landscape park has been registered at Grade II * in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens . Designation as Grade II * on the Register means that the site is " particularly important , of more than special interest " . 
 = County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York State = 
 County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York State , 470 U.S. 226 ( 1985 ) , was a landmark United States Supreme Court case concerning aboriginal title in the United States . The case , sometimes referred to as Oneida II , was " the first Indian land claim case won on the basis of the Nonintercourse Act . " 
 The Supreme Court held that Indian tribes have a common law cause of action for possessory land claims based upon aboriginal title , that the Nonintercourse Act did not preempt that cause of action , and that the cause of action was not barred by a statute of limitations , abatement , implicit federal ratification , or <unk> . Four dissenting justices would have held for the counties on the defense of laches , a question which the majority did not reach , but expressed doubts about . 
 Furthermore , the Court held that , due to the Eleventh Amendment , federal courts could not exercise ancillary jurisdiction over cross @-@ claims by counties against states . Although only two other justices agreed with the entirety of Justice Powell 's majority opinion , Brennan and Marshall agreed with Parts I @-@ IV and VI ( the Oneida 's claims against the counties ) and Burger , White , and Rehnquist agreed with Part V ( the counties claims against the state ) , thus forging separate majorities . 
 The case is often referred to as Oneida II because it is the second of three times the Oneida Indian Nation reached the Supreme Court in litigating its land rights claims . It followed Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida ( Oneida I ) ( 1974 ) , holding that there was federal subject @-@ matter jurisdiction , and was followed by City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York ( 2005 ) , rejecting the tribe 's attempt in a later lawsuit to re @-@ assert tribal sovereignty over parcels of land re @-@ acquired by the tribe in fee simple . 
 = = Background = = 
 This was the second time the Supreme Court had granted certiorari to the Oneida 's land claim . Over a decade earlier , in Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida ( 1974 ) , the Supreme Court had allowed the same suit to proceed by unanimously holding that there was federal subject @-@ matter jurisdiction to hear the claim . Since then , Justices William O. Douglas and Potter Stewart had departed , replaced by John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O 'Connor . 
 On remand , the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York had found the counties liable to the Oneida for wrongful possession of their lands , awarded damages of $ 16 @,@ 694 , plus interest , representing the fair rental value of the land in question for the 2 @-@ year period specified in the complaint . Finally , the District Court required New York state to indemnify the counties . The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed . 
 The Supreme Court granted certiorari " to determine whether an Indian tribe may have a live cause of action for a violation of its possessory rights that occurred 175 years ago , " ultimately agreeing with the District Court and Second Circuit that the tribe may . On appeal , the counties did not dispute the District Court 's findings that the Oneida held aboriginal title to the lands in question , and that the 1795 conveyances of the lands to the state violated the Nonintercourse Act . The counties instead argued that the Nonintercourse Act preempted the Oneida 's cause of action , that any cause of action was time barred , <unk> , and abated , and that any conveyance was ratified by the federal government . 
 = = Change of counsel = = 
 The case was initiated by George Shattuck of Bond , <unk> & King ( BS & K ) , on a contingency fee basis rather than as a pro bono matter . The retainer agreement between the firm and the tribe , approved ( as required ) by the Department of the Interior , provided that the firm would litigate the tribe 's Nonintercourse Act claim only against the government and would not sue private land owners ; another firm was handling the tribe 's claim before the Indian Claims Commission . 
 Shattuck argued Oneida I alone before the Supreme Court . The Native American Rights Fund ( NARF ) , which had assisted initially assisted the firm , served as co @-@ counsel in the trial after the Oneida I decision and took over completely on the second appeal . The NARF also filed another suit behalf of the Oneidas , pressing the Oneida 's possessory claims against landowners over additional lands . 
 As of March 2011 , BS & K had yet to receive any attorney 's fees from the tribe . On July 11 , 2011 , the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York ruled that BS & K was entitled to $ 5 @,@ 174 @.@ 54 in fees ; the district court reduced the fees to that number after finding that BS & K had breached its duty of loyalty to the Oneida 's by also representing the Canadian claimants . 
 = = Opinion of the Court = = 
 The majority opinion by Justice Lewis F. Powell , Jr. recognized the Oneida 's federal common law cause of action , and rejected all the counties ' affirmative defenses . 
 Cause of action 
 The Second Circuit held that the Oneida 's had both a federal common law cause of action and an implied cause of action under the Nonintercourse Act of 1793 ( the version that governed the 1795 transaction ) . The Supreme Court did not reach the statutory question because it held that " the Indians ' common @-@ law right to sue is firmly established . " The court recognized that " [ n ] <unk> decisions of this Court prior to Oneida I recognized at least implicitly that Indians have a federal common @-@ law right to sue to enforce their aboriginal land rights , " citing a string of examples back to Johnson v. M 'Intosh ( 1823 ) . The court concluded : 
 [ W ] e hold that the Oneidas can maintain this action for violation of their possessory rights based on federal common law . 
 As to the Nonintercourse Act , the Court held that it did not preempt the cause of action because " [ t ] he Nonintercourse Act of 1793 does not speak directly to the question of remedies for unlawful conveyances of Indian land . " The court noted that the Act " did not establish a comprehensive remedial plan for dealing with violations of Indian property rights " and that there was " no indication in the legislative history that Congress intended to pre @-@ empt common @-@ law remedies . " Because the Act contained no remedial provisions , and because subsequent Congressional enactments contemplated possessory land suits by Indians , the Court found that preemption was not indicated . The court reviewed its recent aboriginal title decisions , and reiterated its statement in Oneida I that the Act merely " put in statutory form what was or came to be the accepted rule . " 
 Statute of limitations 
 Where there is no statute of limitations for a federal cause of action , the general rule is to borrow the analogous state statute of limitations unless such would be inconsistent with the underlying federal policies . However , here , the Court held that " borrowing of a state limitations period in these cases would be inconsistent with federal policy . " Reviewing Congressional actions in the context of the Indian Claims Commission , the Court concluded that " It would be a violation of Congress ' will were we to hold that a state statute of limitations period should be borrowed in these circumstances . " 
 <unk> 
 The majority noted that the four dissenting justices would have barred the Oneida 's claim under laches . However , the majority noted that " we do not reach this issue today " because the District Court had ruled against the counties laches defense , and the counties had not raised the issue in the Second Circuit . In a footnote , the majority opined that " application of the equitable defense of laches in an action at law would be novel indeed . " The same footnote cited Ewert v. <unk> , 259 U.S. 129 ( 1922 ) for the proposition that laches " cannot properly have application to give vitality to a void deed and to bar the rights of Indian wards in lands subject to statutory restrictions . " The majority called the application of laches " questionable " and noted that such " would appear to be inconsistent with established federal policy . " 
 In its final footnote , the majority noted that , on " [ t ] he question whether equitable considerations should limit the relief available to the present day Oneida Indians . . . , we express no opinion as to . . . the final disposition of this case should Congress not exercise its authority to resolve these far @-@ reaching Indian claims . " 
 Abatement 
 The counties advanced the theory that the causes of action under Nonintercourse Acts of 1790 , 1793 , 1796 , 1799 , and 1802 ( unlike the final 1833 version ) abated upon the expiration of the statutes . However , the Court held that because the different versions of the Act contained " substantially the same restraint on the alienation of Indian lands . . . , the precedents of this Court compel the conclusion that the Oneidas ' cause of action has not abated . " 
 Ratification 
 The counties advanced the theory that later treaties between the Oneidas and the United States , which ceded different lands to New York , constituted a ratification of the earlier conveyances ( and thus those conveyances were in compliance with the Nonintercourse Act ) . The Court found this interpretation untenable under the canons of construction of federal Indian law , which provide that , inter alia , " treaties should be construed liberally in favor of the Indians . " 
 <unk> 
 The counties final argument was that the Oneida 's land claim was a <unk> political question . The Court found this argument to be non @-@ meritorious in light of similar Indian law precedents . 
 Ancillary jurisdiction 
 The final question before the Court was whether the District Court rightly exercised ancillary jurisdiction over the counties ' cross @-@ claim against the state for indemnification . The Court rejected , as having " no basis in law , " the Second Circuit 's theory that " by violating a federal statute , the State consented to suit in federal court by any party on any claim , state or federal , growing out of the same nucleus of operative facts as the statutory violation . " Although the counties ' cross @-@ claim would meet the traditional criteria for ancillary jurisdiction , the Court found those criteria foreclosed by the Eleventh Amendment . 
 Conclusion 
 The Court concluded by remarking upon the " potential consequences of affirmance , " arguing that " this litigation makes abundantly clear the necessity for congressional action " to extinguish Indian title by statute . In the words of the Court : 
 One would have thought that claims dating back for more than a century and a half would have been barred long ago . As our opinion indicates , however , neither petitioners nor we have found any applicable statute of limitations or other relevant legal basis for holding that the Oneidas ' claims are barred or otherwise have been satisfied . 
 = = = Brennan and Marshall = = = 
 Justices William J. Brennan , Jr. and Thurgood Marshall joined the entirety of the majority 's opinion , except the ancillary jurisdiction portion . In a brief opinion , Brennan reiterated his view from Yeomans v. Kentucky ( 1975 ) that the Eleventh Amendment " bars federal court suits against States only by citizens of other States . " 
 = = = Stevens , Burger , White , and Rehnquist = = = 
 Justice John Paul Stevens , joined by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justices Byron White and William Rehnquist joined the majority 's opinion as to No. 83 @-@ 1240 ( the cross @-@ claims against the state ) but dissented as to No. 83 @-@ 1065 ( the Oneida 's claims against the counties ) . The dissenters would have barred the Oneida 's claim under the equitable doctrine of laches , noting : 
 [ In 1795 , the Oneidas ] made no attempt to assert the claim , and their successors in interest waited 175 years before bringing suit to avoid a 1795 conveyance that the Tribe freely made , for a valuable consideration . The absence of any evidence of deception , concealment , or interference with the Tribe 's right to assert a claim , together with the societal interests that always underlie statutes of repose @-@ particularly when title to real property is at stake @-@ convince me that this claim is barred by the extraordinary passage of time . It is worthy of emphasis that this claim arose when George Washington was the President of the United States . 
 The dissenters noted various historical examples of the Court applying laches to Indian equitable claims , and argued that the doctrine should also be applied to the action of ejectment ( which they admitted was an action at law , not equity ) . Specifically , they cited " [ t ] hree decisions of this Court illustrate the application of the doctrine of laches to actions seeking to set aside conveyances made in violation of federal law . " Moreover , the dissenters quoted Lewis v. Marshall , 30 U.S. 470 ( 1831 ) , for the proposition that : 
 The best interests of society require that causes of action should not be deferred an unreasonable time . This remark is peculiarly applicable to land titles . Nothing so much retards the growth and prosperity of a country as insecurity of titles to real estate . Labor is paralysed where the enjoyment of its fruits is uncertain ; and litigation without limit produces ruinous consequences to individuals . 
 The dissent concluded : 
 The Court , no doubt , believes that it is undoing a grave historical injustice , but in doing so it has caused another , which only Congress may now rectify . 
 The dissent did not address the other defenses raised by the counties .

 Another Oneida claim , challenging the pre @-@ constitutional conveyance of another 6 @-@ million @-@ acre ( 24 @,@ 000 km2 ) tract , was rejected by the Second Circuit in 1988 , on the grounds that the Confederation Congress Proclamation of 1783 had neither the authority nor the intent to limit the acquisition of Indian lands within the borders of the states . 
 City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York ( U.S. 2005 ) 
 After decades , the Oneida became frustrated by the failure of the case to settle . Instead , they began to purchase land within the claim area in fee simple , asserting sovereignty over the re @-@ acquired parcels and refusing to pay property tax . In City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York ( 2005 ) , the Supreme Court held that laches barred the re @-@ assertion of sovereignty over ancestral land re @-@ acquired in fee simple ; the Court did not consider whether the original aboriginal title over the disputed parcels was validly extinguished , and thus did not disturb its holding in Oneida II . 
 On remand , the district court held that , although the counties could tax the Oneida , due to tribal sovereign immunity , they could not foreclose on land held by the tribe in satisfaction of these unpaid taxes . The Second Circuit affirmed , but two of the judges urged the Supreme Court to overrule some of its tribal sovereign immunity precedents . After the Supreme Court granted certiorari , the tribe passed an ordinance consenting to taxation , and the Court vacated and remanded . 
 Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida ( 2d Cir . 2010 ) 
 Oneida I and Oneida II were litigated as test cases by both sides ; the Oneidas suit against the counties for 200 years of damages was stayed pending its resolution . After settlement efforts , that suit resumed in 2000 . In a similar suit by a different tribe , the Second Circuit adopted the view of the four dissenting Oneida II justices in Cayuga Indian Nation of New York v. Pataki ( 2005 ) . The same laches defense defeated the larger Oneida claim . The Oneida and the United States petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari on May 16 , 2011 . The Court denied certiorari on October 17 , with Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor dissenting from the denial . 
 = University of the Philippines Los Baños = 
 The University of the Philippines Los Baños ( also referred to as UPLB , UP Los Baños , or <unk> ) is a public university located in the towns of Los Baños and Bay in the province of Laguna , some 64 kilometers southeast of Manila . It traces its roots to the UP College of Agriculture ( UPCA ) , which was founded in 1909 by the American colonial government to promote agricultural education and research in the Philippines . American botanist Edwin Copeland served as its first dean . UPLB was formally established in 1972 following the union of UPCA with four other Los Baños and Diliman @-@ based University of the Philippines ( UP ) units . 
 The university has played an influential role in Asian agriculture and biotechnology due to its pioneering efforts in plant breeding and bioengineering , particularly in the development of high @-@ yielding and pest @-@ resistant crops . In recognition of its work , it was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for International Understanding in 1977 . Nine research centers are recognized as Centers of Excellence by presidential decree . UPLB hosts a number of local and international research centers , including the International Rice Research Institute ( IRRI ) , ASEAN Center for Biodiversity , World Agroforestry Centre , and the Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture ( SEARCA ) . 
 In late 2015 , as a testament of its leadership in agricultural education and development studies , the university signed a memorandum of agreement with Nagoya University to host the Nagoya University Asian Satellite Campus ( <unk> ) through the UPLB Graduate School . The agreement makes the Philippines the eighth country to host the <unk> through which the Transnational Doctoral Programs for Leading Professionals in Asian Countries will be implemented . It will enable Filipino doctoral candidates to enroll in NU doctoral programs without having to be physically present in Nagoya for the whole duration of the course . Nagoya 's Graduate School of <unk> Sciences and Graduate School of International Development will offer the doctorates in <unk> sciences and international development , respectively , through the said facility . 
 UPLB offers more than 100 degree programs in various disciplines through its nine colleges and two schools . As of Academic Year 2012 @-@ 2013 the Commission on Higher Education ( CHED ) has accredited nine academic units as Centers of Excellence and two as Centers of Development , giving UPLB the largest number of Centers of Excellence ( research and academic units combined ) among all universities in the country . 
 UPLB alumni have been recognized in a wide range of fields . They include 13 scientists awarded the title National Scientist of the Philippines , members of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC , the joint winner of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize ) , Palanca Award winners , as well as political and business leaders . 
 = = History = = 
 UPLB was originally established as the University of the Philippines College of Agriculture ( UPCA ) on 6 March 1909 , by the UP Board of Regents . Edwin Copeland , an American botanist and <unk> from the Philippine Normal College in Manila , served as its first dean . Classes began in June 1909 with five professors , and 12 students initially enrolled in the program . The Forestry School was established a year later . 
 During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines , UPCA was closed and the campus converted into an internment camp for allied nationals and a headquarters of the Japanese army . For three years , the college was home to more than 2 @,@ 000 civilians , mostly Americans , that were captured by the Japanese . In 1945 , as part of the liberation of the Philippines , the US Army sent 130 11th Airborne Division paratroopers to Los Baños to rescue the internees . Only four paratroopers and two Filipino guerrillas were killed in the raid . However , Japanese reinforcements arrived two days later , destroying UPCA facilities and killing some 1 @,@ 500 Filipino civilians in Los Baños soon afterwards . 
 UPCA became the first unit of the University of the Philippines to close after the war when it resumed classes on 25 July 1999 , with Leopoldo <unk> as dean . However , only 125 ( 16 percent ) of the original students enrolled . It was even worse for the School of Forestry , which only had nine students . Likewise , only 38 professors returned to teach . UPCA used its ₱ 470 @,@ 546 ( US $ 10 @,@ 800 ) share in the Philippine @-@ US War Damage Funds ( released in 1947 ) for reconstruction . 
 Further financial endowments from the United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) and the Mutual Security Agency ( MSA ) allowed the construction of new facilities , while scholarship grants , mainly from the Rockefeller Foundation and the International Cooperation Administration , helped fund training of UPCA faculty . From 1947 to 1958 , a total of 146 faculty members had been granted MS and PhD scholarships in US universities . 
 Dioscoro Umali became UPCA dean in 1959 . Umali 's administration oversaw the creation of IRRI , SEARCA ( of which he was the first director ) , and the Department of Food Science and Technology . New facilities were also constructed under his Five @-@ Year Development Program . 
 In 1972 , UPCA requested Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos to allow the college to secede from the University of the Philippines due to the alleged withholding of its budget and the disapproval of curricular proposals . However , UP President Salvador P. Lopez strongly opposed the idea . A survey found that there was very little support for complete independence at UPCA . As a compromise , Lopez proposed the transformation of UP into a system of autonomous constituent universities . Finally , on 20 November 1972 , Presidential Decree No. 58 was signed , establishing UPLB as UP 's first autonomous campus , with UPCA , College of Forestry , Agricultural Credit and Cooperatives Institute , Dairy Training and Research Institute , and the Diliman @-@ based Agrarian Reform Institute as its first academic units . New colleges and research centers were created over the next few years , while the College of Veterinary Medicine was likewise transferred to UPLB from UP Diliman . 
 In 2010 Chancellor Luis Rey Velasco 's administration oversaw the implementation of a policy allowing for larger lecture classes to improve the " absorptive capacity " of the university by more than 500 students and to give them better access to some of the more seasoned professors . It increased the class size of 25 to 40 students to a much larger 120 to 175 for general education and foundation courses . The policy has been criticized by various groups in UPLB . 
 = = Campus = = 
 The UPLB campus consists of 14 @,@ 665 ha ( 36 @,@ 240 acres ) spread across the provinces of Laguna , Negros Occidental , and Quezon . UPLB 's equipment and facilities are worth some ₱ 11 @.@ 3 billion ( US $ 260 million ) according to official estimates . 
 = = = Los Baños campus = = = 
 The 1 @,@ 098 ha ( 2 @,@ 710 @-@ acre ) Los Baños campus houses UPLB 's academic facilities , as well as experimental farms for agriculture and biotechnology research . The more prominent buildings in the Los Baños campus , such as the Dioscoro L. Umali Hall , Main Library , and Student Union were designed by National Artist for Architecture Leandro Locsin . Other notable landmarks include the iconic Oblation , Alumni Plaza , Freedom Park , and Baker Memorial Hall . 
 UPLB is designated as caretaker of the 4 @,@ 347 ha ( 10 @,@ 740 @-@ acre ) Makiling Forest Reserve ( often referred to as the " upper campus , " in contrast to the " lower campus " set at the foot of Makiling ) . It houses facilities of the College of Forestry and Natural Resources , College of Public Affairs , and the University Health Service , among others . The reserve is home to diverse flora and fauna , and has more tree species than the continental United States ( an area 32 times bigger than the Philippines ) . It serves as an outdoor laboratory for students , mainly from the College of Forestry and Natural Resources . 
 = = = Land grants = = = 
 UPLB has three major land grants : the Laguna @-@ Quezon Land Grant , La Carlota Land Grant , and Laguna Land Grant . 
 The 5 @,@ 719 ha ( 14 @,@ 130 @-@ acre ) Laguna @-@ Quezon Land Grant is located in the towns of Real , Quezon , and <unk> , Laguna , and was acquired in February 1930 . It covers some portions of the Sierra Madre mountain range , and currently hosts the university ’ s <unk> and lemongrass plantations . The 705 ha ( 1 @,@ 740 @-@ acre ) La Carlota Land Grant is situated in Negros Occidental , a province in the Western Visayas region . Acquired in May 1964 , it houses the <unk> @-@ DOST La Granja Agricultural Research Center , which serves as a research center for various upland crops . Meanwhile , the 3 @,@ 336 ha ( 8 @,@ 240 @-@ acre ) Laguna Land Grant located in <unk> , Laguna , also acquired in 1964 , is mostly undeveloped . Numerous parties have expressed interest in developing the land grants ; however , UPLB has not entertained the potential investors due to the " lack of a solid development plan . " 
 = = Organization and administration = = 
 As part of the University of the Philippines System , UPLB is governed by the 11 @-@ person UP Board of Regents , which is jointly chaired by the head of the Commission on Higher Education and the UP president . 
 The Board of Regents has the authority to approve the institution , merger , and abolition of degree programs as recommended by the UP president . It also has the power to confer degrees . The UP president , who is appointed by the Board of Regents , is the university 's chief executive officer and the head of the faculty . 
 UPLB is administered by a chancellor who is elected by the UP Board of Regents to a three @-@ year term . The chancellor may only serve for up to two terms . Under him are five vice @-@ chancellors specializing in administration , community affairs , instruction , planning and development , and research and extension . 
 The current chancellor is Fernando C. Sanchez , the ninth to hold the office . He assumed the post on 28 October 2014 . 
 UPLB , through the UP System , is a member of the Association of Pacific Rim Universities , a consortium of leading research universities in the Asia @-@ Pacific region . 
 = = = Funding = = = 
 UPLB 's endowment totaled some ₱ 4 billion ( US $ 90 million ) in 2010 , broken down into cash reserves ( ₱ 1 @.@ 7 billion / US $ 40 million ) , investments ( ₱ 745 million / US $ 17 million ) and national government subsidy ( ₱ 1 @.@ 19 billion / US $ 30 million ) . 
 This amount includes research funding from other sources , which was valued at ₱ 233 million ( US $ 5 @.@ 37 million ) in 2010 . The biggest source was Philippine government agencies , at ₱ 136 million ( US $ 3 @.@ 13 million ) , with the <unk> @-@ DOST as the largest contributor . This represents a 32 percent decrease from the previous year . Meanwhile , contributions from international and local private agencies increased 101 percent and 71 percent respectively . In all , outside sources contributed some ₱ 98 million ( US $ 2 @.@ 26 million ) . 
 To prepare for its centennial year , UPLB launched several Centennial Fund campaigns , the largest being the Centennial Building Fund , which aims to raise ₱ 2 billion ( US $ 46 @.@ 1 million ) for the " construction , repair and maintenance of academic buildings and dormitories " . Other Centennial Funds include the Centennial Celebration Fund and the Centennial Artists Endowment fund . 
 = = = Student government = = = 
 The University Student Council ( USC ) is the " highest governing body of all UPLB students . " Together with college student councils ( <unk> ) , it assembles as the Student Legislative Chamber and acts as the highest policy @-@ making body of the USC . The USC is composed of a chairperson , vice @-@ chairperson , 10 councilors , a representative for each college / school with less than 500 students , and an additional college representative for every 500 students in excess of the first 500 . Members are given one @-@ year terms . <unk> have a similar structure , but with a different number of councilors based on the student population . 
 The Student Disciplinary Tribunal ( SDT ) is responsible for sanctioning erring students . Common offenses include student misconduct and fraternity rumbles . The SDT is composed of a chairperson , two appointees of the chancellor , a student juror , and a parent juror . 
 = = Academics = = 
 UPLB offers 27 undergraduate and 82 graduate degree programs through its nine colleges and two schools . Majority of the programs award science degrees . It also awards high school diplomas through the University of the Philippines Rural High School ( UPRHS ) , a subunit of the College of Arts and Sciences , which acts as a laboratory for its BS Math and Science Teaching students . 
 The College of Arts and Sciences has the largest student population and the largest number of undergraduate degree programs ( 11 ) , while the College of Development Communication and College of Veterinary Medicine have the least number of programs ( one ) . 
 BS Agricultural Biotechnology , introduced in 2010 , is UPLB 's newest undergraduate degree program . Several degree programs that have been proposed include Chancellor <unk> 's BA History , BA Political Science and BS Landscape Horticulture , and National Scientist <unk> M. <unk> Jr . ' s comparative medicine program . 
 = = = Admission and graduation = = = 
 UPLB admits more than 2 @,@ 500 students and produces about 1 @,@ 800 graduates every year . Undergraduate admission is determined by the University of the Philippines College Admission Test ( UPCAT ) . <unk> that select UPLB as their preferred campus and garner a University Predicted Grade ( UPG ) within the standard cut @-@ off are automatically eligible for admission . Those who do not automatically qualify may file an appeal for reconsideration if their UPG is within the actual cut @-@ off , though the appeal process does not guarantee admission . The cut @-@ off scores may be adjusted according to a variety of factors . In 2010 , UPLB had a standard UPG cut @-@ off of 2 @.@ 42 while the actual cut @-@ off was 2 @.@ 8 ( this actual cut @-@ off was retained in 2011 ) . But in 2014 @-@ 2015 UPCAT , according to the Office of the University Registrar , UPLB had a standard cut off score of 2 @.@ 3 . Seventy percent of slots are given to incoming freshmen with the highest scores , while the remaining thirty percent are given to public high school students and members of minority groups . Before the UPCAT was used for admission , UPCA only admitted the top 5 percent of Philippine high school graduates . 
 High school freshman admission , on the other hand , is determined by the eight @-@ hour @-@ long UPRHS Entrance Examination . Only the top 125 examinees are admitted . Sophomore <unk> take the two @-@ day UPRHS Validation Examination , and are admitted depending on the available slots . 
 UPLB has a substantial no @-@ show rate , with 42 percent of qualifiers opting not to enroll . The figures are worse for BS Forestry and Doctor of Veterinary Medicine programs , with no @-@ show rates of 65 percent and 62 percent , respectively . Other programs with poor enrollment numbers include BS Agriculture , BS Agricultural Engineering , and BS Agricultural Chemistry . 
 Normally , a student who completes the program may graduate with honors if his general weighted average ( GWA ) is 1 @.@ 75 or above . The title summa cum laude is awarded to graduates who obtain a GWA of 1 @.@ 20 or above , magna cum laude to graduates with a GWA of 1 @.@ 45 to 1 @.@ 20 , and cum laude to graduates with a GWA of between 1 @.@ 75 and 1 @.@ 45 . As of 2011 there have been 30 summa cum laudes who have graduated from UPLB .

 The base tuition fee per unit in UPLB is ₱ 1 @,@ 000 ( US $ 23 ) . As with all UP constituents , UPLB implements the <unk> Tuition and Financial Assistance Program ( <unk> ) . Under the program , students with annual family incomes between ₱ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ( US $ 23 @,@ 000 ) and ₱ 500 @,@ 000 ( US $ 11 @,@ 500 ) are charged the base tuition fee , while those with annual family incomes above ₱ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 are charged ₱ 1 @,@ 500 ( US $ 35 ) per unit . Students with annual family incomes between ₱ 500 @,@ 000 and ₱ 135 @,@ 000 ( US $ 3 @,@ 110 ) are charged ₱ 600 ( US $ 14 ) per unit ; those who have between ₱ 135 @,@ 000 and ₱ 80 @,@ 000 ( US $ 1 @,@ 840 ) are charged ₱ 300 ( US $ 7 ) ; while those who have below ₱ 80 @,@ 000 are not charged any fees . Additional financial assistance may be accessed through the Student Loan Board , which pays up to 80 percent of the tuition . Scholarship and loan programs are also offered by some UPLB units , such as the College of Veterinary Medicine . 
 The current rates were introduced in 2007 . Previously , base tuition was only ₱ 300 per unit ( since 1989 ) . Library and miscellaneous fees were also increased in 2007 , from ₱ 400 ( US $ 9 ) per student to ₱ 1 @,@ 100 ( US $ 25 ) and ₱ 2 @,@ 000 ( US $ 46 ) , respectively . New fees , such as internet and energy fees , were introduced . The USC sees the over 300 percent increase in tuition as the reason for the low enrollment rate and high student loan levels , which totaled some ₱ 14 million ( US $ 326 @,@ 000 ) in 2007 . Additionally , it criticizes the <unk> for allegedly being ineffective . Upon its introduction in 1989 , only 16 percent of students received discounts . The number fell to 12 percent in 2007 .

 UPLB operates a 155 ha ( 380 @-@ acre ) science and technology park . As of February 2010 , the park has hosted four companies engaged in biotechnology . The park serves as a location for the commercialization and application of UP technologies . 
 One of the earliest innovations of UPLB was the production of CAC 87 sugar cane in 1919 . This high @-@ yielding variety is resistant to <unk> and mosaic viruses , and produces more sucrose than other varieties . Its derivatives significantly increased sugar cane production in the Philippines . Between 1921 and 1939 , cattle , poultry , and swine breeding programs produced new breeds , namely the <unk> ( a hybrid of the Hereford , Nellore and native cattle ) , <unk> ( a variety of the Berkshire and local Jala @-@ Jala pig , resistant to hog cholera ) and the Los Baños Cantonese chicken , which produces more eggs . 
 Research in the 1960s allowed for the efficient mass production of <unk> ( a type of coconut with jelly @-@ like meat ) , while studies started in 1998 that produced delayed @-@ ripening papaya continue to this day . The research is credited for the increase in Philippine papaya production , with the 75 @,@ 896 @-@ metric @-@ ton ( 83 @,@ 661 @-@ short @-@ ton ) production of 2000 rising to 164 @,@ 100 metric tons ( 180 @,@ 900 short tons ) in 2007 . In 1974 , UPLB researchers discovered mango flower induction by potassium nitrate , making it possible for the fruit to be available all year round . It is credited for tripling yield and for " revolutionizing " the country 's mango industry . 
 In 2009 , UPLB researchers funded by the Department of Agriculture developed an abacá variety that is resistant to the abaca <unk> top virus . The virus , first detected in 1915 at Silang , Cavite , has since spread to various provinces in the country , and damaged more than 8 @,@ 000 ha ( 20 @,@ 000 acres ) of abacá plantations in 2002 alone . The university is working further to make it resistant to mosaic and abacá bract mosaic viruses . 
 In July 2010 , UPLB announced that the <unk> <unk> @-@ resistant Bacillus thuringiensis ( Bt ) eggplant variety that it had been developing with Cornell University and <unk> was ready for commercialization . On 17 February 2011 , Filipino and Indian Greenpeace activists trespassed UPLB 's Bay research farm and uprooted two Bt eggplants and more than 100 non @-@ genetically modified eggplants .

Biofuel research in 2007 under the National Biofuel Program has considered new sources of biofuel , such as coconuts , <unk> <unk> , and sunflower seeds . Efforts have been concentrated on the Jatropha curcas due to its low maintenance and fast yield . Other fuel , such as coconut biofuel , were found to be too costly . Biofuel from Sorghum bicolor , <unk> esculenta <unk> and <unk> vulgaris are also being studied .

" Likewise , Section 3 of the code states that " the University of the Philippines System is a public , secular , non @-@ profit institution of higher learning . " Due to this , religious organizations have had some difficulty in getting recognized . Only recognized organizations are allowed to use UPLB facilities .

 = Uzumaki = 
 Uzumaki ( Japanese : うずまき , Spiral ) is a seinen horror manga series written and illustrated by Junji Ito . Appearing as a serial in the weekly manga magazine Big Comic Spirits from 1998 to 1999 , the chapters were compiled into three bound volumes by Shogakukan and published from August 1998 to September 1999 . In March 2000 , Shogakukan released an omnibus edition , followed by a second omnibus version in August 2010 . In North America , Viz Media serialized an English @-@ language translation of the series in its monthly magazine Pulp from February 2001 to August 2002 . Viz Media then published the volumes from October 2001 to October 2002 , with a re @-@ release from October 2007 to February 2008 , and published a hardcover omnibus edition in October 2013 . 
 The series tells the story of the citizens of Kurôzu @-@ cho , a fictional city which is plagued by a supernatural curse involving spirals . The story for Uzumaki originated when Ito attempted to write a story about people living in a very long row house , and he was inspired to use a spiral shape to achieve the desired length . Ito believes the horror of Uzumaki is effective due to its subversion of symbols which are normally positively portrayed in Japanese media , and its Lovecraftian theme of protagonists struggling against a mysterious force stronger than themselves . 
 The manga was adapted into two video games for the WonderSwan and a Japanese live @-@ action film directed by <unk> . The manga has received generally positive reviews from English @-@ language critics . It was nominated for an Eisner Award in 2003 , and placed in the Young Adult Library Services Association 's list of the " Top 10 Graphic Novels for Teens " in 2009 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Uzumaki follows a high @-@ school teenager Kirie Goshima ( <unk> ) , her boyfriend Shuichi Saito ( <unk> ) , and the citizens of the small , fictional Japanese town of Kurôzu @-@ cho ( <unk> , Black Vortex Town ) , which is cursed by supernatural events involving spirals . As the story progresses , Kirie and Shuichi witness how the spiral curse affects the people around them , causing the citizens to become obsessed or paranoid about spirals . Eventually Kirie is affected by the curse as well , when her hair begins to curl into an unnatural spiral pattern , drains her life energy to hypnotize the citizens , and chokes her whenever she attempts to cut it off . Shuichi is able to cut her hair and save her . The curse continues to plague the town , until a storm conjured by the curse destroys most of its structures . The only remaining buildings are ancient abandoned row houses , which the citizens are forced first to move into , and then begin expanding as they grow more and more crowded . 
 Kirie and Shuichi devise a plan to escape Kurôzu @-@ cho , but when they attempt to escape , their efforts are unsuccessful . After returning to the town , they discover that several years have passed since they left . The other citizens have expanded the row houses until they connect into a single structure forming a spiral pattern . Kirie and Shuichi decide to search for Kirie 's parents , which brings them to the center of the spiral . At the center , they fall down a pit , within which they discover the corpses of Kirie 's parents and an ancient city completely covered with spiral patterns . Shuichi urges Kirie to move forward and find a way to stop the curse , but she replies that she does not have the strength and wishes to stay with him . The two embrace each other , and their bodies twist and wrap together as a result of the curse . As they lie together , Kirie notes that the curse ended at the same time it began , and concludes that the curse is eternal , and all the events will repeat when a new Kurôzu @-@ cho is built where the previous one laid . 
 = = Development = = 
 Uzumaki was written and illustrated by Junji Ito . Junji Ito 's initial desire was to create a story about strange changes that would occur to people living in a very long , traditional Japanese row house . This story would have been based on Ito 's personal experience living in such a house as a child . During the process of finding a way to draw such a long building , Ito was inspired by the shape of a mosquito coil and decided he could make the building long by having it spiral . Ito has noted that the spiral is a " mysterious pattern " and described writing Uzumaki as an attempt to learn the secrets of the spiral . Ito sought inspiration by methods such as staring at spirals , researching spirals , creating spiral patterns by draining water from bath tubs , eating foods with spiral patterns , and raising snails . Looking back on the series in 2006 , Ito stated that while he was still uncertain what the spiral stood for , he thought it might be representative of infinity . 
 Uzumaki was influenced by the positive representation of spirals in media , which inspired Ito to subvert them to create horror , stating , " Usually spiral patterns mark character ’ s cheeks in Japanese comedy cartoons , representing an effect of warmth . However , I thought it could be used in horror if I drew it a different way . " The story in which Kirie 's hair is cursed by the spiral reflects a recurring theme in Ito 's work in which a heroine 's hair has a life of its own . Ito uses this imagery because it lends itself well to horror due to its association with the Japanese feminine ideal ( Yamato <unk> ) , as well as the unnerving flowing motions of long hair , which he describes as snakelike . Ito also noted that horror writer H.P. Lovecraft was one of his inspirations when creating Uzumaki , stating that the gradual development of the spiral curse was patterned on Lovecraft 's storytelling and that " [ Lovecraft 's ] expressionism with regard to atmosphere greatly inspires my creative impulse .

The Young Adult Library Services Association chose the first volume for its list of the " Top 10 Great Graphic Novels for Teens " in 2009 . The manga was also included on its list of the 53 " Great Graphic Novels for Teens " . Viz Media 's Deluxe edition ranked # 172 in Diamond 's Top 300 Graphic Novels on October 2013 with a total of 784 copies sold . IGN placed Uzumaki at # 2 under their " Top 10 Horror / Thriller Manga " list . About.com 's Deb Aoki placed Uzumaki in her list of recommended horror manga , describing it as a classic of the genre . Uzumaki appeared in 1001 Comics You Must Read Before You Die ( 2011 ) , and the reviewer wrote that it reminded him of the works of H.P. Lovecraft . <unk> magazine praised the manga , calling it " one of the scariest manga series around . " 
 In Manga : The Complete Guide ( 2007 ) , Jason Thompson gave Uzumaki three and a half stars , and wrote that , taken as a whole , the manga succeeds as " an elegant and sometimes blackly humorous story of dreamlike logic and nihilism . " Thompson featured the manga again in his House of 1000 Manga blog , praising it for its originality , in that it revolved around " a certain nightmarish , fatalistic way of looking at the world " . Comics Alliance author and comic artist , Sara Horrocks , also praised the manga , stating " What makes Uzumaki such a strong work is how precise it is in it ’ s mechanics . It is meticulous in the way that a curse might be . " 
 For the first volume , Theron Martin from Anime News Network gave it a ' B ' , praising the art style and character designs , including Viz Media 's new cover design . He stated , however , that " some of the attempts at horror get too preposterous for their own good . " Greg Hackmann of Mania it an A , and praising both its " well @-@ honed " art and Ito 's ability to form an effective overarching plot out of Uzumaki 's loosely connected <unk> . Barb Lien @-@ Cooper of Sequential Tart gave it a 7 out of 10 , stating " The art is clean and simple . It works to help maintain the paranoia . The tone and pacing of this story are also just right . Altogether , one of the better horror stories I 've read this year . " Ken Haley of PopCultureShock gave it an ' A ' and praised Ito 's effective use of body horror , though he noted that some of the curse 's effects were more humorous than frightening . 
 For the second volume , Lien @-@ Cooper gave it 8 out of 10 stating , " What astounds me about Junji Ito 's work is its deceptive simplicity and its flawless execution . " Sheena McNeil , also from Sequential Tart , instead gave it a 9 out of 10 , citing the novel effects of the curse Ito invented . Hackmann , however , gave it a ' B ' , explaining that " Unfortunately , this shift in story format is largely a failed experiment : with the overarching escape storyline put on hiatus , a good number of these disconnected episodes degenerate into simple , " <unk> , weird stuff happening " <unk> that lack much of the creative spark exhibited throughout the first Uzumaki collection . " 
 When reviewing the third and final volume , Haley again gave it an ' A ' , praising Junji Ito for providing answers to questions previously asked but not answered in a heavy or mundane form . Lien @-@ Cooper gave the conclusion a 6 out of 10 , and criticized the initial ending as nonsensical and the expanded background given in " Galaxies " as uninteresting . 
 = Show Boat = 
 Show Boat is a 1927 musical in two acts , with music by Jerome Kern and book and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II . Based on Edna Ferber 's best @-@ selling novel of the same name , the musical follows the lives of the performers , stagehands and dock workers on the Cotton Blossom , a Mississippi River show boat , over 40 years , from 1887 to 1927 . Its themes include racial prejudice and tragic , enduring love . The musical contributed such classic songs as " Ol ' Man River " , " Make Believe " and " Can 't Help Lovin ' Dat Man " . 
 The premiere of Show Boat on Broadway was a watershed moment in the history of American musicals . Compared to the trivial and unrealistic operettas , light musical comedies and " Follies " -type musical revues that defined Broadway in the 1890s and early 20th century , Show Boat " was a radical departure in musical storytelling , marrying spectacle with seriousness " . According to The Complete Book of Light Opera : 
 Here we come to a completely new genre – the musical play as distinguished from musical comedy . Now ... the play was the thing , and everything else was subservient to that play . Now ... came complete integration of song , humor and production numbers into a single and inextricable artistic entity . 
 The quality of the musical was recognized immediately by the critics , and Show Boat is frequently revived . Awards for Broadway shows did not exist in 1927 when the original production of the show premiered , nor in 1932 , when its first revival was staged . Late 20th @-@ century revivals of Show Boat have won both the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical ( 1995 ) and the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical Revival ( 1991 ) . 
 = = Background = = 
 In doing research for her proposed novel Show Boat , writer Edna Ferber spent several weeks on the James Adams Floating Palace Theatre in Bath , North Carolina , gathering material about a disappearing American entertainment venue , the river showboat . In a few weeks , she gained what she called a " treasure trove of show @-@ boat material , human , touching , true " . Jerome Kern was impressed by the novel and , hoping to adapt it as a musical , asked the critic Alexander Woollcott to introduce him to Ferber in October 1926 . Woollcott introduced them that evening during the intermission of Kern 's latest musical , Criss Cross . 
 Ferber was at first shocked that anyone would want to adapt Show Boat as a musical . After being assured by Kern that he did not want to adapt it as the typical frivolous " girlie " show of the 1920s , she granted him and his collaborator Oscar Hammerstein II the rights to set her novel to music . After composing most of the first @-@ act songs , Kern and Hammerstein auditioned their material for producer Florenz Ziegfeld , thinking that he was the person to create the elaborate production they felt necessary for Ferber 's sprawling work . Ziegfeld was impressed with the show and agreed to produce it , writing the next day , " This is the best musical comedy I have ever been fortunate to get a hold of ; I am thrilled to produce it , this show is the opportunity of my life ... " Show Boat , with its serious and dramatic nature , was considered an unusual choice for Ziegfeld , previously known mainly for revues such as the Ziegfeld Follies . 
 Though Ziegfeld anticipated opening his new theatre on Sixth Avenue with Show Boat , the epic nature of the work required an unusually long gestation period and extensive changes during out @-@ of @-@ town tryouts . Impatient with Kern and Hammerstein and worried about their keeping too serious tone ( he strongly disliked the songs Ol ' Man River and Mis 'ry 's Comin ' Around ) , Ziegfeld decided to open his theatre in February 1927 with Rio Rita , a musical by Kern 's collaborator Guy Bolton . When Rio Rita proved to be a success , Show Boat 's Broadway opening was delayed until Rita could be moved to another theatre . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 Note : Although the basic plot of Show Boat has always remained the same , over the years revisions and alterations were made by the creators , and over time by subsequent producers and directors . Some of these revisions were for length and some for convenience , as when a different actor played a certain role and was unable to perform a specialty piece written for the role 's creator . Some have been made to reflect contemporary sensitivities toward race , gender and other social issues . 
 Act I 
 In 1887 , the show boat Cotton Blossom arrives at the river dock in Natchez , Mississippi . The Reconstruction era had ended a decade earlier , and white @-@ dominated Southern legislatures have imposed racial segregation and Jim Crow rules . The boat 's owner , Cap 'n Andy Hawks , introduces his actors to the crowd on the levee . A fistfight breaks out between Steve Baker , the leading man of the troupe , and Pete , a rough engineer who had been making passes at Steve 's wife , the leading lady Julie La Verne , a mixed @-@ race woman who passes as white . Steve knocks Pete down , and Pete swears revenge , suggesting he knows a dark secret about Julie . Cap 'n Andy pretends to the shocked crowd that the fight was a preview of one of the melodramas to be performed . The troupe exits with the showboat band , and the crowd follows . 
 A handsome riverboat gambler , Gaylord Ravenal , appears on the levee and is taken with eighteen @-@ year @-@ old Magnolia ( " <unk> " ) Hawks , an aspiring performer and the daughter of Cap 'n Andy and his wife <unk> Ann ( Parthy ) . Magnolia is likewise smitten with Ravenal ( " Make Believe " ) . She seeks advice from Joe , a black dock worker aboard the boat , who has returned from buying flour for his wife Queenie , the ship 's cook . He replies that there are " lots like [ Ravenal ] on the river . " As Magnolia goes inside the boat to tell her friend Julie about the handsome stranger , Joe mutters that she ought to ask the river for advice . He and the other dock workers reflect on the wisdom and indifference of " Ol ' Man River " , who doesn 't seem to care what the world 's troubles are , but " <unk> ' keeps <unk> ' along " . 
 Magnolia finds Julie inside and announces that she 's in love . Julie cautions her that this stranger could be just a " no @-@ account river fellow " . Magnolia says that if she found out he was " no @-@ account " , she 'd stop loving him . Julie warns her that it 's not that easy to stop loving someone , explaining that she 'll always love Steve , singing a few lines of " Can 't Help Lovin ' Dat Man " . Queenie overhears – she is surprised that Julie knows that song as she has only heard " colored folks " sing it . Magnolia remarks that Julie sings it all the time , and when Queenie asks if she can sing the entire song , Julie obliges . 
 During the rehearsal for that evening , Julie and Steve learn that the town sheriff is coming to arrest them . Steve takes out a large pocket knife and makes a cut on the back of her hand , sucking the blood and swallowing it . Pete returns with the sheriff , who insists that the show cannot proceed , because Julie is a mulatto woman married to a white man , and local laws prohibit such miscegenation . Julie admits that her mother was black , but Steve tells the sheriff that he also has " black blood " in him , so their marriage is legal in Mississippi . The troupe backs him up , boosted by the ship 's pilot Windy McClain , a longtime friend of the sheriff . The couple have escaped the charge of miscegenation , but they still have to leave the show boat ; identified as black , they can no longer perform for the segregated white audience . Cap 'n Andy fires Pete , but in spite of his sympathy for Julie and Steve , he cannot violate the law for them . 
 Gaylord Ravenal returns and asks for passage on the boat . Andy hires him as the new leading man , and assigns his daughter Magnolia as the new leading lady , over her mother 's objections . As Magnolia and Ravenal begin to rehearse their roles and in the process , kiss for the first time ( infuriating Parthy ) , Joe reprises the last few lines of " Ol ' Man River " . 
 Weeks later , Magnolia and Ravenal have been a hit with the crowds and have fallen in love . As the levee workers hum " Ol ' Man River " in the background , he proposes to Magnolia , and she accepts . The couple joyously sings " You Are Love " . They make plans to marry the next day while Parthy , who disapproves , is out of town . Parthy has discovered that Ravenal once killed a man , and arrives with the Sheriff to interrupt the wedding festivities . The group learns that Ravenal was acquitted of murder . Cap 'n Andy calls Parthy " narrow @-@ minded " and defends Ravenal by announcing that he also once killed a man . Parthy faints , but the ceremony proceeds . 
 Act II 
 Six years have passed , and it is 1893 . Gaylord and Magnolia have moved to Chicago , where they make a precarious living from Gaylord 's gambling . At first they are rich and enjoying the good life , singing the song " Why Do I Love You ? " By 1903 , they have a daughter , Kim , and after years of varying income , they are broke and rent a room in a boarding house . Depressed over his inability to support his family , Gaylord abandons Magnolia and Kim . Frank and Ellie , two former actors from the showboat , learn that Magnolia is living in the rooms they want to rent . The old friends seek a singing job for Magnolia at the Trocadero , the club where they are doing a New Year 's show . Julie is working there . She has fallen into drinking after having been abandoned by Steve . At a rehearsal , she tries out the new song " Bill . " She appears to be thinking of Steve and sings it with great emotion . From her dressing @-@ room , she hears Magnolia singing " Can 't Help Lovin ' Dat Man " for her audition , the song which Julie taught her years ago . Julie secretly quits her job so that Magnolia can fill it , without learning of her sacrifice . 
 On New Year 's Eve , Andy and Parthy go to Chicago for a surprise visit to their daughter Magnolia . He goes to the Trocadero without his wife , and sees Magnolia overcome with emotion and nearly booed off stage . Andy rallies the crowd by starting a sing @-@ along of the standard , " After the Ball " . Magnolia becomes a great musical star . 
 More than 20 years pass , and it is 1927 . An aged Joe on the Cotton Blossom sings a reprise of " Ol ' Man River " . Cap 'n Andy has a chance meeting with Ravenal and arranges his reunion with Magnolia . Andy knows that Magnolia is retiring and returning to the Cotton Blossom with Kim , who has become a Broadway star . Kim gives her admirers a taste of her performing abilities by singing an updated , Charleston version of " Why Do I Love You ? " Ravenal sings a reprise of " You Are Love " to the offstage Magnolia . Although he is uncertain about asking her to take him back , Magnolia , who has never stopped loving him , greets him warmly and does . As the happy couple walks up the boat 's gangplank , Joe and the cast sing the last verse of " Ol ' Man River " . 
 Plot variants in 1951 film 
 The 1951 MGM film changed the final scenes of the story , as well as many small details . It reconciled Ravenal and Magnolia a few years after they separated , rather than 23 . By a chance meeting with Julie , Ravenal learns that Magnolia gave birth to his daughter . He returns to her and sees the child Kim playing . Magnolia sees them together and takes him back , and the family returns to the show boat . Joe and the chorus start singing " Ol ' Man River " as the scenes unfold , then the paddlewheel starts turning in tempo with the music , as the ship heads down river . Julie is shown , viewing from a distance . She had watched the scene from the shadows .

 The musical numbers in the original production were as follows : 
 = = = History of revisions = = = 
 The original production ran four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours during tryouts , but was trimmed to just over three by the time it got to Broadway . During previews , two songs , " Mis 'ry 's Comin ' <unk> " and " Let 's Start the New Year " , were cut from the show . " Mis 'ry 's Comin ' <unk> " was published in the complete vocal score , and fragments of it are also heard in the scoring , notably in the original 1927 overture and in the miscegenation scene . The song " Be Happy , Too " was also cut after the Washington , D.C. , tryout The 1988 studio cast album reinstated the entire song , and it was also included in the 1994 Hal Prince revival . " Let 's Start the New Year " was performed in the 1989 Paper Mill Playhouse production . 
 Two songs , " Till Good Luck Comes My Way " ( sung by Ravenal ) and " Hey Feller ! " ( sung by Queenie ) , were written mainly to cover scenery changes . They were discarded beginning with the 1946 revival , although " Till Good Luck " was included in the 1993 Harold Prince revival of the show . The comedy song , " I Might Fall Back On You , " was also cut beginning in 1946 . It was restored in the 1951 film version and several stage productions since the 1980s . On record , " Hey Feller ! " appears only on the 1988 EMI album . Kern and Hammerstein wrote two new songs for revivals and three more for the 1936 film version . 
 The Harold Fielding production in London in the early 1970s claimed to use the entire original score , but it omitted " Hey , Feller ! " and " In Dahomey " , among others . This cast album broke ground in being the first two @-@ LP version of Show Boat ever released . 
 The score also includes four songs not originally written for Show Boat : " Bill " was originally written by Kern and P. G. Wodehouse in 1917 and was reworked by Hammerstein for Show Boat . Two other songs not by Kern and Hammerstein , " Goodbye , My Lady Love " by Joseph E. Howard and " After the Ball " by Charles K. Harris , were included by the authors for historical atmosphere and are included in revivals . The New Year 's Eve scene features an instrumental version of " There 'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight " . 
 Some of the following numbers have been cut or revised in subsequent productions , as noted below ( the songs " Ol ' Man River " , " Can 't Help Lovin ' Dat Man " , and " Bill " have been included in every stage and film production of Show Boat ) : 
 Overture – The original overture , used in all stage productions up to 1946 ( and heard on the three @-@ disc EMI / Angel CD for the first time in nearly 50 years ) , is based chiefly on the deleted song " Mis 'ry 's Comin ' Round " , as Kern wanted to save this song in some form . The song was restored in the Harold Prince 1994 revival of the show . The overture also contains fragments of " Ol ' Man River " , " Can 't Help Lovin ' Dat Man " , and a faster arrangement of " Why Do I Love You ? " The overtures for the 1946 revival and the 1966 Lincoln Center revival consist of medleys of songs from the show . All three overtures were arranged by the show 's orchestrator , Robert Russell Bennett , who orchestrated most of Kern 's later shows . 
 " Cotton Blossom " – This number is performed in all the stage productions , and shorter versions were used in the 1936 and 1951 film versions . It was not used in the 1929 film version . 
 " Where 's the Mate for Me ? " – Ravenal 's first song ; heard in all stage versions , partially sung in the 1936 film version , and sung complete in the 1951 film version . Not sung in the 1929 film version . 
 " Make Believe " – Performed in all stage versions , and in the 1936 and 1951 film versions , but not the 1929 film version . 
 " Life Upon the Wicked Stage " – This comic song is usually included in stage versions , but is heard in the 1936 film only in the orchestral score . Not included in the 1929 film , it is sung and danced in the 1951 film version . 
 " Till Good Luck Comes My Way " – Kern and Hammerstein cut it from the 1946 revival , but it was reinstated in the 1971 London stage revival . It is performed instrumentally in the 1936 film , and is omitted altogether in the 1929 and 1951 films . 
 " I Might Fall Back on You " – This was usually cut after 1946 , but it has been reinstated in revivals beginning in 1966 . It was absent from the 1929 and 1936 films , but included in the 1951 film . 
 " C 'mon Folks ( Queenie 's Ballyhoo ) " – Always included in the show , it was sung in the prologue to the 1929 film version , It was omitted from the 1936 film and performed instrumentally in the 1951 film . 
 " Olio Dance " – This is rarely performed now , since it was composed simply to cover a change of scenery . It is an orchestral piece that partially uses the melody of " I Might Fall Back on You " , and can be heard on the EMI 3 @-@ CD album ( as " Villain Dance " ) . The 1936 film substituted the new Kern @-@ Hammerstein number " <unk> ' Around " , performed as an <unk> by Irene Dunne ( as Magnolia ) in blackface . It was omitted from the 1989 PBS Paper Mill Playhouse production . Some modern productions move the song " I Might Fall Back on You " to this spot . 
 " You Are Love " – Kern considered this popular waltz to be the score 's weakest song : he tried unsuccessfully to eliminate it from the 1936 film version . It has never been cut from any stage production . It was shortened , and the introductory section was omitted , in both the 1936 and the 1951 films . It was not performed in the 1929 film . 
 " Act I Finale " – This was shortened in the 1936 film and omitted from the 1929 and 1951 films . Its midsection , banjo @-@ dominant , buck @-@ and @-@ wing dance theme became a repeating motif in the 1951 film , played onstage during the backstage miscegenation scene , and later as a soft @-@ shoe dance for Cap 'n Andy and granddaughter Kim . 
 " At the Chicago World 's Fair " – Used in all stage productions except for the Harold Prince 1994 revival , it was omitted from all the film versions , but an instrumental version was performed in the 1936 film . 
 " Why Do I Love You ? " – Used in all stage versions , this number was sung during the exit music to the 1929 film ; it was performed only as background music for the 1936 film , and was sung in the 1951 film version . In the 1994 Hal Prince revival , it was sung by Parthy . 
 " In Dahomey " – This was cut from the score after the 1946 Broadway production and has not been revived since due to its being potentially offensive , as well as unnecessary to the plot . It is sung at the Chicago World 's Fair by a group of supposedly African natives . They chant in a supposed African language before breaking into modern English , singing about how glad they are to return to their apartments after the day 's performance . It was not used in any film version of the show , but was included in the complete 1988 EMI recording and in a 1993 studio recording on the Jay label of the 1946 score . 
 " Goodbye , My Lady Love " – This is used only in American productions . It is included in the 1936 film , but not in the 1929 or 1951 films . 
 " After the Ball " – Performed in all stage productions and in both the 1936 and 1951 films , but not the 1929 one . 
 " Hey , Feller " – Used in nearly all stage productions up until 1946 , and sung in the prologue to the 1929 film . Not used in the 1936 film , but used as background score in the 1951 film during the opening post @-@ credits scene as the show boat arrives . 
 Additional numbers have been included in films and revivals as follows : 
 " Mis 'ry 's Comin ' Round " – Though this was cut from the original production , Kern ensured that it was published in the complete vocal score . The 1988 album reinstated it , and it was also included in the 1994 Hal Prince revival . 
 " Let 's Start the New Year " – Cut from the original production but performed in the 1989 Paper Mill Playhouse production . 
 " I Have The Room Above Her " is a romantic duet written by Kern and Hammerstein for Ravenal and Magnolia in the 1936 film . It was included in the 1994 Broadway revival . 
 " <unk> ' Around " is a cakewalk @-@ style number written by Kern and Hammerstein for Magnolia for the 1936 film . 
 " Ah Still Suits Me " is a comic duet written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1936 film , and sung by the characters Joe and Queenie ( Paul Robeson and Hattie McDaniel ) . The number was also included in the 1989 Paper Mill Playhouse production . 
 " Nobody Else But Me " was written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1946 Broadway revival , to be sung in the spot where Kim usually sings a reprise of " Why Do I Love You " . This was the last song written by Kern ; he died shortly before the 1946 production opened . In the 1971 London stage revival , the song was sung by Julie , in a new scene written especially for that production . It is not sung in any film version of the show , but was frequently heard in stage revivals up until about the 1980s . 
 " Dandies on Parade " is a dance number arranged for the 1994 Broadway production by David Krane , largely from Kern 's music .

 = = = Original 1927 production = = = 
 Show Boat premiered in New York on December 27 , 1927 . Ziegfeld previewed the production in a pre @-@ Broadway tour from November 15 to December 19 , 1927 . The locations included the National Theatre in Washington , D.C. , the Nixon Theatre in Pittsburgh , the Ohio Theatre in Cleveland , and the Erlanger Theatre in Philadelphia . The show opened on Broadway at the Ziegfeld Theatre on December 27 , 1927 . The critics were immediately enthusiastic , and the show was a great popular success , running a year and a half , for a total of 572 performances . 
 The production was staged by Oscar Hammerstein II . Choreography for the show was by Sammy Lee . The original cast included Norma Terris as Magnolia Hawks and her daughter Kim ( as an adult ) , Howard Marsh as Gaylord Ravenal , Helen Morgan as Julie LaVerne , Jules Bledsoe as Joe , Charles Winninger as Cap 'n Andy Hawks , Edna May Oliver as Parthy Ann Hawks , Sammy White as Frank Schultz , Eva Puck as Ellie May Chipley , and Tess Gardella as Queenie . The orchestrator was Robert Russell Bennett , and the conductor was Victor <unk> . The scenic design for the original production was by Joseph Urban , who had worked with Ziegfeld for many years in his Follies and had designed the elaborate new Ziegfeld Theatre itself . Costumes were designed by John <unk> . 
 In his opening night review for the New York Times , Brooks Atkinson called the book 's adaptation " intelligently made " , and the production one of " unimpeachable skill and taste " . He termed Norma Terris " a revelation " ; Charles Winninger " extraordinarily persuasive and convincing " ; and Jules Bledsoe 's singing " remarkably effective " . 
 = = = Paul Robeson = = = 
 The character Joe , the stevedore who sings " Ol ' Man River " , was expanded from the novel and written specifically by Kern and Hammerstein for Paul Robeson , already a noted actor and singer . Although he is the actor most identified with the role and the song , he was unavailable for the original production due to its opening delay . Jules Bledsoe premiered the part . Robeson played Joe in four notable productions of Show Boat : the 1928 premier London production , the 1932 Broadway revival , the 1936 film version and a 1940 stage revival in Los Angeles . 
 Reviewing the 1932 Broadway revival , the critic Brooks Atkinson described Robeson 's performance : " Mr. Robeson has a touch of genius . It is not merely his voice , which is one of the richest organs on the stage . It is his understanding that gives ' Old Man River ' an epic lift . When he sings ... you realize that Jerome Kern 's spiritual has reached its final expression . "

 After closing at the Ziegfeld Theatre in 1929 , the original production toured extensively . The national company is notable for including Irene Dunne as Magnolia . Hattie McDaniel played Queenie in a 1933 West Coast production , joined by tenor Allan Jones as Ravenal . 
 Dunne was soon offered a contract by RKO Studios and appeared in the 1936 Universal Studios film adaptation of Show Boat , as did Jones as Ravenal and McDaniel as Queenie . The film also featured Charles Winninger ( Cap 'n Andy ) , Helen Morgan ( Julie ) , Sammy White ( Frank ) , and Francis X. Mahoney ( <unk> ) recreating their original Broadway stage roles . 
 Show Boat was revived by Ziegfeld on Broadway in 1932 at the Casino Theatre with most of the original cast , but with Paul Robeson as Joe and Dennis King as Ravenal . 
 In 1946 , a major new Broadway revival was produced by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II at the show 's original home , the Ziegfeld Theatre . The 1946 revival featured a revised score and new song by Kern and Hammerstein , and a new overture and orchestrations by Robert Russell Bennett . The show was directed by Hammerstein and <unk> Short and featured Jan Clayton ( Magnolia ) , Charles <unk> ( Ravenal ) , Carol Bruce ( Julie ) , Kenneth Spencer ( Joe ) , Helen Dowdy ( Queenie ) , and Buddy Ebsen ( Frank ) . The successful production ran for 418 performances and then toured extensively . Kern , however , died just weeks before the January 5 , 1946 opening , making it the last show he worked on . 
 Additional New York revivals were produced in 1948 and 1954 at the New York City Center . The Music Theater of Lincoln Center company produced Show Boat in 1966 at the New York State Theater in a new production . It starred Barbara Cook ( Magnolia ) , Constance Towers ( Julie ) , Stephen Douglass ( Ravenal ) , David Wayne ( Cap 'n Andy ) , Margaret Hamilton ( Parthy ) and William Warfield ( Joe ) . It was produced by Richard Rodgers , and Robert Russell Bennett once again provided a new overture and revised orchestrations . 
 1983 brought a production at the Kennedy Center , Washington , D.C. , that starred Mickey Rooney as Cap 'n Andy , and another at the Uris Theatre in New York . The latter revival was presented by Douglas Urbanski and starred Donald O 'Connor as Cap 'n Andy . 
 In 1989 the Paper Mill Playhouse of Millburn , New Jersey , mounted a production which was noted for its intention to restore the show in accordance with the creators ' original intentions . The production restored part of the original 1927 overture and one number discarded from the show after the Broadway opening , as well as the song Ah Still Suits Me , written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1936 film version . It was directed by Robert Johanson and starred Eddie Bracken as Cap 'n Andy . The Paper Mill production was preserved on videotape and broadcast on PBS . 
 <unk> Inc. presented the most recent major production of Show Boat on Broadway in 1994 . Produced and directed by Harold Prince , it premiered in Toronto , Ontario , in 1993 prior to opening in New York on October 2 , 1994 , at the George Gershwin Theatre . It ran for 947 performances , Broadway 's longest @-@ running Show Boat to date . This production went on tour , playing at the Kennedy Center ; and it was also staged in London and Melbourne , Australia . Prince 's production revived interest in the show by tightening the book , dropping and adding songs cut in various productions , and highlighting its racial elements . Perhaps the most notable change in the score was Prince 's transforming " Why Do I Love You ? " from a duet between Magnolia and Ravenal to a lullaby sung by Parthy Ann to Magnolia 's baby girl . The change was partly to accommodate the song 's being performed by stage actress Elaine Stritch . The love duet for Magnolia and Ravenal , " I Have the Room Above Her " , originally written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1936 film , was added to the production . Two new mime and dance " Montages " in Act 2 depicted the passage of time through changing styles of dance and music . 
 = = = London productions = = = 
 The original London West End production opened May 3 , 1928 , at the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane and featured among the cast , Cedric Hardwicke as Capt. Andy , Edith Day as Magnolia , Paul Robeson as Joe , and Alberta Hunter as Queenie . Mabel Mercer , later famed as a cabaret singer , was in the chorus . Other West End presentations include a 1971 production at the Adelphi Theatre , which ran for 909 performances . 
 The Hal Prince production ran at the Prince Edward Theatre in 1998 , and was nominated for the Olivier Award , Outstanding Musical Production ( 1999 ) . Other notable revivals in England have included the joint Opera North / Royal Shakespeare Company production of 1989 , which ran at the London Palladium in 1990 , and the 2006 production directed by Francesca Zambello , presented by Raymond Gubbay at London 's Royal Albert Hall . It was the first fully staged musical production in the history of that venue . 
 A production was transferred from Sheffield 's Crucible Theatre to London 's New London Theatre with previews beginning on April 9 , 2016 , and an official opening on April 25 , 2016 . Show Boat is directed by Daniel Evans using the Goodspeed Musicals version of the show . The cast includes Gina Beck as Magnolia , Lucy Briers as Parthy Ann and Malcolm Sinclair as Cap 'n Andy . Despite very favorable reviews , the show is scheduled to close at the end of August 2016 .

 Show Boat has been adapted for film three times , and for television once . 
 1929 Show Boat . Universal . Released in silent and partial sound versions . Not a film version of the musical ; its plot is based on the original Edna Ferber novel . Immediately after the silent film was completed , a prologue with some music from the show was filmed and added to a part @-@ talkie version of the same film , which was released with two sound sequences . 
 1936 Show Boat . Universal . Directed by James Whale . A mostly faithful film version of the show , featuring four members of the original Broadway cast . Screenplay by Oscar Hammerstein II ; music arrangements by Robert Russell Bennett ; music direction and conducting by Victor <unk> . 
 1946 Till the Clouds Roll By . MGM . In this fictionalized film biography of composer Jerome Kern ( played by Robert Walker ) , Show Boat 's 1927 opening night on Broadway is depicted in a lavishly staged fifteen @-@ minute medley of six of the show 's songs . The number features Kathryn Grayson , Tony Martin , Lena Horne , Virginia O 'Brien , Caleb Peterson , and William Halligan as , respectively , Magnolia , Ravenal , Julie , Ellie , Joe , and Cap 'n Andy . 
 1951 Show Boat . MGM . Somewhat revised Technicolor film version . Follows the basic storyline and contains many songs from the show , but makes many changes in the details of plot and character . The most financially successful and frequently revived of the three film versions . 
 1989 A live performance by the Paper Mill Playhouse was videotaped for television and shown on Great Performances on PBS . It contains more of the songs ( and fewer cuts ) than any of the film versions . It includes the choral number " Let 's Start the New Year " , which was dropped from the show before its Broadway opening , and " Ah Still Suits Me " , a song written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1936 film version of the show . 
 = = = Radio = = = 
 Show Boat was adapted for live radio at least seven times . Due to network censorship rules , many of the radio productions eliminated the miscegenation aspect of the plot . Notable exceptions were the 1940 Cavalcade of America broadcast and the 1952 Lux Radio Theatre broadcast . 
 Campbell Playhouse ( CBS Radio , March 31 , 1939 ) . Directed and introduced by Orson Welles . This was a non @-@ musical version of the story that was based more closely on Edna Ferber 's novel than on the musical . From the original stage cast Helen Morgan repeated her portrayal of Julie , here singing one song not from the musical . Welles portrayed Cap 'n Andy , Margaret <unk> was Magnolia , and author Edna Ferber made her acting debut as Parthy . This version made Julie into an illegal alien who must be deported . 
 Cavalcade of America ( NBC Radio , May 28 , 1940 ) . A half @-@ hour dramatization with Jeanette Nolan , John McIntire , Agnes Moorehead and the Ken Christy Chorus . Although brief , it was remarkably faithful to the original show . 
 Lux Radio Theatre ( CBS , June 1940 ) . Introduced and produced by Cecil B. DeMille , it featured Irene Dunne , Allan Jones , and Charles Winninger , all of whom were in the 1936 film version . In this condensed version some songs from the show were sung , but Julie was played by a non @-@ singing Gloria Holden . This version made the biracial Julie a single woman . Only a few lines of Ol ' Man River were heard , sung by a chorus . While supposedly based on the 1936 film , this production used the ending of the original show , which the film did not use . 
 Radio Hall of Fame ( 1944 ) . This production featured Kathryn Grayson , playing Magnolia for the first time . Also in the cast were Allan Jones as Ravenal , Helen Forrest as Julie , Charles Winninger as Cap 'n Andy , Ernest Whitman as Joe , and <unk> Allman as Parthy . 
 The Railroad Hour ( ABC Radio , 1950 ) . Condensed to a half @-@ hour , this version featured singers Dorothy Kirsten , Gordon MacRae , and Lucille Norman . " Ol ' Man River " was sung by MacRae instead of by an African @-@ American singer . Explanation of Julie and Steve 's departure went completely unmentioned in this version . 
 Lux Radio Theatre ( CBS , February 1952 ) . A radio version of the 1951 MGM film featuring Kathryn Grayson , Ava Gardner , Howard Keel , and William Warfield from the film 's cast . Jay C. <unk> portrayed Cap 'n Andy . This version was extremely faithful to the 1951 film adaptation . 
 In 2011 , a two @-@ part version was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in the Classic Serial spot . Solely based on the novel by Edna Ferber , it was dramatized by Moya O 'Shea , and was produced and directed by Tracey Neale . It starred Samantha Spiro as Magnolia , Ryan McCluskey as Ravenal , <unk> <unk> as Joe , Tracy <unk> as Queenie , Laurel Lefkow as Parthy , Morgan Deare as Cap 'n Andy and Lysette Anthony as Kim . Original music was by Neil Brand . 
 On June 16 , 2012 , a revival of the musical by Lyric Opera of Chicago was broadcast by WFMT @-@ Radio of Chicago . This production of Show Boat reinstated the songs Mis 'ry 's Comin ' Round , Till Good Luck Comes My Way and Hey , Feller ! . It marked the first time a virtually complete version of Show Boat had ever been broadcast on radio .

 = = = Selected recordings = = = 
 1928 – original London cast album , with the show 's original orchestrations . This was released in England on 78 rpm records years before being sold in the United States . Because the U.S. had not yet begun making original cast albums of Broadway shows , the 1927 Broadway cast as a whole was never recorded performing the songs , although Jules Bledsoe , Helen Morgan , and Tess Gardella did record individual numbers from it . The cast on the 1928 London album included Edith Day , <unk> <unk> , Marie Burke and Alberta Hunter . Due to contractual restrictions , cast member Paul Robeson was replaced on the album as Joe by his understudy , baritone Norris Smith . But that same year , Robeson , with the same chorus that accompanied him in the show , did record " Ol ' Man River " in its original orchestration . That recording was later released separately . His rendition appears on the EMI CD " Paul Robeson Sings ' Ol ' Man River ' and Other Favorites " . 
 1932 – studio cast recording on 78rpm by Brunswick Records . Later re @-@ released by Columbia Records on 78rpm , 33 @-@ 1 / <unk> and briefly on CD .

The orchestra was conducted by Victor Young , and the original orchestrations and vocal arrangements were not used . 
 1946 – Broadway revival cast recording . Issued on 78rpm , LP , and CD . The 78 @-@ RPM and LP versions were issued by Columbia , the CD by Sony . This was the first American recording of Show Boat which used the cast , conductor , and orchestrations of a major Broadway revival of the show .

Buddy Ebsen also appeared in the revival , but not on the album . Includes the new song " Nobody Else But Me " . 
 1951 – MGM Records soundtrack album , with cast members of the 1951 film version . The first film soundtrack of Show Boat to be issued on records . Appeared both on 45rpm and 33 @-@ 1 / <unk> , later on CD in a much expanded edition . Actress Ava Gardner , whose singing voice was replaced by Annette Warren 's in the film , is heard singing on this album . The expanded version on CD contains both Warren 's and Gardner 's vocal tracks . This marked the recording debut of William Warfield , who played Joe and sang " Ol ' Man River " in the film . Orchestrations were by Conrad Salinger , Robert Franklyn , and Alexander Courage . 
 1956 – RCA Victor studio cast album conducted by Lehman Engel . This album featured more of the score on one LP than had been previously recorded . It featured a white singer , famed American baritone Robert Merrill , as both Joe and Gaylord Ravenal . Other singers included Patrice <unk> as Magnolia and Rise Stevens as Julie .

 1959 – EMI British studio cast album . It featured <unk> Walters as Magnolia , Don McKay as Ravenal , Shirley Bassey as Julie , Dora Bryan as Ellie , and Inia Te <unk> singing " Ol ' Man River " . 
 1962 – Columbia studio cast album . Starring Barbara Cook , John Raitt , Anita Darian , and William Warfield , this was the first " Show Boat " recording issued on CD .

 1966 – Lincoln Center cast album . Issued by RCA Victor , it featured Cook , Constance Towers , Stephen Douglass , and William Warfield . Robert Russell Bennett 's orchestrations were modified even further . Also available on CD . 
 1971 – London revival cast album . Jazz singer Cleo Laine , soprano Lorna Dallas , tenor Andre <unk> , and bass @-@ baritone Thomas Carey were the leads .

 = = Racial issues = = 
 = = = Integration = = = 
 Show Boat boldly portrayed racial issues and was the first racially integrated musical , in that both black and white performers appeared and sang on stage together . Ziegfeld ’ s Follies featured solo African American performers such as Bert Williams , but would not have included a black woman in the chorus . Show Boat was structured with two choruses – a black chorus and a white chorus . One commentator noted that " Hammerstein uses the African @-@ American chorus as essentially a Greek chorus , providing clear commentary on the proceedings , whereas the white choruses sing of the not @-@ quite @-@ real . " In Show Boat Jerome Kern used the AABA @-@ chorus form exclusively in songs sung by African American characters ( Ole Man River , Can 't Help Lovin ' dat Man ) , a form that later would be regarded as typical of ' white ' popular music . 
 Show Boat was the first Broadway musical to seriously depict an interracial marriage , as in Ferber 's original novel , and to feature a character of mixed race who was " passing " for white . ( Although the musical comedy Whoopee ! ( 1930 ) , starring Eddie Cantor , supposedly depicted a romance between a mixed @-@ blood Native American man and a white woman , the man turns out to be white . ) 
 = = = Language and stereotypes = = = 
 = = = = The word " nigger " = = = = 
 The show has generated controversy for the subject matter of interracial marriage , the historical portrayal of blacks working as laborers and servants in the 19th @-@ century South , and the use of the word niggers in the lyrics ( this is the first word in the opening chorus of the show ) . Originally the show opened with the black chorus onstage singing : 
 Niggers all work on the Mississippi . 
 Niggers all work while the white folks play – 
 <unk> ' up boats wid de bales of cotton , 
 Gittin ' no rest till de Judgement Day . 
 In subsequent productions , " niggers " has been changed to " colored folk " , to " <unk> " , and in one choice , " Here we all " , as in " Here we all work on the Mississippi . Here we all work while the white folks play . " In the 1966 Lincoln Center production of the show , produced two years after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed , this section of the opening chorus was omitted rather than having words changed . The 1971 London revival used " Here we all work on the Mississippi " . The 1988 CD for EMI restored the original 1927 lyric , while the Harold Prince revival chose " colored folk " . 
 The Paper Mill Playhouse production , videotaped and telecast by PBS in 1989 , used the word " nigger " when said by an unsympathetic character , but otherwise used the word " Negro " . 
 Many critics believe that Kern and Hammerstein wrote the opening chorus to give a sympathetic voice to an oppressed people , and that they intended its use in an ironic way , as it had so often been used in a derogatory way . They wanted to alert the audience to the realities of racism : 
 <unk> Boat begins with the singing of that most reprehensible word – nigger – yet this is no coon song ... [ it ] immediately establishes race as one of the central themes of the play . This is a protest song , more ironic than angry perhaps , but a protest nonetheless . In the singers ' hands , the word nigger has a sardonic tone ... in the very opening , Hammerstein has established the gulf between the races , the privilege accorded the white folks and denied the black , and a flavor of the contempt built into the very language that whites used about African Americans . This is a very effective scene .... These are not caricature roles ; they are wise , if uneducated , people capable of seeing and feeling more than some of the white folk around them . 
 The racial situations in the play provoke thoughts of how hard it must have been to be black in the South . In the dialogue , some of the blacks are called " niggers " by the white characters in the story . ( Contrary to what is sometimes thought , black slavery is not depicted in the play ; U.S. slavery was abolished by 1865 , and the story runs from the 1880s to the late 1920s . ) At first , it is shocking to believe they are allowed to use a word that negative at all in a play ... But in the context in which it is used , it is appropriate due to the impact it makes . It reinforces how much of a derogatory term " nigger " was then and still is today . 
 The word has not been used in any of the film versions of the musical . In the show , the Sheriff refers to Steve and Julie as having " nigger blood . " In the 1936 and 1951 film versions , this was changed to " Negro blood " . Likewise , the unsympathetic Pete calls Queenie a " nigger " in the stage version , but refers to her as " colored " in the 1936 film , and does not use either word in the 1951 film . 
 = = = = African @-@ American English = = = = 
 Those who consider Show Boat racially insensitive often note that the dialogue and lyrics of the black characters ( especially the stevedore Joe and his wife Queenie ) and choruses use various forms of African American Vernacular English . An example of this is shown in the following text : 
 Hey ! 
 Where yo ' think you 're goin ' ? 
 Don 't yo ' know dis show is startin ' soon ? 
 Hey ! 
 Jes ' a few seats left yere ! 
 It 's light inside an ' outside <unk> 's no moon 
 What fo ' you gals dressed up <unk> ? 
 Where 's yo ' all gwine ? 
 Tell dose stingy men o ' <unk> 
 To step up here in line ! 
 Whether or not such language is an accurate reflection of the vernacular of blacks in Mississippi at the time , the effect of its usage has offended some critics , who see it as perpetuating racial stereotypes . The character Queenie ( who sings the above verses ) in the original production was played not by an African American but by the Italian @-@ American actress Tess Gardella in blackface ( Gardella was perhaps best known for portraying Aunt Jemima in blackface ) . Attempts by non @-@ black writers to imitate black language stereotypically in songs like " Ol ' Man River " was alleged to be offensive , a claim that was repeated eight years later by critics of Porgy and Bess . But such critics sometimes acknowledged that Hammerstein 's intentions were noble , since " Ol ' Man River " ' was the song in which he first found his lyrical voice , compressing the suffering , resignation , and anger of an entire race into 24 taut lines and doing it so naturally that it 's no wonder folks assume the song 's a Negro spiritual . " 
 The theatre critics and veterans Richard Eyre and Nicholas Wright believe that Show Boat was revolutionary , not only because it was a radical departure from the previous style of plotless revues , but because it was a show written by non @-@ blacks that portrayed blacks sympathetically rather than condescendingly : 
 Instead of a line of chorus girls showing their legs in the opening number singing that they were happy , happy , happy , the curtain rose on black dock @-@ hands lifting bales of cotton , and singing about the hardness of their lives . Here was a musical that showed poverty , suffering , bitterness , racial prejudice , a sexual relationship between black and white , a love story which ended unhappily – and of course show business . In " Ol ' Man River " the black race was given an anthem to honor its misery that had the authority of an authentic spiritual . 
 = = = Revisions and cancellations = = = 
 Since the musical 's 1927 premiere , Show Boat has both been condemned as a prejudiced show based on racial caricatures and championed as a breakthrough work that opened the door for public discourse in the arts about racism in America . Some productions ( including one planned for June 2002 in Connecticut ) have been cancelled because of objections . 
 Such cancellations have been criticized by supporters of the arts . After planned performances by an amateur opera company in Middlesbrough , England were " stopped because [ they ] would be ' distasteful ' to ethnic minorities " , a local newspaper declared that the actions were " surely taking political correctness too far " . A British theatre writer was concerned that " the kind of censorship we 've been talking about – for censorship it is – actually militates against a truly integrated society , for it emphasizes differences . It puts a wall around groups within society , dividing people by creating metaphorical ghettos , and prevents mutual understanding " . Specifically , the cancellation was based on protests of plans to have all the black roles to be played in this production by white actors in blackface , as the company had no black members . 
 As attitudes toward race relations have changed , producers and directors have altered some content to make the musical more " politically correct " : " Show Boat , more than many musicals , was subject to cuts and revisions within a handful of years after its first performance , all of which altered the dramatic balance of the play . " 
 = = = 1993 revival = = = 
 The 1993 Hal Prince revival , originating in Toronto , was deliberately staged to cast attention on racial disparities ; throughout the production , African @-@ American actors constantly cleaned up messes , appeared to move the sets ( even when hydraulics actually moved them ) , and performed other menial tasks . After a New Year 's Eve ball , all the streamers fell on the floor and African Americans immediately began sweeping them away . A montage in the second act showed time passing using the revolving door of the Palmer House in Chicago , with newspaper headlines being shown in quick succession , and snippets of slow motion to highlight a specific moment , accompanied by brief snippets of Ol ' Man River . African @-@ American dancers were seen performing a specific dance , and this would change to a scene showing white dancers performing the same dance . This was meant to illustrate how white performers " appropriated " the music and dancing styles of African Americans . Earlier productions of Show Boat , even the 1927 stage original and the 1936 film version , did not go this far in social commentary . 
 During the production in Toronto , many black community leaders and their supporters expressed opposition to the show , protesting in front of the theatre , " shouting insults and waving placards reading SHOW BOAT <unk> <unk> AND <unk> and SHOW BOAT = <unk> <unk> " . Various theatre critics in New York , however , commented that Prince highlighted racial inequality in his production as to show its injustice , as well as to show the historical suffering of blacks . A critic noted that he included " an absolutely beautiful piece of music cut from the original production and from the movie [ " Mis 'ry 's Comin ' Round " ] ... a haunting gospel melody sung by the black chorus . The addition of this number is so successful because it salutes the dignity and the pure talent of the black workers and allows them to shine for a brief moment on the center stage of the showboat " . 
 = = = Analysis = = = 
 Many commentators , both black and non @-@ black , view the show as an outdated and stereotypical commentary on race relations that portrays blacks in a negative or inferior position . Douglass K. Daniel of Kansas State University has commented that it is a " racially flawed story " , and the African @-@ Canadian writer M. <unk> Philip claims 
 The affront at the heart of Show Boat is still very alive today . It begins with the book and its negative and one @-@ dimensional images of Black people , and continues on through the colossal and deliberate omission of the Black experience , including the pain of a people traumatized by four centuries of attempted genocide and exploitation . Not to mention the appropriation of Black music for the profit of the very people who oppressed Blacks and Africans . All this continues to offend deeply . The ol ' man river of racism continues to run through the history of these productions and is very much part of this ( Toronto ) production . It is part of the overwhelming need of white Americans and white Canadians to convince themselves of our inferiority – that our demands don 't represent a challenge to them , their privilege and their superiority . 
 On the other hand , supporters of the musical believe that the depictions of racism should be regarded not as stereotyping blacks but rather satirizing the common national attitudes that both held those stereotypes and reinforced them through discrimination . In other words , just as quoting an out @-@ of @-@ context line from a play and claiming that it is the view of the playwright is absurd and deceptive , the fact that a dramatic or literary work portrays racist attitudes and institutions does not mean that it endorses them – in the words of The New Yorker theatre critic John Lahr : 
 Describing racism doesn 't make Show Boat racist . The production is meticulous in honoring the influence of black culture not just in the making of the nation 's wealth but , through music , in the making of its modern spirit . " 
 Broadway writers have long used the musical as a medium to call for tolerance and racial harmony , as in Finian 's Rainbow and ( by Hammerstein ) in South Pacific . As described by Joe Bob Briggs : 
 Those who attempt to understand works like Show Boat and Porgy and Bess through the eyes of their creators usually consider that the show " was a statement AGAINST racism . That was the point of Edna Ferber 's novel . That was the point of the show . That 's how Oscar wrote it ... I think this is about as far from racism as you can get . " 
 Perhaps the strongest argument in defense of Show Boat lies in an understanding of the socially concerned intentions , aims , and backgrounds of its authors . According to Rabbi Alan Berg , Kern and Hammerstein 's score to Show Boat is " a tremendous expression of the ethics of tolerance and compassion " . As Harold Prince ( not Kern , to whom the quote has been mistakenly attributed ) states in the original production notes to his 1993 production of the show : 
 Throughout pre @-@ production and rehearsal , I was committed to eliminate any inadvertent stereotype in the original material , dialogue which may seem " Uncle Tom " today ... However , I was determined not to rewrite history . The fact that during the 45 @-@ year period depicted in our musical there were lynchings , imprisonment , and forced labor of the blacks in the United States is irrefutable . Indeed , the United States still cannot hold its head high with regard to racism . 
 Oscar Hammerstein 's commitment to idealizing and encouraging tolerance theatrically started with his libretto to Show Boat . It can be seen in his later works , many of which were set to music by Richard Rodgers . Carmen Jones is an attempt to present a modern version of the classic French opera through the experiences of African Americans during wartime , and South Pacific explores interracial marriage and prejudice . Finally , The King and I deals with different cultures ' preconceived notions regarding each other and the possibility for cultural inclusiveness in societies . 
 Regarding the original author of Show Boat , Ann Shapiro states that 
 Edna Ferber was taunted for being Jewish ; as a young woman eager to launch her career as a journalist , she was told that the Chicago Tribune did not hire women reporters . Despite her experience of antisemitism and sexism , she idealized America , creating in her novels an American myth where strong women and downtrodden men of any race prevail ... [ Show Boat ] create [ s ] visions of racial harmony ... in a fictional world that purported to be America but was more illusion than reality . Characters in Ferber 's novels achieve assimilation and acceptance that was periodically denied Ferber herself throughout her life . 
 Whether or not the show is racist , many contend that productions of it should continue as it serves as a history lesson of American race relations . According to African @-@ American opera singer Phillip Boykin , who played the role of Joe in a 2000 tour , 
 Whenever a show deals with race issues , it gives the audience sweaty palms . I agree with putting it on the stage and making the audience think about it . We see where we came from so we don 't repeat it , though we still have a long way to go . A lot of history would disappear if the show was put away forever . An artist must be true to an era . I 'm happy with it .

 " Love Is a Camera " is a song performed by English recording artist Sophie Ellis @-@ Bextor for her fifth album Wanderlust ( 2014 ) . Ellis @-@ Bextor co @-@ wrote the song with Ed Harcourt , who also produced the track . Its lyrics recount the story of a woman who takes photos of her victims and keeps their souls in the pictures . Musically , the song features piano , guitars , double bass , and influences of tango and baroque . " Love Is a Camera " was serviced to hot adult contemporary radio stations in the United Kingdom as the third single from Wanderlust . The song was released on 23 June 2014 . 
 Upon release , its lyrics and composition attained praise and ambivalence from music critics . To accompany the song 's release , Sophie Muller was enlisted as the director for the music video of " Love Is a Camera " , which was filmed in the Italian city of Florence . Its storyline features Ellis @-@ Bextor impersonating two characters , one being a " temptress " and the other being an unsuspecting woman . The former convinces a man who is attracted to her , and the latter , to take their picture ; the unsuspecting characters are ultimately trapped in their portraits . The track has been performed during Ellis @-@ Bextor 's gigs , for promoting her record Wanderlust . 
 = = Composition and reception = = 
 " Love Is a Camera " was the first song to be developed for Ellis @-@ Bextor 's fifth record , Wanderlust . Ellis @-@ Bextor co @-@ wrote the song with its producer Ed Harcourt . Harcourt produced the track . David Farrell of PopMatters described the track as a " plodding tango " , while The Daily Telegraph writer Neil McCormick deemed it an " elaborate baroque quasi @-@ ballad " . From The Irish Times , Louise Bruton called the song a " hectic slice of vaudevillian fun " . Its instrumentation comprises " florid " guitar chords , " stalking " pianos and a double bass played by Harcourt . Andy Gill of The Independent credited the first two instruments with providing " an Iron Curtain feel " to the track . The final part of the song — characterised by Time Out reviewer Clare Considine as one of Wanderlust 's " more energetic moments " — incorporates a " gypsy polka " sound . During that part , Ellis @-@ Bextor 's voice is paired with an " increasingly frantic piano " . 
 The song 's lyrics were influenced by Russian folklore . Ellis @-@ Bextor denoted her literary choices — as a child and a student — as influences for the song , listing Russian fairytales , folk stories and Emily Dickinson 's works as examples . She took inspiration from the humour and mystery from the serial drama Twin Peaks . " Love Is a Camera " narrates the story of a " spooky old " woman who lives " in a house on the hill " , and takes pictures of individuals , only to preserve their souls in the photographs " behind glass " . Farrell interpreted that the protagonist took their photographs to " preserve their memories " . 
 Farrell exalted the lyricism of the song , stating that " Sophie 's music has never sounded so lyrically rich " and her " storytelling skills " were visible in it . Considine named the song a " welcome break from lullabies ( such as ' The Deer and the Wolf ' ) that risk monotony " on the album . Conversely , AllMusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine described " Love Is a Camera " as a " bogged down in pretension " moment in Wanderlust ; Erlewine went on to criticize the song 's " ceaseless pomp " . Kate Bennett of musicOMH wrote that " Love Is a Camera " was " more of the same " " heroine @-@ gazing @-@ forlornly @-@ into @-@ the @-@ distance . " She elaborated , " You 'd have to have a heart of cold , igneous rock not to enjoy [ this track ] just a little , but if you were never a member of your local youth theatre company the sticky @-@ sweetness of it all quickly becomes cloying . " The song peaked at number 32 on the UK Airplay Chart , while on the UK Indie chart it reached number 33 .

 As announced in a press release , " Love Is a Camera " was released as the third single of Wanderlust on 23 June 2014 . The song was serviced to hot adult contemporary stations in the United Kingdom ; it was included in the A @-@ List of BBC Radio 2 . A promotional Compact Disc single was sent out to radio stations , including a shortened version of the song , dubbed its " radio edit " . 
 Sophie Muller directed the music video for " Love Is a Camera " , which was released on 30 May 2014 . The video commences with Ellis @-@ Bextor , who impersonates an " eerie temptress " dressed in a black " ankle @-@ length , lace @-@ trimmed " gown , walking and dancing slowly inside a classical mansion . Exploring the divisions of her house , she starts adjusting picture frames , which hold monochromatic photographs of individuals . One of those pictures depicts a short @-@ haired woman , dressed in white — also played by Ellis @-@ Bextor — who starts mimicking the song , whilst in the frame . The story of the woman in the frame is told throughout the video — after crossing a field , she finds the mansion . Her photograph is taken by the dressed @-@ in @-@ black Ellis @-@ Bextor , and she is trapped in the frame . Whilst walking down a staircase , the " temptress " passes by a bearded man who stares at her interestingly . Both enter the mansion , where they drink ; the dressed @-@ in @-@ black Ellis @-@ Bextor holds his hand . She convinces him to take his photograph , and after realizing it is a trap , he tries to escape . However , the " temptress " finds him running and takes his photograph ; trapping him in a frame as well . 
 " Love Is a Camera " has been performed throughout Ellis @-@ Bextor 's 2014 tour in promotion of Wanderlust . Whilst singing the track , Ellis @-@ Bextor would reference her participation on Strictly Come Dancing and dance a " half @-@ hearted sway " , as musicOMH 's Helen Clarke described it . Reviewing her concert at the Bush Hall , James Lachno of The Daily Telegraph lauded Ellis @-@ Bextor 's performance of the song . Lachno stated , " [ It was ] one of the oddest , and best , songs of the night . " After attending Ellis @-@ Bextor 's concert at the Oran Mor , an anonymous writer for The Scotsman commented that the song " sounded grand in the live setting " .

 = Ricardio the Heart Guy = 
 " Ricardio the Heart Guy " is the seventh episode of the first season of the American animated television series Adventure Time . The episode was written and storyboarded by Bert Youn and Sean Jimenez , from a story by Merriwether Williams , Tim McKeon , and Adam Muto . It originally aired on Cartoon Network on April 26 , 2010 . The episode guest stars George Takei as the title character , Ricardio . 
 The series follows the adventures of Finn ( voiced by Jeremy Shada ) , a human boy , and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake ( voiced by John DiMaggio ) , a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will . In this episode , Finn believes that Princess Bubblegum 's ( voiced by Hynden Walch ) new friend , a heart named Ricardio , is evil , and is proven right after learning that Ricardio is the heart of the Ice King ( voiced by Tom Kenny ) . Ricardio reveals that he wants to " make out " with Bubblegum 's heart , but he is defeated by Finn and Jake . 
 Ricardio would become a minor recurring villain , reappearing in the fourth season entry " Lady & Peebles " . After the episode aired , series composer Casey James Basichis posted a video explaining his inspiration and the method in which he produced the music featured in the episode . Basichis largely scored the episode with opera music , because he felt the genre suited Ricardio . " Ricardio the Heart Guy " was watched by 1 @.@ 91 million people and received largely positive critical attention , with many reviews praising Takei 's voice work . 
 = = Plot = = 
 After the Ice King captures Princess Bubblegum , Finn and Jake manage to save her . Bubblegum is so happy that she decides to throw a party for Finn as a thank you . Finn makes a Paper Crane for Bubblegum as a gift , but Jake says that Finn has a crush on her , which Finn denies . When they arrive at the party , however , no one notices them ; everyone , including Bubblegum , is too preoccupied with a heart @-@ shaped man named Ricardio . He and Bubblegum begin discussing scientific topics on the dance floor , which leaves Finn feeling jealous . 
 Finn begins to think that Ricardio is a villain , but Jake just notes that Finn is jealous . However , the two spy on Ricardio to see if he is evil or not . They see Ricardio going into a dumpster and acquiring a rope and broken bottles . Then they see him throwing the Ice King into the dumpster , so they decide to question Ricardio about being a super @-@ villain . Finn punches Ricardio right when Bubblegum comes . Mad and upset , she takes Ricardio away . However , the Ice King soon crawls toward Finn and Jake , looking sickly . He reveals that Ricardio is actually his own heart , which gained sentience after the Ice King performed a failed love spell . Ricardio desires to cut out Bubblegum 's heart and make it his bride . 
 Finn and Jake race to Bubblegum 's castle and find her tied to a chair , with Ricardio about to rip her heart out . Finn and Jake then fight Ricardio and manage to beat him up . The Ice King crawls into the castle and places Ricardio back into his chest . Later during dinner , Bubblegum tells Finn that he does not need to be jealous anymore , but Finn denies that he was jealous in the first place .

 " Ricardio the Heart Guy " was written and storyboarded by Bert Youn and Sean Jimenez , from a story by Merriwether Williams , Tim McKeon , and Adam Muto . Directed by Larry Leichliter , the episode introduces the recurring villain Ricardio , played by George Takei , a character that Tom Kenny later called " the valentine from Hell " . Takei later reprised the role in the season four episode " Lady and Peebles " . Initial drafts of the character featured him looking more like an anthropomorphic heart , complete with arteries and ventricles . Ricardio is one of the few individuals in the Adventure Time universe to have a highly detailed face ; during the commentary for the episode , his design was compared to that of the face on the moon in the 1902 French silent film Le Voyage dans la Lune , based on H.G. Wells 's 1901 novel The First Men in the Moon . 
 After the episode aired , series composer Casey Basichis posted a video explaining his inspiration and method of producing the music featured in the episode . According to the video , Basichis created a " skeleton " of the score in his shower using his voice and a ukulele ; the audio was captured on a phone . Originally , the score was going to have a " New York City , taxi , and jazz " feel , but Basichis was unhappy with the genre choice , and changed the feel . For the music that played while the Ice King interacted with Ricardio , Basichis was inspired by the score from the original seven @-@ minute short . In addition , opera singer Karen Vuong lent her voice to the episode . According to Basichis , Vuong was able to record her vocals successfully in one take . Basichis chose opera because he knew it had a reputation for being " sickeningly intellectual " and " preoccupied with murder " , traits that he felt suited Ricardio .

 " Ricardio the Heart Guy " first aired on Cartoon Network on April 26 , 2010 . The episode was watched by 1 @.@ 91 million viewers , and scored a 1 @.@ 3 / 2 percent Nielsen household rating , meaning that it was seen by 1 @.@ 3 percent of all households and 2 percent of all households watching television at the time of the episode 's airing . The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2011 Adventure Time : My Two Favorite People DVD , which included 12 episodes from the series ' first two seasons . It was later re @-@ released as part of the complete first season DVD in July 2012 ; commentary for the episode was also included on the DVD . 
 The episode garnered mostly positive reviews from critics . Matt Fowler of IGN , in a review of the My Two Favorite People DVD , noted that while " the idea of a walking , talking heart named Ricardio [ … ] who plans to cut out Princess Bubblegum 's heart is potent nightmare fuel " , the show nevertheless " finds a way to make that grim idea accessible and fun . " 
 Takei 's appearance as Ricardio gained critical favor . Charlie Anders of io9 named Takei 's appearance in the episode as one of his " greatest moments " , noting , " how could we have missed that Takei did the voice for this sleazy science @-@ talking heart on Adventure Time , our new favorite show ? " Tyler Foster of DVD Talk called Ricardio one of the highlights of the season . The A.V. Club reviewer Oliver Sava , in a review for " Lady & Peebles " , wrote that Ricardio is " always welcome on this series , largely due to Takei ’ s delightful voice work . " Furthermore , he praised the way that Takei delivered his lines , noting that " there ’ s a theatrical smarminess to his vocals that is a stark contrast to the Ice King ’ s nasality " , and that " Takei always sounds like he ’ s having a great time reading the ridiculous lines that are written for him . " 
 = Restoration spectacular = 
 The Restoration spectacular , or elaborately staged machine play , hit the London public stage in the late 17th @-@ century Restoration period , enthralling audiences with action , music , dance , moveable scenery , baroque illusionistic painting , gorgeous costumes , and special effects such as trapdoor tricks , " flying " actors , and fireworks . These shows have always had a bad reputation as a vulgar and commercial threat to the witty , " legitimate " Restoration drama ; however , they drew Londoners in unprecedented numbers and left them dazzled and delighted . 
 Basically home @-@ grown and with roots in the early 17th @-@ century court masque , though never ashamed of borrowing ideas and stage technology from French opera , the spectaculars are sometimes called " English opera " . However , the variety of them is so untidy that most theatre historians despair of defining them as a genre at all . Only a handful of works of this period are usually accorded the term " opera " , as the musical dimension of most of them is subordinate to the visual . It was spectacle and scenery that drew in the crowds , as shown by many comments in the diary of the theatre @-@ lover Samuel Pepys . The expense of mounting ever more elaborate scenic productions drove the two competing theatre companies into a dangerous spiral of huge expenditure and correspondingly huge losses or profits . A fiasco such as John Dryden 's Albion and Albanius would leave a company in serious debt , while blockbusters like Thomas Shadwell 's Psyche or Dryden 's King Arthur would put it comfortably in the black for a long time . 
 = = Introductory : " A lion , a crocodile , a dragon " = = 
 The distinction between " legitimate " Restoration drama and the Restoration spectacular , or " musical spectacular , " or " Dorset Garden spectacular , " or " machine play " is one of degree rather than kind . All plays of the period featured music and dancing and some scenery , most of them also songs . Restoration heroic drama , for all its literariness , relied on opulent scenery . However , the true spectacular , of which Milhous counts only eight over the entire 1660 – 1700 Restoration period , was produced on a whole different scale . The spectacular is defined by the large number of sets and performers required , the vast sums of money invested , the potential for great profits , and the long preparation time needed . Milhous calculates a likely requirement of at least four to six months of planning , contracting , building , and rehearsing , to be compared with the four to six weeks of rehearsal time a new " legitimate " play would get . 
 Previous generations of theatre historians have despised the operatic spectaculars , perhaps influenced by John Dryden 's sour comments about expensive and tasteless " scenes , machines , and empty operas " . However , audiences loved the scenes and machines and operas , as Samuel Pepys ' diary shows . Dryden wrote several baroque machine plays himself . The first , The State of Innocence ( 1677 ) , was never staged , as his designated company , the King 's , had neither the capital nor the machinery for it : a dramatisation of John Milton 's Paradise Lost , it called for " rebellious angels wheeling in the air , and seeming transfixed with thunderbolts " over " a lake of brimstone or rolling fire " . The King 's Company 's Theatre Royal , Drury Lane was not up to lakes of rolling fire ; only the " machine house " at Dorset Garden was , and that belonged to the competition , the Duke 's Company . When the two companies had merged in the 1680s and Dryden had access to Dorset Garden , he wrote one of the most visual and special @-@ effects @-@ ridden machine plays of the entire Restoration period , Albion and Albanius ( 1684 – 85 ) : 
 The Cave of <unk> rises out of the Sea ; it consists of several arches of Rock @-@ work adorned with mother @-@ of @-@ pearl , coral , and abundance of shells of various kinds . Through the arches is seen the Sea , and parts of Dover @-@ pier ; in the middle of the Cave is <unk> asleep on a rock adorned with shells , & c. like the Cave . <unk> and <unk> seize on him ; and while a symphony is playing , he sinks as they are bringing him forward , and changes himself into a Lion , a Crocodile , a Dragon , and then to his own shape again ; he comes forward to the front of the stage , and sings . " 
 How were such effects produced , and how did they look ? The crocodile etc. obviously used the floor trap , but was it an <unk> painted figure worked with sticks , or a man in a crocodile suit ? There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre , although some documentation exists for court masques from the first half of the 17th century , notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb . One reason for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects , and particularly machines , were trade secrets . Inventors of theatrical effects took great pains to hold on to their secrets , and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks . 
 What the technology and the visual experiences were can only be tenuously inferred from stage directions . Milhous concludes from a review of Dorset Garden performances that " at a conservative estimate " the theatre was equipped to fly at least four people independently , and had some very complex floor traps for " transformations " such as that of Proteus . The plates printed in the first edition of Elkanah Settle 's Empress of Morocco ( 1673 ) ( see detail , top right ) are the only pictures of actual Restoration stage sets . Pepys ' mentions of stage effects in his diary , 1660 – 68 , give the modern reader some help in visualising what audiences saw in the 1660s , and even more in entering into their enthusiasms , but the 1660s were still early days . There are scarcely any descriptions or reactions preserved from the heyday of the machine play in the 1670s – 90s , although a general idea of its technology can be gathered from the better @-@ documented French and Italian opera scenery which inspired Thomas Betterton at Dorset Garden Theatre . 
 = = 1625 – 1660 : Court masques and stealth performances = = 
 In the early 17th century , moveable " scenes " — painted wings and backdrops — and technical " machines " or " devices " for flying and other special effects were used in the masques produced for and by the court of Charles I. In William Davenant 's <unk> <unk> ( 1640 ) , for instance , the last of the court masques before the Civil War , Queen Henrietta Maria ( pregnant at the time ) makes her entrance " descending by a theatrical device from a cloud . " As early as 1639 , Davenant had obtained a royal patent authorising construction of a large new public theatre with technology that would allow such effects and accommodate music , scenery , and dancing . Such an invasion of court @-@ drama technique in the public theatre met opposition from " legitimate " dramatists , and before the opposition could be overcome , the war had closed down the theatres in 1642 . 
 The public stage ban 1642 – 60 imposed by the Puritan regime represents a long and sharp break in dramatic tradition , but was still never completely successful in suppressing the ideologically hateful make @-@ believe of play @-@ acting . Performances in grand private houses were not unusual , and could have quite elaborate sets , as can be seen from the extant drawings for the original performance of Davenant 's opera The Siege of Rhodes ( 1656 ) at his home Rutland House . This was public theatre in all but name , as Davenant charged 5 shillings for admission . Some professional actors also managed to scrape a living and evade the authorities in stealth acting companies in London , such as that of Michael Mohun at the Red Bull Theatre . Professional writers from the previous era were growing middle @-@ aged , biding their time , and hoping for the monarchy to be restored . By the later 1650s , it was becoming obvious that that time was at hand , and William Davenant , for example , stepped up his theatrical activities .

 = = = William Davenant , impresario = = = 
 When the public performance ban was lifted at the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 , Charles II immediately encouraged the drama and took a personal interest in the scramble for acting licences and performance rights which followed . Two middle @-@ aged pre @-@ Commonwealth playwrights notable for their loyalty during Charles ' exile emerged from the struggle with royal Letters Patent for new , or refurbished , patent theatre companies : Thomas Killigrew and William Davenant . Killigrew was able to take over Michael Mohun 's skilled veteran troupe for his " King 's Company " and to start with " what was essentially a going concern " ( Hume ) , with the added advantage of the traditional performance rights Mohun brought with him for practically the whole classic repertory of William Shakespeare , Ben Jonson , and the Beaumont and Fletcher team . The competition , Davenant 's " Duke 's Company " , seemed doomed to a secondary position with its young , scratched @-@ together troupe and scarcely any performance rights . They were only allowed to put on abridged and modernized versions of Shakespeare plays , and a few that Davenant had written . However , Davenant , " a brilliant impresario " ( Hume ) , was soon able to turn the tables on Killigrew by realising his old pre @-@ Civil War dream of music , dance , and spectacular visual effects on the public stage . 
 During the autumn of 1660 , while the Duke 's Company was still getting financed ( mostly by means of the actors buying company shares ) and having temporary quarters set up , the King 's Company offered a string of well @-@ received productions . Their new albeit traditional theatre in Vere Street was already fully operational . The devoted playgoer Samuel Pepys called it " the finest playhouse ... that ever was in England " in his diary , a sentiment he would need to revise many times over the coming decade , and recorded his awe at seeing Michael Mohun , " who is said to be the best actor in the world " , act on its stage . Davenant was far behind , but daringly put all his capital into the outfitting of a new superior playhouse in Lincoln 's Inn Fields ( simultaneously , with great foresight , prying loose the rising young star Thomas Betterton from the King 's Company ) , and perfectly hit public taste .
