 Since antiquity Egypt has straddled the trade route between the Mediterranean and Arabia , India and countries to the east . With the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 it gained huge strategic importance . In 1882 the British took effective control of Egypt in the Anglo @-@ Egyptian War . 
 Northern and central Sudan had been nominally under Egyptian suzerainty since an Ottoman force had conquered and occupied the region in 1821 . The primary motive was not territorial conquest but to secure a source of slaves to serve in the Egyptian army . The slaves , paid in lieu of taxes , were brought from the formerly inaccessible regions of south Sudan . When the British explorer Samuel Baker visited Khartoum in 1862 , he found that everyone in the town was involved in the slave trade , including the Governor @-@ General . The Egyptian and Nubian garrison lived on the land like an army of occupation . Bribery was the only way to get anything done . Torture and floggings were routine in the prisons . Baker said of Khartoum " a more miserable and unhealthy place can hardly be imagined " . He described the Governor General Musa Pasha as combining " the worst of Oriental failings with the brutality of a wild animal " . 
 In the 1870s , a Muslim cleric named Muhammad Ahmad began to preach renewal of the faith and liberation of Sudan from the Egyptians . In 1881 he proclaimed himself the Mahdi , the promised redeemer of the Islamic world . The Mahdi 's followers were named " Ansar " , or helpers , the name that was given to the citizens of Medina who helped the Prophet Muhammed . The religious and political revolt gathered momentum , with the Egyptians steadily losing ground and the British showing little enthusiasm for a costly engagement in this remote region . By the end of 1883 the Ansar army had wiped out three Egyptian armies . A force under General William Hicks was sent to suppress the revolt but was destroyed . When the governor of Darfur , Slatin Pasha , surrendered to the Mahdi almost all of the west of Sudan had come under his control . 
 Major @-@ General Charles George Gordon was given the job of evacuating the Egyptian garrison from Khartoum . He arrived on 18 February 1884 . Gordon was reluctant to abandon the population of Khartoum to the forces of the Mahdi , and also felt that by evacuating the city he would open the way for the Mahdi to threaten Egypt . He bombarded the authorities in Cairo with telegrams suggesting alternative courses , and delayed starting the evacuation . On 13 March 1884 the tribes north of Khartoum declared for the Mahdi , cutting the telegraph and blocking river traffic . Khartoum was besieged , falling on 25 January 1885 after a siege of 313 days . A relief column arrived two days after the city had fallen and Gordon had been killed . Despite a short @-@ lived public outcry in Britain over Gordon 's death , Britain took no further action in Sudan for several years .

 Muhammad Ahmad died of typhus a few months after his victory , leaving power to his three deputies , or <unk> . Abd al @-@ Rahman was born on 15 July 1885 in Omdurman , three weeks after his father 's death . His mother was granddaughter of a former Sultan of Darfur , Mohammed al @-@ Fadl . As a child , Abd al @-@ Rahman 's only formal education was that of a religious school where the pupils memorized the Quran . By the age of eleven he had recited the Quran . 
 After a prolonged struggle , by 1891 the Kalifa <unk> ibn Muhammad emerged as sole leader due to his support from the warlike nomadic Baggara Arabs of the west . He proved to be an able and ruthless ruler of the <unk> , the Mahdist state . At first the state was run on military lines as a <unk> state . Later , a more conventional form of administration was introduced . The Kalifa consolidated his rule in Sudan , then invaded Ethiopia , killing Emperor <unk> IV in March 1889 and penetrating as far as Gondar . The same year , the Kalifa attacked Egypt at <unk> , but was defeated . 
 However , the state suffered from economic problems and internal opposition to the Khalifa , particularly from the Mahdi 's family , and the Khalifa was forced to concentrate on consolidation . The British detected his weakness , and prepared an invasion motivated in part by a wish to revenge Gordon 's death , in part by a desire for raw cotton for their textile industry . A methodical invasion was launched in 1896 @.@ slowly moving south supported by a railway that the army built along its route . The force reached Berber in September 1897 and <unk> in April 1898 . The British and Egyptian force led by General Kitchener defeated the Kalifa at the Battle of Omdurman on 2 September 1898 . The battle is known as the Battle of <unk> to Mahdists . 
 In his book The River War , Sir Winston Churchill , who was present at the Battle , summed up the result : " The River War is over . In its varied course , which extended over fourteen years and involved the untimely destruction of perhaps 300 @,@ 000 lives , many extremes and contrasts have been displayed , There have been battles which were massacres , and others that were mere parades . There have been occasions of shocking cowardice and surprising heroism ... of wisdom and incompetence . But the result is at length achieved and the flags of England and Egypt wave unchallenged over the valley of the Nile " . 
 The British sent the Mahdi 's family to al @-@ <unk> on the Blue Nile in September 1898 . The group included the Khalifa Muhammad Sharif , the Mahdi 's cousin and one of his chosen successors . In 1899 the government heard rumors that the family group was advocating a Mahdist revival and dispatched a military force to al @-@ <unk> . One account says the force attacked the family and followers , firing on them at random . Abd al @-@ Rahman was badly wounded and his two elder brothers were killed . Another account says Muhammad Sharif and the two elder sons of the Mahdi were arrested . There was a skirmish when an attempt was made to rescue them . Muhammad Sharif and the Mahdi 's two sons were found guilty by a court martial trial and were shot . 
 Organized resistance to the British had ended by 1899 , although sporadic fighting continued for a few more years . In theory the British ruled the Anglo @-@ Egyptian Sudan in partnership with Egypt through an arrangement called the " condominium " . In practice , although Egypt bore most of the costs of the military conquest and occupation of Sudan , the British ran the country as they chose . The head of the military and the civil administration under the 19 January 1899 Condominium Agreement was a British @-@ nominated Governor General , who acted independently of the Cairo government . 
 = = Early period of British rule = = 
 After the British took control , Abd al @-@ Rahman lived at first with a relative in the Gezira . On the advice of the Inspector General Slatin Pasha , Abd al @-@ Rahman was constantly watched in the early years of British rule , was given a very small allowance and was not allowed to call himself Imam or the Mahdi . Both Slatin and the Governor @-@ General Reginald Wingate were determined to stamp out Mahdism . Slatin had been held a prisoner of the Mahdists for eleven years . He placed many restrictions on the Mahdist leaders such as prohibiting them from reading the Mahdi 's prayer book , from visiting " sacred " places associated with their movement other than the Mahdi 's tomb , and from praying or making offerings at the tomb . 
 From 1906 Abd al @-@ Rahman lived in <unk> al @-@ Fil , near to Omdurman . He was subject to constant and obtrusive supervision by the intelligence department . After 1908 Abd al @-@ Rahman was allowed to live in Omdurman and study under a distinguished <unk> named Muhammad al @-@ Badawi , where he gained some understanding of Islamic jurisprudence and the fundamentals of his religion , including the Hadith , or Prophet 's tradition . However , he was never to become a well @-@ educated and knowledgeable Islamic scholar as his father had been . The government lent him money to build the family mosque in Omdurman in 1908 , and let him farm part of his father 's land on Aba Island . He emphasized his peaceful intentions , convincing the colonialist government that his movement was not dangerous . A British official described him in 1909 , when he was aged about twenty @-@ four , as " an obsequious , sorry @-@ looking youth in soiled clothes " . In 1910 he made a public speech in which he supported the Condominium administration of the Anglo @-@ Egyptian Sudan . 
 Abd al @-@ Rahman quietly began to regroup the Ansar as a religious sect . Until 1914 , he lived in seclusion in Omdurman or on Aba Island , closely watched by Slatin 's intelligence agents . Despite the surveillance he built considerable influence in the White Nile region . He often visited the many mosques in Omdurman to meet his followers with his face covered so he would not be recognized by government agents . He received many visitors who sought his blessing . 
 = = World War I = = 
 When World War I broke out in 1914 , Turkey sided with Germany against Britain . Governor @-@ General Wingate had to persuade the Sudanese people that Turkey was no longer a truly Muslim state . Wingate was helped by Sudanese memories of the harsh former Turkish rule . Wingate described Britain as the true defender of Islam , and called the Turkish rulers a " Syndicate of Jews , financiers and low @-@ born intriguers " . The British and most of the northern Sudanese saw the Sayyids , the leaders of the main Islamic groups , as the natural spokesmen for the people . Wingate decided to enlist Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman to support the British cause . Abd al @-@ Rahman publicly declared his full support for the British and assisted in suppressing a rebellion in the Nuba Mountains in 1915 . 
 In 1915 Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman made a series of tours and visits to parts of the country where Mahdism was still strong , particularly among the Baggara of the White Nile region , speaking in opposition to the Turkish sultan 's calls for Jihad . When he toured Aba Island in 1915 , he was greeted by thousands of sword @-@ carrying Mahdists who prayed that " the day had arrived " . Alarmed at the possibility of a Mahdist revival , the British ordered him to return to Omdurman in 1916 . However , Abd al @-@ Rahman appointed agents in Blue Nile and Funj provinces and later in Kordofan and Darfur . Their ostensible role was to report on any illegal activity and to encourage payment of taxes to the British . They took advantage of their visits to collect payments of zakat to Abd al @-@ Rahman and to encourage the Ansar , who now freely used the illegal Mahdist prayer book , <unk> al @-@ <unk> . 
 The British encouraged the development of a version of the Ansar movement that was not fanatical , and did much to accommodate Abd al @-@ Rahman 's ambitions , although they could not go as far as supporting his goal of becoming King of Sudan . However , the toleration and even support of Mahdism during World War I was not based on official policy . A British official who was critical of the support given to Abd al @-@ Rahman at this time later wrote that some changes were " a modification of policy deliberately proposed ; others ... the unforeseen consequence of action taken ; others , perhaps the majority , appear superficially to represent a gradual drift , of which the Government was at the time unconscious " . 
 = = Post World War I = = 
 In 1919 Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman al @-@ Mahdi was among a delegation of Sudanese notables who went to London to congratulate King George V of England on the British victory in the war . In a dramatic gesture of loyalty , Abd al @-@ Rahman presented the Mahdi 's sword to the King . The delegation was led by Sayyid Ali al @-@ Mirghani , the leader of the Khatmiyya movement , who was later to clash with Abd al @-@ Rahman over several issues . 
 After the war , the Turkish empire was broken up , leading to a revival of Egyptian nationalism . Some Egyptians claimed that Sudan was a natural extension of Egypt . The Sudanese view was mixed , with some wanting ties with Egypt to offset British influence and others wanting complete independence of Egypt . 
 In the post @-@ war period the Mahdi 's family became wealthy from cotton production based on irrigation and migrant laborers , mainly their Baggara followers from Darfur and Kordofan . These western tribes had been the backbone of the original Mahdist movement . The riverine tribes were more inclined to side with the rival Khatmiyya movement . The government supported Abd al @-@ Rahman in these commercial enterprises . Abd al @-@ Rahman 's economic activity , and the resulting wide range of contacts with merchants and owners of pump @-@ schemes for irrigating cotton fields , gave him influence among Sudanese engaged in commerce . As of 1 January 1922 the government suspended payment of allowances to Mahdist notables other than the old and those whose movements were restricted . The allowance of Abd al @-@ Rahman was increased somewhat , but only so that he could support old women and other incapable people whose allowances had been stopped . 
 By the 1920s Abd al @-@ Rahman was a respected religious and political leader . In 1921 he held a meeting at his home where the attendees signed two documents that laid out the Mahdist objectives . These were for Sudan to be ruled by Britain rather than Egypt , and for Sudan to eventually achieve self @-@ government . In the early 1920s , between 5 @,@ 000 and 15 @,@ 000 pilgrims were coming to Aba Island each year to celebrate Ramadan . Many of them identified Abd al @-@ Rahman with Isa , the prophet Jesus , and assumed that he would drive the Christian colonists out of Sudan . The British found that Abd al @-@ Rahman was in correspondence with agents and leaders in Nigeria and Cameroon , predicting the eventual victory of the Mahdists over the Christians . They blamed him for unrest in these colonies . After pilgrims from West Africa held mass demonstrations on Aba Island in 1924 , Abd al @-@ Rahman was told to put a stop to the pilgrimages . 
 For a long time the British were ambivalent in their attitude to Abd al @-@ Rahman . He had provided valuable political assistance during World War I and in 1924 . On the other hand , the Sudan Government found that his services had a hidden agenda and described his actions as " evasive and obstructive " . On balance the British found it best to treat Abd al @-@ Rahman as an ally , although some felt that Governor @-@ General Reginald Wingate ( 1900 – 18 ) was too lenient towards him . In September 1924 Sayyid Ali al @-@ Mirghani , leader of the Khatmiyya movement and Abd al @-@ Rahman 's rival , said he would prefer Sudan to be part of the Egyptian kingdom than to be an independent monarchy under Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman . At that time the British favored Sayyid Ali , whom they saw as a purely religious leader , while Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman also had potentially dangerous political ambitions . 
 = = Political crises = = 
 In 1924 there was a crisis in Egypt when a government hostile to the British was elected . On 19 November 1924 , the Governor of Sudan Sir Lee Stack was shot and assassinated while driving through Cairo . The British responded with anger , demanding of the Egyptian government a public apology , an inquiry , suppression of demonstrations and payment of a large fine . Further , they demanded withdrawal of all Egyptian officers and Egyptian army units from the Sudan , an increase to the scope of an irrigation scheme in Gezira and laws to protect foreign investors in Egypt . 
 Egyptian army units in Sudan , bound by their oath to the Egyptian king , refused to obey the orders of their British officers and mutinied . The British violently suppressed the mutiny , removed the Egyptian army from Sudan and purged the administration of Egyptian officials . The " condominium " remained legally in force , as it would until Sudan gained independence , but in practice Egypt now had no say in the administration of Sudan . In the aftermath of the upheaval the British saw educated Sudanese as potential propagators of " dangerous " nationalist ideas imported from Egypt . Although Abd al @-@ Rahman had backed the government and condemned local supporters of the Egyptians , he was also viewed with suspicion as a potential enemy of the colonial power . However , at the start of 1926 , Abd al @-@ Rahman was awarded the KBE ( Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire ) . 
 Sir Geoffrey Archer was appointed Governor @-@ General of Sudan in 1925 in place of Sir Lee Stack . One of his early decisions was to initiate the formation of the Sudan Defence Force , with a command completely separate from the Egyptian army . He dropped the Egyptian title " Sirdar " for the supreme commander , and did not wear the Egyptian <unk> . He made it very clear that he was commander in chief of a purely Sudanese army , while reassuring Sudanese officers who had served in the Egyptian army that they would be retained if they had not taken part in the mutiny . The British authorities , who had again became hostile to Mahdism , banned enlistment of Ansar into the Sudanese Defence Force . 
 The Sudan Political Service advised Archer to keep Abd al @-@ Rahman at arms length . In March 1926 Archer ignored this advice and made an official visit to Abd al @-@ Rahman on Aba Island accompanied by a full escort of troops and officials . When Archer arrived on 14 February he was formally welcomed by Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman with 1 @,@ 500 Ansar supporters . Escorted by horsemen , the dignatories went on by car to a reception at Abd al @-@ Rahman 's house . Replying to a speech by Abd al @-@ Rahman , Archer said his visit marked " an important stage forward in the relations " between Abd al @-@ Rahman and his followers and the government . Archer said he had come to cement the ties of friendship and understanding . 
 Archer 's visit precipitated a crisis in the colonial administration . It was felt he had been far too friendly to Abd al @-@ Rahman , who was viewed with suspicion by many administrators . Archer was forced to resign , replaced by Sir John <unk> . Abd al @-@ Rahman was placed under restriction on travel outside Omdurman and Khartoum and was told to instruct his supporters to halt their political and religious activities . 
 = = Growing influence and British hostility = = 
 Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman invited the Yemenite scholar Abd al @-@ Rahman ibn <unk> al @-@ Jabri to come to Omdurman and make a study of Mahdism . Al @-@ Jabri wrote a book covering the history of the movement and its justification in the hadith , essentially designed to glorify the Mahdi and his son . Abd al @-@ Rahman tried to publish the book in 1925 @-@ 26 , but the British confiscated the manuscript , which they considered to be highly seditious . To avoid publicity , they did not prosecute al @-@ Jabri but quietly deported him . 
 Abd al @-@ Rahman made overtures to the " <unk> " , the growing elite of educated people in Sudan , patronizing their social and educational institutions . He became the acknowledged leader of a group of intelligentsia who were opposed to indirect rule or unification with Egypt , and were building a Sudanese national movement . In 1931 the colonial government lowered the starting rates of pay for Sudanese officials . After protests and demonstrations were ignored , a general strike was declared on 24 November 1931 . With no other leader taking the initiative , it was left to Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman to act as mediator and successfully bring the strike to an end . This helped consolidate his position as a leader in the eyes of intelligentsia . In 1935 Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman founded al @-@ Nil ( The Nile ) , an organ of the Ansar and the first daily newspaper in Sudan in the Arabic language . The newspaper helped him gain influence with the educated elite in Sudan , including politically oriented government officials , many of whom joined the Ansar and became lifetime adherents of Abd al @-@ Rahman . 
 By the mid @-@ 1930s the British realized that Abd al @-@ Rahman expected to be recognized as royalty , had firm control over a thriving Mahdist movement , and was actively seeking new adherents . British officials became increasingly suspicious of his motives , and their correspondence showed a mixture of hostility and fear of his growing influence . In 1933 , and more forcefully in 1934 , during the prophet 's birthday celebrations Abd al @-@ Rahman displayed signs with " various expressions advertising the Mahdi 's prophetic standing " . Sir Stewart Symes , Governor @-@ General of Sudan from 1934 to 1940 , sternly warned him to remove the signs or face consequences . 
 A British view of Abd al @-@ Rahman at this time was given by Sir Stewart Symes , writing in April 1935 , " He has the defects of a Sudanese of his type , the liking of intrigue , vanity , irrelevance and opportunism . On the other hand , he has quick perceptions , panache and subtle tenacity of purpose ... He has used [ or <unk> ] the opportunities ... of laying the foundations of his Mahdist organization in the provinces ... His favorite role is that of the loyal supporter of Government who is maliciously misunderstood " . Symes refused to take action to suppress neo @-@ Mahdism , preferring to follow a policy of ensuring that Abd al @-@ Rahman conformed to agreed guidelines of behavior , with the implied threat of punishment if he broke these rules . He allowed some restrictions to be lifted , while retaining others . 
 = = Political activity under British rule = = 
 The British had ceded some power in Egypt with the Anglo @-@ Egyptian Treaty of 1922 and more in the Anglo @-@ Egyptian Treaty of 1936 . The 1936 treaty was designed to counter Benito Mussolini 's ambition to link Libya to Ethiopia via Sudan in a new Italian empire . The treaty recognized Egyptian claims of sovereignty in Sudan in return for British rights in the Nile valley and the Suez Canal . It allowed for unrestricted immigration of Egyptians to Sudan and for the return of Egyptian troops . The Sudanese were not consulted . 
 In 1937 Abd al @-@ Rahman visited England and Egypt , where he met with high @-@ ranking officials and with King Farouk . His purpose was to present Sudanese criticism of the Anglo @-@ Egyptian treaty in person . He was openly critical of the Egyptian plans for unity of the Nile valley , which he considered unrealistic . In May 1937 , his eldest son al @-@ Siddiq al @-@ Mahdi visited Egypt and was given a royal reception . These moves concerned the British , who saw them as potentially the start of a Mahdist alliance with Egypt , despite Abd al @-@ Rahman 's avowed Sudanese nationalism . 
 In the period before the Second World War ( 1939 – 1945 ) the British wanted to reduce growth of Egyptian influence in Sudan , which had become more likely as a result of the 1936 treaty , while also suppressing the ultra @-@ nationalist neo @-@ Mahdist movement . They gave their support to Sayyid Ali al @-@ Mirghani of the <unk> sect as a counterpoise to Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman . Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman responded by telling the British that Sayyid Ali al @-@ Mirghani was pro @-@ Italian due to his family commitments in Eritrea , but this was not accepted by the British . 
 The government had promulgated the Powers of Nomad <unk> Ordinance in 1922 , and had recognized and reinforced the judicial powers of over 300 tribal leaders by 1923 . They had ignored the aspirations of educated Sudanese in government employment to take a greater role in administration . The principle of indirect rule had also given the Sayyids , including Abd al @-@ Rahman , more power to prevent changes demanded by the secular opposition . In a shift of policy , the Graduates ' General Congress was launched in 1938 as a forum for the intelligentsia of Sudan to express their opinions and as an alternative voice to that of the tribal leaders , who had become discredited . 
 In August and September 1940 the Congress became split between Ansar and Khatmiyya supporters . At first the Ansar were dominant , but they lost this position by the end of 1942 . Many of Abd al @-@ Rahman 's supporters saw him as a source of financial backing and admired his advocacy of an independent Sudan , but did not follow him as a religious leader and were not members of the Ansar movement . By the end of 1942 the government had decided the Congress had no political value . The Mahdists had split into rival camps , other factions had emerged , and the attendees at the annual meeting of the Congress included artisans , merchants and illiterates . 
 In May 1944 the government created a central Advisory Council , with the full backing of Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman . The majority of the Council members were Ansar or tribal leaders . Many educated Sudanese were suspicious of the Council and drifted towards the Khatmiyya side in the 1944 elections , not for religious reasons but because they were hostile to the government , wanted to retain links with Egypt as a counterpoise to British influence and did not want a monarchy under Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman . 
 = = Lead @-@ up to independence = = 
 In August 1944 Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman met with senior Congress members and tribal leaders to discuss formation of a pro @-@ independence political party that was not associated with Mahdism . The first step taken was to launch a new daily newspaper , al @-@ Umma ( The Community ) . In February 1945 the Umma party had been organized and the party 's first secretary , Abdullah Khalil , applied for a government license . The constitution of the party made no mention of Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman or of the Ansar ; the only visible link to Abd al @-@ Rahman was the party 's reliance on him for funding . However , there were rumors that the Umma party had been created by the colonial government and aimed to place Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman on the throne . These rumors persisted until June 1945 , when the government publicly said it would not support a Mahdist monarchy . 
 Abd al @-@ Rahman at this time was a flamboyant figure with broad popular support . His stature served to diminish that of the politicians , who were seen as his followers rather than as leaders . Abd al @-@ Rahman could not afford a sudden British withdrawal , since that would open the door for an Egyptian take @-@ over and the loss of his power . The British also were against an Egyptian take @-@ over , but for different reasons . Yet Abd al @-@ Rahman could not be seen as supporting an indefinite colonial status , and continued to promote independence . Abd al @-@ Rahman and the British were engaged in delicate and unstable arrangements characterized by mutual distrust . 
 When , in 1946 , Isma 'il al @-@ Azhari of the Sudanese al @-@ <unk> party began seeking support for unification of the Nile Valley , Abd al @-@ Rahman was strongly opposed to any hint that the king of Egypt might have authority of any kind in Sudan . He and his followers set up an " Independence Front " and organized huge demonstrations throughout Sudan against the draft Anglo @-@ Egyptian agreement on Sudan . In November 1946 , Abd al @-@ Rahman left with a delegation for London via Cairo . Completely ignored by the Egyptian government in Cairo , he talked with British Prime Minister Clement Attlee for two hours in London . When Attlee asked why the Sudanese had not spoken up while Egypt pressed its claims over Sudan for the last seventy years , Abd al @-@ Rahman said that was because the British had excluded them from any talks . He went on to say the Sudanese would fight with all their power for independence . 
 Abd al @-@ Rahman supported the work of the Legislative Assembly which began in December 1948 . He saw it as the first time that Sudan 's political and religious groups had been able to meet each other in a venue where the British could not stir up disputes between the different factions . He said that Isma 'il al @-@ Azhari opposed the Assembly purely because it would bring Sudan away from Egypt and nearer to full independence . In December 1950 a member of the Umma tabled a resolution asking the Governor @-@ General to demand that Egypt and Britain grant Sudan independence at once . The British strongly opposed the measure , saying the Assembly was not truly representative since the Khatmiyya had chosen not to participate . The resolution was passed by one vote . Abd al @-@ Rahman and al @-@ Azhari both claimed victory : Abd al @-@ Rahman since the vote had been passed , and the al @-@ Azhari since the British had said the Assembly was not representative . 
 Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman said that from then on the British did everything they could to break up the Umma party and to thwart him personally . They tried without success to get tribal chiefs and village leaders to leave the Umma . He claimed that it was the Umma that forced the British to establish a committee to start drafting a constitution for an independent Sudan in 1951 , a constitution that was endorsed in April 1952 . However , broader considerations were anyway leading the British towards support for an independent Sudan despite attempts by the United States to persuade them to give Egypt a role . 
 = = Elections and independence = = 
 Egypt gained full independence with the Egyptian Revolution of 23 July 1952 in which King Farouk was overthrown by a group of officers that included Gamal Abdel Nasser , later to emerge as the sole ruler in 1954 . Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman visited London and met the British Foreign Secretary Sir Anthony Eden on 11 November 1952 . On 10 January 1953 the Egyptian government ratified an agreement with the Umma representatives and other pro @-@ independence Sudanese parties that gave the Sudanese the right of self @-@ determination . During a transition period no longer than three years parliamentary elections would be held and a Sudanese government formed . British and Egyptian troops and officials would leave the country and would be replaced by Sudanese . 
 In 1953 Abd al @-@ Rahman made a major proclamation in which he supported a republican system , " since the democratic republican system is a system deeply rooted in Islam , our pure , tolerant , and democratic religion " . The first parliamentary elections were held that year . The National Unionist Party ( NUP ) , the successor to the al @-@ <unk> party , gained a solid majority in parliament and Isma 'il al @-@ Azhari became Prime Minister . The NUP victory , greatest in northern and central Sudan , may have partly been due to support from the Khatmiyya . Another factor may have been fear that the Umma party would try to re @-@ establish a Mahdist state with Abd al @-@ Rahman as king . 
 In August 1954 Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman sponsored a tour of the south by Buth Diu of the Southern Liberal Party . In his speeches Buth Diu quoted NUP campaign promises supporting a Federal system in which the southern provinces would have considerable autonomy . Prime minister Azhari described this as seditious talk and threatened to use force to prevent secession from Sudan by the south . In May 1955 Isma 'il al @-@ Azhari announced that Sudan would seek complete independence , a reversal of the earlier NUP position in favor of union with Egypt . 
 As Isma 'il al @-@ Azhari began to assert his power , both Sayyid Ali al @-@ Mirghani and Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman became concerned that they would lose their political influence . From October 1955 Sayyid Ali began to seek ways to oust Isma 'il al @-@ Azhari from power . A key issue was whether a plebiscite should be held to determine if Sudan was to be independent of Egypt , which Sayyid Ali supported and Isma 'il al @-@ Azhari opposed . To strengthen his position in parliament , Isma 'il al @-@ Azhari started making overtures to associates of Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman to explore the idea of an NUP @-@ Umma coalition . Sudan formally became independent on 1 January 1956 . On 2 February 1956 Isma 'il al @-@ Azhari announced a new cabinet that included representatives of all political parties and factions . 
 The first parliamentary elections after independence were held on 27 February and 8 March 1958 . The result was a victory for Abd al @-@ Rahman 's Umma Party , which won 63 of the 173 seats . The Southern Sudan Federal Party competed in the election , and won 40 of the 46 seats allocated to the southern provinces . The Federal party platform represented a serious challenge to the authorities . However , when it became clear that the party 's demands for a federal structure would be ignored by the Constituent Assembly , on 16 June 1958 the southern MPs left parliament . 
 In November 1958 the army staged a coup led by General Ibrahim <unk> . Two days later Abd al @-@ Rahman proclaimed his strong support for the army 's action , saying " It grieves me greatly to say that the politicians who have led the political parties have all failed ... This now is a day of release . The men of the Sudanese army have sprung up and taken matters into their own hands ... They will not permit hesitation , anarchy or corruption to play havoc in this land ... God has placed at our disposal ... someone who will take up the reins of government with truth and decisiveness ... Rejoice at this blessed revolution and go to your work calmly and contentedly , to support the men of the Sudanese revolution " . It is possible that Abd al @-@ Rahman expected to be appointed President for Life . If so , he was disappointed . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman died in 1959 aged 74 . Throughout a long and turbulent career he had always been a strong and consistent leader of the neo @-@ Mahdist movement . By the end of the condominium in 1956 , Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman was reported to be the wealthiest of all Sudanese , although his " palace " in Khartoum was unimpressive compared to the house of a mid @-@ level British administrator . The British would have preferred the Ansar movement to be purely religious in nature , but Sayyid Abd al @-@ Rahman al @-@ Mahdi would always strive to also become the political leader of Sudan . Explanations for the resurgence of neo @-@ Mahdism in Sudan have included the British need for a figurehead , Abd al @-@ Rahman 's financial influence as his cotton growing business expanded , or a resurgence of religious and nationalist feeling in the Ansar sect . However , one biographer asserts that Abd al @-@ Rahman 's rise to power was due primarily to his charisma and mastery of manipulation . 
 Abd al @-@ Rahman 's son Sayyid al @-@ Saddiq al @-@ Mahdi was Imam of the Ansar for the next two years . After al @-@ Saddiq 's death in 1961 he was succeeded as imam by his brother Sayyid al @-@ Hadi al @-@ Mahdi , while al @-@ Saddiq 's son Sadiq al @-@ Mahdi took over the leadership of the Umma party .

 = Ave Imperator , morituri te salutant = 
 " Ave , Imperator , morituri te salutant " ( " Hail , Emperor , those who are about to die salute you " ) is a well @-@ known Latin phrase quoted in Suetonius , De Vita Caesarum ( " The Life of the Caesars " , or " The Twelve Caesars " ) . It was reportedly used during an event in AD 52 on Lake <unk> by naumachiarii — captives and criminals fated to die fighting during mock naval encounters — in the presence of the emperor Claudius . Suetonius reports that Claudius replied " Aut non " ( " or not " ) . 
 Variant wordings include " Ave Caesar " and " Nos morituri te salutamus " — the latter in the 1st person ( " We who are about to die salute you " ) — and a response in 15th century texts of " Avete vos " ( " Fare you well " ) . 
 Despite its popularization in later times , the phrase is not recorded elsewhere in Roman history . Historians question whether it was ever used as a customary salute . It was more likely an isolated appeal by desperate captives and criminals condemned to die , and noted by Roman historians in part for the unusual mass reprieve granted by Claudius to the survivors . 
 = = Historical source material = = 
 The source material comes from the works of three Roman historians , who were all born after the events of 52 AD . Suetonius ( c . 69 – 75 to after 130 , probably writing around AD 121 ) , and Cassius Dio ( around 155 – 164 to after 229 , probably writing 200 – 22 ) both wrote about the event and quoted the phrase . Tacitus ( c . 56 – 117 , writing from around 98 to 117 ) mentions the event but does not quote the phrase . 
 The first known record of the phrase is in the writings of Suetonius : 
 Even when he [ Claudius ] was on the point of letting out the water from Lake <unk> he gave a sham sea @-@ fight first . But when the combatants cried out : " Hail , emperor , they who are about to die salute thee , " he replied , " Or not " [ Sed cum <unk> <unk> : " Ave Imperator , Morituri te salutant ! " <unk> : " Aut non " . ] , and after that all of them refused to fight , maintaining that they had been pardoned . Upon this he hesitated for some time about destroying them all with fire and sword , but at last leaping from his throne and running along the edge of the lake with his ridiculous tottering gait , he induced them to fight , partly by threats and partly by promises . At this performance a Sicilian and a Rhodian fleet engaged , each numbering twelve triremes ... 
 The same incident is described in the writings of Cassius Dio , a Roman consul and historian who wrote in Greek . In Book 60 of his Roman History he states : 
 Claudius conceived the desire to exhibit a naval battle on a certain lake ; so , after building a wooden wall around it and erecting stands , he assembled an enormous multitude . Claudius and Nero were arrayed in military garb , while Agrippina wore a beautiful chlamys woven with threads of gold , and the rest of the spectators whatever pleased their fancy . Those who were to take part in the sea @-@ fight were condemned criminals , and each side had fifty ships , one part being styled " Rhodians " and the other " Sicilians . " First they assembled in a single body and all together addressed Claudius in this fashion : " Hail , Emperor ! We who are about to die salute thee [ <unk> , <unk> · οἱ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] . " And when this in no wise availed to save them and they were ordered to fight just the same , they simply sailed through their opponents ' lines , injuring each other as little as possible . This continued until they were forced to destroy one another . 
 = = = Source variations and interpretation = = = 
 The person of the main verb differs in the two sources . Suetonius quotes it with a third @-@ person plural verb ( salutant , meaning " they / those salute / greet " ) , and Cassius quotes it with a first @-@ person plural verb ( <unk> , meaning " we salute / greet " ) . Apart from this , the Latin and Greek expressions have the same meaning . 
 Claudius ' response is stated in several sources as " Avete vos ! " ( " Fare you well ! " ) , suggesting an act of favor . The earliest editions of De Vita Caesarum published in Rome in 1470 and Venice in 1471 used " Avete vos , " but this version was still accepted in the nineteenth century , as can be seen in the Baumgarten @-@ <unk> edition of 1816 . Karl Ludwig Roth returned to the better quality manuscripts for his 1857 edition — chiefly the ninth @-@ century Codex <unk> , the oldest known extant version of Suetonius ' work — and corrected Claudius ' reported response to " Aut non " . John C. Rolfe notes both responses , describing them as " one of Claudius ' feeble jokes , which the combatants pretended to understand as meaning that they need not risk their lives in battle " . Donald Kyle describes it as a possible attempt at a <unk> . Joseph Pike states in his notes on Roth 's text : 
 The reading ' Avete vos ' is from the fifteenth century manuscripts and editions . In this case the emperor is simply returning the salutation . The literal meaning is , however , ' be well ' , ' be safe ' , or ' be sound ' , and the gladiators understood it as dismissing them . 
 Basil Kennett , writing in 1820 , describes the " Avete vos " response as a cruel jest : " [ W ] hen they would gladly have interpreted it as an act of favour , and a grant of their lives , he soon gave them to understand that it proceeded from the contrary principle of barbarous cruelty , and insensibility . " 
 = = = Cultural background = = = 
 Claudius , the fourth Roman Emperor of the Julio @-@ Claudian dynasty , ruled the Roman Empire following Caligula 's death in AD 41 until his death in AD 54 . According to Suetonius , Claudius was extraordinarily fond of the games . He is said to have risen with the crowd after gladiatorial matches and given unrestrained praise to the fighters , and he was criticized for not leaving the arena during the executions as was the custom among the noble classes . 
 Claudius also presided over many new and original events . Soon after coming into power , Claudius instituted games to be held in honor of his father , Nero Claudius Drusus , on the latter 's birthday . Annual games were also held in honor of his accession , and took place at the Praetorian camp where Claudius had first been proclaimed emperor . 
 Claudius celebrated the Secular games — a religious festival that had been revived by Augustus — to mark the 800th anniversary of the founding of Rome . He also on at least one occasion participated in a wild animal hunt himself according to Pliny the Elder , setting out with the Praetorian cohorts to fight a killer whale which was trapped in the harbor of Ostia . 
 Public entertainments varied from combat between just two gladiators , to large @-@ scale events with potentially thousands of deaths . The naumachia ( also called <unk> <unk> by the Romans ) was one of the latter , a large @-@ scale and bloody spectacular combative event taking place on many ships and held in large lakes or flooded arenas . Prisoners of war and criminals condemned to die were tasked with enacting naval battles to the death for public entertainment . Those selected were known as naumachiarii . 
 Unlike gladiatorial combats , naumachiae were infrequently held — they were usually only called to celebrate notable events . Julius Caesar held an event with 6 @,@ 000 naumachiarii in the lesser <unk> , a marshy area by the Tiber , to celebrate his fourth victory to be honored by triumph . Cassius Dio writes of two naumachiae that Titus held during the inaugural games of the Flavian Amphitheater , including an event of 3 @,@ 000 men enacting a battle between the Athenians and the Syracusans ; and Domitian held a naumachia in which Dio reports " practically all the combatants and many of the spectators as well perished " . 
 The naumachia called by Claudius celebrated the completion of a drainage work and agricultural land reclamation project at Italy 's largest inland lake , Lake <unk> , an 11 mile ( 19 km ) long crater lake in the Central Apennine mountain range located around 50 miles ( 80 km ) from Rome . The project , which took eleven years to complete and employed 30 @,@ 000 men , included the leveling of a hill top and the construction of a 3 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) tunnel between the lake and the river Liri ( Lat . <unk> ) . The tunnel has been described as " the greatest Roman tunnel " ( Encyclopedia Americana ) despite initially only achieving partial success , and was the longest such tunnel until the construction of that of Mont Cenis in 1876 . According to the Annals of Tacitus : 
 in order that the impressive character of the work might be viewed by a larger number of <unk> , a naval battle was arranged upon the lake itself , on the model of an earlier spectacle given by Augustus – though with light vessels and a smaller force [ ... ] " 
 In a footnote to a 2008 publication of Tacitus ' Annals , it is noted that " such an amount of criminals [ 19 @,@ 000 according to Tacitus and other sources ] may probably represent the sweepings of the provinces as well as of Rome and Italy ; but even on this supposition the number , as Friedländer remarks ( ii , 324 ) , is suggestive of iniquitous condemnations " . 
 = = = Description of the event by Tacitus = = = 
 According to Tacitus ( writing around 50 years after the event ) : 
 Claudius equipped triremes , quadriremes , and nineteen thousand combatants : the lists he surrounded with rafts , so as to leave no unauthorized points of escape , but reserved space enough in the centre to display the vigour of the rowing , the arts of the helmsmen , the impetus of the galleys , and the usual incidents of an engagement . On the rafts were stationed companies and squadrons of the praetorian cohorts , covered by a breastwork from which to operate their catapults and ballistae : the rest of the lake was occupied by marines with decked vessels . The shores , the hills , the mountain @-@ crests , formed a kind of theatre , soon filled by an untold multitude , attracted from the neighbouring towns , and in part from the capital itself , by curiosity or by respect for the sovereign . He and Agrippina presided , the one in a gorgeous military cloak , the other – not far distant – in a Greek mantle of cloth of gold . The battle , though one of criminals [ <unk> ] , was contested with the spirit and courage of freemen ; and , after much blood had flowed , the combatants were exempted from destruction [ <unk> ] .

 H. J. Leon of the University of Texas considered this salutation in the Transactions of the American Philological Association in 1939 . He observed that the salute had become widely represented and embellished in " numerous works dealing with Roman antiquities , so that it has become one of the best known and most often cited of Roman customs " . It was recognized in lay and academic writings as a customary salute of gladiators to the emperor . And yet " there is no other ancient reference to a salute of the gladiators , and in this case it was uttered not by gladiators at all , but by naumachiarii . " A striking example of this pervasive belief even in academia can be found in historian Jérôme <unk> 's 1940 book La vie Quotidienne à Rome à l ’ <unk> de l ’ Empire ( Daily Life in Ancient Rome : The People and the City at the Height of the Empire ) . In this book the author , a member of the Académie française , professor at Le Havre and the Sorbonne , and Director of the French Academy in Rome , cites the phrase and writes in vivid and poetic detail of the gladiators ' " melancholy salutation " as they parade past the emperor prior to entering the Colosseum . 
 Following a review of the source material related to the AD 52 naumachia , Leon observes that the fighters were not gladiators but were convicted criminals sentenced to death . Their intended fate was <unk> ( massacre , or slaughter ) . The lake had been surrounded with " rafts " to prevent a mass breakout and was surrounded by " the crack soldiers of the praetorian guard , both infantry and cavalry , who were protected by ramparts and equipped with catapults and ballistae , and further reinforced by ships bearing marines ready for action " . He concludes that this was not a formal salute , but in all likelihood an isolated incident of a mass plea for sympathy or mercy by desperate convicted men sentenced to death on a specific occasion , and that 
 [ c ] <unk> the three accounts , we can reasonably assume that , condemned as they were to die , these convicts invoked Claudius with their " Morituri te salutant " , which was not a regular and formal salute , but an appeal used only on that occasion in the hope of winning the Emperor 's sympathy . When he replied " Aut non " , they took his words as meaning " aut non morituri " [ or not die ] and indicating pardon – Suetonius says " quasi <unk> data " – and refused to fight , but finally yielded either to the entreaties of the Emperor or to force , and fought bravely until the survivors were excused from further slaughter . 
 My conclusion is , accordingly , that there is no evidence whatever for the much @-@ quoted salute of the gladiators . The only two ancient references , those in Suetonius and in Dio , refer not to gladiators but to naumachiarii , men condemned to die , and even these references are to one specific episode , the circumstances of which indicate that the supposed salute was not even a regular salute of the naumachiarii . 
 Alan Baker broadly agrees , stating , " There is no evidence that this was common practice among gladiators . As far as we know , the only time this phrase was used was at an event staged by Claudius . " Plass notes that " it is hard to see why or how the phrase came to be used on this occasion if it was not a regular formula . On the other hand , if it was something that Claudius might expect to hear it would more naturally serve in its role as a feed line for his repartee portraying his invincible <unk> . " He comments on the distancing effect of the Latin source and the first person of the Greek source and notes that the interpretation and response by the fighters " seems to be a maneuver within rules governing clemency in the arena " . 
 Kyle concurs that no other sources record the " supposed gladiator salute " in any other context " and it did not come here from true gladiators " . Treated as a commodity , they were not elite gladiators but captives and criminals doomed to die , who usually fought until all were killed . When the salute or appeal failed , and they were forced to kill one another in earnest , 
 [ a ] <unk> with some initiative and inventing a pseudo @-@ gladiatorial salute , and then fighting well , these men , despite their criminal and non @-@ professional status and their intended extermination , atypically turned themselves into proper gladiators for a day . Hence some survived . 
 He concludes that " [ t ] he sources remark on the incident , in part , because it was an anomaly in arena practice — a mass <unk> reprieve . "

 As well as taking root in modern conceptions of Roman customs , the phrase has passed into contemporary culture , including use by air force pilots such as John Lerew ( his biography is titled " We Who Are About to Die " ) , a World War II film entitled Morituri , a Marvel comic of the 1980s called Strikeforce : Morituri that focused on superheroes who were inevitably going to die , the Adventure Time episode " Morituri Te <unk> " , ' a set of one @-@ act plays of the 1890s by Hermann Sudermann , Joseph Conrad 's canonical 1902 novel Heart of Darkness , James Joyce 's novel Ulysses , in the epilogue of an Agatha Christie 's book named ' A Caribbean Mystery ' , in popular music of the 1980s , as well as music in video games , in the paper title of peer @-@ reviewed medical research , in a political maiden speech , market commentary during 2008 global financial crisis and in modern art , fiction , non @-@ fiction and poetry related to the Roman period . The 1985 sci @-@ fi / comedy motion picture My Science Project had two of its main protagonists @-@ Vince and Sherman @-@ encounter a gladiatorial sentry . They were greeted the customary phrase ; which , before subduing him , translated by the affluent Sherman as simply , " He 's going to kick our ass ! "

 Bernt Michael Holmboe ( 23 March 1795 – 28 March 1850 ) was a Norwegian mathematician . He was home @-@ tutored from an early age , and was not enrolled in school until 1810 . Following a short period at the Royal Frederick University , which included a stint as assistant to Christopher Hansteen , Holmboe was hired as a mathematics teacher at the Christiania Cathedral School in 1818 , where he met the future renowned mathematician Niels Henrik Abel . Holmboe 's lasting impact on mathematics worldwide has been said to be his tutoring of Abel , both in school and privately . The two became friends and remained so until Abel 's early death . Holmboe moved to the Royal Frederick University in 1826 , where he worked until his own death in 1850 . 
 Holmboe 's significant impact on mathematics in the fledgling Norway was his textbook in two volumes for secondary schools . It was widely used , but faced competition from Christopher Hansteen 's alternative offering , sparking what may have been Norway 's first debate about school textbooks . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Bernt Michael Holmboe was born in Vang in 1795 , the son of vicar Jens Holmboe ( 1746 – 1823 ) and his wife Cathrine Holst ( 1763 – 1823 ) . He grew up in Eidsberg with his nine siblings , and was the elder brother of noted philologist Christopher Andreas Holmboe . Holmboe was homeschooled from an early age , but was sent to the Christiania Cathedral School in 1810 to complete his secondary education . There he undertook extracurricular studies in mathematics . He enrolled as a student at the Royal Frederick University in 1814 , a turbulent year in Norwegian history . Norway had been a province of Denmark since 1397 , but had come under Swedish control in the January 1814 Treaty of Kiel . Following Norway 's declaration of independence in the Constitution of 17 May , Sweden responded by waging a military campaign against Norway during the summer of 1814 . Holmboe was a spokesperson for the student group opposed to the presence of Swedish troops in the country . Any outspokenness from the student community was highly visible at the time , as the university had only seventeen students as of 1813 , its year of establishment . 
 As well as his private studies , Holmboe attended lectures given by Søren <unk> . In 1815 he was appointed to the position of scientific assistant under Christopher Hansteen , a lecturer at the university , and delivered some lectures himself . In early 1818 , Holmboe became a mathematics teacher at the Christiania Cathedral School , a position that had become vacant in 1817 . The school principal , Jacob <unk> , had invited Holmboe 's brother , Christopher Andreas , who had also studied mathematics , to take up the position , but he had decided instead to concentrate on philology ; Christopher went on to research the Sanskrit language among others . In his teaching , Holmboe drew inspiration from Joseph @-@ Louis Lagrange . 
 = = = Niels Henrik Abel = = = 
 At the Christiania Cathedral School , Holmboe met Niels Henrik Abel , then a pupil there . Holmboe quickly discovered Abel 's talent , and proclaimed him as a " splendid genius " in his report card . The school 's primary focus was on classical education and Latin , and so Holmboe tutored Abel privately . His personal support for Abel has been called " [ Holmboe 's ] most important contribution to mathematics " . 
 Holmboe and Abel became close friends . Two of Holmboe 's younger brothers studied with Abel , and the three were also on friendly terms . Abel was invited to the Holmboe family residence in Eidsberg on several occasions , including to celebrate Christmas . 
 Abel died from tuberculosis in 1829 , at the age of twenty @-@ six . Ten years after Abel 's death Holmboe edited and published his complete works in two volumes — Oeuvres complètes de N.H. Abel ( ' Complete Works of N.H. Abel ' ) . He was the first to do so . 
 = = Later life and career = = 
 Holmboe published his first textbook in mathematics in 1825 . The 274 @-@ page book was named Lærebog i <unk> . Første Deel ( Textbook in Mathematics . Part One ) . In 1827 he followed with the second volume , Lærebog i <unk> . Anden Deel ( Textbook in Mathematics . Part Two ) , consisting of a further 155 pages . He used his own teaching experience as the background for his writing ; mainly abstract , the purpose of the books was to instill logical thinking . For instance , in the field geometry , it enticed readers to envisage a figure instead of putting it to paper . The books became widely used , and were reprinted in four and five volumes respectively . 
 In 1826 , Holmboe was appointed a lecturer at the Royal Frederick University . Some claimed that he owed his appointment to Abel 's absence , as the latter was travelling around in Europe at that time . Holmboe also taught mathematics at a military college , from 1826 until his death , and was promoted to professor at the Royal Frederick University in 1834 . His later publications include <unk> ( <unk> ) ( 1833 ) , <unk> og <unk> <unk> ( Plan and Spherical <unk> ) ( 1834 ) , and Lærebog i den <unk> Mathematik ( Textbook of Advanced Mathematics ) ( 1849 ) . Holmboe was an influence on other mathematicians as well as Abel , including Ole Jacob Broch ( born 1818 ) . 
 At the university , Holmboe again met Christopher Hansteen , who had become a professor there in 1816 . In 1835 , Hansteen published his own mathematics textbook for secondary schools . A reaction to Holmboe 's books and method of teaching , it was more practically oriented . Holmboe wrote a review of the book for the newspaper Morgenbladet , in which he advised schools not to use it . A public debate followed , with contributions from other mathematicians . It has been claimed that this was the first debate on the subject of school textbooks in Norway . Hansteen 's textbook was not reprinted . 
 Holmboe also became involved in the field of insurance . From 1832 to 1848 he was a member of <unk> for private <unk> og <unk> , the country 's first public committee for the supervision of insurance companies . On the other side of the table , from 1847 Holmboe was a member of the board of directors of the insurance company <unk> , founded by his former student Ole Jacob Broch .

 = Damien ( South Park ) = 
 " Damien " is the tenth episode in the first season of the American animated television series South Park . It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on February 4 , 1998 . In the episode , the boys ' class is joined by a new student named Damien , who has been sent by his father Satan to find Jesus and arrange a boxing match between the two . The majority of South Park 's residents bet on Satan to win the match due to his enormous size and muscular physique , but Satan ultimately throws the fight and reveals he bet on Jesus , thus winning everybody 's money . 
 The episode was written by series co @-@ creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone , with additional dialogue by Dave Polsky , and directed by Parker . The episode serves as a satire on religion , faith and the nature of good and evil , as well as a commentary on commercialism , the cult of celebrity in America and the nature of children . It was originally conceptualized as a Christmas special , but the original broadcast was pushed forward when Parker and Stone decided instead to make " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " the season 's holiday episode . 
 " Damien " received generally positive reviews and was viewed by 3 @.@ 2 million households when it was first broadcast , making it the highest rated cable program the week it aired . The episode marked the first appearance of Satan , who would become a recurring South Park character , as well as the character of Damien himself , who was inspired by the antagonist of the 1976 horror film The Omen . Parker and Stone also said the episode introduced several key characteristics of the Cartman character that have endured throughout the rest of the series . Michael Buffer , the boxing ring announcer best known for the catchphrase " Let 's get ready to rumble ! " , makes a guest appearance in " Damien " as himself . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Cartman is excited about his upcoming birthday party and lets everyone invited know what present he expects to receive from each . When they protest , he threatens to ban them from eating the food his mother makes , something that immediately convinces them . They encounter a new student named Damien , son of Satan . The other boys mock the " new kid " and , in response , Damien turns Kenny into a duck @-@ billed platypus . Damien informs Jesus that Satan will rise for a final battle with him of good versus evil . South Park residents immediately begin making bets on the fight . Cartman is angered to learn the event is scheduled for the same time as his party , and the children struggle to choose between the two events . 
 The entire town bets on Jesus to win the fight , but begin to lose faith when Satan appears for the weigh @-@ in . He is huge and weighs a little over 320 pounds ( 150 kg ) , while Jesus weighs a mere 135 pounds ( 61 kg ) , and the citizens of South Park begin changing their bets . Jesus confronts the South Park residents about their changed betting slips after learning only one person is still betting on Jesus to win . Distraught , Jesus asks Stan , Kyle and Chef to help him train . Damien gets counseling from Mr. Mackey , who recommends he just try being nice no matter what the other children do , just like with unpopular British child Pip . Damien tries to apologize to the boys for setting fire to the playground and turning Kenny into a duck @-@ billed platypus , stating that he was " doing his father 's bidding " and he did not have a choice . The boys , however , still continue to act negatively towards Damien . Cartman 's birthday party begins , as does the fight . Damien and Pip arrive uninvited to the party , but the children finally accept Damien after he hurls Pip in the air and makes him explode in a shower of fireworks . However , a furious Cartman ends his party early after opening Kyle 's present to discover that it 's not what he had in mind . 
 Meanwhile , Jesus is disheartened by the town 's lack of faith in him , and he does not retaliate to Satan 's attacks against him , despite Satan 's apparent taunting of " hit me " . Chef and the children make it for the end of the fight and offer Jesus some words of encouragement . Inspired , Jesus finally throws a single weak punch . However , Satan then takes a dive and goes down for the count . Afterward , Satan reveals that his plan had , in fact , been to bet on Jesus and then throw the fight , winning him a lot of money and real estate from the South Park residents . The townspeople are angered by this , until Stan reminds them that Jesus told them not to bet on Satan . The whole town then asks forgiveness of Jesus , who accepts the apology . Kenny dies when Jimbo identifies him as a rare duck @-@ billed platypus and shoots him . Damien bids goodbye to Stan and Kyle since his dad " is always on the move " he has to leave . Meanwhile , Cartman has continued his party even after kicking everyone out and having eaten all the food himself .

 " Damien " was written by series co @-@ creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone , with additional dialogue by Dave Polsky , and was directed by Parker . " Damien " first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on February 4 , 1998 . It was highly anticipated in part because it was the first new episode of South Park in about two months , since the extremely popular Christmas special " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " aired on December 17 , 1997 . Before " Damien " even ran , Mike Duffy of Detroit Free Press said the episode was " certain to become one of the show 's signature moments " . In fact , Parker and Stone originally intended for " Damien " to be the season 's Christmas episode . Although they had long planned to feature Mr. Hankey in the show , they did not decide to make him a Christmas character until halfway through the filming of " Damien " , during which time they decided to make " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " the holiday episode instead . Nevertheless , they decided to finish production of " Damien " first , even though it would not air until after the " Mr. Hankey " episode . 
 Parker said he and Stone did not intend for " Damien " to be offensive to Christians or any other religion : " In South Park , Jesus is a great guy , he 's on our show , and in this episode he 's the hero . We 're not in the business of offending people . We 're in the business of making people laugh . " The mean way Damien is treated by his fellow students when he joins the school , as well as Damien 's reactions to the treatment , were inspired by Parker 's experience of the second grade , when he started at a Cheyenne , Wyoming elementary school in the last three weeks of the school year . Parker said , " It was brutal ... Everybody already had their little groups and the year was almost over , so I wasn 't going to fit into any of them , and I just wanted to destroy and kill , which was the inspiration for this show . " 
 Michael Buffer , the boxing ring announcer best known for his catchphrase , " Let 's get ready to rumble ! " , made a guest appearance as himself in " Damien " . Parker and Stone originally planned to use the catchphrase without Buffer , but when they learned that Buffer had legally trademarked the phrase , they included him in the episode since getting the rights for the catchphrase cost nearly as much as hiring Buffer for a guest appearance . Parker and Stone both said Buffer was friendly and they enjoyed working with him . Voice actor Mike Judge , star of Beavis and Butt @-@ Head and King of the Hill , had originally been slated to provide the voice of the Damien character , and even recorded several lines for the part . However , since Judge lives in Austin , Texas , it proved too difficult to for him to come back and rerecord lines as the script and episode changed , so Stone instead provided the character 's voice . Judge later provided Kenny 's un @-@ muffled line when he removed his parka in South Park : Bigger , Longer & Uncut . 
 By the time " Damien " was animated , much of the drawing and animation responsibilities that had previously been handled by Parker and Stone were now being delegated to a team of animators . The duo were particularly proud of the animation during the boxing match between Jesus and Satan , which used elements of perspective and three @-@ dimension seldom used in the series before ; Parker said it was " definitely the most action [ oriented ] stuff we 'd done [ so far ] " . While animating Jesus , Parker and Stone deliberately left glitches in the animation that made it appear skin was showing beneath the beard on the left @-@ hand side of the character 's face . Parker said this was done because it was the way Jesus appeared in the crudely animated The Spirit of Christmas , a 1995 animated short film by Parker and Stone that served as a precursor to South Park , and they wanted to maintain that nuance for the character . 
 Parker and Stone said a number of Cartman 's characteristics which have endured throughout the South Park series started in " Damien " . Specifically , his voice took on a higher @-@ pitch that was more nasally and whiney than in previous episodes ; Stone described it as a " self @-@ indulgent accent " . Some of his regular vocal mannerisms were also developed in the episode , including his use of the sound " <unk> " while saying the word " Here " , and the way he says " Hey you <unk> " while talking to his friends . Parker , who provides the voice of Cartman , said the characteristics came about naturally while filming the episode : " This show for some reason , for whatever reason , maybe I just lost interest , but I was trying all these messed up things with him and all these things sort of stuck . " 
 " Damien " included the first appearance of Satan , who would become a commonly recurring character throughout the series . Although Satan displays an evil and unscrupulous personality in " Damien " , he is portrayed in later episodes as a thoughtful , sensitive and often deeply conflicted character . " Damien " was the first episode Parker and Stone wrote that included school counselor Mr. Mackey and local religious leader Priest Maxi , but they were also included in " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " , which aired before " Damien " even though it was produced afterward . Although Jesus had been introduced as a South Park character in previous episodes , " Damien " marked the first time he interacted with the main characters outside of his public access talk show , Jesus and Pals . Parker said many viewers thought the character was a crazy person who falsely believed he was Jesus , and he and Stone wanted to show in this episode that he was supposed to be the actual Jesus . " Damien " is also the first episode to feature South Park 's bar , which is simply called " Bar " . 
 Prior to the broadcast , Parker and Stone said " Damien " would be the first episode in which Kenny would not be killed ; ultimately , however , Kenny was shot by Jimbo at the end of the pay @-@ per @-@ view fight . Kenny is turned into a duck @-@ billed platypus in the episode , which Parker said was done because , " Duck billed platypuses are something I 've always been infatuated with . They 're just so bizarre . " In the original script , Pip , the unpopular British student inspired by the character of the same name in Charles Dickens 's Great Expectations , was originally supposed to be killed and permanently removed from the show after " Damien " , in which Damien projects Pip into the air and blows him up in a shower of fireworks . However , Parker and Stone decided they should not kill any student characters except for Kenny , so they decided not to kill Pip and to bring him back for future episodes . 
 " Damien " was later released , along with eleven other episodes , in a three @-@ DVD set in November 1998 . It was included in the second volume , which also included the episodes " An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig " , " Death " and " Pinkeye " . The episode , along with the other twelve from the first season , was also included in the DVD release " South Park : The Complete First Season " , which was released on November 12 , 2002 . Parker and Stone recorded commentary tracks for each episode , but they were not included with the DVDs due to " standards " issues with some of the statements ; Parker and Stone refused to allow the tracks to be edited and censored , so they were released in a CD completely separately from the DVDs .

 " Damien " has been described as a satire on religion , faith and the nature of good and evil , as well as a commentary on commercialism and the cult of celebrity in American culture . Parker said the writers sought to satirize the speed and ease at which the followers of Jesus lose faith in him and bet against him . Religious writer Michel Clasquin said the abandonment of Jesus demonstrates , " Like many people in the real world , the faith of the town 's people cannot withstand the hard times . " Parker said , " Everybody puts their trust in Satan and ends up getting screwed . There is a bigger message – all in all , a pretty wholesome message . That 's why South Park works . Sometimes we have a message . " 
 Parker also said he and Stone purposely wrote the episode to present Jesus as the hero from a " humanist approach " ; Clasquin said this is demonstrated by the fact that Jesus becomes caught up in people 's expectations for the fight and becomes offended when people bet against him : " This satirical gesture beautifully draws attention to the sheer humanity of Jesus . He really is a man , just as we are men and women . He is open to fear and uncertainty . " Several writers said the episode also lampooned the way Americans can turn anything , even a religious situation , into a commercially hyped event . Matt Zoller Seitz of The Star @-@ Ledger said : " They aren 't making fun of organized religion ( though they have in the past ) . They 're making fun of those who would turn religion into entertainment and entertainment into a kind of religion . " Seitz said the episode mocks " morality cops who misbehave in private " like Priest Maxi , who secretly bets the parish against Jesus even as he admonished congregation members for siding with Satan . 
 Religious writer Michel Clasquin said the episode also demonstrates the ease with which people blend their religious convictions with lessons from pop culture , particularly with Stan 's confusion of a Star Trek quote with a lesson from Jesus Christ . Additionally , Clasquin said the fact that even Priest Maxi recognizes Jesus as " that guy from the public access show " demonstrates that even the supposedly most religious people are not always the most open to genuine religious experiences . Clasquin also said elements of the Crucifixion of Jesus are alluded to in the boxing match with Satan . 
 In addition to the religious themes , the cruel way in which Damien is treated by the other children is a satire on the tendency of schoolchildren to relentlessly pick on new students . Stone said of this aspect of the episode , " The whole basis of South Park was that kids are little <unk> and civilization and society controls them . Instead of what a lot of hippies and Democrats think , which is we 're born innocent and pure and society corrupts us . We believe the first way , that society controls you and makes you a better person , ultimately , because when you 're little , you 're just a little asshole . " 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The voice for Satan , provided by Parker , was inspired by the voice of the Pinhead character at the ending of the 1988 horror film , Hellbound : Hellraiser II , when Pinhead emotionally recalls his old life , when he was a good person . The animators went through several sketch drafts for Satan because , in Parker 's words , " There 's so many ways to go with him and we couldn 't figure out the right one for a long time " . The large and muscular look of the character stemmed from the fact that the script called for Satan to massively outweigh Jesus , and that look has persisted for the character throughout the rest of the series . 
 The character of Damien himself was also first featured in this episode ; although he appeared as a background character in a handful of future episodes , he seldom has a speaking role and is never again featured as prominently as he was in " Damien " . The character was inspired by Damien Thorn , the child antichrist character in the 1976 horror film The Omen . The music which plays in the episode whenever Damien performs magic is also directly inspired by the music from that film ; that same demonic chorus would later be reused in the twelfth season episode " Britney 's New Look " . ( The lyric " <unk> Dominus " repeatedly sung by the demonic chorus in the episode translates from Latin as " Ass Master " . ) The scene in which the boys tell Damien his mom is " a real dog " is also a reference to The Omen . In that film , the actual Antichrist 's mother was a jackal . 
 In addition to Michael Buffer , the American boxing promoter Don King is featured prominently in " Damien " as Satan 's promoter . Parker said he and Stone decided to spoof King only because " it 's just sort of who annoyed us that week . It 's so random ... there is no point to who we 're ripping on . It 's definitely nothing personal . " Nancy Kerrigan , the Olympic figure skater attacked on orders of fellow skater Tonya Harding at the 1994 Winter Olympics , is referred to in a pep talk Stan gives Jesus . Stan wrongfully claims Kerrigan won the gold medal until Kyle reminds him she won the silver ; Parker said this was done because he felt the perception of Kerrigan was extremely high among Americans considering she only actually achieved second place . During that same pep talk , Stan tells Jesus , " You know , someone once said , ' Don 't try to be a great man , just be a man . ' " Although Stan says this was a quote from Jesus himself , it was actually a line from the 1996 film , Star Trek : First Contact . " Damien " also includes a reference to singer Nancy Sinatra , the daughter of legendary crooner Frank Sinatra . Mr. Garrison , while discussing great singers of the baroque period , goes on to say that " Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass " . 
 The Jesus Vs . Satan pay @-@ per @-@ view event " Boutin ' at the Mountain " is a parody of similarly advertised pay @-@ to @-@ watch boxing events featured on the premium cable channel HBO . Before Jimbo shoots Kenny in his platypus state , he screams , " It 's coming right for us ! " This is a reference to the previous South Park episode " Volcano " , in which Jimbo takes the children hunting and tells them to shout the phrase before shooting anything to get around restrictive hunting laws . Cartman insults Damien by asking if he got his haircut from Stevie Wonder , a blind soul and R & B singer . For his birthday , Cartman wants the complete line of a set of action figures called Mega Man . Although named Mega Man , the multi @-@ colored figures were actually inspired by the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers , the 1993 children 's action series which was still popular at the time of the episode 's original broadcast . The script was originally written with direct references to the Power Rangers , but Comedy Central asked Parker and Stone to change the name due to copyright issues . Cartman receives Ants in the Pants , an actual children 's tabletop game , as a birthday present . Stone described Ants in the Pants as " the lamest game ever " , which is why Cartman responds so negatively to the gift in the episode .

 " Damien " received a 6 @.@ 4 Nielsen rating , a record high for the show until it was broken two weeks later by the episode " Mecha @-@ Streisand " ( which received a 6 @.@ 9 rating , translating to 5 @.@ 4 million viewers in 3 @.@ 2 million households ) . It was the highest rated cable program the week it aired , with viewership among 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ olds being higher than the number of households . The network averages viewer ratings of 276 @,@ 000 households during prime time and , prior to South Park , the channel 's highest rating was from the second season premiere of Absolutely Fabulous , which was seen by 1 @.@ 24 million households . 
 Parker said following the tremendous success of " Mr Hankey , the Christmas Poo " , much of the direct feedback he received for " Damien " was negative . Parker described it as the " first sort of backlash " he had experienced with South Park , with fans claiming the show was losing its edge and that Parker and Stone had " sold out " . Parker said , " We kept hearing that word so much . We were like , ' What does that mean , sold out ? What did we get and what did we do ? ' We just kept doing what we thought was funny , we didn 't go start making commercials or anything . But everybody was saying we sold out . " Nevertheless , the episode received generally positive reviews , and has been described as one of South Park 's " classic episodes " . 
 Rolling Stone contributor Doug Pratt called it a " high point " of the first season . Kinney Littlefield of the Orange County Register said of the episode , " All this proves once again that animated series are great platforms for hot topics that live action shows don 't dare grab head on . South Park 's allegory of good and evil is more apt and knowing than anything seen on ' Christy ' or ' Touched by an Angel ' . <unk> too . " However , Littlefield also said some of the show 's graphic dialogue , like the phrase " poop on a stick " , was growing " pretty darn redundant " . Gary <unk> of The Columbus Dispatch described the " Damien " episode as perhaps " the most outrageous yet " . Virginia Rohan of The Record praised the episode , saying , " The episode is funny , and ultimately , good does conquer evil , albeit for all the wrong reasons . " Chicago Sun @-@ Times writer Lon Grahnke gave the episode three stars and called it simultaneously strange and funny . Eric Mink of the New York Daily News called the episode " awfully funny " and praised its satirical element , although he warned it was potentially very offensive to some viewers : " A scene in which the kids offer profane between @-@ rounds encouragement to Jesus could make even thick @-@ skinned viewers wince a bit . " Likewise , Star @-@ Ledger reporter Matt Zoller Seitz said , " Tonight 's episode is crazy , vulgar and borderline blasphemous ; it is also , if you 're in the right frame of mind , <unk> funny .

 = SMS Goeben = 
 SMS Goeben was the second of two Moltke @-@ class battlecruisers of the Imperial German Navy , launched in 1911 and named after the German Franco @-@ Prussian War veteran General August Karl von Goeben . Along with her sister ship , Goeben was similar to the previous German battlecruiser design , Von der Tann , but larger , with increased armor protection and two more main guns in an additional turret . Goeben and Moltke were significantly larger and better armored than the comparable British Indefatigable class . 
 Several months after her commissioning in 1912 , Goeben , with the light cruiser Breslau , formed the German Mediterranean Division and patrolled there during the Balkan Wars . After the outbreak of World War I on 28 July 1914 , Goeben and Breslau bombarded French positions in North Africa and then evaded British naval forces in the Mediterranean and reached Constantinople . The two ships were transferred to the Ottoman Empire on 16 August 1914 , and Goeben became the flagship of the Ottoman Navy as Yavuz Sultan Selim , usually shortened to Yavuz . By bombarding Russian facilities in the Black Sea , she brought Turkey into World War I on the German side . The ship operated primarily against Russian forces in the Black Sea during the war , including several inconclusive engagements with Russian battleships . She made a sortie into the Aegean in January 1918 that Battle of Imbros , where Yavuz sank a pair of British monitors but was herself badly damaged by mines . 
 In 1936 she was officially renamed TCG Yavuz ( " Ship of the Turkish Republic Yavuz " ) ; she carried the remains of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk from Istanbul to İzmit in 1938 . Yavuz remained the flagship of the Turkish Navy until she was decommissioned in 1950 . She was scrapped in 1973 , after the West German government declined an invitation to buy her back from Turkey . She was the last surviving ship built by the Imperial German Navy , and the longest @-@ serving dreadnought @-@ type ship in any navy . 
 = = Design = = 
 Goeben was 186 @.@ 6 meters ( 612 ft 2 in ) long , 29 @.@ 4 m ( 96 ft ) wide , and had a draft of 9 @.@ 19 m ( 30 ft 2 in ) fully loaded . The ship displaced 22 @,@ 979 t ( 22 @,@ 616 long tons ) normally , and 25 @,@ 400 t ( 25 @,@ 000 long tons ) fully loaded . Goeben was powered by four @-@ shaft Parsons steam turbines in two sets and 24 coal @-@ fired Schulz @-@ Thornycroft water @-@ tube boilers , which provided a rated 51 @,@ 289 shp ( 38 @,@ 246 kW ) and a top speed of 25 @.@ 5 knots ( 47 @.@ 2 km / h ; 29 @.@ 3 mph ) . At 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) , the ship had a range of 4 @,@ 120 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 630 km ; 4 @,@ 740 mi ) . 
 The ship was armed with a main battery of ten 28 cm SK L / 50 guns in five twin gun turrets . Her secondary armament consisted of twelve 15 cm SK L / 45 guns in casemates in the central portion of the ship and twelve 8 @.@ 8 cm SK L / 45 guns in the bow , in the stern , and around the forward conning tower . She was also equipped with four 50 cm ( 20 in ) submerged torpedo tubes . 
 = = Service history = = 
 The Imperial German Navy ( Kaiserliche Marine ) ordered Goeben , the third German battlecruiser , on 8 April 1909 under the provisional name " H " from the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg , under construction number 201 . Her keel was laid on 19 August ; the hull was completed and the ship was launched on 28 March 1911 . Fitting @-@ out work followed , and she was commissioned into the German Navy on 2 July 1912 . 
 When the First Balkan War broke out in October 1912 , the German General Staff determined that a naval Mediterranean Division ( Mittelmeer @-@ Division ) was needed to project German power in the Mediterranean , and thus dispatched Goeben and the light cruiser Breslau to Constantinople . The two ships left Kiel on 4 November and arrived on 15 November 1912 . Beginning in April 1913 , Goeben visited many Mediterranean ports including Venice , Pola , and Naples , before sailing into Albanian waters . Following this trip , Goeben returned to Pola and remained there from 21 August to 16 October for maintenance . 
 On 29 June 1913 , the Second Balkan War broke out and the Mediterranean Division was retained in the area . On 23 October 1913 , Konteradmiral Souchon assumed command of the squadron . Goeben and Breslau continued their activities in the Mediterranean , and visited some 80 ports before the outbreak of World War I. The navy made plans to replace Goeben with her sister Moltke , but the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo , Bosnia , on 28 June 1914 and the subsequent rise in tensions between the Great Powers made this impossible . 
 After the assassination , Admiral Souchon assessed that war was imminent between the Central Powers and the Triple Entente , and ordered his ships to make for Pola for repairs . Engineers came from Germany to work on the ship . Goeben had 4 @,@ 460 boiler tubes replaced , among other repairs . Upon completion , the ships departed for Messina .

 = = = = Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau = = = = 
 Kaiser Wilhelm II had ordered that in the event of war , Goeben and Breslau should either conduct raids in the western Mediterranean to prevent the return of French troops from North Africa to Europe , or break out into the Atlantic and attempt to return to German waters , on the squadron commander 's discretion . On 3 August 1914 , the two ships were en route to Algeria when Souchon received word of the declaration of war against France . Goeben bombarded Philippeville ( now <unk> , Algeria ) for about 10 minutes early on 3 August while Breslau shelled Bône ( now Annaba , on the site of the ancient city of Hippo ) in accordance with the Kaiser 's order . Admirals Alfred von Tirpitz and Hugo von Pohl then transmitted secret orders to Souchon instructing him to sail to Constantinople , in direct contravention of the Kaiser 's instructions and without his knowledge . 
 Since Goeben could not reach Constantinople without coaling , Souchon headed for Messina . The Germans encountered the British battlecruisers HMS Indefatigable and Indomitable , but as Germany was not yet at war with Britain , no violence ensued . The British turned to follow Goeben and Breslau , but the German ships were able to outrun the British , and arrived in Messina by 5 August . Refueling in Messina was complicated by the declaration of Italian neutrality on 2 August . Under international law , combatant ships were permitted only 24 hours in a neutral port . Sympathetic Italian naval authorities in the port allowed Goeben and Breslau to remain in port for around 36 hours while the ships coaled from a German collier . Despite the additional time , Goeben 's fuel stocks were not sufficient to permit the voyage to Constantinople , so Souchon arranged to rendezvous with another collier in the Aegean Sea . The French fleet remained in the western Mediterranean , since the French naval commander in the Mediterranean , Admiral Lapeyrère , was convinced the Germans would either attempt to escape to the Atlantic or join the Austrians in Pola . 
 Souchon 's two ships departed Messina early on 6 August through the southern entrance to the strait and headed for the eastern Mediterranean . The two British battlecruisers were 100 miles away , while a third , Inflexible , was coaling in Bizerta , Tunisia . The only British naval force in Souchon 's way was the 1st Cruiser Squadron , which consisted of the four armored cruisers Defence , Black Prince , Duke of Edinburgh and Warrior under the command of Rear Admiral Ernest Troubridge . The Germans headed initially towards the Adriatic in a feint ; the move misled Troubridge , who sailed to intercept them in the mouth of the Adriatic . After realizing his mistake , Troubridge reversed course and ordered the light cruiser Dublin and two destroyers to launch a torpedo attack on the Germans . Breslau 's lookouts spotted the ships , and in the darkness , she and Goeben evaded their pursuers undetected . Troubridge broke off the chase early on 7 August , convinced that any attack by his four older armored cruisers against Goeben — armed with her larger 28 cm guns — would be suicidal . Souchon 's journey to Constantinople was now clear . 
 Goeben refilled her coal bunkers off the island of <unk> near Naxos . During the afternoon of 10 August , the two ships entered the Dardanelles . They were met by an Ottoman picket boat , which guided them through to the Sea of Marmara . To circumvent neutrality requirements , the Ottoman government proposed that the ships be transferred to its ownership " by means of a fictitious sale . " Before the Germans could approve this , the Ottomans announced on 11 August that they had purchased the ships for 80 million Marks . In a formal ceremony the two ships were commissioned in the Ottoman Navy on 16 August . On 23 September , Souchon accepted an offer to command the Turkish fleet . Goeben was renamed Yavuz Sultan Selim and Breslau was renamed Midilli ; their German crews donned Ottoman uniforms and fezzes .

 On 29 October Yavuz bombarded Sevastopol in her first operation against Imperial Russia , though the Ottoman Empire was not yet at war with the Entente ; Souchon conducted the operation to force Turkey into the war on the side of Germany . A 25 @.@ 4 cm ( 10 in ) shell struck the ship in the after funnel , but it failed to detonate and did negligible damage . Two other hits inflicted minor damage . The ship and her escorts passed through an inactive Russian minefield during the bombardment . As she returned to Turkish waters , Yavuz came across the Russian minelayer Prut which scuttled herself with 700 mines on board . During the engagement the escorting Russian destroyer Lieutenant Pushkin was damaged by two of Yavuz 's secondary battery 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) shells . In response to the bombardment , Russia declared war on 1 November , thus forcing the Ottomans into the wider world war . France and Great Britain bombarded the Turkish fortresses guarding the Dardanelles on 3 November and formally declared war two days later . From this engagement , the Russians drew the conclusion that the entire Black Sea Fleet would have to remain consolidated so it could not be defeated in detail ( one ship at a time ) by Yavuz . 
 Yavuz , escorted by Midilli , intercepted the Russian Black Sea Fleet 17 nautical miles ( 31 km ; 20 mi ) off the Crimean coastline on 18 November as it returned from a bombardment of Trebizond . Despite the noon hour the conditions were foggy and none of the capital ships were spotted initially . The Black Sea Fleet had experimented with concentrating fire from several ships under the control of one " master " ship before the war , and Evstafi held her fire until Ioann Zlatoust , the master ship , could see Yavuz . When the gunnery commands were finally received they showed a range over 4 @,@ 000 yards ( 3 @,@ 700 m ) in excess of Evstafi 's own estimate of 7 @,@ 700 yards ( 7 @,@ 000 m ) , so Evstafi opened fire using her own data before Yavuz turned to fire its broadside . She scored a hit with her first salvo as a 12 @-@ inch shell partially penetrated the armor casemate protecting one of Yavuz 's 15 @-@ centimeter ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) secondary guns . It detonated some of the ready @-@ use ammunition , starting a fire that filled the casemate and killed the entire gun crew . A total of thirteen men were killed and three were wounded . 
 Yavuz returned fire and hit Evstafi in the middle funnel ; the shell detonated after it passed through the funnel and destroyed the antennae for the fire @-@ control radio , so that Evstafi could not correct Ioann Zlatoust 's inaccurate range data . The other Russian ships either used Ioann Zlatoust 's incorrect data or never saw Yavuz and failed to register any hits . Yavuz hit Evstafi four more times , although one shell failed to detonate , before Rear Admiral Wilhelm Souchon decided to break contact after 14 minutes of combat . The four hits out of nineteen 28 cm ( 11 in ) shells fired killed 34 men and wounded 24 . 
 The following month , on 5 – 6 December , Yavuz and Midilli provided protection for troop transports , and on 10 December , Yavuz bombarded Batum . On 23 December , Yavuz and Hamidiye escorted three transports to Trebizond . While returning from another transport escort operation on 26 December , Yavuz struck a mine that exploded beneath the conning tower , on the starboard side , about one nautical mile outside the Bosphorus . The explosion tore a 50 @-@ square @-@ meter ( 540 sq ft ) hole in the ship 's hull , but the torpedo bulkhead held . Two minutes later , Yavuz struck a second mine on the port side , just forward of the main battery wing barbette ; this tore open a 64 @-@ square @-@ meter ( 690 sq ft ) hole . The bulkhead bowed in 30 cm ( 12 in ) but retained watertight protection of the ship 's interior . However , some 600 tons of water flooded the ship . There was no dock in the Ottoman Empire large enough to service Yavuz , so temporary repairs were effected inside steel cofferdams , which were pumped out to create a dry work area around the damaged hull . The holes were patched with concrete , which held for several years before more permanent work was necessary . 
 = = = = = 1915 = = = = = 
 Still damaged , Yavuz sortied from the Bosphorus on 28 January and again on 7 February 1915 to help Midilli escape the Russian fleet ; she also covered the return of the protected cruiser Hamidiye . Yavuz then underwent repair work to the mine damage until May . On 1 April , with repairs incomplete , Yavuz left the Bosphorus in company with Midilli to cover the withdrawal of Hamidiye and the protected cruiser Mecidiye , which had been sent to bombard Odessa . Strong currents , however , forced the cruisers 15 miles ( 24 km ) east to the approaches of the Dnieper @-@ Bug Liman ( bay ) that led to Nikolayev . As they sailed west after a course correction , Mecidiye struck a mine and sank , so this attack had to be aborted . After Yavuz and Midilli appeared off Sevastopol and sank two cargo steamers , the Russian fleet chased them all day , and detached several destroyers after dusk to attempt a torpedo attack . Only one destroyer , Gnevny , was able to close the distance and launch an attack , which missed . Yavuz and Midilli returned to the Bosphorus unharmed . 
 On 25 April , the same day the Allies landed at Gallipoli , Russian naval forces arrived off the Bosphorus and bombarded the forts guarding the strait . Two days later Yavuz Sultan Selim headed south to the Dardanelles to bombard Allied troops at Gallipoli , accompanied by the pre @-@ dreadnought battleship Turgut Reis . They were spotted at dawn from a kite balloon as they were getting into position . When the first 15 @-@ inch ( 380 mm ) round from the dreadnought Queen Elizabeth landed close by , Yavuz moved out of firing position , close to the cliffs , where Queen Elizabeth could not engage her . On 30 April Yavuz tried again , but was spotted from the pre @-@ dreadnought Lord Nelson which had moved into the Dardanelles to bombard the Turkish headquarters at Çanakkale . The British ship only managed to fire five rounds before Yavuz moved out of her line of sight . 
 On 1 May , Yavuz sailed to the Bay of <unk> in the Bosphorus after the Russian fleet bombarded the fortifications at the mouth of the Bosphorus . Around 7 May , Yavuz sortied from the Bosphorus in search of Russian ships as far as Sevastopol , but found none . Running short on main gun ammunition , she did not bombard Sevastopol . While returning on the morning of 10 May , Yavuz 's lookouts spotted two Russian pre @-@ dreadnoughts , Tri Sviatitelia and Panteleimon , and she opened fire . Within the first 10 minutes she had been hit twice , although she was not seriously damaged . Admiral Souchon disengaged and headed for the Bosphorus , pursued by Russian light forces . Later that month two of the ship 's 15 cm guns were taken ashore for use there , and the four 8 @.@ 8 cm guns in the aft superstructure were removed at the same time . Four 8 @.@ 8 cm anti @-@ aircraft were installed on the aft superstructure by the end of 1915 . 
 On 18 July , Midilli struck a mine ; the ship took on some 600 long tons ( 610 t ) of water and was no longer able to escort coal convoys from Zonguldak to the Bosphorus . Yavuz was assigned to the task , and on 10 August she escorted a convoy of five coal transports , along with Hamidiye and three torpedo boats . During transit , the convoy was attacked by the Russian submarine <unk> , which sank one of the colliers . The following day , <unk> and another submarine tried to attack Yavuz as well , though they were unable to reach a firing position . 
 Two Russian destroyers , Bystry and <unk> , attacked a Turkish convoy escorted by Hamidiye and two torpedo boats on 5 September . Hamidiye 's 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) guns broke down during combat , and the Turks summoned Yavuz , but she arrived too late : the Turkish colliers had already been beached to avoid capture by the Russian destroyers . 
 On 21 September , Yavuz Sultan Selim was again sent out of the Bosphorus to drive off three Russian destroyers which had been attacking Turkish coal ships . Escort missions continued until 14 November , when the submarine <unk> nearly hit Yavuz with two torpedoes just outside the Bosphorus . Admiral Souchon decided the risk to the battlecruiser was too great , and suspended the convoy system . In its stead , only those ships fast enough to make the journey from Zonguldak to Constantinople in a single night were permitted ; outside the Bosphorus they would be met by torpedo boats to defend them against the lurking submarines . By the end of the summer , the completion of two new Russian dreadnought battleships , Imperatritsa Mariya and Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya , further curtailed Yavuz 's activities .

 Admiral Souchon sent Yavuz to Zonguldak on 8 January to protect an approaching empty collier from Russian destroyers in the area , but the Russians sank the transport ship before Yavuz arrived . On the return trip to the Bosphorus , Yavuz encountered Imperatritsa Ekaterina . The two ships engaged in a brief artillery duel , beginning at a range of 18 @,@ 500 meters . Yavuz turned to the southwest , and in the first four minutes of the engagement , fired five salvos from her main guns . Neither ship scored any hits , though shell splinters from near misses struck Yavuz . Though nominally much faster than Imperatritsa Ekaterina , the Turkish battlecruiser 's bottom was badly fouled and her propeller shafts were in poor condition . This made it difficult for Yavuz to escape from the powerful Russian battleship , which was reported to have reached 23 @.@ 5 kn ( 43 @.@ 5 km / h ; 27 @.@ 0 mph ) . 
 Russian forces were making significant gains into Ottoman territory during the Caucasus Campaign . In an attempt to prevent further advances by the Russian army , Yavuz rushed 429 officers and men , a mountain artillery battery , machine gun and aviation units , 1 @,@ 000 rifles , and 300 cases of munitions to Trebizond on 4 February . On 4 March , the Russian navy landed a detachment of some 2 @,@ 100 men , along with mountain guns and horses , on either side of the port of Atina . The Turks were caught by surprise and forced to evacuate . Another landing took place at <unk> Bay , some 5 miles east of Trebizond , in June . In late June , the Turks counterattacked and penetrated around 20 miles into the Russian lines . Yavuz and Midilli conducted a series of coastal operations to support the Turkish attacks . On 4 July , Yavuz shelled the port of Tuapse , where she sank a steamer and a motor schooner . The Turkish ships sailed northward to circle back behind the Russians before the two Russian dreadnoughts left Sevastopol to try to attack them . They then returned to the Bosphorus , where Yavuz was docked for repairs to her propeller shafts until September . 
 The coal shortage continued to worsen until Admiral Souchon was forced to suspend operations by Yavuz and Midilli through 1917 . After an armistice between Russia and the Ottoman Empire was signed in December 1917 following the Bolshevik revolution , formalized in the Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk in March 1918 , coal started to arrive again from eastern Turkey . 
 = = = = = 1918 = = = = = 
 On 20 January 1918 , Yavuz and Midilli left the Dardanelles under the command of Vice Admiral Rebeur @-@ Paschwitz , who had replaced Souchon the previous September . Rebeur @-@ Paschwitz 's intention was to draw Allied naval forces away from Palestine in support of Turkish forces there . Outside the straits , in the course of what became known as the Battle of Imbros , Yavuz surprised and sank the monitors Raglan and M28 which were at anchor and unsupported by the pre @-@ dreadnoughts that should have been guarding them . Rebeur @-@ Paschwitz then decided to proceed to the port of Mudros ; there the British pre @-@ dreadnought battleship Agamemnon was raising steam to attack the Turkish ships . While en route , Midilli struck several mines and sank ; Yavuz hit three mines as well . Retreating to the Dardanelles and followed by the British destroyers HMS Lizard and Tigress , she was intentionally beached near Nagara Point just outside the Dardanelles . The British attacked Yavuz with bombers from No. 2 Wing of the Royal Naval Air Service while she was grounded and hit her twice , but the bombs from the light aircraft were not heavy enough to do any serious damage . The monitor M17 attempted to shell Yavuz on the evening of 24 January , but only managed to fire 10 rounds before withdrawing to escape the Turkish artillery fire . The submarine E14 was sent to destroy the damaged ship , but was too late ; the old ex @-@ German pre @-@ dreadnought Turgut Reis had towed Yavuz off and returned her to the safety of Constantinople . Yavuz was crippled by the extensive damage ; cofferdams were again built around the hull , and repairs lasted from 7 August to 19 October . 
 Yavuz escorted the members of the Ottoman Armistice Commission to Odessa on 30 March 1918 , after the Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk was signed . After returning to Constantinople she sailed in May to Sevastopol where she had her hull cleaned and some leaks repaired . Yavuz and several destroyers sailed for Novorossiysk on 28 June to intern the remaining Soviet warships , but they had already been scuttled when the Turkish ships arrived . The destroyers remained , but Yavuz returned to Sevastopol . On 14 July the ship was laid up for the rest of the war . While in Sevastopol , dockyard workers scraped fouling from the ship 's bottom . Yavuz subsequently returned to Constantinople , where from 7 August to 19 October a concrete cofferdam was installed to repair one of the three areas damaged by mines . 
 The German navy formally transferred ownership of the vessel to the Turkish government on 2 November . According to the terms of the Treaty of Sèvres between the Ottoman Empire and the Western Allies , Yavuz was to have been handed over to the Royal Navy as war reparations . After the Turkish War of Independence , led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk , the Treaty of Sèvres was discarded , and the Treaty of Lausanne was signed in its place in 1923 . Under this treaty , the new Turkish republic regained possession of much its fleet , including Yavuz . 
 = = = Post @-@ war service = = = 
 During the 1920s , a commitment to refurbish Yavuz as the centerpiece of the new country 's fleet was the only constant element of the various naval policies which were put forward . The battlecruiser remained in İzmit until 1926 , in a neglected state : only two of her boilers worked , she could not steer or steam , and she still had two unrepaired scars from the mine damage in 1918 . Enough money was raised to allow the purchase of a new 26 @,@ 000 @-@ metric @-@ ton ( 26 @,@ 000 @-@ long @-@ ton ) floating dock from Germany , as Yavuz could not be towed anywhere without risk of her sinking in rough seas . The French company Atelier et Chantiers de St. Nazaire @-@ <unk> was contracted in December 1926 to oversee the subsequent refit , which was carried out by the Gölcük Naval Shipyard . Work proceeded over three years ( 1927 – 1930 ) ; it was delayed when several compartments of the dock collapsed while being pumped out . Yavuz was slightly damaged before she could be refloated and the dock had to be repaired before the repair work could begin . The Minister of Marine , Ihsan Bey ( <unk> <unk> ) , was convicted of embezzlement in the resulting investigation . Other delays were caused by fraud charges which resulted in the abolition of the Ministry of Marine . The Turkish Military 's Chief of Staff , Marshal Fevzi , opposed naval construction and slowed down all naval building programs following the fraud charges . Intensive work on the battlecruiser only began after the Greek Navy conducted a large @-@ scale naval exercise off Turkey in September 1928 and the Turkish Government perceived a need to counter Greece 's naval superiority . The Turks also ordered four destroyers and two submarines from Italian shipyards . The Greek Government proposed a 10 @-@ year " holiday " from naval building modeled on the Washington Treaty when it learned that Yavuz was to be brought back into service , though it reserved the right to build two new cruisers . The Turkish Government rejected this proposal , and claimed that the ship was intended to counter the growing strength of the Soviet Navy in the Black Sea . 
 Over the course of the refit , the mine damage was repaired , her displacement was increased to 23 @,@ 100 t ( 22 @,@ 700 long tons ) , and the hull was slightly reworked . She was reduced in length by a half meter but her beam increased by 10 cm ( 4 in ) . Yavuz was equipped with new boilers and a French fire control system for her main battery guns . Two of the 15 cm guns were removed from their casemate positions . Her armor protection was not upgraded to take the lessons of the Battle of Jutland into account , and she had only 2 inches ( 5 @.@ 1 cm ) of armor above her magazines . Yavuz was recommissioned in 1930 , resuming her role as flagship of the Turkish Navy , and performed better than expected in her speed trials ; her subsequent gunnery and fire control trials were also successful . The four destroyers , which were needed to protect the battlecruiser , entered service between 1931 and 1932 ; their performance never met the design specifications . In response to Yavuz 's return to service , the Soviet Union transferred the battleship Parizhskaya Kommuna and light cruiser Profintern from the Baltic in late 1929 to ensure that the Black Sea Fleet retained parity with the Turkish Navy . The Greek Government also responded by ordering two destroyers . 
 In 1933 , she took Prime Minister İsmet İnönü from Varna to Istanbul and carried the Shah of Iran from Trebizond to Samsun the following year . Yavuz Sultan Selim had her name officially shortened to Yavuz Sultan in 1930 and then to Yavuz in 1936 . Another short refit was conducted in 1938 , and in November that year she carried the remains of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk from Istanbul to İzmit . She and the other ships of the navy were considered outdated by the British Naval Attache by 1937 , partly due to their substandard anti @-@ aircraft armament , but in 1938 the Turkish government began planning to expand the force . Under these plans the surface fleet was to comprise two 10 @,@ 000 ton cruisers and twelve destroyers . Yavuz would be retained until the second cruiser was commissioned in 1945 , and the navy expected to build a 23 @,@ 000 ton ship between 1950 and 1960 . The naval building program did not come about , as the foreign shipyards which were to build the ships concentrated on the needs of their own nations leading up to World War II . 
 Yavuz remained in service throughout World War II . In November 1939 she and Parizhskaya Kommuna were the only capital ships in the Black Sea region , and Life magazine reported that Yavuz was superior to the Soviet ship because the latter was in poor condition . In 1941 , her anti @-@ aircraft battery was strengthened to four 88 mm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) guns , ten 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) guns , and four 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) guns . These were later increased to twenty @-@ two 40 mm guns and twenty @-@ four 20 mm guns . On 5 April 1946 , the American battleship USS Missouri , light cruiser Providence , and destroyer Power arrived in Istanbul to return the remains of Turkish ambassador <unk> Ertegün . Yavuz greeted the ships in the Bosphorus , where she and Missouri exchanged 19 @-@ gun salutes . 
 After 1948 , the ship was stationed in either İzmit or Gölcük . She was decommissioned from active service on 20 December 1950 and stricken from the Navy register on 14 November 1954 . When Turkey joined NATO in 1952 , the ship was assigned the hull number B70 . The Turkish government offered to sell the ship to the West German government in 1963 as a museum ship , but the offer was declined . Turkey sold the ship to <unk> <unk> in 1971 for scrapping . She was towed to the breakers on 7 June 1973 , and the work was completed in February 1976 . By the time of her disposal she was the last dreadnought in existence outside the United States .

 Thriller is a viral video featuring the CPDRC Dancing Inmates of a high @-@ security penitentiary . In 2007 , the inmates of Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center ( CPDRC ) , a maximum security prison in Cebu , the Philippines , imitated the zombie dance featured in the music video of Michael Jackson 's " Thriller " . The footage , uploaded onto video @-@ sharing website YouTube , became a viral video . The idea behind the dance came from the prison 's chief , Byron F. Garcia . Garcia first conceived the idea of exercising as an enjoyable way of keeping the prisoners mentally and physically fit . Music was then added to provide additional motivation . The convicts marched and danced to several songs , including " In the Navy " and " Y.M.C.A. " by the Village People . 
 Garcia posted the prisoners ' dance regimes onto the internet in April 2007 . The most popular of the presentations was their Thriller performance . The video showed over 1 @,@ 500 male inmates emulating Michael Jackson 's dance moves from the original Thriller short film . Jackson fan Crisanto Nierre played the role of the pop star , with the openly gay former pizza chef <unk> Resane playing his girlfriend . The video became one of the most viewed on the internet , receiving 300 @,@ 000 views per day at its peak . As of December 27 , 2014 , the Thriller viral video has received over 54 million reported views .

The prison and its officers faced allegations of prisoner abuse , claims which both the officers and inmates denied . 
 The prisoners have performed numerous other songs , including " Radio Ga Ga " , " Together in Electric Dreams " , " Holding Out for a Hero " , and several songs from Sister Act . One of their performances involves the inmates holding portraits of figures such as the Dalai Lama , Pope John Paul II and Mahatma Gandhi . As a result of the prisoners ' internet fame , many visitors come to CPDRC to view the monthly performances held by the convicts . Their presentations are seen from viewing platforms surrounding the exercise yard . At the jail , visitors can have their pictures taken with the inmates . They can also buy souvenir prison shirts .

 I hope that all the people who see us will be happy in knowing that we , despite being prisoners , we were able to do this . Before the dancing , our problems were really heavy to bear . Dancing takes our minds away from our problems . Our bodies became more healthy . As for the judges , they may be impressed with us , seeing that we are being rehabilitated and this could help our case . We are being rehabilitated in a good way .

 Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center is a maximum security prison in Cebu , in the Cebu Province of the Philippines . The center is run by Byron F. Garcia , and its inmates are either facing trial or are serving sentences for crimes ranging from shoplifting to murder and rape . In 2007 , more than 300 of the inmates were facing murder charges . Garcia initiated the idea of exercising as an enjoyable way of keeping the prisoners mentally and physically fit . " While the goal is to keep the body fit in order to keep the mind fit , such may not happen if it is done in a manner deemed <unk> " , Garcia said . Considering music to be " the language of the soul " , Garcia added it to the prisoner 's workout regime . Garcia also wanted the music workouts to be a way in which to break down gang factions amongst prison inmates . Melita Thomeczeck , the Philippine 's deputy consulate general in New York , suspected that the warden added the music in order to take detainee 's minds off of other matters . One of the first songs the prisoners worked with was Pink Floyd 's " Another Brick in the Wall " . Garcia had them march to the music as a bid to increase participation in exercise . Other early musical choices included " In the Navy " and " Y.M.C.A. " by the Village People . The Village People songs were chosen so that macho inmates " wouldn 't be offended by being asked to dance " . 
 For Filipinos , music and dancing is said to be a way of life . Natives of the Philippines are reported to have a tendency to " sing and dance their way out of even the most complicated situations " . Thomeczeck stated , " The Filipinos love music and they love to sing and dance . Whatever they are in a natural way , they can continue that habit in prison . " Despite other colleagues ' enthusiasm about the dancing , chief administrator Patrick Rubio of the Directorate of Operations within the Bureau of Jail Management and <unk> was worried about the volume of inmates dancing , as CPDRC was undermanned . Despite inmate dancing not being prohibited by the center 's Operations Manual , Rubio thought of the dance as a disaster waiting to happen . " As a jail officer , I got worried when I saw it " , Rubio commented . The inmates were not fond of the idea either , pelting a visiting choreographer with slippers the first time he arrived at the prison . Prisoners eventually agreed to dance , but admitted that the routines took awhile to master . " It was difficult at first , but eventually we inmates got used to it " , inmate Mario Benito revealed . The program began as an experiment and , after six months , prison chiefs concluded that it was a successful one .

 In 2007 , Garcia posted several videos of his inmates ' performances on YouTube in hopes of inspiring other prisons to learn from the experience . The clips became some of the most talked about in cyberspace . The most popular of the videos was uploaded in April 2007 . It showed over 1 @,@ 500 male inmates imitating the zombie dance featured in the music video of Michael Jackson 's " Thriller " . The prisoners wore their orange jail @-@ issue jumpsuits during the performance in the jail 's exercise yard . The Los Angeles Times later commented that the dance moves were not lifted directly from the video , " but they are performed with such precision it somehow seems that they must have been " . Inmate Crisanto Nierre played the role of Michael Jackson . Nierre , who at the time was awaiting trial on drug charges , has been a fan of Jackson since he was in a dance troupe at high school . USA Today noted that his favorite Jackson tracks were " Bad " and " Smooth Criminal " . Former pizza chef <unk> Resane , who is gay , played the part of Jackson 's girlfriend . At the time , Resane had already been at the prison for three years , also awaiting trial on drug charges . 
 Forty @-@ eight hours after being uploaded onto YouTube , the video had been viewed 266 @,@ 000 times . After a week , the number of hits had risen to over one million . Within two weeks of the Thriller video being uploaded , it had been viewed by some three million YouTube users . The following week , the number had almost doubled , coming close to six million hits . On average , the clip received 300 @,@ 000 views per day at its peak . The video generated mixed reviews , with some critics claiming that Garcia forced the inmates to perform , an accusation the prisoners refuted . Several of the inmates showed devotion towards their prison chief , with as many as 20 prisoners bearing tattoos with Garcia 's name . Garcia 's concept of having prisoners dance as part of a rehabilitation program has been copied by several prisons , including jails in Quezon province and <unk> . Garcia commented that the movie showed that dancing is not a cruel or unusual punishment . He claimed that his prison showed that negative inmates could be turned into positive individuals , through the concept of a " revolutionized <unk> " . Following Garcia 's presentation of an inmate performance at the province 's Founding Day celebrations , a donation of $ 35 @,@ 000 was given to the prison . Each inmate received $ 22 of the gift , deposited into a prison passbook account . The remaining money went to the Cebu province and its employees , to defray the costs of incarceration . 
 The prison inmates Thriller performance made it to the pages of Time — on the international magazine ’ s list of the most watchable Internet videos for 2007 . The inmates ' interpretation of the Thriller music video was ranked the fifth of 10 " most popular viral videos " of the year , or the " Web clips we couldn ’ t stop watching " . The list also included appearances by Hillary Clinton , Will Ferrell and Chris Crocker for his Leave Britney Alone ! clip . Time described the convicts as " orange @-@ <unk> accused murderers , rapists and drug dealers " , and noted that their performance was made in " homage " to Jackson 's Thriller . The magazine stated that the viral video had been downloaded more than nine million times . ( As of January 18 , 2008 , the reported views of the video have reached almost 15 million ) . 
 Edward Latessa , professor and head of division of criminal justice at the University of Cincinnati , declared that the prisoners who are dancing are not being rehabilitated . Latessa stated that the prisoners may think that they are getting something out of the performances , when , in reality , they are not . He described it as having a potentially harmful effect . The professor insisted that more appropriate rehabilitation programs , like substance abuse or family reunification programs , should be implemented with as much coordination and vigor . The detention workers disagreed with the assessment , deeming the activities to be an integral part of rehabilitation . " It combines the need for physical exercise and their love to sing and dance " , Thomeczeck argued . " In more ways than one , it contributes to their rehabilitation and eventual reintegration . It 's a way to put themselves together physically and probably spiritually . That 's good , isn 't it ? " . Entertainment Weekly put it on its end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ decade , " best @-@ of " list , saying , " Now that 's a ' breakout ' hit : The clip of inmates at a high @-@ security prison in the Philippines performing an intricately choreographed dance to Michael Jackson 's " Thriller " has nabbed more than 42 million views since 2007 .

 In late 2007 , Pinoy Big Brother : Celebrity Edition 2 scheduled a visit from some of its celebrities to the provincial jail . The celebrities danced with 1 @,@ 600 CPDRC inmates to the tune of " Rico Mambo " as part of their weekly task , set by Big Brother . The request had been made by Maria Rowena Benitez , Pinoy Big Brother production manager . The housemates were not informed of their task , but were brought to the prison in blindfolds . They were then subsequently given back their sight , with the inmates surrounding them . Beforehand , it was also announced that the Big Brother celebrity housemates would perform a concert , with the proceeds being donated to CPDRC . The concert , held inside the Pinoy Big Brother house in Manila , was attended by 100 people , who each paid <unk> . 
 The CPDRC inmates have performed numerous other songs , including Queen 's " Radio Ga Ga " and several songs from Sister Act , with prisoners dressing as nuns in habits . 44 female inmates , held in a separate wing from the males , joined the men in a dance to " I Will Follow Him " . " Hail Holy Queen " , from Sister Act 2 , and the Algorithm March were also performed by the convicts and then upload onto YouTube . The inmates dance in order to help pass the time while serving their prison sentences or awaiting a trial . More than 900 of the inmates take part in the routines , with a small group of dancers at the core of each performance . Every prisoner at CPDRC , apart from the old and the infirm , has a part in the routine . Garcia directs and <unk> each of the dances . The inmates ' participation is said to be completely voluntary , with no prisoner being forced to dance . " It would be different if they are being forced to dance " , declared Rubio . " I 've never known any prisoners being forced to dance . It 's normal to dance . " The inmates have express pride at their performing success , and routinely query the viewing figures for their routines . By August 2007 , ten of the prisoners ' performances had been viewed over 100 @,@ 000 times each . In 2007 , the prisoners stated that they were to perform to Vanilla Ice 's " Ice Ice Baby " . At the time , they were also practicing Philip Oakey and Giorgio Moroder 's " Together in Electric Dreams " , a homage to the inmates ' fans . 
 In January 2008 , Garcia requested that the prisoners perform their Thriller routine at the annual Sinulog festival , a popular street @-@ music festival organised by the Catholic Augustinian in celebration of baby Jesus . The nine @-@ day fiesta and party is preceded by a solemn religious procession . The mayor of Cebu , Tomas <unk> , refused to permit the request , stating that the inmates could dance all they wanted in jail . " I will not allow it even if Michael Jackson joins them " , he commented . Garcia had hoped that , by allowing the inmates to be a part of the Sinulog celebrations , Cebu would showcase the success of his rehabilitation programme . " By showing these highly disciplined inmates , perhaps we might just be giving hope that Cebu is not just about the <unk> gras , but rather , Cebu is about leadership and good governance . " The CPDRC inmates were expected to be tough competition for the <unk> <unk> , a group which has won the free interpretation category of the Sinulog festival for two consecutive years . 
 As a result of the prisoners ' internet fame , many visitors come to CPDRC to view the monthly performances held by the convicts . Their presentations are seen from viewing platforms surrounding the exercise yard . At the jail , visitors can have their pictures taken with the inmates . They can also buy souvenir prison shirts . A research student from The Netherlands , Anne Yzerman , attended one of the two @-@ hour shows and praised the convicts . " They are so good at dancing all the time . I was really impressed . " The CPDRC inmates dance numbers include a rendition of Bonnie Tyler 's " Holding Out for a Hero " . The performance involves the inmates holding portraits of figures such as the Dalai Lama , Pope John Paul II and Mahatma Gandhi . After Michael Jackson 's death on June 25 , 2009 , Cebu prison officials announced that the prison inmates would be recreating the Thriller routine on the following Saturday , June 27 , 2009 . On June 27 , 2009 , the tribute video was uploaded with a dance routine for " Ben " , " I 'll Be There " , and " We Are the World " . 
 In January 2010 , the prisoners performed " The Drill " and " They Don 't Care About Us " [ filmed on professional camera ] as another tribute to Jackson , and for the release of the Michael Jackson 's This Is It DVD and Blu @-@ ray disc . 
 In 2011 , in the Glee episode " The Sue Sylvester Shuffle " , Glee club director Will Schuester made a reference about the " Thriller " viral video to motivate the children to do a " Thriller " performance much like from the Philippine prison .

 A casket containing the body of a deceased construction worker , Rafeeq ( <unk> ) , is flown from Dubai to the Calicut International Airport in Kozhikode , then transported by ambulance to its destination . While en route , the ambulance is ambushed by criminals hired by Muhammed Unni ( Siddique ) to retrieve the 100 kilograms ( 220 lb ) of gold that he and his co @-@ smugglers have hidden in the casket . When they open the casket , they discover the gold is missing . 
 Around the same time , Jayanthi ( Andrea Jeremiah ) arrives in Kozhikode from Mumbai in search of her missing husband , Ramesh ( Ashvin A. Mathew ) , an Indian Revenue Service officer who frequently disappeared from home for various reasons , but is now a suspect in the gold smuggling . Jayanthi arranged for a taxi to drive her to various locations in her quest to find Ramesh . The taxi driver Raju ( Mohanlal ) appears to have an interest of his own in the circumstances surrounding Ramesh 's disappearance . At Jayanthi 's bidding , Raju drives her to the home of her mother @-@ in @-@ law ( <unk> Lalitha ) where he cooks for them and interacts in such a way to earn their trust . Jayanthi then asks Raju to drive her to Kochi to the office of her friend , Chandrasekharan ( <unk> ) , assistant commissioner of police . Chandrasekharan promises Jayanthi he will investigate the disappearance of Ramesh . After leaving Chandrasekharan 's office , Raju drives Jayanthi to see <unk> 's wife , Advocate Rekha ( <unk> ) , who is also her friend . During their chat , Jayanthi receives a surprise phone call from Ramesh . He explains that he is in Kovalam for an official meeting but will return home the next day , and insists that Jayanthi return home as well . Chandrasekhar later informs Jayanthi that the phone number Ramesh called from was actually in Kochi , not Kovalam . It is also revealed that Sudheer is involved in the smuggling operation . 
 Meanwhile , Unni , Babu , Shaji , Shenoy , and MLA meet atop an apartment building to discuss the circumstances surrounding the gold they smuggled into Kozhikode and lost to an ambush while in transit from the airport . They suspect Ramesh is involved since he disappeared right after the incident . They devise a plan to kidnap Jayanthi in order to force Ramesh to return the gold . An unsuspecting Raju and Jayanthi become the targets of their surprise attack in which Jayanthi is rendered unconscious . Raju draws his concealed handgun and foils the kidnapping by shooting at his assailants . He collects the unconscious Jayanthi and transports her to a safe place . When she awakens , she finds herself surrounded by strangers . She also discovers that Raju is not just a taxi driver rather he is part of an investigation to find Ramesh and the missing gold . Raju explains to her that Ramesh was involved in the smuggling , and has since become the target of the criminals . Jayanthi returns to Rekha 's home for safety , and Chandrasekharan begins investigating Raju who , in a turn of events , has raised suspicion . 
 Raju and his team , now disguised as Sabarimala pilgrims , rent a van hoping to catch Jayan .

 In 2013 , Ranjith announced plans to produce a film for Aashirvad Cinemas , starring Mohanlal and Manju Warrier , which was scheduled for a 2014 release coinciding with the annual <unk> festival held in Kerala , India . Production was slated to begin in December 2013 . The announcement of Loham received considerable media attention as it was Manju Warrier 's return to the screen after leaving the film industry to marry actor Dileep . The media coverage was further heightened when Prithviraj Sukumaran joined the cast . However , the film was shelved soon after its official announcement . Ranjith explained it was dropped because the film 's story resembled that of another film in the same language released during its pre @-@ production time . It was Prithviraj who noticed that the ending sequence of the planned script was similar to that of <unk> ( 2013 ) . 
 Later that year , the director planned another film with the same production company starring Mohanlal , which was titled G for Gold . Filming was scheduled to begin on 10 January 2014 in Kozhikode and <unk> , but production did not begin on schedule due to Ranjith 's dissatisfaction with the screenplay . He revised the screenplay and re @-@ titled the film as Loham . Loham was announced in February 2015 .

She appeared in a cameo role . Maaney 's scenes were filmed in three days . Salim grew a beard and shaved his head for his role . He said , " My getup in the movie is similar to that of Dwayne Johnson " . 
 Kunjunni S. Kumar , son of cinematographer S. Kumar , was hired as Loham 's cinematographer . Kunjunni had first worked with Ranjith as an associate director during the production of Indian Rupee ( 2011 ) while his father worked behind the camera . Earlier , he was supposed to debut as a cinematographer on Ranjith 's Leela in 2012 , but the project was shelved ten days before production . In an interview with the Deccan Chronicle , Kunjunni said that after the script narration , Ranjith told him to avoid gimmicks in framing and shots in order to make it more realistic . Mythili , who was cast by Ranjith in her debut film , acted in and served as an assistant director for the film which was her debut behind the camera . She also sang a duet song in the film 's soundtrack . Sreevalsan J. Menon was selected by Ranjith to compose the film 's original music score .

 Loham received mixed reviews from critics . <unk> <unk> of Kerala Kaumudi said , " <unk> has beautifully conceived the film " , and praised the technical aspects with special mention to Kunjunni 's camera work and the three " beautiful " songs composed by Sreevalsan . He summarized it as " a watchable good film that could have been much better if the director paid a little more attention to the screenplay . The problem is that it loses steam here and there particularly in the post @-@ interval sequences " . Deccan Chronicle rated the film 2 @.@ 5 out of 5 and said , " Any of [ Mohanlal 's ] fans , who are exposed to thrillers of Hollywood and Bollywood like Ocean 's 11 and Special 26 will lose the thrill soon . There is nothing commendable about the script or cinematography or music " , but he praised Mohanlal 's action sequences and car chasing scenes , Siddique and his companion 's performances , and Mythili and <unk> 's " heart touching " moments . He called the message of the film " socially relevant " and " effective " . <unk> Menon of <unk> also gave the film 2 @.@ 5 out of 5 stars . He praised the performances of Mohanlal and Siddique , but was less enthusiastic about the script , observing that " Ranjith 's craft as a filmmaker is visible throughout the movie . But what Loham lacks is his brilliance as a writer " . 
 Pramod Thomas of The New Indian Express commented , " <unk> has been in an experimental mode of late . Unfortunately , movies like Loham are many laps behind . . . . When <unk> directors decide to live in the shadow of their past glory , films like Loham happen " . Veeyen of <unk> gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and wrote " Loham has none of the shine or shimmer that was expected of it .

Sify praised the performance of Mohanlal and the humour of Siddique and <unk> <unk> but criticized the script , saying , " Loham is about a topical subject , but it is far from engaging " . Raj Vikram of <unk> said that technically the film is slick with well shot sequences . " Mohanlal is the lifeblood of the movie , and he pulls off an easy role by his standards with characteristic panache . . . Loham is not among the best works of director <unk> but is far better than some of his forgettable duds . " 
 = Post Oak Mall = 
 Post Oak Mall is a regional shopping mall in College Station , Texas owned by CBL & Associates Properties . Construction on the mall began in summer 1979 and it opened February 17 , 1982 . It initially housed 80 stores with four anchors . A second phase , planned before the mall even opened , was completed in 1985 , adding more floor space and bringing the mall up to 125 stores and 6 anchor stores . As of 2015 , it also houses a small food court and two restaurants . 
 The first mall to be opened in College Station , Post Oak is the largest mall within the Brazos Valley area . At its opening , it became the city 's largest employer , and nearly doubled its city sales tax revenues . Though the mall generated additional traffic and added to the demand on city services , it also generated $ 1 million in annual sales tax revenue , $ 120 @,@ 000 in property taxes , and a half @-@ million in taxes for the city school district . It is credited with creating the first major impetus for growing economic and commercial developments for College Station , which previously lacked a major retail community . The mall generates over 75 percent of the area 's retail sales through its approximately eleven million annual visitors . It remains the city 's largest taxpayer and its second largest employer . It is also the top employer of the students of nearby Texas A & M University .

 = = = Beginnings = = = 
 In the early 1980s , the demand for shopping opportunities and other businesses was growing with the populations of the side @-@ by @-@ side cities of Bryan and College Station . The city and developer CBL & Associates Properties began making plans for the opening of a large regional mall in the area , with the first choice of location being in Bryan near the intersection of Earl Rudder Freeway ( Texas State Highway 6 ) and <unk> Drive ( FM 1179 ) . However , the owner of the land refused to sell . With the city unable to procure the land , the mall project was shifted to College Station . Construction began on Post Oak Mall in the summer of 1979 at the intersection of Earl Rudder Freeway and Harvey Road . Developer CBL & Associates Properties hired Eugene " Buck " <unk> to act as the project manager . More than 1 @,@ 000 workers were employed to help construct the mall , with the project " monopolizing the local ( construction ) trade " at the time . 
 Post Oak Mall opened its doors on February 17 , 1982 . Spanning 800 @,@ 000 square feet ( 74 @,@ 000 m2 ) , the first phase of the mall contained approximately 80 stores , including four anchors : the area 's first Foley 's and Dillard 's department stores ; Sears , which relocated from its smaller Bryan location ; and H. J. Wilson Co . In addition to the stores , the mall contained a three – screen Plitt @-@ branded movie theater and a food court with fifteen small restaurants and a 300 @-@ person seating area . The mall walkways were decorated with a variety of small potted trees and plants in large atrium areas , with tiered glass ceilings above . A copper @-@ piping fountain that emitted water in a " dandelion bubble " dominated one end of the building . Plans were already underway for a second phase of construction that would expand the mall to hold up to 130 stores and push it up to 1 @,@ 020 @,@ 000 square feet ( 95 @,@ 000 m2 ) . 
 At the time of its opening , it was the largest mall complex developed by CBL . In the first year , it was projected that the mall would employee 2 @,@ 500 employees — instantly making it the largest employer in the city ; this was expected to expand to 3 @,@ 500 with the completion of the second phase . It was hoped it would generate $ 80 million in sales . In addition to helping to retain local shoppers who might otherwise travel the 2 ½ hours southeast to Houston for mall shopping , CBL and city officials expected the mall would draw shoppers from around the Brazos Valley . Before its opening , the city did not have a highly developed retail community . With the planned additions , then College Station city manager North <unk> said it was expected to generate $ 1 million in annual sales tax revenue , nearly equal to what the city collected in the previous fiscal year from all other sales . It would bring in another $ 120 @,@ 000 in property taxes , a half @-@ million in taxes for College Station Independent School District , and $ 1 million in electric bills . The increase in jobs was seen as good for the community , and the city hoped it would attract new civic groups to the area . Taking a year longer than originally planned , the expansion was completed in 1985 . 
 The mall also added new burdens to city services , with building inspectors having to work overtime to inspect each store area as it was completed . While mall security was issued citation books so they could issue parking tickets directly , the city police still had to work double shifts to cover the traffic during the mall 's opening weekend . Overall , the mall increased traffic on the Earl Rudder Freeway , and city traffic engineers noted it would cause more traffic backup . Traffic signals were added to the mall 's main entrance , while long @-@ term plans were made to both expand the freeway and add additional interchanges along Harvey . Traffic studies were implemented to study the traffic after the mall 's opening to developed additional plans to mitigate issues . There were concerns that the mall would be the final blow to the downtown area of neighboring city Bryan , Texas , which was already suffering reduced business after the opening of smaller Manor East Mall and the <unk> shopping center , both within Bryan . Bryan city officials noted an immediate decrease in revenue due to Sears moving from Bryan to College Station , taking $ 50 – 100 @,@ 000 of sales taxes with it . However , as a whole the city was hopeful that the mall would have benefits to the city in the form of increased city growth as a whole . The city planners felt it would only be a passing fad for local rural and lower @-@ income families , who would still return to downtown Bryan due to its proximity . 
 = = = Renovations = = = 
 On February 1 , 2004 , a short in an electrical box sparked a small fire at the Journey 's shoe store . The sprinklers helped contain the flames , but eight stores and six kiosks in the area of the store suffered from smoke damage , as well as water damage after water from the sprinklers flowed out of the store and into the middle of the mall walkway . The affected stores had to be closed for two days while repairs were made . 
 In 2006 , Anuncio Digital Media , a locally started digital advertising firm , installed its first mall @-@ based digital signage network , which consists of a series of twenty plasma screen televisions around the main concourse and in the food court that display six @-@ second sound @-@ free advertisements . Post Oak Mall was the first of four CBL @-@ owned malls to receive this network , with four other CBL malls scheduled to follow . The advertising displays were activated on September 1 , 2006 . 
 David Gwin , the economic development director for College Station , is working with the mall on a possible $ 8 @.@ 5 million renovation project to give the mall a further boost . As of 2008 , details about what the renovations would entail have not been released . In February 2009 , the city noted that plans had been designed to renovate both the interior and exterior of the mall . 
 On January 19 , 2012 , CBL Properties announced , among others , that Post Oak Mall would receive major renovations sometime during 2012 . In CBL 's press release , they announced that " The renovation at Post Oak Mall will involve modern updates including new flooring and paint as well as all new amenities such as soft seating areas and décor , updated entrances , and lighting . In addition , the food courts at Cross Creek Mall , Turtle Creek Mall and Post Oak Mall will receive completely new designs , including new tables and chairs . " Renovations were completed in November 2012 with a grand reopening held the weekend of November 9 , 2012 . 
 = = Stores = = 
 While the bulk of Post Oak Mall 's 125 stores are clothing and accessory shops , as of 2009 it is home to several hair salons and cosmetic stores , two video game stores , two optical shops , a Dallas Cowboys Pro Shop , a store featuring Texas A & M merchandise ( Aggieland Outfitters ) , and a pet store that primarily sells puppies imported from Canada . In addition to six food vendors in the central food court , the mall houses full @-@ size Casa Olé and Chuck E. Cheese 's restaurants , and kiosk versions of Auntie Anne 's and <unk> ' Dots . There is a small indoor children 's play area located in the food court , a night club , and recruitment centers for the United States Air Force , Army , Navy , and Marines . 
 When it opened , the mall contained a three @-@ screen movie theater owned by Cineplex Odeon , which was later bought out the Plitt chain . The Post Oak Mall theater location was eventually sold to Carmike Cinemas before closing for good by 1999 . The empty space was replaced with a full @-@ service restaurant and an entertainment section . 
 = = = Anchors = = = 
 The first four anchor stores in the mall were Sears , Dillard 's , Wilson 's , and Foley 's . <unk> , became the fifth anchor when it opened a second location in Post Oak a few weeks after the mall 's opening . The sixth anchor was added in 1985 , when J.C. Penney moved into the newly expanded mall from its Bryan Manor East Mall location . In 1985 , the H.J. Wilson Company , owner of Wilson 's , was taken over by Service Merchandise . After Service Merchandise went bankrupt in 1999 , the Wilson 's location closed and the empty anchor location became a second Dillard 's location , housing their specialty Mens & <unk> store . Both Dillard 's locations , Foley 's , J.C. Penney , and Sears were all independently owned , separate from mall ownership , and considered " stand @-@ alone " buildings for tax purposes . 
 After May Department Stores , the parent company of Foley 's , merged with Federated Department Stores , the Foley 's location was temporarily closed while it was converted to a Macy 's department store . The new Macy 's officially opened on September 9 , 2006 . With the opening of its 30 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 2 @,@ 800 m2 ) location on August 5 , 2005 , Steve & Barry 's became the mall 's only anchor store to have no exterior exit . In September 2008 , after Steve & Barry 's declared bankruptcy , the Post Oak store was closed as part of the parent 's company attempt to save its business , but it went out of business altogether less than three months later .

 Post Oak Mall 's food court contains seven food stall vendors . In addition to the more " traditional " mall offerings , including a Raising Cane 's location , a burger place , an Asian restaurant , and a pizza stall , the food court houses the locally operated Taste of the Tropics , a maker of pure fruit smoothies , and a Nestlé Toll House Café . The stalls arranged around half of a semi @-@ round area , with seating and the children 's playground in the center , retail stores along the other half , and openings to the mall concourse on both ends . 
 A McDonald 's was located in the mall for fifteen years , but left in 2002 as part of regional owner Ron <unk> 's overall renovation plans . It was quickly replaced by the Brazos Valley seventh Sonic Drive @-@ In location , the only in the area with neither a drive @-@ in nor drive through option . The Sonic closed in late 2012 . 
 = = Economic impact = = 
 Post Oak Mall was the first mall in the city of College Station , and as of 2008 , it is the largest mall in the Brazos Valley . There were concerns that the mall would hurt existing area businesses , but CBL was certain the mall would have a " trickle @-@ down " effect that would result in the Harvey Road area to be " fully developed with smaller strip shopping centers . " Before the mall opened , plans were already underway for one such center , Post Oak Village , which began constructed to the west of the mall along Harvey Road . Farther west , zoning was approved for new office complexes and commercial developments . Immediately south of the mall , an additional commercial zone was approved , along with 36 acres ( 15 ha ) along the freeway . 
 The mall 's opening helped create the impetus for growing economic and commercial developments for College Station . Before its opening , the city did not have a highly developed retail community . It is now the largest taxpayer in College Station , and the second largest in the Brazos Valley , even though the anchor stores are freestanding units that are privately owned and taxed separate from the mall proper . Over 75 percent of retail sales in the Brazos Valley coming from sales at the mall 's stores and it continues to be one if the area 's largest employers as well as being the largest employer for Texas A & M students . As predicted , the Harvey Road / Earl Rudder Freeway intersection became a major entry point into College Station , with Harvey Road now boasting a long stretch of retail businesses and restaurants . It is considered an " area of bustling activity " by the city . According to Joan Ghani , the marketing director of the mall , the mall sees eleven million visitors walk through its door annually . While the large college population from Texas A & M University boosts the mall 's revenue , the average mall shopper is in their 30s and come from both within the Brazos County and the twelve surrounding counties . 
 = Suillus lakei = 
 Suillus lakei , commonly known as the matte Jack , Lake 's bolete , or the western painted Suillus , is a species of fungus in the Suillaceae family . It is characterized by the distinctive reddish @-@ brown tufted fibers or small scales on the cap , and the presence of a woolly veil on the stem . The caps can reach diameters of up to 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) , while the stems are between 6 to 12 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 to 4 @.@ 7 in ) long and usually 1 – 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick . On the underside of the cap is a layer of spongy yellow to yellow @-@ brown angular pores ; these pores are covered with a whitish partial veil when young . A mycorrhizal fungus , S. lakei grows in association with Douglas fir , and can be found where this tree occurs . It is native to northwestern North America , but has been introduced to Europe , South America , and New Zealand . The mushroom is edible , but opinions vary considerably as to its quality . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill originally named the species Boletinus lakei after mycologist E.R. Lake of Oregon Agricultural college ( now Oregon State University ) . Lake collected the type specimen from Corvallis , Oregon , in late November , 1907 . Rolf Singer later transferred the species to the genera Ixocomus and Boletinus in 1940 and 1945 , respectively . In their 1964 monograph on North American Suillus species , Alexander H. Smith and Harry Delbert Thiers transferred the species to Suillus . Simultaneously , they described the S. lakei variety <unk> that they said had been misidentified by collectors as Suillus pictus ( now called Suillus spraguei ) because of its reddish and scaly cap . Singer considered Suillus amabilis to be the same species as S. lakei , but Smith and Thiers later examined the type material of both , and concluded that they were distinct species . Engel and colleagues described a variety in 1996 , S. lakei var. <unk> , based on Boletinus <unk> subsp. <unk> described by Czech mycologists Albert Pilát and Mirko <unk> in 1949 . The nomenclatural databases Index Fungorum and MycoBank consider this synonymous with S. lakei . The mushroom is commonly known as the " western painted Suillus " , the " matte Jack " , or " Lake 's slippery cap " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap of S. lakei is up to 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) in diameter and initially convex , but flattens out somewhat in maturity . The cap is fleshy , dry , yellowish to reddish @-@ brown but fades with age . It is covered with pressed @-@ down hairs or minute tufted scales in the center , with the yellowish flesh visible between the scales . Heavy rain can wash the fibrils off the cap surface , leaving a sticky , glutinous layer behind . Older specimens may be nearly smooth in age . Remnants of the partial veil sometimes hang from the edge of the cap . The cap margin is initially curved or rolled inwards , but unrolls as it grows and in maturity may be curled upward . 
 The tubes that comprise the pore surface on the underside of the cap are 5 – 12 mm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 5 in ) deep ; the angular pores are up to 2 @.@ 5 mm wide and radially arranged . The pores range in color from yellow to brownish @-@ yellow to ochre , and stain brownish or reddish @-@ brown when bruised . They are covered by a partial veil in young specimens . The flesh is thick , yellow , and either unchanged in color when bruised or broken , or turns pinkish @-@ red . The stem is 6 to 12 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 to 4 @.@ 7 in ) long and usually 1 – 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick , yellow sometimes with reddish streaks , and solid and yellow within . The species usually lacks the glandular dots on the stem that are characteristic of some Suillus species . The stem is either equal in width throughout its length , or tapered downwards . The tissue of the stem base may weakly stain bluish @-@ green when cut , although this reaction is not usually apparent in mature specimens . The ring is delicate and floccose ( resembling woolly tufts ) , and soon disappears or leaves a thin whitish ring on the stem . The spore print is cinnamon to brown in color . The variety <unk> , found in Italy , has a light yellow cap and purple @-@ red scales . Variety <unk> has a cap that is redder and more scaly than the more common form . 
 The spores are spindle @-@ shaped to elliptical , have a smooth surface , and dimensions of 8 – 11 to 3 – 4 µm . There are both two- and four @-@ spored basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) , and they are club @-@ shaped , hyaline ( translucent ) , with dimensions of 28 – 36 by 10 – 12 µm . Cystidia are plentiful , and are found in bundles lined along the tube mouths ( as cheilocystidia ) , or more commonly , singly along the sides of the tubes ( as pleurocystidia ) . These structures are thin @-@ walled , cylindrical , and measure 48 – 60 by 7 – 9 µm . The scales on the cap surface comprise more or less erect hyphae with tips that are clustered together . Clamp connections are rare in the hyphae . 
 = = = Edibility = = = 
 Suillus lakei is edible , although opinions vary considerably as to its quality . It has been called " choice " , as well as " rather coarse and tasteless " or " mediocre " . Laboratory tests indicate the fruit bodies to have antimicrobial activity , and contain alkaloids and tannins . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Mushrooms with an appearance similar to S. lakei can often be distinguished by their associations with trees . For example , the eastern North American species S. spraguei grows in association with Eastern White Pine . The cap of S. spraguei has red fibrils on a yellow background . S. <unk> and S. <unk> always grow with Larch . S. <unk> , which grows in mixed coniferous forests , has a gelatinous veil . Smith and Thiers note that it is difficult to tell the difference between the two if S. <unk> has lost its veil , since the colors of the species intergrade and cannot reliably be used to distinguish them . S. decipiens has a cap that is orangish to pink @-@ orange with hairs or scales . S. caerulescens is a similar species in western North America ; it can be distinguished by the strong blue staining that develops when the stem is injured . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Suillus lakei is indigenous to the Rocky Mountains and western parts of North America . Its range extends south into Mexico . Fruit bodies grow solitarily or in groups on the ground in young conifer stands or grassy parkland . Fruiting occurs in the late summer and autumn . Suillus lakei forms ectomycorrhizae with Douglas fir ( Pseudotsuga menziesii ) , and its distribution coincides with this tree . It is one of the most common bolete species found in northwestern Montana and Idaho . In a study of host specificity in pure culture in the laboratory , S. lakei failed to form healthy ectomycorrhizas with Eucalyptus roots — the hyphae were covered in mucilage @-@ like deposits and appeared to be collapsed . It has also been noted to prefer poor , exposed soil such as that found on road banks and campgrounds . It can often be found with the mushroom Gomphidius <unk> , another species that associates with Douglas fir . 
 Both Douglas fir and Suillus lakei are non @-@ native introduced species in Europe . The fungus has been found in several central and south European countries following the intentional introduction of Douglas fir . These include Bosnia and Herzegovina , Bulgaria , Czech Republic , Germany , Hungary , Italy , and Slovakia . It is considered endangered in the Czech Republic . Suillus lakei has also been reported in the South Island of New Zealand , and South America ( Argentina and Chile ) .

 Having already made their name producing solid @-@ state pre- / <unk> amplifier separates , Naim launched a low @-@ powered integrated amplifier that embodies the qualities of its amplifiers , aimed at cost @-@ conscious audiophiles . 
 Since the NAIT was launched in 1983 , it has been re @-@ imagined six times in all . In 2007 , Naim added a high end product , the SUPERNAIT , to their integrated amplifier offering . As of 2008 , the NAIT brand is a three @-@ amplifier range consisting of the entry @-@ level NAIT 5si the mid @-@ range NAIT XS 2 , and the flagship SUPERNAIT 2 . 
 = = History = = 
 Up to that point a manufacturer of solid @-@ state pre- / <unk> amplifier separates , Naim Audio wanted an entry @-@ level integrated amplifier to complement their range and widen their appeal . They worked to create a low @-@ powered model that shared the family characteristics and sound . The approach , seemingly against the received wisdom of the time that power and sound quality go hand in hand , remained nevertheless controversial , despite the fact that NAD Electronics had trail @-@ blazed five years earlier with the top @-@ selling low @-@ cost audiophile amplifier , the NAD 3020 . The Naim Audio Integrated amplifier ( or NAIT ) was created by Julian Vereker as a minimalist black shoe @-@ box design that includes a phono and two line @-@ level inputs – one for tuner and one for tape recorder . The phono input , for moving magnet cartridges , is derived from the NAC 32 pre @-@ amplifier . The NAIT was launched in 1983 , ten years after the firm was founded . 
 In terms of styling , the NAIT , priced in the UK at £ 253 , was housed in a small black aluminium " chrome bumper " case shared by other " half @-@ size " Naim components at the time . On the left side of the front panel , a plastic volume knob is adjacent to a small @-@ diameter rotating <unk> that controls the balance . Then follows a bank of three press @-@ button selector switches – for each of phono , tuner , tape – then a power on – off button . On the right side is a light @-@ emitting diode ( LED ) indicating activity status . Sam Tellig of Stereophile said that the NAIT was " a profoundly anarchistic , almost subversive product " . 
 The first " chrome bumper " version was followed by a second , then two Olive incarnations ( including the NAIT 3 ) , and three NAIT 5 versions . All bear the Naim Audio logo , but none have any markings or other indication of their model numbers on the fascia . 
 Between 1983 and 2007 , Naim had only one integrated amplifier available , although the product has seen several guises . Naim extended the range with the SUPERNAIT in 2007 , and the XS barely a year later . In 2013 , the NAIT range consists of the entry @-@ level NAIT 5si and the top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ range SUPERNAIT 2 , with the XS 2 slotting in the middle . Some of the models provide an upgrade path for their equipment by allowing the simple insertion of an external power supply unit . 
 = = = Design and power = = = 
 Insistent on the unimportance of specifications in general , Naim never published technical specifications for this low @-@ powered design . Trade speculation of its power output ranged from 5 to 15 watts per channel . Naim confirmed years later that the NAIT is rated at 13 watts . Part of its mystique seemed to stem from its low power : in developing the successor to the NAIT , Naim founder Julian Vereker remarked that R & D " cooked up a more powerful version and presented it to me on my return [ from holiday but ] it sounded awful . " 
 In its product manual , the NAIT is said to have " low continuous power output ... balanced by a very large peak current capacity so there are no restrictions on the size or type of loudspeaker that may be used . But please don 't expect the impossible " . Hi @-@ Fi Journal wrote that " the NAIT excelled in musical terms ... and would comfortably drive loudspeakers that caused other amplifiers to sound lumpen and distinctly unmusical " . And for that reason , many people who owned the Quad Electrostatic Loudspeaker ( ESL ) – which are known to be a very difficult load for amplifiers – would choose the NAIT to drive their speakers . Reviewers attribute the perception of power of the NAITs to the over @-@ engineered , dedicated power supplies that ensure generous current delivery for musical transients . 
 As part of the 5 @-@ series redesign , mechanical and electronic changes introduced in the NAIT 5i ( italic ' i ' ) include attention to wiring , control of internal heat dissipation , radio @-@ frequency interference and mechanical vibration through more efficient materials , compliant mounting and decoupling . The SUPERNAIT benefits from a fully active line @-@ level preamp developed for the NAC 552 pre @-@ amplifier , and its output section is derived largely from the NAP 200 power amplifier . 
 In launching the 2013 NAIT range , Steve Sells , electronic design manager of Naim , explained how the new NAITs fulfilled the goal of delivering sound quality performance . They are stripped of superfluous components and features , and as such , the digital – analogue converter ( DAC ) previously available on the SUPERNAIT has not found its way into its successor . The transformer is deliberately positioned as far away as possible from the inputs to avoid electromagnetic interference , while the power supply and its capacitors are closer to both the transformer and the output devices . Non @-@ audio circuitry for controlling the amplifiers are optically isolated from signal sections , and are designed to power down when not in use , to avoid interference . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 While reviewers criticised the styling of early NAITs of having a distinctly <unk> feel , Ian White observed that the typical Naim product is " meticulously laid out , clean , and well put together " . Housed in the same small , black " half @-@ size " aluminium cases used by Naim pre @-@ amplifiers and power supplies , the electronic components are of high quality and discrete – with few or no integrated circuits , mounted on a single , printed circuit board . For many years , Holden & Fisher supplied custom @-@ made toroidal transformers used in the amplifiers . The ones used in NAIT were rated 100 VA , but these have been progressively up @-@ rated over the years , with consequent increases in power output : the entry @-@ level NAIT 5si has a powerful 300 VA transformer for the delivery of 60 W of rated output . 
 While Naim 's practice of using DIN connectors has been regarded by some reviewers as quirky or arrogant , DIN sockets continue to be Naim 's choice for line @-@ level inputs . From standard DIN sockets used in the " half @-@ size " NAITs , Naim upgraded to higher @-@ quality locking DIN sockets on the NAIT 3 . However , models since the NAIT 5i include a number of hard @-@ wired parallel inputs using RCA sockets . As the NAIT was conceived as an entry @-@ level offering , the RCA connector – undoubtedly more popular with mass @-@ market equipment – was offered in place of the BNC for the phono source . In all 2013 models , RCA inputs double the DIN counterparts . Banana plugs , the absence of tone controls , the tendency to harshness when cold are family traits inherited by the NAIT . 
 " NAIT 1 " to NAIT 3 have hard @-@ wired mains cables . Since NAIT 3 , the on – off switch has been located on the back of the amplifier – given that units are meant to be permanently switched on ; since NAIT 5 , power is delivered through a detachable mains cable via an IEC connector fixed to the back panel . Consequently , the front panel looks more minimalistic . 
 The 2013 range of Naim equipment has aluminium chassis and sleeves ; the fascia is die @-@ cast zinc . Inside , circuit boards float , and the rear @-@ mounted mains switch and IEC socket are decoupled to reduce <unk> . <unk> noted that the XS , launched in late 2008 , is the first Naim device to use a new bayonet PCB @-@ mounting technique to float the circuitry .

 Strong and polarised opinions about Naim amplifiers led to the NAIT being called " one of the most controversial and famous integrated amps in the history of HiFi " by Lucio Cadeddu . This controversy has been as much to do with the company 's refusal to follow the fashion of " audiophile @-@ approved values " – such as power ratings and holographic soundstage – as its idiosyncratic preference for connectors other than RCA connectors and its eschewing of tone controls . The volume control always sits on the wrong ( left ) side of the facia . However , the trade noted that the unique sound of the NAIT caused it to become " an instant classic " upon release . As one of the most recognisable pieces of hi @-@ fi , the NAIT has acquired an iconic and legendary status among integrated amplifiers ; Hi @-@ fi World said : " If there was ever a quintessentially British affordable audiophile amplifier , the Naim NAIT is it . "

 There are two major variants of the NAIT , and apparently several minor variants with different motherboards . The simplest and most notable distinction between older and later models is the LED on the fascia : the red LED on the earlier NAIT became a green one on the later model . The balance control unusually only attenuated the left channel by up to − 3 dB ; the lack of obvious markings to indicate a central position was criticised for being " slightly confusing " . 
 Tellig was ambivalent about the NAIT 1 in Stereophile : noting that it was " a good @-@ sounding little amp " , he criticised it for " look [ ing ] very cheaply made , inside and out " , and for its lack of features , particularly the absence of an ' aux ' or ' CD ' input , tone controls , or moving coil input . 
 = = = NAIT 2 ( 1988 ) = = = 
 The " chrome bumper " NAIT 2 was designed to be factory @-@ modified to work as a preamp @-@ only unit . The upgrade path is assured by partnering with Naim 's own stereo power amplifiers – in particular , the NAP 90 and NAP 140 , both of whose in @-@ built power supplies can power their own pre @-@ amplifiers . 
 = = = NAIT 3 ( 1993 ) = = = 
 The NAIT 3 is derived from the NAC 92 preamplifier and the NAP 90 / 3 power amplifier with which it was launched – it is basically the NAC 92 and NAP 90 / 3 in one box . Its flat slimline Olive case with rounded edges measures 17 by 12 by 2 @.@ 2 inches ( 432 mm × 305 mm × 56 mm ) . The NAIT 3 , costing £ 500 at its launch , has five line inputs . 
 A remote control version , identified by the ' NAIT 3R ' designation , was released in 1995 . The NAIT 3 can be upgraded to ' R ' specification by adding a separate remote control board . Ian White said its construction , fit and finish and performance / cost ratio made it a price @-@ point leader . 
 = = = NAIT 5 ( 2000 ) = = = 
 The NAIT 5 was successor to the ' 3' . It is housed in the same low @-@ vibration black die @-@ cast alloy casing employed in the ' 5 Series ' , and measures 17 @.@ 2 by 12 by 2 @.@ 3 inches ( 43 @.@ 7 cm × 30 @.@ 5 cm × 5 @.@ 8 cm ) . and employs surface @-@ mount technology . Like its brethren , attention is paid to protecting the circuit boards from vibration . The remote control function of the NAIT 5 is a new feature to the NAIT , and allows volume and the balance adjustment .

 The NAIT is henceforth a range extended across its three series – the entry @-@ level ' i Series ' , XS , and Classic series . The three units all share a styling , but the height of the case increases for the higher models . 
 The 50 @-@ watt NAIT 5i replaces the 30 @-@ watt NAIT 5 . The phono input has been banished , so owners of turntables would need to plug a head amp ( phono pre @-@ amplifier ) into one of the line inputs . Styling is similar to its predecessor , with basic black with green fluorescent highlights . However , it has fewer selector buttons on the right side of the face @-@ plate . When the SUPERNAIT was launched in 2007 , the 5i was upgraded to the " italic specification " NAIT 5i . 
 The NAIT 5i ( italic ' i ' ) has an additional <unk> jack for portable devices on the front panel , reviewers noted sonic improvements " from the first track " ; it is demonstrably better at handling higher sound pressure levels than the ' 5i ' . 
 NAIT XS : Reviewers have described the XS as a " SUPERNAIT in the slimmer casework of the Series S " . It also has a <unk> stereo input with auto @-@ switching on the front @-@ panel , suitable for an MP3 player . A powered input , provided for turntable users , is designed to supply one of Naim 's external phono pre @-@ amplifiers . The unity gain option and AV bypass function allow it to be used in conjunction with an AV processor in a home cinema system . It also includes optional RS @-@ 232 interface for custom installations . 
 The SUPERNAIT , released in 2007 , incorporates two coaxial and three optical inputs , including a combination mini @-@ jack / mini @-@ <unk> connector with auto @-@ switching on the front panel connectivity for digital sources that facilitate direct connection of computers , media servers and the like . Its circuitry is supposedly identical to that of the XS , but has a 24 @-@ bit DAC that can be called from any of five S / PDIF inputs . It has more features , a more well @-@ endowed power supply allowing delivery of 80 watts ' music , and can bi @-@ amp suitable speakers by adding a secondary power amplifier .

 To mark the 40th anniversary of Naim Audio and the 30th birthday of the original NAIT , Naim unveiled a new 3 @-@ product range under the NAIT brand : the NAIT 5si , NAIT XS 2 and SUPERNAIT 2 . The range has seen a general uprating of the transformer compared with the versions they replaced , allowing for better power delivery . The manufacturer claims use of better components in critical areas and new circuitry . All three models have built @-@ in headphone amplifiers . The digital – analogue converter has been removed as being available either as a separate unit , or as part of the <unk> . 
 The NAIT 5si is the entry @-@ level NAIT and the direct replacement of the NAIT 5i ( with italic ' i ' ) ; the NAIT XS 2 is positioned as the mid @-@ range product . The SUPERNAIT 2 , the flagship integrated amplifier in the Naim stable individually decoupled inputs and no digital circuitry . Both incorporate a headphone output via a class @-@ A headphone amplifier . 
 = = Reception = = 
 In Stereophile , Sam Tellig , who was unimpressed with the poor value for money of the NAIT , said the NAIT 2 " sounds insanely great " and that there was " [ no ] better @-@ sounding integrated amp at the price " . He remarked that and the NAIT 2 resembled his Krell <unk> @-@ 7B / KSA @-@ 80 combination sonically , but lacked " <unk> , kick , balls in the bass " . Although his colleague Robert Harley disliked the NAIT 2 for its styling , connectors , price , and poor performance on paper , he found it to be the most musically satisfying of several amplifiers in his test . 
 Reviewers of NAIT rarely fail to mention their characteristic <unk> ( pace , rhythm , and timing ) sound of Naim . Channa <unk> , wrote comparing the NAIT , NAIT 2 , NAIT 3 and NAIT 5 in the October 2007 edition of Hi @-@ fi World : 
 ... the original NAIT had the best musical timing with precision tempos . The NAIT 2 had the most tuneful bass with a much quieter musical background in comparison to the NAIT . The NAIT 3 had clearer sound overall than all the others , and opened out the music superbly by being the most free flowing . The NAIT 5i was easily the most refined , yet was more immediate too . It proved superb with the tonal qualities of instruments , and added a dash of sweetness to higher frequencies also . 
 David Price , writing in Hi @-@ fi News , said that with the earlier NAITs gave the impression of " something overly reminiscent of British hi @-@ fi 's ' cottage industry ' past " , but remarked that the NAIT 5 made " all other <unk> sound positively pedestrian " . Ian White said the NAIT 5 " sounds like a NAIT 3 that finally finished going through puberty and emerged as a mature adult " , and What Hi @-@ fi ? referred to the NAIT 5 as " one of the finest amplifiers available this side of 1000 pounds " ; In The Absolute Sound , Wayne Garcia noted that the " staggeringly good sound and wonderful value " of the NAIT 5i contributed significantly to raising Naim 's profile in the US audio market . Matthew Masters remarked about the 5i amp and CD player that " it didn 't seem to matter how complex or demanding the music was , the <unk> would sort out the elements then present them in a perfectly @-@ timed and coherent musical picture that helped me understand – and feel – precisely what the performers were on about " . Commenting on the NAIT XS , Malcolm Stewart wrote that the NAITs were " a musically communicative , minimalist design " . Confirming Naim 's upgrade philosophy – the belief and objective that incremental improvements to their equipment can be gained with improving the quality of the power source , Martin Colloms of Hi @-@ fi Critic concluded about adding an external power supply to the top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ range <unk> : 
 ... simply transformed the sound quality , immediately bringing a substantial and obvious improvement . <unk> @-@ with @-@ Hi @-@ Cap has greater poise and dynamic range , is better at getting feet tapping , has less ' character ' , a bigger soundstage , and the bass is <unk> with less ' thump ' . 
 = Witold Pilecki = 
 Witold Pilecki ( 13 May 1901 – 25 May 1948 ; Polish pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ͡ skʲi ] ; codenames Roman <unk> , Tomasz <unk> , <unk> , Witold ) was a Polish soldier , a rittmeister of the Polish Cavalry during the Second Polish Republic , the founder of the Secret Polish Army ( Tajna Armia Polska ) resistance group in German @-@ occupied Poland in November 1939 , and a member of the underground Home Army ( Armia Krajowa ) , which was formed in February 1942 . He was the author of Witold 's Report , the first comprehensive Allied intelligence report on Auschwitz concentration camp and the Holocaust . 
 During World War II , he volunteered for a Polish resistance operation to get imprisoned in the Auschwitz death camp in order to gather intelligence and escape . While in the camp , Pilecki organized a resistance movement and as early as 1941 , informed the Western Allies of Nazi Germany 's Auschwitz atrocities . He escaped from the camp in 1943 after nearly two and a half years of imprisonment . Pilecki took part in the Warsaw Uprising in August 1944 . He remained loyal to the London @-@ based Polish government @-@ in @-@ exile after the Soviet @-@ backed communist takeover of Poland and was arrested in 1947 by the Stalinist secret police ( Urząd Bezpieczeństwa ) on charges of working for " foreign imperialism " , thought to be a euphemism for MI6 . He was executed after a show trial in 1948 . Until 1989 , information about his exploits and fate was suppressed by the Polish communist regime . 
 As a result of his deeds , he is considered as " one of the greatest wartime heroes " . In the foreword to the book The Auschwitz Volunteer : Beyond Bravery Michael <unk> , the Chief Rabbi of Poland , wrote as follows : " When God created the human being , God had in mind that we should all be like Captain Witold Pilecki , of blessed memory . " In the introduction to that book Norman Davies , a British historian , wrote : " If there was an Allied hero who deserved to be remembered and celebrated , this was a person with few peers . " At the commemoration event of International Holocaust Remembrance Day held in the US Holocaust Memorial Museum on 27 January 2013 Ryszard <unk> , the Polish Ambassador to the US , described Pilecki as a " diamond among Poland 's heroes " and " the highest example of Polish patriotism " . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Pilecki was born in <unk> , Karelia , where his family had been forcibly resettled by Imperial Russian authorities after the suppression of Poland 's January Uprising of 1863 – 64 . His grandfather , Józef Pilecki , had spent seven years in exile in Siberia for his part in the rising . In 1910 , Pilecki moved with his family to Wilno ( Vilnius , Lithuania ) , where he completed Commercial School and joined the secret ZHP Scouts organization . In 1916 , he moved to Orel , Russia , where he founded a local ZHP group . 
 During World War I , in 1918 , Pilecki joined a ZHP Scout section of the Polish self @-@ defense units under General Władysław <unk> in the Wilno area . When his sector of the front was overrun by the Bolsheviks , his unit for a time conducted partisan warfare behind enemy lines . Pilecki then joined the regular Polish Army and took part in the Polish @-@ Soviet War of 1919 – 1920 , serving under Capt. Jerzy Dąbrowski . He fought in the Polish retreat from Kiev as part of a cavalry unit defending Grodno ( in present @-@ day Belarus ) . On 5 August 1920 , he joined the 211th Uhlan Regiment and fought in the crucial Battle of Warsaw and at <unk> Forest ( <unk> <unk> ) and took part in the liberation of Wilno . He was twice awarded the <unk> <unk> ( Cross of Valor ) for gallantry . 
 After the Polish @-@ Soviet War ended in 1921 with the Peace of Riga , Pilecki passed his high @-@ school graduation exams ( matura ) in Wilno and passed the exams for a non @-@ commissioned officer position in the Polish Army . He also studied at the Stefan Batory University in Wilno and rebuilt his family estate , ruined during the war . He then took officer training courses . He was assigned to a cavalry regiment in 1926 as ensign , or the second lieutenant of the reserves . While in the reserves , he actively supported local paramilitary training activities . In the interbellum , he worked on his family 's farm in the village of <unk> and was known as a social work activist and an amateur painter . On 7 April 1931 , he married Maria <unk> ( 1906 – 6 February 2002 ) , née Ostrowska . They had two children , born in Wilno : Andrzej ( 16 January 1932 ) and Zofia ( 14 March 1933 ) . In 1938 , he received the Silver Cross of Merit for his involvement in the community and social work . 
 = = World War II = = 
 Shortly before the outbreak of World War II , on 26 August 1939 , Pilecki was mobilized as a cavalry platoon commander . He was assigned to the 19th Infantry Division under Józef <unk> , part of the Polish Army <unk> . His unit took part in heavy fighting against the advancing Germans during the invasion of Poland and was partially destroyed . Pilecki 's platoon withdrew to the southeast , toward Lwów ( now L 'viv , in Ukraine ) and the Romanian bridgehead , and was incorporated into the recently formed 41st Infantry Division , in which he served as divisional second @-@ in @-@ command under Major Jan <unk> . Pilecki and his men destroyed seven German tanks , shot down one aircraft , and destroyed two more on the ground . On 17 September , the Soviet Union invaded eastern Poland pursuant to the Molotov @-@ Ribbentrop Pact . Involved in more heavy fighting on two fronts , Pilecki 's division was disbanded by 22 September , parts of it surrendering to their enemies . Pilecki returned to Warsaw with his commander , Major <unk> . 
 On 9 November 1939 , the two men founded the Secret Polish Army ( Tajna Armia Polska , TAP ) , one of the first underground organizations in Poland . Pilecki became organizational commander of TAP as it expanded to cover not only Warsaw , but Siedlce , Radom , Lublin , and other major cities of central Poland . By 1940 , TAP had approximately 8 @,@ 000 men ( more than half of them armed ) , some 20 machine guns and several anti @-@ tank rifles . Later , the organization was incorporated into the Union for Armed Struggle ( Związek Walki Zbrojnej ) , later renamed and better known as the Home Army ( Armia Krajowa , or AK ) . Within the AK , TAP elements became the core of the <unk> unit . 
 = = = Auschwitz = = = 
 In 1940 , Pilecki presented to his superiors a plan to enter Germany 's Auschwitz concentration camp at Oświęcim ( the Polish name of the locality ) , gather intelligence on the camp from the inside and organize inmate resistance . Until then , little had been known about how the Germans ran the camp , and it was thought to be an internment camp or large prison rather than a death camp . His superiors approved the plan and provided him with a false identity card in the name of " Tomasz <unk> " . On 19 September 1940 , he deliberately went out during a Warsaw street roundup ( <unk> ) and was caught by the Germans , along with some 2 @,@ 000 civilians ( among them , Władysław <unk> ) . After two days of detention in the Light Horse Guards Barracks , where prisoners suffered beatings with rubber truncheons , Pilecki was sent to Auschwitz and was assigned inmate number 4859 . 
 At Auschwitz , while working in various <unk> and surviving pneumonia , Pilecki organized an underground Union of Military Organizations ( Związek <unk> <unk> , ZOW ) . Many smaller underground organizations at Auschwitz eventually merged with ZOW . ZOW 's tasks were to improve inmate morale , provide news from outside , distribute extra food and clothing to members , set up intelligence networks and train detachments to take over the camp in the event of a relief attack by the Home Army , arms airdrops or an airborne landing by the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade based in Britain . 
 ZOW provided the Polish underground with invaluable information about the camp . From October 1940 , ZOW sent reports to Warsaw , and beginning in March 1941 , Pilecki 's reports were being forwarded via the Polish resistance to the British government in London . In 1942 , Pilecki 's resistance movement was also broadcasting details on the number of arrivals and deaths in the camp and the inmates ' conditions using a radio transmitter that was built by camp inmates . The secret radio station , built over seven months using smuggled parts , was broadcasting from the camp until the autumn of 1942 , when it was dismantled by Pilecki 's men after concerns that the Germans might discover its location because of " one of our fellow 's big mouth " . 
 These reports were a principal source of intelligence on Auschwitz for the Western Allies . Pilecki hoped that either the Allies would drop arms or troops into the camp or that the Home Army would organize an assault on it from outside . Such plans , however , were all judged impossible to carry out . Meanwhile , the Gestapo redoubled its efforts to ferret out ZOW members , succeeding in killing many of them . Pilecki decided to break out of the camp with the hope of convincing Home Army leaders personally that a rescue attempt was a valid option . When he was assigned to a night shift at a camp bakery outside the fence , he and two comrades overpowered a guard , cut the phone line and escaped on the night of 26 / 27 April 1943 , taking with them documents stolen from the Germans . 
 = = = Outside the camp = = = 
 After several days , Pilecki made contact with Home Army units . On 25 August 1943 , Pilecki reached Warsaw and joined the Home Army 's intelligence department . The Home Army , after losing several operatives in reconnoitering the vicinity of the camp , including the <unk> Stefan <unk> , decided that it lacked sufficient strength to capture the camp without Allied help . Pilecki 's detailed report ( <unk> <unk> – Witold 's Report ) estimated that " By March 1943 the number [ of people gassed on arrival ] reached 1 @.@ 5 million . " . 
 The Home Army decided that it did not have enough force to storm the camp by itself . In 1944 , the Russian army , despite being within attacking distance of the camp , showed no interest in a joint effort with the Home Army and the ZOW to free it . Until he became involved in the Warsaw Uprising , Pilecki remained in charge of coordinated ZOW and AK activities and provided what limited support he was able to offer to ZOW . 
 On 23 February 1944 , Pilecki was promoted to cavalry captain ( rotmistrz ) and joined a secret anti @-@ communist organization , NIE ( in Polish : " NO or <unk> – <unk> " ) , formed as a secret organization within the Home Army with the goal of preparing resistance against a possible Soviet occupation . 
 = = = Warsaw Uprising = = = 
 When the Warsaw Uprising broke out on 1 August 1944 , Pilecki volunteered for the Kedyw 's Chrobry II group and fought in " Mazur " platoon , 1st company " <unk> " of the National Armed Forces . At first , he fought in the northern city center as a simple private , without revealing his actual rank . Later , as many officers fell , he disclosed his true identity and accepted command . His forces held a fortified area called the " Great Bastion of Warsaw " . It was one of the most outlying partisan redoubts and caused considerable difficulties for German supply lines . The bastion held for two weeks in the face of constant attacks by German infantry and armor . On the capitulation of the uprising , Pilecki hid some weapons in a private apartment and went into captivity . He spent the rest of the war in German prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camps at <unk> and Murnau . 
 = = Communist Poland = = 
 On 9 July 1945 , Pilecki was liberated and soon afterwards joined the 2nd Polish Corps , which was stationed in Italy , where he wrote a monograph on Auschwitz . As relations between Poland 's London based wartime government @-@ in @-@ exile and the Soviet @-@ backed Polish Committee of National Liberation worsened , in September 1945 , Pilecki accepted orders from General Władysław Anders , commander of the 2nd Polish Corps to return to Poland under a false identity and gather intelligence to be sent to the government @-@ in @-@ exile . 
 Pilecki returned to Poland in October 1945 , where he proceeded to organize his intelligence network . In early 1946 , the Polish government @-@ in @-@ exile decided that the post @-@ war political situation afforded no hope of Poland 's liberation and ordered the remaining active members of the Polish resistance ( who became known as the cursed soldiers ) to either return to their normal civilian lives or escape to the West . In July 1946 , Pilecki was informed that his cover was blown and ordered to leave ; but he declined . In April 1947 , he began collecting evidence of Soviet atrocities in Poland as well as the arrest and prosecution of former members of the Home Army and Polish Armed Forces in the West , which often resulted in execution or imprisonment . 
 = = = Arrest and execution = = = 
 On 8 May 1947 , he was arrested by the Ministry of Public Security . Prior to trial , he was repeatedly tortured . The investigation of Pilecki 's activities was supervised by Colonel Roman Romkowski . He was interrogated by Col. Józef Różański , and lieutenants S. <unk> , W. <unk> , J. <unk> , T. <unk> , Eugeniusz <unk> and S. <unk> – men who were especially infamous for their savagery . But Pilecki sought to protect other prisoners and revealed no sensitive information . 
 On 3 March 1948 , a show trial took place . Testimony against Pilecki was presented by a future Polish prime minister , Józef Cyrankiewicz , himself an Auschwitz survivor . Pilecki was accused of illegal border crossing , use of forged documents , not enlisting with the military , carrying illegal arms , espionage for General Władysław Anders , espionage for " foreign imperialism " ( thought to be British intelligence ) and planning to assassinate several officials of the Ministry of Public Security of Poland . Pilecki denied the assassination charges , as well as espionage , although he admitted to passing information to the 2nd Polish Corps , of which he considered himself an officer and thus claimed that he was not breaking any laws . He pleaded guilty to the other charges . On 15 May , with three of his comrades , he was sentenced to death . Ten days later , on 25 May 1948 , Pilecki was executed at the Mokotów Prison in Warsaw ( also known as <unk> Prison ) , by Staff Sergeant Piotr <unk> ( who was nicknamed " The Butcher of <unk> Prison " by the inmates ) . 
 During Pilecki 's last conversation with his wife he told her : " I cannot live . They killed me . Because Oświęcim [ Auschwitz ] compared with them was just a trifle . " His final words before his execution were " Long live free Poland " . 
 Pilecki 's place of burial has never been found but is thought to be somewhere within Warsaw 's Powązki Cemetery . After the fall of communism in Poland a symbolic gravestone was erected in his memory at <unk> <unk> Cemetery . In 2012 , Powązki Cemetery was partially excavated in an effort to find Pilecki 's remains . 
 Pilecki 's show trial and execution was part of a wider campaign of repression against former Home Army members and others connected with the Polish Government @-@ in @-@ Exile in London . In 2003 , the prosecutor , Czesław <unk> , and several others involved in the trial were charged with complicity in Pilecki 's murder .

 = Operation Paula = 
 Unternehmen Paula ( Undertaking or Operation Paula ) is the German codename given for the Second World War Luftwaffe offensive operation to destroy the remaining units of the Armée de l 'Air ( ALA ) , or French Air Force during the Battle of France in 1940 . On 10 May the German armed forces ( Wehrmacht ) began its invasion of Western Europe . By 3 June , the British Army had withdrawn from Dunkirk and the continent in Operation Dynamo , the Netherlands and Belgium had surrendered and most of the formations of the French Army were disbanded or destroyed . To complete the defeat of France , the Germans undertook a second phase operation , Fall Rot ( Case Red ) , to conquer the remaining regions . In order to do this , air supremacy was required . The Luftwaffe was ordered to destroy the French Air Forces , while still providing support to the German Army . 
 For the operation , the Germans committed five Air Corps to the attack , comprising 1 @,@ 100 aircraft . The operation was launched on 3 June 1940 . However , British intelligence had warned the French of the impending attack and the ensuing operation failed to achieve the strategic results desired by the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe ( High Command of the Air Force ) . Fortunately for the Luftwaffe , the plight of the French ground and air forces at this stage meant the failure of the operation would not impede the defeat of France . 
 = = Background = = 
 After the declaration of war on Nazi Germany by the United Kingdom and France , in the aftermath of the German invasion of Poland , nine months of stalemate took place along the Western Front named the Phoney War . The only military action was the French Army 's Saar Offensive which was terminated in controversial circumstances . After the Polish Campaign , in October 1939 , the planners of the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe ( Luftwaffe High Command ) and the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht ( Supreme Command of the Armed Forces ) turned their attentions to Western Europe . 
 The Western Allies had surrendered the initiative and the Germans would take the offensive in 1940 . Several plans were toyed with by the German General Staff . General Franz Halder , the chief of staff of the Army , presented the first plan for Fall Gelb ( " Case Yellow " ) on 19 October 1939 . The plan 's German code was <unk> N ° 1 , Fall Gelb , or " Deployment Instruction No. 1 , Case Yellow " . The operation was a limited operation in which Luxembourg and the Low Countries were to be conquered in order to provide a base for further operations against France at a later date and amounted to a less ambitious re @-@ run of the infamous Schlieffen Plan which failed during the First World War in 1914 . It was rejected by Adolf Hitler and at the turn of the year , Heinz Guderian 's chief of staff , Erich von Manstein secured Hitler 's attention with a modified version . An ambitious thrust through the Ardennes was suggested by von Manstein . This main attack would use up the majority of the motorised and tank divisions ( Panzer Divisions ) in a drive to the English Channel . A diversion operation in Belgium and the Netherlands would precede this thrust , to lure the Allied Armies , including the British Expeditionary Force , into a trap . 
 Launched on 10 May 1940 , the revised version of Unternehmen Gelb ( Operation Yellow ) , also known as the Manstein Plan , succeeded . Unfortunately for the Germans , the British Army escaped during the Battle of Dunkirk . Nevertheless , the Belgian Army , Dutch Army and most of the elite French forces were destroyed in the encirclement . This left just second rate French units to combat the entire German Army . The Luftwaffe had played an integral part in disrupting Allied operations in this early phase . The Luftwaffe 's participation was particularly crucial during the Battle of Sedan which enabled the German Army to carry out Operation Yellow . By early June the Dunkirk siege was over , and on 3 June , the Germans began preparations for the conquest of the rest of France under the codename Fall Rot , ( Case Red ) . For this to be as successful , air superiority would be required first , as it had been during Operation Yellow .

 Hugo Sperrle had long planned attacks upon Paris and on 22 May he ordered Fliegerkorps II ( Air Corps II ) and Fliegerkorps V ( Air Corps V ) with Kampfgeschwader 77 ( Bomber Wing 77 ) and Generaloberst ( General Colonel ) Ulrich Grauert 's I Fliegerdivision , III . / Kampfgeschwader 28 ( Bomber Wing 28 ) to bomb Paris . Bad weather had prevented the operation . However , determined to continue with his plans , Sperrle ordered Otto Hoffmann von Waldau and Helmuth von Hoffman , Gruppenkommandeur ( Group Commander ) of III . / KG 28 , to plan out an operation named Paula the following day , on 23 May 1940 . 
 The objectives of the operation was broad in its scope . Among the elimination of French airfields and aircraft factories around Paris , in von Waldau 's words , the bombing was to " achieve a desirable influence on the morale of the capital " . German reconnaissance aircraft reported 1 @,@ 244 aircraft on airfields in and around Paris , including 550 – 650 single engine aircraft . This force of French air power was to be destroyed along with the aviation factories in the area . French anti aircraft artillery ( AAA ) defences were mapped from the tactical to operational level and intelligence of French ground defences was therefore good . The operation was due to be carried out on 30 May , but again , bad weather prevented it . 
 The operation was compromised by poor staff work and excessive confidence in the " invulnerable " Enigma machine . The British intelligence , namely Ultra , who had been reading the German codes , forewarned the French . On 30 May ULTRA intercepted a message sent by Grauert discussing the arrangements he was making for his Corps . Adding to this leak , the units involved received incomplete orders for the assault . Oberst Johann @-@ Volkmar Fisser , Geschwaderkommodore ( Wing Commander ) of KG 77 , was given incomplete orders about the target and complained . He asked the Headquarters of VIII Fliegerkorps only to be told it was " Paris " . Sperrle responded to his request by removing KG 77 from the order of battle . The British intercepted <unk> 's request to VIII Fliegerkorps , who then passed it to the French . The French had intercepted similar messages and in response they doubled their aircraft strength to 120 fighters .

 Units from both Luftflotte 2 and Luftflotte 3 ( Air Fleet 1 and 2 ) were made available for the operation .

All in all , these groups totalled 240 aircraft . Only 120 fighters were made available to counter German attacks . 
 = = The battle = = 
 On 3 June , the French units were warned an hour before the German bombers took off , but owing to equally poor staff work , few French squadrons heard the scramble signal when it was radioed from the Eiffel Tower and some were caught on the ground . In the end , only 80 took off to intercept the incoming German formations . German progress was monitored by shadowing Potez <unk> , one of which was shot down . The Germans would copy this tactic when intercepting United States Army Air Force ( USAAF ) heavy bombers during the Defence of the Reich campaign . Along with French AAA defences , the fighters shot down 10 German aircraft , including four bombers . One of these machines was piloted by Geschwaderkommodore of KG 51 , Josef Kammhuber , who was wounded in action and then taken as a prisoner of war . Kammhuber would be released after the French surrender . He was replaced as Geschwaderkommodore of KG 51 by Fisser , commander of KG 77 . Fisser was killed two months later leading KG 51 during the Battle of Britain , inadvertently saving Kammhuber 's life . Jagdfliegerführer 3 ( Fighter Flying Leader 3 ) Oberst Gerd von <unk> was also shot down . He was replaced by Oberst Werner <unk> , until the former 's release by German forces on 12 June 1940 . German formations attacked 28 railways and marshalling yard centres . All damage inflicted was light . None were out of action for more than 24 hours . 
 Most of the German bombers had passed over and had an altitude advantage over French fighters trying to gain height to intercept . Skirmishes were few and far between , but some French units suffered heavy losses . For the attack , the Germans had used the new C @-@ 250 <unk> ( Flame Bomb ) which had only been cleared for use 24 hours earlier . The incendiary bomb did some damage to hangars and parked aircraft . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Germans believed they had struck a mortal blow against the ALA . German post @-@ operation analysis indicated a resounding success . It suggested a long list of wrecked French factories and destroyed aircraft on the ground and in the air . The Germans claimed to have destroyed 75 French aircraft in the air and 400 on the ground . Such was the perceived success , the Luftwaffe concentrated against ports on the northern French coast thereafter . The damage inflicted by the Luftwaffe was far less than the Germans thought . Only 20 French aircraft ( 16 of them fighters ) were destroyed on the ground and 15 of their fighters were shot down in aerial combat , a loss rate of 19 percent , suggesting German over claiming of over 4 : 1 in the air and 16 : 1 on the ground . Six of the 16 airfields hit reported serious damage , while 15 factories reported slight damage . French casualties on the ground were heavy . French casualties included 254 dead and 652 injured . The French shot down 10 German aircraft , including four bombers . They claimed 16 , suggesting mutual over claiming . A further 21 vehicles were destroyed . All the French airfields were back in operation 48 hours later . 
 Although the operation failed to achieve its goals , the first phase of the German invasion , Operation Yellow , had stripped the French Army of its finest formations . The French forces holding the Somme line were mostly reserve divisions of poorer quality and unsupported by heavy artillery , tanks or motorised infantry . The failure of the German air operation did not prevent the German Army from defeating the French in June 1940 , or the Luftwaffe in gaining air supremacy at the beginning of Fall Rot . The main reason for German superiority in the air was the poor state of French air units ' operational readiness . The Luftwaffe had a smaller margin of numerical superiority over the ALA at the start of Fall Rot as the French aviation industry was starting to reach full potential in production . Some 2 @,@ 000 French aircraft were available despite the loss of 787 aircraft ( 473 fighters , 120 bombers and 194 reconnaissance aircraft ) . The French had 2 @,@ 086 machines available on 5 June 1940 , the first day of Fall Rot . Unfortunately component production did not match the production of airframes . It was slow and poor , and as a result only 599 aircraft ( 340 fighters and 170 bombers ) were serviceable ; a rate of just 29 percent . After the opening of the offensive , the Luftwaffe " ran riot " over French air space . Such was the superiority of the Luftwaffe at that point , some units were sent home to Germany to refit . The French collapsed altogether just 22 days later , and on 25 June France capitulated . 
 = New Labour = 
 New Labour refers to a period in the history of the British Labour Party from the mid @-@ 1990s to the early 2010s , under leaders Tony Blair and Gordon Brown . The name dates from a conference slogan first used by the party in 1994 which was later seen in a draft manifesto published in 1996 , called New Labour , New Life For Britain . It was presented as the brand of a newly reformed party that had altered Clause IV and endorsed market economics . The branding was extensively used while the party was in government , between 1997 and 2010 . New Labour won landslide election victories in 1997 and 2001 , and won again in 2005 . In 2007 , Blair resigned as the party 's leader and was succeeded by Gordon Brown . Labour lost the 2010 general election , which resulted in a hung parliament and led to the creation of a Conservative – Liberal Democrat coalition government ; Gordon Brown resigned as Prime Minister , and as Labour leader shortly thereafter . He was succeeded by Ed Miliband after that year 's leadership election . 
 The " New Labour " brand was developed to regain trust from the electorate and to portray a departure from " Old Labour " , which was criticised for its breaking of election promises and its links between trade unions and the state . The " New Labour " brand was used to communicate the party 's modernisation to the public . It was coordinated by Alastair Campbell , who centralised the party 's communications and used his experience in journalism to achieve positive media relations . In 2002 , following criticism from Philip Gould , Blair announced the need to reinvent the brand based on a unified domestic policy and greater assertion in foreign affairs . Following the leadership of Neil Kinnock and John Smith , the party under the New Labour brand attempted to widen its electoral appeal and , by the 1997 general election , had made significant gains in the upper and middle classes . Labour maintained this wider support in the 2001 and 2005 elections . The brand was retired in 2010 . 
 New Labour has been influenced by the political thinking of Anthony Crosland , the leadership of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown , and Peter Mandelson and Alastair Campbell 's media campaigning . The political philosophy of New Labour was influenced by the party 's development of Anthony Giddens ' " Third Way " , which attempted to provide a synthesis between capitalism and socialism . The party emphasised the importance of social justice , rather than equality , emphasising the need for equality of opportunity , and believed in the use of free markets to deliver economic efficiency and social justice . In 2002 , Giddens named spin as New Labour 's biggest failure , but commended the party 's success in certain policy areas and at marginalising the Conservative Party . 
 = = History = = 
 First elected to parliament as Member of Parliament for Sedgefield , County Durham , at the 1983 general election , Tony Blair became the leader of the Labour Party in 1994 , after winning 57 % of the vote in that year 's leadership election , defeating John Prescott and Margaret Beckett . His first shadow cabinet role came in November 1988 , when Neil Kinnock appointed him as Shadow Secretary of State for Energy , and in July 1992 he was promoted to the role of Shadow Home Secretary on the election of John Smith as Labour Party leader . 
 Gordon Brown , who went on to hold senior positions in Blair 's Labour government before succeeding him as Prime Minister in June 2007 , was not a candidate in the 1994 leadership election because of an agreement between the two made in 1994 , in which Brown promised not to run for election . The media has since speculated that Blair agreed to stand down and allow Brown the premiership in the future , though Blair 's supporters have contended that such a deal never took place . The term ' New Labour ' was coined by Blair in his October 1994 Labour Party Conference speech , as part of the slogan " New Labour , New Britain " . During this speech , Blair announced the modification of Clause IV of the party 's constitution , which abandoned Labour 's attachment to nationalisation and embraced market economics . The new version of the clause committed Labour to a balance of market and public ownership , and to balance creation of wealth with social justice . In 1997 , after 18 years of a Conservative government , New Labour won a landslide victory at the general election , winning a total of 418 seats in the House of Commons — the largest victory in the party 's history . The party was also victorious in 2001 and 2005 , making Blair Labour 's longest @-@ serving Prime Minister , and the first to win three consecutive general elections . Indeed , he was the first Labour leader to win a general election since Harold Wilson in 1974 . 
 In the months following Labour 's 1997 election victory , referendums were held in Scotland and Wales regarding devolution . There was a clear majority supporting devolution in Scotland and a narrower majority in Wales ; Scotland received a stronger degree of devolution than Wales . The Labour government passed laws in 1998 to establish a Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly , the first elections for these were held in 1999 . Blair attempted to continue peace negotiations in Northern Ireland by offering the creation of a regional parliament and government . In 1998 , the Good Friday Agreement was made , which allowed for a 108 @-@ member elected assembly and a power @-@ sharing arrangement between nationalists and unionists . Blair was personally involved in these negotiations . 
 After the US strikes on Afghanistan and Sudan in 1998 , Blair released a statement supporting the actions ; he lent military support to America 's 2001 invasion of Afghanistan . In March 2003 , the Labour government , fearing Saddam Hussein 's supposed access to weapons of mass destruction , participated in the American @-@ led invasion of Iraq . British intervention in Iraq promoted public protest . Crowds numbering 400 @,@ 000 and more demonstrated in October 2002 , and again the following spring . On 15 February 2003 , over 1 million people demonstrated against the war in Iraq , and 60 @,@ 000 marched in Manchester before the Labour Party Conference , with the demonstrators ' issues including British occupation of Afghanistan and the forthcoming invasion of Iraq . 
 In June 2007 , Blair resigned as the leader of the Labour Party and Gordon Brown , previously the Chancellor of the Exchequer , succeeded him after the 2007 party conference . Three years earlier , Blair had announced that he would not be contesting a fourth successive general election as Labour Party leader if he won the 2005 general election . Brown initially had strong public support and plans for a quick general election were widely publicised , though never officially announced . On 18 February 2008 , Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling announced that the failing bank , Northern Rock , would be nationalised , supporting it with loans and guarantees of £ 50 billion . The bank had been destabilised by the US subprime mortgage crisis the previous year , and a private buyer of the bank could not be found . 
 The 2010 general election ended in a hung parliament , in which Labour won 258 seats , 91 fewer than in 2005 . Following failures to achieve a coalition deal with the Liberal Democrats , Gordon Brown announced his intention to resign as the leader of the party on 10 May , and resigned as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom the following day . Shortly thereafter , David Cameron and Nick Clegg announced the formation of a coalition between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats ; David Cameron became the Prime Minister and Nick Clegg the Deputy Prime Minister of a cabinet that contained eighteen Conservative ministers and five Liberal Democrat ministers . In announcing his intention to run for the leadership , David Miliband declared that the New Labour era was over , and following the publication of Tony ' Blair 's memoirs on 1 September 2010 , Ed Miliband said " I think it is time to move on from Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson and to move on from the New Labour establishment and that is the candidate that I am at this election who can best turn the page . I think frankly most members of the public will want us to turn the page . " The leadership election was won by Ed Miliband , who was able to mobilise support from the trade union electorate . In a July 2011 speech , Blair stated that New Labour died when he left office and Gordon Brown assumed the party leadership , claiming that from 2007 , the party " lost the driving rhythm " . 
 = = Political branding = = 
 Once New Labour was established , it was developed as a brand , portrayed as a departure from ' Old Labour ' , the party of pre @-@ 1994 , which had been criticised for regularly betraying its election promises and was linked with trade unionism , the state , and benefit claimants . The previous two party leaders , Neil Kinnock and John Smith , had begun efforts to modernise the party as a strategy for electoral success , before Smith died in 1994 . However , Smith 's approach , which was dubbed ( sometimes pejoratively ) " one more heave " was perceived as too timid by <unk> like Blair , Brown and Mandelson . They felt that his cautious approach , which sought to avoid controversy and win the next election by capitalising on the unpopularity of the Conservative government , was not sufficient . 
 New Labour also used the party 's brand to continue this modernisation , and it was used to communicate the modernisation of the party to the public ; the party also began to use focus groups to test whether their policy ideas were attractive to swing voters . Its purpose was to reassure the public that the party would provide a new kind of governance and mitigate fears that a Labour government would return to the labour unrest that had characterised its past . 
 While the party was in power , press secretary Alastair Campbell installed a centralised organisation to co @-@ ordinate government communication and impose a united message to be delivered by ministers . Charlie Whelan , Gordon Brown 's press officer , was often in conflict with Campbell because of the former 's attempts to brief the press by his own initiatives ; this continued until his resignation in 1999 . Campbell followed a professional approach to media relations to ensure that a clear message was presented , and the party planned stories in advance to ensure a positive media reaction . Campbell used his own experience in journalism ; he was known for his attention to detail and effective use of sound bites . Campbell developed a relationship with News International , providing their newspapers with early information in return for positive media coverage . 
 In 2002 , Philip Gould , a policy advisor to the Labour Party , wrote to the party 's leadership that the brand had become contaminated and an object of criticism and ridicule , undermined by an apparent lack of conviction and integrity . The brand was weakened by internal disputes and the apparent failure to deal with issues . This assessment was supported by Tony Blair , who argued that the government needed to spend more time working on domestic affairs , develop a unifying strategy , and create " eye @-@ catching initiatives " . Blair also announced the need to be more assertive in foreign affairs . 
 = = Electoral support = = 
 Under Neil Kinnock , Labour attempted to widen its electoral support from narrow class divisions . After Blair took the leadership , the party made significant gains in higher social classes and won 39 % support from managers and administrators in the 1997 election , more than in previous elections that the party had lost . Labour won greater support among younger voters than older , but there was no significant gender difference . During the 1980s , much of Labour 's support had retreated into industrial areas of the north ; in 1997 , Labour performed much better in the south of England . 
 In the elections of 2001 and 2005 , Labour maintained much of the middle @-@ class support that it had won in 1997 . In 2005 , Labour 's support was much lower than in the previous two elections , which David Rubinstein has attributed to anger at the war in Iraq and towards Blair himself . 
 Professors Geoffrey Evans , John Curtice and Pippa Norris of Strathclyde University published a paper considering the incidence of tactical voting in the 1997 general election . Their studies showed that tactical voting increased in 1997 ; there was a strong increase in anti @-@ Conservative voting and a decrease in anti @-@ Labour tactical voting . Political commentators Neal Lawson and Joe Cox wrote that tactical voting helped to provide New Labour with its majorities in 1997 , 2001 and 2005 and argued that , the party won because of public opposition to the Conservative Party . The Party declared after its victory that it " won as New Labour and would govern as New Labour " , but Cox and Lawson challenged this view , suggesting that the party won on account of public opposition to the Conservative Party .

 = = = Anthony Crosland = = = 
 The basic principles of New Labour existed in the post @-@ war socialist revisionism of Anthony Crosland . Crosland emphasised that Labour should not just focus on nationalisation and social welfare , but attempt to reform education , resolve wealth inequality , and pursue better industrial relations . His work The Future of Socialism stressed the idea that socialism is moral and should pursue liberty , fellowship , social justice , and equality . This required the redistribution of wealth through a progressive tax system , rendering public ownership of the means of production , enshrined in Clause IV of Labour 's constitution , unnecessary . Crosland also proposed that education reform allow greater egalitarianism , proposing the abolition of the eleven plus exam . 
 = = = Tony Blair = = = 
 Tony Blair became the leader of the Labour Party after 1994 's leadership election , and coined the term " New Labour " in that October 's party conference . Blair pursued a " Third Way " philosophy that sought to use the public and private sectors to stimulate economic growth and abandon Labour 's commitment to nationalisation . Blair 's approach to government included a greater reliance on the media , using that to set the national policy agenda , rather than Westminster . He spent considerable resources maintaining a good public image , which sometimes took priority over the cabinet . Blair adopted a centrist political agenda in which cabinet ministers took managerial roles in their departments ; strategic vision was to be addressed by the Prime Minister . Ideologically , Blair believed that individuals could only flourish in a strong society , and this was not possible in the midst of unemployment .

 Gordon Brown was an important figure in Blair 's Labour government and played a key role in developing the party 's philosophy . Brown served as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1992 to 1997 and was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer following Labour 's election victory in 1997 . He attempted to control public spending and sought to increase the funding for education and healthcare . His economic strategy was market @-@ based , attempting to reform the welfare state through a tax credit scheme for poorer working families , and he assigned the Bank of England to set interest rates .

 In 1985 , Peter Mandelson was appointed as the Labour Party 's director of communication ; previously , he had worked in television broadcasting . He helped the party become increasingly effective at communication and more concerned with its media image , especially with non @-@ partisans . Mandelson headed the Campaigns and Communications Directorate , established in 1985 , and initiated the Shadow Communications Agency . He oversaw Labour 's relationship with the media and believed in the importance of the agenda @-@ setting role of the press . He felt that the agenda of the press ( broadsheets in particular ) would influence important political broadcasters . In government , Mandelson was appointed minister without portfolio to co @-@ ordinate the various government departments . In 1998 , accused of financial impropriety , he resigned as a cabinet minister . 
 = = = Alastair Campbell = = = 
 Alastair Campbell was the Labour Party 's Press Secretary and led a strategy to neutralise the influence of the press ( which had weakened former Labour leader Neil Kinnock ) and create allies for the party . While in government , Campbell established a Strategic Communications Unit , a central body whose role was to co @-@ ordinate the party 's media relations and ensure that a unified image was presented to the press . Because of his background in tabloid journalism , Campbell understood how different parts of the media would cover stories . He was a valued news source for journalists because he was close to Blair – he was the first press secretary to regularly attend cabinet meetings . 
 = = Political philosophy = = 
 New Labour developed and subscribed to the " Third Way " , a centrist platform designed to offer an alternative to both complete capitalism and absolute socialism . The ideology was developed to make the party progressive and attract voters from across the political spectrum . New Labour offered a middle way between the neo @-@ liberal free market economics of the New Right , which it saw as economically efficient , and the ethical reformism of post @-@ 1945 Labour , which shared New Labour 's concern for social justice . New Labour 's ideology departed with its traditional beliefs in achieving social justice on behalf of the working class through mass collectivism ; Blair was influenced by ethical and Christian forms of socialism and used these to cast a modern form of socialism . 
 = = = Social justice = = = 
 New Labour tended to emphasise social justice , rather than the equality which was the focus of previous Labour governments , and challenged the view that social justice and economic efficiency are mutually exclusive . The party 's traditional attachment to equality was reduced : Minimum standards and equality of opportunity were promoted over the equality of outcome . The Commission on Social Justice , set up by John Smith , reported in 1994 that the values of social justice were : equal worth of citizens , equal rights to be able to meet their basic needs , the requirement to spread opportunities as much as possible , and the need to remove unjustified inequalities . The party viewed social justice primarily as the requirement to give citizens equal political and economic liberty and also as the need for social citizenship . It encompasses the need for equal distribution of opportunity , with the caveat that things should not be taken from successful people to give to the unsuccessful . 
 = = = Economics = = = 
 New Labour accepted the economic efficiency of free markets and believed that they could be detached from capitalism to achieve the aims of socialism , while maintaining the efficiency of capitalism . Markets were also useful for giving power to consumers and allowing citizens to make their own decisions and act responsibly . New Labour embraced market economics because they believed they could be used for their social aims , as well as economic efficiency . The party did not believe that public ownership was efficient or desirable ; ensuring that they were not seen to be ideologically pursuing centralised public ownership was important to the party . In government , the party relied on public @-@ private partnerships and private finance initiatives to raise funds and mitigate fears of a ' tax and spend ' policy or excessive borrowing . 
 = = = Welfare = = = 
 Welfare reforms proposed by New Labour in their 2001 manifesto included Working Families Tax Credit , the National Childcare Strategy , and the National Minimum Wage . Writing in Capital & Class , Dr. Chris Grover argued that these policies were aimed at promoting work , and that this position dominated New Labour 's position on welfare . He considered the view that New Labour 's welfare reforms were " <unk> " and argued that , in this context , it must refer to social policy being put in line with free market economic growth . Gower proposed that , under New Labour , this position was consolidated through schemes to encourage work . 
 = = = Crime = = = 
 Parts of New Labour 's political philosophy linked crime with social exclusion and pursued policies to encourage partnerships between social and police authorities to lower crime rates . Other areas of New Labour 's policy maintained a traditional approach to crime ; the prison population in 2005 rose to over 76 @,@ 000 , mostly owing to the increasing length of sentences . Following the September 11 attacks , the Labour government attempted to emphasise counter @-@ terrorism measures . From 2002 , the government followed policies aimed at reducing anti @-@ social behaviour ; in the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act , Labour introduced Anti @-@ Social Behaviour Orders ( <unk> ) . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Trade union activist and journalist Jimmy Reid wrote in The Scotsman in 2002 criticising New Labour for failing to promote or deliver equality . He argued that Labour 's pursuit of a " dynamic market economy " was a way of continuing the operation of a free market economy , which prevented governments from interfering to achieve social justice . Reid argued that the social agenda of Clement Attlee 's government was abandoned by Thatcher and not revived by New Labour . He criticised the party for not preventing inequality from widening , and argued that New Labour 's ambition to win elections had moved the party towards the right . 
 In 2002 , Anthony Giddens , a key figure in the development of the " Third Way " , listed problems facing the New Labour government , naming spin as the biggest failure because its damage to the party 's image was difficult to rebound from . He also challenged the failure of the Millennium Dome project and Labour 's inability to deal with irresponsible businesses . Giddens saw Labour 's ability to marginalise the Conservative Party as a success , as well its economic policy , welfare reform and certain aspects of education . Giddens criticised what he called Labour 's " half @-@ way houses " , including the National Health Service , and environmental and constitutional reform . 
 = Utah State Route 313 = 
 State Route 313 ( SR @-@ 313 ) is a Utah state highway in San Juan and Grand Counties . The highway has been designated the Dead Horse Point Mesa Scenic Byway . The highway is an access road for both the Island in the Sky district of Canyonlands National Park and Dead Horse Point State Park . The highway is a toll road in Dead Horse Point State Park . Westbound traffic is charged a state park entrance fee at the park boundary . 
 The route was assigned north of Moab in the 1975 in place of SR @-@ 278 , a proposed but never constructed access to Dead Horse Point . The original alignment of the highway featured steep grades and blind corners . The highway was completely rebuilt in the 1980s after sustaining damage while crews rebuilt the access road to Canyonlands National Park . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The highway begins at the overlook in Dead Horse Point State Park 's parking lot ( 22 miles south of Moab ) . Gaining its scenic byway designation , SR @-@ 313 heads northward , along the ridges of Dead Horse Point . The highway climbs in elevation , reaching a height of 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) . Soon after , all drivers exit the park and have to pay a toll . After the high peak at 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) , SR @-@ 313 heads slowly downward , continuing along the ridges in the park . There is an intersection with a local road , and the highway begins to turn to the northwest . The elevation along SR @-@ 313 fluctuates for several miles , until intersecting with Long Canyon Road . Long Canyon Road is a connector that heads through Long Canyon and intersects with SR @-@ 279 . The route continues in a stretch of area known as the Big Flat , where it intersects the entrance to Canyonlands National Park . Soon after the westward turn , SR @-@ 313 intersects with Island in the Sky Road , a local road that heads southward from the main highway . 
 The Knoll , a nearby mountain , is visible as the highway makes a turn to the north . The route has left Dead Horse Point State Park by now , and progresses northward through Grand County . At the intersection with Little Canyon Road , SR @-@ 313 turns to the northwest once again . However , this pattern straightens out to a northward one . At Gemini Bridges Road , the route turns to the opposite direction , heading to the <unk> . The highway continues along in this direction for some time , passing Mineral Bottom Road , and drops down in elevation . The route makes a hairpin turn in the mountains , entering the South Fork of the Sevenmile Canyon . While traversing the canyon there are several view areas along the highway overlooking both Sevenmile canyon , Dead Horse Point , and two rock formations called the Monitor and the Merrimack , both named after warships in the American Civil War . Running along the canyon , SR @-@ 313 terminates at an intersection with U.S. Route 191 about 9 miles ( 14 km ) north of Moab . 
 = = History = = 
 With highways in and near Moab back in the 1960s limited to just two state @-@ maintained highways , there was no state route built to access Dead Horse Point . The only two highways in the area were U.S. Route 160 ( now U.S. Route 191 ) and State Route 128 . There were two routes assigned in the direction of Dead Horse Point in the 1960s , SR @-@ 278 and SR @-@ 279 . The route that SR @-@ 313 runs along was mapped by 1969 , stretching all the way to Dead Horse Point as an unmarked county highway . Though SR @-@ 279 was completed in 1962 , SR @-@ 278 was never constructed . In 1975 , the proposal for SR @-@ 278 was cancelled . In its place , the Utah Department of Transportation assigned SR @-@ 313 , assuming maintenance for what was local roads . 
 The original roadbed featured blind switchbacks and an 11 % grade on the descent into Seven Mile canyon . The access road to Canyonlands National Park was rebuilt 1988 , and the construction crews severely damaged SR @-@ 313 in the process . The highway was completely rebuilt , starting in 1989 , to its modern form . The reconstruction reduced the maximum grade from 11 % to 8 % and re @-@ graded the switchbacks to be on level ground to eliminate the blind corners .

 = NuScale Power = 
 NuScale Power is a private limited liability company headquartered in Tigard , Oregon that designs and markets small modular reactors ( <unk> ) . As of 2014 , the Department of Energy projected its technology would be commercially available around the year 2025 . 
 NuScale was founded based on research funded by the Department of Energy from 2000 to 2003 . After funding was cut , scientists with the program obtained related patents in 2007 and started NuScale to commercialize the technology . In 2011 , the company 's largest investor had its assets frozen due to an investigation by the Securities Exchange Commission . The company experienced financial hardship until new funding was obtained from Fluor Corporation and later from the Department of Energy . NuScale is currently planning the first NuScale power plant in Idaho . 
 NuScale 's SMR designs are for 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) by 65 feet ( 20 m ) reactor vessels that use conventional light water cooling methods . Each module is intended to be kept in an underground pool and is expected to produce about 50 megawatts of electricity . It uses passive water @-@ circulation that can operate without powered pumps or circulatory equipment .

 NuScale was founded based on research funded by the US Department of Energy and conducted by Oregon State University , the Idaho National Laboratory , and other colleges beginning in 2000 . At the time , Oregon State 's nuclear department had been developing passive water @-@ circulation techniques for cooling in nuclear plants . The research grant ended in 2003 , but a group of scientists at Oregon State University continued the work . They built a test lab at one @-@ third the actual scale of the technology and inherited related patents from the university in 2007 , in exchange for a small equity in the company . NuScale was founded that same year . Its first funding round was in January 2008 for an undisclosed sum . It began seeking certification with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in February 2008 . 
 By 2011 , NuScale had raised $ 35 million in financing and had 100 employees in three cities : Tigard , Oregon ; Richland , Washington ; and Corvallis , Oregon . NuScale was the first to submit plans for small reactors to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and was widely expected to be the first to get government approval . It was also being evaluated by a consortium of utility companies called Energy Northwest . 
 = = = Funding difficulties and rebound = = = 
 In January 2011 , NuScale 's largest investor , Kenwood Group , was investigated by the Securities Exchange Commission and later plead guilty to operating a Ponzi scheme . The SEC investigation was not related to any of Kenwood 's dealings with NuScale , but Kenwood 's assets were frozen just as NuScale was expecting additional funding . The company started making staffing and pay cuts as executives looked for new funding sources and most of the company 's employees were laid off within a few months . 
 That September , NuScale obtained a loan to re @-@ hire 60 employees . In October , Fluor acquired a majority interest in the company for $ 3 @.@ 5 million and promised almost $ 30 million in working capital . According to The Energy Daily , Fluor 's investment saved the company , which had been " financially marooned " by its prior investor . A separate agreement also gave Fluor the rights to construct NuScale @-@ based power plants . 
 In August 2012 , Rolls @-@ Royce Holdings said it would support NuScale 's commercialization efforts and help it obtain funding from the Department of Energy 's Funding Opportunity Announcement , which is intended to provide funding to help bring <unk> to market . It was not awarded any funding in the first round . In the Department of Energy 's ( DOE ) second round of funding in December 2013 , NuScale won up to $ 226 million in " cost @-@ sharing " funding to share the expense of pursuing government approval , through the SMR Licensing Technical Support program . This was followed by an agreement in May 2014 for up to $ 217 million in funding over a five @-@ year period , whereby the Department of Energy would match private funding . In December 2012 , co @-@ founder and CEO Paul G. Lorenzini was succeeded by current CEO John Hopkins .

 In March 2012 , NuScale signed an agreement with the Department of Energy , allowing NuScale and two partners to build and operate a NuScale @-@ based nuclear power plant at the Savannah River Site . The following month Energy Northwest said it didn 't have any immediate plans to construct a nuclear power plant , but had evaluated all the available SMR technologies and identified NuScale as the best available option at the time . 
 In July 2013 , NuScale announced an effort to study and demonstrate NuScale reactors in the western United States , called Program WIN ( Western Initiative for Nuclear ) , with plans to build the first NuScale @-@ based power plant in the western United States by 2024 . In November 2014 , NuScale announced it was building what is expected to be the first SMR in the US in Idaho . The plant is for the Carbon Free Power Project with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems . It is expected to be completed in 2023 . 
 = = Reactors = = 
 NuScale designs and markets small modular nuclear reactors that the Department of Energy expects to be commercially available around 2025 . Its designs use the light water approach to cooling and power generation that is common in conventional nuclear plants . Water is heated by the nuclear core at the base of the reactor vessel . Heated water flows upwards inside the riser , then down over steam generators . As heat is transferred to steam generators , the water becomes cooler and denser , sinking back to the bottom of the device , where the cycle is repeated . Heat transferred to the steam generators is used to create steam that turns a turbine , which drives an electrical generator . 
 Each NuScale reactor vessel is expected to be 9 feet by 65 feet and weigh 650 tons ( 590 metric tons ) . The modules would be pre @-@ fabricated , delivered by railcar , barge or special trucks and assembled on @-@ site . The units are designed to produce 50 <unk> of electricity each and require refueling with standard 4 @.@ 95 percent enriched Uranium @-@ 235 fuel every two years . 
 NuScale 's design does not rely on powered water pumps or circulatory equipment . The company claims it can shut down and continue cooling itself indefinitely in the event of a catastrophe . The devices are intended to be kept in a below @-@ ground pool , to absorb the shock of earthquakes , with a concrete lid over the pool . In the event that AC power is lost for normal cooling systems , the pool water begins to absorb heat and boil . 
 = = = Comparisons = = = 
 NuScale is expected to be the first SMR to market , because its cooling is similar to the systems used in conventional power plants . However , alternative cooling systems using molten metals are expected to operate at higher , more efficient temperatures once approved . The company estimates a twelve @-@ unit NuScale plant would cost $ 5 @,@ 000 per kilowatt . In comparison , the Energy Information Administration in 2011 estimated costs to be $ 4 @,@ 700 per kilowatt for conventional nuclear power , $ 4 @,@ 600 for a carbon <unk> plant and $ 931 at a gas @-@ fired plant or in excess of $ 1 @,@ 800 for a gas @-@ fired plant with carbon sequestration . David <unk> , executive director of <unk> 's Energy and Power Division , said SMR 's like NuScale 's are ideal for rural towns that need small power plants and do not have access to natural gas . NuScale power plants are also expected to take less time , materials and space to construct than other power sources and can be expanded incrementally to meet changing power needs .

 NuScale has offices in Tigard , Oregon ( near Portland ) ; Corvallis , Oregon ; Charlotte , North Carolina ; and Rockville , Maryland . Its headquarters are in Tigard and its production facility is located in Corvallis . It maintains a test facility at Oregon State University , as well as two additional test facilities in Italy . 
 = Kingdom of Mysore = 
 The Kingdom of Mysore was a kingdom of southern India , traditionally believed to have been founded in 1399 in the vicinity of the modern city of Mysore . The kingdom , which was ruled by the Wodeyar family , initially served as a vassal state of the Vijayanagara Empire . With the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire ( c . 1565 ) , the kingdom became independent . The 17th century saw a steady expansion of its territory and during the rule of Narasaraja Wodeyar I and Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar , the kingdom annexed large expanses of what is now southern Karnataka and parts of Tamil Nadu to become a powerful state in the southern Deccan . 
 The kingdom reached the height of its military power and dominion in the latter half of the 18th century under the de facto ruler Haider Ali and his son Tipu Sultan . During this time , it came into conflict with the Marathas , the Nizam of Hyderabad , the Kingdom of Travancore and the British which culminated in the four Anglo @-@ Mysore Wars . Success in the first two Anglo @-@ Mysore wars was followed by defeat in the third and fourth . Following Tipu 's death in the fourth war of 1799 , large parts of his kingdom were annexed by the British , which signalled the end of a period of Mysorean hegemony over southern Deccan . The British restored the Wodeyars to their throne by way of a subsidiary alliance and the diminished Mysore was transformed into a Princely state . The Wodeyars continued to rule the state until Indian independence in 1947 , when Mysore acceded to the Union of India . 
 Even as a princely state , Mysore came to be counted among the more modern and urbanized regions of India . This period ( 1799 – 1947 ) also saw Mysore emerge as one of the important centers of art and culture in India . The Mysore kings were not only accomplished exponents of the fine arts and men of letters , they were enthusiastic patrons as well , and their legacies continue to influence music and art even today . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 Sources for the history of the kingdom include numerous extant lithic and copper plate inscriptions , records from the Mysore palace and contemporary literary sources in Kannada , Persian and other languages . According to traditional accounts , the kingdom originated as a small state based in the modern city of Mysore and was founded by two brothers , <unk> ( also known as Vijaya ) and <unk> . Their origins are mired in legend and are still a matter of debate ; while some historians posit a northern origin at Dwaraka , others locate it in Karnataka . <unk> is said to have married <unk> , the local princess and assumed the feudal title " Wodeyar " ( lit , " Lord " ) , which the ensuing dynasty retained . The first unambiguous mention of the Wodeyar family is in 16th century Kannada literature from the reign of the Vijayanagara king Achyuta Deva Raya ( 1529 – 1542 ) ; the earliest available inscription , issued by the Wodeyars themselves , dates to the rule of the petty chief Timmaraja II in 1551 . 
 = = = Autonomy : advances and reversals = = = 
 The kings who followed ruled as vassals of the Vijayanagara empire until the decline of the latter in 1565 . By this time , the kingdom had expanded to thirty @-@ three villages protected by a force of 300 soldiers . King Timmaraja II conquered some surrounding chiefdoms , and King Bola Chamaraja IV ( lit , " Bald " ) , the first ruler of any political significance among them , withheld tribute to the nominal Vijayanagara monarch Aravidu <unk> . After the death of Aravidu <unk> , the Wodeyars began to assert themselves further and King Raja Wodeyar I wrested control of Srirangapatna from the Vijayanagara governor ( <unk> ) Aravidu <unk> – a development which elicited , if only ex post facto , the tacit approval of <unk> Raya , the incumbent king of the diminished Vijayanagar empire ruling from Chandragiri . Raja Wodeyar I 's reign also saw territorial expansion with the annexation of <unk> to the north from <unk> Raya – a development which made Mysore a regional political factor to reckon with . 
 Consequently , by 1612 – 13 , the Wodeyars exercised a great deal of autonomy and even though they acknowledged the nominal overlordship of the <unk> , tributes and transfers of revenue to Chandragiri stopped . This was in marked contrast to the major chiefs ( Nayakas ) of Tamil country who continued to pay off Chandragiri well into the 1630s . Chamaraja VI and Kanthirava Narasaraja I attempted to expand further northward but were thwarted by the Bijapur Sultanate and its Maratha subordinates , though the Bijapur armies under <unk> Khan were effectively repelled in their 1638 siege of Srirangapatna . <unk> ambitions then turned southward into Tamil country where Narasaraja Wodeyar acquired <unk> ( in modern northern Coimbatore district ) while his successor Dodda Devaraja Wodeyar expanded further to capture western Tamil regions of Erode and Dharmapuri , after successfully repulsing the chiefs of Madurai . The invasion of the Keladi Nayakas of Malnad was also dealt with successfully . This period was followed by one of complex geo @-@ political changes , when in the 1670s , the Marathas and the Mughals pressed into the Deccan . 
 Chikka Devaraja ( r . 1672 – 1704 ) , the most notable of Mysore 's early kings , who ruled during much of this period , managed to not only survive the exigencies but further expanded territory . He achieved this by forging strategic alliances with the Marathas and the Mughals . The kingdom soon grew to include Salem and Bangalore to the east , Hassan to the west , Chikkamagaluru and Tumkur to the north and the rest of Coimbatore to the south . Despite this expansion , the kingdom , which now accounted for a fair share of land in the southern Indian heartland , extending from the Western Ghats to the western boundaries of the Coromandel plain , remained landlocked without direct coastal access . Chikka Devaraja 's attempts to remedy this brought Mysore into conflict with the Nayaka chiefs of Ikkeri and the kings ( Rajas ) of Kodagu ( modern Coorg ) ; who between them controlled the Kanara coast ( coastal areas of modern Karnataka ) and the intervening hill region respectively . The conflict brought mixed results with Mysore annexing <unk> but suffering a reversal at <unk> . 
 Nevertheless , from around 1704 , when the kingdom passed on to " <unk> " ( <unk> ) Kanthirava Narasaraja II , the survival and expansion of the kingdom was achieved by playing a delicate game of alliance , negotiation , subordination on occasion , and annexation of territory in all directions . According to historians Sanjay Subrahmanyam and Sethu Madhava Rao , Mysore was now formally a tributary of the Mughal empire . Mughul records claim a regular tribute ( <unk> ) was paid by Mysore . However , historian Suryanath U. Kamath feels the Mughals may have considered Mysore an ally , a situation brought about by Mughal – Maratha competition for supremacy in southern India . By the 1720s , with the Mughal empire in decline , further complications arose with the Mughal residents at both Arcot and Sira claiming tribute . The years that followed saw Krishnaraja Wodeyar I tread cautiously on the matter while keeping the Kodagu chiefs and the Marathas at bay . He was followed by Chamaraja Wodeyar VII during whose reign power fell into the hands of prime minister ( Dalwai or <unk> ) <unk> ( or Nanjaraja ) and chief minister ( <unk> ) <unk> ( or Devaraja ) , the influential brothers from Kalale town near Nanjangud who would rule for the next three decades with the Wodeyars relegated to being the titular heads . The latter part of the rule of Krishnaraja II saw the Deccan Sultanates being eclipsed by the Mughals and in the confusion that ensued , Haider Ali , a captain in the army , rose to prominence . His victory against the Marathas at Bangalore in 1758 , resulting in the annexation of their territory , made him an iconic figure . In honour of his achievements , the king gave him the title " Nawab Haider Ali Khan Bahadur " . 
 = = = Under Haider Ali and Tipu Sultan = = = 
 Though illiterate , Haider Ali has earned an important place in the history of Karnataka for his fighting skills and administrative acumen . The rise of Haidar came at a time of important political developments in the sub @-@ continent . While the European powers were busy transforming themselves from trading companies to political powers , the Nizam as the subedar of the Mughals pursued his ambitions in the Deccan , and the Marathas , following their defeat at Panipat , sought safe havens in the south . The period also saw the French vie with the British for control of the Carnatic – a contest in which the British would eventually prevail as British commander Sir Eyre Coote decisively defeated the French under the Comte de Lally at the Battle of <unk> in 1760 , a watershed in Indian history as it cemented British supremacy in South Asia . Though the Wodeyars remained the nominal heads of Mysore during this period , real power lay in the hands of Haider Ali and his son Tipu . 
 By 1761 , the Maratha menace had diminished and by 1763 , Haider Ali had captured the Keladi kingdom , defeated the rulers of <unk> , Bednur and <unk> , invaded the Malabar in the south and conquered the Zamorin 's capital Calicut with ease in 1766 and extended the Mysore kingdom up to Dharwad and Bellary in the north . Mysore was now a major political power in the subcontinent and Haider 's meteoric rise from relative obscurity and his defiance formed one of the last remaining challenges to complete British hegemony over the Indian subcontinent – a challenge which would take them more than three decades to overcome . 
 In a bid to stem Haidar 's rise , the British formed an alliance with the Marathas and the Nizam of Golconda , culminating in the First Anglo @-@ Mysore War in 1767 . Despite numerical superiority Haider Ali suffered defeats at the battles of <unk> and Tiruvannamalai . The British ignored his overtures for peace until Haider Ali had strategically moved his armies to within five miles of Madras ( modern Chennai ) and was able to successfully sue for peace . In 1770 , when the Maratha armies of Madhavrao Peshwa invaded Mysore ( three wars were fought between 1764 and 1772 by Madhavrao against Haider , in which Haider lost ) , Haider expected British support as per the 1769 treaty but they betrayed him by staying out of the conflict . The British betrayal and Haider 's subsequent defeat reinforced Haider 's deep distrust of the British — a sentiment that would be shared by his son and one which would inform Anglo @-@ Mysore rivalries of the next three decades . In 1777 , Haider Ali recovered the previously lost territories of Coorg and Malabar from the Marathas . Haider Ali 's army advanced towards the Marathas and fought them at the Battle of <unk> and came out victorious during the same year . 
 By 1779 , Haider Ali had captured parts of modern Tamil Nadu and Kerala in the south , extending the Kingdom 's area to about 80 @,@ 000 mi ² ( 205 @,@ 000 km ² ) . In 1780 , he befriended the French and made peace with the Marathas and the Nizam . However , Haider Ali was betrayed by the Marathas and the Nizam , who made treaties with the British as well . In July 1779 Haider Ali headed an army of 80 @,@ 000 , mostly cavalry , descending through the passes of the Ghats amid burning villages , before laying siege to British forts in northern Arcot starting the Second Anglo @-@ Mysore War . Haider Ali had some initial successes against the British notably at Pollilur , the worst defeat the British suffered in India until <unk> , and Arcot , until the arrival of Sir Eyre Coote , when the fortunes of the British began to change . On 1 June 1781 Sir Eyre Coote struck the first heavy blow against Haider Ali in the decisive Battle of Porto Novo . The battle was won by Sir Eyre Coote against odds of five to one , and is regarded as one of the greatest feats of the British in India . It was followed up by another hard @-@ fought battle at Pollilur ( the scene of an earlier triumph of Haider Ali over a British force ) on 27 August , in which the British won another success , and by the rout of the Mysore troops at <unk> a month later . Haider Ali died on 7 December 1782 , even as fighting continued with the British . He was succeeded by his son Tipu Sultan who continued hostilities against the British by recapturing <unk> and Mangalore . 
 By 1783 neither the British nor Mysore were able to obtain a clear overall victory . The French withdrew their support of Mysore following the peace settlement in Europe . Undaunted , Tipu , popularly known as the " Tiger of Mysore " , continued the war against the British but lost some regions in modern coastal Karnataka to them . The Maratha @-@ Mysore War occurred between 1785 and 1787 and consisted of a series of conflicts between the Sultanate of Mysore and the Maratha Empire . Following Tipu Sultan 's victory against the Marathas at the Siege of Bahadur Benda , a peace agreement was signed between the two kingdoms with mutual gains and losses . Similarly , the treaty of Mangalore was signed in 1784 bringing hostilities with the British to a temporary and uneasy halt and restored the others ' lands to the status quo ante bellum . The treaty is an important document in the history of India , because it was the last occasion when an Indian power dictated terms to the British , who were made to play the role of humble supplicants for peace . A start of fresh hostilities between the British and French in Europe would have been sufficient reason for Tipu to abrogate his treaty and further his ambition of striking at the British . His attempts to lure the Nizam , the Marathas , the French and the King of Turkey failed to bring direct military aid . 
 Tipu 's successful attacks in 1790 on the Kingdom of Travancore , a British ally , was an effective victory for him , however it resulted in greater hostilities with the British which resulted in the Third Anglo @-@ Mysore War . In the beginning , the British made gains , taking the Coimbatore district , but Tipu 's counterattack reversed many of these gains . By 1792 , with aid from the Marathas who attacked from the north @-@ west and the Nizam who moved in from the north @-@ east , the British under Lord Cornwallis successfully besieged Srirangapatna , resulting in Tipu 's defeat and the Treaty of Srirangapatna . Half of Mysore was distributed among the allies , and two of his sons were held to ransom . A humiliated but indomitable Tipu went about re @-@ building his economic and military power . He attempted to covertly win over support from Revolutionary France , the Amir of Afghanistan , the Ottoman Empire and Arabia . However , these attempts to involve the French soon became known to the British , who were at the time fighting the French in Egypt , were backed by the Marathas and the Nizam . In 1799 , Tipu died defending Srirangapatna in the Fourth Anglo @-@ Mysore War , heralding the end of the Kingdom 's independence . Modern Indian historians consider Tipu Sultan an inveterate enemy of the British , an able administrator and an innovator . 
 = = = Princely state = = = 
 Following Tipu 's fall , a part of the kingdom of Mysore was annexed and divided between the Madras Presidency and the Nizam . The remaining territory was transformed into a Princely State ; the five @-@ year @-@ old scion of the Wodeyar family , Krishnaraja III , was installed on the throne with chief minister ( Diwan ) Purnaiah , who had earlier served under Tipu , handling the reins as regent and Lt. Col. Barry Close taking charge as the British Resident . The British then took control of Mysore 's foreign policy and also exacted an annual tribute and a subsidy for maintaining a standing British army at Mysore . As Diwan , Purnaiah distinguished himself with his progressive and innovative administration until he retired from service in 1811 ( and died shortly thereafter ) following the 16th birthday of the boy king . 
 The years that followed witnessed cordial relations between Mysore and the British until things began to sour in the 1820s . Even though the Governor of Madras , Thomas Munro , determined after a personal investigation in 1825 that there was no substance to the allegations of financial impropriety made by A. H. Cole , the incumbent Resident of Mysore , the Nagar rebellion ( a civil insurrection ) which broke out towards the end of the decade changed things considerably . In 1831 , close on the heels of the insurrection and citing mal @-@ administration , the British took direct control of the princely state . For the next fifty years , Mysore passed under the rule of successive British Commissioners ; Sir Mark <unk> , renowned for his statesmanship , served from 1834 until 1861 and put into place an efficient and successful administrative system which left Mysore a well @-@ developed state . 
 In 1876 – 77 , however , towards the end of the period of direct British rule , Mysore was struck by a devastating famine with estimated mortality figures ranging between 700 @,@ 000 and 1 @,@ 100 @,@ 000 , or nearly a fifth of the population . Shortly thereafter , Maharaja Chamaraja X , educated in the British system , took over the rule of Mysore in 1881 , following the success of a lobby set up by the Wodeyar dynasty that was in favour of rendition . Accordingly , a resident British officer was appointed at the Mysore court and a Diwan to handle the Maharaja 's administration . From then onwards , until Indian independence in 1947 , Mysore remained a Princely State within the British Indian Empire , with the Wodeyars continuing their rule . 
 After the demise of Maharaja Chamaraja X , Krishnaraja IV , still a boy of eleven , ascended the throne in 1895 . His mother Maharani <unk> ruled as regent until Krishnaraja took over the reins on 8 February 1902 . Under his rule , with Sir M. <unk> as his Diwan , the Maharaja set about transforming Mysore into a progressive and modern state , particularly in industry , education , agriculture and art . Such were the strides that Mysore made that Mahatma Gandhi called the Maharaja a " saintly king " ( <unk> ) . Paul Brunton , the British philosopher and orientalist , John Gunther , the American author , and British statesman Lord Samuel praised the ruler 's efforts . Much of the pioneering work in educational infrastructure that took place during this period would serve Karnataka <unk> in the coming decades . The Maharaja was an accomplished musician , and like his predecessors , avidly patronised the development of the fine arts . He was followed by his nephew Jayachamaraja whose rule came to an end when he signed the instrument of accession and Mysore joined the Indian Union on 9 August 1947 . 
 = = Administration = = 
 There are no records relating to the administration of the Mysore territory during the Vijayanagara Empire 's reign ( 1399 – 1565 ) . Signs of a well @-@ organised and independent administration appear from the time of Raja Wodeyar I who is believed to have been sympathetic towards peasants ( <unk> ) who were exempted from any increases in taxation during his time . The first sign that the kingdom had established itself in the area was the issuing of gold coins ( <unk> <unk> ) resembling those of the erstwhile Vijayanagara Empire during Narasaraja Wodeyar 's rule . 
 The rule of Chikka Devaraja saw several reforms were effected . Internal administration was remodeled to suit the kingdom 's growing needs and became more efficient . A postal system came into being . Far reaching financial reforms were also introduced . A number of petty taxes were imposed in place of direct taxes , as a result of which the peasants were compelled to pay more by way of land tax . The king is said to have taken a personal interest in the regular collection of revenues the treasury burgeoned to 90 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 Pagoda ( a unit of currency ) – earning him the epithet " Nine crore Narayana " ( <unk> Narayana ) . In 1700 , he sent an embassy to Aurangazeb 's court who bestowed upon him the title Jug Deo Raja and awarded permission to sit on the ivory throne . Following this , he founded the district offices ( <unk> <unk> ) , the central secretariat comprising eighteen departments , and his administration was modeled on Mughal lines . 
 During Haider Ali 's rule , the kingdom was divided into five provinces ( <unk> ) of unequal size , comprising 171 taluks ( <unk> ) in total . When Tipu Sultan became the de facto ruler , the kingdom , which encompassed 160 @,@ 000 km2 ( 61 @,@ 776 sq mi ) ( 62 @,@ 000 mi ² ) , was divided into 37 provinces and a total of 124 taluks ( Amil ) . Each province had a governor ( <unk> ) , and one deputy governor . Each taluk had a headman called <unk> and a group of villages were in charge of a Patel . The central administration comprised six departments headed by ministers , each aided by an advisory council of up to four members . 
 When the princely state came under direct British rule in 1831 , early commissioners Lushington , Briggs and Morrison were followed by Mark <unk> , who took charge in 1834 . He made Bangalore the capital and divided the princely state into four divisions , each under a British superintendent . The state was further divided into 120 taluks with 85 taluk courts , with all lower level administration in the Kannada language . The office of the commissioner had eight departments ; revenue , post , police , cavalry , public works , medical , animal husbandry , judiciary and education . The judiciary was hierarchical with the commissioners ' court at the apex , followed by the <unk> <unk> , four superintending courts and eight Sadar <unk> courts at the lowest level . Lewin Bowring became the chief commissioner in 1862 and held the position until 1870 . During his tenure , the property " Registration Act " , the " Indian Penal code " and " Code of Criminal Procedure " came into effect and the judiciary was separated from the executive branch of the administration . The state was divided into eight districts – Bangalore , <unk> , Hassan , <unk> , Kolar , Mysore , Shimoga , and Tumkur . 
 After rendition , C. V. <unk> , was made the Diwan . Under him , the first Representative Assembly of British India , with 144 members , was formed in 1881 . He was followed by K. Seshadri Iyer in 1883 during whose tenure gold mining at the Kolar Gold Fields began , the Shivanasamudra hydroelectric project was initiated in 1899 ( the first such major attempt in India ) and electricity and drinking water ( the latter through pipes ) was supplied to Bangalore . Seshadri Iyer was followed by P. N. Krishnamurti , who founded The Secretariat Manual to maintain records and the Co @-@ operative Department in 1905 , V. P. Madhava Rao who focussed on conservation of forests and T. Ananda Rao , who finalised the <unk> Dam project . 
 Sir M. Visvesvaraya , popularly known as the " Maker of Modern Mysore " , holds a key place in the history of Karnataka . An engineer by education , he became the Diwan in 1909 . Under his tenure , membership of the Mysore Legislative Assembly was increased from 18 to 24 , and it was given the power to discuss the state budget . The Mysore Economic Conference was expanded into three committees ; industry and commerce , education , and agriculture , with publications in English and Kannada . Important projects commissioned during his time included the construction of the <unk> Dam , the founding of the Mysore Iron Works at Bhadravathi , founding of the Mysore University in 1916 , the University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering in Bangalore , establishment of the Mysore state railway department and numerous industries in Mysore . In 1955 , he was awarded the Bharat Ratna , India 's highest civilian honor . 
 Sir Mirza Ismail took office as Diwan in 1926 and built on the foundation laid by his predecessor . Amongst his contributions were the expansion of the Bhadravathi Iron Works , the founding of a cement and paper factory in Bhadravathi and the launch of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited . A man with a penchant for gardens , he founded the Brindavan Gardens ( Krishnaraja Sagar ) and built the Kaveri River high @-@ level canal to irrigate 120 @,@ 000 acres ( 490 km2 ) in modern Mandya district . 
 In 1939 Mandya District was carved out of Mysore District , bringing the number of districts in the state to nine . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The vast majority of the people lived in villages and agriculture was their main occupation . The economy of the kingdom was based on agriculture . Grains , pulses , vegetables and flowers were cultivated . Commercial crops included sugarcane and cotton . The agrarian population consisted of landlords ( gavunda , zamindar , <unk> ) who tilled the land by employing a number of landless labourers , usually paying them in grain . Minor cultivators were also willing to hire themselves out as labourers if the need arose . It was due to the availability of these landless labourers that kings and landlords were able to execute major projects such as palaces , temples , mosques , <unk> ( dams ) and tanks . Because land was abundant and the population relatively sparse , no rent was charged on land ownership . Instead , landowners paid tax for cultivation , which amounted to up to one @-@ half of all harvested produce . 
 Tipu Sultan is credited to have founded state trading depots in various locations of his kingdom . In addition , he founded depots in foreign locations such as Karachi , Jeddah and Muscat , where Mysore products were sold . During Tipu 's rule French technology was used for the first time in carpentry and smithy , Chinese technology was used for sugar production , and technology from Bengal helped improve the sericulture industry . State factories were established in <unk> and <unk> for producing cannons and gunpowder respectively . The state held the monopoly in the production of essentials such as sugar , salt , iron , pepper , cardamom , betel nut , tobacco and sandalwood , as well as the extraction of incense oil from sandalwood and the mining of silver , gold and precious stones . Sandalwood was exported to China and the Persian Gulf countries and sericulture was developed in twenty @-@ one centres within the kingdom . 
 This system changed under the British , when tax payments were made in cash , and were used for the maintenance of the army , police and other civil and public establishments . A portion of the tax was transferred to England as the " Indian tribute " . Unhappy with the loss of their traditional revenue system and the problems they faced , peasants rose in rebellion in many parts of south India . After 1800 , the Cornwallis land reforms came into effect . Reade , Munro , Graham and Thackeray were some administrators who improved the economic conditions of the masses . However , the homespun textile industry suffered during British rule , with the exception of the producers of the finest cloth and the coarse cloth which was popular with the rural masses . This was due to the manufacturing mills of Manchester , Liverpool and Scotland being more than a match for the traditional <unk> industry , especially in spinning and weaving . 
 The economic revolution in England and the tariff policies of the British also caused massive de @-@ industrialization in other sectors throughout India and Mysore . For example , the gunny bag weaving business had been a monopoly of the <unk> people , which they lost when the British began ruling the area . The import of a chemical substitute for saltpetre ( potassium nitrate ) affected the <unk> community , the traditional makers of saltpetre for use in gunpowder . The import of kerosene affected the <unk> community which supplied oils . Foreign enamel and crockery industries affected the native pottery business , and mill @-@ made blankets replaced the country @-@ made blankets called <unk> . This economic fallout led to the formation of community @-@ based social welfare organisations to help those within the community to cope better with their new economic situation , including youth hostels for students seeking education and shelter . However , the British economic policies created a class structure consisting of a newly established middle class comprising various blue and white @-@ collared occupational groups , including agents , brokers , lawyers , teachers , civil servants and physicians . Due to a more flexible caste hierarchy , the middle class contained a heterogeneous mix of people from different castes . 
 = = Culture = = 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 The early kings of the Wodeyar dynasty worshipped the Hindu god Shiva . The later kings , starting from the 17th century , took to Vaishnavism , the worship of the Hindu god Vishnu . According to musicologist Meera <unk> <unk> , King Raja Wodeyar I was a devotee of the god Vishnu , King Dodda Devaraja was honoured with the title " Protector of Brahmins " ( Deva Brahmana <unk> ) for his support to Brahmins , and Maharaja Krishnaraja III was devoted to the goddess Chamundeshwari ( a form of Hindu goddess Durga ) . Wilks ( " History of Mysore " , 1800 ) wrote about a Jangama ( Veerashaiva saint @-@ devotee of Shiva ) uprising , related to excessive taxation , which was put down firmly by Chikka Devaraja . Historian D.R. Nagaraj claims that four hundred <unk> were murdered in the process but clarifies that <unk> literature itself is silent about the issue . Historian Suryanath Kamath claims King Chikka Devaraja was a Srivaishnava ( follower of Sri Vaishnavism , a sect of Vaishnavism ) but was not anti @-@ Veerashaiva . Historian <unk> concurs that some of the kings including the celebrated Narasaraja I and Chikka Devaraja were Vaishnavas , but suggests this may not have been the case with all Wodeyar rulers . The rise of the modern day Mysore city as a centre of south Indian culture has been traced from the period of their sovereignty . Raja Wodeyar I initiated the celebration of the Dasara festival in Mysore , a proud tradition of the erstwhile Vijayanagara royal family . 
 Jainism , though in decline during the late medieval period , also enjoyed the patronage of the Mysore kings , who made munificent endowments to the Jain monastic order at the town of Shravanabelagola . Records indicate that some Wodeyar kings not only presided over the <unk> ceremony , an important Jain religious event at Shravanabelagola , but also personally offered prayers ( puja ) during the years 1659 , 1677 , 1800 , 1825 , 1910 , 1925 , 1940 , and 1953 . 
 The contact between South India and Islam goes back to the 7th century , when trade between Hindu kingdoms and Islamic caliphates thrived . These Muslim traders settled on the Malabar Coast and married local Hindu women , and their descendants came to be known as <unk> . By the 14th century , Muslims had become a significant minority in the south , though the advent of Portuguese missionaries checked their growth . Haider Ali , though a devout Muslim , did not allow his faith to interfere with the administration of the predominantly Hindu kingdom . Historians are , however , divided on the intentions of Haider Ali 's son , Tipu Sultan . It has been claimed that Tipu raised Hindus to prominent positions in his administration , made generous grants to Hindu temples and brahmins , and generally respected other faiths , and that any religious conversions that Tipu undertook were as punishment to those who rebelled against his authority . However , this has been countered by other historians who claim that Tipu Sultan treated the non @-@ Muslims of Mysore far better than those of the Malabar , Raichur and Kodagu regions . They opine that Tipu was responsible for mass conversions of Christians and Hindus in these regions , either by force or by offering them tax incentives and revenue benefits to convert . 
 = = = Society = = = 
 Prior to the 18th century , the society of the kingdom followed age @-@ old and deeply established norms of social interaction between people . Accounts by contemporaneous travellers indicate the widespread practice of the Hindu caste system and of animal sacrifices during the nine @-@ day celebrations ( called Mahanavami ) . Later , fundamental changes occurred due to the struggle between native and foreign powers . Though wars between the Hindu kingdoms and the Sultanates continued , the battles between native rulers ( including Muslims ) and the newly arrived British took centre stage . The spread of English education , the introduction of the printing press and the criticism of the prevailing social system by Christian missionaries helped make the society more open and flexible . The rise of modern nationalism throughout India also affected Mysore . 
 With the advent of British power , English education gained prominence in addition to traditional education in local languages . These changes were orchestrated by Lord Elphinstone , the governor of the Madras Presidency . His plan became the constitution of the central collegiate institution or University Board in 1841 . Accordingly , a high school department of the university was established . For imparting education in the interior regions , schools were raised in principal towns which eventually were elevated to college level , with each college becoming central to many local schools ( <unk> schools ) . The earliest English @-@ medium schools appeared in 1833 in Mysore and spread across the region . In 1858 , the department of education was founded in Mysore and by 1881 , there were an estimated 2 @,@ 087 English @-@ medium schools in the state of Mysore . Higher education became available with the formation of Bangalore Central College in Bangalore ( 1870 ) , Maharaja 's College ( 1879 ) , Maharani 's College ( 1901 ) and the Mysore University ( 1916 ) in Mysore and the St. Agnes College in Mangalore ( 1921 ) . 
 Social reforms aimed at removing practices such as sati and social discrimination based upon untouchability , as well as demands for the emancipation of the lower classes , swept across India and influenced Mysore territory . In 1894 , the kingdom passed laws to abolish the marriage of girls below the age of eight . Remarriage of widowed women and marriage of destitute women was encouraged , and in 1923 , some women were granted the permission to exercise their franchise in elections . There were , however , uprisings against British authority in the Mysore territory , notably the Kodagu uprising in 1835 ( after the British dethroned the local ruler <unk> ) and the Kanara uprising of 1837 . The era of printing heralded by Christian missionaries , notably Hermann <unk> , resulted in the founding of printing presses across the kingdom . The publication of ancient and contemporary Kannada books ( such as the Pampa Bharata and the <unk> Bharata ) , a Kannada @-@ language Bible , a bilingual dictionary and a Kannada newspaper called Kannada Samachara began in the early 19th century . <unk> Venkata Rao published a consolidated Kannada history glorifying the achievements of Kannadigas in his book Karnataka <unk> Vaibhava . 
 Classical English and Sanskrit drama , and native Yakshagana musical theater influenced the Kannada stage and produced famous dramatists like Gubbi <unk> . The public began to enjoy Carnatic music through its broadcast via public address systems set up on the palace grounds . Mysore paintings , which were inspired by the Bengal Renaissance , were created by artists such as Sundarayya , Ala <unk> , and B. Venkatappa . 
 = = = Literature = = = 
 The era of the Kingdom of Mysore is considered a golden age in the development of Kannada literature . Not only was the Mysore court adorned by famous Brahmin and Veerashaiva writers and composers , the kings themselves were accomplished in the fine arts and made important contributions . While conventional literature in philosophy and religion remained popular , writings in new genres such as chronicle , biography , history , encyclopedia , novel , drama , and musical treatise became popular . A native form of folk literature with dramatic representation called Yakshagana gained popularity . A remarkable development of the later period was the influence of English literature and classical Sanskrit literature on Kannada . 
 Govinda Vaidya , a native of Srirangapatna , wrote Kanthirava Narasaraja Vijaya , a eulogy of his patron King Narasaraja I. Written in sangatya metre ( a composition meant to be rendered to the accompaniment of a musical instrument ) , the book describes the king 's court , popular music and the types of musical compositions of the age in twenty @-@ six chapters . King Chikka Devaraja was the earliest composer of the dynasty . To him is ascribed the famous treatise on music called Geetha Gopala . Though inspired by Jayadeva 's Sanskrit writing Geetha Govinda , it had an originality of its own and was written in <unk> metre . Contemporary poets who left their mark on the entire Kannada @-@ speaking region include the brahmin poet <unk> and the itinerant Veerashaiva poet Sarvajna . Female poets also played a role in literary developments , with <unk> ( the queen of Krishnaraja Wodeyar I ) , <unk> <unk> , Sri <unk> ( 1685 ) and Sanchi <unk> ( <unk> Dharma , late 17th century ) writing notable works . 
 A polyglot , King Narasaraja II authored fourteen <unk> in various languages , though all are written in Kannada script . Maharaja Krishnaraja III was a prolific writer in Kannada for which he earned the honorific Abhinava Bhoja ( a comparison to the medieval King Bhoja ) . Over forty writings are attributed to him , of which the musical treatise Sri <unk> and a poetical romance called <unk> <unk> written in two versions , a sangatya and a drama , are most well known . Under the patronage of the Maharaja , Kannada literature began its slow and gradual change towards modernity . <unk> Narayana 's <unk> ( " The Seal Casket " , 1823 ) is the earliest work that has touches of modern prose . However , the turning point came with the historically important Adbhuta Ramayana ( 1895 ) and <unk> ( 1898 ) by <unk> , whom the Kannada scholar Narasimha Murthy considers " a Janus like figure " of modern Kannada literature . <unk> has deftly handled an ancient epic from an entirely modern viewpoint . 
 <unk> Shastry , a native of Mysore and a luminary in the court of Maharaja Krishnaraja III and Maharaja Chamaraja X , is known as the " Father of Kannada theatre " ( Kannada Nataka Pitamaha ) . He authored dramas in Kannada and translated William Shakespeare 's " Othello " to <unk> Charite . His well @-@ known translations from Sanskrit to Kannada are many and include Kalidasa and <unk> Shakuntala . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Under Maharaja Krishnaraja III and his successors – Chamaraja X , Krishnaraja IV and the last ruler , Jayachamaraja , the Mysore court came to be the largest and most renowned patron of music . While the Tanjore and Travancore courts also extended great patronage and emphasised preservation of the art , the unique combination of royal patronage of individual musicians , founding of music schools to kindle public interest and a patronage of European music publishers and producers set Mysore apart . Maharaja Krishnaraja III , himself a musician and musicologist of merit , composed a number of <unk> ( light lyrics ) and devotional songs in Kannada under the title Anubhava <unk> . His compositions bear the nom de plume ( mudra ) " Chamundi ' " or ' " Chamundeshwari ' " , in honour of the Wodeyar family deity . His successor Chamaraja X founded the Oriental Library in 1891 to house music books and also commissioned phonograph recordings of several musicians for the palace library . 
 Under Krishnaraja IV , art received further patronage . A distinct school of music which gave importance to raga and bhava evolved . The Royal School of Music founded at the palace helped <unk> teaching of the art . Carnatic compositions were printed and the European staff notation came to be employed by royal musicians . Western music was also encouraged – Margaret Cousins ' piano concerto with the Palace Orchestra marked the celebrations of Beethoven 's centenary in Bangalore . Maharaja Jayachamaraja , also a renowned composer of Carnatic <unk> ( a musical composition ) , sponsored a series of recordings of Russian composer Nikolas Medtner and others . The court ensured that Carnatic music also kept up with the times . Gramophone recordings of the palace band were made and sold commercially . Attention was paid to " technology of the concert " . Lavish sums were spent on acquiring various instruments including the unconventional horn violin , theremin and <unk> , a mechanical music player . 
 The Mysore court was home to several renowned experts ( <unk> ) of the time . Veena <unk> , a court musician during the rule of Maharaja Chamaraja X , is considered one of the greatest exponents of the veena . His achievements in classical music won Mysore a premier place in the art of instrumental Carnatic music and he was given the honorific <unk> <unk> by Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV . Mysore <unk> was a noted musician and composer in Sanskrit and Telugu from Mysore . He holds the unique distinction of being patronised by four generations of Mysore kings and rulers and for being court musician to three of them . H.L. Muthiah <unk> was another musician @-@ composer who adorned the Mysore court . Considered one of the most important composers of the post @-@ Tyagaraja period , he is credited with about 400 compositions in Sanskrit , Kannada , Telugu and Tamil under the pen name " <unk> " . Among violinists , T. Chowdiah emerged as one of the most accomplished exponents of the time . He is known to have mastered the seven @-@ stringed violin . Chowdiah was appointed court musician by Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV in 1939 and received such titles as " Sangeeta Ratna " and " Sangeeta Kalanidhi " . He is credited with compositions in Kannada , Telugu and Sanskrit under the pen name " <unk> " . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The architectural style of courtly and royal structures in the kingdom underwent profound changes during British rule – a mingling of European traditions with native elements . The Hindu temples in the kingdom were built in typical South Indian Dravidian style – a modest version of the Vijayanagara building idiom . When in power , Tipu Sultan constructed a palace and a mosque in Srirangapatna , his capital . However , it is the city of Mysore that is best known for its royal palaces , earning it the nickname " City of Palaces " . The city 's main palace , the Mysore Palace , is also known as the Amba Vilas Palace . The original complex was destroyed by fire and a new palace was commissioned by the Queen @-@ Regent and designed by the English architect Henry Irwin in 1897 . The overall design is a combination of Hindu , Islamic , Indo @-@ Saracenic and Moorish styles , which for the first time in India , used cast iron columns and roof frames . The striking feature of the exterior is the granite columns that support cusped arches on the portico , a tall tower whose finial is a gilded dome with an umbrella ( <unk> ) on it , and groups of other domes around it . The interior is richly decorated with marbled walls and a <unk> ceiling on which are sculptures of Hindu deities . The Durbar hall leads to an inner private hall through silver doors . This opulent room has floor <unk> that are inlaid with semi @-@ precious stones , and a stained glass roof supported centrally by columns and arches . The marriage hall ( Kalyana mantapa ) in the palace complex is noted for its stained glass octagonal dome with peacock motifs . 
 The Lalitha Mahal Palace was built in 1921 by E.W. <unk> under the commission of Maharaja Krishnaraja IV . The architectural style is called " Renaissance " and exhibits concepts from English manor houses and Italian <unk> . The central dome is believed to be modelled on St. Paul 's Cathedral in London . Other important features are the Italian marble staircase , the polished wooden flooring in the banquet and dance halls , and the Belgian cut glass lamps . The <unk> Palace was commissioned in 1861 and was completed in 1910 . The three @-@ storeyed building with attractive domes , finials and cupolas was the venue of many a royal celebration . It is now called the Chamarajendra Art Gallery and houses a rich collection of artifacts . 
 The Mysore University campus , also called " Manasa Gangotri " , is home to several architecturally interesting buildings . Some of them are in European style and were completed in the late 19th century . They include the Jayalakshmi Vilas mansion , the Crawford Hall , the Oriental Research Institute ( built between 1887 and 1891 ) with its Ionic and Corinthian columns , and the district offices ( <unk> <unk> , 1887 ) . The <unk> <unk> , which initially served as the office of the British commissioner , has an octagonal dome and a finial that adds to its beauty . The maharaja 's summer palace , built in 1880 , is called the <unk> Mahal , and initially served as a school for royalty . The Rajendra Vilas Palace , built in the Indo @-@ British style atop the Chamundi Hill , was commissioned in 1922 and completed in 1938 by Maharaja Krishnaraja IV . Other royal mansions built by the Mysore rulers were the <unk> Mahal in Mysore and the Bangalore Palace in Bangalore , a structure built on the lines of England 's Windsor Castle . The Central Food Technical Research Institute ( <unk> Mansion ) , built in baroque European renaissance style , was once the residence of princess <unk> <unk> , a sister of Maharaja Krishnaraja IV . Its extensive pilaster work and mosaic flooring are noteworthy . 
 Most famous among the many temples built by the Wodeyars is the Chamundeshwari Temple atop the Chamundi Hill . The earliest structure here was consecrated in the 12th century and was later patronised by the Mysore rulers . Maharaja Krishnaraja III added a Dravidian @-@ style gopuram in 1827 . The temple has silver @-@ plated doors with images of deities . Other images include those of the Hindu god Ganesha and of Maharaja Krishnaraja III with his three queens . Surrounding the main palace in Mysore and inside the fort are a group of temples , built in various periods . The Prasanna Krishnaswamy Temple ( 1829 ) , the <unk> Swamy Temple whose earliest structures date to 1499 , the <unk> Swamy Temple ( late 16th century ) , the Shweta Varaha Swamy Temple built by Purnaiah with a touch of Hoysala style of architecture , the Prasanna Venkataramana Swami Temple ( 1836 ) notable for 12 murals of the Wodeyar rulers . Well @-@ known temples outside Mysore city are the yali ( " mythical beast " ) pillared Venkataramana temple built in the late 17th century in the Bangalore fort , and the Ranganatha temple in Srirangapatna . 
 Tipu Sultan built a wooden colonnaded palace called the Dariya Daulat Palace ( lit , " garden of the wealth of the sea " ) in Srirangapatna in 1784 . Built in the Indo @-@ Saracenic style , the palace is known for its intricate woodwork consisting of ornamental arches , striped columns and floral designs , and paintings . The west wall of the palace is covered with murals depicting Tipu Sultan 's victory over Colonel Baillie 's army at Pollilur , near Kanchipuram in 1780 . One mural shows Tipu enjoying the fragrance of a bouquet of flowers while the battle is in progress . In that painting , the French soldiers ' moustaches distinguish them from the <unk> British soldiers . Also in Srirangapatna is the Gumbaz mausoleum , built by Tipu Sultan in 1784 . It houses the graves of Tipu and Haider Ali . The granite base is capped with a dome built of brick and pilaster . 
 = = Military technology = = 
 The first iron @-@ cased and metal @-@ cylinder rocket artillery were developed by Tipu Sultan and his father Hyder Ali , in the 1780s . He successfully used these metal @-@ cylinder rockets against the larger forces of the British East India Company during the Anglo @-@ Mysore Wars . The Mysore rockets of this period were much more advanced than what the British had seen , chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant ; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missile ( up to 2 km ( 1 mi ) range ) . After Tipu 's eventual defeat in the Fourth Anglo @-@ Mysore War and the capture of the Mysore iron rockets , they were influential in British rocket development , inspiring the Congreve rocket , which was soon put into use in the Napoleonic Wars . 
 According to Stephen Oliver Fought and John F. <unk> , Jr. in Encyclopædia Britannica ( 2008 ) : 
 Hyder Ali , prince of Mysore , developed war rockets with an important change : the use of metal cylinders to contain the combustion powder . Although the hammered soft iron he used was crude , the bursting strength of the container of black powder was much higher than the earlier paper construction . Thus a greater internal pressure was possible , with a resultant greater thrust of the propulsive jet . The rocket body was lashed with leather thongs to a long bamboo stick . Range was perhaps up to three @-@ quarters of a mile ( more than a kilometre ) . Although individually these rockets were not accurate , dispersion error became less important when large numbers were fired rapidly in mass attacks . They were particularly effective against cavalry and were hurled into the air , after lighting , or skimmed along the hard dry ground . Tipu Sultan , continued to develop and expand the use of rocket weapons , reportedly increasing the number of rocket troops from 1 @,@ 200 to a corps of 5 @,@ 000 . In battles at Seringapatam in 1792 and 1799 these rockets were used with considerable effect against the British . " 
 = Hurricane Olaf ( 2003 ) = 
 Hurricane Olaf was a minimal hurricane that impacted Mexico in October 2003 . A tropical wave became better organized on October 2 to the south @-@ southeast of Acapulco and developed into a depression the next day . It strengthened into Tropical Storm Olaf six hours after forming . Continued intensification occurred , and Olaf reached its peak strength as a Category 1 hurricane with 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) winds on October 5 and developed a partial eyewall . The storm soon became disorganized and was only a hurricane for six hours , before re @-@ curving towards the Mexican coast . The cyclone made landfall near Manzanillo , Colima , on October 7 and soon dissipated overland . The storm caused severe flooding in the states of Jalisco and Guanajuato . However , no fatalities were reported . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Olaf formed from a tropical wave that left the coast of Africa on September 17 . Over the next two weeks it moved westbound into the East Pacific Ocean . Initially , the wave was not in an environment conductive for further development . However , on October 2 , a low @-@ level circulation was noted on satellite imagery . This circulation quickly became better defined over the next several hours while located 400 miles ( 645 km ) south of Acapulco , Mexico . The next day , Dvorak Classifications , a tool that estimates a tropical cyclone intensity , were placed at 1 @.@ 5 . This is equivalent to winds of around 30 mph ( 50 km / h ) . In addition , a ship nearby reported winds of 35 mph ( 45 km / h ) . Microwave imagery also indicated that the center was near the associated convection . Based on this , the system was upgraded into a tropical depression . 
 Initially , wind shear from nearby Tropical Storm Nora was expect to weaken the system . However , the depression was soon upgraded into a tropical storm . Moving northwest , it steadily intensified into a moderate tropical storm late on October 3 . The next day , Olaf weakened slightly ; it soon intensified into a strong tropical storm roughly 24 hours later . At that time , it was noted that additional intensification was likely . On October 5 , radar imagery indicated a partial eyewall . Based on this , Olaf was upgraded into a minimal Category 1 hurricane . It reached it peak intensity at 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 987 millibars . Olaf was hurricane for only six hours , but operationally it was believed had been a hurricane for much longer . This is because that the center was initially believed to be further north , closer to the deep convection . 
 Shortly after reaching its peak , Olaf became disorganized . Olaf weakened steadily while the storms motion slowed down . By early October 6 , Olaf was only a minimal tropical storm as the system recurved northwest . However , Olaf rapidly reorganized that afternoon and the National Hurricane Center re @-@ assessed the intensity at 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . Continued restrengthening occurred , and by October 8 Olaf made landfall wind winds of 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) near Manzanillo , Mexico . Shortly thereafter , Olaf weakened rapidly over the high terrain of the coast . Within 24 hours , Olaf had dissipated inland .

 While Olaf was at peak strength , a tropical storm warning issued for Punta San Telmo to Lazaro Cardenas and a hurricane warning was issued from Punta San Telmo to San Blas , including the Islas Marias . The next day , the tropical storm warning was extended to include Manzanillo . At that same time , a hurricane watch was issued from San Blas to Mazatlán . In addition , hurricane warning was extended to include areas from Manzanillo to San Blas including the Islas Marias . Thee hours later , when Olaf was revealed to be much weaker , the hurricane warnings and hurricane watches were canceled . However , the tropical storm warnings remained in effect until October 7 . A yellow alert was declared in the Mexican states of Michoacán , Colima , and Jalisco , and a green alert was declared in Baja California Sur , Sinaloa , Nayarit , and Guerrero . Local authorities also opened shelters . 
 Olaf was a part of a rainy year in Mexico , producing more rain than Hurricane Nora . Although no deaths were reported , flooding caused serve damage to roadways and crops in the Mexican state of Jalisco . In the same state , more than 12 @,@ 000 homes were damaged . In the state of Guanajuato , an estimated total of 15 @,@ 000 people were impacted from the floods . In addition , two communities were isolated . After the hurricane , a program wanted donation from food to basic home supplies . Moisture from the remnants of Nora and Olaf interacted with an upper @-@ level low to produce heavy rainfall across Texas , producing flooding near Waco that forced a family to evacuate in McGregor . The floodwaters closed portions of Interstate 35 , U.S. Route 84 , and Texas State Highway 36 . It also spawned a tornado in Sugar Land that damaged four buildings , including a school . 
 = South Park : The Stick of Truth = 
 South Park : The Stick of Truth is a 2014 role @-@ playing video game developed by Obsidian Entertainment , in collaboration with South Park Digital Studios , and published by Ubisoft for PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 , and Microsoft Windows . Based on the American adult animated television series South Park , The Stick of Truth follows The New Kid , who has moved to the eponymous town and becomes involved in an epic role @-@ play fantasy war involving humans , wizards , and elves , who are fighting for control of the all @-@ powerful Stick of Truth . Their game quickly escalates out of control , bringing them into conflict with aliens , Nazi zombies , and gnomes , threatening the entire town with destruction . 
 Development began in 2009 after South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone approached Obsidian about making a role @-@ playing game designed to look exactly like the television series . Parker and Stone were involved throughout the game 's production : they wrote its script , consulted on the design , and as in the television program they voiced many of the characters . The Stick of Truth 's production was turbulent ; its release date was postponed several times from its initial date in March 2013 to its eventual release in March 2014 . There was also a change of publisher following the bankruptcy of THQ , the original publisher . The game 's rights were purchased by Ubisoft in early 2013 . 
 The Stick of Truth was subject to censorship in some regions because of its content , which includes abortions and Nazi imagery ; Parker and Stone replaced the scenes with detailed explanations of what occurs in each scene . The game was released to positive reviews , which praised the comedic script , visual style , and faithfulness to the source material . It received criticism for a lack of challenging combat and technical issues that slowed or impeded progress . A sequel , South Park : The Fractured but Whole , is scheduled for release in December 2016 , alongside a PlayStation 4 and Xbox One release of The Stick of Truth . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 South Park : The Stick of Truth is a role @-@ playing video game that is viewed from a 2.5D , third @-@ person perspective . The player controls the New Kid as he explores the fictional Colorado town of South Park . The player can freely move around the town although some areas remain inaccessible until specific points in the story are reached . Notable characters from the series — including Cartman , Butters , Stan , and Kyle — join the New Kid 's party and accompany him on his quests , though only one character can be active at any time The game features a fast travel system , allowing the player to call on the character Timmy to quickly transport them to any other visited fast travel station . At the beginning of the game , the player selects one of four character archetypes ; the Fighter , Thief , Mage ( which represent standard fantasy types ) , and the Jew . The Jew class specializes in " Jew @-@ jitsu " and long @-@ range attacks . Each class has specific abilities ; armor and weapons are not limited by class , allowing a Mage to focus on melee attacks like a Fighter . 
 The New Kid and his allies possess a variety of melee , ranged , and magic attacks . Experience points rewarded for completing tasks and winning battles allow the New Kid to level up , unlocking new abilities and upgrades such as increasing the number of enemies an attack hits or the amount of damage inflicted . Magic is represented by the characters ' ability to fart ; different farts are used to accomplish specific tasks . For example , the " Cup @-@ A @-@ Spell " allows the player to throw a fart to interact with a distant object , the " Nagasaki " destroys blockades , and the " Sneaky Squeaker " can be thrown to create a sound that distracts enemies . Attacks can be augmented with farts if the player has enough magical energy . 
 The player has access to unlockable abilities that can open new paths of exploration , such as shrinking to access small areas like vents , teleportation which allows the player to reach otherwise unreachable platforms , and farts which trigger an explosion that defeats nearby enemies when combined with a naked flame . Actions committed against enemies outside of battle affects them in combat ; the player or opponent who strikes first to trigger a fight will have the first turn in battle . Combat takes place in a battle area separate from the open game world . Battles use turn @-@ based gameplay and each character takes a turn to attack or defend before yielding to the next character . 
 During the player 's turn , a radial wheel listing the available options — class @-@ based basic melee attacks , special attacks , long @-@ ranged attacks , and support items — appears . Basic attacks are used to hit unarmored enemies and wear down shields ; heavy attacks weaken armored enemies . A flashing icon indicates that attacks or blocks can be enhanced to inflict more damage , or mitigate incoming attacks more effectively . Each special attack costs a set amount of " Power Points " or " PP " ( pronounced <unk> ) to activate . Only one party member can join the player in battle . Certain characters , such as Tuong Lu Kim , Mr Hankey , Jesus , and Mr. Slave can be summoned during battle to deliver a powerful attack capable of defeating several enemies simultaneously ; Jesus sprays damaging gunfire , while Mr. Slave squeezes an enemy into his rectum , scaring his allies away . 
 One support item can be used each turn , including items that restore health or provide beneficial status effects that improve the character 's abilities . Weapons and armor can be enhanced using optional " strap @-@ ons " , such as fake vampire teeth , bubble gum , or a <unk> claw . These items can cause enemies to bleed and lose health , weaken enemy armor , boost player health or steal health from opponents , and disgust foes to make them " grossed out " and cause them to vomit . Additionally , the " strap @-@ ons " can set opponents on fire , electrocute them , or freeze them . Some enemies are immune to one or more of these effects . Enemies can deflect certain attacks entirely ; those in a riposte stance will deflect any melee attack , requiring the use of ranged weapons , while those in reflect stance will deflect ranged weapons . 
 The player is encouraged to explore the wider game world to find Chinpokomon toys or new friends who are added to the character 's Facebook page . Collecting friends allows the player to unlock perks that permanently improve the New Kid 's statistics , providing extra damage or resistance to negative effects . The character 's Facebook page also serves as the game 's main menu , containing the inventory and a quest journal . The Stick of Truth features several mini @-@ games , including defecating by repeatedly tapping a button that rewards the player with feces that can be thrown at enemies to trigger the " grossed out " effect , performing an abortion , and using an anal probe . Some of these scenes are absent from some versions of the game because of censorship .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 South Park : The Stick of Truth is set in the fictional town South Park in the Colorado Rocky Mountains . The main character , whom the player controls , is the New Kid — nicknamed " Douchebag " — a silent protagonist who has recently moved to the town . Befriending the local boys , he becomes involved in an epic role @-@ playing fantasy game featuring wizards and warriors battling for control of the Stick of Truth , a twig that possesses limitless power . 
 The humans , led by Wizard King Cartman , make their home in the Kingdom of Kupa Keep , a makeshift camp built in Cartman 's backyard ; among their number are paladin Butters , thief Craig , Clyde , cleric Token , Tweek , and Kenny — a young boy who dresses as a princess . The humans ' rivals are the drow elves , who live in the elven kingdom in the backyard of their leader , High Jew Elf Kyle ; they also include the warrior Stan and Jimmy the bard . The boys conduct their game throughout the town , the surrounding forest , and even into Canada ( represented as a pixelated overhead 16 @-@ bit RPG ) .

 = = = Plot = = = 
 The New Kid has moved with his parents to South Park to escape his forgotten past . He quickly allies with Butters , Princess Kenny and their leader Cartman . Nicknamed " Douchebag " , the New Kid is introduced to the coveted Stick of Truth . Shortly thereafter , the elves attack Kupa Keep and take the Stick . With the help of Cartman 's best warriors , Douchebag recovers the Stick from Jimmy . Cartman banishes Clyde from the group for failing to defend the Stick from the elves . That night , Douchebag and several town residents are abducted by aliens . Douchebag escapes his confinement with the help of Stan 's father , Randy , and crashes the alien ship into the town 's mall . 
 By morning , the UFO crash site has been sealed off by the government , who has put out a cover @-@ story that claims a Taco Bell is being built . Douchebag visits Kupa Keep and learns that the Stick has again been stolen by the elves . Cartman and Kyle task Douchebag with recruiting the Goth kids for their respective sides , each claiming that the other has the Stick . Randy agrees to help Douchebag recruit the Goths after Douchebag infiltrates the crash site and discovers that government agents are plotting to blow up the town in order to destroy an alien goo released from the ship . The goo turns living creatures into Nazi Zombies ; an infected person escapes government containment , unleashing the virus on South Park . 
 That night , Cartman or Kyle ( dependent on which character the player chooses to follow ) leads his side against the other at the school . Here , the children learn that Clyde stole the Stick as revenge for his banishment . Clyde rallies defectors from the humans and elves , and uses the alien goo to create an army of Nazi Zombies . The humans and elves join together to oppose Clyde but there are too few to fight him . Later , Gnomes steal Douchebag 's underpants ; after defeating them , Douchebag gains the ability to change size at will . 
 Out of desperation , Douchebag is told to invite the girls to play . They agree to join after Douchebag infiltrates an abortion clinic and travels across Canada to discover which of their friends is spreading gossip . Flanked by the girls , kindergarten pirates , and Star Trek role @-@ players , the humans and elves attack Clyde 's dark tower . Randy arrives and reveals that the government agents have planted a nuclear device in Mr. Slave 's anus to blow up South Park , forcing Douchebag to shrink and enter Mr. Slave to disarm the bomb . After exiting Mr. Slave , Douchebag finally confronts Clyde and is forced to fight a resurrected Nazi Zombie Chef ; Chef is defeated . Clyde decides he is not playing any more and Cartman kicks him from the tower . 
 The government agents arrive , revealing that Douchebag went into hiding to escape them because of his ability to make friends on social networks such as Facebook , which the government wanted to use for its own ends . Learning of the Stick 's supposed power , the chief agent takes it and bargains with Douchebag to help him use it . Douchebag refuses but Princess Kenny betrays the group , uses the Stick to fight them and infects himself with the Nazi Zombie virus . Unable to defeat Nazi Zombie Princess Kenny , Cartman tells Douchebag to break their sacred rule by farting on Kenny 's balls , which he does . The resulting explosion defeats Kenny and cures the town of the Nazi Zombie virus . In the epilogue as South Park is rebuilt , the group retrieves the Stick of Truth ; they decide its power is too great for any person to hold and throw it into Stark 's Pond . 
 = = Development = = 
 Development of South Park : The Stick of Truth took four years , beginning in 2009 when South Park co @-@ creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone contacted Obsidian Entertainment to discuss their desire to make a South Park game . Parker , a fan of Obsidian games , including Fallout : New Vegas ( 2010 ) , wanted to create a role @-@ playing game , a genre which he and Stone had enjoyed since their childhoods . Parker and Stone insisted that the game must replicate the show 's visual style . Parker 's original concept was for a South Park version of the 2011 role @-@ playing fantasy game The Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim , and he estimated the first script he produced to be 500 pages long . The South Park Digital Studios team animated a concept of the game 's opening scene to show what they wanted to accomplish with Obsidian in terms of appearance and gameplay mechanics . While the series had inspired several licensed games , such as South Park ( 1998 ) and South Park Rally ( 1999 ) , Parker and Stone were not involved in these games ' development and later criticized the titles ' quality . Negative reaction to those games made the pair protective of their property and led to their greater involvement on The Stick of Truth ; they refused several requests to license the series for new ventures . 
 Stone and Parker worked closely with Obsidian on the project , sometimes having two @-@ to @-@ three hour meetings over four consecutive days . They worked with Obsidian until two weeks before the game was shipped . Their involvement extended beyond creative input ; their company initially financed the game , believing that a game based on the controversial television show would struggle to receive financial support from publishers without them placing restrictions on the content to make it more marketable . The initial funding was intended to allow Obsidian to develop enough of the game to show a more complete concept to potential publishers . In December 2011 , THQ announced that they would work with Obsidian on South Park : The Game , as it was then known . This partnership developed into a publishing arrangement after South Park owner Viacom , having grown wary of video games , cut its funding . Obsidian was aware when it signed with THQ that the latter was experiencing financial difficulties . 
 In March 2012 , Microsoft canceled Obsidian 's upcoming Xbox One project codenamed " North Carolina " after seven months of development , resulting in the layoff of between 20 and 30 employees , including members of the Stick of Truth team . In May 2012 , the game 's final title was announced . In December 2012 , THQ filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy after suffering several product release failures . The Stick of Truth remained on schedule as THQ tried to use the bankruptcy period to restructure and return its business to profit , but the company failed to find a buyer and a Delaware court ordered that THQ was worth more if its assets were sold individually . 
 The rights to The Stick of Truth were auctioned in late December 2012 ; Obsidian was not made aware of the sale until the auction was announced . South Park Digital Studios filed an objection to the auction , stating that THQ did not have the authority to sell the publishing rights and that THQ had been granted exclusive use of specific South Park trademarks and copyrights . South Park Digital also argued that even if the rights were sold , THQ would still owe them US $ 2 @.@ 27 million and that they held the option of reclaiming all elements of the game and South Park related creations . THQ requested that the court overrule South Park Digital , stating that their rights were exclusive and thus transferable . On January 24 , 2013 , the United States bankruptcy court approved the sale of THQ 's assets , including The Stick of Truth . 
 The rights were bought by Ubisoft for US $ 3 @.@ 2 million . Within three weeks they had decided that the game required significant changes , pushing its release date back by six months to March 2014 . Parker and Stone , with input from a Ubisoft creative consultant , concluded that their original vision would take too long and would be too costly to produce . In a 2014 interview , Obsidian leader Feargus Urquhart said he could not comment on changes that were made following Ubisoft 's involvement . South Park : The Stick of Truth was officially released to manufacturing on February 12 , 2014 . Following its release , Stone said that the work involved in making the game was much more than he and Parker had anticipated . He said , " I 'll [ admit ] to the fact that we retooled stuff that we didn 't like and we worked on the game longer than other people would 've liked us to " . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 During early discussions with Obsidian , Parker and Stone were adamant that the game should faithfully replicate the show 's unique 2D @-@ style visuals , which are based on cutout animation . Obsidian provided proofs of concept that they could achieve the South Park look ; Stone and Parker were satisfied with this . Skyrim was the game 's initial influence and further inspiration came from the 1994 role @-@ playing game EarthBound . Parker and Stone said that the blended 2D / 3D visuals of Paper Mario and the silent protagonist Link from The Legend of Zelda series also provided inspiration for the design . The characters ' costumes and classes are taken from the 2002 South Park episode " The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers " . Obsidian created various fantasy @-@ styled items , armor , and weapons but Parker and Stone told them to " make it <unk> " to create the impression that the children had found or made the objects themselves ; weapons consisted of golf clubs , hammers , suction cup arrows and wooden swords , while bathrobes , oven mitt gloves , and towels worn as capes served as clothing . South Park studios provided Obsidian with access to the show 's full archive of art assets , allowing Obsidian to include previously unused ideas , such as discarded Chinpokomon designs . Actors from the show provided voice work , and Obsidian was given access to South Park 's audio resources , including sound effects , music , and the show 's composer Jamie Dunlap . 
 Describing the writing of a comedy script for a game in which lines of dialog may be heard repeatedly and jokes could appear dated , Stone said : 
 We write jokes , and the jokes are funny . With a game , the fourth , fifth , sixth , 80th , 100 millionth time you 've seen that joke it becomes not funny , then you lose faith in it , and then you question it , and you go round this emotional circle ... We 've always liked fresh @-@ baked stuff a little better but , with a video game , it doesn 't work that way . But the game isn 't just a collection of funny South Park scenes , hopefully it 's more than that . 
 Like the show , The Stick of Truth satirizes political and social issues including abortion , race relations , anal probes , drug addiction , sex , extreme violence , and poverty . Creative consultant Jordan Thomas said , " The way we looked at [ humor ] was if this moment was a hot button for the audience , should we make it worse , because [ Stone and Parker ] love to push boundaries and their default response was definitely not to back down , but the really healthy counterbalance was , can we make it funnier — and the answer was often yes " . 
 The game underwent several changes during its development . While the final game features four playable character types ( Fighter , Thief , Mage , and Jew ) , an early version featured five playable classes : Paladin , Wizard , Rogue , Adventurer , and Jew . The latter was described as a cross between a Monk and a Paladin , that is " high risk , high reward " and strongest when closest to death . The game had included other enemies and locations , including vampire children who were fought in a cemetery and church , hippies , a mission to recover Cartman 's doll from the Ginger children , and a boss fight against a large , winged monster . The Crab People had a larger role and shared a demilitarized zone with the Underpants Gnomes — only one Crab Person appears in the final game — and Mr Hankey and his family lived in a large , Christmas @-@ themed village which became a small house in the town 's sewers . While under THQ 's publishing deal , the developers planned that the Xbox 360 version would support the console 's input device , Kinect , enabling players to give characters voice commands , taunt enemies , and insult Cartman — to which the character would respond . Exclusive Xbox 360 downloadable content ( DLC ) including the Mysterion Superhero pack and Good Times with Weapons packs each featuring a unique weapon , outfit , and special attack , and three story @-@ based campaign expansions was announced . These features were not present in the Ubisoft release .

 South Park : The Stick of Truth was released in North America on March 4 , 2014 , for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles , and Microsoft Windows . It was released on March 6 in Australia and on March 7 in Europe . The game had been scheduled for release on March 5 , 2013 , but this was postponed two months by then @-@ publisher THQ . After THQ filed for bankruptcy in January 2013 , Ubisoft purchased the rights to publish the game and did not specify a release date . By May 2013 , Ubisoft had confirmed that it would be released that year after it was omitted from their upcoming games release schedule . On September 26 , 2013 , Ubisoft announced that The Stick of Truth would be released in December 2013 , but in October 2013 the game 's release was again postponed until March 2014 . The game was scheduled for release on March 6 , 2014 in Germany and Austria , but it was delayed after the localized version of the game was found to contain Nazi references . A PlayStation 4 and Xbox One version of the game is scheduled for release on December 6 , 2016 . 
 A collector 's edition called the " Grand Wizard Edition " containing the game , a 6 @-@ inch figure of Grand Wizard Cartman created by Kidrobot , a map of the South Park kingdom , and the Ultimate Fellowship DLC was made available . The Ultimate Fellowship content includes four outfits with different abilities ; the Necromancer Sorcerer outfit provides increased fire damage , the Rogue Assassin outfit rewards the player with extra money , the Ranger Elf outfit raises weapon damage , and the Holy Defender outfit increases defense . Additional content included the Super Samurai Spaceman pack containing three outfits ; the Superhero costume provides a buff at the start of battle , the Samurai costume provides a buff on defeating an enemy , and the Spaceman costume provides a defensive shield . 
 In November and December 2013 , the South Park television series featured the " Black Friday " trilogy of episodes — " Black Friday " , " A Song of Ass and Fire " , and " Titties and Dragons " — which was a narrative prequel to the game and featured the characters wearing outfits and acting out roles similar to those in the game . The episodes satirized the game 's lengthy development ; in " Black Friday " Cartman tells Kyle not to " pre @-@ order a game that some assholes in California haven ’ t even finished making yet " , referring to California @-@ based Obsidian , while " Titties and Dragons " concludes with an advertisement announcing the game 's release date accompanied by Butters declaring his skepticism . Discussing " Black Friday " , IGN said that it " felt like a sneak peek " of the game and if nothing else , was " good marketing " in light of the game 's numerous delays . 
 = = = Censorship = = = 
 Shortly before the game 's release , Ubisoft announced that it would voluntarily censor seven scenes , calling it a " market decision made by Ubisoft EMEA " and not a response to input from censors . PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions were affected in European territories , the Middle East , Africa , and Russia , while the Microsoft Windows version remained uncensored . The censorship affected all formats in Australia , Singapore , Hong Kong , Germany , Austria , and Taiwan . The North American release was the only version that was uncensored on all formats . The German version was specifically censored because of the use of Nazi and Hitler @-@ related imagery , including swastikas and Nazi salutes , which are illegal in that country . A spokesman for the European video game content rating system Pan European Game Information ( PEGI ) confirmed that the uncensored version had been submitted and approved for release with an 18 rating , meaning the game would be acceptable for people over eighteen years of age . Ubisoft resubmitted the censored version without input from PEGI ; this version was passed with an 18 @-@ rating . 
 The scenes Ubisoft removed depict anal probing by aliens and the player @-@ character performing an abortion . In their place , the game displays a still image of a statue holding its face in its hand , with an explicit description of events depicted in the scene . In Australia , the same scenes were removed because the Australian Classification Board refused to rate the game for release due to the depiction of sexual violence — specifically the child player @-@ character being subjected to anal probing and the interactive abortion scene . Like the European version , these scenes were replaced with a placeholder card with an explanation of what was removed on a background image of a koala crying . 
 Discussing the situation , Stone said he had been told changes were required for the game to be released and that he and Parker inserted the placeholder images so the censorship would not be hidden . He called the censorship a double standard that the pair resisted , and said he felt it did not ruin the game and the cards allowed them to mock the changes .

 South Park : The Stick of Truth received positive reviews from critics . Aggregating review website Metacritic provides a score of 85 out of 100 from 48 critics for the Microsoft Windows version , 85 out of 100 from 31 critics for the PlayStation 3 version , and 82 out of 100 from 33 critics for the Xbox 360 version . 
 The game was considered a successful adaptation of licensed material to a video game , with critics describing it as one of the most faithful video game adaptations ever , such that moving the player @-@ character was like walking on the set of the show . GamesRadar said that The Stick of Truth was to South Park as Batman : Arkham Asylum was to the Batman franchise in terms of reverence to the source material while breaking new ground in video games . They praised the " open @-@ world South Park to explore , with a solid 12 – 14 hours of inside jokes , obscure references , and humor that pulls from 17 TV seasons ' worth of social commentary and offensive humor . " Computer and Video Games said that the game contained so many references to the show 's history that it made Batman : Arkham City appear sparse . Destructoid said that the ability to walk around the detailed town provided a sense of wonderment similar to exploring The Simpsons ' home town in Virtual Springfield . The visual translation was highlighted as a significant component of game 's success , appearing indistinguishable from an episode of the show and providing a consistent aesthetic that remained faithful to the series while being original to gaming . Some reviewers said that the art style was occasionally detrimental , obscuring objects and prompts , and that repetitive use of animations grew stale over the course of the game . Computer and Video Games said that Obsidian had built a game world that seemed as though it had always existed . 
 Reviewers consistently highlighted its comedic achievement . Game Informer said it is frequently hilarious , ranking it among the best comedic games ever released . IGN praised The Stick of Truth for its witty and intelligent satire of the role @-@ playing genre , while others said that as well as being consistently funny , the game was suitably boisterous , shocking , provocative , self @-@ effacing , and fearless in its desire to offend . Many reviewers agreed that much of the content was more appealing to South Park fans ; some jokes are lost on the uninitiated but others said that enough context was provided for most jokes to be funny regardless of players ' familiarity with the source material . IGN said that it is the game South Park fans have always wanted , but some reviewers said that without the South Park license , the game 's shallowness would be more obvious . 
 Combat received a polarized response ; critics alternately called the battles deep and satisfying or shallow and repetitive . Reviewers considered the combat mechanics to be simplistic while allowing for complex tactics , and others said that the requirement to actively defend against enemy attacks and enhance offense kept fights engaging . Others also praised the combat but considered the mechanics to be robust and elaborate , presenting a solid role @-@ playing combat system concealed under the intentionally simplistic visuals . Some reviewers said that a lack of depth made combat gradually become repetitive ; they said that even when combat is funny and engaging , by the end of the game the battles can become routine . Joystiq stated that defense was more interesting than offense because it relied on time @-@ sensitive reactions to creative enemy attacks such as Al Gore giving a presentation . Destructoid said there are too few powers available for offense for the game to remain interesting for long . GameSpot found combat was too easy and lacking in challenge because of an abundance of supplement items such as health packs that were found more frequently than they were used , and powerful abilities that quickly subdued opponents . Others disagreed , stating that the variety offered in combat , such as character abilities , allies , weapons , armor , and upgrades , ensured it always felt fun . The effects of the enhancements were sometimes considered to be confusing , and typically relying on simply equipping the highest level item available . Joystiq said the special characters that can be summoned during battle were extreme in terms of power and entertainment value . 
 IGN said that the difference between character classes such as Thief and Jew were disappointingly minimal , offering little variety or incentive to replay as another class . IGN also said some missions and side quests were tedious , and were elevated by their setting rather than their quality , while the reviewer thought the environmental puzzles were a clever option for avoiding combat and were rare enough to be enjoyable when available . However , GameSpot said the puzzles felt scripted and simple . Reviewers said that many of the gameplay functions and controls were poorly explained , making them difficult to activate ; others were critical of excessive loading times upon entering new locations and slow menus such as the Facebook panel .
