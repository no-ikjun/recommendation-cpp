 = Hualālai = 
 Hualālai ( pronounced [ <unk> ] in Hawaiian ) is an active volcano on the island of Hawaiʻi in the Hawaiian Islands . It is the westernmost , third @-@ youngest and the third most active of the five shield volcanoes that form the island of Hawaiʻi , following Kīlauea and the much larger Mauna Loa . Its peak stands 8 @,@ 271 feet ( 2 @,@ 521 m ) above sea level . Hualālai is estimated to have risen above sea level about 300 @,@ 000 years ago . Despite maintaining a very low level of activity since its last eruption in 1801 , Hualālai is still considered active , and is expected to erupt again some time within the next century . The relative unpreparedness of the residents in the area caused by the lull in activity would worsen the consequences of such an event . 
 The area near the volcano has been inhabited for centuries by Hawaiian natives , dating back to before recorded history . The coast west of Hualālai in particular had several royal complexes . The volcano is also important ecologically , is home to many rare species and several nature reserves near the summit , and is a popular hiking attraction . Today the coast near Hualālai is dotted by vacation resorts , some built on historic flows , and a National Historical Park . 
 = = Geology = = 
 = = = Structural features = = = 
 Hualālai stands at 8 @,@ 271 ft ( 2 @,@ 521 m ) with a prominence of 3 @,@ 071 ft ( 936 m ) . It is the westernmost of the five major volcanoes which form the island of Hawaiʻi . Being in the post @-@ shield stage of development , Hualālai is overall much rougher in shape and structure than the more youthful Mauna Loa and Kīlauea . Hualālai 's structure is denoted by three rift zones : a well @-@ developed one approximately 50 ° to the northwest , a moderately developed one to the southeast , and a poorly developed one trending northwards about 3 mi ( 5 km ) east of the summit . There are over 100 cinder and spatter cones arranged along these rift zones . Hualālai has no summit caldera , although there is a collapse crater about 0 @.@ 3 mi ( 0 @.@ 48 km ) across atop a small lava shield . Much of the southern slope ( above the modern town of Kailua @-@ Kona ) consists of lava flows covered by a layer of volcanic ash from 10 to 100 cm ( 4 to 39 in ) thick . In comparison with the other volcanoes of the island of Hawaiʻi , it is the third tallest , third oldest , third most active , and second smallest , making up just 7 % of the island . 
 A major <unk> of Hualālai is Puʻu Waʻawaʻa , Hawaiian for " many @-@ furrowed hill " , a volcanic cone standing 372 m ( 1 @,@ 220 ft ) tall and measuring over 1 @.@ 6 km ( 1 mi ) in diameter . It extends for 9 km ( 6 mi ) , and has a prominence of 275 m ( 902 ft ) , north of the summit at 19 ° 46 ′ 15 ″ N 155 ° 49 ′ 56 ″ W. The cone is constructed of trachyte , a type of volcanic lava that exists at no other volcano on Hawaiʻi . <unk> flows move more slowly than the typically " runny " Hawaiian lavas , a characteristic caused by its high ( over 62 % ) silica composition ( typical basalt is only 50 % silica ) . Geologists hypothesize that Puʻu Waʻawaʻa originally formed during a pumice eruption a little over 100 @,@ 000 years ago , and has continued to build itself since then , with at least three distinct trachyte flows recognized . The eruptions , although partially covered by flows from Hualālai and Mauna Loa , have built a distinctive structure known as the Puʻu <unk> ridge . 
 The westward @-@ facing flank of Hualālai forms a large underwater slump known as the North Kona slump . An area of about 1 @,@ 000 km2 ( 390 sq mi ) , the slump consists of an intricate formation of beaches and scarps 2 @,@ 000 to 4 @,@ 500 m ( 6 @,@ 600 to 14 @,@ 800 ft ) below the waterline . This area was explored more closely in a 2001 joint Japan @-@ United States project to explore the volcano 's flanks , utilizing the Remotely operated vehicle ROV Kaikō . Data collected showed that the lava flows there originated in shallow water 500 to 1 @,@ 000 m ( 1 @,@ 600 to 3 @,@ 300 ft ) deep , and that unlike similar slumps at other volcanoes , the slump at Hualālai formed gradually . 
 <unk> is a known source for xenoliths , rock from the Earth 's mantle that have been brought up in lava flows . Many prehistoric deposits , as well as those from the 1801 event , contain xenoliths of large size and abundant quantity . 
 = = = History = = = 
 Lava attributed to a shield @-@ stage Hualālai has been found just offshore of the volcano 's northwest rift zone . <unk> basalt , indicative of the submarine subphase of the volcano 's construction , has been found in wells driven into the volcano at a depth of 75 ft ( 23 m ) . These lavas persisted until an estimated 130 @,@ 000 years ago . Hualālai entered the post @-@ shield stage , the stage it is presently in , about 100 @,@ 000 years ago . Pumice and trachyte eruptions at Puʻu Waʻawaʻa may be a sign of this change . 
 Geological mapping of the volcano has indicated that as much as 80 % of the volcano 's surface has been topped by lava flows during the last 5 @,@ 000 years , entirely composed of shield alkalic basalt . More than half of this is under 3 @,@ 000 years old , and about 12 % is less than 1 @,@ 000 years of age . Between the years 1700 and 2016 , eruptions originated from six vents ; four of these lava flows poured into the sea to the west coast . 
 = = Eruptive history = = 
 Hualālai is the third most active volcano making up the island of Hawaiʻi , behind Kīlauea and Mauna Loa . Although the two larger volcanos have each erupted over 150 times in the last 1 @,@ 000 years , Hualālai has done so but 3 times . The recurrence of activity at the volcano seems to be every 200 to 300 years . 
 A recent calm period , with almost no earthquake or magmatic activity at Hualālai , has seen the growth of homes , businesses , and resorts on the mountain 's flanks . The most recent major activity at the volcano was in 1929 , when an intense earthquake swarm rocked Hualālai , most likely caused by magmatic action near the volcano 's peak . Although it has been relatively placid in the recent past , Hualālai is still potentially active , and is expected to erupt again within the next 100 years . 
 = = = Lava stratigraphy = = = 
 The USGS has divided the exposed lava flows and tephra erupted by Hualālai volcano during the last 112 @,@ 000 years into 419 rock units of 8 <unk> age groups . These are summarized in the table below : 
 = = = 1800 – 1801 eruption = = = 
 Hualālai last erupted in 1800 – 1801 . This eruption produced very fluid alkalic basalt lava flows that entered the ocean off the western tip of Hawaiʻi island . Although five vents were active at the time , only two produced flows that eventually reached the ocean . The total output volume of the flow is estimated at over 300 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ( 0 @.@ 072 cu mi ) . One volcanic vent , situated high on the slope , produced a large a 'a flow , dubbed the <unk> flow , that reached the ocean as two distinct lobes . On its way down , it overran a village and a valuable 3 mi ( 5 km ) fishing pond . There is a local legend that after the failure of several offerings of animals and other items to the gods , the flow was finally stopped when Kamehameha I threw a lock of his own hair into the fire . The Ka <unk> flow is also known for the particularly large quantity of mafic and ultramafic xenoliths that came up with it . 
 The other major outflow from the event reached the sea south of Kiholo Bay , destroying the village of <unk> . This 1801 flow , known as the <unk> flow , formed <unk> Point where Kona International Airport is now located , 11 km ( 6 @.@ 8 mi ) north of Kailua @-@ Kona . The eruption at Hualālai was concurrent with an eruption at the nearby Mauna Loa . It is theorized that , in the near past , Hualālai has had synchronous eruptions with both Mauna Loa and Kilauea . 
 = = = Recent activity = = = 
 Hualālai last erupted in 1801 . A severe earthquake swarm shook the volcano in 1929 , lasting about a month . This caused $ 100 @,@ 000 worth of damage to the Kona district ( $ 1 @.@ 2 million as of 2010 ) , and two earthquakes with magnitudes of 5 @.@ 5 and 6 @.@ 5 were felt as far away as Honolulu . This was probably caused by magma movement near the surface , but there was no surface activity or eruption . 
 The 2006 Hawaii earthquake , with epicenter just to the north in Kiholo Bay near <unk> , caused much damage in the area . 
 = = = Future monitoring = = = 
 Although Hualālai last erupted over 200 years ago , it will erupt again in the near future , as a 200 – 300 year estimated pause in activity is coming to an end . It presents a distinct hazard to the communities around it as well ; for example , in the event of an eruption similar to the 1801 event , Kailua @-@ Kona , which is 15 mi ( 24 km ) from the volcano 's summit , could be covered completely in a matter of hours . According to the USGS Lava Flow Hazard Zones , on a scale of 5 to 9 , all of Hualālai is listed as threat level 4 . For comparison , almost all of Kīlauea and Mauna Loa is listed as threat levels 1 through 3 . The flanks of the volcano do not pose a lower threat to the population than the area near the rift zones because the distance is short and the slopes are steep ; lava poses as much of a threat as it does near its source . 
 Since 1991 , the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory ( HVO ) has maintained a seismic recording station 3 km ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) east of Hualālai 's summit to monitor the volcano . During this time , not a single earthquake swarm or harmonic tremor , indicative of activity at the volcano , has occurred . Although Hualālai does experience several magnitude 4 earthquakes per year , these are attributed to a deep source off the coast of the north @-@ western rift zone and are not related to the movement of magma . The USGS is currently in the process of upgrading its aging monitoring and telemetry equipment , using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds . The agency plans to add another seismometer and three more sensors to help monitor activity . In addition , the HVO uses GPS to measure slight changes in tilt and slope of Hualālai , indicative of magmatic movement . A survey has been conducted every two years since 1986 , but as of 2010 changes have been recorded . 
 = = Human history = = 
 Hualālai has been a home to native people since ancient times . Centuries ago , the <unk> A Umi <unk> was built on the dry plateau east of the mountain . The <unk> @-@ <unk> National Historic Park lies on the shore west of Hualālai , over the site of an ancient Hawaiian settlement . Although it is called <unk> <unk> wai ( lands without water ) , the rugged volcanic terrain attracted much sea life , making it an appealing place to settle . There are two main attractions within the park : the <unk> fishpond , an area of <unk> <unk> ( <unk> fishponds ) constructed of interlocking rocks across a natural embayment on the coast , and <unk> , a former extensive settlement on the south side of the park . 
 <unk> , <unk> Bay , and <unk> Bay were favored retreats of Hawaiian royalty long before the westernization of Hawaii . It was here that Kamehameha I rested after his eight @-@ year campaign to unite the Hawaiian isles . His death in 1819 triggered social chaos . <unk> Church , built for missionaries in 1837 of lava rock and crushed coral , still stands today . Huliheʻe Palace , where many of Hawaii 's last kings spent their time , has been maintained as a museum since 1927 . 
 Today , the coast west of Hualālai is a popular location for vacation resorts , since the rain shadow of the mountain causes many sunny days . The first , Kona Village resort , was built in 1961 . Since then the Four Seasons Resort and the <unk> golf course and vacation home complex have also been built on the 1800 flow . Both the Kona Village Resort and the Four Seasons Resort were damaged by the tsunami generated by the 2011 Sendai earthquake . The Hawaii Belt Road traverses the western slopes with an upper route called the <unk> Highway and lower route named for Queen Kaʻahumanu . 
 Much of the Kona coffee crop grows on Hualālai 's western slope near the town of <unk> . The family of early coffee merchant Henry Nicholas Greenwell owned a large ranch on the western side of the volcano . The road from Kailua @-@ Kona up the slopes of Hualālai is named for Frank " Palani " Greenwell . Hawaii Route 200 known as the Saddle Road , crosses the plateau north of Hualālai , where the <unk> Training Area provides a remote training ground for the United States Army and United States Marine Corps . 
 = = Recreational significance = = 
 Hualālai 's many interesting features , most especially its volcanic cones , make it a popular destination for hikers . Although it is relatively easy to climb , much of the land at and around the summit of the volcano is owned by Kamehameha Schools , which routinely denies access to hikers attempting to climb it . As most , if not all , routes up to Hualālai pass through the estate , hiking on Hualālai is more or less illegal . However , the laws are not stringently enforced , and many hikers slip through anyway . One of the most popular mountaineering features is <unk> and its sister <unk> Pele , two pit craters on Hualālai that are the deepest on the island . <unk> Pele , also known as " Pele 's Pit " , has been explored to a depth of 862 ft ( 263 m ) , and <unk> is known to be even deeper . The walls are scalable with the proper technical equipment . 
 = = Ecology and environment = = 
 Although some of Hualālai is bare volcanic rock , most of it is covered by some form of vegetation . Bushes , ferns , and grass are common , and even a few <unk> <unk> trees ( Metrosideros polymorpha ) grow along the summit . Many of the collapse craters in particular have vegetation , and a few even have respectably @-@ sized " vertical forests " inside , including several Eucalyptus tree groves . The volcano is populated by many birds and animals ; the coast in particular attracts many fish and sea @-@ dependent animals , such as the green sea turtle ( Chelonia mydas ) and the black @-@ winged stilt ( <unk> <unk> ) . Hualālai averages 18 @.@ 27 in ( 46 cm ) of rainfall per year . The summit gets more rain than the coast and is typically obscured in heavy cloud cover and <unk> . 
 Several ecological reserves lie on the flanks of Hualālai . The Puʻu <unk> <unk> forest sanctuary was established in 1992 ( along with the <unk> sister reserve on Mauna Kea ) as a testbed for long term ecological research about Hawaiian moist forest and dry forest biomes , and lies within a mile of the volcano 's summit on its northwestern flank . Elevation differs from sea level near the coastal edge to 6 @,@ 300 ft ( 1 @,@ 920 m ) near the summit . Median annual rainfall is about 46 @.@ 7 in ( 119 cm ) . Plentiful lava flows from the 19th century provide unique niches for vegetative and soil growth in the region . The southern section of the reserve , closest to the summit , has been split into a bird sanctuary . 
 The <unk> forest reserve on the southwestern flank of the volcano at 19 ° 30 ′ 25 ″ N 155 ° 54 ′ 41 ″ W , preserves an extensive koa ( Acacia koa ) forest stand , with smaller <unk> ( Myoporum sandwicense ) and Māmane ( Sophora chrysophylla ) trees and an undergrowth of <unk> ( Rubus <unk> ) and various ferns . The reserve measures 655 acres ( 265 ha ) and protects an ecosystem that has since been largely deforested in the surrounding area . The Wai Aha spring reserve on the lower slopes of the mountain is somewhat swampy and is home to the flowering evergreen <unk> ( Metrosideros polymorpha ) , the woody climber <unk> ( <unk> arborea ) , and a dense undergrowth of <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) .

 WhiteWater World is a water park situated in the suburb of <unk> on the Gold Coast , Australia . It is owned and operated by Ardent Leisure . 
 After years of planning and a year of construction , WhiteWater World opened to the public on 8 December 2006 . The ten Australian beach culture themed attractions cost approximately A $ 56 million . These included The Green Room , Super Tubes Hydrocoaster , The Rip , The BRO , Temple of Huey , Cave of Waves , Wiggle Bay , and Pipeline Plunge . Since then , four additional water slides : two called Little Rippers , one called The Wedgie and one called the Triple Vortex , have been added . 
 WhiteWater World was designed to be very efficient in its water use . Since opening , the quantity of visitors has consistently been above expectations . Ardent Leisure has submitted a development application for the expansion of the water park and plans to add five new attractions .

 In 2004 , Macquarie Leisure began planning a water park to be located next to the company 's existing Dreamworld theme park . Dreamworld 's Chief Executive Officer Stephen Gregg and General Manager of Special Projects Bob Tan visited water parks around the world to discover the most thrilling and cutting @-@ edge water rides available . Later Tan was quoted saying " ... the drawing board for the new park was a restaurant napkin in a little cafe in the US " . 
 On 28 November 2005 , Macquarie Leisure announced it would invest $ 56 million on the Dreamworld Water Park project , with construction commencing shortly there @-@ after . 
 The existing Dreamworld car park was redesigned to accommodate more cars and the addition of a water park in the southern portion . Construction of the water park began in January 2006 . In June , two of the three slide towers were complete , with several slides in the early phases of construction . One month later , several attractions were announced by the park with others being speculated upon . Some attractions were nearing completion in September and all the planned attractions had been revealed by October . 
 WhiteWater World opened three weeks ahead of schedule on 8 December 2006 after a week of previews . The park opened with ten attractions , including The Green Room , The Rip , Super Tubes Hydrocoaster , The BRO , The Temple of Huey ( 3 individual slides ) , Pipeline Plunge , Wiggle Bay and the Cave of Waves . At this time , the park featured many Australian and world firsts : The Rip and Super Tubes Hydrocoaster were both Australian firsts ; The BRO was a world first ; and The Green Room was Australia 's biggest Tornado slide . After six months of operation Macquarie Leisure announced that WhiteWater World attracted 247 @,@ 360 visitors , producing a revenue of $ 8 @.@ 7 million and a profit of $ 4 million . 
 = = = Performance = = = 
 WhiteWater World performed above expectations after opening with approximately 23 @,@ 000 guests between 8 December and 31 December 2006 . WhiteWater World continued to exceed Macquarie Leisure 's expectations during its first year of operation . The first year saw 493 @,@ 227 guests , exceeding the 450 @,@ 000 estimate , earning the park over $ 8 @.@ 4 million in revenue . The park continued to perform well in subsequent years with an 18 @.@ 4 % increase in attendance in 2008 . 
 In June 2009 , Macquarie Leisure was renamed to Ardent Leisure as part of a corporate repositioning which saw the company split from Macquarie . In August 2010 , Ardent Leisure announced a decline in revenue and profits in its theme park division . It stated that a capital expenditure plan had been endorsed which would " ... strengthen ride inventory and consumer appeal " . 
 <unk> is currently ranked as one of the world 's most water efficient parks because of its sustainable water management and environmentally friendly technology . 
 = = = Expansion = = = 
 In September 2007 , the park added two attractions : a pair of ProSlide Cannon Bowls called The Little Rippers and an events venue called The Shell . A month later , WhiteWater World submitted a development application to the Gold Coast City Council to extend the water park . The main feature of the application was a 25 @-@ metre ( 82 ft ) tower featuring three new water slides : two Mammoth slides and a Tornado Tantrum Alley . The expansion proposal also featured a lazy river and a large water play area . After two years , the application was approved by the council . The expansion plans have been delayed due to the 2007 @-@ 2010 financial crisis . 
 In December 2009 , it was reported that WhiteWater World planned to add a WhiteWater West <unk> . However Village Roadshow Theme Parks , owner of competitor Wet 'n'Wild Gold Coast , attempted to negotiate an exclusivity agreement with the manufacturer . Three months later in February 2010 , it was announced that WhiteWater World would build an alternative attraction built by ProSlide before the April school holidays . The Wedgie , a ProSlide <unk> , opened on 1 April 2011 . It was the first ride in Australia to feature a trap door release and was marketed as Australia 's first looping water slide . 
 In 2011 , WhiteWater World 's contract with Nickelodeon was terminated and Nickelodeon 's Pipeline Plunge was renamed Pipeline Plunge . 
 In September 2014 , the park added ' Triple Vortex ' , a two @-@ person tube slide by ProSlide . 
 = = Attractions = = 
 WhiteWater World features several water slide attractions ( all built by ProSlide ) , a large wave pool and separate children and toddler areas . There are food and beverage outlets , retail stores , a surf school , a function area and numerous shaded areas with seating . The park features three water slide towers , each featuring a collection of slides grouped by the level of thrill . The park also features three family @-@ oriented water attractions separate from the towers . All of the park 's attractions have an Australian beach culture theme . 
 The slide tower near the entrance contains the park 's main thrill slides . The Wedgie is a body slide featuring a trap @-@ door release into a near @-@ vertical 17 @-@ metre ( 56 ft ) drop . Riders then enter a fast , downward @-@ spiralling turn and reach speeds of nearly 45 kilometres per hour ( 28 mph ) before they are slowed in a run @-@ out chute . The ride was the first ProSlide <unk> in the world . The Green Room consists of four people boarding a cloverleaf @-@ shaped tube in which they traverse a 66 @-@ metre ( 217 ft ) long tunnel followed by a 17 @-@ metre ( 56 ft ) drop into a funnel . Within the funnel , riders oscillate back and forth up the walls at the side and drop into a splash pool . Since its opening , The Green Room has been Australia 's largest ProSlide Tornado beating Wet 'n'Wild Water World 's Tornado in height and tunnel length . On the Super Tubes Hydrocoaster , three people sit on a 45 @-@ kilogram ( 99 lb ) raft , whose weight is mainly attributable to a large magnet on its underside . Riders experience several steep drops followed by magnet @-@ powered inclines , ending with a splashdown in a small pool . The Super Tubes Hydrocoaster was the second ProSlide Hydro Magnetic Rocket Slide in the world and continues to be Australia 's only water coaster . 
 The second slide tower , along the park 's southern border , features two rides with more moderate thrill ratings . On The Rip , riders hop into a four @-@ person , cloverleaf @-@ shaped tube . They descend a dark tunnel before entering a large , open bowl . The raft circles the centre of the bowl then exits down through the centre and into a splashdown pool . The Rip is the first and currently the only ProSlide Behemoth Bowl in Australia . The BRO ( Blue Ringed Octopus ) is a water slide consisting of eight 120 @-@ metre ( 390 ft ) long lanes . From a height of 16 metres ( 52 ft ) , riders mount a personal mat and slide head first down an enclosed spiral tunnel before merging into open , parallel lanes to the finish . In 24 seconds , riders can reach speeds of up to 50 kilometres per hour ( 31 mph ) . The BRO has a capacity of 1000 riders per hour . When The BRO opened in 2006 , it was the largest ProSlide Octopus Racer in the world and is the only one in Australia . A third slide , Triple Vortex , was added to the tower in late 2014 . Pairs of riders will slide down an enclosed tube slide with three funnels , similar to miniature versions of the park 's Green Room funnel . 
 The slide tower in the southeast corner of the park contains five slides designed for those who desire a mild thrill . Some of the slides on this tower interact with Dreamworld 's Cyclone roller coaster . The Little Rippers are two ProSlide duelling cannon bowl slides . The slides can accommodate guests riding in either one or two person tubes . Riders begin in one of two parallel chutes before entering tunnels and splitting off in opposite directions . Each tunnel has a steep drop into the bowl element of the ride , after which the raft drops down through the centre and into a run @-@ out chute . The other three slides on this tower are collectively known as The Temple of Huey . Guests can ride in a single or double tube . All three slides are ProSlide Pipelines . The three slides are individually named Broken <unk> , Cut Snake and Screamin Right <unk> and are 99 , 104 and 88 metres ( 325 , 341 and 289 feet ) long respectively . Broken <unk> and Cut Snake are enclosed and Screamin Right <unk> is an open flume . 
 Three family @-@ oriented attractions are located on the ground level , detached from the three slide towers . Two of these are children 's areas and the third is a wave pool . Pipeline Plunge is a children 's area with four flume slides and hundreds of water activities . The area , originally called Nickelodeon 's Pipeline Plunge , is a large , multi @-@ level water play structure featuring an 1 @,@ 000 @-@ litre ( 220 imp gal ; 260 US gal ) tipping bucket which dumps water on guests every few minutes . It played host to two " Slime Fest " events in 2009 that included several live shows , a dunking chair and " Australia 's biggest sliming " where 1 @,@ 000 litres ( 220 imp gal ; 260 US gal ) of slime was dumped on park guests using green coloured water in the giant tipping bucket twice daily . The mass sliming returned in the 2010 / 2011 summer holidays as part of the Summer <unk> . Pipeline Plunge is a WhiteWater West Aqua Play area . Wiggle Bay is a Wiggles themed toddler area featuring musical and interactive water play activities , a shallow pool and four Wiggles @-@ coloured water slides , located at the back of the area. these were manufactured by ProSlide . The interactive features are manufactured by <unk> . The Cave of Waves is a themed 2 @,@ 685 @-@ square @-@ metre ( 28 @,@ 900 sq ft ) wave pool which can generate waves of up to 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) high . Built by Murphy 's Waves of Scotland , the pool has a constant temperature of 26 degrees Celsius . The Get Wet Surf School makes use of the pool for its lessons outside of normal park operating hours .

 In addition to its lineup of attractions , WhiteWater World also has a retail outlet , an events venue , cabanas , and several food and beverage outlets . 
 The Beyond the Beach shop , located near the park 's entrance , sells surf and WhiteWater World branded merchandise . The shop contains a Kodak photo centre that allows guests to purchase on @-@ ride photos taken on the Super Tubes Hydrocoaster and photographs taken inside the park . Beyond the Beach also serves as the exit gates for the park . 
 WhiteWater World operates three dining outlets in the peak holiday seasons : Bite Me Cafe , Sandman 's Cafe and Bar and Salty 's Kiosk . The widest range of meals is available from the Bite Me Cafe which operates all year round . Sandman 's Cafe and Bar is a licensed bar where guests can purchase alcoholic drinks and food options including Eagle Boys pizza . It is located on the park 's western border between the Cave of Waves and the splashdown of The Wedgie . Salty 's Kiosk is located next to The BRO and sells slushies , ice creams and other snack foods . 
 Since September 2007 , WhiteWater World has hosted an undercover events venue , the largest at an Australian theme park , The Shell . The venue can cater for up to 2000 guests and is located on the southeast corner of WhiteWater World . 
 From April 2011 , WhiteWater World has offered guests the hire of 12 luxury cabanas , located around the park . Each cabana is designed for up to four guests , who have access to deck chairs , couches , a coffee table , an iPod dock , towels and a mini refrigerator .

 Prior to opening , WhiteWater World was criticised for being built during one of Australia 's worst droughts and in an area on Level 5 water restrictions . When designing WhiteWater World , Macquarie Leisure implemented measures to ensure that the park was one of the most water efficient water parks in the world through the minimisation of water loss . 
 In October 2008 , staff at WhiteWater World stopped Paralympian Steve Simmonds from riding the slides . Simmonds was angry and stated that he felt like he was discriminated against . WhiteWater World cited manufacturer guidelines and safety concerns as the reasons behind the restrictions . 
 During the first full year of operation , WhiteWater World attracted more visitors than the expected 450 @,@ 000 guests . Attendance records show close to 500 @,@ 000 guests attended the park during that period . 
 In a review of several Australian entertainment attractions for The Australian , Scott Podmore rated WhiteWater World 7 @.@ 5 out of 10 , outranking its main competitors Wet 'n'Wild Gold Coast and Sea World also on the Gold Coast and <unk> World on the Sunshine Coast . Podmore stated that " WhiteWater World is a wonderful , diverse park offering something for everyone . " and that " WhiteWater World is fantastic for a splash , some R & R or some slippery big rides " . Podmore highlighted The Rip , The BRO , Little Rippers and Temple of Huey as the park 's top attractions . 
 Before The Wedgie opened in April 2010 , several media reporters experienced the ride . Tanya <unk> of the Gold Coast Bulletin described the ride as " ... not for the faint @-@ hearted " . She also stated that " ... disorientation prevails for a large chunk of the ride , but the thrill is unparalleled to any other waterslide " . Phil <unk> of the Brisbane Times wrote that the ride " ... is not only the fastest , most exhilarating water ride I 've ever tried but it lives up to its name in spades " .

The player controls an empire with the goal of conquering as much territory as possible and eliminating rival factions , which are controlled by the computer , or AI . The main campaign is split between two gameplay modes : a turn @-@ based strategy map for moving whole armies and managing the empire , and a real @-@ time battle map for fighting battles on the ground between two or more armies . The two game modes are linked , with success or failure in one game mode influencing the chances of success or failure in the other . 
 Although set in a similar historical period and geographical area to the unmodified game ( covering a timespan of 272 BC to 14 AD , compared to the original game 's 270 BC to 14 AD ) , Europa Barbarorum is a total conversion modification as it replaces all the aspects of the original Rome : Total War game that can be replaced , such as unit models , statistics and the musical score . The modification has received favourable reviews in a number of computer gaming magazines . PC Gamer magazine ranks Europa Barbarorum as the best mod for any of the seven Total War games released for the PC at that time . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 In the original Rome : Total War the player took control of an empire , or " faction " , of classical Europe , North Africa or the Middle East , with the aim of expanding their faction 's territory and eliminating rival empires through military conquest and city @-@ building . Europa Barbarorum retains this basic gameplay mechanic and sets itself in a similar time period and geographical area to the original game . However , as a total conversion the mod replaces the particular factions , military units , buildings , and other elements present in the original game , and adds a new soundtrack and several brand @-@ new gameplay mechanics not present in the original , such as the installation of puppet rulers . The modification 's development team 's stated aim in making the changes that they have to Rome : Total War is to make the player 's experience of the ancient world more historically accurate . For this reason , numerous parameters of the game at the start of the campaign in 272 BC , such as generals ' names , the diplomatic relations between factions , and the particular understanding of the outside world that each faction has , have been set to correspond to the actual political situation in that year . 
 Also for reasons of historical verisimilitude , factions , provinces on the campaign map and factions ' family members have been given vernacular names in Europa Barbarorum , rather than having Latinised or Anglicised ones , as in Rome : Total War . So , for instance , the original game 's Armenia faction is known as <unk> in Europa Barbarorum , and Germania as the <unk> . Instead of having to play one 's first campaign as a Roman faction and only subsequently unlock playable campaigns as non @-@ Romans by defeating them in the Roman campaign , all twenty of Europa Barbarorum 's playable factions can be accessed by the player from the start . Furthermore , the one unplayable and three playable Roman factions of the original have been combined into a single playable faction in Europa Barbarorum , the Romani . Dissatisfied with the homogeneity of the factions of the original Rome : Total War , the Europa Barbarorum development team have sought to differentiate the playing experiences of the game 's different factions . So , for example , Rome : Total War 's trait @-@ acquisition system , where the player 's faction 's family members acquire certain characteristics and talents which make them more or less adept at certain tasks such as city management or military leadership , has been made more faction @-@ specific in Europa Barbarorum , with Hellenic characters ' traits , for instance , being based on <unk> ' Characters and Aristotle 's teachings on the Golden Mean , and Romans ' traits being partially based on the moral tales of Valerius Maximus . There are sometimes additional requirements for a family member to be able to gain a new trait : in order for them to compete in one of the Panhellenic Games , for instance , the player must ensure that they are stationed in the appropriate city on the campaign map in the year that the competition is scheduled to take place . One reviewer has commented that Europa Barbarorum 's expansions upon the original Rome : Total War 's trait system have served to add a role @-@ playing element to the game . 
 = = = Campaign = = = 
 As in the original Rome : Total War , Europa Barbarorum 's strategic campaign sees the player take control of a particular faction and then compete for territory and resources against all the other factions , which are controlled by the game 's artificial intelligence . The player is presented with a map of Europe , North Africa and the Near East in which territory is divided into 200 provinces , each of which contains a province capital , which will at any given point be controlled either by the player 's faction , a rival playable faction , or the non @-@ playable <unk> faction , which represents the world 's minor kingdoms , regional powers and rebel states . If a faction should at any point find itself not in control of any provinces , it is eliminated from the game . Gameplay is turn @-@ based , each turn representing the passage of three months on the campaign map ( unlike the six months of the original Rome : Total War ) and alternating between the player managing their empire and the artificial intelligence making all the other factions ' moves . A key game mechanic of the campaign map is the annexation of territory , which is done province @-@ by @-@ province , either by successfully besieging the province capital , or by acquiring it from another faction through diplomacy . Once a faction has acquired a province , they may construct buildings in the province capital which either enable the recruitment of certain military units or grant various bonuses to the city such as greater resilience during a siege or a decreased likelihood of the province rebelling . Provided the city contains the appropriate buildings , the player may recruit military units in the city at the same time as undertaking construction projects . The aim of the game is to acquire a specified number of provinces and / or eliminate specified rival factions ( in Europa Barbarorum particular victory conditions differ for each faction ) , whilst avoiding being eliminated by the other factions . 
 The campaign map itself of Europa Barbarorum covers a wider geographical area than that of Rome : Total War , expanding into areas such as the Arabian Peninsula , India , Central Asia , and Scandinavia . Relief , province boundaries , snow boundaries , vegetation types , coastlines and areas prone to natural disaster in 272 BC have all been researched and implemented into the campaign map . The Nile – Red Sea canal linking the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean Sea has been added to the map , as have the great trade routes of the ancient world , such as the Amber and Silk Roads , which can be captured and exploited by the player or by the artificial intelligence . 
 The selection of factions present in the original Rome : Total War has been overhauled in Europa Barbarorum . The original game 's Gaul faction has been replaced with two new factions , the <unk> and the <unk> . The Scythia faction has been replaced by the <unk> , and the Greek Cities faction ( which included various city @-@ states ) has been replaced by the <unk> <unk> ( Ancient Greek : League of the Greeks ) , a faction which represents the Chremonidean League of Athens , Sparta and Rhodes . Entirely new factions include <unk> , a Central Asian Hellenic empire , and <unk> , a western Greek faction famous for producing <unk> of <unk> . On the other hand , the Numidia faction of Rome : Total War was removed entirely . 
 The way in which factions enhance the provinces they own through the construction of new buildings in their province capitals has changed in Europa Barbarorum . The process of assimilating a newly conquered province into one 's empire has become more differentiated in the modification than it was in the original game through the introduction of so @-@ called " government buildings " and military – industrial complexes . Government buildings represent different degrees of central State intervention in a province , and range from a homeland government , which can only be built in a faction 's traditional ethnic homeland and represents the highest possible degree of central State control , to an allied state government , which makes the province in question semi @-@ autonomous and installs a puppet ruler to govern it on the controlling faction 's behalf . The choice of government building in a province affects what other buildings can be constructed there : the greater the degree of autonomy granted to a province , the greater the shift in the make @-@ up of the pool of buildings available for construction from the controlling faction 's own buildings to native buildings ; that is , buildings which are more closely associated with the faction that would make its traditional home in the province in question , rather than the one currently occupying it . Nomadic , <unk> and steppe @-@ dwelling factions have their own government buildings , which some say has helped differentiate between Europa Barbarorum 's factions and make the differences between Europa Barbarorum and the original Rome : Total War more than just cosmetic . These government buildings also affect unit recruitment options in a province , through the mod 's introduction of military – industrial complex ( " MIC " ) buildings . The original Rome : Total War 's system of constructing and subsequently upgrading different types of building in order to recruit different types of soldier ( stables for horses , ranges for archers , and so on ) has been replaced in Europa Barbarorum by the " factional MIC " , which enables the recruitment of all the province @-@ controlling faction 's units , and the " regional MIC " , which enables the recruitment of native types of soldier . How far the two types of complexes can be upgraded depends on the government of the province : the greater the autonomy of the province , the more the native MIC may be upgraded , and the less the factional MIC may be upgraded ; and vice versa . In addition to buildings which can be constructed by the player , Europa Barbarorum also introduces a number of unique buildings or " wonders " which can either be man @-@ made structures or features of the landscape and which provide unique bonuses to the province . 
 = = = Warfare = = = 
 If , during their turn on the campaign map , the player should engage one of their armies in combat with another faction 's army , or if their troops should be engaged by another faction during the AI 's turn , the player then has the option of fighting a real @-@ time battle or siege . In this gameplay mode , the player directs the troops they had brought with them on the campaign map to the engagement , ordering them to manoeuvre and attack the enemy 's troops on a three @-@ dimensional battlefield . Troops can either be killed outright on the battlefield or made to rout and flee the field if their morale falls below a certain threshold . Reviewers have noted of Rome : Total War that , during a battle , troop numbers do not outweigh all other considerations ; other factors such as individual unit types ' strengths and soldiers ' morale and fatigue at the point of fighting are also taken into account . A battle is won when one side kills or routs the entire enemy army ; a siege may be won by the attacking side through either dispatching the opposing forces or gaining control of the besieged city 's central plaza for a certain number of minutes , and by the defending side either by killing the attackers or by destroying their siege equipment before they have managed to breach the city 's defences . 
 The make @-@ up of the game 's units is one of the areas in which the most change can be seen going from the original game to the mod . Reviewers have commented that the differences between Europa Barbarorum and its parent game are " immediate " and " striking " and that the modification is different from its parent game " in look and in play " . Another reviewer described the mod as having a more " gritty , realistic look " than the original Rome : Total War . All the units that were present in the original game have been removed and replaced in Europa Barbarorum . Specific examples include the removal of several units that the Europa Barbarorum team considered to be historically doubtful or only marginally used in warfare , such as <unk> , incendiary pigs and Celtic head @-@ <unk> from the original Rome : Total War . Nor was the modding team happy with the way more conventional forces were portrayed in the original game , for instance calling Rome : Total War 's Egyptian soldiers " Mummy Returns Egyptians " and hence creating a new unit roster for the Egyptian faction in the game ( named Egypt in the original Rome : Total War and the <unk> in Europa Barbarorum ) , in order to better correspond with the Ptolemaic period of history . The mod also features new custom battle formations in order to encourage more realistic behaviour from the AI . 
 = = Audio = = 
 Europa Barbarorum features its own soundtrack , distinct from that of Rome : Total War . Some of its tracks were composed especially by Morgan Casey and Nick Wylie ; others are examples of authentic music , the Celtic factions ' tracks , for example , having been recorded by early music ensemble Prehistoric Music Ireland . Europa Barbarorum also includes its own " voicemod " , an attempt by the developers to replace the English cries of Rome : Total War 's soldiers with ones in their native languages , which include classical Latin , Celtic , and ancient Greek . 
 = = Development = = 
 The Europa Barbarorum project began in January 2004 , eight months before Rome : Total War 's release , when the Europa Barbarorum development team who were following the game 's development became concerned that its " barbarian " factions such as the Gauls were being portrayed inaccurately . The Europa Barbarorum team felt that such factions ' representations in Rome : Total War conformed more to a Hollywood stereotype than to historical fact , and wished to see a more realistic portrayal of such factions in the game . The modding team tried to convince the Creative Assembly ( CA ) , the developers of Rome : Total War , to alter their depiction of the period in line with the team 's research , but the developers failed to take them up on their offer . Having exhausted this avenue for change , the Europa Barbarorum members then resolved to modify the game themselves upon its release . 
 = = Release = = 
 Europa Barbarorum was first released to the public as an open beta in December 2005 . After several more minor releases throughout 2006 which mostly fixed bugs and made small adjustments to the modification , the next major release of Europa Barbarorum was version 0 @.@ 80 in December 2006 . Its changes included the addition of the Sabaean faction , new music , and the inclusion of a new military – industrial complex system . There were three more 0 @.@ 8 @-@ series releases during the first half of 2007 which primarily made minor adjustments to the modification and fixed bugs . In total , over 135 @,@ 000 downloads of the 0 @.@ 80 – 0 @.@ 81 versions were tracked . 
 The next major release was version 1 @.@ 0 , which was released in October 2007 and included new units , new government options for the <unk> and <unk> factions , the addition of a new type of wall to the battle map and new music from prehistoric music group Prehistoric Music Ireland . The 1 @.@ 0 version was downloaded over 90 @,@ 000 times in the six months following its release . This was followed by version 1 @.@ 1 , which was released in April 2008 and included new battle map landscapes , new units , the addition of the Pahlavi voicemod and the inclusion of an introduction video for the Saka <unk> faction . The current release is version 1 @.@ 2 , which contains the addition of the Punic voicemod and bug fixes ; the development team had previously stated that future releases of Europa Barbarorum for the Rome : Total War engine will not include any major gameplay changes . 
 Europa Barbarorum has seen some significant changes to its campaign over the course of its development . The Yuezhi faction , included in early releases of the modification , was subsequently dropped . Earlier releases of Europa Barbarorum also featured player alerts representing the major stages of the breakup of the <unk> faction , if that collapse occurred in the game . However , such features became impossible to implement after the <unk> faction of the original game , used in Europa Barbarorum for scripting purposes , was removed from the mod in exchange for the kingdom of Saba . 
 Following the main modification 's release , a number of <unk> of Europa Barbarorum have been created , such as porting it to run using the Rome : Total War : Barbarian Invasion executable , or Feral Interactive 's Mac OS X version of Rome : Total War . There had been plans to release a version of the mod for the PC game Europa Universalis : Rome , but no Europa Barbarorum mod has yet been released for the strategy title . 
 = = = Europa Barbarorum II = = = 
 The Europa Barbarorum development team also developed a new version of the modification for the Medieval II : Total War : Kingdoms engine which was named Europa Barbarorum II . The modification was designed to take advantage of the improved graphics of Medieval II : Total War and of its engine 's additional features , such as the possibility for different soldiers within the same unit to have different appearances , as opposed to the " clones " criticised by some reviewers of Rome : Total War . Europa Barbarorum II includes new government , unit recruitment and trait systems , and new playable factions such as the kingdom of Gandhara , which has its own Sanskrit voicemod . 
 An initial version of Europa Barbarorum II <unk> was released on August 25 , 2014 , with a second version ( <unk> ) released on September 12 , 2014 . On December 21 , 2015 a third version ( <unk> ) was released and provided a number of improvements , such as remodelled battle map settlements , battle map vegetation , and new units with military reforms for various factions . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Europa Barbarorum was featured and reviewed in a number of video game magazines . It has been reviewed in PC Gamer ( UK ) twice , in March 2005 and February 2008 . The 2008 review was overwhelmingly positive , saying that " EB feels like a whole new Total War game " , and going on to praise the modification 's " stunning " scope and the " striking " extent of the differences between it and Rome : Total War . The review was somewhat critical of the modification 's graphical user interfaces which " [ occasionally ] " had a " home @-@ made " feel to them , as well as its lack of accessibility and steep learning curve , although it adds that the second point is not a large problem as the modification is largely a " master 's challenge for accomplished Rome players " . The review finished on a positive note , summing Europa Barbarorum up as a " superior game " . In 2010 the same magazine 's website named Europa Barbarorum the best mod of any Total War game . 
 A number of non @-@ English language magazines have also reviewed Europa Barbarorum . The Italian PC Gaming magazine Giochi per il mio computer reviewed the modification in April 2005 and March 2008 . The 2005 review reported that the modification , whose development team included two historians , was to replace the " economic system , [ soldiers ' ] equipment and the provinces " of Rome : Total War ; the latter review praised the mod for having " altered and deepened " the gameplay of the original title , and wrote that Europa Barbarorum was the best substitute for a Rome 2 : Total War game prior to the actual release of such a title . Dutch magazine PC Gameplay , reviewing the mod in March 2008 , also wrote that the mod was " perhaps the best candidate for the title Rome : Total War II " " until the official announcement " and went on to note that the list of changes that the modification had made to the original game almost constituted " a history book of its own " . The German magazine GameStar wrote in April 2007 that the Europa Barbarorum team had " banned all historical mistakes from the game " ; in January 2011 , another German publication , PC Games , also noted the mod 's historical accuracy , singling out its " more realistic , more [ challenging ] " battles for praise , although it did note that the mod was squarely aimed at experienced Rome : Total War players . Reviewing version 0 @.@ 74 of the mod in November 2006 , Romanian publication <unk> concurred that the mod was aimed at experienced players , adding that the modified version of the game put greater demands on the player 's computer than the original Rome : Total War , requiring 512 MB of RAM , up from the original 's 256 . Despite this , the reviewer praised the mod 's complexity , the " painstaking detail " that went into making the units and the mod 's soundtrack . 
 Europa Barbarorum has also received several online reviews . The modification received a review early into its development process on gaming website <unk> , which said that it was an " ambitious " project and praised its commitment to historical accuracy , even stating that the Europa Barbarorum development team was going to use satellite imagery and climate change statistics to accurately portray the world as it was in 272 BC . Later , in 2008 , the modification has been reviewed on <unk> , which praised the modification 's " incredibly well @-@ researched and <unk> " unit stats system , as well as its " legion of historians " . The modification has sometimes been mentioned as a recommended complement to Rome : Total War in reviews of the original title – for instance , by Norwegian gaming website <unk> in 2007 . 
 In addition , Europa Barbarorum was singled out for praise by the Creative Assembly themselves in 2011 , when they called the mod " breathtaking " in an official statement . 
 = Harriet Arbuthnot = 
 Harriet Arbuthnot ( 10 September 1793 – 2 August 1834 ) was an early 19th @-@ century English diarist , social observer and political hostess on behalf of the Tory party . During the 1820s she was the " closest woman friend " of the hero of Waterloo and British Prime Minister , the 1st Duke of Wellington . She maintained a long correspondence and association with the Duke , all of which she recorded in her diaries , which are consequently extensively used in all authoritative biographies of the Duke of Wellington . 
 Born into the periphery of the British aristocracy and married to a politician and member of the establishment , she was perfectly placed to meet all the key figures of the Regency and late Napoleonic eras . Recording meetings and conversations often verbatim , she has today become the " Mrs. Arbuthnot " quoted in many biographies and histories of the era . Her observations and memories of life within the British establishment are not confined to individuals but document politics , great events and daily life with an equal attention to detail , providing historians with a clear picture of the events described . Her diaries were themselves finally published in 1950 as The Journal of Mrs Arbuthnot . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Harriet Arbuthnot was born Harriet Fane , the daughter of the Hon. Henry Fane , second son of Thomas Fane , 8th Earl of Westmorland . As a young man , Henry Fane had been described as " very idle and careless and spending much time in the country " . However , he found time to be the Member of Parliament for Lyme and in 1772 was appointed Keeper of the King 's Private Roads . In 1778 , he married Arbuthnot 's mother , Anne Batson , an heiress , the daughter of Edward Buckley Batson . The couple had 14 children : nine sons and five daughters . 
 The young Harriet spent much of her childhood at the family home at Fulbeck Hall in Lincolnshire , sited high on the limestone hills above Grantham . The house , which had been given to Henry Fane by his father , was a not over @-@ large modern mansion at the time of Arbuthnot 's childhood . It was rebuilt following a fire in 1733 , and further extended and modernised in 1784 by Henry Fane . At Fulbeck Harriet and her 13 siblings enjoyed a comfortable and reasonably affluent rural childhood . 
 Harriet Fane 's father died when she was nine years old , but the family fortunes improved considerably in 1810 when her mother inherited the Avon Tyrrell estate in Hampshire and the <unk> Estate in Dorset . This yielded the widowed Mrs Fane an income of £ 6 @,@ 000 per annum ( £ 380 @,@ 000 per year as of 2016 ) , a large income by the standards of the day . With 14 children and a position in society to maintain , however , the money was fully utilised . 
 = = Marriage = = 
 Harriet Fane married Rt Hon Charles Arbuthnot , member of Parliament , at Fulbeck on 31 January 1814 . Born in 1767 , her husband was 26 years older than she was , an age difference which had initially caused her family to object to the marriage . Another of the principal obstacles to finalising the arrangements for the marriage was financial . Her widowed mother delegated the arrangements for the marriage of her 20 @-@ year @-@ old daughter to her elder son Vere , a 46 @-@ year @-@ old widower who was considered qualified in these matters as he worked at Child 's Bank . It seems that Vere Fane and his mother were not initially prepared to settle enough money on his sister to satisfy her future husband , causing the prospective bridegroom to write to his fiancée : " How can you and I live upon £ 1000 or £ 1200 and Fane [ her mother ] finds it so impossible to live upon her £ 6000 that she can offer you no assistance whatsoever ? " 
 Charles Arbuthnot was a widower with four children ; his son Charles was a mere nine years junior to his new wife . His first wife Marcia , a lady in waiting to the notorious Princess of Wales , had died in 1806 . Like the other two men his second wife so admired , Viscount Castlereagh and Wellington , Charles Arbuthnot was a member of the Anglo @-@ Irish aristocracy . He had been a member of parliament since 1795 , when he became the member for East Looe . At the time of his marriage to Fane , he was the member for St Germans . He had briefly interrupted his political career to become Ambassador Extraordinary to the Ottoman Empire between 1804 and 1807 . Marriage to such a pillar of the establishment as Charles Arbuthnot opened all doors to his young new wife , who , as one of the 14 children of a younger son of an aristocratic family possessed of no great fortune , would otherwise have been on the periphery of the highest society . However , as the debate and wrangling over her dowry proved , money was tight . 
 Throughout her marriage , Mrs Arbuthnot , the former Harriet Fane , formed close friendships with powerful older men . She described Castlereagh as her " dearest and best friend " until his death in 1822 , when she transferred her affections to the other great 19th @-@ century Anglo @-@ Irish peer , the Duke of Wellington . All social commentators of the time , however , agree that her marriage was happy ; indeed , her husband was as close a friend of Wellington 's as was his wife . Married to a politician , she was fascinated by politics and enjoyed success as a political hostess while exerting her energies to promote Tory causes . However , while she was the dominant partner , her conservative outlook ensured her continued favour among her elderly Tory admirers . During the early part of her marriage , her husband served as an Under @-@ Secretary at the Treasury . Later , in 1823 , he was given the Department of Woods and Forests , a position which gave him charge of the Royal parks and gardens . The subsequent access to the Royal family this allowed increased not only his status but also that of his wife . 
 When remarking in her diaries on other women who shared their affections with great men of the day , Arbuthnot displayed a sharp , ironic wit . Of Wellington 's one @-@ time mistress Princess Dorothea Lieven , wife to the Imperial Russian ambassador to London from 1812 to 1834 , she wrote " It is curious that the loves and intrigues of a femme galante should have such influence over the affairs of Europe . " Arbuthnot obviously failed to realise she was regarded by some in London society as a femme galante in a similar situation herself . 
 Her political observations are clearly written from her own Tory viewpoint . However , her detailed description of the rivalry for power between the Tories and Liberals which took place between 1822 and 1830 is one of the most authoritative accounts of this struggle . 
 = = Relationship with Wellington = = 
 It is likely that Arbuthnot first came to the attention of Wellington during 1814 in the re @-@ opened salons of Paris following the exile of Napoleon to Elba . Wellington had been appointed the British Ambassador to the Court of the Tuileries , and the city was crowded with English visitors anxious to travel on the continent and socialise after the Napoleonic Wars . 
 Amongst those sampling the rounds of entertainment in this lively environment were the newly married <unk> . Charles Arbuthnot was known to Wellington , as he had been a strong supporter of Wellington 's younger brother Henry during his divorce , and it is possible Wellington had met , or at least heard of , Mrs Arbuthnot — she was a first cousin to his favourites the Burghersh family . However , it was only after the death of Castlereagh in 1822 that the Wellington – Arbuthnot friendship blossomed . It is unlikely any close friendship developed before this time . Wellington , ensconced in the Hotel de <unk> ( recently vacated by Napoleon 's sister Princess Pauline Borghese ) and fêted by the whole of Restoration Paris , had already found himself a close female companion , Giuseppina <unk> . This woman , known , due to her close friendship with Napoleon as " La Chanteuse de l 'Empereur " , scandalised Parisian society both English and French by appearing on Wellington 's arm , especially after the arrival in Paris of the Duchess of Wellington . 
 The story of a " ménage à trois " between Mrs Arbuthnot , her husband Charles , and Wellington , widely speculated upon , has been rejected by some biographers . However , it has been said that the unhappily married Duke enjoyed his relationship with Mrs Arbuthnot because he found in her company " the comfort and happiness his wife could not give him . " Arbuthnot was certainly the Duke 's confidante in all matters , especially that of his marriage . He confided to her that he only married his wife because " they asked me to do it " and that he was " not the least in love with her . " In fact , Wellington had not seen his wife for ten years before their wedding day . Following the marriage , the bride and groom found they had little if anything in common . Despite producing two sons , they led mostly separate lives until the death of the Duchess of Wellington in 1831 . Harriet had a rather poor opinion of the Duchess , although she disagreed with Wellington when he said that his wife cared nothing for his comfort : in Harriet 's view the Duchess longed to make her husband happy , but had no idea how to go about the task . 
 As a consequence of his unsatisfactory marriage , Wellington formed relationships with other women , but it was for Arbuthnot that " he reserved his deepest affection . " Her husband at this time was working at The Treasury and Arbuthnot in effect became what would today be termed Wellington 's social secretary during his first term of premiership between January 1828 and November 1830 . It has been suggested that the Duke of Wellington allowed her " almost unrestricted access to the secrets of the cabinet " . Whatever her knowledge and access , however , it appears she was unable to influence the Duke , but even his refusal to bring her husband into the Cabinet in January 1828 failed to shake the intimacy of the trio . 
 Wellington made no attempts to conceal his friendship with Arbuthnot . An indication that their relationship was platonic and accepted as such in the highest echelons of society can be drawn from the Duchess of Kent permitting Wellington to present Arbuthnot to her infant daughter , the future Queen Victoria , in 1828 . Arbuthnot noted that the young princess was " the most charming child I ever saw " and that " the Duchess of Kent is a very sensible person , who educates her ( Victoria ) remarkably well . " Arbuthnot 's impressions of the Duchess were less than candid , and not shared by Wellington and other establishment figures . However , had Arbuthnot 's own character not been judged respectable an audience with the infant princess would not have been permitted . 
 Many references in Arbuthnot 's diary , however , are less respectful than those she accorded to the Duchess of Kent . Wellington and Arbuthnot often travelled together , and a visit to Blenheim Palace they shared in 1824 provoked a scathing entry in her journal concerning Wellington 's fellow duke the 5th Duke of Marlborough , of whom she wrote : " The family of the great General is , however , gone sadly to decay , and are but a disgrace to the illustrious name of Churchill , which they have chosen this moment to resume . The present Duke is overloaded with debt , is very little better than a common swindler " . 
 When Wellington and the Tories fell from power in November 1830 , Arbuthnot lost interest in her diary , writing : " I shall write very seldom now , I dare say , in my book , for , except the Duke , none of the public men interest me . " Her account of the break @-@ up of the Tory party is a thoroughly partisan narration , accurate as to happenings outside the Tory inner circle , but on a broader scale and not so completely political as that of Henry Hobhouse . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Arbuthnot died suddenly of cholera at a farmhouse near the <unk> ' seat , Woodford House , near Kettering in Northamptonshire , in the summer of 1834 . Immediately after her death an express message was sent to Apsley House . The messenger , however , had to divert to Hatfield House where Wellington was dining with the Marquess and Marchioness of Salisbury . After her death , it was revealed she had been on a civil list pension of £ 936 per annum ( £ 76 @,@ 000 per year as of 2016 ) since January 1823 . 
 The exact nature of Arbuthnot 's relationship with Wellington has always been a subject for conjecture . Fuel was added to the speculations when Wellington was immediately pursued by female admirers following her death . One was a Miss Jenkins who , from the moment of Arbuthnot 's death , pursued him " body and soul . " Another , who resurfaced from his past , was Arbuthnot 's own cousin , the eccentric Lady Georgiana Fane , who constantly pestered Wellington with threats to publish intimate letters he had once sent her , and to sue him for , allegedly , reneging on a promise to marry her . It seems most likely that in addition to assisting Wellington with his social life , Harriet 's presence at his side protected him from the advances of other women . The Duke certainly kept mistresses during the period he knew Arbuthnot , but it has never been proven that Harriet was one of them . The tour at Apsley House , the Duke 's London residence , asserts that she merely served as his hostess at political dinners . 
 After her death , Charles left Woodford House and lived with his close friend Wellington . Charles died at Apsley House in 1850 , aged 83 . During their time together the two elderly men mourned the loss of Arbuthnot and bemoaned the splits developing within the Tory party . Wellington lived on for another two years and was buried with due pomp and circumstance in St Paul 's Cathedral . Harriet Arbuthnot had been buried with the Fane family at St Nicholas ' parish church , Fulbeck .

 The Battle of Iron Works Hill , also known as the Battle of Mount Holly , was a series of minor skirmishes that took place on December 22 and 23 , 1776 , during the American War of Independence . They took place in Mount Holly , New Jersey , between an American force mostly composed of colonial militia under Colonel Samuel Griffin and a force of 2 @,@ 000 Hessians and British regulars under Carl von Donop . 
 While the American force of 600 was eventually forced from their positions by the larger Hessian force , the action prevented von Donop from being in his assigned base at Bordentown , New Jersey and in a position to assist Johann Rall 's brigade in Trenton , New Jersey when it was attacked and defeated by George Washington after his troops crossed the Delaware on the night of December 25 – 26 .

 In July 1776 forces of Great Britain under the command of General William Howe landed on Staten Island . Over the next several months , Howe 's forces , which were British Army regulars and auxiliary German troops usually referred to as Hessian , chased George Washington 's Continental Army out of New York City and across New Jersey . Washington 's army , which was shrinking in size due to expiring enlistments , and desertions due to poor morale , took refuge in Pennsylvania on the western shore of the Delaware River in November , removing all the available watercraft to deny the British any opportunity to cross the wide river . 
 General Howe established a chain of outposts across New Jersey , and ordered his troops into winter quarters . The southernmost outposts were located at Trenton and Bordentown . The Trenton outpost was manned by about 1 @,@ 500 men of a Hessian brigade under the command of Johann Rall , and the Bordentown outpost was manned by Hessians and the British 42nd Regiment contingents , about 2 @,@ 000 troops in all , under the command of the Hessian Colonel Carl von Donop . Bordentown itself was not large enough to house all of von Donop 's force . While he had hoped to quarter some troops even further south at Burlington , where there was strong Loyalist support , floating gun batteries from the Pennsylvania Navy threatened the town , and Donop , rather than expose Loyalist allies to their fire , was forced to scatter his troops throughout the surrounding countryside . 
 As the troops of von Donop and Rall occupied the last outposts , they were often exposed to the actions of rebel raids and the actions of Patriot militia forces that either arose spontaneously or were recruited by Army regulars . These actions frayed the nerves of the troops , as the uncertainty of when and where such attacks would take place , and by what size force , put the men and their commanders on edge , leading them to jump up to investigate every rumored movement . Rall went so far as to order his men to sleep " fully dressed like [ they were ] on watch . " 
 One militia force that rose in December 1776 was a company under the command of Virginia Colonel Samuel Griffin . Griffin ( whose name is sometimes misspelled " Griffith " ) was the adjutant to General Israel Putnam , who was responsible for the defense of Philadelphia . Griffin 's force , whose exact composition is uncertain , probably included some Virginia artillerymen , Pennsylvania infantry , and New Jersey militia , and numbered five to six hundred . By mid @-@ December he had reached Moorestown , about ten miles southwest of Mount Holly . By December 21 , Griffin had advanced to Mount Holly and established a rough fortification atop a hill near an iron works , south of the Rancocas Creek and the village center . Von Donop sent a Loyalist to investigate , who reported a force of " not above eight hundred , nearly one half boys , and all of them Militia a very few from Pennsylvania excepted " . Thomas Stirling , who commanded a contingent of the 42nd positioned about seven miles north of Mount Holly at Blackhorse ( present @-@ day Columbus ) , heard rumors that there were 1 @,@ 000 rebels at Mount Holly and " 2 @,@ 000 more were in the rear to support them " . When von Donop asked Stirling for advice , he replied , " You sir , with the troops at Bordentown , should come here and attack . I am confident we are a match for them . " 
 = = Battle = = 
 On December 21 , about 600 of Griffin 's troops overwhelmed a guard outpost of the 42nd located about one mile south of Blackhorse at Petticoat Bridge . On the evening of December 22 , Washington 's adjutant , Joseph Reed , went to Mount Holly and met with Griffin . Griffin had written to Reed , requesting small field pieces to assist in their actions , and Reed , who had been discussing a planned attack on Rall 's men in Trenton with Washington , wanted to see if Griffin 's company could participate in some sort of diversionary attack . Griffin was ill , and his men poorly equipped for significant action , but they apparently agreed to some sort of actions the next day . 
 On the morning of December 23 , von Donop brought about 3 @,@ 000 troops ( the 42nd British ( Highland ) Regiment and the Hessian Grenadier battalions Block and Linsing ) to Petticoat Bridge where they overwhelmed Griffin 's men . Griffin 's troops retreated to Mount Holly where von Donop reported scattering about 1 @,@ 000 men near the town 's meeting house . Jäger Captain Johann Ewald reported that " some 100 men " were posted on a hill " near the church " , who " retired quickly " after a few rounds of artillery were fired . Griffin , whose troops had occupied Mount Holly , slowly retreated to their fortified position on the hill , following which the two sides engaged in ineffectual long @-@ range fire . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Von Donop 's forces bivouacked in Mount Holly on the night of December 23 , where , according to Ewald , they plundered the town , breaking into alcohol stores of abandoned houses and getting drunk . Von Donop himself took quarters in the house that Ewald described as belonging to an " exceedingly beautiful widow of a doctor " , whose identity is uncertain . The next day , December 24 , they moved in force to drive the militia from the hill , but Griffin and his men had retreated to Moorestown during the night . For whatever reason , von Donop and his contingents remained in Mount Holly , 18 miles ( 29 km ) and a full day 's march from Trenton , until a messenger arrived on December 26 , bringing the news of Rall 's defeat by Washington that morning . 
 News of the skirmishes at Mount Holly was often exaggerated . Published accounts of the day varied , including among participants in the battle . One Pennsylvanian claimed that sixteen of the enemy were killed , while a New Jersey militiaman reported seven enemy killed . Both Donop and Ewald specifically denied any British or German casualties occurred during the first skirmish on December 22 , while the Pennsylvania Evening Post reported " several " enemy casualties with " two killed and seven or eight wounded " of the militia through the whole action . 
 Some reporters , including Loyalist Joseph Galloway , assumed that Griffin had been specifically sent to draw von Donop away from Bordentown , but von Donop 's decision to attack in force was apparently made prior to Reed 's arrival . Reed noted in his journal that " this <unk> [ sic ] , though perfectly accidental , had a happy effect as it drew off Count Donop .... " The planning for Washington 's crossing of the Delaware did include sending a militia force to Griffin in an attack on von Donop at Mount Holly ; this company failed to cross the river .

 The hill that Griffin 's militia occupied is located at Iron Works Park in Mount Holly . The battle is reenacted annually .

 The bare @-@ tailed woolly opossum ( Caluromys philander ) is an opossum from South America . It was first described by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 . The bare @-@ tailed woolly opossum is characterized by a gray head , brown to gray coat , orange to gray underside and a partially naked tail . It is nocturnal ( active mainly at night ) and solitary ; there is hardly any social interaction except between mother and juveniles and in mating pairs . The opossum constructs nests in tree cavities , and its litter size ranges from one to seven . Gestation lasts 25 days , and the juveniles exit the pouch after three months ; weaning occurs a month later . The bare @-@ tailed woolly opossum inhabits subtropical forests , rainforests , secondary forests and plantations ; its range extends from northern Venezuela to northeastern and <unk> Brazil . The IUCN <unk> this opossum as least concern .

 The bare @-@ tailed woolly opossum is one of the three members of Caluromys , and is placed in the family <unk> in the marsupial order <unk> . It was first described by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus as Didelphis philander in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae ( 1758 ) . It was given its present binomial name , Caluromys philander , by American zoologist Joel Asaph Allen in 1900 . A 1955 revision of marsupial phylogeny grouped Caluromys , <unk> , <unk> ( <unk> del monte ) and <unk> ( bushy @-@ tailed opossum ) under a single subfamily , <unk> , noting the dental similarities among these . A 1977 study argued that these similarities are the result of convergent evolution , and placed Caluromys , <unk> and <unk> in a new subfamily , <unk> . In another similar revision in 2009 , the bushy @-@ tailed opossum was placed in its own subfamily , <unk> . 
 The following four subspecies are recognized : 
 C. p. affinis Wagner , 1842 : Occurs in Mato Grosso ( Brazil ) and Bolivia . 
 C. p. <unk> Wagner , 1842 : Occurs in eastern and southeastern Brazil . 
 C. p. philander Linnaeus , 1758 : Occurs to the east of Rio Negro in Brazil , the Guianas , and to the south of the Orinoco River in Venezuela . 
 C. p. <unk> Thomas , 1894 : Occurs in Trinidad and to the north of the Orinoco River in Venezuela .

 The bare @-@ tailed woolly opossum is characterized by a brown to gray coat , gray head , orange to gray underside and a partially naked tail furry at the base . A distinctive , narrow dark brown stripe runs between the eyes and the ears , from the tip of the nose to the back of the ears . Similar but broad streaks run from brown rings around either eye . <unk> fur separates these stripes from one another . Ears are large and almost always hairless . The coat is thick , soft and woolly ; the flanks may be grayer than the back . The dorsal hairs continue up to 5 – 7 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 0 – 2 @.@ 8 in ) onto the tail , after which it is naked , as the name suggests . The tail is dark brown towards the end , spotted with white and dark brown , terminating in a white or yellowish white tip . 
 The size appears to decrease from Venezuela to Suriname ; the mean weight is 170 grams ( 6 @.@ 0 oz ) in Venezuela and 250 grams ( 8 @.@ 8 oz ) in Suriname . The head @-@ and @-@ body length is typically between 16 and 26 centimetres ( 6 @.@ 3 and 10 @.@ 2 in ) . The ears measure 3 to 3 @.@ 5 centimetres ( 1 @.@ 2 to 1 @.@ 4 in ) , the tail 25 to 36 centimetres ( 9 @.@ 8 to 14 @.@ 2 in ) and the hind feet 3 @.@ 2 to 3 @.@ 9 centimetres ( 1 @.@ 3 to 1 @.@ 5 in ) .

 = = Ecology and behavior = = 
 The bare @-@ tailed woolly opossum is nocturnal ( active mainly at night ) , and thus difficult to observe or capture . Nevertheless , it is one of the very few opossums that have been successfully studied in detail . A study showed that activity of bare @-@ tailed woolly opossums can be affected by the extent of moonlight . While activity in males dropped from new moon to full moon ( that is , with increasing exposure to moonlight ) , activity in females remained largely unaffected . The opossum is arboreal ( tree @-@ living ) and a good climber . A study showed that the tail , being prehensile , can act as an additional limb for locomotion , avoiding falls and carrying leaves to build nests . It builds nests with dry leaves in tree cavities . 
 Individuals tend to be aggressive to one another ; hisses , grunts and even distress calls accompany agonistic behavior . Largely solitary , the only interactions observed are between mother and juveniles and in a mating pair . In a primary forest of French Guiana , the mean home range size was calculated as 3 hectares ( 0 @.@ 012 sq mi ) . Ranges of both sexes overlapped extensively . The size of home ranges is influenced by environmental factors such as forage availability and individual needs . ' Click 's are a common vocalization , produced by the young as well as adults . Bare @-@ tailed woolly opossums , like other Caluromys species , will bite on being handled or to escape predators . Predators include the jaguarundi and <unk> .

 An omnivore , the bare @-@ tailed woolly opossum feeds on fruits , vegetables , gum , nectar , small birds and reptiles . A study of the foraging behavior of the bare @-@ tailed woolly opossum and the sympatric kinkajou showed that both feed on a variety of plants , choose plants by their abundance , show similar preferences , and favor certain plant parts at certain times of the year . A notable difference between the two was that while the kinkajou focused on plants with a wide distribution , the bare @-@ tailed woolly opossum also fed on less common plants .

A study in French Guiana showed that development of the offspring is slow for the first 40 days , and then accelerates during the last 40 days . The litter size ranges from one to seven . Newborn weigh 200 milligrams ( 0 @.@ 0071 oz ) , and their weight increases to 11 grams ( 0 @.@ 39 oz ) after weaning . After exiting the pouch , offspring are sheltered in nests , where the mother regularly visits them for nursing .

 The bare @-@ tailed woolly opossum inhabits subtropical forests , rainforests , secondary forests and plantations ; it prefers dense cover , though it can be seen on canopies as well . It can occur up to an altitude of 1 @,@ 200 – 1 @,@ 800 metres ( 3 @,@ 900 – 5 @,@ 900 ft ) above the sea level . The range extends from northern Venezuela eastward to northeastern and <unk> Brazil , and includes Guiana , French Guiana , Margarita Island , Trinidad , and Suriname . The IUCN classifies the bare @-@ tailed woolly opossum as least concern , due to its wide distribution and presumably large population . The survival of this opossum is threatened by deforestation and habitat loss .

 Dark Magus is a live double album by American jazz composer and trumpeter Miles Davis . It was recorded on March 30 , 1974 , at Carnegie Hall in New York City . Davis ' group at the time included bassist Michael Henderson , drummer Al Foster , percussionist James Mtume , saxophonist Dave Liebman , and guitarists Pete Cosey and Reggie Lucas . He also used the show to audition saxophonist Azar Lawrence and guitarist Dominique Gaumont . Dark Magus was produced by Teo Macero and featured four two @-@ part recordings titled after Swahili names for the numbers one through four . 
 Dark Magus was released after Davis ' 1975 retirement , upon which his label , Columbia Records , issued several albums of various outtakes . After releasing the live recordings Agharta ( 1975 ) and Pangaea ( 1976 ) , Columbia decided that they did not approve of the albums and released Dark Magus only in Japan . It was issued in 1977 by CBS @-@ Sony . The label 's A & R executive Tatsu Nosaki suggested the album 's title , which referred to the Magus from the Zoroastrian religion . 
 Along with Davis ' other records during the 1970s , Dark Magus was received ambivalently by contemporary music critics , but it inspired noise rock acts during the late 1970s and the experimental funk artists of the 1980s . The album was not released in the United States until July 1997 , when it was reissued by Sony Records and Legacy Records . In retrospective reviews , critics praised its jazz @-@ rock aesthetic and the group members ' performances , and some believed certain parts foreshadowed jungle music .

 Davis was 47 years old when he was asked to play Carnegie Hall in 1974 , which followed four years of relentless touring . He had played the venue numerous times before and recorded a live album there in 1961 . By 1974 , Davis had been dealing with depression , cocaine and sex addictions , and several health problems , including osteoarthritis , bursitis , and sickle @-@ cell anemia . He had also lost respect with both critics and his contemporaries because of his musical explorations into more rock- and funk @-@ oriented sounds . Influenced by Karlheinz Stockhausen , Davis wanted to avoid individual songs and instead record extended movements that developed into a different composition . He played his trumpet sparsely and became less of the focal point for his band , whom he allowed more freedom to improvise and with whom he rarely rehearsed , so that the young musicians he enlisted would be tested to learn and play together onstage . 
 The March 30 , 1974 , concert featured an ethnically and age @-@ diverse audience that included young hippies and old , wealthy attendees . According to Magnet magazine 's Bryan Bierman , " the hip , ' with it ' kids [ sat ] side @-@ by @-@ side with middle @-@ aged <unk> couples , expecting to hear ' My Funny Valentine . ' " Although he lived 15 minutes away , Davis arrived at the venue more than an hour late . When the band walked out onstage , he followed with his back turned to the audience . He casually strolled onstage while the band was setting up and began to play , to which they responded by playing a dense rhythm in unison . Saxophonist Dave Liebman , who wrote the liner notes for Dark Magus , later said of how the show began : " It is his whim .. That 's the thing ! ... Miles can do that and have three thousand musicians follow him . Right ? So what I learned in that respect from Miles was to be able to watch him and be on his case " . 
 Davis also used the show to audition two new members — tenor saxophonist Azar Lawrence and guitarist Dominique Gaumont . Lawrence was the most highly regarded young saxophonist at the time ; Davis enlisted Gaumont in response to incumbent guitarist Reggie Lucas 's demand for a pay raise . Although it was unexpected , Liebman later characterized the move as typical of Davis : " What he was doing — which he often does at big kinda gigs like that — is change the shit up , by doing something totally out . Totally unexpected . I mean , we had been a band together on the road for a year ... And then , suddenly , a live date , New York City , Carnegie Hall , the cat pulls two cats who never even saw each other . I mean , you gotta say , ' Is the man mad or is he – he 's either mad or extremely subtle . " 
 = = Composition and performance = = 
 Dark Magus features four two @-@ part compositions with an average length of 25 minutes each . The album 's music was unrehearsed and eschewed melody for improvisations around funk rhythms and grooves . According to AllMusic 's Thom Jurek , rhythms , colors , and keys " would shift and change on a whim from Davis . " Davis eschewed his previous performances ' keyboardists for a three @-@ guitar line @-@ up of Reggie Lucas , Dominique Gaumont , and Pete Cosey , who had a penchant for guitar wails and pedal effects . Davis often stopped the band with hand signals and created empty spaces , which were longer than traditional jazz breaks , and encouraged the soloists to fill them with exaggerated cadenzas . 
 Davis only soloed intermittently or played his Yamaha organ . He played trumpet on " Moja " and both trumpet and organ on the other pieces . The second half of " Moja " is distinguished by a long ballad sequence introduced by Liebman and continued by Lucas and Davis . " Moja " also included a theme from " Nne " . On " Tatu " , Gaumont followed Lucas 's solo with a long passage characterized by fuzzy wah @-@ wah effects , and Lawrence played briefly with Liebman in a duet before his own disjointed solo . " Tatu " ended with a rendition of " Calypso <unk> " . During the first part of " Nne " , they played the Davis @-@ penned composition " Ife " . Near the end of " Nne " , Davis played a short blues . 
 Robert Christgau described the aesthetic on Dark Magus as a culmination of Davis ' previous albums and " bifurcated , like jazz @-@ rock again " . He argued that Davis left the two elements — jazz and rock — " distinct and recognizable " , whereas " pure funk " would have subsumed them both " in a new conception , albeit one that " favors rock . Christgau attributed the album 's jazz input to Lawrence 's " <unk> " saxophone , and the rock elements to guitarists Lucas and Gaumont , who " wah @-@ riff [ ed ] the rhythm " , and Pete Cosey , who produced " his own wah @-@ wah @-@ inflected noise into the arena @-@ rock stratosphere . " Erik Davis compared Davis ' trumpet sound to " a mournful but pissed @-@ off banshee " , and Cosey , Lucas , and Gaumont to " somewhere between and beyond James Brown and Can " , amid " quiet percussion passages [ that ] emerge like moonlit clearings " .

 Dark Magus was released after Davis ' retirement , when his label , Columbia Records , issued several albums of various outtakes . They released his live albums Agharta ( 1975 ) and Pangaea ( 1976 ) , but ultimately did not approve of Davis ' live recordings and chose to issue Dark Magus only in Japan . It was released in 1977 by CBS @-@ Sony , who used several engineering fades in the album 's production to shorten the original concert for the final release . The album 's four tracks were titled after Swahili names for the numbers one through four . Its title was suggested by Tatsu Nosaki , an A & R executive from CBS @-@ Sony , who were producing the album . According to Nosaki , " Magus ... is the founder of the ancient Persian religion , Zoroastrianism . " The album was not released in the United States until July 1997 , when it was reissued by Sony Records and Legacy Records . It was part of the labels ' reissue of five two @-@ disc live albums by Davis , including Black Beauty : Miles Davis at Fillmore West ( 1970 ) , Miles Davis at Fillmore ( 1970 ) , Live @-@ Evil ( 1971 ) , and In Concert ( 1973 ) . The reissued albums featured liner notes written by his sidemen . 
 Along with Davis ' other 1970s records , Dark Magus was received ambivalently by contemporary critics but became an inspiration to late 1970s noise rock acts and the experimental funk artists of the 1980s . Its 1997 reissue was ranked by Christgau as the 10th best album of the year in his list for The Village Voice 's annual Pazz & Jop critics ' poll . In 2001 , Q named it one of the " 50 Heaviest Albums of All Time " and called it " a maelstrom of uncut improvisational fury ... arguably the furthest out Miles ever got " . David Keenan placed it on his all @-@ time 105 best albums list for the Sunday Herald and said by ornamenting heavy grooves with tribal percussive instruments , wah @-@ wah effects , and otherworldly trumpet bursts , Davis had instinctively fused the most advanced elements of modern African @-@ American music . According to CODA critic Greg Masters , Davis created among the most darkest and radical auras , feelings , and moods in 20th @-@ century music on Dark Magus . 
 In a retrospective review for JazzTimes , Tom Terrell said that the album 's kind of music would never be heard again and described it as " tomorrow 's sound yesterday ... a terrifyingly exhilarating aural asylum of wails , howls , <unk> , <unk> , telltale heartbeats , wah wah quacks , white noise and loud silences . " According to Down Beat , the frantic burbles of congas on " Moja " and " Tatu " predated oldschool jungle by 20 years , while Spin magazine 's Erik Davis found its anguished , ferocious music extremely impressive , especially when listened to loud . He contended that the group improvisation on tracks such as " Wili " foreshadowed the drum ' n ' bass genre : " Miles was invoking the primordial powers of the electronic urban jungle " . In The Penguin Guide to Jazz ( 1998 ) , Richard Cook and Brian Morton wrote that each performance comprises only " shadings and <unk> of sound , and as one gets to know these recordings better one becomes almost fixated on the tiniest <unk> . " Pitchfork Media critic Jason Josephes viewed it as a highly valued Davis album that invokes a sense of coolness in listeners : 
 Just when you think the shit can 't get much higher , Miles comes in and hits the wah @-@ wah down hard on the horn and the next thing you know , you 're <unk> ' five to the man upstairs ... By the rite of Dark Magus , I can fake the cool in no time flat . 
 In The Rolling Stone Album Guide ( 2004 ) , J. D. Considine wrote that Dark Magus expressed the band 's surging rhythms better than In Concert and offered a balance between their affinity for improvisation amidst their desire to rock . Jeff McCord of The Austin Chronicle found the performances impassioned , enduring , and highlighted by effectively competitive playing between each duo of saxophonists and guitarists . According to John Szwed , it has moments when all three guitarists and two saxophonists are " in dense and exalted free improvisation together , and Pete Cosey 's tunings , effects , excess , and sheer inventiveness took the guitar to the point where Hendrix , free jazz , and rhythm and blues proudly merged together . " By contrast , Don Heckman of the Los Angeles Times found the funk rhythms repetitive and Davis ' playing both limited and unexceptional . He panned the presence of tablas , electric sitar , and multiple guitars , and the music 's similarity to Hendrix , Sly Stone , and James Brown . AllMusic 's Thom Jurek called it an exaggerated and excessive showcase of Davis ' disoriented psyche and felt that , although the rhythm section is historically captivating , the other musicians ' playing is inconsistent , albeit enthralling .

 " Tuvix " is the 40th episode ( 24th in the second season ) of the science fiction television program Star Trek : Voyager . The episode originally aired on May 6 , 1996 , and tells the story of Tuvok and Neelix being merged into a unique third character named Tuvix . 
 The episode was substantially rewritten from its original incarnation as a lighthearted story to a more somber tale with serious moral and ethical implications . Tom Wright guest stars as Tuvix to lend more credence to a unique new character that consists of equal parts Tuvok and Neelix . Both director Cliff Bole and Wright himself had reservations about the latter 's take on the character , and despite a perceived lack of support , Wright still praised the Voyager cast and crew . Both the story and performances of " Tuvix " were lauded by the production team and critics alike . 
 Researchers and critics found " Tuvix " teeming with technical and philosophical content , including thematic ties to other episodes in the Star Trek canon , real @-@ world logical and metaphysical ramifications , and scientific concessions for the story . " Tuvix " was well received by fans and television critics , earning approval ratings between 75 – 80 % ; the Tuvix character and Janeway 's forced separation of the same were particularly polarizing among the episode 's audience and distinguishes the episode for the copious feedback it generated . 
 = = Plot = = 
 On stardate <unk> @.@ 2 , Lieutenant Commander Tuvok ( Tim Russ ) and Neelix ( Ethan Phillips ) are sent to collect botanical samples from a discovered Class M planet . When beamed back aboard Voyager , the two men and the <unk> they collected are merged at the molecular level to become a single lifeform which names himself Tuvix ( Tom Wright ) . After ruling out transporter malfunction , the crew discovers that when <unk> in the matter stream , the genetic material of the alien orchids acted as a <unk> catalyst and is the culprit for the combination of the two crewmembers . Unfortunately , the process cannot be reversed , and Tuvix is accepted as a member of the crew with the rank of lieutenant , functioning as chief tactical officer in Tuvok 's stead . 
 Kes ( Jennifer Lien ) reacts poorly to Tuvix as his existence deprives her of both Tuvok and Neelix , her mentor and boyfriend respectively . Her displeasure lessens over the course of the episode , but never completely goes away . Captain Janeway ( Kate Mulgrew ) accepts Tuvix in his role as an excellent chief tactical officer and " an able advisor , who skillfully uses humor to make his points " . Tuvix himself , having the combined memories and personalities of his constituents , melds the previously intractable qualities of both and improves upon them , flexing either muscle as the situation requires : " Chief of security or head chef , take your pick ! " 
 Two weeks after the accident , the Doctor ( Robert Picardo ) develops a contemporary equivalent to barium sulfate ( BaSO4 ) <unk> using a custom radioisotope with which he can identify the disparate DNAs of the two original crewmen and use the transporter to disentangle the two . Tuvix denounces the procedure however . He argues that he has rights and that he doesn 't want to die , for to restore the two lost crewmen would require his execution . After discussing the situation with Commander Chakotay ( Robert Beltran ) , Kes , and Tuvix himself , Janeway ultimately decides to proceed with the separation , acting in absentia to protect the rights of the two original men . Tuvix makes a final emotive plea for support from the crew , but finds no supporters . After the Doctor refuses to take Tuvix 's life in compliance with the medical precept of doing no harm , Janeway performs the procedure herself and succeeds in restoring both Tuvok and Neelix .

 " Tuvix " was formerly known as " Untitled Tuvok / Neelix " , " One " , and " <unk> " , with the third of these persisting through the episode 's development and shooting . The episode and its teleplay were written by Kenneth Biller ; the story is credited to Andrew Shepard Price and Mark <unk> . Though described by Biller as " high @-@ concept " , the original story by Price and <unk> was much more light @-@ hearted and tended more towards slapstick . Biller and Brannon Braga felt the tone of the episode was so akin to a 1960s sitcom , the two of them even wrote a theme song for it . Biller re @-@ wrote the episode to focus more on the serious philosophical questions raised by the episode and especially the inevitable separation of Tuvix back into the series regulars . In Biller 's original treatment , Tuvix recognized that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few and consented to his fissure . However , after a discussion with executive producer Michael Piller , Biller began to " [ poke ] at the audience " by throwing up roadblocks to the episode 's foregone conclusion ; first Tuvix was re @-@ written to object to the procedure and then the Doctor 's refusal was added to force Captain Janeway to put truth to action . Piller later described Biller as " the poet laureate of Star Trek " , highlighting his work on " Tuvix " and " <unk> " as examples . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Director Cliff Bole and the episode 's producers originally considered having series regular Ethan Phillips ( Neelix ) portray Tuvix , but decided against it fearing that he was too identifiable and would have difficulty integrating an equal amount of Tuvok 's character into his performance . Casting for " Tuvix " was done by Junie Lowry @-@ Johnson , C.S.A. , and Ron Surma . 
 The only non @-@ recurring guest star in " Tuvix " is the eponymous fusion of two main characters . Though guest stars have occasionally played major recurring characters — e.g. , Sandra Smith as Captain Kirk in the original Star Trek 's " Turnabout Intruder " and David Birkin as Captain Picard in Star Trek : The Next Generation 's " Rascals " — Tom Wright is the first to portray two in the same episode . 
 When contacted by his talent agent , Wright jumped at the opportunity to create a character wholly unique to the Star Trek franchise . When he auditioned for the role of Tuvix , Wright had never seen Star Trek : Voyager and was completely unfamiliar with the characterizations of Tuvok and Neelix . Instead , he drew upon his prior experiences with the characters ' actors , Tim Russ and Ethan Phillips respectively , to successfully vie for the role . Executive producer Jeri Taylor was pleased with the casting of Wright , marveling at his ability to bring credibility to the prospect of two characters in one . 
 After securing the role , Wright was provided video of Tuvok and Neelix from previous episodes from which he refined the character . Instead of portraying Tuvix as simply a vessel for two separate consciousnesses , Wright blended the two characters to form a unique third . Wright focused on juxtaposing the contrary physical and emotional natures of the two characters in his performance ; in scenes where Neelix 's persona is more prominent , Wright played up Tuvok 's composed physicality , and in scenes where Tuvok 's skills and experience were needed , Wright leaned more heavily on Neelix 's exuberant mannerisms . Wright also worked hard to exhibit the intrinsic warmth of both characters and make Tuvix as likable and sympathetic a character as possible . Author David McIntee ( Delta Quadrant ) felt that Tuvix expressed more of Neelix 's mannerisms than Tuvok 's . He also noted that Tuvix adopted Neelix 's right @-@ handedness as opposed to Tuvok 's left @-@ handedness .

 McIntee hypothesizes that the modified Starfleet uniform Tuvix initially wears after his creation was influenced by the orchids which were also transported . He called it " an illogical but subtle and attractive stylistic touch " and praised its design suggesting they all be modified duly . Robert Blackman served as costume designer for " Tuvix " . 
 In an interview with The Official Star Trek Voyager Magazine in 1998 , director Cliff Bole spoke highly of guest star Tom Wright , saying he was a " good actor [ who ] prides himself on being Shakespearian " , but felt that he was in over his head working on Star Trek , particularly underestimating the rigors of working under the requisite makeup . Bole detailed a four @-@ hour , 4 a.m. process to apply the glue , mask , and prostheses before the actor even began delivering his lines for what was an all @-@ day shoot ; all of these " subtract from [ the ] performance " of actors unaccustomed to them . Bole tempered himself explaining that he had seen " really competent actors " suffer from the same trials and simple exhaustion that he saw in Wright 's performance . For his part , Wright compared the trials of the " heavy makeup " and contact lenses required to play Tuvix with his previous roles on Creepshow 2 and Tales from the Crypt . Tuvix 's makeup was designed and supervised by Michael Westmore .

 Tom Wright described working on " Tuvix " as an exercise in forcing himself to work outside his known comfort areas and confessed he was unsure of the quality of the end product . The actor complained about what he saw as a lack of support and guidance from the Voyager team , saying he felt adrift and unsure as to what was expected of his performance , especially since his portrayal reflected two of the starring characters . However , he also conceded that it may have been intentional in an effort to evoke a genuine sense of off @-@ <unk> in the character . Either way , though he was unaccustomed to the environment , Wright expressed his willingness to revisit Tuvix or even work on any Star Trek again if the opportunity arose . In interviews , Wright specifically fondly recalled his time working with Jennifer Lien ( Kes ) , Kate Mulgrew ( Captain Janeway ) , and director Cliff Bole . 
 In a 1997 interview , Wright explained how the episode 's dialogue posed a challenge in that not only did he have to take great care to adhere to the vernacular of Star Trek and not sound too contemporary or " too 1997 " , but he had to take several days to accommodate himself to the episode 's " <unk> " with the assistance of Robert Duncan McNeill ( Tom Paris ) . Director Cliff Bole later praised Wright for his ability to improvise , but explained that it was to the actor 's detriment as " Star Trek is not an ad @-@ lib format " , and he felt Wright assumed he could wing some of it . Mulgrew also bemoaned the technobabble in " Tuvix " when asked by Starlog for her " most memorable line of technobabble " ; " When did he cease to be a transporter accident and start to be an individual ? " 
 Bole heaped praise on the episode 's final scene in which Janeway " stalks " into the corridor outside sickbay after performing the procedure which restores Tuvok and Neelix . He extolled , " That last shot I did with Kate [ Mulgrew ] , as she 's walking into the camera , she told the whole story with her face . She gave a great performance . I only asked for a few things ; she brought that look and emotion to work with her . " In his book The Meaning of Star Trek , author Thomas Richards also credited Mulgrew in this scene . Richards saw Janeway troubled by her difficult decision between two undesirable options and how " she must live with the choice . [ A ] death has cast a shadow over the ship , and for the first time in the series the Federation has put to death one of its own . " 
 In a 1996 interview with Cinefantastique , Robert Picardo reminisced that as the Doctor he had " a substantial amount " to do in " Tuvix " . Picardo would also look back on the episode , and the scene in which he " countermand [ s ] the captain " especially , as a turning point in the Doctor 's and Janeway 's relationship , calling it an " interesting moment for both characters " . Ethan Phillips would also remember being excited reading the script for " Tuvix " as an opportunity to discover more about his character .

 Elaine L. Graham 's book Representations of the Post / Human uses " Tuvix " to contrast Star Trek : Voyager with Star Trek : The Next Generation ; " Tuvix " is an example of how the former series tended to incorporate stories that touched on moral and ethically ambiguous situations and decisions . Graham notes how the character of Tuvix was written to encourage audience sympathies , yet was still effectively sentenced to death in contravention of what she describes as the " exemplary Star Trek values [ of ] sentience , self @-@ determination , and personhood " . Thomas Richards ' The Meaning of Star Trek also focused on the morality of decisions in " Tuvix " as compared to the original Star Trek and The Next Generation ; more than Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , the Voyager is far from the United Federation of Planets and " must address every value of the Federation [ ... ] in a universe in which those values may no longer apply . " Richards describes the episode as " truly remarkable " for its depiction of Janeway 's sentence of capital punishment and her performing the very first execution in all of Star Trek . Not only is this shocking for the audience in comparison to episodes and series past , but even the fictional Voyager crew are stunned . In 2000 , David McIntee pointed to these themes and plot points as having made " Tuvix " the most debated episode in Star Trek fandom yet , and one of Star Trek : Voyager 's " most thought @-@ provoking , and [ ... ] single most discussed , episode . " 
 In her book American Science Fiction TV , Jan Johnson @-@ Smith noted that " Tuvix " is one of a recurring type of Star Trek episodes concerned with issues of individuality and self . She thematically tied this episode to Star Trek : The Original Series ' episode " The Enemy Within " where the transporter <unk> Captain Kirk into two separate representations of his psyche , Star Trek : Voyager 's episode " Faces " where hybrid Human / Klingon character B 'Elanna Torres is split along her bloodline into two separate species , and Star Trek : Deep Space Nine 's character of Jadzia Dax who is of a conjoined species ( Trill ) that repeatedly goes through a <unk> process when the host organism dies . When asked regarding accusations of " Tuvix " and other Voyager episodes simply aping previous Star Trek series in this way , executive producer Michael Piller called out Time magazine for their comments on the matter before conceding , " [ Y ] ou 've got to keep new people coming in and pitching because otherwise you 're going to be retreading an old ground . " Seven years later , when writing Star Trek : Enterprise 's " Similitude " , Manny Coto would take pains to write that episode to be dissimilar to " Tuvix " . 
 In his paper published in the Polish Journal of Philosophy , University of Sussex professor Murali Ramachandran examines the combination of Tuvok and Neelix into a single individual for its implications to modal logic . Mr. Ramachandran , though forced to disregard the metaphysical considerations imposed by " the very nature of tele @-@ transportation " , promotes a " <unk> counterpart theory " using this study of the characters . 
 Athena Andreadis ' book To Seek Out New Life : The Biology of Star Trek attempts and fails to legitimize the episode 's biologic science , even accepting all other technologies presented . Not only does the synthesis of Tuvix violate the law of conservation of mass , but the separation poses the problem of differentiating the two species ' genes , a significant hurdle when science of the 1990s couldn 't differentiate between humans and chimpanzees . After detailing the combination of the <unk> and Vulcan species , the cellular chromosomal pairing , and the " synaptic coherence of two brains / minds within one skull " , Andreadis finds the whole proposition laughable from a scientific standpoint , comparing it to the 1986 film The Fly as an example of bad science . Ultimately , she comes down against the transporter regarding its fictional capacity to do that which is claimed .

 Tom Wright spoke on his interpretation of the character in 1997 ; he felt the two constituent halves of Tuvix " represent [ ed ] the left and the right side of the brain — where one is weak the other is strong , and vice versa . " 
 In his 2005 book , <unk> : The Impossible Leap , David J. Darling notes that while Tuvix was well @-@ liked by other characters , his fate was in fact ultimately determined not by his arguments or the decision of the captain , but by the " [ e ] <unk> casting and contractual arrangements " of the show . Wright also felt the separation of Tuvix was inevitable from a perspective of dramatic necessity . The UPN promotional video for the episode played on expectations of the audience to like Tuvix at the cost of the Tuvok and Neelix characters . 
 = = Reception = = 
 In an interview with Cinefantastique , writer Kenneth Biller said that he received a " lot of mail " regarding " Tuvix " and that Janeway 's tough decisions in the episode generated a lot of discussion and really moved a lot of people . Director Cliff Bole felt the episode was " well @-@ accepted " , and both he and the producers liked it . Actor Tom Wright explained the episode 's popularity saying it resounded with viewers because it had no outright <unk> or specific good and evil characters ; the episode deals with a no @-@ win scenario . Writer Thomas Richards concurred with Wright in agreeing that the episode 's frank depiction without any judgments was a significant strength in its favor . 
 Cinefantastique 's Dale Kutzera gave " Tuvix " three out of four stars , Nikki Harper for STAR TREK : The Official Monthly Magazine gave the episode four out of five stars , and Bill Florence for The Official Star Trek Voyager Magazine called it one of Voyager 's " strongest episodes to date " . In his book Delta Quadrant : The unofficial guide to Voyager , David McIntee was impressed by the episode 's capacity to rise above its " appallingly silly " premise ; McIntee attributes this to the casting of Tom Wright as Tuvix , whose acting he saw as a guide to the tempo of the episode , keeping it from proceeding too slowly . He gave the episode an 8 / 10 rating . In a list of the top 100 episodes of the Star Trek franchise , " Tuvix " was placed in 56th place by Charlie Jane Anders at io9 .

 Pe ̍ h @-@ ōe @-@ jī ( pronounced [ <unk> ˩ ue ˩ <unk> ˨ ] , abbreviated POJ , literally vernacular writing , also known as Church Romanization ) is an orthography used to write variants of Southern Min Chinese , particularly Taiwanese Southern Min and Amoy Hokkien . Developed by Western missionaries working among the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia in the 19th century and refined by missionaries working in Xiamen and Tainan , it uses a modified Latin alphabet and some diacritics to represent the spoken language . After initial success in Fujian , POJ became most widespread in Taiwan and , in the mid @-@ 20th century , there were over 100 @,@ 000 people literate in POJ . A large amount of printed material , religious and secular , has been produced in the script , including Taiwan 's first newspaper , the Taiwan Church News . 
 In Taiwan under Japanese rule ( 1895 – 1945 ) its use was suppressed and Pe ̍ h @-@ ōe @-@ jī faced further countermeasures during the Kuomintang martial law period ( 1947 – 1987 ) . In Fujian , use declined after the establishment of the People 's Republic of China ( 1949 ) and in the early 21st century the system was not in general use there . Taiwanese Christians , non @-@ native learners of Southern Min , and native @-@ speaker enthusiasts in Taiwan are among those that continue to use Pe ̍ h @-@ ōe @-@ jī . Full native computer support was developed in 2004 , and users can now call on fonts , input methods , and extensive online dictionaries . Rival writing systems have evolved , and there is ongoing debate within the Taiwanese mother tongue movement as to which system should be used . Versions of pe ̍ h @-@ ōe @-@ jī have been devised for other Chinese varieties , including Hakka and Teochew Southern Min . 
 = = Name = = 
 The name pe ̍ h @-@ ōe @-@ jī ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> zì ) means " vernacular writing , " written characters representing everyday spoken language . The name vernacular writing could be applied to many kinds of writing , romanized and character @-@ based , but the term pe ̍ h @-@ ōe @-@ jī is commonly restricted to the Southern Min romanization system developed by Presbyterian missionaries in the 19th century . 
 The missionaries who invented and refined the system used , instead of the name pe ̍ h @-@ ōe @-@ jī , various other terms , such as " Romanized Amoy Vernacular " and " Romanized Amoy Colloquial . " The origins of the system and its extensive use in the Christian community have led to it being known by some modern writers as " Church Romanization " ( <unk> ; <unk> <unk> ; <unk> @-@ <unk> Lô @-@ <unk> @-@ jī ) and is often abbreviated in POJ itself to <unk> @-@ lô . ( <unk> ; <unk> ) There is some debate on whether " pe ̍ h @-@ ōe @-@ jī " or " Church Romanization " is the more appropriate name . 
 Objections to " pe ̍ h @-@ ōe @-@ jī " are that it can refer to more than one system and that both literary and colloquial register Southern Min appear in the system and so describing it as " vernacular " writing might be inaccurate . Objections to " Church Romanization " are that some non @-@ Christians and some secular writing use it . One commentator observes that POJ " today is largely disassociated from its former religious purposes . " The term " romanization " is also disliked by some , who see it as belittling the status of pe ̍ h @-@ ōe @-@ jī by identifying it as a supplementary phonetic system instead of a fully @-@ fledged orthography . Sources disagree on which of the two is more commonly used . 
 = = History = = 
 The history of Peh @-@ oe @-@ ji has been heavily influenced by official attitudes towards the Southern Min vernaculars and the Christian organizations that propagated it . Early documents point to the purpose of the creation of POJ as being pedagogical in nature , closely allied to educating Christian converts . 
 = = = Early development = = = 
 The first people to use a romanized script to write Southern Min were Spanish missionaries in Manila in the 16th century . However , it was used mainly as a teaching aid for Spanish learners of Southern Min , and seems not to have had any influence on the development of pe ̍ h @-@ ōe @-@ jī . In the early 19th century , China was closed to Christian missionaries , who instead proselytized to overseas Chinese communities in South East Asia . The earliest origins of the system are found in a small vocabulary first printed in 1820 by Walter Henry Medhurst , who went on to publish the Dictionary of the Hok @-@ <unk> Dialect of the Chinese Language , According to the Reading and Colloquial Idioms in 1832 . 
 This dictionary represents the first major reference work in POJ , although the romanization within was quite different from the modern system , and has been dubbed Early Church Romanization by one scholar of the subject . Medhurst , who was stationed in Malacca , was influenced by Robert Morrison 's romanization of Mandarin Chinese , but had to innovate in several areas to reflect major differences between Mandarin and Southern Min . Several important developments occurred in Medhurst 's work , especially the application of consistent tone markings ( influenced by contemporary linguistic studies of Sanskrit , which was becoming of more mainstream interest to Western scholars ) . Medhurst was convinced that accurate representation and reproduction of the tonal structure of Southern Min was vital to comprehension : 
 Respecting these tones of the Chinese language , some difference of opinion has been obtained , and while some have considered them of first importance , others have paid them little or no intention . The author inclines decidedly to the former opinion ; having found , from uniform experience , that without strict attention to tones , it is impossible for a person to make himself understood in Hok @-@ <unk> . 
 The system expounded by Medhurst influenced later dictionary compilers with regard to tonal notation and initials , but both his complicated vowel system and his emphasis on the literary register of Southern Min were dropped by later writers . Following on from Medhurst 's work , Samuel Wells Williams became the chief proponent of major changes in the orthography devised by Morrison and adapted by Medhurst . Through personal communication and letters and articles printed in The Chinese Repository a consensus was arrived at for the new version of POJ , although Williams ' suggestions were largely not followed . 
 The first major work to represent this new orthography was Elihu Doty 's Anglo @-@ Chinese Manual with Romanized Colloquial in the Amoy Dialect , published in 1853 . The manual can therefore be regarded as the first presentation of a pre @-@ modern POJ , a significant step onwards from Medhurst 's orthography and different from today 's system in only a few details . From this point on various authors adjusted some of the consonants and vowels , but the system of tone marks from Doty 's Manual survives intact in modern POJ . John Van Nest Talmage has traditionally been regarded as the founder of POJ among the community which uses the orthography , although it now seems that he was an early promoter of the system , rather than its inventor . 
 In 1842 the Treaty of Nanking was concluded , which included among its provisions the creation of treaty ports in which Christian missionaries would be free to preach . Xiamen ( then known as Amoy ) was one of these treaty ports , and British , Canadian and American missionaries moved in to start preaching to the local inhabitants . These missionaries , housed in the cantonment of <unk> , created reference works and religious tracts , including a bible translation . Naturally , they based the pronunciation of their romanization on the speech of Xiamen , which became the de facto standard when they eventually moved into other areas of the Hokkien <unk> , most notably Taiwan . The 1858 Treaty of Tianjin officially opened Taiwan to western missionaries , and missionary societies were quick to send men to work in the field , usually after a sojourn in Xiamen to acquire the rudiments of the language . 
 = = = Maturity = = = 
 Quanzhou and Zhangzhou are two major varieties of Southern Min , and in Xiamen they combined to form something " not Quan , not Zhang " – i.e. not one or the other , but rather a fusion , which became known as Amoy Dialect or Amoy Chinese . In Taiwan , with its mixture of migrants from both Quanzhou and Zhangzhou , the linguistic situation was similar ; although the resulting blend in the southern city of Tainan differed from the Xiamen blend , it was close enough that the missionaries could ignore the differences and import their system wholesale . 
 The fact that religious tracts , dictionaries , and teaching guides already existed in the Xiamen tongue meant that the missionaries in Taiwan could begin proselytizing immediately , without the intervening time needed to write those materials . Missionary opinion was divided on whether POJ was desirable as an end in itself as a full @-@ fledged orthography , or as a means to literacy in Chinese characters . William Campbell described POJ as a step on the road to reading and writing the characters , claiming that to promote it as an independent writing system would inflame nationalist passions in China , where characters were considered a sacred part of Chinese culture . Taking the other side , Thomas Barclay believed that literacy in POJ should be a goal rather than a waypoint : 
 Soon after my arrival in Formosa I became firmly convinced of three things , and more than fifty years experience has strengthened my conviction . The first was that if you are to have a healthy , living Church it is necessary that all the members , men and women , read the Scriptures for themselves ; second , that this end can never be attained by the use of the Chinese character ; third , that it can be attained by the use of the alphabetic script , this Romanised Vernacular . 
 A great boon to the promotion of POJ in Taiwan came in 1880 when James Laidlaw Maxwell , a medical missionary based in Tainan , donated a small printing press to the local church , which Thomas Barclay learned how to operate in 1881 before founding the Presbyterian Church Press in 1884 . Subsequently the Taiwan Prefectural City Church News , which first appeared in 1885 and was produced by Barclay 's Presbyterian Church of Taiwan Press , became the first printed newspaper in Taiwan . 
 As other authors made their own alterations to the conventions laid down by Medhurst and Doty , pe ̍ h @-@ ōe @-@ jī evolved and eventually settled into its current form . Ernest <unk> 's 1934 pocket dictionary was the first reference work to reflect this modern spelling . Between Medhurst 's dictionary of 1832 and the standardization of POJ in <unk> 's time , there were a number of works published , which can be used to chart the change over time of pe ̍ h @-@ ōe @-@ jī : 
 Competition for POJ was introduced during the Japanese era in Taiwan ( 1895 – 1945 ) in the form of Taiwanese kana , a system designed as a teaching aid and pronunciation guide , rather than an independent orthography like POJ . From the 1930s onwards , with the increasing militarization of Japan and the <unk> movement encouraging Taiwanese people to " <unk> " , there were a raft of measures taken against native languages , including Taiwanese . While these moves resulted in a suppression of POJ , they were " a logical consequence of increasing the amount of education in Japanese , rather than an explicit attempt to ban a particular Taiwanese orthography in favor of Taiwanese kana " . 
 The Second Sino @-@ Japanese War beginning in 1937 brought stricter measures into force , and along with the outlawing of romanized Taiwanese , various publications were prohibited and Confucian @-@ style <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ; Pe ̍ h @-@ ōe @-@ jī : su @-@ <unk> ) – private schools which taught Classical Chinese with literary Southern Min pronunciation – were closed down in 1939 . The Japanese authorities came to perceive POJ as an obstacle to <unk> and also suspected that POJ was being used to hide " concealed codes and secret revolutionary messages " . In the climate of the ongoing war the government banned the Taiwan Church News in 1942 as it was written in POJ . 
 = = = After World War II = = = 
 Initially the Kuomintang government in Taiwan had a liberal attitude towards " local dialects " ( i.e. non @-@ Mandarin varieties of Chinese ) . The National Languages Committee produced booklets outlining versions of <unk> for writing the Taiwanese tongue , these being intended for newly arrived government officials from outside Taiwan as well as local Taiwanese . The first government action against native languages came in 1953 , when the use of Taiwanese or Japanese for instruction was forbidden . The next move to suppress the movement came in 1955 , when the use of POJ for proselytizing was outlawed . At that point in time there were 115 @,@ 000 people literate in POJ in Taiwan , Fujian , and southeast Asia . 
 Two years later , missionaries were banned from using romanized bibles , and the use of " native languages " ( i.e. Taiwanese Hakka , Hakka , and the non @-@ Sinitic Formosan languages ) in church work became illegal . The ban on POJ bibles was overturned in 1959 , but churches were " encouraged " to use character bibles instead . Government activities against POJ intensified in the late 1960s and early 1970s , when several publications were banned or seized in an effort to prevent the spread of the romanization . In 1964 use of Taiwanese in schools or official settings was forbidden , and transgression in schools punished with beatings , fines and humiliation . The Taiwan Church News ( printed in POJ ) was banned in 1969 , and only allowed to return a year later when the publishers agreed to print it in Chinese characters . 
 In 1974 , the Government Information Office banned A Dictionary of Southern Min , with a government official saying : " We have no objection to the dictionary being used by foreigners . They could use it in mimeographed form . But we don 't want it published as a book and sold publicly because of the Romanization it contains . Chinese should not be learning Chinese through Romanization . " Also in the 1970s , a POJ New Testament translation known as the " Red Cover Bible " ( <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> ) was confiscated and banned by the Nationalist regime . Official moves against native languages continued into the 1980s , the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of the Interior decided in 1984 to forbid missionaries to use " local dialects " and romanizations in their work . 
 With the ending of martial law in 1987 , the restrictions on " local languages " were quietly lifted , resulting in growing interest in Taiwanese writing during the 1990s . For the first time since the 1950s , Taiwanese language and literature was discussed and debated openly in newspapers and journals . There was also support from the then opposition party , the Democratic Progressive Party , for writing in the language . From a total of 26 documented orthographies for Taiwanese in 1987 ( including defunct systems ) , there were a further 38 invented from 1987 to 1999 , including 30 different romanizations , six adaptations of <unk> and two <unk> @-@ like systems . Some commentators believe that the Kuomintang , while steering clear of outright banning of the native language movements after the end of martial law , took a " divide and conquer " approach by promoting Taiwanese Language Phonetic Alphabet ( <unk> ) , an alternative to POJ , which was at the time the choice of the majority inside the <unk> movement . 
 Native language education has remained a fiercely debated topic in Taiwan into the 21st century and is the subject of much political wrangling . 
 = = Current system = = 
 The current system of pe ̍ h @-@ ōe @-@ jī has been stable since the 1930s , with a few minor exceptions ( detailed below ) . There is a fair degree of similarity with the Vietnamese alphabet , including the 〈 b / p / ph 〉 distinction and the use of 〈 <unk> 〉 in Vietnamese compared with 〈 o ͘ 〉 in POJ . POJ uses the following letters and combinations : 
 Chinese phonology traditionally divides syllables in Chinese into three parts ; firstly the initial , a consonant or consonant blend which appears at the beginning of the syllable , secondly the final , consisting of a medial vowel ( optional ) , a nucleus vowel , and an optional ending ; and finally the tone , which is applied to the whole syllable . In terms of the non @-@ tonal ( i.e. phonemic ) features , the nucleus vowel is the only required part of a licit consonant in Chinese varieties . Unlike Mandarin but like other southern varieties of Chinese , Taiwanese has final stop consonants with no audible release , a feature that has been preserved from Middle Chinese . There is some debate as to whether these stops are a tonal feature or a phonemic one , with some authorities distinguishing between 〈 -h 〉 as a tonal feature , and 〈 <unk> 〉 , 〈 -t 〉 , and 〈 <unk> 〉 as phonemic features . Southern Min dialects also have an optional nasal property , which is written with a superscript 〈 <unk> 〉 and usually identified as being part of the vowel . 
 A legitimate syllable in Hokkien takes the form ( initial ) + ( medial vowel ) + nucleus + ( stop ) + tone , where items in parenthesis indicate optional components . 
 The initials are : 
 Vowels : 
 Coda endings : 
 POJ has a limited amount of legitimate syllables , although sources disagree on some particular instances of these syllables . The following table contains all the licit spellings of POJ syllables , based on a number of sources : 
 = = = Tone markings = = = 
 In standard Amoy or Taiwanese Hokkien there are seven distinct tones , which by convention are numbered 1 – 8 , with number 6 omitted ( tone 6 used to be a distinct tone , but has long since merged with tone 2 ) . Tones 1 and 4 are both represented without a diacritic , and can be distinguished from each other by the syllable ending , which is a vowel , 〈 -n 〉 , 〈 -m 〉 , or 〈 -ng 〉 for tone 1 , and 〈 -h 〉 , 〈 <unk> 〉 , 〈 <unk> 〉 , and 〈 -t 〉 for tone 4 . 
 Southern Min dialects undergo considerable tone sandhi , i.e. changes to the tone depending on the position of the syllable in any given sentence or utterance . However , like pinyin for Mandarin Chinese , POJ always marks the citation tone ( i.e. the original , pre @-@ sandhi tone ) rather than the tone which is actually spoken . This means that when reading aloud the reader must adjust the tone markings on the page to account for sandhi . Some textbooks for learners of Southern Min mark both the citation tone and the sandhi tone to assist the learner . 
 There is some debate as to the correct placement of tone marks in the case of diphthongs and <unk> , particularly those which include 〈 oa 〉 and 〈 oe 〉 . Most modern writers follow six rules : 
 If the syllable has one vowel , that vowel should be tone @-@ marked ; viz . 〈 tī 〉 , 〈 <unk> 〉 , 〈 <unk> ̍ t 〉 
 If a diphthong contains 〈 i 〉 or 〈 u 〉 , the tone mark goes above the other vowel ; viz . 〈 ia ̍ h 〉 , 〈 <unk> 〉 , 〈 <unk> 〉 
 If a diphthong includes both 〈 i 〉 and 〈 u 〉 , mark the 〈 u 〉 ; viz . 〈 <unk> 〉 , 〈 <unk> 〉 
 If the final is made up of three or more letters , mark the second vowel ( except when rules 2 and 3 apply ) ; viz . 〈 <unk> 〉 , 〈 <unk> 〉 , 〈 <unk> 〉 
 If 〈 o 〉 occurs with 〈 a 〉 or 〈 e 〉 , mark the 〈 o 〉 ; viz . 〈 <unk> 〉 , 〈 <unk> 〉 
 If the syllable has no vowel , mark the nasal consonant ; viz . 〈 m ̄ 〉 , 〈 <unk> 〉 , 〈 mn ̂ g 〉 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 A single hyphen is used to indicate a compound . What constitutes a compound is controversial , with some authors equating it to a " word " in English , and others not willing to limit it to the English concept of a word . Examples from POJ include 〈 <unk> @-@ cha ̍ p 〉 " forty " , 〈 <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> 〉 " circus " , and 〈 <unk> @-@ ho ̍ k 〉 " recover ( from illness ) " . The rule @-@ based sandhi behaviour of tones in compounds has not yet been clearly defined by linguists . A double hyphen 〈 -- 〉 is used when POJ is deployed as an orthography ( rather than as a transcription system ) to indicate that the following syllable should be pronounced in the neutral tone . It also marks to the reader that the preceding syllable does not undergo tone sandhi , as it would were the following syllable non @-@ neutral . Morphemes following a double hyphen are often ( but not always ) grammatical function words . 
 = = = Audio examples = = = 
 = = = Regional differences = = = 
 In addition to the standard syllables detailed above , there are several regional variations of Hokkien speech which can be represented with non @-@ standard or semi @-@ standard spellings . In the Zhangzhou dialect , spoken in Zhangzhou and parts of Taiwan close to it , particularly the northeastern coast around Yilan City , the final 〈 ng 〉 is replaced with 〈 <unk> 〉 , for example in " egg " 〈 <unk> 〉 and " cooked rice " 〈 <unk> 〉 . 
 = = Texts = = 
 Due to POJ 's origins in the church , much of the material in the script is religious in nature , including several Bible translations , books of hymns , and guides to morality . The Tainan Church Press , established in 1884 , has been printing POJ materials ever since , with periods of quiet when POJ was suppressed in the early 1940s and from around 1955 to 1987 . In the period to 1955 , over 2 @.@ 3 million volumes of POJ books were printed , and one study in 2002 catalogued 840 different POJ texts in existence .

 POJ was initially not well supported by word @-@ processing applications due to the special diacritics needed to write it . Support has now improved and there are now sufficient resources to both enter and display POJ correctly . Several input methods exist to enter Unicode @-@ compliant POJ , including <unk> ( OS X and Microsoft Windows ) , the cross @-@ platform Tai @-@ lo Input Method released by the Taiwanese Ministry of Education , and the Firefox add @-@ on <unk> , which allows in @-@ browser POJ input . When POJ was first used in word @-@ processing applications it was not fully supported by the Unicode standard , thus necessitating work @-@ arounds . One employed was encoding the necessary characters in the " Private Use " section of Unicode , but this required both the writer and the reader to have the correct custom font installed . Another solution was to replace troublesome characters with near equivalents , for example substituting 〈 ä 〉 for 〈 ā 〉 or using a standard 〈 o 〉 followed by an <unk> to represent 〈 o ͘ 〉 . With the introduction into Unicode 4 @.@ 1 @.@ 0 of the combining character <unk> DOT ABOVE <unk> ( U + <unk> ) in 2004 , all the necessary characters were present to write regular POJ without the need for workarounds . However , even after the addition of these characters , there are still relatively few fonts which are able to properly render the script , including the combining characters . Some of those which can are Charis SIL , DejaVu , Doulos SIL , Linux Libertine , and <unk> Unicode . 
 = = Han @-@ Romanization mixed script = = 
 One of the most popular modern ways of writing Taiwanese is by using a mixed orthography called Hàn @-@ lô ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : Hàn @-@ <unk> ; literally Chinese @-@ Roman ) , and sometimes Han @-@ Romanization mixed script , a style not unlike written Japanese or ( historically ) Korean . In fact , the term Hàn @-@ lô does not describe one specific system , but covers any kind of writing in Southern Min which features both Chinese characters and romanization . That romanization is usually POJ , although recently some texts have begun appearing with Tâi @-@ lô spellings too . The problem with using only Chinese characters to write Southern Min is that there are many morphemes ( estimated to be around 15 percent of running text ) which are not definitively associated with a particular character . Various strategies have been developed to deal with the issue , including creating new characters , allocating Chinese characters used in written Mandarin with similar meanings ( but dissimilar etymology ) to represent the missing characters , or using romanization for the " missing 15 % " . There are two rationales for using mixed orthography writing , with two different aims . The first is to allow native speakers ( almost all of whom can already write Chinese characters ) to make use of their knowledge of characters , while replacing the missing 15 % with romanization . The second is to wean character <unk> off using them gradually , to be replaced eventually by fully romanized text . Examples of modern texts in Hàn @-@ lô include religious , pedagogical , scholarly , and literary works , such as : 
 Chang Yu @-@ hong . Principles of POJ .

 = = Current status = = 
 Most native Southern Min speakers in Taiwan are unfamiliar with POJ or any other writing system for the variety , commonly asserting that " Taiwanese has no writing " , or , if they are made aware of POJ , considering romanization as the " low " form of writing , in contrast with the " high " form ( Chinese characters ) . For those who are introduced to POJ alongside Han @-@ lo and completely Chinese character @-@ based systems , a clear preference has been shown for all @-@ character systems , with all @-@ romanization systems at the bottom of the preference list , likely because of the preexisting familiarity of readers with Chinese characters . 
 POJ remains the Taiwanese orthography " with the richest inventory of written work , including dictionaries , textbooks , literature [ ... ] and other publications in many areas " . A 1999 estimate put the number of literate POJ users at around 100 @,@ 000 , and secular organizations have been formed to promote the use of romanization among Taiwanese speakers . 
 Outside Taiwan , POJ is rarely used . For example , in Fujian , Xiamen University uses a romanization known as <unk> <unk> , based on Pinyin . In other areas where Hokkien is spoken , such as Singapore , the Speak Mandarin Campaign is underway to actively discourage people from speaking Hokkien or other non @-@ Mandarin varieties in favour of switching to Mandarin instead . 
 In 2006 , Taiwan 's Ministry of Education chose an official romanization for use in teaching Southern Min in the state school system . POJ was one of the candidate systems , along with <unk> <unk> <unk> , but a compromise system , the Taiwanese Romanization System or Tâi @-@ Lô , was chosen in the end . Tâi @-@ Lô retains most of the orthographic standards of POJ , including the tone marks , while changing the troublesome 〈 o ͘ 〉 character for 〈 oo 〉 , swapping 〈 ts 〉 for 〈 ch 〉 , and replacing 〈 o 〉 in diphthongs with 〈 u 〉 . Supporters of Taiwanese writing are in general deeply suspicious of government involvement , given the history of official suppression of native languages , making it unclear whether Tâi @-@ Lô or POJ will become the dominant system in the future . 
 = Homs = 
 Homs ( / <unk> / ; Arabic : <unk> / ALA @-@ LC : <unk> ) , previously known as Emesa ( Greek : <unk> Emesa ) , is a city in western Syria and the capital of the Homs Governorate . It is 501 metres ( 1 @,@ 644 ft ) above sea level and is located 162 kilometres ( 101 mi ) north of Damascus . Located on the Orontes River , Homs is also the central link between the interior cities and the Mediterranean coast . 
 Before the Syrian war , Homs was a major industrial centre , and with a population of at least 652 @,@ 609 people in 2004 , it was the third largest city in Syria after Aleppo to the north and the capital Damascus to the south . Its population reflects Syria 's general religious diversity , composed of Sunni and Alawite and Christian . There are a number of historic mosques and churches in the city , and it is close to the Krak des Chevaliers castle , a world heritage site . 
 Homs did not emerge into the historical record until the 1st century BCE at the time of the Seleucids . It later became the capital of a kingdom ruled by the Emesani dynasty who gave the city its name . Originally a center of worship for the sun god El @-@ Gabal , it later gained importance in Christianity under the Byzantines . Homs was conquered by the Muslims in the 7th century and made capital of a district that bore its current name . Throughout the Islamic era , Muslim dynasties contending for control of Syria sought after Homs due to the city 's strategic position in the area . Homs began to decline under the Ottomans and only in the 19th century did the city regain its economic importance when its cotton industry boomed . During French Mandate rule , the city became a center of insurrection and , after independence in 1946 , a center of Baathist resistance to the first Syrian governments . 
 In the ongoing Syrian civil war , Homs became an opposition stronghold and the Syrian government launched a military assault against the city in May 2011 . The fighting left much of the city completely destroyed and thousands dead . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The origin of the city 's modern name is that it is an Arabic form of the city 's Latin name " <unk> " , derived from the Greek " Emesa " or " <unk> " . The name " Emesa " seems to derive from the nomadic Arab tribe , called <unk> by the Greeks and the Romans , that inhabited the region prior to Roman influence in the area . 
 " Emesa " was shortened to " Homs " or " Hims " by its Arab inhabitants , many of whom settled there prior to the Muslim conquest of Syria . This name has been preserved throughout the period of Islamic rule continuing to the present day . It was known as " la <unk> " by the Crusaders , although they never ruled the city . 
 = = History = = 
 For approximately 2 @,@ 000 years , Homs has served as a key agricultural market , production site and trade center for the villages of northern Syria . It has also provided security services to the hinterland of Syria , protecting it from invading forces . Excavations at the Citadel of Homs indicate that the earliest settlement at the site dates back to around 2300 BCE . Biblical scholars have identified the city with <unk> mentioned in the Bible . In 1274 BCE , a battle took place between the forces of the Egyptian Empire under Ramesses II and the Hittite Empire under <unk> II at the city of Kadesh on the Orontes River near Homs . It was possibly the largest chariot battle ever fought , involving perhaps 5 @,@ 000 – 6 @,@ 000 chariots . 
 = = = Emesani dynasty and Roman rule = = = 
 Homs itself may have been founded by Seleucus I Nicator who established the Seleucid Empire upon the death of Alexander the Great , although the city did not emerge in the light of history until the 1st @-@ century BCE . At this time , Greek philosopher Strabo spoke of a tent @-@ dwelling tribe called the " Emesani " living in the area around the Orontes and south of the Apamea region . They were an Arab tribe in the area and settled in Emesa — which derived its name from them . Upon Pompey 's incorporation of the Seleucid state of Syria into the Roman Empire in 64 BCE , the Emesani dynasty were confirmed in their rule as client kings of the Romans for aiding their troops in various wars . Their chief at the time , Sampsiceramus I , gained the status as King of Emesa , but their capital was at Arethusa , a city north of Emesa , also along the Orontes River . At its greatest extent , the kingdom 's boundaries extended from the Bekaa Valley in the west to the border with Palmyra in the east , and from <unk> in the south to al @-@ Rastan ( Arethusa ) in the north . The kingdom of Sampsiceramus I , was the first of Rome 's Arab clients on the desert fringes . 
 The city of Emesa grew to prominence after the new @-@ found wealth of the Emesani dynasty , governed first by one of the sons of Sampsiceramus I , Iamblichus I who made it the kingdom 's capital . The Emesani proved their loyalty to Rome once more when they aided Gaius Julius Caesar in his siege of Alexandria in 48 BCE , by sending him army detachments . Subsequently , they became embroiled in the Roman Civil War between the rebelling Mark Antony and the pro @-@ Caesar Octavian . Iamblichus I took the side of Octavian , and so upon encouragement from Antony , Iamblichus 's brother Alexio I usurped the throne and put Iamblichus I to death in 31 BCE . Octavian 's forces prevailed in the war , however , and as a result the kingdom 's throne was reverted to Iamblichus II ( the son of Iamblichus I ) after Alexio I was executed for treason . Under the stable rule of Iamblichus II , emerged a new era of peace from 20 BCE to 14 , known as Emesa 's " Golden Age . " In 32 , Heliopolis and the Beqaa Valley came under the kingdom 's control . 
 Relations with the Roman government grew closer when King Sohaemus inherited the kingship . Under him , Emesa sent the Roman military a regular levy of archers and assisted them in their siege of Jerusalem in 70 . Sohaemus had died in 73 and was succeeded by his son , Alexio II . Despite the fact that the Emesani dynasty were loyal allies to Rome , for unknown reasons the Roman state reduced the autonomous rule of the Emesani dynasty . Alexio II and his priest king successors had only ceremonial authority . It remains unclear why this occurred to the Emesani dynasty . Alexio II died in 78 and he was succeeded by his son Sampsiceramus III . The generations after Alexio II , are not recorded sufficiently to accurately present a pedigree . The integration of client states was actively pursued under the Flavians . Perhaps as early as 72 , but certainly before 78 , <unk> of Emesa was deposed and his principality incorporated into the province . 
 Under the Romans , Emesa began to show attributes of a Greek city @-@ state and traces of Roman town planning still remain . Its transformation into a major city was completed under the reign of Emperor Antoninus Pius ( 138 – 161 ) when Emesa began to mint coins . By the 3rd @-@ century , it grew prosperous and well integrated into the Roman Orient . This was partly due to the marriage of Emperor Lucius Septimius Severus to a woman from a family of notables based in Emesa . It attained the coveted status as a Roman colonia by Severus , and two other emperors of Severan Dynasty were raised in Emesa . One of them was Elagabalus who served as the high priest at the Temple of El @-@ <unk> , the local sun god . He brought the image of this god , a conical black stone , to the Elagabalium in Rome . 
 Emesa also grew wealthy because it formed a link in the eastern trade funneled through Palmyra , however , this dependence also caused the city 's downfall when Palmyra sank to insignificance in the 4th @-@ century . Nonetheless , Emesa at this time had grown to rank with the important cities of Tyre , Sidon , Beirut , and Damascus . It also continued to retain local significance , because it was the market center for the surrounding villages . The city remained a strong center of paganism , because of the Temple of El @-@ Gabal . After one of his victories over Zenobia , Emperor Aurelian visited the city to pay thanks to the deity . 
 Due to the strength of the pagan sun cult in Emesa , Christians initially did not settle in the city . Eusebius writes that Silvanus , the city 's first bishop , had no jurisdiction over the city , but the surrounding villages . He was executed by Emperor Julian and succeeded by Bishop Antonius — the first bishop to settle Emesa . By the 5th @-@ century , Christianity was well established under the Byzantine Empire ; however , few ancient Christian inscriptions exist in Homs today . Under the Byzantines , the city became an important center for Eastern Christianity . Initially a diocese , Homs was given the status of ecclesiastical metropolis after the discovery of John the Baptist 's head in a nearby area in 452 . 
 = = = Arab Caliphate = = = 
 Prior to the Muslim conquest of Syria , Arab tribes , particularly the Banu Kalb settled around Emesa , ensuring its position as an important Yamani center . The Byzantine emperor Heraclius abandoned the city — which served as his headquarters — after the his army 's defeat by the Rashidun Muslims under Caliph Umar ibn al @-@ Khattab during the Battle of Yarmouk in southern Syria . In 637 CE , the Rashidun army led by Khalid ibn al @-@ Walid captured Emesa peacefully because its inhabitants agreed to pay a substantial ransom of 71 @,@ 000 to 170 @,@ 000 dinars . The caliph Umar established Homs as the capital of Jund Hims , a district of the province of Bilad al @-@ Sham , encompassing the towns of Latakia , Jableh , and Tartus along the coast , Palmyra in the Syrian Desert and the territory in between , including the town of Hama . Homs was likely the first city in Syria to have a substantial Muslim population . 
 The Muslims transformed half of St. John 's Church into the city 's Friday Mosque ( Great Mosque of al @-@ Nuri ) and Homs soon became a centre of Islamic piety since some 500 companions of Muhammad settled there after its conquest . The tombs of Khalid ibn al @-@ Walid , his son Abd al @-@ Rahman , and Ubaid Allah , the son of Caliph Umar are located in the city . During the conflict between the Umayyads and Ali , the inhabitants of Homs allied themselves with Ali and when the latter was defeated , the Umayyad caliph Mu 'awiyah <unk> the northern half of Jund Hims to form a separate district , Jund Qinnasrin , apparently as punishment . Ali 's oratory ( mash @-@ had ' Ali ) was located in the city , and Islamic tradition claims his fingerprints are engraved on it . Despite repression by the Umayyads , Homs remained a center of Shia Islam for a while longer . As a stronghold of the Banu Kalb , the city became involved in the latter 's conflicts with the Qais tribal faction . The last Umayyad caliph , Marwan II , enjoyed the support of the Qais and subsequently razed the city walls in response to a rebellion by the Banu Kalb . 
 In 750 the Abbasids wrested control of Syria , including Homs , from the Umayyads , and the Arab tribes revolted . Despite the prosperity Homs experienced during this era , Abbasid rule was generally not welcomed nevertheless . During and after the reign of caliph Harun al @-@ Rashid ( 796 @-@ 809 ) , the Abbasid authorities sent numerous punitive expeditions against Homs . Under the reign of al @-@ Mutawakkil , in October 855 , the Christian population revolted in response to additional taxation . The caliph put down the revolt by expelling Christians from the city , burning down their churches and executing members of their leadership . 
 With Abbasid rule over the Caliphate weakening in the mid 9th @-@ century , Homs became sought after by rebel dynasties contending for control of Syria due to the city 's strategic position . Initially , the Egypt @-@ based Tulunids came into control of it , but they were forced out by the Aleppo @-@ based Hamdanids who were briefly succeeded by the Qarmatians , after their Turkish rebel ally <unk> invaded northern Syria and established Homs as his base . In 891 Muslim geographer al @-@ Yaqubi noted that Homs was situated along a broad river which served as a source of drinking water for the inhabitants . It was one of the largest cities in Syria and had several smaller districts surrounding it . In 944 the Hamdanids took definitive control of the city , dominating it until 1016 . Arab geographer al @-@ Mas 'udi claimed in the early 10th @-@ century that Homs was " noted for the personal beauty of its inhabitants . " In 985 al @-@ Muqaddasi noted that Homs was the largest city in all of Syria , but it had suffered " great misfortunes " and was " threatened with ruin . " He stated that when the city was conquered by the Muslims they turned half of its church into a mosque . 
 For around thirty years during the 10th @-@ century , Homs was raided by the Byzantines and its inhabitants were subject to slaughter and plunder while the city 's mosque was briefly restored as a church . Throughout most of the 11th @-@ century , the Byzantine raids receded greatly and the Mirdasids of the Banu Kalb tribe ruled over Homs , replacing the Hamdanids . Inclined towards Shia Islam , they did not oppose the Shia Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt which was aiming to extend its rule into northern Syria and Iraq at the time . This precipitated a Sunni Muslim reaction led by the Seljuk Turks who occupied Homs under the leadership of <unk> Sunqur al @-@ <unk> in 1090 . 
 = = = Seljuk , Ayyubid , and Mamluk rule = = = 
 The First Crusade was launched in 1096 , and in 1098 , the Crusaders captured Antioch to the northwest , looted Ma <unk> al @-@ Numan , and finally besieged Homs itself . Although they managed to cut the city off from its main port Tartus , they failed in taking the city . Soon after , Homs came under the control of the Seljuk ruler of Damascus who transformed it into a large , fortified camp and key fortress effectively preventing the Crusaders from penetrating deeper into Muslim territory . Immune from attack , Homs became a point where the Muslims could marshal their forces and launch raids against Crusader holdings along the Mediterranean coast . In the early 12th @-@ century , the Seljuks engaged in internal fighting , during which Homs was often a prize . In 1149 the Mosul @-@ based Zengids under Nur al @-@ Din captured the city . 
 Muslim geographer Al @-@ Idrisi noted in 1154 that Homs was populous , had paved streets , possessed one of the largest mosques in Syria , contained open markets , and was frequented by travelers attracted to its " products and rarities of all kinds . " He also reported that its residents were " pleasant ; living with them is easy , and their manners are agreeable . The women are beautiful and are celebrated for their fine skin . " A series of earthquakes in 1157 inflicted heavy damage upon Homs and its fortress , then in 1170 , a minor quake finished off the latter . However , because of its strategic importance , being opposite of the Crusader County of Tripoli , the city and its fortifications were soon restored . In 1164 Nur al @-@ Din awarded Homs to Asad ad @-@ Din Shirkuh as a fief , but reclaimed it five years later following Shirkuh 's death . The latter 's nephew , Saladin , gained control of the city in 1175 and in 1179 , after reorganizing his territories in northern Syria , restored the fief to his Ayyubid dynasty . Shirkuh 's descendants retained Homs for nearly a century until 1262 with the death of al @-@ Ashraf Musa . In 1225 Arab geographer Yaqut al @-@ Hamawi mentioned that Homs was large , celebrated and walled , having a strongly fortified castle on its southern hill . 
 Towards the end of Ayyubid rule , Homs remained a centrepiece of the wars between them and the Crusaders , as well as internecine conflicts with the Mongol Empire and the Mamluks . The first battle between the Mongols and the Mamluks took place on December 10 , 1260 , ending in a decisive Mamluk victory . A second battle was fought on October 29 , 1281 , also ending in a Mamluk victory . The Mamluks were finally defeated in the Battle of Wadi al @-@ Khazandar , also known as the " Third Battle of Homs , " in 1299 . 
 Homs declined politically after falling to the Mamluks under Baibars because their campaigns effectively drove out the Crusaders and the Mongols from the entirety of Syria . At the beginning of the 14th @-@ century , the city was merely the capital of the smallest province of Syria and was often attached to the province of Damascus . Ibn Batuta visited Homs in 1355 , writing that it had fine trees , good markets , and a " fine Friday Mosque , " noting that all of its inhabitants were Arabs . Timur seized the city in 1400 , and later in the 15th @-@ century as Mamluk weakness had brought insecurity to the countryside , Homs was ravaged by Bedouin raids ; In 1510 a powerful tribe led by al @-@ Fadl bin Nu 'ayr was sent on an expedition by the governor of Damascus to loot the city markets as Homs had failed to pay compensation for his " services . " 
 = = = Ottoman rule = = = 
 In 1516 Homs was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire and consequently suffered a greater political eclipse , but it continued to thrive as an economic center , processing the agricultural and pastoral products that flowed to it from surrounding districts . Homs was particularly well known for silk and wool weaving , especially the <unk> , which was mottled muslin run through with gold threads and used in feminine apparel . This silk was exported as far as the Ottoman capital Istanbul . In addition to weaving industries , there were olive oil presses and water mills for wheat and sesame , while grapes and rice , grown in the surrounding marshlands from the 16th @-@ century , were found in abundance in the city 's markets . Moreover , the markets of Homs were the center of a trade in livestock , where flocks of sheep and goats coming from Aleppo met camels and cattle moving north from Damascus . 
 The coming of the Ottomans brought administrative changes to Homs , as it became the capital city of sanjak ( " district " ) of Homs , attached to the eyalet ( " province " ) of Tripoli — its old rival . At this time , a French visitor noted that the city walls and citadel were in good repair , but all within was in decay and only its covered markets " retained their beauty . " In 1785 French traveler , Volney wrote of the city 's once great importance and its current " miserable " condition . He described it as a large , but ruined village administratively dependent on Damascus . The Ottomans did little to revitalize Homs or ensure its security against Bedouin raids . Tribal unrest throughout the 17th and 18th centuries resulted in the sacking of its markets on several occasions . Security was even more hampered , when in the 18th @-@ century , the Ottomans tore down the gates of the city 's walls . 
 The countryside of Homs saw an increase in Bedouin raids in the first half of the 19th @-@ century , interrupted by its occupation by Muhammad Ali 's Egypt led by Ibrahim Pasha between 1832 and 1840 . The city rebelled against Egyptian rule and consequently , the citadel was destroyed when the Egyptians suppressed the revolt . Ottoman rule was soon restored and up to the 1860s , Homs was large enough to form a discrete economic unit of trade and processing of agricultural products from its satellite villages and the neighboring Bedouin tribes . 
 The local economy was stimulated when the Ottoman government extended security to the city and its surrounding areas ; new villages were established and old ones were resettled . However , Homs found itself faced with European economic competition since Ottoman rule was restored . Homs ' economic importance was boosted again during the depression of the 1870s , as its cotton industry boomed due to a decline European textile production . The quality and design of cotton goods from Homs satisfied both the lower and upper classes of the local , Ottoman , and foreign markets . There were around 5 @,@ 000 looms in Homs and nearby Hama , and one British consul referred to Homs as the " Manchester of Syria . " 
 = = = Modern era = = = 
 Throughout the 20th @-@ century Homs held high political importance in the country and was home to several heads of state and other high @-@ ranking government officials . During the French mandate , Homs was part of the State of Damascus . In Autumn 1925 , the city joined Damascus and the southern Druze chieftains in a full @-@ blown revolt against French rule . In 1932 the French moved their military academy from Damascus to Homs , and it remained the only military academy in Syria until 1967 . The French authorities had created a unit of Special Forces in which the Alawites were given privileged positions . The military academy in Homs served as a stronghold for these Special Forces . The Homs Military Academy played a major role in the years following Syria 's independence , as many of its graduates went on to become high @-@ ranking officers in the Syrian Army , many of them taking part in the series of coup d <unk> that were to follow . An important example was Hafez al @-@ Assad who became the president of Syria from 1971 until his death in 2000 . 
 An oil pipeline between Tripoli and Kirkuk was built in Homs in the early 1930s and it followed an ancient caravan route between Palmyra and the Mediterranean . In 1959 , an oil refinery was built to process some of this oil for domestic consumption . The city 's oil refinery was bombed by the Israeli Air Force ( IAF ) during the 1973 Yom Kippur War .

 Homs is one of many cities in Syria where large anti @-@ government demonstrations have been held , part of the wider Syrian civil war . It has been referred to as the " Capital of the revolution . " Thousands to tens of thousands gathered in the city 's main square on 17 – 18 April 2011 in a sit @-@ in protesting the government of current president Bashar al @-@ Assad . At least 62 people were killed by government security forces in armed clashes against local anti @-@ government militants . 
 Starting on 6 May 2011 , the city has been under siege by the Syrian Army and security forces . The Syrian government claims it is targeting " armed gangs " and " terrorists " in the area . According to the Syrian opposition , Homs has since become a " blighted city , " where authorities regularly block deliveries of medicine , food and fuel to the inhabitants of certain districts . By June , there were near @-@ daily confrontations between protesting residents and Syrian forces . As a result of these circumstances , there have been more deaths in Homs and its vicinity than in other areas of Syria . Homs was the first Syrian city where images of al @-@ Assad and his family were routinely torn down or defaced and the first place where Syrian forces used artillery during the uprising . The Center for Documenting Violations in Syria claims that at least 1 @,@ 770 people have been killed in Homs since the uprising began . 
 In February 2012 , Syrian Armed Forces carried out a major attack on Homs to regain control over the city which was turned into an operation center for the Free Syrian Army , a collection of anti @-@ government fighters and army defectors . Ten days of operations resulted in the deaths of about 700 people in the city according to the Local Coordination Committees . On 1 March 2012 , the Syrian Army had gained control over the Baba Amr district while lesser clashes continued in other neighborhoods . 
 On 9 December 2015 , under a UN @-@ negotiated deal , the remnants of anti @-@ government forces and their families , that had been under siege the al @-@ Wair district for three years , began to evacuate from the city .

 The Governorate of Homs is the largest in Syria . Homs , the governorate 's capital , is located in central western Syria , situated along the east bank of the Orontes River in a particularly fertile area . The city is in between the southern outliers of the Coastal Mountain Range located to the west and Mount Lebanon , overlooking the Homs Gap . Because of the gap , the area around Homs receives much more rainfall than interior regions to its north and south . To the east of Homs , is the Syrian Desert . Lake Homs , impounded by a huge dam of Roman origins , is to the southwest , lying some 125 kilometers ( 78 mi ) south of Aleppo and 34 kilometers ( 21 mi ) south of Hama , halfway on the road between the capital Damascus and Aleppo . The Orontes River splits the city into two main sections : To the east , on a flat land lies the city center and the main neighborhoods ; to the west , lies the more recent and modern suburb of al @-@ <unk> . The city spans an area of 4 @,@ 800 hectares ( 19 sq mi ) . 
 Homs is located 162 kilometres ( 101 mi ) north of Damascus , 193 kilometres ( 120 mi ) south of Aleppo , 47 kilometres ( 29 mi ) south of Hama , and 186 kilometres ( 116 mi ) southeast of Latakia on the Mediterranean coast .

 Romblon ( / <unk> / rom @-@ <unk> ) is an archipelagic province of the Philippines located in the <unk> region . Its main islands include Tablas , the largest , which covers nine municipalities , Sibuyan with its three towns , as well as the smaller island municipalities of Corcuera , Banton , Concepcion , San Jose , and Romblon , the provincial capital . The province lies south of Marinduque and Quezon , east of Oriental Mindoro , north of Aklan and Capiz , and west of Masbate . According to the 2015 census , it has a total population of 292 @,@ 781 . 
 Romblon has been inhabited by aboriginal Filipinos prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 1569 . Archaeological artifacts recovered by the National Museum in 1936 indicate that the aborigines of Romblon already have a rich and advanced culture . Under Spanish colonial rule , Romblon was initially administered under the newly established province of Arevalo , until 1716 , when it was transferred to the jurisdiction of the newly created province of Capiz . With arrival of the Americans in 1901 , Romblon was declared a province and placed under civilian rule . It lost its provincial status for a short while between 1907 and 1945 , but regained it in 1946 , just after World War II . 
 The inhabitants of Romblon are divided into three ethnolinguistic groups : Romblomanon , Onhan and Asi . These groups occupy specific islands in the province and have their own language and customs . Romblomanon is mainly spoken in the town of Romblon , in all of three towns of Sibuyan Island , and the towns of San Andres and San Agustin in Tablas Island . Onhan is mainly spoken in the municipalities in the southern part of Tablas Island ( Alcantara , Looc , Ferrol , Santa Fe and Santa Maria ) well as in the island municipality of San Jose . The northwestern part of Tablas Island ( in Odiongan and Calatrava , as well as the islands municipalities of Corcuera , Banton , and Concepcion , speak the Asi language . 
 Currently , the province relies on agriculture , particularly rice and copra farming as well as fishing , for its livelihood . It also has a lucrative marble industry due to an abundance of Italian @-@ quality marble , hence , its moniker as the " Marble Capital of the Philippines . " In recent years , the province has also become an ecotourism destination , with several white sand beaches , diving spots , mountains and rainforests that tourists visit annually . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 According to legend , the name " Romblon " was derived from the Romblomanon word <unk> , which pertains to a chicken in the act of sitting on its eggs on a nest . This eventually evolved to <unk> , and later on to <unk> , the name reported by Spanish chronicler Miguel de <unk> in his book Relacion de las Islas Filipinas in 1582 , before finally evolving to Romblon . 
 Meanwhile , local historians Roland Madeja and Evelyn Reyes relate the origin of the name " Romblon " to the shape of Romblon Island . Madeja claims that the name was derived from the Spanish word <unk> , another term for <unk> , meaning " screw . " According to him , the Spanish claimed to have observed the screw @-@ like shape of Romblon Island . Meanwhile , Reyes claims Romblon originated from " doubloon " , which refers to the Spanish coin used by Moro pirates in paying dowries for their brides @-@ to @-@ be .

 According to historians Emma Helen Blair and James Alexander Robertson , the Spanish arrived in Romblon in 1569 led by conquistador Martin de <unk> who was dispatched by Miguel López de Legazpi to explore the western and northern portion of the Visayas region including Romblon and Mindoro . The islands were later organized into three encomiendas and were administered from Arevalo . De <unk> visited Romblon in 1582 and conducted the first census of the islands . 
 In 1635 , Recollect missionaries arrived in Romblon to establish Catholic missions and settlements . They helped the Spanish authorities establish peace and order in the islands . In 1637 , they established seven missionary centers at Romblon , Badajoz ( San Agustin ) , Cajidiocan , Banton , Looc , Odiongan and Magallanes ( Magdiwang ) . They also built massive forts , churches and watchtowers in the province , such as Fort San Jose in Banton and Fort San Andres in Romblon , following a Dutch attack in 1646 which destroyed the capital town and to repulse recurring Moro raids . 
 Romblon was separated from the jurisdiction of Arevalo and annexed to Capiz , when the province was created in 1716 . More than a century later in 1850 , the inhabitants of the province began using Spanish family names after governor @-@ general Narciso <unk> decreed on 21 November 1849 the use of surnames from the <unk> <unk> de <unk> . Asi @-@ speaking natives were assigned the letter F , Romblomanon speakers were assigned the letter M , speakers of the <unk> style of Romblomanon were assigned the letter R , while Onhan @-@ speaking natives were assigned the letter G. 
 In 1853 , the islands were organized into a politico @-@ military <unk> ( " sub @-@ province " in English ) administered from Capiz and continued to be so until the end of the Spanish rule in 1898 .

 = = = Language = = = 
 The languages of Romblon , as well as all languages native to the Philippines , belong to the Austronesian language family , the second largest language family in the world with 1 @,@ 257 known languages , second only to the Niger @-@ Congo family 's 1 @,@ 538 languages . All of the languages of the Philippines , except <unk> , are classified as Philippine languages under the Western Malayo @-@ Polynesian branch of Austronesian . The Philippine language group has three main branches : Northern , Southern and Central , the latter of which is composed of the Visayan , Bikol and Tagalog languages . 
 Unlike other islands or provinces in the Philippines where all local languages are classifiable under the same subgroup of languages , each of the three languages of Romblon — Romblomanon , Onhan and Asi — actually belongs to a different subgroup of the Visayan language group . Romblomanon belongs to the Central Visayan subgroup , which spans from Waray @-@ Waray in Samar and Leyte , through <unk> and <unk> , and as far west as Hiligaynon and <unk> on Panay . It is spoken in Romblon and Sibuyan Islands , as well as in San Agustin town in Tablas Island . 
 Onhan , on the other hand , belongs to the Western Visayan subgroup , which includes <unk> @-@ a and Aklanon as well as several minor languages spoken on Mindoro , Palawan , and some small islands in between . Its speakers are mainly from the southern portion of Tablas Island , in the municipalities of San Andres , Santa Maria , Alcantara , Ferrol , Looc , and Santa Fe , as well as in the municipality of San Jose in Carabao Island . Finally , Asi is not classified under any specific subgroup of Visayan , and instead makes up its own immediate branch of Visayan . David Paul <unk> , a linguist from the Australian National University whose expertise is on Philippine languages , notes that Asi speakers may have been the first Visayan speakers in the region . He also suggests that Asi may have a Cebuano substratum and that many of its words may have been influenced by the later influx of other languages such as Romblomanon . It is spoken in the island municipalities of Banton , Corcuera and Concepcion , as well as in Odiongan and Calatrava in Tablas .

 Agriculture is the main industry in Romblon . Coconut is the most cultivated crop with a total planted area of 58 @,@ 270 @.@ 44 hectares ( 224 @.@ <unk> sq mi ) . San Agustin has the most extensive area with coconut plants followed by Romblon and Cajidiocan . Rice is the next crop , cultivated particularly in Odiongan , Looc , Cajidiocan and Santa Fe . Other crops grown include root crops , vegetables and fruits . Odiongan , Banton and Magdiwang have the greatest areas planted with root crops and correspondingly , have the highest volume of production . Vegetable production is mostly for home consumption and grown in small scale . 
 Livestock development and poultry production is a viable small scale enterprise for farmers in the province . The provincial government maintains breeding facilities in strategic locations province @-@ wide to encourage farmers to engage in livestock and poultry production to augment their income . Livestock and poultry management training and seminars is provided to interested clients . 
 Due to the geographical condition of the province , crops and livestock production is generally deficient as compared to the food requirements of Romblon population . To meet the rice requirements , Romblon relies on imports from the neighboring provinces while vegetables , poultry meat , vegetables and fruits are supplied mostly by Luzon . 
 = = = Marine resources = = = 
 Fishing industry is a major enterprise as Romblon is surrounded by water on all sides . The fishing grounds of Romblon are a migratory path of fish from Sulu and Visayan Seas passing Tablas Strait , Sibuyan Sea and Romblon Pass . The waters also abound with demersal fish due to the coral reefs surrounding the islands . 
 Because the province has a great potential for aqua @-@ marine development , the province implemented a coastal and resource management program . Each municipality established a fish sanctuary and passed laws on fishery . The use of air compressors in the municipal waters was regulated and banned altogether in some municipalities . 
 = = = Mineral resources = = = 
 Marble is the most significant mineral deposit of Romblon and is the most renowned product of the province . Based on statistics , Romblon is the second biggest provincial marble producer of the country next to Bulacan . Romblon marble is of very high quality and comes in shades of white , green , pink , red and black . The Mines and Geosciences Bureau has estimated that Romblon is endowed with about 150 million metric tons of marble . At current rates of extraction , the supply may last for three more centuries . Tablas Island is also believed to have vast reserves of marble . 
 Marble quarrying and processing are major activities in Romblon . Among the most common marble products are categorized into the following : novelty items ( gifts , ashtray , table bars ) , furniture ( dining tables , baptismal fonts ) and construction materials ( tiles , balusters , marble chips ) . Other mineral resources with considerable quantity include nickel ore and gold mostly to be found in Sibuyan Island . Gold panning and small @-@ scale mining is a lucrative undertaking in Magdiwang .

As of April 2016 , the incumbent governor of Romblon is Eduardo C. <unk> , from the Liberal Party . He first assumed office on 30 June 2010 , following his victory in the May 2010 gubernatorial elections . He was reelected in 2013 for a second term which will expire in 2016 . 
 The provincial vice governor performs duties as acting governor in the absence of the provincial governor . He or she also automatically succeeds as governor upon the death of the provincial governor . The provincial vice governor also convenes the Provincial Board or Sangguniang <unk> , the provincial legislative body .

 = Thelephora palmata = 
 Thelephora palmata ( commonly known as the stinking <unk> or the fetid false coral ) is a species of clavarioid fungus in the family Thelephoraceae . The fruit bodies are leathery and coral @-@ like , with branches that are narrow at the base before widening out like a fan and splitting into numerous flattened prongs . The wedge @-@ like tips are whitish when young , but darken as the fungus matures . The common names of the fungus refers to its pungent odor , likened to fetid garlic . A widely distributed but uncommon species , it is found in Asia , Australia , Europe , North America , and South America , where it fruits on the ground in both coniferous and mixed forest . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was first described in 1772 by Italian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli , as Clavaria palmata . Elias Fries transferred it to the genus Thelephora in 1821 . The species has several synonyms , resulting from several generic transfers in its taxonomic history , including Ramaria by Johan Theodor Holmskjold in 1790 , <unk> by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1822 , and <unk> by Narcisse Théophile Patouillard in 1887 . Other historical synonyms are <unk> <unk> , published by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1797 , and Pier Andrea Saccardo 's 1888 Clavaria <unk> . Persoon also published a species with the name Thelephora palmata in 1822 , but because the name was already in use , it is an illegitimate homonym ; this species is now known as Thelephora <unk> . 
 Despite its coral @-@ like appearance , Thelephora palmata is closely related to some fungi with a distinctly bracket @-@ like appearance , such as T. terrestris and T. <unk> . The specific epithet palmata is derived from Latin , and means " having the shape of a hand " . It is known by the common names " stinking <unk> " and " fetid false coral " . Samuel Frederick Gray called it the " stinking branch @-@ ear " in his 1821 work A Natural Arrangement of British Plants . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit body of T. palmata is a coral @-@ like tuft that is repeatedly branched from a central stalk , reaching dimensions of 3 @.@ 5 – 6 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 4 – 2 @.@ 6 in ) tall . The branches of the fruit body end in spoon- to fan @-@ shaped tips that are frequently fringed or grooved . The branches of the fruit body are initially whitish in color , but gradually turn gray to lilac @-@ brown in maturity ; the tips , however , remain whitish , or paler than the lower parts . The flesh is tough and leathery . The hymenium ( fertile , spore @-@ bearing tissue ) is <unk> , that is , it occurs on all surfaces of the fruit body . 
 The odor of the fruit body is quite unpleasant , resembling fetid garlic , " old cabbage water " , or " overripe cheese " . It has been called " a candidate for <unk> fungus in the forest " . The unpleasant odor intensifies after drying . Fruit bodies are not edible . 
 In deposit , the spores are purple @-@ brown to brown . Viewed with a microscopic , the spores appear purple , angular with lobes , and warted , with fine spines measuring 0 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 5 µm long ; the overall dimensions of the elliptic spores are 8 – 12 by 7 – 9 µm . They contain one or two oil drops . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) measure 70 – 100 by 9 – 12 µm , and have sterigmata that are 2 – 4 µm thick by 7 – 12 µm long . The flesh stains deep blue when a drop of potassium hydroxide solution is applied . The fungus contains the pigment thelephoric acid . 
 Thelephora <unk> is somewhat similar in appearance , but can be distinguished by branches that taper upward , branch tips that are flattened ( instead of spoon @-@ like ) , and the lack of a fetid odor . The North American species T. <unk> has smaller spores and a more variable color . Darker Ramaria species are distinguished by their non @-@ leathery flesh texture and pointy branch tips . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Thelephora palmata is an ectomycorrhizal species , forming mutualistic associations with conifers . Fruit bodies grow singly , scattered , or in groups on the ground in both coniferous and mixed forest and grassy fields . A preference has been noted for moist ground , and locations along woodland paths . An uncommon species , fruit bodies can be difficult to see because they blend well into their surroundings . 
 The species is found in Asia ( including China , Iran , Japan , Siberia Turkey , and Vietnam ) , Europe , North America , and South America ( Brazil and Colombia ) . It has also been recorded from Australia and Fiji . Fruit bodies are consumed by the springtail species <unk> <unk> . 
 = = Uses = = 
 Fruit bodies of Thelephora palmata can be used for mushroom dyeing . Depending on the mordant used , colors ranging from blackish @-@ brown to dark grayish @-@ green to greenish @-@ brown can be obtained from the dyeing process ; without a mordant , a light brown color is produced . 
 = Lutetium = 
 Lutetium is a chemical element with symbol Lu and atomic number 71 . It is a silvery white metal , which resists corrosion in dry , but not in moist air . It is considered the first element of the 6th @-@ period transition metals and the last element in the lanthanide series , and is traditionally counted among the rare earths . 
 Lutetium was independently discovered in 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain , Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach , and American chemist Charles James . All of these men found lutetium as an impurity in the mineral ytterbia , which was previously thought to consist entirely of ytterbium . The dispute on the priority of the discovery occurred shortly after , with Urbain and Welsbach accusing each other of publishing results influenced by the published research of the other ; the naming honor went to Urbain , as he had published his results earlier . He chose the name lutecium for the new element , but in 1949 the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium . In 1909 , the priority was finally granted to Urbain and his names were adopted as official ones ; however , the name cassiopeium ( or later <unk> ) for element 71 proposed by Welsbach was used by many German scientists until the 1950s . 
 Lutetium is not a particularly abundant element , though significantly more common than silver in the earth 's crust ; it has few specific uses . Lutetium @-@ 176 is a relatively abundant ( 2 @.@ 5 % ) radioactive isotope with a half @-@ life of about 38 billion years , and so used to determine the age of meteorites . Lutetium usually occurs in association with the element yttrium and is sometimes used in metal alloys and as a catalyst in various chemical reactions . <unk> @-@ DOTA @-@ <unk> is used for radionuclide therapy ( see Nuclear medicine ) on neuroendocrine tumours . Lutetium has the highest <unk> hardness of any lanthanide , at 890 – 1300 MPa . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 = = = Physical properties = = = 
 A lutetium atom has 71 electrons , arranged in the configuration [ Xe ] 4f145d16s2 . When entering a chemical reaction , the atom loses its two outermost electrons and the single 5d @-@ electron ; this is unusual since reactions of the other lanthanides invariably involve f @-@ shell electrons . The lutetium atom is the smallest among the lanthanide atoms , due to the lanthanide contraction , and as a result lutetium has the highest density , melting point , and hardness of the lanthanides . Some of these properties can be explained by its position in the d @-@ block , which gives the metal properties of some heavier transition metals . Occasionally , lutetium is classified as a transition metal on this basis , although the IUPAC classifies it as a lanthanide . 
 = = = Chemical properties and compounds = = = 
 Lutetium 's compounds always contain the element in the oxidation state + 3 . Aqueous solutions of most lutetium salts are colorless and form white crystalline solids upon drying , with the common exception of the iodide . The soluble salts , such as nitrate , sulfate and acetate form hydrates upon crystallization . The oxide , hydroxide , fluoride , carbonate , phosphate and oxalate are insoluble in water . 
 Lutetium metal is slightly unstable in air at standard conditions , but it burns readily at 150 ° C to form lutetium oxide . The resulting compound is known to absorb water and carbon dioxide , and may be used to remove vapors of these compounds from closed atmospheres . Similar observations are made during reaction between lutetium and water ( slow when cold and fast when hot ) ; lutetium hydroxide is formed in the reaction . Lutetium metal is known to react with the four lightest halogens to form trihalides ; all of them ( except the fluoride ) are soluble in water . 
 Lutetium dissolves readily in weak acids and dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions containing the colorless lutetium ions , which are coordinated by between seven and nine water molecules , the average being [ Lu ( H2O ) 8 @.@ 2 ] 3 + .

 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 Lutetium occurs on the Earth in form of two isotopes : lutetium @-@ 175 and lutetium @-@ 176 . Out of these two , only the former is stable , making the element monoisotopic . The latter one , lutetium @-@ 176 , decays via beta decay with a half @-@ life of 3 @.@ 78 × 1010 years ; it makes up about 2 @.@ 5 % of natural lutetium . To date , 32 synthetic radioisotopes of the element have been characterized , ranging in mass from 149 @.@ 973 ( lutetium @-@ 150 ) to 183 @.@ 961 ( lutetium @-@ 184 ) ; the most stable such isotopes are lutetium @-@ 174 with a half @-@ life of 3 @.@ 31 years , and lutetium @-@ 173 with a half @-@ life of 1 @.@ 37 years . All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half @-@ lives that are less than 9 days , and the majority of these have half @-@ lives that are less than half an hour . Isotopes lighter than the stable lutetium @-@ 175 decay via electron capture ( to produce isotopes of ytterbium ) , with some alpha and positron emission ; the heavier isotopes decay primarily via beta decay , producing hafnium isotopes . 
 The element also has 42 nuclear isomers , with masses of 150 , 151 , 153 – 162 , 166 – 180 ( not every mass number corresponds to only one isomer ) . The most stable of them are lutetium @-@ <unk> , with half @-@ life of 160 @.@ 4 days and lutetium @-@ <unk> , with half @-@ life of 142 days ; this is longer than half @-@ lives of the ground states of all radioactive lutetium isotopes , except only for lutetium @-@ 173 , 174 , and 176 . 
 = = History = = 
 Lutetium , derived from the Latin Lutetia ( Paris ) , was independently discovered in 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain , Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach , and American chemist Charles James . They found it as an impurity in ytterbia , which was thought by Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac to consist entirely of ytterbium . The scientists proposed different names for the elements : Urbain chose neoytterbium and lutecium , whereas Welsbach chose aldebaranium and cassiopeium ( after Aldebaran and Cassiopeia ) . Both of these articles accused the other man of publishing results based on those of the author . 
 The International Commission on Atomic Weights , which was then responsible for the attribution of new element names , settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones , based on the fact that the separation of lutetium from Marignac 's ytterbium was first described by Urbain ; after Urbain 's names were recognized , neoytterbium was reverted to ytterbium . Until the 1950s , some German @-@ speaking chemists called lutetium by Welsbach 's name , cassiopeium ; in 1949 , the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium . However , Welsbach 's 1907 samples of lutetium had been pure , while Urbain 's 1907 samples only contained traces of lutetium . This later misled Urbain into thinking that he had discovered element 72 , which he named celtium , which was actually very pure lutetium . Charles James , who stayed out of the priority argument , worked on a much larger scale and possessed the largest supply of lutetium at the time . Pure lutetium metal was first produced in 1953 .

The principal commercially viable ore of lutetium is the rare earth phosphate mineral monazite : ( Ce , La , etc . ) PO4 which contains 0 @.@ 0001 % of the element . The abundance of lutetium in the Earth crust is only about 0 @.@ 5 mg / kg . The main mining areas are China , United States , Brazil , India , Sri Lanka and Australia . The world production of lutetium ( in the form of oxide ) is about 10 tonnes per year . Pure lutetium metal is very difficult to prepare . It is one of the rarest and most expensive of the rare earth metals with the price about US $ 10 @,@ 000 per kilogram , or about one @-@ fourth that of gold . 
 Crushed minerals are treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water @-@ soluble sulfates of rare earths . Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed . After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates . The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing . The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes one of the main components , cerium , whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3 . Several rare earth metals , including lutetium , are separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization . Lutetium is separated by ion exchange . In this process , rare @-@ earth ions are <unk> onto suitable ion @-@ exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen , ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin . Lutetium salts are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent . Lutetium metal is then obtained by reduction of anhydrous <unk> or <unk> by either an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal . 
 2 <unk> + 3 Ca → 2 Lu + 3 CaCl2 
 = = Applications = = 
 Because of the rarity and high price , lutetium has very few commercial uses . However , stable lutetium can be used as catalysts in petroleum cracking in refineries and can also be used in alkylation , hydrogenation , and polymerization applications . 
 Lutetium aluminium garnet ( <unk> ) has been proposed for use as a lens material in high refractive index immersion lithography . Additionally , a tiny amount of lutetium is added as a dopant to gadolinium gallium garnet ( GGG ) , which is used in magnetic bubble memory devices . Cerium @-@ doped lutetium <unk> ( LSO ) is currently the preferred compound for detectors in positron emission tomography ( PET ) . Lutetium is used as a phosphor in LED light bulbs . 
 Aside from stable lutetium , its radioactive isotopes have several specific uses . The suitable half @-@ life and decay mode made lutetium @-@ 176 used as a pure beta emitter , using lutetium which has been exposed to neutron activation , and in lutetium – hafnium dating to date meteorites . The synthetic isotope lutetium @-@ 177 bound to <unk> ( a somatostatin analogue ) , is used experimentally in targeted radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumors . Indeed , lutetium @-@ 177 is seeing increasing use as a radionuclide , in <unk> tumor therapy and bone pain palliation . 
 Lutetium tantalate ( <unk> ) is the densest known stable white material ( density 9 @.@ 81 g / cm3 ) and therefore is an ideal host for X @-@ ray phosphors . The only denser white material is thorium dioxide , with density of 10 g / cm3 , but the thorium it contains is radioactive . 
 = = Precautions = = 
 Like other rare @-@ earth metals , lutetium is regarded as having a low degree of toxicity , but its compounds should be handled with care nonetheless : for example , lutetium fluoride inhalation is dangerous and the compound irritates skin . Lutetium nitrate may be dangerous as it may explode and burn once heated . Lutetium oxide powder is toxic as well if inhaled or ingested . 
 Similarly to other group 3 elements and lanthanides , lutetium has no known biological role , but it is found even in humans , concentrating in bones , and to a lesser extent in the liver and kidneys . Lutetium salts are known to occur together with other lanthanide salts in nature ; the element is the least abundant in the human body of all lanthanides . Human diets have not been monitored for lutetium content , so it is not known how much the average human takes in , but estimations show the amount is only about several micrograms per year , all coming from tiny amounts taken by plants . Soluble lutetium salts are mildly toxic , but insoluble ones are not . 
 = Tropical Storm Rachel ( 1990 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Rachel was the only tropical cyclone to make landfall during the 1990 Pacific hurricane season . The twenty @-@ fourth tropical depression and eighteenth named storm , Rachel developed on September 27 from a tropical wave southwest of mainland Mexico . After becoming a tropical depression , the system tracked slowly southwestward and eventually curved northwestward . The depression intensified into a tropical storm after three days and was named Rachel by the National Hurricane Center . Rachel continued to steadily strengthen , and peaked as a strong 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) tropical storm on October 2 . After attaining peak intensity , Rachel re @-@ curved to make a landfall in southern Baja California Sur and again in the Mexican Mainland on October 3 . The storm produced heavy rainfall across northern Mexico and the Southwestern United States . Thousands of people were left homeless and 18 fatalities were reported . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Rachel can be traced back to a tropical wave that moved off the west coast Africa in mid @-@ September 1990 . It moved westward into the Caribbean Sea without significant development . Poorly organized , the wave entered the Eastern Pacific on overnight September 22 . The thunderstorm activity became more concentrated two days later . Dvorak classifications , a technique used to estimate a tropical cyclone 's intensity , began late September 25 . 
 Early on September 27 , the twenty @-@ fourth tropical depression of the season had developed ; however , operationally it was not warned upon until the system was located 540 mi ( 870 km ) south of Baja California Sur on September 30 . Post @-@ analysis later confirm that Rachel was already a minimal tropical storm by that time . Although convection initially remained displaced from the center , Rachel steadily intensified . Early on September 30 , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) operationally upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Rachel . While intensifying , an upper @-@ level trough over California allowed Rachel to re @-@ curve towards Mexico . On October 2 , it reached its peak intensity of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) and a minimum pressure of 994 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 35 inHg ) . 
 After maintaining its intensity for 24 hours , Rachel made landfall at peak intensity near the southern tip of Baja California Sur . Strong wind shear prevented additional intensification , despite moving into the warm waters of the Gulf of California . After weakening slightly , Rachel made a second landfall midway between Las Mochis and Culiacán . Upon moving inland , the system rapidly weakened as the forward speed increased . Rachel dissipated several hours later on October 3 . By that time , the winds had decreased to 30 mph ( 45 km / h ) . The remnants of Rachel entered the United States , and were last noted over Texas . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Prior to the arrival of Rachel , the Mexican government issued a tropical storm watch for southern Baja California Sur , encompassing areas south of La Paz on October 1 . As Rachel moved closer to the area , the watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning . In the mainland , a tropical storm watch was issued for the state of Sinaloa south of Los <unk> . Six hours later , the watches was replaced with a tropical storm warning . By the end of October 2 , all the watches and warnings were discontinued . 
 The two highest rainfall totals were 9 @.@ 85 in ( 250 mm ) and 6 @.@ 5 in ( 170 mm ) at Santa Anita and San Jose Del <unk> , near the southern tip of Baja California Sur . Two weather stations in Mexico reported barometric pressure of 1005 and 1006 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 68 and 29 @.@ 71 inHg ) during the passage of Rachel . In all , precipitation was measured at 996 different places across the country . Throughout northern Mexico , significant flooding was reported with the worst effects felt in the states of Nuevo Leon , Coahuila and Durango . Thousands were homeless , and 18 people died . In Monterrey , rescue workers freed dozens of trapped people . 
 The moisture associated with the Rachel and a cold front produced rainfall in Arizona , New Mexico , and western Texas , while it was located southwest of Baja California Sur . After Rachel had dropped heavy rains , a flash flood watch was issued for several counties in New Mexico on October 1 , where rainfall had reportedly been 2 in ( 51 mm ) since the last day of September . The remnants of the storm produced additional precipitation across the state . Heavy rains fell on almost all of western Texas , and a flash flood warning had been issued after some areas experienced rainfall over 1 in ( 25 mm ) . With heavy rains falling in the western portion of Texas , some roads were washed out , especially in Big Bend National Park and Lubbock ; several car accidents were also reported on the roads . Several locations in Texas measured at least 0 @.@ 5 in ( 13 mm ) of rain , and the highest amount of rainfall was 1 @.@ 5 in ( 38 mm ) in Lubbock . 
 = Batman Returns = 
 Batman Returns is a 1992 American superhero film , directed and produced by Tim Burton , based on the DC Comics character Batman . It is the second installment of Warner Bros. ' initial Batman film series , with Michael Keaton reprising the title role of Bruce Wayne / Batman . The film introduces the characters of Max Shreck ( Christopher Walken ) , a business tycoon who teams up with the Penguin ( Danny DeVito ) to take over Gotham City , as well as the character of Catwoman ( Michelle Pfeiffer ) . 
 Burton originally did not want to direct another Batman film because of his mixed emotions toward the previous film in 1989 . Warner Bros. developed a script with writer Sam Hamm which had the Penguin and Catwoman going after hidden treasure . Burton agreed to return after they granted him more creative control and replaced Hamm with Daniel Waters . Wesley Strick did an uncredited rewrite , removing the characters of Harvey Dent and Robin and rewriting the climax . Annette Bening was originally cast as Catwoman but became pregnant and was replaced with Pfeiffer . Filming for Batman Returns started in June 1991 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank , California . 
 Batman Returns was released on June 19 , 1992 . The film was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Makeup , as well as two BAFTA awards . Batman Returns 's budget was an estimated $ 65 million , grossing $ 266 @,@ 822 @,@ 354 worldwide , making the film a financial success . Warner Bros. , however , was disappointed as it was still substantially less than the first film . Burton was asked to restrict himself to the role of producer for the third film , Batman Forever , which led to Keaton vacating the role of Batman .

 Tucker and Esther Cobblepot throw their deformed infant child into Gotham River , fearing he would become a menace to society after attacking their pet cat . The child 's crib floats to an abandoned zoo and is found by a flock of penguins who raise him as one of their own . 33 years later , during the lighting of Gotham City 's Christmas tree , a villainous gang of carnival performers stage a riot . While Batman subdues the criminals , corrupt businessman Max Shreck is abducted and brought to the underground lair of the grotesque crime boss known as The Penguin . A former sideshow freak , The Penguin explains his desire to become a respected citizen of Gotham and blackmails Shreck into helping him . 
 Meanwhile , Shreck 's mousy secretary , Selina Kyle , inadvertently discovers her boss 's plan to illegally monopolize Gotham 's supply of electricity . To protect his secrets , Shreck pushes her out of his office window . Falling through several canopies , Selina miraculously survives but lies unconscious in an alley . A group of cats swarm around her , and while attempting to eat her , they revive her . Traumatized , Selina develops dissociative identity disorder and , after trashing her apartment , she fashions a black vinyl costume and whip , becoming the formidable Catwoman . 
 Shreck arranges for one of Penguin 's men to kidnap the Mayor 's infant son , allowing the Penguin to " rescue " him . As a reward , the Penguin is given access to the Gotham City Archives , where he learns his real name , Oswald Cobblepot , and that he is the last surviving member of his family . Meanwhile , the Mayor , persuaded by billionaire Bruce Wayne , refuses to give Shreck a construction permit for his power plant . The Penguin orders his gang to attack downtown Gotham , ruining the Mayor 's reputation and giving Shreck the opportunity to propose Penguin as a replacement . Batman confronts the Penguin , but Catwoman appears while firebombing Shreck 's department store , and Penguin escapes . After a fight in which Batman knocks her off a building , Catwoman survives by landing in a sand truck . 
 Catwoman agrees to help Penguin with a plan to discredit Batman by framing him for the abduction of Gotham 's " Ice Princess " beauty queen . Distracted by Catwoman , Batman is unable to stop Penguin from murdering the Princess using a swarm of captive bats . When Catwoman rejects the Penguin 's amorous advances , he tries to kill her using his motorized helicopter umbrella . As the umbrella takes her up into the sky , Catwoman narrowly cheats death again as she falls into a rooftop greenhouse . Fleeing from the police , Batman realizes that the Penguin is remotely controlling the Batmobile , taking it on a rampage through Gotham . Batman disables the control device , but not before recording the Penguin 's mocking insults about how gullible the people of Gotham are . 
 At a press conference for Penguin organized by Shreck , Batman broadcasts the recording , destroying the Penguin 's public image . Enraged , the Penguin flees to the sewers and orders his gang to kidnap all of the first born sons of Gotham 's citizens . At a masquerade ball hosted by Shreck , Bruce and Selina deduce each other 's secret identities . The Penguin invades the party and reveals his intention to drown the kidnapped children , including Shreck 's son Chip , prompting Shreck to offer himself instead . Batman defeats the kidnappers , forcing Penguin to unleash an army of penguin soldiers to destroy Gotham with missiles . Piloting the <unk> through the sewers , Batman redirects the penguins to instead fire on Penguin 's hideout . The Penguin attacks Batman in a rage , but ends up falling through the ceiling of his lair . 
 Catwoman ambushes Shreck to kill him , but Batman stops her and unmasks himself . Before Bruce can reason with her , Shreck shoots him and Selina , but runs out of bullets . Putting a taser to her lips , she kisses Shreck while grabbing hold of an exposed power cable , causing a fiery explosion . Bruce digs though the rubble but finds only Shreck 's charred corpse . Mortally injured , the Penguin tries to take his umbrella to kill Batman , but collapses dead before he can finish . His penguin family carries out a makeshift funeral , pushing his body into the water . 
 Afterwards , as Alfred drives Bruce home , Bruce spots a shadow outside . He finds a stray black cat and decides to take it home . As he leaves , the Bat @-@ Signal lights up in the night sky as Catwoman watches from afar .

 After the success of Batman , Warner Bros. was hoping for a sequel to start filming in May 1990 at Pinewood Studios . They spent $ 250 @,@ 000 storing the sets from the first film . Tim Burton had mixed emotions about directing another film in the franchise after his experiences with the previous film . " I will return if the sequel offers something new and exciting " , he said in 1989 . " Otherwise it 's a most @-@ dumbfounded idea . " Burton decided to direct Edward Scissorhands for 20th Century Fox . Meanwhile , Sam Hamm from the previous film delivered the first two drafts of the script , while Bob Kane was brought back as a creative consultant . Hamm 's script had Penguin and Catwoman going after hidden treasure . 
 Burton was impressed with Daniel Waters ' work on Heathers ; Burton originally brought Waters aboard on a sequel to Beetlejuice . Warner Bros. then granted Burton a large amount of creative control , demoting producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber to executive producers . Dissatisfied with the Hamm script , Burton commissioned a rewrite from Waters . Waters " came up with a social satire that had an evil mogul backing a bid for the Mayor 's office by the Penguin " , Waters reported . " I wanted to show that the true villains of our world don 't necessarily wear costumes . " The subplot of Penguin running for Mayor came from the 1960s TV series episodes " <unk> the Penguin " and " <unk> the Penguin " . Waters wrote a total of five drafts . 
 On the characterization of Catwoman , Waters explained " Sam Hamm went back to the way comic books in general treat women , like <unk> sexual fantasy . I wanted to start off just at the lowest point in society , a very beaten down secretary . " Harvey Dent appeared in early drafts of the script , but was deleted . His disfiguring appearance of Two @-@ Face would have appeared in the climax when Catwoman kisses him with a taser to the face , which was replaced with Max Shreck . Waters quoted , " Sam Hamm definitely planned that . I flirted with it , having Harvey start to come back and have one scene of him where he flips a coin and it 's the good side of the coin , deciding not to do anything , so you had to wait for the next movie . " In early scripts Max Shreck was the " golden boy " of the Cobblepot family , whereas Penguin was the deformed outsider . It turned out that Shreck would be the Penguin 's long @-@ lost brother . Max Shreck was also a reference to actor Max Schreck , known for his role as Count Orlok in Nosferatu . 
 = = = Pre @-@ production = = = 
 Burton hired Wesley Strick to do an uncredited rewrite . Strick recalled , " When I was hired to write Batman Returns ( Batman II at the time ) , the big problem of the script was Penguin 's lack of a ' master plan ' . " Warner Bros. presented Strick with warming , or freezing Gotham City , a plot point they would later use in Batman & Robin . Strick gained inspiration from a Moses parallel that had Penguin killing the firstborn sons of Gotham . A similar notion was used when the Penguin 's parents threw him into a river as a baby . Robin appeared in the script , but was deleted because Waters felt the film had too many characters . Waters called Robin " the most worthless character in the world , especially with [ Batman as ] the loner of loners . " Robin started out as a juvenile gang leader , who becomes an ally to Batman . Robin was later changed to a black teenage garage mechanic . Waters explained , " He 's wearing this old @-@ fashioned garage mechanic uniform and it has an ' R ' on it . He drives the Batmobile , which I notice they used in the third film ! " Marlon Wayans was cast , and signed for a sequel . The actor had attended a wardrobe fitting , but it was decided to save the character for a third installment . 
 Michael Keaton returned after a significant increase in his salary to $ 10 million . Annette Bening was cast as Catwoman after Burton saw her performance in The Grifters , but she dropped out due to pregnancy . Raquel Welch , Jennifer Jason Leigh , Madonna , Ellen Barkin , Cher , Bridget Fonda , Lorraine Bracco , Jennifer Beals and Susan Sarandon were then in competition for the role . Sean Young , who was originally chosen for Vicki Vale in the previous film , believed the role should have gone to her . Young visited production offices dressed in a homemade Catwoman costume , demanding an audition . Burton was unfamiliar with Michelle Pfeiffer 's work , but was convinced to cast her after one meeting . Pfeiffer received a $ 3 million salary , $ 2 million more than Bening , and a percentage of the box office . The actress undertook kickboxing lessons for the role . Kathy Long served as Pfeiffer 's body double . On Danny DeVito 's casting , Waters explained , " I kind of knew that DeVito was going to play The Penguin . We didn 't really officially cast it , but for a short nasty little guy , it 's a short list . I ended up writing the character for Danny DeVito . "

 In early 1991 , two of Hollywood 's largest sound stages ( Stage 16 at Warner Bros. and Stage 12 at Universal Studios ) were being prepared for the filming of Batman Returns . Filming started in June 1991 . Stage 16 held Gotham Plaza , based on Rockefeller Center . Universal 's Stage 12 housed Penguin 's underground lair . A half @-@ a @-@ million gallon tank filled with water was used . Burton wanted to make sure that the penguins felt comfortable . Eight other locations on the Warner Bros. lot were used , over 50 % of their property was occupied by Gotham City sets . 
 Animal rights groups started protesting the film after finding out that penguins would have rockets strapped on their backs . Richard Hill , the curator of the penguins , explained that Warner Bros. was very helpful in making sure the penguins were comfortable . " On the flight over the plane was refrigerated down to 45 degrees " , recalls Hill . " In Hollywood , they were given a refrigerated trailer , their own swimming pool , half @-@ a @-@ ton of ice each day , and they had fresh fish delivered daily straight from the docks . Even though it was 100 degrees outside , the entire set was refrigerated down to 35 degrees . " 
 The streets of Gotham City use the old Brownstone Street and Hennessy Street on the Warners ’ backlot . 
 Warner Bros. devoted a large amount of secrecy for Batman Returns . The art department was required to keep their office blinds pulled down . Cast and crew had to have photo ID badges with the movie 's fake working title <unk> to go anywhere near the sets . Kevin Costner was refused a chance to visit the set . An entertainment magazine leaked the first photos of Danny DeVito as the Penguin ; in response Warner Bros. employed a private investigator to track down the accomplice . $ 65 million was spent during the production of Batman Returns , while $ 15 million was used for marketing , coming to a total cost of $ 80 million . The final shot of Catwoman looking at the Bat @-@ Signal was completed during post @-@ production and was not part of the shooting script . After Batman Returns was completed Warner Bros. felt it was best for Catwoman to survive , saving more characterizations in a future installment . Pfeiffer was unavailable and a body double was chosen . 
 = = = Design and effects = = = 
 Bo Welch , Burton 's collaborator on Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands , replaced Anton Furst as production designer , since Furst was unable to return for the sequel due to contractual obligations . Welch blended " Fascist architecture with World 's fair architecture " for Gotham City . He also studied Russian architecture and German Expressionism . An iron maiden was used for Bruce Wayne 's entry into the Batcave . Stan Winston , who worked with Burton on Edward Scissorhands , designed Danny DeVito 's prosthetic makeup , which took two hours to apply . DeVito had to put a combination of mouthwash and red / green food coloring in his mouth " to create a grotesque texture of some weird ooze . " 
 More than 60 <unk> were designed in the six @-@ month shoot at $ 1 @,@ 000 each . The Batsuit was updated , which was made out of a thinner , slightly more flexible foam rubber material than the suit from Batman . DeVito was uncomfortable with his costume , but this made it easy for him to get into character . J. P. Morgan 's wardrobe was used for inspiration on Max Shreck 's costume design . 
 The bats were entirely composed of computer @-@ generated imagery since it was decided directing real bats on set would be problematic . The Penguin 's " bird army " was a combination of CGI , robotic creatures , men in suits and even real penguins . Robotic penguin puppets were commissioned by Stan Winston . In total 30 African penguins and 12 king penguins were used . A miniature effect was used for the exteriors of the Cobblepot Mansion in the opening scene and for Wayne Manor . The same method was used for the Bat Ski @-@ boat and the exterior shots of the Gotham Zoo .

 Danny Elfman had great enthusiasm for returning because " I didn 't have to prove myself from the first film . I remember Jon Peters was very skeptical at first to hire me . " Elfman 's work schedule was 12 hours a day , 7 days a week . " When completing this movie I realized it was something of a film score and an opera . It was 95 minutes long , twice the amount of the average of film score . " Burton allowed Elfman to be more artistic with the sequel score , such as the " scraping " on violins for the cat themes . Under the pressure of finishing the score , however , the relationship between the two strained , which — along with further " creative differences " on The Nightmare Before Christmas — led Burton to use Howard Shore to score his next film Ed Wood . The musician co @-@ orchestrated " Face to Face " , which was written and performed by Siouxsie and the Banshees . The song can be heard in one scene during the film and during the end credits .
