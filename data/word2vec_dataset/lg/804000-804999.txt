 The first scientific description of the night shark was published by Cuban zoologist Felipe Poey in 1868 , as part of a series of papers entitled <unk> <unk> @-@ natural de la <unk> de Cuba . He based his description on a single set of jaws and gave it the name Hypoprion signatus . In 1973 , Leonard Compagno synonymized the genus Hypoprion with Carcharhinus . No type specimen has been designated for this species . Its common name comes from the fact that it is mostly captured at night . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The distribution of the night shark extends along the outer continental shelves and upper continental slopes of the Atlantic Ocean , from the U.S. state of Massachusetts to Argentina in the west , including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea , and from Senegal to northern Namibia in the east . In United States waters , it is relatively common off North Carolina and Florida ( particularly the Florida Straits ) and rarer elsewhere . There are questionable reports of this species off the Pacific coast of Panama . 
 The night shark is a deepwater species that has been reported from as far down as 2 km ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) , though it occasionally ventures to within 26 m ( 85 ft ) of the surface . Off the southeastern United States , it is usually caught at a depth range of 50 – 600 m ( 160 – 1 @,@ 970 ft ) . Off northeastern Brazil , the night shark is most commonly found near the summits of seamounts ranging from 38 m ( 125 ft ) to 370 m ( 1 @,@ 210 ft ) deep . Off West Africa , it occurs at depths of 90 – 285 m ( 295 – 935 ft ) , where the temperature is 11 – 16 ° C ( 52 – 61 ° F ) , the salinity is 36 ppt , and the dissolved oxygen level is 1 @.@ 81 ml / l . Annual variation in Cuban catch rates may indicate a seasonal migration . 
 = = Description = = 
 The night shark has a slender build with an elongated , pointed snout . The nares are flanked by moderately developed flaps of skin . The eyes are large , circular , and green in life , with irregularly shaped pupils and a nictitating membrane ( protective third eyelid ) . The mouth lacks conspicuous furrows at the corners and usually bears 15 tooth rows on either side of both jaws , plus 1 – 2 upper and 1 lower symphysial ( jaw midline ) tooth rows . Each upper tooth has a smooth to serrated edge , a narrow cusp becoming more oblique towards the corner of the mouth , and 2 – 5 coarse serrations at the base of the trailing margin . The number and size of serrations on the leading margin of the tooth cusp increase relative to those on the trailing margin as the animal grows older . The lower teeth are upright and smooth @-@ edged . The five pairs of gill slits are rather short . 
 The pectoral fins are less than a fifth as long as the total body length and taper towards a somewhat rounded tip . The first dorsal fin is relatively small , triangular , and pointed , originating over the free rear tips of the pectoral fins . The second dorsal fin is much smaller than the first and originates over or slightly ahead of the anal fin . There is a ridge running between the dorsal fins . The dermal denticles are not tightly packed and overlap each other minimally . Each denticle is diamond @-@ shaped with horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth , the number increasing from 3 in juveniles to 5 – 7 in adults . The coloration is grayish blue or brown above and whitish below , without fin markings . There is a faint band on each side and sometimes small black spots scattered over the back . This species usually grows to 2 @.@ 0 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) long , but has been recorded reaching a length and weight of 2 @.@ 8 m ( 9 @.@ 2 ft ) and 76 @.@ 7 kg ( 169 lb ) respectively . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 Fast and energetic , the night shark feeds primarily on small , active bony fishes such as mullet , mackerel , butterfish , sea basses , and flyingfish . Squid and shrimp are also sometimes taken . Most feeding activity occurs at night , hence its common name , with peaks at dawn and dusk . Catch records indicate that this species is usually found in schools and conducts a diel vertical migration , spending the day at a depth of 275 – 366 m ( 902 – 1 @,@ 201 ft ) and moving up to shallower than 183 m ( 600 ft ) at night . <unk> and gravid females are rarely ever caught , suggesting that during this period they may stop feeding or segregate themselves from others of their species . Potential predators of the night shark include larger sharks . Known parasites include the copepods Kroyeria <unk> , which attach to the gills , Pandarus bicolor and P. smithii , which infest the skin , and the tapeworms Heteronybelinia <unk> , H. <unk> and <unk> dollfusi , which are found in the spiral valve intestine . Another parasite is an undescribed isopod similar to <unk> <unk> . The common remora ( Remora remora ) may be found attached to this species . 
 Like other members of its family , the night shark is viviparous : once the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk , the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment . Adult females have a single functional ovary ( on the right ) and two functional uteruses , which are divided into separate compartments for each embryo . Within the uterus the embryos lie lengthwise with their heads pointing the same direction as their mother . Most information known about the night shark 's life history comes from the subpopulation off northeastern Brazil , and may not hold true in other parts of the species range . Northeastern Brazilian sharks mate throughout the summer , with the males biting at the female 's body and fins as a prelude to copulation . 
 After a year @-@ long gestation period , females give birth to 4 – 18 ( usually 12 or more ) pups . Embryos at varying stages of development have been found in both February and June , suggesting that the parturition takes place over a span of several months . An important nursery area is believed to exist at the continental shelf break at 34 ° S latitude , near the southern extreme of this species ' range . The newborn young measure 50 – 72 cm ( 20 – 28 in ) long , and add around 25 cm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) or 38 % of their body length in their first year . This fast rate of growth serves to shorten the period immediately after birth when the small pups are most vulnerable to predators , a strategy similar to that employed by the silky shark ( C. falciformis ) . By the time the sharks reach adulthood , the growth rate slows to a more modest 8 @.@ 6 cm ( 3 @.@ 4 in ) per year . There is no difference in growth rate between sexes . Males mature sexually at a length of 1 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 9 m ( 5 @.@ 9 – 6 @.@ 2 ft ) , corresponding to an age of 8 years , and females at a length of 2 @.@ 0 – 2 @.@ 1 m ( 6 @.@ 6 – 6 @.@ 9 ft ) , corresponding to an age of 10 years . The oldest known individuals are 17 years old ; based on growth curves the maximum lifespan has been estimated at 28 years for males and 30 years for females .

 Because of its deepwater habitat , the night shark is not known to pose a danger to humans . This species is prized for its large fins , which are exported for use in shark fin soup , and is also utilized as a source of meat , liver oil , and fishmeal . Traditionally it has comprised a part of the bycatch of pelagic longline fisheries targeting swordfish ( Xiphius gladius ) and tuna in the western Atlantic . Since 1991 , it has also been the focus of a longline fishery operating over seamounts off northeastern Brazil , where large numbers of sharks congregate and are easily captured . Some 90 % of the seamount shark and ray catch in this area now consists of night sharks ; of those approximately 89 % are juveniles . However , a study has found that night sharks from off northeastern Brazil accumulate high levels of mercury within their bodies , likely from their piscivorous diet . Some 92 % of sharks examined contained mercury levels higher than that allowed for marketed carnivorous fish set by the Brazilian legislature , and the average mercury concentration was 1 @.@ 742 mg / kg . Therefore , eating only 0 @.@ 1 kg ( 0 @.@ 22 lb ) of night shark meat per day could result in the ingestion of several times the daily mercury content judged safe by the World Health Organization . 
 The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed the night shark globally as Vulnerable , citing its slow reproductive rate and historical declines under fishing pressure . It has also been listed as Vulnerable by the American Fisheries Society ( AFS ) . This species was once a significant part of the Cuban artisanal shark fishery , comprising 60 – 75 % of the catch from 1937 to 1941 , before its numbers dropped substantially in the 1970s . Similarly , the proportion of night sharks in the shark catch of the southeastern U.S. pelagic longline fishery fell from 26 @.@ 1 % from 1981 to 1983 to 0 @.@ 3 – 3 @.@ 3 % in 1993 and 1994 ; a comparable decline was observed in catches by south Florida marlin tournaments since the 1970s . Currently , the intense Brazilian targeted fishery is of particular concern , although fishing pressure on the night shark may be relaxing as the fishery is beginning to shift towards swordfish and bigeye tuna ( Thunnus obesus ) . No fishery information on the night shark is available for the eastern Atlantic , leading to an IUCN assessment of Data Deficient for that region . 
 In 1997 , the U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) National Marine Fisheries Service ( NMFS ) listed the night shark as a " Species of Concern " , meaning that it merits conservation concern but there is insufficient evidence for listing on the Endangered Species Act ( ESA ) . In 1999 , the NMFS Fishery Management Plan ( FMP ) of the Atlantic tunas , swordfish , and sharks was revised to prohibit the retention of 19 species , including the night shark . The prohibition of this species was upheld by Amendment 1 of the FMP , added in 2003 . Night sharks suffer high bycatch mortality on longlines , and prohibited or not some are kept by fishers because of their value and the difficulty of identifying disembodied parts to species . Nevertheless , a 2003 – 2008 NMFS population assessment concluded that night shark population in United States waters has stabilized ( perhaps even increasing ) and no longer merits categorization as a " Species of Concern " , though recommended that the prohibition on retention be maintained as a precautionary measure . This species should also benefit from the imposition of time / area closures in the Florida Straits and on the Charleston Bump . Off Brazil and elsewhere , fishing continues largely unmanaged . IUCN members have urged that Brazil improve catch monitoring and enforcement of existing regulations , declare some critical habitat off @-@ limits , and implement the Brazilian National Plan of Action for Sharks ( <unk> @-@ Sharks ) under the FAO International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks ( <unk> @-@ Sharks ) .

 " Grilled Cheesus " is the third episode of the second season of the American television series Glee , and the twenty @-@ fifth episode overall . It was written by Brad Falchuk , directed by Alfonso Gomez @-@ Rejon , and premiered on the Fox network on October 5 , 2010 . Prior to its broadcast , series co @-@ creator Ryan Murphy predicted the episode would be Glee 's most controversial , as it focuses on religion and what God means to the members of the glee club . When Burt Hummel ( Mike O 'Malley ) has a heart attack , the glee club rally around his son Kurt ( Chris Colfer ) , attempting to support the Hummels through their various faiths . Meanwhile , club co @-@ captain Finn Hudson ( Cory Monteith ) believes he has found the face of Jesus in a grilled cheese sandwich . 
 Murphy hoped to produce a balanced depiction of religion , and he , Falchuk and series co @-@ creator Ian Brennan worked to ensure that there was an equality between pro and anti @-@ religious sentiments expressed . The episode features seven cover versions of songs , each of which charted on the Billboard Hot 100 , marking the series ' one @-@ week debut high in the US . Critics disagreed over the appropriateness of the musical performances , with some complaining of the tangential relationship between the numbers and religion , and others appreciating that the Glee versions brought new meaning to the songs . 
 " Grilled Cheesus " was watched by 11 @.@ 20 million US viewers , and was the second most watched scripted show of the week among adults aged 18 – 49 . It received mixed reviews , with Colfer and O 'Malley receiving critical acclaim , and several reviewers praising Glee for successfully balancing opposing viewpoints . However , other reviewers criticized the episode for its lack of subtlety , and Lisa Respers France of CNN denounced " Grilled Cheesus " as an Emmy @-@ submission showpiece for Colfer . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Glee club co @-@ captain Finn Hudson ( Cory Monteith ) believes he has found the face of Jesus in a grilled cheese sandwich , he asks for three prayers to be granted : for the school football team to win a game , for his girlfriend Rachel Berry ( Lea Michele ) to let him touch her breasts , and for him to be reinstated as quarterback . When his first prayer comes true , he asks the glee club to join him in honoring Jesus through song . 
 Club member Kurt Hummel ( Chris Colfer ) is devastated when his father Burt Hummel ( Mike O 'Malley ) suffers a heart attack . His best friend Mercedes Jones ( Amber Riley ) sings Whitney Houston 's " I Look to You " to him , hoping he will find strength in faith . However , Kurt reveals that he is an atheist . Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester ( Jane Lynch ) , also an atheist , takes umbrage at the glee club singing religious songs in a public school setting , and has Kurt make a formal complaint . When confronted by guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury ( Jayma Mays ) , Sue admits that as a child , she prayed that God would cure her sister Jean ( Robin Trocki ) , who has Down syndrome . Her prayers went unanswered , leading her to conclude that God simply does not exist . 
 Mercedes , Rachel and Quinn Fabray ( Dianna Agron ) pray for Burt , with Rachel singing " Papa , Can You Hear Me ? " from Yentl at his bedside . Kurt is resistant , and later at glee club rehearsal sings The Beatles ' " I Want to Hold Your Hand " , stating that his faith takes the form of love for his father . He accepts an invitation from Mercedes to attend her church , where the choir sing " Bridge over Troubled Water " . At the church service , Mercedes asks the congregation to pray for the Hummels . 
 Finn 's remaining prayers also come true . Rachel comes to Finn 's house one evening , and in his bedroom she admits that she would prefer to raise her children in the Jewish faith ; she would not be able to have a future with him if he puts his faith in Jesus . Finn agrees that their children would be raised as she chooses , so to confirm her trust and appreciation of him , she allows him to touch the side of her breast as they make out . Later , Finn is also reinstated as quarterback , but it occurs because his replacement Sam Evans ( Chord Overstreet ) is injured during a game , dislocating his shoulder . Finn feels responsible and confesses his guilt to Emma , who tells him it is unlikely God is communicating specifically with him through a grilled cheese sandwich . A despondent Finn doubts his new @-@ found faith , singing R.E.M. ' s " Losing My Religion " . 
 At Burt 's bedside , Kurt tells his still unconscious father that he feels he should have accepted his friends ' prayers . As Kurt cries , Burt begins to regain consciousness and is able to squeeze his son 's hand . Meanwhile , Sue visits Jean in her residential home and discusses God with her sister . Jean asks Sue if she may pray for her , and Sue accepts . Later , the glee club comes together to sing Joan Osborne 's " One of Us " . Sue watches the performance , but tells Will she will not report him for allowing a religious song . At home , Finn eats the remainder of the grilled cheese sandwich .

 " Grilled Cheesus " is intended to begin a season arc depicting the glee club members rallying around those who are subject to bullying and persecution . For Glee 's second season , Murphy confirmed plans to cast a Christian character on the show , expressing desires to keep Glee a " show about inclusiveness " . In an interview with TV Guide , Murphy said on Christianity , " If we 're trying to form a world of inclusiveness , we 've got to include that point of view as well . " He predicted " Grilled Cheesus " would be the most controversial episode of the series to date , as it depicts the spiritual and emotional importance of God to the characters . Murphy aimed to address religion in a " socially responsible " way , and compared " Grilled Cheesus " to topical Norman Lear shows of the 1970s . He hoped to produce a balanced depiction of the subject matter , and he , along with co @-@ writers Brennan and Falchuk , checked the script to ensure that for every anti @-@ religious sentiment conveyed , there was a pro @-@ religious one to counterbalance it . The episode references several religions apart from Christianity ; Puck and Rachel are both Jewish , Kurt hires an <unk> who is a Sikh , and makes a reference to the Flying Spaghetti Monster . 
 Sue 's philosophical argument with Emma about religion is the scene that Murphy is " most proud to have been involved with in [ his ] entire career . " Explaining Sue 's stance on religion , he stated : " Sue 's an atheist , but I love that she doesn 't want to be . She and [ Kurt ] are both saying to the world , ' Prove us wrong : If God is kindness and love , make me believe in God . ' " Murphy felt it would have been easy to have Kurt sing an anti @-@ religious song , but instead chose to have him sing about his faith in love . 
 O 'Malley was a recurring cast member throughout Glee 's first season , and was promoted to a series regular starting in season two . He commented that the episode would be an emotional one , developing the father @-@ son relationship further . Recurring characters who appear in this episode include glee club member Mike Chang ( Harry Shum , Jr . ) , football player Sam Evans , Principal Figgins ( Iqbal Theba ) , football coach Shannon Beiste ( Dot @-@ Marie Jones ) , Finn 's mother Carole Hudson ( Romy Rosemont ) , and Sue 's sister Jean Sylvester . An eight @-@ year @-@ old Kurt appears in a series of flashback scenes , including his mother 's funeral , played by child actor Adam Kolkin .

 The episode featured cover versions of Billy Joel 's " Only the Good Die Young " , Whitney Houston 's " I Look to You " , " Papa , Can You Hear Me ? " as performed by Barbra Streisand in the musical film Yentl , The Beatles ' " I Want to Hold Your Hand " as covered by T. V. Carpio in the musical film Across the Universe , R.E.M. ' s " Losing My Religion " , Simon & Garfunkel 's " Bridge over Troubled Water " as covered by Aretha Franklin , and Joan Osborne 's " One of Us " . Monteith said he and series music producer Adam Anders " had a bit of a different idea " about how " Losing My Religion " should be performed . While Anders " always brings the songs in very positive , very upbeat " , he felt the song " was expressing a betrayal " , and with Finn feeling both betrayal and anger , Monteith wanted his performance to reflect that . All songs performed were released as singles , available for download , and " I Want to Hold Your Hand " and " One of Us " are included on the album Glee : The Music , Volume 4 . All singles charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and Canadian Hot 100 . With seven new entries , it marked the series ' one @-@ week debut high in the US . The best performing single was " I Want to Hold Your Hand " , which reached number 21 in Canada and 36 in the US . With 69 @,@ 000 copies sold in the US , it also reached number 15 on the Hot Digital Songs chart . 
 Zap2it 's Carina Adly MacKenzie commented positively on Michele 's " beautiful " rendition of " Papa , Can You Hear Me ? " , however expressed displeasure that Rachel had cried during her solo in three consecutive episodes , suggesting the producers give her a more uplifting song . She praised Salling 's " Only the Good Die Young " , which was selected by Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post as the best performance of the episode , for being the most in @-@ keeping with Glee 's usual tone . Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone praised " I Want to Hold Your Hand " , writing that , " the Beatles ' coy flirtation is replaced with a simple , wistful plea that hits just the right note . " She commended Riley 's vocals on " Bridge over Troubled Water " , commenting that Murphy should assign Mercedes more solo performances . Futterman criticized " Losing My Religion " , however , observing that Monteith struggled to reach the notes , resulting in a performance " more awkward than inspired . " 
 Anthony Benigno of the Daily News commented positively on the arrangement of Monteith 's song , grading the performance " A " . His lowest grade went to " Papa , Can You Hear Me ? " , which he gave a " C " . Benigno felt that both Michele and Colfer 's solos were damaged by the fact that the songs ' only link to the episode 's plot were their titles , finding it particularly jarring to hear Kurt singing " I wanna be your man " about his father . The A.V. Club 's Todd VanDerWerff felt that the music was the worst aspect of the episode , similarly criticizing song selections based on their tangential relationship to religion . He felt that Kurt 's performance was the only number which worked even slightly , commenting , " it genuinely grows out of the moment , although the fact that Kurt is singing it to his dad never stops being kind of weird . " Both Jessica Derschowitz of CBS News and MTV 's Aly Semigran enjoyed that the performance of " I Want to Hold Your Hand " brought new meaning to the song , with Semigran naming it her favourite number of the episode . She felt that " I Look to You " was the episode 's weakest song , preferring Riley 's " more powerful " rendition of " Bridge over Troubled Water " . Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times expressed disappointment in both of Riley 's songs , which left her " strangely unmoved " . She suggested that , " Mercedes sang admirably , beautifully even , but she didn ’ t seem truly transported by the music ; so we weren 't . "

 The episode received mixed reviews from critics . Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly named it as one of his favorite episodes of the series , calling it " not only funny and moving , but incredibly important " , both for its religious element and message of tolerance . Stack praised the performances by Colfer and O 'Malley , as did USA Today 's Robert Bianco , who deemed the episode a " smart , moving , musical exploration of the power and limits of faith and religion in a democratic society " . Bianco commented positively on the way Colfer 's singing was used to " dig beneath the archness and anger in Kurt 's behavior " , calling it " a textbook example of what music can add to drama . " Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald went further in his praise , deeming " Grilled Cheesus " " the perfect blend of music , characterization and plot - and easily the most provocative scripted hour in prime @-@ time of the new season . " Perigard appreciated the fact there were no easy answers presented , with no characters undergoing religious conversions during the course of the episode . Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal felt that " Grilled Cheesus " succeeded in balancing opposing viewpoints , resulting in " a nuanced , atypical episode of Glee that was both conflictingly emotional and confidently serious about the topic of religion " , and Semigran similarly commended the episode 's balance , writing that Falchuk " covered both sides of controversial debate with grace , humor , and most importantly , respect . " In an article discussing Glee 's increasingly inconsistent tone , characterizations , and weird moments in the second season , film and television critic Matt Zoller Seitz cited " Grilled Cheesus " as an exception : " an episode built around an earnest , Afterschool Special @-@ style contemplation of faith that improbably turned out to be one of the series ' boldest , silliest , maybe finest hours " . 
 Robert Canning of IGN felt that " Grilled Cheesus " was too varied tonally , failing to effectively bring together the " true anguish " of Kurt 's storyline and " lunacy " of Finn 's . He rated it 7 @.@ 5 / 10 , signifying a good episode , though his overall opinion was mixed . Canning commented that the Hummels ' relationship is " the most affecting " of the show , and praised O 'Malley 's " outstandingly nuanced " performance as Burt , yet felt that the religious element gave the episode an after school special vibe and almost became " over @-@ the @-@ top preachy and self @-@ important " . VanDerWerff graded the episode " B- " , commenting that he was uncertain whether he genuinely loved it , or was overlooking flaws because it handled the religious element acceptably . VanDerWerff stated that it would be easy to criticize Glee , but while television as a whole does not do earnestness well , Glee at its best , as in " Grilled Cheesus " , " revels in just how damn earnest it can be " . James Poniewozik of Time wrote that the episode 's premise was " absurdly ambitious " , yet felt it was largely successful in being respectful to both atheism and religion . He criticized the musical numbers for detracting from the plot , but appreciated the focus on Kurt and Burt , also naming theirs one of Glee 's " strongest and most nuanced relationships " . 
 Lisa Respers France of CNN was dismayed that the episode felt forced , like an Emmy submission showpiece for Colfer . She disliked Kurt 's angry , " overwrought " reaction to his friends ' prayers and the " silly " grilled cheese sandwich subplot , however wished there had been more focus on the " rich , barely tapped vein " of the Sue subplot . The Atlantic 's Kevin Fallon criticized the episode 's lack of subtlety , feeling that in its attempt to be controversial , Glee became a clichéd after school special . Fallon had been excited to see religion and homosexuality tackled on Glee , but was disappointed that the end result was " completely devoid of humor " , with dialogue " so stilted , wooden , and earnest that the treatment of the subject was largely ineffective and far too easy to make fun of . " Benigno also commented negatively on the lack of subtlety , deeming it Glee 's " biggest flaw " . He commended Lynch 's performance as Sue , however , writing : " It 's outrageous how good she is despite having only three scenes of screen time . "

 Initially the ground consisted only of the pitch , around which an estimated 12 @,@ 000 spectators could congregate . The addition of stands in 1891 increased the capacity to about 15 @,@ 000 . The football club signed its first professional players in 1886 and began to break from its sponsoring railway company , but without the company 's financial support it was unable to afford the rent on the ground and was evicted .

 Following the foundation of Newton Heath LYR F.C. , at the request of the employees of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway ( LYR ) company 's Carriage and Wagon Works , the club needed a pitch to play on . The chosen site was owned by the Manchester Cathedral authorities , but although conveniently sited next to the wagon works it was a " bumpy , stony patch in summer , [ and ] a muddy , heavy swamp in the rainy months " . The railway company agreed to pay a nominal rent to the authorities and to lease the ground to the football club . As it was next to the railway line operated by the LYR , the ground was often clouded in a thick mist of steam from passing trains . Players had to get changed in The Three Crowns public house , a few hundred yards away on Oldham Road , as there were no facilities nearby . There may have been some kind of refreshment offered to supporters at the eastern end of the site . 
 The first recorded matches at the ground took place in 1880 , two years after the club 's formation , most of them friendlies . The first competitive match held at North Road was a Lancashire Cup first round match against Blackburn Olympic 's reserve team , played on 27 October 1883 , which Newton Heath lost 7 – 2 . Details of the attendance have been lost , but it is assumed that the ground must have been enclosed by then , as an entry fee of 3d ( about £ 1 as of 2016 ) was charged for the match . Football became a professional sport in England in 1885 , and Newton Heath signed their first professional players in the summer of 1886 . The club 's income was insufficient to cover its wage bill , and so the 3d admission charge was extended to all matches played at North Road , later rising to 6d . 
 = = = Expansion and eviction = = = 
 The ground originally had a capacity of about 12 @,@ 000 , but club officials decided that was not enough to give them any hope of joining the Football League . Some expansion took place in 1887 , but in 1891 Newton Heath used what little financial reserves they had to purchase two grandstands , each able to hold 1 @,@ 000 spectators . However , this transaction put the club at odds with the railway company , who refused to contribute any finance to the deal . The two organisations began to drift apart from then onwards , and in 1892 the club attempted to raise £ 2 @,@ 000 in share capital to pay off the debts incurred by the expansion of the ground . The split also led the railway company to stop paying the rent due on the ground to the cathedral , who at about the same time decided to increase the rent . Under increasing financial pressure , especially as the cathedral authorities felt it inappropriate for the club to charge admission to the ground , an eviction notice was served on the club in June 1893 . The club 's management had been searching for a new stadium since the first eviction attempt in May the previous year , and they were able to move to a new ground on Bank Street , three miles away in Clayton . It proved impossible though to take the two grandstands to the new ground , and they were sold for £ 100 . 
 = = = Present = = = 
 The stadium no longer exists , and North Road has been renamed Northampton Road . After a spell serving as playing fields for locals , Moston Brook High School was opened on the site . A red plaque was attached to one of the school 's walls , marking the location of the old stadium , but it was stolen and not replaced . Following the school 's closure in August 2000 , the site was chosen by the Northwest Regional Development Agency ( <unk> ) as the location of the North Manchester Business Park in 2002 .

 Newton Heath LYR Football Club was also founded as a cricket club , and the North Road ground was used by both branches of the club . However , the cricket and football seasons often overlapped , causing conflicts between the two sports . The ground was barely adequate for football , despite the best efforts of groundsmen Charlie and Ned Massey , but its use in the winter made it even less suitable for cricket in the summer . 
 = = Records = = 
 Although attendance figures were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road , the highest recorded attendance at the ground was approximately 15 @,@ 000 for a First Division match against Sunderland on 4 March 1893 . A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889 . A record @-@ low league attendance of approximately 1 @,@ 000 was recorded for Football Alliance matches against Walsall Town Swifts and Birmingham City on 21 April 1890 and 13 December 1890 respectively . However , an attendance of 400 was recorded for a Manchester Cup match against Eccles on 31 January 1885 . 
 The earliest recorded four @-@ figure attendance at the ground was 3 @,@ 000 for a friendly with West Gorton ( St. Mark 's ) on 12 November 1881 . This was the first recorded meeting of the two sides that eventually became Manchester United and Manchester City . 
 = Curve @-@ shortening flow = 
 In mathematics , the curve @-@ shortening flow is a process that modifies a smooth curve in the Euclidean plane by moving its points perpendicularly to the curve at a speed proportional to the curvature . The curve @-@ shortening flow is an example of a geometric flow , and is the one @-@ dimensional case of the mean curvature flow . Other names for the same process include the Euclidean shortening flow , geometric heat flow , and arc length evolution . 
 As the points of any smooth simple closed curve move in this way , the curve remains simple and smooth . It loses area at a constant rate , and its perimeter decreases as quickly as possible for any continuous curve evolution . If the curve is non @-@ convex , its total absolute curvature decreases monotonically , until it becomes convex . Once convex , the isoperimetric ratio of the curve decreases as the curve converges to a circular shape , before collapsing to a single point of singularity . If two disjoint simple smooth closed curves evolve , they remain disjoint until one of them collapses to a point . The circle is the only simple closed curve that maintains its shape under the curve @-@ shortening flow , but some curves that cross themselves or have infinite length keep their shape , including the grim reaper curve , an infinite curve that translates upwards , and spirals that rotate while remaining the same size and shape . 
 An approximation to the curve @-@ shortening flow can be computed numerically , by approximating the curve as a polygon and using the finite difference method to calculate the motion of each polygon vertex . Alternative methods include computing a convolution of polygon vertices and then <unk> vertices on the resulting curve , or repeatedly applying a median filter to a digital image whose black and white pixels represent the inside and outside of the curve . 
 The curve @-@ shortening flow was originally studied as a model for annealing of metal sheets . Later , it was applied in image analysis to give a multi @-@ scale representation of shapes . It can also model reaction – diffusion systems , and the behavior of cellular automata . In pure mathematics , the curve @-@ shortening flow can be used to find closed geodesics on Riemannian manifolds , and as a model for the behavior of higher @-@ dimensional flows . 
 = = Definitions = = 
 A flow is a process in which the points of a mathematical space continuously change their locations or properties over time . More specifically , in a one @-@ dimensional geometric flow such as the curve @-@ shortening flow , the points undergoing the flow belong to a curve , and what changes is the shape of the curve , its embedding into the Euclidean plane determined by the locations of each of its points . In the curve @-@ shortening flow , each point of a curve moves in the direction of a normal vector to the curve , at a rate proportional to the curvature . For an evolving curve represented by a two @-@ parameter function C ( s , t ) where s <unk> the arc length along the curve and t <unk> a time in the evolution of the curve , the curve @-@ shortening flow can be described by the parabolic partial differential equation 
 <formula> 
 a form of the heat equation , where κ is the curvature and n is the unit normal vector . 
 Because the ingredients of this equation , the arc length , curvature , and time , are all unaffected by translations and rotations of the Euclidean plane , it follows that the flow defined by this equation is invariant under translations and rotations ( or more precisely , <unk> ) . If the plane is scaled by a constant dilation factor , the flow remains essentially unchanged , but is slowed down or sped up by the same factor . 
 = = = Non @-@ smooth curves = = = 
 In order for the flow to be well defined , the given curve must be sufficiently smooth that it has a continuous curvature . However , once the flow starts , the curve becomes analytic , and remains so until reaching a singularity at which the curvature blows up . For a smooth curve without crossings , the only possible singularity happens when the curve collapses to a point , but immersed curves can have other types of singularity . In such cases , with some care it is possible to continue the flow past these singularities until the whole curve shrinks to a single point . 
 For a simple closed curve , using an extension of the flow to non @-@ smooth curves based on the level set method , there are only two possibilities . Curves with zero Lebesgue measure ( including all polygons and piecewise @-@ smooth curves ) instantly evolve into smooth curves , after which they evolve as any smooth curve would . However , Osgood curves with nonzero measure instead immediately evolve into a topological annulus with nonzero area and smooth boundaries . The topologist 's sine curve is an example that instantly becomes smooth , despite not even being locally connected ; examples such as this show that the reverse evolution of the curve @-@ shortening flow can take well @-@ behaved curves to complicated singularities in a finite amount of time . 
 = = = Non @-@ Euclidean surfaces = = = 
 The curve @-@ shortening flow , and many of the results about the curve @-@ shortening flow , can be generalized from the Euclidean plane to any two @-@ dimensional Riemannian manifold . In order to avoid additional types of singularity , it is important for the manifold to be convex at infinity ; this is defined to mean that every compact set has a compact convex hull , as defined using geodesic convexity . The curve @-@ shortening flow cannot cause a curve to depart from its convex hull , so this condition prevents parts of the curve from reaching the boundary of the manifold . 
 = = = Space curves = = = 
 The curve @-@ shortening flow has also been studied for curves in three @-@ dimensional Euclidean space . The normal vector in this case can be defined ( as in the plane ) as the derivative of the tangent vector with respect to arc length , normalized to be a unit vector ; it is one of the components of the <unk> – <unk> frame . It is not well defined at points of zero curvature , but the product of the curvature and the normal vector remains well defined at those points , allowing the curve @-@ shortening flow to be defined . Curves in space may cross each other or themselves according to this flow , and the flow may lead to singularities in the curves ; every singularity is asymptotic to a plane . The curve shortening flow for space curves has been used as a way to define flow past singularities in plane curves . 
 = = = Beyond curves = = = 
 It is possible to extend the definition of the flow to more general inputs than curves , for instance by using rectifiable <unk> or the level set method . However , these extended definitions may allow parts of curves to vanish instantaneously or fatten into sets of nonzero area . 
 A commonly studied variation of the problem involves networks of interior @-@ disjoint smooth curves , with junctions where three or more of the curves meet . When the junctions all have exactly three curves meeting at angles of 2π / 3 ( the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two @-@ dimensional foam of soap bubbles ) the flow is well @-@ defined for the short term . However , it may eventually reach a singular state with four or more curves meeting at a junction , and there may be more than one way to continue the flow past such a singularity . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 = = = Avoidance principle , radius , and stretch factor = = = 
 If two disjoint smooth simple closed curves undergo the curve @-@ shortening flow simultaneously , they remain disjoint as the flow progresses . The reason is that , if two smooth curves move in a way that creates a crossing , then at the time of first crossing the curves would necessarily be tangent to each other , without crossing . But , in such a situation , the two curves ' curvatures at the point of tangency would necessarily pull them apart rather than pushing them together into a crossing . For the same reason , a single simple closed curve can never evolve to cross itself . 
 The avoidance principle implies that any smooth curve eventually either reaches a singularity ( such as a point of infinite curvature ) or collapses to a point . For , if a given smooth curve C is surrounded by a circle , both will remain disjoint until one or the other collapses or reaches a singularity . But the enclosing circle shrinks under the curvature flow , remaining circular , until it collapses , and by the avoidance principle C must remain contained within it . By the same reasoning , the radius of the smallest circle that encloses C must decrease at a rate that is at least as fast as the decrease in radius of a circle undergoing the same flow . 
 Huisken ( 1998 ) quantifies the avoidance principle for a single curve in terms of the ratio between the arc length ( of the shorter of two arcs ) and Euclidean distance between pairs of points , sometimes called the stretch factor . He shows that the stretch factor is strictly decreasing at each of its local maxima , except for the case of the two ends of a diameter of a circle in which case the stretch factor is constant at π . This monotonicity property implies the avoidance principle , for if the curve would ever touch itself the stretch factor would become infinite at the two touching points . 
 = = = Length = = = 
 As a curve undergoes the curve @-@ shortening flow , its length L decreases at a rate given by the formula 
 <formula> 
 where the interval is taken over the curve , κ is the curvature , and s is arc length along the curve . The integrand is always non @-@ negative , and for any smooth closed curve there exist arcs within which it is strictly positive , so the length decreases monotonically . More generally , for any evolution of curves whose normal speed is f , the rate of change in length is 
 <formula> 
 which can be interpreted as a negated inner product between the given evolution and the curve @-@ shortening flow . Thus , the curve @-@ shortening flow can be described as the gradient flow for length , the flow that ( locally ) decreases the length of the curve as quickly as possible relative to the L2 norm of the flow . This property is the one that gives the curve @-@ shortening flow its name . 
 = = = Area = = = 
 For a simple closed curve , the area enclosed by the curve shrinks , at the constant rate of 2π units of area per unit of time , independent of the curve . Therefore , the total time for a curve to shrink to a point is proportional to its area , regardless of its initial shape . Because the area of a curve is reduced at a constant rate , and ( by the isoperimetric inequality ) a circle has the greatest possible area among simple closed curves of a given length , it follows that circles are the slowest curves to collapse to a point under the curve @-@ shortening flow . All other curves take less time to collapse than a circle of the same length . 
 The constant rate of area reduction is the only conservation law satisfied by the curve @-@ shortening flow . This implies that it is not possible to express the " vanishing point " where the curve eventually collapses as an integral over the curve of any function of its points and their derivatives , because such an expression would lead to a forbidden second conservation law . However , by combining the constant rate of area loss with the avoidance principle , it is possible to prove that the vanishing point always lies within a circle , concentric with the minimum enclosing circle , whose area is the difference in areas between the enclosing circle and the given curve . 
 = = = Total absolute curvature = = = 
 The total absolute curvature of a smooth curve is the integral of the absolute value of the curvature along the arc length of the curve , 
 <formula> 
 It can also be expressed as a sum of the angles between the normal vectors at consecutive pairs of inflection points . It is 2π for convex curves and larger for non @-@ convex curves , serving as a measure of non @-@ convexity of a curve . 
 New inflection points cannot be created by the curve @-@ shortening flow . Each of the angles in the representation of the total absolute curvature as a sum decreases monotonically , except at the instants when two consecutive inflection points reach the same angle or position as each other and are both eliminated . Therefore , the total absolute curvature can never increase as the curve evolves . For convex curves it is constant at 2π and for non @-@ convex curves it decreases monotonically . 
 = = = Gage – Hamilton – Grayson theorem = = = 
 If a smooth simple closed curve undergoes the curve @-@ shortening flow , it remains smoothly embedded without self @-@ intersections . It will eventually become convex , and once it does so it will remain convex . After this time , all points of the curve will move inwards , and the shape of the curve will converge to a circle as the whole curve shrinks to a single point . This behavior is sometimes summarized by saying that every simple closed curve shrinks to a " round point " . 
 This result is due to Michael Gage , Richard Hamilton , and Matthew Grayson . Gage ( 1983 , 1984 ) proved convergence to a circle for convex curves that contract to a point . More specifically Gage showed that the isoperimetric ratio ( the ratio of squared curve length to area , a number that is 4π for a circle and larger for any other convex curve ) decreases monotonically and quickly . Gage & Hamilton ( 1986 ) proved that all smooth convex curves eventually contract to a point without forming any other singularities , and Grayson ( 1987 ) proved that every non @-@ convex curve will eventually become convex . Andrews & Bryan ( 2011 ) provide a simpler proof of Grayson 's result , based on the monotonicity of the stretch factor . 
 Similar results can be extended from closed curves to unbounded curves satisfying a local Lipschitz condition . For such curves , if both sides of the curve have infinite area , then the evolved curve remains smooth and singularity @-@ free for all time . However , if one side of an unbounded curve has finite area , and the curve has finite total absolute curvature , then its evolution reaches a singularity in time proportional to the area on the finite @-@ area side of the curve , with unbounded curvature near the singularity . For curves that are graphs of sufficiently well @-@ behaved functions , asymptotic to a ray in each direction , the solution converges in shape to a unique shape that is asymptotic to the same rays . For networks formed by two disjoint rays on the same line , together with two smooth curves connecting the endpoints of the two rays , an analogue of the Gage – Hamilton – Grayson theorem holds , under which the region between the two curves becomes convex and then converges to a vesica piscis shape . 
 = = = <unk> of self @-@ crossing curves = = = 
 Curves that have self @-@ crossings may reach singularities before contracting to a point . For instance , if a lemniscate ( any smooth immersed curve with a single crossing , resembling a figure 8 or infinity symbol ) has unequal areas in its two lobes , then eventually the smaller lobe will collapse to a point . However , if the two lobes have equal areas , then they will remain equal throughout the evolution of the curve , and the isoperimetric ratio will diverge as the curve collapses to a singularity . 
 When a locally convex self @-@ crossing curve approaches a singularity as one of its loops shrinks , it either shrinks in a self @-@ similar way or asymptotically approaches the grim reaper curve ( described below ) as it shrinks . When a loop collapses to a singularity , the amount of total absolute curvature that is lost is either at least 2π or exactly π . 
 = = = On Riemannian manifolds = = = 
 On a Riemannian manifold , any smooth simple closed curve will remain smooth and simple as it evolves , just as in the Euclidean case . It will either collapse to a point in a finite amount of time , or remain smooth and simple forever . In the latter case , the curve necessarily converges to a closed geodesic of the surface . 
 Immersed curves on Riemannian manifolds , with finitely many self @-@ crossings , become self @-@ tangent only at a discrete set of times , at each of which they lose a crossing . As a consequence the number of self @-@ crossing points is non @-@ decreasing . 
 = = = Huisken 's monotonicity formula = = = 
 According to Huisken 's monotonicity formula , the convolution of an evolving curve with a time @-@ reversed heat kernel is non @-@ increasing . This result can be used to analyze the singularities of the evolution . 
 = = Specific curves = = 
 = = = Curves with self @-@ similar evolution = = = 
 Because every other simple closed curve converges to a circle , the circle is the only simple closed curve that keeps its shape under the curve @-@ shortening flow . However , there are many other examples of curves that are either non @-@ simple ( they include self @-@ crossings ) or non @-@ closed ( they extend to infinity ) and keep their shape . In particular , 
 Every line stays unchanged by the curve @-@ shortening flow . Lines are the only curves that are unaffected by the curve @-@ shortening flow , although there exist more complex stable networks of curves , such as the hexagonal tiling of the plane . 
 The grim reaper curve y = − log cos x moves upwards without changing its shape . In the same way , any curve similar to the grim reaper is translated by the curve @-@ shortening flow , shifted in the direction of the symmetry axis of the curve without changing its shape or orientation . The grim reaper is the only curve with this property . It is also called the hairpin model in the physics literature . 
 A family of self @-@ crossing closed curves , derived from projections of torus knots , shrink <unk> but remain self @-@ similar under the curve @-@ shortening flow . These have come to be known as the Abresch – Langer curves , after the work of Abresch & Langer ( 1986 ) , although they were mentioned earlier by Mullins ( 1956 ) and rediscovered independently by Epstein & Weinstein ( 1987 ) . These curves are locally convex , and therefore can be described by their support functions . Suitably scaled versions of these support functions obey the differential equation 
 <formula> 
 which has positive periodic solutions ( corresponding to curves with self @-@ similar evolution ) for any period that is strictly between π and <formula> . 
 Other curves , including some infinite spirals , remain self @-@ similar with more complicated motions including rotation or combinations of rotation , shrinking or expansion , and translation . 
 For networks of smooth curves , meeting in threes at junctions with angles of 2π / 3 , the self @-@ similar shrinking solutions include a double bubble surrounding two equal areas , a lens shape ( vesica piscis ) bounded by two congruent arcs of circles together with two collinear rays having their apexes at the corners of the lens , and a " fish @-@ shaped " network bounded by a line segment , two rays , and a convex curve . Any other self @-@ similar shrinking networks involve a larger number of curves . Another family of networks grows <unk> and remains self @-@ similar ; these are tree @-@ like networks of curves , meeting at angles of 2π / 3 at triple junctions , asymptotic to a fan of two or more rays that meet at a common endpoint . The two @-@ ray case of these shapes is an unbounded smooth curve ; for three or more rays the evolution of these shapes may be defined using generalized variants of the curve @-@ shortening flow such as the one for <unk> . A given fan of four or more rays may be asymptotic to more than one different solution of this type , so these solutions do not provide a unique definition for the curve @-@ shortening flow starting from a fan of rays . 
 = = = Ancient solutions = = = 
 An ancient solution to a flow problem is a curve whose evolution can be extrapolated backwards for all time , without singularities . All of the self @-@ similar solutions that shrink or stay the same size rather than growing are ancient solutions in this sense ; they can be extrapolated backwards by reversing the self @-@ similarity transformation that they would undergo by the forwards curve @-@ shortening flow . Thus , for instance , the circle , grim reaper , and Abresch – Langer curves are all ancient solutions . 
 The only closed curves other than the circle and Abresch – Langer curves that form ancient solutions are a class of curves called the <unk> ovals after the work of <unk> ( 1992 ) . These curves may be parameterized by specifying their curvature as a function of the tangent angle using the formula 
 <formula> 
 and have as their limiting shape under reverse evolution a pair of grim reaper curves approaching each other from opposite directions . In the Cartesian coordinate system , they may be given by the implicit curve equation 
 <formula> 
 In the physics literature , the same shapes are known as the <unk> model . 
 For more general classes of curves , such as the graphs of functions , a more diverse collection of ancient solutions is known . 
 = = Numerical approximations = = 
 In order to compute the curve @-@ shortening flow efficiently , both a continuous curve and the continuous evolution of the curve need to be replaced by a discrete approximation . 
 = = = Front tracking = = = 
 Front tracking methods have long been used in fluid dynamics to model and track the motion of boundaries between different materials , of steep gradients in material properties such as weather fronts , or of shock waves within a single material . These methods involve deriving the equations of motion of the boundary , and using them to directly simulate the motion of the boundary , rather than simulating the underlying fluid and treating the boundary as an emergent property of the fluid . The same methods can also be used to simulate the curve @-@ shortening flow , even when the curve undergoing the flow is not a boundary or shock . 
 In front tracking methods for curve shortening , the curve undergoing the evolution is <unk> as a polygon . The finite difference method is used to derive formulas for the approximate normal vector and curvature at each vertex of the polygon , and these values are used to determine how to move each vertex in each time step . In some cases the normal motion of the points is combined with a tangential motion to spread them more uniformly around the curve . Merriman , Bence & Osher ( 1992 ) write that these methods are fast and accurate but that it is much more complicated to extend them to versions of the curve @-@ shortening flow that apply to more complicated inputs than simple closed curves , where it is necessary to deal with singularities and changes of topology . 
 For most such methods , Cao ( 2003 ) warns that " The conditions of stability cannot be determined easily and the time step must be chosen ad hoc . " Another finite differencing method by Crandall & Lions ( 1996 ) modifies the formula for the curvature at each vertex by adding to it a small term based on the Laplace operator . This modification is called elliptic regularization , and it can be used to help prove the existence of generalized flows as well as in their numerical simulation . Using it , the method of Crandall and Lions can be proven to converge and is the only numerical method listed by Cao that is equipped with bounds on its convergence rate . For an empirical comparison of the forward Euler , backward Euler , and more accurate Crank – Nicolson finite difference methods , see <unk> & <unk> ( 2009 ) . 
 = = = <unk> convolution = = = 
 Mokhtarian & Mackworth ( 1992 ) suggest a numerical method for computing an approximation to the curve @-@ shortening flow that maintains a discrete approximation to the curve and alternates between two steps : 
 <unk> the current curve by placing new sample points at a uniform spacing , as measured by normalized arc length . 
 <unk> the locations of the points with a Gaussian function with small standard deviation , in effect replacing each point 's location with a weighted average of the locations of nearby points along the curve , with Gaussian weights . The standard deviation of the Gaussian should be chosen to be small enough that , after this step , the sample points still have nearly @-@ uniform spacing . 
 As they show , this method converges to the curve @-@ shortening distribution in the limit as the number of sample points grows and the normalized arc length of the convolution radius shrinks . 
 = = = Median filtering = = = 
 Merriman , Bence & Osher ( 1992 ) describe a scheme operating on a two @-@ <unk> square grid – effectively an array of pixels . The curve to be evolved is represented by assigning the value 0 ( black ) to pixels exterior to the curve , and 1 ( white ) to pixels interior to the curve , giving the indicator function for the interior of the curve . This representation is updated by alternating two steps : 
 <unk> the pixelated image with a heat kernel to simulate its evolution under the heat equation for a short time step . The result is a Gaussian blur of the image , or equivalently the Weierstrass transform of the indicator function , with radius proportional to the square root of the time step . 
 Set every pixel with numerical value less than 1 / 2 to 0 , and every pixel with numerical value greater than 1 / 2 to 1 , <unk> the image back to its original values in new positions . 
 In order for this scheme to be accurate , the time step must be large enough to cause the curve to move by at least one pixel even at points of low curvature , but small enough to cause the radius of blurring to be less than the minimum radius of curvature . Therefore , the size of a pixel must be O ( min κ / max <unk> ) , small enough to allow a suitable intermediate time step to be chosen . 
 The method can be generalized to the evolution of networks of curves , meeting at junctions and dividing the plane into more than three regions , by applying the same method simultaneously to each region . Instead of blurring and <unk> , this method can alternatively be described as applying a median filter with Gaussian weights to each pixel . It is possible to use kernels other than the heat kernel , or to adaptively refine the grid so that it has high resolution near the curve but does not waste time and memory on pixels far from the curve that do not contribute to the outcome . Instead of using only the two values in the pixelated image , a version of this method that uses an image whose pixel values represent the signed distance to the curve can achieve <unk> accuracy and require lower resolution .

 = = = Annealing metal sheets = = = 
 An early reference to the curve @-@ shortening flow by William W. Mullins ( 1956 ) motivates it as a model for the physical process of annealing , in which heat treatment causes the boundaries between grains of crystallized metal to shift . Unlike soap films , which are forced by differences in air pressure to become surfaces of constant mean curvature , the grain boundaries in annealing are subject only to local effects , which cause them to move according to the mean curvature flow . The one @-@ dimensional case of this flow , the curve @-@ shortening flow , corresponds to annealing sheets of metal that are thin enough for the grains to become effectively two @-@ dimensional and their boundaries to become one @-@ dimensional . 
 = = = Shape analysis = = = 
 In image processing and computer vision , Mokhtarian & Mackworth ( 1992 ) suggest applying the curve @-@ shortening flow to the outline of a shape derived from a digital image , in order to remove noise from the shape and provide a scale space that provides a simplified description of the shape at different levels of resolution . The method of Mokhtarian and Mackworth involves computing the curve @-@ shortening flow , tracking the inflection points of the curve as they progress through the flow , and drawing a graph that plots the positions of the inflection points around the curve against the time parameter . The inflection points will typically be removed from the curve in pairs as the curve becomes convex ( according to the Gage – Hamilton – Grayson theorem ) and the lifetime of a pair of points corresponds to the salience of a feature of the shape . Because of the resampled convolution method that they describe for computing a numerical approximation of the curve @-@ shortening flow , they call their method the resampled curvature scale space . They observe that this scale space is invariant under Euclidean transformations of the given shape , and assert that it uniquely determines the shape and is robust against small variations in the shape . They compare it experimentally against several related alternative definitions of a scale space for shapes , and find that the resampled curvature scale space is less computationally intensive , more robust against <unk> noise , and less strongly influenced by small @-@ scale shape differences . 
 = = = Reaction @-@ diffusion = = = 
 In reaction – diffusion systems modeled by the Allen – Cahn equation , the limiting behavior for fast reaction , slow diffusion , and two or more local minima of energy with the same energy level as each other is for the system to settle into regions of different local minima , with the fronts delimiting boundaries between these regions evolving according to the curve @-@ shortening flow . 
 = = = Cellular automata = = = 
 In a cellular automaton , each cell in an infinite grid of cells may have one of a finite set of states , and all cells update their states simultaneously based only on the configuration of a small set of neighboring cells . A Life @-@ like cellular automaton rule is one in which the grid is the infinite square lattice , there are exactly two cell states , the set of neighbors of each cell are the eight neighbors of the Moore neighborhood , and the update rule depends only on the number of neighbors with each of the two states rather than on any more complicated function of those states . In one particular life @-@ like rule , introduced by Gerard <unk> and called the twisted majority rule or annealing rule , the update rule sets the new value for each cell to be the majority among the nine cells given by it and its eight neighbors , except when these cells are split among four with one state and five with the other state , in which case the new value of the cell is the minority rather than the majority . The detailed dynamics of this rule are complicated , including the existence of small stable structures . However , in the aggregate ( when started with all cells in random states ) it tends to form large regions of cells that are all in the same state as each other , with the boundaries between these regions evolving according to the curve @-@ shortening flow . 
 = = = Construction of closed geodesics = = = 
 The curve @-@ shortening flow can be used to prove an isoperimetric inequality for surfaces whose Gaussian curvature is a non @-@ increasing function of the distance from the origin , such as the paraboloid . On such a surface , the smooth compact set that has any given area and minimum perimeter for that area is necessarily a circle centered at the origin . The proof applies the curve @-@ shortening flow to two curves , a metric circle and the boundary of any other compact set , and compares the change in perimeter of the two curves as they are both reduced to a point by the flow . The curve @-@ shortening flow can also be used to prove the theorem of the three geodesics , that every smooth Riemannian manifold topologically equivalent to a sphere has three geodesics that form simple closed curves . 
 = = Related flows = = 
 Other geometric flows related to the curve @-@ shortening flow include the following ones . 
 For simulating the behavior of crystals or other anisotropic materials , it is important to have variants of the curve @-@ shortening flow for which the speed of flow depends on the orientation of a curve as well as on its curvature . One way of doing this is to define the energy of a curve to be the integral of a smooth function γ of its normal vectors , and form the gradient flow of this energy , according to which the normal speed at which the curve flows is proportional to an anisotropic analog of the curvature . This flow can be simulated by <unk> the curve as a polygon . In numerical experiments , initial curves appear to converge to the Wulff shape for γ before shrinking to a point . Alternatively , one can let the curve flow with speed a ( θ ) κ + b ( θ ) where κ is the ( usual ) curvature and a and b are smooth functions of the orientation θ . When a ( θ + π ) 
 = a ( θ ) and b ( θ + π ) = 
 − b ( θ ) ( so that the flow is invariant under point reflection ) , the resulting flow can be shown to obey the avoidance principle and an analog of the Gage – Hamilton – Grayson theorem . 
 The affine curve @-@ shortening flow was first investigated by Alvarez et al . ( 1993 ) and Sapiro & Tannenbaum ( 1993 ) . In this flow , the normal speed of the curve is proportional to the cube root of the curvature . The resulting flow is invariant ( with a corresponding time scaling ) under the affine transformations of the Euclidean plane , a larger symmetry group than the similarity transformations under which the curve @-@ shortening flow is invariant . Under this flow , an analogue of the Gage – Hamilton – Grayson theorem applies , under which any simple closed curve eventually becomes convex and then converges to an ellipse as it collapses to a point . 
 Transforming a curve with equal normal speeds at all points has been called the <unk> transform . Curves evolved in this way will in general develop sharp corners , the trace of which forms the medial axis of the curve . A closely related curve evolution which moves straight segments of a polygonal curve at equal speeds but allows concave corners to move more quickly than unit speed instead forms a different type of topological skeleton of the given curve , its straight skeleton . 
 For surfaces in higher dimensions , there is more than one definition of curvature , including extrinsic ( embedding @-@ dependent ) measures such as the mean curvature and intrinsic measures such as the Gaussian curvature and Ricci curvature . Correspondingly , there are several ways of defining geometric flows based on curvature , including the mean curvature flow ( in which the normal speed of an embedded surface is its mean curvature ) , the Ricci flow ( an intrinsic flow on the metric of a space based on its Ricci curvature ) and the Willmore flow ( the gradient flow for an energy functional combining the mean curvature and Gaussian curvature ) . The curve @-@ shortening flow is a special case of the mean curvature flow for one @-@ dimensional curves . 
 Inspired by the curve @-@ shortening flow on smooth curves , researchers have studied methods for flowing polygons so that they stay polygonal , with applications including pattern formation and synchronization in distributed systems of robots . Length @-@ preserving polygonal flows can be used to solve the carpenter 's rule problem . 
 In computer vision , the active contour model for edge detection and image segmentation is based on curve shortening , and evolves curves based on a combination of their curvature and the features of an image . 
 = Old Pine Church = 
 Old Pine Church ( also historically known as Mill Church , Nicholas Church , and Pine Church ) is a mid @-@ 19th century church near Purgitsville , West Virginia . It is among the earliest extant log churches in Hampshire County , along with Capon Chapel and Mount Bethel Church . 
 The church was constructed in 1838 to serve as a nondenominational " union church " . As many of the Mill Creek valley 's earliest settlers were of German descent , Old Pine Church may also have been built as a meeting place for Schwarzenau Brethren adherents , known as " Dunkers " or " Dunkards " . The church is believed to have also been a meeting place for German Methodist settlers . By 1870 , the church was primarily used by the Brethren denomination , and in 1878 , the church 's congregation split into White Pine Church of the Brethren and Old Pine Church congregations . Both congregations continued to use the church until 1907 . 
 Old Pine Church reportedly housed a school in the early 20th century while still serving as a center for worship . In 1968 , residents of the Purgitsville community raised the necessary funds to perform a restoration of the church . It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 12 , 2012 , due to its " significant settlement @-@ era rural religious architecture in the Potomac Highlands . " 
 The church is a large , one @-@ story , gablefront log building sheathed in brown @-@ painted wooden German siding . The original hewn log beams are visible beneath the church , with some bark remaining on the logs . The church 's interior ceiling measures approximately 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 metres ) in height and is clad in pressed metal panels . Several of its pews date from 1857 . In the church 's adjoining cemetery , the earliest extant gravestone dates from 1834 , and several unmarked interment sites may exist from as early as 1759 . According to architectural historian Sandra Scaffidi , " Old Pine Church and cemetery is an excellent example of one of the area 's early rural church complexes . " 
 = = Location = = 
 Old Pine Church and its cemetery are located along the steeply sloped Old Pine Church Road ( West Virginia Secondary Route 220 / 15 ) , approximately 1 @.@ 66 miles ( 2 @.@ 67 kilometres ) south of the unincorporated community of Purgitsville . The church and cemetery are situated on 2 @.@ 3 acres ( 0 @.@ 93 hectares ) atop a bluff to the west of United States Route 220 , at an elevation of 1 @,@ 129 feet ( 344 metres ) . The property is surrounded by old @-@ growth forests . 
 The church is in a rural area of southwestern Hampshire County within the Mill Creek valley . Patterson Creek Mountain , a forested narrow anticlinal mountain ridge , rises to the west of Mill Creek valley , and the forested western rolling foothills of the anticlinal Mill Creek Mountain rise to the valley 's east . The Trough on the South Branch Potomac River is located across Mill Creek Mountain , approximately 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) to the east of the church . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Old Pine Church 's land tract was originally part of the Northern Neck Proprietary , a land grant that Charles II of England awarded to seven of his supporters in 1649 and renewed by an official patent in 1688 . One of these seven supporters , Thomas Colepeper , 2nd Baron Colepeper , acquired the entire area in 1681 ; his grandson , Thomas Fairfax , 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron , inherited it in 1719 . 
 The church is in the Mill Creek valley . As tensions with Native Americans were beginning to ease , Lord Fairfax sought to entice white settlers to the sparsely settled lands of his Northern Neck Proprietary . The valley was one of the first parts of present @-@ day Hampshire County to be settled by whites , beginning in the mid @-@ 18th century . Settlers were drawn by the valley 's fertility . As the valley 's population grew , the unincorporated community of Purgitsville developed along Mill Creek as a trading post village ; it was named for Henry <unk> ( or <unk> ) , who acquired 400 acres ( 160 ha ) in the Mill Creek valley on January 7 , 1785 , and received a further land transfer of 137 acres ( 55 ha ) in 1794 . Purgitsville continued to develop throughout the course of the 19th century , during which time it grew to include a small store , a post office , and a blacksmith shop .

 The dates of the earliest church cannot be verified , but a church building may have been constructed at the site of Old Pine Church as early as around 1814 , and possibly as early as 1792 . 
 On September 24 , 1838 , William <unk> and his wife , Milly , deeded a tract of land to a group of trustees , charged with constructing " a church or house for public worship for the use and convenience of Ministers and others of the Christians [ sic ] Denominations Whatsoever " . While the deed mentioned an existing meeting house on the site , there is no extant evidence of a prior structure . According to architectural historian Sandra Scaffidi , no particular Christian denomination received sole ownership of the edifice , which suggests that the church was intended to serve as a nondenominational " union church " . The church 's earliest resident minister was reportedly Nicholas Leatherman , whose wife , Elizabeth High , was the daughter of George High , one of the church 's original trustees . 
 = = = Brethren affiliation = = = 
 Few records of the church 's history exist , possibly because no single denomination or organization took ownership . Several Christian denominations held meetings at Old Pine Church , including the Schwarzenau Brethren ( or German Baptist Brethren ) , which began holding services at the church in the late 19th century . As many of the Mill Creek valley 's settlers were of German descent , the Old Pine Church structure may also have been built as a meeting place for Brethren adherents , known as " Dunkers " or " Dunkards " . It is believed that Old Pine Church was also used by German Methodists . The Brethren was a Christian denomination of Anabaptist origin that practiced baptism by triune immersion and exercised <unk> . Triune immersion consists of dipping a new believer into water three times , once for each of the entities of the Holy Trinity . Brethren adherents believed only in the New Testament , and professed no other creeds . The interior of Old Pine Church , which consists of a single common space for all worshippers , also illustrates the building 's connection with the Brethren and the denomination 's beliefs regarding slavery . According to the minutes from the 1782 meeting of the Brethren in Franklin County , Virginia , " It has been unanimously considered that it cannot be permitted in any way by the church that a member should purchase Negroes or keep them as Slaves . " While many residents in Hampshire County prior to the American Civil War were slaveholders , it is thought that Brethren adherents in the county did not own slaves or depend upon slave labor . 
 The Brethren denomination had been present in the South Branch Potomac River valley from as early as the 1750s although records of early Brethren congregations are not extant , possibly because they were served by itinerant ministers . As early as 1785 , two brothers with the surname of Powers led a Brethren congregation in the area . In Dr. Emmert F. Bittinger 's historical research on the Brethren Church in Hampshire County in his Allegheny Passage ( 1990 ) , it is noted that the Church of the Brethren denomination recognized Old Pine Church as belonging to the larger Beaver Run congregation , which was centered approximately 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of Old Pine Church . The Beaver Run congregation was the first organization of the Brethren in Hampshire County . Old Pine Church and its predecessor structures were probably utilized by members of the Beaver Run congregation because the distance between the northern region of the valley and the church on Beaver Run was too great to traverse easily . Thus , Old Pine Church began as a mission of the Beaver Run congregation . Because of its location in the vicinity of the Hardy County boundary line , the district served by the church spanned both counties . 
 By 1870 , Old Pine Church was primarily used by the Brethren denomination . Around 1870 , the Nicholas congregation of Brethren was worshiping at the church and was led by Dr. Leatherman . According to the Beaver Run Church Book , membership at Old Pine Church was 78 in 1879 and numbered 100 in 1881 . The Beaver Run congregation modified its district 's boundaries in 1879 , which may have resulted in a division of the congregation at Old Pine Church into two factions : White Pine Church of the Brethren and Old Pine Church . Both churches continued to worship at Old Pine Church at different times . White Pine Church of the Brethren worshiped at the church from the 1870s until the construction of their own church building in 1907 . By 1897 , Old Pine Church remained under collective ownership by several Christian denominations although the Brethren were the church 's largest shareholders . White Pine Church of the Brethren remained listed in the Brethren Conference Minutes as " Pine Church " until 1912 , when members of the church petitioned the Brethren Conference to change their name from " Pine " to " White Pine " . 
 Old Pine Church reportedly housed a school in the early 20th century while still serving as a center for worship . A small one @-@ room addition to the church was constructed to the north façade of the building , which served as the boarding room for the school 's teacher . The Old Pine Church also continued to be used for funeral services and reunions . 
 = = = Restoration = = = 
 In 1968 , residents of the Purgitsville community raised the necessary funds to restore Old Pine Church : the church 's original windows were repaired and the unpainted weatherboards painted ; a new roof was installed and the original wood floor replaced . The boarding room addition was probably removed ( nothing of it now remains ) and the pressed metal ceiling may have been added . 
 = = = Current use = = = 
 As of 2012 , Old Pine Church is still used for community gatherings , funeral services , revival meetings , and an annual church service . Regular church services have not taken place in the church since the middle of the 20th century . The church 's adjacent cemetery also continues to be used for burials . Throughout its existence , Old Pine Church has been known by various names , including " Mill Church " , " Nicholas Church " , and simply " Pine Church " . 
 In 2008 , the Hampshire County Historic Landmarks Commission and the Hampshire County Commission embarked upon an initiative to place structures and districts on the National Register of Historic Places following a series of surveys of historic properties throughout the county . The county received funding for the surveying and documentation of Hampshire County architecture and history from the State Historic Preservation Office of the West Virginia Division of Culture and History . Old Pine Church was one of the first eight historic properties to be considered for placement on the register as a result of the county 's initiative . The other seven properties were : Capon Chapel , Fort Kuykendall , Hickory Grove , Hook Tavern , North River Mills Historic District , Springfield Brick House , and Valley View . According to Hampshire County Commission 's compliance officer , Charles Baker , places of worship were not typically selected for inclusion in the register ; Old Pine Church and Capon Chapel were exceptions because both " started out as meeting houses " . Old Pine Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 12 , 2012 , because of its " significant settlement @-@ era rural religious architecture in the Potomac Highlands " .

 Old Pine Church is a large , one @-@ story , gablefront log building . Its symmetrical front façade faces west and encompasses a main entrance consisting of a double set of four @-@ paneled doors . The main entrance is reached by two concrete steps , on either side of which is a modern metal handrail . Above the entrance is a small wooden sign painted white reading " Old Pine Church " in black lettering . On either side of the doors are two nine @-@ over @-@ six double @-@ hung sash wooden windows . 
 Placed symmetrically in the north and south sides of the church are two nine @-@ over @-@ six double @-@ hung sash wooden windows . Between the two windows on the church 's north elevation is an exterior concrete block chimney . The layout of the east @-@ facing rear elevation of the church is also symmetrical , and features three nine @-@ over @-@ six double @-@ hung sash wooden windows , with the center window placed above and between the other two windows . The church 's windows have been repaired using materials consistent with original construction . 
 At the base of each of the church 's four corners is a large uncut stone pier . <unk> span the church 's perimeter foundations , which were added at a later date to discourage intrusion by animals . The original hewn log beams , still retaining bark , can be seen under the church . The church is covered with brown @-@ painted wooden German siding and is crowned by a modern standing @-@ seam metal roof . 
 Architectural historian Sandra Scaffidi states that the simple form and construction of Old Pine Church are indicative of the early settlers ' access to materials and are an example of the log construction techniques used in the religious architecture of Hampshire County 's earliest settlers . She adds that Old Pine Church is representative of a " simple design and form common to the early ecclesiastical buildings " and an " excellent example of one of the area 's early rural church complexes " . 
 = = = Church interior = = = 
 The church 's interior exhibits an open architectural plan . A plain wooden frame pulpit stands against the rear wall , underneath the middle window . The church 's floor consists of pine boards installed during the church 's 1968 restoration . 
 The church 's ceiling , measuring approximately 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) in height , is clad in pressed metal panels . A small opening allows for access to the church 's attic . The unadorned window wells measure approximately 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) . The interior walls are covered in plasterboard , which remains unfinished . 
 The church 's small wood @-@ burning stove originally occupied the center of the sanctuary but was moved to the church 's north wall in later years . It continues to serve as the church 's sole source of heat . 
 Several of the church 's pews date from 1857 and remain in use . The pews , quite simple in form , have a " minimalist appearance " . Each pew consists of a long wooden plank that serves as the seat , with a thin rail supported by three spindles as the backrest . The pews are supported by three arched supports joined to the seat by a mortise and tenon joint and reinforced with nails . The newer pews exhibit identical design elements but are constructed with modern nails and timber . Though most of the pews are arranged against the church 's west elevation with a center aisle , two are along the north elevation and four are along the south elevation . The pulpit is situated at the east elevation . There is an upright piano in the northeastern corner of the church . 
 = = Cemetery = = 
 Old Pine Church is surrounded on three sides by a cemetery containing approximately 200 interments , the oldest section of which is located to the immediate east and south of the church building . The earliest remaining gravestone dates from 1834 , but several unmarked interment sites in the surrounding cemetery may date from as early as 1759 . The church 's sign along U.S. Route 220 erroneously lists the date of the cemetery 's oldest interment sites as 1792 . 
 The cemetery 's headstones are oriented both to the east and to the west . The majority are simple in design , inscribed with birth and death dates , and consist of a combination of rounded , arched stones , rectangular stones , and pyramidal @-@ shaped obelisks that appear to be cut from limestone . In the cemetery 's southern section are several small rectangular stones that probably serve as <unk> . Beginning around 1950 , the gravestones erected in the cemetery became more intricate with polished granite surfaces lying atop rough @-@ cut stone foundations . 
 Old Pine Church 's cemetery is surrounded by several mature trees , with a large oak tree overhanging the southwestern area of the cemetery . Outside of the National Register of Historic Places boundary to the northwest of Old Pine Church lies a second parcel of land acquired around 1950 for additional burials . The cemetery is enclosed by a chicken wire fence supported by wooden posts , with a large gate to the north of the church which allows machinery access into the cemetery . 
 = Winter Olympic Games = 
 The Winter Olympic Games ( French : Jeux olympiques d 'hiver ) is a major international sporting event that occurs once every four years . Unlike the Summer Olympics , the Winter Olympics feature sports practiced on snow and ice . The first Winter Olympics , the 1924 Winter Olympics , was held in Chamonix , France . The original five sports ( broken into nine disciplines ) were bobsleigh , curling , ice hockey , Nordic skiing ( consisting of the disciplines military patrol , cross @-@ country skiing , Nordic combined , and ski jumping ) , and skating ( consisting of the disciplines figure skating and speed skating ) . The Games were held every four years from 1924 until 1936 , after which they were interrupted by World War II . The Olympics resumed in 1948 and was again held every four years . Until 1992 , the Winter and Summer Olympic Games were held in the same years , but in accordance with a 1986 decision by the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) to place the Summer and Winter Games on separate four @-@ year cycles in alternating even @-@ numbered years , the next Winter Olympics after 1992 was in 1994 . 
 The Winter Games have evolved since its inception . Sports and disciplines have been added and some of them , such as Alpine skiing , luge , short track speed skating , freestyle skiing , skeleton , and snowboarding , have earned a permanent spot on the Olympic program . Others ( such as curling and bobsleigh ) have been discontinued and later reintroduced , or have been permanently discontinued ( such as military patrol , though the modern Winter Olympic sport of biathlon is descended from it ) . Still others , such as speed skiing , bandy and skijoring , were demonstration sports but never incorporated as Olympic sports . The rise of television as a global medium for communication enhanced the profile of the Games . It created an income stream , via the sale of broadcast rights and advertising , which has become lucrative for the IOC . This allowed outside interests , such as television companies and corporate sponsors , to exert influence . The IOC has had to address several criticisms , internal scandals , the use of performance @-@ enhancing drugs by Winter Olympians , as well as a political boycott of the Winter Olympics . Nations have used the Winter Games to showcase the claimed superiority of their political systems . 
 The Winter Olympics has been hosted on three continents by eleven different countries . The United States has hosted the Games four times ( 1932 , 1960 , 1980 , 2002 ) ; France has been the host three times ( 1924 , 1968 , 1992 ) ; Austria ( 1964 , 1976 ) , Canada ( 1988 , 2010 ) , Japan ( 1972 , 1998 ) , Italy ( 1956 , 2006 ) , Norway ( 1952 , 1994 ) , and Switzerland ( 1928 , 1948 ) have hosted the Games twice . Germany ( 1936 ) , Yugoslavia ( 1984 ) , and Russia ( 2014 ) have hosted the Games once . The IOC has selected Pyeongchang , South Korea , to host the 2018 Winter Olympics and Beijing , China , to host the 2022 Winter Olympics . No country in the southern hemisphere has hosted or even been an applicant to host the Winter Olympics ; the major challenge preventing one hosting the games is the dependence on winter weather , and the traditional February timing of the games falls in the middle of the southern hemisphere summer . 
 Twelve countries – Austria , Canada , Finland , France , Great Britain , Hungary , Italy , Norway , Poland , Sweden , Switzerland and the United States – have sent athletes to every Winter Olympic Games . Six of those – Austria , Canada , Finland , Norway , Sweden and the United States – have earned medals at every Winter Olympic Games , and only one – the United States – has earned gold at each Games . Germany and Japan have been banned at times from competing in the Games . 
 = = Sports = = 
 The Olympic Charter limits winter sports to " those ... which are practised on snow or ice . " Since 1992 a number of new sports have been added to the Olympic programme ; which include short track speed skating , snowboarding , freestyle and moguls skiing . The addition of these events has broadened the appeal of the Winter Olympics beyond Europe and North America . While European powers such as Norway and Germany still dominate the traditional Winter Olympic sports , countries such as South Korea , Australia and Canada are finding success in the new sports . The results are more parity in the national medal tables , more interest in the Winter Olympics and higher global television ratings .

 Demonstration sports have historically provided a venue for host countries to attract publicity to locally popular sports by having a competition without granting medals . Demonstration sports were discontinued after 1992 . Military patrol , a precursor to the biathlon , was a medal sport in 1924 and was demonstrated in 1928 , 1936 and 1948 , becoming an official sport in 1960 . The special figures figure skating event was only contested at the 1908 Summer Olympics . Bandy ( Russian hockey ) is a sport popular in the Nordic countries and Russia . In the latter it 's considered a national sport . It was demonstrated at the Oslo Games . Ice stock sport , a German variant of curling , was demonstrated in 1936 in Germany and 1964 in Austria . The ski ballet event , later known as ski @-@ acro , was demonstrated in 1988 and 1992 . <unk> , skiing behind dogs , was a demonstration sport in St. Moritz in 1928 . A sled @-@ dog race was held at Lake Placid in 1932 . Speed skiing was demonstrated in Albertville at the 1992 Winter Olympics . Winter pentathlon , a variant of the modern pentathlon , was included as a demonstration event at the 1948 Games in Switzerland . It was composed of cross @-@ country skiing , shooting , downhill skiing , fencing and horse riding .

 A predecessor , the Nordic Games , were organized by General Viktor Gustaf Balck in 1901 and were held again in 1903 and 1905 and then every fourth year thereafter until 1926 . Balck was a charter member of the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and a close friend of Olympic Games founder Pierre de Coubertin . He attempted to have winter sports , specifically figure skating , added to the Olympic program but was unsuccessful until the 1908 Summer Olympics in London , United Kingdom . Four figure skating events were contested , at which Ulrich Salchow ( 10 @-@ time world champion ) and Madge Syers won the individual titles . 
 Three years later , Italian count Eugenio <unk> d <unk> proposed that the IOC stage a week of winter sports included as part of the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm , Sweden . The organizers opposed this idea because they desired to protect the integrity of the Nordic Games and were concerned about a lack of facilities for winter sports . The idea was resurrected for the 1916 Games , which were to be held in Berlin , Germany . A winter sports week with speed skating , figure skating , ice hockey and Nordic skiing was planned , but the 1916 Olympics was cancelled after the outbreak of World War I. 
 The first Olympics after the war , the 1920 Summer Olympics , were held in Antwerp , Belgium , and featured figure skating and an ice hockey tournament . Germany , Austria , Hungary , Bulgaria and Turkey were banned from competing in the Games . At the IOC Congress held the following year it was decided that the host nation of the 1924 Summer Olympics , France , would host a separate " International Winter Sports Week " under the patronage of the IOC . Chamonix was chosen to host this " week " ( actually 11 days ) of events . The Games proved to be a success when more than 250 athletes from 16 nations competed in 16 events . Athletes from Finland and Norway won 28 medals , more than the rest of the participating nations combined . Germany remained banned until 1925 , and instead hosted a series of games called Deutsche <unk> , starting with the Winter edition of 1922 ( which predated the first Winter Olympics ) . In 1925 the IOC decided to create a separate Olympic Winter Games and the 1924 Games in Chamonix was retroactively designated as the first Winter Olympics . 
 St. Moritz , Switzerland , was appointed by the IOC to host the second Olympic Winter Games in 1928 . Fluctuating weather conditions challenged the hosts . The opening ceremony was held in a blizzard while warm weather conditions plagued sporting events throughout the rest of the Games . Because of the weather the 10 @,@ 000 metre speed @-@ skating event had to be abandoned and officially cancelled . The weather was not the only noteworthy aspect of the 1928 Games : Sonja Henie of Norway made history when she won the figure skating competition at the age of 15 . She became the youngest Olympic champion in history , a distinction she would hold for 74 years . 
 The next Winter Olympics was the first to be hosted outside of Europe . Seventeen nations and 252 athletes participated . This was less than in 1928 as the journey to Lake Placid , United States , was a long and expensive one for most competitors who had little money in the midst of the Great Depression . The athletes competed in fourteen events in four sports . Virtually no snow fell for two months before the Games , and it was not until mid @-@ January that there was enough snow to hold all the events . Sonja Henie defended her Olympic title and Eddie Eagan , who had been an Olympic champion in boxing in 1920 , won the gold in the men 's bobsleigh event to become the first , and so far only , Olympian to have won gold medals in both the Summer and Winter Olympics . 
 The German towns of Garmisch and Partenkirchen joined to organise the 1936 edition of the Winter Games , held on 6 – 16 February . This would be the last time the Summer and Winter Olympics were held in the same country in the same year . Alpine skiing made its Olympic debut , but skiing teachers were barred from entering because they were considered to be professionals . Because of this decision the Swiss and Austrian skiers refused to compete at the Games .

 World War II interrupted the celebrations of the Winter Olympics . The 1940 Games had been awarded to Sapporo , Japan , but the decision was rescinded in 1938 because of the Japanese invasion of China . The Games were moved to Garmisch @-@ Partenkirchen , Germany , but the German invasion of Poland in 1939 forced the complete cancellation of the 1940 Games . Due to the ongoing war the 1944 Games , originally scheduled for Cortina D 'Ampezzo , Italy , were cancelled .

 St. Moritz was selected to host the first post @-@ war Games in 1948 . Switzerland 's neutrality had protected the town during World War II and most of the venues were in place from the 1928 Games , which made St. Moritz a logical choice . It became the first city to host a Winter Olympics twice . Twenty @-@ eight countries competed in Switzerland , but athletes from Germany and Japan were not invited . Controversy erupted when two hockey teams from the United States arrived , both claiming to be the legitimate U.S. Olympic hockey representative . The Olympic flag presented at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp was stolen , as was its replacement . There was unprecedented parity at these Games , during which 10 countries won gold medals — more than any Games to that point . 
 The Olympic Flame for the 1952 Games in Oslo , was lit in the fireplace by skiing pioneer Sondre Nordheim and the torch relay was conducted by 94 participants entirely on skis . Bandy , a popular sport in the Nordic countries , was featured as a demonstration sport , though only Norway , Sweden and Finland fielded teams . Norwegian athletes won 17 medals , which outpaced all the other nations . They were led by Hjalmar Andersen who won three gold medals in four events in the speed skating competition . 
 After not being able to host the Games in 1944 , Cortina d 'Ampezzo was selected to organise the 1956 Winter Olympics . At the opening ceremonies the final torch bearer , Guido Caroli , entered the Olympic Stadium on ice skates . As he skated around the stadium his skate caught on a cable and he fell , nearly extinguishing the flame . He was able to recover and light the cauldron . These were the first Winter Games to be televised and the first Olympics ever broadcast nationwide , though no television rights would be sold until the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome . The Cortina Games were used to test the feasibility of televising large sporting events . The Soviet Union made its Olympic debut and had an immediate impact , winning more medals than any other nation . Chiharu <unk> won the first Winter Olympics medal for Japan and the continent of Asia , when he placed second in the slalom . 
 The IOC awarded the 1960 Olympics to Squaw Valley , United States . Since the village was underdeveloped , there was a rush to construct infrastructure and sports facilities like an ice arena , speed @-@ skating track , and a ski @-@ jump hill . The opening and closing ceremonies were produced by Walt Disney . The Squaw Valley Olympics had a number of notable firsts : it was the first Olympics to have a dedicated athletes ' village , it was the first to use a computer ( courtesy of IBM ) to tabulate results , and the first to feature female speed skating events . The bobsleigh events were absent for the only time , because the organising committee found it too expensive to build the bobsleigh run .

 The Austrian city of Innsbruck was the host in 1964 . Although Innsbruck was a traditional winter sports resort , warm weather caused a lack of snow during the Games and the Austrian army was asked to transport snow and ice to the sport venues . Soviet speed @-@ skater Lidia Skoblikova made history by sweeping all four speed @-@ skating events . Her career total of six gold medals set a record for Winter Olympics athletes . Luge was first contested in 1964 , although the sport received bad publicity when a competitor was killed in a pre @-@ Olympic training run . 
 Held in the French town of Grenoble , the 1968 Winter Olympics were the first Olympic Games to be broadcast in colour . There were 37 nations and 1 @,@ 158 athletes competing in 35 events . Frenchman Jean @-@ Claude Killy became only the second person to win all the men 's alpine skiing events . The organising committee sold television rights for $ 2 million , which was more than double the price of the broadcast rights for the Innsbruck Games . Venues were spread over long distances requiring three athletes ' villages . The organisers claimed this was required to accommodate technological advances . Critics disputed this , alleging that the layout was necessary to provide the best possible venues for television broadcasts at the expense of the athletes . 
 The 1972 Winter Games , held in Sapporo , Japan , were the first to be hosted outside North America or Europe . The issue of professionalism became contentious during the Sapporo Games . Three days before the Games IOC president Avery Brundage threatened to bar a number of alpine skiers from competing because they participated in a ski camp at Mammoth Mountain in the United States . Brundage reasoned that the skiers had financially benefited from their status as athletes and were therefore no longer amateurs . Eventually only Austrian Karl <unk> , who earned more than all the other skiers , was not allowed to compete . Canada did not send teams to the 1972 or 1976 ice hockey tournaments in protest of their inability to use players from professional leagues . Francisco Fernández Ochoa became the first ( and only ) Spaniard to win a Winter Olympic gold medal ; he triumphed in the slalom . 
 The 1976 Winter Olympics had been awarded in 1970 to Denver , United States , but in November 1972 the voters of the state of Colorado voted against public funding of the games by a 3 to 2 margin . The IOC turned to offer the Games to Vancouver @-@ Garibaldi , British Columbia , which had been a candidate for the 1976 Games . However , a change in provincial government brought in an administration which did not support the Olympic bid , so the offer was rejected . Salt Lake City , a candidate for the 1972 Games , offered itself , but the IOC opted to ask Innsbruck , which had maintained most of the infrastructure from the 1964 Games . With half the time to prepare for the Games as intended , Innsbruck accepted the invitation to replace Denver in February 1973 . Two Olympic flames were lit because it was the second time the Austrian town had hosted the Games . The 1976 Games featured the first combination bobsleigh and luge track , in neighbouring Igls . The Soviet Union won its fourth consecutive ice hockey gold medal . 
 In 1980 the Olympics returned to Lake Placid , which had hosted the 1932 Games . The first boycott of a Winter Olympics occurred in 1980 when Taiwan refused to participate after an edict by the IOC mandated that they change their name and national anthem . The IOC was attempting to accommodate China , who wished to compete using the same name and anthem that had been used by Taiwan . American speed @-@ skater Eric Heiden set either an Olympic or world record in each of the five events he competed in . Hanni Wenzel won both the slalom and giant slalom and her country , Liechtenstein , became the smallest nation to produce an Olympic gold medallist . In the " Miracle on Ice " the American hockey team beat the favoured Soviets , and then went on to win the gold medal .

 Sapporo , Japan , and Gothenburg , Sweden , were front @-@ runners to host the 1984 Winter Olympics . It was therefore a surprise when Sarajevo , Yugoslavia , was selected as host . The Games were well @-@ organised and displayed no indication of the war that would engulf the country eight years later . A total of 49 nations and 1 @,@ 272 athletes participated in 39 events . Host nation Yugoslavia won its first Olympic medal when alpine skier Jure Franko won a silver in the giant slalom . Another sporting highlight was the free dance performance of British ice dancers Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean . Their performance to Ravel 's Boléro earned the pair the gold medal after achieving unanimous perfect scores for artistic impression . 
 In 1988 , the Canadian city of Calgary hosted the first Winter Olympics to span 16 days . New events were added in ski @-@ jumping and speed skating ; while future Olympic sports curling , short track speed skating and freestyle skiing made their appearance as demonstration sports . For the first time the speed skating events were held indoors , on the Olympic Oval . Dutch skater Yvonne van Gennip won three gold medals and set two world records , beating skaters from the favoured East German team in every race . Her medal total was equalled by Finnish ski jumper Matti Nykänen , who won all three events in his sport . Alberto <unk> , an Italian skier , made his Olympic debut by winning both the giant slalom and slalom . East German Christa <unk> won the women 's 1 @,@ 000 metre speed skating event . Seven months later she would earn a silver in track cycling at the Summer Games in Seoul , to become the only athlete to win medals in both a Summer and Winter Olympics in the same year . 
 The 1992 Games were the last to be held in the same year as the Summer Games . They were hosted in the French Savoie region in the city of Albertville , though only 18 events were held in the city . The rest of the events were spread out over the Savoie . Political changes of the time were reflected in the Olympic teams appearing in France : this was the first Games to be held after the fall of Communism and the dismantling of the Berlin Wall , and Germany competed as a single nation for the first time since the 1964 Games ; former Yugoslavian republics Croatia and Slovenia made their debuts as independent nations ; most of the former Soviet republics still competed as a single team known as the Unified Team , but the Baltic States made independent appearances for the first time since before World War II . At 16 years old , Finnish ski jumper Toni Nieminen made history by becoming the youngest male Winter Olympic champion . New Zealand skier Annelise <unk> became the first Winter Olympic medallist from the southern hemisphere when she won a silver medal in the women 's slalom . 
 In 1986 the IOC had voted to separate the Summer and Winter Games and place them in alternating even @-@ numbered years . This change became effective for the 1994 Games , held in Lillehammer , Norway , which became the first Winter Olympics to be held separate from the Summer Games . After the division of Czechoslovakia in 1993 the Czech Republic and Slovakia made their Olympic debuts . The women 's figure skating competition garnered media attention when American skater Nancy Kerrigan was injured on 6 January 1994 , in an assault planned by the ex @-@ husband of opponent Tonya Harding . Both skaters competed in the Games , but the gold medal was won by Oksana <unk> . She became Ukraine 's first Olympic champion . Johann Olav Koss of Norway won three gold medals , coming first in all of the distance speed skating events . 
 The 1998 Winter Olympics were held in the Japanese city of Nagano and were the first Games to host more than 2 @,@ 000 athletes . The men 's ice hockey tournament was opened to professionals for the first time . Canada and the United States , with their many NHL players , were favoured to win the tournament . Neither won any hockey medals however , as the Czech Republic prevailed . Women 's ice hockey made its debut and the United States won the gold medal . Bjørn <unk> of Norway won three gold medals in Nordic skiing . He became the most decorated Winter Olympic athlete with eight gold medals and twelve medals overall . Austrian Hermann Maier survived a crash during the downhill competition and returned to win gold in the super @-@ g and the giant slalom . A wave of new world records were set in speed skating because of the introduction of the clap skate . 
 = = = 2002 to 2010 = = = 
 The 2002 Winter Olympics were held in Salt Lake City , United States , hosting 77 nations and 2 @,@ 399 athletes in 78 events in 7 sports . These games were the first to take place since 11 September 2001 , which meant a higher degree of security to avoid a terrorist attack . The opening ceremonies of the games saw signs of the aftermath of the events of that day , including the flag that flew at Ground Zero , NYPD officer Daniel Rodríguez singing " God Bless America " , and honor guards of NYPD and FDNY members . 
 German Georg Hackl won a silver in the singles luge , becoming the first athlete in Olympic history to win medals in the same individual event in five consecutive Olympics . Canada achieved an unprecedented double by winning both the men 's and women 's ice hockey gold medals . Canada became embroiled with Russia in a controversy that involved the judging of the pairs figure skating competition . The Russian pair of Yelena <unk> and Anton <unk> competed against the Canadian pair of Jamie Salé and David Pelletier for the gold medal . The Canadians appeared to have skated well enough to win the competition , yet the Russians were awarded the gold . The judging broke along Cold War lines with judges from former Communist countries favouring the Russian pair and judges from Western nations voting for the Canadians . The only exception was the French judge , Marie @-@ Reine Le <unk> , who awarded the gold to the Russians . An investigation revealed that she had been pressured to give the gold to the Russian pair regardless of how they skated ; in return the Russian judge would look favourably on the French entrants in the ice dancing competition . The IOC decided to award both pairs the gold medal in a second medal ceremony held later in the Games . Australian Steven Bradbury became the first gold medallist from the southern hemisphere when he won the 1 @,@ 000 metre short @-@ track speed skating event . 
 The Italian city of Turin hosted the 2006 Winter Olympics . It was the second time that Italy had hosted the Winter Olympic Games . South Korean athletes won 10 medals , including 6 gold in the short @-@ track speed skating events . Sun @-@ Yu Jin won three gold medals while her teammate Hyun @-@ Soo Ahn won three gold medals and a bronze . In the women 's Cross @-@ Country team pursuit Canadian Sara Renner broke one of her poles and , when he saw her dilemma , Norwegian coach <unk> <unk> decided to lend her a pole . In so doing she was able to help her team win a silver medal in the event at the expense of the Norwegian team , who finished fourth . Claudia Pechstein of Germany became the first speed skater to earn nine career medals . In February 2009 Pechstein tested positive for " blood manipulation " and received a two @-@ year suspension , which she appealed . The Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld her suspension but a Swiss court ruled that she could compete for a spot on the 2010 German Olympic team . This ruling was brought to the Swiss Federal Tribunal , which overturned the lower court 's ruling and precluded her from competing in Vancouver . 
 In 2003 the IOC awarded the 2010 Winter Olympics to Vancouver , thus allowing Canada to host its second Winter Olympics . With a population of more than 2 @.@ 5 million people Vancouver is the largest metropolitan area to ever host a Winter Olympic Games . Over 2 @,@ 500 athletes from 82 countries participated in 86 events . The death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili in a training run on the day of the opening ceremonies resulted in the Whistler Sliding Centre changing the track layout on safety grounds . Norwegian cross @-@ country skier Marit <unk> won five medals in the six cross @-@ country events on the women 's programme . She finished the Olympics with three golds , a silver and a bronze . The Vancouver Games were notable for the poor performance of the Russian athletes . From their first Winter Olympics in 1956 to the 2006 games , a Soviet or Russian delegation had never been outside the top five medal @-@ winning nations . In 2010 they finished sixth in total medals and eleventh in gold medals . President Dmitry Medvedev called for the resignation of top sports officials immediately after the Games . The success of Asian countries stood in stark contrast to the under @-@ performing Russian team , with Vancouver marking a high point for medals won by Asian countries . In 1992 the Asian countries had won fifteen medals , three of which were gold . In Vancouver the total number of medals won by athletes from Asia had increased to thirty @-@ one , with eleven of them being gold . The rise of Asian nations in Winter Olympics sports is due in part to the growth of winter sports programmes and the interest in winter sports in nations such as South Korea , Japan and China . 
 = = = 2014 = = = 
 Sochi , Russia , was selected as the host city of the 2014 Winter Olympics over Salzburg , Austria , and Pyeongchang , South Korea . This was the first time since the breakup of the Soviet Union that Russia hosted a Winter Olympics . Over 2800 athletes from 88 countries participated in 98 events . The Olympic Village and Olympic Stadium were located on the Black Sea coast . All of the mountain venues were 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) away in the alpine region known as Krasnaya Polyana . 
 The 2014 Winter Olympics , officially the XXII Olympic Winter Games , or the 22nd Winter Olympics , took place from 7 to 23 February 2014 . 
 = = = Future = = = 
 On 6 July 2011 , the IOC selected the city of Pyeongchang , South Korea to host the 2018 Winter Olympics . 
 The host city for the XXIV Olympic Winter Games , also known as the 2022 Winter Olympics , is Beijing , elected on 31 July 2015 , at the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur . Beijing will be the first city to host both the summer and winter <unk> . 
 = = Controversy = = 
 The process for awarding host city honours came under intense scrutiny after Salt Lake City had been awarded the right to host the 2002 Games . Soon after the host city had been announced it was discovered that the organisers had engaged in an elaborate bribery scheme to curry favour with IOC officials . Gifts and other financial considerations were given to those who would evaluate and vote on Salt Lake City 's bid . These gifts included medical treatment for relatives , a college scholarship for one member 's son and a land deal in Utah . Even IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch received two rifles valued at $ 2 @,@ 000 . Samaranch defended the gift as inconsequential since , as president , he was a non @-@ voting member . The subsequent investigation uncovered inconsistencies in the bids for every Games ( both summer and winter ) since 1988 . For example , the gifts received by IOC members from the Japanese Organising Committee for Nagano 's bid for the 1998 Winter Olympics were described by the investigation committee as " astronomical " . Although nothing strictly illegal had been done , the IOC feared that corporate sponsors would lose faith in the integrity of the process and that the Olympic brand would be tarnished to such an extent that advertisers would begin to pull their support . The investigation resulted in the expulsion of 10 IOC members and the sanctioning of another 10 . New terms and age limits were established for IOC membership , and 15 former Olympic athletes were added to the committee . Stricter rules for future bids were imposed , with ceilings imposed on the value of gifts IOC members could accept from bid cities . 
 = = = Host city legacy = = = 
 According to the IOC , the host city is responsible for , " ... establishing functions and services for all aspects of the Games , such as sports planning , venues , finance , technology , accommodation , catering , media services etc . , as well as operations during the Games . " Due to the cost of hosting an Olympic Games , most host cities never realise a profit on their investment . For example , the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano , Japan , cost $ 12 @.@ 5 billion . By comparison the Torino Games of 2006 cost $ 3 @.@ 6 billion to host . The organisers claimed that the cost of extending the bullet train service from Tokyo to Nagano was responsible for the large price tag . The organising committee hoped that the exposure of the Olympic Games , and the expedited access to Nagano from Tokyo , would be a boon to the local economy for years afterward . Nagano 's economy did experience a two @-@ year post @-@ Olympic spurt , but the long @-@ term effects have not materialised as planned . The possibility of heavy debt , coupled with unused sports venues and infrastructure that saddle the local community with upkeep costs and no practical post @-@ Olympic value , is a deterrent to prospective host cities . 
 To mitigate these concerns the IOC has enacted several initiatives . First it has agreed to fund part of the host city 's budget for staging the Games . Secondly , the IOC limits the qualifying host countries to those that have the resources and infrastructure to successfully host an Olympic Games without negatively impacting the region or nation . This eliminates a large portion of the developing world . Finally , cities bidding to host the Games are required to add a " legacy plan " to their proposal . This requires prospective host cities and the IOC , to plan with a view to the long @-@ term economic and environmental impact that hosting the Olympics will have on the region . 
 = = = Doping = = = 
 In 1967 the IOC began enacting drug testing protocols . They started by randomly testing athletes at the 1968 Winter Olympics . The first Winter Games athlete to test positive for a banned substance was Alois <unk> , a West German hockey player , but his team was still allowed to compete . During the 1970s testing outside of competition was escalated because it was found to deter athletes from using performance @-@ enhancing drugs . The problem with testing during this time was a lack of standardisation of the test procedures , which undermined the credibility of the tests . It was not until the late 1980s that international sporting federations began to coordinate efforts to standardise the drug @-@ testing protocols . The IOC took the lead in the fight against steroids when it established the independent World Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( WADA ) in November 1999 . 
 The 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin became notable for a scandal involving the emerging trend of blood doping , the use of blood transfusions or synthetic hormones such as <unk> ( EPO ) to improve oxygen flow and thus reduce fatigue . The Italian police conducted a raid on the Austrian cross @-@ country ski team 's residence during the Games where they seized blood @-@ doping specimens and equipment . This event followed the pre @-@ Olympics suspension of 12 cross @-@ country skiers who tested positive for unusually high levels of hemoglobin , which is evidence of blood doping . 
 = = = Commercialisation = = = 
 Avery Brundage , as president of the IOC from 1952 to 1972 , rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interests as he felt that the Olympic movement should be completely separate from financial influence . The 1960 Winter Olympics marked the beginning of corporate sponsorship of the Games . Despite Brundage 's strenuous resistance the commercialisation of the Games continued during the 1960s , and revenue generated by corporate sponsorship swelled the IOC 's coffers . By the Grenoble Games , Brundage had become so concerned about the direction of the Winter Olympic Games towards commercialisation that , if it could not be corrected , he felt the Winter Olympics should be abolished . Brundage 's resistance to this revenue stream meant that the IOC was unable to gain a share of the financial windfall that was coming to host cities , and had no control over the structuring of sponsorship deals . When Brundage retired the IOC had $ 2 million in assets ; eight years later its accounts had swelled to $ 45 million . This was due to a shift in ideology among IOC members , towards expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights . 
 Brundage 's concerns proved prophetic . The IOC has charged more for television broadcast rights at each successive Games . At the 1998 Nagano Games American broadcaster CBS paid $ 375 million , whereas the 2006 Turin Games cost NBC $ 613 million to broadcast . The more television companies have paid to televise the Games , the greater their persuasive power has been with the IOC . For example , the television lobby has influenced the Olympic programme by dictating when event finals are held , so that they appear in prime time for television audiences . They have pressured the IOC to include new events , such as snowboarding , that appeal to broader television audiences . This has been done to boost ratings , which were slowly declining until the 2010 Games . 
 In 1986 the IOC decided to stagger the Summer and Winter Games . Instead of holding both in the same calendar year the committee decided to alternate them every two years , although both Games would still be held on four @-@ year cycles . It was decided that 1992 would be the last year to have both a Winter and Summer Olympic Games . There were two underlying reasons for this change : first was the television lobby 's desire to maximise advertising revenue as it was difficult to sell advertising time for two Games in the same year ; second was the IOC 's desire to gain more control over the revenue generated by the Games . It was decided that staggering the Games would make it easier for corporations to sponsor individual Olympic Games , which would maximise revenue potential . The IOC sought to directly negotiate sponsorship contracts so that they had more control over the Olympic " brand " . The first Winter Olympics to be hosted in this new format were the 1994 Games in Lillehammer . 
 = = Politics = = 
 = = = Cold War = = = 
 The Winter Olympics have been an ideological front in the Cold War since the Soviet Union first participated at the 1956 Winter Games . It did not take long for the Cold War combatants to discover what a powerful propaganda tool the Olympic Games could be . Soviet and American politicians used the Olympics as an opportunity to demonstrate the superiority of their respective political systems . The successful Soviet athlete was feted and honoured . Irina <unk> , three @-@ time Olympic gold medallist in figure skating , was awarded the Order of Lenin after her victory at the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck . Soviet athletes who won gold medals could expect to receive between $ 4 @,@ 000 and $ 8 @,@ 000 depending on the prestige of the sport . A world record was worth an additional $ 1 @,@ 500 . In 1978 the United States Congress responded to these measures by passing legislation that reorganised the United States Olympic Committee . It also approved financial rewards to medal @-@ winning athletes . 
 The Cold War created tensions amongst countries allied to the two superpowers . The strained relationship between East and West Germany created a difficult political situation for the IOC . Because of its role in World War II , Germany was not allowed to compete at the 1948 Winter Olympics . In 1950 the IOC recognised the West German Olympic Committee , and invited East and West Germany to compete as a unified team at the 1952 Winter Games . East Germany declined the invitation and instead sought international legitimacy separate from West Germany . In 1955 the Soviet Union recognised East Germany as a sovereign state , thereby giving more credibility to East Germany 's campaign to become an independent participant at the Olympics . The IOC agreed to provisionally accept the East German National Olympic Committee with the condition that East and West Germans compete on one team . The situation became tenuous when the Berlin Wall was constructed in 1962 and western nations began refusing visas to East German athletes . The uneasy compromise of a unified team held until the 1968 Grenoble Games when the IOC officially split the teams and threatened to reject the host @-@ city bids of any country that refused entry visas to East German athletes . 
 = = = Boycott = = = 
 The Winter Games have had only one national team boycott when Taiwan decided not to participate in the 1980 Winter Olympics held in Lake Placid . Prior to the Games the IOC agreed to allow China to compete in the Olympics for the first time since 1952 . China was given permission to compete as the " People 's Republic of China " ( PRC ) and to use the PRC flag and anthem . Until 1980 the island of Taiwan had been competing under the name " Republic of China " ( ROC ) and had been using the ROC flag and anthem . The IOC attempted to have the countries compete together but when this proved to be unacceptable the IOC demanded that Taiwan cease to call itself the " Republic of China " . The IOC renamed the island " Chinese Taipei " and demanded that it adopt a different flag and national anthem , stipulations that Taiwan would not agree to . Despite numerous appeals and court hearings the IOC 's decision stood . When the Taiwanese athletes arrived at the Olympic village with their Republic of China identification cards they were not admitted . They subsequently left the Olympics in protest , just before the opening ceremonies . Taiwan returned to Olympic competition at the 1984 Winter Games in Sarajevo as Chinese Taipei . The country agreed to compete under a flag bearing the emblem of their National Olympic Committee and to play the anthem of their National Olympic Committee should one of their athletes win a gold medal . The agreement remains in place to this day .

 = Presidio of Santa Barbara = 
 El Presidio Real de Santa Bárbara , also known as the Royal Presidio of Santa Barbara , is a former military installation in Santa Barbara , California , USA . The presidio was built by Spain in 1782 , with the mission of defending the Second Military District in California . In modern times , the Presidio serves as a significant tourist attraction , museum and an active archaeological site as part of El Presidio de Santa Barbara State Historic Park . 
 The park contains an original adobe structure called El Cuartel , which is the second oldest surviving building in California , only the chapel at Mission San Juan Capistrano , known as " Father Serra 's Church " , is older . The Presidio of Santa Barbara has the distinction of being the last military outpost built by Spain in the New World . The Presidio became a California Historical Landmark in 1958 and was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1973 . 
 = = Contemporary setting = = 
 The current El Presidio de Santa Barbara State Historic Park site sits between Anacapa and Garden Street on East Canon Perdido Street in downtown Santa Barbara . The main portion of the site is across the street from the Santa Barbara city Post Office , and is about two blocks from city hall , De la Guerra Plaza and two other museums , the Santa Barbara Historical Museum and the Casa de la Guerra . 
 Only two portions of the original presidio quadrangle survive to this day : the Cañedo Adobe , named for José María Cañedo , the Soldado de <unk> to whom it was deeded in lieu of back pay when the Presidio fell to inactivity , and the remnants of a two @-@ room soldiers quarters , called El Cuartel . The Cañedo Adobe is currently the visitor ’ s center for the state park , and El Cuartel is largely unmodified . The site ’ s operator , the Santa Barbara Trust for Historic Preservation ( SBTHP ) , reconstructed the rest of the site , with the most recent construction — two rooms in the northwest corner of the site — finished in May 2006 . The reconstruction is ongoing , with the construction of two more rooms in the northwest corner beginning in December 2007 . 
 = = History = = 
 The site of the Presidio was chosen by Felipe de Neve , the fourth governor of Las <unk> . Perceiving that the coast at Santa Barbara was vulnerable to attack , he located a spot near a harbor which was sheltered from severe storms . In addition , there was an ample supply of both building materials and water nearby . Construction began on April 21 , 1782 , and Padre Junípero Serra blessed the site . By the next year , a temporary facility had been completed , and a wheat field planted by the local Chumash Indians of Chief <unk> . The early Presidio consisted of mud and brush walls around a quadrangle 330 feet on a side . The post had 61 officers and men in 1783 . 
 The first comandante , José Francisco Ortega , planned the fortifications and irrigation works . He obtained livestock for the presidio from Mission San Buenaventura , established orchards , and began large @-@ scale farming . In 1784 , Felipe de Goicoechea took over as comandante , supervising construction of the fortifications and living quarters for the soldiers and their families . Two years later , construction of the nearby Mission Santa Barbara began in 1786 . The pueblo or town of Santa Barbara developed around the Presidio , which offered protection for the residents . The chapel in the Presidio was the primary place of worship for the residents of early Santa Barbara , until its destruction by the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake . The mission , located a mile and a half inland , was mainly intended for use by the native Chumash ( <unk> ) neophytes after their conversion to Catholicism . 
 The Presidio was built to standard plans for a Spanish colonial military headquarters , using locally available materials , so the buildings forming the outer square were constructed with thick , solid adobe outer walls . The main gate opened into an open parade ground / plaza in the center of the square . The chapel stood at the center of the back of the square , facing the gate across the plaza . While it was never attacked by a strong military force during its sixty years of operation , the Presidio was subject to the assaults of nature . Several devastating earthquakes in the early 19th century destroyed much of the structure . 
 In 1855 the Presidio Chapel grew into the Apostolic College of Our Lady of Sorrows , which soon became Our Lady of Sorrows Church at the corner of Figueroa and State Streets , and then at the corner of Anacapa and Sola streets in 1929 . However , both still stand separately as vibrant churches of a richly Catholic history .

 At the time of the Mexican @-@ American War in Alta California , very little of the fortress remained in usable condition , and on December 27 , 1846 , John C. Frémont ascended San Marcos Pass during rainy weather and came up on the Presidio and the town from behind . The Presidio surrendered without a fight , as the garrison was far south in the Pueblo de Los Angeles . Frémont had heard that the Mexican army was lying in ambush for him at Gaviota Pass , the only other sensible route over the mountains at that time , and had crossed the difficult muddy track on San Marcos Pass to outflank them , but this move turned out not to have been necessary . Mexican General Andrés Pico later surrendered his force to Frémont , recognizing that the war was lost .

 " The Pointy End " is the eighth episode of the HBO medieval fantasy television series Game of Thrones . First aired on June 5 , 2011 , the episode was directed by Daniel Minahan and written by George R. R. Martin , the author of the A Song of Ice and Fire novels on which the show is based . 
 The plot covers the aftermath of Eddard Stark 's capture . While the Lannisters seek to capture his daughters , his son and heir , Robb , raises an army in the North . Meanwhile , Daenerys witnesses a Dothraki raid on a peaceful village , and Jon Snow faces a new threat at the Wall . The episode 's title refers to the sword fighting lesson that Jon gave to Arya before their farewell : " Stick them with the pointy end . " 
 This episode attracted 3 @.@ 6 million viewers for the night , a series high . It was well received by critics , who praised Martin 's adaptation of his own work as well as the actors ' performances .

 The episode was written by George R. R. Martin , the author of the book A Game of Thrones on which the series is based . Content from this episode also appears in chapters Tyrion VI , Arya IV , Sansa IV , Jon VII , Bran VI , Catelyn VIII , Tyrion VII , Sansa V , the early part of Eddard XV , and Daenerys VII of the novel . Martin has extensive experience in television writing , but it had been a decade since he had produced a teleplay . He said that he found writing this episode very easy because of his familiarity with the characters and the story , and that the hardest part was " getting used to the new screenwriting software that [ he ] had to use . " 
 Martin delivered the first draft of the script to the show 's executive producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss on May 1 , 2010 , admitting that it was probably " too long and too expensive . " In fact , one scene that Martin wrote – Robb Stark calling his father 's Northern bannermen , with a montage of eight different castles receiving the summons and riding out – was deemed impossible to film . 
 The first scenes depicting Tyrion descending with Bronn from the Mountains of the Moon and encountering the clansmen were not written by Martin . Since they were originally intended to be part of episode seven , they were written by that episode 's authors , David Benioff and D. B. Weiss . As often happens in TV production , the scene was moved from one episode to another during editing .

 The scenes at the village of the Lamb Men that is sacked by the Dothraki were filmed towards the end of October 2010 in Malta , at the farming town of <unk> . For the exterior of the Red Keep where Arya recovers her sword Needle , San Anton Palace was used .

 " The Pointy End " was well received by critics . Among the most enthusiastic was Maureen Ryan from AOL TV , who called it " the best episode yet , " and wrote that she was " extremely impressed with how many moving parts were deployed smoothly and how the hour just flowed . " IGN 's Matt Fowler remarked that this mostly Ned @-@ less episode was very busy ; he enjoyed that Robb got to share the spotlight as viewers witnessed part of his " maturation . " 
 The episode 's multiple perspectives were commented on : James Hibberd wrote for Entertainment Weekly that " for a show that can often seem disjointed due by having so many storylines unfolding in different locations , this was the most cohesive episode we 've seen yet , as the entire realm was impacted by Ned Stark being arrested for treason . " At HitFix , Alan Sepinwall called it " by far the busiest episode of the series to date , " remarking that it not only moved " pieces around the chess board to set things up for the season 's final two episodes , " but also included " some crackling dialogue , a few good character moments and some of the best action the show has featured to date . " David Sims from the A.V. Club wrote that the episode " masterfully kept us abreast of everything going on , while sticking to the point @-@ of @-@ view style the show has held from the start . " On his blog Cultural Learnings , reviewer Myles McNutt found the episode " filled with moments where much is done with very little . We don 't really spend a sustained period in any one location , with only brief scenes possible to establish some pretty substantial story developments . " 
 Many critics considered that a great part of the episode 's merits were due to George R. R. Martin 's script . Sepinwall felt that " Martin didn 't get the easiest draw when he wound up having to dramatize the events depicted in ' The Pointy End , ' " but still loved the results . Mo Ryan concluded that anyone who was doubting whether Martin had forgotten about writing television scripts should now put their doubts to rest . The " expert " review from the A.V. Club by Todd VanDerWerff noted " a definite sense of Martin 's hand at work here . Characters that have never quite worked onscreen — like Sansa — suddenly feel much more alive . Characters that have been working — like Tyrion and Arya — get lots of fun stuff to play that never once feels labored . " 
 were also noted . According to Elio Garcia from <unk> , " Sophie Turner really shines in her scenes . There are a lot of people out there who judge Sansa very harshly , but you would have to have a heart of stone not to sympathize with her plight in this episode . " Many reviewers agreed with this sentiment , commenting on the transition from a " spoiled brat " to a young , confused , but courageous teenager were noted by several reviewers positively . Time 's reviewer James Poniewozik emphasized the growth of Robb Stark 's character , praising both Martin 's writing and Richard Madden 's acting . Maureen Ryan highlighted the scene where Syrio Forel confronts the Lannister men to allow Arya 's escape , which she considered masterfully staged .

 = Grace Sherwood = 
 Grace White Sherwood ( c . 1660 – c . 1740 ) , known as the Witch of Pungo , is the last person known to have been convicted of witchcraft in Virginia . A farmer , healer , and midwife , she was accused by her neighbors of transforming herself into a cat , damaging crops and causing the death of livestock . She was charged with witchcraft several times ; at her eventual trial in 1706 , Sherwood was accused of bewitching Elizabeth Hill , causing Hill to miscarry . The court ordered that Sherwood 's guilt or innocence be determined by ducking her in water . If she sank , she was innocent ; if she did not , she was guilty . Sherwood floated to the surface and may have subsequently spent up to eight years in jail before being released . 
 Sherwood lived in Pungo , Princess Anne County ( today part of Virginia Beach ) , and married James Sherwood , a planter , in 1680 . The couple had three sons : John , James , and Richard . The elder James died in 1701 ; Grace Sherwood inherited his property and never remarried . 
 Sherwood 's first case was in 1697 ; she was accused of casting a spell on a bull , resulting in its death , but the matter was dismissed by the agreement of both parties . The following year she was accused of witchcraft by two neighbors ; she supposedly bewitched the hogs and cotton crop of one of them . Sherwood sued for slander after each accusation but her lawsuits were unsuccessful and her husband had to pay court costs . In 1706 she was convicted of witchcraft and was incarcerated . Freed from prison by 1714 , she recovered her property from Princess Anne County , after which she lived on her farm until her death in 1740 at the age of about 80 . 
 On July 10 , 2006 , the 300th anniversary of Sherwood 's conviction , Governor Tim Kaine restored her good name , recognizing that her case was a miscarriage of justice . A statue depicting her was erected near Sentara Bayside Hospital on Independence Boulevard in Virginia Beach , close to the site of the colonial courthouse where she was tried . She is sculpted alongside a raccoon , representing her love of animals , and carrying a basket containing garlic and rosemary , in recognition of her knowledge of herbal healing . 
 = = Family background = = 
 Sherwood was born in 1660 to John and Susan White . John White was a carpenter and farmer of Scottish descent ; it is uncertain whether he was born in America . Susan was English by birth ; their daughter Grace was born in Virginia , probably in Pungo . 
 Grace White married a respected small @-@ farm landowner , James Sherwood , in April 1680 , and they were wed in the Lynnhaven Parish Church . The couple had three sons : John , James , and Richard . John White gave the Sherwoods 50 acres ( 20 ha ) of land when they married , and on his death in 1681 left them the remainder of his 145 acres ( 59 ha ) farm . The Sherwood family was poor , and lived in an area inhabited by small landowners or those with no land at all . In addition to farming , Grace Sherwood grew her own herbs , which she used to heal both people and animals . She also acted as a midwife . When James died in 1701 , Grace inherited his property . She did not remarry . 
 No drawings or paintings of Sherwood exist , but contemporary accounts describe her as attractive and tall and possessing a sense of humor . Sherwood grew medicinal herbs and wore trousers instead of a dress while working on her farm ; both traits were atypical of ladies of that era . This combination of clothing and good looks was said to attract men and upset their wives . Sherwood biographer and advocate Belinda Nash suggests that Sherwood 's neighbors may have been jealous of Sherwood and that the witchcraft tales may have been conjured up in an effort to remove her from , and subsequently to gain , her property . Sherwood was a party to at least a dozen lawsuits , in which she either had to defend against accusations of witchcraft , or in which she filed suits for slander , against her accusers . 
 = = Witchcraft and Virginia = = 
 The existence of witches and demonic forces was taken for granted by the American colonists — witchcraft was considered the work of the Devil . Strange behaviors supposedly identified witches to the colonists . As early as 1626 , nineteen years after the founding of the Jamestown colony , a grand jury sat to consider whether <unk> Joan Wright was a witch — she had supposedly predicted the deaths of three women and had caused illness as revenge for not hiring her as midwife . No record of the outcome is extant . Nevertheless , Virginia did not experience the type of mass hysteria evidenced by the Salem , Massachusetts witch trials in 1692 – 1693 , where 19 people were executed on allegations of sorcery , several years before the first accusations against Sherwood . Ecclesiastical influence in Virginian courts was much less than in those of New England — Virginia 's clergy participated little in witchcraft accusations and trials , unlike their New England counterparts . New England 's Puritans had settled in towns , and community pressure helped contribute to witchcraft convictions . There were few such towns in Virginia , where the population mostly lived on farms and plantations , scattered over a large area . 
 Virginia 's lay and religious leaders sought to prosecute offenses such as gossip , slander , and fornication , which they felt were a threat to social stability in the new colony . They wished to avoid witchcraft prosecutions , which were divisive . Virginia courts were reluctant to hear accusations of witchcraft and were even more reluctant to convict . Unlike the Salem witch trial courts , where the accused had to prove her innocence , in Virginia courts the accuser carried the burden of proof . Further , Virginia courts generally ignored evidence said to have been obtained by supernatural means , whereas the New England courts were known to convict people based solely on it . Virginia required proof of guilt through either searches for witch 's marks or ducking . Judges and magistrates would dismiss unsubstantiated cases of witchcraft and allow the accusers , who found themselves " under an ill tongue " , to be sued for slander . Frances Pollard of the Virginia Historical Society states : " It was pretty clear that Virginia early on tried to discourage these charges being brought of witchcraft because they were so troublesome . " People 's fears of witchcraft in Virginia were not based on their religious beliefs as much as they were rooted in folklore , although the two often intermingled . The southeastern corner of Virginia around present @-@ day Norfolk and Virginia Beach ( where Pungo is located ) , saw more accusations of witchcraft than other areas . According to Leslie M. Newman , this may have been due to local poverty as there was no cultural elite to restrain such prosecutions . 
 Although few Virginia records survive from that era , 19 known witchcraft cases were brought there during the 17th century , all but one of which ended in acquittal . The one conviction was a 1656 case of a man convicted of witchcraft and sentenced to 10 stripes and banishment from the county . There were no executions for witchcraft in Virginia . Nonetheless , as late as in 1736 , Virginia 's justices of the peace were reminded that witchcraft was still a crime , and that first offenders could expect to be pilloried and jailed for up to a year . In 1745 , John Craig , a Presbyterian minister in Augusta County , Virginia , made assertions of witchcraft after his child and several of his animals died , and was in response accused of using evil arts to divine who was responsible . Neither he nor those who accused him brought their claims to court to face " unsympathetic magistrates " , though prosecution for witchcraft was still possible in Virginia . The last Virginia witchcraft trial took place in 1802 in Brooke County , which is now in West Virginia . In that case , a couple claimed that a woman was a witch , an accusation ruled slanderous . 
 The trial by ducking ( immersing the accused , bound , in water , to see if she would float ) appears to have been used only once in Virginia , to try Sherwood . It was believed that , as water was considered pure , it would reject witches , causing them to float , whereas the innocent would sink . 
 = = Accusations against Sherwood = = 
 = = = Initial claims of witchcraft = = = 
 Sherwood was first charged with witchcraft in a court case held in early 1697 , in which Richard Capps alleged that she had used a spell to cause the death of his bull . The court made no decision on this charge ; the Sherwoods then filed a defamation suit against Capps that was discontinued when the parties came to an agreement . In 1698 , Sherwood was accused by her neighbor John <unk> of enchanting his pigs and cotton crop . No court action followed this accusation , and another action for defamation by the Sherwoods also failed . In the same year Elizabeth Barnes alleged that Sherwood had assumed the form of a black cat , entered Barnes ' home , jumped over her bed , drove and whipped her , and left via the keyhole . Again the allegation was unresolved , and again the subsequent defamation action was lost . For each of the failed actions Sherwood and her husband had to pay court related costs . 
 According to Richard Beale Davis in his journal article on witchcraft in Virginia , by this time " Princess Anne County had obviously grown tired of Mrs. Sherwood as a general nuisance " . In 1705 , Sherwood was involved in a fight with her neighbor , Elizabeth Hill . Sherwood sued Hill and her husband for assault and battery , and on December 7 , 1705 , was awarded damages of twenty shillings ( 1 pound sterling ) . On January 3 , 1706 , the Hills accused Grace Sherwood of witchcraft , although she failed to answer the charge in court . On February 7 , 1706 , the court ordered her to appear on a charge of having bewitched Elizabeth Hill , causing a miscarriage . 
 = = = Trial by water = = = 
 Proceedings resumed in March 1706 ; the Princess Anne County justices sought to <unk> two juries , both made up of women . The first was ordered to search Sherwood 's home for waxen or baked figures that might indicate she was a witch . The second was ordered to look for " demon suckling teats " by examining her . In both instances , reluctance on the part of the local residents made it difficult to form a jury and both juries refused to carry out the search . On March 7 , 1706 , Sherwood was examined by a jury of 12 " ancient and knowing women " appointed to look for markings on her body that might be brands of the Devil . They discovered two " marks not like theirs or like those of any other woman " . The forewoman of this jury was the same Elizabeth Barnes who had previously accused Sherwood of witchcraft . 
 Neither the colonial authorities in Williamsburg nor the local court in Princess Anne were willing to declare Sherwood a witch . Those in Williamsburg considered the charge overly vague , and on April 16 instructed the local court to examine the case more fully . For each court appearance , Sherwood had to travel 16 miles ( 26 km ) from her farm in Pungo to where the court was sitting . 
 On May 2 , 1706 , the county justices noted that while no particular act of maleficium had been alleged against Sherwood , there was " great cause of suspicion " . Consequently , the Sheriff of Princess Anne County took Sherwood into custody , though Sherwood could give bond for her appearance and good behavior . Maximilian <unk> , a warden of Lynnhaven Parish Church , was the prosecutor in Sherwood 's case . On July 5 , 1706 , the justices ordered a trial by ducking to take place , with Sherwood 's consent , but heavy rains caused a postponement until July 10 , as they feared the wet weather might harm her health . Sherwood was taken inside Lynnhaven Parish Church , placed on a stool and ordered to ask for forgiveness for her witchery . She replied , " I be not a witch , I be a healer . " 
 At about 10 a.m. on July 10 , 1706 , Sherwood was taken down a dirt lane now known as <unk> Road , to a plantation near the mouth of the Lynnhaven River . News had spread , and the event attracted people from all over the colony , who began to shout " Duck the witch ! " According to the principles of trial by water , if Sherwood floated she would be deemed guilty of witchcraft ; if she did not , she would be innocent . It was not intended that Sherwood drown ; the court had ordered that care be taken to preserve her life . 
 Five women of Lynnhaven Parish Church examined Sherwood 's naked body on the shoreline for any devices she might have to free herself , and then covered her with a sack . Six of the justices that had ordered the ducking rowed in one boat 200 yards ( 180 m ) out in the river , and in another were the sheriff , the magistrate , and Sherwood . Just before she was pushed off the boat Sherwood is said to have stated , under clear skies , " Before this day be through you will all get a worse ducking than I. " Bound across the body – her right thumb to her left big toe and her left thumb to her right big toe – she was " cast into the river " , and quickly floated to the surface . The sheriff then tied a 13 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 9 kg ) Bible around her neck . This caused her to sink , but she untied herself , and returned to the surface , convincing many spectators she was a witch . As Sherwood was pulled out of the water a downpour reportedly started , drenching the onlookers . Several women who subsequently examined her for additional proof found " two things like <unk> on her private parts of a black <unk> [ color ] " . She was jailed pending further proceedings . 
 = = = Aftermath = = = 
 What happened to Sherwood after her ducking is unclear as many court records have been lost . She served an unknown time in the jail next to Lynnhaven Parish Church , perhaps as long as seven years and nine months . She was ordered to be detained " to be brought to a future trial " , but no record of another trial exists , so it is possible the charge was dismissed at some point . On September 1 , 1708 , she was ordered to pay Christopher Cocke 600 pounds ( 270 kg ) of tobacco for a reason not indicated in surviving records , but there is no mention of the payment . She appears to have been released some time in or before 1714 , since in that year she paid back taxes on her 145 @-@ acre ( 59 ha ) property — which Virginia Lieutenant Governor Alexander Spotswood helped her to recover from Princess Anne <unk> on the banks of Muddy Creek off what is now Muddy Creek Road . She lived the remainder of her life quietly until her death in 1740 , aged about 80 . She is believed to have died in August or September 1740 . Her will was proved on October 1 , 1740 ; it noted that she was a widow . She left five shillings each to her sons James and Richard and everything else to her eldest son John . 
 According to legend , Sherwood 's sons put her body near the fireplace and a wind came down the chimney . Her body disappeared amid the embers , with the only clue being a cloven <unk> . Sherwood lies in an unmarked grave under some trees in a field close to the intersection of Pungo Ferry Road and Princess Anne Road in Virginia Beach . Stories about the Devil taking her body , unnatural storms , and loitering black cats quickly arose after her death , and local men killed every feline they could find ; this widespread killing of cats might have caused the infestation of rats and mice recorded in Princess Anne County in 1743 . Her home on Muddy Creek stood for over 200 years until burning in the 1990s . The property is now owned by the Federal Government as part of Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge .

 Grace Sherwood 's case was little known until Virginia Beach historian and author Louisa Venable Kyle wrote a children 's book about her in 1973 . Called The Witch of Pungo , it is a collection of seven local folk tales written as fiction , although based on historical events . Sherwood 's story was adapted for Cry Witch , a courtroom drama at Colonial Williamsburg , the restored early capital of Virginia . 
 A statue by California sculptor Robert Cunningham depicting Sherwood with a raccoon and a basket of rosemary was unveiled on April 21 , 2007 , on the site of the present @-@ day Sentara Bayside Hospital , close to the sites of both the colonial courthouse and the ducking point . The raccoon represents Sherwood 's love of animals and the rosemary her knowledge of herbal healing . A Virginia Department of Historic Resources marker ( K @-@ 276 ) was erected in 2002 , about 25 yards ( 23 m ) from Sherwood 's statue . The place of her watery test and the adjacent land are named Witch Duck Bay and Witch Duck Point . A portion of Virginia State Route 190 in Virginia Beach , a north – south thoroughfare on its western side which traverses Interstate 264 at exit numbers 14 – 16 , has been named " <unk> Road " . Other commemorations in Virginia Beach include Sherwood Lane and Witch Point Trail . A local legend in Virginia Beach states that all of the rosemary growing there came from a single plant Sherwood carried in an eggshell from England . 
 Belinda Nash , in addition to writing a biography of Sherwood , worked tirelessly to get her pardoned . Governor Tim Kaine officially restored Sherwood 's good name on July 10 , 2006 , the 300th anniversary of her conviction . Annual reenactments of the ducking have taken place since 2006 . No one is actually ducked in these events , which embark from a spot across from Ferry Plantation House along <unk> Lane , which is very close to Witch Duck Bay . According to local residents , a strange moving light , said to be Sherwood 's restless spirit , still appears each July over the spot in Witch Duck Bay where Sherwood was thrown into the water . 
 In 2014 , a memorial marker was placed at a herb garden of the Old Donation Episcopal Church , Sherwood 's former parish church . 
 = Mark Satin = 
 Mark Ivor Satin ( born November 16 , 1946 ) is an American political theorist , author , and newsletter publisher . He is best known for contributing to the development and dissemination of three political perspectives – <unk> in the 1960s , New Age politics in the 1970s and 1980s , and radical centrism in the 1990s and 2000s . Satin 's work is sometimes seen as building toward a new political ideology , and then it is often labeled " transformational " , " post @-@ liberal " , or " post @-@ Marxist " . One historian calls Satin 's writing " post @-@ hip " . 
 After emigrating to Canada at the age of 20 to avoid serving in the Vietnam War , Satin co @-@ founded the Toronto Anti @-@ Draft Programme , which helped bring American war resisters to Canada . He also wrote the Manual for Draft @-@ Age Immigrants to Canada ( 1968 ) , which sold nearly 100 @,@ 000 copies . After a period that author Marilyn Ferguson describes as Satin 's " anti @-@ ambition experiment " , Satin wrote New Age Politics ( 1978 ) , which identifies an emergent " third force " in North America pursuing such goals as simple living , <unk> , and global responsibility . Satin spread his ideas by co @-@ founding an American political organization , the New World Alliance , and by publishing an international political newsletter , New Options . He also co @-@ drafted the foundational statement of the U.S. Green Party , " Ten Key Values " . 
 Following a period of political disillusion , spent mainly in law school and practicing business law , Satin launched a new political newsletter and wrote a book , Radical Middle ( 2004 ) . Both projects criticized political partisanship and sought to promote mutual learning and innovative policy syntheses across social and cultural divides . In an interview , Satin contrasts the old radical slogan " Dare to struggle , dare to win " with his radical @-@ middle version , " Dare to synthesize , dare to take it all in " . 
 Satin has been described as " colorful " and " intense " , and all his initiatives have been controversial . Bringing war resisters to Canada was opposed by many in the anti @-@ Vietnam War movement . New Age Politics was not welcomed by many on the traditional left or right , and Radical Middle dismayed an even broader segment of the American political community . Even Satin 's personal life has generated controversy . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Many mid @-@ 1960s American radicals came from small cities in the Midwest and Southwest , as did Satin : he grew up in Moorhead , Minnesota , and Wichita Falls , Texas . His father , who saw combat in World War II , was a college professor and author of a Cold War @-@ era textbook on Western civilization . His mother was a homemaker . 
 As a youth , Satin was restless and rebellious , and his behavior did not change after leaving for university . In early 1965 , at age 18 , he dropped out of the University of Illinois to work with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in Holly Springs , Mississippi . Later that year , he was told to leave Midwestern State University , in Texas , for refusing to sign a loyalty oath to the United States Constitution . In 1966 he became president of a Students for a Democratic Society chapter at the State University of New York at Binghamton , and helped recruit nearly 20 % of the student body to join . One term later he dropped out , then emigrated to Canada to avoid serving in the Vietnam War . 
 Just before Satin left for Canada , his father told him he was trying to destroy himself . His mother told the Ladies ' Home Journal she could not condone her son 's actions . Satin says he arrived in Canada feeling bewildered and unsupported . According to press accounts , many Vietnam War resisters arrived feeling much the same way .

 = = = Toronto Anti @-@ Draft Programme = = = 
 As 1967 began , many American pacifists and radicals did not look favorably on emigration to Canada as a means of resisting the Vietnam War . For some this reflected a core conviction that effective war resistance requires self @-@ sacrifice . For others it was a matter of strategy – emigration was said to be less useful than going to jail or deserting the military , or was said to abet the war by siphoning off the opposition . At first , Students for a Democratic Society and many Quaker draft counselors opposed promoting the Canadian alternative , and Canada 's largest counseling group , the Anti @-@ Draft Programme of the Student Union for Peace Action ( SUPA ) – whose board consisted largely of Quakers and radicals – was sympathetic to such calls for prudence . In January 1967 its spokesman warned an American audience that immigration was difficult and that the Programme was not willing to act as " baby sitters " for Americans after they arrived . He added that he was tired of talking to the press . 
 When Mark Satin was hired as director of the Programme in April 1967 , he attempted to change its culture . He also tried to change the attitude of the war resistance movement toward emigration . His efforts continued after SUPA collapsed and he co @-@ founded the Toronto Anti @-@ Draft Programme , with largely the same board of directors , in October 1967 . Instead of praising self @-@ sacrifice , he emphasized the importance of self @-@ preservation and self @-@ development to social change . Rather than sympathizing with pacifists ' and radicals ' strategic concerns , he rebutted them , telling The New York Times that massive emigration of draft @-@ age Americans could help end the war , and telling another reporter that going to jail was bad public relations . 
 Where the Programme once publicized the difficulties of immigration , Satin emphasized the competence of his draft counseling operation , and even told of giving cash to immigrants who were without funds . Instead of refusing to " baby sit " Americans after they arrived , Satin made post @-@ emigration assistance a top priority . The office soon sported comfortable furniture , a hot plate , and free food ; within a few months , 200 Torontonians had opened their homes to war resisters and a job @-@ finding service had been established . Finally , rather than expressing indifference to reporters , Satin courted them , and many responded , beginning with a May 1967 article in The New York Times Magazine that included a large picture of Satin counseling Vietnam War resisters in the refurbished office . Some of the publicity focused on Satin as much as on his cause . According to historian Pierre Berton , Satin was so visible that he became the unofficial spokesman for war resisters in Canada . 
 Satin defined himself as a neopacifist or quasi @-@ pacifist – flexible , media @-@ savvy , and entrepreneurial . He told one journalist he might have fought against Hitler . He was not necessarily opposed to the draft , telling reporters he would support it for a defensive army or to help eliminate poverty , illiteracy , and racial discrimination . He avoided the intellectual framework of traditional pacifism and socialism . Sometimes he spoke with emotion , as when he described the United States to The New York Times Magazine as " [ t ] hat <unk> sick , foul country ; could anything be worse ? " Sometimes he spoke poetically , as when he told author Jules <unk> , " It 's colder here , but you feel warm because you know you 're not trying to kill people . " Instead of identifying with older pacifists , he identified with a 17 @-@ year @-@ old character from the pen of J. D. Salinger : " I was Holden Caulfield " , he said in 2008 , " just standing and catching in the rye . " 
 The results of Satin 's approach were noticeable : the Programme went from averaging fewer than three visitors , letters , and phone calls per day just before he arrived , to averaging 50 per day nine months later . In addition , the American anti @-@ war movement became more accepting of emigration to Canada – for example , author Myra MacPherson reports that Satin 's Manual for Draft @-@ Age Immigrants to Canada could be obtained at every draft counseling office in the U.S. However , Satin 's approach was distressing to the traditional pacifists and socialists on the Programme 's board . The board clashed with Satin over at least 10 political , strategic , and performance issues . The most intractable may have been over the extent of the publicity . There were also concerns about Satin 's personal issues ; for example , one war resister claims to have heard him say , " <unk> would kill me " . In May 1968 , the board finally fired him . 
 = = = Manual for Draft @-@ Age Immigrants to Canada = = = 
 Before Satin was fired , he conceived and wrote , and edited guest chapters for , the Manual for Draft @-@ Age Immigrants to Canada , published in January 1968 by the House of Anansi Press in partnership with the Toronto Anti @-@ Draft Programme . The Programme had issued brochures on emigration before – including a 12 @-@ page version under Satin 's watch – but the Manual was different , a comprehensive , 45 @,@ 000 @-@ word book , and it quickly turned into an " underground bestseller " . Many years later , Toronto newspapers reported that nearly 100 @,@ 000 copies of the Manual had been sold . One journalist calls it the " first entirely Canadian @-@ published bestseller in the United States " . 
 The Programme was initially hesitant about producing the Manual , which promised to draw even more war resisters and publicity to it . " The [ board ] didn 't even want me to write it " , Satin says . " I wrote it at night , in the SUPA office , three or four nights a week after counseling guys and gals 8 to 10 hours a day – pounded it out in several drafts over several months on SUPA 's ancient Underwood typewriter . " When it finally appeared , some leading periodicals helped put it on the map . For example , The New York Review of Books called it " useful " , and The New York Times said it contains advice about everything from how to qualify as an immigrant to jobs , housing , schools , politics , culture , and even the snow . After the war , sociologist John Hagan found that more than a third of young American emigrants to Canada had read the Manual while still in the United States , and nearly another quarter obtained it after they arrived . 
 The Manual reflected Satin 's neopacifist politics . Commentators routinely characterized it as caustic , responsible , and supportive . The first part of the Manual , on emigration , suggests that self @-@ preservation is more important than sacrifice to a dubious cause . The second half , on Canada , spotlights opportunities for self @-@ development and social innovation . According to Canadian social historian David Churchill , the Manual helped some Canadians begin to see Toronto as socially inclusive , politically progressive , and counter @-@ cultural . 
 Inevitably , the Manual became a lightning rod for controversy . Some observers took issue with its perspective on Canada ; most notably , The Cambridge Companion to Canadian Literature criticizes its " condescending tone " in describing Canada 's resources . Elements in the U.S. and Canadian governments may have been upset by the Manual . According to journalist Lynn <unk> , the FBI and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ( RCMP ) attempted to wiretap the House of Anansi Press 's offices . In addition , Anansi co @-@ founder Dave Godfrey is convinced a 10 @-@ day government audit of the press was generated by FBI – RCMP concerns . Many people did not want the Programme to encourage draft @-@ eligible Americans to emigrate to Canada , and Satin routinely denied that the Manual encouraged emigration . But few observers believed him , then or later . The first sentence of an article in The New York Times from 1968 describes the Manual as " a major bid to encourage Americans to evade military conscription " . Canadian essayist Robert Fulford remembers the Manual as offering an enthusiastic welcome to draft dodgers . Even a House of Anansi Press anthology from 2007 concedes that the Manual is " coyly titled " . 
 Satin was fired from the Programme soon after the appearance of the second edition of the Manual , which had a print run of 20 @,@ 000 . His name was removed from the title page of most subsequent editions . According to a study of the Manual by critic Joseph Jones in Canadian Notes & Queries , a literary journal , some later editions experienced a <unk> in quality . Nevertheless , Jones says the Manual stands as an icon of its age . It has made significant appearances in at least five novels , including John Irving 's A Prayer for Owen Meany , and it continues to be pored over by historians , social scientists , and graduate students . 
 = = = Confessions of a Young Exile = = = 
 Until the 1990s , literary critic William Zinsser says , memoir writers tended to conceal their most personal and embarrassing memories . In the 1970s Satin wrote a memoir revealing many such memories as a neopacifist activist during the years 1964 – 66 , Confessions of a Young Exile , published by Gage , a Toronto publishing house soon to merge with Macmillan of Canada . Confessions is " a remarkable exercise in self @-@ exposure " , playwright John Lazarus says in a review . " The insights into the hero 's motives and fears are so honest , and so <unk> true , that it soon becomes evident that the [ naive ] tone is deliberate . " 
 To some reviewers , Satin appears to have had a political goal – encouraging activists to establish common ground with ordinary North Americans on the basis of their shared confusion and humanity . For example , Jackie Hooper , writing in The Province , argues that the purity of motives projected by many pacifist activists is unconvincing , and recommends Satin 's more complex view : " Satin 's emigration wasn 't dictated totally by his idealism . More often than not , he talked himself into radical positions ... as a result of trying to impress his peers or his girlfriend , or rebelling against middle @-@ class parental authority " . 
 Some reviewers were unenthusiastic . For example , Dennis Duffy , writing in The Globe and Mail , describes Satin 's memoir as a " story about a young man who doesn 't grow up " . In addition , Satin 's publisher began having reservations about him . Many years later , the Toronto Star reported that the publisher decided not to let Satin do any publicity for the book , because of his potentially offensive views .

 = = = New Age Politics , the book = = = 
 As the 1970s began , the New Left faded away , and many movements arose in its wake – among them the feminist , men 's liberation , spiritual , human potential , ecology , appropriate technology , intentional community , and holistic health movements . After graduating from the University of British Columbia in 1972 , Satin immersed himself in all these movements , either directly or as a reporter for Canada 's underground press . He also took up residence in a free @-@ love commune . " One fierce winter 's day " , he says , " ... it dawned on me that the ideas and energies from the various ' fringe ' movements [ were ] beginning to generate a coherent new politics . But I looked in vain for the people and groups that were expressing that new politics ( instead of merely bits and pieces of it ) " . Satin set out to write a book that would express the new politics in all its dimensions . He wrote , designed , typeset , and printed the first edition of New Age Politics himself , in 1976 . A 240 @-@ page edition was published by Vancouver 's Whitecap Books in 1978 , and a 349 @-@ page edition by Dell Publishing Company in New York in 1979 . It is now widely regarded as the " first " , " most ambitious " , or " most adequate " attempt to offer a systemic overview of the new post @-@ socialist politics arising in the wake of the New Left . Some academics say it offers a new ideology . 
 At the heart of New Age Politics is a critique of the consciousness we all supposedly share , a " six @-@ sided prison " that has kept us all trapped for hundreds of years . The six sides of the " prison " are said to be : patriarchal attitudes , <unk> , scientific single vision , the bureaucratic mentality , nationalism ( xenophobia ) , and the " big city outlook " ( fear of nature ) . Since consciousness , according to Satin , ultimately determines our institutions , prison consciousness is said to be ultimately responsible for " monolithic " institutions that offer us little in the way of freedom of choice or connection with others . Some representative monolithic institutions are : bureaucratic government , automobile @-@ centered transportation systems , attorney @-@ centered law , doctor @-@ centered health care , and church @-@ centered spirituality . 
 To explain how to break free of the prison and its institutions , Satin develops a " <unk> " class analysis that reveals the existence of " life- " , " <unk> " , and " death @-@ oriented " classes . According to Satin , life @-@ oriented individuals constitute an emerging " third force " in post @-@ industrial nations . The third force is generating a " prison @-@ free " consciousness consisting of androgynous attitudes , spirituality , multiple perspectives , a cooperative mentality , local @-@ and @-@ global identities , and an ecological outlook . To transform prison society , Satin argues , the third force is going to have to launch an " evolutionary movement " to replace – or at least supplement – monolithic institutions with life @-@ affirming , " <unk> " ones . Some representative <unk> institutions are : deliberative democracy as an alternative to bureaucratic government , bicycles and mass transit as an alternative to the private automobile , and mediation as an alternative to attorney @-@ centered law . According to Satin , the third force will not have to overthrow capitalism , since Western civilization – not capitalism – is said to be responsible for the prison . But the third force will want to foster a prison @-@ free New Age capitalism through intelligent regulation and elimination of all subsidies . 
 The reaction to New Age Politics was , and continues to be , highly polarized . Many of the movements Satin drew upon to construct his synthesis received it favorably , though some took exception to the title . Some maverick liberals and libertarians are drawn to the book . It was eventually published in Sweden and Germany , and European New Age political thinkers came to see it as a precursor of their own work . Others see it as proto @-@ Green . Ever since its first appearance , though , and continuing into the 21st century , New Age Politics has been a target of criticism for two groups in the United States : conservative Christians and left @-@ wing intellectuals . 
 Among conservative Christians , there are cultural , political , and moral objections . Attorney Constance <unk> warns that the book can be " seductive " to those who lack an adequate Biblical education . Theologians Tim LaHaye and Ron Rhodes are convinced Satin wants a centralized and coercive world government . Moral philosopher Douglas Groothuis says Satin 's vision is unsound because it lacks an absolute standard of good and evil . Among left @-@ leaning academics , criticism focuses on Satin 's theoretical underpinnings . Political scientist Michael Cummings takes issue with the idea that consciousness is ultimately determining . Science @-@ and @-@ society professor David Hess rejects the idea that economic class analysis should give way to <unk> class analysis . A lengthy , systemic critique of New Age Politics , by communication studies professor Dana L. Cloud , accuses it of employing a " therapeutic rhetoric [ ] generated to console activists after the failure of post @-@ 1968 revolutionary movements and to legitimate participation in liberal politics " . 
 = = = Organizing the New World Alliance = = = 
 After U.S. President Jimmy Carter pardoned Vietnam War resisters in 1977 , Satin began giving talks on New Age Politics in the United States . His first talk received a standing ovation , and he wept . Every talk seemed to lead to two or three more , and " the response at New Age gatherings , community events , fairs , bookstores , living rooms , and college campuses " kept Satin going for two years . By the second year he began laying the groundwork for the New World Alliance , a national political organization based in Washington , D.C. " I went systematically to 24 cities and regions from coast to coast " , he told the authors of the book Networking . " I stopped when I found 500 [ accomplished ] people who said they 'd answer a questionnaire … on what a New Age @-@ oriented political organization should be like – what its politics should be , what its projects should be , and how its first directors should be chosen . " . 
 The New World Alliance convened its first " governing council " meeting in New York City in 1979 . The 39 @-@ member council was chosen by the questionnaire @-@ <unk> themselves , out of 89 who volunteered to be on the ballot . Political scientist Arthur Stein describes the council as an eclectic collection of educators , feminists , businesspeople , <unk> , think @-@ tank fellows , and activists . One of the council 's announced goals was to break down the division between left and right . Another was to help facilitate a thorough transformation of society . Satin was named staff member of the Alliance . 
 Expectations ran high among supporters of a post @-@ liberal , post @-@ Marxist politics , and the governing council did initiate several projects . For example , a series of " Political Awareness Seminars " attempted to help participants understand and learn to work with their political opponents . In addition , a " Transformation Platform " attempted to synthesize left- and right @-@ wing approaches to dozens of public policy issues . But within three years the Alliance fell apart , unable to establish stable chapters in any major cities . Author Jerome Clark suggests the cause was the Alliance 's commitment to consensus @-@ building in all its groups and projects ; within months , he notes , one member was complaining that the Alliance had turned into a " <unk> 's cult " . Another explanation focuses on the failure – or inability – of the hyper @-@ democratic questionnaire process to select an appropriate governing council . 
 Satin was devastated by the decline of the Alliance , and engaged in unhappy bouts of public criticism and self @-@ criticism . " We would rather be good than do good " , he told editor Kevin Kelly . " We would rather be pure than mature . We are the Beautiful Losers . " As time went on , though , the Alliance came to be regarded positively by many observers . For example , author Corinne McLaughlin sees it as one of the first groups to offer an agenda for the new transformational politics . In an academic text , political scientist Stephen Woolpert acknowledges it as a precursor of North American Green parties . 
 = = = New Options Newsletter = = = 
 After four or five New World Alliance governing council meetings , Satin became tired of what he saw as empty rhetoric , and decided to do something practical – start a political newsletter . He raised $ 91 @,@ 000 to launch the venture , from 517 people he had met on his travels , and within a few years had built it into what think @-@ tank scholar George Weigel described as " one of the hottest political newsletters in Washington [ , D.C. ] . ... [ It ] has gotten a fair amount of [ national ] attention , and perhaps even some influence , because it self @-@ consciously styles itself ' post @-@ liberal ' . " Satin published 75 issues of New Options from 1984 to 1992 , virtually half a million words . He wrote nearly all the articles . In 1989 New Options received Utne Reader 's first " Alternative Press Award for General Excellence : Best Publication from 10 @,@ 000 to 30 @,@ 000 Circulation " . In 1990 The Washington Post identified New Options as one of 10 periodicals spearheading " The Ideology Shuffle " . Twenty @-@ five of its articles were published as a book by a university press . 
 Satin wanted New Options to make the visionary perspective of New Age Politics seem pragmatic and realizable . He also wanted New Options to spread the New Age political ideology more effectively than the New World Alliance had done . To those ends , he challenged traditional views across the political spectrum , and he expanded the scope of politics to include subjects like love and relationships . In her book Do You Believe in Magic ? , culture critic Annie Gottlieb says New Options offered : 
 an explosive short course in political possibility . ... What are the best books and groups in the consumer empowerment ( not " protection " ) and neighborhood self @-@ reliance movements ? Who is working on practical , compassionate , populist alternatives to the welfare state and the big @-@ business state ? What is the best way to cut the budget deficit ? What can we learn from the Sri Lankan <unk> ( local self @-@ help ) and Polish Solidarity movements ? Each issue presents ideas , names and addresses , and a crossfire of reader debate . 
 " I think the reason New Options works is it has a particular tone " , Satin told one reporter . " It 's as idealistic as many of us were in the 1960s , but ... without the childishness " . 
 New Options owed its rise to more than just content and tone , however . Positioning was also a factor . The New Age political movement was cresting in the 1980s , and it needed a political periodical . Satin 's book New Age Politics had helped define the movement , and the New Options advisory board – a collection of prominent post @-@ liberal thinkers – gave the newsletter further credibility . At the outset it included Lester R. Brown , Ernest <unk> , Fritjof Capra , Vincent Harding , Willis Harman , Hazel Henderson , Petra Kelly , Amory <unk> , Joanna Macy , Robin Morgan , John Naisbitt , Jeremy Rifkin , Carl Rogers , Theodore Roszak , Kirkpatrick Sale , Charlene Spretnak , and Robert Theobald , and over the years it added such figures as Herman Daly , Marilyn Ferguson , Jane Jacobs , Winona <unk> , and Robert Rodale . 
 New Options did not succeed in all quarters . Jules Feiffer , for example , often seen as being on the liberal @-@ left , called it " irritating " and " neo @-@ yuppie " . Jason McQuinn , often seen as a radical , objected to what he perceived as its relentless American optimism . George Weigel , often seen as a conservative , said it consisted largely of a cleverly repackaged leftism . Satin himself turned out to be one of the newsletter 's critics . " I could have edited New Options forever " , he wrote in 2004 . " But , increasingly , I was becoming dissatisfied with my hyper @-@ idealistic politics " . His experiences in the U.S. Green politics movement contributed to that dissatisfaction . 
 = = = " Ten Key Values " of the U.S. Green Party = = = 
 By the mid @-@ 1980s , Green parties were making inroads all over the world . A slogan of the West German Greens was , " We are neither left nor right ; we are in front " . Some observers , notably British Green Party liaison Sara Parkin , saw the New World Alliance and New Options Newsletter as Green entities . Others saw the early Greens as one expression of New Age politics . In 1984 , Satin was invited to the founding meeting of the U.S. Green politics movement , and he became a founding member . The meeting chose him , along with political theorist Charlene Spretnak , to draft its foundational political statement , " Ten Key Values " . Some accounts recognize futurist and activist Eleanor <unk> as a co @-@ equal drafter . The drafters drew on suggestions recorded on a flip chart during a marathon plenary brainstorming session , as well as on suggestions received by Satin and Spretnak during the meeting and for many weeks afterward . 
 The original " Ten Key Values " statement was approved by the Greens ' national steering committee and released in late 1984 . The values in the original statement are : Ecological Wisdom , Grassroots Democracy , Personal and Social Responsibility , Nonviolence , Decentralization , Community @-@ based Economics , <unk> Values , Respect for Diversity , Global Responsibility , and Future Focus . One unusual aspect , say many observers , is the way the values are described ; instead of declaratory statements full of " <unk> " and " <unk> " , each value is followed by a series of open @-@ ended questions . " That idea ... came from Mark Satin " , Spretnak told scholar Greta Gaard in 1997 . Its effect , says sociologist Paul <unk> , was to promote dialogue and creative thinking in local Green groups across the U.S. 
 The original values statement was , and remains , controversial . U.S. Green Party co @-@ founder John <unk> credits it with helping to unify the often contentious Greens . However , party co @-@ founder Howie Hawkins sees it as just a watered @-@ down , " spiritual " , and " New Age " version of the German Greens ' Four Pillars statement . Greta Gaard says it fails to call for the elimination of capitalism or racism . Looking back after 20 years , Green activist Brian <unk> said that " the voice of the original [ values ] questions is distinctly personal … and aims to avoid fundamental conflicts with elite social and cultural norms . " A " modified " list of the Ten Key Values became part of the U.S. Greens ' political platform . However , all the open @-@ ended questions were replaced by declaratory sentences , and the U.S. Greens have come to be regarded as a party of the left , rather than one seeking to be neither left nor right . 
 Satin himself quit the Greens in 1990 . He gave a featured speech at the U.S. Green gathering in 1987 urging them to avoid hyper @-@ detailed platform writing and other projects and specialize in one thing – running people for office who endorse the Ten Key Values . But the speech failed to persuade . After the Green gathering in 1989 , he urged them to abandon hippie @-@ era fears of money , authority , and leadership . After the 1990 gathering he complained " I 've been Pure before , " an allusion to his time in the New World Alliance . According to Greta Gaard , he then bid farewell to the Greens , but recognized it as a loss : " Whatever I may think of their internal battles and political prospects , the Greens are My People . Their life choices are my life choices ; their failings mirror my own . " Within a year of voicing those words , he stopped New Options Newsletter and applied to law school . 
 = = Radical centrist politics , 1990s – 2000s = = 
 = = = Radical Middle Newsletter = = = 
 The 1990s are remembered , by many in the West , as a time of relative prosperity and satisfaction . According to some historians , visionary politics appeared to be on the decline . However , even after Satin entered New York University School of Law in 1992 , he expressed no desire to abandon his project of helping to construct a post @-@ liberal , post @-@ Marxist ideology . He did admit to being disillusioned with his approach . " I knew my views ( and I personally ) would benefit from engagement with the real world of commerce and professional ambition " , he wrote . 
 After graduating in 1995 , Satin worked for a Manhattan law firm focusing on complex business litigation . He also wrote about financial and legal issues . He did not dislike his work , but felt he was " sleepwalking " because he was not doing what he loved , writing about visionary politics . With six former law school classmates , he began planning a political newsletter that could accommodate all he was learning about business and law . In 1998 he returned to Washington , D.C. , to launch Radical Middle Newsletter . 
 As the title indicates , it sought to distance itself from New Age politics . If the term " New Age " suggests utopianism , the term " radical middle " suggests , for Satin and others , keeping at least one foot firmly on the ground . Satin attempted to embrace the promise but also the balance implied by the term . One feature story is entitled " Tough on Terrorism , and Tough on the Causes of Terrorism " . Another feature story attempts to go beyond polarized positions on biotechnology . Another argues that corporate activity abroad can best be seen as neither inherently moral nor inherently imperialistic , but as a " chance for mutual learning " . The board of advisors of Radical Middle Newsletter signaled Satin 's new direction . It was politically diverse , and many of its members sought to promote dialogue or collaboration across ideological divides . By the end of 2004 it included John <unk> , Don Edward Beck , Jerry H. Bentley , Esther Dyson , Mark P. Painter , Shelley <unk> of the Social Investment Forum , James Fallows of the New America Foundation , Jane Mansbridge of the Harvard Kennedy School , John D. Marks and Susan Collin Marks of Search for Common Ground , and William Ury , co @-@ author of Getting to Yes . 
 Radical Middle Newsletter proved controversial . Many responded positively to Satin 's new direction . A professor of management , for example , wrote that unlike Satin 's former newsletter , Radical Middle spoke about " reality " . Scholarly books began citing the newsletter . In a book on globalization , Walter Truett Anderson said Radical Middle " carries the encouraging news of an emerging group with a different voice , one that is ' nuanced , hopeful , adult ' . ... It is essentially a willingness to listen to both sides of the argument . " But three objections were often heard . Some critics accused Satin of misguided policy proposals , as when peace studies scholar Michael N. <unk> wrote that the article " praising humanitarian military intervention as the ' peace movement ' of our time , is nothing short of an insult ... to the real peace movement " [ emphasis in original ] . Other critics accused Satin of abandoning his old constituency , as when author and former New Options advisor David <unk> chided him for consciously choosing pragmatism over idealism . There were also accusations of elitism , as when the executive editor of Yes ! magazine said Satin favored globalization because it appealed to his interests and those of his " law school buddies " . 
 New Options Newsletter was based on the theories set forth in New Age Politics . But Satin 's approach to his radical middle project was eclectic and experimental . His contribution to radical centrist political theory , the book Radical Middle , was not published until 2004 , the newsletter 's sixth year . Until then , the only glimpse Satin gave of his larger vision appeared in an article he wrote for an academic journal . 
 = = = Radical Middle , the book = = = 
 Satin 's book Radical Middle : The Politics We Need Now , published by Westview Press and Basic Books in 2004 , attempts to present radical centrism as a political ideology . It is considered one of the two or three " most persuasive " or most representative books on the subject , and it received the " Best Book Award " for 2003 and 2004 from the Section on Ecological and <unk> Politics of the American Political Science Association . It also generated – like all of Satin 's works – criticism and controversy . 
 Satin presents Radical Middle as a revised and evolved version of his New Age Politics book , rather than as a rejection of it . Some observers had always seen him as a radical centrist . As early as 1980 , author Marilyn Ferguson identified him as part of what she called the " Radical Center " . In 1987 , culture critic Annie Gottlieb said Satin was trying to prompt the New Age and New Left to evolve into a " New Center " . But the revisions Satin introduces are substantial . Instead of defining politics as a means for creating the ideal society , as he did in New Age Politics , he defines radical middle politics as " idealism without illusions " – more creative and future @-@ oriented than politics @-@ as @-@ usual , but willing to face " the hard facts on the ground " . Rather than arguing that change will be brought about by a third force , he says most Americans are already radical middle – " we 're very practical folks , and we 're very idealistic and visionary as well . " 
 Although Satin argues in New Age Politics that Americans need to change their consciousness and decentralize their institutions , in Radical Middle he says they can build a good society if they adopt and live by Four Key Values : maximize choices for all Americans , give every American a fair start , maximize every American 's human potential , and help the peoples of the developing world . Instead of finding those values in the writings of contemporary theorists , Satin says they are just new versions of the values that inspired 18th @-@ century American revolutionaries : liberty , equality , pursuit @-@ of @-@ happiness , and fraternity , respectively . He calls Benjamin Franklin the radical middle 's favorite Founding Father , and says Franklin " wanted us to invent a uniquely American politics that served ordinary people by creatively borrowing from all points of view . " 
 In New Age Politics , Satin chooses not to focus on the details of public policy . In Radical Middle , however , Satin develops a raft of policy proposals rooted in the Four Key Values . ( Among them : universal access to private , preventive health insurance , class @-@ based rather than race @-@ based affirmative action , mandatory national service , and opening U.S. markets to more products from poor nations . ) In New Age Politics , Satin calls on " life @-@ oriented " people to become radical activists for a New Age society . In Radical Middle , Satin calls on people of every political stripe to work from within for social change congruent with the Four Key Values . 
 Satin 's mandatory national service proposal drew significant media coverage , in part because of his status as a draft <unk> . Satin argues that a draft could work in the United States if it applied to all young people , without exception , and if it gave everyone a choice in how they would serve . He proposes three service options : military ( with generous benefits ) , homeland security ( at prevailing wages ) , and community care ( at subsistence wages ) . On Voice of America radio , Satin presented his proposal as one drawing equally from the best of the left and the right . On National Public Radio , he emphasized its fairness . 
 Radical Middle provokes three kinds of responses : skeptical , pragmatic , and visionary . Skeptical respondents tend to find Satin 's beyond @-@ left @-@ and @-@ right policy proposals to be unrealistic and arrogant . For example , political writer Charles R. Morris says " Satin 's nostrums " echo the " <unk> and overweening self @-@ confidence ... in Roosevelt 's brain trust , or in John F. Kennedy 's . " Similarly , the policy director of the Democratic Leadership Council says Satin 's book " ultimately places him in the sturdy tradition of ' idealistic ' American reformers who think smart and principled people unencumbered by political constraints can change everything . " 
 Pragmatic observers tend to applaud Satin 's willingness to borrow good ideas from the left and the right . But these respondents are typically more drawn to Satin as a policy advocate – or as a counterweight to partisan militants like Ann Coulter – than they are to him as a political theorist . For example , Robert Olson of the World Future Society warns Satin against presenting the radical middle as a new ideology . 
 Visionary respondents typically appreciate Satin 's work as a policy advocate . But they also see him as attempting something rarer and , according to spiritual writer Carter Phipps , richer – raising politics to a higher level by synthesizing truths from all the political ideologies . Author Corinne McLaughlin identifies Satin as one of those creating an ideology about ideologies . She quotes him : 
 Coming up with a solution is not a matter of adopting correct political beliefs . It is , rather , a matter of learning to listen – really , listen – to everyone in the circle of humanity , and to take their insights into account . For everyone has a true and unique perspective on the whole . [ Many ] years ago the burning question was , How radical are you ? Hopefully someday soon the question will be , How much can you synthesize ? How much do you dare to take in ? 
 = = Later life = = 
 Life changed for Satin after writing and publicizing his Radical Middle book . In 2006 , at the age of 60 , he moved from Washington , D.C. , to the San Francisco Bay Area to reconcile with his father , from whom he had been estranged for 40 years . " With the perspective of time and experience , " Satin told one reporter , " I can see [ my father ] was not altogether out to lunch . " Later that year Satin discovered his only life partner . He describes it as " no accident " . 
 In 2009 Satin revealed he was losing his eyesight as a result of macular edema and diabetic retinopathy . He stopped producing Radical Middle Newsletter but expressed a desire to write a final political book . From 2009 to 2011 he presented occasional guest lectures on " life and political ideologies " in peace studies classes at the University of California , Berkeley . In 2015 he produced a " 40th Anniversary Edition " of his book New Age Politics . 
 = = Assessment = = 
 Satin has been a controversial public figure since the age of 20 . Assessments of his significance vary widely . 
 Some observers see him as an exemplary figure . David Armstrong , for example , in his study of independent American journalism , presents Satin as an embodiment of the " do @-@ it @-@ yourself spirit " that makes an independent press possible . Futurists Jessica <unk> and Jeffrey Stamps portray Satin as a pioneer " <unk> " who spent two years riding the bus across the U.S. in an attempt to connect like @-@ minded thinkers and activists . Marilyn Ferguson , author of The Aquarian Conspiracy , says that by engaging in a lifelong series of personal and political experiments with few resources , Satin is playing the role of the holy " Fool " for his time . 
 Other observers stress the freshness of Satin 's political vision . Social scientists Paul Ray and Sherry Anderson , for example , argue that Satin anticipated the perspectives of 21st century social movements better than nearly anyone . Humanistic psychologist John <unk> says Satin is one of the few political theorists to grasp the connection between personal growth and constructive political change . <unk> Greta Gaard claims that Satin " played a significant role in facilitating the articulation of Green political thought " . Peace researcher Hanna Newcombe finds a spiritual dimension in Satin 's politics . Political scientist Christa Slaton 's short list of " nonacademic " <unk> consists of Alvin and Heidi Toffler , Fritjof Capra , Marilyn Ferguson , Hazel Henderson , Betty Friedan , E. F. Schumacher , John Naisbitt , and Mark Satin . 
 Some see Satin as a classic example of the perpetual rebel and trace the cause back to his early years . For example , author Roger Neville Williams focuses on the harshness and " paternalistic rectitude " of Satin 's parents . Novelist Dan Wakefield , writing in The Atlantic , says Satin grew up in a small city in northern Minnesota like Bob Dylan but did not have a guitar to express himself with . According to historian Frank Kusch , the seeds for rebellion were planted when Satin 's parents moved him at age 16 from liberal Minnesota to still @-@ segregated Texas . 
 Although many observers praise or are intrigued by Satin , many find him dismaying . <unk> George <unk> , for example , remembers him as a publicity hound . Literary critic Dennis Duffy calls him incapable of learning from his experiences . Green Party activist Howie Hawkins sees him as a political opportunist . The Washington Monthly portrayed him in his 50s as a former New Age " guru " , and Commonweal compares reading him to listening to glass shards grate against a blackboard . 
 Other observers see Satin as an emotionally wounded figure . For example , historian Pierre Berton calls him a " footloose wanderer " and says that he hitchhiked across Canada 16 times . Culture critic Annie Gottlieb , who attributes Satin 's wounds to his struggle against the Vietnam War , points out that even as a successful newsletter publisher in Washington , DC , he paid himself the salary of a monk . 
 The major substantive criticisms of Satin 's work have remained constant over time . His ideas are sometimes said to be superficial ; they were characterized as childish in the 1960s , naive in the 1970s , poorly reasoned in the 1980s and 1990s , and overly simple in the 2000s . His ideas have also occasionally been seen as not politically serious , or as non @-@ political in the sense of not being capable of challenging existing power structures . His work is sometimes said to be largely borrowed from others , a charge that first surfaced with regard to his draft dodger manual , and was repeated to varying degree by critics of his books on New Age politics and radical centrism . 
 Satin has long been faulted for mixing views from different parts of his political odyssey . In the 1970s , for example , Toronto Star editor Robert Nielsen argued that Satin 's leftist pacifism warps his New Age vision . Three decades later , public @-@ policy analyst Gadi <unk> argued that Satin 's New Age emotionalism and impracticality blunt his radical @-@ centrist message . At 58 , Satin suggested his message could not be understood without appreciating all the strands of his personal and political journey : 
 From my New Left years I took a love of political struggle . From my New Age years I took a conviction that politics needs to be about more than endless struggle – that responsible human beings need to search for reconciliation and healing and mutually acceptable solutions . From my time in the legal profession I took an understanding ( and it is no small understanding ) that sincerity and passion are not enough – that to be truly effective in the world one needs to be credible and expert . … 
 Many Americans are living complicated lives now – few of us have moved through life in a straight line . I think many of us would benefit from trying to gather and synthesize the difficult political lessons we 've learned over the course of our lives .

 = Agnes von Mansfeld @-@ Eisleben = 
 Agnes von Mansfeld @-@ Eisleben ( 1551 – 1637 ) was Countess of Mansfeld and the daughter of Johann ( Hans ) Georg I , of Mansfeld Eisleben . She converted Gebhard , Seneschal of Waldburg , the Prince @-@ Elector of Electorate of Cologne and archbishop of the Diocese of Cologne to the Protestant faith , leading to the Cologne War ( 1583 – 1588 ) . 
 After a multiple year odyssey in which she and her husband sought refuge in several parts of northern Germany , Gebhard relinquished his claim on the Electorate . They settled in Strassbourg , where he had retained a position in the Cathedral chapter . After his death in 1601 , she came under the protection of the Duke of <unk> , who had himself been chased from his duchy . She died in 1637 . 
 = = Affair = = 
 Agnes was the daughter of Johann ( Hans ) Georg I , of Mansfeld Eisleben ( 1515 – 14 August 1579 ) , and his wife , Katharina of Mansfeld @-@ <unk> ( 1521 / 1525 – 1580 / 1583 ) . Although born and raised in the town of Mansfeld , in Saxony , as an adult , Agnes von Mansfeld Eisleben became a Protestant canoness at a cloister in Gerresheim , today a district of Düsseldorf . Agnes ' sister Sibilla lived in the city of Cologne , having married to the Freiherr ( baron ) Peter von <unk> ; although a member of the cloister , Agnes was not bound to it and was free during her days to move about the city . She visited Sibilla one day , and was noticed by the Elector of Cologne , Gebhard , Truchsess von Waldburg . Reportedly a beautiful woman ( she was also known as the lovely Mansfeld girl ) he sought her out , and they started a liaison . Two of her brothers , Hoyer and Ernst , visited Gebhard at the archbishop 's palace in the electoral capital of Bonn , and convinced him to marry her . 
 She insisted Gebhard first convert to Calvinism . The difficulties of a conversion by a Catholic Archbishop and Prince @-@ elector of the Holy Roman Empire had been faced before : Hermann von Wied had also converted to Protestantism , and had resigned from his office . Similarly , Gebhard 's immediate predecessor , Salentin IX of Isenburg @-@ Grenzau had resigned to marry when it appeared his family line would become extinct . Initially , it appeared that Gebhard would resign . However , several of his associates in the Cathedral chapter convinced him that he could have the lady and the Electorate . Before Christmas in 1582 , he proclaimed the Reformation from the pulpit in Cologne , establishing Protestantism on parity with Catholicism in the archdiocese . 
 This declaration of parity between Protestantism and Catholics in an electoral territory contravened the Religious Peace of Augsburg established in 1555 . In this document , to which the all the Estates of the Holy Roman Empire agreed , confirmed the co @-@ existence of Lutheranism and Catholicism in select polities were both religious were already established ; in all other regions , the principle of Cuius regio , eius religio ( loosely translated from Latin as " Whose realm , his religion " ) confirmed the religion of the reigning sovereign to be the religion of his subjects . Any other Christian religious practice , such as Calvinism , was considered heresy . 
 = = = Unlikely match = = = 
 Gebhard 's conversion under the influence of Agnes caused more than a ripple of scandal in the aristocratic circles of the Holy Roman Empire . Descended as he was from the hereditary seneschals of Waldburg , Gebhard came from a line of stalwart Catholic defenders of what was considered the universal faith . One of his uncles was the bishop of Augsburg ; his grandfather 's brother had been a general in the German Peasants ' War of 1525 and instrumental in the destruction of the German Peasant army . The family had been long @-@ time supporters of Habsburg dynastic aspirations and policies , and key advisers for in the often @-@ troubled Imperial relationships with the Swabian Imperial circle ( Kreis ) . Gebhard himself had been raised in a Catholic tradition , and strongly influenced by the Jesuits in his education . His career had been solely focused on obtaining a preferential position in the ecclesiastical hierarchy , and his election as the archbishop of Cologne , in a close contest with the equally @-@ qualified Wittelsbach candidate , attested not to the diligence and application of his personal faith , but his family 's Imperial influence . 
 On the other side of the relationship , Agnes came from a family of dedicated Lutherans ; the town in which she was born and raised , and whose name she bore , Eisleben , was also Martin Luther 's home town . Her father and her uncles had been signatories of the Book of Concord , established in 1580 as the doctrinal standard of the Lutheran faith . Luther himself had negotiated a settlement to a disagreement between her uncles and her brothers over inheritance and succession issues . Her placement in the religious community at Gerresheim was a factor of her nobility and her family 's connections ; although she came from the impoverished side of the old Mansfeld house , her family continued to wield influence in Imperial , Saxon , and religious circles , although it is unclear why she was placed in a Calvinist convent . 
 The marriage of this seeming unlikely pair caused a scandal throughout the Empire . At 27 @-@ years @-@ of @-@ age , Gebhard had apparently abjured the matrimonial life in his acceptance of the church career often reserved for a second or third son of noble families . If he had converted to Lutheranism and resigned from his electoral and episcopal responsibilities , the marriage might have made a ripple in social circles , but his refusal to give up his electoral and episcopal responsibilities , his declaration of the electorate as henceforth a dynastic property , however , made his marriage of utmost political importance . Furthermore , his conversion to Calvinism was heresy , because Calvinism was not one of the two legal professions of faith accepted by the Peace of Augsburg in 1556 . 
 = = War = = 
 News of the pending marriage became public in late November 1582 , but it was still unclear what Gebhard would do . Precedent suggested he would resign prior to his marriage , but rumors abounded that he would convert the Electorate to Protestantism , perhaps forcibly . Throughout the Electorate , and on its borders , his supporters and opponents gathered their troops , armed their garrisons , stockpiled food , and prepared for war . On 19 December 1582 , Gebhard announced his conversion , from , as he phrased it , the " darkness of the papacy to the Light " of the Word of God . His proclamation of the Reformation from the Cathedral pulpit in the Imperial City of Cologne established Calvinism as a religious option in the Electorate . He also intended to convert the electorate into a dynastic property generated an uproar among the other Prince @-@ electors . The transformation of an important ecclesiastical territory into a secular , dynastic duchy would then bring the principle of cuius regio , eius religio into play in the Electorate . Under this principle , all of Gebhard 's subjects would be required to convert to his faith : his rule , his religion . 
 The conversion of the Archbishop of Cologne to Protestantism also triggered religious and political repercussions throughout the Holy Roman Empire . Gebhard 's conversion had widespread implications for the future of the Holy Roman Empire 's electoral process , established by the Golden Bull of 1356 . The council continued for more than a year , and eventually moved to other cities ; although several times they seemed close to negotiating a conclusion to the crisis , a successful agreement remained beyond their reach . They also offered Gebhard a sum of money to relinquish his claim , which he refused on the high moral grounds of religious principle . 
 Agnes and Gebhard married on 2 February 1583 in Bonn and retired to the Elector 's country seat in Poppelsdorf to celebrate their nuptials . Within weeks , the Cathedral chapter had deposed Gebhard , electing in his place an old opponent , Ernst of Bavaria , the brother of Wilhelm V , Duke of Bavaria , who immediately set about raising an army with the help of his brother the duke , and his second brother , Ferdinand of Bavaria . In the spring and summer , Agnes and Gebhard did likewise , traveling to different parts of the electorate , raising an army , and extending the Protestant cause . By October , Ernst 's brother Ferdinand entered the electorate from the south , near Koblenz . In their northward progress , they left a path of fire and destruction . Agnes and Gebhard fled , as Poppelsdorf , then Godesberg , and later the capital city of the electorate , Bonn , were over @-@ run and destroyed . 
 Initially , the couple fled to Vest Recklinghausen , a fiefdom of the Electorate . There , Agnes and Gebhard encouraged an outbreak of iconoclasm that destroyed many well @-@ known and beloved religious sites ; the Reformation had already been wrought in Vest and Recklinghausen , and many of the inhabitants had converted to the new faith . The burst of iconoclastic energy , indulged predominantly by Gebhard 's troops and not by the inhabitants themselves , alienated the residents from Gebhard , his wife , and their cause . With local support , Catholic armies chased the couple from Vest Recklinghausen later in the year . Gebhard and Agnes escaped with approximately 1000 cavalry and some infantry . 
 A multiple year odyssey followed , as Agnes and her husband sought refuge in the northern territories of the Electorate at the castle Arensberg , and later at the city of Delft , with William I of Orange . Living in the Netherlands , they became acquainted with Elizabeth 's envoy , Robert Dudley , 1st Earl of Leicester , and entered into lengthy negotiations with Elizabeth 's Court to obtain support for Gebhard 's cause ; these efforts failed to garner assistance for renewing the war either from the English queen or in any other quarter . In 1585 , Agnes reportedly traveled to England in a futile effort to seek assistance from Elizabeth I , but this claim has been refuted by modern scholars . 
 After his once prosperous electorate was ruined by war , Gebhard relinquished his claim on it in 1588 . Ernst of Bavaria , had recruited the assistance of Alexander Farnese , Duke of Parma . By some twist of fate , her first cousin , Karl von Mansfeld , was in the service of the Duke of Parma at the Destruction of Neuss , a critical battle that turned the tide of war against her husband . 
 = = Peace in Strassbourg = = 
 In 1589 , they could not return to the Electorate territories , which her husband had relinquished , nor could she , a married lady , return to the convent at Gerresheim . They sought refuge in Strassbourg , a stronghold of Calvinism . Gebhard had been a member of the Cathedral Chapter there since 1576 . Three other canons from Cologne had also taken refuge in Strassbourg after 1583 . Shortly after their marriage in 1583 , Gebhard had written his Testament in which he left his estate to his brother , Karl , and a life @-@ time annuity to Agnes , and charged Karl with her safety and protection . Karl died on 18 June 1593 , and was buried in the Strasbourg cathedral ; Gebhard wrote a codicil leaving Agnes to the care and protection of the Dukes of Württemberg . Gebhard died on 21 May 1601 . Until her death in 1637 , she lived under the protection of the Dukes , first Friedrich I , later Johann Friedrich and then his son Eberhard . She was buried in Sulzbach .

 Stuart Charles Tomlinson ( born 22 May 1985 ) is an English professional wrestler and retired professional football goalkeeper . He is signed to WWE , where he performs under the ring name Hugo Knox . 
 As a footballer , Tomlinson progressed from the Crewe Alexandra youth team to turn professional in 2003 . He spent the next six years with the club , spending part of 2004 on loan at Stafford Rangers , and playing once on loan for Burton Albion in 2008 . He spent the 2009 – 10 campaign at Conference club Barrow , where he shared goalkeeping responsibilities with Tim Deasy . He then signed with Port Vale , and was favoured ahead of Chris Martin for the 2010 – 11 and 2011 – 12 campaigns , before choosing to leave the club in July 2012 . He signed with Burton Albion in September 2012 , but retired through injury in July 2013 . 
 In December 2013 , Tomlinson began training as a professional wrestler on a developmental contract with WWE , making his debut at a WWE NXT live event on 8 November 2014 . 
 = = Football career = = 
 = = = Crewe Alexandra = = = 
 Having graduated through the club 's youth academy , Tomlinson made his senior debut for Crewe Alexandra in a Second Division clash with Oldham Athletic on 25 January 2003 , replacing Danny Milosevic on 51 minutes after the Australian suffered an injury . He conceded a goal to Chris Armstrong after his view was obscured by a group of players , though Crewe ran out 3 – 1 winners at Boundary Park . At the end of the season he signed his first professional contract , and Crewe were promoted into the First Division as runners up in the Second Division . 
 His second game came on 17 March 2004 at the Boleyn Ground ; he replaced Clayton Ince after 86 minutes with the score 4 – 2 to West Ham United , after Ince was stretchered off with a knee injury . The eighteen @-@ year @-@ old held his nerve in front of over 30 @,@ 000 spectators and no goals were scored in the brief period he was on the pitch . Later in the year he had a loan spell at local non @-@ league side Stafford Rangers . 
 After recovering from a twisted ankle , Tomlinson 's next senior game was at Sincil Bank on 23 August 2005 , where he replaced loanee Ben Williams at half @-@ time . Lincoln City knocked the " Railwaymen " out of the League Cup , putting two past Williams and three past Tomlinson for a 5 – 2 victory . His first start came in the FA Cup Third Round clash at Deepdale on 7 January 2006 , the home side coming out 2 – 1 winners . He played his first Championship game on 28 January , replacing Ross Turnbull at half @-@ time ; Watford put two past each men for a 4 – 1 win . After signing a one @-@ year contract extension in March , Tomlinson got his first league start on 30 April , as Crewe beat Millwall 4 – 2 , Ben May scoring both of the " Lions " goals . 
 In May 2006 , Burton Albion put in a request to sign Tomlinson to a season long loan . The move was delayed after Tomlinson picked up a calf injury , before he managed to join Burton in time for a pre @-@ season friendly with Sheffield Wednesday . However Crewe reconsidered the loan deal and so Nigel Clough instead signed aged veteran Kevin Poole . Clough was still keen to sign Tomlinson , with the saga continuing well into the season , though no deal was made . Tomlinson picked up his first senior clean sheet on 22 August 2006 , during a 3 – 0 win at Grimsby Town 's Blundell Park in the League Cup First Round . The Crewe website described a " heroic effort " from Tomlinson in the Football League Trophy tie with Rochdale on 31 October , as he managed to three of Rochdale 's four penalties ( the penalty he did not save was a miss ) . Dario Gradi said : " Stuart is outstanding on penalties because he is positive and doesn 't flop over " . He went on to play seven League One games , and also made one appearance in the FA Cup . However he did not play in the 2007 end of the season , partly due to a torn groin that kept him out of action for a number of weeks . In the summer there was once again talk of a possible loan move to Burton . 
 He was only used by Steve Holland once throughout the 2007 – 08 season , playing in a 1 – 1 draw with Chester City in the Football League Trophy on 4 September ; Chester won the game 4 – 3 on penalties . Not long after this he was on the sidelines with a broken thumb . In February , Tomlinson finally joined Conference club Burton Albion on a one @-@ month loan . He played 90 minutes for " Brewers " in a 3 – 1 defeat to Histon on 1 March , and was forced to make numerous saves . He played no further part of Burton 's season after he sustained an injury to his cruciate ligaments . 
 After six months of rehab he recovered earlier than expected . His 2008 – 09 season started on 25 November , as Gradi gave him a start at the Walkers Stadium , where Leicester City won 2 – 1 . The next month he played six games , keeping four clean sheets ( against Carlisle United , Cheltenham Town , Swindon Town and Millwall ) . However he attracted criticism from his manager at the end of January following heavy defeats to Northampton Town and Peterborough United , and was subsequently dropped . New manager Gudjon Thordarson told him that he would not be offered a new contract at the end of the season , thus ending Tomlinson 's long association with the club . 
 = = = Barrow = = = 
 In July 2009 he joined Port Vale for pre @-@ season training , playing 45 minutes of a pre @-@ season friendly . Micky Adams considered signing Tomlinson up whilst first choice keeper Joe <unk> was out injured . He impressed on his trial and would have been signed to a contract if the cash @-@ strapped club could find the finance , instead Adams considered offering Tomlinson non @-@ contract terms . However , Tomlinson left the club to search for a more permanent offer elsewhere . In August 2009 he joined Barrow of the Conference , just two days before the start of their season . Sharing first team duties with Tim Deasy , he appeared 27 times for Barrow in the 2009 – 10 campaign . He also won the FA Trophy with the club , appearing in the final at Wembley Stadium , where the " Bluebirds " beat Stevenage Borough 2 – 1 . 
 = = = Port Vale = = = 
 Tomlinson chose not to renew his Barrow contract at the end of the season , and instead signed a one @-@ year contract at Port Vale in May 2010 . <unk> had at by this time left Vale Park for Lincoln City , and Tomlinson was brought into provide competition for teenager Chris Martin . This required him to accept a lower wage than he would have got at Barrow . 
 – Micky Adams on Tomlinson . 
 Adams surprised many by selecting Tomlinson as the goalkeeper in the opening game of the season , and Tomlinson rewarded his manager by keeping a clean sheet . Tomlinson praised his defence for his solid start to the season . With five clean sheets in his first ten games , Tomlinson was offered a one @-@ year contract extension in September 2010 . Two months later he was reported in the Daily Star and the Daily Mirror to be a £ 250 @,@ 000 transfer target for Sheffield United and Queens Park Rangers . Adams dismissed such speculation with the comment " that amount of money wouldn 't buy Stuart 's left hand " . Sent off on New Year 's Day after a collision with Rotherham United 's Marcus Marshall , Tomlinson lost his place in the first eleven due to injury and suspension , but then won back his place after Martin conceded a comical own goal in a 3 – 1 defeat to Stevenage on 22 February . It was an eventful return for Tomlinson , who broke the story of Jim Gannon and Geoff Horsfield 's bust @-@ up on the pre @-@ match coach trip to Aldershot via Twitter . The game itself was also eventful , as Tomlinson gave away a penalty , which he then saved , only to leave the pitch due to a hip injury . Martin regained his first team place after the game , only to be replaced by Tomlinson at half @-@ time during a 2 – 1 loss at home to Oxford United on 12 March , after Martin committed another blunder . 
 Following the return of Micky Adams as Port Vale manager , Tomlinson held on to his first team place at the start of the 2011 – 12 season , though Martin was used in cup games . Neither Tomlinson or Martin could find the consistency to secure their first team place though ; Tomlinson conceded twelve goals in his first seven games of the season , whilst Martin conceded ten times in his first five games . Assistant manager Mark Grew told the media that " they 've both been disappointing " . On 29 October , Tomlinson was embarrassed to be caught off his line by Oxford United 's Peter Leven , who found the net with a ' sensational 45 @-@ yard strike ' .

" He was still preferred to Martin though , and only a thigh injury kept him out of two league games in January . He returned to the first team , and was heading for a third consecutive clean sheet on 14 February when he committed an " injury @-@ time howler " to allow Bradford City a share of the points at Valley Parade . On 10 March he spilled a cross to hand Barnet striker Ben May an easy winner at Vale Park . He vowed to improve his consistency , saying " I 'm a pretty confident person and it will take a lot to stop me bouncing back . " At the end of the season he rejected the club 's offer of a new contract , and his departure was announced on 3 July . He said that he was " not particularly worried " about his free agent status , and that he would turn down similar offers from other clubs and wait until as late as the start of the following season until the " right opportunity " came about .

 In September 2012 , Tomlinson signed a four @-@ month contract with Burton Albion , having previously been on trial at Preston North End . He joined the " Brewers " after manager Gary Rowett was dissatisfied with the performances of Ross Atkins and Dean Lyness . After keeping a clean sheet on his debut , in a 1 – 0 win over Rochdale at Spotland on 8 September , assistant manager Kevin Summerfield said that " the biggest difference for me was that we were playing the game in their half and they were defending corners because he [ Tomlinson ] can kick the ball so far up the pitch " . He was aiming for a longer stay at the Pirelli Stadium , but a knee injury sustained in a home draw with former club Port Vale left him sidelined for up to six months . He recovered to full fitness in half that time , and signed a new contract in February to extend his stay at Burton until summer 2014 . Burton reached the play @-@ offs at the end of the 2012 – 13 season , but were defeated 5 – 4 by Bradford City at the semi @-@ final stage . Tomlinson retired in July 2013 after surgeons advised him that scar tissue damage and a tear in his anterior cruciate ligament meant that his left knee was in poor shape and was vulnerable to further damage .

 = USS Wichita ( CA @-@ 45 ) = 
 USS Wichita ( CA @-@ 45 ) was a unique heavy cruiser of the United States Navy built in the 1930s . The last American cruiser designed to meet the limits of London Naval Treaty , she was originally intended to be a New Orleans @-@ class heavy cruiser , accordingly with the maximum main armament of three triple 8 @-@ inch ( 200 mm ) gun turrets . These were instead placed on an improved hull derived from the Brooklyn @-@ class light cruisers , with increased armoring . This design would go on to form the basis for the later World War II @-@ era heavy cruisers such as the Baltimore @-@ class cruisers . The ship was authorized by the 1929 Cruiser Act , laid down at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in October 1935 , launched in November 1937 , and commissioned into the US Navy in February 1939 . 
 Following her commissioning , Wichita was assigned to neutrality patrols in the Atlantic . After the United States entered World War II , the ship saw heavy service throughout the conflict . She was first assigned to convoy escort duty on the Murmansk Run in early 1942 , and supported amphibious landings during Operation Torch in November 1942 . During the Naval Battle of Casablanca , Wichita engaged several French coastal batteries and warships , including the battleship Jean Bart. In 1943 , Wichita was transferred to the Pacific Theater , where she remained for the rest of the war . She frequently provided antiaircraft defense for the Fast Carrier Task Force during operations in the central Pacific , including the Battles of the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf in 1944 . During the latter engagement , Wichita assisted in the sinking of the Japanese aircraft carrier Chiyoda . 
 Wichita was heavily engaged during the invasion of Okinawa , where she provided heavy gunfire support to ground troops ashore . After the Japanese surrender , the ship served as part of the occupation force in Japan and assisted in the repatriation of American military personnel under Operation Magic Carpet . After returning to the United States , she was decommissioned and placed in the mothball fleet in 1946 . She remained in reserve until 1959 , when she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and sold for scrapping in August 1959 . 
 = = Design = = 
 In the early 1930s , the Secretary of the Navy , Curtis D. Wilbur , pushed for a new construction program for light and heavy cruisers . Wilbur succeeded in passing the Cruiser Act in 1929 , which authorized several new cruisers . Five heavy cruisers , the last of which was Wichita , were ordered between 1931 and 1934 . Wichita was the last heavy cruiser permitted under the terms of the London Naval Treaty in 1930 , which limited the US to 18 heavy cruisers with a maximum standard displacement of 10 @,@ 000 long tons ( 10 @,@ 160 t ) . The ship was originally intended to be built to the design of the New Orleans class , but the design was reworked before construction began . Instead , the design for Wichita was based on the Brooklyn class of light cruisers . The Brooklyn design was modified heavily , to give the new ship higher freeboard and better stability , and an increased cruising radius . The secondary battery of eight 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) guns was identical in number to the light cruisers , but was arranged to give better fields of fire . The main battery of nine 8 @-@ inch ( 200 mm ) guns was mounted in a new gun turret design that rectified problems discovered in earlier cruisers . 
 Wichita was laid down at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 28 October 1935 , and launched on 16 November 1937 . By the time she was completed , in February 1938 , Wichita was nearly over the 10 @,@ 000 @-@ ton limit ; as a result , she was completed with only two of the eight 5 @-@ inch guns to keep her under the displacement restriction . When the rest of the 5 @-@ inch guns were installed , it was found that the ship was too top @-@ heavy , and so 200 long tons ( 200 t ) of pig iron had to be added to her bottom to balance the cruiser . Wichita was commissioned into the US Navy on 16 February 1939 . Her first commander was Captain Thaddeus A. Thomson . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 Wichita was 600 feet ( 180 m ) long at the waterline and 608 ft 4 in ( 185 @.@ 42 m ) long overall . She had a beam of 61 ft 9 in ( 18 @.@ 82 m ) and a draft of 23 ft 9 in ( 7 @.@ 24 m ) . She displaced 10 @,@ 589 long tons ( 10 @,@ 759 t ) at standard displacement and 13 @,@ 015 long tons ( 13 @,@ 224 t ) at full combat load . The ship had a crew of 929 officers and enlisted men . She was equipped with four seaplanes and a pair of aircraft catapults and a crane for handling the aircraft which were mounted on the stern . Wichita was powered by four Parsons steam turbines and eight Babcock & Wilcox oil @-@ fired water @-@ tube boilers . The propulsion system was rated at 100 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 75 @,@ 000 kW ) and a top speed of 33 knots ( 61 km / h ; 38 mph ) . She carried 1 @,@ 323 to 1 @,@ 984 long tons ( 1 @,@ 344 to 2 @,@ 016 t ) of fuel oil , which gave her a maximum cruising range of 10 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 19 @,@ 000 km ; 12 @,@ 000 mi ) at 15 kn ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . 
 The hull was protected by a waterline armored belt composed of Class A armor that was 6 @.@ 4 in ( 160 mm ) thick amidships . It was reduced to 4 in ( 100 mm ) thick on either end . The belt was backed with .63 in ( 16 mm ) of special treatment steel . The Class A steel was significantly more effective than the Class B armor used in earlier cruisers ; 8 @-@ inch guns had to be within 10 @,@ 000 yards ( 9 @,@ 100 m ) to penetrate the belt , as opposed to 16 @,@ 400 yd ( 15 @,@ 000 m ) for the earlier armor . Wichita had a 2 @.@ 25 in ( 57 mm ) thick deck , which was immune to 8 @-@ inch fire inside 22 @,@ 000 yd ( 20 @,@ 000 m ) . The conning tower had 6 in ( 150 mm ) thick sides and a 2 @.@ 25 in thick roof . The ship 's main battery turrets had 8 in ( 200 mm ) thick faces , 3 @.@ 75 in ( 95 mm ) thick sides , 1 @.@ 5 in ( 38 mm ) thick rears , and 2 @.@ 75 in ( 70 mm ) thick roofs . The turrets were mounted on armored barbettes protected with 7 in ( 180 mm ) of armor plating . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Wichita was armed with a main battery of nine 8 @-@ inch / 55 Mark 12 guns mounted in three 3 @-@ gun turrets . The guns fired a 335 @-@ pound ( 152 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 500 feet per second ( 760 m / s ) . Maximum elevation of the guns was 41 degrees ; this provided a maximum range of 30 @,@ 050 yd ( 27 @,@ 480 m ) . Rate of fire was approximately one shot every fifteen seconds . The turrets allowed each gun to elevate and fire individually . Her secondary battery consisted of eight 5 @-@ inch / 38 Mark 12 dual @-@ purpose guns , four in single , enclosed Mark 30 high @-@ angle mounts , and four in open mounts . These guns fired 55 lb ( 25 kg ) projectiles at a rate of 20 rounds per minute . Muzzle velocity was 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ( 790 m / s ) ; against aerial targets , the guns had a ceiling of 37 @,@ 200 ft ( 11 @,@ 300 m ) at 85 degrees . At 45 degrees , the guns could engage surface targets at a range of 18 @,@ 200 yd ( 16 @,@ 600 m ) . Wichita was the first cruiser in the US Navy to be equipped with the new 5 @-@ inch / 38 gun . 
 By August 1945 , the ship had been equipped with numerous smaller guns for close @-@ range anti @-@ aircraft defense . Sixteen Bofors 40 mm guns were placed in quadruple mounts , and another eight were in dual mounts . She also carried eighteen Oerlikon 20 mm guns in single mountings . The 40 mm guns had a ceiling of 22 @,@ 800 ft ( 6 @,@ 900 m ) at 90 degrees elevation and a maximum rate of fire of 160 rounds per minute . The 20 mm gun had a rate of fire of 465 – 480 rounds per minute ; they had a ceiling of 10 @,@ 000 ft ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) . By the end of the war , the ship was armed with a variety of fire control systems for her guns , including Mark 34 fire control gear and Mark 13 and Mark 28 fire control radars .

 Wichita departed Philadelphia after her commissioning , bound for Houston , Texas . She arrived on 20 April 1939 and took part in the dedicatory and memorial service at the San Jacinto Battle Monument and War Relic Museum . The ship left Houston on 1 May for her shakedown cruise , during which she visited the Virgin Islands , Cuba , and the Bahamas before she returned to Philadelphia for post @-@ shakedown repairs . On 25 September , a few weeks after the outbreak of World War II in Europe , Wichita was assigned to Cruiser Division 7 in the Atlantic Squadron , based in the Hampton Roads . She conducted her first neutrality patrol on 4 – 9 October . After returning to port , she went into dock at the Norfolk Navy Yard for maintenance , which lasted until 1 December . On 4 December , Wichita steamed to Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , arriving on the 8th . There , Thomson assumed command of the newly formed Caribbean Patrol , which included Wichita and the cruiser Vincennes , and the destroyers Borie , Broome , Lawrence , King , and Truxtun , and Navy patrol squadrons VP @-@ 33 and VP @-@ 51 . Over the course of the next three months , the force conducted a series of training maneuvers in the Caribbean . At the end of February , Wichita returned to Norfolk via Philadelphia , where she participated in further training through May . 
 Starting in June , Wichita and Quincy conducted a goodwill cruise to South America ; Wichita carried Rear Admiral Andrew C. Pickens , the commander of Cruiser Division 7 . Included in the ports of call were Rio de Janeiro and Santos in Brazil , Buenos Aires , Argentina , and Montevideo , Uruguay . The cruise ended in late September ; the two cruisers arrived in Norfolk on the 24th . Over the next three months , Wichita served as a training ship for Naval Reserve midshipmen and conducted gunnery practices off the Virginia capes . On 7 January 1941 , Wichita departed Hampton Roads for Guantanamo , arriving four days later . She participated in fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean through March and took part in practice amphibious landings at Puerto Rico . She returned to the United States , docking at the New York Navy Yard , on 23 March . Wichita went to sea again on 6 April , bound for Bermuda ; she reached her destination two days later . She then joined the aircraft carrier Ranger and the heavy cruiser Tuscaloosa for a patrol in the North Atlantic , during which the ships sailed to within 800 nautical miles ( 1 @,@ 500 km ; 920 mi ) of Ireland . 
 Wichita then returned to the New York Navy Yard on 17 May and went into drydock on 21 June . Repairs were completed on 2 July , after which Wichita was transferred to Newport , Rhode Island . She sortied again on 27 July bound for Iceland as part of Task Force 16 under Operation Indigo II , the occupation of Iceland . Wichita arrived in Reykjavík on 6 August , along with the carrier Wasp and the battleship Mississippi . The task force landed a contingent of US Army troops and fighter aircraft to provide air support . The cruiser returned to the United States by 20 August . Wichita returned to Iceland in September , arriving in Reykjavík on 28 September . Two days prior to Wichita 's arrival , the US Navy ordered the units of the Atlantic Fleet to protect all ships engaged in commerce in United States defensive waters . The orders authorized the Navy to patrol , escort merchantmen , and attack any German or Italian naval forces encountered . Wichita was assigned to Task Group 7 @.@ 5 , which was engaged in patrolling Icelandic waters through the end 1941 . On 7 December 1941 , the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor , bringing the United States into World War II ; on the day of the attack , Wichita lay at anchor at Hvalfjörður , Iceland . 
 = = = Atlantic theater = = = 
 Wichita left port on 5 January 1942 for training and a patrol in the Denmark Strait ; she returned to Hvalfjörður on 10 January . On the 15th , a powerful storm , with sustained winds of 80 knots ( 150 km / h ; 92 mph ) and gusts up to 100 kn ( 190 km / h ; 120 mph ) , hit Iceland . Wichita was damaged by the storm , including a collision with the freighter West Nohno and the British trawler Ebor Wyke . She then ran aground off <unk> Light . The following day , the ship 's crew evaluated her condition ; she had suffered minor damage from the collisions , including some leaks , and damage to the hull from the grounding . Temporary repairs were effected in Iceland to allow Wichita to return to the New York Navy Yard for more thorough repairs . She arrived on 9 February , and repairs lasted until 26 February , when she left port for training maneuvers off Maine in early March . 
 On 26 March , Wichita , assigned to Task Force 39 , departed the United States to reinforce the British Home Fleet based in Scapa Flow . Task Force 39 , commanded by Rear Admiral John W. Wilcox , Jr . , included Wasp , the battleship Washington , the cruiser Tuscaloosa , and eight destroyers . While en route , Wilcox was swept overboard in a heavy sea and lost . Rear Admiral Robert C. Giffen , who flew his flag in Wichita , took command of the task force . After arriving in Scapa Flow , Wichita and the other American ships spent several weeks training with their British counterparts . On 28 April , Wichita departed on her first major operation with the British . She was assigned to the Allied escort for the Arctic convoys QP 11 and PQ 15 . The American component , organized as Task Force 99 , comprised Washington , Wichita , Tuscaloosa , and four destroyers . The British assigned the carrier Victorious , the battleship King George V , a light cruiser , and five destroyers . After successfully escorting the convoys , Wichita returned to Hvalfjörður , arriving on 6 May . 
 Wichita sortied on 12 May to relieve Tuscaloosa , which was patrolling the Denmark Strait . Wichita returned to Hvalfjörður a week later , before putting to sea as part of another Allied convoy escort protecting one leg of the movement of Murmansk @-@ bound convoy PQ 16 and eastbound QP 12 . She put in to Scapa Flow on 29 May after completing the mission . While in Scapa Flow , King George VI inspected Wichita on 7 June . Wichita left Scapa Flow on 12 June , bound for Hvalfjörður , and arrived 14 June . She then relieved the British cruiser Cumberland on patrol in the Denmark Strait . While on patrol on 17 June , Wichita spotted a German Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 200 reconnaissance bomber and opened fire , though without result . Three days later , she engaged another Fw 200 , again without success . 
 After returning to Hvalfjörður , Wichita steamed to Seidisfjord at the end of June , where she joined Tuscaloosa and three destroyers . They were assigned to the escort for the convoy PQ 17 . The convoy escort also included Washington , Victorious , and the battleship Duke of York . The Germans organized a powerful task force , centered on the battleship Tirpitz and three heavy cruisers , to attack the convoy ; the operation was codenamed Rösselsprung ( Knight 's Move ) . Swedish intelligence had meanwhile reported the German departures to the British Admiralty , which ordered the convoy to disperse . Aware that they had been detected , the Germans aborted the operation and turned over the attack to U @-@ boats and the Luftwaffe . The scattered vessels could no longer be protected by the convoy escorts , and the Germans sank 21 of the 34 isolated transports . The next day , while south of Spitzbergen , the ships were spotted and shadowed by a pair of Fw 200s . Both Wichita and Tuscaloosa opened fire with their antiaircraft guns , but the Fw 200s escaped without damage . 
 In late July , Wichita went into drydock at the Royal Navy base in Rosyth , Scotland . Repairs , which included correcting a propeller shaft vibration , lasted from 24 July until 9 August . The repairs to the propeller shaft were ineffective , however , which necessitated a return to the United States . She reached the New York Navy Yard on 22 August for repairs , which lasted until 5 September . She completed a round of post @-@ repair sea trials before conducting gunnery exercises in the Chesapeake Bay . Wichita conducted training off the Virginia Capes for the rest of the month , after which she steamed to Casco Bay in Maine for further maneuvers .

 At the end of October , Wichita was assigned to Task Group 34 @.@ 1 , under the command of Rear Admiral H. Kent Hewitt , who flew his flag in Augusta . The Task Group also included the battleship Massachusetts and Tuscaloosa . The ships were assigned to provide gunfire support for Operation Torch , the invasion of French North Africa . Wichita participated in the Naval Battle of Casablanca , which began early on the morning of 8 November . The ships were tasked with neutralizing the primary French defenses , which included coastal guns on El Hank , several submarines , and the incomplete battleship Jean Bart which lay at anchor in the harbor . Wichita and Tuscaloosa initially engaged the French batteries on El Hank and the French submarine pens , while Massachusetts attacked Jean Bart. French naval forces , led by the cruiser Primauguet , put up a stubborn defense . 
 In response , the French launched a pair of attacks to break up the American landings . During the first French attack , either Wichita or Tuscaloosa damaged the French destroyer Milan and forced it aground . A second French attack was also defeated ; one of the two cruisers sank the destroyer Fougueux and damaged <unk> . Wichita , Tuscaloosa , and Massachusetts also engaged Jean Bart. At 11 : 28 , Wichita was hit by a 194 mm ( 7 @.@ 6 in ) shell , fired by a gun on El Hank . The shell penetrated her deck and exploded below , injuring fourteen men . Hewitt broke off the attack temporarily , but by 13 : 12 , several American warships began firing on French vessels exiting the harbor . Wichita and Tuscaloosa closed on the port to engage the cruisers Primauguet and Gloire , still in the harbor . Heavy fire from El Hank forced the American cruisers to retreat shortly after 15 : 00 . For the remainder of the operations off North Africa , Wichita patrolled between Casablanca and <unk> . Her part in the amphibious assault complete , Wichita departed the area on 12 November , bound for New York for repairs ; she arrived on 19 November . 
 = = = Pacific theater = = = 
 Shortly after repairs were completed , Wichita was transferred to the Pacific theater . She was assigned to Task Force 18 , commanded by Rear Admiral Giffen , and tasked with operations off Guadalcanal . She was joined by the heavy cruisers Louisville and Chicago , the light cruisers Montpelier , Cleveland , and Columbia . In addition , the escort carriers Chenango and Suwannee , and eight destroyers were present in the task group . On the night of 29 January 1943 , the Task Force was steaming off Rennell Island ; wary of the threat from Japanese submarines , which Allied intelligence indicated were likely in the area , Giffen arranged his cruisers and destroyers for anti @-@ submarine defense , not expecting an air attack . The cruisers were aligned in two columns , spaced 2 @,@ 500 yd ( 2 @,@ 300 m ) apart . Wichita , Chicago , and Louisville , in that order , were to starboard , and Montpelier , Cleveland , and Columbia were to port . The six destroyers were in a semicircle 2 mi ( 1 @.@ 7 nmi ; 3 @.@ 2 km ) ahead of the cruiser columns . That evening , the ships came under attack from Japanese torpedo bombers . In the ensuing Battle of Rennell Island , Chicago was hit by several torpedoes and sunk ; Wichita was hit by one torpedo , though it failed to explode . 
 Wichita then steamed to Efate in the New Hebrides for a training period . She then departed on 7 April , bound for Pearl Harbor and arriving there a week later . On 18 April , she steamed out of Pearl Harbor for Adak , Alaska , again flying Giffen 's flag , for Task Group 52 @.@ 10 . In early May , Wichita was assigned to the amphibious force tasked with liberating the Aleutian Islands from Japanese control . She served as the flagship of the northern covering force , along with the cruisers Louisville and San Francisco and four destroyers . On 6 July , Wichita , three other cruisers , and four destroyers bombarded Japanese positions on the island of Kiska . The bombardment convinced the Japanese that the Americans intended to invade the island in the near future ; they therefore planned an evacuation by July . 
 On 19 July , a powerful American fleet , including the battleships New Mexico , Idaho , and Mississippi joined Wichita to conduct another attack on Kiska three days later . Five days later , malfunctioning radar equipment led to a battle with radar phantoms ( the " Battle of the Pips " ) ; Wichita , two battleships , and two other cruisers expended over a thousand rounds of ammunition from their main batteries on the empty sea . That same day , the Japanese successfully evacuated the island , which was invaded by American troops two weeks later . The morning after the assumed engagement , Wichita launched a seaplane to reconnoiter the area , but found no evidence of Japanese forces . 
 Wichita participated in exercises off Hawaii for the remainder of the year . On 16 January 1944 , she departed to take part in the invasion of the Marshall Islands . She was assigned to Task Group 58 @.@ 3 , under the command of Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman . The Task Group included the fleet carrier Bunker Hill , the light carriers Cowpens and Monterey , the fast battleships North Carolina , Massachusetts , Alabama , and South Dakota , and several destroyers . Wichita provided anti @-@ aircraft support for the carriers while they conducted air strikes on Kwajalein and Eniwetok on 29 – 31 January . On 4 February , Wichita arrived at Majuro ; she was transferred to Task Group 58 @.@ 2 . The force departed Majuro on 12 February and conducted Operation Hailstone , a major air strike on the Japanese base at Truk , four days later . 
 On the night of 16 February , Japanese aircraft launched an attack on the Task Group and torpedoed the carrier Intrepid . Task Unit 58 @.@ 2 @.@ 4 , which included Wichita , was detached to escort Intrepid back to safety and repairs . The ships reached Majuro on 20 February , and departed for Hawaii eight days later . The ships arrived in port on 4 March , and on the 9th , Wichita became the flagship of Cruiser Division 6 . On 15 March , Cruiser Division 6 departed Hawaii to return to Majuro , arriving on 20 March . After arriving , she joined the screen for the Fast Carrier Task Force , which struck Japanese bases on Yap , <unk> , and in the Palaus . Wichita supported strikes on Hollandia in New Guinea on 13 – 22 April . The task force returned to the seas off Truk on 29 April for a second round of airstrikes on the port . While the carriers were striking Truk , Wichita and several cruisers and destroyers shelled Japanese targets on Satawan Island in the <unk> group of the Caroline Islands . 
 On 4 May , Wichita returned to Majuro for a month of training . In June , she returned to the fleet , which was gathering at Kwajalein in preparations for operations against the Mariana Islands . Wichita was assigned to Task Unit 53 @.@ 10 @.@ 8 , which shelled Saipan on 13 June . The next day , Wichita bombarded Japanese gun positions on Guam , before returning to Saipan later that day . On 17 June , she joined Task Group 58 @.@ 7 ; the force patrolled to the west of the Marianas over the next three days in an attempt to intercept the large Japanese carrier force known to be approaching . On 19 June , the Japanese carriers struck at the American fleet , starting the Battle of the Philippine Sea . Wichita contributed to the antiaircraft screen ; her gunners claimed to have assisted in the destruction of two Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers . The ship was detached to cover troop transports and escort carriers off Saipan on 25 June . This duty lasted through the first week of July . Now part of Task Unit 53 @.@ 18 @.@ 1 , Wichita bombarded Japanese positions on Guam on 8 – 12 July , and again starting on 18 July . 
 Wichita departed Guam on 10 August , bound for Eniwetok . She arrived three days later and remained there until 29 July , when she put to sea to join Task Group 38 @.@ 1 . She screened for the fast carrier task group while they launched airstrikes on Japanese targets in Palau , the Carolines , the Philippines , and Dutch East Indies . On 28 August , TG 38 @.@ 1 raided targets in Palau and Morotai . By mid @-@ September , TG 38 @.@ 1 provided air support for the assault on Morotai ; the operation lasted until 21 September . The following day , the carriers launched an airstrike on Manila in the Philippines . Early on 22 September , Japanese aircraft launched a counterattack . At 07 : 34 , Wichita shot down a bomber approximately 50 yards from her . She shot down another bomber at 07 : 45 . She continued to provide antiaircraft defense for the carriers while they struck Japanese installations on Cebu , Negros , and Coron .

 Wichita got underway to support a raid on Okinawa on 2 October . On 10 October , the fleet reached the waters off Okinawa and launched the strike . The following day , the fleet struck Aparri on Luzon . The fleet then raided Formosa , where they targeted Japanese airfields to prepare for the upcoming assault against the Philippines . On 13 October , Japanese bombers attacked the fleet and badly damaged the cruiser Canberra . Wichita took Canberra under tow , though she was relieved by the ocean @-@ going tug Munsee on 15 October . Wichita joined the screen for Canberra ; the squadron was joined by the badly damaged cruiser Houston . The ships were attacked again the following day , and Houston was torpedoed again . Wichita left the damaged ships on 21 October , after they had successfully reached safer waters . Wichita then rejoined the fleet off Luzon , assigned to Task Force 34 under Vice Admiral Willis A. Lee . 
 Wichita was present during the Battle of Leyte Gulf , which started on 23 October . On 25 October , the Fast Carrier Strike Force had steamed north , to attack the Northern Force commanded by Jisaburō Ozawa . Wichita again screened for the carriers , which sank or damaged several Japanese carriers . Task Force 34 was detached to finish off several of the crippled Japanese ships with gunfire ; Wichita and three other cruisers sank the light carrier Chiyoda and the destroyer <unk> . Wichita expended twenty @-@ two percent of her armor @-@ piercing rounds at the two ships , which amounted to 148 rounds at Chiyoda and 173 against <unk> . In the aftermath of the battle , Wichita returned to screening for the carriers off Samar . On 28 October , she provided gunfire support to troops ashore on Leyte . Two days later , she defended against a Japanese airstrike on the fleet . 
 On 31 October , Wichita left the area , bound for Ulithi , reaching her destination on 2 November . After replenishing her ammunition and stores , she returned to Leyte for several days , until the middle of November . Her crew detected severe vibrations in her No. 4 engine ; the propeller shaft had broken and the propeller was trailing . She was therefore detached on 18 November for repairs in California , via Ulithi . While in Ulithi , divers discovered cracks in a strut for No. 3 propeller shaft ; now only two screws were operational . She reached San Pedro in California on 15 December . She entered the Terminal Island Navy Yard shortly after reaching port . Repairs lasted until 8 February 1945 , and by 28 February , she departed for Pearl Harbor . Wichita arrived in Hawaii on 6 March , before departing five days later for Ulithi . 
 = = = = Invasion of Okinawa = = = = 
 Wichita arrived in Ulithi on 20 March , and was assigned to Task Force 54 the next day . She put to sea to take part in the invasion of Okinawa . The ship was placed in Task Unit 54 @.@ 2 @.@ 3 to cover minesweepers off Okinawa on 25 March . On the afternoon of the following day , Wichita bombarded Japanese positions on the island , from 13 : 50 to 16 : 30 . Japanese aircraft attacked the ships early the next morning ; Wichita 's gunners shot down one of the aircraft . Later that day , the ship resumed bombardment duties in preparation for the amphibious invasion . She continued to shell the island through 28 March . The next day , she retired to Kerama Retto to replenish her ammunition . The ship then returned to Okinawa later that day to cover underwater demolition teams as they cleared beach obstacles .
