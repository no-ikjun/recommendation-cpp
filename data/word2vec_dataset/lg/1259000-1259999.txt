 Saab has offered Gripen C / D or E to Colombia , with possible deliveries during 2018 – 21 , depending on variant selected .

 A Gripen deal including 12 aircraft ( 10 single @-@ seat C @-@ models , and 2 two @-@ seat D @-@ models ) valued at 700 million euro ( US $ 1 @.@ 1 billion ) was first offered to Croatia in 2007 . However , this procurement stalled due to the 2008 financial crisis , in which the Croatian government had to <unk> government spending programmes . 
 On 24 October 2015 , Sweden announced its bid of the JAS 39 Gripen C / D for Croatia 's fighter replacement requirement , following a request for information from the Croatian Ministry of Defence in June for between 8 and 12 newly built aircraft in order to replace the Croatian fleet of ageing MiG @-@ <unk> aircraft . According to the Ministry of Defence 's Long @-@ Term Development Plan ( <unk> ) , however , the MiG @-@ 21 is to remain in service until 2024 as a result of ongoing modernisation programmes . The <unk> will run from 2015 to 2024 and is scheduled to have funding available for a replacement aircraft in 2019 . Second @-@ hand F @-@ 16s from another country may also be considered .

 In June 2015 , a working group set up by the Finnish MoD proposed starting the HX program to replace the Finnish Air Force 's current fleet of F / A @-@ 18 Hornets . The group recognises five potential types : Boeing F / A @-@ 18E / F Super Hornet , Dassault Rafale , Eurofighter Typhoon , Lockheed Martin F @-@ 35 , and Saab JAS Gripen . 
 In December 2015 the Finnish MoD sent a letter to Great Britain , France , Sweden and the United States informing them that the fighter project had been launched in the Defence Forces . The goal of the project is to replace the Hornet fleet , which will be decommissioned as of 2025 , with multi @-@ role fighters . The project has been named the HX Fighter Program . The JAS @-@ 39 is mentioned in the letter as a potential fighter for the program . The request for information concerning the HX Fighter Program was sent in April 2016 . A call for tender will be sent in spring 2018 and the buying decision is scheduled to take place in 2021 .

 The Gripen C / D was a contender for 48 multirole fighters for the Polish Air Force started in 2001 . On 27 December 2002 , the Polish Defence Minister announced the F @-@ 16C / D Block 50 / 52 + ' s selection . According to Stephen Larrabee , the selection was heavily influenced by Lockheed Martin 's lucrative offset agreement ( totaling $ 3 @.@ 5 billion and 170 % offset against Gripen International 's € 3 @.@ 2 billion with 146 % offset ) and by a political emphasis on Poland 's strategic relationship with the US and NATO . Both Gripen International and Dassault Aviation ( who offered the Mirage 2000 @-@ 5 Mk 2 ) described the decision as political . According to a former Polish military defence vice @-@ minister , the JAS 39 offer was better and included research participation proposals . 
 Poland plans to purchase 64 multirole combat aircraft from 2021 to replace the Polish Air Force 's fleet of Sukhoi Su @-@ <unk> ' Fitter @-@ K ' ground attack aircraft and Mikoyan MiG @-@ 29 fighters . The open tender procedure could include the F @-@ 35 Lightning II , the JAS 39 Gripen E / F , the Eurofighter Typhoon , the Dassault Rafale , and Boeing 's F / A @-@ 18E / F Advanced Super Hornet . 
 = = = = Slovakia = = = = 
 On 30 August 2014 , the Czech Republic , Slovakia and Sweden signed a letter of intent agreeing to co @-@ operate on using the Gripen , which may lead to acquisition of the aircraft by the Slovak Air Force . The letter of intent laid the foundation for bilateral co @-@ operation around a common airspace surveillance of Slovakia and the Czech Republic . Slovakia is looking to replace its MiG @-@ 29 fighters and the Gripen has been reported as the aircraft of choice , although the requirement will go to open competition . They may seek to lease fighters rather than buy , as did neighbouring Hungary and the Czech Republic . 
 = = = = Switzerland = = = = 
 In January 2008 , the Swiss Defence Material Administration invited Gripen International to submit bids to replace the nation 's ageing F @-@ 5 fleet . Saab responded with an initial proposal on 2 July 2008 ; other contenders were the Dassault Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon . On 30 November 2011 , the Swiss government announced its decision to buy 22 Gripen NG aircraft for 3 @.@ 1 billion Swiss francs . In 2012 , a confidential report of the Swiss Air Force 's 2009 tests of the three contenders was leaked , which had rated the Gripen as performing substantially below both the Rafale and the Eurofighter . The Gripen was assessed as satisfactory for reconnaissance but unsatisfactory for combat air patrol and strike missions . The JAS 39C / D was evaluated , while the Gripen NG had been bid . The parliamentary security commission found that the Gripen offered the most risks , but voted to go ahead as it was the cheapest option . The Gripen was considered satisfactory in all roles . 
 On 25 August 2012 , the plan to order was confirmed by both Swedish and Swiss authorities . Deliveries were expected to run from 2018 to 2021 at a fixed price of CHF 3 @.@ 126 billion ( $ 3 @.@ 27 billion ) including development costs , mission planning systems , initial spares and support , training , and certification ; the Swedish government also guaranteed the price , performance and operational suitability . 8 JAS 39Cs and 3 JAS <unk> were to be leased from 2016 to 2020 to train Swiss pilots and allow the F @-@ 5s to be retired . In 2013 , Saab moved to increase Swiss industry offsets above 100 % of the deal value after the Swiss parliament 's upper house voted down the deal 's financing . On 27 August 2013 , the National Council 's Security Commission approved the purchase , followed by the lower and upper houses of the parliament 's approval in September 2013 . Elements of the left and center of the political spectrum often criticized the Gripen as unnecessary and too expensive . On 18 May 2014 , 53 @.@ 4 % of Swiss voters voted against the plan in a national referendum . According to the press , objectors questioned the role of manned fighter aircraft in general , and the relevance of alternatives such as UAVs , surface @-@ to @-@ air missiles , or cyberwarfare capabilities . 
 In April 2015 , Switzerland is set to relaunch the F @-@ 5E / F replacement programme ; the Gripen is again the favourite . 
 = = = = Others = = = = 
 Other nations that have expressed interest in Gripen include Argentina ( E / F versions from Brazil , subject to UK veto ) , Austria ( C / D or E / F versions ) , Belgium ( E / F ) , Bulgaria ( C / D ) , Canada , Colombia ( C / D , or E / F from Brazil ) , Croatia ( possibly newly built C / D ) , Ecuador ( C / D , or E / F from Brazil ) , Estonia , Finland ( E / F ) India ( Sea Gripen and E / F ) , Indonesia ( C / D ) , Kenya ( C / D ) , Latvia , Lithuania , Malaysia ( C / D ) , Mexico ( C / D , or E / F from Brazil ) , Namibia ( C / D ) , Peru ( C / D , or E / F from Brazil ) , the Philippines ( C / D ) , Portugal ( C / D ) , Serbia , Slovakia ( C / D ) , Slovenia , Uruguay ( C / D , or E / F from Brazil ) and Vietnam . 
 Saab 's head of exports Eddy de La Motte has stated that the Gripen 's chances have improved as nations waver in their commitments to the F @-@ 35 . Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group ( an aerospace & defense analysis enterprise ) has attributed difficulty securing export sales to the Swedish government 's inability to offer the same sort of strategic partnership as some rival aircraft manufacturing nations . In September 2013 , Saab 's CEO Håkan <unk> said he envisioned Gripen sales to reach 400 or 450 aircraft .

 = = = = Denmark = = = = 
 In 2007 , Denmark signed a Memorandum of Understanding between the Defence Ministers of Sweden and Denmark to evaluate the Gripen as a replacement for Denmark 's fleet of 48 F @-@ 16s . Denmark also requested the development of Gripen variants featuring more powerful engines , larger payloads , longer range , and additional avionics ; this request contributed to Saab 's decision to proceed with the JAS E / F 's development . Denmark repeatedly delayed the purchase decision ; in 2013 , Saab indicated that the Gripen was one of four contenders for the Danish purchase , alongside Boeing 's Super Hornet , Lockheed Martin 's F @-@ 35 Joint Strike Fighter , and the Eurofighter . Denmark is a level @-@ 3 partner in the JSF programme , and has already invested US $ 200 million . The final selection will be in mid @-@ 2015 where 24 to 30 fighters are expected . The Swedish government announced on 21 July 2014 the Gripen 's withdrawal from the Danish competition , having chosen not to respond to the invitation to tender . 
 = = = = Finland = = = = 
 Gripen first export bid was to Finland , where it competed against F @-@ 16 , F / A @-@ 18 , MiG @-@ 29 and Mirage 2000 to replace Finnish Air Force 's J 35 Draken and MiG @-@ 21 fleet . In May 1992 , McDonnell Douglas F / A @-@ 18 was announced as a winner on performance and cost grounds . The Finnish Minister of Defence , Elisabeth Rehn stated that delays in Gripen 's development schedule had hurt its chances in the competition . 
 = = = = India = = = = 
 The Gripen was a contender for the Indian MRCA competition for 126 multirole combat aircraft . In April 2008 , Gripen International offered the Next Generation Gripen for India 's tender and opened an office in New Delhi in order to support its efforts in the Indian market . On 4 February 2009 , Saab announced that it had partnered with India 's Tata Group to develop the new Gripen variant to fit India 's needs . 
 The Indian Air Force ( IAF ) conducted extensive field trials and evaluated Gripen 's flight performance , logistics capability , weapons systems , advanced sensors and weapons firing . In April 2011 , the IAF rejected Gripen 's bid in favour of the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Dassault Rafale . Senior Indian Air Force officials , while happy with the improved capabilities of Gripen NG , identified its high reliance on US @-@ supplied hardware , including electronics , weaponry and the GE F414 engine , as a factor that may hamper its ability to be exported . 
 In 2015 after the Rafale order was cut back to just 36 aircraft , Saab indicated a willingness to set up joint production of the Gripen in India . 
 = = = = Netherlands = = = = 
 In July 2008 , the Netherlands announced it would evaluate Gripen NG together with four other competitors ; in response , Saab offered 85 aircraft to the Royal Netherlands Air Force in August 2008 . On 18 December 2008 , it was reported that the Netherlands had evaluated the F @-@ 35 as having a better performance @-@ price relation than the Gripen NG . On 13 January 2009 , NRC Handelsblad claimed that , according to Swedish sources , Saab had offered to deliver 85 Gripens for € 4 @.@ 8 billion to the Dutch Air Force , about 1 billion euro cheaper than budgeted for the F @-@ 35 . 
 = = = = Norway = = = = 
 On 18 January 2008 , the Norwegian Ministry of Defence issued a Request for Binding Information ( RBI ) to the Swedish Defence Material Administration , who issued an offer for 48 Gripens in April 2008 . On 20 November 2008 , the selection of the F @-@ 35 Lightning II for the Royal Norwegian Air Force was announced , stating that the F @-@ 35 is the only candidate to meet all operational requirements ; media reports claimed the requirements were tilted in the F @-@ 35 's favour . Saab and Sweden 's defence minister Sten <unk> stated that Norway 's cost calculations were flawed ; the offer being for 48 Gripens over 20 years , but Norway had extrapolated it to operating 57 aircraft over 30 years , thus doubling the cost ; cost projections also failed to relate to the Gripen 's operational costs . Norway also calculated greater attrition losses than what Sweden considered reasonable . According to <unk> , Norway 's decision complicated further export deals . 
 In December 2010 leaked United States diplomatic cables revealed that the United States deliberately delayed Sweden 's request for access to a US AESA radar until after Norway 's selection . The cables also indicated that Norwegian consideration of the Gripen " was just a show " and that Norway had decided to purchase the F @-@ 35 due to " high @-@ level political pressure " from the US .

 The Nobel Prize ( / <unk> / , Swedish pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ; Swedish definite form , singular : <unk> ; Norwegian : <unk> ) is a set of annual international awards bestowed in a number of categories by Swedish and Norwegian committees in recognition of academic , cultural and / or scientific advances . 
 The will of the Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel established the prizes in 1895 . The prizes in Chemistry , Literature , Peace , Physics , and Physiology or Medicine were first awarded in 1901 . The related Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was established by Sweden 's central bank in 1968 . Medals made before 1980 were struck in 23 carat gold , and later from 18 carat green gold plated with a 24 carat gold coating . Between 1901 and 2015 , the Nobel Prizes and the Prize in Economic Sciences were awarded 573 times to 900 people and organizations . With some receiving the Nobel Prize more than once , this makes a total of 870 individuals ( 822 men and 48 women ) and 23 organizations . 
 The prize ceremonies take place annually in Stockholm , Sweden , except for the peace prize which is held in Oslo , Norway and each recipient , or laureate , receives a gold medal , a diploma and a sum of money that has been decided by the Nobel Foundation . ( As of 2012 , each prize was worth <unk> million or about US $ 1 @.@ 2 million , € 0 @.@ 93 million or £ 0 @.@ 6 million . ) The Nobel Prize is widely regarded as the most prestigious award available in the fields of literature , medicine , physics , chemistry , peace , and economics . 
 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Nobel Prize in Physics , the Nobel Prize in Chemistry , and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences ; the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet awards the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ; the Swedish Academy grants the Nobel Prize in Literature ; and the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded not by a Swedish organisation but by the Norwegian Nobel Committee . 
 The prize is not awarded posthumously ; however , if a person is awarded a prize and dies before receiving it , the prize may still be presented . Though the average number of laureates per prize increased substantially during the 20th century , a prize may not be shared among more than three people . 
 = = History = = 
 Alfred Nobel ( listen ) was born on 21 October 1833 in Stockholm , Sweden , into a family of engineers . He was a chemist , engineer , and inventor . In 1894 , Nobel purchased the Bofors iron and steel mill , which he made into a major armaments manufacturer . Nobel also invented <unk> . This invention was a precursor to many smokeless military explosives , especially the British smokeless powder cordite . As a consequence of his patent claims , Nobel was eventually involved in a patent infringement lawsuit over cordite . Nobel amassed a fortune during his lifetime , with most of his wealth from his 355 inventions , of which dynamite is the most famous . 
 In 1888 , Nobel was astonished to read his own obituary , titled The merchant of death is dead , in a French newspaper . As it was Alfred 's brother Ludvig who had died , the obituary was eight years premature . The article disconcerted Nobel and made him apprehensive about how he would be remembered . This inspired him to change his will . On 10 December 1896 , Alfred Nobel died in his villa in San Remo , Italy , from a cerebral haemorrhage . He was 63 years old . 
 Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime . He composed the last over a year before he died , signing it at the Swedish – Norwegian Club in Paris on 27 November 1895 . To widespread astonishment , Nobel 's last will specified that his fortune be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the " greatest benefit on mankind " in physics , chemistry , physiology or medicine , literature , and peace . Nobel bequeathed 94 % of his total assets , 31 million SEK ( c . US $ 186 million , € 150 million in 2008 ) , to establish the five Nobel Prizes . Because of scepticism surrounding the will , it was not until 26 April 1897 that it was approved by the Storting in Norway . The executors of Nobel 's will , Ragnar <unk> and Rudolf <unk> , formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of Nobel 's fortune and organise the award of prizes . 
 Nobel 's instructions named a Norwegian Nobel Committee to award the Peace Prize , the members of whom were appointed shortly after the will was approved in April 1897 . Soon thereafter , the other prize @-@ awarding organisations were designated or established . These were Karolinska Institutet on 7 June , the Swedish Academy on 9 June , and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 11 June . The Nobel Foundation reached an agreement on guidelines for how the prizes should be awarded ; and , in 1900 , the Nobel Foundation 's newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II . In 1905 , the personal union between Sweden and Norway was dissolved . 
 = = = Nobel Foundation = = = 
 The Nobel Foundation was founded as a private organisation on 29 June 1900 . Its function is to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes . In accordance with Nobel 's will , the primary task of the Foundation is to manage the fortune Nobel left . Robert and Ludwig Nobel were involved in the oil business in Azerbaijan and , according to Swedish historian E. <unk> , who accessed the Nobel family archives , it was this " decision to allow withdrawal of Alfred 's money from Baku that became the decisive factor that enabled the Nobel Prizes to be established " . Another important task of the Nobel Foundation is to market the prizes internationally and to oversee informal administration related to the prizes . The Foundation is not involved in the process of selecting the Nobel laureates . In many ways , the Nobel Foundation is similar to an investment company , in that it invests Nobel 's money to create a solid funding base for the prizes and the administrative activities . The Nobel Foundation is exempt from all taxes in Sweden ( since 1946 ) and from investment taxes in the United States ( since 1953 ) . Since the 1980s , the Foundation 's investments have become more profitable and as of 31 December 2007 , the assets controlled by the Nobel Foundation amounted to 3 @.@ 628 billion Swedish kronor ( c . US $ 560 million ) . 
 According to the statutes , the Foundation consists of a board of five Swedish or Norwegian citizens , with its seat in Stockholm . The Chairman of the Board is appointed by the Swedish King in Council , with the other four members appointed by the trustees of the prize @-@ awarding institutions . An Executive Director is chosen from among the board members , a Deputy Director is appointed by the King in Council , and two deputies are appointed by the trustees . However , since 1995 , all the members of the board have been chosen by the trustees , and the Executive Director and the Deputy Director appointed by the board itself . As well as the board , the Nobel Foundation is made up of the prize @-@ awarding institutions ( the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute , the Swedish Academy , and the Norwegian Nobel Committee ) , the trustees of these institutions , and auditors . 
 = = = First prizes = = = 
 Once the Nobel Foundation and its guidelines were in place , the Nobel Committees began collecting nominations for the inaugural prizes . Subsequently they sent a list of preliminary candidates to the prize @-@ awarding institutions . 
 The Nobel Committee 's Physics Prize shortlist cited Wilhelm Röntgen 's discovery of X @-@ rays and Philipp Lenard 's work on cathode rays . The Academy of Sciences selected Röntgen for the prize . In the last decades of the 19th century , many chemists had made significant contributions . Thus , with the Chemistry Prize , the Academy " was chiefly faced with merely deciding the order in which these scientists should be awarded the prize . " The Academy received 20 nominations , eleven of them for Jacobus van 't Hoff . Van 't Hoff was awarded the prize for his contributions in chemical thermodynamics . 
 The Swedish Academy chose the poet Sully Prudhomme for the first Nobel Prize in Literature . A group including 42 Swedish writers , artists and literary critics protested against this decision , having expected Leo Tolstoy to be awarded . Some , including Burton Feldman , have criticised this prize because they consider Prudhomme a mediocre poet . Feldman 's explanation is that most of the Academy members preferred Victorian literature and thus selected a Victorian poet . The first Physiology or Medicine Prize went to the German physiologist and microbiologist Emil von Behring . During the 1890s , von Behring developed an antitoxin to treat diphtheria , which until then was causing thousands of deaths each year . 
 The first Nobel Peace Prize went to the Swiss Jean Henri Dunant for his role in founding the International Red Cross Movement and initiating the Geneva Convention , and jointly given to French pacifist Frédéric Passy , founder of the Peace League and active with Dunant in the Alliance for Order and Civilization . 
 = = = Second World War = = = 
 In 1938 and 1939 , Adolf Hitler 's Third Reich forbade three laureates from Germany ( Richard Kuhn , Adolf Friedrich Johann Butenandt , and Gerhard <unk> ) from accepting their prizes . Each man was later able to receive the diploma and medal . Even though Sweden was officially neutral during the Second World War , the prizes were awarded irregularly . In 1939 , the Peace Prize was not awarded . No prize was awarded in any category from 1940 – 42 , due to the occupation of Norway by Germany . In the subsequent year , all prizes were awarded except those for literature and peace . 
 During the occupation of Norway , three members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee fled into exile . The remaining members escaped persecution from the Germans when the Nobel Foundation stated that the Committee building in Oslo was Swedish property . Thus it was a safe haven from the German military , which was not at war with Sweden . These members kept the work of the Committee going , but did not award any prizes . In 1944 , the Nobel Foundation , together with the three members in exile , made sure that nominations were submitted for the Peace Prize and that the prize could be awarded once again . 
 = = = Prize in Economic Sciences = = = 
 In 1968 , Sveriges <unk> celebrated its 300th anniversary by donating a large sum of money to the Nobel Foundation to be used to set up a prize in honor of Nobel . The following year , the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded for the first time . The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences became responsible for selecting laureates . The first laureates for the Economics Prize were Jan Tinbergen and Ragnar Frisch " for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes . " Although not a Nobel Prize , it is intimately identified with the other awards ; the laureates are announced with the Nobel Prize recipients , and the Prize in Economic Sciences is presented at the Swedish Nobel Prize Award Ceremony . The Board of the Nobel Foundation decided that after this addition , it would allow no further new prizes .

 Nomination forms are sent by the Nobel Committee to about 3 @,@ 000 individuals , usually in September the year before the prizes are awarded . These individuals are generally prominent academics working in a relevant area . Regarding the Peace Prize , inquiries are also sent to governments , former Peace Prize laureates and current or former members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee . The deadline for the return of the nomination forms is 31 January of the year of the award . The Nobel Committee nominates about 300 potential laureates from these forms and additional names . The nominees are not publicly named , nor are they told that they are being considered for the prize . All nomination records for a prize are sealed for 50 years from the awarding of the prize . 
 = = = Selection = = = 
 The Nobel Committee then prepares a report reflecting the advice of experts in the relevant fields . This , along with the list of preliminary candidates , is submitted to the prize @-@ awarding institutions . The institutions meet to choose the laureate or laureates in each field by a majority vote . Their decision , which cannot be appealed , is announced immediately after the vote . A maximum of three laureates and two different works may be selected per award . Except for the Peace Prize , which can be awarded to institutions , the awards can only be given to individuals . If the Peace Prize is not awarded , the money is split among the scientific prizes . This has happened 19 times so far . 
 = = = Posthumous nominations = = = 
 Although posthumous nominations are not presently permitted , individuals who died in the months between their nomination and the decision of the prize committee were originally eligible to receive the prize . This has occurred twice : the 1931 Literature Prize awarded to Erik Axel <unk> , and the 1961 Peace Prize awarded to UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld . Since 1974 , laureates must be thought alive at the time of the October announcement . There has been one laureate , William Vickrey , who in 1996 died after the prize ( in Economics ) was announced but before it could be presented . On 3 October 2011 , the laureates for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine were announced ; however , the committee was not aware that one of the laureates , Ralph M. Steinman , had died three days earlier . The committee was debating about Steinman 's prize , since the rule is that the prize is not awarded posthumously . The committee later decided that as the decision to award Steinman the prize " was made in good faith " , it would remain unchanged . 
 = = = Recognition time lag = = = 
 Nobel 's will provided for prizes to be awarded in recognition of discoveries made " during the preceding year " . Early on , the awards usually recognised recent discoveries . However , some of these early discoveries were later discredited . For example , Johannes <unk> was awarded the 1926 Prize for Physiology or Medicine for his purported discovery of a parasite that caused cancer . To avoid repeating this embarrassment , the awards increasingly recognised scientific discoveries that had withstood the test of time . According to Ralf Pettersson , former chairman of the Nobel Prize Committee for Physiology or Medicine , " the criterion ' the previous year ' is interpreted by the Nobel Assembly as the year when the full impact of the discovery has become evident . " 
 The interval between the award and the accomplishment it recognises varies from discipline to discipline . The Literature Prize is typically awarded to recognise a cumulative lifetime body of work rather than a single achievement . The Peace Prize can also be awarded for a lifetime body of work . For example , 2008 laureate Martti Ahtisaari was awarded for his work to resolve international conflicts . However , they can also be awarded for specific recent events . For instance , Kofi Annan was awarded the 2001 Peace Prize just four years after becoming the Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations . Similarly Yasser Arafat , Yitzhak Rabin , and Shimon Peres received the 1994 award , about a year after they successfully concluded the Oslo Accords . 
 Although Nobel 's will stated that prizes should be awarded for contributions made " during the preceding year " , awards for physics , chemistry , and medicine are typically awarded once the achievement has been widely accepted . Sometimes , this takes decades – for example , Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar shared the 1983 Physics Prize for his 1930s work on stellar structure and evolution . Not all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognised . Some discoveries can never be considered for a prize if their impact is realised after the discoverers have died . 
 = = Award ceremonies = = 
 Except for the Peace Prize , the Nobel Prizes are presented in Stockholm , Sweden , at the annual Prize Award Ceremony on 10 December , the anniversary of Nobel 's death . The recipients ' lectures are normally held in the days prior to the award ceremony . The Peace Prize and its recipients ' lectures are presented at the annual Prize Award Ceremony in Oslo , Norway , usually on 10 December . The award ceremonies and the associated banquets are typically major international events . The Prizes awarded in Sweden 's ceremonies ' are held at the Stockholm Concert Hall , with the Nobel banquet following immediately at Stockholm City Hall . The Nobel Peace Prize ceremony has been held at the Norwegian Nobel Institute ( 1905 – 1946 ) , at the auditorium of the University of Oslo ( 1947 – 1989 ) and at Oslo City Hall ( 1990 – present ) . 
 The highlight of the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm occurs when each Nobel laureate steps forward to receive the prize from the hands of the King of Sweden . In Oslo , the Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee presents the Nobel Peace Prize in the presence of the King of Norway . At first King Oscar II did not approve of awarding grand prizes to foreigners . It is said that his mind changed once his attention had been drawn to the publicity value of the prizes for Sweden . 
 = = = Nobel Banquet = = = 
 After the award ceremony in Sweden , a banquet is held in the Blue Hall at the Stockholm City Hall , which is attended by the Swedish Royal Family and around 1 @,@ 300 guests . 
 The Nobel Peace Prize banquet is held in Norway at the Oslo Grand Hotel after the award ceremony . Apart from the laureate , guests include the President of the Storting , the Prime Minister , and , since 2006 , the King and Queen of Norway . In total , about 250 guests attend . 
 = = = Nobel lecture = = = 
 According to the statutes of the Nobel Foundation , each laureate is required to give a public lecture on a subject related to the topic of their prize . The Nobel lecture as a rhetorical genre took decades to reach its current format . These lectures normally occur during Nobel Week ( the week leading up to the award ceremony and banquet , which begins with the laureates arriving in Stockholm and normally ends with the Nobel banquet ) , but this is not mandatory . The laureate is only obliged to give the lecture within six months of receiving the prize . Some have happened even later . For example , U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt received the Peace Prize in 1906 but gave his lecture in 1910 , after his term in office . The lectures are organized by the same association which selected the laureates . 
 = = Prizes = = 
 = = = Medals = = = 
 It was announced on 30 May 2012 that the Nobel Foundation had awarded the contract for the production of the five ( Swedish ) Nobel Prize medals to Svenska <unk> AB . Formerly , the Nobel Prize medals were minted by <unk> ( the Swedish Mint ) from 1902 to 2010 . <unk> , Sweden 's oldest company , ceased operations in 2011 after 1 @,@ 017 years . In 2011 , the Mint of Norway , located in Kongsberg , made the medals . The Nobel Prize medals are registered trademarks of the Nobel Foundation . Each medal features an image of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse . The medals for physics , chemistry , physiology or medicine , and literature have identical obverses , showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death . Nobel 's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Peace Prize medal and the medal for the Economics Prize , but with a slightly different design . For instance , the laureate 's name is engraved on the rim of the Economics medal . The image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize . The reverse sides of the medals for chemistry and physics share the same design . 
 All medals made before 1980 were struck in 23 carat gold . Since then , they have been struck in 18 carat green gold plated with 24 carat gold . The weight of each medal varies with the value of gold , but averages about 175 grams ( 0 @.@ 386 lb ) for each medal . The diameter is 66 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) and the thickness varies between 5 @.@ 2 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 20 in ) and 2 @.@ 4 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 094 in ) . Because of the high value of their gold content and tendency to be on public display , Nobel medals are subject to medal theft . During World War II , the medals of German scientists Max von Laue and James Franck were sent to Copenhagen for safekeeping . When Germany invaded Denmark , chemist George de Hevesy dissolved them in aqua regia ( nitro @-@ hydrochloric acid ) , to prevent confiscation by Nazi Germany and to prevent legal problems for the holders . After the war , the gold was recovered from solution , and the medals re @-@ cast . 
 = = = Diplomas = = = 
 Nobel laureates receive a diploma directly from the hands of the King of Sweden or , in the case of the peace prize , the Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee . Each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize @-@ awarding institutions for the laureates that receive them . The diploma contains a picture and text in Swedish which states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize . None of the Nobel Peace Prize laureates has ever had a citation on their diplomas . 
 = = = Award money = = = 
 The laureates are given a sum of money when they receive their prizes , in the form of a document confirming the amount awarded . The amount of prize money depends upon how much money the Nobel Foundation can award each year . The purse has increased since the 1980s , when the prize money was 880 000 SEK ( c . 2 @.@ 6 million SEK , US $ 350 000 or € 295 @,@ 000 today ) per prize . In 2009 , the monetary award was 10 million SEK ( US $ 1 @.@ 4 million , € 950 @,@ 000 ) . In June 2012 , it was lowered to 8 million SEK . If there are two laureates in a particular category , the award grant is divided equally between the recipients . If there are three , the awarding committee has the option of dividing the grant equally , or awarding one @-@ half to one recipient and one @-@ quarter to each of the others . It is common for recipients to donate prize money to benefit scientific , cultural , or humanitarian causes . 
 = = Controversies and criticisms = = 
 = = = Controversial recipients = = = 
 Among other criticisms , the Nobel Committees have been accused of having a political agenda , and of omitting more deserving candidates . They have also been accused of Eurocentrism , especially for the Literature Prize . 
 Peace Prize 
 Among the most criticised Nobel Peace Prizes was the one awarded to Henry Kissinger and Lê Đức Thọ . This led to the resignation of two Norwegian Nobel Committee members . Lê Đức Thọ declined the prize . Kissinger and Thọ were awarded the prize for negotiating a ceasefire between North Vietnam and the United States in January 1973 . However , when the award was announced , both sides were still engaging in hostilities . Many critics were of the opinion that Kissinger was not a peace @-@ maker but the opposite , responsible for widening the war . 
 Yasser Arafat , Shimon Peres , and Yitzhak Rabin received the Peace Prize in 1994 for their efforts in making peace between Israel and Palestine . Immediately after the award was announced , one of the five Norwegian Nobel Committee members denounced Arafat as a terrorist and resigned . Additional misgivings about Arafat were widely expressed in various newspapers . 
 Another controversial Peace Prize was that awarded to Barack Obama in 2009 . Nominations had closed only eleven days after Obama took office as President , but the actual evaluation occurred over the next eight months . Obama himself stated that he did not feel deserving of the award , or worthy of the company it would place him in . Past Peace Prize laureates were divided , some saying that Obama deserved the award , and others saying he had not secured the achievements to yet merit such an accolade . Obama 's award , along with the previous Peace Prizes for Jimmy Carter and Al Gore , also prompted accusations of a left @-@ wing bias . 
 Literature Prize 
 The award of the 2004 Literature Prize to Elfriede Jelinek drew a protest from a member of the Swedish Academy , Knut <unk> . <unk> resigned , alleging that the selection of Jelinek had caused " irreparable damage to all progressive forces , it has also confused the general view of literature as an art . " He alleged that Jelinek 's works were " a mass of text shovelled together without artistic structure . " The 2009 Literature Prize to Herta Müller also generated criticism . According to The Washington Post many US literary critics and professors were ignorant of her work . This made those critics feel the prizes were too Eurocentric . 
 Science prizes 
 In 1949 , the neurologist António <unk> Moniz received the Physiology or Medicine Prize for his development of the prefrontal <unk> . The previous year Dr. Walter Freeman had developed a version of the procedure which was faster and easier to carry out . Due in part to the publicity surrounding the original procedure , Freeman 's procedure was prescribed without due consideration or regard for modern medical ethics . Endorsed by such influential publications as The New England Journal of Medicine , <unk> or " lobotomy " became so popular that about 5 @,@ 000 <unk> were performed in the United States in the three years immediately following Moniz 's receipt of the Prize . 
 = = = Overlooked achievements = = = 
 The Norwegian Nobel Committee confirmed that Mahatma Gandhi was nominated for the Peace Prize in 1937 – 39 , 1947 , and a few days before he was assassinated in January 1948 . Later , members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee expressed regret that he was not given the prize . Geir Lundestad , Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2006 said , " The greatest omission in our 106 year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace prize . Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace prize . Whether Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question " . In 1948 , the year of Gandhi 's death , the Nobel Committee declined to award a prize on the grounds that " there was no suitable living candidate " that year . Later , when the Dalai Lama was awarded the Peace Prize in 1989 , the chairman of the committee said that this was " in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi . " Other high profile individuals with widely recognised contributions to peace have been missed out . Foreign Policy lists Eleanor Roosevelt , Václav Havel , Ken Saro @-@ <unk> , Sari <unk> and Corazon Aquino as people who " never won the prize , but should have . " . The physicist Arnold Sommerfeld was nominated 81 times but an award was never made . 
 In 1965 , UN Secretary General U Thant was informed by the Norwegian <unk> Representative to the UN that he would be awarded that year 's prize and asked whether or not he would accept . He consulted staff and later replied that he would . At the same time , Chairman Gunnar Jahn of the Nobel Peace prize committee , lobbied heavily against giving U Thant the prize and the prize was at the last minute awarded to UNICEF . The rest of the committee all wanted the prize to go to U Thant , for his work in defusing the Cuban Missile Crisis , ending the war in the Congo , and his ongoing work to mediate an end to the Vietnam War . The disagreement lasted three years and in 1966 and 1967 no prize was given , with Gunnar Jahn effectively vetoing an award to U Thant . 
 The Literature Prize also has controversial omissions . Adam Kirsch has suggested that many notable writers have missed out on the award for political or extra @-@ literary reasons . The heavy focus on European and Swedish authors has been a subject of criticism . The Eurocentric nature of the award was acknowledged by Peter Englund , the 2009 Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy , as a problem with the award and was attributed to the tendency for the academy to relate more to European authors . This tendency towards European authors still leaves a number of European writers on a list of notable writers that have been overlooked for the Literature Prize , including Europe 's Leo Tolstoy , Anton Chekhov , J. R. R. Tolkien , Émile Zola , Marcel Proust , Vladimir Nabokov , James Joyce , August Strindberg , Simon <unk> , the New World 's Jorge Luis Borges , Ezra Pound , John Updike , Arthur Miller , Mark Twain , and Africa 's Chinua Achebe . 
 The strict rule against awarding a prize to more than three people is also controversial . When a prize is awarded to recognize an achievement by a team of more than three collaborators , one or more will miss out . For example , in 2002 , the prize was awarded to Koichi Tanaka and John Fenn for the development of mass spectrometry in protein chemistry , an award that did not recognize the achievements of Franz <unk> and Michael Karas of the Institute for Physical and Theoretical Chemistry at the University of Frankfurt . According to one of the nominees for the prize in physics , the three person limit deprived him and two other members of his team of the honor in 2013 : the team of Carl Hagen , Gerald <unk> , and Tom Kibble published a paper in 1964 that gave answers to how the Cosmos began , but did not share the 2013 Physics Prize awarded to Peter Higgs and François Englert , who had also published papers in 1964 concerning the subject . All five physicists arrived at the same conclusion , albeit from different angles . Hagen contends that an equitable solution is to either abandon the three limit restriction , or expand the time period of recognition for a given achievement to two years . 
 Similarly , the prohibition of posthumous awards fails to recognise achievements by an individual or collaborator who dies before the prize is awarded . In 1962 , Francis Crick , James D. Watson , and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the Physiology or Medicine Prize for discovering the structure of DNA . Rosalind Franklin , a key contributor in that discovery , died of ovarian cancer four years earlier . The Economics Prize was not awarded to Fischer Black , who died in 1995 , when his co @-@ author Myron Scholes received the honor in 1997 for their landmark work on option pricing along with Robert C. Merton , another pioneer in the development of valuation of stock options . In the announcement of the award that year , the Nobel committee prominently mentioned Black 's key role . 
 Political subterfuge may also deny proper recognition . Lise Meitner and Fritz Strassmann , who co @-@ discovered nuclear fission along with Otto Hahn , may have been denied a share of Hahn 's 1944 Nobel Chemistry Award due to having fled Germany when the Nazis came to power . The Meitner and Strassmann roles in the research was not fully recognized until years later , when they joined Hahn in receiving the 1966 Enrico Fermi Award . 
 = = = Emphasis on discoveries over inventions = = = 
 Alfred Nobel left his fortune to finance annual prizes to be awarded " to those who , during the preceding year , shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind . " He stated that the Nobel Prizes in Physics should be given " to the person who shall have made the most important ' discovery ' or ' invention ' within the field of physics . " Nobel did not emphasise discoveries , but they have historically been held in higher respect by the Nobel Prize Committee than inventions : 77 % of the Physics Prizes have been given to discoveries , compared with only 23 % to inventions . Christoph <unk> and Matthias <unk> , in papers published in Nature and <unk> Arts , have argued this emphasis on discoveries has moved the Nobel Prize away from its original intention of rewarding the greatest contribution to society . 
 = = Specially distinguished laureates = = 
 = = = Multiple laureates = = = 
 Four people have received two Nobel Prizes . Marie Curie received the Physics Prize in 1903 for her work on radioactivity and the Chemistry Prize in 1911 for the isolation of pure radium , making her the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two different sciences . Linus Pauling won the 1954 Chemistry Prize for his research into the chemical bond and its application to the structure of complex substances . Pauling also won the Peace Prize in 1962 for his activism against nuclear weapons , making him the only laureate of two unshared prizes . John Bardeen received the Physics Prize twice : in 1956 for the invention of the transistor and in 1972 for the theory of superconductivity . Frederick Sanger received the prize twice in Chemistry : in 1958 for determining the structure of the insulin molecule and in 1980 for inventing a method of determining base sequences in DNA . 
 Two organisations have received the Peace Prize multiple times . The International Committee of the Red Cross received it three times : in 1917 and 1944 for its work during the world wars ; and in 1963 during the year of its centenary . The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has won the Peace Prize twice for assisting refugees : in 1954 and 1981 . 
 = = = Family laureates = = = 
 The Curie family has received the most prizes , with four prizes won by five individual laureates . Marie Curie received the prizes in Physics ( in 1903 ) and Chemistry ( in 1911 ) . Her husband , Pierre Curie , shared the 1903 Physics prize with her . Their daughter , Irène Joliot @-@ Curie , received the Chemistry Prize in 1935 together with her husband Frédéric Joliot @-@ Curie . In addition , the husband of Marie Curie 's second daughter , Henry <unk> , was the director of UNICEF when it won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1965 . 
 Although no family matches the Curie family 's record , there have been several with two laureates . The husband @-@ and @-@ wife team of Gerty Cori and Carl Ferdinand Cori shared the 1947 Prize in Physiology or Medicine as did the husband @-@ and @-@ wife team of May @-@ Britt Moser and Edvard Moser in 2014 ( along with John O 'Keefe ) . J. J. Thomson was awarded the Physics Prize in 1906 for showing that electrons are particles . His son , George Paget Thomson , received the same prize in 1937 for showing that they also have the properties of waves . William Henry Bragg and his son , William Lawrence Bragg , shared the Physics Prize in 1915 for inventing the X @-@ ray spectrometer . Niels Bohr won the Physics prize in 1922 , as did his son , Aage Bohr , in 1975 . Manne <unk> , who received the Physics Prize in 1924 , was the father of Kai <unk> , who received the Physics Prize in 1981 . Hans von Euler @-@ <unk> , who received the Chemistry Prize in 1929 , was the father of Ulf von Euler , who was awarded the Physiology or Medicine Prize in 1970 . C.V.

Kornberg 's son , Roger later received the Chemistry Prize in 2006 . Jan Tinbergen , who won the first Economics Prize in 1969 , was the brother of Nikolaas Tinbergen , who received the 1973 Physiology or Medicine Prize .

 Being a symbol of scientific or literary achievement that 's recognisable worldwide , the Nobel Prize is often depicted in fiction .

 Two laureates have voluntarily declined the Nobel Prize . In 1964 , Jean @-@ Paul Sartre was awarded the Literature Prize but refused , stating , " A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution , even if it takes place in the most honourable form . " The other is Lê Đức Thọ , chosen for the 1973 Peace Prize for his role in the Paris Peace Accords . He declined , stating that there was no actual peace in Vietnam . 
 During the Third Reich , Adolf Hitler hindered Richard Kuhn , Adolf Butenandt , and Gerhard <unk> from accepting their prizes . All of them were awarded their diplomas and gold medals after World War II . In 1958 , Boris Pasternak declined his prize for literature due to fear of what the Soviet Union government might do if he travelled to Stockholm to accept his prize . In return , the Swedish Academy refused his refusal , saying " this refusal , of course , in no way alters the validity of the award . " The Academy announced with regret that the presentation of the Literature Prize could not take place that year , holding it until 1989 when Pasternak 's son accepted the prize on his behalf . Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 , but her children accepted the prize because she had been placed under house arrest in Burma ; Suu Kyi delivered her speech two decades later , in 2012 . Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 while he and his wife were under house arrest in China as political prisoners .

 The ABU TV Song Festival 2012 was the first annual edition of the ABU TV Song Festivals . The festival , which was non @-@ competitive , took place in the KBS Concert Hall , located in the South Korean capital of Seoul and coincided with the 49th general assembly of the Asia @-@ Pacific Broadcasting Union ( ABU ) . Eleven countries confirmed their participation in the first edition of the competition . 
 The Asia @-@ Pacific Broadcasting Union ( ABU ) had previously run international contests , inspired by the Eurovision Song Contest , for their members during 1985 – 1987 . The European Broadcasting Union had proposed a partnership with the ABU in 2008 to establish the Asiavision Song Contest , however these talks never produced any results . The ABU announced in 2011 that they would organise their own ABU Radio and TV Song Festivals . 
 The format used was different from that of the Eurovision Song Contest , as there were two festivals that took place . The ABU TV Song Festival was a non @-@ competitive musical gala orientated , while the Radio Song Festival was the competitive . The festival was not aired live by any of the competing broadcasters , but is scheduled to be broadcast between October and November 2012 . 
 = = History = = 
 The Asia @-@ Pacific Broadcasting Union ( ABU ) had already run an international song contest for its members inspired by the Eurovision Song Contest in 1985 – 1987 , called the ABU Popular Song Contest , with 14 countries of the Asia @-@ Pacific region competing . The show had a similar concept to the current festivals with winners being chosen by a professional jury . South Korea , New Zealand and Australia celebrated victories in this competition . In 1989 – 1991 ABU co @-@ produced the ABU Golden Kite World Song Festival in Malaysia with participation of Asia @-@ Pacific countries , as well as Yugoslavia and Finland . 
 In 2008 , the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) proposed a partnership with ABU on the establishment of an Asiavision Song Contest , however these talks didn 't produce any result , and in September 2008 it was announced that the Eurovision Song Contest format for Asian production had been sold to a private company from Singapore , Asiavision Pte . Ltd . The original name intended for that event was Asiavision Song Contest , but it was later changed to Our Sound - The Asia @-@ Pacific Song Contest following a request from the ABU , who uses the Asiavision name for their news exchange service . Initially , the contest ( which was supposed to be a two program live broadcast TV show with public voting ) was set to premiere in 2009 , but it was later rescheduled for March 2010 in Macao and then for November 2010 in Mumbai , at the end being postponed indefinitely " due to the ongoing issues between the organizers and EBU " . 
 Shortly before launching the ABU Song Festival , the ABU had been considering the possibility to organize the ABU ASEAN TV Song Festival in Thailand . Historically , ASEAN song contests had been organized in periods between 1981 and 1997 , however since 2011 the ASEAN Festival had been organized between local Radio stations as Bintang Radio ASEAN . 
 In November 2011 , the ABU announced that they would organize its own TV and Radio Song Festivals to take place in Seoul , the South Korean capital , in time with 49th General Assembly in October 2012 . The name Asiavision Song Contest was initially mentioned as a possibility , but they were later officially titled ABU TV Song Festival and ABU Radio Song Festival . According to the ABU , the deadline for participation applications for ABU TV Song Festival was 18 May 2012 .

 = Nevada State Route 375 = 
 State Route 375 ( SR 375 ) is a state highway in south @-@ central Nevada in the United States . The highway stretches 98 miles ( 158 km ) from State Route 318 at Crystal Springs northwest to U.S. Route 6 ( US 6 ) at Warm Springs . The route travels through mostly unoccupied desert terrain , with much of its alignment paralleling the northern edges of the Nellis Air Force Range . The road originally traversed through what is now the northern reaches of the air force range in the 1930s , when it was previously designated State Route 25A and later part of State Route 25 . 
 The top @-@ secret Area 51 government base is near SR 375 and many travelers have reported UFO observations and other strange alien activity along this road . Such stories prompted the state to officially designate the route as the Extraterrestrial Highway in 1996 . The small town of Rachel , located near the center of the highway , caters to tourists , <unk> , and UFO seekers with alien @-@ themed businesses . Although the area receives some tourism due to alleged extraterrestrial activity , SR 375 remains a lightly traveled route .

 Descending the summit , SR 375 nears the border of the Nellis Air Force Range . As the highway heads northwest through <unk> Valley , it meets Mail Box Road . It used to be marked by a single postal drop known as the " black mailbox " : the dirt access road leads to the restricted lands surrounding Area 51 . The original mailbox was a normal black mailbox , however due to people constantly sifting through it , it was replaced with a white one that was much more secure . The name " Black Mailbox " still stuck . It was commonly used as a gathering place for UFO seekers , and two to three UFO sightings per week allegedly occur in the area . The mailbox was removed by its owner , Steve Medlin , due to continued vandalism . SR 375 continues heading northwest from the mailbox , climbing in elevation again to reach the top of Coyote Summit at 5 @,@ 591 feet ( 1 @,@ 704 m ) . 
 West of the summit , the Extraterrestrial Highway descends into the Sand Spring Valley and the community of Rachel becomes visible . The small town of about 50 residents is little more than homes and a few businesses . The Little A <unk> <unk> ( pronounced " alien " ) is the focal point of the town , providing a small motel , an alien @-@ themed restaurant / bar , and extraterrestrial souvenirs . The civilian @-@ run Area 51 Research Center , based out of a yellow house trailer and documenting paranormal activity in the area , closed in 2001 . 
 Leaving Rachel , SR 375 continues northwest to enter Nye County . The route climbs out of Sand Spring Valley and heads over the 5 @,@ 935 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 809 m ) Queen City Summit , the highest point on the highway . After passing the summit , the route descends into the southern end of Railroad Valley , curving nearly due north for several miles as it follows the base of Reveille Range . As the mountains subside , the road turns westward again to head to its northern terminus at the junction of US 6 at Warm Springs .

 An unimproved road approximating the present alignment of State Route 375 came into existence by 1932 . This route , christened State Route 25A , connected Crystal Springs to State Route 4 ( now US 6 ) just east of Tonopah . By 1933 , SR 25A had been renumbered to become a new western segment of State Route 25 . The route underwent periodic realignments over the next few years , but the highway 's terminal junctions remained mostly unchanged . 
 In 1942 , SR 25 appeared to have a significant gap in its route . State maps from the time show a large area within Nye and Lincoln Counties where all roads had been removed . The route existed in one piece again by 1946 , although it had been realigned northward and shortened to 111 miles ( 179 km ) . A sizable portion of SR 25 passing through the Tonopah U.S. Army Air Force Bombing Range ( now the Nellis Air Force Range and Nevada Test Site ) was restricted from public travel by 1950 , the restricted section being approximately the same area that was removed in 1942 . To avoid the restricted area of the testing range , the west end of SR 25 was realigned by 1957 . The highway connected to US 6 at Warm Springs about 37 miles ( 60 km ) east of the previous terminus , heading north around the Reveille Range instead of climbing the Kawich Range within the bombing area . 
 With the 1957 realignment , the routing of SR 25 attained its final form . The entire highway was paved by the following year . SR 25 remained unchanged until the 1976 renumbering of Nevada 's state highways , through which the western section of SR 25 became the new State Route 375 . The new route number was first seen on the 1978 edition of the official state highway map .

 In 1989 , an engineer named Bob Lazar claimed to have worked on alien spaceships and to have viewed saucer test flights in <unk> Valley , telling his story to a Las Vegas television station which was subsequently broadcast as an exclusive report . By the 1990s , stories of the top @-@ secret U.S. government base at Area 51 had become mainstream , and many books and personal accounts had been published regarding extraterrestrial spacecraft and alien activity in the region surrounding Groom Lake . Rachel , being the closest settlement to the restricted facility , attracted people in search of UFOs and alien life . To capitalize on the purported paranormal activity along the route , the Nevada Commission on Tourism sought to rename the highway . State officials drew inspiration from the alien legends and dubbed SR 375 the Extraterrestrial Highway in February 1996 . The tourism commission hoped that the renaming would " draw travelers to the austere and remote reaches of south @-@ central Nevada , where old atomic bomb test sites , secret Defense Department airstrips and huge , sequestered tracts of military land create a marketable mystique . " 
 News of the highway 's renaming reached Twentieth Century Fox . The studio used the opportunity to promote the release of the film Independence Day , whose plot involves an alien invasion of Earth and the secret facility at Area 51 . A public dedication ceremony for the Extraterrestrial Highway was held in Rachel in April 1996 . State dignitaries at the ceremony were joined by studio executives and Independence Day stars Jeff Goldblum , Robert Loggia , Bill Pullman , and Brent Spiner . Nevada Governor Bob Miller presided over the ceremony , speaking with humorous space references and unveiling special " Extraterrestrial Highway 375 " and " Speed Limit Warp 7 " signs for the highway . The event concluded with several guests placing items related to Nevada and the film into a time capsule commemorating the occasion . 
 To promote the Extraterrestrial Highway after its renaming , the tourism commission launched " The ET Experience " in July 1996 . Tourists could contact the Nevada Commission on Tourism to receive a traveler 's kit containing information about the highway , nearby cultural attractions , and area services . Visitors that patronized businesses in Rachel and central Nevada and submitted an account of their journey received Extraterrestrial Highway memorabilia . Stories from travelers were also published in a newsletter available to those that had completed the experience . Despite tourism generated by people searching for signs of alien life , only " an average of about 200 cars drive some portion of the Extraterrestrial Highway every day , making it one of the state ’ s least traveled routes . " 
 In keeping with the supposed alien links of the area , in 2006 KFC established what was said to be the first corporate logo visible from space , made from eight thousand square metres of tiles and sited about two hundred metres from the highway .

 = Sherlock Holmes Baffled = 
 Sherlock Holmes Baffled is a very short American silent film created in 1900 with cinematography by Arthur Marvin . It is the earliest known film to feature Arthur Conan Doyle 's detective character Sherlock Holmes , albeit in a form unlike that of later screen incarnations . The inclusion of the character also makes it the first recorded detective film . In the film , a thief who can appear and disappear at will steals a sack of items from Sherlock Holmes . At each point , Holmes 's attempts to thwart the intruder end in failure . 
 Originally shown in Mutoscope machines in arcades , Sherlock Holmes Baffled has a running time of 30 seconds . Although produced in 1900 , it was only registered in 1903 , and a copyright notice stating this is seen on some prints . The identities of the actors playing the first screen Holmes and his assailant are not recorded . Assumed to be lost for many years , the film was rediscovered in 1968 as a paper print in the Library of Congress .

 Sherlock Holmes enters his drawing room to find it being burgled , but on confronting the villain is surprised when the latter disappears . Holmes initially attempts to ignore the event by lighting a cigar , but upon the thief 's reappearance , Holmes tries to reclaim the sack of stolen goods , drawing a pistol from his dressing gown pocket and firing it at the intruder , who vanishes . After Holmes recovers his property , the bag vanishes from his hand into that of the thief , who promptly disappears through a window . At this point the movie ends abruptly with Holmes looking " baffled " . 
 = = Production = = 
 The film was produced by the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company and was intended to be shown on the Mutoscope , an early motion picture device , patented by Herman Casler in 1894 . Like Thomas Edison 's Kinetoscope the Mutoscope did not project on a screen , and provided viewing to only one person at a time . Cheaper and simpler than the Kinetoscope , the system marketed by the American Mutoscope Company quickly dominated the coin @-@ in @-@ the @-@ slot " peep @-@ show " business . 
 The Mutoscope worked on the same principle as a flip book , with individual image frames printed onto flexible cards attached to a circular core which revolved with the turn of a user @-@ operated hand crank . The cards were lit by electric light bulbs inside the machine , a system devised by Arthur Marvin 's brother , Henry , one of the founders of the Biograph company . Earlier machines had relied on reflected natural light . 
 To avoid violating Edison 's patents , Biograph cameras from 1895 to 1902 used a large @-@ format film measuring 2 @-@ 23 / 32 inches ( 68 mm ) wide , with an image area of 2 × 2 ½ inches , four times that of Edison 's 35 mm format . Biograph film was not ready @-@ perforated ; the camera itself punched a sprocket hole on each side of the frame as the film was exposed at 30 frames per second . Sherlock Holmes Baffled ran to 86 @.@ 56 metres in length , giving the film a running time of 30 seconds ( although in practice , due to the hand @-@ cranked gearing of the Mutoscope this would have varied ) . 
 The director and cinematographer of Sherlock Holmes Baffled was Arthur W. Marvin ( May 1859 – 18 January 1911 ) , a staff cameraman for Biograph . Marvin completed over 418 short films between 1897 and 1911 , and was known for filming vaudeville entertainers . He later became known as the cameraman for the early silent films of D. W. Griffith . The identities of the first screen Holmes and his assailant are not recorded . 
 Biograph films before 1903 were mostly actualities ( documentary footage of actual persons , places and events ) , but Sherlock Holmes Baffled is an example of an early Biograph comedy narrative film , produced at the company 's rooftop studio on Broadway in New York City . According to Christopher Redmond 's Sherlock Holmes Handbook , the film was shot on April 26 , 1900 . Julie <unk> states that the film was released in May of the same year . Despite being in circulation , Sherlock Holmes Baffled was only registered on February 24 , 1903 , and this is the date seen on the film 's copyright title card . The occasionally suggested date of 1905 is probably due to confusion with a Vitagraph film titled Adventures of Sherlock Holmes ; or , Held for Ransom ( 1905 ) . 
 = = Rediscovery = = 
 The film was assumed to have been lost for many years until a paper copy was identified in 1968 in the Library of Congress Paper Print archive by Michael Pointer , a historian of Sherlock Holmes films . Because motion pictures were not covered by copyright laws until 1912 , paper prints were submitted by studios wishing to register their works . These were made using light @-@ sensitive paper of the same width and length as the film itself , and developed as though a still photograph . Both the Edison Company and the Biograph Company submitted entire motion pictures as paper prints , and it is in this form that most of them survive . The film has subsequently been transferred to 16 mm film in the Library of Congress collection . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 The plot of Sherlock Holmes Baffled is unrelated to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's canonical Sherlock Holmes stories ; it is likely that the character 's name was used purely for its familiarity with the public . Shot from a single point of view on a stage set , the intention of Sherlock Holmes Baffled was probably to act as a showcase for basic film trickery and film editing effects , particularly the stop trick first developed four years earlier in 1896 by French director Georges Méliès . 
 Sherlock Holmes Baffled marks the first in an observable trend of early film @-@ makers to show the character as a figure of fun ; in this case the somewhat <unk> dressed Holmes is left " baffled " by a burglar , in contrast with the detective prowess displayed by his literary namesake . William K. Everson in his book The Detective in Film noted that Sherlock Holmes Baffled , in common with all other silent detective films " labored under the difficulty of not being able to conduct prolonged interrogations or oral deductions ... the stress was on mystery or physical action rather than on literary @-@ derived <unk> . " It was only in 1916 that William Gillette 's Sherlock Holmes attempted a serious adaptation of Conan Doyle 's character . Michael Pointer has suggested that the appearance and costume of the anonymous actor in Sherlock Holmes Baffled is an imitation of Gillette 's stage portrayal of Holmes . Gillette 's play Sherlock Holmes had made its Broadway debut at the Garrick Theater on November 6 , 1899 . 
 Michael Pointer 's report on the rediscovery of Sherlock Holmes Baffled in 1968 stated " it is an early trick film clearly made for viewing on a <unk> or <unk> machine . Although a tiny , trivial piece , it is historic as being the earliest known use of Sherlock Holmes in moving pictures . " By extension of being the first Sherlock Holmes story , the inclusion of the character also makes it the first known example of a detective film . It has been posited that Sherlock Holmes has become the most prolific screen character in the history of cinema . 
 = John Winthrop = 
 John Winthrop ( 12 January 1587 / 88 – 26 March 1649 ) was a wealthy English Puritan lawyer and one of the leading figures in the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony , the first major settlement in what is now New England after Plymouth Colony . Winthrop led the first large wave of immigrants from England in 1630 , and served as governor for 12 of the colony 's first 20 years of existence . His writings and vision of the colony as a Puritan " city upon a hill " dominated New England colonial development , influencing the governments and religions of neighboring colonies . 
 Born into a wealthy landowning and merchant family , Winthrop was trained in the law , and became Lord of the Manor at Groton in Suffolk . Although he was not involved in the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Company in 1628 , he became involved in 1629 when the anti @-@ Puritan King Charles I began a crackdown on Nonconformist religious thought . In October 1629 he was elected governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony , and in April 1630 he led a group of colonists to the New World , founding a number of communities on the shores of Massachusetts Bay and the Charles River . 
 Between 1629 and his death in 1649 , he served 19 annual terms as governor or lieutenant @-@ governor , and was a force of comparative moderation in the religiously conservative colony , clashing with the more conservative Thomas Dudley and the more liberal Roger Williams and Henry Vane . Although Winthrop was a respected political figure , his attitude toward governance was somewhat authoritarian : he resisted attempts to widen voting and other civil rights beyond a narrow class of religiously approved individuals , opposed attempts to codify a body of laws that the colonial magistrates would be bound by , and also opposed unconstrained democracy , calling it " the meanest and worst of all forms of government " . The authoritarian and religiously conservative nature of Massachusetts rule was influential in the formation of neighboring colonies , which were in some instances formed by individuals and groups opposed to the rule of the Massachusetts elders . 
 Winthrop 's son , John , was one of the founders of the Connecticut Colony , and Winthrop himself wrote one of the leading historical accounts of the early colonial period . His long list of descendants includes famous Americans , and his writings continue to influence politicians today . 
 = = Life in England = = 
 John Winthrop was born on 12 January 1587 / 8 to Adam and Anne ( née Browne ) Winthrop in <unk> , Suffolk , England . His birth was recorded in the parish register at Groton . His father 's family had been successful in the textile business , and his father was a lawyer and prosperous landowner with several properties in Suffolk . His mother 's family was also well @-@ to @-@ do , with properties in Suffolk and Essex . When Winthrop was young his father became a director at Trinity College , Cambridge . When Winthrop 's uncle John ( Adam 's brother ) emigrated to Ireland , the Winthrop family took up residence at Groton Manor . 
 Winthrop was first tutored at home by John Chaplin and was assumed to have attended grammar school at Bury St. Edmunds . He was also regularly exposed to religious discussions between his father and clergymen , and thus came at an early age to a deep understanding of divinity . He was admitted to Trinity College in December 1602 , matriculating at the university a few months later . Among the students that he would have interacted with were John Cotton , and John Wheelwright , two men who would also have important roles in New England . He was a close childhood and university friend of William Spring , later a Puritan Member of Parliament , with whom he would correspond for the rest of his life . The teenage Winthrop admitted in his diary of the time to " lusts ... so masterly as no good could fasten upon me . " Biographer Francis Bremer suggests that Winthrop 's need to control his baser impulses may have prompted him to leave school early and marry at an unusually early age . 
 In 1604 Winthrop journeyed to Great Stambridge in Essex with a friend . They stayed at the home of a family friend , and Winthrop was favorably impressed with their daughter , Mary Forth . Winthrop left Trinity College to marry Mary on 16 April 1605 at Great Stambridge . Mary bore him five children , of whom only three survived to adulthood . The oldest of their children was John Winthrop , the Younger , who became a governor and magistrate of Connecticut . Their last two children , two girls , died not long after birth , and Mary died in 1615 from complications of the last birth . The couple spent most of their time at Great Stambridge , living on the Forth estate . In 1613 Adam Winthrop transferred the family holdings in Groton to Winthrop , who then became Lord of the Manor at Groton . 
 = = = Lord of the Manor = = = 
 As Lord of the Manor , Winthrop was deeply involved in the management of the estate , overseeing the agricultural activities and the manor house . He eventually followed his father in practicing law in London , which would have brought him into contact with the city 's business elite . He was also appointed to the county commission of the peace , a position that gave him a wider exposure among other lawyers and landowners , and a platform to advance what he saw as God 's kingdom . The commission 's responsibilities included overseeing countywide issues , including road and bridge maintenance , and the issuance of licenses . Some of its members were also empowered to act as local judges for minor offenses , although Winthrop was only able to exercise this authority in cases affecting his estate . The full commission met quarterly , and Winthrop forged a number of important connections through its activities . 
 Winthrop documented his religious life , keeping a journal beginning 1605 in which he described his religious experiences and feelings . In it , he described his failures to keep " divers vows " , and sought to reform his failings by God 's grace , praying that God would " give me a new heart , joy in his spirit ; that he would dwell with me " . Winthrop was somewhat distressed that his wife did not share the intensity of his religious feelings , but he eventually observed that " she proved after a right godly woman . " He was notably more intensely religious than his father , whose diaries dealt almost exclusively with secular matters . 
 When his wife Mary died in 1615 , Winthrop , following the custom of the time , remarried soon after , marrying Thomasine Clopton on 6 December 1615 . She was noticeably more pious than Mary had been : Winthrop wrote that she was " truly religious & industrious therein " . Thomasine died on 8 December 1616 from complications of childbirth ; the child did not survive . 
 In approximately 1613 ( records indicate it may have been earlier ) , Winthrop was enrolled at Gray 's Inn . There he read the law , but did not advance to the Bar . His legal connections introduced him to the Tyndal family of Great <unk> , Essex , and in 1617 he began courting Margaret Tyndal , the daughter of Sir John Tyndal , a chancery judge and his wife Anne Egerton , sister of the leading Puritan preacher Stephen Egerton . Her family was initially opposed to the match on financial grounds ; Winthrop countered by appealing to piety as a virtue that more than compensated for his modest income . The couple were married on 29 April 1618 at Great <unk> . They continued to live at Groton , although Winthrop necessarily divided his time between Groton and London , where he eventually acquired a highly desirable post in the Court of Wards and Liveries . His eldest son John sometimes assisted Margaret with the management of the estate while he was away . 
 = = = Decision to emigrate = = = 
 In the mid to late 1620s , the religious atmosphere in England began to look bleak for Puritans and other groups whose adherents believed the English Reformation was in danger . King Charles I had ascended the throne in 1624 , and he had married a Roman Catholic . Charles was opposed to all manner of recusants , and supported the Church of England in its efforts against religious groups like the Puritans that did not adhere fully to its teachings and practices . This atmosphere of intolerance to their views led Puritan religious and business leaders to consider emigration to the New World as a viable means to escape persecution . 
 The first successful religious colonization of the New World occurred in 1620 with the establishment of the Plymouth Colony on the shores of Cape Cod Bay . An effort in 1624 orchestrated by pastor John White led to a short @-@ lived colony at Cape Ann , also on the Massachusetts coast . In 1628 some of the investors in that effort joined with new investors to acquire a land grant for the territory roughly between the Charles and Merrimack Rivers . First styled the New England Company , it was renamed the Massachusetts Bay Company in 1629 after it acquired a royal charter , granting it permission to govern the territory . Shortly after acquiring the land grant in 1628 , it sent a small group of settlers led by John Endecott to prepare the way for further migration . John Winthrop was apparently not involved in any of these early activities , which involved primarily individuals from Lincolnshire ; however , by early 1629 he was probably aware of the company 's activities and plans . The exact connection by which he became involved with the company is uncertain , because there were many indirect connections between Winthrop and individuals directly associated with the company . Winthrop was also aware of attempts to colonize other places — his son Henry became involved in efforts to settle Barbados in 1626 , which Winthrop financially supported for a time . 
 In March 1629 King Charles dissolved Parliament , beginning eleven years of rule without Parliament . This action apparently raised new concerns among the company 's principals ; in the company 's July meeting , Governor Matthew Cradock proposed that the company reorganize itself and transport its charter and governance to the colony . It also worried Winthrop , who lost his position in the Court of Wards and Liveries in the crackdown on Puritans that followed the dissolution of Parliament . He wrote , " If the Lord <unk> it <unk> good for us , he will provide a shelter & a <unk> place for us and others " . During the following months , Winthrop became more involved with the company , meeting with others in Lincolnshire . By early August he had emerged as a significant proponent of emigration , and on 12 August he circulated a paper providing eight separate reasons in favor of emigration . His name appears in formal connection with the company on the Cambridge Agreement , signed 26 August ; this document provided means for emigrating shareholders to buy out non @-@ emigrating shareholders of the company . 
 The company shareholders met on 20 October to enact the changes agreed to in August . Since Governor Cradock was not emigrating , a new governor needed to be chosen . Winthrop was seen as the most dedicated of the three candidates proposed to replace Cradock , and won the election . The other two , Richard Saltonstall and John Humphrey , had many other interests , and their dedication to the cause of settling in Massachusetts was viewed as uncertain . Humphrey was chosen as deputy governor , a post he relinquished the following year when he decided to delay his emigration . 
 Winthrop , along with other company officials , then began the process of arranging a transport fleet and supplies for the migration . He also worked to recruit individuals with special skills the new colony would require , including pastors to see to the colony 's spiritual needs . 
 It was unclear to Winthrop when his wife would come over ; she was pregnant and due to give birth in April 1630 , near the fleet 's departure time . They consequently decided that she would not come over until a later time ; it would not be until 1631 that the couple was reunited in the New World . To maintain some connection with his wife during their separation , the couple agreed to think of each other between the hours of 5 and 6 in the evening each Monday and Friday . Winthrop also worked to convince his grown children to join the migration ; John , Jr. and Henry both decided to do so , but only Henry sailed in the 1630 fleet . 
 By April 1630 Winthrop had put most of his affairs in order . Groton Manor had not yet been sold , because of a long @-@ running title dispute . The legal dispute was only resolved after his departure , and the property 's sale was finalized by Margaret before she and John Jr. left for the colony . 
 = = = Coat of Arms = = = 
 John Winthrop used a coat of arms that was reportedly confirmed by the College of Arms , London , to his paternal uncle in 1592 . It was also used by his sons . These arms appear on his tombstone in the King 's Chapel Burying Ground . It is also as the coat of arms for Winthrop House at Harvard University and are displayed on the still intact 1675 house of his youngest son , Deane Winthrop at the Deane Winthrop House . The heraldic blazon of arms is : Argent three <unk> Gules overall a lion rampant Sable .

 On 8 April 1630 , four ships left the Isle of Wight , carrying Winthrop and other leaders of the colony . Winthrop sailed on the Arbella , accompanied by his two young sons , Samuel and Stephen . The ships were part of a larger fleet , totalling 11 ships , that would carry about 700 migrants to the colony . Winthrop 's son Henry Winthrop missed the Arbella 's sailing , and ended up on the Talbot , which also sailed from Wight . Winthrop wrote a sermon entitled A Modell of Christian Charity , which was delivered either before or during the crossing . It described the ideas and plans to keep the Puritan society strong in faith as well as comparing the struggles that they would have to overcome in the New World to the story of Exodus . In it he used the now famous phrase " City upon a Hill " to describe the ideals to which the colonists should strive , and that consequently " the eyes of all people are upon us . " Winthrop also said , " in all times some must be rich some poore , some highe and eminent in power and <unk> ; others <unk> and in subjection " , and in short meant that there were those who were rich and successful and others who were poor and subservient to others . But Winthrop also said that although these two groups were different both were equally important to the colony because both groups were members to the same community . 
 Upon the fleet 's arrival at Salem in June , the new colonists were welcomed by John Endecott . Winthrop and his deputy , Thomas Dudley , found the Salem area inadequate for creating a settlement suitable for all of the arriving colonists , and embarked on surveying expeditions of the area . They first decided to base the colony at Charlestown , but a lack of good water there prompted them to instead move to the Shawmut Peninsula , where they founded what is now the city of Boston . Because the season was relatively late , the colonists decided to establish dispersed settlements along the coast and the banks of the Charles River in order to avoid presenting a single point that hostile forces might attack . The colony struggled with disease in its early months , losing as many as 200 people , including Winthrop 's son Henry , in 1630 , to a variety of causes and about 80 others who returned to England in the spring due to these conditions . Winthrop set an example to the other colonists in joining servants and laborers in the work of the colony . According to one report , he " fell to work with his own hands , and thereby so encouraged the rest that there was not an idle person to be found in the whole plantation . " 
 Winthrop built his house in Boston , where he also had a relatively spacious plot of arable land . In 1631 he was granted a larger parcel of land on the banks of the Mystic River that he called Ten Hills Farm . On the other side of the Mystic was the shipyard owned in absentia by Matthew Cradock , where one of the colony 's first boats , Winthrop 's Blessing of the Bay , was built . Winthrop operated her as a trading and packet ship up and down the coast of New England . 
 The issue of where to locate the colony 's capital caused the first in a series of rifts between Winthrop and Dudley . Dudley had constructed his home at Newtown ( present @-@ day Harvard Square , Cambridge ) after the council had agreed the capital would be established there . However , Winthrop decided instead to build his home in Boston when asked by its residents to stay there . This upset Dudley , and their relationship worsened when Winthrop criticized Dudley for what he perceived as excessive decorative woodwork in his house . However , they seemed to reconcile after their children were married . Winthrop recounts the two of them , each having been granted land near Concord , going to stake their claims . At the boundary between their lands , a pair of boulders were named the Two Brothers " in remembrance that they were brothers by their children 's marriage " . Dudley 's lands became Bedford , and Winthrop 's Billerica . 
 = = = Colonial governance = = = 
 The colony 's charter called for a governor , deputy governor , and 18 assistant magistrates ( who served as a precursor to the idea of a Governor 's Council ) , who were all to be elected annually by the freemen of the colony . The first meeting of the General Court consisted of exactly eight men . They decided that the governor and deputy should be elected by the assistants , in violation of the charter ; under these rules Winthrop was elected governor three times . The general court admitted a significant number of settlers , but also established a rule requiring all freemen to be local church members . In 1633 and 1634 , following the appointment of the strongly anti @-@ Puritan William Laud as Archbishop of Canterbury , the colony saw a large influx of immigrants . 
 When the 1634 election was set to take place , delegations of freemen sent by the towns insisted on seeing the charter , from which they learned that the colony 's lawmaking authority and that the election of governor and deputy rested with the freemen , not the assistants . Winthrop acceded on the point of the elections , which were thereafter conducted by secret ballot by the freemen , but he also observed that lawmaking would be unwieldy if conducted by the now relatively large number of freemen . A compromise was reached in which each town would select two delegates to send to the general court as representatives of its interests . In an ironic twist , Thomas Dudley , an opponent of popular election , won the 1634 election for governor , with Roger Ludlow as deputy . Winthrop , as he had after previous elections , graciously invited his fellow magistrates to dinner . 
 In the late 1630s the seeming arbitrariness of judicial decisions led to calls for the creation of a body of laws that would bind the opinions of magistrates . Winthrop opposed these moves , and used his power to repeatedly stall and obstruct efforts to enact them . His opposition was rooted in a strong belief in the common law tradition and the desire , as a magistrate , to have flexibility in deciding cases on their unique circumstances . He also pointed out that adoption of written laws " repugnant to the laws of England " was not allowed in the charter , and that some of the laws to be adopted likely opposed English law . The Massachusetts Body of Liberties was formally adopted during Richard Bellingham 's governorship in 1641 . Some of the laws enacted in Massachusetts were cited as reasons for vacating the colonial charter in 1684 . 
 In the 1640s constitutional issues concerning the power of the magistrates and assistants arose . In a case involving an escaped pig , the assistants ruled in favor of a merchant who had allegedly taken a widow 's errant animal . She appealed to the general court , which ruled in her favor . The assistants then asserted their right to veto the general court 's decision , sparking the controversy . Winthrop argued that the assistants , as experienced magistrates , must be able to check the democratic institution of the general court , because " a democracy is , amongst most civil nations , accounted the meanest and worst of all forms of government . " Winthrop became the focus of allegations about the arbitrary rule of the magistrates in 1645 , when he was formally charged with interfering with local decisions in a case involving the Hingham militia . The case centered around the disputed appointment of a new commander , and a panel of magistrates headed by Winthrop had had several parties on both sides of the dispute imprisoned pending a meeting of the court of assistants . Peter Hobart , the minister in Hingham and one of several Hobarts on one side of the dispute , vociferously questioned the authority of the magistrates and railed against Winthrop specifically for what he characterized as arbitrary and tyrannical actions . Winthrop defused the matter by stepping down from the bench to appear before it as a defendant . Winthrop successfully defended himself , pointing out that not only had he not acted alone , but that judges are not usually criminally culpable for errors they make on the bench , and that the dispute in Hingham was serious enough that it required the intervention of the magistrates . Winthrop was acquitted and the complainants were fined . 
 One major issue that Winthrop was involved in occurred in 1647 , when a petition was submitted to the general court concerning the limitation of voting rights to freemen who had been formally admitted to a local church . Winthrop and the other magistrates rejected the appeal that " civil liberty and freedom be forthwith granted to all truly English " , and even fined and imprisoned the principal signers of the petition . William Vassal and Robert Child , two of the signatories , pursued complaints against the Massachusetts government in England over this and other issues .

 In 1634 and 1635 Winthrop served as an assistant , while the influx of migrants brought first John Haynes and then Henry Vane to the governorship . These two men , along with Anne Hutchinson and pastors Thomas Hooker and John Wheelwright , espoused religious or political views that were at odds with those of the earlier arrivals , including Winthrop . Hutchinson and Wheelwright subscribed to the Antinomian view that following religious laws was not required for salvation , while Winthrop and others believed in a more Legalist view . This religious rift , commonly called the Antinomian Controversy , significantly divided the colony , and Winthrop saw the other side 's beliefs as a particularly unpleasant and dangerous heresy . By December 1636 the dispute reached into colonial politics , and Winthrop , in a bid to bridge the divide between the two factions , penned an account of his religious awakening and theological position papers designed to facilitate a harmonization of the opposing views . How widely these documents circulated is not known ( and not all of them have survived ) , but the Legalist pastor Thomas Shepard reacted in a way that biographer Francis Bremer describes as " horrified " , and containing " a color of Arminianism , which I believe your [ Winthrop 's ] soul abhors . " In the 1637 election , Vane was turned out of all offices , and Dudley was elected governor . 
 His election did not immediately quell the controversy . First John Wheelwright and later Anne Hutchinson were put on trial , and both were banished from the colony . ( Hutchinson founded Portsmouth , Rhode Island and Wheelwright founded first Exeter , New Hampshire and then Wells , Maine in order to be free of Massachusetts rule . ) Winthrop was active in arguing against their supporters , but Shepard criticized him for being too moderate , claiming Winthrop should " make their wickedness and guile manifest to all men that they may go no farther and then will sink of themselves . " Hooker and Haynes had left Massachusetts in 1636 and 1637 for new settlements on the Connecticut River ( the nucleus of the Connecticut Colony ) , and Vane left for England after the 1637 election , suggesting he might seek to acquire a commission as a governor general to overturn the colonial government . ( Vane never returned to the colony , and became an important figure in Parliament before and during the English Civil Wars ; he was beheaded after the Restoration . ) 
 In the aftermath of the 1637 election , the general court passed new rules on residency in the colony , forbidding anyone from housing newcomers for more than 3 weeks without approval from the magistrates . Winthrop vigorously defended this rule against protests , arguing that Massachusetts was within its rights to " refuse to receive such whose dispositions suit not with ours " . Ironically , some of those who protested the policy had been in favor of the banishment in 1635 of Roger Williams . Winthrop , who was then out of office , actually had a good relationship with the controversial Baptist . When the magistrates ordered Williams ' arrest , Winthrop warned him , making possible his flight that resulted in the establishment of Providence , Rhode Island . Winthrop and Williams also later had an epistolary relationship in which they discussed their religious differences . 
 = = = Indian policy = = = 
 Winthrop 's attitudes toward the local Native American populations was generally one of civility and diplomacy . He described an early meeting with one local chief : " <unk> came with his [ chiefs ] and squaws , and presented the governor with a hogshead of Indian corn . After they had all dined , and had each a small cup of sack and beer , and the men tobacco , he sent away all his men and women ( though the governor would have stayed them in regard of the rain and thunder . ) Himself and one squaw and one [ chief ] stayed all night ; and being in English clothes , the governor set him at his own table , where he behaved himself as soberly ... as an Englishman . The next day after dinner he returned home , the governor giving him cheese , and pease , and a mug , and other small things . " 
 Although the colonists generally sought to acquire title to the lands they occupied in the early years , they also practiced a policy that historian Alfred Cave calls vacuum <unk> : if land is not under some sort of active use , it is free for the taking . This meant that lands that were only used seasonally by the natives ( e.g. for fishing or hunting ) , which otherwise appeared to be empty , could be claimed . Winthrop claimed that the rights of " more advanced " peoples superseded the rights of the hunter @-@ gatherers . 
 However , cultural differences and trade issues between the colonists and the natives meant that clashes were inevitable , and the Pequot War was the first major conflict the colony engaged in . Winthrop sat on the council that decided to send an expedition under John Endecott to raid native villages on Block Island in the war 's first major action , but his communication with Williams encouraged the latter to convince the Narragansetts to side with the English against the Pequots , their traditional enemies . The war ended in 1637 with the destruction of the Pequots as a tribe , whose survivors were scattered into other tribes , or shipped to the West Indies . 
 = = = Slavery and the slave trade = = = 
 Slavery , according to Puritan thought , was condoned in the Old Testament , and therefore was not considered sinful towards God . The institution already existed in the Massachusetts Bay area prior to John Winthrop 's arrival , since Samuel Maverick arrived in the area with slaves in 1624 , and Winthrop supported the practice . This is most clearly evident in the aftermath of the Pequot War , in which many of the captured Pequots were enslaved . The Massachusetts council , headed by Winthrop , approved this action . Male warriors , deemed dangerous to the colony , were shipped to the West Indies , while females and children were divided among the colonists . Winthrop recorded that the exported male Pequots were traded for " salt , cotton , tobacco , and Negroes " , and the practice of exporting captured Indians to exchange for goods and African slaves became a routine practice . Winthrop was known to keep three Pequot slaves , a male and two females . 
 In 1641 , the Massachusetts Body of Liberties was enacted , codifying ( among many other things ) rules about slavery . Winthrop was a member of the committee that drafted the code , but his role in drafting the slavery language is not known because records of the committee have not survived . Winthrop was generally opposed to the Body of Liberties because he favored a common law approach to legislation . 
 = = = Trade and diplomacy = = = 
 Rising tensions in England ( that culminated in civil war ) led to a significant reduction in the number of people and provisions arriving in the colonies , something noted by Winthrop in 1643 . The colonists consequently began to expand trade , interacting with other colonies , non @-@ English as well as English . These led to trading ventures with other Puritans on Barbados , a source of cotton , and with the neighboring French colony of Acadia . 
 French Acadia , covering the eastern half of present @-@ day Maine , as well as New Brunswick and Nova Scotia , was at the time embroiled in a minor civil war between competing administrators . After English colonists began trading with Charles de Saint @-@ Étienne de la Tour in 1642 , his opponent , Charles de Menou d 'Aulnay , warned Boston traders away from la Tour 's territories . In June 1643 la Tour came to Boston and requested military assistance against assaults by d 'Aulnay . Winthrop , then governor , refused official assistance , but allowed la Tour to recruit volunteers from the colony for service . This decision brought on a storm of criticism , principally from the magistrates of Essex County , which was geographically closest to the ongoing dispute . John Endecott was particularly critical , noting that Winthrop had given the French a chance to see the colonial defenses . The 1644 election became a referendum on Winthrop 's policy , and he was turned out of office . The Acadian dispute was eventually resolved with d 'Aulnay as the victor . In 1646 , with Winthrop again in the governor 's seat , d 'Aulnay appeared in Boston and demanded reparations for damage done by the English volunteers . Winthrop placated the French governor with the gift of a sedan chair , originally given to him by an English privateer . 
 = = = Property and family = = = 
 In addition to his responsibilities in the colonial government , Winthrop was a significant property owner . He owned the Ten Hills Farm , as well as land that would become the town of Billerica , Governors Island ( now the site of Logan International Airport ) in Boston Harbor , and Prudence Island in Narragansett Bay . He also engaged in the fur trade in partnership with William Pynchon , using the Blessing of the Bay to further that business . Governors Island was named for him , and remained in the Winthrop family until 1808 , when it was purchased for the construction of Fort Winthrop . 
 The farm at Ten Hills suffered from poor oversight on Winthrop 's part — the steward of the farm made questionable financial deals that in the early 1640s caused Winthrop to have a cash crisis . The colony insisted on paying him his salary ( something he had regularly refused to accept in the past ) , as well as his out @-@ of @-@ pocket expenses while engaged in official duties . Private subscriptions to support him raised about £ 500 and the colony also granted his wife 3 @,@ 000 acres ( 12 km2 ) of land . 
 His wife Margaret arrived on the second voyage of the Lyon in 1631 , but their baby daughter , Anne , died during the crossing . Two more children were born to the <unk> in New England before Margaret died on 14 June 1647 . Sometime after 20 December 1647 and before the birth of their only child in 1648 , Winthrop married his fourth wife , Martha Rainsborough . She was the widow of Thomas <unk> , and sister of Thomas and William <unk> . Winthrop died of natural causes on 26 March 1649 , and is buried in what is now called the King 's Chapel Burying Ground in Boston . He was survived by his wife Martha and five sons . 
 = = Writings and legacy = = 
 Though rarely published and relatively unappreciated for his literary contribution during his time , Winthrop spent his life continually producing written accounts of historical events and religious manifestations . Winthrop 's major contributions to the literary world were A Modell of Christian Charity ( 1630 ) and The History of New England ( 1630 – 1649 ; also known as The Journal of John Winthrop ) , which remained unpublished until the late 18th century . 
 = = = A Model of Christian Charity = = = 
 John Winthrop wrote and delivered the lay sermon that would be called A Modell of Christian Charity either before the 1630 crossing to North America or while en route . It described the ideas and plans to keep the Puritan society strong in faith as well as the struggles that they would have to overcome in the New World . He used the phrase " city upon a hill " ( derived from the Bible 's Sermon on the Mount : " You are the light of the world . A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden " ) to characterize the colonists ' endeavour as part of a special pact with God to create a holy community . He encouraged the colonists to " bear one another 's burdens " , and to view themselves as a " Company of Christ , bound together by Love . " He told the colonists to be stricter in their religious conformance than even the Church of England , and to view as their objective the establishment of a model state . If they did so , God would " make us a <unk> and glory , that man shall say of succeeding <unk> : the lord make it like that of New England . " 
 Winthrop 's sermon is often characterized as a forerunner to the concept of American exceptionalism . Recent research has shown , however , that the speech was not given much attention at the time of its delivery , unlike the farewell sermon of John Cotton . Furthermore , Winthrop did not introduce any significant new concepts , but merely repeated what were widely held Puritan beliefs . The work was not published until the nineteenth century , although it was known , and circulated in manuscript before that time . 
 = = = The History of New England = = = 
 Starting with the voyage across the Atlantic and continuing through Winthrop 's time in Massachusetts , he kept a journal of his life and experiences . Originally written in three notebooks , his account has been acknowledged as the " central source for the history of Massachusetts in the 1630s and 1640s " . The first two notebooks were published in 1790 by Noah Webster . The third notebook , long thought lost , was rediscovered in 1816 , and the complete journals were published in 1825 and 1826 by James Savage as The History of New England from 1630 – 1649 . By John Winthrop , Esq . First Governor of the Colony of the Massachusetts Bay . From his Original Manuscripts . The second notebook was destroyed in a fire at Savage 's office in 1825 ; the other two volumes now belong to the Massachusetts Historical Society . A modern preparation combining new analysis of the surviving volumes and Savage 's transcription of the second notebook was prepared in 1996 by Richard Dunn and Laetitia <unk> . 
 The journal began as a nearly day @-@ to @-@ day recounting of the ocean crossing . As time progressed he made entries less frequently , and wrote them up at a greater length , so that by the 1640s the work began to take the shape of a history . Winthrop wrote primarily of his private accounts : his journey from England , the arrival of his wife and children to the colony in 1631 , and the birth of his son in 1632 . He also wrote profound insights into the nature of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and nearly all important events of the day . The majority of his early journal entries were not intended to be literary , but merely observations of early New England life . Gradually , the focus of his writings shifted from his personal observations to broader spiritual ideologies and behind @-@ the @-@ scenes views of political matters . 
 = = = Other works = = = 
 Winthrop 's earliest publication was likely The Humble Request of His Majesties Loyal Subjects ( London , 1630 ) , which defended the emigrants ' physical separation from England and reaffirmed their loyalty to the Crown and Church of England . This work was republished by Joshua <unk> in the 1696 compilation <unk> : or The first Planters of New @-@ England , The End and Manner of their coming thither , and Abode there : In several <unk> . 
 In addition to his more famous works , Winthrop produced a number of writings , both published and unpublished . While living in England , Winthrop articulated his belief " in the validity of experience " in a private religious journal , known as his <unk> . This journal , in which he wrote intermittently between 1607 and 1637 , was a sort of confessional , very different in tone and style to the Journal . Later in his life , Winthrop wrote A Short Story of the rise , reign , and ruine of the Antinomians , Familists and Libertines , that Infected the Churches of New England , which described the Antinomian controversy surrounding Anne Hutchinson in 1636 and 1637 . The work was first published in London in 1644 . At the time of its publication there was much discussion about the nature of church governance , and the Westminster Assembly of Divines had recently begun to meet . The evidence it presented was seen by supporters of Congregationalism as evidence of its worth , and by English opponents as evidence of its failings . In some of its editions it was adapted by opponents of Henry Vane , who had become a leading Independent political leader in the discussion . Vane 's opponents sought to " tie Toleration round the neck of Independency , stuff the two struggling monsters into one sack , and sink them to the bottom of the sea . " 
 According to biographer Francis Bremer , Winthrop 's writings echoed those of other Puritans : " William Bradford 's Of Plymouth Plantation ( unpublished until 1856 ) , Edward Johnson 's Wonder @-@ Working Providence of <unk> Saviour in New England ( 1654 ) , Cotton Mather 's <unk> Christi Americana ( 1702 ) , and Winthrop 's Journal were efforts both to discern the divine pattern in events and to justify the role New Englanders believed themselves called to play . " 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 Winthrop 's reference to the " city upon a hill " in A Modell of Christian Charity has become an enduring symbol in American political discourse . Many leading American politicians , going back to revolutionary times , have cited Winthrop in their writings or speeches . Winthrop 's reputation suffered in the late 19th and early 20th century , when critics like Nathaniel Hawthorne and H. L. Mencken pointed out the negative aspects of Puritan rule , leading to modern assessments of him as a " lost Founding Father " . Political scientist Matthew Holland argues that Winthrop " is at once a significant founding father of America 's best and worst impulses " , with his calls for charity and public participation offset by rigid intolerance , <unk> and <unk> . But at heart he did truly want to be a good leader and once gave a speech to the General Court in July 1645 that there were two kinds of liberty : natural , liberty to do as one wished , " evil as well as good , " a liberty he believed should be restrained , and civil , liberty to do good . Winthrop strongly believed that civil liberty was " the proper end and object of authority " , meaning it was the duty of the government to be selfless for the people and promote justice instead of promoting the general welfare . Winthrop supports this point of view from his past actions such as when he passed laws requiring the heads of households to make sure their children and even their servants to receive proper education and for town to support teachers from public funds . <unk> actions were all for the unity of the colony because he believed that nothing was more crucial of a colony than working as a single unit that wouldn 't be split by any force , such as with the case of Anne Hutchinson . He was a leader respected by many , and even Richard Dummer , a principal <unk> disarmed for his activities , admired Winthrop and gave 100 pounds to him . 
 Despite the criticism , modern politicians as diverse as John F. Kennedy , Ronald Reagan , Michael Dukakis , and Sarah Palin , have all made reference to Winthrop 's writings in their speeches . Ronald Reagan described Winthrop as " an early ' Freedom Man ' " who came to America " looking for a home that would be free . " However , those like Reagan who praise Winthrop fail to note his strident anti @-@ democratic political tendencies . 
 Winthrop is a major character in Catharine Maria Sedgwick 's 1827 novel Hope Leslie , set in colonial Massachusetts . He also makes a brief appearance in Nathaniel Hawthorne 's The Scarlet Letter in the chapter entitled " The Minister 's Vigil . " 
 John Winthrop 's descendants number thousands today . In addition to his son John , who was the first governor of the Saybrook Colony , later generations of his family continued to play an active role in New England politics well into the 19th century . Twentieth century descendants include former Massachusetts Senator and current Secretary of State , John Kerry and educator Charles William Eliot . The towns of Winthrop , Massachusetts and Winthrop , Maine are named in his honor . Winthrop House at Harvard University , along with Winthrop Hall at Bowdoin College , is named in honor of him and of his descendant John Winthrop , who briefly served as President of Harvard . 
 He is also the namesake of three squares in Boston , Cambridge , and Brookline , and the Winthrop Building on Water Street in Boston , one of the city 's first skyscrapers , was built on the site of one of his homes . 
 = Swakeleys House = 
 Swakeleys House is a Grade I @-@ listed 17th @-@ century mansion in Ickenham , London Borough of Hillingdon , built in 1638 for the future Lord Mayor of London , Sir Edmund Wright . Originally the home of the lords of the manor of Swakeleys , writer Samuel Pepys visited the house twice . The property changed hands many times over the years and at one time was home to the Foreign & Commonwealth Office Sports Association . Large sections of the grounds were sold off in 1922 and developed as suburban housing . 
 Following a long period of decline , the house was purchased in the 1980s by a group of local residents and restored as part of its conversion to offices . It became a focal point for Ickenham during the biennial Ickenham Festival when the grounds were used to host the main gala day , until the house 's new owners restricted access in 2014 . Swakeleys is open in part once a year to the public as part of Open House London . Planning permission was granted in 2014 for the conversion of the house to form one large residential property .

 The manor of Swakeleys was named after Robert <unk> , 14th century owner of the manor , who is also recorded as " <unk> " . John Charlton later took ownership of Swakeleys but a relative of his was subsequently killed during the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 , while fighting on the side of Richard III . The victor of the battle , Henry VII , subsequently granted Charlton 's widow a life interest in the manor , although he gave possession to Sir Thomas Bourchier . The <unk> later passed Swakeleys to Sir John <unk> , from whom it then passed to the Earl of Devon , Henry Courteney , then Ralph <unk> . 
 The house was built for Sir Edmund Wright , who became Lord Mayor of London in 1640 . The brick structure dates from between 1629 and 1638 . In 1629 , Wright purchased the grounds from John Bingley , who had undertaken extensive remedial work on an existing 13th century structure in the grounds — probably timber @-@ framed and wattle filled . Bingley 's alterations were said to have been detrimental to the condition of the house and grounds . He was accused of driving away almost all the birds in the <unk> , and of pulling up many healthy fruit @-@ bearing trees from the orchard . The house had a moat , which Bingley filled in , believing the water to be unhealthy , at which point he also had a defensive brick wall built around the house . 
 The house is built in an " H " shape with a central section flanked by four projecting wings . Swakeleys was built of English Bond brick , with its windows framed with stone . Several of the exterior rain @-@ water heads show the year construction was completed along with the initials " E.W. " for Sir Edmund Wright . To the west of the house , a large lawn stretches out to what is now known as Swakeleys Lake . The main routes leading to the house have since become the residential streets Swakeleys Road ( then Back Lane ) , The Grove and The Avenue . 
 Inside , the main staircase is made of oak , and the fireplaces of marble . The 42 foot ( 13 m ) long by 23 foot ( 7 @.@ 0 m ) wide Great Chamber , also known as the Ball Room and the Long Gallery , originally had a pinewood floor . This was covered by new flooring after it became worn over time . The room is 16 foot ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) high , with the ceiling arranged in fifteen panels . Within the room is a wooden screen made for Sir James Harrington in 1655 by woodcarver John Colt and painted to resemble stone . On top of the screen sits a bust of Charles I flanked by two lions . In the Dining Room , the panelling is believed to be from the original house , which Sir Edmund was so impressed by that he had it incorporated into the new building . 
 = = = Subsequent ownership = = = 
 Wright 's son @-@ in @-@ law Sir James Harrington took over ownership from Sir Edmund . Harrington was a commissioner at the trial of Charles I and fled to France in 1660 upon the restoration of the monarchy . His wife , Lady Harrington , sold the house to Sir Robert Vyner . 
 Samuel Pepys visited the house in 1665 and noted some of its features , particularly the busts of Charles I , Lord Essex and Lord Fairfax and described the house as " a very pleasant place " . He visited the house twice to collect money on behalf of Charles II from Sir Robert Vyner who was a well @-@ known goldsmith . On one occasion , Sir Robert showed Pepys the body of a black boy who had worked at the house and died of tuberculosis . The body had been dried in an oven and kept in an open coffin and was then displayed to visitors . Sir Robert later became Lord Mayor of London in 1674 . After the house became empty in 1923 , workmen unsealed a cupboard near the servants ' quarters where it was believed the body was stored , though they found no trace of it . 
 Pepys wrote of his first visit : 
 Sir Robert died in 1688 , when Swakeleys passed to his nephew Thomas Vyner , whose son Robert sold it to Benjamin <unk> in 1741 on behalf of his sister @-@ in @-@ law 's son Benjamin . In 1750 , <unk> 's son sold the house to the Reverend Thomas Clarke , at that time rector of Ickenham . Clarke 's son Thomas <unk> Clarke succeeded his father in ownership of the house in 1796 . He was later found drowned in the River Pinn , which ran through the Swakeleys estate . Although the river was only 20 inches ( 51 cm ) deep , it was enough to cover his face and therefore cause drowning . An inquest was held which refused to return a suicide verdict as the coroner believed such a ruling would <unk> the Clarke family . 
 Edward Walford also wrote about Swakeleys House in 1893 , when he described it as " the most interesting Jacobean house in the whole county of Middlesex . The gardens are quaint and trim , laid out in something of the old @-@ fashioned style and a long avenue of elms adorns the front of the house to the south . " The avenue was developed as the residential road The Grove , though the elms were killed by Dutch elm disease in the 1960s . 
 While Albert Gilbey was the main tenant of the house in the 1890s , the All England Croquet Championships were held in the grounds . Gilbey later became High Sheriff of Middlesex in 1912 . The estate became significantly smaller following the disposal of 1 @,@ 382 acres ( 559 ha ) of the estate for development at an auction on 5 July 1922 . Warren Road , Swakeleys Drive , Court Road , Milton Road , Ivy House Road , The Avenue and Thornhill Road ( originally named Park Road ) were constructed while other land bordering the River Pinn was designated as public open land . Humphrey John Talbot bought the house to avoid it being demolished and eventually sold it to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Sports Association in 1927 , upon the condition he could remain as a tenant on the first floor . Swakeleys was requisitioned by the military during the Second World War when a searchlight battery operated within the grounds . The Foreign Office retained the house until 1955 when it was sold to the London Postal Region Sports Club . The club staged cricket matches with local teams from Ickenham and Uxbridge .

 Three local residents , Keith Chamberlain , Paul Newson and Simon <unk> , formed Swakeleys House Ltd as a non @-@ profit company to purchase the house in 1980 following a long period of deterioration . They then restored its key features and constructed new office buildings within the grounds to help finance the restoration works . In 1984 , a 25 year lease was negotiated with the Bristol @-@ Myers Squibb company and the house was opened to the public for three days a year . HRH Prince Philip the Duke of Edinburgh officially opened the newly refurbished house on 7 May 1985 . Swakeleys House Ltd went on to win the 1988 Country House Award for best conversion of a listed country house . 
 During 2012 , scenes for the film Great Expectations , and the television adaptation of Mr Stink , were filmed within the house .

 The Bristol @-@ Myers Squibb lease expired in 2009 and Swakeleys was sold to new owners who wished to reduce public access to one day a year , as part of Open House London . This new proposal was accepted by the London Borough of Hillingdon in June 2010 . 
 In 2014 , the new owner of Swakeleys , CES Properties ( Ickenham ) , received planning permission from Hillingdon Council to convert the house back into a single large residence , including 23 en @-@ suite bedrooms , a party pavilion and a stable . CES Properties placed restrictions on the staging of the Ickenham Festival that year , leading to the festival 's organising committee relocating its planned gala day and evening events to the nearby Vyners School . The festival had previously used the grounds of the house as a focal point for events . CES Properties placed the house up for sale in February 2015 for £ 45 million . 
 = I Was Here ( song ) = 
 " I Was Here " is a song recorded by American R & B recording artist Beyoncé from her fourth studio album , 4 ( 2011 ) . It was written by Diane Warren , while production was handled by Ryan Tedder , Brent Kutzle , and Kuk Harrell ; Beyoncé is credited on the vocal production . " I Was Here " is a reflective R & B ballad , in which Beyoncé vulnerably reviews her past , wanting to leave an impact on the world before her life comes to an end . Described as a " career song " by Warren , its development was motivated by the September 11 attacks in the United States . 
 " I Was Here " garnered mixed to positive reviews from music critics , most of whom criticized the song 's inclusion on the track @-@ listing of the album and expressed discomfort about Beyoncé worrying about her legacy and wanting to leave an impact on the world , given that she was still below thirty years . Critics , nevertheless , favored Beyoncé 's vocal performance on the song , which is complemented by piano keys and heavy drum beats . Following the release of 4 , " I Was Here " charted at number 131 on the UK Singles Chart , 74 on the Swiss Singles Chart , and 44 on the South Korea Gaon International Singles Chart in early July 2011 . Later , in 2012 , the song also appeared on several charts internationally . 
 A music video for the song was released on August 19 , 2012 and it features Beyoncé performing the song live at the United Nations General Assembly while images of volunteers doing humanitarian work were projected on the screen behind her . It was donated to the World Humanitarian Day and aimed to create social media history with one billion people sharing the message of doing something good for another person . Upon its release , it received positive reviews from music critics who praised the projections , Beyoncé 's vocal performance and her look . 
 In late July , the song was included on the soundtrack for the 2011 FIFA Women 's World Cup Final . " I Was Here " was also part of Beyoncé 's set list for her residency show 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé and was used in the Revel Presents : Beyoncé Live shows during an interlude . The live video from the DVD Live at Roseland : Elements of 4 appeared online on November 16 , 2011 containing Beyoncé 's home movies and professional highlights . " I Was Here " was covered by Lea Michele for Glee 's soundtrack album Glee : The Music , The Graduation Album ( 2012 ) .

 " I Was Here " was written by Diane Warren and was produced by Ryan Tedder , Brent Kutzle , Beyoncé and Kuk Harrell . " I Was Here " is the only song on the record that was not co @-@ written by Beyoncé . On June 1 , 2011 , Warren revealed in an interview for the New York Post 's <unk> that she wrote " the best [ song she has ] ever written " a week and a half ago and that Beyoncé had already recorded it for her fourth studio album 4 . She described it as " a career song and probably my favorite thing I 've ever written " . The development of " I Was Here " was motivated by the September 11 attacks . Warren wanted to work with Beyoncé since the Destiny 's Child eras , but admitted that " I Was Here " was the ideal timing , " I thought that the one artist who would be my dream to sing [ ' I Was Here ' ] would be Beyoncé . This is one of those magical stories where what is meant to be actually happens . " 
 In May 2011 , Warren played the song on a guitar over the phone to Beyoncé 's husband Jay @-@ Z , who then called her . Upon hearing " I Was Here " , Beyoncé got chills , and immediately made up her mind , " Oh my god , I have to have this song . " September 2011 was going to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks and Beyoncé thought that the song would perfectly complete her album , which had nearly reached completion . The mastering of 4 was delayed to allow Beyoncé to record the song . Warren was present at the recording sessions , which took place two days following her conversation with Beyoncé and Jay @-@ Z on the phone . She said , " There 's nothing better than to hear the song that you came up with [ sung back ] . It 's like your heart found another heart " , before adding : 
 I 've never had chills through my entire body like I had from hearing Beyoncé sing this song . ' I Was Here ' came from my soul and became the song that was coming from hers . In all my life , I have never heard anything as amazing as this . Hearing her sing ' I Was Here ' will forever be one of the best moments of my life , and I know that this song will touch many other lives as well . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " I Was Here " is a downtempo R & B ballad that is instrumentally based on synthesizers undercurrent , indie rock guitars , musical keyboards and big drums provided by Tedder and Kutzle . The sound of the song 's recurring hook uses a combination of a xylophone and a piano . According to the sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing at the website Musicnotes.com , " I Was Here " is written in the key of E minor with a 6 / 8 time signature and has a tempo of 37 beats per minute . The song follows a chord progression of Em – C – D – Dsus – Em – C – Em – C , and Beyoncé 's vocals span two octaves from E3 to E5 . 
 James Reed of The Boston Globe felt that " [ ' I Was Here ' ] is ' Halo ' on steroids — or Valium . " It features Beyoncé as the female protagonist , who wants to make her mark on this Earth before her time is up as she wants that the world remember her impact . Ian Walker of AbsolutePunk elaborated on the song 's composition : " ' I Was Here ' is Beyoncé 's monument to the ages . The song climbs higher and higher , chorus by chorus , until Beyoncé reaches her apex , delivering some of her best vocals on the album . The lyrics are a bit uninspired , overly triumphant but somewhat humble as the singer contemplates her mark on history . Although she has garnered massive amounts of acclaim through her storied career , Beyoncé is far from satisfied . " 
 " I Was Here " begins with quivering reverb and a plaintively plucked guitar setting a somber mood for about fifteen seconds before the beats begin alongside Beyoncé 's voice . Her vocals set a hushed and morbid tone on the song as she bring doses of edge and grit , singing : " I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time / Know there was something that meant something that I left behind / When I leave this world , I 'll leave no regrets / I 'll leave something to remember , So they won 't forget " . She further sings throughout the song , " The hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leaved that I made a difference " . Watery synths shimmer in the background before Beyoncé adopts an authoritative tone to chant the chorus lines : " I was here / I lived , I loved / I was here / I did , I 've done / Everything that I wanted / And it was more than I thought it would be / I will leave my mark so everyone will know / I was here " .

Georgette Cline of The Boombox gave the song a positive review stating that , although the lyrics are a bit on the morbid side , it works in Beyoncé 's favor , " proving she can tackle a myriad of subjects " . Matthew Horton of BBC criticized the song 's order of placement on the track list of 4 , stating that " ' Run the World ( Girls ) ' is tagged on like a bonus track following ' I Was Here ' , which sounds like the perfect ending for the album . " Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone also had the same view , saying it " disrupts the flow of up @-@ tempo songs on the second half 4 " . Perpetua however calls it a " showstopper " and added that it " work [ s ] well as a bittersweet emotional climax for the album " . Perpetua finished his review by saying that " ' I Was Here ' is the blustery ballad one would expect by a Beyoncé / Warren team @-@ up , and stands off as flat and generic when compared to the rest of 4 . " Another reviewer of the same magazine , Jody Rosen complimented Beyoncé 's vocals stating that she sings with authority ; however , he coined " I Was Here " as a low point on the album and added that it is " swamped in ' My Way ' -style self @-@ mythologizing . " 
 Steve Jones of USA Today showed appreciation for " I Was Here " : " At 29 , the still @-@ in @-@ her @-@ prime Beyoncé seems a little young to be worrying about her legacy , as she does on the Warren power ballad I Was Here . But she puts so much feeling into it that it winds up being the album 's most moving song . " Joanne Dorken of MTV UK was also positive , praising the song 's " simple backing music , and Beyoncé 's flawless and beautiful voice . " She concluded that " I Was Here " ends up being a " standout song on the album [ and ] we won 't be forgetting Queen B in a hurry . " Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic was also positive , writing , " Payoff comes on 11th song , the epically loping ' I Was Here . ' Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun commented that " I Was Here " comes to " a show @-@ stopping moment in a Beyonce concert near you " . James Reed of The Boston Globe wrote that the collaboration of Diane Warren and Ryan Tedder , introduces " a new strain of her balladry : an ethereal marriage of R & B sensuality and stuttering indie @-@ rock guitars . " <unk> Tao of the website Sputnikmusic showed his appreciation for the song , writing , " [ ... ] perhaps even more notable is the record 's penultimate track , the Ryan Tedder @-@ produced ' I Was Here ' . Tedder is arguably one of the most irritating people working in pop today , and considering his track record , it 's not a surprise that ' I Was Here ' is the most contemporary @-@ sounding song off of 4 . What is surprising is just how good it is . The production is predictably icky , making that increasingly common mistake of using distant footsteps and reverbed guitar to convey a clichéd sense of ' epicness ' . " Gary Graff of Billboard said that the line " I want to leave my footprints on the sands of time " in the song defined the whole album . Simon Goddard of Q magazine chose " I Was Here " as one of the best songs on 4 , describing it as a " breast @-@ clutching tour de <unk> " . 
 Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice complimented " I Was Here " as knocking harder than anything on 4 's " bloated predecessor " , I Am ... Sasha Fierce ( 2008 ) . Similarly , Embling of Tiny Mix Tapes wrote : " ' I Was Here ' is a heavy brick of a song — overwrought , maudlin , <unk> grandiose — but it is also disarmingly honest about the addictive , undignified dimensions of fame and celebrity . " Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club described " I Was Here " as " uncomfortably overwrought " although he said that Beyoncé manages to bring conviction to its lyrical content . Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly also gave the song a mixed review stating that it reached a " lifetime @-@ movie levels of schmaltz " . David Amidon of PopMatters stated that " I Was Here " is " plain awkward to here a woman as in her prime physically as Beyoncé is to even approach such a tune . The dull music from Ryan Tedder and an army of co @-@ producers does not help matters . " Michael Cragg of The Observer gave the song a negative review , stating that it disappoints as being " corny bluster at odds with the laid @-@ back feel of her most accomplished album yet . " Andy Gill of The Independent simply stated that " I Was Here " strains too hard for " Empire State of Mind " ( 2009 ) status . Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune described the song as a " toxic string of cliches " . Hamish MacBain of NME gave " I Was Here " a mixed review stating the song sounds like an X @-@ Factor winner 's single , full of unbelievably trite sentiments .

 On July 25 , 2012 Beyoncé left a message for her fans on her official website stating " Leave Your Footprints on 19 August 2012 " , the opening lyrics to the song . On July 27 , 2012 it was revealed that Beyoncé would be releasing a music video for the song as part of a global launch of World Humanitarian Day , held by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) . It was helmed by production company Ridley Scott & Associates and directors Kenzo Digital and Sophie Muller . Droga5 and RSA Films served as producers of the video with the animation done by Dirt Empire NYC . The campaign aimed to reach 1 billion people with a single message when it launched , further making social media history . Several illustrations were launched on Beyoncé 's website explaining how people could leave their mark on the world . The campaign was powered and measured by a new platform called Thunderclap created by creative shop DE @-@ DE which aggregated the social reach of campaign supporters . Droga5 's creative chairman David Droga further explained the decision to include Beyoncé for the World Humanitarian Day , 
 " The hope , first and foremost , was to put this on people ’ s radar . Apart from the UN and a few newsreaders who mention this every year , people don ’ t even know this day exists . It ’ s also to make people realize it ’ s not just about volunteering to go and live in the Congo for four years . It ’ s as much about working a soup kitchen as it is helping an elderly person . Contributing something positive doesn ’ t have to be a lifelong commitment ; it can just be daily gestures . So , it was about giving the whole issue perspective ... One video and a message aren 't going to save everything . But when you say things together , maybe the message will be heard and hopefully will provoke action . <unk> people are good , and inherently people are distracted and somewhat lazy , so it comes down to how do you get people ’ s attention . " 
 Prior to the release of the video , Beyoncé said : " We all see the headlines and we think what can I really do to help ? ... World Humanitarian Day is an opportunity for all of us to work together to make a difference . This is our time to leave our mark on the world and show that we were here and we care . " During another interview posted on the UN website , Beyoncé said she was attracted to raising awareness on the day of recognition : " I found out that 22 people lost their lives helping people [ in Baghdad ] . I thought it was such an incredible thing to turn that into something positive and try to include the world into doing something great for someone else " . Another inspiration for Beyoncé to participate in the campaign were the finalists at the 2012 Do Something Awards and their humanitarian work . Beyoncé also enlisted the help of celebrities Gwyneth Paltrow , Rihanna , Lady Gaga , Justin Bieber , Chris Martin , Shakira , Jay @-@ Z and First Lady Michelle Obama to support the cause as well as Coca @-@ Cola , MTV , and Oreo . On August 3 , 2012 , Beyoncé released a black and white promotional video for the World Humanitarian Day . The video featured Beyoncé saying , " On August 19 . It ’ s high time we rise together . Do one thing for a human being . Nothing is too small . … Make your mark and say I was here . " The music video was expected to be released simultaneously in the main platforms of television , cinema , projection screens and facilities prepared for buildings in New York , Dubai and Geneva , on August 19 . However , it premiered on August 18 , 2012 instead . The next day , it was released on the iTunes Store in the US . The performance of the song received positive reviews from music critics and celebrities who attended .

SuperUber worked on integration between animations and technology , the structure design and projection mapping that took over the General Assembly Hall after it was invited by Kenzo Digital . 10 <unk> <unk> Barco projectors were placed and mapping was done using Pandora 's widget designer and 5 Pandora 's Dual Box servers . The final video had an <unk> x 1664 resolution and was split into 10 slices of 1080 x 1664 pixels , since each projector was turned on its side and the images were projected vertically in order to cover the whole structure . Two slices were fed into each system and SuperUber did the warping and edge blending inside Pandora . The screen which was used was over 12 @,@ 000 square feet ; Lucas <unk> , a representative for SuperUber commented that it was the largest indoor temporary screen that was a tilted compound curve adding that from an engineering standpoint , it is " extremely complex " . It was custom @-@ designed to mold to the inside of the General Assembly Hall . It spanned <unk> X 15m and surrounded the audience with a 240 degree immersive projection . Ten synchronized and mapped projections covered the screen with 200 @,@ 000 <unk> , creating one continuous giant image . The screen which weighed 1000 pounds was sewn by forty five people . The whole structure , which was hanging off the UN ceiling weighed 6000 pounds . <unk> revealed , " In order to create the proper tension for the screen to hold its shape we had to weld permanent rigging points into the dome of the general assembly . " Peter Kirn of Create Digital Motion wrote that the projection mapping was performed onto a fairly simple surface : " What makes the mapping so effective is the way in which it can fill the space , making those pictures immersive on a grand architectural scale . It makes the image a real volume in which the performance can take place . " Russ Rive , SuperUber ’ s director said , " It ’ s an ambitious project that has completely transformed an iconic location – seen as immutable and unchanging , with its <unk> panel and grand volume . By adding a virtual layer to it , we could digitally rebuild it , playing with the architectural elements , and therefore changing the notion of something static . The technology made the integration between animation and architecture . We used projectors to ' paint with light ' the UN General Assembly ’ s Hall – a unique opportunity to transform such an emblematic place . "

 HD 40307 is an orange ( K @-@ type ) main @-@ sequence star located approximately 42 light @-@ years away in the constellation of Pictor ( the Easel ) , taking its primary name from its Henry Draper Catalogue designation . It is calculated to be slightly less massive than the Sun . HD 40307 was observed during or before 1900 as part of the Cape Photographic Durchmusterung . The star has six known planets , three discovered in 2008 and three more in 2012 . One of them , HD 40307 g , is a potential super @-@ Earth in the habitable zone , with an orbital period of about 200 days . This object might be capable of supporting liquid water on its surface , although much more information must be acquired before its habitability can be assessed . 
 = = History and nomenclature = = 
 The designation HD 40307 is from the Henry Draper Catalogue , which is based on spectral classifications made between 1911 and 1915 by Annie Jump Cannon and her co @-@ workers , and was published between 1918 and 1924 . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 As a K @-@ type star , HD 40307 emits orange @-@ tinted light . It has only about three @-@ quarters of the Sun 's radius and mass . Its temperature is measured at slightly under 5000 K. This is relatively high for a K @-@ type star , approaching the temperatures normally found in G @-@ type stars such as the Sun . 
 The astronomers who discovered the planets orbiting HD 40307 suggested that the metallicities of stars determine whether or not the planetary bodies that orbit them will be terrestrial , like Earth , or gaseous , like Jupiter and Saturn . 
 = = = Distance and visibility = = = 
 Despite its relative proximity to the Sun at 42 light @-@ years , HD 40307 is not visible to the naked eye , given its apparent magnitude of 7 @.@ 17 . It came within 6 @.@ 4 light @-@ years of the Sun about 413 @,@ 000 years ago . 
 = = Planetary system = = 
 After spending five years observing the star , the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere ( ESO ) announced that they had discovered three super @-@ Earths in orbit around HD 40307 in June 2008 . All three planets were detected by the radial velocity method , using the HARPS spectrograph system . 
 In 2012 , an independent analysis carried out by a team of astronomers led by Mikko <unk> of the University of Hertfordshire confirmed the existence of these planets and found an additional three planets in the systems . 
 Five of the planets orbit very close to the star , with the farthest of them located twice as close to HD 40307 than is the planet Mercury is to the Sun . The outermost planet orbits at a distance similar to the distance of Venus to the Sun and is situated well in the system 's liquid water habitable zone . 
 The minimum masses of the planets in the system ranges from three to ten times the mass of the Earth , placing them somewhere between Earth and gas giants like Uranus and Neptune . Dynamical analysis of the innermost planets suggests that planet b is unstable at its age unless it is an ice giant , having migrated from further away . That implies similar for the other planets , even further out . The most recent discovery also indicates via dynamical analysis that the true planetary masses can not be much higher than their minimum masses .

It lives year @-@ round in the Arctic waters around Greenland , Canada , and Russia . It is one of two living species of whale in the Monodontidae family , along with the beluga whale . The narwhal males are distinguished by a long , straight , helical tusk , which is an elongated upper left canine . The narwhal was one of many species described by Carl Linnaeus in his publication Systema Naturae in 1758 . 
 Like the beluga , narwhals are medium @-@ sized whales . For both sexes , excluding the male 's tusk , the total body size can range from 3 @.@ 95 to 5 @.@ 5 m ( 13 @.@ 0 to 18 @.@ 0 ft ) ; the males are slightly larger than the females . The average weight of an adult narwhal is 800 to 1 @,@ 600 kg ( 1 @,@ 800 to 3 @,@ 500 lb ) . At around 11 to 13 years old , the males become sexually mature ; females become sexually mature at about 5 to 8 years old . Narwhals do not have a dorsal fin , and their neck vertebrae are jointed like those of other mammals , not fused as in dolphins and most whales . 
 Found primarily in Canadian Arctic and Greenlandic and Russian waters , the narwhal is a uniquely specialized Arctic predator . In winter , it feeds on benthic prey , mostly flatfish , under dense pack ice . During the summer , narwhals mostly eat Arctic cod and Greenland halibut , with other fish such as polar cod making up the remainder of their diet . Each year , they migrate from bays into the ocean as summer comes . In the winter , the male narwhals occasionally dive up to 1 @,@ 500 m ( 4 @,@ 900 ft ) in depth , with dives lasting up to 25 minutes . Narwhals , like most toothed whales , communicate with " clicks " , " whistles " , and " knocks " . 
 Narwhals can live up to 50 years . They are often killed by suffocation when the sea ice freezes over . Another cause of fatality , specifically among young whales , is starvation . The current population of the narwhal is about 75 @,@ 000 , so narwhals qualify for Near Threatened under the criterion of the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) . Narwhals have been harvested for over a thousand years by Inuit people in northern Canada and Greenland for meat and ivory , and a regulated subsistence hunt continues . 
 = = Taxonomy and etymology = = 
 The narwhal was one of the many species originally described by Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae . Its name is derived from the Old Norse word <unk> , meaning " corpse " , in reference to the animal 's greyish , mottled pigmentation , like that of a drowned sailor and its summer @-@ time habit of lying still at or near the surface of the sea ( called " logging " ) . The scientific name , Monodon monoceros , is derived from the Greek : " one @-@ tooth one @-@ horn " . 
 The narwhal is most closely related to the beluga whale . Together , these two species comprise the only extant members of the family Monodontidae , sometimes referred to as the " white whales " . The Monodontidae are distinguished by medium size ( at around 4 m ( 13 ft ) in length ) , forehead melons ( round sensory organs ) , short snouts , and the absence of a true dorsal fin . Although the narwhal and the beluga are classified as separate genera , with one species each , there is some evidence that they may , very rarely , interbreed . The complete skull of an anomalous whale was discovered in West Greenland circa 1990 . It was described by marine zoologists as unlike any known species , but with features midway between a narwhal and a beluga , consistent with the hypothesis that the anomalous whale was a narwhal @-@ beluga hybrid . 
 The white whales , dolphins ( Delphinidae ) and porpoises ( Phocoenidae ) together comprise the superfamily Delphinoidea , which are of likely monophyletic origin . Genetic evidence suggests the porpoises are more closely related to the white whales , and that these two families constitute a separate clade which diverged from the rest of Delphinoidea within the past 11 million years . Fossil evidence shows that ancient white whales lived in tropical waters . They may have migrated to Arctic and sub @-@ Arctic waters in response to changes in the marine food chain during the Pliocene . 
 = = Description = = 
 Narwhals are medium @-@ sized whales , and are around the same size as beluga whales . Total length in both sexes , excluding the tusk of the male , can range from 3 @.@ 95 to 5 @.@ 5 m ( 13 to 18 ft ) . Males , at an average length of 4 @.@ 1 m ( 13 ft 5 in ) , are slightly larger than females , with an average length of 3 @.@ 5 m ( 11 ft 6 in ) . Typical adult body weight ranges from 800 to 1 @,@ 600 kg ( 1 @,@ 800 to 3 @,@ 500 lb ) . Male narwhals attain sexual maturity at 11 to 13 years of age , when they are about 3 @.@ 9 m ( 12 ft 10 in ) long . Females become sexually mature at a younger age , between 5 and 8 years old , when they are around 3 @.@ 4 m ( 11 ft 2 in ) long . 
 The pigmentation of narwhals is a mottled pattern , with blackish @-@ brown markings over a white background . They are darkest when born and become whiter with age ; white patches develop on the navel and genital slit at sexual maturity . Old males may be almost pure white . Narwhals do not have a dorsal fin , possibly an evolutionary adaptation to swimming easily under ice . Their neck vertebrae are jointed , like those of land mammals , instead of being fused together as in most whales . Both these characteristics are shared by the beluga whale . The tail flukes of female narwhals have front edges that are swept back , and those of males have front edges that are more concave and lack a sweep @-@ back . This is thought to be an adaptation for reducing drag caused by the tusk . 
 = = = Tusk = = = 
 The most conspicuous characteristic of the male narwhal is a single long tusk , a canine tooth that projects from the left side of the upper jaw , through the lip , and forms a left @-@ handed helix spiral . Their tusks grow throughout life , reaching lengths from about 1 @.@ 5 to 3 @.@ 1 m ( 4 ft 11 in to 10 ft 2 in ) . It is hollow and weighs around 10 kg ( 22 lb ) . About one in 500 males has two tusks , which occurs when the right canine also grows out through the lip . Females sometimes grow tusks ; although only about 15 percent of females have a tusk and female tusks are smaller than those of males , with a less noticeable spiral . Females may produce a second tusk , but there is only a single recorded case of such happening ( left image ) . The tusks are surrounded posteriorly , ventrally , and laterally by several small teeth which vary in morphology and histology . These teeth are vestigial , and can sometimes be extruded from the bone . Their varied morphology and anatomy indicates a path of evolutionary obsolescence The narwhal 's mouth usually appears toothless . 
 The tusk is an innervated sensory organ with millions of patent nerve endings connecting seawater stimuli in the external ocean environment with the brain . The rubbing of tusks together which males engage in is now hypothesized to communicate information about the water each has traveled through rather than to represent the previously assumed “ male @-@ to @-@ male rivalry “ . Narwhals have only occasionally been observed using the tusk for aggressive behavior . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 The narwhal is found predominantly in the Atlantic and Russian areas of the Arctic Ocean . Individuals are commonly recorded in the northern part of Hudson Bay , Hudson Strait , Baffin Bay ; off the east coast of Greenland ; and in a strip running east from the northern end of Greenland round to eastern Russia ( 170 ° East ) . Land in this strip includes Svalbard , Franz Joseph Land , and Severnaya Zemlya . The northernmost sightings of narwhal have occurred north of Franz Joseph Land , at about 85 ° North latitude . Most of the world 's narwhals are concentrated in the fjords and inlets of Northern Canada and western Greenland . They are able to survive in depths of up to 1 @,@ 500 m ( 4 @,@ 900 ft ) below sea level . 
 = = = Migration = = = 
 Narwhals exhibit seasonal migrations , with a high fidelity of return to preferred , ice @-@ free summering grounds , usually in shallow waters . In summer months , they move closer to coasts , usually in pods of 10 – 100 . In the winter , they move to offshore , deeper waters under thick pack ice , surfacing in narrow fissures in the sea ice , or leads . As spring comes , these leads open up into channels and the narwhals return to the coastal bays . Narwhals from Canada and West Greenland winter regularly in the pack ice of Davis Strait and Baffin Bay along the continental slope with less than 5 % open water and high densities of Greenland halibut . Feeding in the winter accounts for a much larger portion of narwhal energy intake than in the summer . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 Narwhals normally congregate in groups of about five to ten , and sometimes up to 20 outside the summer . Groups may be " nurseries " with only females and young , or can contain only post @-@ dispersal juveniles or adult males ( " bulls " ) , but mixed groups can occur at any time of year . In the summer , several groups come together , forming larger aggregations which can contain from 500 to over 1000 individuals . 
 At times , a bull narwhal may rub its tusk with another bull , a display known as " <unk> " and thought to maintain social dominance hierarchies . However , this behaviour may exhibit tusk use as a sensory and communication organ for sharing information about water chemistry sensed in tusk <unk> . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 Narwhals have a relatively restricted and specialized diet . Their prey is predominantly composed of Greenland halibut , polar and Arctic cod , cuttlefish , shrimp and <unk> squid . Additional items found in stomachs have included <unk> , capelin , skate eggs and sometimes rocks , accidentally ingested when whales feed near the bottom . Due to the lack of well @-@ developed dentition in the mouth , narwhals are believed to feed by swimming towards prey until it is within close range and then sucking it with considerable force into the mouth . It is thought that the beaked whales , which have similarly reduced dentition , also suck up their prey . 
 Narwhals have a very intense summer feeding society . One study published in the Canadian Journal of Zoology tested 73 narwhals of different age and gender to see what they ate . The individuals were from the Pond Inlet and had their stomach contents tested from June 1978 until September 1979 . The study found in 1978 that the Arctic cod ( <unk> <unk> ) made up about 51 % of the diet of the narwhals , with the next most common animal being the Greenland halibut ( <unk> <unk> ) , consisting of 37 % of the weight of their diet . A year later , the percentages of both animals in the diet of narwhals had changed . Arctic cod represented 57 % , and Greenland halibut 29 % in 1979 . The deep @-@ water fish - halibut , redfish ( Sebastes marinus ) , and polar cod ( <unk> glacialis ) - are found in the diet of the males , which means that the narwhals can dive deeper than 500 m ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) below sea level . The study found that the dietary needs of the narwhal did not differ among genders or ages . 
 = = = Diving = = = 
 When in their wintering waters , narwhals make some of the deepest dives recorded for a marine mammal , diving to at least 800 metres ( 2 @,@ 600 feet ) over 15 times per day , with many dives reaching 1 @,@ 500 metres ( 4 @,@ 900 feet ) . Dives to these depths last around 25 minutes , including the time spent at the bottom and the transit down and back from the surface . 
 = = = Communication = = = 
 As with most toothed whales , narwhals use sound to navigate and hunt for food . " Clicks " , " whistles " and " knocks " , may be created via air between chambers near the blow @-@ hole , and reflected off the sloping front of the skull . These sounds are then focused by the animal 's melon , which can be controlled by musculature . " Click trains " are produced both for echo @-@ location of prey , and for locating obstacles at short distances . It is possible that individual " bangs " are capable of disorienting or incapacitating prey , making them easier to hunt , but this has not been verified . The whistles of a narwhal are rarely heard , especially compared to the beluga . Other sounds produced by narwhals include trumpeting and squeaking door sounds . 
 = = = Breeding and early life = = = 
 Females start bearing calves when six to eight years old . Adult narwhals mate in April or May when they are in the offshore pack ice . Gestation lasts for 14 months and calves are born between June and August the following year . As with most marine mammals , only a single young is born . Newborn calves average 1 @.@ 6 metres ( 5 @.@ 2 feet ) in length and are dark grey . The newborn calves begin their lives with a thin layer of blubber which thickens as they nurse their mother 's milk which is rich in fat . Calves are dependent on milk for around 20 months . This long lactation period gives calves time to learn the skills they need for survival . Mothers and calves stay close and when travelling , the calf stays by its mother 's back for assistance in swimming . 
 = = = Life span and mortality = = = 
 Narwhals can live up to at least 50 years . Almost all modern predation of narwhals is by humans ; other predators are polar bears , which attempt to swipe narwhals at breathing holes and mainly target young whales , and killer whales ( orcas ) which can group together to overwhelm narwhals . Greenland sharks and walruses may take a few small young or weak and wounded adults , though this is likely quite rare . When it comes to escaping predators such as orcas , narwhals typically use prolonged submergence to hide under the ice rather than relying on speed . 
 Mortality often occurs when the narwhals suffocate after they fail to leave before the surface of the Arctic waters freeze over in the late autumn . Open water is formed in ice @-@ covered water by fracturing events induced by strong winds , but when these conditions are absent ice can quickly form . The last major entrapment events occurred when there was little to no wind . Narwhals are mammals and need air to breathe , so when open water is no longer accessible and the ice is too thick for them to break through , they can drown . Maximum aerobic swimming distance between breathing holes in ice is less than 1 @,@ 450 m ( 4 @,@ 760 ft ) which limits the use of foraging grounds and these holes must be at least 0 @.@ 5 m ( 1 @.@ 6 ft ) wide to allow an adult whale to breathe . The events can trap groups as large as 600 individuals . Most entrapment events occur in narwhal wintering areas such as Disko Bay . In the largest entrapment in 1915 in West Greenland , over 1 @,@ 000 narwhals were trapped under the ice . 
 Despite the decreases in sea ice cover , there were several large cases of sea ice entrapment in 2008 – 2010 in the winter close to known summering grounds , two of which were locations where there had been no previous cases documented . This suggests later departure dates from summering grounds . Sites surrounding Greenland experience advection ( moving ) of sea ice from surrounding regions by wind and currents , increasing the variability of sea ice concentration . Due to strong site fidelity , changes in weather and ice conditions are not always associated with narwhal movement toward open water and therefore more data is needed to determine how vulnerable narwhals are to future sea ice changes . Narwhals can also die of starvation , especially the young . 
 = = Conservation issues = = 
 Narwhals are one of many mammals that are being threatened by human actions . The world population of narwhals is currently estimated to be around 75 @,@ 000 . They are considered to be near threatened and several sub @-@ populations have evidence of decline . In an effort to support conservation , the European Union established an import ban on tusks . Many other countries have quotas on catches , which will be important also in newly opening areas caused by decreasing sea ice cover . Narwhals are difficult to keep in captivity . 
 Inuit people , who call a tusked narwhal <unk> <unk> , are allowed to hunt this whale species legally for subsistence . Narwhals have been extensively hunted the same way as other sea mammals , such as seals and whales , for its large quantities of fat which are one of the most important resources of the native people in Arctic regions . Almost all parts of the narwhal , meat , skin , blubber and organs are consumed . <unk> , the name for raw skin and blubber , is considered a delicacy , and the bones are used for tools and art . The skin is an important source of vitamin C which is otherwise difficult to obtain . In some places in Greenland , such as Qaanaaq , traditional hunting methods are used , and whales are harpooned from handmade kayaks . In other parts of Greenland and Northern Canada , high @-@ speed boats and hunting rifles are used . 
 During growth , the narwhal accumulates metals in its internal organs . One study found that many metals are low in concentration in the blubber of narwhals , and high in the liver and the kidney . Zinc and cadmium are found in higher densities in the kidney than the liver , and lead , copper and mercury were found to be the opposite . Certain metals were correlated with size and sex . During growth , it was found that mercury accumulated in the liver , kidney , muscle and blubber , and that cadmium settled in the blubber . 
 Narwhals are one of the most vulnerable Arctic marine mammals to climate change due to altering sea ice coverage in their environment , especially in their northern wintering grounds such as the Baffin Bay and Davis Strait regions . Satellite data collected from these areas shows the amount of sea ice has been markedly reduced . Narwhals ' ranges for foraging are believed to be patterns developed early in their life which increase their ability to gain necessary food resources during winter . This strategy focuses on strong site fidelity rather than individual level responses to local prey distribution and this results in focal foraging areas during the winter . As such , despite changing conditions narwhals will continue returning to the same areas during migration . Despite its vulnerability to sea ice change , the narwhal has some flexibility when it comes to sea ice and habitat selection . It evolved in the late Pliocene , and so is moderately accustomed to periods of glaciation and environmental variability . 
 An indirect danger for narwhals associated with changes in sea ice is the increased exposure in open water . In 2002 there was an increase in narwhal catches by hunters in <unk> that did not appear to be associated with increased effort , implying that climate change may be making the narwhal more vulnerable to harvesting . Scientists urge assessment of population numbers with the assignment of sustainable quotas for stocks and the collaboration of management agreements to ensure local acceptance . Seismic surveys associated with oil exploration have also disrupted normal migration patterns which may also be associated with increased sea ice entrapment .

 = = = In legend = = = 
 In Inuit legend , the narwhal 's tusk was created when a woman with a harpoon rope tied around her waist was dragged into the ocean after the harpoon had struck a large narwhal . She was transformed into a narwhal , and her hair , which she was wearing in a twisted knot , became the characteristic spiral narwhal tusk . 
 Some medieval Europeans believed narwhal tusks to be the horns from the legendary unicorn . As these horns were considered to have magic powers , such as neutralising poison and curing melancholia , Vikings and other northern traders were able to sell them for many times their weight in gold . The tusks were used to make cups that were thought to negate any poison that may have been slipped into the drink . In 1555 , Olaus Magnus published a drawing of a fish @-@ like creature with a horn on its forehead , correctly identifying it as a " <unk> " . During the 16th century , Queen Elizabeth I received a carved and bejewelled narwhal tusk worth 10 @,@ 000 British Pounds — the cost of a castle ( approximately £ 1 @.@ 5 – 2 @.@ 5 million in 2007 , using the retail price index ) from Sir Humphrey Gilbert , who proposed the tusk was from a " sea @-@ <unk> " . The tusks were staples of the cabinet of curiosities . European knowledge of the tusk 's origin developed gradually during the Age of Exploration , as explorers and naturalists began to visit Arctic regions themselves .

 The narwhal was one of two possible explanations of the giant sea phenomenon written by Jules Verne in his 1870 novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea . Verne thought that it would be unlikely that there was such a gigantic narwhal in existence . The size of the narwhal , or " unicorn of the sea " , as found by Verne , would have been 18 m ( 60 ft ) . For the narwhal to have caused the phenomenon , Verne stated that its size and strength would have to increase by five or ten times . 
 Herman Melville wrote a section on the narwhal ( written as " narwhale " ) in his 1851 novel Moby @-@ Dick , in which he claims a narwhal tusk hung for " a long period " in Windsor Castle after Sir Martin Frobisher had given it to Queen Elizabeth . Another claim he made was that the Danish kings made their thrones from narwhal tusks . 
 The narwhal is largely mentioned in the book Lore of the Unicorn . In the book , the author Odell Shepard describes the earlier interpretations of the narwhal , from being a fish with a horn in its forehead , to a sea @-@ unicorn . Shepard tells that from the Danish and Dutch , the world was told of the importance of both narwhals and their tusks , and how they had lived for at least 200 years until being discovered by the explorers . Later , after the narwhal had been identified , two tusks were presented to the King of Denmark . One of these tusks was apparently 10 ft ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) long , and was then transported to a region then known as Nova <unk> .

 = Hurricane Irene ( 1999 ) = 
 Hurricane Irene was a hurricane that produced somewhat heavy damage across southern Florida during the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season . The ninth tropical storm and the sixth hurricane of the season , Irene developed in the western Caribbean Sea on October 13 from a tropical wave . It moved northward , hitting western Cuba before attaining hurricane status . Irene struck Florida as a Category 1 hurricane , moved across the state , and moved northward over the Gulf Stream . It approached the Carolinas but remained offshore . Irene turned eastward , and rapidly intensified to reach Category 2 hurricane status before becoming extratropical due to cooler waters . The hurricane first produced heavy rainfall across western Cuba , causing four deaths and damage . Irene was a wet Florida hurricane in October , similar to many hurricanes of the 1930s and 1940s . It later dropped 10 to 20 inches ( 255 to 510 mm ) of rainfall in the Miami metropolitan area , causing urban flooding unseen since Hurricane Dennis in 1981 . Despite being only a Category 1 hurricane , Irene caused eight indirect deaths and $ 800 million ( 1999 USD ) in damage across Florida . 
 The hurricane produced flooding and caused one death in the northwestern Bahamas . In North Carolina and Virginia , Irene produced heavy rainfall of over 10 inches ( 255 mm ) , adding more flooding after previous Hurricanes Dennis and Floyd . The flooding closed many roads , and caused rivers to crest past their banks , though damage in the area was relatively minor . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A broad area of low pressure formed over the western Caribbean Sea on October 8 , and it persisted until October 11 , when a tropical wave reached the area and caused the convection to organize , resulting in the development of a low @-@ level circulation . Convection increased and organized around the circulation 's center late on October 12 , and the system organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen on October 13 off the north coast of Honduras . The depression continued to organize over the favorable conditions present in the Caribbean Sea , and attained tropical storm status later on October 13 , when it was assigned the name Irene . Operationally , the system remained a tropical wave until it already reached tropical storm strength . 
 Tropical Storm Irene strengthened as it moved northward , and reached maximum sustained winds of 70 mph ( 115 km / h ) early on October 14 . Operationally , Irene was upgraded to a hurricane on October 14 , although later analysis after the hurricane season indicated it remained a tropical storm until later . Irene continued to move towards the north @-@ northeast , crossed over the western portion of the Isla de la Juventud as a strong tropical storm , and hours later , it struck mainland Cuba near <unk> . The storm was able to strengthen further over the Florida Straits , and Irene attained hurricane status on October 15 . It passed over Key West , turned more to the north @-@ northeast , and struck mainland Florida at Cape Sable as an 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) hurricane . 
 Irene entered the Atlantic Ocean near Jupiter , Florida early on October 16 , still as a Category 1 hurricane . It turned to the north , remained a hurricane despite little convection , then turned to the northeast in response to an approaching upper @-@ level trough . Just offshore , Irene moved parallel to the coastlines of South Carolina and North Carolina on October 17 . On October 18 , as it interacted with very warm ocean waters and the upper level trough , Irene rapidly intensified , reaching peak winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) with a pressure of 952 mbar , a Category 2 hurricane . Despite its strength , the circulation was very asymmetrical , and the convection was not particularly organized . The hurricane continued to accelerate to the northeast , steadily weakening until becoming extratropical on October 19 to the south of Newfoundland . The extratropical storm continued to the northeast until becoming absorbed by another , larger extratropical storm late that same day . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 In Cuba , slightly over 228 @,@ 000 residents were evacuated from low @-@ lying areas before the storm . Around 10 % stayed in temporary shelters , while the rest stayed with family or friends . Included in the evacuation total were 6 @,@ 000 tourists and over 1 @,@ 000 residents in rickety houses . Workers protected tobacco leaves by moving them to sealed warehouses , and transported cattle and livestock to higher ground . The hurricane forced the closure of schools and the cancellation of some flights . The Cuban government issued a Hurricane Watch for Pinar del Río Province , Havana , Havana Province , and Isla de la Juventud 21 hours before Irene hit . These areas , along with Matanzas Province , were upgraded to a Hurricane Warning 15 hours before Irene hit the area . 
 Initially , forecasters predicted Irene to parallel the west coast of Florida , weakening to a tropical storm before making landfall on the west @-@ central portion of the state . However , when a more eastward track became evident , officials in Monroe , Charlotte , Lee , and Manatee Counties issued evacuation orders for people in mobile homes and recreational vehicles . In addition , Key West issued a curfew during the storm 's onslaught . The National Hurricane Center issued a Hurricane Warning from Florida City around the Florida Peninsula to Boca Grande , including all of the Florida Keys and the Dry Tortugas . A Tropical Storm Warning was also issued from Florida City northward to Savannah , Georgia . In addition , the majority of flights during Irene 's passage were cancelled in Miami International Airport . Governor Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency on Florida the day before Irene made landfall , and ordered for the activation of the Florida National Guard to aid in disaster efforts . 
 While moving northward off the coast of Florida , Irene was initially expected to make landfall along the South Carolina coastline , prompting the National Hurricane Center to issue a Hurricane Warning from Edisto Beach , South Carolina to Cape Hatteras , North Carolina . Because of this , voluntary evacuation orders were issued for portions of South Carolina . However , when the track shifted further to the east , mandatory evacuation orders were issued for coastal areas of North Carolina , with tens of thousands removed from their homes . The evacuation order included several beach towns ; those living in low @-@ lying areas and mobile homes were advised to seek shelter . In addition , many of those left homeless from Hurricane Floyd 's passage just weeks before were evacuated to shelters . Jim Hunt , the Governor of North Carolina , declared a state of emergency , with the state 's emergency management team switching from a recovery objective towards a preparations mission .

The city of Havana reported 4 @.@ 8 inches ( 122 mm ) , while many other locations reported more than 7 inches ( 178 mm ) . In addition , the city of Havana recorded a peak wind gust of 78 mph ( 126 km / h ) . 
 The flooding caused by Irene damaged more than 471 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 900 km ² ) of sugar cane and 39 @,@ 000 acres ( 158 km ² ) of banana plantations .

 While moving through the Florida Keys , Irene produced a storm surge of up to 2 @.@ 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 7 m ) in Key Vaca , while Key West reported a surge of 1 @.@ 5 feet ( 0 @.@ 5 m ) . The hurricane produced sustained winds peaking at 79 mph ( 127 km / h ) ; it also produced strong gusts , the strongest of which was clocked at 102 mph ( 164 km / h ) at Big Pine Key . Irene produced heavy rainfall in the Keys , including 12 inches ( 305 mm ) of rain in Key West . The rainfall flooded roads throughout the Keys , prompting officials to close 50 miles ( 80 km ) of U.S. Highway 1 . Irene spawned a tornado in Islamorada , causing heavy damage to three houses . Moderate wind gusts caused power outages throughout the Keys , but damage was overall minor . 
 Despite moving across the state as a minimal hurricane , there were no reports of hurricane @-@ force winds on mainland Florida . The highest official recorded wind report was 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) in Miami Beach , while the highest accurate wind gust was 71 mph ( 114 km / h ) in Vero Beach . In addition to the National Weather Service Reports , the South Florida Water Management District reported higher wind gusts near Lake Okeechobee of up to 93 mph ( 150 km / h ) in Belle Glade , though these were likely caused by small @-@ scale meso @-@ cyclone @-@ induced downbursts . Irene produced heavy rainfall across southeastern Florida , peaking at 17 @.@ 45 inches ( 443 mm ) at Boynton Beach , though many areas in the Miami Metropolitan Area received from 10 to 15 inches ( 255 to 380 mm ) . One F1 and three F0 tornadoes touched down in Broward and Palm Beach Counties , injuring three people . 
 Strong wind gusts left 700 @,@ 000 people without power from Miami to West Palm Beach , including the National Hurricane Center . The center briefly lost power , but during an hour and a half delay to reboot the computers , they obtained information from computers in the Mid @-@ West and Washington , D.C. Officials from the Florida Power & Light Company were unable to repair power lines due to strong wind gusts , while Irene 's flooding submerged underground lines , preventing repairs until the waters subsided . Five people , including three in one family , were killed when they walked through electrified waters due to downed power lines . The rains from Irene flooded roads and canals , stalling numerous cars . Three people drowned when they drove their vehicles into the canals . The floodwaters persisted for nearly a week in areas , displacing hundreds from their homes and isolating thousands . Property damage in southeastern Florida totalled to $ 262 million . 
 Irene also caused severe agricultural damage in southeastern Florida totalling to $ 338 million Floodwaters killed 30 cattle at one farm , though the owners protected the rest of their 1700 cattle by raising the feeding areas above the flood plain . According to an initial estimate , the flooding destroyed between 5 % and 15 % of fruit groves along its path . The flooding delayed the winter planting of corn and bell peppers and damaged tomato plants , forcing Miami @-@ Dade County growers to replant damaged crops . The hurricane also damaged sugar cane , vegetables , and citrus crops , with citrus canker spreading after the storm passed through the area . Due to the crop damage , the U.S. Department of Agriculture declared Broward , Collier , Miami @-@ Dade , and Monroe Counties as disaster areas . This qualified eligible farmers for low @-@ interest emergency loans . 
 After moderate beach erosion from previous hurricanes Dennis and Floyd , Irene caused significant beach erosion on the eastern Florida coastline . The erosion exposed the foundations of private homes , leaving some uninhabitable . Beach erosion damage totalled to $ 21 million . Many beach access points were closed until more sand could be pumped in , or until the stairways were rebuilt . Strong north winds and high seas severely destroyed or damaged docks in the Indian River Lagoon . Heavy rainfall , ranging from 5 to 9 inches ( 127 to 229 mm ) in Martin and St. Lucie Counties flooded 260 homes .

 Hurricane Irene dropped moderate rainfall ranging from 5 to 6 inches ( 125 to 150 mm ) in eastern South Carolina . The flooding closed several roads , including some in western Georgetown County which were washed out . Moderate wind gusts of up to 48 mph ( 77 km / h ) in Charleston downed trees and power lines , causing sporadic power outages . The winds also caused minor beach erosion along the coastline . 
 While paralleling the coast of North Carolina , Irene produced heavy rainfall across the state , peaking at 11 inches ( 280 mm ) in <unk> with several other locations reporting over 6 inches ( 152 mm ) . The rainfall caused severe river flooding in North Carolina , many of which had not receded from Hurricane Floyd 's passage less than a month earlier . Due to the runoff , the Tar , Cape Fear , and Neuse Rivers all crested above their banks . The flooding also caused a dam in south @-@ central Hoke County to overflow . Irene spawned two tornadoes ; an F0 in Onslow County and an F2 in <unk> . The F2 destroyed 2 trailers , damaged several houses , and injured one person . The heavy flooding closed several roads throughout North Carolina , causing several traffic accidents . Hurricane Irene was indirectly responsible for one death when a man hydroplaned on a wet road and crashed . Despite the severe flooding , Hurricane Irene caused little damage in North Carolina . 
 Hurricane Irene also produced heavy rainfall in southeastern Virginia of up to 12 inches ( 305 mm ) in Chesapeake . The rainfall resulted in widespread street flooding , with some locations reporting flooding of up to 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) deep .

In addition , the president issued an emergency declaration for Florida , which released federal resources to aid in debris removal and emergency services . In addition , President Clinton declared the 66 counties in North Carolina eligible for assistance due to Hurricane Floyd were also eligible for more assistance due to damage from Irene . 
 In the Bahamas , township volunteers assisted in cleanup efforts . The Royal Bahamas Defence Force distributed hurricane relief supplies to those affected . 
 = Edward the Martyr = 
 Edward the Martyr ( Old English : Eadweard ; c . 962 – 18 March 978 ) was King of England from 975 until he was murdered in 978 . Edward was the eldest son of King Edgar the Peaceful but was not his father 's acknowledged heir . On Edgar 's death , the leadership of England was contested , with some supporting Edward 's claim to be king and others supporting his much younger half @-@ brother Æthelred the Unready , recognized as a legitimate son of Edgar . Edward was chosen as king and was crowned by his main clerical supporters , the archbishops Dunstan and Oswald of Worcester . 
 The great nobles of the kingdom , ealdormen Ælfhere and Æthelwine , quarrelled , and civil war almost broke out . In the so @-@ called anti @-@ monastic reaction , the nobles took advantage of Edward 's weakness to dispossess the Benedictine reformed monasteries of lands and other properties that King Edgar had granted to them . 
 Edward 's short reign was brought to an end by his murder at Corfe Castle in 978 in circumstances that are not altogether clear . His body was reburied with great ceremony at Shaftesbury Abbey early in 979 . In 1001 Edward 's remains were moved to a more prominent place in the abbey , probably with the blessing of his half @-@ brother King Æthelred . Edward was already reckoned a saint by this time . 
 A number of lives of Edward were written in the centuries following his death in which he was portrayed as a martyr , generally seen as a victim of the Queen Dowager Ælfthryth , mother of Æthelred . He is today recognized as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church , the Roman Catholic Church , and the Anglican Communion . 
 = = Ætheling ( princes of succession ) = = 
 Edward 's date of birth is unknown , but he was the eldest of Edgar 's three children . He was likely in his teens when he succeeded his father , who died at age 32 in 975 . Edward was known to be King Edgar 's son , but he was not the son of Queen Ælfthryth , the third wife of Edgar . This much and no more is known from contemporary charters . 
 Later sources of questionable reliability address the identity of Edward 's mother . The earliest such source is a life of Dunstan by Osbern of Canterbury , probably written in the 1080s . Osbern writes that Edward 's mother was a nun at Wilton Abbey whom the king seduced . When Eadmer wrote a life of Dunstan some decades later , he included an account of Edward 's parentage obtained from Nicholas of Worcester . This denied that Edward was the son of a liaison between Edgar and a nun , presenting him as the son of Æthelflæd , daughter of <unk> , " ealdorman of the East Anglians " , whom Edgar had married in the years when he ruled Mercia ( between 957 and Eadwig 's death in 959 ) . Additional accounts are offered by Goscelin in his life of Edgar 's daughter Saint Edith of Wilton and in the histories of John of Worcester and William of Malmesbury . Together these various accounts suggest that Edward 's mother was probably a noblewoman named Æthelflæd , surnamed Candida or <unk> — " the White " or " White Duck " . 
 A charter of 966 describes Ælfthryth , whom Edgar had married in 964 , as the king 's " lawful wife " , and their eldest son Edmund as the legitimate son of the king . Edward is noted as the king 's son . Bishop Æthelwold of Winchester was a supporter of Ælfthryth and Æthelred , but Dunstan , the Archbishop of Canterbury appears to have supported Edward , and a genealogy created at his Glastonbury Abbey circa 969 gives Edward precedence over Edmund and Æthelred . Ælfthryth was the widow of Æthelwald , Ealdorman of East Anglia and perhaps Edgar 's third wife . Cyril Hart argues that the contradictions regarding the identity of Edward 's mother , and the fact that Edmund appears to have been regarded as the legitimate heir until his death in 971 , suggest that Edward was probably illegitimate . However , Barbara Yorke thinks that Æthelflæd was Edgar 's wife , but Ælfthryth was a consecrated queen when she gave birth to her sons , who were therefore considered more " legitimate " than Edward . Æthelwold denied that Edward was legitimate , but Yorke considers this " opportunist special pleading " . 
 Edmund 's full brother Æthelred may have inherited his position as heir . On a charter to the New Minster at Winchester , the names of Ælfthryth and her son Æthelred appear ahead of Edward 's name . When Edgar died on 8 July 975 , Æthelred was probably nine and Edward only a few years older . 
 = = Disputed succession = = 
 Edgar had been a strong ruler who had forced monastic reforms on a probably unwilling church and nobility , aided by the leading clerics of the day , Dunstan , Archbishop of Canterbury ; Oswald of Worcester , Archbishop of York ; and Bishop Æthelwold of Winchester . By endowing the reformed Benedictine monasteries with the lands required for their support , he had dispossessed many lesser nobles , and had rewritten leases and loans of land to the benefit of the monasteries . Secular clergy , many of whom would have been members of the nobility , had been expelled from the new monasteries . While Edgar lived , he strongly supported the reformers , but following his death , the discontents which these changes had provoked came into the open . 
 The leading figures had all been supporters of the reform , but they were no longer united . Relations between Archbishop Dunstan and Bishop Æthelwold may have been strained . Archbishop Oswald was at odds with Ealdorman Ælfhere , Ealdorman of Mercia , while Ælfhere and his kin were rivals for power with the affinity of Æthelwine , Ealdorman of East Anglia . Dunstan was said to have questioned Edgar 's marriage to Queen Dowager Ælfthryth and the legitimacy of their son Æthelred . 
 These leaders were divided as to whether Edward or Æthelred should succeed Edgar . Neither law nor precedent offered much guidance . The choice between the sons of Edward the Elder had divided his kingdom , and Edgar 's elder brother Eadwig had been forced to give over a large part of the kingdom to Edgar . The Queen Dowager certainly supported the claims of her son Æthelred , aided by Bishop Æthelwold ; and Dunstan supported Edward , aided by his fellow archbishop Oswald . It is likely that Ealdorman Ælfhere and his allies supported Æthelred and that Æthelwine and his allies supported Edward , although some historians suggest the opposite . 
 Later sources suggest that perceptions of legitimacy played a part in the arguments , as did the relative age of the two candidates . In time , Edward was anointed by Archbishops Dunstan and Oswald at Kingston upon Thames , most likely in 975 . There is evidence that the settlement involved a degree of compromise . Æthelred appears to have been given lands which normally belonged to the king 's sons , some of which had been granted by Edgar to Abingdon Abbey and which were forcibly repossessed for Æthelred by the leading nobles . 
 = = Edward 's reign = = 
 After recording Edward 's succession , the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle reports that a comet appeared , and that famine and " manifold disturbances " followed . The " manifold disturbances " , sometimes called the anti @-@ monastic reaction , appear to have started soon after Edgar 's death . During this time , the experienced Ealdorman Oslac of Northumbria , effective ruler of much of northern England , was exiled due to unknown circumstances . Oslac was followed as ealdorman by Thored , either Oslac 's son of that name or Thored Gunnar 's son mentioned by the Chronicle in 966 . 
 Edward , or rather those who were wielding power on his behalf , also appointed a number of new ealdormen to positions in Wessex . Little is known of two of these men , and it is difficult to determine which faction , if any , they belonged to . Edwin , probably ruling in Sussex , and perhaps also parts of Kent and Surrey , was buried at Abingdon , an abbey patronised by Ælfhere . Æthelmær , who oversaw Hampshire , held lands in Rutland , perhaps suggesting links to Æthelwine . 
 The third ealdorman , Æthelweard , today best known for his Latin history , ruled in the west . Æthelweard was a descendant of King Æthelred of Wessex and probably the brother of King Eadwig 's wife . He appears to have been a supporter of Edward rather than of either faction . 
 In some places , the secular clergy who had been driven from the monasteries returned , driving the regular clergy out in their turn . Bishop Æthelwold had been the main enemy of the seculars , and Archbishop Dunstan appears to have done little to aid his fellow reformer at this time . More generally , the magnates took the opportunity to undo many of Edgar 's grants to monasteries and to force the abbots to rewrite leases and loans to favour the local nobility . Ealdorman Ælfhere was the leader in this regard , attacking Oswald 's network of monasteries across Mercia . Ælfhere 's rival Æthelwine , while a staunch protector of his family monastery of Ramsey Abbey , treated Ely Abbey and other monasteries harshly . At some point during these disorders , Ælfhere and Æthelwine appear to have come close to open warfare . This may well have been related to Ælfhere 's ambitions in East Anglia and to attacks upon Ramsey Abbey . Æthelwine , supported by his kinsman Ealdorman Byrhtnoth of Essex and others unspecified , mustered an army and caused Ælfhere to back down . 
 Very few charters survive from Edward 's reign , perhaps as few as three , leaving Edward 's brief reign in obscurity . By contrast , numerous charters survived from the reigns of his father Edgar and half @-@ brother Æthelred . All of the surviving Edward charters concern the royal heartland of Wessex ; two deal with Crediton where Edward 's former tutor Sideman was bishop . During Edgar 's reign , dies for coins were cut only at Winchester and distributed from there to other mints across the kingdom . Edward 's reign permitted dies to be cut locally at York and at Lincoln . The general impression is of a reduction or breakdown of royal authority in the midlands and north . The machinery of government continued to function , as councils and synods met as customary during Edward 's reign , at <unk> in Oxfordshire after Easter 977 , and again at Calne in Wiltshire the following year . During the meeting at Calne , some councillors were killed and others injured by the collapse of the floor of their room . 
 = = Death = = 
 The version of the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle containing the most detailed account records that Edward was murdered in the evening of 18 March 978 , while visiting Ælfthryth and Æthelred , probably at or near the mound on which the ruins of Corfe Castle now stand . It adds that he was buried at Wareham " without any royal honours " . The compiler of this version of the Chronicle , manuscript E , called the Peterborough Chronicle , says : 
 " No worse deed for the English race was done than this was , since they first sought out the land of Britain . Men murdered him , but God exalted him . In life he was an earthly king ; after death he is now a heavenly saint . His earthly relatives would not avenge him , but his Heavenly Father has much avenged him . " 
 Other recensions of the Chronicle report less detail , the oldest text stating only that he was killed , while versions from the 1040s say that he was martyred . 
 Of other early sources , the life of Oswald of Worcester , attributed to Byrhtferth of Ramsey , adds that Edward was killed by Æthelred 's advisers , who attacked him when he was dismounting . It agrees that he was buried without ceremony at Wareham . Archbishop Wulfstan II alludes to the killing of Edward in his Sermo Lupi ad Anglos , written not later than 1016 . A recent study translates his words as follows : 
 " And a very great betrayal of a lord it is also in the world , that a man betray his lord to death , or drive him living from the land , and both have come to pass in this land : Edward was betrayed , and then killed , and after that burned ... " 
 Later sources , further removed from events , such as the late 11th @-@ century Passio S. <unk> and John of Worcester , claim that Ælfthryth organised the killing of Edward , while Henry of Huntingdon wrote that she killed Edward herself . 
 Modern historians have offered a variety of interpretations of Edward 's killing . Three main theories have been proposed . Firstly , that Edward was killed , as the life of Oswald claims , by nobles in Æthelred 's service , either as a result of a personal quarrel , or to place their master on the throne . The life of Oswald portrays Edward as an unstable young man who , according to Frank Stenton : " had offended many important persons by his intolerable violence of speech and behavior . Long after he had passed into veneration as a saint it was remembered that his outbursts of rage had alarmed all who knew him , and especially the members of his own household . " This may be a trope of hagiography . 
 In the second version , Ælfthryth was implicated , either beforehand by plotting the killing , or afterwards in allowing the killers to go free and unpunished . 
 A third alternative , noting that Edward in 978 was very close to ruling on his own , proposes that Ealdorman Ælfhere was behind the killing so as to preserve his own influence and to prevent Edward taking revenge for Ælfhere 's actions earlier in the reign . John notes this and interprets Ælfhere 's part in Edward 's reburial as being a penance for the assassination . 
 = = Reburial and early cult = = 
 Edward 's body lay at Wareham for a year before being disinterred . Ælfhere initiated the reinterment , perhaps as a gesture of reconciliation . According to the life of Oswald , Edward 's body was found to be <unk> when it was disinterred ( which was taken as a miraculous sign ) . The body was taken to the Shaftesbury Abbey , a nunnery with royal connections which had been endowed by King Alfred the Great and where Edward and Æthelred 's grandmother Ælfgifu had spent her latter years . 
 Edward 's remains were reburied with lavish public ceremony . Later versions , such as the Passio S. <unk> , have more complicated accounts . It said that Edward 's body was concealed in a marsh , where it was revealed by miraculous events . The Passio dates the reburial to 18 February . 
 In 1001 , Edward 's relics ( for he was considered a saint , although never canonized ) were translated to a more prominent place within the nunnery at Shaftesbury . The ceremonies are said to have been led by the then @-@ Bishop of Sherborne , Wulfsige III , accompanied by a senior cleric whom the Passio calls <unk> , sometimes identified with Ælfsige , the abbot of the New Minster , Winchester . King Æthelred , preoccupied with the threat of a Danish invasion , did not attend in person , but he issued a charter to the Shaftesbury nuns late in 1001 granting them lands at Bradford on Avon , which is thought to be related . A 13th @-@ century calendar of saints gives the date of this translation as 20 June . 
 The rise of Edward 's cult has been interpreted in various ways . It is sometimes portrayed as a popular movement , or as the product of a political attack on King Æthelred by former supporters of Edward . Alternatively , Æthelred has been seen as one of the key forces in the promotion of Edward 's cult and that of their sister Eadgifu ( Edith of Wilton ) . He was thought to make the charter in 1001 granting land to Shaftesbury at the elevation of Edward 's relics , and some accounts suggest that Æthelred legislated the observation of Edward 's feast days across England in a law code of 1008 . It is unclear whether this innovation , seemingly drafted by Archbishop Wulfstan II , dates from Æthelred 's reign . It may instead have been promulgated by King Cnut . David Rollason has drawn attention to the increased importance of the cults of other murdered royal saints in this period . Among these are the cults of King Ecgberht of Kent 's nephews , whose lives form part of the Mildrith Legend , and those of the Mercian Saints Kenelm and Wigstan . 
 = = Later cult = = 
 During the sixteenth century and English Reformation , King Henry VIII led the dissolution of the monasteries and many holy places were demolished . Edward 's remains were hidden so as to avoid desecration . 
 In 1931 , the relics were recovered by Wilson @-@ Claridge during an archaeological excavation ; their identity was confirmed by Dr. T. E. A. Stowell , an <unk> . In 1970 , examinations performed on the relics suggested that the young man had died in the same manner as Edward . Wilson @-@ Claridge wanted the relics to go to the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia . His brother , however , wanted them to be returned to Shaftesbury Abbey . For decades , the relics were kept in a bank vault in Woking , Surrey because of the unresolved dispute about which of two churches should have them . 
 In time , the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia was victorious and placed the relics in a church in Brookwood Cemetery in Woking , with the enshrinement ceremony occurring in September 1984 . The St Edward Brotherhood of monks was organized there as well . The church is now named St Edward the Martyr Orthodox Church , and it is under the jurisdiction of a traditionalist Greek Orthodox community . 
 In the Orthodox Church , St Edward is ranked as a Passion @-@ bearer , a type of saint who accepts death out of love for Christ . Edward was never officially canonized , but he is also regarded as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church , the Roman Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion . His feast day is celebrated on 18 March , the day of his murder . The Orthodox Church commemorates him a second time each year on 3 September and commemorates the translation of his relics into Orthodox possession on 13 February .

 The 2016 Volta a Catalunya was a road cycling stage race that took place in Catalonia , Spain , from 21 to 27 March . It was the fifth race of the 2016 UCI World Tour and the 96th edition of the Volta a Catalunya . 
 The race included seven stages . Two of these included summit finishes , so the favourites for the race were all climbers . Favourites for overall victory included Chris Froome ( Team Sky ) , Alberto Contador ( Tinkoff ) , Nairo Quintana ( Movistar Team ) and the defending champion Richie Porte ( BMC Racing Team ) : the race was the first meeting of several of the riders expected to feature in the Grand Tours later in the season . 
 The first two stages were Nacer Bouhanni ( Cofidis ) . He then withdrew through illness on the third stage , which included the first summit finish . This was won by Dan Martin ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) , who took over the overall lead . Martin lost the lead , however , on the next stage , the second summit finish of the race , where Quintana won the stage and took over the overall lead . Quintana defended his lead over the following stage to take the overall victory , seven seconds ahead of Contador , with Martin ten seconds further back in third . Thomas De Gendt ( Lotto – Soudal ) won both the mountains and intermediate sprints classifications , with Hugh Carthy ( Caja Rural – Seguros RGA ) winning the young rider classification . BMC won the team classification .

 The 2016 Volta a Catalunya included seven stages , all of which were road stages with no time trials . The first two stages were moderately hilly and were possibly suitable for sprinters . The third and fourth stage both included summit finishes . The third stage finished on the climb of La Molina , with the fourth finishing at Port Ainé . The fifth stage included a climb shortly before the finish , giving an opportunity for an attack , before another flat stage on the sixth day . The final stage finished on a hilly circuit in Barcelona . 
 Following the cancellation of mountain stages in both Paris – Nice and Tirreno – Adriatico in the previous weeks , there was some concern before the start of the race that the Volta might also be affected by heavy snow ; the finish at Port Ainé still had 75 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 5 ft ) of snow on the nearby ski slopes . 
 = = Participating teams = = 
 The race organisers invited 25 teams to enter the Volta a Catalunya . These included the eighteen UCI WorldTeams , which were automatically invited and obliged to enter a team . Seven Professional Continental teams received wild card invitations Each team could include eight riders . Astana only included seven riders in their team , so 199 riders started the first stage . 
 = = Pre @-@ race favourites = = 
 The race was expected to be decided on its two mountainous days and so was particularly suited for climbers . Cyclingnews.com described the list of favourites for victory at the Volta as " formidable " and as including " almost all the main contenders for both the Giro d ’ Italia and the Tour de France " . Foremost among these was Chris Froome ( Team Sky ) , the reigning champion of the Tour de France . Froome 's only previous race in the 2016 season was the Herald Sun Tour , which he won . Froome had a strong team that included two other possible contenders for overall victory : Geraint Thomas ( who had won Paris – Nice ) and Wout Poels ( who had won the Volta a la <unk> <unk> ) . Froome 's form was , however , described by his directeur sportif as " an incognito " , given the long period since his last race . 
 The prominent riders competing with Froome for overall victory included Alberto Contador ( Tinkoff ) , the reigning champion of the Giro d 'Italia ; Nairo Quintana ( Movistar Team ) , who was second in the 2016 Tour de France ; Fabio Aru ( Astana ) , the reigning champion of the Vuelta a España ; and Richie Porte ( BMC Racing Team ) , the defending champion of the Volta itself . Other riders with a chance of high placings included Joaquim Rodríguez ( Team Katusha ) , who had won the race on two previous occasions , and Dan Martin ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) , the 2013 Volta winner , as well as many other climbers . 
 On account of the mountainous terrain , there were few pure sprinters starting the race . The strongest sprinter who was present was Nacer Bouhanni ( Cofidis ) , who had been strong in Paris – Nice and had been close to victory in Milan – San Remo until his chain slipped .

 21 March 2016 , Calella to Calella , 175 @.@ 8 km ( 109 @.@ 2 mi ) 
 The first stage of the Volta covered a 175 @.@ 8 @-@ kilometre ( 109 @.@ 2 mi ) course that started and ended on the coast in Calella ; the course looped through an inland region and crossed several climbs . After first travelling along the coast , the riders turned north as far as <unk> , then turned west to cross the day 's first climb , the second @-@ category Alt de les <unk> , followed immediately by the third @-@ category Alt de <unk> . As the roads turned back to the south , there was then a flat section before the biggest climb of the day , the first @-@ category Coli Formic . After the descent came the second @-@ category Alt de Montseny and the final climb of the day , the third @-@ category Alt de <unk> . The summit of the final climb came with 18 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 11 @.@ 3 mi ) to the finish line , on a long straight road in Calella . 
 An early breakaway was formed by Lluís Mas ( Caja Rural – Seguros RGA ) , Boris Dron ( Wanty – Groupe Gobert ) and Cameron Meyer ( Team Dimension Data ) ; they built a lead of over six minutes . From the climb of the Coll Formic , however , they were chased by Movistar and Cofidis ; Meyer was the first over the summit to take the lead of the mountains classification , but they were caught soon afterwards . On the Alt de Montseny , Louis Vervaeke ( Lotto – Soudal ) broke away , with a six @-@ man group chasing ; meanwhile the main group split in two until Vasil Kiryienka ( Sky ) pulled the groups back together . 
 With 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) remaining , Sky and Cofidis came to the front of the peloton to control the race for their sprinters . Björn Thurau attacked and was quickly brought back ; Nicolas Roche ( Sky ) then attacked on a slight uphill section of road with approximately 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) remaining and built a twelve @-@ second lead . He was caught , however , by Tinkoff and Orica – GreenEDGE within the final 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) . After Katusha led the peloton under the flamme rouge , Orica – GreenEDGE opened up the sprint with Simon Gerrans . Ben Swift ( Sky ) and Nacer Bouhanni ( Cofidis ) followed Gerrans and Bouhanni came past to win the stage . Swift was second , with Gerrans third .

 22 March , Mataró to Olot , 178 @.@ 7 km ( 111 @.@ 0 mi ) 
 The second stage was raced over a 178 @.@ 7 @-@ kilometre ( 111 @.@ 0 mi ) course from Mataró to Olot . The stage was generally flat , with two categorised climbs . The first of these was the third @-@ category Alt de Can <unk> after 30 kilometres ( 18 @.@ 6 mi ) . The second was the first @-@ category Alt de Els Angels ; at the summit of the climb there were 70 kilometres ( 43 mi ) remaining . In the final 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) , the roads rose again , although there was not a categorised climb and the final kilometres were flat . There was a 270 ° turn with just over 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) remaining ; after this the road was straight all the way to the finish . 
 Before the stage started , there was a minute 's silence to acknowledge the bombings in Brussels that morning , with many riders – especially the Belgians – wearing black armbands . There was a four @-@ man early breakaway that included two Belgians – Boris Dron ( Wanty – Groupe Gobert ) and Thomas De Gendt ( Lotto – Soudal ) – alongside Kamil <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) and Maxime Bouet ( Etixx – <unk> ) . Dron was first across both categorised climbs , with De Gendt winning both intermediate sprints and the associated bonus seconds . Dron fell away from the break with 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) remaining ; shortly afterwards De Gendt attacked alone . About 7 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) later , however , he gave up on his effort , as Cofidis were chasing too hard in the main peloton . 
 In the final 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) , there were several teams attempting to control the peloton – including Team Sky with Chris Froome sitting in second place in an attempt to keep him out of danger . Movistar moved to the front with 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) remaining , with FDJ and Orica – GreenEDGE also at the front . In the final 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) , however , Cofidis moved back to the front , with Geoffrey <unk> leading out Bouhanni . Bouhanni easily won the sprint , with Gianni Meersman ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) second and Philippe Gilbert ( BMC ) third . Bouhanni therefore extended his lead to 14 seconds ahead of Swift – who finished outside the top 10 – and De Gendt , who moved up to third thanks to the bonus seconds he won . Bouhanni revealed after the stage that he had been suffering from a sore stomach and had visited the race doctor .

 23 March , Girona to La Molina , 172 @.@ 1 km ( 106 @.@ 9 mi ) 
 The third stage included the first summit finish of the race . It covered a 172 @.@ 1 @-@ kilometre ( 106 @.@ 9 mi ) route from Girona to the La Molina ski resort . The route generally took the riders north @-@ west , with four first @-@ category climbs along the way . After passing through Olot , where Stage 2 had finished , the riders crossed the Alt de <unk> after 63 kilometres ( 39 @.@ 15 mi ) . There was then a long climb to the Alt de <unk> , the highest climb of the day , which came with 56 kilometres ( 34 @.@ 80 mi ) to the finish line . After the descent , the riders passed through Alp , then began the first climb to La Molina , a 12 @.@ 6 @-@ kilometre ( 7 @.@ 8 mi ) climb at an average gradient of 4 @.@ 2 % , including a descent towards the top . The riders then descended back into Alp and repeated the climb ; the finish of the stage came at the ski station itself . 
 The day 's early breakaway was formed by seven riders : Julian Alaphilippe ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) , Koen <unk> ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) , Kévin Reza ( FDJ ) , Johann Van Zyl ( Dimension Data ) , Jan Hirt ( CCC – Sprandi – Polkowice ) , Huub Duyn ( Roompot – Oranje Peloton ) and Alex Howes ( Cannondale ) . On the day 's first climb , Bouhanni lost several minutes due to his stomach illness ; after 90 kilometres ( 56 mi ) he was over seven minutes behind the peloton and was forced to retire from the race . Howes and Duyn attacked the breakaway and had a 31 @-@ second lead going into the first of the two ascents of La Molina . During the climb , Pieter Weening ( Roompot ) attacked from the peloton and caught the two breakaway riders ; almost immediately he attacked alone and built a gap . Meanwhile , Team Sky led the peloton with all eight riders , with Movistar close behind ; they quickly caught Howes and Duyn . Weening had about a minute 's advantage at the top of the climb . 
 During the descent , the peloton chased hard and reduced Weening 's advantage to 30 seconds , with Sky still leading the peloton . Louis Meintjes ( Lampre – Merida ) crashed shortly before the final climb began . On the climb , Louis Vervaeke attacked with 10 kilometres ( 6 mi ) remaining and passed Weening . Within the final 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) , the peloton caught him and the peloton stayed together , led by Sky , as the road descended briefly before the final ascent to the finishing line . Wout Poels ( Sky ) attacked as the road began to rise , but was followed by Contador . Quintana attacked next and was chased by Ilnur Zakarin ( Katusha ) and Contador . Richie Porte attempted to escape the group , but he was chased down by Froome . Quintana then attacked again and was followed by Dan Martin , who then passed Quintana and moved into the lead . Tejay van Garderen ( BMC ) chased , with Contador following , but Martin was able to stay away to the finish line . Contador finished two seconds back , with Romain Bardet ( AG2R La Mondiale ) third and van Garderen fourth , all on the same time . With the bonus seconds , Martin moved into the overall lead , six seconds ahead of Contador .

 24 March , <unk> to Port Ainé , 172 @.@ 2 km ( 107 @.@ 0 mi ) 
 The fourth stage included the second and final summit finish of the race . It covered a 172 @.@ 2 @-@ kilometre ( 107 @.@ 0 mi ) route from <unk> to Port Ainé , with four categorised climbs on the route . The first climb came at the very beginning of the day 's racing ; it was a third @-@ category climb whose summit came 5 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 5 mi ) into the stage . There was then a long flat section – which passed through Alp again – before the special @-@ category Port de Cantó . After a steep descent , there was a first @-@ category climb , followed by a descent . The final climb to Port Ainé was 18 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 11 @.@ 5 mi ) at 6 @.@ 8 % . 
 The early breakaway was formed by Philippe Gilbert ( BMC ) , Imanol Erviti ( Movistar ) , Rubén Plaza ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) , Thomas De Gendt ( Lotto – Soudal ) , Laurens ten Dam ( Giant – Alpecin ) , Kristijan Đurasek ( Lampre – Merida ) , Pieter Weening ( Roompot ) , Boris Dron ( Wanty – Groupe Gobert ) , Alexey Tsatevich ( Katusha ) and Ben Swift ( Team Sky ) . Dron won the special @-@ category climb , with the lead over the peloton at around ten minutes . The breakaway then broke up , with De Gendt and Erviti continuing together at the front of the race ; on the penultimate climb , they had a seven @-@ minute advantage on the peloton . Weening made contact with them again just before the summit of the climb and they collaborated on the descent . Coming towards the base of the final climb , Wout Poels ( Sky ) attacked from the peloton and linked up with Swift ; despite their work , they were unable to build a significant advantage as Contador chased them . 
 On the final climb , Erviti attacked , but he was soon passed by Weening , who built up a minute 's lead . Poels was eventually caught with 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) remaining , while De Gendt had caught up with Weening again . There were several attacks in the peloton , from Mikel Nieve ( Sky ) , Robert Gesink ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) and Miguel Ángel López ( Astana ) , but the first strong attack came from van Garderen . Contador eventually chased him , with Porte , Quintana and Martin following , but Martin was soon dropped . Van Garderen was caught by Contador 's group and Contador and Quintana then dropped the BMC riders . Meanwhile , De Gendt passed Weening and continued solo to take the stage win . Quintana attacked in the final 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) and finished second , 15 seconds ahead of Porte and Contador . Quintana therefore took over the race lead , with Contador eight seconds behind in second . 
 After the stage , Contador blamed his time loss to Quintana on the effort he had put into chasing down attacks in the final kilometres , in particular that of van Garderen . Porte also praised van Garderen 's efforts and was pleased with their collaboration . Froome , meanwhile , lost 37 seconds to Quintana and his directeur sportif , Nicolas Portal , said that he " didn 't have the legs " to follow the leaders ' attacks .

 25 March , <unk> to Valls , 187 @.@ 2 km ( 116 @.@ 3 mi ) 
 After two consecutive summit finishes , the fifth stage was simpler , with a 187 @.@ 2 @-@ kilometre ( 116 @.@ 3 mi ) stage with just two categorised climbs . The route took the riders south from <unk> to Valls . The first 65 kilometres ( 40 mi ) of the stage was fairly flat , before the second @-@ category Port d <unk> climb . The roads continued to be flat until the final 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) of the stage . First there was an uncategorised climb with a summit around 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) before the finish . Then , in the final 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) , there was the Alt de Lilla , a 4 @.@ 1 @-@ kilometre ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) , second @-@ category climb with an average gradient of 4 @.@ 8 % . After the final descent , the road slightly to the finish . 
 No breakaway was formed in the first two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours of racing . Dan Martin won the day 's first intermediate sprint , earning him three bonus seconds , with Contador taking one second for third place at the sprint . Eventually , after more than 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of racing , a seven @-@ rider breakaway was formed . The riders in the breakaway were Carlos Verona ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) , Dario Cataldo ( Astana ) , Jan Polanc ( Lampre – Merida ) , Kanstantsin Sivtsov ( Dimension Data ) , Tosh Van der Sande ( Lotto – Soudal ) , and Gaëtan Bille and Frederik Veuchelen ( both Wanty – Groupe Gobert ) . With 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) remaining , the breakaway had two minutes ' lead . On the Alt de Lilla , Poels attacked alone . At the summit , Poels had a lead of 20 seconds over the other breakaway riders . Cataldo and Verona attempted to chase him down , but their failure to collaborate in the chase meant that Sivtsov and Bille were able to catch them ; Poels 's lead extended to 30 seconds . In the final kilometres , the chase group got closer to him , but he was able to take the stage win , eleven seconds ahead of the chasing group . 
 In the main peloton , Quintana followed Contador on the climb . Daniel Navarro ( Cofidis ) , Rigoberto Urán ( Cannondale ) and Romain Bardet ( AG2R La Mondiale ) all attempted attacks but were unable to escape . The peloton of 66 riders finished 33 seconds behind Poels , with no change to the overall standings . 
 = = = Stage 6 = = = 
 26 March , Sant Joan <unk> to Vilanova i la Geltrú , 197 @.@ 2 km ( 122 @.@ 5 mi ) 
 The sixth stage took the riders 197 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 122 @.@ 5 mi ) from Sant Joan <unk> to Vilanova i la Geltrú . The riders initially travelled along the coast , crossing the third @-@ category Alt de la Maradona , then turned inland for a long loop . The day 's most significant climb , the second @-@ category Alt de la <unk> , came after 110 kilometres ( 68 mi ) , but the roads were otherwise mainly flat . The route turned back towards the coast to the finish . 
 One of the principal sprinters left in the race , Sky 's Ben Swift , pulled out of the stage before the start due to illness . There was again a fast start to the stage . Riders attempted to form a breakaway , but the teams with overall favourites sought to give their riders a chance at contesting the intermediate sprint that came after 12 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) . The sprint was won by Dan Martin , putting him just one second off the overall podium . After another 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) of racing , the day 's breakaway was finally formed by eleven riders : Petr Vakoč ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) , Esteban Chaves ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) , Laurens Ten Dam ( Giant – Alpecin ) , Ryder Hesjedal ( Trek – Segafredo ) , Bert @-@ Jan Lindeman ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) , Alex Howes ( Cannondale ) , Cameron Meyer ( Dimension Data ) , Axel Domont ( AG2R La Mondiale ) , Romain Hardy and Rudy Molard ( both Cofidis ) , and Marco <unk> ( Wanty – Groupe Gobert ) . Around halfway through the stage , they had a lead of five minutes but , due to the flat terrain , there were several teams with sprinters who were determined to bring the break back . Lampre – Merida did most of the work at the front of the peloton ; several riders also fell away from the breakaway during the course of the stage . In the final 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) , Trek – Segafredo joined in the chase ; Tinkoff then tried to split the peloton in the crosswinds but were unsuccessful . 
 With 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) remaining , the breakaway had a 40 @-@ second lead . Vakoč made a failed attempt at a solo attack ; the lead was reduced to 20 seconds with 7 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) remaining . Meyer , Lindeman , Vakoč and Molard attacked again and stayed clear of the peloton into the final kilometre . The chasing group was close , however , and Meyer made another attack ; he was caught in the final 100 metres ( 330 ft ) . Davide Cimolai ( Lampre – Merida ) used the slipstream of the breakaway riders to launch his sprint and won the stage comfortably . It was Cimolai 's first ever World Tour victory , and Lampre – Merida 's first victory at any level in 2016 .

 27 March , Barcelona to Barcelona , 136 @.@ 4 km ( 84 @.@ 8 mi ) 
 The final stage followed a 136 @.@ 4 @-@ kilometre ( 84 @.@ 8 mi ) course that started and finished in Barcelona . The stage began by taking the riders north out of the city as far as <unk> , where there was a second @-@ category climb . The route then turned back south , crossing a third @-@ category climb as it returned to Barcelona after 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) of racing . There were then eight laps of a 6 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometre ( 4 @.@ 0 mi ) finishing circuit , each lap including the third @-@ category climb of the Alt de Montjuïc . 
 Early in the stage , Dan Martin came third in an intermediate sprint , giving him a bonus second . He was level on time with Porte , but moved ahead of him into third place thanks to his better placings through the race . There was then a 12 @-@ man breakaway , whose lead was over three minutes at the start of the first circuit . There were attacks in the breakaway group from <unk> Mas ( Caja Rural – Seguros RGA ) and Matej Mohorič ( Lampre – Merida ) . In the peloton , there was a brief attack by Contador , then a more significant attack from Fabio Aru . Aru was joined by Barguil and Vervaeke and they gained half a minute . They were brought back by Quintana 's Movistar team ; Froome then immediately made an attack . Quintana chased the move down himself , with Contador , Rodríguez and Navarro following , and the group was caught by the peloton . Hugh Carthy ( Caja Rural – Seguros RGA ) also made an unsuccessful attack . 
 Mohorič was passed by Alexey Tsatevich ( Katusha ) and <unk> <unk> ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) , who went on to contest a two @-@ man sprint . Tsatevich won the sprint , despite an early celebration that nearly allowed <unk> to come past him . The peloton finished together , 14 seconds behind , with <unk> <unk> ( IAM ) winning the sprint for third place . Quintana therefore sealed his overall victory , with Contador second and Martin third . 
 = = Post @-@ race analysis = = 
 = = = Reactions = = = 
 Quintana described himself as " very pleased and proud " with his victory , describing it as one of the toughest races of his career , especially after his team was reduced to five riders in the final stages . He said , however , that he did not believe he was significantly ahead of Contador , Froome or his other rivals for the major races later in the season , saying that " there ’ s a long way to go for the Tour " . Contador , meanwhile , described himself as " very happy with how I 'm feeling " , though he described it as a " pity " that he had lost Paris – Nice by four seconds and the Volta a Catalunya by seven . He suggested that he could have won the race had he ridden differently on Stage 4 to Port @-@ Ainé . Nicolas Portal , Chris Froome 's directeur sportif , described his form as " very encouraging " , saying that all he lacked was the top @-@ end speed when the other riders accelerated at the end of the mountain stages . One other prominent performance was that of Hugh Carthy , who finished ninth overall and won the young rider classification . He described it as " by far the best [ he 'd ] ever performed " ; Cyclingnews.com described it as a " breakthrough performance " . 
 = = = UCI World Tour standings = = = 
 The top ten riders in the Volta a Catalunya general classification were awarded points in the 2016 UCI World Tour competition . Points were also awarded for finishing in the top five places on each stage . With the points from the Volta , Quintana entered the rankings in eighth place , while Contador moved from tenth to third . Despite his fourth place , Porte was unable to defend his first place in the rankings , as Peter Sagan ( Tinkoff ) had won points from both the E3 Harelbeke and the Gent – Wevelgem and moved into the lead . Tinkoff also moved into the lead of the teams ' rankings , while Australia remained top in the nations ' rankings . 
 = = Classifications = = 
 In the 2016 Volta a Catalunya , four different jerseys were awarded . The most important of these was the general classification , calculated by adding each rider 's finishing times on each stage . Time bonuses were awarded to the first three riders at the intermediate sprints on each stage ( 3 , 2 and 1 seconds respectively ) and at each stage finish ( 10 , 6 and 4 seconds ) . The leader wore a white and green jersey . A related competition was the youth classification : the highest @-@ ranked rider born after 1 January 1991 was the leader of this classification and wore a " design " jersey . 
 Additionally , there was a sprints classification , the leader of which was awarded a white jersey . In the sprints classification , riders received points for finishing in the top three at intermediate sprint points during each stage . There was also a mountains classification , the leadership of which was marked by a red jersey . Points for this classification were won by the first riders to the top of each categorised climb , with more points available for the higher @-@ categorised climbs . 
 There was also a classification for teams , in which the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added together ; the leading team at the end of the race was the team with the lowest total time .

 = Crested shelduck = 
 The crested shelduck or Korean crested shelduck ( Tadorna cristata ) is a species of bird in the family Anatidae . It is critically endangered and may be extinct . The male crested shelduck has a greenish @-@ black crown , breast , primaries , and tail , while the rest of its face , chin , and throat are brownish black . The male 's belly , undertail coverts , and flanks are a dark grey with black striations . The upper wing coverts are white , while its speculum is an iridescent green . The female has a white eye ring , black crest , white face , chin , throat , neck , and uppers wing coverts and a dark brown body with white striations . Additionally , both sexes have a distinctive green tuft of feathers protruding from the head . 
 Very little is known about this bird because of the limited number of observations of this species . It apparently breeds in Korea and eastern Russia and is probably a relict species that had a wider distribution in prehistoric times . Some think that this species is extinct , although occasional sightings are reported , including a number of recent reports from the interior wetlands of China . Due to the persistent reports of the species ' survival , it is listed as critically endangered . However , the crested shelduck has not been definitively sighted since 1964 . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The crested shelduck was initially collected in April 1877 near Vladivostock , Russia . However , it was not described until 1890 when the English zoologist Philip Lutley Sclater decided that the specimen was a possible hybrid between the ruddy shelduck ( Tadorna ferruginea ) and <unk> duck ( Anas falcata ) . Around 1913 , a pair was collected in Korea , and the male was presented to Japanese ornithologist <unk> Kuroda . Kuroda noted that the plumage of the specimens was not definitively intermediate between Sclater 's suggested parents of the alleged hybrid . Another female was collected and given to Kuroda in 1916 , and supported by three specimens of a bird which was clearly not a hybrid and a historical record of the species in Japan , Kuroda described this bird as <unk> cristata in 1917 . The 1916 female was designated the holotype and preserved with the male in Kuroda 's collection . A member of the family Anatidae , this species was considered distinct enough to merit its own genus by Kuroda , but is now placed in the genus Tadorna , which includes six other species of Old World shelducks . The genus name Tadorna comes from the Celtic word <unk> and means " pied waterfowl " , essentially the same as the English " shelduck " . The specific epithet , cristata , comes from the Latin word for crested . The species ' common name is derived from the tuft of green feathers from the shelduck 's head . This species is also known as the Korean crested shelduck , Korean <unk> , and Korean Mandarin . 
 = = Description = = 
 The crested shelduck is sexually dimorphic , with the male possessing a greenish @-@ black crown , breast , primaries , and tail , while the rest of its face , chin , and throat are brownish black . The male 's belly , undertail coverts , and flanks are a dark grey with black striations . The upper wing <unk> are white , while its speculum is an iridescent green . The female has a large white eye ring , black crest , and white face , chin , throat , neck , and upper wing coverts . It also has a dark brown body with white striations . Both sexes have a green tuft of feathers protruding from their head . The crested shelduck is about 63 to 71 centimetres ( 25 to 28 in ) long , and therefore is slightly larger than a mallard . Its bill and legs are pinkish , though those of the female are paler than those of the male . The bill of the male has a small , knob @-@ like appendage at its base . The plumage of the immature is unknown . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The crested shelduck has been collected near Vladivostok in Russia and near <unk> and Kunsan in Korea . It has been proposed that the species breeds in far @-@ eastern Russia , northern North Korea , and northeast China and winters in southern Japan , southwest Korea , and along the east China coast as far south as Shanghai . It is believed to have a relict range , or to have been more widespread in historic times . 
 This species is believed to live in a wide variety of wetland and deep @-@ water habitats at varying elevations . While all collected individuals are from the coast , especially near river mouths , recently there have been a number of reports from interior wetlands in northeastern China . It has been speculated that this species may breed in mountainous areas either away from water or on volcanic lakes . 
 = = Ecology and behavior = = 
 Though not much is known about this shelduck , it is believed to be migratory , traveling from Siberia in the breeding season to Korea , southern Russia , and Japan for the winter . The crested shelduck is believed to eat aquatic vegetation , agricultural crops , algae , invertebrates , mollusks , crustaceans , carrion , and garbage . It has been suggested that this shelduck may be a nocturnal feeder . While its nest has not been described , similar shelducks nest in burrows and cavities ; it has also been suggested that this species may nest in tree cavities . It has been proposed that this species lays less than ten eggs which the female alone incubates . It is believed to breed from May to July . The shelduck has been observed in flocks of two to eight birds . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 The crested shelduck has never been numerous in modern times , though it is thought to have been more widespread historically due to its presence in Japanese aviculture . The species is known from only a handful of sightings and some retroactively declared it extinct in 1916 after a female was shot at Busan , South Korea . In 1943 , a sighting of this bird was reported near <unk> , building hopes that the species persisted . A group of three birds , two females and a male , was sighted by two Russian students in 1964 in the Rimsky @-@ Korsakov Archipelago near Vladivostok with a small flock of harlequin ducks . In 1971 it was reported from North Korea 's northeast coast and in 1985 two were reported from eastern Russia . However , there are severe doubts about the accuracy of the 1971 record . A recent survey of Chinese hunters resulted in a number of unconfirmed reports from northeastern China . For example , a Chinese forest worker claimed that he unknowingly ate two in 1984 . There are also unconfirmed reports of about twenty crested shelducks in the <unk> region of Yunnan , though many believe this flock to be a misidentified flock of ruddy shelducks . It is believed that , if the species survives , there likely are fewer than 50 individuals . 
 This species is threatened with extinction due to habitat loss , hunting , and <unk> . In an attempt to gather reports of this species and raise awareness to prevent hunters from consuming this species , 300 @,@ 000 leaflets were distributed in Russia , Japan , China , South Korea , and North Korea in 1983 , with the only resulting report being the 1971 North Korea record . 15 @,@ 000 leaflets were distributed in northeastern China in 1985 and 1991 . While this garnered 82 reports of the species , follow @-@ up surveys of the area failed to find the shelduck . The <unk> Development Project is threatening to destroy potential habitat in the area of several of the historic records .

 This duck was collected in Korea and exported to Japan between 1716 and 1736 for aviculture , where it was known as the Korean Mandarin Duck . It was captured for aviculture in Japan up to at least 1854 and was portrayed in the Kanbun @-@ <unk> , a Japanese <unk> work . Old Chinese tapestries also portray a duck similar in appearance to the crested shelduck . Kuroda claimed that Japanese hunters were still hunting the species in Korea in the 1920s . Three specimens exist in museums . The only male specimen is kept with a female in the Kuroda collection in the Yamashina Institute for Ornithology , Tokyo . The male was collected at the mouth of the <unk> River in 1913 or 1914 , and the female was collected near Busan in December 1916 . The female specimen described by Philip Lutley Sclater , collected by Lieutenant F. <unk> near Vladivostok in April 1877 , was displayed in 1894 by the Zoological Society of London and today is kept in the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen . Two additional crested shelduck specimens are known to have existed , though both have been lost . The female collected in 1913 along with the sole male was given to a friend of the collector and subsequently has vanished . Additionally , around 1900 a Chinese hunter offered a specimen to a Peking University professor , but , as the professor did not realize how rare the bird was , he turned it down . In 1991 , the crested shelduck appeared on a Mongolian postage stamp . 
 = Principality of Stavelot @-@ Malmedy = 
 The Principality of Stavelot @-@ Malmedy was an ecclesiastical principality of the Holy Roman Empire . Princely power was exercised by the Benedictine abbot of the imperial double monastery of Stavelot and Malmedy , founded in 651 . At 600 km2 ( 230 sq mi ) , it was among the smaller territories in the Empire . Along with Bouillon and the Prince @-@ Bishopric of Liège , it was one of only three principalities in the region that were never a part of the Southern Netherlands , all having been a part of the Lower Rhenish Imperial Circle , rather than the Burgundian Circle . 
 As a prince @-@ abbot , the abbot of Stavelot @-@ Malmedy sat in the College of Ruling Princes of the Ecclesiastical Bench of the Imperial Diet . Along with the handful of other prince @-@ abbots , he cast a full vote ( <unk> virile ) , in contrast to the majority of imperial abbots who were only entitled to a collective vote on their respective curial benches . 
 In 1795 the principality was abolished and its territory was incorporated into the French département of Ourthe . The Congress of Vienna in 1815 assigned Stavelot to the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and Malmedy became part of the Prussian district of Eupen @-@ Malmedy . Both are currently parts of the Kingdom of Belgium — since the 1830 Belgian Revolution and the 1919 Treaty of Versailles respectively . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Establishment = = = 
 Saint Remaclus founded the Abbey of Stavelot on the <unk> river circa 650 on lands occupying the border between the bishoprics of Cologne and Tongeren , this territory previously having been part of the Frankish Carolingian Empire . A charter of Sigebert III , king of Austrasia entrusted Remaclus with both monasteries of Stavelot and Malmedy a few kilometres eastwards in the Ardennes forest , " a place of horror and solitary isolation which abounds with wild beasts " . Sigebert granted forest land and his Mayor of the Palace , <unk> the Elder , was charged with furnishing money to build the two monasteries and continued to foster these communities with personal gifts and means from the king . 
 The monastery of Malmedy is considered by the historians and the hagiographers to be slightly older than the monastery of Stavelot , with the town claiming foundation in 648 . Malmedy is listed on earlier maps than Stavelot and the commission appointed in 670 by Childeric II , in order to delimit the abbey territory , started from Malmedy ( Latin : de Monasterio <unk> ) . Afterwards , the territory of the abbey was increased westwards so that Stavelot became the geographical centre and the capital of the principality . 
 The site of Malmedy was probably already settled before the foundation of the abbey , despite etymology seeming to indicate Malmedy may have been unsuitable for settlement . Mal ( u ) <unk> ( a ) <unk> was " a place with winding waters " or , most probably , <unk> @-@ <unk> , a " bad <unk> " . The <unk> was partially canalised and its banks strengthened , before which Malmedy was often flooded . 
 The first church in Stavelot was built by abbot Godwin and , on 25 June 685 , was dedicated to the saints Martin , Peter and Paul . The relics of Saint Remaclus were held in this new church . The abbey church in Malmedy was dedicated to St Benedict . 
 = = = Development and the High Middle Ages = = = 
 In 747 , Carloman , Duke of the Franks and Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia , increased the abbeys ' lands from his own on his abdication . Throughout the ninth century , the abbeys played an important cultural role in Lotharingia , particularly thanks to abbot Christian . Around 875 , the relics of St Quirinus were translated from <unk> to Malmedy Abbey after the intercession of Emperor Charles the Bald , partly to secure relics comparable to those of St Remaclus at Stavelot . 
 Through the seventh and eighth centuries , the two abbeys followed their mission of evangelism , along with forest clearance . With the decline of the Carolingian Empire , however , the abbeys suffered the same decay as elsewhere , leaving the principality in the custody of lay abbots — temporal guardians — from 844 to 938 , including <unk> , archbishop of Rheims , <unk> the Seneschal and <unk> and <unk> , dukes of Lorraine . 
 Welcoming pilgrims and the sick was a part of the monks ' mission . The <unk> sancti <unk> mention the <unk> , the monastery 's hospice , where poor pilgrims are granted hospitality , including food for almost eight days , whilst they make their devotions ; this hospice differs from the abbey 's hospital : <unk> <unk> . On 13 April 862 , Lothair II of Lotharingia , while dealing with the distribution of property " ad hospital <unk> <unk> " , ordered that local tithes be paid to the hospital " <unk> <unk> et <unk> " , an order he confirmed on 10 June 873 . 
 In December 881 , Normans invaded the area , including <unk> , Duke of Frisia , burning both abbeys and causing the monks to flee with their treasures and relics . Several historical sources provide evidence on the raid of 881 , which was well prepared and organised . The monks rushed to dig up the relics of Remaclus and fled to the county of <unk> in present @-@ day <unk> @-@ sur @-@ Meuse in the French Ardennes ; the surrounding region was largely unaffected by the invasion . Stavelot and Malmedy were both burned , with the monks not returning until just before Christmas 882 , with a stay in <unk> allowed them to repair the roofs of the monastic buildings . Relics from Aachen , which had been entrusted to the monks at Stavelot because of the Norman threat , were returned intact . In gratitude , on 13 November 882 , Charles the Fat , Carolingian emperor and king of East Francia , Alemannia and Italy , granted the abbeys the lands of <unk> , a dependency of <unk> , and restored to them the chapel in Bra ( now a part of <unk> in Liège ) . 
 In 885 , Normans extracted ransom from <unk> and passed through the Meuse valley , marching on Prüm , causing the monks of Stavelot to flee again , finding refuge in the county of Logne and <unk> ; the <unk> <unk> details the flight from the invaders and follows the monks ' wanderings . After the invasions , abbot Odilon rebuilt the ruined abbey of Stavelot ; with support from bishops of Liège — including <unk> , the first prince @-@ bishop — the abbots Odilon and <unk> rebuilt the abbeys , with new buildings , the re @-@ establishment of the monastic community and the re @-@ organisation of the principality ; by the time of the Ottonian dynasty in the early 10th century , the abbeys were once again of suitable Imperial stature . A new abbey church was built in Malmedy in 992 , dedicated to St Quirinus ; in 1007 , a parish church was consecrated to Saint Gereon . 
 Another danger threatened the abbey — and the Western Empire — in the tenth century : the Hungarian invasions . Having been deposed as duke of Lotharingia , Conrad the Red invited the Hungarians to undermine his opponents , Bruno the Great , archbishop of Cologne , and <unk> III , Count of Hainaut . The Annales <unk> report : " Anno 954 <unk> <unk> regiones <unk> ... Anno 995 . Victoria des <unk> " ( English : In the year 954 , Hungarians ravage the regions of Gaul ... In the year 995 , victory over the Hungarians ) . On 1 July 960 , <unk> , bishop of Liège , driven by the fears of the time , granted the monks a location to build a refuge in Liège . Five years earlier , the victory of emperor Otto I over the Hungarians at Lechfeld proved the danger from Hungarian sack . 
 The key building period at the abbey of Stavelot corresponds to the rule of prince @-@ abbot Poppo of Deinze , the second founder of the abbey , who was made abbot by Holy Roman Emperor Henry II in 1020 . He built an imposing church over 100 metres ( 330 ft ) in length , which was consecrated in the presence of Emperor Henry III on 5 June 1040 . As well as confirming the authenticity of the relics of St Quirinus at Malmedy in 1042 , Poppo revived the cult of St Remaclus . Poppo died in 1048 ; his cult , which began almost immediately , focused on his resting place in the crypt . Thietmar was the lay patron who assembled carpenters and stonemasons to build the abbey church . Malmedy developed around the monastery ; until the end of the tenth century , the villagers used the chapel of Saint Laurent , an <unk> of the abbey church , as their place of worship . 
 In 1065 , controversy arose when Anno II , Archbishop of Cologne , named <unk> of <unk> abbot of Malmedy , on dubious authority — whilst Malmedy was in the archdiocese of Cologne , the two abbeys were linked and , thus , under the purview of the diocese of Liège , where Stavelot lay . This occurred despite several previous Imperial bulls reinforcing the position that the two abbeys should be subject to a single abbot . The monks from Stavelot processed to Malmedy with the crosier and relics of St Remaclus to remind the rebellious monks of the traditional order for the abbeys that the saint had instituted . The relics and crosier were also transported to an Imperial Diet of Henry IV in Goslar . In 1066 , they processed again , this time to Aachen and <unk> ; they processed to Bitburg and Bamberg the following year . That their prayers were not answered apparently led the monks to despair that the relics were becoming impotent or that the monks were being punished by their patron ; in 1067 and 1068 , abbot Thierry even went to Rome to appeal to Pope Alexander II . This impasse lasted for a further three years , until Henry held court at Liège at Easter in 1071 ; with great ceremony , the monks processed with Remaclus 's relics to meet with his legendary fellow bishop St Lambert , joined en route by the relics of St <unk> . Numerous miracles convinced the emperor to recognise the union of the two abbeys and reiterate the superiority of Stavelot , forcing Anno eventually to capitulate . A <unk> procession back to Stavelot paused en route to celebrate Mass on the banks of the Meuse ; finally , the monks processed with Remaclus 's relics to the abbey at Malmedy , to symbolise the restoration of his and their authority . This series of episodes is recounted in the heroic narrative of the Triumph of St Remaclus and confirmed in several contemporary sources . 
 In 1098 , Wibald was born in the hamlet of <unk> , near Stavelot . Elected prince @-@ abbot in 1130 , he played a key international @-@ level role in the religious life of the region and the abbeys . In 1138 , he granted permission for the castle to be built in Logne , first mentioned in an 862 abbey charter . In the 12th to 15th centuries , however , the abbacy experienced a slow decline . In the 14th and 15th centuries , several Imperial edicts afforded the protection of the counts of Luxembourg , firstly under Emperor Charles IV .

 In 1509 , William of <unk> organised a procession to induce the recalcitrant county of Logne , a fief of the abbey , to submit to his jurisdiction . The cortège was pious , rather than fraught with tension , with Stavelot monks carrying the shrines of Remaclus and <unk> with other reliquaries and the monks of Malmedy with reliquaries of Quirinus , Just , Peter and Philip joined by parishioners from <unk> with the relics of <unk> . In 1521 , after the castle in Logne had been dismantled , William added " Count of Logne " to the abbots ' titles , with the county representing most of the western portion of the principality 's territory . 
 The abbey church served as a monastic church and as a church of pilgrimage until the French Revolution . Its imposing gatehouse tower was rebuilt in 1534 ; its ground floor is all that remains , though the abbey church has been excavated and its layout is shown on the ground . Malmedy began to flourish particularly in the 16th century with the development of tannery ; in 1544 there were only 216 houses with a thousand inhabitants , but that over tripled by 1635 . 
 After the death of abbot Christopher of <unk> , there was a series of absent abbots , including Maximilian Henry of Bavaria ( who was also bishop of Liège and of Hildesheim ) , who reformed the abbey in 1656 . In the 17th century , Stavelot and Malmedy were major centres of tanning in Europe . Other industries also known to Malmedy include cotton manufacturing , manufacture of chess sets , dominoes and gingerbread ; papermaking was particularly important to Malmedy , as was the manufacture of gunpowder . In 1659 , a Capuchin convent was built in Stavelot . 
 Despite the abbacy 's neutrality and the protection of the prince @-@ abbots , the territory was invaded at least 50 times by troops passing through , whose depredations had disastrous consequences for the population , including the 4 October 1689 razing of both Stavelot and Malmedy on the orders of Nicolas <unk> , general to Louis XIV of France , during the Nine Years ' War . In Stavelot , the entire town , including over 360 houses , was destroyed , leaving just the abbey and its farmyard standing ; Some 600 out of the 660 houses of the town were destroyed and it took more than a century to completely rebuild Malmedy . Malmedy 's 1601 city walls had previously been destroyed by French troops in 1658 , during the 1635 – 59 Franco @-@ Spanish War . The wars , and passage by troops of Brandenburg @-@ Prussia , the Dutch Republic , France and Liège , had cost the principality the sum of 2 @.@ 75 million Reichsthaler , requiring the abbey to borrow 134 000 thalers from Liège and Verviers ; another loan , shared amongst the communities , totalled 109 000 thalers , with annual interest of 14 161 thalers and arrears of 26 000 thalers . 
 By the start of the 18th century the principality had lost a third of its territory , as a result of war , fires , pillage and unjust encroachments . The deputies to the Imperial Diet complained that , in the 16th century , the Spanish Netherlands had seized several territories and that the Bishopric of Liège had stolen over half a dozen seigneuries totalling over 2000 households , adding that the principality itself retained only 1693 households , having had <unk> households before the upheavals and that the suffering of the principality had caused some of the richest and most powerful families to emigrate . The Imperial Diet was moved to halve the <unk> for the abbeys ( reducing the sums and troops the abbeys needed to provide towards the Imperial army ) and exempting any need for the abbeys to send troops to the Imperial army for three years , an exemption extended for four more years on 24 March 1715 .
