 Constructed in 1847 , the new 80 @-@ foot ( 24 m ) octagonal tower was constructed by Marcus Bassett with East Haven brownstone from Jabez Potter 's quarry . The interior of the lighthouse was lined with New Haven brick and a 74 @-@ step granite stairway leads to the cast @-@ iron lantern . The light was powered by 12 lamps with reflectors and was located 97 feet ( 30 m ) above sea level . Also constructed was a new two @-@ and @-@ one @-@ half story brick house to replace the one in a " very bad state of repair " . The light would be replaced with a fourth @-@ order Fresnel lens in 1855 . In the 1860s , a fog bell was also added . 
 The lighthouse was extinguished in 1877 when the offshore Southwest Ledge Light replaced it for navigation . The keeper , <unk> Thompson , went to be the Southwest Ledge Light 's keeper for five years before returning to live in the Five Mile Point Light keeper 's quarters and fly storm signal flags for the United States Weather Bureau . In 1896 , the lighthouse was transferred to the United States Department of War and was improved by a <unk> named Albert <unk> . In 1922 , the property was split up , with the land given to the state of Connecticut and the buildings to the city of New Haven . Two years later , New Haven purchased the land from the state for $ 11 @,@ 180 . The tower was renovated in 1986 . The $ 86 @,@ 000 restoration included repairing cracked mortar , steam cleaning the interior and exterior and removing " guano [ that had ] accumulated over the decades " .

 Roth and Clouette note that the " Five Mile Point Lighthouse is significant because it embodies the distinctive characteristics of American lighthouse construction during the first half of the 19th century ... [ it ] is also significant in the maritime history of New Haven . " The keeper 's dwelling currently is a private residence for New Haven Recreation Department personnel and has been modified with the addition of a porch . The lighthouse and the keeper 's residence were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990 .

 = Mascarene martin = 
 The Mascarene martin or Mascarene swallow ( Phedina borbonica ) is a passerine bird in the swallow family that breeds in Madagascar and in the Mascarene Islands . The nominate subspecies occurs on Mauritius and Réunion and has never been found away from the Mascarene Islands , but the smaller Madagascan subspecies , P. b. madagascariensis , is migratory and has been recorded wintering in East Africa or wandering to other Indian Ocean islands . 
 The Mascarene martin is a small swallow that has grey @-@ brown underparts becoming white on the throat and lower abdomen , dark grey @-@ brown upperparts and a slightly forked tail . The underparts are heavily streaked with black . It nests in small colonies anywhere with suitably sheltered sites for constructing a nest , such as ledges , buildings , tunnels , caves or amongst rocks . The nest is a shallow cup of twigs and other plant material , and the normal clutch is two or three brown @-@ spotted white eggs . The incubation and fledging times are unknown . The Mascarene martin has a heavy flight with slow wingbeats interspersed with glides , and frequently perches on wires . It feeds on insects in flight , often hunting low over the ground or vegetation . In eastern Africa , open habitats such as deforested areas are frequently used for hunting . A number of internal and external parasites have been detected in this species . 
 Tropical cyclones can adversely affect populations on the smaller islands , but the Mascarene martin is a locally common bird with an apparently stable population and is classed as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) . Its legal protection ranges from none on the French overseas department of Réunion to a status on Mauritius as a " species of wildlife in respect of which more severe penalties are provided " . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The Mascarene martin was first formally described in 1789 as Hirundo borbonica by German zoologist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his 13th edition of Linnaeus 's Systema Naturae . It is likely that the species had previously been described by French naturalist Philibert Commerson who died in Mauritius in 1773 . His huge collection of specimens and notes was sent back to the Paris Museum in 1774 , but destroyed by sulphur fumigation in about 1810 . French biologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte moved the martin to his newly created genus Phedina in 1855 . The genus name is derived from the Greek phaios ( φαιός ) " brown " and the Italian rondine " swallow " , and the species name refers to the Île de Bourbon ( old French name for Réunion ) . There are two subspecies , nominate P. borbonica borbonica on Mauritius and Réunion , and P. b. madagascariensis in Madagascar . 
 The Phedina swallows are placed within the Hirundininae subfamily , which comprises all swallows and martins except the very distinctive river martins . DNA sequence studies suggest that there are three major groupings within the Hirundininae , broadly correlating with the type of nest built . These groups are the " core martins " , including burrowing species like the sand martin ; the " nest @-@ adopters " , which are birds like the tree swallow that utilise natural cavities ; and the " mud nest builders " , such as the barn swallow , which build a nest from mud . The Phedina species nest in burrows and therefore belong to the " core martins " . 
 The genus Phedina is thought to be an early offshoot from the main swallow lineage , although the striped plumage of its two species suggests a distant relationship with streaked African Hirundo species . The other member of the genus is the Brazza 's martin P. brazzae , although in the past it has sometimes been suggested that Brazza 's martin should be moved to its own genus , Phedinopsis , due to the significant differences in vocalisations and nest type from its relative . The nearest relation of the two Phedina martins is the banded martin , Riparia cincta , which appears not to be closely related to the other members of its current genus and resembles Brazza 's martin in its nesting habits and calls . The current Association of European Rarities Committees ( AERC ) -recommended practice is to move the banded martin to its own genus as Neophedina cincta , rather than to merge it into Phedina , since the banded martin 's larger size , different bill and nostril shape and non @-@ colonial nesting are differences from the current Phedina species . German ornithologist Gustav Hartlaub separated the Madagascan population of the Mascarene martin as a full species , P. madagascariensis , but more recent authorities have considered it to be only a subspecies , P. b. madagascariensis . 
 = = Description = = 
 Adult Mascarene martins of the nominate subspecies are 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) long with wings averaging 117 mm ( 4 @.@ 6 in ) and weigh 23 @.@ 9 g ( 0 @.@ 84 oz ) . This small hirundine has dark brown @-@ grey upperparts with faint streaking . It has grey @-@ brown underparts becoming white on the throat and lower abdomen , all being heavily streaked with black . The slightly forked tail averages 54 @.@ 6 mm ( 2 @.@ 15 in ) long and has white edges to the brown undertail coverts . The wings are blackish @-@ brown and the bill and legs are black . The eyes are dark brown and the black bill averages 11 @.@ 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 44 in ) long . The sexes are similar , but juvenile birds have more diffuse breast streaking , and white tips to the feathers covering the closed wing . The Madagascan subspecies is overall paler and larger @-@ billed than the nominate form . It has denser streaking on the breast , but only very fine lines on the lower abdomen and on the white undertail . It is distinctly smaller than the nominate subspecies , 12 – 14 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 – 5 @.@ 5 in ) in length with an average weight of 20 @.@ 6 g ( 0 @.@ 73 oz ) . This martin moults in December and January on Mauritius , and Madagascan breeders wintering on the African mainland moult in June and July . 
 The Mascarene martin is a relatively quiet bird , but it has a warbled siri @-@ liri siri @-@ liri song given in flight or when perched ; some calls given by perched birds end in a glissando . Other vocalisations may be used during mating or displays of aggression . There is a chip contact call , and the young birds produce a fast twittering sound when begging for food . Birds wintering in mainland Africa are usually silent . 
 No other streaked swallow species occur within the island breeding range of the Mascarene martin , and in Africa the lesser striped swallow is larger , has a deeply forked tail and a very different plumage , with dark blue upperparts , a red rump and a chestnut head . The brown @-@ throated sand martin has similar structure and plumage colour to the Mascarene martin , but has plain , unstreaked underparts . The small Mascarene swiftlet has longer , narrower wings than the martin , and a much lighter flight . The Brazza 's martin is smaller , has a plainer back and finer dashing on the throat and chest , but there is no range overlap . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The Mascarene martin 's breeding range is restricted to Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands . The nominate subspecies breeds on Mauritius and Réunion and P. b. madagascariensis occurs in Madagascar . It may also nest on Pemba Island where it has been seen in the breeding season . Breeding habitat can be anywhere with suitable sites for constructing a nest , such as ledges , buildings , tunnels , caves or amongst rocks . The martin is found on the east side of Réunion between 200 – 500 m ( 660 – 1 @,@ 640 ft ) , and on the south and west coasts of Mauritius . It also occurs on inland cliffs on Mauritius . 
 The subspecies P. b. borbonica is resident on Mauritius and Réunion , although there are local seasonal movements on these island , but the Madagascan subspecies is migratory . The Imerina Plateau is deserted from April to September , the martins moving to lower ground or to the African mainland . It is normally uncommon and local in coastal Mozambique , Zambia , Malawi and Pemba Island , and very rare in Kenya and mainland Tanzania , although large numbers sometimes winter in Mozambique or Malawi . It has also been recorded from Comoros and other Indian Ocean locations including at least four islands in the Seychelles . As of 2012 , a total of eight birds had been sighted in the Seychelles , occurring in both the spring and autumn migration periods . Some of these records may be due to vagrant birds carried by cyclones . There are unsubstantiated claims of occurrences in the Transvaal . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 The Mascarene martin has a heavy flight with slow wingbeats interspersed with glides , and may repeatedly return to a favourite perch . This martin is often seen perched on wires , and sometimes rests on sandy beaches . The martin roosts in small flocks in bushes , on buildings or on cliffs . Sometimes it is joined at the roost by other birds , such as blue @-@ cheeked bee @-@ eaters in the Seychelles . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 The Mascarene martin nests in the wet season , August to November in Madagascar , and September to early January on Mauritius and Réunion . It breeds in groups typically comprising a few pairs , although a colony of about 20 pairs has been recorded on Mauritius . The nest is a shallow cup of twigs and coarse plant material such as grass and Casuarina with a softer lining of feathers and finer vegetation . It may be constructed anywhere suitably flat and inaccessible to predators , including locations 3 – 5 m ( 9 @.@ 8 – 16 @.@ 4 ft ) over water , on slate ledges , or in underground passageways ; one particularly unusual nesting site was on a small boat moored 20 m ( 66 ft ) off the coast . The normal clutch is two eggs on Madagascar and Mauritius , but two or three on Réunion . The eggs are white with brown spots and average 21 @.@ 6 mm × 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 85 in × 0 @.@ 59 in ) with a weight of 2 @.@ 5 g ( 0 @.@ 088 oz ) and are incubated by the female alone . The incubation and fledging times are unknown , although as with all hirundines the chicks are altricial , hatching naked and blind . The male helps to feed the young , and the chicks are fed by the parents after fledging , and one pair on Mauritius was observed to feed its two chicks at roughly five @-@ minute intervals . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The martins feed in flight , often low over the ground or vegetation . They hunt singly , in small groups or with other swallows and swifts , and are most active just before dusk . The flying insects that make up their diet include scarab , click and other beetles , bugs and flying ants . The feeding habitat in Madagascar includes woodlands , agricultural land , wetlands , semi desert and open ground at altitudes up to 2 @,@ 200 m ( 7 @,@ 200 ft ) . In Mauritius and Réunion this martin feeds from sea level up to 1 @,@ 500 m ( 4 @,@ 900 ft ) over reservoirs and coasts , along cliffs and over Casuarina or other trees and scrubs , and in eastern Africa , areas deforested by logging or conversion to agriculture are used for hunting . 
 = = Predators and parasites = = 
 Mascarene martins will mob the Mauritius kestrel , suggesting that it is perceived as a potential predator . Martins on Mauritius may be infected by an endemic trypanosome , Trypanosoma <unk> , although the pathogenicity is unknown . Protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus have also been found in the martin on Mauritius , although no blood parasites were found in a Madagascan specimen . A new species of louse fly , Ornithomya <unk> , was first found on a martin in Madagascar , and another bird from that island carried the feather mite <unk> hirsutus , more commonly found in parrots . 
 = = Status = = 
 The breeding range of the Mascarene martin is restricted to three islands . Madagascar has an area of 592 @,@ 800 square kilometres ( 228 @,@ 900 sq mi ) , but the next largest island , Réunion , is just 2 @,@ 512 square kilometres ( 970 sq mi ) . Although this bird has a limited range , it is abundant on Mauritius and Réunion , and locally common in Madagascar . The population size is unknown , but exceeds the vulnerability threshold of 10 @,@ 000 mature individuals and is believed to be stable . This martin is therefore classed as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature . 
 Tropical cyclones present a natural threat , particularly on the small islands inhabited by the nominate subspecies . The populations on Mauritius and Réunion were badly affected by a cyclone in February 1861 , and a British ornithologist , Edward Newton , claimed not to have seen a single specimen on Mauritius between the six @-@ day storm and June of the following year . It took many years for this population to fully recover , but by about 1900 it was reported to be common but local , and in 1973 – 74 there were 200 – 400 pairs on Réunion and 70 – 75 pairs in Mauritius . More recent cyclones , like one in 1980 , seem to have had less damaging effects than the 1861 storm . A number of species in the region are vulnerable partly because they are restricted to one island , or are badly affected by habitat degradation or introduced predators , and several species have been lost from the Mascarene islands since human colonisation in the seventeenth century . The martin and the Mascarene <unk> occur on all the main islands , and are less vulnerable to the effects of human activities , especially since they can utilise houses for nest sites . 
 In Mauritius , the Mascarene martin is legally protected as a " species of wildlife in respect of which more severe penalties are provided " . It is illegal to kill any bird of the species or to take or destroy their nests under section 16 of the Wildlife and National Parks Act 1993 @.@ although Madagascar and the African mainland countries have no special measures beyond general bird protection legislation . Réunion is an overseas department of France , but the Birds Directive does not apply outside Europe , so there is no European @-@ level bird protection legislation effective on the island , despite the possibility that European Union agricultural and other funding may be adversely affecting birds and vulnerable habitats . 
 = Operation Sky Monitor = 
 Operation Sky Monitor was a NATO mission to monitor unauthorized flights in the airspace of Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina during the Bosnian War . The operation began in response to United Nations Security Council Resolution 781 , which established a ban on the use of military aircraft in Bosnian airspace , and requested the aid of member states in monitoring compliance . Beginning on October 16 , 1992 , NATO monitored violations of the no @-@ fly zone using E @-@ 3 Sentry <unk> aircraft based in Germany , Italy , Greece , and the United Kingdom . The operation documented more than 500 violations of the no @-@ fly zone by April 1993 . In response to this high volume of unauthorized flights , the Security Council passed Resolution 816 , which authorized NATO to enforce the no @-@ fly zone , and engage violators . In response , NATO deactivated Sky Monitor on April 12 , 1993 , transferring its forces to the newly established Operation Deny Flight . 
 = = Background = = 
 On September 25 , 1991 , at the beginning of the Yugoslav wars , the United Nations Security Council issued Resolution 713 , which established " a general and complete embargo on all deliveries of weapons and military equipment to Yugoslavia " , with the goal of reducing violence and bloodshed throughout the country . In May , the Security Council reaffirmed the embargo in Resolution 757 , and added a provision for a naval force to monitor compliance with the embargo . In resolution 757 , the Council also called on states to " deny permission to any aircraft to take off , land in or overfly their territory if it is destined to land in or had taken off from the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia " , setting the precedent for later anti @-@ air measures . 
 In response to resolution 757 , NATO began to perform its first operations on behalf of the United Nations on July 16 , 1992 with Operation Maritime Monitor , which monitored violations of Security Council Resolutions by ships . As a part of Maritime Monitor , NATO dispatched E @-@ 3 Sentry airborne early warning aircraft to the region to monitor sea traffic . These aircraft flew more than 200 missions over the course of the operation . 
 On October 9 , 1992 , the Security Council passed resolution 781 . In the resolution , the Security Council expressed concern about the use of aircraft by the belligerents in the War in Bosnia and established a formal " ban on military flights in the airspace of Bosnia and Herzegovina " . It also called upon member states to help the United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) in monitoring " compliance with the ban on military flights " . Shortly thereafter , on October 15 , NATO aircraft operating under Maritime Monitor began monitoring flights over Bosnia for the UN . The essential goal of this mission was to conduct surveillance in order to determine whether or not the various parties in the conflict were respecting the UN no @-@ fly zone . The next day , October 16 , Operation Sky Monitor officially began when NATO planes expanded their monitoring with flight paths over the Adriatic . 
 = = Operation = = 
 During Operation Sky Monitor , aircraft operated in two " orbits " , one over the Adriatic established on October 16 , and a second one over Hungary , established with the permission of the Hungarian government on October 31 . Both of these orbits operated 24 hours a day , providing constant surveillance of Bosnian airspace . The first flight over Hungary on October 31 was an important milestone in NATO history as it was the " first operational mission in a former Warsaw Pact nation " for the alliance . Even more significantly , Hungary agreed that if a NATO aircraft were attacked in its airspace , the Hungarian Air Force would provide support with Mikoyan @-@ Gurevich MiG @-@ 21 fighters . This support never became necessary , but it marked another important milestone , actual military cooperation between NATO and the former Warsaw Pact . 
 The monitoring aircraft of Sky Monitor were initially drawn from the NATO Airborne Early Warning squadron based at NATO Air Base Geilenkirchen in Germany , but <unk> Air Base in Italy , Preveza in Greece , and Trapani in Italy were all used as forward operating bases . As the operation expanded , the British No. 8 Squadron RAF and the French E @-@ 3F squadron at <unk> Air Base were also used . All of these NATO forces fell under the authority of Allied Forces Southern Europe , commanded by Admiral Jeremy Boorda of the United States Navy . Eleven NATO countries provided personnel or aircraft for the operation : Belgium , Canada , Denmark , Germany , Greece , Italy , the Netherlands , Norway , Portugal , Turkey , and the United States . 
 The rules of engagement for Sky Monitor were very restrictive . Because the purpose of the operation was to monitor , rather than prevent , unauthorized flights , participating aircraft were only authorized to use force in self @-@ defense . Furthermore , under the rules of engagement , NATO forces were directed to take evasive action if attacked rather than engage an opponent if at all possible . As a result of the strict rules of engagement , no NATO forces were engaged in combat during Operation Sky Monitor . 
 Sky Monitor documented many violations of the no @-@ fly zone , the most significant of which came in March 1993 , when Serb aircraft bombed two Muslim villages . This violation , the first " combat violation " of the no @-@ fly zone , led to calls for NATO to actively enforce the zone , rather than just monitoring compliance . 
 = = Results = = 
 At the beginning of April 1993 , NATO had documented more than 500 violations of the no @-@ fly zone over Bosnia , including violations from all sides in the conflict . Out of these numerous violations , however , NATO documented only one that it considered a " combat mission " . Although most of the violations were not combat missions , NATO had decided even before the end of Sky Monitor that the UN ban was ineffective . On December 18 , 1992 , the NATO members voted to enforce the no @-@ fly zone with military force if requested by the United Nations . This escalation of NATO involvement also gained the crucial backing of US President @-@ elect Bill Clinton in December , when he told the press that he had " been in favor of enforcing the no @-@ fly zone for some time . " 
 The UN called for NATO to use force in response to the " blatant violations of the ban on military flights in the airspace of Bosnia and Herzegovina " with Security Council Resolution 816 on March 31 , 1993 . The resolution authorized UN member states to " take all necessary measures " in order " to ensure compliance " with the no @-@ fly zone . As a result of this new resolution , NATO deactivated Sky Monitor , and began Operation Deny Flight on April 12 , 1993 . Under Deny Flight , NATO forces continued to monitor and document unauthorized flights , but they were also authorized to enforce the zone and engage violators if necessary . 
 Operation Sky Monitor was the first of many NATO air operations in the Balkans , including the more significant Operation Deliberate Force and Operation Allied Force . Sky Monitor was also NATO 's first out of area air operation , and one of its first collaborative missions with the United Nations . Thus , it set the precedent for future NATO @-@ UN cooperation , based on a model where NATO forces would use their superior technical expertise to assist the UN in pursuing its broader mission . Sky Monitor also affected military policy , as it proved the utility of the E @-@ 3 Sentry , NATO 's principal aircraft in the operation , for monitoring missions under a wide variety of circumstances . Thus , the E @-@ 3 became an important part of NATO 's planning for later operations . 
 = Mikoyan @-@ Gurevich MiG @-@ 3 = 
 The Mikoyan @-@ Gurevich MiG @-@ 3 ( Russian : Микоян и Гуревич МиГ @-@ 3 ) was a Soviet interceptor and fighter aircraft used during World War II . It was a development of the MiG @-@ 1 by the OKO ( <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> — Experimental Design Department ) of Zavod ( Factory ) No. 1 to remedy problems that had been found during the MiG @-@ 1 's development and operations . It replaced the MiG @-@ 1 on the production line at Factory No. 1 on 20 December 1940 and was built in large numbers during 1941 before Factory No. 1 was converted to build the Ilyushin Il @-@ 2 . 
 On 22 June 1941 at the beginning of Operation Barbarossa , some 981 were in service with the VVS ( the Soviet Air Force ) , the PVO ( Soviet territorial air defense organization ) and Naval Aviation . The MiG @-@ 3 was difficult to fly in peacetime and much more so in combat . It had been designed for high @-@ altitude combat but combat over the Eastern Front was generally at lower altitudes where it was inferior to the German Messerschmitt Bf 109 as well as most modern Soviet fighters . It was also pressed into service as a fighter @-@ bomber during the autumn of 1941 but it was equally unsuited for this . Over time the survivors were concentrated in the PVO , where its disadvantages mattered less , the last being withdrawn from service before the end of the war . 
 = = Development = = 
 The large number of defects noted during flight testing of the MiG @-@ 1 forced Mikoyan and Gurevich to make a number of modifications to the design . Testing was done on a full @-@ size aircraft in the T @-@ 1 wind tunnel belonging to the Central Aero and Hydrodynamics Institute ( TsAGI ) to evaluate the problems and their proposed solutions . The first aircraft to see all of these changes applied was the fourth prototype of the I @-@ 200 . It first flew on 29 October 1940 and was approved for production after passing its State acceptance trials . The first MiG @-@ 3 as the improved aircraft was named on 9 December , was completed on 20 December 1940 and another 20 were delivered by the end of the year . 
 These changes included : 
 The engine was moved forward 100 mm ( 4 in ) to improve longitudinal stability . 
 A new water radiator ( OP @-@ 310 ) was fitted 
 The first two modifications allowed an additional 250 litres ( 66 US gal ) fuel tank to be fitted underneath the pilot 's seat . 
 The outer wing panel dihedral was increased by one degree to increase lateral stability . 
 An additional oil tank was mounted under the engine . 
 Piping was fitted to use cooled inert exhaust gasses in the fuel tanks to reduce the chance of fire . 
 The back of the pilot 's seat was armored with a 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) plate ( increased to 9 mm ( 0 @.@ 35 in ) in later models ) . 
 The supercharger intakes were streamlined . 
 The main landing gear was strengthened and the size of the main wheels was increased to 650 x 200 mm ( 25 @.@ 5 x 7 @.@ 87 in ) . 
 The canopy glazing was extended aft to improve the view to the rear which allowed for the installation of a shelf behind the pilot for an RSI @-@ 1 radio ( later upgraded to an RSI @-@ 4 ) . 
 The instrument panel layout was improved and a PBP @-@ 1A gunsight replaced the original PBP @-@ 1 . 
 Ammunition for the ShKAS guns was increased to 750 rounds per gun . 
 Two additional underwing hardpoints were added to carry up to 220 kg ( 485 lb ) of bombs , spray containers or RS @-@ 82 rockets . 
 State acceptance testing of two production aircraft was conducted between 27 January and 26 February 1941 . They were found to be over 250 kg ( 550 lb ) heavier than the MiG @-@ 1 , which reduced maneuverability and field performance . Time to 5 @,@ 000 m ( 16 @,@ 000 ft ) decreased by over a minute and the service ceiling proved to be 500 m ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) less . The MiG @-@ 3 was faster at sea level and at altitude . While the ranges reached by both aircraft were farther than that of the older aircraft , they were still less than the 1 @,@ 000 km ( 620 mi ) required . Mikoyan and Gurevich protested against the range results as their calculations showed that the MiG @-@ 3 could reach 1 @,@ 010 km ( 630 mi ) based on a specific fuel consumption ( SFC ) of 0 @.@ 46 kg / km ( 1 @.@ 64 lb / mile ) . During the State acceptance trials the SFC was 0 @.@ 48 kg / km ( 1 @.@ 71 lb / mile ) but the operational trials conducted earlier showed a SFC of 0 @.@ 38 kg / km ( 1 @.@ 35 lb / mile ) . They blamed the deficiency on a failure to use an altitude correction and that the engines had not been properly adjusted . They went as far as arranging for two more flights between Leningrad and Moscow to prove the MiG @-@ 3 could fly 1 @,@ 000 km ( 621 mi ) . Two production aircraft were flown to ranges of 1 @,@ 100 km ( 680 mi ) and 971 km ( 603 mi ) , flying at 90 % of maximum speed and at an altitude of 7 @,@ 300 m ( 24 @,@ 000 ft ) , contradicting the report of the NII VVS ( Naoochno @-@ Issledovatel 'skiy Institoot Voyenno @-@ Vozdooshnykh Seel — Air Force Scientific Test Institute ) . 
 Despite the teething problems with the MiG @-@ 3 , in 1941 , one of the aircraft 's designers — Mikhail Gurevich — was awarded the State Stalin Prize for his contribution to Soviet aviation . 
 A number of reports had been received about poor quality aircraft received by the regiments which pointed directly at the NII VVS as it was responsible for monitoring the quality of the aircraft delivered to the VVS . On 31 May 1941 the People 's Commissariat of Defense decreed that the NII VVS had been negligent . A number of senior managers were demoted and the head of the Institute , Major General A. I. <unk> was summarily executed . 
 A number of MiG @-@ 3s were found to have unacceptable performance at high altitudes despite being designed as a high @-@ altitude interceptor . The oxygen supply was often insufficient and the stall and spin characteristics were very dangerous , especially to inexperienced pilots . This was demonstrated on 10 April 1941 when three pilots of the 31st Fighter Regiment of the Air Defenses ( IAP PVO ) attempted to intercept a German high @-@ altitude reconnaissance aircraft over Kaunas , Lithuania flying at 9 @,@ 000 m ( 30 @,@ 000 ft ) . All three aircraft entered irrecoverable spins and the pilots were forced to bail out , one being killed . The NII VVS sent an engineer to investigate and he found that the pilots had flown very few hours on the MiG @-@ 3 and that that was their first high @-@ altitude sortie . Other problems included insufficient fuel and oil pressure at altitude due to problems with the pumps . 
 = = = Comparison to other fighters = = = 
 The MiG @-@ 3 's top speed of 640 km / h ( 398 mph ) at 7 @,@ 200 metres ( 23 @,@ 622 ft ) was faster than the 615 km / h ( 382 mph ) of the German Messerschmitt Bf 109F @-@ 2 in service at the beginning of 1941 and the British Supermarine Spitfire V 's 603 km / h ( 375 mph ) . At lower altitudes the MiG 's speed advantage disappeared as its maximum speed at sea level was only 505 km / h ( 314 mph ) while the Bf 109F @-@ 2 could do 515 km / h ( 320 mph ) . Unfortunately for the MiG @-@ 3 and its pilots , aerial combat over the Eastern Front generally took place at low and medium altitudes where it had no speed advantage . 
 The MiG 's loaded weight of 3 @,@ 350 kg ( 7 @,@ 385 lb ) was greater than the Bf 109F @-@ 2 's 2 @,@ 728 kg ( 6 @,@ 014 lb ) and it was less maneuverable in the horizontal plane than the Bf 109 due to its higher wing loading . This lack of maneuverability was exacerbated by the MiG @-@ 3 's poor climb performance , its instability at high speeds ( which can make aerial gunnery difficult due to the point of aim " wandering " and requiring constant pilot input to remain in target ) , and its underpowered armament . 
 The MiG @-@ 3 's standard armament was one 12 @.@ 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 50 in ) UBS machine gun and two 7 @.@ 62 mm ( 0 @.@ 30 in ) ShKAS machine guns , all mounted in the engine cowling and synchronized to fire through the propeller arc . In contrast , most versions of the German Messerschmitt Bf 109 that it encountered had one 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) cannon and two 7 @.@ 92 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine guns ( although the Bf 109F used during Operation Barbarossa had the 15mm MG 151 / 20 , meaning it was armed little better than the MiG ) . To remedy this problem , 821 aircraft were built with one 12 @.@ 7 mm UBK machine gun in a pod under each wing in mid @-@ 1941 . This lowered its speed by about 20 km / h ( 12 mph ) at all altitudes , which was unpopular with the pilots , some of whom removed the pods . One hundred aircraft were equipped with a pair of UBS machine guns in lieu of the ShKAS weapons . Another 215 aircraft also had just the UBS machine guns but were fitted to carry six RS @-@ 82 rockets . A total of 72 aircraft mounted a pair of 20 mm ShVAK cannon . A wide variety of armaments were experimented with by various units at the requests of their pilots or to make up shortages .

 The NKAP ( Narodnyy komissariat <unk> <unk> — People 's Ministry of the Aircraft Industry ) announced its 1941 production plan on 9 December 1940 . Zavod Nr. 1 would be required to build a total of 3 @,@ 500 in 1941 . Zavod Nr. 43 in Kiev would begin construction of the MiG @-@ 3 and complete one hundred aircraft by the end of the year and Zavod Nr. 21 in Gor <unk> would start to plan construction of an upgraded version of the MiG @-@ 3 , although this last program was canceled shortly afterwards . 140 were delivered in January 1941 and Zavod Nr. 1 was on pace to exceed its quota with 496 delivered in July , 562 in August and 450 in September . In October the German advance on Moscow forced the factory , and its OKO , to evacuate to Kuybyshev where production resumed under unsuitable conditions . However , shortly afterwards , Stalin sent a telegram to the directors of the plants building the Ilyushin Il @-@ 2 and the MiG @-@ 3 demanding more Il @-@ 2 production , resulting in MiG @-@ 3 production being terminated in favor of the Il @-@ 2 , with a final thirty aircraft built in 1942 from spares . An additional factor in cancellation of the MiG @-@ 3 was that its Mikulin AM @-@ 35A engine was closely related to the Il @-@ 2 's AM @-@ 38 allowing production to be quickly switched from one to the other . 
 MiG @-@ 3 production at Zavod Nr. 1 had already been planned to be reduced from a NKAP order of 27 August that required the factory to produce 420 fighters in September , declining to 100 in December with Il @-@ 2 production ramping up to 250 in December while the former aircraft repair plant at Khodynka Aerodrome was to be transferred to the NKAP , redesignated as Zavod Nr. 165 , and begin production of MiG @-@ 3s . The German advance disrupted these plans for Zavod 165 and it never produced a single MiG @-@ 3 . 
 = = Operational history = = 
 MiG @-@ 3s were delivered to front @-@ line fighter regiments beginning in the spring of 1941 and were a handful for pilots accustomed to the lower @-@ performance and docile Polikarpov I @-@ 152 and I @-@ 153 biplanes and the Polikarpov I @-@ 16 monoplane . It remained tricky and demanding to fly even after the extensive improvements made over the MiG @-@ 1 . Many fighter regiments had not kept pace in training pilots to handle the MiG and the rapid pace of deliveries resulted in many units having more MiGs than trained pilots during the German invasion . By 1 June 1941 , 1 @,@ 029 MIG @-@ 3s were on strength , but there were only 494 trained pilots . In contrast to the untrained pilots of the 31st Fighter Regiment those of the 4th Fighter Regiment were able to claim three German high @-@ altitude reconnaissance aircraft shot down before war broke out in June 1941 . However high @-@ altitude combat of this sort was to prove to be uncommon on the Eastern Front where most air @-@ to @-@ air engagements were at altitudes well below 5 @,@ 000 metres ( 16 @,@ 000 ft ) . At these altitudes the MiG @-@ 3 was outclassed by the Bf 109 in all respects , and even by other new Soviet fighters like the Yakovlev Yak @-@ 1 . Furthermore , the shortage of ground @-@ attack aircraft in 1941 forced it into that role as well , for which it was totally unsuited . Pilot Alexander E. <unk> recalled : " The <unk> was perfect at altitudes of 4 @,@ 000 m and above . But at lower altitudes it was , as they say , ' a cow ' . That was the first weakness . The second was its armament : weapons failure dogged this aircraft . The third weakness was its gunsights , which were inaccurate : that 's why we closed in as much as we could and fired point blank . " 
 On 22 June 1941 , most MiG @-@ 3s and MiG @-@ 1s were in the border military districts of the Soviet Union . The Leningrad Military District had 164 , 135 were in the Baltic Military District , 233 in the Western Special Military District , 190 in the Kiev Military District and 195 in the Odessa Military District for a total of 917 on hand , of which only 81 were non @-@ operational . An additional 64 MiGs were assigned to Naval Aviation , 38 in the Air Force of the Baltic Fleet and 26 in the Air Force of the Black Sea Fleet . 
 The 4th and 55th Fighter Regiments had most of the MiG @-@ 3s assigned to the Odessa Military District and their experiences on the first day of the war may be taken as typical . The 4th , an experienced unit , shot down a Romanian Bristol Blenheim reconnaissance bomber , confirmed by post @-@ war research , and lost one aircraft which crashed into an obstacle on take @-@ off . The 55th was much less experienced with the MiG @-@ 3 and claimed three aircraft shot down , although recent research confirms only one German Henschel Hs 126 was 40 % damaged , and suffered three pilots killed and nine aircraft lost . The most unusual case was the pair of MiG @-@ 3s dispatched from the 55th on a reconnaissance mission to Ploieşti that failed to properly calculate their fuel consumption and both were forced to land when they ran out of fuel . 
 Most of the MiG @-@ 3s assigned to the interior military districts were transferred to the PVO where their lack of performance at low altitudes was not so important . On 10 July 299 were assigned to the PVO , the bulk of them belonging to the 6th PVO Corps at Moscow , while only 293 remained with the VVS , and 60 with the Naval Air Forces , a total of only 652 despite deliveries of several hundred aircraft . By 1 October , on the eve of the German offensive towards Moscow codenamed Operation Typhoon , only 257 were assigned to VVS units , 209 to the PVO , and 46 to the Navy , a total of only 512 , a decrease of 140 fighters since 10 July , despite deliveries of over a thousand aircraft in the intervening period . By 5 December , the start of the Soviet counter @-@ offensive that drove the Germans back from the gates of Moscow , the Navy had 33 MiGs on hand , the VVS 210 , and the PVO 309 . This was a total of 552 , an increase of only 40 aircraft from 1 October . 
 Over the winter of 1941 – 42 the Soviets transferred all of the remaining MiG @-@ 3s to the Navy and PVO so that on 1 May 1942 none were left on strength with the VVS . By 1 May 1942 , Naval Aviation had 37 MiGs on strength , while the PVO had 323 on hand on 10 May . By 1 June 1944 , the Navy had transferred all its aircraft to the PVO , which reported only 17 on its own strength , and all of those were gone by 1 January 1945 . Undoubtedly more remained in training units and the like , but none were assigned to combat units by then . 
 Even with the MiG @-@ 3 's limitations , Aleksandr <unk> , the third @-@ leading Soviet , and Allied , ace of the war , with 53 official air victories ( plus six shared ) , recorded a number of those victories while flying a MiG @-@ 3 at the beginning of the war . He later recalled : 
 “ Its designers rarely succeeded in matching both the fighter 's flight characteristics with its firepower … the operational advantage of the MiG @-@ 3 seemed to be obscured by its certain defects . However , these advantages could undoubtedly be exploited by a pilot able to discover them ” . 
 = = Variants = = 
 There were several attempts to re @-@ engine the aircraft with the engine it was originally designed for , the Mikulin AM @-@ 37 . This was designated the MiG @-@ 7 , and one MiG @-@ 3 was converted to evaluate the engine in May 1941 . It proved to have poor longitudinal stability and the powerplant itself still had a number of problems . The German invasion the following month caused the cancellation of the development of the AM @-@ 37 as Mikulin 's resources were required for the AM @-@ 35 and AM @-@ 38 engines already in production . 
 To improve the low @-@ level performance of the MiG @-@ 3 , one aircraft was tested with the AM @-@ 38 engine used by the Il @-@ 2 in July 1941 . It proved to be 14 km / h ( 8 @.@ 7 mph ) faster than the normal MiG @-@ 3 at sea level and was more maneuverable as well . It was recommended for production after passing its State acceptance trials in September , provided that a cure for the engine 's tendency to overheat in ambient temperatures above 16 ° C ( 61 ° F ) was found . However the sole prototype was shot down on 5 October during flight tests and it was decided not to proceed with the idea as all AM @-@ 38 production was allocated to the Il @-@ 2 . Ironically , later in the war , about 80 MiG @-@ 3s were <unk> with AM @-@ 38s to make them airworthy again . Many of these were rearmed with two 20 mm ShVAK cannon as well . 
 On 13 May 1941 the NKAP ordered the OKO to convert a MiG @-@ 3 to use the Shvetsov ASh @-@ 82A radial engine then entering production . The resulting aircraft had a variety of names , including I @-@ 210 , MiG @-@ 3 @-@ 82 , <unk> <unk> or Izdeliye 65 . The design was a failure , but was promising enough to continue the program as the I @-@ 211 . 
 A variety of other tests and other projects were conducted using MiG @-@ 3s . Leading edge slats were evaluated in 1941 although they were not fitted on production aircraft , but were used by the I @-@ 210 . A 6 @-@ bladed propeller was fitted on one aircraft to increase thrust at high @-@ altitude to enable the fighter to catch the high @-@ flying Junkers Ju <unk> aircraft then overflying Moscow . A new propeller hub was made that mounted six standard VISh @-@ 61 blades , but nothing more is known of the project . Four aircraft were converted to carry AFA @-@ I cameras for evaluation and a fifth was then converted to evaluate all the improvements learned from the first four . It was approved for use after trials at the NII VVS . To improve their service ceiling two aircraft were lightened down to a weight of 3 @,@ 098 kg ( 6 @,@ 830 lb ) , but no further details are known other than one reached a height of 11 @,@ 750 metres ( 38 @,@ 550 ft ) . 
 There was also a proposal in 1941 to use the MiG @-@ 3 as part of a Zveno combination with a Petlyakov Pe @-@ 8 mother ship . The four @-@ engined bomber would carry two MiG @-@ <unk> ( <unk> <unk> <unk> — Fast Dive Bomber ) fighters , modified to carry a 250 kg ( 550 lb ) FAB @-@ 250 bomb under each wing , close to the target and would then release them to conduct the attack after which they would fly back to the nearest friendly airbase . Some preliminary work was done before the Germans invaded , but it was abandoned afterwards due to the pressure of other work . The combination was estimated to have a maximum speed of 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) and a range of 1 @,@ 450 km ( 900 mi ) .

 " One Wonderful Day " was directed by Larry Shaw and written by John Pardee , Joey Murphy , series creator Marc Cherry , Tom Spezialy , and Kevin Murphy . It was filmed in April 2005 . The writers were still working on the script when filming began ; as a result , the ending narration was written based on the visuals that had been filmed . The episode focused largely on the conclusion of the Mary Alice mystery storyline . Cherry had wanted there to be a " definite end " to the mystery , hoping to avoid similar viewer fatigue that Twin Peaks suffered after drawing out its central mystery past its first season . The storyline relied on two flashback sequences , which featured Jolie Jenkins as Dierdre Taylor . Though " One Wonderful Day " was her first on @-@ screen appearance in the series , Jenkins was cast in the role in the fall of 2004 , as scenes earlier in the season required photographs of the Dierdre character . Because no material had been written for the character at the time , Jenkins did not have to audition for the role . ABC executives initially protested the writers ' decision to have Mary Alice purposefully kill Dierdre , prompting the writers to make Dierdre violent in order to justify Mary Alice 's actions . The writers struggled with whether or not to include a gunshot at the end of the episode when Mike returns to his house where Zach is holding Susan hostage . Ultimately , Spezialy convinced the other writers not to include it . 
 " One Wonderful Day " also introduced the second @-@ season mystery surrounding Betty Applewhite ( Alfre Woodard ) and Matthew Applewhite ( Mehcad Brooks ) . Cherry revealed , " they come on the street ; they seem like nice people — but they 've got a secret . And it 's pretty gothic . It 's real and human and awful all at the same time . " Another scene featuring the Applewhite family , in which Betty brings food to a prisoner in their basement , was cut from this episode but was used in the second season premiere , " Next " . Cherry 's inspiration for the Lynette storyline came from his own childhood experience when his mother returned to work . He commented : " The predicament of any working woman is that you can love your career , but there is something ... to be said for getting to stay home every day with your kids , and you don 't want anyone else to be better at it than you are . Felicity Huffman expressed satisfaction with how her storyline was handled , explaining that Lynette " didn 't deal with [ Tom 's potential promotion ] in the most straightforward way , but she was fighting for her family . They were noble motives . " While discussing the courtroom scene in which Carlos attacks John , Ricardo Antonio Chavira commented : " People can see the full rage that is in my character . I 'm yelling at him , ' I 'm gonna kill you ' ... Then I broke into Spanish : " Yo <unk> a <unk> ! " ... I just went for it ... Then I looked , and Jesse [ Metcalfe ] had the most honest look of sheer terror . I think I scared the living shit out of him . " 
 The scene in which Susan , Lynette , and Gabrielle comfort Bree at the hospital was the last scene of the season involving the four principal characters . Teri Hatcher commented : " It was a heavy scene . There was a very genuine and deeply felt recognition that all four of us together as a team appreciated the ride we 'd had this season and were grateful that we 'd survived it together . " An extension of the scene , in which the women discuss Susan 's discovery of Martha Huber 's journal , was cut for time , though it was aired on Good Morning America on May 23 , 2005 , one day after the episode 's broadcast , and was included on the first season DVD set . The death of one housewife 's husband was confirmed prior to the episode 's broadcast . Steven Culp was not surprised when his character was killed off , stating " I had a sneaking suspicion someone was going to go . " Producer and writer Kevin Murphy explained the reasoning for killing off the Rex character : " As we neared the end of season 1 , our plan was that each woman would enter a new life chapter . Gabrielle would learn to function without Carlos , Susan and Mike would build their relationship , Lynette would go back to work , and Bree would become a single woman . We either had to have Rex divorce her or die . " Cherry named the scene in which Bree finishes her spring cleaning before mourning the death of her husband as one of his top three favorites of the season , stating : " It was one of the favorite things I wrote because it was so true to her character . She had to finish the cleaning she started , and she comes in and everything ’ s perfect . " A scene between Gabrielle and John was also cut for time .

 Entertainment Weekly 's Dalton Ross named the episode as one of the season 's best , commending the fact that " most of the main questions were actually answered , " unlike the season finale of Lost . He praised the Bree storyline as well as the conclusion to the Mary Alice mystery , calling it " both shocking and satisfying . " Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC also compared the episode to the Lost season finale , writing : " ' Desperate Housewives ' is willing to answer some of its mysterious questions and give readers a little bit of closure . ' Lost , ' heading into its own two @-@ hour finale this Wednesday , is still dangling a dozen carrots in front of impatient viewers . " Cooper felt that the episode was a satisfying conclusion to the season opining that " by allowing some of its plots to remain tantalizing mysteries , yet offering up the satisfaction of explaining others , ' Desperate Housewives ' has smartly set things up for its audience to return for its new season next fall . " Frazier Moore of USA Today called the finale " a smashing close " to the first season . Moore expressed interest in how the cliffhangers would be resolved , as well as in the Betty Applewhite character . He also theorized that Rex 's death was a ruse , writing : " Reminder : The audience saw no death scene and no body . When has Desperate Housewives exercised restraint without an ulterior motive ? " 
 Ann Hodgman of Entertainment Weekly was negative in her review and dismissed the episode for feeling " like a <unk> of warmed @-@ up leftovers . " Hodgman criticized the writers ' decision to devoting too much of the episode to the Mary Alice storyline rather than focusing on the other characters . She wrote that Rex 's death did not come as a surprise , noting : " Just as a TV or movie cop is inevitably shot after he announces that he 's about to retire , we know it 's over for Rex the minute Bree rests her head on his feeble chest and promises him he 'll make it . " Hodgman stated that her interest in the Gabrielle and Carlos storyline was ruined by John telling Carlos about the affair rather than Carlos discovering it himself . She also declared that the Lynette storyline was " wrapped up almost as perfunctorily , or maybe it only seems that way because it 's long been so obvious that they were heading toward one of those folktales where the husband and wife switch places . " Hodgman concluded by saying the fates of Susan and Mike are predictable , as the characters are too important to be killed off . In 2009 , TV Guide ranked the episode # 55 on its list of " 100 Greatest Episodes of All @-@ Time " . The Futon Critic ranked the episode as the 19th best television episode of 2005 , calling it " note @-@ perfect . " 
 = Brian Josephson = 
 Brian David Josephson , FRS ( born 4 January 1940 ) , is a Welsh theoretical physicist and professor emeritus of physics at the University of Cambridge . Best known for his pioneering work on superconductivity and quantum tunnelling , he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1973 for his prediction of the Josephson effect , made in 1962 when he was a 22 @-@ year @-@ old PhD student at Cambridge . Josephson is the only Welshman to have won a Nobel Prize in Physics . He shared the prize with physicists Leo Esaki and Ivar <unk> , who jointly received half the award for their own work on quantum tunnelling . 
 Josephson has spent his academic career as a member of the Theory of Condensed Matter group at Cambridge 's Cavendish Laboratory . He has been a fellow of Trinity College , Cambridge since 1962 , and served as professor of physics from 1974 until 2007 . 
 In the early 1970s Josephson took up transcendental meditation and turned his attention to issues outside the parameters of mainstream science . He set up the Mind – Matter Unification Project at the Cavendish to explore the idea of intelligence in nature , the relationship between quantum mechanics and consciousness , and the synthesis of science and Eastern mysticism , broadly known as quantum mysticism . Those interests have led him to express support for topics such as parapsychology , water memory and cold fusion , and have made him a focus of criticism from fellow scientists . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 = = = Education = = = 
 Josephson was born in Cardiff , Wales , to Jewish parents , Mimi ( née Weisbard , 1911 – 1998 ) and Abraham Josephson . He attended Cardiff High School , where he credits some of the school masters for having helped him , particularly the physics master , Emrys Jones , who introduced him to theoretical physics . In 1957 he went up to Cambridge , where he read mathematics at Trinity College , Cambridge . After completing Maths Part II in two years , and finding it somewhat sterile , he decided to switch to physics . 
 Josephson was known at Cambridge as a brilliant , but shy , student . Physicist John <unk> recalled overhearing Nicholas Kurti , an examiner from Oxford , discuss Josephson 's exam results with David <unk> , then reader in physics at Cambridge , and asking : " Who is this chap Josephson ? He seems to be going through the theory like a knife through butter . " While still an undergraduate , he published a paper on the Mössbauer effect , pointing out a crucial issue other researchers had overlooked . According to one eminent physicist speaking to Physics World , Josephson wrote several papers important enough to assure him a place in the history of physics even without his discovery of the Josephson effect . 
 He graduated in 1960 and became a research student in the university 's Mond Laboratory on the old Cavendish site , where he was supervised by Brian Pippard . American physicist Philip Anderson , also a future Nobel Prize laureate , spent a year in Cambridge in 1961 – 1962 , and recalled that having Josephson in a class was " a disconcerting experience for a lecturer , I can assure you , because everything had to be right or he would come up and explain it to me after class . " It was during this period , as a PhD student in 1962 , that he carried out the research that led to his discovery of the Josephson effect ; Cambridge unveiled a plaque on the Mond Building dedicated to the discovery in November 2012 . He was elected a fellow of Trinity College in 1962 , and obtained his PhD in 1964 for a thesis entitled Non @-@ linear conduction in superconductors . 
 = = = Discovery of the Josephson effect = = = 
 Josephson was 22 years old when he did the work on quantum tunnelling that won him the Nobel Prize . He discovered that a <unk> could tunnel through a thin barrier , predicting , according to physicist Andrew Whitaker , that " at a junction of two superconductors , a current will flow even if there is no drop in voltage ; that when there is a voltage drop , the current should oscillate at a frequency related to the drop in voltage ; and that there is a dependence on any magnetic field . " This became known as the Josephson effect and the junction as a Josephson junction . 
 His calculations were published in Physics Letters ( chosen by Pippard because it was a new journal ) in a paper entitled " Possible new effects in superconductive tunnelling , " received on 8 June 1962 and published on 1 July . They were confirmed experimentally by Philip Anderson and John Rowell of Bell Labs in Princeton ; this appeared in their paper , " Probable Observation of the Josephson Superconducting Tunneling Effect , " submitted to Physical Review Letters in January 1963 . 
 Before Anderson and Rowell confirmed the calculations , the American physicist John Bardeen , who had shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics ( and who shared it again in 1972 ) , objected to Josephson 's work . He submitted an article to Physical Review Letters on 25 July 1962 , arguing that " there can be no such superfluid flow . " The disagreement led to a famous confrontation in September that year at Queen Mary College , London , at the Eighth International Conference on Low Temperature Physics . When Bardeen ( then one of the most eminent physicists in the world ) began speaking , Josephson ( still a student ) stood up and interrupted him . The men exchanged views , reportedly in a civil and soft @-@ spoken manner . 
 Whitaker writes that the discovery of the Josephson effect led to " much important physics , " including the invention of <unk> ( superconducting quantum interference devices ) , which are used in geology to make highly sensitive measurements , as well as in medicine and computing . IBM used Josephson 's work in 1980 to build a prototype of a computer that would be up to 100 times faster than the IBM 3033 mainframe . 
 = = = Nobel Prize = = = 
 Josephson was awarded several important prizes for his discovery , including the 1969 Research Corporation Award for outstanding contributions to science , and the Hughes Medal and <unk> Prize in 1972 . In 1973 he won the Nobel Prize in Physics , sharing the $ 122 @,@ 000 award with two other scientists who had also worked on quantum tunnelling . Josephson was awarded half the prize " for his theoretical predictions of the properties of a <unk> through a tunnel barrier , in particular those phenomena which are generally known as the Josephson effects . " 
 The other half of the award was shared equally by Japanese physicist Leo Esaki of the Thomas Watson Research Center in Yorktown , New York , and Norwegian @-@ American physicist Ivar <unk> of General Electric in Schenectady , New York , " for their experimental discoveries regarding tunneling phenomena in semiconductors and superconductors , respectively . " Unusually , none of the winners had held professorships before being awarded the prize . 
 = = = Positions held = = = 
 Josephson spent a postdoctoral year in the United States ( 1965 – 1966 ) as research assistant professor at the University of Illinois . After returning to Cambridge , he was made assistant director of research at the Cavendish Laboratory in 1967 , where he remained a member of the Theory of Condensed Matter group , a theoretical physics group , for the rest of his career . He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society ( FRS ) in 1970 , and the same year was awarded a National Science Foundation fellowship by Cornell University , where he spent one year . In 1972 he became a reader in physics at Cambridge and in 1974 a full professor , a position he held until he retired in 2007 . 
 A practitioner of transcendental meditation ( TM ) since the early seventies , Josephson became a visiting faculty member in 1975 of the Maharishi European Research University in the Netherlands , part of the TM movement . He also held visiting professorships at Wayne State University in 1983 , the Indian Institute of Science , Bangalore in 1984 , and the University of Missouri @-@ Rolla in 1987 . 
 = = Parapsychology = = 
 = = = Early interest and transcendental meditation = = = 
 Josephson became interested in philosophy of mind in the late sixties and , in particular , in the mind – body problem , and is one of the few scientists to argue that parapsychological phenomena ( telepathy , psychokinesis and other paranormal themes ) may be real . In 1971 he began practising transcendental meditation ( TM ) , which had become popular with several celebrities , most famously the Beatles . 
 Winning the Nobel Prize in 1973 gave him the freedom to work in less orthodox areas , and he became increasingly involved – including during science conferences , to the irritation of fellow scientists – in talking about meditation , telepathy and higher states of consciousness . In 1974 he angered scientists during a colloquium of molecular and cellular biologists in Versailles by inviting them to read the Bhagavad Gita ( 5th – 2nd century BCE ) and the work of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi , the founder of the TM movement , and by arguing about special states of consciousness achieved through meditation . " Nothing forces us , " one scientist shouted at him , " to listen to your wild speculations . " <unk> Henri <unk> wrote that the session ended in uproar . 
 In May that year Josephson addressed a symposium held to welcome the Maharishi to Cambridge . The following month , at the first Canadian conference on psychokinesis , he was one of 21 scientists who tested claims by Matthew Manning , a Cambridgeshire teenager who said he had psychokinetic abilities ; Josephson apparently told a reporter that he believed Manning 's powers were a new kind of energy . He later withdrew or corrected the statement . 
 Josephson said that Trinity College 's long interest in the paranormal meant that he did not dismiss these ideas out of hand . Several presidents of the Society for Psychical Research had been fellows of Trinity , and the Perrott @-@ Warrick Fund , set up in Trinity in 1937 to fund parapsychology research , is still administered by the college . He continued to explore the idea that there is intelligence in nature , particularly after reading Fritjof Capra 's The Tao of Physics ( 1975 ) , and in 1979 took up a more advanced form of TM , known as the TM @-@ <unk> program . According to Anderson , the TM movement produced a poster showing Josephson levitating several inches above the floor . Josephson argued that meditation could lead to mystical and scientific insights , and that , as a result of it , he had come to believe in a creator . 
 = = = Fundamental Fysiks Group = = = 
 Josephson became involved in the mid @-@ seventies with a group of physicists associated with the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory at the University of California , Berkeley , who were investigating paranormal claims . They had organized themselves loosely into something called the Fundamental Fysiks Group , and had effectively become the Stanford Research Institute 's ( SRI ) " house theorists , " according to historian of science David Kaiser . 
 There was a lot of popular and government interest at the time in quantum mechanics – the American government was financing research at SRI into telepathy – and physicists able to understand it found themselves in demand . The Fundamental Fysiks Group used ideas from quantum physics , particularly Bell 's theorem and quantum entanglement , to explore issues such as action at a distance , clairvoyance , precognition , remote viewing and psychokinesis . 
 In 1976 Josephson travelled to California to meet two leading members of the group , laser physicists Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff , authors of Mind Reach ( 1977 ) . Targ and Puthoff had set up a parapsychology ( " psi " ) lab at SRI and had had papers published about their work – which included testing later @-@ discredited claims by Uri Geller that he could make objects move using psychokinesis – in Nature and other peer @-@ reviewed journals . The San Francisco Chronicle covered Josephson 's visit . 
 Josephson co @-@ organized a symposium on consciousness at Cambridge in 1978 , publishing the proceedings as Consciousness and the Physical World ( 1980 ) , with neuroscientist V. S. Ramachandran . A conference on " Science and Consciousness " followed a year later in Cordoba , Spain , attended by physicists and Jungian psychoanalysts , and addressed by Josephson , Fritjof Capra and David Bohm ( 1917 – 1992 ) . 
 By 1996 he had set up the Mind – Matter Unification Project at the Cavendish Laboratory to explore intelligent processes in nature . In 2002 he told Physics World : " Future science will consider quantum mechanics as the phenomenology of particular kinds of organised complex system . Quantum entanglement would be one manifestation of such organisation , paranormal phenomena another . " 
 = = = Reception and views on the scientific community = = = 
 Josephson delivered the Pollock Memorial Lecture in 2006 , the Hermann Staudinger Lecture in 2009 and the Sir Nevill Mott Lecture in 2010 . 
 Matthew Reisz wrote in Times Higher Education in 2010 that Josephson has long been one of physics ' " more colourful figures . " His support for unorthodox causes has attracted criticism from fellow scientists since the 1970s , including from Philip Anderson . Josephson regards the criticism as prejudice , and believes that it has served to deprive him of an academic support network . 
 He has repeatedly criticized " science by consensus , " arguing that the scientific community is too quick to reject certain kinds of ideas . " Anything goes among the physics community – cosmic wormholes , time travel , " he argues , " just so long as it keeps its distance from anything mystical or New Age @-@ ish . " Referring to this position as " pathological disbelief , " he holds it responsible for the rejection by academic journals of papers on the paranormal . He has compared parapsychology to the theory of continental drift , proposed in 1912 by Alfred Wegener ( 1880 – 1930 ) to explain observations that were otherwise inexplicable , which was resisted and ridiculed until evidence led to its acceptance after Wegener 's death . 
 Science writer Martin Gardner criticized Josephson in 1980 for complaining to the New York Review of Books , along with three other physicists , about an article by J. A. Wheeler that ridiculed parapsychology . Several physicists complained in 2001 when , in a Royal Mail booklet celebrating the Nobel Prize 's centenary , Josephson wrote that Britain was at the forefront of research into telepathy . Physicist David Deutsch said the Royal Mail had " let itself be hoodwinked " into supporting nonsense , although another physicist , Robert Matthews , suggested that Deutsch was skating on thin ice given the latter 's own work on parallel universes and time travel . 
 In 2004 Josephson criticized an experiment by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry to test claims by Russian schoolgirl Natasha <unk> that she could see inside people 's bodies using a special kind of vision . The experiment involved her being asked to match six people to their confirmed medical conditions ( plus one with none ) ; to pass the test she had to make five correct matches , but made only four . Josephson argued that this was statistically significant , and that the experiment had set her up to fail . One of the researchers , Richard Wiseman , professor of psychology at the University of Hertfordshire , responded that Josephson had no record of publishing on parapsychology . Keith <unk> , professor of applied statistics at the University of Greenwich , supported Josephson 's position but that the experiment was " woefully inadequate " to determine any effect . 
 Josephson 's reputation for promoting unorthodox causes was cemented by his support for the ideas of water memory and cold fusion , both of which are rejected by mainstream scientists . Water memory is purported to provide an explanation for homeopathy ; it is mostly dismissed by scientists as pseudoscience , although Josephson has expressed support for it since attending a conference at which French immunologist Jacques <unk> first proposed it . Cold fusion is the hypothesis that nuclear reactions can occur at room temperature . When Martin Fleischmann , the British chemist who pioneered research into it , died in 2012 , Josephson wrote a supportive obituary in the Guardian and complained to Nature that its obituary had failed to give Fleischmann due credit . Antony Valentini of Imperial College London withdrew Josephson 's invitation to a 2010 conference on the de Broglie @-@ Bohm theory because of his work on the paranormal , although it was reinstated after complaints .

 The Boeing Chinook is a tandem rotor helicopter operated by the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . A series of variants based on the United States Army 's Boeing CH @-@ 47 Chinook , the RAF Chinook fleet is the largest outside the United States . RAF Chinooks have seen extensive service including fighting in the Falklands War , peace @-@ keeping commitments in the Balkans , and action in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars . 
 The Chinook aircraft , normally based at RAF Odiham , provides heavy @-@ lift support and transport across all branches of the British armed forces , and is supported by the smaller , medium @-@ lift helicopters such as the AgustaWestland Merlin HC.3 of the Royal Navy 's Commando Helicopter Force and the RAF 's Westland Puma HC.2 , based at RNAS Yeovilton and RAF Benson .

 In March 1967 an order was placed for fifteen Chinook HC Mk1s , standing for Helicopter , Cargo Mark 1 , for the Royal Air Force to replace the Bristol Belvedere . This original MK1 variant was to be based on the CH @-@ 47B but the order was cancelled in a review of defence spending in November 1967 . 
 UK Chinook procurement ambitions were revived in 1978 with an announced requirement for a new heavy @-@ lift helicopter to replace the Westland Wessex . Thirty Chinooks were ordered at a price of US $ 200 million . These helicopters , comparable to the CH @-@ 47C with Lycoming T55 @-@ L @-@ 11E engines , were again designated Chinook HC Mk1 , and entered service in December 1980 . Eight more Mk1s were delivered from 1984 to 1986 with the CH @-@ 47D 's Lycoming T55 @-@ L @-@ 712 turboshafts . 
 The replacement of the Mk1 's metal rotor blades with aluminium and glass fibre composite rotor blades saw these aircraft designated Chinook HC Mk1B . All surviving aircraft were later returned to Boeing and updated to the Chinook HC Mk2 standard for further service within the RAF . 
 = = = Chinook HC Mk2 = = = 
 The US Army 's next generation Chinook , the CH @-@ 47D , entered service in 1982 . Improvements from the CH @-@ 47C included upgraded engines , composite rotor blades , a redesigned cockpit to reduce pilot workload , redundant and improved electrical systems , an advanced flight control system ( FCS ) and improved avionics . The RAF returned their original Mk1s to Boeing for upgrading to CH @-@ 47D standard , the first of which returned to the UK in 1993 . 
 Three additional HC Mk2 Chinooks were ordered with delivery beginning in 1995 . Another six were ordered in 1995 under the Chinook HC Mk2A designation ; the main difference between these and the standard Mk2 was the strengthening of the front fuselage to allow the fitting of an aerial refuelling probe in future . 
 One Argentine CH @-@ 47C was captured during the Falklands War , and used by the RAF as a training aid . The rear fuselage was later used to repair a crashed RAF Chinook in 2003 . 
 In 2006 , the retirement dates for the Mk2 and Mk2A fleets were scheduled for 2015 and 2025 respectively , but if planned upgrades are made both types could expect to be flying until 2040 . 
 = = = Chinook HC Mk3 = = = 
 Eight Chinook HC Mk3s were ordered in 1995 as dedicated special forces helicopters , which were intended to be low @-@ cost variants of the US Army 's MH @-@ <unk> . The Mk3s include improved range , night vision sensors and navigation capability . The eight aircraft were to cost £ 259 million and the forecast in @-@ service date was November 1998 . Although delivered in 2001 , the Mk3 could not receive airworthiness certificates as it was not possible to certify the avionics software . 
 Unfortunately the procurement was " a profoundly inept piece of procurement " : Sir Peter Spencer , who as head of Defence Procurement inherited the project , said that : the " original requirement was ... actually impossible . I mean , there were 100 essential requirements . I read all of them . One of them said to give protection against any missile coming from any direction . " Spencer later commented : " it is always hard to imagine why people think you would be able cost effectively to buy a bespoke requirement for a very small production run . " 
 The avionics were unsuitable due to poor risk analysis and necessary requirements omitted from the procurement contract . The Times claimed that the Ministry of Defence planned to perform software integration itself , without Boeing 's involvement , in order to reduce costs . While lacking certification , the helicopters were only permitted to fly in visual meteorological conditions and subsequently stored in climate controlled hangars . 
 After protracted negotiations to allow them to enter service , Air Forces Monthly reported in November 2006 that the Defence Aviation Repair Agency would likely receive a contract to install the Thales " TopDeck " avionics system on the Chinook HC Mk3s . However , the Ministry of Defence announced in March 2007 that this so @-@ called " Fix to Field " programme would be cancelled , and instead it would revert the helicopters ' avionics to Chinook Mk2 / 2A specification . The programme was estimated to cost £ 50 – 60 million . In June 2008 , the National Audit Office issued a scathing report on the MoD 's handling of the affair , stating that the whole programme was likely to cost £ 500 million by the time the helicopters enter service . On 6 July 2009 the first of the eight modified Chinook HC Mk3s made its first test flight at MoD Boscombe Down as part of the flight testing and evaluation phase of the HC Mk3 " reversion " program . 
 = = = Chinook HC Mk4 / Mk5 / Mk6 = = = 
 A programme to upgrade 46 Chinook Mk2 / 2A and Mk3 helicopters was initiated in December 2008 . Called Project Julius , it includes new digital flight deck avionics based on the Thales TopDeck avionics suite , comprising new multifunction displays , a digital moving map display and an electronic flight bag , installation of a nose @-@ mounted FLIR detector , and upgrading the engines to the more powerful T55 @-@ 714 standard . Upgraded Mk2 / 2A and Mk3 aircraft will be redesignated Mk4 from Mk2 / 2a , and Mk5 from Mk3 . Deliveries are expected to commence in 2011 . The first conversion , a Chinook HC Mk4 , first flew on 9 December 2010 . Initial operating capability status was reached in June 2012 with seven aircraft delivered . 
 The Chinook HC Mk6 designation has been assigned to the 24 ( later reduced to 14 ) CH @-@ 47F @-@ derived Chinooks ordered in 2009 . These have digital flight @-@ control systems and have all now been delivered 
 = = Operational history = = 
 = = = Overview = = = 
 RAF Chinooks have been widely deployed in support of British military engagements , serving their first wartime role in Operation Corporate , the Falklands War , in 1982 . Chinooks were used in Operation Granby in the 1991 Gulf War , attached to large peace @-@ keeping commitments in the Balkans , the continued British presence in Afghanistan , and in Operation Telic in the 2003 Iraq War . They provide routine supply and support missions to the British military , notably in Operation Banner in Northern Ireland . The helicopter has also been of use in military humanitarian missions and the extraction of civilians from warzones , such as the evacuation of Sierra Leone in 2000 , and the evacuation from Lebanon in 2006 . 
 One Chinook in particular , known by its original squadron code Bravo November , has come to widespread public recognition due to its remarkable service record . It has seen action in every major operation involving the RAF in the helicopter 's 25 @-@ year service life , including the Falkland Islands , Lebanon , Germany , Northern Ireland , Iraq , and Afghanistan . 
 = = = Falklands War = = = 
 During the Falklands War , Chinooks were deployed by both the British and Argentinian forces . In April 1982 , five Chinooks were loaded aboard the container ship MV Atlantic Conveyor bound for the Falkland Islands , to support the British operations . On 25 May 1982 , the Chinook Bravo November was sent to pick up freight from HMS Glasgow . While the helicopter was airborne , the Atlantic Conveyor was attacked by an Argentine Navy Dassault Super Étendard with an Exocet sea @-@ skimming missile . Bravo November avoided the ship 's destruction , assisted in the evacuation of the ship , and later landed on the aircraft carrier HMS Hermes , gaining the nickname " The Survivor " . Owing to the rapid spread of fire and smoke aboard the Atlantic Conveyor after the Exocet strike , it was not possible to fly any of the helicopters that remained on the ship 's deck . 
 One Argentine Army Chinook was captured intact by British Army forces after the surrender . RAF Chinooks were part of an estimated force of 40 helicopters in the British task force , alongside Westland Sea King and Westland Wessex helicopters . Post @-@ war , two Chinooks were operated by No. 78 Squadron as part of the Falklands Garrison ; this was reduced to a single helicopter in the mid @-@ 1990s and the type was eventually withdrawn from the Falklands in 2006 in order to free up resources and craft for operations in Afghanistan . 
 = = = First Gulf War = = = 
 The Chinook became a vital transit tool during the 1991 Gulf War in Iraq . They were used for moving troops into the region at the start of the conflict ; a Chinook was used on 22 January 1991 to transport a Special Air Service ( SAS ) patrol on the infamous Bravo Two Zero mission . In the aftermath of the conflict as many as nine British Chinooks delivered food and supplies to thousands of Kurdish refugees from Iraq .

 On 6 June 1999 , two Chinooks of No. 27 Squadron left base at RAF Odiham in Hampshire , carrying paratroopers to join NATO forces serving in the Balkans ; six more arrived the following week in Kosovo to support operations such as casualty evacuations and transporting vital supplies . On 12 June 1999 , waves of Chinooks , escorted by Westland Lynx and American AH @-@ 64 Apache attack helicopters , were used to rapidly deploy British infantry forces into Kosovo as a part of NATO 's first phase of deployment . On 10 August 1999 hundreds of Chinooks around the world , including those used by the British armed forces , were grounded due to cracking discovered in the landing gear of a British helicopter during routine inspection .

 In May 2000 , several Chinook helicopters airlifted British and European Union citizens out of Freetown in Sierra Leone in an evacuation due to regional instability .

 In July 2006 , 3 Chinook helicopters of No. 27 Squadron deployed to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus to evacuate British citizens from Lebanon ; the squadron also flew the EU foreign affairs representative Javier Solana to Beirut at the start of the crisis .

 = = = Afghanistan = = = 
 Chinook helicopters have been relied upon heavily to support the British forces in Afghanistan continuously since the start of the war in Afghanistan in 2001 ; Operation Snipe saw the helicopters used to assist the 1 @,@ 000 British Commandos sweeping a region of <unk> Afghanistan . Due to the threat of improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) scattered throughout the terrain by insurgents , transport helicopters have become highly valued and demanded units in this style of warfare . By April 2006 six Chinooks had been deployed by C @-@ 17 transport planes to Kandahar in Southern Afghanistan , in support of Operation Herrick . Two RAF Chinooks were lost in August 2009 during combat operations with the Taliban , one of which was brought down by enemy fire , in spite of warnings months before of Taliban plans to attack the helicopters . 
 The continued operation of the fleet was made more cost effective when <unk> and support regimes were altered in 2006 – 7 . On 15 December 2009 the British government announced its Future Helicopter Strategy including the purchase of 24 new build Chinooks , 22 to expand the force and two to replace losses in Afghanistan , to be delivered to the Royal Air Force from 2012 . The number of additional Chinooks was cut to 12 with the October 2010 defence review , however . This will bring the total fleet size to 60 aircraft ; as of 2009 , the RAF had 48 Chinooks in inventory .

 The day @-@ to @-@ day maintenance of Nos. 18 and 27 Squadron aircraft is carried out by 18 / 27 ( Engineering ) Squadron , a separate Squadron using the innovative ' fight by flight ' structure to provide the efficiencies of combined engineering whilst maintaining aircrew / ground crew relationships when deployed . 
 When deployed , the detachment of Nos. 18 and 27 Squadron aircrew and 18 / 27 ( Engineering ) Squadron groundcrew is known as No. 1310 Flight . The RAF has a total of 48 Chinooks in inventory as of late August 2009 .

 On 13 May 1986 , Chinook HC Mk1 <unk> crashed in bad weather in the Falkland Islands . The helicopter , with four crew and 12 troops , crashed into a hill 4 miles from its destination . With rescuers hampered by blizzards , the personnel were recovered but one crew member had died shortly after the crash , and the co @-@ pilot and a soldier died on the way to hospital . The board of enquiry concluded that the crew had become disorientated due to " white @-@ out " conditions . 
 On 27 February 1987 , Chinook HC Mk1 <unk> crashed in the Falkland Islands on a test flight following servicing . After leaving RAF Mount Pleasant , the helicopter was at a normal cruising speed and an altitude of between 300 and 700 feet when it nosed down and crashed into the ground about 6 kilometres south @-@ east of the airfield ; it was destroyed by a subsequent fire . The board of enquiry was unable to determine the exact cause but it may have been the forward @-@ swivelling upper boost actuator jamming . All seven on board , three crew and four technicians , were killed . 
 On 6 May 1988 , Chinook HC Mk1 <unk> hit a pier at Hannover Airport while taxiing into position in a confined space . Its front rotor struck the underside of Pier 10 , causing the helicopter to rear up vertically and then fall on its side . A fire started at the rear of the fuselage and soon spread . Three crew members were killed and one had major injuries ; the Chinook was destroyed . 
 On 2 June 1994 , Chinook HC Mk2 <unk> crashed on the Mull of Kintyre , Scotland , killing all 25 passengers and all four crew members ; the cause is disputed . 
 On 19 August 2009 , Chinook HC Mk2 <unk> the Ministry of Defence announced that a Chinook made an emergency landing following an RPG strike and subsequent engine fire after a cargo drop @-@ off just north of Sangin in Helmand Province , Afghanistan . The Chinook flew two kilometres to a safe area before landing . None of the crew sustained any injuries and all evacuated the aircraft before they were rescued by a second Chinook on the same sortie . The damaged aircraft was then destroyed by coalition air strikes to prevent it falling into the hands of the Taliban . 
 On 30 August 2009 , Chinook HC Mk2 <unk> the loss of another Chinook was announced . The helicopter made a hard landing while on operations near Sangin , Helmand province . It suffered damage to the undercarriage , nose and front rotor , but the crew and 15 soldiers on board were unharmed . According to the Ministry of Defence due to the location of the crash it was not possible to safely recover the aircraft and it was destroyed with explosives deliberately . The cause of the hard landing is being investigated , although it is not thought to have been shot down .

 = Powder Alarm = 
 The Powder Alarm was a major popular reaction to the removal of gunpowder from a magazine by British soldiers under orders from General Thomas Gage , royal governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay , on September 1 , 1774 . In response to this action , amid rumors that blood had been shed , alarm spread through the countryside to Connecticut and beyond , and American Patriots sprang into action , fearing that war was at hand . Thousands of militiamen began streaming toward Boston and Cambridge , and mob action forced Loyalists and some government officials to flee to the protection of the British Army . 
 Although it proved to be a false alarm , the Powder Alarm caused political and military leaders to proceed more carefully in the days ahead , and essentially provided a " dress rehearsal " for the Battles of Lexington and Concord seven and a half months later . Furthermore , actions on both sides to control weaponry , gunpowder , and other military supplies became more contentious , as the British sought to bring military stores more directly under their control , and the Patriot colonists sought to acquire them for their own use . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1772 , many of the thirteen British colonies , in response to unpopular British actions and the negative British reaction to the Gaspee Affair ( the destruction by colonists of a grounded ship involved in enforcing customs regulations ) , elected to form Committees of Correspondence . These allowed communities to formally communicate with each other , raise awareness of incidents occurring elsewhere , and to coordinate actions ; as such , they became instrumental in managing the colonial response to enforcement of the Tea Act , the Intolerable Acts , and other unpopular British colonial legislation . The colonists of Massachusetts had not yet taken concerted action to organize themselves militarily against actions of the British regulars , although statements were made about supporting Boston ( whose port had been closed earlier in 1774 under the Boston Port Act ) " at the risque of our lives and fortunes . " 
 General Thomas Gage , who had become the military governor of Massachusetts in May 1774 , was charged with enforcement of the highly unpopular Intolerable Acts , which British Parliament had passed in response to the Boston Tea Party . Seeking to prevent the outbreak of war and to keep the peace between the American Patriot ( Whig ) majority and the Loyalist ( Tory ) minority , he believed that the best way to accomplish this was by secretly removing military stores from storehouses and arsenals in New England . The secrecy of these missions was paramount , as Gage feared that leakage of any plans would result in the seizure or concealment of the stores by Patriot sympathizers before his men got there . 
 There were several places throughout the colonies where the British army had stockpiled supplies . Some of these places were fortifications that were manned by small garrisons ; others were merely locked magazines . Most of the powder in these was under the control of the provincial government , though some was the property of individual towns . One locked storehouse near Boston , in what was then part of Charlestown , now Powder House Square in Somerville , was controlled by William Brattle , the leader of the provincial militia and an appointee of the governor . Brattle , who had not obviously sided with either Loyalists or Patriots , notified Governor Gage in a letter dated August 27 that the provincial ( " King 's " ) powder was the only supply remaining in that storehouse , as the towns had removed all of theirs . Gage decided that this powder had to be brought to Boston for safekeeping . 
 = = Expedition = = 
 On August 31 , Gage sent Middlesex County sheriff David Phips to Brattle with orders to remove the provincial powder ; Brattle turned the key to the <unk> over to Phips . Gage also gave orders to ready a force of troops for action the next day , something that did not go unnoticed by the local population . At some point that day , General Gage , whether by his intent , accident , or theft by a messenger , lost possession of William Brattle 's letter ; the widely held story is that it was dropped . News of its content spread rapidly , and many considered it to be a warning to Gage to remove the provincial powder before Patriots could seize it . 
 Early in the morning of September 1 , a force of roughly 260 British regulars from the 4th Regiment , under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Maddison , were rowed in secrecy up the Mystic River from Boston to a landing point near Winter Hill in modern @-@ day Somerville . From there they marched about a mile to the Powder House , a gunpowder magazine that held the largest supply of gunpowder in Massachusetts . Phips gave the King 's Troops the keys to the building , and after sunrise they removed all of the gunpowder . Most of the regulars then returned to Boston the way they had come , but a small contingent marched to Cambridge , removed two field pieces , and took them to Boston by foot over the Great Bridge and up Boston Neck . The field pieces and powder were then taken from Boston to the British stronghold on Castle Island , then known as Castle William ( renamed Fort Independence in 1779 ) . 
 = = Response to the raid = = 
 Rumors flew throughout the day across the countryside about the British troop movements . The regulars were marching ; provincial powder had been seized ; war was at hand ; people had been killed ; Boston was being bombarded by His Majesty 's warships . The alarm spread as far as Connecticut . From all over the region , people took up arms and began streaming toward Boston . One traveler in Shrewsbury reported that in the space of 15 minutes , 50 men had gathered , equipped themselves , sent out messengers to surrounding towns , and left for Boston . On the 2nd , several thousand men bent on violence gathered in Cambridge , where they forced several notable Loyalists , including William Brattle , to flee to Boston and the protection of the military . Sheriff Phips was forced , in writing , to dissociate himself from any and all government actions . Eventually facts caught up with the rumors , and militia units ( some of which were still heading toward Boston ) returned home . 
 Also on the 2nd , Boston newspapers published a letter from William Brattle in which he protested that he had not warned Gage to remove the powder ; Gage had requested from him an accounting of the storehouse 's contents , and he had complied . The content of his letter to Gage would be published on the 5th . Brattle remained on Castle Island through the siege of Boston , leaving when the British evacuated the city in March 1776 . He died in Halifax , Nova Scotia in October 1776 at the age of 70 . 
 When the horrid news was brought here of the bombardment of Boston , which made us completely miserable for two days , we saw proofs of both the sympathy and the resolution of the continent . War ! war ! war ! was the cry , and it was pronounced in a tone which would have done honor to the oratory of a Briton or a Roman . If it had proved true , you would have heard the thunder of an American Congress . 
 = = British reaction = = 
 Gage , surprised by the size and scope of the colonial reaction , delayed and eventually cancelled a second planned expedition to the storehouse in Worcester . He concentrated his troops in Boston , and called for reinforcements from London , writing " if you think ten thousand men sufficient , send twenty ; if one million is thought enough , give two ; you save both blood and treasure in the end . " However , Gage 's request was seen by some in London as absurd , as there were only 12 @,@ 000 troops in Britain at the time , but he did eventually receive an additional 400 Marines in response to these requests . He later began planning and executing seizures again , and he further fortified the Boston peninsula . 
 = = Colonial reaction = = 
 After the Powder Alarm , militia forces throughout New England were more cautious with their supplies and more intent on gaining information about Gage 's plans and troop movements . Paul Revere played a significant role in distributing this information due to his geographical position in Boston , his social position as a middle @-@ class craftsman in contact with all social classes , and his political position as a well @-@ known Patriot propagandist and organizer .

 On September 21 , 1774 , Patriot leaders met in Worcester and urged town meetings to organize a third of the militias into special companies of minutemen in constant readiness to march . They also instituted the system of express riders and alarms that would prove to be critical at Lexington and Concord . In October , the former legislature of Massachusetts met in defiance of the Massachusetts Government Act and declared itself to be the First Provincial Congress . It created a Committee of Safety modeled after a body with the same name during the English Civil War and it recommended that a quarter of the militia be designated as minutemen . Military stores were to be stockpiled away from the coast ( more than a convenient day 's march ) , to make attempts to seize them more difficult . The largest stockpiles were located at Concord and Worcester . 
 = = = Portsmouth Alarm = = = 
 Early in December , British military command voted to prohibit the export of arms and powder to North America , and to secure all remaining stores . On December 12 , intelligence received by Paul Revere indicated that a seizure of stores at Fort William and Mary in Portsmouth , New Hampshire was imminent . He rode from Boston to Portsmouth the next day to notify the local Patriots , who quickly raided the fort on the 14th and removed its supplies . Revere 's intelligence had been incorrect ; although a British operation had been contemplated , it had not been ordered . The British did send ships carrying troops to Portsmouth , and they arrived three days after the fort 's supplies were removed . The first arrived on the 17th , and was directed into shallows at high tide by a local Patriot pilot , much to the captain 's anger . 
 Stores of gunpowder — typically referred to by Loyalists as " the King 's powder " but in contrast by Patriots as " the militia 's powder " — were also carried off from forts in Newport , Rhode Island , Providence , Rhode Island , and New London , Connecticut and distributed to the militias in towns away from the coast . Cannon and other supplies were smuggled out of Boston and Charlestown .

 On February 27 , 1775 , HMS Lively brought a force of about 240 British regulars from the 64th Regiment under Colonel Alexander Leslie to confiscate weapons in Salem , Massachusetts .

Eventually , the drawbridge was lowered and the regulars were permitted to search the forge where the cannon had once been . They returned to their ship while being mocked by a growing force of irregulars marching along in lock @-@ step next to them . There were minor scuffles , but no shots were fired .

 " Séance Time " is the sixth and final episode of the second series of the British dark comedy anthology television programme Inside No. 9 . It was first broadcast on 29 April 2015 on BBC Two . The episode was written by Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith , and directed by Dan Zeff . It stars Pemberton , Shearsmith , Alison Steadman , Alice Lowe , Sophie McShera , Dan Starkey , <unk> Lloyd and Caden @-@ Ellis Wall . The episode begins with Tina ( McShera ) arriving at a Victorian villa for a séance . Hives ( Shearsmith ) sits her at a table and then escorts the ominous , shrouded Madam Talbot ( Steadman ) into the room . 
 Like " The Harrowing " , the final episode of the first series of Inside No. 9 , " Séance Time " is somewhat more horrific than is typical for the programme , though humour remains . In writing the episode , Pemberton and Shearsmith began with the idea of a séance , and developed the plot from there . The theme was one that they had wanted to address for some time , though they wanted to approach it in an original way . The writers aimed to begin " Séance Time " with minimal humour , presenting it as straight horror , before introducing the first twist . 
 The episode explores both the norms of horror films and the unpleasantness of actors and the television industry . Critics responded positively to " Séance Time " , praising the horror — several considered the episode genuinely frightening — the humour , and the writing . Steadman 's performance was singled out as strong , with critics commending her character as a highlight .

 The second series of Inside No. 9 was written in 2014 by the programme 's creators Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith . The idea for " Séance Time " began with the " trigger " of a séance , and the plot grew out of this , while the episode 's title was taken from a line performed by David Warner in the film From Beyond the Grave . Shearsmith had previously taken part in a séance with The League of Gentlemen in a putatively @-@ haunted house . He had heard tapping and seen movement on a <unk> board , and believed he had experienced something supernatural until Mark Gatiss confessed that he was responsible . Shearsmith said that he and Pemberton had always wanted to do a séance @-@ inspired story , but had never been able to find a new angle from which to approach the theme . " Séance Time " , he thought , " felt a bit different " to how séances had previously been portrayed . The writers were unsure how to conclude the episode , and considered 15 to 20 different endings before settling on the one they used . 
 = = = Casting and characters = = = 
 As each episode of Inside No. 9 features new characters , the writers were able to attract actors who might have been unwilling to commit to an entire series . " Séance Time " starred Sophie McShera as Tina — though Tina was played by an uncredited extra in the opening shot of a house 's exterior — Shearsmith as " Hives " / Terry , Alison Steadman as " Madam Talbot " / Anne , Dan Starkey as " Blue Demon Dwarf " / Clive , <unk> Lloyd as Gemma , Alice Lowe as Amanda , Pemberton as Pete and Caden @-@ Ellis Wall as William . The writers felt the episode featured a number of good roles for women . Members of Inside No. 9 's crew , include the episode 's third assistant director <unk> N <unk> , appeared as uncredited extras playing members of a television crew . Though there were only a small production crew seen in the episode , this mirrors real crews of the kind featured . 
 Shearsmith had previously worked with Steadman on Agatha Christie 's Marple , while she and Pemberton had met , though the pair had not worked together . She was ill upon arrival for filming , which led to Pemberton worrying that production would have to be suspended . As a result of Steadman 's illness , her character 's croaking voice was mostly her own . One journalist commented on the appropriateness of the casting , given the influence of Abigail 's Party — in which Steadman starred — on " Nana 's Party " , the previous week 's episode . The actor was one of a number ( the others being Jane Horrocks and Claire Skinner ) who appeared in Inside No. 9 's second series who had also starred in Life Is Sweet . During filming , Steadman expressed happiness to be working with Pemberton and Shearsmith . She explained that they are excellent writers as they are " off the wall " . 
 Pemberton knew McShera through his friend Siobhan Finneran , who co @-@ starred with McShera in Downton Abbey . He felt that McShera would be able to bring a " mousey quality " to the role of Tina . Shearsmith felt that her performance was funny while retaining realism . The writers found the role of " Blue Demon Dwarf " difficult to cast , but were very happy with the performance of Starkey , who kept some of his character 's props . The writers also praised Lowe , who they felt was able to make a lot of a comparatively small part . The character of Amanda , they said , was to seem bored and aloof , attempting to get away with doing as little work as possible , while also favouring people seen as more important . 
 The name Hives , used by Shearsmith 's character , was taken from a Laurel and Hardy butler of the same name . Meanwhile , Hives 's costume and mannerisms were inspired by those worn and adopted by Noel Edmonds in undercover practical jokes . A related influence for the episode was a prank @-@ gone @-@ wrong seen on YouTube , in which a joke 's target punches a costumed person when the latter surprises the former . Pemberton 's character spoke with a cockney accent , something unusual for Pemberton , who normally does not affect accents when acting . In addition to playing Pete , Pemberton provided the deep voice spoken by " Madam Talbot " during the séance . 
 = = = Style = = = 
 Shearsmith said that he and Pemberton sometimes aim to produce episodes with genuinely scary scenes , comparing " Séance Time " to " The Harrowing " , the sixth episode of Inside No. 9 's first series , which was also particularly horrific . He said that the writers and crew had similar aims in terms of atmosphere in " Séance Time " as they had in " The Harrowing " . The episodes also shared similar openings , with a lone woman walking towards a large house . Thematically , Shearsmith felt that the episode served to tie together a number of ideas with which he had been " obsessed " for years , including horror , ghosts and magic . The episode 's director , Dan Zeff , got behind the idea of genuine horror , and Shearsmith was happy with how the initial séance was portrayed . A large number of horror clichés were used , but the reason that these clichés are present is subsequently revealed . 
 Props utilised to heighten the horror included a trick candle — swapped back @-@ and @-@ forth with a real one — which could shoot a large flame . This was operated by a technician hiding under the table on which it was placed . A doll seen on screen , the writers claimed , was probably visible only to Terry among the characters . For the white eyes of " Madam Talbot " , Steadman wore partially white contact lenses . Had she worn fully white lenses , she would have been unable to see , and this would have led to more work for the production crew . Instead , her partially white eyes were made fully white in post @-@ production . Also added in post @-@ production was the wetness of Terry 's clothes in the final scene . 
 The writers hoped to fool viewers into thinking that they were doing a straightforward séance episode , and so there is little humour prior to the episode 's first twist . For Steadman , the writing meant that both the audience and the character of Tina are fooled together . Nonetheless , humour remained elsewhere in the script ; Lloyd looked forward to performing a particular joke involving blue paint . Terry refers to his colleagues variously as " Pepe and His Friends " , a reference to a variety act with a similar name , and a " warm prop " , a disparaging name which , according to the writers , has been used in the film industry to refer to extras . 
 = = = Filming and release = = = 
 Inside No. 9 's second series was filmed from the end of 2014 into early 2015 . " Séance Time " was the second episode of the second series to be filmed , and the filming was completed shortly before production ceased for a Christmas break . The episode was filmed at <unk> , a country house in Abbots Langley , Hertfordshire . The same house was used for " The Harrowing " , as well as in Shearsmith and Pemberton 's pre @-@ Inside No. 9 television series Psychoville . 
 On its first showing on BBC Two , " Séance Time " was moved from Inside No. 9 's usual slot on a Thursday evening . It was instead shown on Wednesday 29 April ; this showing was at 10pm in most of the UK , and at <unk> in Northern Ireland . The freelance journalist Dan Owen suggested that this , combined with their refusal to release the series on Blu @-@ ray , suggested that the BBC had little faith in Inside No. 9 . He nonetheless called for a third series , a request echoed by other commentators . In their commentary on the episode , Pemberton said that he and Shearsmith had plans for a potential third series , and hoped to be able to get on with producing it . " Séance Time " , along with the other episodes from the second series , was released on DVD on 5 May 2016 , and a third series was announced in October of that year .

 Tina ( McShera ) arrives at a Victorian villa for a séance . Hives ( Shearsmith ) settles Tina before retrieving Talbot ( Steadman ) , who arrives shrouded in black and carrying a doll . Talbot , an elderly woman with heavy cataracts , speaks in a high @-@ pitched voice , unnerving Tina . When the séance begins , objects fly around the room , Talbot 's voice becomes demonic and ectoplasm seeps from her mouth . Hives encourages Tina not to break the circle , but she does so when a blue @-@ faced demon ( Starkey ) appears behind her . She is terrified until Hives reveals himself to be Terry , the host of a hidden camera programme called Scaredy Cam . 
 Scaredy Cam production crew , including the director Gemma ( Lloyd ) and the make @-@ up artist Amanda ( Lowe ) , enter to prepare for the next prank . " Talbot " is being played by the demanding stage actress Ann , but the other crew are unable to remember the name of the extra ( who they falsely believe to be a dwarf ) playing " Blue Demon Dwarf " . They mostly ignore him , despite his eagerness to talk about his acting experiences and his requests for a drink . Terry is irritable and impatient , unwilling to talk to Tina or Gemma about a prank with him dressed up as a gorilla . This prank led to a young boy wetting himself and a previous cancellation of Scaredy Cam . The programme is due to return on a different channel , and Terry has chosen a different prank to be announced as the winner of a " public " vote for the programme 's best . The extra confronts Terry about the fact he was originally cast as " Spirit of Little Boy " , but Terry does not care , and the extra is sent back into a chest to wait for the next member of the public . 
 Pete ( Pemberton ) , a new mark , enters , but the prank does not work as well as with Tina . Among other problems , Pete swears too much and does not seem affected by the atmosphere , while cues are missed by the pranksters . Terry is surprised to hear a child 's voice during Anne 's performance as Madam Talbot , and , backstage , the camera stream is blurry . When " Blue Demon Dwarf " appears , Pete punches him , and the production crew rush in . The extra drifts in and out of consciousness before Gemma — having covered her face in blue paint after giving mouth @-@ to @-@ mouth — says he has died . Backstage , people wait for the police and ambulance ; Terry is worried about his career , Ann wants to get away for some food and Amanda is keen to retrieve props from the corpse , but Pete and Gemma show some remorse . When alone , Terry looks to the camera feed and sees the extra standing in the séance room , and , relieved , runs to see him . Facing away from Terry and speaking in a rasping voice , the figure introduces himself as " Spirit of Little Boy " , and talks of a suicide after the embarrassment of wetting himself on television . After speaking to the " boy " , Terry believes that he himself is on Scaredy Cam , but no one is watches from backstage . When he touches the figure , the extra collapses , but a child 's voice continues to shout . A corpse @-@ like child ( Wall ) begins to rise from the cot used for Madam Talbot 's doll . Backstage , Gemma and a police officer look for Terry . They find him in the séance room ; he has wet himself , and insists that he is on Scaredy Cam . The child 's face appears on the camera feed . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 " Séance Time " draws inspiration from horror films and " the pretensions of actors " — two themes favoured by the writers . Horror tropes noted by journalists include the Insidious @-@ inspired arrival of " Blue Demon Dwarf " and Madam Talbot 's demonic voice , reminiscent of a similar voice in The Exorcist . For one critic , Pete 's initial failure to believe the prank results in a memorable sequence that " was a lovely statement about how old @-@ fashioned horror imagery and well @-@ worn tropes can be terrifying in the right hands , and plain ludicrous if you refuse to enter into the spirit of things " . 
 Though the episode begins with horror , similar to " The Harrowing " , it quickly moves into the more meta subject of television production ; something " more intimidating and probably a lot crueller " than the supernatural . For the television critic Matt Baylis , the episode is a criticism of the callousness of reality television ( such as Candid Camera ) from the perspective of television plays . The horror at the start of the episode , he argues , continues even once the ruse is revealed . " <unk> " remains in Terry 's arrogance , Anne 's self @-@ obsession and the indifference of Gemma and Amanda . This builds gradually into a " moral horror " in which " the unkind got their desserts " . 
 Phoebe @-@ Jane Boyd , writing for the entertainment website Den of Geek , compared the television crew to individuals pulled out of the " Summerland " of cancelled television . Terry is " parasitic and dead of heart " , an example of a particular brand of " washed @-@ up middle @-@ aged television presenters " . Amanda is " so deadened to the <unk> of the entertainment industry " that she is unfazed at the thought of retrieving props from a corpse . Anne behaves in a " bitter and narcissistic " way . The " heartless asides " concerning the previous misjudged prank are mirrored by the distaste directed towards Clive .

 Critics responded positively to " Séance Time " , with a number of them characterising it as genuinely scary . Vicki Power , writing for The Daily Telegraph , described the episode as " clever and chilling " , while Julia Raeside and Victoria Segal , writing for The Sunday Times , called it " cleverly executed " , and Baylis described it as " a faith @-@ restorer for those who love " television drama . Mark Jones , writing for theguardian.com , called the episode " suitably spooky " and a " fitting end to a second series that has excelled at times " , and Chris Bennion , writing for The Independent , similarly described it as a " brilliant series finale " . A contrary opinion was offered in a review in the Liverpool Echo ; the author called " Séance Time " a " decent enough watch " , but felt that it was " a relatively disappointing episode " which was " unable to match what had gone before " . Baylis and Bennion stressed that the episode was very scary , with Bennion comparing it to " The Harrowing " ; he was complimentary of both , particularly their respective final scenes . Owen also compared the two , but noted that " Séance Time " contains more humour . 
 Bennion commended the writing , saying that Pemberton and Shearsmith were able to subvert expectations of séances several times ; " just as you 're smugly congratulating yourself for working out every twist and turn , they pull it from your grasp " . Owen praised the writing and subversion of expectations , and , though he found some of the twists predictable and felt that the ending needed more groundwork , felt that the final sequence " was worth it for another brown @-@ trouser moment " . Bennion felt that the " genius " of the episode was the way that tension was " undercut " with humour , but felt that the humour actually served to raise the tension . He highlighted the joke involving blue paint as particularly funny . Patrick Mulkern , of Radio Times , also praised the mix of humour and horror . 
 Raeside and Segal felt that Steadman 's performance was the highlight of the episode , and it was also praised in the Liverpool Echo . Bennion said that Steadman " [ <unk> ] it up beautifully " and " [ nailed ] each [ joke ] with aplomb " , also commending the " comic turns " from Lowe and Lloyd . Mulkern described Steadman 's Madam Talbot as " hilariously theatrical " , and Boyd said that Steadman 's Anne provided " some of the best fun of the episode " .

 = Thomas Playford IV = 
 Sir Thomas Playford GCMG ( 5 July 1896 – 16 June 1981 ) was a South Australian politician . He served continuously as Premier of South Australia and leader of the Liberal and Country League from 5 November 1938 to 10 March 1965 . Though controversial , it was the longest term of any elected government leader in the history of Australia , or indeed of anywhere under the Westminster system . His tenure as premier was marked by a period of population and economic growth unmatched by any other Australian state . Playford took a unique , strong and direct approach to the premiership and personally oversaw his industrial initiatives . He was known for his parochial style in pushing South Australia 's interests , and was known for his ability to secure a disproportionate share of federal funding for the state as well as his shameless haranguing of federal leaders . His string of election wins was enabled by a system of a malapportionment gerrymander that bore his name , the ' Playmander ' − which saw the Australian Labor Party win clear majorities of the statewide two @-@ party vote whilst failing to form government in 1944 , 1953 , 1962 and 1968 . 
 Born into an old political family , Playford was the fifth Thomas Playford and the fourth to have lived in South Australia ; his grandfather Thomas Playford II had served as premier in the 19th century . He grew up on the family farm in Norton Summit before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in World War I , fighting in Gallipoli and Western Europe . After serving , he continued farming until his election as a Liberal and Country League ( LCL ) representative for Murray at the 1933 state election . In his early years in politics , Playford was an outspoken backbencher who often lambasted LCL colleagues and ministers and their policies , and had a maverick strategy , often defying party norms and advocating unadulterated laissez faire economics and opposing protectionism and government investment , in stark contrast to his later actions as premier . With the resignation of the LCL 's leader , Richard Layton Butler , Playford ascended to the premiership in 1938 , having been made a minister just months earlier in an attempt to dampen his insubordination . Playford inherited a minority government and many independents to deal with , and instability was expected ; Playford was seen as a transitional leader . However , Playford dealt with the independents adroitly and went on to secure a one @-@ seat majority at the next election . 
 In office , Playford turned his back on laissez faire economics and used his negotiating skills to encourage industry to relocate to South Australia during World War II , as the state was far from the battlefield . He built upon this in the post @-@ war boom years , particular in automotive manufacturing ; although a liberal conservative , his approach to economics was pragmatic , and he was derided by his colleagues for his " socialism " as he nationalised electricity companies and used state enterprises to drive economic growth . Generally , Playford had more dissent from within his own party than the opposition centre @-@ left Australian Labor Party ; the main obstructions to his initiatives came from the upper house , where the restriction of suffrage to landowners resulted in a chamber dominated by the conservative landed gentry . The Labor leader Mick O 'Halloran worked cooperatively with Playford and was known to be happy being out of power , quipping that Playford could better serve his left @-@ wing constituents . Playford 's policies allowed for the supply of cheap electricity to factories , minimal business taxes , and he kept wages low to make the state more attractive to industrial investment . Playford kept salaries low by using the South Australian Housing Trust to building vast amounts of public housing and using government price controls to keep housing and other costs of living low to attract workers and migrants , angering the landlord class . <unk> in the 1940s , these policies were seen as dangerous to Playford 's control of his party , but they proved successful and he cemented his position within the LCL . 
 During the 1950s , Playford and the LCL 's share of the vote declined continually despite the economic growth , and they clung to power mainly due to the Playmander . Playford became less assured in parliament as Labor became more aggressive , their leading debater Don Dunstan <unk> disrupting the previously collaborative style of politics , targeting the injustice of the Playmander in particular . Playford 's successful economic policies had fuelled a rapid expansion of the middle @-@ class , and they wanted more government attention to education , public healthcare , the arts , the environment and heritage protection . However , Playford was an unrelenting <unk> , and was unmoved by calls to broaden policy focus beyond economic development . This was exacerbated by Playford and his party 's failure to adapt to changing social mores , remaining adamantly committed to restrictive laws on alcohol , gambling and police powers . A turning point in Playford 's tenure was the Max Stuart case in the 1950s , when he came under heavy scrutiny for his hesitation to grant clemency to a murderer on death row amid claims of judicial wrongdoing . Although Playford eventually commuted the sentence under heavy criticism of the judicial review process , the controversy was seen as responsible for his government losing its assurance , and he eventually lost office in the 1965 election . He relinquished the LCL leadership to Steele Hall and retired at the next election , serving on various South Australian company boards until his death in 1981 . 
 = = Family = = 
 The Playford family heritage can be traced back to 1759 , when a baby boy was left at the door of a house in Barnby Dun , Yorkshire , England , with a note to christen the child ' Thomas Playford ' . The occupants of the house , who were to raise the child , were given instructions to receive money from a bank account for the deed . The child grew up to be a simple farmer in the village , and had a son in 1795 who he christened ' Thomas Playford ' . The tradition of naming the firstborn son in the family in this way has continued since . 
 The second Playford was something of a loner , but at the age of 15 he developed a relationship with a girl five years his senior with whom he fathered a child . In order to avoid the social stigma of the situation , and on the advice of his parents , Playford enlisted in the British Army in 1810 . While three years under the acceptable age , Playford 's height ( 6 ft 2 in ) enabled him to pass as eighteen . He spent 24 years in the service of the Life Guards , fighting all over Europe in Portugal , Spain and France , including the Battle of Waterloo at the age of 20 . 
 While a soldier , Playford became a devout Christian , and journeyed and listened to many different churches and sermons . He was sceptical of many pastors and church men , dismissing their " high sounding barren words " . He left the Life Guards in 1834 , received a land grant in Canada for his service , and journeyed there with his wife and family . His wife and a child died in the country , so he and his remaining kin returned to England . He worked as a historian for the Life Guards until 1844 when he migrated to the then @-@ province of South Australia . Playford became a pastor there , built a property at Mitcham , and preached regularly for his own ' Christian Church ' , which was essentially Baptist in character . 
 The third Playford , Thomas Playford II , was born at Bethnal Green , London in 1837 to the second wife of Pastor Playford . He was raised on the Mitcham property in South Australia , was intellectual and bookish , and wished to go the prestigious St Peter 's College to study law . He was rebuked by his father and subsequently became a farmer like his predecessors , buying property at Norton Summit and growing vegetables , plums and apples . He was elected to the local East Torrens Council in 1863 at the age of 27 ; and then to the State Parliament in 1868 as a ' liberal ' ( parties had not yet formed ) , representing the constituency of <unk> . He became known as ' Honest Tom ' for his straightforward and blunt ways . He lost his seat in 1871 and regained it in 1875 only to lose it again until he was re @-@ elected in 1887 , upon which he became Premier of South Australia . He subsequently lost the premiership in 1889 , regained it in 1890 , and then spent a great deal of his term absent in India . After losing an election , he relocated to London to represent South Australia as Agent General to the United Kingdom . While in England , Playford was thrice offered a knighthood , but declined it each time . 
 He returned to South Australia to assist Charles Kingston in his government , but ultimately crossed the floor to bring down Kingston over his plans to lessen the power of the Legislative Council . With the advent of Australian Federation , Playford became a Senator for South Australia . He was leader of the Senate and the 7th Minister for Defence . After one term as a Senator , Playford was defeated . He ran again in 1910 , was unsuccessful , and retired to Kent Town , where he died in 1915 at the age of 78 . 
 The fourth Playford , father of Sir Thomas , was born in 1861 . Unlike his own father and grandfather , who had led lives as soldiers , churchmen and politicians , he became a simple farmer at the Norton Summit property and was dominated by his wife , Elizabeth . He was , like his forebears , a regular churchgoer , and only once was involved in politics with a short stint on the East Torrens District Council . In comparison , Elizabeth was the local correspondent of The Advertiser , treasurer and chief member of the local Baptist Church , and a teacher . Four children were born to the couple ; three daughters and one son , Sir Thomas . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Thomas Playford was the third child born to the family , with two sisters before him and one following . He started school at the age of six , going to the local Norton Summit School . The school had one room , one teacher , two assistants and 60 students , and taught children aged six to twelve . Playford , while an adept learner , frequently argued with his teacher , and was the first child to have been caned there . While learning , he accompanied his father down to the East End Markets with their farming produce . Playford later dubbed the East End Markets his ' university ' , due to the work that he carried out there . 
 It was the influence of Playford 's mother Elizabeth that contributed to his relative Puritanism and social habits . She was a devout Baptist Christian , and it was primarily because of her that he publicly abstained from alcohol , smoking and gambling throughout his lifetime . However , despite her influence on his social habits , he did not regularly attend church like his family . 
 His father suffered a fall and a broken leg when Playford was thirteen . He requested permission to leave school and take over the family farm ; this was granted , and the boy , even after his father had recovered , dominated the management of the farm . While out of school , Playford continued to learn ; he joined the local Norton Summit Society , and took part in classes and debates in Adelaide . He won a public speaking award for a speech he made to an Adelaide literary society . 
 World War I broke out in 1914 , and Playford wished to join the Australian Imperial Force . His parents persuaded him to assist them on the farm until close to his 19th birthday . He entered Keswick Barracks on 17 May 1915 , was enlisted as a private and placed in the 27th Battalion , 2nd Division . The news of the bloody landings at Gallipoli on 25 April had not reached Adelaide by the time Playford left on HMAT Geelong on 31 May . The Geelong picked up more soldiers at Perth , and then sailed to Suez , Egypt . The Australian soldiers received training in Egypt , but during the evenings left their camps to indulge themselves in the Egyptian towns and cities . Frequent fights broke out between the Australian troops and the locals , with responsible soldiers left to take the rest back to camp . Playford assisted in this and dragged Australian soldiers from the beds of Egyptian prostitutes . Training was completed after two months and Playford landed at Anzac Cove on 12 September 1915 . 
 After taking part in the Gallipoli Campaign , Playford and his battalion left for France on 15 March 1916 . He fought on the Western Front and was shot and wounded on 20 October , evacuated to London , and kept out of action for a year . Playford endured many operations during this time to remove the shrapnel that had penetrated his body , although some of it remained within him , and his hearing was permanently damaged . Turning down an offer for a staff job in India , Playford returned to his battalion in October 1917 and continued fighting in Belgium and France . 
 With the end of the Great War , Playford returned to South Australia with his battalion , disembarking at Outer Harbor , Adelaide on 2 July 1919 . He had received no decorations , but had been commissioned from the ranks as an officer and was honourably discharged in October with the rank of lieutenant . Despite Playford 's intellectual capability , he shunned the Government 's offer of free university education for soldiers and returned to his orchard . He continued growing cherries on the property , and engaged in his hobby of horticulture . His involvement in various organisations and clubs was renewed . 
 Through relatives Playford met his future wife Lorna Clark , who lived with her family in Nailsworth . Although both families were religiously devout , the Clarks were even more so than the <unk> , and a long courtship ensued . Taking her out on his Harley Davidson motorcycle at night , the two were forced to leave the theatre half @-@ way through performances so as to not raise the ire of the Clarks . Before their wedding on 1 January 1928 , they were engaged for three years . During their engagement , Playford built their new house on his property , mostly by his own hands and indented in the hills themselves ; it remained their home throughout their lives . 
 Two years later , on Christmas Day , 1930 , the family 's first daughter was born , Margaret . Two more children were born to the family ; Patricia in 1936 , and Thomas in 1945 . All three of them attended private schools : Patricia attended the Presbyterian Girls ' College , becoming a teacher ; and Margaret attended Methodist Ladies ' College , later training as a child psychiatrist . The sixth Thomas wanted to attend university , but , like his forbears , was rebuked and worked on the orchard . Like a Playford before him , he became a minister of religion in his later life . 
 = = Political career = = 
 Among the organisations that Playford belonged to was the local branch of the Liberal Federation , yet until the months preceding his eventual election , he never talked of holding political office . The Liberal Federation was considering a merger with the Country Party to avoid Labor retaining office during the Great Depression . Archie Cameron , an old wartime friend of Playford 's and a federal Coalition MP , influenced Playford to run for office when he heard of the merger . In 1932 the Liberal and Country League ( LCL ) was created , and Playford ran for the multi @-@ member constituency of Murray at the 1933 election . 
 Along with the other LCL hopefuls , Playford journeyed around the electorate advocating his platform . The constituency had a considerable German element , descendants of refugees who had escaped persecution in the German Empire . Grateful for the past help of Playford 's grandfather , they swung their strong support behind him and he was comfortably elected to the South Australian House of Assembly . With a split in the Labor vote , the first LCL government was formed with Richard Layton Butler as Premier . 
 For the next five years Playford was to remain a backbencher , and to involve himself relatively little in government matters . His speeches were short , but to the point , and , running against the norm , he often attacked the government itself when he saw fit . The historian Peter Howell said that Playford was " an unusually insolent and disloyal backbencher , always concerned to cut a figure and ridicule his party 's leader " . A new member 's maiden speech is traditionally heard politely without the interruption and heckling prevalent in Australian politics , but Playford 's aggressive debut in parliament was not accorded this privilege as " a casual visitor could have mistaken him " for an opposition member . At one point , a visibly angry Premier Butler interjected after Playford attacked the members of the Employment Promotion Council . In his opening address , Playford individually mocked the bureaucrats who comprised various government bodies , and then condemned public transport monopolies , as well as declaring " It is not our business to worry whether people go broke or not " . This comment provoked interjections from both government and opposition members — in the midst of the Great Depression , Playford 's unashamed and aggressive promotion of his unbridled laissez faire philosophy stood out amidst the increasing prevalence of government intervention . 
 During his first term in parliament , Playford also gained attention for his unconvincing command of the English language ; he developed a reputation for pronouncing common words incorrectly , bad syntax and speaking in a monotone . He continued to attack his ministers , and complaints from the likes of Public Works Minister Herbert Hudd only encouraged Playford to further mock him . Playford also consistently opposed the liberalisation of liquor trading , having been unimpressed by the drunken behaviour he had witnessed while in the military . He continued to stridently support economic rationalism , something he would later renege on as premier . He opposed government investment in capital works as a means of generating employment and stimulating the economy during the Depression , and called for a decrease in dairy production within the state on the basis that it was more efficient to import from interstate , where rainfall was higher and grazing was more effective . Playford further criticised government subsidies to work farms designed to alleviate unemployment among Indigenous Australians , claiming that the cost exceeded that of the standard jobless payment . He also endorsed the privatisation of unprofitable state railways and denounced tariff protection as rewarding inefficiency and non @-@ innovation . In 1936 , Playford defied his party by voting against the formation of the South Australian Housing Trust . Nevertheless , despite his refusal to toe the party line , Playford was well regarded for his studious attitude to research and his preparation of his speeches . 
 Around Playford , much activity was occurring . Legislation provided for the tools that he was to inherit later as Premier : aggressive economic initiatives , a malapportioned electoral system and a staid internal party organisation . The state had been persistently in deficit in recent times , and as an agriculture @-@ dominant state , had been at the mercy of commodity prices , so a strategy of industrialisation was initiated under the guidance of senior politicians , public servants and industrialists . The creation of the LCL was dependent on the implementation of various policies to ensure the strength of the party 's country faction . There had been an electoral bias in favour of rural areas since the Constitution Act of 1857 , but it was now to dramatically increase . In 1936 , legislation was brought in that stipulated that electoral districts were to be malapportioned to a ratio of at least 2 : 1 in favour of country areas . In addition , the 46 multimember districts were replaced with 39 single @-@ member districts — 13 in Adelaide and 26 in the country . Over the next three decades , Adelaide 's population grew until it had triple the population of the country , but the distribution of seats in the legislature gave rural voters a disproportionate influence by a factor of six . The desired long @-@ term effect was to lock the opposition Labor Party out of power ; the unexpected short @-@ term effect was a large number of dissatisfied rural independents in the 1938 election . Although he played no part in its development or implementation , the electoral system gerrymander was later christened the ' Playmander ' , as a result of its benefit to Playford , and his failure to take action towards reforming it . Playford also benefited from the friendly line pursued by The Advertiser , who persistently told them . 
 After the Liberals won the 1938 election , with Playford having transferred to Gumeracha , Butler sought to tame Playford 's aggressive oratory approach towards the LCL cabinet by offering him a ministry . Playford entered the cabinet in March 1938 as the Commissioner of Crown Lands , and held portfolios in Irrigation and Repatriation . The new frontbencher subsequently adopted a more moderate style of parliamentary conduct . Butler abandoned the Premiership in November to seek election for the federal seat of Wakefield , a Liberal stronghold that had been vacated by the death of sitting member Charles Hawker in an aviation accident . Despite having been in cabinet for only a few months , Playford was unanimously elected as the new leader of the LCL by his peers , and thus became the 33rd Premier of South Australia . Like Butler , he also served as Treasurer of South Australia . Regarded as a compromise candidate who was able to appeal to both urban and rural voters , it was thought that Playford would only be a transitional leader before someone else took over the Liberal leadership , but he was to remain for almost 27 years . 
 Upon his ascension , Playford headed a minority government ; the LCL only held 15 of the 39 seats in the lower house . The balance of power was held by 13 mostly conservative independents . Many had gained from discontent over Butler 's relatively liberal social stances , so Playford sought to assuage them by having his LCL colleagues refrain from upsetting social conservatives . He also used the threat of an early election to deter the independents from stalling his initiatives — with their lack of party infrastructure and funding , they would be the most vulnerable to election campaigns . 
 = = World War II = = 
 Playford became a wartime Premier in 1939 when Australia , as part of the British Empire , entered World War II . Later in the war , cut off from traditional suppliers of manufactures , the country was forced to create its own . Armaments and munitions factories needed to be created to supply the war effort , and Playford was vociferous in advocating South Australia as the perfect location for these . It was far from the battlegrounds and had the most efficient labour force in the nation . British Tube Mills opened a mill in the inner @-@ northern suburbs . Ammunition factories were built in the northern and western suburbs of Adelaide , as well as in some smaller installations in regional centres , and construction on a shipyard began in Whyalla . Having strenuously opposed a construction of a pipeline to pump water from Morgan in the River Murray to Whyalla for the steelworks and blast furnace there before his ascension to the premiership , Playford oversaw approval of the Morgan @-@ Whyalla pipeline in 1940 and its completion in 1944 . He also reversed his previous opposition to Butler 's pine plantation and sawmill program , authorising an expansion of the program in the state 's southeast . 
 Salisbury , then a dormitory town to the north of Adelaide , became a defence centre ; the shipyards at Whyalla began launching corvettes in 1941 just as Japan entered the war . All of these developments were done under Playford 's watch , with most of the factories being built by the Department of Manpower and the South Australian Housing Trust . In Woodville in western Adelaide , a large plant for <unk> cotton was built . The explosives factory at Salisbury was converted into an aerospace research facility after the war , as various companies worked on matters related to rocket testing at Woomera in the state 's far north ; the Salisbury complex became the second largest employer of South Australians for a period after the war . The munitions factory in the western suburb of Hendon was later converted into a plant for the electrical appliance firm Philips and at its peak employed more than three thousand people . 
 In order for these developments to occur , Playford personally had to attend to the bureaucracy that stood in the way . He confronted obstinate public service workers , and successfully negotiated with the heads of private companies . But it was negotiations with the Federal Government that were to prove the hardest . In his time as Premier , Playford was to confront seven different Prime Ministers : Lyons , Page , Menzies , Fadden , Curtin , Forde and Chifley . Strangely , he enjoyed best relations with the <unk> Chifley , and had a poor rapport with his fellow conservative , Menzies . During the wartime years , Menzies ' reluctance to meet with Playford initially hampered industrial efforts , but Playford 's other federal colleagues made sure that deals could be made . 
 To Playford 's advantage there was usually a disproportionate number of South Australians in federal cabinets , both Liberal and Labor . This clout , combined with his own intensive and unconventional negotiating tactics , made sure that South Australia regularly got more federal funds than it would have been allocated otherwise . This was to Menzies ' chagrin : " Tom wouldn 't know intellectual honesty if he met it on the end of a pitch fork but he does it all for South Australia , not for himself , so I forgive him . " By the time of his departure from power , Playford gained the reputation of being " a good South Australian but a very bad Australian " , and for using " threats to bully recalcitrant Prime Ministers " . For his part , Playford remained unrepentant , claiming that federal authorities had infringed the constitution of Australia and had consistent exercised powers over the states that were not rightfully theirs . Playford accused the High Court of Australia of helping the federal parliament under Curtin to legislate to give itself a monopoly on the acquisition of income tax , which he claimed was contrary to the intention of the constitution to prevent excessive centralisation of power in the federal government . In 1958 , he threatened to take the federal government to the High Court , which led to South Australia being given more compensation under the River Murray Waters Agreement for the loss of water from the Snowy River . Three years later he went to the High Court in an attempt to have Canberra pay for the standardisation of the gauge on the Broken Hill @-@ Port Pirie railway . 
 During the war , two state elections were held , in 1941 and 1944 . In the 1941 election , there was a significant decrease in the independent vote , and both the Labor Party and the LCL made gains , with Playford forming the LCL 's first majority government . This was in large part due to the LCL 's shift to the right on social issues to usurp the independents ' appeal . In 1942 , compulsory voting ( but not enrolment ) was introduced , and first took effect at the 1944 election , with an increase in voter turnout from 51 % to 89 % . Again Playford won with a one @-@ seat LCL majority , hanging on with the help of the malapportioned electoral system . 
 Power and water schemes were expanded to be able to cope with the industrial development occurring . The state was at a disadvantage in that it was completely reliant on imports for its fuel supply . South Australia 's near @-@ monopoly electricity supplier , the Adelaide Electricity Supply Company ( AESC ) , was reluctant to build up coal reserves in case of a transportation problem . They ran on coal that was shipped over from New South Wales ( NSW ) , where the mines were inefficient and plagued by communist @-@ agitated industrial strife . Playford demanded that supplies be built up so the factories could keep producing ; he managed to secure eight months worth of coal reserves from NSW , but even that began to dwindle due to the continued industrial action . Coal supplies were ordered from South Africa in desperation , at Playford 's behest . The frustration he experienced while dealing with the AESC would later prove disastrous to the company as the Premier took action against them . 
 = = Industrialisation = = 
 The AESC continued to snub the government . Playford advocated the use of brown coal from the South Australian Leigh Creek mine to avoid supply complications , and even made into law a bill encouraging its use . He also championed the development of the town and the expansion of the mine , which had been dormant for several decades , to ease the state 's dependency on imported coal . Much state and federal government money was invested in the scheme , the town infrastructure was built , and the production started in February 1944 . Shortly afterwards , the AESC responded by buying new boilers which would only be able to the more productive black coal . With more conflicts ensuing , and even with the company slowly relenting , Playford did not stop his struggle . A Royal Commission in March 1945 was appointed to ascertain a solution between the two parties , and presented its report in August with a recommendation that the AESC be nationalised . A few months later , Playford 's stance received a boost when heavy strikes in New South Wales forced shutdowns in South Australia that saw thousands of labourers out of work . By then at the head of the only conservative government in the nation , when Playford requested commonwealth funds to assist in the nationalisation of the AESC Prime Minister Chifley responded with glee and enthusiasm . On 11 October , he presented a bill to Parliament to nationalise the AESC and create the Electricity Trust of South Australia . 
 Labor , astonished that such an action was to come from a Liberal Premier , resolutely supported the bill , guaranteeing it passage through the House of Assembly 29 – 6 , the only dissenters being LCL members . However , the Legislative Council was dominated by economic conservatives , fierce adherents of free enterprise and opponents of what they considered to be undue government intervention in the economy . The LCL councillors tried to have the bill watered down to allow merely for government control of AESC for a brief period . In the Council , where suffrage was reliant upon wage and property requirements , the ALP only held four seats out of twenty , and only five LCL members supported the nationalisation . Thus , on 7 November , the bill failed to pass and it was not put to the Parliament again until 1946 . On 6 April , after months of campaigning on Playford 's part , he managed to change the mind of MLC Jack Bice , and the bill passed . The Electricity Trust of South Australia was formed , and was to become a major aid to post @-@ war industrialisation . 
 The decision to nationalise AESC and develop Leigh Creek proved to be prescient . In early 1947 , mines in New South Wales were again crippled by communist @-@ inspired strikes . The worst strike came in 1949 , forcing Chifley to send in the armed forces to extract coal . While the other states had to suffer industrial power rationing and thus reduced manufacturing output and more unemployment , South Australia managed to escape as the miners at Leigh Creek worked around the clock . Within four years the mine was operating at a surplus and the town was further rewarded with federal funding . From 1947 until the end of Playford 's leadership in 1965 , the output of the mine increased tenfold to almost two million tons a year . Transport infrastructure was improved , European immigrant workers were recruited , and twin power plants at Port Augusta were completed in 1960 and named after the premier . The new plants exclusively used Leigh Creek coal and by 1970 , the whole state was self @-@ sufficient for electricity . <unk> and the mine were generating enough revenue to maintain the town — sometimes dubbed Uncle Tom 's Baby — and mine of Leigh Creek and making a profit as well . From 1946 to 1965 , the proportion of South Australians connected to electricity increased from 70 to 96 % . 
 The nationalisation of the AESC was the most prominent manifestation of Playford 's economic pragmatism ; although ideologically a free enterprise man like his colleagues , he saw ideology as secondary if it got in the way of his objectives . He had little time for those who objected to plans that were for the betterment of South Australia , despite these plans being contrary to particular interpretations of party ideology . The struggle for Leigh Creek was seen as a critical point in Playford 's premiership ; a second legislative failure was seen as being potentially fatal for Playford 's leadership of his party , but the successful passage of the bill enhanced his image and gave <unk> enduring control over his party for the rest of his career , although it angered some of the staunch LCL conservatives in the upper house for some time ; a significant number of them refused to talk to Playford for a substantial period of time thereafter . 
 During the post @-@ war boom , the methods used to set up business in South Australia were unique . Playford 's government would charge little to no business tax , supply cheap electricity , land and water , and have the Housing Trust build the factories and workers ' homes . Consumer goods and automotive factories were created in the northern and western suburbs of Adelaide ; mining , steel and shipbuilding industries appeared in the ' Iron Triangle ' towns of Whyalla , Port Pirie and Port Augusta . Prices and wages were kept relatively low to enable continued investment , and South Australia was slower than the other states to abolish these wartime measures to increase its industrial competitiveness . The government initiatives managed to overcome the large logistic burden , as Adelaide and South Australia were far from the markets where the goods would be sold . 
 The Housing Trust was a key plank in Playford 's campaign to keep costs low and promote investment . By providing cheap housing , workers could also be persuaded to accept lower salaries , therefore keeping production costs down . In 1940 , Playford introduced the Housing Improvement Act to parliament , having seen the benefits of the Housing Trust 's activities . The main aims of the legislation were " to improve the adverse housing conditions " by replacing " insanitary , old , crowded , or obsolete dwelling houses " with better @-@ quality buildings — at the time many older residences in the city centre were made of corrugated iron and many areas were slum @-@ like . The law forced landlords to provide a minimum standard of housing and enacted rent controls , setting a maximum rent for various houses ; at the time many landlords bought large numbers of low @-@ quality dwellings and charged tenants exorbitant prices . It also expanded the role of the Housing Trust , potentially undercutting the rentier class . Labor were taken aback by Playford 's move , as this was the start of a trend whereby the nominally conservative government pursued policies that were more left @-@ wing than other Labor governments across the country . After expressing shock at Playford 's " loving kindness to the poor and distressed " , Labor helped to get the legislation — which threatened the interests of the landlord class that traditionally supported the LCL — passed into law . During one 15 @-@ year period , Housing Trust rents were not increased once despite steady inflation . 
 Playford served briefly during 1955 as Attorney @-@ General of South Australia . 
 Many of the methods that Playford used were described by economic conservatives as ' socialism ' , drawing opposition from within his own party , especially in the Legislative Council . It is even said that the Liberal leader in that chamber — Sir Collier Cudmore — once referred to Playford as a ' Bolshevik ' . The unique economic intervention earned Playford scorn from his own colleagues , but the Labor movement was much more receptive . Indeed , Labor leader Mick O 'Halloran would dine with Playford on a weekly basis to discuss the development of the state , and the pair were on close personal terms . At a dinner party , O 'Halloran remarked that " I wouldn 't want to be Premier even if I could be . Tom Playford can often do more for my own voters than I could if I were in his shoes . " O 'Halloran 's lack of ambition was mocked in a political cartoon , but the Labor leader took the piece as a compliment and had it framed and put on display . As Playford had more opposition from his LCL colleagues in the upper house than Labor , O 'Halloran was often described as the premier 's ' junior partner " . Playford called Labor " our Opposition " , in comparison to opponents in his party , which he decried as being " critical without being helpful " . This cooperative nature of party politics would not change until Don Dunstan 's prominence in the late 1950s , when Playford would be assailed not for his economics , but for his government 's comparatively low expenditure on public services such as education and healthcare . 
 Large projects were commenced . The city of Elizabeth was built by the Housing Trust in Adelaide 's north , for the production of GM Holden motor vehicles . <unk> mainly by working @-@ class English migrants , it was , before its eventual economic and social decline , a showcase of successful city planning . 
 Playford also successfully coaxed Chrysler to stay in Adelaide and expand its operations . The Housing Trust sold the <unk> Park where the car manufacturing plant was set up , and helped to install railyards , electricity and water infrastructure there , as it had done at Elizabeth . By the time Playford left office , Holden and Chrysler employed around 11 @,@ 000 workers , 11 % of the state 's manufacturing employees . After earlier failed attempts to bring a tyre factory to Adelaide , the plans to build the Port <unk> oil refinery — which would produce hydrocarbons used in synthetic rubber — in the early 1960s were enough to convince both a Dunlop Rubber @-@ Olympic joint venture and SA Rubber Mills ( later Bridgestone Australia ) to start manufacturing operations . 
 Playford also sought to involve South Australia in uranium mining , which he saw as both a means of providing electricity for powering industrial development , and as a means of <unk> the state in the anti @-@ communist alliance in the midst of the Cold War . He was supported his venture by federal subsidies and concessions . After the deposits at Mount Painter were deemed to be unsuitable , the focus turned to Radium Hill and significant state government money was invested into research . State and federal laws were changed to allow for mining at Radium Hill and exportation of uranium ; Playford also publicly advocated for nuclear power . Rewards were offered for the discovery of uranium deposits , but no suitable reserves were found , so Radium Hill was the only project to proceed . The Korean War had just erupted , and the American government was anxious to secure uranium for nuclear weapons . Playford was able to exploit this to secure " the easiest and most generous [ deal ] in the history of uranium negotiations " . It was the highest purchase of uranium the Americans made during the Cold War and they contributed £ 4m for infrastructure development . Mining started in November 1954 , and lasted for the seven @-@ year @-@ period of the contract with the Americans . Almost a million tonnes of ore had been mined , amounting to nearly £ 16m in contracts . Radium Hill had made a profit but was closed as higher @-@ grade alternatives were discovered elsewhere and a new buyer could not be found . Playford also attempted to have the Australian Atomic Energy Commission based in the state , but failed ; the nation 's only nuclear reactor was built at Lucas Heights on the outskirts of Sydney . 
 When Playford left office in 1965 , South Australia 's population had doubled from 600 @,@ 000 in the late 1930s to 1 @.@ 1 million , the highest proportionate rate among the states . The economy had done likewise , and personal wealth had increased at the same rate , second only to Victoria . During Playford 's 27 years in power , employment in manufacturing in South Australia had increased by 173 % ; Western Australia was in second place with 155 % growth , while the national average was during the period was 129 % . The state 's share of Australia 's manufacturing sector increased from 7 @.@ 7 to 9 @.@ 2 % . However , there was criticism that Playford had diversified secondary industries enough , that industrial growth was beginning to lag the other states in the last decade of his leadership , and that the reliance on automotive production — Holden and Chrysler were 15 % of the economy — made the economy more vulnerable to shocks in the future . Playford was also criticised for his informal style and tendency to rely on a small circle of public servants , sidelining much of his cabinet and not leaving a legacy of industrial infrastructure . Blewett and Jaensch said that Playford 's " ad hoc methods and personalised administration " had worked well but said he needed a " more sophisticated " approach in later years , and was unable to adapt . 
 = = Don Dunstan = = 
 At the 1953 election , the young lawyer Don Dunstan was elected to the House of Assembly as the Labor member for Norwood , ousting the LCL incumbent . Playford had landed unexpectedly in his role as the undisputed leader of his party , while Dunstan was , from the start of his parliamentary career , a stand @-@ out among his own ranks and an excellent orator in parliament . Dunstan and Playford were each other 's principal antagonists . 
 Playford , used to cooperating with Labor leaders more than attacking them , sensed Dunstan 's promise and , predicting that one day Dunstan would be at the helm , attempted to establish bonds . So , after a late session of parliament at night , Playford would give Dunstan a lift home in his car . As Dunstan 's home was situated on George Street , Norwood , it was only a small deviance from Playford 's normal route to his home in Norton Summit . The topics that the two discussed were not ever completely revealed , yet Playford , according to Dunstan , would talk to him in a paternalistic manner . The two built up somewhat of a relationship and developed a respect for each other , but due to the strength of their respective views ( Playford was a liberal conservative , Dunstan a libertarian socialist ) , did not establish the same type of bond that Playford had with earlier Laborites . 
 To face an opposition that was becoming uncooperative was not what Playford has expected , or could satisfactorily handle . Before the effect Dunstan had on Parliament , Playford would meet with Labor leaders to discuss bills , and ensure bipartisan support in the House of Assembly for them ; there was little discordance on matters . The belligerents were previously only rural independent members . 
 Even while the economic boom continued , the LCL vote gradually declined after 1941 . The LCL never held more than 23 seats during Playford 's tenure due to being almost nonexistent in Adelaide . With few exceptions , its support in the capital was limited to the eastern crescent and the Holdfast Bay area even at the height of Playford 's power . It relied on favourable preferences from minor parties and independents and the malapportioned electoral system in order to stay in office . It did , however , win a majority of actual votes , barring 1944 and 1953 , on a two @-@ party @-@ preferred basis until 1962 . Labor had begun to combat the Playmander by directing its efforts at individual seats , and abandoning a statewide campaign . Slowly , seats were whittled away — the loss of Norwood in 1953 was followed by the losses of Murray , Millicent and Frome in 1956 , and Mt Gambier and Wallaroo in 1957 – 8 by @-@ elections . Playford 's dominance over the party and his ignorance of the wishes of its broad membership base brought about a degree of disillusionment , and the party machine began to decay . The dominance stopped the emergence of a new generation of political talent , and had a " stultifying " effect . Although the Playmander ensured his ongoing electoral success , and Playford was credited with South Australia 's economic success , the LCL polled a lower percentage than the corresponding Liberal government at federal level . 
 During this period , Prime Minister Menzies recommended that Playford be bestowed with a form of honours . Playford 's wish was to be made a privy councillor , yet , while entirely possible , if granted it would lead to demands from other state Premiers . Playford 's grandfather had declined a KCMG , and Playford himself did initially , but under the influence of Menzies he eventually accepted the honour and was knighted in 1957 . 
 = = Max Stuart trial = = 
 In December 1958 , an event that initially had nothing to do with Playford , occurred , and eventually intensified into a debacle that was regarded as a turning point in his premiership and marked the end of his rule . 
 A young girl was found raped and murdered , and Max Stuart , an Aborigine , was convicted and sentenced to be executed only a month later , on the basis of a confession gained during interrogation , although he had protested his innocence in pidgin English . Stuart 's lawyer claimed that the confession was forced , and appeals to the Supreme and High Courts were dismissed . A linguist who investigated the case thought that the style of English in the confession was inconsistent with Stuart 's background and speech . This aroused disquiet and objections against the fairness of the trial among an increasing amount of legal academics and judges , and The News brought much attention to Stuart 's plight with an aggressive , tabloid @-@ style campaign . Soon , the case attracted international attention , some on the assumption that the legal system was racist . The former High Court Justice Sir John Latham also spoke out . 
 During this time , Stuart 's execution had been delayed on multiple occasions . On 6 July , Playford and the Executive Council decided not to reprieve Stuart , and he was due to be executed the next day , but an appeal to the Privy Council in London stalled proceedings again . However , this also failed . Labor then tried to introduce legislation to stall the hanging . 
 Amid loud outcry , Playford started a Royal Commission to review the case . However , two of the Commissioners appointed , Chief Justice Mellis Napier and Justice Geoffrey Reed , had already been involved , Napier as presiding judge in the Full Court appeal and Reed as the trial judge . This provoked worldwide controversy with claims of bias from the likes of the President of the Indian Bar Council , the esteemed British judge Norman Birkett , the leader of the United Kingdom Liberal Party Jo Grimond and former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee . Years later , Playford admitted that he erred in his appointments of Reed and Napier and that it could have shaken public confidence on the fairness of the hearing . 
 The Royal Commission began its work and the proceedings were followed closely and eagerly debated by the public . As Playford had not shown an inclination to commute Stuart 's sentence , Dunstan introduced a bill to abolish capital punishment . The vote was split along party lines and was thus defeated , but Dunstan used the opportunity to attack the Playmander with much effect in the media , portraying the failed legislation as an unjust triumph of a malapportioned minority who had a vengeance mentality over an electorally repressed majority who wanted a humane outcome . 
 Amid the continuing uproar , Playford decided to grant clemency . He gave no reason for his decision . The Royal Commission continued its work and concluded that the guilty verdict was sound . Although a majority of those who spoke out against the handling of the matter thought that Stuart was probably guilty , the events provoked heated and bitter debate in South Australian society and destabilised Playford 's administration . According to Ken Inglis , " most of the responsibility for letting the ... general controversy ... [ lies with ] Sir Thomas Playford and his ministers ... [ Theirs ] was the response of men who were convinced that the affairs of the society were in good hands , and that only the naive and the mischievous would either doubt this general truth or challenge any particular application of it . " Blewett and Jaensch said that the " clumsy handling " of the case was a manifestation of " the inevitable hubris of men too long in power " . 
 = = Political decline = = 
 Playford was confronted with an economic recession when he went into the election of 1962 . Earlier , in late 1961 , the federal Liberal @-@ Country coalition suffered a 13 @-@ seat swing and barely held onto government . Menzies ' majority was slashed from 32 to 2 . In the 1962 election , the Labor Party gained 54 @.@ 3 % of the two @-@ party @-@ preferred vote to the LCL 's 45 @.@ 7 percent . However , due to the Playmander , this was only enough to net Labor 19 seats to the LCL 's 18 . The balance of power rested with two independents , Tom Stott and Percy Quirke . On election night , it was thought that Playford 's long tenure was over , but he did not concede . There was speculation that Playford would let an inexperienced Labor form a minority government as the economic difficulties might make it a poisoned chalice . After a week of silence he said he would not resign , and would see how the independents lined up when parliament reconvened . Labor needed the support of only one of the independents to make its leader , Frank Walsh , premier , while the LCL needed them both for a 10th term in government They swung their support behind Playford and allowed his government to continue for another term ; in return Quirke joined the LCL and was appointed to cabinet , while Stott was appointed speaker . Nonetheless , much media fanfare was made of the result , and of the detrimental effects of the ' Playmander ' . Walsh declared the result " a travesty of electoral injustice " and lobbied the governor to not invite Playford to form government , to no avail . 
 Electoral legislation remained unchanged . Labor introduced bills for reform , but these were defeated in both houses of Parliament . The premier introduced electoral legislation that would have entrenched his government further than under the Playmander . As electoral legislation was part of the South Australian constitution , it required an absolute parliamentary majority ( 20 seats , under the current system ) to be changed . The LCL relied on Stott in the house , so Labor could obstruct changes by keeping members away and forcing a pair . 
 While the political situation was becoming increasingly untenable , Playford himself continued with his job of building the state . Plans for Adelaide 's future development , including a road transport plan , were commissioned . Playford saw a modern road transport system as crucial to continuing the industrialisation of the state , and motor vehicle registrations , which had increased by a factor of 50 since the end of the war , required road expansion . The Metropolitan Plan , a 1962 publication of the Town Planning Committee called for the construction of 56 km of freeways and speculated that three times as much would be needed in future . However , most of this never materialised ; only the South Eastern Freeway was approved during Playford 's term , and construction just after he left office . A more ambitious plan for a freeway system was commissioned , but the study was not completed until after Playford 's departure and was scrapped by later governments due to widespread public objections to the proposed demolition of entire suburbs for interchanges . Playford was criticised for seeing roads only from an engineering and utilitarian standpoint and neglecting the social and community effects of such building . The state 's population hit in the one million mark in 1963 and the Port <unk> oil refinery was completed . Adelaide 's water supply was increased and the pipeline from Morgan to Whyalla was duplicated . 
 = = = Changing policy expectations = = = 
 The economic success of Playford 's administration also fuelled the rapid growth of an immigrant , working and middle @-@ class whose social expectations differed markedly from his traditionalist stance , loosening his grip on power . The demographic changes brought on by Playford 's successful economic policies increased the number of people who had rather different views to his on matters such as education , health , arts , the environment , gambling and alcohol . Blewett and Jaensch said " it can be argued that the development he fostered ultimately brought about his own political demise . " The state 's social fabric became more complex , but Playford was unable or unwilling to adapt to their more complicated <unk> desires . 
 Playford was known for his lack of funding for education , regarding it as a distraction from the industrialisation of the state . During this period , only the financial elite could afford a university education , and less than one percent of the population had a degree by the time Playford left office . Despite this , university attendance more than tripled , and secondary and technical school enrolments more than quintupled , far outstripping the 77 % population growth during his time in office , as incomes — and hence access to education — rose steadily as the need for teenagers to find a job to help support the family declined . Although the government expenditure on education increased from 10 to 17 % from 1945 to 1959 , the number of teachers had only doubled by the time he left office , so class sizes increased . The premier 's education policy was criticised for being too conservative and lacking in innovation . Playford also did not allow the teaching of languages other than English in schools on the grounds that " English is good enough " . Howell said that Playford 's " prejudices ... served to limit the capacity of many able South Australians to participate in trade negotiations or diplomatic work . " University academics and Public Examinations Board called for the inclusion of biology and the broadening of senior high school curriculum to better prepare students for tertiary education , but were rebuffed . In 1963 the minimum school leaving age was raised to 15 , but this was still lower than most states in Australia . 
 The premier was also known for his suspicious attitude towards the University of Adelaide and tertiary education in general ; many of their graduates moved interstate and he thought that scientific research done within the state was not sufficiently focussed on practical applications . The antipathy was mutual and originated from Playford 's days as a backbencher , when he formally complained to the university about a lecture given by a political science professor about Marxism . Playford saw the discussion of such a topic as misuse of public funds for promotion of socialism , and his continued outspokenness about political curricula angered academics , who saw it as an attempt to curtail intellectual freedom . One vice @-@ chancellor was angered to the point of telling a senior public servant that Playford " an uneducated country colonial " . Playford also opposed the establishment of a second university in the state as the population increased . While academics thought that another institution would bring more academic diversity , Playford thought this would increase competition for resources , so he allowed only a new campus of the University of Adelaide , which became Flinders University after his departure from power . In his defence , Playford pointed that he had never rejected a funding request since the state took responsibility for universities in 1951 , and that his proportional expenditure on tertiary education matched that of other states . 
 Healthcare in South Australia also lagged behind during Playford 's rule . Hospitals were overcrowded and the Royal Adelaide Hospital 's beds were crammed together with a density twice higher than developed world standards . After a media expose and criticism from health sector professionals , two more hospitals were built in the western and northern suburbs of Adelaide respectively . Playford 's attitude to social welfare also led to dismay . He said that it was up to charity , not the government , to support orphans and disadvantaged sectors of the community so that they could enjoy a better standard of living . Spending on social welfare lagged behind that in other states , and legislative reforms on this front were non @-@ existent . 
 Arts , which Playford showed no personal interest in , and regarded as " frills not fundamentals " and " non @-@ productive " , became a more prominent issue among the emerging middle @-@ class . For his attitude , Playford was often mocked by his opponents and critics for his " philistinism " . The Nation <unk> quipped that " It is axiomatic that the Premier draws his orchard spray gun at the mention of the word ' culture ' " . Sir Arthur Rymill , an LCL member of the upper house , criticised the demolition of the Theatre Royal , lobbied Playford for increased funding without success , pointing out that world @-@ class performing arts venues were generally subsidised by the government . <unk> Morphett , a former State President of the LCL , quipped that if Playford " had wanted to convert the Art Gallery on North Terrace into a power house he would have done it without hesitation " . In the 1960s , the Adelaide Festival started , while the Australian Dance Theatre and the State Theatre Company of South Australia was founded in the capital , with minimal assistance from Playford 's government . The festival was well @-@ received despite the effect of censorship in a state well known for social conservatism . With the success of the festival , public interest in arts increased , and with increasing calls for government funding , particularly from Dunstan , Playford finally agreed to fund the " non @-@ productive area " in 1963 by allocating funding for the eventual building of the Festival Centre . 
 Playford 's focus on development above all also led to controversy over heritage preservation . In 1955 , the City of Adelaide legislated to rezone much of the city centre from residential to commercial land for office blocks . Many older houses , as well as the Exhibition Building were demolished , sparking calls by many parliamentarians , Dunstan prominent among them , for Playford to intercede to preserve the historic character of the city . The premier was unmoved , backing the redevelopment and claiming that many of the demolished structures were " substandard " . 
 While Playford was known for his use of price controls to restrain the price of living and therefore attract blue @-@ collar workers to settle in the state and fuel industrialisation , South Australia also lagged behind in consumer protection laws in regards to quality control . It was believed that he was opposed to compulsory pasteurisation and other quality standards on milk to avoid offending his rural support base . Playford 's reluctance to introduce regulations for tradesmen such as builders , electricians and plumbers were often seen to have resulted from his being an avid do @-@ it @-@ yourself handyman . 
 The conservatism of the Liberal and Country League did not keep up with the expectations of a modern @-@ day society . There was dissatisfaction with the restrictive drinking laws ; environmentalists campaigned for more natural parks and more ' green ' practices ; police powers stood strong , ' no loitering ' legislation remained in place ; gambling was almost completely restricted . The constituents who loudly demanded changes were mostly immigrants and their offspring , used to more libertine conditions in their countries of origin . Their homes , usually built by the Housing Trust , sprawled into ' rural ' electoral districts that were controlled by the League . Labor pledged to introduce social legislation to meet their demands ; Playford , who did not drink , smoke or gamble , had no interest in doing so . His own candidates knew that the 1965 election would be unwinnable if Playford did not budge . The economy was still going strong and incomes were still increasing , so the Premier did not change his position on social reform . 
 = = Fall from power = = 
 Playford went into the 1965 election confident that he would build upon his previous result . Labor was continuing its practice of concentrating on individual seats : this time the effort was invested in the electorates of Barossa and Glenelg . In Barossa , northern Adelaide urban sprawl was overflowing into an otherwise rural and conservative electorate ; in Glenelg , a younger generation of professionals and their families were settling . On election day , 6 March , both seats fell to Labor with substantial swings . The LCL lost power for the first time in 35 years . In seats that were contested by both parties , Labor led on the primary vote with 52 @.@ 7 to 43 @.@ 3 % . Playford stayed up on the night to see the result , and conceded defeat at midnight . He appeared calm when announcing the loss to the public , but wept when he told his family of it . Playford had been premier for 26 years and 126 days . 
 After the loss , there were calls for Playford to be offered the post of Governor of South Australia or Governor @-@ General of Australia , but nothing came of that . Playford continued to lead the LCL opposition for a further one and a half years until he relinquished the leadership . In the subsequent ballot , Steele Hall , a small farmer like Playford , won and led the LCL to victory at the following election with the Playmander still in place . Contrary to perceptions , Playford was loath to favour or groom a successor , and he did not publicly hint at whom he voted for in the leadership ballot ; there was speculation that the former premier may have been one of those who abstained from the vote . Playford retired from politics at the same time , presumably for reasons of age , but stated that " I couldn 't cope with the change in the attitudes of some MPs , even some in the highest places ... I found I could no longer cope with the change ... I can 't handle a liar who doesn 't turn a hair while he 's lying ... I decided I couldn 't take it any longer " . 
 = = Retirement = = 
 Playford retired from Parliament with a pension of $ 72 a week ; he had resisted giving higher pensions to Ministers or longer @-@ serving MPs throughout his tenure . Regardless of what people thought of the Playmander , Playford was held in high regard for his integrity ; during his premiership , there were no complaints of corruption or government largesse . Playford also prohibited his ministers from sitting on the board of directors of public companies or owning shares , lest they became conflicted in their decision @-@ making . He returned to his orchard at Norton Summit , and took a continued interest in South Australian politics , but did not typically raise his opinions publicly ; he was still consulted in private by Liberals up until his death , however . His closeness to Labor figures did not end either , offering advice to their new South Australian ministers , and assisting in a memorial to the former Labor Prime Minister John Curtin . In line with his reputation for promoting his state , Playford also privately lobbied the Liberal government in Canberra on behalf of the state Labor administration for more infrastructure funding . In 1977 , when Don Dunstan celebrated his 50th birthday party , Playford was the only Liberal invited . There he socialised with former and future Labor Prime Ministers Gough Whitlam and Bob Hawke , Dunstan , and other Laborites . 
 He served on the boards of the Electricity Trust and the Housing Trust , among others . Here , unused to not being in absolute control , and having little specific scientific knowledge , he occasionally stumbled in his decisions . This also created difficulties with the other board members , who were reluctant to disagree with their former boss , regardless of their expertise . But his thrift , a theme throughout his Premiership , did not abate ; he was constantly forcing the trusts to use cost @-@ saving methods and old vehicles for their work . This extended to his family property ; he vigorously opposed his son 's desire to install a new irrigation system in the orchard . 
 Playford had begun experiencing serious health problems since his first heart attack in June 1971 , and underwent treatment and procedures for ten years . On 16 June 1981 , he experienced a massive heart attack and died . Two days later his memorial service was held at the Flinders Street Baptist Church . The funeral procession carried his coffin from the city , along Magill and Old Norton Summit Roads where thousands turned out to pay their respects , to the Norton Summit cemetery where his forebears had been buried . There his gravestone was emblazoned with the phrase : ' a good man who did good things ' . 
 = Operation Turkey Buzzard = 
 Operation Turkey Buzzard , also known as Operation Beggar , was a British supply mission to North Africa that took place between March and August 1943 , during the Second World War . The mission was undertaken by No. 2 Wing , Glider Pilot Regiment and No. 295 Squadron Royal Air Force , prior to the Allied invasion of Sicily . Unusually , the mission was known by different names in different branches of the British Armed Forces : the British Army called the operation " Turkey Buzzard " , while in the Royal Air Force it was known as " Beggar " . 
 The mission involved Royal Air Force Handley Page Halifax bombers towing Airspeed Horsa gliders 3 @,@ 200 miles ( 5 @,@ 100 km ) from England to Tunisia . The British Horsas were needed to complement the smaller American Waco gliders , which did not have the capacity required for the operations planned by the 1st Airborne Division . 
 During the mission one Halifax @-@ and @-@ Horsa combination was shot down by German Focke Wulf Condor long @-@ range patrol aircraft . Altogether five Horsas and three Halifaxes were lost , but twenty @-@ seven Horsas arrived in Tunisia in time to participate in the invasion of Sicily . Although this supply operation was a success , few of the gliders made it to their landing zones in Sicily during the two British airborne operations that followed , many becoming casualties of the weather conditions or anti @-@ aircraft gunfire . 
 = = Background = = 
 By December 1942 , with Allied forces advancing through Tunisia , the North African campaign was coming to a close ; victory in North Africa being imminent , discussions began between the Allies over what their next objective should be . Many Americans argued for an immediate invasion of France , while the British believed that it should be the island of Sardinia , as did General Dwight D. Eisenhower . In January 1943 the Prime Minister , Winston Churchill , and the President of the United States , Franklin Delano Roosevelt , met at the Casablanca conference and settled the debate : the island of Sicily would be the Allies ' next objective . The invasion and occupation of Sicily would benefit the Allies by opening Mediterranean sea routes for Allied shipping and allowing Allied bombers to operate from airfields that were much closer to mainland Italy and Germany . The codename Operation Husky was eventually decided on for the invasion , and planning began in February . The British Eighth Army , under the command of General Bernard Montgomery , would land on the south @-@ eastern corner of the island and advance north to the port of Syracuse , while the US Seventh Army , commanded by General George Patton , would land on the south coast and move towards the port of Palermo on the western corner of the island . The landings would be made simultaneously along a 100 @-@ mile ( 160 @-@ km ) stretch of the island 's south @-@ eastern coastline . 
 For their part , the 1st Airborne Division was to conduct three brigade @-@ size airborne operations ; the Ponte Grande road bridge south of Syracuse was to be captured by 1st Airlanding Brigade ( Operation Ladbroke ) , the port of Augusta was to be seized by 2nd Parachute Brigade ( Operation Glutton ) , and finally the Primasole Bridge over the River Simeto was to be taken by 1st Parachute Brigade ( Operation Fustian ) . 
 When the plans for the British airborne operations were being discussed , Lieutenant @-@ Colonel George Chatterton , the commander of No. 2 Wing , Glider Pilot Regiment , brought up a problem with the only glider then in theatre , the American Waco CG @-@ 4 , known in British service as the Hadrian : its small size . The Waco 's capacity was only two pilots and thirteen troops , and for cargo either a jeep or an artillery gun but not both together . The plan for Operation Ladbroke involved a coup de main assault on the Ponte Grande Bridge by the 2nd Battalion , South Staffordshire Regiment . Using the Horsa glider , which could carry twenty @-@ seven troops or a jeep and gun together , they could deliver a larger force at the bridge during the initial assault . Chatterton decided he needed around forty Horsas , as well as the American Wacos , for the British missions . 
 = = Mission = = 
 The only Horsa gliders were in England at the time , and transporting them to North Africa would require a tow of 1 @,@ 200 miles ( 1 @,@ 900 km ) over the Atlantic Ocean around the coast of Portugal and Spain , then a further 2 @,@ 000 miles ( 3 @,@ 200 km ) across North Africa to reach Tunisia . No one had ever towed a glider that distance before , and it was not known if it was even possible . To test the concept and prove they had the necessary endurance , Handley Page Halifax bombers of No. 295 Squadron RAF towed Horsa gliders around the coastline of Britain . 
 The mission was given the go @-@ ahead ; the Horsas were modified to jettison their landing gear after takeoff to reduce drag , while the Halifax bombers were modified with long @-@ range fuel tanks fitted in the bomb bays . The pilots for the gliders came from No. 2 Wing , having been left in England when most of the wing departed for Tunisia earlier in the year . An eleven @-@ week period of training followed , during which four crashes killed thirteen men . At a mission conference on 21 May 1943 , hosted by No. 38 Wing RAF , the impossibility of training the bomber crews to tow the gliders and deliver forty gliders to North Africa was discussed . In the end it was decided that as a priority ten bomber crews would be fully trained to deliver around fifteen gliders to North Africa by 21 June . 
 The Halifaxes and Horsas were moved to RAF <unk> in Cornwall , to shorten the distance they would have to travel . Even so , they were left with a ten @-@ hour flight to Sale airport in Morocco . On arrival at Sale the gliders were released to land on a sand @-@ patch alongside the runway . Once on the ground each Horsa was fitted with the spare landing gear it carried inside , and the flight immediately took off again on the next leg of the journey , to Mascara in Algeria . Their journey did not end here ; they left for the final destination , Kairouan Airfield in Tunisia , as soon as possible . During the flight the gliders were provided with three pilots , who had to change around every hour to relieve fatigue . 
 The flights were carried out between 3 June and 7 July ; the first Horsas arrived at <unk> on 28 June , only twelve days before they were to be used in Operation Ladbroke . During the flight from England , for its first three hours over the Bay of Biscay the Halifax – Horsa combination was escorted by RAF Bristol Beaufighters or Mosquito long @-@ range fighter aircraft . They kept to an altitude of 500 ft ( 150 m ) to avoid German radar so the escorting fighters could return safely when short of fuel . The mission was not without its dangers . Four hours into one flight , a Horsa snapped its tow @-@ rope while trying to avoid low cloud and ditched in the sea . Another Horsa and Halifax were discovered by a pair of German Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 200s and shot down . After surviving attacks from Luftwaffe fighter patrols and experiencing often @-@ turbulent weather , a total of twenty @-@ seven Horsas were delivered to North Africa in time for the invasion of Sicily . The total losses during the flights were three Halifaxes and five Horsas , with twenty @-@ one RAF aircrew and seven glider pilots killed . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The first British airborne operation in Sicily began at 18 : 00 on 9 July 1943 , when the gliders transporting the 1st Airlanding Brigade left Tunisia for Sicily . En route they encountered strong winds and poor visibility , and at times were subjected to anti @-@ aircraft fire . To avoid gunfire and searchlights , pilots of the towing aircraft climbed higher or took evasive action . In the confusion surrounding these manoeuvres , some gliders were released too early and sixty @-@ five of them crashed into the sea , drowning around 252 men . Fifty @-@ nine of the remaining gliders missed their landing zones , by as much as 25 miles ( 40 km ) ; others either failed to release and returned to Tunisia or were shot down . Only twelve landed on target ; of these gliders a single Horsa , carrying a platoon of infantry from the Staffords , landed near the Ponte Grande Bridge . Its commander , Lieutenant Withers , swam across the river with half his men to take up positions on the opposite bank . The objective was captured following a simultaneous assault from both ends ; the platoon then dismantled demolition charges that had been fitted to the bridge , and dug in to wait for reinforcement or relief . Another Horsa came down about 200 yards ( 180 m ) from the bridge but exploded on landing , killing all on board . Three of the other Horsas carrying the South Staffordshire Regiment coup @-@ de @-@ main party had landed within 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) of the bridge , their occupants eventually finding their way to the site . 
 The second and last mission — Operation Fustian — began at 19 : 30 on 12 July , when the first aircraft carrying the 1st Parachute Brigade took off from North Africa . Following behind the parachute force were the glider @-@ towing aircraft , comprising twelve Albemarles and seven Halifaxes , towing eleven Horsa and eight Waco gliders . The first glider casualties occurred on takeoff , when two aircraft towing Waco gliders crashed . While en route , one glider was released prematurely by its towing aircraft and crashed into the sea . Arriving over Sicily , having lost the element of surprise , four gliders were shot down by coastal anti @-@ aircraft batteries . By the time the gliders arrived at their landing zones , two hours had lapsed since the start of the parachute landings . With the German defences alerted , only four Horsa gliders managed to land mostly intact , all the others being caught by German machine @-@ gun fire and destroyed on their approach . The surviving Horsas had been carrying three of the brigade 's anti @-@ tank guns , which were now included in their defence of Primosole Bridge . 
 = Restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes = 
 The conservation @-@ restoration of the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel was one of the most significant conservation @-@ restorations of the 20th century . 
 The Sistine Chapel was built by Pope Sixtus IV within the Vatican immediately to the north of St. Peter 's Basilica and completed in about 1481 . Its walls were decorated by a number of Renaissance painters who were among the most highly regarded artists of late 15th century Italy , including Ghirlandaio , Perugino , and Botticelli . The Chapel was further enhanced under Pope Julius II by the painting of the ceiling by Michelangelo between 1508 and 1512 and by the painting of the Last Judgment , commissioned by Pope Clement VII and completed in 1541 , again by Michelangelo . The tapestries on the lowest tier , today best known from the Raphael Cartoons ( painted designs ) of 1515 – 16 , completed the ensemble . 
 Together the paintings make up the greatest pictorial scheme of the Renaissance . Individually , some of Michelangelo 's paintings on the ceiling are among the most notable works of western art ever created . The frescoes of the Sistine Chapel and in particular the ceiling and accompanying lunettes by Michelangelo have been subject to a number of restorations , the most recent taking place between 1980 and 1994 . This most recent restoration had a profound effect on art lovers and historians , as colours and details that had not been seen for centuries were revealed . It has been claimed that as a result " Every book on Michelangelo will have to be rewritten " . Others , such as the art historian James Beck of <unk> International , have been extremely critical of the restoration , saying that the restorers have not realised the true intentions of the artist . This is the subject of continuing debate . 
 = = Previous restorations = = 
 The frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel had a number of interventions prior to the restoration process which was started in 1980 . Initial problems with the ceiling appear to have been caused by water penetrating through the floor above . In about 1547 Paolo Giovio wrote that the ceiling was being damaged by saltpetre and cracks . The effect of saltpetre is to leave a white efflorescence . Gianluigi Colalucci , Head Restorer at the Laboratory for the Restoration of Paintings for Papal Monuments , Museums and Galleries , states in his essay Michelangelo 's colours rediscovered , that the early conservators treated this cosmetically by an application of linseed or walnut oil which had the effect of making the crystalline deposit more transparent . 
 In 1625 , a restoration was carried out by Simone Lagi , the " resident <unk> " , who wiped the ceiling with linen cloths and cleaned it by rubbing it with bread . He occasionally resorted to wetting the bread to remove the more stubborn accretions . His report states that the frescoes " were returned to their previous beauty without receiving any harm " . Colalucci states that Lagi " almost certainly " applied layers of glue @-@ varnish to revive the colours but does not state this in his report in the interests of " preserving the secrets of their [ the restorers ' ] craft " . 
 Between 1710 and 1713 a further restoration was carried out by the painter Annibale Mazzuoli and his son . They used sponges dipped in Greek wine which Colalucci suggests was necessitated by the accretion of grime caused by soot and dirt trapped in the oily deposits of the previous restoration . Mazzuoli then worked over the ceiling , according to Colalucci , strengthening the contrasts by overpainting details . They also repainted some areas the colours of which were lost because of the efflorescence of salts . Areas of repainting were hatched or treated with a linear brushstroke . Colalucci states that Mazzuoli also applied a great deal of glue varnish . The restoration concentrated on the ceiling and less attention was paid to the lunettes . 
 The penultimate restoration was undertaken by the Restoration Laboratory of the Vatican Museum between 1935 – 38 . The scope of the work was to consolidate some areas of the intonaco at the eastern end of the building and partially remove the soot and dirt . 
 = = Modern restoration = = 
 The preliminary experimentation for the modern restoration began in 1979 . The restoration team comprised Gianluigi Colalucci , Maurizio Rossi , <unk> Bonetti , and others , who took as their guidelines the Rules for restoration of works of art as established in 1978 by Carlo Pietrangeli , director of the Vatican 's Laboratory for the Restoration of Pictures , which govern the procedure and methods employed in restoration . An important part of modern restoration procedure , as established by these rules , is the study and analysis of the artwork . Part of this was the recording of every stage of the restoration process . This was done by the photographer Takashi Okamura for Nippon Television Network Corporation . 
 Between June 1980 and October 1984 the first stage of restoration , the work upon Michelangelo 's lunettes , was achieved . The focus of the work then transferred to the ceiling , which was completed in December 1989 and from there to the Last Judgment . The restoration was unveiled by Pope John Paul II on 8 April 1994 . The final stage was the restoration of the wall frescoes , approved in 1994 and unveiled on 11 December 1999 . 
 = = = Aims of the conservators = = = 
 The aims of the conservators were as follows : 
 To study the frescoes progressively , to analyse any discoveries and utilise the appropriate technical responses . 
 To record every step of the operation in archival reports , photographs and film . 
 To use only those procedures and materials which were simple , extensively tested , not harmful , and reversible . 
 To repair cracks and structural damage that threatened the stability of the plaster . 
 To remove layers of grime consisting of candle wax and soot that had been deposited by the burning of candles in the chapel for 500 years . 
 To remove repainting by previous restorers that attempted to counteract the effects of soot and other accretions . 
 To remove oil and animal fat used to counteract salination of areas where water had leaked through . 
 To remove crystalline accretions of salt that had whitened areas where water had leaked through . 
 To conserve surfaces that were in danger of further deterioration because of bubbling , and flaking . 
 To restore sympathetically those areas where deterioration of one sort or another had obliterated details and caused loss of integrity to the whole , for example , filling a bad crack and painting the plaster in a colour matching the original . 
 To maintain in small defined areas a physical historical record of the previous restorations that had taken place . 
 = = = Preparation and approach = = = 
 In 1979 Colalucci undertook a series of experiments to discover the right approach for the restoration of the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel . The investigation began by testing small areas of the wall fresco , Conflict over the Body of Moses by Matteo de Lecce , which had similar physical and chemical attributes to the painting techniques employed on Michelangelo 's frescoes . Trials to find the right solvents were continued on a small portion of the Eleazar and <unk> lunette . 
 Because of the height of the ceiling and the inaccessibility of the ceiling frescoes , the precise nature of the damage and the problems that would be encountered by the restoration team could not be entirely foreseen until after the decision to restore was taken , and the scaffolding was in place . According to Colalucci , the continued scientific analysis and the response of the restorers to the particular problems was an ongoing part of the process , rather than the conservation team deciding on a single treatment for every part of the building . 
 In 1980 the decision to undertake a total restoration was taken . Nippon Television Network Corporation of Japan provided major funding of US $ 4 @.@ 2 million in exchange for the filming rights . 
 = = = Scaffold = = = 
 The team of restorers completed the first stage of the restoration , on the vertical surfaces and curved spandrels around the upper sections of the windows , from aluminium scaffolding projecting from just below the lunettes and using the same holes in the wall that had been made for Michelangelo 's scaffold . When they moved to the ceiling , they likewise employed a system similar to Michelangelo 's , which involved <unk> a shelf outwards from the scaffolding to support a stepped and arched platform . The advantages of modern lightweight materials meant that the platform could be wheeled , facilitating easy movement along the length of the building rather than dismantling and replacement , as Michelangelo had done in 1506 . 
 = = = State of the frescoes = = = 
 The findings of the investigation of 1979 were that the entire interior of the chapel , but particularly the ceiling , was covered with a grime of candle smoke comprising wax and soot ( amorphous carbon ) . Above the windows ( the main source of ventilation ) , the lunettes were particularly stained from the smoke and exhaust fumes of the city , being " much dirtier than the ceiling proper " . The building was a little unstable and had already shifted considerably prior to Michelangelo 's work of 1508 , causing cracking of the ceiling , the crack in the " Judith " pendentive being so large that it had to be filled with bricks and mortar before painting . The upper part of the ceiling provided Michelangelo an irregular surface due to cracks and water seepage . 
 Continued ingress of water from the roof and from unroofed exterior walkways above the ceiling level had caused seepage which carried down salts from the building mortar and deposited them on the ceiling through evaporation . In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift . Although discolouration was a serious problem , bubbling was not , because the thinness and transparency of the paint which Michelangelo employed on the greater part of the ceiling permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface . 
 Earlier restorations had all left their marks on the frescoes . To counteract the whitening caused by salination , animal fat and vegetable oil had been applied , which effectively made the salt crystals transparent , but left a sticky layer that accumulated dirt . An additional problem , most obvious in the small putti which hold the nameplates on the pendentives , was saltpetre seeping through small cracks and appearing as dark rings on the surface . Unlike the white crystalline salt deposits , this could not be removed and the staining was irreversible . Layers of varnish and glue had been applied to many areas . This had darkened and become opaque . Restorers had repainted details over the darkened areas in order to define the features of figures . This was particularly the case for the lunettes , spandrels and lower parts of the pendentives . 
 Close examination revealed that apart from smoky deposits , seepage deposits and structural cracks , the thin " pictorial skin " of Michelangelo 's frescoes was in excellent condition . Colalucci describes Michelangelo as having employed the best possible fresco techniques , as described by Vasari . Most of the paint was well adhered and required little retouching . The plaster , or intonaco , on which the paintings were executed was found , for the most part , to be secure , as previous restorers had fixed it in places with bronze pins . 
 = = = Interventions = = = 
 Prior to the restoration the team spent six months investigating the composition and condition of the frescoes , questioning members of the team that had restored the frescoes in the 1930s and making a detailed scientific study to ascertain which solvents and methods were best employed upon particular painted surfaces . 
 The first stage of the physical restoration was to re @-@ attach any areas of the plaster surface ( which was approximately 5 mm thick ) that were in danger of separating and breaking away . This was done by injecting a <unk> resin . Earlier bronze braces that had been used to stabilise surfaces were removed in those places where they were causing cracking , and the holes filled . Pigments that appeared to be not well adhered were consolidated with the application of diluted acrylic resin . 
 The restorers washed the surfaces using a variety of solvents . Distilled water was used wherever possible to remove soot and dissolve water @-@ soluble gums . <unk> and repainting that had been part of previous later restorations were removed with a gelatinous solvent , applied in several stages for measured times , and washed with distilled water . Salt <unk> of calcium carbonate were treated by the application of a solution of <unk> . The final step was the application of a weak solution of acrylic polymer to consolidate and protect the surface , and further washing . 
 Where necessary some areas were retouched in watercolour , to integrate the pictorial material . These areas are distinctively textured with vertical brushstrokes , not visible from a distance but easily discernible as restoration work when viewed close up . 
 Certain small areas were left unrestored , in order to maintain a physical record of the previous restorations that had taken place , for example , an area left with overpainting and candle wax , and another area demonstrating the attempt to counteract salination with oil . 
 = = Environmental protection of the frescoes = = 
 Once the many layers of candle wax , varnish , and animal glue were removed from the surface of the Sistine Chapel frescoes , they became subject to dangers that could not have been predicted by previous restorers . 
 One of the major dangers to the frescoes is automotive exhaust , and they are also vulnerable to the effects of the crowds of tourists that pass through the chapel every day , bringing with them heat , humidity , dust and bacteria . The clean plaster surfaces are more in danger from these destructive elements than they were when they were covered with a layer of smoky wax . 
 Previously , the Sistine Chapel 's only ventilation was from its windows in the upper level of the walls . To prevent exhaust fumes and wind @-@ blown pollutants from entering , the windows are now permanently closed and an air conditioning system has been installed . The installation is by Carrier of the United Technologies Corporation and was developed with the cooperation of the Vatican 's Office of Technical Services . It has been designed to counteract the various problems specific to the Chapel , in particular the rapid changes of heat and humidity that occur with the admission of the first crowds of tourists each morning and the departure of the last visitors each afternoon . The air conditioning varies not only the heat but also the relative humidity between the summer and winter months so that changes to the atmospheric environment occur gradually . The air near the ceiling is kept at a temperate level , while the air in the lower section of the building is cooler and circulates more rapidly , with the effect that dirt particles fall towards the floor rather than being streamed upwards . Bacteria and chemical pollutants are filtered out . 
 Environmental specifications : 
 Air filtration units : remove particles down to 0 @.@ 1 micrometre 
 Air temperature : 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) in summer , moving gradually to 25 ° C ( 77 ° F ) in winter . 
 Relative humidity at ceiling : 55 % ± 5 % . 
 Sensors : 92 , of which about half are for back @-@ up purposes . 
 <unk> : 26 km ( 85 @,@ 000 ft ) 
 = = Response to the restoration = = 
 = = = Criticism and praise = = = 
 When the restoration of the Sistine Chapel was announced , it sparked a barrage of queries and objections from art historians around the world . One of the most vocal of these critics was James Beck , of <unk> International , who issued repeated warnings about the possibility of damage to Michelangelo 's work from over @-@ strenuous restoration . An argument that was used repeatedly was that all the previous interventions had caused damage of one sort or another . Any restoration , as opposed to conservation , puts an artwork at risk . Conservation , on the other hand , aids in the preservation of the work in its present state and in prevention of further deterioration . Beck has written about his concerns in Art Restoration , the Culture , the Business and the Scandal . 
 In the rhetoric of this conversation , [ the conservators ] say that the previous restoration was no good – now we 're going to make a really good one . It 's like having a facelift . How many times can people go through one without their poor faces looking like an orange peel ? 
 While James Beck became " embroiled in a public debate " with Gianluigi Colalucci , Ronald Feldman , a New York art dealer , started a petition supported by 15 well @-@ known artists including Robert Motherwell , George Segal , Robert Rauschenberg , Christo and Andy Warhol asking Pope John Paul II to call a halt to the procedure and also the restoration of Leonardo da Vinci 's Last Supper . 
 An undertaking of the restoration team was that everything would be handled in a transparent fashion , that reporters , art historians and others with a bona fide interest should have ready access to information and to view the work . However , a single company , Nippon Television Network Corporation , had sole photography rights . Michael Kimmelman , chief art critic of The New York Times , wrote , in 1991 , that the criticism of the restoration of the ceiling and lunettes was in part fuelled by the Nippon Television Network 's reluctance to make public those photographs that they had taken by exclusive right , which had recorded every stage of the process and which were the only solid evidence that the work was being done appropriately . 
 According to Kimmelman , the reason for their reluctance to produce the detailed photos , which could have put to rest the worst fears of many of the interested parties , was the intention of the company to produce a large limited @-@ edition two @-@ volume coffee @-@ table book ( " as large as a coffee table " ) . This book , when produced retailed for US $ 1 @,@ 000 . Kimmelman refers to the fact that these photos were only made available to the few who could afford the exorbitant price as " ungenerous " and " immoral " . 
 As the work was progressively completed , there were those who were delighted ; Pope John Paul II spoke an inaugural homily after each stage . In December 1999 , after the completion of the wall frescoes , he said : 
 It would be difficult to find a more eloquent visual commentary on this biblical image than the Sistine Chapel , whose full splendour we can enjoy today thanks to the recently completed restoration . Our joy is shared by the faithful throughout the world , who not only cherish this place because of the masterpieces it contains , but also for the role it plays in the Church 's life . 
 Cardinal Edmund Szoka , governor of Vatican City , said : " This restoration and the expertise of the restorers allows us to contemplate the paintings as if we had been given the chance of being present when they were first shown . " 
 Other writers were less flattering . Andrew Wordsworth of The Independent , London , expressed the major point of concern : 
 There seems little doubt that the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel was in part painted a secco ( that is , once the plaster was dry ) , but the restorers none the less decided that radical cleaning was necessary , given the amount of dirt that had accumulated ( in particular from candle smoke ) . As a result the ceiling now has a curiously washed @-@ out look , with pretty but <unk> colouring – an effect quite unlike that of Michelangelo 's intensely sensual sculpture . 
 This crucial matter was also emphasised by Beck and defined in very clearly expressed terms on the website of the artist , Peter Layne Arguimbau . 
 = = = Issues raised by critics = = = 
 That part of the restoration in the Sistine Chapel which has caused the most concern is the ceiling , painted by Michelangelo . The emergence of the brightly coloured Ancestors of Christ from the gloom sparked a reaction of fear that the processes being employed in the cleaning were too severe . Despite warnings , the work on the ceiling proceeded and , according to critics such as James Beck , their worst fears were confirmed once the ceiling was completed . 
 The cause for dissent lies in the analysis and understanding of the techniques utilised by Michelangelo , and the technical response of the restorers to their understanding of those techniques . A close examination of the frescoes of the lunettes convinced the restorers that Michelangelo worked exclusively in " buon fresco " ; that is , the artist worked only on freshly laid plaster and each section of work was completed while the plaster was still in its fresh state . In other words , Michelangelo did not work " a secco " ; he did not come back later and add details onto the dry plaster . 
 The restorers , by assuming that the artist took a universal approach to the painting , took a universal approach to the restoration . A decision was made that all of the shadowy layer of animal glue and " lamp black " , all of the wax , and all of the overpainted areas were contamination of one sort or another : smoke deposits , earlier restoration attempts and painted definition by later restorers in attempt to enliven the appearance of the work . Based on this decision , according to Arguimbau 's critical reading of the restoration data that has been provided , the chemists of the restoration team decided upon a solvent that would effectively strip the ceiling down to its paint @-@ impregnated plaster . After treatment , only that which was painted " buon fresco " would remain . 
 According to critics , the inherent problem with this approach is that it relied heavily upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted buon fresco , that he was always satisfied with the result at the end of the day , and that in four and a half years spent on the ceiling , he stuck exclusively to one approach , and never made small alterations or added details . Arguimbau , on his website , quotes Colalucci , the head of the team , as contradicting himself on this matter . 
 A summary of the relevant statements of Colalucci , in the order that they occur in the Appendix entitled Michelangelo 's colours uncovered is as follows : 
 The elderly restorers who had taken part in the restoration of the 1930s were interviewed as part of the preparatory process . They claimed that Michelangelo worked over the frescoes a secco using <unk> or glazes as a binder . Colalucci rejects this , stating that Michelangelo worked exclusively in buon fresco . Colalucci then contradicts this by stating that Michelangelo had worked a secco , but " to a minimal degree " and " not at all in the lunettes " . 
 Colalucci then talks of Michelangelo 's " rigorous maintenance " of buon fresco technique , contradicting this by describing the a secco <unk> that Michelangelo made to the shoulder of Eleazar and the foot of <unk> , both of which are in the lunettes . He then says that Michelangelo worked in buon fresco with " no pentimenti proper " , ( pentimenti means the changes ) but only small corrections in fresco . 
 The on @-@ going criticism has been that the restorers presumed to know what end result the master was seeking to achieve in every separate case across the ceiling , and by what method he sought to achieve it . The disagreements about this have been vociferous and are unresolved . 
 = = = = Carbon black problem = = = = 
 The restorers took for granted that all of the layers of grease and soot on the ceiling were the result of candle smoke . Contrary to this view , James Beck and numerous artists have suggested that Michelangelo used carbon black in a wash of glue to lay on shadows and crisp dark definition , a secco . If this is the case , then the greater part was removed in the restoration . 
 On some of the figures , however , there still remains clear evidence of painting in carbon black . The apparent explanation for this is that over the long period that Michelangelo was at work , he probably , for a variety of reasons , varied his technique . Things that might affect the degree of finish achieved on a particular <unk> include the heat and humidity of the day and the length of daylight hours . Whatever the reason for the difference is , a difference in approach to the light and shade on the individual figures is clearly apparent . 
 There are still intense areas of shadow which throw the Cumaean Sibyl into relief . But it is more than relief ; it is the three @-@ dimensionality which art @-@ lovers expect to see in the work of the man who sculpted Moses . Critics of the restoration claim that this was Michelangelo 's aim and that many frescoes had brightly contrasting colours laid side @-@ by @-@ side that were then worked over a secco to achieve this effect and that this is what has been lost by a too @-@ scrupulous cleaning . 
 Consistently missing from the restored ceiling is the crisp a secco detailing of the architecture : the scallop shells , acorns and " bead and reel " ornament which Michelangelo possibly would have left for completion by an assistant , when he moved on to the next panel . The treatment of these details varied considerably . In a few places , around the <unk> spandrel , for example , the architectural detailing was painted buon fresco and remains intact . 
 A comparison of two spandrels reveals different post @-@ restoration states . The one on the left has shadows and details defined in black . The green robe with yellow highlights has been washed with black and defined with deep shadow . On the fictive architecture each motif is picked out in black . The eyes of the child are detailed in black and white . The continued presence of these details suggests that they were completed while the plaster was damp . The entire right spandrel has an unfinished look . Before cleaning it also had black defining the shadows of the robes and crisp detailing on the architecture . 
 On the corner pendentives , each of which depicts a violent subject , the removal of the carbon black has diminished the dramatic intensity of all four scenes . This is particularly noticeable in the loss of depth in the Punishment of Haman . Where once the figure projected starkly against the darkly shadowed interior , now foreshortening , definition and drama is lost in the pastel monotone that remains . 
 = = = = Colour = = = = 
 The curator , Fabrizio Mancinelli , quotes the 18th @-@ century French traveller De Lalande in saying that the colouring of the ceiling was , by that time , monotonous , " tend [ ing ] towards dull red and grey " . Mancinelli writes that the restoration reveals " a new Michelangelo " as a colourist and that this " new character makes much better sense of his historical position " . He goes on to say that perceptive viewers of the Sistine Chapel ceiling have always been aware that the range of colours used was very different from that which could be seen , and included the same pinks , apple greens , oranges , yellows and pale blues that were employed by Michelangelo 's teacher , Domenico Ghirlandaio , one of the most competent fresco painters of the Renaissance . 
 The brilliant palette ought to have been expected by the restorers as the same range of colours appears in the works of Giotto , Masaccio and Masolino , Fra Angelico and Piero della Francesca , as well as Ghirlandaio himself and later fresco painters such as Annibale <unk> and Tiepolo . The reason for employing this range of colours is that many other pigments are not usable in fresco as they have chemical properties that react badly in interaction with wet plaster . The colour that is noticeably missing from Michelangelo 's ceiling , but not The Last Judgment , is the intense blue of lapis lazuli . This colour , achieved by grinding semi @-@ precious stone , was always applied as a secondary , a secco stage , along with the gold leaf applied as haloes and decoration to robes . 
 The aspect of the colouring which was most unexpected was Michelangelo 's treatment of shadows . The painting of the Libyan Sibyl and the Prophet Daniel , which are side @-@ by @-@ side , are exemplary . On the yellow dress of the Sibyl , Michelangelo has bright yellow highlights , passing through carefully graded tones of deeper yellow to pale orange , darker orange and almost to red in the shadows . While red shadows are of themselves unusual in a fresco , the gradation through adjacent parts of the spectrum is a natural enough solution . On Daniel 's robes , there is no such gentle gradation . The yellow lining of his cloak becomes a sudden dense green in the shadows , while the mauve has shadows that are intensely red . These colour combinations , which are best described as iridescent , can be found at various places on the ceiling , including the hose of the young man in the Mathan lunette which is pale green and reddish purple . 
 In some instances , the colour combinations look garish : this is particularly the case with the Prophet Daniel . A comparison of the " restored " and " unrestored " figure gives strong evidence that Michelangelo worked over this figure in a wash of carbon black , and that the technique was preplanned . The bright red used on the robes of Daniel and the Libyan Sibyl does not , on its own , create effective shadows . In these and many other cases it appears to have been intended as underpainting , to be seen only through a thin black wash and with the deepest shadows picked out in more intense black , as they still are on the Cumaean Sibyl . This use of bright , contrasting colours as underpainting is not a common feature of frescoes , but it is commonly employed in both oil painting and tempera . Like Daniel , the Libyan Sibyl 's yellow garment once had much more subtlety in its folds and shadows than it has now . 
 There is absolutely no doubt that before the restoration , the whole ceiling was dirtier , more muted and more monochrome than Michelangelo ever intended , but when images of the frescoes are viewed in their stained and unrestored state the subtle washes and intense definitions , described by Beck and Arguimbau , still make their presence known , giving mass and bulk to the forms . 
 The painter and biographer Giorgio Vasari , in his Lives of the Artists , describes the figure of Jonah as it appeared in the mid @-@ 16th century : 
 " Then who is not filled with admiration and amazement at the awesome sight of Jonah , the last figure in the chapel ? The vaulting naturally springs forward , following the curve of the masonry ; but through the force of art it is apparently straightened out by the figure of Jonah , which bends in the opposite direction ; and thus vanquished by the art of design , with its lights and shades , the ceiling even appears to recede . " 
 The large figure of Jonah is of great significance to the total composition , both pictorially and theologically , being symbolic of the Risen Christ . The figure occupies the pendentive which rises from the altar wall to support the vault , and strains backward , his eyes turned towards God . The foreshortening described by Vasari was innovative and highly influential to later painters . The cleaning of this significant figure has left a few remnants of black shadow visible to the extreme left side of the painting . All the other , less intense , black lines and washes have been removed , lessening the impact of the radical foreshortening , and also robbing the great fish , the <unk> behind Jonah , and the architectural figures of much detail . 
 = = = = Eyes = = = = 
 The missing depth is not the only factor that the critics deplore . An important feature of Michelangelo 's work which , in many places , has disappeared forever is the painting of the eyeballs . Eyes appear in many instances to have been painted buon fresco . Wherever they have not been painted buon fresco but added a secco , they have been removed by the restorers . 
 They are an essential part of the most impressive and famous of the frescoes , the Creation of Adam . Adam gazes at God . God looks directly at Adam . And under God 's protective arm , Eve turns her eyes sideways in a look of admiration for her husband @-@ to @-@ be . Again and again , Michelangelo painted telling gazes into the faces of his characters . The eye sockets of the family in the <unk> lunette are empty as are the eyes of the man in the <unk> lunette , but the removal that has caused the most distress to the critics are the eyes of the little figure in green and white who once looked out of the gloom above the lunette of Jesse . 
 Arguimbau says : 
 Have you ever felt that some things never fade and remain an inspiration for all time ? That was the Sistine Chapel , now chemically stripped down of divine inspiration and looking shockingly out of place . ... It is the duty of the restorer not to alter the intent of the artist , but the scientist cannot help himself . Who cares if Colalucci discovered Michelangelo as a colorist and can explain the Colorist trends of Pontormo and Rossi . His job is to make sure the thing is stuck on there and leave it alone . In comparing before and after photos there is much proof that Colalucci removed ‘ a secco ' passages and left many areas sketchy and thin and . [ sic ] Proof of one single change of the artist 's intent is negligence of which there are many . 
 Richard <unk> , in an essay entitled Lies and Misdemeanors , Gianluigi Colalucci 's Sistine Chapel Revisited says : 
 The [ so @-@ called ] Glorious Restoration of Michelangelo 's frescoes has destroyed them forever . What we say now cannot bring them back to life . We can only speak out to document the accountability of the Vatican restorers so that it does not pass unrecognized . 
 = = Restoring the light = = 
 Carlo Pietrangeli , former Director General of the Vatican Museums , writes of the restoration : " It is like opening a window in a dark room and seeing it flooded with light . " His words resonate with those of Giorgio Vasari who , in the 16th century , said of the Sistine Chapel ceiling : 
 There is no other work to compare with this for excellence ... The ceiling has proved a veritable beacon for our art , of inestimable benefit to all painters , restoring light to a world that for centuries had been plunged into darkness . 
 Pietrangeli , in his foreword to The Sistine Chapel , written after the restoration of the lunettes , but prior to the restoration of the ceiling , commends those who had the courage to commence the restoration process , and thanks not only those who visited the restoration while it was in progress and gave the benefit of their knowledge and experience , but also those who were critical of the enterprise . Pietrangeli made acknowledgement that these people spurred the team on to punctilious documentation so that a full report of criteria and methods should be available to those who are interested , both in the present and the future . 
 = Longfellow House – Washington 's Headquarters National Historic Site = 
 The Longfellow House – Washington 's Headquarters National Historic Site , also known as the Vassall @-@ Craigie @-@ Longfellow House and , until December 2010 , Longfellow National Historic Site , is a historic site located at 105 Brattle Street in Cambridge , Massachusetts . For almost fifty years , it was the home of noted American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow . It had previously served as the headquarters of General George Washington , 1775 @-@ 76 . 
 The house was built in 1759 for John Vassall , who fled the Cambridge area at the beginning of the American Revolutionary War because of his loyalty to the king of England . George Washington occupied the house as his headquarters , beginning July 16 , 1775 . It served as his base of operations during the Siege of Boston , until he moved out on April 4 , 1776 . Andrew Craigie , Washington 's Apothecary General , was the next person to own the home for a significant period of time . After purchasing the house in 1791 , he instigated the home 's only major addition . Craigie 's financial situation at the time of his death in 1819 forced his widow Elizabeth Craigie to take in boarders . It was as a boarder that Henry Wadsworth Longfellow came into the home . He became its owner in 1843 , when his father @-@ in @-@ law Nathan Appleton purchased it as a wedding gift . He lived in the home until his death in 1882 . 
 The last family to live in the home was the Longfellow family , who established the Longfellow Trust in 1913 for its preservation . In 1972 , the home and all of its furnishings was donated to , and was made part of , the National Park Service . The home , which represents the mid @-@ Georgian architectural style , is seasonally open to the public .

 = = = Early history = = = 
 The original house was built in 1759 for Loyalist John Vassall who inherited the land along what was called the King 's Highway in Cambridge when he was 21 . He demolished the structure that had stood there and built a new mansion . The home became his summer residence with his wife Elizabeth ( Oliver ) and children until 1774 . His wife 's brother was Thomas Oliver , then royal lieutenant governor of Massachusetts , who in 1766 moved to Cambridge and built the nearby mansion now known as Elmwood . On the eve of the American Revolution in September 1774 , they fled Boston . 
 In the days after the Battles of Lexington and Concord , the home was used as a temporary hospital . Colonel John Glover and the Marblehead Regiment occupied the house as their temporary barracks in June 1775 . Initially , General George Washington , Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the newly formed Continental Army , used the Benjamin Wadsworth House at Harvard College as his headquarters , but decided he needed more space for his staff . Washington moved into the Vassall House on July 16 , 1775 , and used it as his headquarters and home until he departed on April 4 , 1776 . During the Siege of Boston , he found the view of the Charles River from the house particularly useful . The home was shared with several aide @-@ de @-@ camps , including colonel Robert H. Harrison . During his time there , Washington was visited by John Adams and Abigail Adams , Benedict Arnold , Henry Knox , and Nathanael Greene . In his study , Washington also confronted Dr. Benjamin Church with evidence that he was a spy . It was in this house that Washington received a poem written by Phillis Wheatley , the first published African @-@ American poet . " If you should ever come to Cambridge " , he wrote to her , " I shall be happy to see a person so favored by the Muses " . 
 Martha Washington joined her husband in December 1775 and stayed until March 1776 . She brought with her Washington 's nephew George Lewis as well as her son John Parke Custis and his wife Eleanor Calvert . On Twelfth Night in January 1776 , the couple celebrated their wedding anniversary in the home . Mrs. Washington reported to a friend that " some days we have [ heard ] a number of cannon and shells from Boston and Bunkers Hill " . She used the front parlor as her personal reception room , still furnished with the English @-@ made furniture left behind by the <unk> . The Washingtons also had several servants , including a tailor named Giles Alexander , and several slaves including " Billy " Lee . They also entertained very often . Surviving household accounts show that the family purchased large quantities of beef , lamb , wild ducks , geese , fresh fish , plums , peaches , barrels of cider , gallons of brandy and rum , and 217 bottles of Madeira wine purchased in a two @-@ week period . 
 Washington left the house in April 1776 . Nathaniel Tracy , who had made a great fortune as one of the earliest and most successful privateers under Washington , owned the house from 1781 to 1786 . He then went bankrupt and sold the house to Thomas Russell , a wealthy Boston merchant , who in turn occupied it until 1791 . 
 = = = Craigie family and boarders = = = 
 Andrew Craigie bought the house in 1791 ; Craigie had been the first Apothecary General of the American army . In his ballroom , Craigie hosted Prince Edward , Duke of Kent and Strathearn , the father of Queen Victoria . While living in the home , he married the daughter of a Nantucket clergyman , 22 @-@ year @-@ old Elizabeth Craigie , 17 years her elder . Craigie overspent in trying to restore the home and , when he died in 1819 , he left his wife Elizabeth in great debt ; Mrs. Craigie took in boarders to support herself , most often people connected to nearby Harvard University . Short @-@ term residents of the home included Jared Sparks , Edward Everett , and Joseph Emerson Worcester . Sparks , who moved into the home in April 1833 , was then preparing a biography of Washington based on original documents . He recorded in his journal : " It is a singular circumstance that , while I am engaged in preparing for the press the letters of General Washington which he wrote at Cambridge after taking command of the American army , I should occupy the same rooms that he did at that time . " Another lodger was Sarah Lowell , an aunt of James Russell Lowell . 
 Longfellow moved to Cambridge to take a job at Harvard College as Smith Professor of Modern Languages and of Belles Lettres . A friend , Cornelius Conway Felton , recommended that Longfellow rent a room on the third floor of the home of a Professor Stearns on Kirkland Street ; Longfellow stayed there for the 1836 – 1837 academic year . He disliked the place , however , and sought out better accommodations . Beginning in the summer of 1837 , he rented rooms on the east side of the second floor of the home on Brattle Street , now owned by Elizabeth Craigie . At first , Mrs. Craigie thought he was a student at Harvard and refused to rent to him until he convinced her that he was a professor as well as the author of the book she was reading , Outre @-@ Mer . 
 Longfellow 's new landlady had earned a reputation for being eccentric and often wore a turban . In the 1840s , Longfellow wrote about an incident when canker @-@ worms were devastating the elm trees on the property . Mrs. Craigie " would sit by the open window and let them crawl over her white turban . She refused to have the trees protected against them & said , Why , sir , they have as good a right to live as we — they are our fellow worms " . The maid at the time , a woman named Miriam , served Longfellow his meals in his room . Longfellow called her " the giantess " . 
 Upon moving into the home in August 1837 , Longfellow wrote to his father , " The new rooms are above all praise , only the do want painting . " The rooms Longfellow rented were the same ones once used personally by George Washington while it was his headquarters . He proudly wrote to his friend George Washington Greene : " I live in a great house which looks like an Italian villa : have two large rooms opening into each other . They were once Gen. Washington 's chambers " . 
 The first major works Longfellow composed in the home were Hyperion , a prose romance likely inspired by his pursuit for the affections of Frances Appleton , and Voices of the Night , a poetry collection which included " A Psalm of Life " . 20th @-@ century literary scholar Edward Wagenknecht notes that it was these early years at the Craigie House which marked " the real beginning of Longfellow 's literary career " . His landlady , Elizabeth Craigie , died in 1841 . 
 = = = Longfellow family = = = 
 After Elizabeth Craigie 's death , the entire property was leased by Joseph Emerson Worcester from her heirs ; he in turn rented the eastern half of the house to Longfellow . In 1843 , the house was purchased by Nathan Appleton , who gave the house to Longfellow as a wedding gift when Longfellow married Nathan 's daughter Frances . He paid $ 10 @,@ 000 for the home . Frances wrote to her brother Thomas Gold Appleton on August 30 , 1843 : " We have decided to let Father purchase this grand old mansion " , especially after Longfellow 's friend George Washington Greene reminded them " how noble an inheritance this is — where Washington dwelt in every room " . Longfellow was proud of the connection to Washington and in 1844 purchased a bust of the home 's former occupant , a copy of the sculpture by Jean @-@ Antoine Houdon . Worcester and his wife became tenants under Longfellow in the western half of the house until their new home a few doors down was completed that spring . Mrs. Longfellow wrote on May 5 , 1844 , " Worcester family left us in complete possession [ of the house ] , with rooms nicely cleaned , and <unk> stairs and entries " . 
 Nathan Appleton also purchased the land across the street , as Longfellow 's mother wrote , " so that their view of the River Charles may not be intercepted " . In all , Longfellow 's gift included nine acres of land . 
 Longfellow lived in the house for the next four decades , producing many of his most famous poems including " Paul Revere 's Ride " and " The Village Blacksmith " , as well as longer works such as Evangeline , The Song of Hiawatha , and The Courtship of Miles Standish . In all , while living in this house , Longfellow published eleven poetry collections , two novels , three epic poems , and several plays as well as a translation of Dante Alighieri 's Divine Comedy . Even as the poet 's popularity increased , Longfellow and his wife most often referred to the home as " Craigie House " or " Craigie Castle " . 
 Longfellow oversaw the creation of a formal garden and his wife oversaw decorating the interior . Mrs. Longfellow purchased several items from Tiffany 's in New York as well as $ 350 worth of carpets . They installed central heating in 1850 and gaslight in 1853 . During their time in the house , the <unk> hosted famous artists , writers , politicians and other luminaries who were attracted to Longfellow 's hospitality and fame . Specific visitors included Charles Dickens , William Makepeace Thackeray , singer Jenny Lind , and actress Fanny Kemble . Dom Pedro II , Emperor of Brazil also visited the house privately and requested the company of Longfellow , Ralph Waldo Emerson , Oliver Wendell Holmes , Sr. , and James Russell Lowell . Mr. and Mrs. Longfellow also raised their three daughters and two sons in the home . Longfellow and his wife stayed in the home until their respective deaths but spent their summers after 1850 in Nahant , Massachusetts . 
 Longfellow often wrote in his first @-@ floor study , formerly Washington 's office , surrounded by portraits of his friends , including charcoal portraits by Eastman Johnson of Charles Sumner , Ralph Waldo Emerson , Nathaniel Hawthorne , and Cornelius Conway Felton . Longfellow would write either at the center table , at the desk , or in the armchair by the fire . 
 Fanny Longfellow died in the home in July 1861 after her dress accidentally caught fire ; her husband attempted to quell the flames , managing to keep her face from burning . Longfellow himself was burned on his own face and was scarred badly enough that he began growing a beard to hide it . 
 = = Preservation and current use = = 
 Longfellow died in 1882 and his daughter Alice Longfellow was the last of his children to live in the home . In 1913 , the surviving Longfellow children established the Longfellow House Trust to preserve the home as well as its view to the Charles River . Their intention was to preserve the home as a memorial to Longfellow and Washington and to showcase the property as a " prime example of Georgian architecture " . 
 In 1962 , the trust successfully lobbied for the house to become a national historic landmark . In 1972 , the Trust donated the property to the National Park Service and it became the Longfellow National Historic Site and open to the public as a house museum . On display are many of the original nineteenth century furnishings , artwork , over 10 @,@ 000 books owned by Longfellow , and the dining table around which many important visitors gathered . Everything on display was owned by the Longfellow family . The site was renamed to Longfellow House – Washington 's Headquarters National Historic Site on December 22 , 2010 , to ensure that the connection to Washington was not lost in the memory of the general public . 
 The site also possesses some 750 @,@ 000 original documents relevant to the former occupants of the home . These archives are open to scholarly research by appointment . 
 Across the street from the Longfellow House – Washington 's Headquarters National Historic Site is the municipal park known as Longfellow Park . In the middle sits a memorial by sculptor Daniel Chester French dedicated in 1914 . In addition to a bust of the poet , a carved bas @-@ relief by Henry Bacon depicts the famous characters Miles Standish , <unk> , the village blacksmith , the Spanish student , Evangeline , and Hiawatha . The monument is similar to one French designed for the street that leads to Sunnyside , the former home of Washington Irving . 
 = = Architecture and landscape = = 
 The structure of the original house was built in the Georgian architectural style . The pair of large pilasters that frame the facade expressed John Vassall 's aristocratic background . In 1791 , Andrew Craigie added the two side piazzas and the two @-@ story back ell and also expanded the library into a twenty by thirty foot ballroom with its own entrance . During the Longfellow family 's time in the home , very few structural changes were made . As Frances Longfellow wrote , " we are full of plans & projects with no desire , however , to change a feature of the old countenance which Washington has rendered sacred " . 
 The Longfellow House – Washington 's Headquarters National Historic Site is noted for its garden on the northeast end of the property . Henry Wadsworth Longfellow oversaw the creation of the original garden , shaped as a lyre , shortly after his wedding . In 1845 , he began refurbishing the garden in earnest and imported trees from England with help from Asa Gray . These trees included " a number of evergreens , among them a cedar of Lebanon and pines from the Himalayas , Norway , Switzerland and Oregon " . The lyre shape proved impractical and a new design was made with the help of a landscape architect named Richard Dolben in 1847 . The new design was a square surrounding a circle that was cut into four tear @-@ shaped garden beds outlined by trimmed boxwood . Mrs. Longfellow referred to the shape as a " Persian rug " . 
 After her father 's death in 1882 , Alice Longfellow commissioned two of America 's first female landscape architects , Martha Brookes Hutcheson and Ellen Biddle Shipman , to redesign the formal garden in the Colonial Revival style . The garden was recently restored by an organization called Friends of the Longfellow House , which completed the final stage of its reconstruction , the historic pergola , in 2008 . 
 = = Replicas = = 
 For a time , Longfellow 's home was one of the most photographed and most recognizable homes in the United States . In the early twentieth century Sears , Roebuck and Company sold scaled @-@ down blueprints of the home so that anyone could build their own version of Longfellow 's home . Several replicas of Longfellow 's home appear throughout the United States . One replica , simply called Longfellow House , still exists in Minneapolis . Originally built by businessman Robert " Fish " Jones , it currently serves as an information center for the Minneapolis Park System and is on the Grand Rounds Scenic Byway . A full @-@ scale replica of the house was built in Great Barrington , Massachusetts at the turn of the 20th century . This building is the only remaining full @-@ scale replica of Longfellow 's original home maintaining all the original historical character . 
 = Saskatchewan Highway 16 = 
 Highway 16 is a provincial paved highway in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan . It is the Saskatchewan section of the Yellowhead Highway , and also the Trans @-@ Canada Highway Yellowhead section . The main purpose of this highway is to connect Saskatchewan with Canadian cities such as Edmonton and Winnipeg . The highway runs from the Alberta boundary in Lloydminster ( 50th Avenue or Alberta <unk> ) to the Manitoba boundary near <unk> . Major cities it passes through are Saskatoon , North Battleford in the central part of the province , Yorkton in the far east and Lloydminster to the far west . 
 The highway is four lanes through Saskatchewan from the Alberta boundary to just west of Floral ; the rest of the road is two lanes , but plans exist to twin the route and gain expressway status . Similarly , Highway 16 , the continuation of the highway into Manitoba , is also to be twinned and become an expressway . The road also serves as part of the Circle Drive in Saskatoon . 
 The Yellowhead began as the Yellowhead Red River cart trail . When the province was surveyed , the road evolved from a dirt to gravel to all weather road known as Provincial Highway 5 from the Alberta – Saskatchewan boundary to Saskatoon , and as Provincial Highway 14 from Saskatoon to the Manitoba – Saskatchewan boundary . In the late 1950s and 1960s , the highway was straightened and widened . On August 15 , 1970 the Yellowhead was opened for the northern Trans @-@ Canada route . The highway was completely designated for the entire route as Saskatchewan Highway 16 in 1976 .

 = = = Red River Trail = = = 
 Travel across Canada originated in the early 19th century when the Hudson 's Bay Company and North West Company wanted to transport furs from the east to Fort St. James in the New Caledonia district , British Columbia . Sir George Simpson , governor of the Hudson 's Bay Company , employed a surveyor , James Macmillan , to find a route west . James Macmillan used an Iroquois guide " Tête Jaune " ( Pierre Bostonais ) to help find the most feasible path . Leather was needed at Fort St. James for moccasins and <unk> . The path from Saskatchewan to British Columbia through the Rocky Mountains became known as the Leather Pass or Leather Track and more commonly the Yellowhead . Tête Jaune or Yellowhead was the moniker for Pierre Bostonais , which referred to his blonde hair . Pierre Bostonais , the founder of the Yellowhead trail , has also been recorded as Pierre <unk> and his nickname Tête Jaune Cache . The beginnings of this overland route can be found in the 19th century travel along the Carlton Trail , a Red River cart dirt trail which connected Fort Gary , Fort Ellice , Fort Carlton , Fort Battleford , and Fort Pitt through a northerly route . In 1876 , Battleford became the capital of the North @-@ West Territories . This area at the junction of the Battle River and the North Saskatchewan River was home to Cole 's Post as early as 1780 . A Hudson 's Bay Company store and trading post , the North @-@ West Mounted Police barracks and Government House were all established in 1876 . 
 = = = Immigration and settlements = = = 
 The railways would not build across the western frontier without settlement as it would be too costly to provide train service across a barren wilderness . The Clifford Sifton immigration policy encourages settlers to arrive . Western settlement began and immigration encroached across the Manitoba boundary into the North @-@ West Territories , later to become Saskatchewan . Immigration settlement to the last best west and the highway early beginnings began in the southeast . The federal government survey crew reached this southeastern area of the District of Assiniboia , North @-@ West Territories in 1880 . In 1881 , the province of Manitoba expanded to its present boundaries and land could be purchased for $ 10 an acre . U.S. President Lincoln 's Homestead Act was passed in 1862 and lands there were taken . In 1872 , Canada passed the Dominion Lands Act , attracting homesteaders to the West . 
 With the establishment of settlements and population came the attendant need for education , health , fire and police protection and an urgent need to improve methods of travel . The North @-@ West Territories established departments , which did not last long , and were soon replaced by a rural administrative system called local improvement districts ( LID ) . Local improvement districts were very large , and with the early dirt trails for roads , and a limited number of automobiles , the area was found much too large to administer . The LID soon gave way to the rural municipality ( RM ) system of rural civic administration and encompassed on average nine townships , three by three in area , which were each 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) square , and with some modifications is still the rural administration in use today . This civic government with its elected officials attended to the maintenance and construction of the early pioneer road .

 Provincial Highway 14 , the precursor of the Yellowhead Saskatchewan Highway 16 followed the surveyed grade of the Manitoba and North West railway , later the CPR between the Manitoba boundary and Saskatoon . 
 Travel along the current Yellowhead before the 1940s would have been travelling on the square following the township road allowances , barbed wire fencing and rail lines . As the surveyed township roads were the easiest to travel , the first highway was designed on 90 @-@ degree , right @-@ angle corners as the distance traversed the prairie along range roads and township roads . 1926 Saskatchewan map Two @-@ horse then eight @-@ horse scrapers maintained these early dirt roads . 
 Up until 1904 all municipal affairs were administered by the Territorial Dept. of Public Works . In 1904 , [ Churchbridge ] ... became a potion of a larger area known as a Local Improvement District of approximately 144 miles ( 232 km ) square miles ... Road construction costs around 1900 , were very low . The cost of building a road 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) wide with an 0 feet 18 inches ( 0 @.@ 46 m ) crown cost approximately $ 30 , per 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) 
 The rail line was graded in 1907 and the Pleasant Hill branch connecting Sutherland to Viscount was operational in 1908 . The Great West Express provided passenger service between Winnipeg and Saskatoon during the years 1909 to 1960 . The Local Improvement District # <unk> was the first administrative government in the area starting in 1907 serving until the incorporation of Viscount No. 341 in 1909 . 
 <unk> first formed in the area known as Lakeview . Administrative affairs were handled from 1905 to 1909 by the Local Improvement District # 17 @-@ A3 and then by rural municipality Blucher No. 343 . The station of Fountain was on the rail line and Provincial Highway 14 in 1907 . Lanigan received steel in 1907 . Lanigan was a CPR junction point and five rail lines served the area from Lanigan , as well as Provincial highway 14 ( the Yellowhead ) and Hwy 20 . Humboldt and Watson were served to the north , and Nokomis to the south as well as the main Saskatoon Winnipeg line . The rail came to Wynyard in 1909 , and three years later the area incorporated as a town . Wynyard was the CPR divisional point . <unk> received its post office in 1907 , and renamed to Mozart in 1909 . 
 = = = Provincial Highway 5 = = = 
 Provincial Highway 5 , the Evergreen Route , the precursor of the Yellowhead Saskatchewan Highway 16 followed the surveyed grade of the Canadian Northern Railway , later the Canadian National Railway line between Saskatoon and the Alberta provincial boundary at Lloydminster . In 1903 – 1904 the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Grand Trunk Railway extended southeast from Saskatoon . 
 One benefit from the grading of the two railways was that good construction roads paralleled the lines . Thus , the modern Yellowhead highway between Saskatoon and Lanigan owes its origins to the grading crews . 
 The one event that had the greatest impact on the western segment of the Yellowhead was the decision of Donald Mann and William Mackenzie , owners of the Canadian Northern , to build from Manitoba to the Pacific . 
 1926 Saskatchewan map 
 Whereas Langham and Dalmeny were both a part of the historical Provincial Highway 5 they are not located directly upon the Yellowhead Highway ( Saskatchewan Highway 16 ) presently . This survey crossed the North Saskatchewan River twice before reaching North Battleford . The stage coach route followed along to the south of the North Saskatchewan River , and the steel to the north of the North Saskatchewan River . The postal service was later given to the rails , and dissolved the use of the stage coach trail . 
 The ferry crossing was near the present Borden Bridge . This parkland area north of the river was termed the Baltimore district . The first railway crossing was at <unk> located on the southeast river bank of the North Saskatchewan River . 
 The first siding west of Saskatoon was Goodrich , which is more commonly known as Radisson today . 
 There were two L.I.D. ' s that formed the municipality. the northern one was L.I.D. 21 @-@ D @-@ 3 and the southern portion was L.I.D. 20 @-@ D @-@ 3 
 The local improvement districts administered the area between 1906 and the formation of Great Bend No. 405 in 1910 . Local Improvement district No. 21 @-@ J @-@ 3 handled affairs between 1905 and 1910 when the local government was taken over by Mayfield No. 406 rural municipality . 
 July 28 , 1905 , Lloydminster was reached by the Canadian Northern Railway and November 24 , 1905 , Edmonton . The oil capital , Lloydminster was founded by the Barr colonists ' settlement of 1903 . Maymont saw its beginnings arise from a few Barr colonists who settled here en route to the Britannia settlement . The rails arrived in the Battlefords in 1906 . The <unk> Highway Hwy Highway 674 to the south and the Paynton Ferry on the north crossing the North Saskatchewan River were both constructed in 1906 – 1907 creating the main intersection of Provincial Highway 5 ( Yellowhead Highway ) and Highway 674 . 
 = = = Automobile and road evolution = = = 
 The car appeared in the early 20th century to be pulled by horse again in the dirty thirties . In 1906 , cars could be registered , and plates were issued as early as 1912 . In the late 1920s the roads were gravelled near the larger centers such as Yorkton , Saskatoon , the Battlefords , and Lloydminster . All @-@ weather roads were developed in the 1930s , which began to depart from the surveyed township roads connecting centres directly . Roads also were constructed to allow for rain run @-@ off , with a rounded top surface . 
 Lack of roads and excessive difficulties in building them throughout the district were major problems of the [ Churchbridge ] council as a resolution as passed and forwarded to the Provincial Government indicate . In a preamble to their resolution they point out that Good roads are the most important factor in forming a well to @-@ do and contented <unk> and the Burden [ sic ] of building good roads would be too strenuous for the present generations . In Jan. 1910 records show us that L.I.D. No. 12 A @-@ 1 has become Local Improvement District No. 211 . 
 On February 20 , 1907 , J.B. Gibson introduced the first car in Yorkton . It was a 20 horsepower Reo . Within the space of a few months , several other cars appeared on the streets of Yorkton , and the pattern spread to other towns along the line . 
 A chain @-@ driven Case was the first gasoline power buggy driven in Paynton by Eddie <unk> followed by Alex McKay 's McLaughlin automobile . 
 ... when this was a Local Improvement District ... men worked out the taxes by building up the road with pick and shovel and a team of horses and what we called a scraper . 
 Norman Lambert of Denholm sold Ford Model T gas @-@ powered buggies and the McLaughlin <unk> providing a 15- or 20 @-@ minute driving lesson to the proud new owner . 
 The roads were just prairie trails which wound around bluffs , up and down hills . These roads were quite adequate for horses , but were a different story for cars ; very few of the roads went on the square where the roads allowances were finally surveyed . When it rained there was always a mud puddle at the bottom of every hill and every car that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck . The coming of cars soon made a big difference . The prairie trails proved inadequate and road allowances were graded and built up ; culverts had to be installed where the natural water runs were . The new graded roads were a big improvement but many a muddy mile was driven over the country roads . Gradually , some of the main highways would get some gravel and it was quite a pleasure to pull of a muddy country road on to a few miles of gravel — Les Moffatt . 
 Mr. Hugh Gibson thought oxen were too slow — so he bought a motorcycle , then in 1912 he bought a Maxwell car , the first car in the area . [ Maymont ] 
 In the spring of 1912 , debentures were sold to Wood and Gandy Co. for $ 17 @,@ 700 , so five new , steel road graders were purchased from Hamilton Machinery Co .... World War II ended ... Victory bonds were cashed and a Crawler tractor with a carry @-@ all scraper was purchased . The first motor patrol operator was hired at $ 125 per month . Snow removal became necessary so a V @-@ plow attachment and a set of chains were added ... [ 1954 @-@ 1956 ] Highway # 14 had been reconstructed so the R.M. posted new signs for the towns at junctions . 
 . 
 Radisson became a town July 1 , 1913 , eight years following the arrival of the rail . 
 On January 1 , 1913 , our [ Churchbridge ] district became part of the R.M. No. 211 . 
 A by @-@ law passed in 1913 limited speed to 10 m.p.h. [ 10 miles ( 16 km ) / hour ] for motor vehicles , amended in 1917 to 15 m.p.h. [ 15 miles ( 24 km ) / per hour ] and again in 1937 to 20 m.p.h. [ 20 miles ( 32 km ) / per hour ] Provincial licenses were required for cars in 1913 and the license number and make of car to be registered with the secretary @-@ treasurer . A person had to be 18 years of age to drive a car . In 1917 motor vehicles were required to be operated in a manner not to frighten horses . 
 <unk> Carruthers operated Carruthers Garage in Lashburn , and six Model T Ford cars were shipped here October 5 , 1917 . These cars required assembly , and in total 18 cars were sold in 1917 , and 24 in 1918 with prices ranging from $ 563 to $ 818 . Lashburn was served by Provincial Highway 5 , the early name for Saskatchewan Highway 16 . 
 The Viscount RM arranged for surveys for the area 's main roads in 1917 . 
 The Canadian Pacific Railway came to Lloydminster in 1926 . 
 In 1927 the Department of Highways suggested that the Jasper Highway follow the <unk> tracks between Radisson and Borden , but the Town did not agree with this and asked that the old highway on the square be continued — 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) or 7 miles ( 11 km ) east of Radisson , thence south 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) to a point near Borden . This plan was followed at that time . In 1930 a delegation from council addressed the Minister of Highways and the Cabinet at Regina requesting that # 5 Highway be an all @-@ weather highway across the Province . In other words gravel all the way . In 1947 several lots on the north of the town were sold to the Provincial Department of Highways for the construction of Highway # 5 to by @-@ pass the town on the north end . 
 The company that built the old highway ( # 5 ) that paralleled the Canadian National Railway ... grading that road in 1928 or 1929 with their four horse teams . 
 The construction of Number 14 Highway between Lanigan and Saskatoon was started in 1929 . It was to have an earth @-@ built road bed , with a right of way of 66 feet ( 20 m ) and a road surface of 24 feet ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) . 
 The Provincial Number 14 was graveled in 1930 . The 1930s saw the beginnings of gravel roads , and the surface from Wynyard to Manitoba was gravel , and the 1940s saw the entire eastern route graveled . 
 The Borden Bridge was constructed in 1936 replacing ferry service across the North Saskatchewan River . This northwestern route was gravelled by 1955 . The Borden Bridge – Saskatoon cut off was officially opened on October 20 , 1969 , shortening the trip between North Battleford and Saskatoon by 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) As the highway was developed and the course straightened out , some towns disappeared as they were disconnected from the Yellowhead route . Dalmeny survived the Borden Bridge – Saskatoon straightening project . 
 Some highway construction ensued as a make work project of the thirties . A work and wages program provided assistance to farmers during the depression years of the Dirty Thirties . The municipality received improved roads under this program wherein many RM roads were gravelled . 
 In January 1943 , rates for roadwork were set at 80 cents an hour for a man with a four @-@ horse team , a single man received 40 cents an hour and a man with a two @-@ horse team could receive 65 cents per hour . The foreman collected wages of 50 cents an hour for roadwork . 
 A larger improvement came about as a part of the industrial revolution in the 1940s following the return of the men from World War II . Following World War II improved economic and farming factors saw an increase of taxation , and mechanized road building programs resulting in better roads . 
 The [ Churchbridge ] municipality had now acquired power road building and maintenance equipment . 
 In 1958 , the road construction equipment was traded for an Adams No. 440 motor grader and snow plow . Improved highways and travel by automobile soon saw the demise of a great majority of settlements along the prairie which were lively communities in the first half of the 20th century . 
 November 1947 saw communities along the Yellowhead organize together with caravans and meetings to encourage the Trans @-@ Canada Trail to build on the northern route connecting eastern and western Canada . The Trans @-@ Canada was officially opened in 1962 along the southern route . 
 The highway [ near Sheho ] is currently [ 1955 ] being re @-@ rerouted and completely rebuilt . 
 In 1955 , the Battlefords were served by Highways 4 , 5 , and 40 as well as the CNR and CPR . Saskatchewan Highway 16 , then Provincial Highway 5 was nicknamed the Evergreen Route . Fort Battleford is still a national historic site . In 1955 it was predicted that the Trans @-@ Canada Yellowhead would soon be hard surfaced along the route . As of 1955 @,@
