 " Savior " is a punk rock song , and has been described by Aaron Burgess of The A.V. Club as an " uptempo anthem " . The song 's composition is written in the time signature of common time , with a moderate tempo of 94 beats per minute . It follows verse @-@ chorus form , and is composed in the key F ♯ minor , with a melody that spans a tonal range of E4 to C ♯ 6 . John Hanson of Sputnikmusic noted that the song had a " frenetic pace " , which was reminiscent of many of the tracks from the band 's 2003 album Revolutions per Minute . 
 Lyrically , " Savior " deviates from the social and political topics normally discussed in Rise Against songs , and is instead about forgiveness and broken relationships . It tells the story of a couple who have recently split up . The two attempt to reconcile their differences , with lines such as " I don 't hate you , boy / I just want to save you while there 's still something left to save . " Hanson and Liz Ramanand of Loudwire have characterized the lyrics as " poignant " , and " poetic " . 
 = = Reception and chart performance = = 
 " Savior " was well received by critics . Hanson and Davey Boy of Sputnikmusic both praised the song ; Hanson described it as " one of the most inspired songs [ Rise Against ] have written to date " , while Boy wrote that " ' Savior ' sees absolutely everything come together perfectly to make for one hell of a song " . Burgess opined that " Savior " was one of three Appeal to Reason tracks that would " satisfy anyone still uneasy about Rise Against 's radio aspirations " . Bob Hoose of Plugged In complimented the positive and hopeful lyrics . 
 Commercially , " Savior " remains one of Rise Against 's most successful singles to date , and spent a considerable amount of time on multiple Billboard music charts . Reaching as high as number two on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart , it spent thirty @-@ six weeks on the chart , the fourth most amount of time for any song on the chart . " Savior " peaked at number three on both the Hot Rock Songs and Alternative Songs charts , and holds the record for the most amount of time spent for both charts , with sixty @-@ three and sixty @-@ five weeks respectfully . It was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America , denoting shipments of 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 copies . In Canada , the song reached number sixty @-@ eight on the Canadian Hot 100 .

 The accompanying music video was directed by Kevin Kerslake , who had previously directed the band 's music videos for " Ready to Fall " , and " Re @-@ Education ( Through Labor ) " . The video centers around actors wearing animal costumes , who in the beginning , engage in a mosh pit . One of the animals , a polar bear , is constantly being punched and kicked by an elephant , and decides to leave . While traveling on a bus , it sees the same elephant limping . The polar bear reluctantly asks the driver to stop and let the elephant on , who sits next to the polar bear , and the two hold hands . Scenes of Rise Against performing and destroying their instruments are shown throughout . 
 McIlrath had originally envisioned a simple performance video , with the band " going nuts in a parking lot , trashing equipment , having fun and showing the physical nature of Rise Against " . However , Kerslake came up with the idea for the animals , as he felt it would be a bizarre element that would keep people watching . Despite its humorous nature , Kerslake stated that there were some political undertones in the video , with the polar bear representing endangered species , while the elephant represents the Republican Party of the United States .

 = Reformed baptismal theology = 
 In Reformed theology , baptism is a sacrament signifying the baptized person 's union with Christ , or becoming part of Christ and being treated as if they had done everything Christ had . Sacraments , along with preaching of God 's word , are means of grace through which God offers Christ to people . Sacraments are believed to have their effect through the Holy Spirit , but these effects are only believed to be beneficial to those who have faith in Christ . 
 In Reformed theology , baptism is the sacrament of initiation into the visible church , or body of people who publicly claim faith in Christ . Baptism also signifies regeneration and remission of sin . Reformed Christians believe that the children of those who express faith in Christ should be baptized . Because baptism is believed to be beneficial only to those who have faith in Christ , infants are baptized on the basis of the promise of faith which will come to fruition later in life . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Christian baptismal theology prior to the Reformation taught that sacraments , including baptism , are means or instruments through which God communicates grace to people . The sacrament was considered valid regardless of who administered it . Not everyone who received a sacrament , however , received the grace signified by the sacrament . Some medieval theologians spoke of an obstacle of mortal sin which blocks the grace of the sacrament , while others insisted that the recipient be positively open and responding in faith to the sacrament in order to receive any benefit . Baptism was believed to be used by the Holy Spirit to transform the believer , and offered the benefits of remission of sins , regeneration , and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit . The sacrament of penance was believed to be necessary for forgiveness for sins committed after baptism . 
 During the Reformation , Martin Luther rejected many of the Catholic Church 's seven sacraments , but retained baptism and the Lord 's Supper . He saw many practices of the medieval church as abuses of power intended to require work in order to merit forgiveness for sin after baptism rather than faith alone . Luther attached the promise of salvation to baptism , and taught that life after baptism should be spent in recollection of it and the dying to sin it signified . 
 = = = Reformation and Reformed orthodoxy = = = 
 Huldrych Zwingli , the earliest theologian considered part of the Reformed tradition , was vigorously opposed to worship practices he believed to be based on tradition rather than the Bible . Nevertheless , he disagreed with Anabaptists , who refused to baptize their children on scriptural grounds . Through his arguments with Anabaptists , Zwingli arrived at the position that baptism was a sign of the covenant between God and his people , but that it did not convey grace to the baptized . He saw baptism as essentially identical to the circumcision of Israelites in the Old Testament in this respect , and used this idea in polemics against Anabaptists . Zwingli 's emphasis on baptism as a pledge or oath was to prove unique in the Reformed tradition . Heinrich Bullinger , Zwingli 's successor , continued the teaching of the continuity of God 's covenants and circumcision with baptism . Bullinger also emphasized that baptism indicates duties to the baptized in response to God 's grace . 
 John Calvin was influenced by Martin Luther 's idea of baptism as God 's promises to the baptized person attached to the outward sign of washing with water . Calvin maintained Zwingli 's idea of baptism as a public pledge , but insisted that it was secondary to baptism 's meaning as a sign of God 's promise to forgive sin . He maintained that sacraments were effective instruments in bringing about the promises they represent , however he also maintained that the promises could be refused by the baptized , and would have no effect in that case . Calvin carefully distinguished between the outward sign of the washing of water with the promises that baptism signifies while maintaining that they were inseparable . Calvin 's baptismal theology is very similar to that of Luther . It differs in the way Calvin subordinated sacraments to the preaching of the word of God . While Luther placed preaching and sacraments on the same level , Calvin saw sacraments as confirmation which is added to the preaching of the word of God . 
 From the end of the sixteenth century through the eighteenth century , a period known as Reformed orthodoxy , Reformed baptismal theology further developed the <unk> meaning of baptism . Theologians more carefully defined the sacramental union of baptism , or the relationship between the outward washing with that which it signifies . In the high orthodox period ( middle to late seventeenth century ) , theologians such as Hermann <unk> expanded the <unk> meaning of baptism using analogies such as Noah 's Ark and the crossing of the Red Sea , which carried the theological themes of the resurrection and eternal life . This period also saw the emergence of Reformed Baptists . Reformed Baptist theologians had much in common with the Reformed , but saw baptism as a sign of the baptized 's fellowship with Christ rather than a sign and seal of the covenant of grace , and as a result did not baptize their children . 
 = = = Modern = = = 
 Friedrich Schleiermacher , an influential nineteenth @-@ century Reformed theologian , saw baptism as the way the church receives new members and taught that faith is a precondition for baptism . He was ambivalent about the practice of infant baptism , teaching that it was not an essential institution , but could be continued as long as the church was faithful in bringing children to confirmation . Schleiermacher also saw baptism as primarily individual rather than initiating one into a covenant community , and rejected the idea that baptism should be connected with Old Testament circumcision . 
 Scottish nineteenth @-@ century Reformed theologian William Cunningham also sought to articulate a distinctively Reformed theology of baptism in the modern world . Cunningham preferred the writings of Zwingli on the sacraments , writing that Calvin and later Reformed orthodox theologians overly elevated the value of the sacraments . He argued that the efficacy of baptism only applies to adults expressing faith in the act of baptism . 
 In the twentieth century , Karl Barth , an influential Swiss Reformed theologian , argued that baptism should not be administered to infants because it represented a completed association with Christ which could only be accepted or rejected by adults . Further , Barth in his later years rejected the idea that baptism was actually used by God to accomplish anything , or could even properly be called a sacrament . Instead , he taught that water baptism is a human act of obedience . His views have been called " neo @-@ Zwinglian " for this reason , and he himself identified Zwingli 's views on sacraments as the believer 's oath as his own . He continued to accept the validity of infant baptisms , and did not believe those baptized as infants should be <unk> . 
 Later Reformed theologians reacted against Barth 's views on baptism by appealing to Calvin , the idea that baptism is a promise rather than an accomplished reality , and the idea of baptism as a replacement of circumcision . Scottish Reformed theologian T.F. Torrance emphasized the idea that baptism is God 's word establishing the church , and that the individual 's response comes after rather than before God 's act in baptism . German Reformed liberation theologian Jürgen <unk> , on the other hand , saw infant baptism as inappropriately associated with the national church . He saw baptism as properly a free response God 's call to discipleship . Reformed churches have generally maintained the practice of infant baptism despite these critiques . 
 = = <unk> theology = = 
 In Reformed theology , sacraments are held to be , along with the word of God preached , the means of grace . In the sacraments , God graciously condescends to use common material objects to communicate divine promises to people . The grace promised consists not only in benefits which God bestows on people , but Christ 's person himself , to whom God unites the believer . Sacraments confirm or ratify the promises communicated in preaching . Both preaching and the sacraments are not merely symbolic and representative of the reality to which they refer , but actually create the reality of saving grace . The sacraments are made efficacious by the Holy Spirit in actually bringing into effect the promises signified in the sacraments . This efficacy is only beneficial , however , for those who have faith . The sacrament remains efficacious regardless of the recipient 's response . Its effect is negative , resulting in judgement , for the faithless ; while it confers Christ and his benefits for the faithful . 
 Reformed theologians believe sacraments to be instituted in the context of covenants between God and people . They believe that when God makes covenants , he provides physical signs associated with the covenant . Old Testament covenant signs include the rainbow which appeared following a covenant made with Noah . Circumcision is believed to be a sign of God 's covenant with Abraham and his descendants . Such signs entail blessings and sanctions on those with whom God covenants . In the New Testament period there are two such signs or sacraments : baptism and the Lord 's Supper . 
 In Reformed sacramental theology , the sign ( in the case of baptism the external washing with water ) may be described in terms of the thing signified ( regeneration , remission of sin , etc . ) , because of the close connection between them . For example , baptism may be said to save , and baptism is often called the " laver of regeneration " . However , there is also a distinction between the sign and thing signified . The sign is seen as a pledge and seal of the inward washing of regeneration and purification . The sacramental union between the sign and thing signified means that the use or purpose of the visible action of the sacrament is changed even as its substance remains the same . 
 = = Meaning = = 
 The Reformed tradition holds that baptism is primarily God 's promise or offer of grace to the baptized . Baptism is said to signify union with Christ in his death , burial , and resurrection . The baptized is made one with Christ 's person , meaning God the Father treats them the same as he treats Christ . Baptism also unites the baptized with Christ 's history , meaning that the person can be said to have died , been buried , and raised again just as Christ was . The baptized person 's identity in Christ is based on Christ 's action in baptism rather than the person 's action . This union also unites Christians to one another . Through the words of institution used in baptism , Christians are also united to each of the members of the trinity . 
 In the Reformed tradition , baptism 's function as a rite of initiation into the church is secondary to its function as a sign of God 's promise of grace . Reformed theologians distinguish between the visible church , which consists of those who publicly claim to have faith in Christ as well as their children ; and the invisible church , which consists of those who actually have faith and have been regenerated . Baptism is believed to make one a member of the visible , rather than the invisible church . It is believed to be impossible to know who is a member of the invisible church . As members of the visible church , baptized Christians are believed to have obligations to live in love and service to Christ and his people . The fulfillment of these obligations is referred to as the " improvement " of one 's baptism . 
 Reformed Christians see baptism as a replacement of circumcision in the Old Testament . Baptism does everything for New Testament Christians that circumcision did for Jews in the Old Testament . Circumcision is seen as a ritual where God 's judgement passes over the person circumcised , only to cut off a part of the flesh , sparing the rest of the person . The " cutting off " of Christ in death is seen as a perfection of circumcision , and in baptism similarly the entire body is subjected to judgement and death in order to be raised again in new life . 
 Reformed Christians believe baptism to be a sign of regeneration , or the making of one into a new creature , based on the connection found in the New Testament between regeneration and washing with water . Baptism also represents forgiveness or remission of sin by the sprinkling of the blood of Christ , similarly to the sprinkling of blood of sacrificial animals . Baptism is held by almost the entire Reformed tradition to effect regeneration , even in infants who are incapable of faith , by effecting faith which would come to fruition later . However , Reformed theologians do not teach that baptism is necessarily bound to the forgiveness of sins . Not everyone who participates in the outward rite of baptism can be said to has had their sins forgiven . Rather , it is necessary that the baptized person participate spiritually by faith in order to receive this benefit . 
 = = Infant baptism = = 
 With some notable exceptions , Reformed Christians baptize infants who are born to believing parents . Reformed Christians do so on the basis of the continuity from the old covenant between God and Israel and the new covenant with the church , since infants were circumcised under the old covenant . They also see God 's saving purpose in the new covenant as having to do with families as well as individuals . Because Reformed Christians believe baptism must be embraced by faith to have any benefit , they recognize that faith may come later in life rather than preceding baptism . Infants may also be said to possess a seed of faith which will come to fruition later , or baptism may be administered based on a promise of faith offered by their sponsors ( usually their parents ) which will be kept at a later age . 
 = = Mode and administration = = 
 Reformed Christians believe that immersion is not necessary for baptism to be properly performed , but that pouring or sprinkling are acceptable . <unk> is said to symbolize the sprinkling of the blood of Christ for the removal of the guilt of sin . Only ordained ministers are permitted to administer baptism in Reformed churches , contrary to the allowance for emergency baptism by midwives in Roman Catholic churches , though baptisms performed by non @-@ ministers are generally considered valid . Reformed churches , while rejecting the baptismal ceremonies of the Roman Catholic church ( such as the use of chrism , salt , and insufflation ) , accept the validity of baptisms performed with them on the basis that the substance of baptism remains . They do not <unk> someone who has been baptized using these ceremonies because baptism is never to be repeated .

 The Webley Revolver ( also known as the Webley Top @-@ Break Revolver or Webley Self @-@ Extracting Revolver ) was , in various marks , the standard issue service pistol for the armed forces of the United Kingdom , the British Empire , and the Commonwealth from 1887 until 1963 . 
 The Webley is a top @-@ break revolver with automatic extraction . That is , breaking the revolver open for reloading also operates the extractor . This removes the spent cartridges from the cylinder . The Webley Mk I service revolver was adopted in 1887 . A later version , the Mk IV , rose to prominence during the Boer War of 1899 – 1902 . However , the Mk VI , introduced in 1915 during the First World War , is perhaps the best @-@ known model . 
 Firing the large .455 Webley cartridge , Webley service revolvers are among the most powerful top @-@ break revolvers ever produced . Although the .455 calibre Webley is no longer in military service , the .38 / 200 Webley Mk IV variant is still in use as a police sidearm in a number of countries . With a modified , " shaved " cylinder and the use of a half moon clip , the Webley Mk VI can fire the 45 ACP cartridge , although overpressure or + P .45 ACP cartridges exceed Webley proof loads and should not be used . Many of the Webley Mk <unk> were converted to fire 45 ACP ammunition after .455 Webley ammunition became increasingly difficult to find .

 The British company Webley & Scott ( P. Webley & Son before merger with W & C Scott in 1897 ) produced a range of revolvers from the mid 19th to late 20th centuries . As early as 1853 P. Webley and J. Webley began production of their first patented single action cap and ball revolvers . Later under the trade name of P. Webley and Son , manufacturing included their own .44 @-@ caliber rim @-@ fire solid frame revolver as well as licensed copies of Smith & Wesson 's Tip up break action revolvers . The quintessential hinged frame , centre @-@ fire revolvers for which the Webley name is best known first began production / development in the early 1870s most notably with the Webley @-@ <unk> ( 1877 ) and Webley @-@ Kaufman ( 1881 ) models . The W.G. or Webley @-@ Government models produced from 1885 through to the early 1900s , ( often incorrectly referred to as the Webley @-@ Green ) are the most popular of the commercial top break revolvers and many were the private purchase choice of English military officers and target shooters in the period , coming in a .476 / .455 calibre . However other short @-@ barrel solid @-@ frame revolvers , including the Webley RIC ( Royal Irish Constabulary ) model and the British Bulldog revolver , designed to be carried in a coat pocket for self @-@ defence were far more commonplace during the period . Today , undoubtedly best @-@ known are the range of military revolvers , which were in service use across two World Wars and numerous colonial conflicts . 
 In 1887 , the British Army was searching for a revolver to replace the largely unsatisfactory .476 Enfield Mk I & Mk II Revolvers , the Enfield having only replaced the solid frame Adams .450 revolver which was a late 1860s conversion of the cap and ball Beaumont – Adams revolver in 1880 . Webley & Scott , who were already very well known makers of quality guns and had sold many pistols on a commercial basis to military officers and civilians alike , tendered the .455 calibre Webley Self @-@ Extracting Revolver for trials . The military was suitably impressed with the revolver ( it was seen as a vast improvement over the Enfield revolvers then in service , which American designed Owen extraction system did not prove particularly satisfactory in service ) , and it was adopted on 8 November 1887 as the " Pistol , Webley , Mk I " . The initial contract called for 10 @,@ 000 Webley revolvers , at a price of £ 3 / 1 / 1 each , with at least 2 @,@ 000 revolvers to be supplied within eight months . 
 The Webley revolver went through a number of changes , culminating in the Mk VI , which was in production between 1915 and 1923 . The large .455 Webley revolvers were retired in 1947 , although the Webley Mk IV .38 / 200 remained in service until 1963 alongside the Enfield No. 2 Mk I revolver . Commercial versions of all Webley service revolvers were also sold on the civilian market , along with a number of similar designs ( such as the Webley @-@ Government and Webley @-@ Wilkinson ) that were not officially adopted for service , but were nonetheless purchased privately by military officers .

 The Webley Mk IV , chambered in .455 Webley , was introduced in 1899 and soon became known as the " Boer War Model " , on account of the large numbers of officers and non @-@ commissioned officers who purchased it on their way to take part in the conflict . The Webley Mk IV served alongside a large number of other handguns , including the Mauser <unk> " <unk> " ( as used by Winston Churchill during the War ) , earlier Beaumont – Adams cartridge revolvers , and other top @-@ break revolvers manufactured by <unk> such as William Tranter , and Kynoch .

 The standard @-@ issue Webley revolver at the outbreak of the First World War was the Webley Mk V ( adopted 9 December 1913 ) , but there were considerably more Mk IV revolvers in service in 1914 , as the initial order for 20 @,@ 000 Mk V revolvers had not been completed when hostilities began . On 24 May 1915 , the Webley Mk VI was adopted as the standard sidearm for British and Commonwealth troops and remained so for the duration of the First World War , being issued to officers , airmen , naval crews , boarding parties , trench raiders , machine @-@ gun teams , and tank crews . The Mk VI proved to be a very reliable and hardy weapon , well suited to the mud and adverse conditions of trench warfare , and several accessories were developed for the Mk VI , including a bayonet ( made from a converted French Gras bayonet ) , <unk> devices ( the " Prideaux Device " and the Watson design ) , and a stock allowing for the revolver to be converted into a carbine . 
 Demand exceeded production , which was already behind as the war began . This forced the British government to buy substitute weapons chambered in .455 Webley from neutral countries . America provided the Smith & Wesson 2nd Model " Hand Ejector " and Colt New Service Revolvers . Spanish gunsmiths in Eibar made decent @-@ quality copies of popular guns and were tapped to cheaply close the gap by making a .455 variant of their <unk> M1884 or " S & W Model 7 <unk> " revolver , a copy of the Smith & Wesson .44 Double Action First Model .

 The official service pistol for the British military during the Second World War was the Enfield No. 2 Mk I .38 / 200 calibre revolver , . Owing to a critical shortage of handguns , a number of other weapons were also adopted ( first practically , then officially ) to alleviate the shortage . As a result , both the Webley Mk IV in .38 / 200 and Webley Mk VI in .455 calibre were issued to personnel during the war .

 The Webley Mk VI ( .455 ) and Mk IV ( .38 / 200 ) revolvers were still issued to British and Commonwealth Forces after the Second World War ; there were now extensive stockpiles of the revolvers in military stores . An armourer stationed in West Germany recalled ( admittedly tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek ) that by the time they were officially retired in 1963 , the ammunition allowance was " two cartridges per man , per year . " This lack of ammunition was instrumental in keeping the Enfield and Webley revolvers in use so long : they were not wearing out because they were not being used . 
 The Webley Mk IV .38 revolver was not completely replaced by the Browning Hi @-@ Power until 1963 , and saw use in the Korean War , the Suez Crisis , Malayan Emergency , and the Rhodesian Bush War .

Singaporean police ( and some other " officials " ) <unk> were equipped with safety catches , a rather unusual feature in a revolver . These were gradually retired in the 1970s as they came in for repair , and were replaced with Smith & Wesson Model 10 .38 revolvers . The London Metropolitan Police were also known to use Webley revolvers , as were most colonial police units until just after the Second World War . There may still be some police units with Webley Mk IV revolvers that , whilst not issued , are still present in the armoury . 
 The Ordnance Factory Board of India still manufactures .380 Revolver Mk <unk> cartridges , as well as a .32 calibre revolver ( the <unk> .32 Revolver ) with 2 @-@ inch ( 51 mm ) barrel which is clearly based on the Webley Mk IV .38 service pistol .

 There were six different marks of .455 calibre Webley British Government Model revolvers approved for British military service at various times between 1887 and the end of the First World War : 
 Mk I : The first Webley self @-@ extracting revolver adopted for service , officially adopted 8 November 1887 , with a 4 @-@ inch ( 100 mm ) barrel and " bird 's beak " style grips . Mk I * was a factory upgrade of Mk I revolvers to match the Mk II . 
 Mk II : Similar to the Mk I , with modifications to the hammer and grip shape , as well as a hardened steel shield for the blast @-@ shield . Officially adopted 21 May 1895 , with a 4 @-@ inch ( 100 mm ) barrel . 
 Mk III : Identical to Mk II , but with modifications to the cylinder cam and related parts . Officially adopted 5 October 1897 , most not issued , with exception of a number that were marked with the " broad arrow " acceptance stamp on the top strap . These few went to Royal Navy Service . 
 Mk IV : The " Boer War " Model . Manufactured using much higher quality steel and case hardened parts , with the cylinder axis being a fixed part of the barrel and modifications to various other parts , including a re @-@ designed blast @-@ shield . Officially adopted 21 July 1899 , with a 4 @-@ inch ( 100 mm ) barrel . 
 Mk V : Similar to the Mk IV , but with cylinders 0 @.@ 12 @-@ inch ( 3 @.@ 0 mm ) wider to allow for the use of nitrocellulose propellant @-@ based cartridges . Officially adopted 9 December 1913 , with a 4 @-@ inch ( 100 mm ) barrel , although some models produced in 1915 had 5 @-@ inch ( 130 mm ) and 6 @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) barrels . 
 Mk VI : Similar to the Mk V , but with a squared @-@ off " target " style grip ( as opposed to the " bird 's @-@ beak " style found on earlier marks and models ) and a 6 @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) barrel . Officially adopted 24 May 1915 , and also manufactured by RSAF Enfield under the designation Pistol , Revolver , Webley , No. 1 Mk VI 1921 – 1926 .

 At the end of the First World War , the British military decided that the .455 calibre gun and cartridge was too large for modern military use and — after numerous tests and extensive trials — that a pistol in .38 calibre firing a 200 @-@ grain ( 13 g ) bullet would be just as effective as the .455 for stopping an enemy . 
 Webley & Scott immediately tendered the .38 / 200 calibre Webley Mk IV revolver , which as well as being nearly identical in appearance to the .455 calibre Mk VI revolver ( albeit scaled down for the smaller cartridge ) , was based on their .38 calibre Webley Mk III pistol , designed for the police and civilian markets . Much to their surprise , the British Government took the design to the Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield Lock , which came up with a revolver that was externally very similar looking to the .38 / 200 calibre Webley Mk IV , but was internally different enough that no parts from the Webley could be used in the Enfield and vice versa . The Enfield @-@ designed pistol was quickly accepted under the designation Pistol , Revolver , No. 2 Mk I , and was adopted in 1932 , followed in 1938 by the Mk I * ( <unk> hammer , double action only ) , and finally the Mk I * * ( simplified for wartime production ) in 1942 . 
 Webley & Scott sued the British Government over the incident , claiming £ 2250 as " costs involved in the research and design " of the revolver . This was contested by RSAF Enfield , which quite firmly stated that the Enfield No. 2 Mk I was designed by Captain Boys ( the Assistant Superintendent of Design , later of Boys Anti @-@ Tank Rifle fame ) with assistance from Webley & Scott , and not the other way around . Accordingly , their claim was denied . By way of compensation , the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors eventually awarded Webley & Scott £ 1250 for their work . 
 RSAF Enfield proved unable to manufacture enough No. 2 revolvers to meet the military 's wartime demands , and as a result Webley 's Mk IV was also widely used within the British Army in World War Two .

It was originally released as a PC game for CD @-@ ROM on December 13 , 2002 and subsequently re @-@ released on DVD @-@ ROM and for the PlayStation 2 with certain scenes removed . The title Popotan is nonsensical word meant to reflect the prominence of dandelions , spelled <unk> ( <unk> ) in Japanese ; Petite Ferret also produced a fan disc shortly before the DVD @-@ ROM re @-@ release . Popotan has been adapted to other media , including a novel series ( Popotan ～ Himitsu no <unk> ～ Kōhen ) by <unk> <unk> ; manga series by <unk> Izumi ; twelve episode anime directed by Shinichiro Kimura and licensed in North America by Geneon USA and later , Sentai Filmworks ; radio drama ( Poporaji ) ; and several art and reference books . 
 Gameplay in Popotan follows a semi @-@ predetermined plot ; major events remain the same , but personal storylines can diverge from the player 's choices . The game focuses on protagonist Chris , a drifter who meets three girls and their maid in a mansion near the ruins of Tokyo in the distant future . The player 's goal is to make available sexual scenes and images that the player can view or replay at any time depicting the protagonist having sexual intercourse with one of the girls . The player can pursue other girls once they have finished one of the sisters ' storylines . 
 Sales of the visual novel and its fan disc made the top 50 list of bestselling bishōjo games in Japan multiple times and it spawned an internet meme when the opening was put to sped @-@ up music by the Swedish band Caramell . Reception of the anime has been mixed with those who reviewed the first volume critical of the anime 's sexual themes , especially with regard to Mii , while those who reviewed the series as a whole have tended to give overall more positive reviews , praising the story 's unexpected depth . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Popotan is a visual novel in which players spend most of their time in reading dynamic text , representing either dialogue between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist . After progressing through text , players either come to a " decision point " where they must choose from multiple options , or the text will end and the player must move to a new location , or , in the DVD @-@ ROM and PS2 versions , use a shortcut option to continue to the next event . Time elapsed between decision points varies . The game pauses at these points and , depending on which choice the player makes , the plot will progress and may branch off in a specific direction . The player must romantically pursue the three sisters , and can seek other characters if one of the sisters ' scenarios has been completed . 
 A special music mini @-@ game commences at certain points in Mii 's scenario . The goal of the mini @-@ game is to max out " Magical Girl Mii " ' s magical power meter by hitting balls at the right moment . The outcome of the mini @-@ game affects the storyline . Successfully completing her scenarios unlock an omake option on the main menu , allowing the player to play the mini @-@ game with different music tracks . Finishing Ai 's scenario unlocks a new story featuring Unagi . The player can save the game only while text is on the screen in the PC versions ; this limitation was removed in the PS2 port . The PS2 port also altered the events and scenes based on the DVD version .

 The player assumes the role of Chris , the protagonist of Popotan . Chris is a high school dropout who dislikes the direction of society and refuses to get a job . He wanders the streets making a living as a guitar @-@ playing busker . He feels he cannot play well without an audience , which is hard to find as a drifter . The other main characters include three sisters and their maid who live in a western @-@ style mansion . Ai is the eldest of the three and communicates with plants . Mai is the middle sister ; she is a tomboy and disapproves of Chris 's behavior . Mii is the youngest and the most energetic ; she often cosplays as " Magical Girl Mii " and helps people . Their maid Mea appears emotionless at first , but reveals hidden depth later in the story .

 Popotan takes place in the distant future within the remnants of Tokyo , destroyed by a cataclysm and since altered by geological transformations . The disaster was caused by a giant dandelion structure resembling a spire that arose in the city atop a hill . The main location of the game is a European @-@ style mansion , seen as completely out @-@ of @-@ place in the city . Much of the daytime is spent outside the mansion wandering around town meeting characters and triggering event sequences . 
 Popotan follows Chris 's lifestyle changes , as well as the mysteries surrounding the spire @-@ like object that caused the destruction of Tokyo in the past . The story opens as Chris desperately considers stealing food from a stand near a shrine entrance . His theft is unsuccessful , and he wanders around town looking for work . He finds a convenience store , where he gets directions leading him to the mansion . He enters without asking permission and runs into the three sisters and their lifelike android maid . Chris asks permission to stay because the rent is cheap and the girls are pretty ; they consent , but force him to take a part @-@ time job . The convenience store owner hires him , and as the story progresses , Chris opens up socially and begins caring about others as he interacts with the girls . He also meets new friends , including a classmate Konami , a local shrine maiden named Nono and a mysterious girl named Shizuku . 
 = = Development = = 
 Petit Ferret developed Popotan in 2002 . Seki Hayabusa and <unk> Shimizu handled scenario development , and Akio Watanabe designed its characters while working under the alias <unk> ♥ Rock . Higuchi Hideki and <unk> Masahiro composed music for the series ; Under17 contributed theme music with vocals . Petite Ferret created over 1 @,@ 000 two @-@ dimensional computer graphics for backgrounds , events , and character poses . Though only characters ' mouths and eyes are animated , numerous poses exist for both major and minor characters ; Petit Ferret created slightly fewer graphics for the latter to reduce production costs . The game uses a character placement system to display the characters relative to the protagonist ; distant characters appear small , and grow larger as the player approaches them . 
 Petit Ferret requested applications for Japanese voice actresses from May to June 2002 , seeking to fill the roles of the three sisters first . Satisfied with the applicants , Petit Ferret held open auditions for other roles starting June 30 , 2002 . WellMADE produced and distributed the PS2 port , Oshiete ! Popotan ( <unk> ! ぽぽたん ) , based on the DVD @-@ ROM version of the original game . Petit Ferret made Akio Watanabe project supervisor for the PS2 port .

 Petit Ferret released a trial version of Popotan for download on November 25 , 2002 and released the full PC version on one CD @-@ ROM the following December 13 . To increase pre @-@ order sales , Ferret packaged the initial CD @-@ ROM release of Popotan with a special maxi single CD of Under17 's theme songs . The firm then released a fan disc on July 11 , 2003 titled Popotan Fan Disc : Issho ni A @-@ SO @-@ BO ( <unk> <unk> ・ SO ・ BO ? , Popotan Fan Disc : Let 's P @-@ L @-@ A @-@ Y Together ) . The disc includes several character @-@ based mini @-@ games ( including the original 's " Magical Girl Mii " mini @-@ game ) , new storyline content and routes based around Mii and Nono , a separate music CD containing background music from the original game , themed computer wallpaper , and desktop accessories . Some of the items must be unlocked . The fan disc preceded a re @-@ release of the main game as Popotan Po ! on August 1 , 2003 as a DVD @-@ ROM with game enhancements ; it would be Petit Ferret 's last official release . WellMADE produced a PS2 port named Oshiete ! Popotan , released March 11 , 2004 . Scenes in the port were changed or removed to comply with Sony 's ban on sexual content , but the release still warranted CERO 18 rating . Later , after the CERO revised its rating system , it was given a CERO D rating . WellMADE tried to compensate for their absence with graphics and gameplay improvements . WellMADE enticed buyers of the port with a bonus themed calling card , reversible poster , and music CD . WellMADE also released two free spinoff games in December 2003 and March 2004 , collectively named Unagi Fuku <unk> ( <unk> ) and featuring Unagi as the heroine . WellMADE designed the games to be humorous and fun ; the second allows Unagi to transform into her humanoid form after a certain point in the story . 
 The initial limited edition release of Popotan on CD @-@ ROM suffered critical errors , such as graphic display issues , saving and loading issues , the inability to complete some routes and Mii 's mini @-@ game not starting . Petite Ferret issued a patch on January 10 , 2003 . Later versions of the game were released bug @-@ free . 
 Issho ni A @-@ SO @-@ BO also contained several serious errors . Petit Ferret addressed these issues in two patches . The first patch added missing voice data from the original game CD ; customers were given the option of downloading the patch or exchanging for a new CD . Ferret released the second patch on July 7 , 2003 ; it corrected grammatical errors , adjusted the game 's difficulty , and enhanced stability . The second patch did not contain the first 's fixes .

 = = = = Setting and plot = = = = 
 An adaptation of the visual novel , the anime takes place in an alternate reality . The main female characters and their relations are unchanged , but the storyline is unrelated to the game 's . The plot follows the perspective of the three sisters and their maid rather than the game 's protagonist ; all the game 's major female characters appear and many of the minor characters are used in supporting or cameo roles . 
 The story centers around the three sisters as they travel through time in a mansion , run a Christmas shop , and search for the dandelion @-@ resembling " <unk> " . The sisters interact with others and try to improve their situations . The anime suggests that others , including the antagonist Keith , have attempted similar journeys in the past . The anime otherwise covers little backstory , obscuring the reason for why Shizuku , Keith and Mea are associated . The sisters meet Shizuku while traveling through time , who gives them the option to continue journeying or stay in the era they enjoy most ; they choose the former . The story ends as they continue traveling through time , leaving unanswered questions concerning their final destination and why they were chosen . 
 Their bodies are connected to the mansion where they live , which allows them to travel through time . Their bodies cease to age outside the mansion ; even their hair stops growing . They jump five years into the future when traveling through time and always arrive in different places , except for a split @-@ party scenario in which Mai and Mea are left behind .

 The first English Popotan DVD met mixed reviews in the United States . Anime Jump gave it 1 ½ stars , stating that beyond the pretty pictures , " it is created specifically to sell DVDs , tiny figurines , and other merchandise to introverted adult men . " DVDtalk gave it a final rating of " recommended " and only criticized the bonus content . The reviewer remarked that the first disc " [ ... ] was full of surprises for even a jaded old reviewer like myself . " Anime News Network held mixed attitudes towards the second DVD , citing certain characters and the level of nudity . Its reviewers praised Popotan 's storyline , considering it especially complex for a video game @-@ based anime . Popotan has proven notoriously difficult for English reviewers to categorize , leading several to praise its multi @-@ genre style and appeal . 
 Critics who reviewed only the first DVD gave the series more negative marks than those who reviewed it in full . Of the latter , Allmovie gave Popotan 4 / 5 stars and DVDtalk awarded it " recommended " status , citing the first two discs . Examining the Sentai Filmworks re @-@ release , Theron Martin concurred that the anime improved towards the end despite rushed plot development . He gave the series low marks overall , feeling its quality varied wildly each episode . 
 The level of nudity and its importance to the storyline have been widely debated . John Oppliger of Anime Nation feels explicit nudity ruined the Popotan anime , overshadowing its character depth and complex storyline . Anime News Network and Mania agreed that it was excessive ; one reviewer from the former likened it to " kiddy porn " and another attributed its re @-@ release to demand for nudity . DVDtalk 's reviewers were mixed ; one claimed the nude scenes were out @-@ of @-@ place , and another considered them appropriate . Both considered the overall use of nudity to be " minor " . 
 Critics have generally praised the animation and Akio Watanabe 's character design . Despite chiding the plot , Mark Tools found the character design " memorable " ; reviewer Theron Martin disagreed . <unk> Tezuka ( <unk> , Tezuka <unk> ) found praise for his minimalist approach to the score . Geneon 's voice acting also elicited good reception , credited to Rob <unk> , Popotan 's English voice director . Mii is the only protagonist criticized for her voice acting ; reviewers particularly praised Mea 's voice . 
 = 2007 Giro d 'Italia = 
 The 2007 Giro d 'Italia was the 90th running of the Giro d 'Italia , one of cycling 's Grand Tours . It took place from 12 May to 3 June 2007 . The race began in Sardinia and finished in Milan , and featured five mountain top finishes , of which one was an individual time trial . The race also visited France and Austria in three stages . 
 Danilo Di Luca of the Liquigas team won the race , with Andy Schleck from Team CSC and Eddy Mazzoleni from Astana rounding out the podium . Schleck also won the youth classification , which featured in the Giro for the first time since 1994 . Di Luca 's team dominated the overall classification , holding the race leader 's pink jersey for 17 of the 21 stages . 
 During the race , Alessandro Petacchi tested positive for elevated levels of salbutamol at a doping control on 23 May , after winning Stage 11 . Petacchi has a medical exemption to use salbutamol in the treatment of asthma , but the concentration of the drug in his urine sample from this control was above the therapeutically accepted level . Though the Italian Cycling Federation originally refused to punish him , the Italian National Olympic Committee appealed the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport , resulting in a suspension for the rider and forfeiture of all his results from the Giro .

 The Giro , along with the season 's other Grand Tours ( the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España ) , was one of several events run in 2007 as a UCI ProTour event but without a ProTour license . This meant that while ProTour points were awarded in the race , the organizers were not obligated to invite the 20 ProTour teams . Nineteen of the twenty ProTour teams , <unk> being the exception , were invited , with three UCI Professional Continental teams rounding out the event 's 22 @-@ team peloton . Each team entered nine riders , so the race began with 198 in total . 
 The 22 teams who took part in the race were :

 In the months leading up to the Giro , headlines centered on defending champion Ivan Basso . After having been removed from Team CSC 's start list for the 2006 Tour de France due to his apparent involvement in the Operación Puerto doping case , Basso and Team CSC mutually agreed on the termination of his contract with them . Days later , Basso appeared to be cleared of any connection to Puerto , as the Italian Cycling Federation ( FCI ) shelved his case , and he signed with Discovery Channel . He rode part of the 2007 season with Discovery , and had intended to seek overall victory both in this Giro and in the 2007 Tour de France with his new team . In April 2007 , Basso 's case was re @-@ opened by the FCI , a step rarely taken on cases formally shelved . Facing further investigations into his involvement with the doping ring , team Discovery asked him to stop racing late in April . Shortly afterward , just two weeks before the Giro was to begin , Basso terminated his contract with Discovery , meaning the Giro started without its defending champion . Basso subsequently admitted to planning on doping in the 2006 Tour , and the FCI handed him a two @-@ year suspension , with credit for time already served in 2006 after he was first connected to the doping ring . Paolo Bettini , the reigning world champion , wore bib number one in Basso 's place . 
 Basso 's removal left wide open the possibilities for overall victory in this Giro . Four former Giro winners started this race – Damiano Cunego , Paolo Savoldelli , Gilberto Simoni , and Stefano Garzelli – and they were expected to be among the favorites . Simoni 's Saunier Duval – Prodir team was noted to contain many strong climbers , including Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli . The passage of the Giro over Monte Zoncolan , where Simoni won a stage en route to overall victory in the 2003 Giro d 'Italia , was also noted as a factor in his favor . Classics specialist Danilo Di Luca of Liquigas was also named as a contender , chiefly because of his strong team . Further riders named as contenders included Pietro <unk> and Yaroslav Popovych . 
 The most high @-@ profile sprinters lined up to begin the 2007 Giro were Alessandro Petacchi and Robbie McEwen . They , along with countrymen Mario Cipollini and Baden Cooke , had had a back @-@ and @-@ forth rivalry for sprinting supremacy that had gone back several years but had been stunted in 2006 when Petacchi missed most of the season , including all but the first three stages of the Giro , due to a fractured kneecap sustained from a crash . One pre @-@ race analysis viewed Petacchi 's 2007 Giro and season as a chance at redemption for him . Other fast men in the race noted to be contenders in the flat stages included two @-@ time points classification winner Bettini , Danilo Napolitano , and Graeme Brown . 
 = = Route and stages = = 
 Race director Angelo Zomegnan commented that the route was designed to be easier than that of the extremely climbing @-@ intensive 2006 Giro . The Giro 's twenty @-@ one stages were divided into the following classifications : three time trials ( one team and two individual ) , eleven flat or undulating stages ( officially there was no distinction made between flat and undulating ) , four intermediate stages , and three mountain stages . The race began with a team time trial on the island of Sardinia . This was followed by two flat stages and an unusually early rest day to transfer from Sardinia to Italy 's mainland . The riders transferred by plane while the Giro caravan , race officials and team cars made the trip by boat . The final stage , as was tradition , was a flat , mostly ceremonial road stage to Milan , finishing with ten circuits on the Corso Venezia of the Via <unk> . 
 There were three stages that began or ended outside Italy . Stage 12 , the first high mountain stage , ended at the French city Briançon , a frequent destination for the Tour de France . The 16th stage ended at Lienz in Austria , and the 17th began there . 
 Five stages ended with climbs . Stage 4 , the first intermediate stage , ended at Montevergine di Mercogliano at 1 @,@ 260 m ( 4 @,@ 130 ft ) . The tenth stage , also classified intermediate , had a less imposing final climb of 760 m ( 2 @,@ 490 ft ) , but it was nonetheless expected to change the race 's overall standings as it was very long it had numerous small climbs . Stage 13 was a climbing time trial , to Santuario di Oropa at 1 @,@ 142 m ( 3 @,@ 747 ft ) , with gradients on the climb reaching as high as 13 % . Two stages later was perhaps the race 's most difficult stage , featuring four major climbs and ending at 2 @,@ 304 m ( 7 @,@ 559 ft ) at Tre Cime di Lavaredo . The last mountaintop arrival was in the seventeenth stage , and featured one of the hardest climbs in the world , Monte Zoncolan . Though the summit of this climb was lesser than some other peaks visited in the race , at 1 @,@ 730 m ( 5 @,@ 680 ft ) , its gradients were crushing , with the steepest stretches reaching over 20 % incline . Though the number of mountain stages was small , it was nonetheless expected that it would take a strong climber to win the race . 
 = = Race overview = = 
 The Giro began with a team time trial on the island of Sardinia . The winning team was Liquigas , but due to unusual stage @-@ ending tactics , it was Enrico Gasparotto and not team leader Danilo Di Luca who took the first pink jersey . Gasparotto faced intense questioning from his teammates and the media after not yielding first position to his team 's captain , as is usual practice in a team time trial . Gasparotto yielded the jersey to Di Luca after stage 2 , when Di Luca finished higher @-@ placed in the mass finish , but took it back again after stage 3 when he contested the sprint and finished eighth . Finally , after stage 4 , the six @-@ way tie involving the Liquigas riders who finished together in the team time trial was broken , as Di Luca won the stage into Montevergine and took the pink jersey again . 
 Di Luca held the race lead until the conclusion of stage 6 , which was decided by a breakaway . Luis Felipe Laverde and Marco Pinotti were the last members of a five @-@ man morning breakaway still together at the finish . Since Pinotti started the day better @-@ placed in the overall classification and became the new race leader because of their time gap over the peloton , he allowed Laverde to take the stage win . Laverde took the green jersey as mountains classification leader after the stage . The next three stages were flat and contested among sprinters and breakaways . This meant Pinotti was able to maintain his race lead with little difficulty , until stage 10 , the Giro 's next intermediate stage . The race 's overall contenders showed themselves on this stage , with Leonardo Piepoli putting in a decisive attack 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) from the summit of the Santuario Nostra Signora della Guardia to claim victory by 19 seconds over Di Luca . Pinotti finished more than four minutes back , and surrendered the pink jersey to Di Luca 's teammate Andrea Noè , who was tenth on the stage . At age 38 , Noè was the oldest rider in the Giro and the oldest ever to lead a Grand Tour . Di Luca took the green jersey after this stage , his second stint in the maglia verde to go along with his two in pink . Team CSC 's Andy Schleck took the white jersey after this stage by finishing third , after Di Luca passed him for second in the final kilometer . 
 Stage 12 into Briançon in France was the Giro 's first high mountain stage , and it shook up the standings for the final time . Di Luca took the stage win , twice attacking from an elite group of five that had made the climb together . As Noè finished nearly ten minutes behind , Di Luca took the pink jersey for a third time , while still holding the green jersey . As Di Luca concentrated on winning the race overall , Piepoli took the green jersey after stage 15 , the race 's queen stage , topping two of that stage 's climbs in first position . His lead in the mountains classification quickly became unassailable , and he won the jersey in Milan . It was also on this stage that Astana 's Eddy Mazzoleni distinguished himself as a podium contender , taking a minute and a half out of Di Luca to move into second overall . Schleck lost time to Di Luca and Mazzoleni , but gained time over other riders in the top of the overall standings and stood third overall . 
 The last minor change to the top of the overall standings took place during stage 17 , to Monte Zoncolan . The stage itself was conquered by the Saunier Duval – Prodir duo of Gilberto Simoni and Piepoli . Since the climb had personal significance for Simoni , having won a stage there four years earlier , his teammate allowed him to cross the line first . Schleck , for his part , was third , just seven seconds back , and gained over two minutes against Mazzoleni to move up to the second step of the podium . Mazzoleni fell to fifth on this stage , but returned to the podium after the race 's final time trial . Mazzoleni 's teammate Paolo Savoldelli won the stage by a comfortable margin , but Mazzoleni took back nearly all the time he had lost on the Zoncolan stage and finished the race third overall . Di Luca was not seriously challenged after taking the race lead in stage 12 , and comfortably won the Giro in Milan with a two @-@ minute gap over Schleck in second . 
 Di Luca 's team Liquigas was dominant . They took three stage wins , two with Di Luca himself to go along with the race 's opening team time trial , and held the pink jersey for all but four days . With Alessandro Petacchi 's disqualification ( see below ) , Saunier Duval @-@ Prodir took the most stage wins . Three of their victories came in the high mountains , with Piepoli , Riccò , and Simoni all winning high @-@ profile stages . Iban Mayo added a breakaway win in Stage 18 . Acqua & Sapone – Caffè <unk> team leader Stefano Garzelli , a former Giro winner , also won two stages . Danilo Napolitano and Marzio Bruseghin both took wins for Lampre – <unk> , and four other teams were single stage winners . The teams classifications and the classifications which awarded jerseys were all won by teams who had won stages , meaning eight of the 22 teams in the race took significant victories .

 The most noteworthy doping case from the 2007 Giro involved sprinter Alessandro Petacchi .

Petacchi was obligated as the stage winner to give a urine sample to the doping authorities , and it had a concentration of 1 @,@ 352 nanograms per milliliter of salbutamol , above the 1 @,@ 000 allowed by the medical exemption . <unk> has anabolic effects at high concentrations . Team Milram placed Petacchi on immediate provisional suspension following the Giro , which kept him from participating in the Tour de France later that season as he had planned . The Italian National Olympic Committee ( CONI ) asked the Italian Cycling Federation ( FCI ) for a one @-@ year ban for Petacchi . 
 The FCI refused to suspend Petacchi , and he returned to racing in late July . Their decision , however , was not made to exonerate Petacchi , but rather because they did not believe they should hear the case , instead deferring to the Court of Arbitration for Sport ( CAS ) . The CAS heard the case , and Petacchi testified to the court , stating that the hot and humid day on which the stage was the run had made it so that he took several extra puffs from his inhaler , but that this was accidental and that most had come after he had already crossed the finish line and won the stage . 
 In its decision , the CAS ruled that Petacchi had likely not intended to cheat , but that he had not exercised the " utmost caution " it deemed necessary to abide by doping rules . Petacchi was suspended for a year , minus the time he had already sat out after Team Milram first provisionally suspended him , and his results from the Giro were all stripped . Team Milram subsequently fired Petacchi , and he was without a team until late in the 2008 season . While the court 's decision explicitly stripped Petacchi of his results from this race , it does not seem that it granted those victories retroactively to other riders . 
 Petacchi was not the only rider identified as giving a non @-@ negative doping test during the Giro . Reports emerged in June that three riders were under suspicion of doping , later identified as Petacchi , Leonardo Piepoli , and Iban Mayo . Petacchi and Piepoli both gave tests showing elevated levels of salbutamol , while Mayo 's had abnormally high testosterone levels . Mayo was quickly cleared , as further testing revealed that his testosterone levels were of natural origin and that his team Saunier Duval – Prodir had informed the UCI of this . Though Piepoli 's level of salbutamol was , at 1 @,@ 800 nanograms per milliliter , even higher than Petacchi 's , he was cleared by his national federation of any doping charges in August . 
 Giro champion Danilo Di Luca also gave an irregular doping test , after stage 17 to Monte Zoncolan . The test , given spontaneously hours after the routine test Di Luca gave for being race leader at the time , reportedly showed hormone levels like " those of a child , " causing anti @-@ doping authorities to suspect that Di Luca was using some means to cover the presence of banned substances . These unusual levels were not present in the routine test , leading to suspicions that Di Luca had received an autologous blood transfusion between the two tests . A CONI commission later cleared Di Luca on the basis of insufficient evidence to conclude that he had doped . 
 Mayo and Piepoli would both test positive for erythropoietin later in their careers at the Tour de France , and Di Luca likewise at the 2009 Giro d 'Italia , all leading to lengthy suspensions , while Petacchi made a successful return to top @-@ level cycling and to the Giro in 2009 . 
 = = Classification leadership = = 
 In the 2007 Giro d 'Italia , four different jerseys were awarded . For the general classification , calculated by adding each cyclist 's finishing times on each stage , and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass start stages , the leader received a pink jersey . This classification is considered the most important of the Giro d 'Italia , and the winner is considered the winner of the Giro . 
 Additionally , there was a points classification , which awarded a mauve jersey . In the points classification , cyclists got points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage . The stage win awarded 25 points , second place awarded 20 points , third 16 , fourth 14 , fifth 12 , sixth 10 , and one point less per place down the line , to a single point for 15th . In addition , some points could be won in intermediate sprints . 
 There was also a mountains classification , which awarded a green jersey . In the mountains classifications , points were won by reaching the top of a mountain before other cyclists . Each climb was categorized , either first , second , or third category , with more points available for the higher @-@ categorized climbs . The highest point in the Giro ( called the Cima Coppi ) , which in 2007 was the Colle dell <unk> in stage 12 , afforded still more points than the other first @-@ category climbs . 
 The fourth was the young rider classification , which awarded a white jersey . This was decided the same way as the general classification , but only riders born on or after 1 January 1982 were eligible . This classification was featured in the Giro in 2007 for the first time since 1994 . 
 There were also two classifications for teams . The first was the Trofeo Fast Team . In this classification , the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage are added , and the team with the lowest time is leading team . The Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification , with the top 20 placed riders on each stage earning points ( 20 for first place , 19 for second place and so on , down to a single point for 20th ) for their team . 
 The rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run . A year after the race , Alessandro Petacchi was stripped of all his results ; this table reflects the stages and jersey awards he originally won . 
 = = Final standings = = 
 = = = Minor classifications = = = 
 Other less well @-@ known classifications were awarded during the Giro , whose leaders did not receive a special jersey . These awards were based on points earned throughout the three weeks of the tour . Each mass start stage had one intermediate sprint , awarding points to the Traguardo Volante Garibaldi classification . These sprints gave bonus seconds towards the general classification , points towards the regular points classification , and also points towards the Traguardo Volante Garibaldi . This award was known in previous years as the Intergiro , and was previously time @-@ based , awarding a blue jersey . Tinkoff Credit Systems rider Mikhail Ignatiev won this classification . 
 Additional minor classifications included the combativity classification , which was a compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints , mountain passes and stage finishes . Alessandro Petacchi was the original winner , but with all his 2007 Giro results forfeited , it appears there is no official winner of this award . The Azzurri d 'Italia classification was based on finishing order , but points were awarded only to the top three finishers in each stage . Petacchi originally won this as well . 
 Also , the Trofeo Fuga <unk> rewarded riders who took part in a breakaway at the head of the field , each rider in an escape of ten or fewer riders getting one point for each kilometre that the group stays clear . Along with the Traguardo Volante <unk> , Mikhail Ignatiev also finished first in this classification . Teams were given penalty points for minor technical infringements . Française des Jeux was not assessed any penalties , and so was the winner of the Fair Play classification .

 Glacier Bay Basin in southeastern Alaska , in the United States , encompasses the Glacier Bay and surrounding mountains and glaciers , which was first proclaimed a U.S. National Monument on February 25 , 1925 , and which was later , on December 2 , 1980 , enlarged and designated as the Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act , covering an area of 3 @,@ 283 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 329 @,@ 000 ha ) . In 1986 , UNESCO declared an area of 57 @,@ 000 acres ( 23 @,@ 000 ha ) within a World Biosphere Reserve . This is the largest UNESCO protected biosphere in the world . In 1992 , UNESCO included this area as a part of a World Heritage site , extending over an area of 24 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 98 @,@ 000 km2 ) which also included the Wrangell @-@ St. Elias National Park , <unk> National Park ( Canada ) and Tatshenshini @-@ Alsek Park ( Canada ) . Part of the National Park is also designated a Wilderness area covering 2 @,@ 658 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 076 @,@ 000 ha ) . 
 Glacier Bay , the body of water , covers an area 1 @,@ 375 square miles ( 3 @,@ 560 km2 ) of glaciers and accounts for 27 % of the Park area . It was a large single glacier of solid ice till early 18th century . It started retreating and evolved over the centuries into the largest protected water area park in the world . Glacier Bay , on the Gulf of Alaska , was known as the Grand Pacific Glacier about 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) thick and about 20 miles ( 32 km ) in width which has since then , over the last more than 200 years retreated by 65 miles ( 105 km ) to the head of the bay at Tarr Inlet , and in this process left separate 20 other glaciers in its trail . In 1890 , the name “ Glacier Bay ” as such was given to the bay by Captain Lester A. Beardslee of the U.S. Navy . It was first proclaimed a U.S. National Monument on February 25 , 1925 , by President Calvin Coolidge . 
 The Glacier Bay has many branches , inlets , lagoons , islands , and channels that holds prospects for scientific exploration and visual treat . Thus , the area is popular as a cruise ship destination during summer season . However , there are restrictions imposed by the National Park Service on the numbers of vessels that can operate in a day to 2 cruise ships , 3 tour boats , 6 charter vessels , and 25 private vessels . According to National Park Service statistics for calendar year 2009 , 444 @,@ 653 people visited Glacier Bay , with 422 @,@ 919 of those being cruise ship passengers . 
 = = History = = 
 Geologists believe that Glacier Bay existed during a minimum of four Glacial periods ending with the Little Ice Age , which has a 4 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old record , as the latest period . All glaciers in the park today are said to be remnants of this glacial period . 
 The earliest recorded history of the Glacier Bay area starts with the 1741 Russian expedition of Vitus Bering and Aleksei Chirikov . La Perouse ( after whom one of the glaciers in the bay was named subsequently ) established contact with the local inhabitants , the Tlingits at <unk> Bay , in 1786 . This was followed by the Russians staking their claim to the region . 
 In 1794 , Joseph Whidbey , master of the Discovery during George Vancouver 's 1791 @-@ 95 expedition , reported that his exploration of this part of the coast was blocked by a wall of 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) width and 1 @,@ 200 metres ( 3 @,@ 900 ft ) ) thick . Vancouver claimed the land for Britain in conflict with an earlier Russian claim , which was resolved by the Anglo @-@ Russian Convention of 1825 . The United States purchased Alaska from the Russians in 1867 with a claim under that treaty of owning all lands up to " the summit of the mountains situated parallel to the coast " . The United States and Canada agreed that an arbitration board would draw the exact boundary . The arbitration award given in 1903 resolved the Alaska boundary dispute by drawing a line that linked the mountain peaks in this area . Because the agreement froze the exact boundary in 1903 , further retreat of the glacier does not alter the boundary as the coast extends northward . As a result , the northern edge of Tarr Inlet is approaching the boundary . 
 With the discovery of gold in the area , gold rush brought miners to the area . In 1890 , Willoughby Island in Glacier Bay was the scene of a meeting of the miners , which was followed by the establishment of the Berry mining district . In the 1890s , a salt mine was established at Bartlett Cove . Fox farms and a cannery were also established ; however , the cannery was abandoned in 1935 . 
 John Muir , the naturalist , conservationist and scientist , pioneered the focus of the world on the Glacier Bay phenomenon . During his research Muir had witnessed the glaciers in action . He had noted that the ice had retreated almost all the way up . In 1888 ( 1889 is also mentioned in some references ) when John Muir first visited the Bay , this wall was 48 miles ( 77 km ) and retreated from the sea by 44 miles ( 71 km ) . Now , it stands retreated to 65 miles ( 105 km ) , as a remnant of the old wall of the glacier system and has 16 major tidewater glaciers ( 10 , 12 and 15 are also mentioned in some references ) . 
 In 1899 , wealthy railroad magnate Edward Harriman arranged for a maritime expedition called the Harriman Alaska Expedition to Alaska comprising an elite community of scientists , artists , photographers , and naturalists to explore and document the Alaskan coast . The voyagers , spent two months traveling from Seattle , along the coast of Alaska , to Siberia , and back again . In many ways , the expedition was an intersection of 19th @-@ century science and 20th @-@ century science . The expedition claimed to have discovered some 600 species that were new to science , including 38 new fossil species . They charted the geographic distribution of many species . They discovered an unmapped <unk> and named several glaciers . John Muir and his friend Harriman who were members of this expedition were instrumental in governmental lobbying on National Park legislation says . The Herriman expedition was instrumental in documenting the extent of the glacier 's retreat in 1899 . 
 John Muir was seeking corroboration of the continental glaciation theories of Louis Agassiz , whose controversial Etudes sur les Glaciers was published in 1840 . The year 1893 recorded the arrival of the first tourist ship at the entrance to the Bay , at Bartlett Cove , which over the years has become central to the tourist trade in the Glacier Bay . By 1916 , the Grand Pacific Glacier was at the head of Tarr Inlet , about 65 miles ( 105 km ) from Glacier Bay 's mouth . This is the fastest documented glacial retreat ever . In 1925 , Glacier Bay was declared a national monument . 
 For centuries , the Glacier Bay has been the home land of the Huna Tlingit native tribes of Alaska . Their oral traditions indicate being displaced by the last advance of the glacier . They continue to be part of the Bay residents and it is woven into the " tapestry of their lives " . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Glacier Bay is subsumed within the larger about 3 @.@ 3 @-@ million @-@ acre ( 13 @,@ 000 km2 ) National Park and Preserve . The preserve , which is a spectacular ensemble of marine and terrestrial life , is delimited by : The Tongass National Forest borders on the east and north east ; by the international boundary with Tatshenshini @-@ Alsek Wilderness Provincial Park in British Columbia , Canada on the north ; by the waters of Cross Sound and Icy Strait border on the south ; and by the Pacific Ocean on the west . When President Calvin Coolidge declared the Glacial Bay to be a national monument , in 1925 , the objective clearly stated was : 
 The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 changed its status to a National Park and Reserve covering an area of 3 @,@ 283 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 329 @,@ 000 ha ) including 57 @,@ 000 acres ( 23 @,@ 000 ha ) as a preserve : However , 2 @,@ 670 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 080 @,@ 000 ha ) have been declared as Wilderness . The Glacier Bay also encompasses about 400 acres ( 160 ha ) of two mining claim groups , and about 3 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 200 ha ) allotted to Alaska Natives ; some small private tracts are also reported within the limits of the Glacier Bay . 
 The Glacier Bay Basin is now a myriad combination of tidewater glaciers , snow @-@ capped mountain ranges , ocean coastlines , deep fjords , and freshwater rivers and lakes that provide widely varying land and seascape and “ hosts a mosaic of plant communities and a variety of marine and terrestrial wildlife . ” 
 Glacier Bay is covered with 1 @,@ 375 square miles ( 3 @,@ 560 km2 ) of glaciers which accounts for 27 % of the Park area with most glaciers originating in mountains with elevation range of 8 @,@ 000 – 15 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 400 – 4 @,@ 600 m ) . There are over 50 named glaciers ( both tidewater and terrestrial glaciers ) ; 10 tide water glaciers - one on the east arm of the bay and all others on the west arm reach shorelines and calved ) ( literal meaning : " breaking off " ) to produce icebergs . Seven of these glaciers are reported to be active tidewater glaciers , which depict the calving phenomenon , which means that they break into icebergs and fall into the sea with thundering noise raising large waves . The McBride Glacier is the only tidewater glacier in the eastern arm at a distance of 40 nautical miles ( 74 km ) from Bartlett Cove . Of the other glaciers on the western arm , Johns Hopkins Glacier is at the farthest end – 63 nautical miles ( 117 km ) from the entrance to the bay while the Margerie Glacier is about 55 nautical miles ( 102 km ) away . 
 The National Park Service manages a total of 607 @,@ 099 acres ( 245 @,@ 684 ha ) of marine waters of the Glacier Bay . It covers a coastline of 1 @,@ 180 square miles ( 3 @,@ 100 km2 ) including some reach of the coast outside the Bay . Glacier Bay Basin as such has a coast line of 760 square miles ( 2 @,@ 000 km2 ) including all islands ; the coast line without counting islands accounts for statute 563 miles ( 906 km ) . The deepest point in the bay is 1 @,@ 410 feet ( 430 m ) below sea level with the diurnal tides occurring every 6 hours , with a tide range of − 5 to 18 feet ( − 1 @.@ 5 to 5 @.@ 5 m ) ( upper limit of the range is reported to be 23 feet ( 7 @.@ 0 m ) . 
 According to the recorded findings , most glaciers are retreating except the Johns Hopkins Glacier , which is advancing and the Margerie Glacier which is stable . The glacier thinning or retreating process is attributed to lesser incidence of snowfall on the hills , raising temperatures in the winter season followed by decrease in cloud cover and precipitation during the summer season . 
 Post Little Ice Age Rebound in the Glacier Bay Basin has been studied by researchers of the Geophysical Institute , University of Alaska Fairbanks , Alaska in association with National Park and Preserve Service , under a National Science Foundation grant using GPS geodesy combined with studies of raised shorelines and tide gauges . The studies have established that the fastest rates of glacier rebound in the world are now taking place in the Glacier Bay region . The studies have also reported that " these adjustments to LIA loading and unloading are producing significant stresses on the earth ’ s crust which can affect seismicity and regional tectonics . The rising land also is continually changing the geomorphic texture of shoreline throughout the Park and causing changes in hydrologic patterns , erosion , and sedimentation . All these changes have a direct impact on the ecosystems of the Park . " 
 Glacier Bay can be approached only by boats or ships and partly by hiking along three trails ( 10 miles ( 16 km ) ) and by kayaking along 700 miles ( 1 @,@ 100 km ) ) of shore line . The nearest road head and airport are in the small town of Gustavus , which is known as the southern gateway to the Glacier Bay . However , Gustavus as such is approachable only by air and sea . Juneau , the capital of Alaska , is about 60 miles ( 97 km ) ) . The approximate distance between Anchorage and Juneau is 567 miles ( 912 km ) } . 
 The advancing and retreating characteristics of the glaciers in the Glacier Bay are explained in simple terms as a steady state of snow getting converted into ice on the hills . Ice , as a lens of water on the base of bedrock , slides by gravity downwards . The good moraine of rock and rubble insulates it from water erosion . As a result , during freezing temperatures that exists all the year , the glacier advances . When the insulation and erosion effect of the hills gets reduced erosion sets in and along with rising temperatures the glaciers start retreating . Another unpredictable phenomenon that is observed in many glaciers in the Glacier Bay is that of calving . <unk> is a process in which blocks of ice get detached or break off from the glacier , irrespective of weather conditions , all the year round , and crash into the sea with thundering noise creating a boiling like turbulence . 
 The Glacier Bay was closed for ships almost a decade after the 1899 earthquake ( magnitude 8 @.@ 4 on the Richter Scale ) . This was on account of the shattered ice blocks which filled the Bay consequent to the earthquake . Even though the Bay is in volcanic activity region of the Pacific " Rim of Fire " , active volcanoes have not been recorded within the Glacier Bay Basin . However , these two factors have been inferred to have effects on the environmental changes occurring in the Glacier Bay . 
 = = = Archeological findings = = = 
 Archaeological findings have been unearthed at two sites in the Glacier Bay , which links the region to Holocene period . On the <unk> Island , a prehistoric finding dates occupation of the region between 3200 and 4600 BP . Another finding in the form of a house , microlithic tools and heavy wood working tools at Ground Hog Bay has been dated to about 2000 BP . This is stated to be " towards the end of the Hypsithermal ( thermal maximum climatic fluctuation ) and the beginning of the Little Ice Age " . Thus , it has been interpreted by comparison with similarly placed locations in the region , such as the southern coast of British Columbia , that the type of culture seen here is comparable to the culture that existed during historic times on the Northwest Coast . The potential for finding more such sites are stated to be high . 
 = = = Ethnographic aspects = = = 
 The Tlingits regard Glacier Bay as their sacred homeland . The National Park Service takes the view that " Glacier Bay National Park is the spiritual homeland of the Huna Tlingit , and Glacier Bay National Preserve is the homeland of the <unk> <unk> unit of the Yakutat Tlingit Tribe " . The tribes ' oral history supports that they were pushed out and migrated south when the glacier advanced . They moved back to the area when the Glacier retreated in the 1880s . There are 60 odd proto @-@ historic or historic sites in the Glacier Bay , which are identified with Tlingit Indians or European Americans . They are an integral part of Northwest Coast people inferred to be belonging to Haida , Tlingit or <unk> clans . Their settlements existed even in the 1880s in Dry Bay , Excursion Inlet , Point <unk> and the Port Frederick area ( now known as Hoonah ) and Dundas Bay . A Tlingit cemetery of the period has also been located in the park area . Seasonal hunting , gathering and fishing was their way of life , woven around a central village , with shifting fishing and hunting camps . The food source of the natives was the rich Salmon fish resources of the area . A complex society evolved with rich artistic traditions . Tlingits claimed their fishing @-@ dependent lifestyle was helped during the National Monument years , which kept out commercial fishing . After the area became a National Park , their fishing and hunting activities were curtailed except for certain religious exemptions . However , the National Park administration is closely interacting with the Tlingits to foster their cultural heritage . They are allowed access to the park to " harvest berries , a variety of seafoods , and traditional use items such as spruce roots and mountain goat hair ( for weaving traditional blankets ) " . In addition the park is planning to establish a Tlingit longhouse near its main office , where Tlingit culture would be fully highlighted and also facilitate holding of cultural events . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 The bay has a cool wet , coastal temperate rainforest climate . Three climatic zones have been discerned in the Glacier Bay ; the outer coast along the Gulf of Alaska , which records mild temperatures and higher precipitation . However , it experiences less snowfall , the upper Glacier Bay where it is much colder and heavy snowfall occurs , and the lower Glacier Bay , which experiences heavy rainfall throughout the year . 
 In the Bay as a whole , the summer temperatures vary between 50 ° F ( 10 ° C ) ) and 60 ° F ( 16 ° C ) , while the winter temperatures lie in the range of 20 to 30 ° F ( − 7 to − 1 ° C ) , with minimum going up to − 10 ° F ( − 23 ° C ) . 
 Annual precipitation is in the form of rainfall and snowfall . On an average , 228 days are recorded as precipitation days per year , and precipitation is in the range of 70 – 80 inches ( 180 – 200 cm ) including 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) of annual snowfall ; the highest recorded snowfall is of the order of 100 feet ( 30 m ) in the Fairweather Mountains . 
 = = Flora and fauna = = 
 The environment of Glacier Bay has been categorized under four main land ecosystems namely , the wet tundra , the coastal western hemlock / Sitka spruce forest , the alpine tundra , and the glaciers and ice fields ; within the Bay proper , further break up into three major marine ecosystems are marked namely , “ within in and around continental shelf , wave @-@ beaten coasts , and fjord estuaries . ” 
 Plants progressively moved in as the glacier retreated , so a 200 @-@ year @-@ old spruce and hemlock forest presently exists at the entrance , grading up to more primitive plants such as mosses and lichens at the head of the bay . Because of current local climate change some glaciers are now retreating at a rate of up to a quarter of a mile per year . 
 The retreat of the glaciers exposed land areas and as a result “ Plant communities and animal populations ranging from " pioneer species " in areas recently exposed by receding glaciers to climax communities in older coastal and alpine ecosystems ” have emerged . 
 Wild life 
 In general , wild life in Glacier Bay , has been identified under aqua fauna , avifauna and fauna ; 160 marine and estuarine fish species , 242 bird species and 41 species of mammals have been recorded . 
 Bears 
 Bears , both black and brown , are seen in Glacier Bay in the intertidal zone which they frequent for foraging . They are also seen “ scraping barnacles off of rocks and munching mussels . ” Invariably they are spotted wandering alone along the beaches of the Glacier Bay in search of salmon . The habitats of the black bears are generally the southern forested areas of the bay . However , the brown bears are mostly found in the northern , more recently glaciated zones of the Glacier Bay . Occasionally , black bears are sighted near the glaciers or near Gustavus town . Black bears with black dots and brown bears with brown dots have been seen over the last 10 years . Their travel routes have been identified as along the easy tracks such as along beaches , stream beds and river valleys . The most commonly identified locations for sighting bears in the Glacier Bay are : The Bartlett Cove , the Bartlett River , the Beardslee Islands and North and South Sandy Cove locations for black bears , while brown bears are seen to the north of Tidal Inlet in the west arm of glacier and north of Adams Inlet in the east arm . They are also seen swimming in the Bay , crossing from one bank to the other . Salmon are their favorite food , apart from bumblebees , sand fleas , bird eggs , birds , voles and marine mammal carcasses . 
 Whale 
 Humpback whales have been sighted in the lower region of Glacier Bay ; also in <unk> Narrows , Whidbey Passage and the waters around South Marble Island . For kayakers , Hugh Miller Inlet and the Beardslee Islands are good locations to see humpback whales from a safe distance of about a quarter mile . Other marine whales sighted are grey , minke , fin , and killer whales ( orcas ) . 
 Seals and porpoise 
 Harbor seals , northern fur seals , sea otters , harbor porpoises , Dall 's porpoises and Steller sea lions are also seen in Glacier Bay . 
 Other fauna 
 Land mammals sighted in Glacier Bay are : blue bears ( glacier ) , moose , Sitka black @-@ tailed deer , mountain goat , wolf , coyote , lynx , wolverine , marmots , land and river otters , weasels , ermine , mink , squirrels , beaver and red fox . <unk> , voles , shrews , hares , and bats are also found . 
 Avifauna 
 200 species of birds have been recorded in the Bay . These include : the bald eagle , golden eagle , raven , northern hawk owl , sandhill crane , loon , Steller 's jay , murre , cormorant , puffin , murrelet , oyster catchers , herons , geese , ducks , ptarmigan , crow , osprey , blue grouse , woodpecker , pigeon guillemot , sparrow , sandpiper , plover , Arctic tern , kittiwake and gulls . 
 Fish 
 Fish species found in the bay are : Chinook , chum , sockeye , pink and coho salmon , halibut , trout , steelhead , Dolly Varden , lingcod , whitefish , blackfish , char and herring . As for shellfish , there are Dungeness crabs , scallops , shrimp and clams . Salmon are very important food of bears , particularly in the late summer and fall . In the southern part of the bay , there are streams which abound in salmon . They are also seen colonizing in the northern bay , consequent to the retreat of many glaciers and the streams emerging . These salmon food sources are expected to support more bear populations in the years ahead . 
 Vegetation 
 Plant recolonization and succession has occurred in Glacier Bay as a result of the retreat of the glacier bay in the last about 300 years . The succession , which occurred in the new wilderness of Glacier Bay was stated to be a raw landscape . A simile given is that “ It was like seeing an owl with no feathers ” . A vegetative wilderness has been created , which has resulted in the coastal forest . 333 Vascular plant species of individual taxa have been recorded in the Glacier Bay . Dense thickets of Sitka alder and devil 's club abound along the shoreline .

 There are 50 odd glaciers identified in the Glacier Bay , which are both terrestrial and tidewater type . Some of the major inlets , glaciers and the mountains in the order of their location from the entry have been identified from the National Park Service Map . At the entry to the Bay there are ( as read from the map ) : The small Gustavus town and then the Visitor Center of the National Park Service and the Glacier Bay Lodge followed by several islands within the main channel . On the western side of the channel , the first inlet is the Muir Inlet which has several inlets and glaciers such as Adam ’ s Inlet , Casement Glacier , McBride Glacier , Riggs Glacier , Muir Glacier followed by the Wachusett Inlet . Coming out of the Muir inlet and entering and cruising toward the north along the main Bay , on the west shore are the <unk> Inlet , Reid Glacier and Lamplugh Glacier fed by Brady Ice field and Brady Glacier , followed by Johns Hopkins Glacier , Margerie Glacier and the Great Pacific Glacier at the head of the Bay . The east shore line has the Queen Inlet with its Carroll Glacier , and the Rendu Inlet with its Rendu Glacier . The Fairweather Range of hills which feeds the Johns Hopkins and Margerie Glaciers form the western boundary of the Glacier Bay and the highest mountains seen here are the Mt . Fairweather ( 15 @,@ 300 feet ( 4 @,@ 700 m ) ) , Mt . Quincy Adams ( 13 @,@ 650 feet ( 4 @,@ 160 m ) ) , Mt .

Abbe ( 8 @,@ 750 feet ( 2 @,@ 670 m ) ) and Mt . Cooper ( 6 @,@ 780 feet ( 2 @,@ 070 m ) ) . The major island , opposite to the Johns Hopkins Inlet , is the Russel Island in the midst of the main channel .

 The Muir Glacier was named after John Muir , the naturalist , who identified it in 1889 . The Muir Glacier was once a tide water glacier with a width of 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) , a length of 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) , and a height of 265 feet ( 80 @.@ 8 m ) . It has now turned into terrestrial glacier ; it has receded and does not flow into the sea . Its retreat has been very rapid and well @-@ documented since its Little Ice Age maximum position at the mouth of Glacier Bay around 1780 . During its retreating stage which began in 1889 , calving was intense . The flow was at the rate of about 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) per year or about 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) per day until 1979 and as a result the glacier became terrestrial by 1993 . The flow was reported to be 0 @.@ 5 feet ( 0 @.@ 15 m ) per day between 1999 and 2001 . The glacier is now only 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) in width , 150 feet ( 46 m ) in height , and extends for 13 miles ( 21 km ) . Morse Glacier is its tributary and is also retreating faster than the Muir . Further , during this process of retreat , glacial till left behind two large deltas extending to a width of about 1 @,@ 400 feet ( 430 m ) at the water edge during low tide . 
 = = = Reid Glacier = = = 
 The Reid Glacier was named by the members of the Harriman Alaska Expedition for Harry Fielding Reid ( 1859 – 1944 ) , professor of geology at Johns Hopkins University , who was well known for his studies of glacier flow and stratification in Alaska and the Alps . The glacier has its origin in Brady Icefield and has a flow rate of 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) per day . At the water edge , its width is 0 @.@ 75 miles ( 1 @.@ 21 km ) , rises to a height of 150 feet ( 46 m ) and stretches to a length of 10 miles ( 16 km ) and flows into Bigourdan Fjord . In view of fast rate of retreat , this glacier has turned from tide water to terrestrial glacier , particularly on its eastern and western one third widths . Sediment deposits from the glacier have gradually filled the eastern and western margins at its inlet , as seen during low tides . The central one third of the glacier , however , touches water edge with a recorded depth of 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) of water , during high tide . The walls of the fjord of the glacier , however , also show marks of lateral deposits of the glaciers right up to rock faces . 
 = = = Lamplugh Glacier = = = 
 The Lamplugh Glacier was named by Lawrence Martin of the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) around 1912 for the English geologist George William Lamplugh ( 1859 – 1926 ) , who visited the Glacier Bay in 1884 . The Glacier originates in the Brady Icefield to the east of Fairweather Range . The glacier has a width of about 0 @.@ 75 miles ( 1 @.@ 21 km ) at the water face . Its rises to height of 150 – 160 feet ( 46 – 49 m ) with depth of 10 – 40 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 – 12 @.@ 2 m ) at the waterline . It stretches to over 16 miles ( 26 km ) . The ice flow rate from the glacier is estimated at 900 – 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 270 – 300 m ) per year and is noted to be receding in the central and eastern part of the ice face due to calving ; the western part is , however , seen mostly grounded except during the high tide range . In the central part , a subglacial stream has developed which is seen to shift its position laterally . This phenomenon is attributed to the deposition of fluvial sediment in the embayment . It forms a delta , as observed during low tide . It also results in water turning from brown to tan milky . 
 = = = Johns Hopkins Inlet = = = 
 The Johns Hopkins Inlet is a stunning 9 @-@ mile ( 14 km ) long fjord , which has several tide water glaciers . The Lamplugh Glacier is about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) away from the inlet and further inside is the Johns Hopkins Glacier , which is now the largest tidewater glacier in Glacier Bay and adjacent to it is the Gilman Glacier followed by the Hoonah Glacier further up . All these glaciers are tidewater glaciers . Ice blocks float in the inlet and it is quite hazardous for boating or kayaking ; both activities have to be done with great caution . Johns Hopkins Inlet is closed to boats in May and June in order to protect <unk> harbor seal pups . 
 = = = Johns Hopkins Glacier = = = 
 The Johns Hopkins Glacier rises from the Fairweather Range on the east slopes of <unk> Mountain and Mount Salisbury and has a westerly flow towards the head of Johns Hopkins Inlet , 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) southwest of the terminus of Clark Glacier and 79 miles ( 127 km ) northwest of Hoonah . Its rock , ice and snow depict a variety of impressive colors such as grey , blue and white . It was named in 1893 by H.F. Reid after the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , Maryland , which sponsored an expedition to this glacier . It is the only advancing tidewater glacier now ( its advance started in 1924 when Grand Pacific Glacier started receding towards Tarr Inlet ) and is combined with Gilman Glacier ( first got attached to Hopkins in the 1990s , broke off and rejoined several times and once again it appears joined since 2000 ) ; both are advancing as one single ice block , and at the waterfront , has a width of 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) with a depth of 250 feet ( 76 m ) , rises to a height of 250 feet ( 76 m ) and stretches to about 12 miles ( 19 km ) upstream . Submarine calving has also been recorded . 
 The Johns Hopkins Glacier , for example , cannot be approached any nearer than about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) by sea because of the volume of the ice blocks that break loose from its cliffs . Most visitors to the park come by cruise ship and thus view the glaciers from the water . 
 = = = Gilman Glacier = = = 
 Gilman Glacier got attached to Johns Hopkins Glacier sometime in 1990 . In the following decade , the two glaciers merged and de @-@ merged several times . However , in 2000 it was again attached to Johns Hopkins glacier and the two together are stated to be advancing along the 150 @-@ to @-@ 200 @-@ foot ( 46 to 61 m ) steep ice face . 
 = = = Tarr Inlet = = = 
 The Tarr Inlet at the head of the Glacier Bay is a scene of ice and snow , and " sits cater @-@ corner to Johns Hopkins Inlet " . This inlet provides excellent views of the Grand Pacific Glacier to its north and the Margerie Glacier to its west . The west shore line of this inlet is steep and rocky , extends to 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) up to a small stream where a beach has been formed . A further 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) along the channel , a glacier knob is seen in the center of the west shore of the inlet . A cove formation here provides for good camping grounds , where strong winds and ice flows are experienced . This location also provides a panoramic view of the Tarr Inlet . Two miles north of this location is the Margerie Glacier . Grand Pacific Glacier is located to the east side of the Margerie Glacier at the head of the Tarr Inlet where extensive gravel outwash is seen . From Grand Pacific , the Tarr Inlet continues for 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) with steep gravel shore line interspersed with minor streams separated by gravel outwash . 
 = = = Margerie Glacier = = = 
 The Margerie Glacier is a 21 miles ( 34 km ) long tide water glacier that begins on the south slope of Mount Root , at the Alaska @-@ Canada border in the Fairweather Range ( elevation above 9 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) ) , and flows southeast and northeast to Tarr Inlet , one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north of the terminus of Grand Pacific Glacier and 87 miles ( 140 km ) northwest of Hoonah . It was named for famed French geographer and geologist Emmanuel de Margerie ( 1862 – 1953 ) , who visited Glacier Bay in 1913 . Located at the deep end of the Glacier Bay , Margerie Glacier extends over a width of about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) and extends upstream for a length of 21 miles ( 34 km ) till its source on the southern slopes of the hill of Mount Root , at the Alaska @-@ Canada border . Mount Root ( elevation 12 @,@ 860 feet ( 3 @,@ 920 m ) ) , named Boundary Peak 165 , is a mountain in Alaska and British Columbia , is part of the Fairweather Range of the Saint Elias Mountains . 
 = = = Grand Pacific Glacier = = = 
 The Grand Pacific Glacier , at the head of the Tarr Inlet on the north , has a streaked face covered with gravel and stones ( more than 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) ) thick in many areas ) . Landslides and medial moraines cover much of eastern side of the glacier extending to about two @-@ thirds width of the ice face . It is not an active glacier . In the earlier 18th century , it was a one single block of ice at the Gulf of Alaska , when Captain Vancouver first saw it , which has receded to the present location that is 65 miles ( 105 km ) ) from the Glacier Bay inlet . At the present site , Grand Pacific Glacier has a width of 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) ) with a water depth of 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) ) and with an average height of 150 feet ( 46 m ) ) and stretches to 35 miles ( 56 km ) ) . It calves into the Tarr Inlet and its western two thirds part is formed by the tributary Ferris Glacier . Its flow rate is reported to be about 1 @,@ 500 feet ( 460 m ) ) per year or about 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) ) per day . However , the eastern part of the Glacier is reportedly moving at the rate of about 15 – 180 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 – 54 @.@ 9 m ) ) per year . Margerie Glacier had merged with this glacier in 1992 . As the glacier started receding it got demerged from Margerie and only a small stream separates the two glaciers now . 
 = = = Fairweather Range = = = 
 The Fairweather Range is the unofficial name for a mountain range located in the U.S. state of Alaska and the Canadian province of British Columbia . It is the southernmost range of the Saint Elias Mountains . The northernmost section of the range is situated in Tatshenshini @-@ Alsek Provincial Park while the southernmost section resides in Glacier Bay National Park in the Hoonah @-@ <unk> Census Area . In between , it goes through the southeastern corner of Yakutat Borough . Peaks of this range include Mount Fairweather , the highest point in British Columbia and Mount Quincy Adams 4 @,@ 150 meters ( 13 @,@ 620 ft ) . 
 Between the bay and the coast , snow @-@ clad peaks of the Fairweather Range capture the moisture coming in off the Gulf of Alaska and , in turn , spawn the park ’ s largest glaciers . Mt . Fairweather is the tallest peak in the Fairweather Range and is very much unlike its name as it has a very harsh terrain . 
 Mt . Fairweather 
 The Mt . Fairweather ( officially gazetted as Fairweather Mountain in Canada but referred to as Mount Fairweather ) , is located 20 kilometers ( 12 mi ) east of the Pacific Ocean in the Glacier Bay region . While most of the mountain lies within the City and Borough of Yakutat , the summit is also in Tatshenshini @-@ Alsek Provincial Park , British Columbia ( Canada ) , making it the highest point in that province . It is also designated as Boundary Peak 164 or as US / Canada Boundary Point # 164 . The mountain was named on May 3 , 1778 by Captain James Cook , apparently for the unusually good weather encountered at the time . The name has been variously translated . It was called " Mt . <unk> " by La Perouse ( 1786 , atlas ) , " <unk> . Buen @-@ tiempo " by Galiano ( 1802 , map 3 ) , " Gor [ a ] <unk> @-@ <unk> " on Russian Hydrographic Dept . Chart 1378 in 1847 , and " G [ ora ] <unk> " by Captain <unk> ( 1852 , map 7 ) , Imperial Russian Navy . It was called " <unk> " by Constantin <unk> in 1850 and " <unk> Berg " by Justus Perthes in 1882 . Mt . Fairweather was first climbed in 1931 by Allen <unk> and Terris Moore .

 The show is meant to take place in the Southern California city of Santa Barbara ; however , most of the series is filmed in Vancouver , British Columbia , and the surrounding communities . The majority of the scenes are filmed in the suburb community of White Rock , especially those including the ocean or coastline . Speaking about filming the show , Steve Franks stated that " I swear it 's San Clemente , CA . It couldn 't look more like it " . In order to make the sets appear as Santa Barbara , the show 's crew members installed many props stereotypical to Southern California , including fake palm trees , surfboards , and the California @-@ published newspaper , the Santa Maria Sun . The production crew had to truck in eight palm trees to each set during filming . 
 Several of the show 's filming sets were changed between episodes . The Psych office was expanded and refurnished , afterwards becoming the second largest stage for the show . The house for Henry Spencer was changed , in order to be closer to the ocean . The set for Chief Vick 's office was also changed , and was repainted to brighten the scenes shot in it . Much of the episode was filmed on a sound stage , while several other scenes were filmed in the basement of the facility . Much of the installment was written to take place in Santa Barbara 's Arlington Theater . Several of the episode 's scenes were written by Franks while filming the pilot episode . 
 In order to make the show seem more realistic , Franks and other writers talked to his father , a former Los Angeles police officer , and several psychics . Much of the episode 's content was improvised by the actors , and Roday included a pineapple in the episode , continuing the reoccurring theme on the show . James Roday talked to producers about including singing in the series ' second episode , but the idea was shut down because it was too soon in the show . In addition , Steve Franks considered writing one of the show 's early episodes to be about a psychic claiming Shawn was a fraud , but delayed writing the episode until later . The producers attempted to include themes against smoking and the issues of friendship . Franks also included a character named Mrs. Foote , a reference to his 1999 movie Big Daddy .

 Since airing , the episode has received mixed to positive reviews . In his review for IGN , contributor Colin Moriarty heavily criticized the episode , calling it " unintentionally lackluster " . While Moriarty considered Hill to portray Gus well , he considered Juliet O 'Hara and Carlton Lassiter 's characters " rather forgettable " and stated that " neither character has any traits that make them interesting in the least " . He considered the show to be " admittedly in a difficult spot " . Moriarty criticized the show 's police force , calling it " possibly miscast " . He called the episode " mildly entertaining and mildly boring " and that the show is " not looking too good " . The installment was given a rating of 6 , or " okay " , tying it for the lowest rated episode of the season , with the following episode , " Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Piece " . In an article for The New York Times , journalist Bill Carter mentions that after just the two episodes , " USA Network seems to have found another drama hit with ' Psych ' " . The episode received a positive review from the online critic website Review Stream . The installment was considered to be good for several reasons . The reviewer stated that they " like how they introduce Lassiter ’ s new partner by having Shawn meet her in a coffee shop " instead of just " having her tagging along on the case and being introduced in the same boring fashion other shows rely on " when they replace a character early in the season . They also stated that the " case itself was also pretty interesting in that they were investigating sabotage at a spelling bee and potentially the murder of the spell master " . The reviewer summarized by saying that the installment " was a funny episode that I could definitely watch again " , and recommended viewing it . 
 In his review for TV Squad , writer Richard Keller gave the episode a mixed to positive review , calling the installment " pretty unique " , but that it also had its flaws . He enjoyed the fact that the episode revealed the relationship between Shawn and Henry , that it " reflects the relationship many of us have with our own fathers " . He also enjoyed the " fleshing out " of Gus 's character , that " we now see Gus as quite the brainiac " and " rather than saying nothing but ' No , Shawn ' ... Gus actually contributes quite a bit to this episode " . However , Keller also criticized parts of the episode , saying that he disliked the " whole fake psychic concept " . Keller also criticized Timothy Omundson 's character Carlton Lassiter , saying " he just doesn 't fit into the whole show " , and " Omundson 's makes Lassiter look like a cartoon character " . In a comment for TV Guide , the show was called " a diamond in the rough " , and writer Matt Roush called star James Roday " a delight " . The episode was included in Yahoo ! TV 's list of the <unk> episodes of Psych . Reviewer Tucker Cummings said that " the wordplay in this episode great " and that " it gives you a great insight into how Gus and Shawn 's friendship has functioned ( or <unk> ) over the years " . In addition , she said that the episode 's murder @-@ mystery plot " is actually really engrossing " when compared to later episodes of the show . 
 In a review of the Syfy channel series Eureka , Boston Globe critic Matthew Gilbert compared the series to Psych , describing both as having " light @-@ hearted <unk> tones " . A few days after the episode aired , Virginia Rohan of The Record called the show a " promising series " . Several critics compared the episode and show to the then @-@ new Lifetime network series Angela 's Eyes ; in his article for the Los Angeles Daily News , journalist David Kronke stated that " Lifetime 's new crime drama ' Angela 's Eyes ' is essentially the USA Network 's new series ' Psych ' inside out and played without laughs " . In an article for the Akron Beacon Journal , Angela 's Eyes main character Abigail Spencer was compared to Shawn Spencer , who was described as being " so good that people don 't believe what he can figure out " . Psych was also described as having " a much simpler premise " , but being more entertaining than Angela 's Eyes " . 
 The installment has been very positively received by the show 's cast and crew . Series creator Steve Franks was asked by iTunes in 2009 to select his twelve favorite episodes to be put on a special DVD release . The collection , titled Psych : Twelve Episodes That Will Make You Happy , contained four episodes from the first season , including " Spellingg Bee " . When describing the episode , Franks stated that " The Spellingg Bee has my one of my favorite scenes in the run of the show when Shawn takes over for the spellmaster and has to investigate a murder while making up words for the contestants to spell " . In 2013 , iTunes asked stars James Roday and Dulé Hill to select their 20 favorite episodes from the show .

Upon hearing this news , Sabre CEO Robert California ( James Spader ) approaches David in an oddly excitable tone , introducing himself as " Bob <unk> " and takes him to the conference room to negotiate . Meanwhile , when Andy is reinstated as manager , Nellie begs him by reciting Shakespeare 's quality of mercy quote from The Merchant of Venice . Out of pity , Andy gives Nellie a new job as special projects manager . Robert later tells the office that he will be leaving for the next three years and going to " help " undereducated Eastern European high school gymnasts with matching funds of one million dollars , which he convinces David to donate , disgusting the rest of the office . He then exits the office once and for all by giving Andy a kiss , possibly as a symbol of his power being regained , puts his arm around Andy and says to the office , " It 's been a great year . " 
 Meanwhile , former warehouse workers and lottery winners Calvin ( Calvin Tenner ) and Hide ( Hidetoshi <unk> ) approach Darryl Philbin ( Craig Robinson ) asking for their jobs back as they made a bad investment in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals . Darryl accepts them back and shows them around the warehouse and introduces them to new foreman Val ( Ameenah Kaplan ) . Val 's boyfriend , Brandon ( Jerry Minor ) , is also there with her and notices the blatant compliments that Darryl gives to Val . Brandon then tells Darryl off which he responds to by just simply walking away . Later , Darryl and his daughter , Jada , are taking pictures at the family portrait studio ; Val joins them and holds Darryl 's hand . 
 At the end of the episode , Robert Lipton walks out of the building with Philip and he notices Oscar Martinez ( Oscar Nunez ) . Robert asks why Oscar did not call after the fundraiser and heavily hints at his attraction to Oscar , which Oscar has repeatedly suggested to be the case . Oscar appears taken aback , but flattered and tempted .

 " Free Family Portrait Studio " was written and directed by executive producer B. J. Novak , who also portrays Ryan Howard in the series , marking the last of his 15 writing and five directing credits for the series as Novak ended his day @-@ to @-@ day involvement with the series before Season 9 to work on " The Mindy Project " . The episode marks the eleventh appearance of Catherine Tate as Nellie Bertram and her eighth consecutive appearance . She first appeared in the seventh season finale , " Search Committee " as a guest star , but starting with " Tallahassee " she was added to the cast as a recurring character . The episode hinted at the possibility of her returning in the ninth season . She was initially the top choice to replace Steve Carell , but was unable to join the series at that time due to her commitment to the West End production of Much Ado About Nothing . The episode also featured the third consecutive appearance of the character David Wallace ( Andy Buckley ) , former CFO of Dunder Mifflin , the seventh appearance of Jack Coleman as Angela 's husband , State Senator Robert Lipton , the second appearance of Sendhil Ramamurthy as Kelly 's boyfriend Ravi , having previously appeared in the episode " Angry Andy " , and the second appearance of former Saturday Night Live cast member Jerry Minor as Val 's boyfriend Brandon , having previously appeared in the episode " After Hours " . Former Office writer / producer Michael Schur appears as Dwight 's cousin Mose for the 10th time , and the first since the episode " Garden Party " earlier in the season . James Spader , who portrayed Robert California , made his final appearance for the eighth season . 
 The Season Eight DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode . Notable cut scenes include Robert complimenting Jim and Pam 's marriage and admitting his desire to share in their love , which the two take as a metaphorical compliment , Jim receiving a text from Robert asking him if Pam and he are free at 10 the following Friday which causes the two to think that California literally wants to be a part of their relationship , Pam trying to reassure Jim that Robert 's odd behavior is a figment of their imagination , and Robert calling off the get @-@ together due to this resignation as CEO of Sabre . Jim , out of curiosity , asks him what he was planning , to which he replies " a three @-@ way " .

 " Free Family Portrait Studio " received mixed reviews from critics . Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club wrote that " Free Family Portrait Studio " proved to be " a disheartening conclusion to the show ’ s worst season , offering little optimism to sustain our already dwindling enthusiasm over the summer months . " He continued to say that the season made him have little interest in " seeing anything further from Andy Bernard " . Despite this , he complimented the Dwight subplot due to its slight connection to real human emotions . He ultimately gave the episode a C + . HitFix reviewer Alan Sepinwall wrote that he hoped the new showrunner , following Paul Lieberstein , would undo the developments made in the finale , criticizing the season 's run of Andy Bernard as manager and Nellie Bertram 's character . He also wrote that he would only view the first handful of episodes , due to the new showrunner and the hope that the season would improve . Cindy White of IGN wrote that the episode " hit all the marks " as a season finale , and said she was happy that Sabre was finally gone from the series . She complimented the good writing and character moments , but criticized the possible return of Nellie and the handling of the Angela @-@ Dwight storyline over the season . She ultimately gave the episode an 8 @.@ 0 / 10 , calling it " great " . Additionally , multiple critics criticized Andy 's over @-@ dramatization while trying to make a comeback to Dunder Mifflin . 
 = North Circular Road = 
 The North Circular Road ( officially the A406 and sometimes known as simply the North Circular ) is a 25 @.@ 7 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 41 @.@ 4 km ) ring road around Central London in England . It runs from Chiswick in the west to Woolwich in the east , and connects the various suburbs in the area , including Ealing , Willesden , Wembley , Southgate , Tottenham , Woodford and Barking . Together with its counterpart , the South Circular Road , it forms a ring road through the Outer London suburbs . This ring road does not make a complete circuit of the city , being C @-@ shaped rather than a complete loop as the crossing of the River Thames in the east is made on the Woolwich Ferry . 
 The road was originally designed to connect local industrial communities together in addition to bypassing London , and was constructed in the 1920s and ' 30s . It received significant upgrades after the Second World War , and was at one point planned to be upgraded to motorway as part of the controversial and ultimately cancelled London Ringways scheme in the late 1960s . In the early 1990s , the road was extended to bypass Barking and meet the A13 north of Woolwich . 
 The road 's design varies from six lane dual carriageway to urban streets , the latter of which contribute to traffic congestion in London and are regularly featured on local traffic reports , particularly at Henlys Corner and Bounds Green in Northwest London . The uncertainty of development has caused urban decay and property blight along its route , and led to criticism over its poor pollution record . Several London Borough Councils have set up regeneration projects to improve the environment for communities surrounding the North Circular . 
 = = Route = = 
 The North Circular Road forms the northern part of a ring @-@ road around Central London . It has seen substantially more investment than its counterpart , the South Circular Road , and consequently runs on more purpose @-@ built road than urban streets , often coupled with demolition of existing houses and urban infrastructure . Although the route has alternative names at some points , it is generally referred to as the North Circular throughout for route planning purposes . The route is mostly grade @-@ separated dual carriageway from the A40 at Hanger Lane to the A13 in Beckton except for the Drury Way / <unk> Road junction , the Golders Green Road / Brent Street junction , Henlys Corner and the section from Bounds Green to Green Lanes . In areas where improvements made slowest progress and upgrades are unlikely , the original names such as Gunnersbury Avenue and Bowes Road are used . 
 = = = Gunnersbury , Hanger Lane and Brent Cross = = = 
 The road begins in Gunnersbury at the Chiswick flyover ( junction 1 of the M4 ) , from which the South Circular Road ( A205 ) heads south over Kew Bridge . The first section runs along Gunnersbury Avenue through Gunnersbury Park to Ealing Common , where it becomes Hanger Lane . The road crosses the railway west of Paddington to the Hanger Lane gyratory system , a large roundabout on top of the Western Avenue ( the A40 ) with Hanger Lane tube station . This is one of the busiest junctions in London , incorporating 10 @,@ 000 vehicles an hour . 
 The A406 runs on purpose @-@ built road to the north of Hanger Lane Gyratory , and is referred to as " North Circular Road " on street signs . The road is a six @-@ lane dual carriageway that connects the industrial estates in the area , and passes beneath the main railway line from Euston Station , near Stonebridge Park . Beyond this , there is a junction with IKEA and the Neasden temple to the southeast , and the road runs across empty land past the Welsh Harp Reservoir . Beyond the reservoir , there is a large interchange with the Edgware Road ( A5 ) and junction 1 of the M1 motorway at Staples Corner , and a junction for the Brent Cross Shopping Centre at the Brent Cross Interchange ( joining the A41 from Finchley ) . This section of the North Circular was used for filming the car chasing sequences in Withnail And I. 
 Northeast of Brent Cross , at Henlys Corner , the North Circular briefly shares carriageways with the A1 which joins it from the left and leaves it to the right to head into Central London . The junction complex also serves a local road from Hampstead and pedestrian traffic , and consequently is a major bottleneck on the route . Transport for London have invested in the junction , including a special hands free crossing for the local Jewish community , who can then cross the road on the Sabbath . The road passes north of St Pancras and Islington Cemetery towards <unk> Barnet and Muswell Hill . The road narrows to two lane single carriageway to pass under a railway bridge , and continues as Telford Road towards Bounds Green . 
 = = = Southgate , Woodford and Beckton = = = 
 Traffic on the North Circular Road must turn right from Telford Road into Bowes Road , which causes problems with heavy goods vehicles . The road continues past densely packed housing and business areas before widening at Green Lanes and assuming the North Circular Road name again . At Great Cambridge Interchange , its most northerly point , the A406 crosses Great Cambridge Road ( A10 ) . Angel Road railway station is partially located beneath the flyover at Angel Road , in an area marked for redevelopment known as Meridian Water . This leads onto the Lea Valley Viaduct that provides a safe crossing of the River Lea 's flood plain . The viaduct is part of the original construction and was one of the first of its kind to be build using reinforced concrete . 
 After the viaduct the road becomes Southend Road , passing north of Walthamstow , and immediately before the Crooked Billet junction , the former site of Walthamstow greyhound racing track . It continues eastward , cutting through a southern section of Epping Forest and meeting the Woodford New Road at Waterworks Corner , before an elevated junction with the M11 motorway and Southend Road heading to Gants Hill . The South Woodford to Barking Relief Road ( the section between the M11 and A13 ) opened in 1987 . Previously , the A406 extended along Southend Road and Woodford Avenue as far east as Gants Hill . The current route of the North Circular Road turns south , passing Eastern Avenue ( A12 ) on a flyover at the Redbridge roundabout . It passes Romford Road ( the historic Roman Road from London to Colchester ) to the west of Ilford and London Road , Barking , and ends at a roundabout with the A13 Newham Way / Alfred 's Way in Beckton . To reach the Woolwich Ferry , traffic must follow local roads to the ferry terminal . This leads across the River Thames , connecting with the eastern end of the South Circular Road on the other side of the river . The junction with the A13 has been built to enable the North Circular to be continued across the junction to the Thames Gateway Bridge if and when it is built . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 Proposals for a route avoiding Central London had been in place since the early 20th century due to increasing levels of traffic . In 1910 , the London Traffic Division of the Board of Trade had built up schemes for new roads , including what became the North Circular Road , which was designed to skirt the extent of urban development along suburbs . 
 The North Circular Road was originally designed as an unemployment relief scheme following the First World War . Various manufacturing industries , including furniture production , had moved away from the East End in the early 20th century and started to be based in communities along the fringes of outer London development . As well as a general bypass of Central London , it would connect the communities of Edmonton , Tottenham and Walthamstow together and allow former munition factories to be reused for industrial purposes . Further west , industrial work increased around Wembley to cater for the 1924 British Empire Exhibition , while former military factories at Willesden , Hendon and Acton would also benefit from being connected by the North Circular Road . The overall route ran on cheap land that further works and factories could be built next to . Purpose @-@ built sections were designed to dual carriageway standards , including a 27 @-@ foot ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) wide carriageway accompanied by 9 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) verges . 
 The original route ran from Chiswick to Southgate , and was open to traffic by the 1930s . Although it mostly ran on new @-@ build road , a section east of Southgate ran on existing streets . By the end of the decade , the area surrounding the Park Royal estate had become the largest industrial estate in the south of England , and the London Passenger Transport Board were receiving regular complaints about the excess traffic levels . 
 Due to laxer laws about building housing on major roads , as London suburbs developed , properties were allowed to be built on the North Circular Road . The original purpose @-@ built road had been designed with no speed limit , as was typically the case in the 1920s , but by 1951 a 30 mph speed limit was enforced along the route . 
 In 1946 , the North Circular Road became a trunk road , funded from a national budget set by the Ministry of Transport ( MOT ) rather than a local one . 
 = = = London Ringways = = = 
 After reviewing traffic conditions in 1961 , the Ministry of Transport planned to improve the North Circular Road to a higher capacity , grade separating as many junctions as possible , particularly those at important arterial routes . In the 1960s the Greater London Council developed the London Ringways Plan to construct a series of circular and radial motorways throughout London to ease traffic congestion in the central area . Under this plan the North Circular Road was to be improved to dual @-@ carriageway standard throughout the majority of its length by the late 1970s . 
 The Ringway projects were extremely unpopular and drew wide @-@ scale protests , which led to the cancellation of plans in 1972 , particularly after the Westway had opened in the face of wide scale protest two years earlier . In 1974 , the MOT scaled back plans to improve the North Circular Road , though by the end of the decade they had revised plans to improve the route to dual carriageway throughout without any property frontages . In 1979 , the Ministry of Transport planned to improve the Great Cambridge Road Roundabout with a £ 17 million scheme that would have demolished over 100 houses and shops . This was cancelled and replaced with a straightforward underpass in 1983 , costing £ 22 @.@ 3 million . 
 = = = South Woodford to Barking Relief Road = = = 
 The section of the North Circular south of Charlie Browns in South Woodford is the " South Woodford to Barking Relief Road " . Prior to its opening , the signposted North Circular route from Waterworks to the Woolwich Ferry was on local roads via <unk> Cross , Wanstead , Manor Park and Beckton . As well as delays for the ferry , traffic could also be held due to bridges with the Royal Albert and King George V Docks . The road was originally planned to be a continuation of the M11 , but the standard of road was dropped in design to a basic dual carriageway . It was proposed to be built in the 1980s concurrently with the controversial M11 link road . 
 = = = Henlys Corner and Bounds Green improvements = = = 
 The North Circular Road ceased to be a trunk road in 2000 , when control of all roads inside Greater London passed to Transport for London ( TfL ) . In 2004 , Mayor of London Ken Livingstone promised limited improvements to the road , but received criticism for not approving earlier plans for widening the often heavily congested road at critical sections . In 2009 , it was announced that major works between the Bounds Green Road and Green Lanes junctions would finally go ahead , having been proposed for over 90 years , and was completed the following year . The work improved the carriageway between these junctions , widening Telford Road to two lanes and improving all of the junctions along the route . Improvements were also made to walkways and cycle paths along this route . However , unlike elsewhere on the North Circular , the new junctions are not grade @-@ separated and have been designed with environmental concerns in mind . The opened scheme is a reduced specification from 1960s plans , which projected this section of the North Circular to be dual carriageway . 
 In April 2011 , after many years of proposals and delays , construction began on a major upgrade of the Henlys Corner interchange . An underpass was originally proposed but this was heavily criticised by local residents , and would have been very costly , and was subsequently scrapped . The upgrade scheme improved on the current junction by adding extra lanes and allowing easier left and right turns , speeding up queue times . Cycle paths and safer pedestrian crossings were included . 
 In July 2013 , a task force set up by the Mayor of London Boris Johnson proposed that long sections of the North Circular ( as well as the South Circular ) should be put underground in road tunnels , freeing up space on the surface to provide public space , extensive cycle routes , and better links to existing communities currently severed by the road . 
 = = Environment and safety = = 
 The North Circular Road has received regular criticism over its poor safety record and piecemeal improvement schemes due to a lack of funding since it opened to traffic . In 1989 , Michael Portillo , then a Member of Parliament for Enfield Southgate , complained that 367 houses were scheduled for demolition as part of improvements to the North Circular in his constituency . Friends of the Earth have complained about rising costs and delays to junction and safety improvements . In 2003 , environment cabinet member Terry Neville said that TfL 's proposed improvements for improving the North Circular were " a sham " and that the local council wanted a six @-@ lane motorway to properly solve congestion . 
 The uncertainty over the future of the North Circular Road has blighted properties on and near it , particularly around Bounds Green . Around 1972 , approximately 400 homes on the road were compulsory purchased by the Greater London Council in conjunction with widening schemes that were then cancelled . The properties have suffered from a lack of long @-@ term care . Since TfL took responsibility for the road , land for future schemes has been left dormant , resulting in urban decay with derelict properties . Compulsory purchased properties were let out to various short @-@ term tenants , which led to them housing prostitutes and migrant workers living in increasing squalor . Pedestrians have become too frightened to use underpasses along the road , particularly to access North Middlesex Hospital . Areas close to the road , such as the alleys behind properties on the Telford Road section , have suffered from fly tipping and anti @-@ social behaviour . 
 In 2011 , Enfield Borough Council proposed a North Circular Area Action Plan , which would regenerate the area immediately around Telford Road and Bowes Road , and encourage growth . This includes new pedestrian crossings and improved access to existing open spaces , including Arnos Park and Broomfield Park . 
 In 2002 , the North Circular was rated as Britain 's noisiest road by the UK Noise Association . In 2013 , the road was named in a BBC report as being the most polluted in London , including the highest surveyed levels of benzene and nitrogen dioxide . A report in the Sunday Times , referring to the North Circular , said " if you want to pull back the lid of your convertible and drink in the fresh air , look elsewhere " .

 The North Circular Road is mentioned in the poet Louis MacNeice 's 1938 piece , Autumn Journey .

Keith Moon played his first gig with the Who at a pub on the North Circular Road on 2 May 1964 . 
 The original Ace Cafe was based on the North Circular Road . Open 24 hours a day , it catered for late @-@ night party @-@ goers and boy racers .

 = Interstate 475 ( Michigan ) = 
 Interstate 475 ( I @-@ 475 ) is an Interstate Highway in the US state of Michigan . I @-@ 475 is a 16 @.@ 99 @-@ mile ( 27 @.@ 34 km ) bypass route that serves the downtown area of Flint while its parent , I @-@ 75 , passes through the west side of the city . I @-@ 475 starts southwest of Grand Blanc and runs through suburbs of Flint before passing through downtown . There it intersects I @-@ 69 and crosses the Flint River . The freeway turns westerly to connect back to I @-@ 75 north of Flint near Mount Morris . 
 This component freeway of the state trunkline highway system was planned in the 1950s and built in the 1970s . The trunkline was first named the Buick Freeway to honor David Dunbar Buick 's contributions to Flint 's early automotive industry as founder of Buick Motor Company . I @-@ 475 was renamed in 1981 the UAW Freeway , honoring the United Auto Workers , a labor union which was active in Flint . At the same time , the name of I @-@ 69 in Flint was changed from the " Chevrolet Freeway " to the " Chevrolet @-@ Buick Freeway " . Since 2001 , I @-@ 475 has borne both the UAW and Buick names officially . 
 = = Route description = = 
 I @-@ 475 starts at a partial interchange with I @-@ 75 in Grand Blanc Township , southwest of Grand Blanc . From this start at exit 111 , the freeway proceeds northward through a suburban residential area next to a baseball field complex . As I @-@ 475 continues northward , it has an interchange with Hill Road near the Crestwood Memorial Gardens cemetery and several commercial properties . North of the Maple Road underpass , the freeway crosses into the suburb of Burton where it runs for about 1 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) before crossing into the city of Flint . The freeway then curves around to the northeast near Thread Lake , crossing over Saginaw Street . I @-@ 475 follows the western shore of the lake as it turns northward to run into downtown Flint . 
 South of the four @-@ level stack interchange with I @-@ 69 , I @-@ 475 crosses over a line of the Canadian National Railway . North of this interchange , the freeway runs more northwesterly as it skirts the eastern edge of downtown Flint . Near the campus of the University of Michigan @-@ Flint , I @-@ 475 curves to run parallel to the Flint River before crossing it next to an industrial area . There is an interchange complex on the northwest side of the river that provides access to Stewart Avenue and M @-@ 54 ( Dort Highway ) . I @-@ 475 then runs north and northwesterly parallel to a rail line operated by CSX Transportation . North of Carpenter Road , the freeway exits the city of Flint and enters Genesee Township . The Interstate turns to the east to cross into Mount Morris Township before meeting an interchange for Saginaw Street . There is one more interchange for Clio Road before I @-@ 475 terminates at a full interchange with I @-@ 75 's exit 125 . 
 I @-@ 475 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) like other state highways in Michigan . As a part of these maintenance responsibilities , the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction . These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic , which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway . MDOT 's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along I @-@ 475 were the 57 @,@ 400 vehicles daily north of the I @-@ 69 interchange in Flint ; the lowest counts were the 18 @,@ 637 vehicles per day west of the Clio Road interchange . As an Interstate Highway , I @-@ 475 has been listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility .

 A freeway along the I @-@ 475 corridor was proposed in the 1950s . The 1955 Yellow Book , an early proposal for what would become the Interstate Highway System , contained an inset of the proposed freeways in and around the Flint area , including a loop route freeway near the downtown area . Designated as part of the Interstate Highway System in 1957 , I @-@ 475 construction was funded by the federal government . 
 I @-@ 475 was first opened to traffic in the early 1970s . The first section was built between I @-@ 75 / US 10 northward to M @-@ 21 / M @-@ 78 . The second section was built from I @-@ 75 / US 10 / US 23 to BUS M @-@ 54 along the north side of town . These two sections were opened on November 9 , 1973 and September 26 , 1974 respectively . The final section was opened between them in 1981 .

 I @-@ 475 has carried two different memorial highway designations in its history , the Buick Freeway and the UAW Freeway . 
 David Dunbar Buick was a Scottish @-@ born immigrant who moved to Detroit with his parents at the age of two in 1856 – 57 . He quit school to supplement the family 's income after his father 's 1860 death . In the 1880s , he was a plumbing supplier in the Detroit area , inventing a process that created a cheaper white bathtub . Buick produced a method for permanently coating cast iron with vitreous enamel which allowed the production of " white " baths at lower cost . He later sold his plumbing business and the patents to American Standard . Using the profits from this sale , Buick started working on gasoline engines , and later automobiles . He eventually moved his operations from Detroit to the Flint Wagon Works . William Durant managed the fledgling Buick Manufacturing Company , making it the number one car @-@ building company in the country by 1908 . Durant later built on the foundation of Buick 's company to create General Motors . In honor of Buick 's contributions to Flint 's manufacturing base , the Flint City Commission proposed naming I @-@ 475 after Buick . The freeway passed by the city 's Buick plant and many of the employees would use the new freeway on their commutes to work . The Michigan Legislature passed Concurrent Resolution 22 in 1969 to add the name . 
 The United Auto Workers ( UAW ) was founded in Detroit on August 26 , 1935 . The labor union struggled to gain members until the Flint Sit @-@ Down Strike in 1937 . The strike started on December 30 , 1936 , when workers at the Fisher Body Plant No. 1 stopped loading tool dies on the night shift , locking themselves into the plant . The dies were destined for shipment to plants where union activity was much weaker than the UAW @-@ organized plants in Flint . On January 3 , 1937 , workers at the plant sat down on the job ; Fisher Plant No. 2 later joined in the sit @-@ down strike . The heat was shut off at the plants , and on January 11 , food deliveries were stopped , sparking a riot . Governor Frank Murphy mobilized 4 @,@ 000 National Guard troops to keep peace at the plants . A second riot occurred at Chevrolet Plant No. 4 on February 1 . The National Guard troops surrounded the 12 striking plants in Flint , but the governor never ordered them into action . President Franklin D. Roosevelt encouraged the two parties to sit down once more , and an agreement was signed , recognizing the UAW in the 17 striking plants across the country . 
 A local politician wanted to honor not just the automotive pioneers in Flint , but the workers that worked in the plants . Since the UAW came to maturity in Flint as a result of the strikes , it was the appropriate location for a memorial highway designation . In 1980 , the Michigan Legislature passed House Concurrent Resolution 583 , renaming Flint 's east – west freeway ( I @-@ 69 ) the " Chevrolet – Buick Freeway " and I @-@ 475 the " UAW Freeway " . I @-@ 475 was dedicated with its new name on Labor Day , 1981 . 
 Public Act 142 of 2001 consolidated the memorial highway designations of the state . In passing this act , the Michigan Legislature expanded the Chevrolet – Buick Freeway to encompass all of I @-@ 69 in Genesee County . The act also restored Buick 's name to I @-@ 475 .

 The Genesee County Board of Commissioners has proposed to MDOT that I @-@ 475 should be connected to US 23 in the southern part of Genesee County . The board approved a study to investigate the economic impact of such an extension . The study will also examine how such an extension will impact an existing intermodal transportation hub at Bishop International Airport and a rail terminal being built at the former Buick City complex . Proposals for the freeway connection have been around since the late 1990s , but was indefinitely postponed in 2011 .

 = M @-@ 56 ( 1919 – 1957 Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 56 was a state trunkline highway in the southeastern part of the US state of Michigan . It existed from 1919 until 1957 . The highway ran north from Monroe , where it connected with US Highway 24 ( US 24 , Telegraph Road ) , to Flat Rock where it terminated at an intersection with US 24 / US 25 . Before a series of truncations in the 1950s , the highway continued along the Huron River to New Boston and Belleville . The trunkline was progressively scaled back to Flat Rock before being decommissioned in 1957 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 When it was decommissioned in 1957 , M @-@ 56 started at an intersection with US 24 ( Telegraph Road ) on the west side of Monroe . From there , the trunkline ran southeasterly along Elm Avenue to an intersection with US 25 ( Dixie Highway , now M @-@ 125 ) in downtown . M @-@ 56 also intersected US 24A ( now Interstate 75 ) just outside town . The highway continued northeasterly past Sterling State Park and along Brest Bay in the communities of Detroit Beach and Woodland Beach . Turning inland near Stony Point , the trunkline followed Dixie Highway across the Swan Creek . North of the creek , Dixie Highway met US Turnpike , and M @-@ 56 followed Dixie Highway northward into South Rockwood . In that village , the trunkline turned northeasterly parallel to US 24 to cross the Huron River . On the north side of the river , M @-@ 56 followed the southernmost end of Fort Street to Huron River Drive , turning northwesterly along the latter road . The highway ran through an intersection with US 24A and parallel to the river into Flat Rock , where it terminated at the intersection with US 24 / US 25 ( Telegraph Road , now just US 24 ) .

 When the state highway system was first signposted in 1919 , M @-@ 56 was assigned to roadways that ran northeasterly from the Ohio state line to the Belleville area . When the United States Numbered Highway System was created on November 11 , 1926 , the southern section between the state line and Monroe was redesignated as a section of US 25 . In the 1940s , the northern end was rerouted north from New Boston to follow M @-@ 112 along the Willow Run Expressway ( now I @-@ 94 and part of the Detroit Industrial Freeway ) into Belleville north to US 112 . In late 1954 or early 1955 , the northern end was changed again , this time truncating the highway to end at New Boston . The northern end was shortened again to terminate at US 24 / US 25 in Flat Rock in 1956 . The remainder of the highway from Monroe to Flat Rock was removed and decommissioned from the state highway system the next year , becoming county roads under the jurisdiction of Monroe and Wayne counties .

 Okay Hot @-@ Shot , Okay ! ( sometimes Okay Hot @-@ Shot ) is a 1963 pop art painting by Roy Lichtenstein that uses his Ben @-@ Day dots style and a text balloon . It is one of several examples of military art that Lichtenstein created between 1962 and 1964 , including several with aeronautical themes like this one . It was inspired by panels from four different comic books that provide the sources for the plane , the pilot , the text balloon and the graphic onomatopoeia , " <unk> ! " . 
 Lichtenstein made several alterations to the source images as he compiled them into this composition . He used themes in this work that relate to those expressed in several of his other works . The narrative content is also said to relate to themes from other works , but instead of Lichtenstein 's own works it relates to Jackson Pollock 's contemporaneous works . 
 = = Background = = 
 During the late 1950s and early 1960s a number of American painters began to adapt the imagery and motifs of comic strips . Lichtenstein made drawings of comic strip characters in 1958 . Andy Warhol produced his earliest paintings using this style in 1960 . Lichtenstein , unaware of Warhol 's work , produced Look Mickey and Popeye in 1961 . Soon , Lichtenstein advanced from animated cartoons to more serious themes such as romance and combat depictions . Lichtenstein said that at the time , " I was very excited about , and very interested in , the highly emotional content yet detached impersonal handling of love , hate , war , etc . , in these cartoon images . " The work was inspired by five different comic book panels made by Russ Heath and Irv Novick . The plane , the pilot , the text balloon and the graphic onomatopoeia , " <unk> ! " , all come from panels from different comic books . 
 Lichtenstein was a trained draftsman and artist . He also received training during World War II as an army pilot , but never saw active combat . His list of <unk> themed works is extensive , including several others featuring pilots situated in cockpits during air combat such as Jet Pilot ( 1962 ) , Brattata ( 1962 ) , and Bratatat ! ( 1963 ) . Some sources list Okay Hot @-@ Shot , Okay ! along with Whaam ! and Blam as Lichtenstein 's best @-@ known examples of military art . 
 Okay Hot @-@ Shot , Okay ! is one of several comics @-@ based works , including Jet Pilot and Von Karp , inspired by the World War II U.S. fighter pilot Johnny Cloud of DC Comics ' The Losers . The January – February 1962 DC Comics ' All @-@ American Men of War issue # 89 was the inspiration for several Lichtenstein paintings , providing two of the source panels of Okay Hot @-@ Shot , Okay ! as well as sources for Brattata , Blam , Whaam ! and Tex ! The graphite pencil sketch , Jet Pilot was also from that issue . 
 = = Critical appraisal = = 
 In the source , the pilot wore traditional World War II headgear , but Lichtenstein altered the headgear to that of a cosmonaut , astronaut or modern air force pilot of the Cold War era . Lichtenstein also shifted the subject so that his left iris is in the frame . The work also is related to Lichtenstein 's theme of " machine and embodied vision " as exhibited in works such as Crak ! , Bratatat ! , and Jet Pilot . 
 The narrative content , " Okay , hot @-@ shot , okay ! I 'm pouring ! [ ammunition into the enemy ] " is said to have a dual meaning that alludes to the style of poured painting being made famous at the time by Pollock . Melodrama through heightened tension ties this with some of Lichtenstein 's most notable works . 
 While melding the elements and motifs of panels from two artists , Lichtenstein simplified the hatching and use of color . In Lichtenstein 's obituary , Los Angeles Times critic Christopher Knight said the use of color in this work harkened back to works by Morris Louis and the explosion 's graphic elements recalled Kenneth Noland 's target work . 
 In an account published in 1998 after Lichtenstein was famous , Irv Novick said that he met Lichtenstein in the army in 1947 and , as his superior officer , had responded to Lichtenstein 's tearful complaints about the menial tasks he was assigned by recommending him for a better job . Jean @-@ Paul <unk> has questioned this account , saying that Lichtenstein had left the army a year before the time Novick says the incident took place . Bart Beaty , noting that Lichtenstein had appropriated Novick for works such as Whaam ! and Okay Hot @-@ Shot , Okay ! , says that Novick 's story " seems to be an attempt to personally diminish " the more famous artist . 
 = 1927 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1927 Atlantic hurricane season featured no hurricane landfalls in the United States , in contrast to the four hurricanes that struck the United States in the previous season . Overall , the season was relatively inactive , with eight tropical storms , four of which became hurricanes . One of these became a major hurricane , which is Category 3 or higher on the modern day Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . The first system , a tropical depression , developed on August 13 , while the final cyclone , a tropical storm , merged with a cold front on November 21 . The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane One , nicknamed the Nova Scotia hurricane . The sole major hurricane , this storm resulted in between 173 and 192 deaths in Atlantic Canada , mostly from capsized and missing ships offshore . On land , the storm left about $ 1 @.@ 7 million ( 1927 USD ) in damage , with much of the damage occurring in Nova Scotia . Additionally , the fourth , fifth , and sixth tropical storms brought minor impact to Bermuda , South Carolina , and Cuba , respectively . 
 The season 's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 56 . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) , which is tropical storm strength .

 = = = Hurricane One = = = 
 A tropical storm developed from a tropical wave over the deep tropics of the Atlantic Ocean on August 18 . Moving west @-@ northwestward , it intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on the modern day Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale by August 19 . The storm deepened significantly over the next few days , and by August 22 , it peaked as a Category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) and a minimum pressure of 950 mbar ( 28 inHg ) . The latter was observed by the S.S. Maraval , while the former was estimated using the pressure @-@ wind relationship . Around that time , the system began curving northwestward and later northward . By August 23 , it turned to the north @-@ northeast and then began weakening on August 24 . Thereafter , the storm accelerated toward Atlantic Canada . Late on August 24 , the hurricane struck near Yarmouth , Nova Scotia , as a Category 2 hurricane , just before becoming extratropical . The remnants continued northeastward , striking Newfoundland and later Iceland , before dissipating near Jan Mayen on August 29 . 
 In New England , the storm brought heavy rainfall , peaking at 2 @.@ 09 inches ( 53 mm ) in Portland , Maine . Minor street flooding was reported in Maine , Massachusetts , and Rhode Island , with flooding in the Providence area damaging pavement and overflowing sewers . Along the coast of Massachusetts , rough seas disrupted shipping in Boston and beached a ship at Cape Cod . Of the 173 @-@ 192 fatalities in Canada , most of them occurred due to damaged or missing ships , with two boats losing their entire crew . On land , heavy rainfall in Nova Scotia washed out 20 – 25 percent of the rail lines , which disrupted rail service . Flooding also damaged numerous roads and swept away bridges . Crop damage from the hurricane was severe as the storm destroyed about half of the fruit , vegetable , and hay harvest , leaving a loss of $ 1 million ( 1927 CAD ) . Property damage in the province was in the thousands of dollars range and there were many electrical and telephone service outages . Similar but less severe impact occurred in New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island . The storm also left minor wind damage in Newfoundland . Overall , the hurricane caused just under $ 1 @.@ 6 million ( 1927 CAD ) in damage .

 A tropical wave developed into the second tropical depression of the season on September 2 , while located about 190 mi ( 310 km ) east of the Cape Verde Islands . Six hours after forming , the depression intensified into a tropical storm . Moving west @-@ southwestward , the storm passed through the Cape Verde Islands on September 3 , striking Boa Vista with winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) . The island of Santiago observed winds of 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) at 12 : 00 UTC . Thereafter , the system headed west @-@ northwestward into the open Atlantic and slowly intensified . Early on September 8 , the storm strengthened into a Category 1 while beginning a northwestward motion . Around that time , a radiogram from the British S.S. Socrates indicated that the ship recorded a barometric pressure of 1 @,@ 007 mbar ( 29 @.@ 7 inHg ) , the lowest observed in association with the storm . 
 By September 9 , the hurricane peaked with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) and began curving north @-@ northwestward , which was soon followed by a turn to the north @-@ northeast later that day . Thereafter , the storm started to lose tropical characteristics , with historical weather maps indicating a low pressure area imbedded within a cold front by September 10 . Around 12 : 00 UTC , the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm . Late on September 11 , the storm weakened to a tropical depression and was last noted at 18 : 00 UTC , while located about 870 mi ( 1 @,@ 400 km ) east @-@ northeast of Bermuda .

 A low pressure area developed into a tropical depression around 12 : 00 UTC on September 22 while located about 820 mi ( 1 @,@ 320 km ) southwest of the southwestern @-@ most islands of Cape Verde . Moving northwestward , the depression strengthened into a tropical storm by early on September 23 . Thereafter , the storm proceeded to intensify very slowly during the next several days . On September 26 , the cyclone began moving generally northward . Based on a ship report , the storm finally reached hurricane status by 12 : 00 UTC on September 28 . A different ship observation indicated a minimum barometric pressure of 1 @,@ 005 mbar ( 29 @.@ 7 inHg ) . Based on the pressure @-@ wind relationship , it is estimated that the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) .

 A low pressure area developed into a tropical storm about 835 mi ( 1 @,@ 345 km ) east @-@ northeast of Barbuda early on September 23 . The system moved northwest , and by 12 : 00 UTC on September 24 , it strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane . Late on September 25 , the cyclone intensified into a Category 2 hurricane . A ship recorded a pressure of 971 mbar ( 28 @.@ 7 inHg ) on September 26 . Because this was measured within the storm 's radius of maximum sustained winds , the hurricane 's minimum barometric pressure was estimated to have been 967 mbar ( 28 @.@ 6 inHg ) . Based on the pressure @-@ wind relationship , the system peaked with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) . Thereafter , it curved northeastward on September 27 , shortly before weakening to a Category 1 hurricane . Early on September 28 , the hurricane became extratropical about 360 mi ( 580 km ) south @-@ southeast of Sable Island . However , the extratropical storm existed until October 1 , when it dissipated well north of the Azores . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Five = = = 
 At approximately 12 : 00 UTC on September 30 , a low pressure area developed into a tropical depression while situated about 175 mi ( 280 km ) northeast of Turks and Caicos Islands . The depression moved parallel to the islands of the Bahamas and slowly strengthened , reaching tropical storm status early on October 2 . Continuing its northwestward motion , the storm strengthened further and peaked early on October 3 with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1 @,@ 008 mbar ( 29 @.@ 8 inHg ) , the latter of which was a ship observation . Around 09 : 00 UTC , the cyclone made landfall near Beaufort , South Carolina , at the same intensity . The storm curved northward after moving inland and weakened to a tropical depression early on October 4 . Several hours later , the system dissipated over West Virginia . 
 In South Carolina , rainfall was generally beneficial due to ongoing drought conditions . In Beaufort , many tree branches were felled in several neighborhoods of the city . Many were left without power for several hours on morning of October 3 , crippling industries that depended on electricity , including delaying publication of the The Beaufort Gazette because the linotype machine could not be used . Very minor damage occurred to corn in the city . Elsewhere in the state , particularly in Charleston , there were widespread telephone , telegraph , and power outages due to downed lines and poles , severing communications . In North Carolina , similar damage occurred to the methods of communications in Raleigh , Selma , Siler City , and other areas closer to the Virginia state line due to wires knocked over by strong winds .

 The season 's next cyclone developed from over the northwestern Caribbean Sea from a broad low pressure area near the Bay Islands Department of Honduras on October 16 . Moving east @-@ northeastward , the system strengthened into a tropical storm several hours later . Early on October 17 , the system peaked with winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) , based on a ship observation of a minimum barometric pressure of 999 mbar ( 29 @.@ 5 inHg ) . Curving northeastward , it made landfall near Santa Cruz del Sur , Camagüey Province , late on October 18 at the same intensity . After crossing Cuba , the storm accelerated and moved through the Bahamas early the following day , striking the island of Acklins . By 06 : 00 UTC , the system was absorbed by a cold front while located about 105 mi ( 170 km ) north @-@ northeast of Mayaguana . 
 The Government of Cuba issued warnings in anticipation of the storm in the central provinces of the island , particularly over concerns of heavy rainfall . Additionally , radio messages were sent to ship to warning of the approaching cyclone . Heavy rains caused some crop damage but little else of consequence .

 A weak low pressure area developed into the seventh storm of the season formed near the Cayman Islands on October 30 . Initially a tropical depression , it tracked slowly north @-@ northeastward and reached tropical storm status about six hours after forming . Early on October 31 , the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) , several hours before making landfall in Sancti Spíritus Province several hours later . After emerging over the Bahamas , the storm slowly weakened . Late on November 1 , the system struck Andros Island with winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . Thereafter , the cyclone accelerated and continued weakening , falling to tropical depression intensity late on November 3 . Shortly thereafter , it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while located about 215 mi ( 345 km ) south of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina . 
 The remnants contributed to the development of the system which brought devastating floods to the Northeastern United States . Following well above average precipitation in October , this system brought as much as 15 in ( 380 mm ) to Vermont . The flooding left at least $ 50 million ( 1927 USD ) in damage and 85 deaths , with all but one death occurring in Vermont .

On November 21 , the storm weakened and lost tropical characteristics , merging with a cold front about 585 mi ( 940 km ) east @-@ northeast of Bermuda at 12 : 00 UTC . The extratropical cyclone persisted for only about six more hours . This storm may have been subtropical , but in the absence of satellite imagery , it is considered a tropical cyclone . 
 = Calshot Castle = 
 Calshot Castle is an artillery fort constructed by Henry VIII on the Calshot Spit , Hampshire , England , between 1539 and 1540 . It formed part of the King 's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire and defend Southampton Water as it met the Solent . The castle had a keep at its centre , surrounded by a curtain wall and a moat . Initially heavily armed , it had a garrison of 16 men and as many as 36 artillery guns . The castle continued in use for many years , surviving the English Civil War intact and being extensively modernised in the 1770s . During the 19th century , Calshot Castle was used by the coastguard as a base for combating smuggling . In 1894 , however , fresh fears of a French invasion led to it being brought back into use as an artillery fort : a large coastal battery was constructed alongside the older castle and a boom built across Southampton Water , controlled from the castle . 
 During the First World War , Calshot Castle was primarily used as a base for seaplanes , deployed on anti @-@ submarine patrols in the English Channel ; its guns were removed before the end of the war , probably for use in France . The air base , by then called RAF Calshot , grew in size during the inter @-@ war years , hosting the Schneider Trophy air races . With the outbreak of the Second World War , Calshot was re @-@ armed in the face of a possible German invasion . The station continued in use after the war , but as military seaplanes became obsolete , it was finally closed in 1961 . After a short period of use by the coastguard , the castle was opened to the public by English Heritage in the 1980s . Restored to its pre @-@ 1914 appearance , the castle received 5 @,@ 751 visitors in 2010 . Historic England considers Calshot a " well @-@ preserved example " of King Henry 's Device Forts .

 Calshot Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England , France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII . Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to local lords and communities , only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications , and while France and the Empire remained in conflict , maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely . Modest defences based around simple blockhouses and towers existed in the south @-@ west and along the Sussex coast , with a few more impressive works in the north of England , but in general the fortifications were limited in scale . 
 In 1533 , Henry broke with Pope Paul III over the annulment of his long @-@ standing marriage to Catherine of Aragon . Catherine was the aunt of Charles V , the Holy Roman Emperor , who took the annulment as a personal insult . This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538 , and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England . An invasion of England appeared certain . In response , Henry issued an order , called a " device " , in 1539 , giving instructions for the " defence of the realm in time of invasion " and the construction of forts along the English coastline . 
 Calshot Castle was designed to protect the Solent , a body of water that led from the English Channel to the naval base at Portsmouth and , through Southampton Water , to the important port of Southampton . The castle was one of four forts that William Fitzwilliam , the Lord Admiral , and William Paulet decided to build to improve the defences along the Solent ; the others were at East and West Cowes , and Hurst . Calshot was constructed on the narrow Calshot Spit , overlooking the deep @-@ water channel running through into Southampton . Temporary earthwork defences and gun batteries were erected as an interim measure , but the castle itself was built quickly and finished by the end of 1540 . It probably reused stone and lead from <unk> and Netley abbeys , which had recently been closed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries . 
 The castle initially had a garrison of eight gunners , five soldiers and a lieutenant , under the command of a captain . In the late 1540s , it was heavily armed by the standards of the time , with 36 pieces of artillery . In the 1580s , the castle caught fire and the timber needed for the repairs required 127 trees to be sent from the New Forest . The work was carried out in 1584 , prompted by the threat of a Spanish invasion , but by that time its garrison had shrunk to eight men . 
 = = = 17th – 19th centuries = = = 
 In the early 1600s , England was at peace with France and Spain and coastal defences received little attention . During the English Civil War of the 1640s , Calshot was held by Parliamentary forces against King Charles I , and protected with a 15 @-@ strong garrison at an annual cost of £ 107 . Parliament considered the fortress important and kept it supplied with ammunition ; unlike several other local forts , Parliament kept the castle operational , probably because of its ongoing role in defending Southampton Water . During the early 18th @-@ century War of Spanish Succession it was equipped with up to 25 guns . 
 The castle was modernised in the 1770s with a new parapet around the central keep , alterations to the gun embrasures around the outer wall and an expansion of the gatehouse with an additional set of rooms for the castle 's captain . Reports in 1793 , however , showed the castle 's guns to be in a poor condition and complained that the fortification was under the command of an infirm , elderly master @-@ gunner . Improvements were probably made at the start of the Revolutionary Wars that year , but in 1809 the geographer James Playfair described the castle as merely " a blockhouse with a garrison " . In 1804 , the castle was used to store munitions for the Sea Fencibles , fishing boats used as volunteer naval vessels to counter the threat of a French invasion . Seven guns were added to the castle 's arsenal to protect against French attack . 
 With the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 , the government coastguard took control of the castle , using it as a base to combat smuggling , taking advantage of the water behind the Calshot Spit as a good location to position their waiting interception vessels . By the middle of the century , two officers and forty @-@ two men were stationed there . By the 1850s , there was renewed military interest in the site , and several proposals were made to redevelop it to mount as many 32 artillery guns ; the plans were not taken forward , and it was noted that the presence of the 16th @-@ century stone keep would create dangerous splinters in the event of any enemy artillery fire landing there . In 1887 , the Castle Yacht Club was established just beside the castle along the spit . 
 During the 1880s , concerns were raised that Southampton might be vulnerable to French attack using small ships armed with torpedoes . As a result , in 1894 the War Office took the castle back from the coastguard , building a boom across Southampton Water which was moved using three gunboats . The 16th @-@ century castle was too small to host a gun battery to protect the boom , so a larger battery was built south of the old castle in 1895 , armed with two 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 120 mm ) and four 12 @-@ pounder ( 5 @.@ 4 kg ) quick @-@ firing guns , supported by three searchlights mounted on the older castle walls . The boom was managed from two towers called " dolphins " , one just beside the castle and the other on the far side of the water , each with two 12 @-@ pounder quick @-@ firing guns of their own , in turn supported by machine guns . The creation of these defences ultimately forced the nearby yacht club to move to the southern end of the spit . 
 = = = 1900 – 45 = = = 
 In the first years of the 20th century , Calshot Castle 's defensive role continued unchanged . The castle 's keep was redesigned in 1907 to allow it to house two of the castle 's quick @-@ firing guns on its roof . A new , lighter " ladder " boom across Southampton Water was installed in 1907 , but within two years this approach had been replaced by a plan to block Southampton Water with a boom made up of floating hulks . A 1910 plan proposed that the castle would be garrisoned in wartime by 10 officers and 154 men , 75 of whom would have to be housed nearby rather than in the fort itself ; additional naval personnel would also have been needed to man the support vessels for the boom . A Royal Naval Air Station was built alongside the castle in 1913 to house twelve experimental seaplanes which were intended to support the Royal Naval fleet operating along the Channel . Calshot was particularly suitable for seaplanes , as the surrounding waters and coastline were relatively quiet and calm . 
 The First World War broke out in 1914 , when military opinions on the utility of Calshot Castle had shifted considerably . The decision was taken to rely primarily on gun batteries at the two entrances to the Solent , rather than at Calshot and Southampton Water . At the start of conflict the boom was removed and replaced by anti @-@ submarine nets further up the coast ' two of Calshot 's guns were removed the following year to protect the new nets . The airbase was used for training purposes until 1916 , when it took on anti @-@ submarine patrols over the Channel , where the German raids had started to inflict critical damage . Almost 3 @,@ 500 hours were flown by aircraft from Calshot that year , with over 3 @,@ 500 being flown in 1917 and over 9 @,@ 000 in just three months of 1918 . Subordinate air stations were created in Bembridge , Newhaven , Polegate and Portland . A cabin was built on top of the keep to oversee air operations , the Castle Yacht Club was taken over for use as the officers ' mess and the air station spread out across Calshot Spit , including occupying the 1895 battery . Calshot 's remaining guns were removed and probably dispatched to the front line in France . 
 During the inter @-@ war years Calshot was taken over by the Royal Air Force , becoming RAF Calshot . It was used as the School for Naval Co @-@ operation and Aerial Navigation from 1918 onwards and began housing the Seaplane Training Squadron in 1931 . The 1895 battery was demolished to create additional space for the growing station , and a narrow @-@ gauge railway constructed along the spit . Parts of the castle moat were concreted over to provide parking for planes . Calshot twice hosted the Schneider Trophy air races over the Solent , the last two in the sequence of popular international events designed to encourage the development of new , high @-@ speed technology . The Empire Air Day events were also held at Calshot , attracting 1 @,@ 000 visitors in 1935 . 
 During the Second World War , Calshot Castle was initially defended by troops from the Hampshire Regiment , and a barge equipped with two 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) anti @-@ aircraft guns and a 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) Bofors gun . Air @-@ raid shelters were constructed in the castle 's moat , with five boats from the base taking part in the Dunkirk evacuation . The threat of German invasion increased , however , and the defences were expanded in 1940 , with two 12 @-@ pounder quick firing guns placed on the keep 's roof , supported by searchlights . Two additional subordinate batteries , Bungalow and <unk> , were built the following year on the other side of Southampton Water and further south @-@ west along the coast . The castle was not damaged during the war and by 1943 was placed on a " care and maintenance " basis , acting as a way station for passing aircraft . 
 = = = 1945 – 21st century = = = 
 After the war , Calshot returned to duty as an active air base , housing two squadrons of Sunderland flying boats which took part in the Berlin airlift of 1948 , before being passed across to Maintenance Command in 1953 . The Southampton Harbour Board built a coastguard lookout tower at the castle in 1952 , and the following year they began to construct a signal station tower on top of the keep , complete with radar and radio facilities , which opened in 1958 . By then , military seaplanes had become obsolete , and the RAF station was finally closed in 1961 . 
 Hampshire County Council leased the site from the Crown Estates in 1964 ; the castle itself passed into the guardianship of the state , and the hangars were used as an activity centre . A Royal National Lifeboat Institution station opened in 1971 alongside the castle , with a 130 @-@ foot ( 40 m ) -tall replacement coastguard tower constructed two years later . 
 English Heritage took over management of the castle in 1983 , and stripped back 20th @-@ century additions to present it as it might have appeared in 1914 , including demolishing the old signal station tower . The site remains open to visitors and received 5 @,@ 751 visitors in 2010 . The castle is protected under UK law as a grade 2 * listed building and as a scheduled monument . The air station 's former hangars are still used as a recreation centre by Hampshire County Council . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 Calshot Castle is a three @-@ storey , circular fortification , comprising a keep , gatehouse and curtain wall , predominantly constructed of ashlar Portland stone . When first built in the 16th century , it was designed to carry three tiers of artillery : two positioned on the second floor and the roof of the central keep , and the third in the outer curtain wall . Additional guns could have been placed on the roof of the gatehouse and on the first floor of the keep . Historic England considers it to form a " well preserved example " of the Device Forts . 
 The castle is surrounded by a water @-@ filled , 16 @-@ sided moat , 8 @.@ 8 metres ( 29 ft ) across , accessed over a 20th @-@ century bridge into the gatehouse , an 18th @-@ century design based on a simpler 16th @-@ century original . The gatehouse was altered in 1896 , with the addition of brick @-@ built ancillary buildings to the southern end . It was probably intended to provide additional living space for the garrison . The gatehouse leads into what was originally a 16 @-@ sided courtyard with 15 gun embrasures round the curtain wall . The wall was lowered to its current height in the 1770s and a concrete building to house searchlights , dating from 1896 , now stretches along the southern end of the castle . 
 In the centre of the castle is the keep , which has an external diameter of 16 metres ( 52 ft ) , an octagonal lower storey and circular walls on the upper levels . Originally this held accommodation for the captain and the garrison , but it was heavily redeveloped in the 19th and 20th centuries . Its exterior walls have eight recesses at ground level , originally used to store ammunition for the castle 's guns . The basement of the keep was redesigned in the 1890s , when electrical generators were installed , protected by a new , thicker , concrete ceiling . It may originally have been vaulted in stone in a similar style to nearby Hurst Castle . 
 The first floor of the keep has been restored to its early 20th @-@ century appearance as a barracks room . The second floor was redeveloped in the late 19th century to form another barracks room , with its ceiling incorporating additional early 20th @-@ century girders and concrete to support the gun battery above it . The roof of the keep has two 12 @-@ pounder gun mounts with their original gun @-@ lockers ; there is a 12 @-@ pounder gun on display originally used on a Royal Naval vessel . The keep 's roof would originally have been flat , with crenellations for artillery , but both the roof and crenellations were removed in the 1770s . 
 = Was willst du dich betrüben , BWV 107 = 
 Was willst du dich betrüben ( Why would you grieve ) , BWV 107 , is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach . It was composed in Leipzig for the seventh Sunday after Trinity and first performed on 23 July 1724 . The chorale cantata is based on the words of Johann Heermann 's hymn in seven stanzas " Was willst du dich betrüben " ( 1630 ) . 
 Bach structured the cantata , the seventh work in his chorale cantata cycle , in seven movements : two framing choral movements , a recitative and an unusual sequence of four bipartite arias . He scored the work for three vocal soloists , a four @-@ part choir , and a Baroque chamber ensemble of a horn to reinforce the hymn tune in the outer movements , two transverse flutes , two oboes d 'amore , strings and continuo . It is the only known work from his chorale cantata cycle that kept the original words unchanged . 
 = = History and words = = 
 Bach composed the chorale cantata in Leipzig for the Seventh Sunday after Trinity . The prescribed readings for the Sunday are from the Epistle to the Romans , " I speak in human terms because of your human limitations ... the wages of sin is death ; but the gift of God is eternal life " ( Romans 6 : 19 – 23 ) , and from the Gospel of Mark , the feeding of the 4000 ( Mark 8 : 1 – 9 ) . 
 The cantata is based on Johann Heermann 's hymn in seven stanzas , " Was willst du dich betrüben " ( 1630 ) , which is focused on trust in God , even when facing adversaries including the devil . Trust in God is also a theme of the Gospel . Unusually for a chorale cantata of the second cycle , the text is not changed in the middle movements , but kept " per omnes versus " ( for all stanzas ) . The middle movements are , however , composed as a recitative and four arias . The treatment was decidedly old @-@ fashioned in Bach 's time . He had used it once much earlier in Christ lag in Todes Banden , BWV 4 ( 1707 ) , and then again later , as in Gelobet sei der Herr , mein Gott , BWV 129 ( 1726 ) , though it was not repeated during the second cycle . John Eliot Gardiner assumes that Bach imposed this restriction on himself , as he had done with the restriction to place the cantus firmus in soprano , alto , tenor and bass in the first four cantatas of the cycle . Gardiner comments on the " seventeenth @-@ century design " of composing the unchanged chorale text , compared to settings of <unk> , Telemann and Graupner : 
 But only Bach is prepared to make life consistently difficult for himself , as here , for example , by choosing to incorporate verbatim all seven stanzas of a rather obscure chorale by Johann Heermann from 1630 . … Bach rises to the challenge : to overcome the limitations of being confined to a rigidly structured hymn without monotony or repetitiveness . 
 The chorales in Heermann 's 1630 publication <unk> musica cordis ( Music of a devoted heart ) , which also included " Herzliebster Jesu , was hast du <unk> " , the first chorale in Bach 's St Matthew Passion , have been described as " the first in which the correct and elegant versification of Opitz was applied to religious subjects , … distinguished by great depth and tenderness of feeling , by an intense love of the Saviour , and earnest but not self @-@ conscious humility " . 
 Bach first performed the cantata , the seventh extant cantata of his second annual cycle , on 23 July 1724 . 
 = = Scoring and structure = = 
 Bach structured the cantata in seven movements , beginning with a chorale fantasia and ending in a closing chorale , as usually in his chorale cantatas , but with an unusual sequence of only one recitative and four arias , setting the poetic hymn stanzas . He scored it for three vocal soloists ( soprano ( S ) , tenor ( T ) and bass ) ( B ) , a four @-@ part choir , and a Baroque chamber ensemble of corno da caccia ( Co ) to support the chorale tune in the outer movements , two flauti traversi ( Ft ) , two oboes d 'amore ( Oa ) , two violins ( Vl ) , two violas ( Va ) and basso continuo ( Bc ) .

 = = = 1 = = = 
 The opening chorus , " Was willst du dich betrüben " ( Why do you wish to trouble yourself ) , is a chorale fantasia , with the vocal part embedded in an independent concerto of the instruments . The cantus firmus on the melody of " Von Gott will ich nicht lassen " is in long notes , partly embellished , in the soprano and horn ; the lower voices are mostly set in homophony . The lines of the chorale are not rendered separately , but accenting the bar form ( Stollen – Stollen – Abgesang ) of the text , 1 and 2 are combined , 3 and 4 are combined , 5 is single and 6 to 8 are combined . The scoring is relatively rich in woodwinds . 
 = = = 2 = = = 
 The only recitative , " Denn Gott <unk> <unk> , der sich auf ihn <unk> " ( For God abandons none who entrust themselves to Him ) , is accompanied by the oboes d 'amore , shows an extended melisma on the word " Freuden " ( joy ) and culminates in an arioso in the final line , with a melisma on " <unk> " ( rescue ) . The following four stanzas are composed as arias , not as the typical da capo arias , but mostly in two parts . Bach achieves variation by changing voice type , key and time signature . He also varies the mode , alternating major and minor keys , expresses different <unk> , and he successfully " blurs " the bar form of the stanzas . 
 = = = 3 = = = 
 The first aria , " Auf ihn <unk> du es wagen " ( In Him you can dare all ) , depicts a " hunting scene " for bass and strings . Bach plays on the double meaning of the German word " <unk> " , which in the text has the sense " achieve by great exertion " , but he expresses the word 's literal meaning ( " to hunt " ) by an " outrageous hunting call trill " of the bass . This aria and those following are not da capo arias , but follow the bar form of the poem as bipartite structures . 
 = = = 4 = = = 
 The second aria , " Wenn auch gleich aus der <unk> " ( Even if , out of hell ) , for tenor and continuo begins with strong words on Satan as an enemy : " Wenn auch gleich aus der <unk> / der Satan <unk> sich / dir <unk> <unk> / und <unk> wider dich " ( " Even if , out of hell , Satan wishes to set himself against you , and vent his rage on you " ) . Gardiner calls the music " a vivid pen @-@ portrait of Satan and his wiles , delivered with typically Lutheran relish " . The rhythm alternates between 6 / 8 and 3 / 4 one measure to the next , but the change is irregular and unpredictable . The bass line ( marked " organo e continuo " ) is " extravagantly animated and angular . Albert Schweitzer likens it to the contortions of a huge dragon " . 
 = = = 5 = = = 
 The third aria , " Er <unk> 's zu seinen Ehren " ( He arranges for your honor ) , for soprano and the two oboes d 'amore begins with an embellished version of the chorale tune , and the last line quotes the tune exactly on the words " was Gott will , das <unk> " ( " What God wants , that happens " ) . 
 = = = 6 = = = 
 The fourth aria , " Drum ich mich ihm <unk> " ( Therefore I devote myself to Him ) , is scored for tenor , the flutes in unison and muted violin . The melodic style is significantly different to the chorale melody , being song @-@ like . 
 = = = 7 = = = 
 The closing chorale , " Herr , gib , daß ich dein Ehre " ( Lord , grant that Your honor ) , is set in four parts for the voices , but embedded in a rich orchestral Siciliano concerto . The lines of the chorale are grouped as in the first stanza , again highlighting line 5 , " O Vater , Sohn und Geist " ( " Oh Father , Son and Spirit " ) as a miniature doxology .

 = My All = 
 " My All " is a song by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey from her sixth studio album , Butterfly ( 1997 ) . It was released as the album 's fifth single overall and second commercial single on April 21 , 1998 by Columbia Records . The song was written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff . " My All " is built around Latin guitar chord melodies , and makes subtle use of Latin percussion throughout the first chorus , before taking on a more conventional contemporary R & B @-@ style beat . Carey was inspired to write the song and use Latin inspired melodies after her trip to Puerto Rico , where she was influenced by the culture . The song 's lyrics tell of a lonely woman declaring she would give " her all " to have just one more night with her estranged lover . 
 The music video for the song was released in March 1998 . It shows many scenes of Carey laying on a submerged vessel in a large body of water , while lamenting her lost lover . Towards the video 's climax , Carey and her love interest climb atop a lighthouse and caress each other under the night 's sky . " My All " was performed live on various occasions , including the 1998 World Music Awards and Blockbuster Entertainment Awards , Saturday Night Live , The Rosie O 'Donnell Show and various European television and music chart programs . The song was also part of Carey 's 1998 Butterfly World Tour , and was performed during many future tours and concerts . House music producer David Morales remixed the song , which was sung in live medley 's with the original . 
 " My All " was well received by contemporary music critics and charted strongly throughout various music markets . In the United States , the song became Carey 's thirteenth chart topper on the Billboard Hot 100 , and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . Throughout Europe , the song performed moderately , peaking at number four in the United Kingdom and in the top ten in Belgium ( Wallonia ) , France , Spain and Switzerland . In France , due to strong sales , the song was certified silver by the Syndicat National de l 'Édition Phonographique ( SNEP ) . 
 = = Background = = 
 Carey began writing and composing themes for Butterfly by the end of 1996 . She considered this period in time a " redefining moment for herself , " where she began writing and recording the music she truly loved , Contemporary R & B and hip hop . Additionally , Carey began incorporating other genres of music into her song @-@ writing , assisting her in developing new ideas and melodies . Carey expressed how the mixed emotions she felt at that point in her life helped develop the song , as she would " pour herself and emotions into anything she was writing at the time . " In an interview with Fred Bronson , Carey expressed how her visit to Puerto Rico and the current emotions in her life inspired her to write " My All " : 
 I had gone to Puerto Rico and was influenced by Latin music at that moment . When I came back , the melody was in my head . It was at a melancholy point in my life and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me . It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can 't , so your confined yet you 're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing . Thats why think a lot of people felt very strongly about that song , because the emotion is clear when you listen to it . 
 Carey began to infuse her personality into her work , something that showed throughout various tracks . During her stay , she was influenced by the Latin culture , and began harmonizing and singing the music she heard there . When she arrived back to New York , she already had the melody developed , and soon began working on the song in San Francisco with Afanasieff . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Carey and Afanasieff had worked together since her debut release in 1990 . Together , they had written most of Carey 's biggest hits at the time , including " Hero " and " One Sweet Day . " " My All " would be the last time the two would collaborate , as he is absent from the writing credits in her follow @-@ up album , Rainbow ( 1999 ) . During the recording of the song , Carey and then husband Tommy Mottola were in the midst of their divorce . Afanasieff , who had developed relationships with the two of them , was caught in the middle . He spoke of the difficulties he had recording " My All " with Carey , as their relationship had already strained during the divorce . Afanasieff had been employed by Mottola and Columbia Records , and had worked extensively with Carey in the studio . In an interview with Fred Bronson , Afanasieff spoke in depth of the personal problems he experienced with Carey in 1997 : 
 I needed to maintain a very strong relationship with Tommy [ Mottola ] . During that period , the beginning of their end , I had to stay away more than normal from her because she was going through a rough time . She felt that shutting her relationship with Tommy was also a cleansing of who she was . She felt that part of what she was dropping was the <unk> pop singer ballad kind of stuff he was adamant about . I had to make my exit and say ' Mariah , you need to redefine yourself , that 's fine . I 'm here doing what I do and if and when you want to come back and do it again , I 'm here . 
 " My All " was written in Carey 's home @-@ studio in upstate New York , and was recorded in Afanasieff 's recording studio in San Francisco . After she presented him with the melody she had developed in Puerto Rico , he began playing chord changed on the piano , while Carey sang the tune and directed him . After they produced the chorus , Carey wrote the lyrics , while he added a drum groove to the basic melody . According to Afanasieff , " My All " had tapped into both their Latin backgrounds . While she hadn 't spent much time with her Venezuelan paternal grandfather , Carey said the music was " definitely subconsciously in me . " On the other hand , Afanasieff was born in Brazil , and had heard Russian and Brazilian music his whole life . In an interview with Fred Bronson , Afanasieff described the steps they took to record the song : 
 I remember being in the back part of the studio , and we were sitting there late at night and writing . I was strolling through some sounds and came upon a particular sound from a steel acoustic guitar . I played these really beautiful chord changes that eventually led to ' My All . ' She started singing and I started playing , and we came up with the basis for the song . I put a little drum groove down and it was one of the easier songs to write with her . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " My All " is a slow @-@ tempo ballad , that blends contemporary R & B beats and Latin guitar and chord melodies , making subtle use of Latin percussion in the first chorus . The song is described as having a " lush sound " and featured synthetic guitar arpeggios that were produced in the studio . " My All " was compared to Toni Braxton 's music style , described as " slink , slow @-@ jam R & B sounds . " The song is set in the signature common time , and is written in the key of G minor . It features a basic chord progression of A ♭ -F ♭ -1 . Carey 's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of B2 to the high note of F5 , with the piano and guitar pieces range from G ♭ 3 to G ♭ 5 . The track was very different than anything Carey had ever recorded , incorporating strong " Latin cultured background . " The instrumentation and vocal arrangement used in the song was compared to Kenneth " Babyface " Edmonds ' productions , due to its " soft R & B coos and guitar melodies . "

 " My All " garnered critical acclaim from contemporary music critics . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic chose the song as one of the three " track choices " from the album . Larry Flick from Billboard praised the song , calling it an " anthemic gem . " Flick also described the song as " sparkling with a house flavor that 's mildly reminiscent of Toni Braxton 's landmark ' Un @-@ break My Heart ' . " While reviewing the album , Flick also reviewed the Morales remix , writing " Morales straddles the fence between underground aggression and pop @-@ radio fluff with deceptive ease , crafting a track anchored with a muscular bassline and embellished with vibrant synths . It 's 10 minutes of pure disco bliss . " David Browne from Entertainment Weekly praised the song 's instrumentation , noting " with its gently plucked guitars , is the best Babyface track Babyface never produced . "

 " My All " features two remixes : the first is a contemporary R & B version titled , " My All / Stay Awhile " ( So So Def Remix ) . Carey re @-@ recorded her vocals for the song , while building it around a sample from the Loose Ends song " Stay a Little While , Child . " Carey 's vocal interpolation blends the first verse and chorus of " My All " with the verse and chorus of " Stay a Little While , Child . " It was produced by Jermaine Dupri and features raps from Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz . The single also features a version without any rap verses . The second remix is a dance version mixed by David Morales . The dance remix is known as the Classic Club Mix ; it was Carey 's first collaboration with Morales that did not feature entirely new vocals . Consequently , the song is fairly close to the original chord progressions of the album version , though some new vocals were added . The remix was performed live as a medley with the original during many of Carey 's live concert tours . 
 Carey recorded a Spanish version of " My All " titled , " Mi Todo . " Unlike with " Hero " ( 1993 ) and " Open Arms " ( 1995 ) , Carey recorded the Spanish version of the song in a different key from the original English version . The first line of the song had been mistranslated and was grammatically incorrect . Carey later mentioned on her website that she would no longer record Spanish versions of her songs until she could verify the correct lyrics and pronunciation . " Mi Todo " was remixed as well , however only being released as a promotional single in Mexico . 
 = = Music videos = = 
 " My All " and the " My All / Stay Awhile " ( So So Def Remix ) featured different music videos . The video for " My All " was shot entirely in black and white in Puerto Rico , and was directed by fashion photographer Herb Ritts . The video begins with Carey lying on an overturned vessel on a beach , staring into the night sky , lamenting her estranged lover . As the scenes progress , Carey 's love interest is seen atop a lighthouse in the middle of the ocean , searching for his lost companion . Further scenes show Carey laying on a large conch shell , wet and vulnerable . Soon after , she begins walking on a path of large white flowers , until she reaches the top of the lighthouse where she is rejoined with her lover . After the song 's second verse , Carey and the man begin caressing each other , and embracing atop the lighthouse . After they share an intimate moment , Carey is shown walking back on the trail of white flowers , smiling and happy . The scenes of Carey lying in the shell and in front of the flowers were inspired by Sandro Botticelli 's painting The Birth of Venus . According to author Chris Nickson , the snippets of Carey on the overturned vessel showed her vulnerability without her loved one , truly highlighting the yearning emphasized in the song . 
 A music video was also filmed for the So So Def remix . Directed by Diane Martel , it was shot in a grainy fashion to simulate a home video . The video features cameo appearances by Dupri , Tariq and Gunz . It begins with scenes of Carey and Dupri at a small in @-@ home gathering , lounging and enjoying each other 's company .

 = = Early life and junior career = = 
 Robson was born on 21 January 1994 in Melbourne , Australia , the third child of Australian parents Andrew , an oil executive with Royal Dutch Shell , and Kathy Robson , a sports coach and former professional basketball player . Robson and her family moved from Melbourne to Singapore when she was 18 months old , and then to the United Kingdom when she was six . 
 According to her parents , she began playing tennis " as soon as she could hold a tennis racquet " , and after being encouraged by them , she entered a junior tennis academy at age seven . She signed with management company Octagon when she was 10 , with Adidas at age 11 , and also signed a racquet deal with Wilson Sporting Goods . 
 After working with several coaches , including the head of the Lawn Tennis Association Carl Maes , she chose coach Martijn Bok in 2007 . Bok said later that although Robson " had trouble staying emotionally under control " , he " saw right away ... a lot of potential in Laura . " Robson also began training at the National Tennis Centre , under the guidance of Bok , Maes , and the head of women 's tennis at the centre , Nigel Sears , while taking school lessons at home . 
 Robson 's first tournament on the junior ITF tour was in May 2007 , where she went from the qualifying draw of the tournament to the quarterfinals . She reached the final of two other tournaments in 2007 , and won her first tournament in October . In the first half of 2008 , Robson reached the finals of three tournaments , but was also eliminated before the third round in three straight tournaments . 
 Robson competed in her first junior grand slam at the Wimbledon girls ' event , as an unseeded player . As the youngest player in the tournament , she beat first seed Melanie Oudin on her way to the finals , where she defeated third seed <unk> <unk> . Her victory made her the first British player to win the girls ' event since Annabel Croft in 1984 , and the British media described her as the " new darling " of British tennis , and the " Queen of Wimbledon " . 
 After a brief period on the main tour , Robson returned to junior competition but was knocked out in the second round of a tournament in December . In the same month she played her final junior tournament of 2008 , the Orange Bowl , where she had to retire in the third round with a stomach strain . At the end of the year , she was shortlisted for the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year , but lost out to Paralympic swimmer Eleanor Simmonds . 
 After recovering from her injury , Robson entered the 2009 Australian Open junior tournament , where she was seeded fifth . In the semifinals she faced a replay of her Wimbledon final , against top seed <unk> <unk> , whom she beat in straight sets to reach her second Grand Slam junior final . Facing third seed Ksenia <unk> from Russia , Robson was defeated in straight sets . She later attributed her loss to <unk> 's greater consistency , and her coach Bok said that " everybody has to be patient " . After the tournament , Robson started to train with Gil Reyes , the former trainer of Andre Agassi . She was also named the MCC Young Sportswoman of the Year . She claimed the top ranking of ITF junior tour in April , despite not playing for two months because of shin splints .

 = Lactarius subdulcis = 
 Lactarius subdulcis , commonly known as the mild milkcap or beech milk cap , is an edible mushroom in the genus Lactarius . It is brown in colour , with a large number of gills and a particularly thin layer of flesh in the cap . Mycorrhizal , the mushroom is found from late summer to late autumn at the base of beech trees in small groups or individually , where it is one of the two most common species of fungi . Alternatively , it can be found in large groups in fields , sometimes with more than a hundred individual mushrooms . It is found in Europe , and , despite previous research to the contrary , is absent in North America . Although considered edible , it is not particularly useful as food due to its ivy @-@ like taste and the fact that more choice mushrooms will be easily found at the same time . L. subdulcis is known for its abundant , sweet @-@ tasting milk that , unlike the latex of some of its relatives , does not stain fabric yellow . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Lactarius subdulcis was first described as Agaricus subdulcis by mycologist Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1801 , before English mycologist Samuel Frederick Gray placed it in its current genus Lactarius in 1821 in his The Natural Arrangement of British Plants . The specific epithet is derived from Latin words sub " under " , and dulcis " sweet " , after the milk 's delayed sweet taste . As well as mild milk cap , beech milk cap is an alternate common name . 
 = = Description = = 
 Lactarius subdulcis has a convex cap of 3 – 7 cm ( 1 – 3 in ) across that later develops a depression . It sometimes has a small umbo , and in colour can be a reddish @-@ brown , rusty or dark @-@ cinnamon , later paling to buff , though darker in the middle . The cap can be fairly rigid to flexible , and smooth to slightly wrinkled . At first , the margin is incurved though it is sometimes slightly furrowed . The stem is 3 – 7 cm long and between 6 and 13 mm thick , and is generally cylindrical though can be club @-@ shaped . The stem is sometimes furrowed lengthwise , and is generally the same colour as the cap , though paler at the top . The flesh is pale and there is only a thin layer in the cap . The crowded gills are adnate to slightly decurrent , and can be white or pink in colour . It has white , plentiful milk that does not stain fabrics yellow , differentiating it from other species of Lactarius , such as L. decipiens . It has a faint , oily scent . 
 = = = Spores = = = 
 Lactarius subdulcis has cream spore print with a slight salmon tinge . The spores are oval , with <unk> warts of around 1 micrometre ( μm ) which are joined by a well @-@ developed network of mostly thin ridges . The spores measure 7 @.@ 5 – 11 μm by 6 @.@ 5 – 9 μm , and are amyloid or ellipsoid in shape . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Lactarius subdulcis is found in Europe ; it does not occur in North America , although a number of similar brownish @-@ orange species were formerly classified under this species . It is found in broad @-@ leaved woodland , especially on the floor at the base of beech trees . Along with L. vellereus , L. subdulcis is the most common fungi found on beech trees . The mushrooms can be found from late summer to late autumn , and are common . They are found individually , or in small groups . They can also be found in fields , generally appearing in large batches , with groups of over a hundred mushrooms not uncommon . 
 = = Edibility = = 
 Lactarius subdulcis has a mild taste with a slightly bitter after @-@ taste . Though considered edible after cooking , it is not recommended , as it has a taste reminiscent of ivy . There are a number of other mushrooms that appear at the same time and in the same areas as L. subdulcis that are preferable to it , including L. <unk> , meaning that L. subdulcis is not particularly useful as a foodstuff . The milk is one of distinguishing features , having a sweet taste that turns bitter in the mouth , with L. subdulcis being considered a sweet milk mushroom . 
 = Murder ( The Office ) = 
 " Murder " is the tenth episode of the sixth season of the U.S. comedy series The Office and the show 's 110th episode overall . It was written by Daniel Chun and directed by Greg Daniels . It originally aired on NBC on November 12 , 2009 . The episode guest stars Andy Buckley as David Wallace , although he only appears via the phone . 
 The series — presented as if it were a real documentary — depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton , Pennsylvania , branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company . In the episode , rumors spread that Dunder Mifflin is in financial trouble , so Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) tries to distract the office by having everyone play a murder mystery game called Belles , Bourbon , and Bullets . Meanwhile , Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms ) uses the game as a way to ask out Erin ( Ellie Kemper ) , but fears he may have asked out Erin 's character , instead of Erin herself . 
 " Murder " was the first entry in the series written by Chun , and was his first script for the series . The episode also was the inception of two major story arcs , the first being the season @-@ long arc of Dunder Mifflin going out of business and its purchase by the printer company Sabre in the episode of the same name , and the second being the budding romance between Andy and Erin . The episode scored a 4 @.@ 2 / 10 rating share in the 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ old demographic , and was watched by 8 @.@ 046 million viewers . The episode received largely positive reviews from critics , with many highlighting its purposeful ridiculousness . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In the cold open , Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) instructs the members of the office once a year on the various " changes " that various martial arts have experienced . Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) pranks Dwight by asking him to demonstrate the moves on himself , because Jim reasons Dwight is the most worthy opponent for himself . Dwight ends up punching , blocking , and kicking his own attacks , and ultimately ends up punching himself in the groin , to the bemusement to the members of the office . 
 The members of the office learn that Dunder Mifflin is in financial trouble . In an attempt to get the worried staff under control , Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) and Jim call a meeting to provide optimistic viewpoints , despite the steadily worsening news . In a moment of quick thinking , Michael pulls out a murder mystery party game called Belles , Bourbon , and Bullets and forces the rest of the staff to play along . The staff slowly warms up to the game . It is set in Savannah , Georgia , and everyone has to adopt a Southern accent . Thanks to Pam Halpert ( Jenna Fischer ) , Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms ) , and Phyllis Lapin @-@ Vance ( Phyllis Smith ) , the game becomes a hit . Everyone present starts to play along , except for Oscar Martinez ( Oscar Nunez ) who tries to get updates on the situation from corporate and Creed Bratton ( Creed Bratton ) who shows up late to work and flees after being told he is a suspect in a murder . Jim , however , believes that the entire exercise is pointless . 
 Andy decides he needs to make a move on Erin ( Ellie Kemper ) before the day is out , as he may otherwise never see her again due to the possible impending closure of Dunder Mifflin . While in character , he asks Erin out for a weekend date , but becomes unsure if he really asked her out , or if he just simply asked out her murder mystery character , " Naughty Nelly . " He is worried that Erin only agreed because Naughty Nelly is a promiscuous character . 
 Just as the game seems to get interesting , Oscar returns and informs everyone that accounting has been notified to stop payments to vendors . This brings the staff out of the game and back to the reality of losing their jobs . Michael tries to win them back , but accidentally skips to the game 's conclusion , revealing that Phyllis 's character was the murderer . Although everyone else goes back to work even more stressed out , Michael refuses to give up , and continues playing the game with Dwight . After the game , Andy and Erin meet at the receptionist desk , where Erin asks him about their upcoming date . Andy tries to sound out whether the date is real or fictional by suggesting that they go to Savannah for their date . Erin remarks that Savannah is a long way away , but does so in character ; confused by this , Andy slips up and indicates that the " date " was just part of the game . Erin says she was also just playing , but appears humiliated as she walks away and later reveals to the camera crew she thought the date was real . 
 Michael tries to introduce another murder and other twists to the story to pull his staff back into the party . This infuriates Jim to his breaking point , and they hold a private talk in Michael 's office . Michael snaps at Jim and points out that he is doing this to keep the office calm . CFO David Wallace ( Andy Buckley ) finally returns the phone calls to Jim , and reveals that while nothing has been officially decided yet , Dunder Mifflin is expected to be insolvent by year @-@ end . Jim hides the news from the staff and nudges them back into the party . Jim finally realizes that Michael was doing this to help his co @-@ workers cope . At the end of the episode , Michael , Dwight , Andy , and Pam find themselves in a fake Mexican standoff lasting until 6 : 00 at night . Jim pulls Pam out so they can go home , and the others pretend to shoot each other to death .
