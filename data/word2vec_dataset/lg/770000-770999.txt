 Cho Ki @-@ chon was born to poor Korean peasants in the village of <unk> <unk> in the Vladivostok District of the Russian Far East on 6 November 1913 . The Pacific region of the Soviet Union , where he lived , was a center for Korean independence activists . He particularly drew literary inspiration from Cho <unk> @-@ hui , a fellow Korean writer living in the Soviet Union who – in believing in national emancipation by upholding socialist principles – had already written about anti @-@ Japanese guerillas . Thus he acquired a nationalistic and class conscious worldview in his literature .

 Cho studied at the Korean Teachers College in Voroshilov @-@ Ussuriysk between 1928 and 1931 . During that time , he was also a member of the communist youth league of the Soviet Union , Komsomol . 
 Cho was initially supposed to enroll at the Moscow University , but he was robbed at a train station in Omsk . With no money , Cho was stranded and had to work at a kolkhoz in Omsk for the summer to get some . The rector of the Omsk University , Aleksandr <unk> <unk> was touched by his fate and decided to admit him in the university . Thus , from 1933 until his graduation in 1937 , he attended the Faculty of Literature of the Gorky Omsk State Pedagogical University . Although he was not fluent in Russian upon entering the university , he graduated with excellent marks , and his time spent there amplified his Russian and Soviet sides . He returned to the Far East and took up teaching responsibilities at the Korean Pedagogical Institute in Vladivostok until all ethnic Koreans were forcibly moved to Central Asia , and the Institute along with Cho were relocated to <unk> @-@ Orda , Kazakh SSR in 1937 . The following year Cho went to Moscow and tried to enroll at the Moscow Literature University , only to find himself arrested on the spot for breaking the law confining Koreans to Central Asia . He then returned to the Institute in <unk> @-@ Orda and worked there until 1941 . 
 Between 1942 and 1943 , Cho served in the Soviet 25th Army 's headquarters in Voroshilov @-@ Ussuriysk in desk duty , and in a similar assignment in the Pacific Navy in Khabarovsk between 1943 and 1945 and in the First Far Eastern Front from October 1945 . A part of his job was to write propaganda leaflets spread by the Soviet Red Army in Korea . Tatiana Gabroussenko thinks it is probable that he also translated the first speech given by Kim Il @-@ sung after the liberation , on 14 October 1945 , called " Every Effort for the Building of a New Democratic Korea " , into Korean . The original speech was written by Soviet officers . Cho entered North Korea with the Red army that year .

 Immediately after the liberation of Korea , Soviet authorities sent Cho , who was fluent in both Korean and Russian , to North Korea in order to shape the country 's literary institutions on the Soviet model . Cho diligently followed the Workers ' Party 's instructions to " immerse [ oneself ] in the masses " and would visit factories , villages and farms and write poems based on these experiences . His experiences in the Soviet Union helped him in producing explicitly political works . Many other authors were not equally adept to write about political subjects and were reluctant to visit places of work . His role in shaping North Korean literature was to be pivotal . Cho 's early works Mt . Paektu ( MR : <unk> , 1947 ) and Land ( MR : <unk> , 1946 ) would point out the direction that North Korean literature was about to take . These very works would soon become models for North Korean literature . Upon his return , he started writing for Chosŏn Sinmun , the Soviet Red Army 's Korean @-@ language paper , working as a correspondent and translator . He translated works of such Soviet poets as Mayakovsky , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . 
 The literary circles of the time were divided based on divisions in North Korean politics as a whole . Cho associated himself with the other ethnic Koreans who had come from the Soviet Union . This literary group was close to the political Soviet Koreans faction . 
 During the Korean War , Cho worked for Rodong Sinmun and also wrote propaganda poems . Before the war , he had been a member of the Standing Committee of the North Korean Literary and Art Federation . In 1951 , he was selected the vice @-@ chairman of the unified Korean Federation of Literature and Arts ( MR : Chosŏn <unk> ch <unk> , <unk> ) which was chaired by Han Sorya . He was a member of its subdivision called the Literature Organization ( MR : <unk> <unk> ) .

 = = = In the Soviet Union = = = 
 While still at the Pedagogical Institute , Cho released a novel . The novel describes anti @-@ Japanese armed struggle , and is similar in content to his later work Mt . Paektu . The novel might have acted as a prototype for it . In addition to poetry and poetic criticism , Cho was interested in drama . Cho contributed to the creation of a drama called Hong <unk> @-@ do , about the revolutionary Hong <unk> @-@ do , by Tae Jang @-@ chun and other Koreans living in the Soviet Union . Mt . Paektu retains elements from this work , too . He published his first poem the age of 17 in a Korean newspaper , <unk> , in Russia . Between 1930 and 1933 he wrote poems such as " The Morning of the Construction " , " To the Advanced Workers " , " The Military Field Study " and " Paris Commune " . While still in the Soviet Union , he also wrote poems " To Rangers " and " Outdoor Practice " . 
 = = = In North Korea = = = 
 After moving to North Korea , he released " New Year " . Other poems by Cho include : " Tuman River " ( MR : <unk> , 1946 ) about the sufferings of Koreans under Japanese rule and " Our Way " ( Uri @-@ ŭi kil , 1949 ) on Soviet @-@ Korean friendship . The Song of Life ( <unk> 'ai @-@ ŭi <unk> , 1950 ) is a long epic about industrialization . It praises the country 's developing industry but fails to take note of its roots in Japanese projects during the occupation . It also features a theme often found in Stalinist fiction : " class enemies " that seek to hamper progress . Other poems include : Land , " Aircraft Hunters " , " On the Burning Street " ( Pul <unk> <unk> , 1950 ) , " Korean Mother " ( Chosŏn @-@ ŭi <unk> , 1950 ) , " My Heights " ( Na @-@ ŭi <unk> , 1951 ) , " We are Korean Youth " ( <unk> Chosŏn Ch <unk> , 1951 ) as well as lyric poems " Swing " ( <unk> ) and " Sitting On a White Rock " ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , 1947 ) . The serial poem Resistance in <unk> ( <unk> @-@ ŭi <unk> ) tells about the <unk> uprising in South Korea . The lyric epic Land was written on the Workers ' Party 's orders on producing works about the land reform in North Korea after the liberation , and was the first poem to describe the topic . Cho wrote lyrics for " <unk> Pass " , a song about Korean People 's Army soldiers fighting their way through <unk> to <unk> . 
 While all of the poems are thoroughly ideological , some South Korean scholars such as Yi Chang @-@ ju of the North Research Institution , have sought to emphasize Cho 's lyrical side in order to " domesticate " him to serve rapprochement between the two countries ' cultural orientations . Some of Cho 's poems have been adapted into popular music lyrics that enjoy popularity in the South as well as the North . " Whistle " ( <unk> <unk> ) , " Willow " ( <unk> <unk> ) and " Swing " are love songs that were inspired by a more relaxed cultural atmosphere following the translation of Russian @-@ language poetry into Korean . These influence include Mikhail Isakovsky 's " Katyusha " , to which " Whistle " in particular bears likeness . " Whistle " , adapted as a popular song in 1990 , is often seen in the South as a non @-@ political song . However , according to Gabroussenko , South Korean observers often fail to notice the political and cultural elements borrowed from Isakovsky and Soviet lyrical poetry . In " Whistle " , for instance , the couple embodies exemplary socialist traits : 
 = = = = Mt . Paektu = = = = 
 Cho 's long epic poem Mt . Paektu was written in February 1947 and published in 1948 in Rodong Sinmun . It was the first poem written about Kim Il @-@ sung , whom the original version of the poem simply refers to as " Commander Kim " . The poem is a classic in literature portraying the anti @-@ Japanese struggle and tells the story of the Battle of <unk> which took place in 1937 . The poem inextricably links Kim Il @-@ sung 's person with Paektu Mountain , the namesake height of the poem ; a connection that has remained central in North Korean propaganda to this day . 
 The poem has its origins in Cho 's fascination with the anti @-@ Japanese guerrillas , including Rim Chun @-@ chu and Ch 'oe <unk> , with whom he had met . The creation of the epic was politically motivated , too , as the Soviets , who had dispatched Cho to North Korea , wanted to strengthen Kim Il @-@ sung 's grip on power . Publications presenting him as a legendary anti @-@ Japanese hero were needed , and so Mt . Paektu was born . The work is dedicated " to the glorious Soviet Army that liberated Korea " , and is written with the Soviets and not the Koreans in mind . 
 Due to vigorous promotion of a " mass culture " in both the output and readership of literature , copies of Mt . Paektu were printed by the hundreds of thousands , more than any work in the history of Korean literature before that . Generally speaking , the poem was well received . The public was interested and young readers acclaimed it . It was liked in the <unk> as it employed revolutionary romanticism in its portrayal of Kim . Kim personally liked the poem , too , and began visiting Cho 's home . In his memoirs With the Century , Kim writes that he was the first person to listen to Cho recite the poem and liked its " jewel @-@ like sentences " . More than aesthetic , Kim says he was attracted to the content and they both " shed tears " when Cho chanted a passage about fallen comrades . 
 In truth , the content of Mt . Paektu exaggerates Kim Il @-@ sung 's activities during the liberation struggle . The poem presents Kim as having heroic , transcendental , humane and warm qualities . He is represented as a popular hero that the people look up to , suggesting that he is the right person to lead the newly established state . Politically , Mt . Paektu was very effective in the newly founded state . As such , it became a " new classic " , a model for the cult of personality of Kim Il @-@ sung perpetuated by subsequent works of literature in North Korea . According to B. R. Myers , the work exemplifies particular traits of an early cult of personality built upon Soviet Marxism – Leninism and bloc conformity , which were soon replaced by Korean ethnic nationalism of writers like Han Sorya . While Cho 's Kim Il @-@ sung is a brilliant strategist who has masculine qualities like strength and intellect , in Han 's works he embodies traditional Korean virtues of innocence and <unk> having " mastered Marxism – Leninism with his heart , not his brain " . The ethnically inspired style of Han would establish itself as the standard of propaganda over Jo 's . Benoit Berthelier , however , sees continuity in Cho 's work and contemporary propaganda . According to him , Cho can be credited with having created a genre of " revolutionary romanticism " , which systematized the use of legends and supernatural imagery in Kim and his followers ' cult of personality . 
 Long epic poetry was not a popular genre in North Korea before Mt . Paektu , but it was in the Soviet Union where Cho had immigrated from . Poema and Mayakovsky 's prosody and poetry were also among Cho 's influences that can be seen in Mt . Paektu . These Russian stylistic influences gave Mt . Paektu its peculiar characteristics that prompted mixed reactions from the North Korean public . For instance , some in the literature circles were unfamiliar with the concept of a lyrical epic and thought of it as an improbable amalgam of genres , criticizing the work for being indistinguishable from ordinary prose . According to <unk> David @-@ West , lecturer at Aichi Prefectural University and North Korea Review <unk> editor , the relatively favorable reaction to Mt . Paektu compared to some other literature testifies to North Korean readership being capable at being both a receptive and a dismissive audience . 
 South Korean scholars have presented two competing views about Mt . Paektu : academics of the older generation typically dismiss Mt . Paektu as " personality cult literature " . Younger generation minjung and leftist scholars , however , see guerrillas other than Kim Il @-@ sung — such as Ch <unk> @-@ ho , <unk> @-@ pun , and <unk> @-@ jun — and by extension , the people , as the " hero " of the story . For some of them , like Sin Tong @-@ ho , excluding the role of others than Kim Il @-@ sung is an outright obstruction for creating a national unity in literature . 
 The 1947 text has been revised three times because of changes within the political system of North Korea to produce " heavily revised <unk> 'e [ Juche ] editions " : in 1955 , 1986 and 1995 . The original version of the poem invokes Russian Civil War heroes Vasily Chapayev , Nikolay <unk> and Sergey Lazo , while a newer revision omits them and concentrates on indigenous assets : 
 The work was adapted on stage by Han T <unk> @-@ ch <unk> . It has been translated into English , Arabic , French , German , Russian , Spanish , Chinese , Japanese , and Mongolian . Of these , the Mongolian one was deemed " distorted " by North Koreans and sparked a diplomatic crisis in 1976 , resulting in expulsion of the Mongolian ambassador to the country . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Cho died on 31 July 1951 in his office room in Pyongyang during a United Nations forces ' bombing raid in the war . 
 Mt . Paektu received the National Prize , first class , in 1948 . Cho 's works were awarded the Festival Prize , the country 's highest literary honor , modeled after the Stalin Prize . He also was awarded the Order of the National Flag , second class , for his work during the war in 1951 , as well as a posthumous National Prize , first class , in 1952 for his cycle of poems Korea is Fighting ( MR : <unk> <unk> , 1951 ) . 
 His resting place is at the Patriotic Martyrs ' Cemetery , in Pyongyang . Today , Cho is regarded as the founding father of North Korean socialist realist poetry , or indeed poetry in general , or even North Korean literature as a whole . In the mid @-@ 1950s many Soviet Koreans , including Cho 's close friends , were discredited in purges . According to Gabroussenko , Cho 's untimely death in 1951 may have spared him his reputation and ensured his continued popularity in North Korea today . 
 = Cyclone Ivy = 
 Severe Tropical Cyclone Ivy ( Fiji Meteorological Service designation : 05F , Joint Typhoon Warning Center designation : 13P ) was a tropical cyclone that affected about 25 % of the population of Vanuatu in February 2004 . It was first classified as a tropical disturbance on February 21 between Vanuatu and Fiji . The system tracked northwestward , gradually organizing and intensifying . After attaining tropical storm status on February 23 , Ivy strengthened more quickly as it turned southwestward toward Vanuatu . It attained peak winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) while moving over Vanuatu , making it an intense Category 4 cyclone on the Australian Region Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale . By the time it passed through Vanuatu , Ivy had turned southeastward , and it gradually weakened while accelerating . After becoming extratropical on February 28 , it passed just east of New Zealand and eventually dissipated on March 2 . 
 The third significant cyclone in 14 months to affect the region , Ivy produced heavy rainfall and high winds in Vanuatu . Due to advance warning , only two people were killed , and several people were injured . The high winds damaged about 11 @,@ 000 houses , leaving many people homeless . The cyclone passed very close to the Vanuatu capital city of Port Vila , forcing the evacuation of about 2 @,@ 000 people and shutting down the main port . Cyclone Ivy also affected the Solomon Islands and New Caledonia with rainfall , and later it produced high waves in New Zealand that killed two people . Because of its severe damage on Vanuatu , the name Ivy was retired following its usage . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 In the middle of February 2004 , a monsoon trough formed in the southwest Pacific Ocean during the middle of a Madden – Julian oscillation pulse . A low pressure area developed along the trough , and the Fiji Meteorological Service ( FMS ) designated it Tropical Disturbance 5F on February 21 about halfway between Vanuatu and Fiji . Initially , the system was moving little and had a circulation that was detached from the primary area of convection . On February 22 after the thunderstorms increased , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) initiated advisories on the disturbance with the designation Tropical Cyclone 13P . Shortly thereafter , the FMS reported that the disturbance developed into a tropical depression , although the convection was transient and displaced from the circulation . The system tracked west @-@ northwestward , due to a ridge located to its south . With low wind shear and good outflow , the system gradually organized , with the circulation becoming situated underneath the convection . At 0300 UTC on February 23 , the FMS upgraded it to a tropical cyclone and gave it the name Ivy while the storm was about 510 km ( 315 mi ) northeast of Port Vila , Vanuatu . 
 After being named , Ivy quickly intensified after its convection was drawn into the circulation . Late on February 23 , the JTWC upgraded Ivy to the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale , and the FMS followed suit the following day by upgrading Ivy to a severe tropical cyclone as continued favorable conditions allowed for rapid deepening . On February 24 the cyclone began a turn to the southwest as it moved around the ridge , and the next day it turned to the south toward Vanuatu as an approaching shortwave trough passed to the south and created a weakness in the ridge . A nearby upper @-@ level low temporarily cut off outflow , although once it moved further away the low enhanced ventilation . Strengthening continued and , late on February 25 , the FMS reported that Ivy attained peak 10 – minute sustained winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) over the Vanuatu archipelago ; this made it a Category 4 on the Australian Region Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale . Around the same time , the JTWC estimated peak 1 – minute sustained winds of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) , after a 19 km ( 12 mi ) eye developed . 
 After passing slowly through Vanuatu , Ivy began accelerating to the southeast and its eye passed very close to the capital city of Port Vila , after moving over the island of Epi . As the cyclone moved away from the island group , it underwent an eyewall replacement cycle . In addition , the combination of cooler water temperatures , greater wind shear , less outflow , and land interaction with Vanuatu caused gradual weakening . Late on February 27 , Ivy entered the area of warning responsibility of the Wellington Regional Specialized Meteorological Center . The convection rapidly diminished and left the circulation exposed , and Ivy transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on February 28 . It remained strong and maintained a well @-@ defined circulation as it passed just east of East Cape , New Zealand . Continuing southeastward , the extratropical remnants crossed the International Dateline on February 29 , and Ivy dissipated about 1800 km ( 1100 mi ) southeast of New Zealand on March 2 . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 While Ivy was reaching peak intensity , it passed through Vanuatu , becoming the third major cyclone in 14 months to affect the region , after Cyclone Zoe and Cyclone Gina . Its threat prompted over 2 @,@ 000 people in Port Vila to evacuate . While Ivy moved through the country , a station on Anatom island recorded winds of 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) , which were the highest sustained winds observed in the nation . In addition , the cyclone dropped heavy rainfall , reaching 254 @.@ 4 mm ( 10 @.@ 02 in ) at <unk> International Airport in Port Vila . The central area of deep convection moved across every island in the archipelago . 
 As the cyclone moved through Vanuatu , it cut off communications between the various islands , and also knocked Radio Vanuatu offline . Overall there was widespread moderate damage , with small areas of heavier damage . The cyclone affected more than 54 @,@ 000 people – about 25 % of the population – on various islands , including <unk> , Epi , <unk> , eastern <unk> , northern Aoba , and northern Maewo . On <unk> island , the winds wrecked the roofs of houses and downed trees and vegetables . Overall , about 11 @,@ 000 houses were damaged , and a large proportion of the 24 @,@ 000 people in Ivy 's path became homeless due to the destruction of their houses , with many buildings made of iron and bamboo wrecked . In addition , the winds downed trees and power lines . 
 Heavy damage occurred in the capital city of Port Vila , where flooding washed out small bridges . Strong waves wrecked the main port there and also capsized two boats . High winds downed trees and blocked roads across the capital , with 70 % of the nation 's roads affected . Several people were injured due to flying debris , and one person was severely injured due to the storm . The high winds affected 80 % of the nation 's food crops , including the loss of much of the mango and banana crops as well as the ruination of about 75 % of the coconut and cocoa crops . The latter loss was significant due to its status as a cash crop . The cyclone damaged 90 % of the water facilities across the archipelago . It also damaged about 60 % of the health centers , as well as 112 schools , some of which were completely destroyed . Monetary damage was estimated at <unk> million ( 2004 VUV , $ 3 @.@ 8 million 2004 USD ) . Due to advance warning , there were only two deaths in Vanuatu , including one when a landslide killed a woman on Malakula island . 
 In addition to affecting Vanuatu , Ivy produced heavy rainfall in Tikopia and Anuta , two small islands in the southeastern Solomon Islands . Later , intense rainbands spread across the Loyalty Islands in New Caledonia . Along the Bay of Plenty in New Zealand , the extratropical remnants of Ivy produced high waves that killed two people in Whakatane . The storm produced a 1 in 10 year storm surge as it passed the country that peaked at 1 @.@ 04 m ( 3 @.@ 4 ft ) at <unk> . The surge , in combination with waves , reached about 5 m ( 16 ft ) at <unk> , based on the position of debris on the beach . Wind gusts reached 79 @.@ 7 km / h ( 49 @.@ 5 mph ) at the Whakatane Airport , and the combination of winds and waves produced beach erosion along the coast . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The local Red Cross offices in Port Vila and <unk> prepared general relief supplies before the storm 's arrival , including tents , tool kits , and first aid units . By four days after the cyclone 's passage , the main wharf in Port Vila was re @-@ opened and the two sunken boats were removed . Additionally , the evacuees were allowed to return to their homes , and communications between the various islands were restored . The Red Cross distributed various relief supplies to the affected citizens , including candles , matches , water , and blankets . By about two weeks after the storm , about 30 @,@ 000 household relief packages were distributed . The Vanuatu government allocated <unk> million ( 2004 VUV , $ 236 @,@ 000 2004 USD ) for the affected citizens . Overall , the cyclone severely affected the daily lives of the Vanuatu citizens . On Tanna island , the cyclone 's passage produced a malaria outbreak . 
 In the immediate aftermath , the New Zealand Red Cross provided $ 10 @,@ 000 ( 2004 NZD ) for essential relief supplies . In addition , the New Zealand government provided $ 70 @,@ 000 for assistance in the most affected areas , after the country 's Air Force dispatched a plane over Vanuatu to determine the extent of damage . The Government of Australia similarly sent a helicopter reconnaissance mission to determine damage , as well as two planes with $ 200 @,@ 000 ( 2004 AUD ) in relief supplies , including 2 @,@ 400 tarps , 2 @,@ 600 water containers , and 5 @,@ 200 packets of water purification tablets . The French government also sent a helicopter and assistance as per the 1992 FRANZ Agreement between New Zealand , Australia , and France . 
 Due to the severity of damage wrought by the cyclone , the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Ivy following its usage and replaced it with Irene . Ivy was retired along with earlier Cyclone <unk> ; the two were the only named storms to form within the basin that season .

 Solipskier is a sports video game for Adobe Flash , iOS , and Android developed and published by Mikengreg , a two @-@ man independent development team consisting of Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend . In Solipskier , the player draws the snowy slope for an on @-@ screen skier to pass through slalom gates and tunnels . The character accelerates with downhill sections and can launch into the air to perform tricks and earn a higher score . The idea came from a brainstorming session about parallax scrolling with speedy action in the foreground and the ability for the player to " paint " the terrain . It was Boxleiter and Wohlwend 's first game to receive public appreciation . It was released August 29 , 2010 to generally favorable reviews and was a runner @-@ up in the 2011 Game Developers Conference Independent Games Festival 's Best Mobile Game category . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 In the sports game Solipskier , the player draws the ground for the on @-@ screen skier to pass through a level filled with gates , tunnels , and walls . Drawing an incline , for example , will launch the skier into the air to perform tricks , and a downhill section will accelerate the skier . Upcoming obstacles are indicated at the right of the screen along with the necessary altitude and distance . A streak of successful passes through gates will accrue a bonus score . The skier 's speed also increases with time . As an endless runner ( compared to Canabalt ) , the characters advance until they die , as there is no end . If the skier travels fast enough , he loses his headphones , which cuts out the background music to the sound of the wind passing by . The player receives " All Star Dunk Contest @-@ like scorecards " after landing big jumps . Solipskier also has an online leaderboard , and offers tips for new players to improve their scores . It focuses on style and emotion from the player @-@ character 's terminal speed rather than on jumps and tricks . It also has a hard rock guitar soundtrack . 
 = = Development = = 
 Solipskier was designed for the Adobe Flash platform . Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend had worked on Flash games earlier as Intuition Games . The idea for the game came from a brainstorming session about parallax scrolling , and was revised in fits of creativity . They paired the parallax scrolling with speed , and eventually Boxleiter " blurted out with wide @-@ eyes " that the player could " paint the terrain to determine the speed of the character " . They chose a snow or snowmobile theme and began to prototype that same night . Boxleiter used skills he had acquired from previous games ( <unk> from Dinowaurs and bitmap drawing from EON ) to make a mockup within hours : a red ball that moved along with a slope ( made with the mouse ) and floated down slowly when suspended in air . He added three gates to create a slalom skiing course and a sense of distance and speed , which was not apparent otherwise . Boxleiter then set up indicators to show the incoming gates , though he thought it was odd to have the indicators move to the right as the gate moved to towards the player ( to the left ) . There was no parallax scrolling implemented in this phase . 
 Meanwhile , Wohlwend mocked up a 2D course in grayscale , with humps of mountains . He originally designed the visuals such that there would be nothing on the screen where the player had not painted , which was later cut . After seeing Boxleiter 's draft , he used crisp colors to make distinct gate markers and made the foreground highly contrast with the background . Their early drafts had a nighttime theme and included an aurora that was later cut due to difficulty of implementation in Flash . Wohlwend left the character design for last as his " weak point " . Boxleiter was particularly inspired by the idea of a skier replacing the snowmobile , and set up the parallax scrolling and motion blur , which made the skier appear to go faster . He also added the " tunnel " idea as a series of gates . They animated the skier , who they gave an " ego @-@ tastic " large head on a stick figure body , and decided to not use tutorials , opting for a game that began with the player 's first click . Wohlwend 's rainbow trail effect was added as a scarf or cape ( which later became a rainbow burst behind the player ) , and the scoring mechanics were refined to reward players who took risks by letting the skier fly through the air without touching the screen . This was partly inspired by the Tony Hawk 's Pro Skater series . The title refers to a combination of solipsism and skiing . 
 The game was their first to receive public appreciation . Boxleiter first understood its potential when publishers fought for the bid to the game . At the time , it was solely designed for Flash and not iOS , though they were interested in making bigger games outside the Flash market . They announced the game in mid August 2010 , where they revealed that the game would release on Flash ( through Kongregate ) and iOS simultaneously , which happened on August 29 , 2010 . Joe Bergeron , a programmer who had previously worked on Dinowaurs with Mikengreg , helped with the iOS version of the game . Solipskier made around $ 70 @,@ 000 in its first two months ( as compared to $ 15 @,@ 000 from the Flash release ) , which let them work in other non @-@ Flash mediums in the future . They released an Android version three months later .

 The game received " generally favorable " reviews , according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic . It was a runner @-@ up in the 2011 Game Developers Conference Independent Games Festival 's Best Mobile Game category . IGN 's Levi Buchanan praised the art direction , especially the rainbow scarf against the gray , monotone background . Chris Hall of 148Apps called it " the most original since <unk> " . Hall praised the touch of having the headphones fall off , with the contrast between the hard rock guitar and the rushing natural wind , but criticized the complex scoring system . Edge 's Chris Donlan , on the other hand , appreciated the trade @-@ offs between the different opportunities to score higher . Hall of 148Apps added that Solipskier did not look as great on a Retina Display . Tim Rattray of Slide to Play called the graphics " pure eye candy " . He felt that the game was " unique , but a ' one @-@ trick pony ' combination of fast Canabalt and platform @-@ drawing Line Racer " . Likewise , IndieGames.com felt Solipskier 's novelty was ephemeral . Pocket Gamer 's Mark Brown called its difficulty " steeper than the Alps " . Pocket Gamer listed the game as one of the toughest and best indie games in 2011 , one of the best endless runners in 2012 , and a " hidden gem " in 2013 . 
 = The Botanic Garden = 
 The Botanic Garden ( 1791 ) is a set of two poems , The Economy of Vegetation and The Loves of the Plants , by the British poet and naturalist Erasmus Darwin . The Economy of Vegetation celebrates technological innovation , scientific discovery and offers theories concerning contemporary scientific questions , such as the history of the cosmos . The more popular Loves of the Plants promotes , revises and illustrates Linnaeus 's classification scheme for plants . 
 One of the first popular science books , the intent of The Botanic Garden is to pique readers ' interest in science while educating them at the same time . By embracing Linnaeus 's sexualized language , which <unk> plants , Darwin makes botany interesting and relevant to his readers , but his reliance on conventional images of women when describing plants and flowers reinforces traditional gender stereotypes . Darwin emphasizes the connections between humanity and plants , arguing that they are all part of the same natural world and that sexual reproduction is at the heart of evolution ( ideas that his grandson , Charles Darwin , would later turn into a full @-@ fledged theory of evolution ) . This evolutionary theme continues in The Economy of Vegetation which contends that scientific progress is part of evolution and urges its readers to celebrate inventors and scientific discoveries in a language usually reserved for heroes or artistic geniuses . 
 Because amateur botany was popular in Britain during the second half of the eighteenth century , The Botanic Garden , despite its high cost , was a bestseller . Nevertheless , the poem 's radical political elements , such as its support of the French revolution and its criticism of slavery , angered conservative British readers . 
 Darwin 's attempt to popularize science and to convey the wonders of scientific discovery and technological innovation through poetry helped initiate a tradition of popular science writing that continues to the present day . 
 = = Historical background = = 
 In the 1760s and 1770s , botany became increasingly popular in Britain because of the translation of Linnaeus 's works into English . One of the most prominent books about botany was William Withering 's Botanical Arrangement of all the Vegetables Naturally Growing in Great Britain ( 1776 ) , which used Linnaeus 's system for classifying plants . Withering 's book went through multiple editions and became the standard text on British plants for a generation . The book delighted and intrigued experts , amateurs , and children alike . 
 One of the effects of Withering 's book was that it provoked a debate over the translation of Linnaeus 's works . Withering aimed for an Anglicized translation of Linnaeus 's Latin that also stripped the nomenclature of its sexualized language . Although he wanted to make botany widely available , he believed that women readers should be protected from any mention of sexuality . In his preface he writes : " from an apprehension that botany in an English dress would become a favourite amusement with the ladies , . . . it was thought proper to drop the sexual distinctions in the titles to the Classes and Orders .

 Darwin held the opposite position ; he maintained that Linnaeus 's works should be translated as literally as possible and that the sexual references in the nomenclature should be retained . In 1783 and 1787 , the Botanical Society of Lichfield , founded by Darwin and several of his friends specifically to translate Linnaeus 's works , issued their own English translation , A System of Vegetables , that categorized over 1400 plants . Assisted by Samuel Johnson , they coined over fifty new botanical words ; it is this work , along with the group 's The Families of Plants that introduced the words stamen and pistil into the English language , for example . By 1796 their translation had prevailed and Withering was forced to adopt their vocabulary in later editions of his work . 
 = = = Linnaean system = = = 
 The reliability and usefulness of the Linnaean system was a subject of much debate when Darwin was composing The Loves of the Plants , leading scholars to conclude that one of his intentions in publishing the poem was to defend the Linnaean classification scheme . Linnaeus had proposed that , like humans , plants are male and female and reproduce sexually ; he also described his system using highly sexualized language . Therefore , as scholar Janet Browne writes , “ to be a Linnaean taxonomist was to believe in the sex life of flowers . ” In his poem , Darwin not only embraced Linnaeus 's classification scheme but also his metaphors . At the same time that he was defending Linnaeus 's system , however , Darwin was also refining it . Linnaeus classified plants solely on the number of reproductive organs they had , but Darwin 's poem also emphasized “ proportion , length , and arrangement of the [ sexual ] organs ” . 
 = = Writing and publication = = 
 Inspired by his enjoyment of his own botanical garden but primarily by Anna Seward 's poem “ Verses Written in Dr. Darwin 's Botanic Garden ” ( 1778 ) , Darwin decided to compose a poem that would embody Linnaeus 's ideas . ( Darwin would later include an edited version of Seward 's poem in The Loves of the Plants without her permission and without acknowledgment . Seward was rankled by this treatment and complained of Darwin 's inattention to her authorial rights in her Memoirs of Erasmus Darwin . ) According to Seward , Darwin said that “ the Linnean System is unexplored poetic ground , and an [ sic ] happy subject for the muse . It affords fine scope for poetic landscape ; it suggests metamorphoses of the Ovidian kind , though reversed . ” Darwin may have also thought of The Love of the Plants “ as a kind of love song ” to Elizabeth Pole , a woman with whom he was in love and would eventually marry . Concerned about his scientific reputation and curious to see if there would be an audience for his more demanding poem The Economy of Vegetation , he published The Loves of the Plants anonymously in 1789 ( see 1789 in poetry ) . He was stunned at its success and therefore published both Loves of the Plants and Economy of Vegetation together as The Botanic Garden in 1791 . Joseph Johnson , his publisher , eventually bought the copyright for The Botanic Garden from him for the staggering sum of ₤ 800 . 
 When Johnson published The Botanic Garden in 1791 , he charged twenty @-@ one shillings for it , a hefty price at the time . Seward wrote that " the immense price which the bookseller gave for this work , was doubtless owing to considerations which inspired his trust in its popularity . Botany was , at that time , and still continues a very fashionable study . " However , the high price would also have discouraged government prosecution for a book that contained radical political views . Any subversive ideas that the poem contained were therefore limited to an audience of the educated elite who could afford to purchase the book .

 = = = Structure and poetic style = = = 
 Suggesting the passing of a single day , The Loves of the Plants is divided into four cantos , all written in heroic couplets . A preface to the poem outlines the basics of the Linnaean classification system . Guiding the reader through the garden is a “ Botanic Muse ” who is described as Linnaeus 's inspiration . Interspersed between the cantos are dialogues on poetic theory between the poet and his bookseller . The poem is not a narrative ; instead , reminiscent of the picaresque tradition , it consists of discrete descriptions of eighty @-@ three separate species which are accompanied by extensive explanatory footnotes . 
 In The Loves of the Plants , Darwin claims " to <unk> Imagination under the banner of Science " . A believer in Enlightenment ideals , he wanted not only to participate in scientific discovery but also to disseminate its new knowledge in an accessible format . As Darwin scholar Michael Page has written , “ Darwin sought to do for Linnaeus . . . what Pope had done for Newton and celestial mechanics in the Essay on Man ” 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 In one of the interludes of The Loves of the Plants , the voice of the Poet , which would seem to be Darwin 's voice as well , argues that poetry is meant to appeal to the senses , particularly vision . Darwin 's primary tool for accomplishing this was personification . Darwin 's personifications were often based on the classical allusions embedded with Linnaeus 's own naming system . However , they were not meant to conjure up images of gods or heroes ; rather , the anthropomorphized images of the plants depict more ordinary images . They also stimulate the readers ' imaginations to assist them in learning the material and allow Darwin to argue that the plants he is discussing are animate , living things — just like humans . Darwin 's use of personification suggests that plants are more akin to humans than the reader might at first assume ; his emphasis on the continuities between mankind and <unk> contributes to the evolutionary theme that runs throughout the poem . 
 The Loves of the Plants argues that human emotion is rooted in physiology rather than Christian theology . Darwin would take his materialism even further in The Economy of Vegetation and The Temple of Nature , works that have been called atheistic . In describing plants through the language of love and sex , Darwin hoped to convey the idea that humans and human sexuality are simply another part of the natural world . Darwin writes that his poem will reverse Ovid who “ did , by art poetic , transmute Men , Women , and even Gods and Goddesses , into trees and Flowers ; I have undertaken , by similar art , to restore some of them to their original <unk> ”

 In his <unk> ( 1800 ) , Darwin wrote “ from the sexual , or <unk> generation of plants new varieties , or improvements , are frequently obtained ” . He insisted in The Loves of the Plants that sexual reproduction was at the heart of evolutionary change and progress , in humans as well as plants . Browne writes that the poem may be seen as " an early study in what was to be Darwin 's lifelong commitment to the idea of transmutation . ” Darwin illustrated not only organic change , but social and political change as well . Throughout The Botanic Garden , Darwin endorses the ideals of the American and French revolutions and criticizes slavery . His celebration of technological progress in The Economy of Vegetation suggests that social and scientific progress are part of a single evolutionary process . Humanity was improving , moving towards perfection , as evidenced by abolitionism and the broadening of political rights . 
 = = = = Gender = = = = 
 The Love of the Plants , however , while opening up the world of botany to the non @-@ specialist and to women in particular , reinforced conventional gender stereotypes . Darwin 's images “ remained deeply polarized between the chaste , blushing virgin and the seductive predatory woman , the modest shepherdess and the powerful queen . ” 
 Although Darwin gives plant @-@ women the central role in each vignette ( a reversal of Linnaeus 's classification scheme , which focuses on the male ) , few of the representations stray from stereotypical images of women . When the female and male reproductive organs are in a 1 : 1 ratio in a plant , Darwin represents traditional couplings . The women are “ playful ” , “ chaste ” , “ gentle ” and “ blooming ” . When the ratio is 1 : 2 @-@ 4 , the female becomes a “ helpmate ” or “ associate ” to the males , who have separate bonds to their “ brothers ” . Once he reaches 1 : 5 @-@ 6 , however , Darwin presents women as “ seductive or wanton ” or , at the other extreme , “ needing protection ” . By 1 : 8 + , he presents “ unambiguous metaphors of power and command , [ with the woman ] being pictured as a saint , a reigning sovereign , a sorceress , a proto @-@ industrialist . . . a priestess ” . The images also present a largely positive view of the relationship between the sexes ; there is no rape or sexual violence of any kind , elements central to much of Ovid and Linnaeus . There is also no representation of the marriage market , divorce or adultery ( with one exception ) ; the poem is largely pastoral . There are also no representations of intelligent women or women writers , although Darwin knew quite a few . The exception is the “ Botanic Muse ” , who has the botanical knowledge that the poem imparts ; however , as Browne argues , few readers in the eighteenth century would have seen this as a liberating image for women since they would have been skeptical that a woman could have written the poem and inhabited the voice of the muse ( they would have assumed that the anonymous writer was a man ) . 
 Despite its traditional gender associations , some scholars have argued that the poem provides “ both a language and models for critiquing sexual mores and social institutions ” and encourages women to engage in scientific pursuits . 
 = = The Economy of Vegetation = = 
 While The Loves of the Plants celebrates the natural world , The Economy of Vegetation celebrates scientific progress and technological innovation , such as the forging of steel , the invention of the steam engine and the improvements to gunpowder . It also advances several scientific hypotheses regarding the formation of the cosmos , the moon and the earth . Moreover , Darwin 's poem represents the scientists and inventors , such as Benjamin Franklin , responsible for this progress as the heroes of a new age ; he “ <unk> ” them . Although the two poems seem separated , they both endorse an evolutionary view of the world . Darwin did not see a distinction between nature and culture ; industrialization and technological progress were part of a single evolutionary process . 
 Much of The Economy of Vegetation deals with mining and the use of minerals . For example , Darwin describes the great mining capability of the steam engine : 
 As such examples demonstrate , The Economy of Vegetation is part of an Enlightenment paradigm of progress while The Loves of the Plants , with its focus on an integrated natural world , is more of an early Romantic work . 
 Darwin also connected scientific progress to political progress ; “ for Darwin the spread of revolution meant that reason and equity vanquished political tyranny and religious superstition . ” Criticizing British imperialism and slavery , he writes : 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 The Botanic Garden was reissued repeatedly in Britain , Ireland and the United States throughout the 1790s . Until the publication of William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's Lyrical Ballads in 1798 , Darwin was considered one of England 's preeminent poets . His poems , with their “ dynamic vision of change and transformation ” , resonated with the ideals of the French revolution . However , when the revolution entered its more radical and bloody phase , scientific progress became associated with what many started to see as a failed revolution . Anti @-@ Jacobins , who were opposed to the French revolution , denounced the sexual freedom gaining ground in France and linked it to the scientific projects of men like Darwin . George Canning and John Frere published a parody of The Loves of the Plants in the Anti @-@ Jacobin Review in 1798 titled “ Loves of the Triangles ” , suggesting just these connections . 
 Darwin 's poems were not published during the first two decades of the nineteenth century as conservative reaction solidified in Britain , although bowdlerized and sentimentalized poems imitating Darwin 's became increasingly popular . The analogy between plants and humans lasted well into the nineteenth century ; Alice in Wonderland was one of the many books to employ the image . 
 Darwin 's unique poetic style impressed some while it revolted others . Wordsworth called it “ dazzling " while Coleridge said , “ I absolutely <unk> Darwin 's poem ” . Darwin 's “ visionary temperament ” is similar in some ways to modern popular science writing . 
 = Norah Head Light = 
 Norah Head Light is an active lighthouse located at Norah Head , a headland on the Central Coast , New South Wales , Australia , close to <unk> . It is the last lighthouse of the James Barnet style to be built , and the last staffed lighthouse constructed in New South Wales . 
 Officially displayed for the first time in 1903 , the original <unk> kerosene burner was upgraded in 1923 , electrified in 1961 and automated and demanned in 1994 , after more than 90 years of being staffed . It celebrated its centenary in 2003 . 
 The concrete block tower is 27 @.@ 5 metres ( 90 ft ) high , topped by a bluestone gallery . On top of the gallery is the original Chance Bros. lantern . This lantern holds the original housing of the Chance Bros. 1st order bivalve dioptric Fresnel lens . Other important structures include the chief <unk> 's cottage and assistant keeper 's duplex , and a flag house . 
 = = History = = 
 Calls for construction of a lighthouse at Norah Head ( then " <unk> <unk> Point " ) were made as early as 1861 due to many wrecks occurring in the area . A notable supporter in the end of the 19th century was local landholder Edward Hargraves from <unk> . However , these efforts were fruitless for many years . The first formal recommendation to construct the lighthouse was made by the Newcastle Marine Board , just prior to its abolition , in 1897 . 
 The lighthouse was designed in a style similar to the style of James Barnet , by his successor Charles <unk> Harding , who also designed Cape Byron Light and Point Perpendicular Light . It is the last to be designed in this style . 
 Construction commenced in 1901 , undertaken by day labour . Materials were brought by boat and unloaded on a wharf constructed at Cabbage Tree Harbour for that purpose . It was officially lit on 15 November 1903 , two years after Cape Byron Light . The first keepers were N. H. Williams as chief keeper , with N. Hanson and S. Kells as assistant keepers . 
 The cost of the tower and cottages was nearly £ 24 @,@ 000 , £ 19 @,@ 000 for the construction of the tower and £ 5 @,@ 000 for the optical apparatus , a Chance Bros. 1st order bivalve dioptric Fresnel lens with 700 prisms 
 The original light source was a <unk> kerosene burner and mantle generating a light intensity of 438 @,@ 000 cd , visible for 18 nautical miles ( 33 km ; 21 mi ) . The original mechanism was a grandfather clock @-@ type mechanism with the counterweights going down a 100 feet ( 30 m ) central column . The weights went down gradually as the light turned and had to be wound every half an hour . The light revolved every 10 seconds , and was floating in a mercury bath of more than 15 @,@ 000 pounds ( 6 @,@ 800 kg ) to lessen the friction . The high speed of rotation made operating the light while it was active very difficult . 
 On 13 April 1923 the light source was upgraded to a Ford @-@ Schmidt kerosene burner with an intensity of 700 @,@ 000 candlepower . It was changed to revolve every thirty seconds in 1928 , to east the operation . The stables originally constructed at the complex were converted to a garage in 1960 . 
 On 28 March 1961 the light was electrified , with mains electricity as the power source , and an intensity of 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cd . The drive was replaced with a 0 @.@ 3 amp electric motor . At the same time the staff was cut from three lightkeepers to two . 
 The light was automated and demanned in 1994 . It was one of the last stations in Australia to demanned , after over 90 years of being staffed . 
 The current light source is a 1000 Watt 120 Volt tungsten @-@ halogen lamp , which flashes white every 15 seconds ( <unk> 15s ) and can be seen for 26 nautical miles ( 48 km ; 30 mi ) . It also shows a fixed red ( F.R. ) and green ( F.G. ) lights for coastal shipping . 
 The lighthouse celebrated its centenary on 15 November 2003 , and the lighthouse appeared on the cover of the <unk> Shire Council annual report for 2003 . 
 = = Structures = = 
 The lighthouse is a 27 @.@ 5 metres ( 90 ft ) tower , made from concrete blocks . The concrete blocks were made on the ground using a local aggregate , lifted and cemented into position and finally cement rendered inside and out with deep ashlar coursing , and painted white . This technique was used in the period to reduce the cost of construction . 
 On the inside of the tower there are 96 steps leading to the gallery in 4 stages , the first 3 of the same grade and the last stage a bit steeper and narrower . The staircase is made of concrete with slate treads and cast iron and brass balustrade . 
 On top of the tower is a bluestone gallery and balcony with gunmetal railings . The gallery has a painted cast iron floor grate with a cast iron stair leading to the outdoor gallery . The lantern room is atop this gallery , made of metal and glass , encircled and protected by perspex and aluminium panels . It has a decorative iron catwalk encircling the glass to allow for cleaning . The lantern house is the original 3 @,@ 700 millimetres ( 150 in ) Chance Bros. cast iron and copper lantern house , one of about 21 known to exist in Australia . 
 On the ground floor there is an entrance door made of cedar set with sidelights and fanlight , with an etching on the door glass saying <unk> <unk> Nunc <unk> , Latin for " Once Perilous , Now Safe " . Above the door is the writing " • <unk> • " , stating the year of official lighting . There is also a " ghost door " on the outside which was planned but never completed . 
 The first floor comprises an entry hallway and two rooms . The hallways is set with tessellated tiles and still has the original desk for the visitor 's book . Of the two rooms , one was the report room used for administrative work , record keeping and logbooks . It is currently used as a radio room . The second room housed a spare mantle holder . It currently houses the electrical controls , including the sensors responsible for starting the light . It also houses the backup batteries , backup diesel generator and fuel tank , as well as a small workshop . 
 The accommodations in the complex consist of a lightkeepers cottage with garden and Assistant Keeper 's duplex , both constructed from concrete blocks , unpainted from construction , and originally having " Marseilles pattern " terracotta tile roofs . The keeper 's cottage includes an open verandah on three sides , with cast iron posts and curved timber beams . The hipped roof is still the original terracotta tiles and one chimney remains . As for the duplex , circa 1970 the roof was replaced with concrete tiles and the chimneys have been demolished . 
 Also constructed were a small fuel store , workshop , paint store and earth closet near the keeper 's cottage , and two fuel stores with earth closet and sink for the assistant cottages . All were constructed in the same form , from unpainted concrete blocked and the same terracotta tile roofs . All still remain in the complex , pretty much intact . 
 As of 2010 , one of the cottages is occupied by a resident keeper and another two are available for overnight accommodations . 
 Another structure at the complex is a small signal house , which was constructed as a flag house for the timber flagstaff , both constructed with the original structures in 1903 . The flag house was constructed to match the lighthouse , from precast concrete blocks , rendered walls , with the same plinth and deep ashlar coursing . The roof is made of concrete in a shallow hipped form , in contrast to the concrete dome proposed in the original drawings . The flag locker now houses maritime signal flags . The timber flagstaff was removed at an unknown date , and what remains of it are a concrete and steel base , a concrete apron , and four concrete and iron anchor points . 
 A stable was also constructed at the premises from the same concrete blocks with Marseilles pattern terracotta tiles . In 1960 , as the stables were being converted to a garage , the roof tiles were replaced with a concrete tiles . Three timber doors to the former stable , tack and carriage rooms remain . 
 Also at the complex are underground fresh water tanks and sealed off condensation water tank beneath the tower . 
 About 100 metres ( 330 ft ) up the hill there used to be a weather station , a mother station for Montague Island in the south and South Solitary Island in the north . Reports used to be collected and sent to the Weather Bureau in Sydney . This is all done now electronically .

 = Hurricane Fay ( 2014 ) = 
 Hurricane Fay was the first hurricane to make landfall on Bermuda since Emily in 1987 . The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season , Fay evolved from a broad weather disturbance several hundred miles northeast of the Lesser Antilles on October 10 . Initially a subtropical cyclone with an expansive wind field and asymmetrical cloud field , the storm gradually attained tropical characteristics as it turned north , transitioning into a tropical storm early on October 11 . Despite being plagued by disruptive wind shear for most of its duration , Tropical Storm Fay steadily intensified . Veering toward the east , Fay briefly achieved Category 1 hurricane status while making landfall on Bermuda early on October 12 . Wind shear eventually took its toll on Fay , causing the hurricane to weaken to a tropical storm later that day and degenerate into an open trough early on October 13 . 
 A few tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued in anticipation of Fay 's impact on Bermuda , and public schools were closed as a precaution . Despite its modest strength , Fay produced extensive damage on Bermuda . Winds gusting over 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) clogged roadways with downed trees and utility poles , and left a majority of the island 's electric customers without power . The terminal building at L.F. Wade International Airport was flooded after the storm compromised its roof and sprinkler system . Along the coast , the storm unmoored and destroyed numerous boats . Immediately after the hurricane , 200 Bermuda Regiment soldiers were called to clear debris and assist in initial damage repairs . Cleanup efforts overlapped with preparations for the approach of the stronger Hurricane Gonzalo , which struck the island less than six days later and compounded the damage . Fay and Gonzalo marked the first recorded instance of two Bermuda hurricane landfalls in one season . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Hurricane Fay originated in a disturbance calved from a mid- to upper @-@ level trough over the east @-@ central Atlantic . On October 7 , a broad region of showers and thunderstorms formed around it , possibly enhanced by moisture from a tropical wave to the south . Tracking westward , the energy coalesced into an upper @-@ level cold @-@ core low on the following day , and an associated trough formed at the surface . Southwesterly wind shear initially hindered development , but as the system became more vertically aligned on October 9 , the hostile winds calmed . In turn , a curved banding feature was able to take form . Early on October 10 , satellite imagery indicated that the center of circulation had become better @-@ defined , with a swath of deep convection to the north and west of the low . It became a subtropical storm at 06 : 00 UTC on October 10 , though it was not named " Fay " until later that day , after initially being classified Subtropical Depression Seven . Its involvement with the upper @-@ level low and wide radius of maximum winds precluded designation as a fully tropical cyclone . 
 Immediately after forming , the storm moved northwestward around the periphery of a ridge of high pressure in the central Atlantic . As Fay moved away from its parent upper low , wind shear once again increased . The National Hurricane Center originally expected the cyclone to remain weak , but Fay began organizing more quickly than anticipated . Relatively strong winds sampled by a Hurricane Hunters aircraft necessitated a special off @-@ hour advisory to raise the cyclone 's intensity estimate . The storm started to acquire characteristics of a fully tropical system , and despite strong southerly wind shear preventing thunderstorms from developing near the center , Fay 's wind speeds steadily increased . Upper @-@ level air divergence from the nearby non @-@ tropical low may have contributed to the storm 's resilience . After convection became more symmetrical and the wind field contracted , Fay transitioned into a tropical storm at 06 : 00 UTC on October 11 . At the same time , the system turned toward the north around the central Atlantic ridge , soon gaining an easterly component to its movement . Fay remained heavily sheared , with the deepest convection still displaced from the center . 
 Forecasters originally believed Fay to have only briefly been a hurricane , but post @-@ season reanalysis revealed that the system had actually strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane by early on October 12 and maintained that strength for 12 hours . The upgrade was confirmed by buoy and land observations and weather radar data . At 08 : 10 UTC , the cyclone made landfall on Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) , the hurricane 's peak intensity . Fay was the first hurricane to make landfall on the island since Emily in 1987 . Its satellite presentation improved as a mid @-@ level eye feature formed , though the system remained lopsided . Fay then accelerated toward the east @-@ northeast ahead of a shortwave trough to the north , which also acted to further enhance shear in the area . The hurricane finally succumbed to the persistent wind shear when the low @-@ level center decoupled from the mid @-@ level low and became elongated . By the early morning hours of October 13 , Fay started transitioning into an extratropical cyclone as it entered a baroclinic environment and ingested colder , drier air . The circulation rapidly deteriorated ; consequently , the NHC issued its last operational advisory on the system at 21 : 00 UTC on October 12 . Early the following day , the storm degenerated into an open trough , ending its existence as a tropical cyclone . Shortly after , the system became reestablished as a frontal cyclone , which lost its definition over the northeastern Atlantic on October 15 . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 In advance of Fay , a tropical storm watch was issued on October 10 and upgraded to a tropical storm warning the next day . Additionally , in response to the storm 's unexpected strengthening , a hurricane watch was posted at 21 : 00 UTC on October 11 . All public schools on the island were closed for the storm . Bus and ferry services were canceled , and two cruise ships delayed their arrival into port to avoid the cyclone . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Fay produced unexpectedly strong winds across Bermuda , especially over western and southern parts of the territory . L.F. Wade International Airport reported 10 @-@ minute sustained winds of 61 mph ( 98 km / h ) , with gusts to 82 mph ( 132 km / h ) . Several stations at higher elevations recorded gusts in excess of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) , reaching 123 mph ( 198 km / h ) at Commissioner 's Point , about 150 ft ( 46 m ) above sea level . The most intense winds occurred in a relatively quick burst on the backside of the storm , within a large band of thunderstorms that affected the island a couple hours after the official landfall . Local radar imagery indicated possible tornadic activity coinciding with the period of most damaging winds , though this could also have been an artifact of radar velocity folding . A gauge at St. George 's recorded a 1 @.@ 78 ft ( 0 @.@ 54 m ) storm surge , though higher water rises may have affected the southern and western sides of the island . Rainfall unofficially amounted to 3 @.@ 70 in ( 94 mm ) as reported by a member of the public , and the airport recorded 1 @.@ 87 in ( 47 mm ) of rain , though the observing equipment was compromised in both cases . 
 The hurricane brought down thousands of trees and tree limbs , making streets impassable . The winds also toppled utility poles and inflicted roof damage on buildings . Over 27 @,@ 000 of the Bermuda Electric Light Company 's 36 @,@ 000 customers lost power at the height of the storm . Several roads , including Front Street in Hamilton , were flooded . Many boats up to 60 ft ( 18 m ) in length broke free from their moorings and were damaged or destroyed upon being driven aground . Hamilton city parks sustained considerable damage , and were closed due to safety hazards . The combined effects of Fay and Gonzalo forced the Botanical Gardens and Arboretum to stay closed until mid @-@ November , while cleanup of vegetation damage was underway . 
 Fay damaged the roof of the airport 's terminal building , causing the sprinkler system to malfunction and inundate parts of the structure with water ; the resultant flooding crippled computer systems crucial to processing passenger information . The airport 's radar was also impacted by the storm . In response to the damage , the airport was closed to all flights , though it quickly reopened to emergency diversions and non @-@ commercial flights . Including subsequent damage from Gonzalo , about $ 2 million was spent on airport repairs , and the storms were later cited as evidence of the need for a newer terminal in a more protected location . 
 Overall , the cyclone 's effects were greater than anticipated , with destruction at least partially facilitated by saturated soils from nearly 14 inches ( 360 mm ) of rain in August and above @-@ normal precipitation in September . Farmers reported that much of their autumn and winter crops had been lost , along with a few head of livestock . Fay and Gonzalo had a significant cumulative impact on Bermuda 's agriculture and fishing industries , contributing to a slight GDP decline . By about a week after Fay 's landfall , a local insurance company had received nearly 400 claims resulting from the storm , accounting for $ 3 @.@ 8 million in damage . However , with several insurers on the island , the actual damage total was likely much higher ; in a report to the World Meteorological Organization , the Bermuda Weather Service speculated that all insurance claims from Fay totaled " tens of millions of dollars " . Ten people suffered minor storm @-@ related injuries , but no fatalities were attributed to the storm . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Cleanup efforts after the storm were hastened as Hurricane Gonzalo approached from the south , amid concerns that strewn debris from Fay could become airborne and exacerbate future destruction . The unanticipated heavy damage from Fay prompted residents to prepare more thoroughly for Gonzalo , as evidenced by stores reporting an influx of customers purchasing emergency supplies . Two hundred Bermuda Regiment soldiers helped clear debris and began repairing structural damage . On October 13 , crews of soldiers put tarpaulins on 30 homes with roof damage , as well as distributing another 150 tarps to homeowners . 
 Early on October 16 , the Bermuda Electric Light Company ( BELCO ) switched its focus from service restoration after Fay to preparations for the onslaught of Gonzalo , leaving about 1 @,@ 500 households without power . The remaining affected customers were asked to refrain from calling in to report outages , as further repairs would not be attempted before Gonzalo 's passage unless " an easy fix can be made [ and ] resources are available " . With the same 1 @,@ 500 customers still without electricity by October 23 , BELCO tasked several crews with restoring the residual Fay outages on a priority basis , aided by Caribbean Electric Utility Services Corporation linemen who arrived in the aftermath of Gonzalo . Following the two hurricanes , service was not completely restored to the island until November 3 ; BELCO ultimately spent $ 2 @.@ 9 million on system repairs , having replaced 228 utility poles and over 4 mi ( 6 @.@ 5 km ) of wire . 
 = Harriet Bosse = 
 Harriet Sofie Bosse ( 19 February 1878 – 2 November 1961 ) was a Swedish – Norwegian actress . A celebrity in her own day , Bosse is today most commonly remembered as the third wife of the playwright August Strindberg . Bosse began her career in a minor company run by her forceful older sister Alma Fahlstrøm in Kristiania ( now Oslo , the capital of Norway ) . Having secured an engagement at the Royal Dramatic Theatre ( " Dramaten " ) , the main drama venue of Sweden 's capital Stockholm , Bosse caught the attention of Strindberg with her intelligent acting and exotic " oriental " appearance . 
 After a whirlwind courtship , which unfolds in detail in Strindberg 's letters and diary , Strindberg and Bosse were married in 1901 , when he was 52 and she 23 . Strindberg wrote a number of major roles for Bosse during their short and stormy relationship , especially in 1900 – 01 , a period of great creativity and productivity for him . Like his previous two marriages , the relationship failed as a result of Strindberg 's jealousy , which some biographers have characterized as paranoid . The spectrum of Strindberg 's feelings about Bosse , ranging from worship to rage , is reflected in the roles he wrote for her to play , or as portraits of her . Despite her real @-@ life role as muse to Strindberg , she remained an independent artist . 
 Bosse married Swedish actor Anders Gunnar <unk> in 1908 , and Swedish screen actor , director , and matinee idol Edvin Adolphson in 1927 . All three of her marriages ended in divorce after a few years , leaving her with a daughter by Strindberg and a son by Wingård . On retiring after a high @-@ profile acting career based in Stockholm , she returned to her roots in Oslo . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Bosse was born in Norway 's capital Kristiania , today called Oslo , as the thirteenth of fourteen children of Anne @-@ Marie and Johann Heinrich Bosse . Her German father was a publisher and bookseller , and his business led to the family 's alternating residence in Kristiania and Stockholm , the capital of Sweden . Bosse was to experience some confusion of national identity throughout her life , and to take the 512 kilometres ( 318 mi ) rail trip between the cities many times . A bold , independent child , she first made the journey alone when she was only six years old . 
 Two of Bosse 's older sisters , Alma ( 1863 – 1947 ) and Dagmar ( 1866 – 1954 ) , were already successful performers when Harriet was a small child . Inspired by these role models , Harriet began her acting career in a Norwegian touring company run by her sister Alma and Alma 's husband Johan Fahlstrøm ( 1867 – 1938 ) . Invited to play Juliet in Romeo and Juliet , the eighteen @-@ year @-@ old Harriet reported in a letter to her sister Inez that she had been paralysed by stage @-@ fright before the premiere , but had then taken delight in the performance , the curtain @-@ calls , and the way people stared at her in the street the next day . Alma was Harriet 's first and only — rather authoritarian — acting teacher . Their harmonious and sisterly teacher – pupil relationship became strained when Alma discovered that her husband Johan and Harriet were having an affair . Both Bosse parents were now dead , and Harriet , ordered by Alma to leave , used a modest legacy from her father to finance studies in Stockholm , Copenhagen , and Paris . 
 The Paris stage — at that time in dynamic conflict between traditional and experimental production styles — was inspirational for Bosse and convinced her that the low @-@ key realistic acting style in which she was training herself was the right choice . Returning to Scandinavia , she was hesitant as to whether she should carve out a career in Stockholm , with its greater opportunities , or in Kristiania , to which she had closer emotional ties . In spite of the disadvantage of speaking Swedish with a Norwegian accent , Bosse let herself be persuaded by her opera @-@ singer sister Dagmar to try her luck in Stockholm . She applied for a place at the Royal Dramatic Theatre ( " Dramaten " ) , the main drama venue of Stockholm , governed by the conservative tastes of King Oscar II and his personal advisors . After working hard at elocution lessons to improve her Swedish , which was Dramaten 's condition for employing her , Bosse was eventually to become famous on the Swedish stage for her beautiful speaking voice and precise articulation . Having trained her Swedish to a high level , she was engaged by Dramaten in 1899 , where the sensation of the day was the innovative play Gustaf Vasa by August Strindberg .

 Although Bosse was a successful professional , she is chiefly remembered as the third wife of Swedish dramatist August Strindberg ( 1849 – 1912 ) . Strindberg , an important influence on the development of modern drama , had become nationally known in the 1870s as an angry young socialist muckraker and had risen to fame with his satire on the Swedish establishment , The Red Room ( 1879 ) . In the 1890s , he had suffered a long and miserable psychotic interlude , known as the " Inferno Crisis " , and , emerging from this ordeal , he remained marked by it . He turned from naturalism to symbolism in his prolific literary output , and his convictions and interests at the turn of the 20th century focused less on politics and more on theosophy , mysticism , and the occult . When Bosse met him in 1899 – 1900 , he was , at age 51 , at the height of his creative powers , his name " red @-@ hot " on the stage . 
 Strindberg had the reputation of a misogynist , something which all of his wives stoutly denied . Bosse wrote in an unpublished statement which she left to her daughter with Strindberg , Anne @-@ Marie : " During the years I knew and was married to Strindberg I saw only a completely natural , kind , honorable , faithful man — a ' gentleman ' " . However , all of Strindberg 's marriages were blighted by his jealousy and a sensitivity which has sometimes been considered paranoid and delusional . 
 = = = Courtship = = = 
 Bosse later published Strindberg 's letters from their courtship and marriage . Incidents narrated in those letters and in Bosse 's own interspersed comments have been analysed at length by biographers and psychiatrists , and have become part of the " Strindberg legend " . Even before their first meeting , Bosse had been inspired by the newness and freshness of Strindberg 's pioneering plays ; an iconoclast and radical with two turbulent marriages already behind him presented an intriguing and irresistible mix to her . 
 Strindberg was susceptible to strong , independent career women , as well as to dainty , delicate @-@ looking young girls ; like his first and second wives — Siri von Essen and Frida Uhl — Bosse combined these qualities . He was entranced when he saw the dark , exotic @-@ looking , petite 22 @-@ year @-@ old Bosse ( who was often cast in sprite roles or what were conceptualized as " Oriental " roles ) play her first major part , an impish Puck in A Midsummer Night 's Dream . He immediately picked her out as a suitable actress for the part of The Lady in his coming play To Damascus , and invited her to his bachelor establishment to discuss the role . At this famous first meeting , Strindberg , according to Bosse 's narrative of the event , met her at the door all smiles and charm . Offering her wine , flowers , and beautifully arranged fruit , he shared with her his fascination with alchemy , showing her a golden brown mixture he told her was gold he had made . When she got up to leave , Bosse claims Strindberg asked for the feather in her hat to use for writing his plays . Bosse gave it to him , and he used this feather , with a steel nib insert , to write all his dramas during their marriage . It is now in the Strindberg Museum in Stockholm . 
 Strindberg wooed Bosse by sending her books about theosophy and the occult , by attempting to mould her mind , and by furthering her career . Throwing himself into writing plays with central parts he considered suitable for her , he tried to persuade her to act them , and the Dramaten management to cast her in them . Bosse asserts in her edition of the Letters that she tended to hang back , as did the management , being in agreement that she lacked the experience for major and complex roles . Strindberg , a power in the theatre , nevertheless often prevailed . The role of Eleonora in Easter ( 1901 ) , which intimidated Bosse by its sensitivity and delicacy , but which she finally undertook to play , turned out to be Bosse 's most successful and beloved role , and a turning @-@ point in Bosse 's and Strindberg 's relationship . They became engaged in March 1901 , during the rehearsals of Easter , in what in Bosse 's narrative may be the best @-@ known incident of the Strindberg legend . Bosse relates how she went to see Strindberg to ask him to give the part to a more experienced actress , but he assured her she would be perfect for it . " Then he placed his hands on my shoulders , looked at me long and ardently , and asked : ' Would you like to have a little child with me , Miss Bosse ? ' I made a curtsey and answered , as though hypnotized : ' Yes , thank you ! ' — and we were engaged . " 
 = = = Marriage and divorce = = = 
 Bosse and Strindberg were married on 6 May 1901 . Strindberg insisted that Bosse bring none of her possessions to the home he had furnished for her , creating a " setting in which to nurture and dominate her " . In this setting , his taste in interior decoration was revealed to be <unk> and old @-@ fashioned , with pedestals , <unk> , and dining @-@ room furniture in hideous imitation of German renaissance , to Bosse 's modern judgment . 
 Striving towards the life beyond , Strindberg explained , he could permit nothing in the apartment that would lead the thoughts towards the earthly and material . In her comments in the Letters , Bosse described with loyalty and affection Strindberg 's protectiveness and his efforts to bring his young wife with him along his own spiritual paths ; nevertheless , she chafed under these efforts , pointing out that she herself , at 22 , was not even remotely finished with this world . Increasingly agoraphobic , Strindberg attempted to overcome his anxieties and allow his young wife the summer excursions she longed for . He planned sunny drives in hired <unk> , but often the mystical " Powers " which governed him intervened . A crisis came as early as June 1901 , when Strindberg arranged , and then at the last moment called off , a honeymoon trip to Germany and Switzerland . Bosse wrote in the Letters that she had nothing to do but stay at home and choke down the tears while Strindberg attempted consolation by giving her a Baedeker " to read a trip in " . 
 The cancelled journey was the beginning of the end . A crying , defiant Bosse went off by herself to the seaside resort Hornbæk in Denmark , a much shorter trip , but to her senses , a delightfully refreshing one . There , she was soon followed by Strindberg 's letters , full of agonized remorse at having given her pain , and then by Strindberg himself , <unk> himself to bear the social life Bosse relished . However , the relationship quickly foundered on jealousy and suspicion , as when Strindberg struck a photographer over the head with his stick , unable to endure any attention to Bosse . In August , when Bosse discovered that she was pregnant , even Strindberg 's delight ( he was a fond parent of the four children of his previous marriages ) could not save a marriage full of distrust and accusation . This was illustrated in Strindberg 's increasingly frantic letters to Bosse When their daughter Anne @-@ Marie was born on 25 March 1902 , they were already living apart . " For the sake of us both it is best that I do not return " , wrote Bosse in a letter to Strindberg . " A continuation of life together with suspicion of every word , every act of mine , would be the end of me . " At her insistence , Strindberg began divorce proceedings . 
 = = = Strindberg 's roles for Bosse = = = 
 The relationship of Strindberg and Bosse was highly dramatic . Strindberg would lurch back and forth from adoration of Bosse as the <unk> of his creativity ( " lovely , amiable , and kind " ) to a wild jealousy ( calling her " a small , nasty woman " , " evil " , " stupid " , " black " , " arrogant " , " venomous " , and " whore " ) . His letters show that Bosse inspired several important characters in his plays , especially during the course of 1901 , and that he manipulated her by promising to pull strings so that she could play them . During the brief , intense , creative 1901 period , the roles Strindberg wrote as artistic vehicles for Bosse , or that were based on their relationship , reflect this combination of adoration and " suspicion of every word , every act " . Carla Waal counts eight minor and six major roles written for Bosse to act , or as portraits of her , several of them classics of Western theatre history . The major roles enumerated by Waal are The Lady in To Damascus ( 1900 ; mainly already written when Bosse and Strindberg met , but used between them to enhance their intimacy ) ; Eleonora in Easter ( 1901 ; modelled on Strindberg 's sister Elisabeth , but intended for Bosse to star in ) ; Henriette in Crimes and Crimes ( 1901 ) ; Swan White in Swan White ( 1901 ) ; Christina in Queen Christina ( 1901 ) ; and Indra 's daughter in A Dream Play ( 1902 ) . The years refer to dates of publication ; Bosse never played in Swan White , even though Strindberg kept proposing it , and though she was many years later to describe this play as Strindberg 's wedding present to her . 
 Strindberg claimed that Queen Christina was an " explanation " of Bosse 's character as being that of an actress in real life , flirtatious and deceitful . In his influential Strindberg biography , <unk> describes this play as a synopsis of the entire course of the Bosse – Strindberg marriage . He sees the courtiers as representing various stages of Strindberg 's own emotions : Tott , in the first glow of love ; de la Gardie , betrayed but loyal ; Oxenstierna , who has rejected her . Each of the three men has words to speak which Strindberg himself had spoken to Bosse . 
 A Dream Play is positioned at the median of Strindberg 's series of portrayals of his own marriage , the Bosse role imbued with both light and darkness . With its associative dream structure , this play is a milestone of modernist drama , described by Strindberg as a lawless reflection of The Dreamer 's ( Strindberg 's ) consciousness , limited only by his imagination which " spins and weaves new patterns … on an insignificant basis of reality " . Agnes , played by and representing Bosse , is the daughter of the Vedic god Indra , descending to earth to observe human life and bring its disappointments to the attention of her divine father . The " Oriental " aspect of the play is based on Bosse 's dark , exotic looks . Yet she is also drawn into mere humanity and into a claustrophobic marriage to The Lawyer , one of the versions of The Dreamer and , thereby , of Strindberg . Shut up indoors by a possessive husband , Agnes can not breathe ; she despondently watches the servant working to exclude light and air from the house by pasting insulating strips of paper along the windows ' edges . <unk> , the " insignificant basis of reality " of Agnes ' marriage to The Lawyer is the frustration of the newly married Bosse , yearning for fresh air , sunshine , and travel but <unk> off with a Baedeker . 
 = = Independence = = 
 Both before and after the divorce from Strindberg , Bosse was a Stockholm celebrity in her own right . Her independence and self @-@ supporting status gained her a reputation for being strong @-@ willed and opinionated , insisting on , and receiving , high pay and significant roles . She left Dramaten with its conventional repertoire and began working at Albert Ranft 's Swedish Theatre , where she and the skillful but more modest actor ( Anders ) Gunnar Wingård ( 1878 – 1912 ) formed a popular co @-@ star team . She travelled frequently , particularly for guest performances in Helsinki , leaving little Anne @-@ Marie with Strindberg , a competent and affectionate father . In 1907 , Bosse made theatrical history as Indra 's daughter in Strindberg 's epoch @-@ making Dream Play . She and Strindberg met weekly for dinner at his house , and remained lovers until she severed connections in preparation for her marriage with Gunnar Wingård in 1908 . In 1909 the <unk> had a son , Bo . This marriage was also brief , ending in divorce in 1912 . According to rumour , the cause of the divorce was Wingård 's infidelity . However , Strindberg also heard gossip that Wingård 's large debts threatened Bosse 's finances . 
 In 1911 , a divorced woman with two children to care for and support , Bosse returned to Dramaten . Strindberg was at that time fatally ill with cancer ; he died on 14 May 1912 . 1912 was altogether a year of death and disaster for the Bosse and Strindberg families : Alma Fahlstrøm 's son Arne went down with the Titanic on 15 April ; Strindberg 's first wife Siri von Essen died later the same month ; von Essen 's and Strindberg 's daughter Greta , a promising young actress , was killed in a train crash in June ; and Bosse 's divorced husband Gunnar Wingård shot himself on 7 October . Strindberg 's funeral was a national event . Gunnar Wingård , a popular and charming actor , was also the subject of public grief . Throughout these shattering events , which left both her children fatherless , Bosse kept up her busy schedule , apart from a few days off , distraught and grief @-@ stricken , after Wingård 's suicide . For months after it , she received anonymous letters and threatening phone @-@ calls , blaming her for Wingård 's depression and death . 
 Bosse 's third marriage , 1927 – 32 , was to Edvin Adolphson ( 1893 – 1979 ) , fifteen years her junior . Adolphson had abandoned his stage career in order to become instead a film director and one of the best @-@ known Swedish film actors , a ruggedly handsome matinée idol whose screen persona Nils Beyer referred to as a combination of " apache , gangster and gigolo " . 
 Bosse made two films , ambitiously shot and directed and based on novels by well @-@ known writers . The artistic achievement of Sons of Ingmar ( 1919 ) has been highly praised . Directed by and co @-@ starring Victor Sjöström , it was based on a novel by Swedish Nobel Prize winner Selma Lagerlöf ; many years later , Ingmar Bergman referred to Sons of Ingmar as a " magnificent , remarkable film " and acknowledged his own debt to Sjöström . Bosse , who played the female lead Brita , called Sons of Ingmar " the only worthwhile Swedish film I was involved in . " However , the film failed to give her career the kind of fresh start that the Swedish film industry had given Edvin Adolphson , and it was seventeen years before she made another film . This was <unk> <unk> and I ( 1936 ) , her only talkie , based on Fritiof Nilsson <unk> 's popular first novel with the same title and directed by Gösta Rodin . <unk> <unk> was a successful , though more lightweight , production with a smaller Bosse role ( " <unk> " ) . 
 = = Retirement = = 
 After many years of ambitious and successful free @-@ lance acting , Bosse found her options narrowing in the 1930s . The Great Depression brought her economic hardship , and , even though she looked younger than her age , most important women 's roles were out of her age range . Her technique was still often praised , but also sometimes perceived as old @-@ fashioned and mannered , in comparison with the more ensemble @-@ oriented style of the times . Finding herself unneeded by any Swedish repertory theatre , she only managed to return as a member of Dramaten by means of skillful persuasion and pointed reminders of her long history there . A humble employee at a humble salary , she played only fifteen roles , all minor , during her last ten years at Dramaten , 1933 – 43 . 
 Retiring from the stage during World War II , Bosse considered moving back to Norway 's capital Oslo , the home of her childhood and youth . Both her children had settled there . The move was delayed for ten years , during which she travelled whenever possible , and when it took place in 1955 , she perceived it to be a mistake . Her brother Ewald 's death in 1956 left her the only survivor of the fourteen children of Anne @-@ Marie and Johann Heinrich Bosse . " How I long desperately for Stockholm " , she wrote to a friend in 1958 . " My whole life is there . " She became chronically melancholy , enduring failing health and bitter memories of the final phase of her career at Dramaten . 
 Bosse always guarded her privacy , so much so that the memoir she wrote of her life with Strindberg was deemed to be too <unk> discreet to be publishable . 
 = Kalpavriksha = 
 Kalpavriksha ( Devanagari : कल ् <unk> ् <unk> ) , also known as <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , is a wish @-@ fulfilling divine tree in Hindu mythology . It is mentioned in Sanskrit literature from the earliest sources . It is also a popular theme in Jain cosmology and Buddhism . Sage Durvasa and Adi Shankaracharya , meditated under the Kalpavriksha . The birth of Ashokasundari , the daughter of Shiva and Parvati , is attributed to the Kalpavriksha tree . Another daughter <unk> was also gifted to Kalpavriksha for safekeeping . 
 The Kalpavriksha originated during the Samudra manthan or " churning of the ocean of milk " along with the Kamadhenu , the divine cow providing for all needs . The king of the gods , Indra , returned with this tree to his paradise . 
 Kalpavriksha is also identified with many trees such as Parijata ( Erythrina variegata ) , Ficus benghalensis , coconut tree ( Cocos nucifera ) , Madhuca longifolia , Prosopis <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and mulberry tree ( Morus nigra tree ) . The tree is also extolled in iconography and literature .

 Kalpavriksha , the tree of life , also meaning " World Tree " finds mention in the Vedic scriptures . In the earliest account of the Samudra manthan or " churning of the ocean of milk " Kalpavriksha emerged from the primal waters during the ocean churning process along with Kamadhenu , the divine cow that bestows all needs . The tree is also said to be the Milky way or the birthplace of the stars Sirius . The king of the gods , Indra returned with this Kalpavriksha to his abode , the paradise and planted it there . Tree also finds mention in the Sanskrit text <unk> , part of Shilpa <unk> myth says that Kalpavriksha was located on earth and was transported to Indra 's abode after people started misusing it by wishing evil and wrong things . In Indra 's " Devaloka " it is said that there are five Kalpavrikshas , which are called Mandana , Parijata , Santana , Kalpavriksha and <unk> , all of which fulfill various wishes . Kalpavriksha , in particular , is said to be planted at Mt . Meru peak in the middle of Indra 's five paradise gardens . It is on account of these wish @-@ granting trees that the asuras waged a perpetual war with the devas as the heavenly gods who exclusively benefited freely from the " divine flowers and fruits " from the Kalpavriksha , whereas the demigods lived comparatively in penury at the lower part of its " trunk and roots " . The Parijata is often identified with its terrestrial counterpart , the Indian coral tree ( <unk> indica ) , but is most often depicted like a magnolia or frangipani ( Sanskrit : <unk> ) tree . It is described as having roots made of gold , a silver midriff , <unk> boughs , coral leaves , pearl flower , gemstone buds , and diamond fruit . It is also said that Ashokasundari was created from a Kalpavriksha tree to provide relief to Parvati from her loneliness . 
 In Hindu mythology Shiva and Parvati after much painful discussions while parting with their daughter <unk> gave her away to the divine Kalpavriksha for safe keeping when the demon Andhakasura waged war . Parvati requested Kalpavriksha to bring up her daughter with " safety , wisdom , health and happiness , " and to make her Vana Devi , the protector of forests .

 Kalpavrikshas are wish @-@ granting trees which fulfill the desires of people in initial stages of worldly cycle as per Jain Cosmology . In initial times children are born in pairs ( boy and girl ) and don 't do any karma . There are 10 Kalpavrikshas which grant 10 distinct wishes such as an abode to reside , garments , utensils , nourishment including fruits and sweets , pleasant music , ornaments , fragrant flowers , shining lamps and a radiant light at night . 
 According to Jain cosmology , in the three Aras ( unequal periods ) of the descending arc ( <unk> ) , Kalpavrikshas provided all that was needed , but towards the end of the third ara , the yield from them diminished . Eight types of these trees are described in some texts , each of which provided different objects . Thus from the " <unk> tree " delicious and nutritious drinks could be obtained ; from the " <unk> " , delicious food ; from " <unk> " , light more radiant than the sun and the moon ; while from " <unk> " came indoor light . Other trees provided homes , musical devices , table ware , fine garments , wreaths and scents .

 = Coat of arms of Basque Country ( autonomous community ) = 
 The current Basque coat of arms ( Spanish : Escudo del País Vasco , Basque : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) is the official coat of arms of the Basque Country , Autonomous community of Spain . It consists of a party per cross representing the three historical territories of Álava , Gipuzkoa and Biscay , as well as a fourth , void quarter . The arms are ringed by a regal wreath of oak leaves , symbolic of the <unk> <unk> . The fourth quarter constituted since the late 19th century the linked chains of Navarre ; however , following a legal suit by the Navarre Government claiming that the usage of the arms of a region on the flag of another was illegal , the Constitutional Court of Spain ordered the removal of the chains of Navarre in a judgement of 1986 . 
 = = Origin = = 
 After the end of home rule in 1839 @-@ 1841 , the Basque governments started a mutual approach out of common concerns in face of their exposure to Spanish centralism . The movement intensified after 1866 , and a motto was coined , the " <unk> bat " , ' the four make one ' , echoing the " <unk> bat " of the Royal Basque Company , which in turn crystallized in a coat of arms including the four historic Basque districts in Spain ( called variously the Sister Provinces , the Chartered Territories , the Basque Country , the Basque @-@ Navarrese Country , etc . ) , to represent their common bonds , as claimed during that period by the chartered provincial governments , or the 1931 draft Statute of the Basque Country . 
 In 1936 , the Provisional Government of Euzkadi , presided over by the first president , José Antonio Aguirre , adopted the shield with the arms of the three provinces of Álava , Gipuzkoa , Biscay comprised in the 1936 Statute ( the Basque Provinces , as established in the 1833 administrative design ) , and Navarre . The president of the government affirmed in the preamble to the Decree of 19 October 1936 , and thereby approved , the emblem and flag that was to be used by the Basque Country . Thus the shield of the Government of Euzkadi contained the arms of Álava , Gipuzkoa , Biscay and Navarre in a single blazon of four quarters surrounded by a crown of oak leaves . The Provisional Government of Euzkadi stated that " the flag must be that which gathers Basque unity and which the use , ever more frequent in the Basque lands , has sanctioned as such symbol of their unity . " 
 As an official shield , like the 1936 Basque Autonomous Community , disappeared after the pro @-@ Franco victory in the Spanish Civil War , but the coat of arms continued in unofficial use , it was even used in its flag by the rightist pro @-@ rebel newspaper from Donostia El Diario Vasco during wartime ( data for 2 May 1937 ) . On 2 November 1978 , the Consejo General del País Vasco ( General Council of the Basque Country ) , restored the republican shield , albeit modified as follows : 
 The Álava quarter lost the motto " En <unk> de la <unk> contra <unk> " and both the designs of the castle and of the arm with sword were changed . The castle is now on top of a grey rock and the arm and sword are light blue in colour . 
 In the Biscay quarter , the wolves of the arms of the Haro family were suppressed in 1986 and the field changed from gules to argent , the bordure from argent to gold , the crosses from <unk> to gules , and the ground ( <unk> ) from <unk> to maroon . 
 In the Gipuzkoa quarter , the field changed from argent to gold , and the ground ( <unk> ) was removed , leaving only the trees and the waves . 
 The fourth quarter once contained the linked chains of Navarre ; however , following a legal suit by the Navarre government claiming that the usage of the arms of a region on the flag of another was illegal , the Constitutional Court of Spain forced the Basque government to remove the chains of Navarre , leaving the red background . 
 In 1991 the Basque Government standardised the colours used in the shield . 
 Basque nationalists , but not only , have used an unofficially recognised Basque coat of arms , the <unk> Bat . It has been argued that it differs from the original one by being divided into six squares and by including the coat of arms of the Basque regions in France . The motto " <unk> bat " was coined by Antoine @-@ Thomson d 'Abbadie in the late 19th century .

 = Olav Meisdalshagen = 
 Olav Meisdalshagen ( 17 March 1903 – 21 November 1959 ) was a Norwegian politician for the Labour Party best known for serving as the Norwegian Minister of Finance from December 1947 to November 1951 and as the Norwegian Minister of Agriculture from January 1955 to May 1956 . He was also a Member of Parliament for a long time , being elected for the first time in parliamentary election of 1936 and serving until his death , except for the period between 1940 and 1945 when the Parliament of Norway was de facto defunct due to the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany . His death in 1959 came halfway through his fifth term in Parliament , and shortly after a parliamentary speech . 
 A jurist by profession , Meisdalshagen came from a humble family background , growing up at a former crofter 's farm in rural Nord @-@ Aurdal , and losing his father in the 1920s . After studying he moved back to Nord @-@ Aurdal , worked as an attorney and built the Labour Party organization in the region . The background formed him in that his main political goal was to improve the economy of dwellers in rural farming districts . He was a proponent of economic regulation , which marked his period as Minister of Finance . However , his period was also marked by the dominance of Erik Brofoss and the Ministry of Trade in deciding the country 's overall financial policy . When Trygve Bratteli succeeded Meisdalshagen as Minister of Finance , the ministry regained its dominance , but also set out on a gradual deregulation . This , in addition to Meisdalshagen 's discontent with increased <unk> on defence , made him an oppositional figure within the Labour Party . He did return briefly to cabinet as Minister of Agriculture , and also cooperated with the government through the position as chairman of Norges <unk> <unk> , a national association of consumer co @-@ operatives . However his oppositional tendencies grew stronger in his later life . He was a part of the " Easter Uprising " in 1958 , and in 1958 and 1959 there were rumours of Meisdalshagen worked behind the scene to facilitate a change of personnel — and policy — in the Labour Party . His death came in this period .

 Meisdalshagen was born on 17 March 1903 in Nord @-@ Aurdal as a son of <unk> and joiner Ole Meisdalshagen and Marit Myren . The family lived at the former crofter 's farm Hagen in <unk> . Meisdalshagen attended Valdres Folk High School from 1920 to 1921 , and took secondary education at Voss between 1921 and 1925 with financial support from his brothers ; his father died in 1924 . Meisdalshagen took the examen artium in 1925 , and enrolled in law studies at the Royal Frederick University ( now : University of Oslo ) . While studying he was involved in the students ' branch of Noregs <unk> . He came also under the influence of the revolutionary group Mot Dag , though he was never a member . He graduated from university with a cand.jur. degree in 1932 . 
 = = = Pre @-@ war political career = = = 
 Meisdalshagen became involved in politics while attending school in Voss , and chaired the Labour Party chapter in Nord @-@ Aurdal from 1927 to 1940 . He also chaired the local chapters of Valdres , from 1930 to 1932 , and Fagernes , from 1931 to 1934 . From 1931 to 1940 he was a board member of the Labour Party county chapter . He was elected as a member of Nord @-@ Aurdal municipal council in 1931 , and was re @-@ elected to serve until 1940 . From 1934 he served in the council 's executive committee . He spent his professional life in Fagernes , where he had opened an attorney 's office in 1933 . He also headed the municipal board of arbitration in debt matters , from 1935 to 1940 . This had a significant influence on his further political career , in that he sought to improve the economy of rural Norwegian districts , especially through a centralized increase of farmers ' income . He also favoured ensuring a low interest , preferably at 2 @,@ 5 % . 
 During the term 1934 – 1936 he served as a deputy representative to the Parliament of Norway from the constituency Oppland ; in the election of 1936 , he was elected to a regular seat in the parliament . He was the youngest member of Parliament at the time . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 As the Parliament amended the Constitution in 1938 to introduce four @-@ year terms instead of three @-@ year terms , the representatives elected in 1936 were still active in 1940 . On 9 April that year , Norway was invaded and occupied by Germany as a part of World War II . With the German invasion , a radio broadcast coup d 'état by Vidkun Quisling followed , and German diplomat Curt Bräuer was sent to Norway to demand the abdication of the Norwegian King Haakon VII and Nygaardsvold 's Cabinet . This was initially refused , as the Parliament , meeting at Elverum on 9 April , issued the Elverum Authorization where it empowered the King and government to continue representing Norway . Norway and Germany was at war that time , and fighting continued for some months . However , when mainland Norway capitulated on 10 June 1940 , new negotiations with Nazi Germany were opened , resulting in a request being submitted from the Presidium of the Parliament of Norway to the now @-@ exiled King and government to abdicate . The case had been controversial , splitting the parliamentary group of the Labour Party . Olav Meisdalshagen agreed that the King should abdicate , as did the majority of the parliamentary group . When the King broadcast his refusal to abdicate via BBC Radio on 8 July 1940 , this became famous as " The King 's No " . 
 Germany gradually tightened the grip of Norwegian society , and the Parliament became defunct during the rest of the German occupation of Norway . In 1941 Meisdalshagen became a prominent figure in the Norwegian resistance movement against German rule , in the position of district leader of Milorg in Valdres . In 1944 he left Norway and fled to Sweden , where he was a secretary at <unk> in Stockholm until 1945 . Briefly in 1945 he served as an advisor in London for the coordination of Milorg cells .

 In the first parliamentary election after the war , in 1945 , Meisdalshagen was re @-@ elected for a second term in Parliament . It was not clear that he would be nominated for the ballot , as this was not at all usual for those Labour Party members who in the summer of 1940 had agreed to the King 's abdication . However , Meisdalshagen 's service in Milorg probably tipped the scales in his favour . He was a member of the Standing Committee on Finance and Customs and secretary of the Preparatory Credentials Committee , and also became a member of the Standing Committee on Justice in December 1946 . Meisdalshagen was also board chairman of the Norwegian State Housing Bank from 1946 to 1953 . 
 = = = Minister of Finance = = = 
 Midway through his four @-@ year term , Meisdalshagen was appointed Minister of Finance in Gerhardsen 's Second Cabinet . He served from 6 December 1947 to 19 November 1951 , when Torp 's Cabinet was formed . Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen and former party secretary Martin Tranmæl were the architects behind his appointment . Ultimately , Meisdalshagen 's opposition to the Labour Party 's foreign and defence policy in general , and extraordinary monetary grants for defence measures specifically , was cited as the reason for his resignation from the cabinet , and even for the entire cabinet shift . During his period as minister , Meisdalshagen 's parliamentary seat was occupied by Gunnar <unk> until June 1948 and then by Thorvald <unk> . He was succeeded as Minister of Finance by Trygve Bratteli ; other candidates were discussed but rejected , including Meisdalshagen 's old acquaintance Klaus <unk> . 
 As a politician , Meisdalshagen has been noted as being an opposite figure to his predecessor as Minister of Finance , Erik Brofoss . Still , earlier in 1947 he had argued strongly in favour of " Lex Brofoss " , the law proposed by Brofoss which meant that the elected politicians gave temporary authority to the Norwegian Price Directorate to regulate the economy . Meisdalshagen even stated that a majority in Parliament probably agreed that such a law should have permanent effect , not be renewed from time to time . Historian Einar Lie has stated that Brofoss left Meisdalshagen in charge of the price policy with a " very easy heart " . On the other hand , the new Ministry of Trade , where Brofoss was appointed as Minister , clearly became more important than the Ministry of Finance in this period . The higher importance of the Ministry of Trade ended after 1951 , and Meisdalshagen 's period was thus an exception in the history of the Ministry of Finance . Meisdalshagen was ultimately criticized by Brofoss for " lack of economical insight " , and he also ran afoul with Central Bank of Norway Governor Gunnar Jahn . 
 According to Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen , it took long to persuade Meisdalshagen to even take the post as Minister of Finance , and he was more interested in agro @-@ economical questions than traditional planning of the economy . It was even said that Gerhardsen 's Cabinet had an interest in luring Meisdalshagen away from the Parliament , where he had driven through significant increases in farmer 's income , threatening the overall balance and planning of the state finances . In fact the income from farming , measured in the amount of money earned per <unk> , was doubled between the war 's end in 1945 and 1950 , when the Main Agreement for Agriculture , <unk> for <unk> , was introduced . It regulated future price negotiations , and institutionalized the negotiating partners : the state on one side of the table , the Norwegian Agrarian Association and the Norwegian Farmers and Smallholders Union on the other . 
 During Meisdalshagen 's time the lines between various parts of government were somewhat blurred . When the state budget was presented by the cabinet , and subsequently treated by the standing committees of the Parliament , committee members would contact the Ministry of Finance directly to ask whether a proposed budgetary change was feasible ( after Meisdalshagen 's resignation this practice was altered , in that the contact was initiated by the Labour Party committee fraction , not by the committee as a whole ) . Meisdalshagen also became known for nontraditional arrangements when it came to the Ministry 's bureaucrats : assistant secretary Egil Lothe , who had a " very good relationship " with Meisdalshagen , doubled as assistant secretary and State Secretary from 1948 until Meisdalshagen 's resignation in 1951 . Such a double role , where a person was both bureaucrat and politician at the same time , was very uncommon , probably unique . Lothe was not formally appointed , either , and thus does not appear on historical lists of state secretaries . According to Einar Lie , there was no clear division of tasks between Meisdalshagen and Lothe when it came to the Ministry 's daily work . In addition to Lothe , the consultant Karl Trasti , another friend of Meisdalshagen , had influence in this period , especially in budgetary questions . 
 = = = Return to Parliament = = = 
 Since 1913 , parliamentarians who are appointed to the cabinet may return to Parliament later , provided that the four @-@ year term has not expired . After leaving as Minister of Finance , Meisdalshagen returned to Parliament as a member of the Standing Committee on Finance and Customs , which he even chaired from January 1952 to January 1953 . While being Minister of Finance , Meisdalshagen had been re @-@ elected on the Labour Party parliamentary ticket in 1949 , and was elected for a fourth time in 1953 . He was still a member of the Standing Committee on Finance and Customs . On 22 January 1955 the Gerhardsen 's Third Cabinet was formed , and Meisdalshagen served as Minister of Agriculture until 14 May 1956 . During this period his parliamentary seat was occupied by Per <unk> . Meisdalshagen then returned to Parliament , this time as a member of the now @-@ defunct Standing Committee on Agriculture . He was elected for a fifth time in 1957 . This time , he became a member of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence as well as the Enlarged Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence . From 1957 to 1959 he was also a member of the Labour Party 's central committee ( <unk> ) . 
 Meisdalshagen was also chairman of the Norges <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) from 1952 to his death . <unk> was the national association of consumer co @-@ operatives . This way , he represented trade interests in meetings with the government , at the same time as being a parliament member . 
 = = = Internal opposition = = = 
 Meisdalshagen was regarded as an internal opponent of the Labour Party 's foreign affairs and defence policy . His obituarist in Verdens Gang writes that he was " more controversial in his own party than outside of it " . This tendency had surfaced already in the 1940s , when he very reluctantly accepted the Norwegian signing of the North Atlantic Treaty . Meisdalshagen remained skeptic to a non @-@ neutral foreign policy in the 1950s , and in February 1951 a conflict with Minister of Defence Jens Chr . Hauge arose . Meisdalshagen formally dissented against a proposal to grant an extra NOK 250 million to the Norwegian Armed Forces for the years 1951 and 1952 , and he became furious when he entered a budgetary debate without being notified of a certain press release , issued by Jens Chr . Hauge , where another grant of NOK 125 million was declared . According to Haakon Lie , Meisdalshagen influenced persons in the newspaper Oppland Arbeiderblad to write and print an editorial titled La Hauge gå ( " Let Hauge Go " ) . Meisdalshagen was a member of the board of Oppland Arbeiderblad from 1945 to 1957 , and had spent some time working there before the war . 
 Meisdalshagen was also discontented with the deregulation policy to which the Labour Party gradually adhered in the 1950s . Trygve Bratteli , on the other hand , was viewed as a proponent of gradual deregulation . In November 1958 there were rumours that Meisdalshagen would return to the cabinet , probably as Minister of Transport of Communications . Some believed that Meisdalshagen worked together with Karl Trasti to have Trygve Bratteli removed from the cabinet ; Trasti would succeed Bratteli as Minister of Finance , according to the rumour , with was told to Bratteli by Meisdalshagen 's predecessor as Minister of Agriculture , Rasmus <unk> . At the time Karl Trasti was a member of the ad @-@ hoc Paulson Committee , which worked with questions regarding the Ministry of Finance 's policy . It was thought that some of the committee 's policy proposals could be undesirable to Bratteli , and thereby compromise his minister position . This information was given to Trygve Bratteli from parliamentary secretary Haakon Bingen in January 1959 . Binge had heard it from Egil Lothe , at the time a deputy under @-@ secretary of state in the Ministry of Finance . A friend of Meisdalshagen , Lothe was thereby tied to the alleged intriguers . Jens Haugland noted the scheme of Trasti and Meisdalshagen in his diary , and that this caused Bratteli to keep himself " in the background " . This was a part of a broader schism in the party , where Meisdalshagen was the " strongest man in the group " consisting of parliamentarians who deviated in questions of foreign policy : Finn Moe , Trygve Bull , Hans <unk> , Sverre <unk> and Meisdalshagen . Meisdalshagen had been a supporter of the " Easter Uprising " of 1958 , a voicing of dissent within the Labour Party , where the socialist students ' association gained the signatures of Labour MPs on a NATO @-@ critical resolution . In Meisdalshagen 's obituary , he was likened to Olav <unk> , another NATO @-@ critical Labour politician . 
 Halfway through his fifth term in Parliament , on 21 November 1959 , Meisdalshagen suffered from a sudden indisposition after a parliamentary speech . He was hospitalized , but died later that same day . The cause of death was intracranial hemorrhage . In Parliament he was replaced by Per <unk> , who advanced from deputy to regular representative . He was <unk> in 1982 by Nils Oddvar <unk> .

 " Love Don 't Live Here Anymore " is a song written by Miles Gregory and originally recorded by Rose Royce . It was produced by former Motown songwriter and producer Norman Whitfield for the Whitfield Records . Lead vocals were sung by Gwen Dickey and the song was released as the second single from their third studio album Rose Royce III : Strikes Again ! The song was developed as a result of producer Whitfield 's interest to work with Paul Buckmaster , the British arranger and composer . Together they asked songwriter Miles Gregory to write a song for them . Gregory was undergoing medications for his drug overuse problem , and this situation and his deteriorating physical health became the inspiration behind the song . " Love Don 't Live Here Anymore " incorporated the use of the Electronic LinnDrum machine , and was one of the first songs to effectively use the sound reverbs of the instrument . The song was mainly recorded at music contractor Gene Bianco 's house , where Dickey was present during the recording . 
 After its release , the song was critically appreciated , but was only moderately successful commercially . It reached a peak of 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 and five on the Hot Black Singles chart . Its highest position was in the United Kingdom , where it reached two . " Love Don 't Live Here Anymore " has been covered by a number of artists , including Madonna , Morrissey – Mullen and Faith Evans . Madonna 's version was included in her second studio album Like a Virgin ( 1984 ) , and it was the idea of Michael Ostin , the head of the A & R department of Warner Bros. Records , that Madonna record a cover version of the song to include in the album . It was further included in her 1995 ballad compilation album Something to Remember , in a remixed form . 
 The original and the remixed version of the Madonna song differs in the usage of more classical instruments in the latter . The 1995 version also received a number of club remix treatments . Critics were not impressed with the version present in Like a Virgin , calling it " awful " , while they warmed to the version present in Something to Remember . However , it was a commercial disappointment , reaching a peak of only 78 on the Billboard Hot 100 . It was promoted by a music video shot by Jean @-@ Baptiste Mondino , which portrayed Madonna in an empty suite of an abandoned hotel , and was shot in a single take .

 Producer Norman Whitfield had always wanted to work with Paul Buckmaster , the British arranger and composer . One day he called Buckmaster and invited him to work on some recordings he had finished . After meeting , they decided to contact songwriter Miles Gregory to use one of his songs for Whitfield 's record group Rose Royce . Buckmaster found that Gregory was under medication from overuse of drugs and " was in considerable discomfort , if not in outright pain . He didn 't write a song and dance about his pain , but I remember him sitting at the piano and wincing . So before jumping on the thing that Miles was merely indulging himself and writing , one has to remember that the guy was in a lot of pain . " Nevertheless , Whitfield and Buckmaster encouraged Gregory to write the song and the result was " Love Don 't Live Here Anymore " , inspired by Gregory 's own situation and his deteriorating physical health . 
 " Love Don 't Live Here Anymore " incorporated the use of the Electronic LinnDrum machine , and was one of the first songs to effectively use the sound reverbs of the instrument . LinnDrum had been used sparingly in their previous single " Do Your Dance " , but in " Love Don 't Live Here Anymore " its use was more spontaneous , which Dave Thompson , author of Funk noted as if " it virtually duetted with Dickey , creating one of the most distinctive records of the year — and one of the most imitated of the age . " The song was mainly recorded at music contractor Gene Bianco 's house , where Rose Royce lead singer Gwen Dickey was present during the recording . Buckmaster recalled : " I was over at [ Gene 's ] place almost every day with Norman , and some days I stayed away to write , or to mix the music . Gene had given me the keys to his apartment , and also let me use the piano to record the song . I didn 't want to work on at Miles ' because his piano was falling to bits . "

 Kenny Hill from The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune said that the song " was a lasting impression of Rose Royce 's brilliance as a group " and it proved that disco and R & B soul music was not dead .

" Bob <unk> from Post @-@ Tribune listed " Love Don 't Live Here Anymore " as Rose Royce 's greatest song . Jim Mortimer from Deseret News felt that " Love Don 't Live Here Anymore " was a perfect example of how gospel and soul music can be clubbed together and complimented producer Buckmaster . Shannon Kingly from Los Angeles Daily News felt that " Love Don 't Live Here Anymore " is " a tad bit overrated , and is full of shouting . " " Love Don 't Live Here Anymore " debuted at 91 on the Billboard Hot 100 , and made a slow climb , ultimately reaching a peak of 32 . It was more successful on the Hot Black Singles chart , where it reached five , and stayed there for four weeks . In Canada , the song debuted at 100 on the RPM Singles Chart on December 23 , 1978 . The song began a slow climb , and after nine weeks reached a peak of 41 on the chart . It was present for a total of 12 weeks on the chart . In the United Kingdom , " Love Don 't Live Here Anymore " became Rose Royce 's biggest hit , reaching two on the UK Singles Chart while in Ireland it reached a peak of number seven . Across Europe , the song failed to chart except in Netherlands , where it reached eleven . The song was successful in Australia and New Zealand , where it reached positions four and two on the charts , respectively .

 Madonna covered " Love Don 't Live Here Anymore " for her second studio album , Like a Virgin , in 1984 . It was originally given a single release in March 1986 as a 7 " vinyl in Japan only and was given a full release in 1996 as it was included on the 1995 ballads hits compilation Something to Remember . The idea to cover the song was actually Michael Ostin 's , the head of the A & R department of Warner Bros. Records . In author Warren <unk> book Revolutions in Sound : Warner Bros. Records , the First 50 Years , he recalled : 
 " I had the good fortune of finding material that Madonna really responded to , ' Love Don 't Live Here Anymore ' for instance , which was the old Rose Royce record . I was driving into work one day and heard it on the radio , I called producer Nile Rodgers and Madonna , they were in the studio . I said , ' I have an idea , . You know the old Rose Royce record , ' Love Don 't Live Here Anymore ' ? Why don 't you try and record a version of it for Like a Virgin ? " 
 Initially both Rodgers and Madonna were apprehensive of tackling an already well @-@ known ballad , but in the last minute they decided that if Madonna wanted to bring diversity to the album , there could be no better song than " Love Don 't Live Here Anymore " . According to Rodgers , although Like a Virgin was mainly driven by Madonna , he was instrumental in adding " Love Don 't Live Here Anymore " to the track list . The song was a favorite of Madonna , so when in 1995 she released the compilation , she included a remixed and reworked version of " Love Don 't Live Here Anymore " produced by David Reitzas . The version was released as the second single from the album in North America and the third single in Europe and Australia . The original 1986 release was included in the 1996 Japanese box set CD Single Collection on 3 " CD single and includes the track listing from the 7 " vinyl version .

 Madonna 's version of the song begins with the sound of acoustic guitars and synth strings . Madonna 's voice sounds high @-@ pitched , eluding the deeper resonance of the tune . After the first verse , Tony Thompson starts playing the drums , which moves along the rhythm of the song . Towards the end , Madonna sings the song like a soul singer and the song ends with a gasp of breath . The song was recorded at Power Station Studio in Manhattan , New York . Rodgers recalled : " Madonna had never performed with a live orchestra before . I was very much into doing everything live , so I just said , ' Madonna , you go out there and sing and we will follow you . ' At first Madonna was hesitant , but the live setting ended up producing memorable results . She sang and she was overcome with emotions and she started crying , but I left it on the record . " 
 The 1995 remix was quite different from the 1984 version . It began with the sound of violins and <unk> pipes , followed by Madonna beginning the first verse . As the song progresses , the sound of the violin fades in and the drum machine starts , and the piano is played along with it . As the chorus is sung the third time , a bass drum is also added in the flow . The violin again fades in as Madonna sings " Through the windmills of my eye , Everyone can see the loneliness inside me . " Near the end , she utters the chorus a number of times , emphasizing on the word " anymore " and the phrase " live here anymore " . It ends with the <unk> pipes fading out . The song was also treated with remixes in various formats . <unk> & Karlin made an R & B styled remix ; while Marcus Schulz created a house remix . Madonna 's voice was paired with an energetic beat , coupled with vibrant organ lines and blipping synth effects . The remixes were released as promotional 12 " and CD singles on May 6 , 1996 .

 Author Rikky Rooksby wrote in his book The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna that Madonna 's singing in the song " deserved a commendation for bravery and was a sign that she was going to set herself challenges . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic , while reviewing Like a Virgin , wrote that the cover of the song was " well worth hearing " . Debbie Bull from Rolling Stone , meanwhile , opined that " her torchy ballad ' Love Don 't Live Here Anymore ' is awful . " Larry Flick from Billboard complimented both the versions of the song , calling the first version " a lush slice of symphonic pop " , and the other an " old @-@ school , jeep @-@ soul cruiser . Both arrangements perfectly suit her vocal , which is rife with emotional belts and theatrical gasps . [ ... ] David Reitzas string @-@ laden version will please those who never got enough of the previous single ' You 'll See ' . The bottom line is that this will likely be another smash for an artist whose stock as a credible musical entity deservedly rises with each release . " He also complimented the dance remixes of the song , saying that " when combined , [ Marcus Schultz house remix ] keyboard lines add up to a very pastel , tea @-@ dance ready twirler . His five mixes lean largely towards the middle of the club road . " Liz Smith , while reviewing the Something to Remember album in Newsday , felt that all of Madonna 's vocal trainings that she received while shooting for the film Evita , had " paid off , because the La M 's second single sounds wonderful , and is a step up from the previous haunting ' You 'll See ' . " Dorothy Holmes from Telegram & Gazette said that " ' Love Don 't Live Here Anymore ' sounds like her perfect adult contemporary staple . "

 The music video was directed by Jean @-@ Baptiste Mondino , who worked with Madonna in her videos for " Open Your Heart " , " Justify My Love " and " Human Nature " , and shot on March 4 , 1996 , at the <unk> El Molino in Buenos Aires , Argentina , during her day off from filming Evita . Maria Gallagher was the producer , with Jean @-@ Yves Escoffier serving as director of photography . It was a Bandits Production . In her Evita diaries , published by Vanity Fair magazine in 1996 , Madonna made reference to the video shoot . In her writings , she specifically mentioned forgetting the lyrics of the song , suggesting she was having an identity crisis of sorts , trying to juggle her own identity with that of her role of Eva Perón in Evita . Madonna was also in the early stages of her pregnancy with daughter Lourdes while making the video . Hence , she felt great stress while shooting it , which led her to forget the lyrics . She said , 
 " There are no words to describe the weariness I feel today . I have not slept well in days , and when I do , there is no comfort . My dreams are violent and full of betrayal . Like my life , there 's no escape . I feel the responsibility of this film . I cannot talk about Evita and her life without defending myself ... Dear God , what have I gotten myself into ? What is happening to me ? Today we went to shoot a music video for my next song . But I kept forgetting the lyrics , and felt like crying each and every time I did it . It was so frustrating . It 's my own song ! " 
 The video features Madonna at the empty suite of an abandoned hotel , a similar setting to her " Like a Virgin " music video . It was shot in a single frame , with the camera approaching Madonna , as she stands behind a pillar . She rotates around it and sings the song , as air blows through the room . The video ends with Madonna looking up towards the camera the last time , and then closing her eyes . It was treated with sepia color . Carol Vernallis , author of Experiencing music video : aesthetics and cultural context felt that the video was a good example of how image can direct the viewer 's attention towards the shift in instrumentation and arrangement of the song . She noted the aimless movement of the camera towards her as " bringing focus to the main subject , with the viewer 's attention fully captured . " 
 A mashup of " HeartBreakCity " , a track from her 13th studio album Rebel Heart , and " Love Don 't Live Here Anymore " was performed on Madonna 's 2015 – 16 Rebel Heart Tour . It began with the singer dancing with a male back @-@ up dancer as she sang " HeartBreakCity " ; then , she chased him up a long spiral staircase and pushed him backwards before merging into " Love Don 't Live Here Anymore " . Erik <unk> from The Las Vegas Sun , praised the performance for its simplicity .

 = 1880 Greenback National Convention = 
 The 1880 Greenback Party National Convention convened at the Interstate Exposition Building in Chicago from June 9 to 11 , 1880 , to select presidential and vice presidential nominees and write a party platform for the Greenback Party in the United States presidential election of 1880 . Delegates chose James B. Weaver of Iowa for President and Barzillai J. Chambers of Texas for Vice President . 
 The Greenback Party was a newcomer to the political scene in 1880 , having arisen , mostly in the nation 's West and South , as a response to the economic depression that followed the Panic of 1873 . During the American Civil War , Congress had authorized " greenbacks , " a form of money redeemable in government bonds , rather than in gold , as was traditional . After the war , many Democrats and Republicans in the East sought to return to the gold standard , and the government began to withdraw greenbacks from circulation . The reduction of the money supply , combined with the economic depression , made life harder for debtors , farmers , and industrial laborers ; the Greenback Party hoped to draw support from these groups . 
 Six men were candidates for the presidential nomination . Weaver , an Iowa congressman and Civil War general , was the clear favorite , but two other congressmen , Benjamin F. Butler of Massachusetts and Hendrick B. Wright of Pennsylvania , also commanded considerable followings . Weaver triumphed quickly , winning a majority of the 850 delegates ' votes on the first ballot . Chambers , a Texas businessman and Confederate veteran , was likewise nominated on the initial vote . More tumultuous was the fight over the platform , as delegates from disparate factions of the left @-@ wing movement clashed over women 's suffrage , Chinese immigration , and the extent to which the government should regulate working conditions . Votes for women was the most contentious of these , with the party ultimately endorsing the suffragists ' cause , despite a vocal minority 's opposition . 
 Weaver and Chambers left the convention with high hopes for the third party 's cause , but in the end they were disappointed . The election was a close contest between the Republican , James A. Garfield , and the Democrat , Winfield Scott Hancock , with Garfield being the narrow victor . The Greenback ticket placed a distant third , netting just over three percent of the popular vote .

 The Greenback Party was a newcomer to politics in 1880 , having first nominated candidates for national office four years earlier . The party had arisen , mostly in the West and South , as a response to the economic depression that followed the Panic of 1873 . During the Civil War , Congress had authorized " greenbacks , " a new form of fiat money that was redeemable not in gold but in government bonds . The greenbacks had helped to finance the war when the government 's gold supply did not keep pace with the expanding costs of maintaining the armies . When the crisis had passed , many in both the Democratic and Republican parties , especially in the East , wanted to return the nation 's currency to a gold standard as soon as possible ( candidates who favored the gold @-@ backed currency were called " hard money " supporters , while the policy of encouraging inflation was known as " soft money " ) . The Specie Payment Resumption Act , passed in 1875 , ordered that greenbacks be gradually withdrawn and replaced with gold @-@ backed currency beginning in 1879 . At the same time , economic depression had made it more expensive for debtors to pay debts they had contracted when currency was less valuable . Neither the Democrats nor the Republicans offered a home to those who favored retaining the greenbacks , so many looked to create a third party that would address their concerns . Greenbackers drew support from the growing labor movement in the nation 's Eastern cities as well as Western and Southern farmers who had been harmed by deflation . Beyond their support for a larger money supply , they also favored an eight @-@ hour work day , safety regulations in factories , and an end to child labor . As one author put it , they " anticipated by almost fifty years the progressive legislation of the first quarter of the twentieth century " . 
 In 1876 , various independent delegates gathered in Indianapolis to nominate a presidential ticket to campaign on those issues . For president , they chose Peter Cooper , an eighty @-@ five @-@ year @-@ old industrialist and philanthropist from New York , with Samuel Fenton Cary , a former Congressman from Ohio , as his running mate . The Greenback ticket fared poorly in the election that November , attracting just 81 @,@ 740 votes — less than 1 % of the total . As bad economic times continued , however , the party gained momentum . Labor unrest the following year , culminating in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 , added to many laborers ' alienation from the two major parties . Local movements , like California 's Workingmen 's Party , began to agitate for laws to improve the condition of laborers ( and for an end to Chinese immigration ) . By 1878 , the third @-@ party movement had become strong enough to elect 22 independents to the federal House of Representatives , most tied in some way to the Greenback movement . As the 1880 presidential election approached , members of the Greenback Party ( or Greenback @-@ Labor Party , as it was sometimes known ) had reason to believe that they could improve on the results of 1876 . 
 = = = Party split = = = 
 Attempts to fuse the disparate state and local parties into a national force led to friction between party leaders . By 1879 , there was a clear split , as a group led by Marcus M. " Brick " Pomeroy formed their own " Union Greenback Labor Party . " Pomeroy 's group of mostly Southern and Western Greenbackers was opposed to electoral fusion with either of the two major parties and took more radical positions on monetary policy , including payment of all federal bonds in greenbacks , rather than the gold dollars originally promised investors . They also differed from the Eastern @-@ centered rump party ( often called the " National Greenback Party " ) in calling for the popular election of postmasters and the death penalty as punishment for corruption in public office . After a January 1880 conference in Washington , D.C. failed to unite the factions , each party called for its own national convention to nominate candidates for president . 
 The Union Greenbackers held their convention first , meeting in St. Louis in March 1880 . Although much of the young party 's leadership remained with the Eastern faction , the March gathering included Solon Chase and Kersey Graves , among other third party notables . They nominated Stephen D. Dillaye , a New Jersey lawyer and journalist , for President and Barzillai J. Chambers , a Texas merchant and surveyor , for Vice President . Because Dillaye had previously declared he was not interested in the nomination , many delegates protested , seeing Dillaye as a placeholder for eventual re @-@ unification with the National Greenbackers . Dillaye , himself , supported reunification , and Pomeroy also urged the delegates to send representatives to the Easterners ' convention , which was set for June 1880 in Chicago . The majority agreed with the sentiment , and Union Greenbackers gathered in Chicago along with National Greenbackers as their convention began a few months later . 
 = = Candidates = = 
 = = = Weaver = = = 
 James Baird Weaver grew up on the Iowa frontier and was involved with the Republican Party from its early days in the late 1850s . At the outbreak of Civil War , he joined the Union Army . Weaver saw action at the battles of Fort Donelson , Shiloh , and Resaca , and rose to the rank of brevet brigadier general . After the war , he continued to be active in Iowa Republican politics . Weaver sought nomination to the House of Representatives and the Governorship , but each time was defeated by candidates from the party 's more conservative faction , led by William B. Allison . He campaigned for the Republican presidential candidate , Rutherford B. Hayes , in 1876 , but also attended the 1876 Greenback National Convention as an observer . 
 By 1877 , differences with party leadership on the money question led him to consider other options . After initially supporting the Republican candidate for governor that year , Weaver joined the Greenback Party in August . In 1878 , Weaver accepted the Greenback nomination for Iowa 's 6th congressional district . Although Weaver 's political career up to then had been as a staunch Republican , Democrats in the 6th district considered that endorsing him was likely the only way to defeat Ezekiel S. Sampson , the incumbent Republican . Despite objections from some hard @-@ money Democrats , the Greenback @-@ Democrat ticket prevailed , and Weaver was elected with 16 @,@ 366 votes to Sampson 's 14 @,@ 307 . 
 Weaver entered the 46th Congress in March 1879 . Although the House was closely divided , neither major party included the Greenbackers in their caucus , leaving them few committee assignments and little input on legislation . Weaver gave his first speech in April 1879 , criticizing the use of the army to police Southern polling stations , while also decrying the violence against black Southerners that made such protection necessary ; he then described the Greenback platform , which he said would put an end to the sectional and economic strife . The next month , he spoke in favor of a bill calling for an increase in the money supply by allowing the unlimited coinage of silver , but the bill was easily defeated . Weaver 's oratorical skill drew praise , and while he was unable to advance Greenback policy ideas , he was soon considered the front @-@ runner for the presidential nomination in 1880 . 
 = = = Butler = = = 
 Benjamin Franklin Butler was born in Deerfield , New Hampshire , and later moved to Massachusetts to pursue a legal career . He built a successful practice in the 1840s and 1850s and became involved in local politics as a Democrat . A compelling public speaker , Butler was first elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1853 . He successfully ran for a Massachusetts Senate seat in 1859 . Despite his Protestant upbringing , he gained a faithful following among Massachusetts Catholics and also built support among laborers . In the 1860 presidential campaign , Butler sought compromise with the slave power and believed Senator Jefferson Davis of Mississippi should be the Democratic Party 's nominee for president . 
 Butler had been elected a brigadier general of the Massachusetts militia , and when the Civil War began in 1861 , he quickly organized his men and marched south . Butler 's men occupied Baltimore to ensure that Maryland did not follow its fellow Southern states into secession . In May of that year , he was promoted to major general and sent to command at Fort Monroe in Virginia , where he pioneered the tactic of seizing and freeing slaves as " contraband of war " . When Union forces captured New Orleans , Butler was sent to command there . Butler 's rule was harsh , and he became especially reviled among Southern whites , to whom he was known as " Beast " Butler . He was transferred to the Virginia theater in 1863 , where he worked under General Ulysses S. Grant 's direction in the campaigns that led to the Confederacy 's defeat . 
 After the war , Butler was elected to Congress as a Republican , and soon came to identify with that party 's more radical element . In 1868 , he was among the leaders in President Andrew Johnson 's impeachment . Butler 's wartime exploits earned him support among blacks and abolitionists , which , combined with his existing base among laborers , ensured his reelection for several terms . His radicalism made him enemies among conservative Republicans , however , and when he lost his seat in the Democratic wave of 1874 , he began to shift his allegiance to the nascent Greenback Party . In 1876 , he returned to the House as a Republican , but in 1878 he ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Massachusetts as an independent Greenbacker with Democratic support . Butler had supporters across the political spectrum — he was often said to be " a member of all parties and false to each " — and was considered a presidential possibility when the Greenbackers convened in Chicago in 1880 . 
 = = = Wright = = = 
 Hendrick Bradley Wright was born and raised in northeastern Pennsylvania . After studying law at Dickinson College , Wright returned to Wilkes @-@ Barre and quickly became known as a gifted attorney and orator . His powers of speech earned him notice in Pennsylvania Democratic Party circles , as well as the nickname " Old @-@ Man @-@ Not @-@ Afraid @-@ To @-@ Be @-@ Called @-@ A @-@ <unk> " . He became a district attorney for Luzerne County in 1834 and was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1841 . Wright was reelected in 1842 and 1843 , serving as Speaker in his final term . He served as president of the 1844 Democratic National Convention , working with the anti @-@ Van Buren faction to prevent that former President 's nomination . After the convention , he sought a seat in the United States Senate , but was unsuccessful . 
 Wright was defeated for election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1850 , but was successful in 1852 . Defeated for reelection in 1854 , he ran in 1860 as a Democrat with Republican support , and was elected to represent Pennsylvania 's 12th congressional district . He spoke against the Peace Democrats early in the Civil War , but by 1864 , believing the Union war aims had changed for the worse , he supported Democrat George B. McClellan for the presidency . Wright did not run for reelection , returning to private life in 1863 . He continued his legal career and published writings on the relationship between labor and capital . His book , A Practical Treatise on Labor , was published in 1871 . 
 In 1876 , Wright was elected to his old seat in Congress as a Democrat , but with support from the small Greenback movement . In 1878 , the situation was reversed : Wright ran as a Greenbacker , but was reelected with support by Democrats . He attracted attention in Congress with his proposal to amend the Homestead Act of 1862 to establish government loans to would @-@ be settlers of the West , making it easier for landless Easterners to claim homesteads there . Congress was , on the whole , not receptive to Wright 's proposal . Wright proposed it again in 1879 and emphasized the conservatism of his proposal , that it was a loan secured by the homestead , not a gift from the state ; even so , the bill went down to overwhelming defeat . Despite his failure , Wright , like Weaver , had raised his profile as a potential presidential nominee by attempting to advance Greenback ideas in Congress . 
 = = = Other contenders = = = 
 Several favorite son candidates had delegates interested in their nomination , although they were seen as having less of a chance of gaining the nomination . Alexander Campbell had represented Illinois in the House of Representatives several years earlier . He was seen as a pragmatist who represented the Greenback Party 's more conservative members . <unk> James was the head of the Grange in Indiana and had served in the state legislature there , but attracted little support outside his own delegation . In the Wisconsin delegation , many favored Edward P. Allis , an industrialist who owned the Reliance Iron Works . Allis was a longtime supporter of soft money , but had no experience in elected office . Finally , Solon Chase of Maine had some support from the New England delegations . Chase was a publisher of a Greenback newspaper , Chase 's Inquirer , and had narrowly lost a House election in 1878 . Chase was among the most radical of the Greenbackers , attracting support from the party 's left @-@ wing members .

 The National Greenback Party delegates assembled in the Interstate Exposition Building in Chicago on Wednesday , June 9 , 1880 . The Republican convention took place in the same building and had only just ended after a record 36 rounds of balloting . When the Greenbackers arrived , the Republicans ' banners still hung from the walls , so the delegates were greeted by images of Abraham Lincoln and Thaddeus Stevens as they entered . The building , popularly known as the " Glass Palace " , had been built in 1873 for an Interstate Industrial Exposition . 
 Franklin P. Dewees of the party 's executive committee called the convention to order at 12 : 30 p.m. on June 9 . Reverend Pearl P. Ingalls of Iowa said a brief prayer , and the convention was opened . Gilbert De La <unk> , a Methodist minister and Greenback congressman from Indiana , was unanimously chosen as temporary chairman . After De La <unk> gave a brief , fiery speech , they proceeded to call the roll , which included delegates from every state except Oregon . As the roll call finished , Matilda Joslyn Gage , a suffragist , mounted the stage , provoking cheers from some delegates and howls of outrage from others . She called for the new party to recognize women 's right to vote , but the issue was avoided temporarily when the delegates voted to send her petition to a committee for further study . 
 = = = Reunification = = = 
 The Union Greenback convention had reconvened at nearby Farwell Hall and sent an emissary to the National Greenbackers . The delegates voted to join the other faction in a special conference committee to work for reunification , then adjourned until 7 : 30 that evening . While they waited for the committees to finish their work , the delegates listened to speeches by several prominent Greenbackers , including Denis Kearney , a California labor leader , and William Wallace , a Canadian parliamentarian and advocate for currency reform . Meanwhile , the Credentials Committee voted narrowly to admit the Union Greenbackers , as well as a delegation from the Socialist Labor Party . The Committee on Permanent Organization voted to recommend Richard F. Trevellick , a Michigan trade union organizer , as the permanent chairman of the convention . None of the reports were finished by the appointed time , so the convention adjourned again until 10 : 45 Thursday morning . 
 When they reconvened , the Credentials Committee announced that there were 608 regularly selected delegates , and recommended the admission of 185 Union Greenbackers and 44 Socialist Laborites , along with a handful of others . After a spirited and chaotic discussion , the convention voted to admit the other delegates in a voice vote : the party was reunified . Messages were sent to the Union Greenbackers and Socialist Laborites informing them of the results . In the meantime , the women 's suffrage supporters again tried to convince the delegates to endorse their cause . Sarah Andrews Spencer mounted the stage to give an impassioned argument for women 's right to vote , while Kearney climbed a nearby platform to shout his disapproval . Their informal debate was interrupted by a brass band announcing the arrival of the Union Greenbackers and Socialist Laborites . The convention erupted in prolonged cheering and a banner with the word " Reunion " was hoisted . The convention broke for a brief recess as the delegates renewed their acquaintance with the erstwhile schismatics . 
 = = = Platform = = = 
 The delegates voted to address the platform before deciding on nominees , and debate began when they reconvened at 8 : 45 p.m. Many fights and compromises had been hashed out in the Resolutions Committee already , but the delegates insisted on debating several provisions . On many planks , there was widespread agreement among the delegates . On the monetary issue , the platform declared that all money , whether metal or paper , should be issued by the government , not by banks ( as was common for paper money at the time ) . They also called for the unlimited coinage of silver and the repayment of the national debt in bonds , rather than gold dollars . Other planks of the platform called for a graduated income tax , laws to mandate safe working conditions in factories , the regulation of interstate commerce , and an end to child and convict labor ; all of these were familiar parts of Greenback platforms from earlier elections , and provoked no serious dissent . 
 Social issues provoked greater disagreement . Kearney 's Western faction gained a victory when the platform was made to include a call for an end to Chinese immigration . They also turned , at last , to the issue of suffrage . They eventually agreed on a vague statement in the platform , that the party would " denounce as dangerous , the efforts everywhere manifest to restrict the right of suffrage " . Many of the delegates found this unsatisfying , and called for a separate resolution on the subject . After more debate , a resolution calling for the enfranchisement of " every citizen " passed by a vote of 528 to 124 . The Socialist Labor faction proposed another resolution declaring " that land , air , and water are the grand gifts of nature to all mankind " , and that no person had a right to monopolize them ; the convention applauded , but the proposal was shunted off to a committee . 
 = = = Nominations and balloting = = = 
 It was nearly midnight Thursday night when the platform fights were finished , but the delegates voted to proceed immediately to nominations for President . At 1 : 00 Friday morning , the roll call began . S.F. Norton proposed his fellow Illinoisan , Alexander Campbell , proclaiming his great financial knowledge and association with Lincoln . James Buchanan , the editor of the Indianapolis Sun , proposed Benjamin Butler . Iowa Congressman Edward H. Gillette nominated Weaver , and Frank M. Fogg of Maine proposed " the farmer 's friend " , Solon Chase . Perry Talbot of Missouri nominated the Union Greenbackers ' nominee , Stephen D. Dillaye , who immediately asked that his name be withdrawn . Pennsylvania 's delegation nominated Hendrick Wright , and Wisconsin 's closed with the nomination of Edward P. Allis . 
 Now 3 : 25 a.m. , the delegates took an informal ballot . Weaver led the pack with about 30 % of the votes , with Wright , Dillaye , and Butler trailing at about 15 % each and the remaining votes scattered among the remaining candidates . Supporters of Wright and Butler talked of combining their forces , but the momentum favored Weaver . In the first formal ballot , at 4 : 10 a.m. , Weaver gained votes , and delegates began shifting their ballots to him . Without any official motion , the nomination was made unanimous , and the brass band again began to play . Weaver , who was staying at the nearby Palmer House hotel , was summoned to the convention . As they waited , the delegates turned to the vice presidential nomination . Some of Butler 's supporters proposed nominating Absolom M. West of Mississippi , a more conservative Greenbacker , to balance the ticket against Weaver , whom they regarded as radical . West , who was present at the convention , had already disappointed the radicals by opposing women 's suffrage and the eight @-@ hour day . They instead proposed Barzillai J. Chambers of Texas , who had been the Union Greenbackers ' nominee for vice president . The majority agreed , as Chambers took 403 votes to West 's 311 . 
 Weaver had still not arrived , and the Socialist Labor delegates took the opportunity to call for a re @-@ vote on their land plank and the women 's suffrage issue . The delegates overruled the chairman 's holding that the question was out of order and overwhelmingly voted that the " land , air , and water " plank and a plank explicitly supporting women 's suffrage should be considered " part of the platform " . Finally , at 6 : 00 a.m. , Weaver arrived . To thunderous applause , the nominee thanked the convention for its decision and accepted the nomination . At 6 : 45 a.m. , the exhausted delegates adjourned . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Three weeks later , Weaver published his formal letter of acceptance , calling for all party members to " go forth in the great struggle for human rights " . In a departure from the political traditions of the day , Weaver himself campaigned , making speeches across the South in July and August . As the Greenbackers had the only ticket that included a Southerner , Weaver and Chambers hoped to make inroads in the South . Chambers 's own participation was limited , as before reaching home from the convention , he fell as he exited his train and broke two ribs . He was confined to bed for several weeks and considered withdrawing from the race , but decided against it ; his efforts were limited by his injuries , and his only contribution to the campaign was to publish his newspaper . 
 As the campaign progressed , Weaver 's message of racial inclusion drew violent protests in the South , as the Greenbackers faced the same obstacles the Republicans did in the face of increasing black disenfranchisement . In the autumn , Weaver campaigned in the North , but the Greenbackers ' lack of support was compounded by Weaver 's refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans . 
 The Greenback ticket received 305 @,@ 997 votes and no electoral votes , compared to 4 @,@ 446 @,@ 158 for the winner , Republican James A. Garfield , and 4 @,@ 444 @,@ 260 for Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock . The party was strongest in the West and South , but in no state did Weaver receive more than 12 % of the vote , and his nationwide total was just 3 % . That figure represented an improvement over the Greenback vote of 1876 , but to Weaver , who expected twice as many votes as he received , it was a disappointment . 
 = Cyclone Pat = 
 Severe Tropical Cyclone Pat was a small but strong tropical cyclone that passed directly over Aitutaki , Cook Islands , in southern Pacific Ocean on February 10 , 2010 . Part of a series of storms to impact the group of islands early that year , Pat was first identified as a tropical depression on February 6 well to the northeast of the Samoan Islands . The storm steadily organized as it moved generally southeast , becoming a tropical cyclone on February 8 . Turning to the south , intensification began in earnest and the system acquired hurricane @-@ force winds within 48 hours of being named . The 445 km ( 275 mi ) wide system displayed annular characteristics and a 19 km ( 12 mi ) wide eye . Pat reached its peak strength early on February 10 as a severe tropical cyclone with winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) and a barometric pressure of 960 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 35 inHg ) . Hours later it struck Aitutaki , producing gusts in excess of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) on the island . Hostile wind shear then prompted rapid weakening of the cyclone . The system degraded below gale @-@ intensity on February 11 , just 24 hours after it peaked , and was last noted early on February 12 . 
 Battering Aitutaki with wind gusts in excess of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) , Cyclone Pat devastated the island . Approximately 78 percent of homes were damaged , with 72 structures destroyed . The electrical grid was left completely offline and supply of water was largely lost . Agriculture also experienced tremendous impact , with most crops completely lost . Damage on Aitutaki amounted to US $ 13 @.@ 7 million ; however , casualties were minimal with only eight minor injuries reported . Recovery efforts began immediately after the storm , with the Red Cross and the Government of New Zealand aiding the local government . A reconstruction plan was enacted by the Cook Islands within a month and subsequently funded by New Zealand . Owing to its destructive effects , the name Pat was later retired and replaced with <unk> .

 Between January and March 2010 , the Australian monsoon trough extended unusually far east over the southern Pacific Ocean . With above @-@ average sea surface temperatures , stemming from a moderate @-@ strength El Niño , multiple low pressure systems were able to develop across the region . An unusual spree of tropical cyclogenesis in rapid succession ensued , including four hurricane @-@ strength storms : Oli , Pat , Rene , and Tomas . On February 6 , the Fiji Meteorological Service ( FMS ) began monitoring a tropical depression , dubbed <unk> , well to the northeast of the Samoan Islands . Embedded within a well @-@ developed trough , the system displayed curved convective banding features . Environmental conditions in the area , including low wind shear , high ocean heat content , and upper @-@ level outflow , favored cyclogenesis . Additionally , an active Madden – Julian oscillation phase moving into the region was expected to bolster development . Steady improvement of the system 's convective structure ensued and early on February 7 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert . The low trekked generally east @-@ southeast in response to a near @-@ equatorial ridge anchored to the north . The storm 's appearance continued to improve and Dvorak classifications rose to T2.5 , indicating gale @-@ force winds were likely present . Accordingly , the JTWC began issuing advisories on the system at 18 : 00 UTC and dubbed it Tropical Cyclone <unk> . Forecasters noted , however , that the small size of the cyclone could lead to erroneously low Dvorak estimates . The FMS followed suit six hours later and assigned the name Pat to the cyclone , assessing it as a Category 1 on the Australian cyclone scale . 
 Convection became increasingly symmetric on February 8 , and a small eye feature appeared on microwave satellite imagery . Spanning no more than 445 km ( 275 mi ) , the developing storm began a gradual turn to the south as steering currents shifted from the equatorial ridge to a subtropical ridge . Based on increasing Dvorak numbers , the JTWC assessed Pat to have reached hurricane @-@ intensity by 06 : 00 UTC on February 9 . The eye feature became more pronounced throughout the day , with convection consolidating inward and becoming more symmetric . Accordingly , the FMS accordingly upgraded Pat to a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone by 18 : 00 UTC . The system became annular in nature on February 10 , characterized by a lack of prominent banding features and uniform convection which surrounded its 19 km ( 12 mi ) wide eye . Pat reached its peak intensity at 06 : 00 UTC that day as it began turning to the southwest . Maximum winds were estimated at 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) alongside a barometric pressure of 960 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 35 inHg ) . At the same time , the JTWC assessed Pat to have been a Category 2 @-@ equivalent on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane scale with one @-@ minute sustained winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) . Weakening began shortly thereafter as wind shear over the system increased . Pat passed directly over the island of Aitutaki between 12 : 00 and 18 : 00 UTC . 
 The low @-@ level center of Pat began decoupling from convection late on February 10 once it cleared Aitutaki . The storm rapidly weakened amid strong shear , with the center being left completely exposed early on February 11 . A solitary band remained along the south side of the storm by that time , and the FMS no longer considered it a tropical cyclone after 06 : 00 UTC . The lone band of convection dissipated later that day and with no residual thunderstorm activity , the skeletal low turned westward in response to westerly flow . The JTWC maintained Pat as a tropical storm until 18 : 00 UTC and as a tropical depression until its dissipation early on February 12 .

 Starting on February 7 , tropical cyclone alerts and later gale warnings were issued for the northern Cook Islands under the anticipation of gale @-@ force winds impacting populated islands . The first of these islands were Manihiki , Rakahanga , and Suwarrow . As the storm moved southward , the advisories shifted accordingly . Strong wind warnings were raised for Pukapuka , Nassau , and <unk> on February 8 ; however , they were dropped later that day as Cyclone Pat moved away . Alerts on potential gales in the southern Cook Islands also began on February 8 , including the islands of Atiu , Aitutaki , Manuae , Mitiaro , and <unk> . Gale warnings for Aitutaki , Palmerston , and Rarotonga began on February 9 and extended to Mauke the next day . Early on February 10 , a hurricane warning was issued for Aitutaki . With the core of Pat 's destructive winds forecast to pass close to or over the island , sustained winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) and gusts of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) were anticipated . The aforementioned warnings were allowed to expire once Pat cleared the Cook Islands on February 11 and was no longer a threat . 
 Emergency centers were prepped across the northern Cook Islands on February 8 . The Cook Islands Chapter of the Red Cross took early action with Cyclone Pat and began stockpiling relief supplies on February 9 . Volunteers from the organization assisted elderly residents with preparation and evacuation on Aitutaki . Anticipating high winds , residents tied down homes with rope and wire and boarded up windows with shutters . Similar preparations took place on Rarotonga , though the main concern there was storm surge . Government offices and schools there were closed on February 11 . Most residents and all tourists along the coast in Aitutaki evacuated inland to designated shelters . Authorities later announced that they were under @-@ prepared for Cyclone Pat . The lack of an official process during an emergency was cited as a core issue . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Passing directly over Aitutaki on February 10 , Pat produced wind gusts in excess of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) making it one of the most powerful storms ever experienced by residents on the island . It is also considered among the most damaging on the island . Aitutaki Mayor Tai Herman claimed the winds to be much stronger , with gusts up to 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) during the worst of the storm . These winds were above building codes at the time , which required structures to be able to withstand winds of 176 km / h ( 109 mph ) . Numerous trees and power lines fell amid the powerful winds , cutting power to the entirety of the island and severing communications . According to the Government of the Cook Islands , 78 percent of the homes on the island sustained damage . Of the 277 affected homes , 59 sustained minor damage , 51 moderate , 95 major , and 72 were destroyed . Severity of damage correlated with the age of each home , with buildings over 25 years old suffering the greatest impact . Collateral damage took place when debris from damaged or destroyed structures became airborne and struck other buildings . Hardest hit were the villages of <unk> and <unk> . Costs to homes amounted to NZ $ 15 million ( US $ 10 @.@ 6 million ) . 
 One building at the Seventh Day Adventist church primary school collapsed while another sustained severe damage . Although damage occurred at <unk> School , it was utilized as an evacuation shelter . The primary school and college in <unk> also suffered damage . The island 's electrically run water supply was substantially effected . A total of 568 homes lost access to clean water , with many waters tanks damaged or destroyed . Aitutaki 's only hospital fared well through the storm , with some roof damage and flooded rooms . Infrastructural losses totaled to NZ $ 2 @.@ 3 million ( US $ 1 @.@ 6 million ) , mainly stemming from the power grid . The agricultural sector sustained extensive damage , amounting to US $ 1 @.@ 5 million , with some crops experiencing a total loss . The severity of damage raised concerns about food security in the months after the storm . Particularly hard @-@ hit was the mango crop , which was to be harvested two weeks after Pat struck . Approximately 60 – 75 percent of the coconut trees and 75 percent of java plum , mango , and kapok trees sustained damage . Most trees had at least one branch torn off and in most cases , multiple branches . Additionally , the blue lorikeet ( Vini peruviana ) , a bird native to French Polynesia and the Cook Islands , population suffered dramatic losses due to the storm , with the population on Aitutaki dropping by more than 50 percent . 
 All told , losses from Pat amounted to US $ 13 @.@ 7 million . However , Dr. Russell <unk> from the Secretariat of the Pacific Community ( SPC ) stated that damage reached US $ 8 @.@ 2 million . In comparison , the collective damage from cyclones in the Cook Islands since 1955 was US $ 47 million according to the SPC . In contrast to the severity of damage , no fatalities and only eight minor injuries took place . 
 Fearing similar damage to Aitutaki , a pre @-@ emptive state of emergency was issued for Rarotonga . This was soon lifted as Pat ultimately spared Rarotonga and little damage took place there . Gale @-@ force winds and heavy rains impacted Rarotonga and Palmerston islands . Large swells affected the uninhabited Penrhyn atoll , interfering with a study of marine turtles .

 Immediately following Pat 's passage , the Government of the Cook Islands declared Aitutaki a disaster zone . In accordance with the FRANZ agreement , the Government of New Zealand made an initial donation of NZ $ 350 @,@ 000 for recovery efforts prior to the formal request for assistance on February 13 . Following said request , New Zealand prepped a C @-@ 130 Hercules aircraft with emergency supplies and New Zealand Defense Force ( <unk> ) personnel which arrived in Aitutaki on February 15 . The aircraft made four trips in all which provided several tonnes of aid to the island . The <unk> priority was repair of schools and hospitals , though they assisted the Red Cross with clearing debris , restoring power , and setting up temporary shelters for affected residents . The lack of access to clean water prompted significant concern , and a water and sanitation expert from the Australian Red Cross flew in on February 12 to assist with restoration efforts . Immediate provisions of 600 water bottles were sent to the island on February 16 . The Red Cross subsequently began pumping and filtering water , using a truck to distribute it to the island 's villages . Through September 24 , they provided over 100 @,@ 000 litres of clean water . Distribution of 2 @,@ 050 collapsible containers and 200 hygiene kits lessened dependency on the Red Cross 's water pump . 
 An extensive repair and recovery plan was enacted by the Government of the Cook Islands within a month of Cyclone Pat , which covered agricultural , infrastructural , and societal sectors . Financial restraints hindered the expected progress of this operation , with more than two @-@ thirds of it not being funded by the final plan report on March 4 . Of the NZ $ 15 million ( US $ 10 @.@ 6 million ) in home damage , NZ $ 7 @.@ 2 million ( US $ 5 @.@ 1 million ) was covered . New Zealand later provided a NZ $ 5 @.@ 5 million ( US $ 3 @.@ 9 million ) grant to assist in this effort . Priority was placed on repairing damaged homes , with lesser emphasis on destroyed ones . Labor costs would ultimately reach NZ $ 6 million ( US $ 4 @.@ 2 million ) for this project . <unk> of the funding for reconstruction was delayed and had not started by early June , with some residents still living in tents . Farmers were provided with NZ $ 195 @,@ 000 ( US $ 138 @,@ 000 ) worth of seeds , seedlings , and various supplies to jump @-@ start agricultural recovery . Since the majority of the island 's electrical grid was destroyed , an earlier plan to convert the network to underground cables was accelerated due to a convenience factor . 
 By February 17 , 80 percent of the grid was restored ; however , only 10 percent homes were actually connected . The presence of dead vegetation left behind by the storm created fire hazards across the island , prompting the government to issue a ban on burning . The Seventh Day Adventist church primary school resumed classes on February 15 despite losing a building . All other schools suspended activities until February 22 ; however , the approach of Tropical Depression 11F delayed this until the following day . On February 23 , the European Union provided US $ 110 @,@ 000 in emergency funds to the Cook Islands . Habitat for Humanity later sought to assist in the rebuilding process in April , with a funding goal of NZ $ 300 @,@ 000 ( US $ 210 @,@ 000 ) . 
 Depression set in among members throughout the storm @-@ battered community once the rebuilding process began . Fears of possible emigration stemming soon arose . Mayor Tai Herman feared that survivors would consider selling their homes and leave the Cook Islands altogether . Even Prime Minister Jim <unk> was reported to be left in shock by the scale of damage . The government enacted a three @-@ month psychological support plan accordingly to help residents cope with the disaster and maintain social integrity among victims . Through September , 265 people took advantage of this program . 
 = Indian Head eagle = 
 The Indian Head eagle was a ten @-@ dollar gold piece , or eagle struck by the United States Mint continuously from 1907 until 1916 , and then irregularly until 1933 . The obverse and the reverse , designed by the sculptor Augustus Saint @-@ Gaudens , were originally commissioned for use on other denominations . Saint @-@ Gaudens was suffering from cancer , and did not survive to see the coins released . 
 Beginning in 1904 , President Theodore Roosevelt proposed the introduction of new , more artistic designs on US coins , prompting the Mint to hire Saint @-@ Gaudens to create them . Roosevelt and Saint @-@ Gaudens at first considered a uniform design for the four denominations of US coin which were struck in gold , but in 1907 Roosevelt decided to use a model for the obverse of the eagle that the sculptor had meant to use for the cent . For the reverse of the ten @-@ dollar coin the President decided on a design featuring a standing bald eagle , which had been developed for the twenty @-@ dollar piece designed by Saint @-@ Gaudens . 
 The coin , as sculpted by Saint @-@ Gaudens , was in too high relief for the Mint to strike readily ; completion of the design modifications necessary to make the coin sufficiently flat to be struck by one blow of the Mint 's presses took months . Following the sculptor 's death on August 3 , 1907 , Roosevelt insisted that the new eagle be finished and struck that month . New pieces were given to the President on August 31 , which differ from the coins struck later for circulation . 
 The omission of the motto " In God We Trust " on the new coins caused public outrage , and prompted Congress to pass a bill mandating its inclusion . Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber added the words and made minor modifications to the design . The Indian Head eagle was struck regularly until 1916 , and then intermittently until President Franklin Roosevelt directed the Mint to stop producing gold coins in 1933 . Its termination ended the series of eagles struck for circulation begun in 1795 . Many Indian Head eagles were melted by the government in the late 1930s ; the 1933 issue is a particular rarity , as few were distributed . 
 = = Inception = = 
 In 1904 , President Theodore Roosevelt wrote to his Secretary of the Treasury , Leslie Mortier Shaw , complaining that U.S. coinage lacked artistic merit , and enquiring if it would be possible to engage a private artist , such as sculptor Augustus Saint @-@ Gaudens , to prepare new coin designs . At Roosevelt 's direction , the Mint hired Saint @-@ Gaudens to redesign the cent and the four gold pieces : the double eagle ( $ 20 ) , eagle ( $ 10 ) , half eagle ( $ 5 ) , and quarter eagle ( $ 2 @.@ 50 ) . The Liberty Head design had been first struck for the eagle in 1838 ; the last addition to the Liberty Head gold series , the double eagle , was first struck for circulation in 1850 . The designs of those pieces had remained unchanged for more than 25 years , hence they could be changed without an act of Congress . 
 In 1905 , Mint Engraver Charles E. Barber engraved the obverse of Roosevelt 's inauguration medal , while his assistant , George T. Morgan , engraved the reverse . Roosevelt disliked the work , and engaged Saint @-@ Gaudens to design an unofficial medal commemorating the inauguration . Saint @-@ Gaudens foresaw resistance from Barber on the question of the new coinage ; he wrote to his brother , Louis Saint @-@ Gaudens , " Barber is a <unk> [ son of a bitch ] but I had a talk with the President who ordered Secretary Shaw in my presence to cut Barber 's head off if he didn 't do our bidding " . 
 Roosevelt was impressed by some models Saint @-@ Gaudens had prepared for the cent showing a head of Liberty . In early 1907 , he wrote to Saint @-@ Gaudens proposing that a Native American or Indian headdress be added to the obverse of the cent : " I feel very strongly that on at least one coin we ought to have the Indian feather headdress . It is distinctly American , and very picturesque . Couldn 't you have just such a head as you have now , but with the feather headdress ? " Numismatic historian Walter Breen described this as " the absurd addition of a feathered <unk> , such as neither Ms. Liberty nor any Native American woman would ever have worn " . Art historian Cornelius Vermeule stated that the Indian Head eagle " missed being a great coin because Roosevelt interfered with the choice of headdress ( or no headdress ) for Liberty " . 
 In February 1907 , Saint @-@ Gaudens added the headdress to the head of Liberty . The sculptor was undecided about which design to use for the gold pieces ( which were still intended to have a uniform appearance ) , and after he proposed using the headdress Liberty for the double eagle , Roosevelt tentatively decided to use different designs on the eagle and double eagle , with the eagle to bear the headdress Liberty . The double eagle would show a Liberty striding forward , with a flying eagle on the reverse . The President was prepared to meet personally with Saint @-@ Gaudens if the sculptor objected , but unknown to Roosevelt he was seriously ill with cancer , and no meeting took place . 
 Mint Director George E. Roberts wrote to Saint @-@ Gaudens on May 25 , 1907 , " It is now settled ... the design for the Eagle shall be the feather head of Liberty with the standing eagle " . Saint @-@ Gaudens and his assistants moved quickly on the revision . On June 1 , Saint @-@ Gaudens sent models of the new coin , with the designs at a relief that Saint @-@ Gaudens believed the Mint could coin , together with a letter stating that the relief of the new models should be coinable by the Mint . The double eagles were then being delayed because Saint @-@ Gaudens had twice sent the Mint models with too high a relief , which could not be struck in one blow , as required for circulating coinage . 
 Saint @-@ Gaudens 's letter was sent to the Philadelphia Mint , where Superintendent John Landis had Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber read and initial it . On June 7 , Barber responded to Landis , 
 I beg to report that I have received two models in plaster and also a copy of a letter from Mr. Saint @-@ Gaudens to the Director , in which there are certain statements that are somewhat misleading ... the relief of the design must conform to the fixed conditions and therefore , the only relief that I knew of was coin relief ; the models now sent are not coin relief ... The date of the year is in Roman notation , there is no provision made for even next year , there being no place left , and as these coins have to stand for twenty @-@ five years before another change can be made , I feel it necessary to state that within a few years it would be impossible to date the dies . 
 Roberts wrote to Saint @-@ Gaudens on June 11 suggesting there might be problems with the date and the relief ; when he received no response he wrote again on June 18 . This time the sculptor responded , writing that he had been awaiting the return of his assistant , Henry Hering , who had handled much of the dealings with the Mint . He agreed that Roman numerals were ill @-@ advised for the eagle , and on June 24 , new models were sent to the Mint by Hering . These models , along with a bronze casting which was produced privately , were used by Barber to prepare a die , and experimental pieces were struck on July 19 . These " high relief " pieces required multiple strikes of the press to fully bring up the design . Saint @-@ Gaudens wrote to the Mint in mid @-@ July , " I am waiting to know about this in order to proceed with the other reliefs " , and he was sent one of the new pieces , along with a Liberty Head eagle for comparison , for which he paid by check . 
 On July 19 , Roberts sent a similar pair of coins to Secretary of the Treasury George Cortelyou , noting that Saint @-@ Gaudens 's use of a smooth finish to the design , rather than the sharp die work characteristic of the Liberty gold pieces , might encourage counterfeiting . Roberts communicated these concerns to Saint @-@ Gaudens , who requested casts of the dies used to strike the new pieces , which were sent to his house in Cornish , New Hampshire on July 28 . Saint @-@ Gaudens died there of cancer on August 3 , 1907 , and Roosevelt wrote to his widow Augusta , " I count it as one of the privileges of my administration to have had him make two of our coins " . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Roberts left office on July 31 , 1907 to become president of the Commercial National Bank of Chicago . As his successor , San Francisco Mint Superintendent Frank A. Leach , did not take office until November 1 , former Mint Director Robert Preston served as acting director in the interim . 
 On August 7 , Roosevelt ordered Secretary Cortelyou to have the designs for the eagle and double eagle finalized and in production by September 1 . With Landis on vacation , Cortelyou passed the President 's letter on to the acting Philadelphia Mint superintendent , Dr. Albert A. Norris , instructing him to " have this matter taken up at once and the President 's instructions carried out ; and everything possible must be done to expedite the work . " Preston wrote to Roberts , asking for information about the new coinage , and the former Mint director responded on August 12 , outlining the correspondence with Saint @-@ Gaudens , and noting that " no instructions have been received from the President as to the half and quarter eagle , but I expected that the eagle design would be used upon them ... The President concluded to leave the One Cent piece unchanged , and there has been no discussion about any change in the Nickel piece . " 
 In response to the President 's instructions , Barber wrote to Norris informing him that the design for the eagle had been awaiting approval since July , making no mention of the Mint 's desire for sharper die work . Norris noted in his subsequent letter to Acting Director Preston that the Mint had been having trouble with the collar , which would strike the edge of the coin and impress 46 stars , representing the number of states there would be after Oklahoma 's already scheduled admission to the Union later in 1907 . Mint authorities had turned unsuccessfully to their counterparts in Paris for advice , but the Mint 's machine shop was able to perfect the collar . Norris defended Barber in his letter to Preston , 
 I think the President does Mr. Barber an injustice when he speaks of " a certain <unk> of mind and inability to do the speediest modern work , as shown by these delays , " here . The making of the models for these coins was given to Saint Gaudens , who was a sculptor and had no experience with coinage designs . When the models were received , the Bureau [ of the Mint ] was notified that the dies made from them would not work in the coining press ... the models were returned to Saint Gaudens , at his request and a modified set furnished after some time . The Bureau was informed that even these would not make dies satisfactory for coinage , but the dies were made and it was found they could not be used in the coining press . How are we going to strike coins from these for the President ? 
 In late August , Augusta Saint @-@ Gaudens sent new models for the eagle to Acting Director Preston . When Barber examined them , he noted , " dies made from these models would be a great improvement over those already made " and stated that with these models , the Mint could have the eagle in full production within a month . Homer Saint @-@ Gaudens , the sculptor 's son , wrote to Preston , " Mr. Hering has finally finished the eagle at a relief slightly lower than that on the French [ gold ] coin by Chaplin , [ sic , actually Chaplain ] which is the lowest relief that Mr. Hering knew my father would abide by , and which I understand Mr. Barber can mint . " In the meantime , Cortelyou ordered 500 pieces struck on the Mint 's high @-@ pressure medal press from the dies the Mint had from Saint @-@ Gaudens 's earlier efforts , thus complying with the letter of the President 's August 7 order . Preston sent a note to Norris , warning that the President would likely order 100 pieces and suggesting that he have the coins available " so you can furnish them without a moment 's delay " . According to numismatic historian Roger Burdette , " these were an ' insurance policy ' , put in place by Cortelyou against additional presidential rage " . The President viewed sample eagle coins on August 31 , and expressed his satisfaction with them and his desire to see more struck . 
 As Saint @-@ Gaudens 's design did not include a rim ( the raised surface which surrounds each side of a coin ) , excess metal was forming a " fin " or extrusion from the coin . The fin was easily broken off , and there was a threat that the eagles would quickly become underweight , diminishing their usefulness as a trade coin . Barber engraved a rim onto the die , eliminating the problem . 
 About five hundred pieces had been struck from Saint @-@ <unk> 's original dies ; these were struck on the medal press and were for the most part distributed to government officials . They are referred to as " wire rim " pieces , denoting the sharp angle at which the field of the coin meets the edge without the intermediary of a rim . They remained available for purchase from the Mint for face value at least until 1912 . One sold at auction in January 2011 for $ 230 @,@ 000 . A total of 32 @,@ 000 eagles were struck using the Barber @-@ modified Saint @-@ Gaudens dies , for the most part using ordinary coinage presses . These are known as the " rounded rim " pieces . On November 9 , 1907 , with the dies made from the low relief Saint @-@ Gaudens models in full production , Frank Leach , the new Mint director , decided to have 31 @,@ 950 of the rounded rim specimens melted , saving only fifty . According to Leach in his memoirs , these " were given to museums of art and officials and others connected with the work " . The surviving rounded rim specimens can be readily distinguished from later 1907 strikes , as they have dots before , between , and after the words " Ten Dollars " on the reverse . One , which had been in the possession of the Leach family for a century , sold in January 2011 for $ 2 @,@ 185 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Still believing that the design would be considered for the cent , Saint @-@ Gaudens based his head of Liberty on a model he had sculpted , but ultimately not used , for the statue of Victory in the Sherman Monument in New York City . That bust , of South Carolinian Harriet ( Hettie ) Eugenia Anderson , also inspired Saint @-@ Gaudens in his model and bas @-@ relief , <unk> <unk> ( Ancient Greek for victory and peace ) . 
 Saint @-@ Gaudens 's reverse design , with an eagle standing on a bundle of arrows with an olive branch at its feet , was his original concept for the reverse of the double eagle , and bears a close similarity to his reverse for the inaugural medal . Saint @-@ Gaudens 's ultimate inspiration for the reverse , by one account , was a coin of Ptolemy I of Egypt portraying a standing eagle , which was illustrated in a book he owned and had lent to Roosevelt . 
 Jeff Garrett and Ron Guth , in their work on American gold coins , call the details of the coin " a trifle fantastic " . They point to the unlikeliness of any female wearing a headdress only donned by a male warrior , and describe the word " LIBERTY " on the headdress as " placed incongruously " . 
 Mint Director Leach described the pieces in a report to Cortelyou summarizing the redesign project : 
 The obverse of the eagle bears the feathered head of Liberty which was originally intended for the one cent piece . The President was so pleased with this design that he decided to have it placed on the eagle . The head , the artist stated , was designed in accordance with the suggestions of the President . The reverse bears the standing eagle , and on the edge of the coins there are forty @-@ six stars , one for each State . 
 = = Release and production = = 
 The new eagles entered circulation around November 4 , 1907 , although Leach did not receive formal approval to issue the pieces until December 19 . 
 As early as November 7 , articles were appearing in newspapers noting the omission of the motto " In God We Trust " on the eagle , and the Mint soon began to receive many complaints . Roosevelt believed that using God 's name on coins was sacrilegious , and had confirmed with government lawyers that no law required the motto 's use . Saint @-@ Gaudens wanted to include only the minimum of lettering on the new coins , and was content to omit the motto . According to his son Homer , as Saint @-@ Gaudens considered " the motto ' In God We Trust ' as an artistic intrusion not required by law , he wholly discarded [ it ] and thereby drew down on himself the lightning of public comment " . The House of Representatives passed a bill ordering the use of the motto on the new eagle and double eagle ( which also lacked the phrase ) in March 1908 ; the Senate followed suit in May . Roosevelt , finding public opinion against him , signed the bill into law that month . Barber duly placed the motto on the reverse , to the left of the eagle 's breast . On the " No Motto pieces " struck at the Denver Mint in 1908 ( catalogued as 1908 @-@ D ) , the mintmark " D " appears above the leaves near the eagle 's feet on the reverse ; on the pieces with motto struck both at Denver and at San Francisco ( mintmark S ) beginning in 1908 , the mintmark appears to the left of the arrow on which the bird stands . Barber also made other , minor changes in the coin ; according to Breen , " Aside from the addition of the motto , none of Barber 's niggling changes are defensible as improvements , unless one insists that more of the first U of UNUM had to show . Nor is striking quality increased . " 
 Denver mintmarks from 1908 to 1910 are much larger than those in subsequent years ; San Francisco mintmarks are consistently small . With the admission of New Mexico and Arizona as states in 1912 , the number of stars on the edge was increased from 46 to 48 . 
 The coin was struck every year from 1907 to 1916 . During World War I , with gold coins commanding a premium above face value and many gold pieces returning from Europe to pay for war materials , there was little need for new gold coins ; coinage of eagles was discontinued after 1916 . Subsequently , Indian Head eagles were struck only in 1920 ( at San Francisco ) , 1926 ( at Philadelphia ) , 1930 ( at San Francisco ) , and final Philadelphia issues in 1932 and 1933 . In March 1933 , President Franklin Roosevelt ordered that no more gold in the form of coins be released from the Treasury ; the Mint subsequently stopped its production of gold coins , ending the eagle series that had begun in 1795 . 
 On December 28 , 1933 , Acting Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau ordered Americans to turn in all gold coins and gold certificates , with limited exceptions , receiving paper money in payment . Millions of gold coins were melted down by the Treasury in the following years . Many of the gold coins seen today had been exported to Europe before 1933 and repatriated once restrictions on holding gold were ended . 
 = = Collecting = = 
 With the exception of the 1907 high relief pieces , no date or mintmark of the circulation strikes of the Indian Head eagle before 1920 is particularly rare . The 1911 @-@ D , with a mintage of 30 @,@ 100 commands a significant premium in mint state or uncirculated condition , but only a modest one in circulated grades . Despite its mintage of 126 @,@ 500 , the 1920 @-@ S is a major rarity . It was little collected at the time , and with Europe still recovering from the war , few coins were exported there ; accordingly , most were melted post @-@ 1933 . Only a handful of 1933 eagles were distributed before Roosevelt ended the paying out of gold , and virtually the entire mintage of 312 @,@ 500 was melted . One sold in 2004 , graded MS @-@ 66 ( the finest example of this date known ) for $ 718 @,@ 750 . Approximately forty 1933 eagles are known to have survived . 
 Proof coins were struck from 1907 until 1915 , all at Philadelphia . Not all quantities are known , but the highest for which the number struck is known is 1910 , with a mintage of 204 ( one sold for $ 80 @,@ 500 in 2006 ) . One of the surviving specimens of the mostly melted rounded rim pieces is in proof ; this unique specimen is in private hands . Numismatic expert Mike <unk> , in his book on the gold pieces with Indian designs struck in the early 20th century , suggests that this coin was a trial piece , resulting from the test of new dies . Different finishes are known for the proof coins . The unique 1907 piece is in satin proof ( the raised designs appear like satin ) , but later proof eagles were struck in a dark matte finish . Some 1908 – 1910 proof eagles were struck in a lighter " Roman finish " . 
 = Boletopsis nothofagi = 
 Boletopsis nothofagi is a fungus in the family Bankeraceae . The fungus forms grey fruit bodies that grow in clusters . Like all species of Boletopsis , it has a porous spore @-@ bearing surface on the underside of the cap , but differs from other species of Boletopsis by having characteristics such as elongated spores and a green discoloration when stained with potassium hydroxide . Boletopsis nothofagi is endemic to New Zealand and has a mycorrhizal association with red beech ( Nothofagus fusca ) . It is unknown when exactly the fungus forms its fruit body , but it has so far been found solely in May , during autumn in the Southern Hemisphere . 
 The first description of B. nothofagi was published in 2012 by Jerry A. Cooper and Patrick Leonard . DNA studies of the fungus suggest that it is a somewhat basal member of the genus Boletopsis . The fungus is most likely a native species of New Zealand and was present there before the arrival of Europeans . As it is very rare and possibly threatened , B. nothofagi is listed in the Red List of Threatened Species as an endangered species . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 In 2009 , an unknown species of Boletopsis was discovered in the <unk> valley near Wellington , New Zealand . In 2010 , the fungus was found again in the same place and also discovered on the South Island . Morphological comparisons and molecular analysis of other species of the genus suggested that the fungus could not be attributed to any known representative of the genus , and so it was described by mycologists Jerry A. Cooper and Patrick Leonard as a new species . The species description of Boletopsis nothofagi appeared in the journal <unk> in 2012 . The two authors chose the epithet nothofagi based on the characteristic of the fungus as mycorrhizal symbiont of Nothofagus fusca . Swollen hyphae and smooth spores show that B. nothofagi is a member of the subgenus Boletopsis in the genus Boletopsis . 
 Boletopsis nothofagi is a genetically clearly differentiated representative of the genus Boletopsis , which according to the investigations of Cooper and Leonard separated relatively early from the precursor of most other known species . Only a North American species , B. <unk> , branches off from their phylogenetic tree even earlier . However , the relationships between many of the species were not fully resolved in the study , so in the future , new species may be described . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit bodies of Boletopsis nothofagi usually grow in tufts and only rarely individually . They have a centrally stalked cap . The cap is convex , measuring 10 – 80 mm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 3 @.@ 1 in ) wide and 5 – 22 mm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 9 in ) high . In young specimens , the cap 's edge is slightly bent , whereas the cap of older fruit bodies often curl . The cap cuticle is gray in color , and its texture ranges from smooth to slightly fibrous . <unk> or scrape @-@ spots are stained darker and eventually blacken . 
 The stipes are club @-@ shaped to cylindrical , slightly tapering towards both base and cap , with a height of about 20 – 60 mm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 2 @.@ 4 in ) and a thickness of 10 – 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 0 in ) . The stipe is smooth and dry on the surface and has a firm texture on the inside . The stipes have a similar color as the cap and shows the same responses to damage . 
 The white , porous hymenium has a thickness of 1 – 2 mm and turns brown when bruised . Per millimeter , there are two to three square pores . When dried , the hymenium 's color becomes pinkish @-@ brown . The hymenium extends slightly down the stipe , and is sharply defined . Dried tissue smells similar to fenugreek . The morphology of the mycorrhiza has not yet been described ; however , as with all other types of Boletopsis it is likely to be ectomycorrhizal . 
 = = = Microscopic characteristics = = = 
 Boletopsis nothofagi has a monomitic hyphal structure , whereby all hyphae are generative hyphae , which serve the growth of the fungus . The cap , when viewed under a microscope , is clearly differentiated and consists of a cutis , a layer of oriented hyphae lying radially . They are up to 2 µm thick , pigmented brown and covered with small , irregularly shaped granules . They become green when stained with potassium hydroxide ( KOH ) , a diagnostic characteristic of the genus . The <unk> consists of swollen hyphae up to 6 µm thick . These are thin @-@ walled , filled with oil droplets and have clamp connections in the septa . The hymenial layer has porous <unk> structures measuring 4 by 80 µm . The basidia of B. nothofagi are <unk> arising on the sides of the hyphae . They are cylindrical to club shaped , 5 – 10 by 20 – 30 µm in size , and clamped at the base . The basidia always have four sterigmata , on which light brown , thin spores are situated . The spores are uneven , with flattened ends and elongated in shape . On average , they measure 5 @.@ 3 by 4 @.@ 1 µm . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 The known range of Boletopsis nothofagi is limited to two narrowly defined areas of New Zealand , one on the North Island and the other on the South Island . These areas are in Rimutaka Forest Park near Wellington , and Saint Arnaud in the northern part of the South Island . These locations are relatively far away from each other and isolated , which , together with its absence in the rest of New Zealand , makes it unlikely that the species is a recent import . It is more likely that the species is native to New Zealand and has been overlooked in earlier surveys due to its rarity . 
 Boletopsis nothofagi is the most southern member of the genus Boletopsis , and as of 2013 the sole known member of the genus in the Southern Hemisphere ; its closest relatives are found in Asia and Costa Rica . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 The occurrence of Boletopsis nothofagi seems to be strongly connected to the occurrence of the southern beech Nothofagus fusca , a species of <unk> that is endemic to New Zealand . B. nothofagi has been found exclusively in N. fusca forests spread through New Zealand below 37 ° S. The fungus forms a mycorrhizal association with the trees of N. fusca , in which the hyphae of the fungal mycelium wrap around the roots of the tree and penetrate the cortex , but not its cells . Subsequently , B. nothofagi takes over the function of the root hair and directs water and soil nutrients to the tree . In return , the fungus can , through contact with the root tissue , access the products of the tree 's photosynthesis . The fruit bodies of the species have so far always been found in May , the end of autumn in the Southern Hemisphere . 
 Little is known about the habitat requirements – such as humidity , temperature , soil composition and water content – of B. nothofagi . However , as the species seems to only occur together with N. fusca , it should largely conform to their demands . The tree species prefers lowlands and hills along river valleys and usually grows on nutrient @-@ rich , well @-@ drained soil . The species is more likely to be found inland than in the coastal regions .

 According to Cooper and Leonard , the fact that Boletopsis nothofagi was only found 200 years after the European settlement of New Zealand illustrates the rarity of this species , although it is also possible that the late discovery was caused by rare or infrequent fructification . The authors assume that the species occurs very sparsely and that this cannot be attributed to human activity . Although no data on population trends or historical distribution of the fungus exists , Cooper and Leonard consider the species in accordance to the New Zealand Threat Classification System as " naturally uncommon " .

 Crime and Punishment ( Russian : <unk> и <unk> , tr . <unk> i <unk> ; IPA : [ <unk> ɪ <unk> ] ) is a novel by the Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky . It was first published in the literary journal The Russian Messenger in twelve monthly installments during 1866 . It was later published in a single volume . It is the second of Dostoyevsky 's full @-@ length novels following his return from 10 years of exile in Siberia . Crime and Punishment is considered the first great novel of his " mature " period of writing . 
 Crime and Punishment focuses on the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Raskolnikov , an impoverished ex @-@ student in St. Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her cash . Raskolnikov , in attempts to defend his actions , argues that with the pawnbroker 's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime , while ridding the world of a vermin . He also commits the murder to test a theory of his that dictates some people are naturally capable of such actions , and even have the right to perform them . Several times throughout the novel , Raskolnikov compares himself with Napoleon Bonaparte and shares his belief that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose . 
 = = Creation = = 
 Dostoyevsky conceived the idea of Crime and Punishment in the summer of 1865 . At the time the author owed large sums of money to creditors , and was trying to help the family of his brother Mikhail , who had died in early 1864 . Projected under the title The Drunkards , it was to deal " with the present question of <unk> ... [ in ] all its ramifications , especially the picture of a family and the bringing up of children in these circumstances , etc . , etc . " Once Dostoyevsky conceived Raskolnikov and his crime , now inspired by the case of Pierre François <unk> , this theme became ancillary , centering on the story of the Marmeladov family . 
 Dostoyevsky offered his story or novella ( at the time Dostoyevsky was not thinking of a novel ) to the publisher Mikhail Katkov , whose monthly journal , The Russian Messenger , was a prestigious publication of its kind , and the outlet for both Ivan Turgenev and Leo Tolstoy . However , Dostoyevsky , having carried on quite bruising polemics with Katkov in early 1860s , had never published anything in its pages . Nonetheless , forced by his situation , after all other appeals elsewhere failed , Dostoyevsky turned as a last resort to Katkov , urging for an advance on a proposed contribution . In a letter to Katkov written in September 1865 , Dostoyevsky explained to him that the work was to be about a young man who yields to " certain strange , ' unfinished ' ideas , yet floating in the air " ; he had thus embarked on his plan to explore the moral and psychological dangers of the ideology of " radicalism " . In letters written in November 1865 an important conceptual change occurred : the " story " has become a " novel " , and from here on all references to Crime and Punishment are to a novel . 
 Dostoyevsky had to race against time , in order to finish on time both The Gambler and Crime and Punishment . Anna <unk> , a stenographer who would soon become his second wife , was a great help for Dostoyevsky during this difficult task . The first part of Crime and Punishment appeared in the January 1866 issue of The Russian Messenger , and the last one was published in December 1866 . 
 In the complete edition of Dostoyevsky 's writings published in the Soviet Union , the editors reassembled and printed the notebooks that the writer kept while working on Crime and Punishment , in a sequence roughly corresponding to the various stages of composition . Because of these labors , there is now a fragmentary working draft of the story , or novella , as initially conceived , as well as two other versions of the text . These have been distinguished as the Wiesbaden edition , the Petersburg edition , and the final plan , involving the shift from a first @-@ person narrator to the indigenous variety of third @-@ person form invented by Dostoyevsky . The Wiesbaden edition concentrates entirely on the moral and psychological reactions of the narrator after the murder . It coincides roughly with the story that Dostoyevsky described in his letter to Katkov , and written in a form of a diary or journal , corresponds to what eventually became part II . 
 Why Dostoyevsky abandoned his initial version remains a matter of speculation . According to Joseph Frank , " one possibility is that his protagonist began to develop beyond the boundaries in which he had first been conceived " . The notebooks indicate that Dostoyevsky was aware of the emergence of new aspects of Raskolnikov 's character as the plot action proceeded , and he structured the novel in conformity with this " metamorphosis , " Frank says . Dostoyevsky thus decided to fuse the story with his previous idea for a novel called The Drunkards . The final version of Crime and Punishment came into being only when , in November 1865 , Dostoyevsky decided to recast his novel in the third person . This shift was the culmination of a long struggle , present through all the early stages of composition . Once having decided , Dostoyevsky began to rewrite from scratch , and was able to easily integrate sections of the early manuscript into the final text — Frank says that he did not , as he told Wrangel , burn everything he had written earlier . 
 The final draft went smoothly , except for a clash with the editors of The Russian Messenger , about which very little is known . Since the manuscript Dostoyevsky turned in to Katkov was lost , it is unclear to what the editors had objected in the original . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Raskolnikov , a conflicted former student , lives in a tiny , rented room in Saint Petersburg . He refuses all help , even from his friend Razumikhin , and devises a plan to murder and to rob an unpleasant elderly pawn @-@ broker and money @-@ lender , Alyona Ivanovna . His motivation comes from the overwhelming sense that he is predetermined to kill the old woman by some power outside of himself . While still considering the plan , Raskolnikov makes the acquaintance of Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov , a drunkard who recently squandered his family 's little wealth . Raskolnikov also receives a letter from his sister and mother , speaking of their coming visit to Saint Petersburg , and his sister 's sudden marriage plans which they plan to discuss upon their arrival . 
 After much deliberation , Raskolnikov sneaks into Alyona Ivanovna 's apartment , where he murders her with an axe . He also kills her half @-@ sister , Lizaveta , who happens to stumble upon the scene of the crime . Shaken by his actions , Raskolnikov manages to steal only a handful of items and a small purse , leaving much of the pawn @-@ broker 's wealth untouched . Raskolnikov then flees and , due to a series of coincidences , manages to leave unseen and undetected . 
 After the bungled murder , Raskolnikov falls into a feverish state and begins to worry obsessively over the murder . He hides the stolen items and purse under a rock , and tries desperately to clean his clothing of any blood or evidence . He falls into a fever later that day , though not before calling briefly on his old friend Razumikhin . As the fever comes and goes in the following days , Raskolnikov behaves as though he wishes to betray himself . He shows strange reactions to whoever mentions the murder of the pawn @-@ broker , which is now known about and talked of in the city . In his delirium , Raskolnikov wanders Saint Petersburg , drawing more and more attention to himself and his relation to the crime . In one of his walks through the city , he sees Marmeladov , who has been struck mortally by a carriage in the streets . Rushing to help him , Raskolnikov gives the remainder of his money to the man 's family , which includes his teenage daughter , Sonya , who has been forced to become a prostitute to support her family . 
 In the meantime , Raskolnikov 's mother , Pulkheria Alexandrovna , and his sister , Avdotya <unk> ( or Dunya ) have arrived in the city . Dunya had been working as a governess for the Svidrigaïlov family until this point , but was forced out of the position by the head of the family , Arkady Ivanovich Svidrigaïlov . Svidrigaïlov , a married man , was attracted to Dunya 's physical beauty and her feminine qualities , and offered her riches and elopement . Mortified , Dunya fled the Svidrigaïlov family and lost her source of income , only to meet Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin , a man of modest income and rank . Luzhin proposes to marry Dunya , thereby securing her and her mother 's financial safety , provided she accept him quickly and without question . It is for these very reasons that the two of them come to Saint Petersburg , both to meet Luzhin there and to obtain Raskolnikov 's approval . Luzhin , however , calls on Raskolnikov while he is in a delirious state and presents himself as a foolish , self @-@ righteous and presumptuous man . Raskolnikov dismisses him immediately as a potential husband for his sister , and realizes that she only accepted him to help her family . 
 As the novel progresses , Raskolnikov is introduced to the detective Porfiry , who begins to suspect him of the murder purely on psychological grounds . At the same time , a chaste relationship develops between Raskolnikov and Sonya . Sonya , though a prostitute , is full of Christian virtue and is only driven into the profession by her family 's poverty . Meanwhile , Razumikhin and Raskolnikov manage to keep Dunya from continuing her relationship with Luzhin , whose true character is exposed to be conniving and base . At this point , Svidrigaïlov appears on the scene , having come from the province to Petersburg , almost solely to seek out Dunya . He reveals that his wife is dead , and that he is willing to pay Dunya a vast sum of money in exchange for nothing . She , upon hearing the news , refuses flat out , suspecting him of treachery . 
 As Raskolnikov and Porfiry continue to meet , Raskolnikov 's motives for the crime become exposed . Porfiry becomes increasingly certain of the man 's guilt , but has no concrete evidence or witnesses with which to back up this suspicion . Furthermore , another man admits to committing the crime under questioning and arrest . However , Raskolnikov 's nerves continue to wear thinner , and he is constantly struggling with the idea of confessing , though he knows that he can never be truly convicted . He turns to Sonya for support and confesses his crime to her . By coincidence , Svidrigaïlov has taken up residence in a room next to Sonya 's and overhears the entire confession . When the two men meet face to face , Svidrigaïlov acknowledges this fact , and suggests that he may use it against him , should he need to . Svidrigaïlov also speaks of his own past , and Raskolnikov grows to suspect that the rumors about his having committed several murders are true . In a later conversation with Dunya , Svidrigaïlov denies that he had a hand in the death of his wife . 
 Raskolnikov is at this point completely torn ; he is urged by Sonya to confess , and Svidrigaïlov 's testimony could potentially convict him . Furthermore , Porfiry confronts Raskolnikov with his suspicions and assures him that confession would substantially lighten his sentence . Meanwhile , Svidrigaïlov attempts to seduce Dunya , but when he realizes that she will never love him , he lets her go . He then spends a night in confusion and in the morning shoots himself . This same morning , Raskolnikov goes again to Sonya , who again urges him to confess and to clear his conscience . He makes his way to the police station , where he is met by the news of Svidrigaïlov 's suicide . He hesitates a moment , thinking again that he might get away with a perfect crime , but is persuaded by Sonya to confess . 
 The epilogue tells of how Raskolnikov is sentenced to eight years of penal servitude in Siberia , where Sonya follows him . Dunya and Razumikhin marry and are left in a happy position by the end of the novel , while Pulkheria , Raskolnikov 's mother , falls ill and dies , unable to cope with her son 's situation . Raskolnikov himself struggles in Siberia . It is only after some time in prison that his redemption and moral regeneration begin under Sonya 's loving influence . 
 = = Characters = = 
 In Crime and Punishment , Dostoyevsky fuses the personality of his main character , Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov , with his new anti @-@ radical ideological themes . The main plot involves a murder as the result of " ideological intoxication , " and depicts all the disastrous moral and psychical consequences that result from the murder . Raskolnikov 's psychology is placed at the center , and carefully interwoven with the ideas behind his transgression ; every other feature of the novel illuminates the agonizing dilemma in which Raskolnikov is caught . From another point of view , the novel 's plot is another variation of a conventional nineteenth @-@ century theme : an innocent young provincial comes to seek his fortune in the capital , where he succumbs to corruption , and loses all traces of his former freshness and purity . However , as Gary <unk> points out , " Raskolnikov succumbs not to the temptations of high society as Honoré de Balzac 's Rastignac or Stendhal 's Julien Sorel , but to those of rationalistic Petersburg " . 
 Raskolnikov ( Rodion ) is the protagonist , and the novel focuses primarily on his perspective . A 23 @-@ year @-@ old man and former student , now destitute , Raskolnikov is described in the novel as " exceptionally handsome , above the average in height , slim , well built , with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair . " Perhaps the most striking feature of Raskolnikov , however , is his dual personality . On the one hand , he is cold , apathetic , and antisocial ; on the other , he can be surprisingly warm and compassionate . He commits murder as well as acts of compulsive charity . His chaotic interaction with the external world and his nihilistic worldview might be seen as causes of his social alienation or consequences of it . 
 Despite its title , the novel does not so much deal with the crime and its formal punishment , as with Raskolnikov 's internal struggle ( the book shows that his punishment results more from his conscience than from the law ) . Believing society would be better for it , Raskolnikov commits murder with the idea that he possessed enough intellectual and emotional fortitude to deal with the ramifications , [ based on his paper / thesis , " On Crime " , that he is a Napoleon ] , but his sense of guilt soon overwhelms him to the point of psychological and somatic illness . It is only in the epilogue that he realizes his formal punishment , having decided to confess and end his alienation from society . 
 <unk> <unk> Marmeladova , variously called Sonya and <unk> , is the daughter of a drunkard named Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov , whom Raskolnikov meets in a tavern at the beginning of the novel . She is often characterized as self @-@ sacrificial , shy , and even innocent despite the fact that she is compelled into prostitution to help her family . She also , as Raskolnikov discerns , shares the same feelings of shame and alienation as he does and becomes the first person to whom Raskolnikov confesses his crime , and she supports him even though she was friends with one of the victims ( Lizaveta ) . Throughout the novel , Sonya is an important source of moral strength and rehabilitation for Raskolnikov , and in some interpretations , even considered a Christ @-@ like figure . She is forced to prostitute herself to provide for her family , leading some critics to make comparisons with Mary Magdalene . 
 Avdotya <unk> <unk> – Raskolnikov 's dominant and sympathetic sister , called Dunya or <unk> for short . She initially plans to marry the wealthy , yet smug and self @-@ possessed , Luzhin , to free the family from financial destitution . She has a habit of pacing across the room while thinking . She is followed to Saint Petersburg by the disturbed <unk> , who seeks to win her back through blackmail . She rejects both men in favour of Raskolnikov 's loyal friend , Razumikhin . 
 Pulkheria Alexandrovna <unk> – Raskolnikov 's relatively clueless , hopeful and loving mother . Following Raskolnikov 's sentence , she falls ill ( mentally and physically ) and eventually dies . She hints in her dying stages that she is slightly more aware of her son 's fate , which was hidden from her by Dunya and Razumikhin . 
 Dmitry <unk> <unk> , often referred to as Razumikhin , is Raskolnikov 's loyal friend and also a former law student . In terms of Razumikhin 's contribution to Dostoyevsky 's anti @-@ radical thematics , he is intended to represent something of a reconciliation of the pervasive thematic conflict between faith and reason . The fact that the name Razumikhin means " reason " shows Dostoyevsky 's desire to employ this faculty as a foundational basis for his Christian faith in God . 
 Other characters of the novel are : 
 Praskovya Pavlovna <unk> – Raskolnikov 's landlady ( called <unk> ) . Shy and retiring , Praskovya Pavlovna does not figure prominently in the course of events . Raskolnikov had been engaged to her daughter , a sickly girl who had died , and Praskovya Pavlovna had granted him extensive credit on the basis of this engagement and a promissory note for 115 roubles . She had then handed this note to a court councillor named <unk> , who had claimed the note , causing Raskolnikov to be summoned to the police station the day after his crime . 
 Porfiry Petrovich – The head of the Investigation Department in charge of solving the murders of Lizaveta and Alyona Ivanovna , who , along with Sonya , moves Raskolnikov towards confession . Unlike Sonya , however , Porfiry does this through psychological games . Despite the lack of evidence , he becomes certain Raskolnikov is the murderer following several conversations with him , but gives him the chance to confess voluntarily . He attempts to confuse and to provoke the unstable Raskolnikov in an attempt to coerce him to confess . According to the creators of the TV series Columbo ( William Link and Richard Levinson ) , the title character was based on Porfiry . 
 Arkady Ivanovich Svidrigaïlov – Sensual , depraved , and wealthy former employer and current pursuer of Dunya , Svidrigaïlov is suspected of multiple acts of murder , and overhears Raskolnikov 's confessions to Sonya . With this knowledge he torments both Dunya and Raskolnikov but does not inform the police . When Dunya tells him she could never love him ( after attempting to shoot him ) he lets her go and commits suicide . Despite his apparent malevolence , Svidrigaïlov is similar to Raskolnikov in regard to his random acts of charity . He fronts the money for the Marmeladov children to enter an orphanage ( after both their parents die ) , gives Sonya five percent bank notes totalling three thousand rubles , and leaves the rest of his money to his juvenile fiancée . There is an interesting fact : Svidrigaïlov has blue eyes ; blue color in Russian culture symbolizes purity , kindness , and innocence , implying that Svidrigaïlov is a good person beneath his philandering exterior . ( It is noteworthy that Sonya also has blue eyes . ) 
 Marfa Petrovna <unk> – Arkady Svidrigaïlov 's deceased wife , whom he is suspected of having murdered , and who he claims has visited him as a ghost . Her bequest of 3 @,@ 000 rubles to Dunya allows Dunya to reject Luzhin as a suitor . 
 Katerina Ivanovna Marmeladova – Semyon Marmeladov 's consumptive and ill @-@ tempered second wife , stepmother to Sonya . She drives Sonya into prostitution in a fit of rage , but later regrets it , and beats her children mercilessly , but works ferociously to improve their standard of living . She is obsessed with demonstrating that slum life is far below her station . Following Marmeladov 's death , she uses Raskolnikov 's money to hold a funeral . She later succumbs to her illness . The character is partially based on Polina <unk> . 
 Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov – Hopeless drunk who indulges in his own suffering , and father of Sonya . Marmeladov could be seen as a Russian equivalent of the character of <unk> in Charles Dickens ' novel , David Copperfield . 
 Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin – A well @-@ off lawyer who is engaged to Raskolnikov 's sister Dunya in the beginning of the novel . His motives for the marriage are rather despicable , as he states more or less that he chose her since she will be completely beholden to him financially . 
 Andrey Semyonovich <unk> – Luzhin 's utopian socialist and feminist roommate who witnesses his attempt to frame Sonya and subsequently exposes him . He is proven right by Raskolnikov , the only one knowing of Luzhin 's motives . 
 Alyona Ivanovna – Suspicious old pawnbroker who hoards money and is merciless to her patrons . She is Raskolnikov 's intended target , and he kills her in the beginning of the book . 
 Lizaveta Ivanovna – Alyona 's handicapped , innocent and submissive sister . Raskolnikov murders her when she walks in immediately after Raskolnikov had killed Alyona . Lizaveta was a friend of Sonya . 
 <unk> ( <unk> ) – A friend of Razumikhin and a doctor who cared for Raskolnikov . 
 <unk> Petrovna ( <unk> <unk> ) – Raskolnikov 's landlady 's servant who often brings Raskolnikov food and drink . 
 <unk> <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) – The amiable chief of police . 
 Ilya Petrovich ( <unk> <unk> ) – A police official and <unk> 's assistant , nicknamed " Gunpowder " for his very bad temper . 
 Alexander <unk> Zamyotov ( Александр <unk> <unk> ) – Head clerk at the police station and friend to Razumikhin . Raskolnikov arouses Zamyotov 's suspicions by explaining how he , Raskolnikov , would have committed various crimes , although Zamyotov later apologizes , believing , much to Raskolnikov 's amusement , that it was all a farce to expose how ridiculous the suspicions were . 
 Nikolai <unk> ( Николай <unk> ) – A self @-@ sacrificial painter and sectarian who admits to the murder , since his sect holds it to be supremely virtuous to suffer for another person 's crime . 
 Polina <unk> Marmeladova ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) – Ten @-@ year @-@ old adopted daughter of Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov and younger stepsister to Sonya , sometimes known as <unk> . 
 = = Structure = = 
 Crime and Punishment has a distinct beginning , middle and end . The novel is divided into six parts , with an epilogue . The notion of " intrinsic duality " in Crime and Punishment has been commented upon , with the suggestion that there is a degree of symmetry to the book . Edward <unk> who has argued that Dostoyevsky was a skilled craftsman , highly conscious of the formal pattern in his art , has likened the structure of Crime and Punishment to a " flattened X " , saying : 
 Parts I @-@ III [ of Crime and Punishment ] present the predominantly rational and proud Raskolnikov : Parts IV @-@ VI , the emerging " irrational " and humble Raskolnikov . The first half of the novel shows the progressive death of the first ruling principle of his character ; the last half , the progressive birth of the new ruling principle . The point of change comes in the very middle of the novel . 
 This compositional balance is achieved by means of the symmetrical distribution of certain key episodes throughout the novel 's six parts . The recurrence of these episodes in the two halves of the novel , as David Bethea has argued , is organized according to a mirror @-@ like principle , whereby the " left " half of the novel reflects the " right " half . For her part , Margaret Church discerns a contrapuntal structuring : parts I , III and V deal largely with the main hero 's relationship to his family ( mother , sister and mother surrogates ) , while parts II , IV and VI deal with his relationship to the authorities of the state " and to various father figures " . 
 The seventh part of the novel , the Epilogue , has attracted much attention and controversy . Some of Dostoyevsky 's critics have criticized the novel 's final pages as superfluous , anti @-@ climactic , unworthy of the rest of the work , while others have rushed to the defense of the Epilogue , offering various ingenious schemes which conclusively prove its inevitability and necessity . Steven <unk> argues that Crime and Punishment " is formally two distinct but closely related , things , namely a particular type of tragedy in the classical Greek mold and a Christian resurrection tale " . <unk> concludes that " the logical demands of the tragic model as such are satisfied without the Epilogue in Crime and Punishment ... At the same time , this tragedy contains a Christian component , and the logical demands of this element are met only by the resurrection promised in the Epilogue " . 
 Crime and Punishment is written from a third @-@ person omniscient perspective . It is <unk> primarily from the point of view of Raskolnikov ; however , it does at times switch to the perspective of <unk> , Razumikhin , Peter Petrovich , or Dunya . This narrative technique , which fuses the narrator very closely with the consciousness and point of view of the central characters of the plot , was original for its period . Franks notes that his identification , through Dostoyevsky 's use of the time shifts of memory and his manipulation of temporal sequence , begins to approach the later experiments of Henry James , Joseph Conrad , Virginia Woolf , and James Joyce . A late nineteenth @-@ century reader was , however , accustomed to more orderly and linear types of expository narration . This led to the persistence of the legend that Dostoyevsky was an untidy and negligent craftsman and to critical observations like the following by Melchior de <unk> : 
 A word ... one does not even notice , a small fact that takes up only a line , have their reverberations fifty pages later ... [ so that ] the continuity becomes unintelligible if one skips a couple of pages . 
 Dostoevsky uses different speech mannerisms and sentences of different length for different characters . Those who use artificial language — Luzhin , for example — are identified as unattractive people . Mrs. Marmeladov 's disintegrating mind is reflected in her language , too . In the original Russian text , the names of the major characters have something of a double meaning , but in translation the subtlety of the Russian language is predominately lost due to major differences in the language structure and culture . For example , the original title ( " <unk> и <unk> " ) is not the direct equivalent to the English . " <unk> " is literally translated as a stepping across . The physical image of crime as a crossing over a barrier or a boundary is lost in translation . So is the religious implication of transgression , which in English refers to a sin rather than a crime . 
 = = Symbolism = = 
 = = = Dreams = = = 
 Raskolnikov 's dreams have a symbolic meaning , which suggests a psychological view . The dream of the mare being whipped has been suggested as the fullest single expression of the whole novel , symbolizing gratification and punishment , contemptible motives and contemptible society , depicting the nihilistic destruction of an unfit mare , the gratification therein , and Rodion 's disgust and horror , as an example of his conflicted character . Raskolnikov 's disgust and horror is central to the theme of his conflicted character , his guilty conscience , his contempt for society , his rationality of himself as an extraordinary man above greater society , holding authority to kill , and his concept of justified murder . His reaction is pivotal , provoking his first taking of life toward the rationalization of himself as above greater society . The dream is later mentioned when Raskolnikov talks to Marmeladov . Marmeladov 's daughter , morally chaste and devout Sonya , must earn a living as a prostitute for their impoverished family , the result of his alcoholism . The dream is also a warning , foreshadowing an impending murder and holds several comparisons to his murder of the pawnbroker . The dream occurs after Rodion crosses a bridge leading out of the oppressive heat and dust of Petersburg and into the fresh greenness of the islands . This symbolizes a corresponding mental crossing , suggesting that Raskolnikov is returning to a state of clarity when he has the dream . In it , he returns to the innocence of his childhood and watches as a group of peasants beat an old mare to death . After Raskolnikov awakes , he reflects on it as a “ such a hideous dream , ” the same term he earlier used to describe his plot to kill the old woman ( 62 ) . This diction draws a parallel between the two , suggesting that the child represents the part of him that clings to morality and watches horrified as another facet , represented by the peasants , is driven by hardship and isolation to become cold and unfeeling . The constant laughing of the peasants in the face of brutal slaughter reveals the extent to which they have been desensitized by their suffering , which is a reflection of Raskolnikov ’ s own condition . This interpretation is further supported by fact that the main peasant , <unk> , feels that he has the right to kill the horse , linking his actions to Raskolnikov ’ s theory justifying murder for a select group of extraordinary men . The comparison between the cruel slaughter of the old mare and the plan to murder Alyona Ivanovna delineates the brutality of Raskolnikov ’ s crime , which is often downplayed by his habitual dehumanizing referral to the old woman as simply a “ louse . ” While awake , Raskolnikov ’ s view of the old woman is spiteful , defined by his tenacious belief in his extraordinary man theory . However , the dream acts as a conduit for Raskolnikov ’ s subconscious , and without the constraints of his theory the horrific nature of his crime becomes apparent . Therefore , in order for Raskolnikov to find redemption , he must ultimately renounce his theory . In the final pages , Raskolnikov , who at this point is in the prison infirmary , has a feverish dream about a plague of nihilism , that enters Russia and Europe from the east and which spreads senseless dissent ( Raskolnikov 's name alludes to " <unk> " , dissent ) and fanatic dedication to " new ideas " : it finally engulfs all of mankind . Though we don 't learn anything about the content of these ideas they clearly disrupt society forever and are seen as exclusively critical assaults on ordinary thinking : it is clear that Dostoyevsky was envisaging the new , politically and culturally nihilist ideas which were entering Russian literature and society in this watershed decade and with which Dostoyevsky would be in debate for the rest of his life ( cp . Chernyshevsky 's What Is to Be Done ? , <unk> 's abrasive journalism , Turgenev 's Fathers and Sons and Dostoyevsky 's own The Possessed ) . Janko <unk> , who took part in the revolutions of the World War I era , knew Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky and many others , and later would spend years writing and researching on Dostoyevsky and other Russian classics , called this final dream " prophetic in its symbolism " . 
 = = = Cross = = = 
 Sonya gives <unk> a cross when he goes to turn himself in and symbolizes the burden Raskolnikov must bear . Sonya tells him they will bear the cross together and is taking part of his burden onto herself , encouraging him to confess . Sonya and Lizaveta had exchanged crosses , so originally the cross was Lizaveta 's — whom <unk> didn 't intend to kill , making it an important symbol of redemption . Sonya 's face reminds him of Lizaveta 's face , another example of his guilty conscience and symbolizes a shared grief . Self @-@ sacrifice , along with poverty , is a larger theme of the novel . The desperation of poverty creates a situation where the only way to survive is through self @-@ sacrifice , which Raskolnikov consistently rejects , as part of his philosophical reasoning . For example , he rejects Razumikhin 's offer of employment and the idea of his sister 's arranged marriage . Raskolnikov originally rejects Sonya 's offer to accompany him to the confession but , in a feverish state of mind , sees her following him through the market , and finds power in that idealism . 
 = = = Twice Two is Four = = = 
 A certain detail that comes up in the novel is whether we are limited to certain realities , such as 2 + 2 = 4 , a theme that also comes up in Yevgeny <unk> 's We and George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty @-@ Four . 
 = = = The environment of Saint Petersburg = = = 
 On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of the garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly , as though in hesitation , towards K. bridge . 
 The above opening sentence of the novel has a symbolic function : Russian critic Vadim K. <unk> argues that the reference to the " exceptionally hot evening " establishes not only the suffocating atmosphere of Saint Petersburg in midsummer but also " the infernal ambience of the crime itself " . Dostoyevsky was among the first to recognize the symbolic possibilities of city life and imagery drawn from the city . I. F. I. <unk> regards Crime and Punishment as the first great Russian novel " in which the climactic moments of the action are played out in dirty taverns , on the street , in the sordid black rooms of the poor " . 
 Dostoyevsky 's Petersburg is the city of unrelieved poverty ; " magnificence has no place in it , because magnificence is external , formal abstract , cold " . Dostoyevsky connects the city 's problems to Raskolnikov 's thoughts and subsequent actions . The crowded streets and squares , the shabby houses and taverns , the noise and stench , all are transformed by Dostoyevsky into a rich store of metaphors for states of mind . Donald <unk> asserts that " the real city ... rendered with a striking concreteness , is also a city of the mind in the way that its atmosphere answers Raskolnikov 's state and almost symbolizes it . It is crowded , stifling , and parched . " The inner turmoil suffered by Raskolnikov can also be perceived as a Shakespearean pathetic fallacy . For example , the great storm in Shakespeare 's King Lear reflects the state of the titular character 's mind , much like the chaos , disorder and noise of St. Petersburg reflects the state of Raskolnikov 's mind .

 The colour yellow is used throughout the novel to signify suffering and mental illness .

Of note , the Russian term for lunatic asylum , " <unk> dom " , is literally translated as " yellow house " . Yellow is also mentioned as the color of <unk> 's ring . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Dostoyevsky 's letter to Katkov reveals his immediate inspiration , to which he remained faithful even after his original plan evolved into a much more ambitious creation : a desire to counteract what he regarded as nefarious consequences arising from the doctrines of Russian nihilism . In the novel , Dostoyevsky pinpointed the dangers of both utilitarianism and rationalism , the main ideas of which inspired the radicals , continuing a fierce criticism he had already started with his Notes from Underground . A <unk> religious believer , Dostoyevsky utilized the characters , dialogue and narrative in Crime and Punishment to articulate an argument against <unk> ideas in general . He thus attacked a peculiar Russian blend of French utopian socialism and <unk> utilitarianism , which had led to what revolutionaries , such as Nikolai Chernyshevsky , called " rational egoism " . 
 The radicals refused , however , to recognize themselves in the novel 's pages ( Dimitri Pisarev ridiculed the notion that Raskolnikov 's ideas could be identified with those of the radicals of his time ) , since Dostoyevsky pursued nihilistic ideas to their most extreme consequences . The aim of these ideas was altruistic and humanitarian , but these aims were to be achieved by relying on reason and suppressing entirely the spontaneous outflow of Christian pity and compassion . Chernyshevsky 's utilitarian ethic proposed that thought and will in Man were subject to the laws of physical science . Dostoyevsky believed that such ideas limited man to a product of physics , chemistry and biology , negating spontaneous emotional responses . In its latest variety of <unk> , Russian nihilism encouraged the creation of an élite of superior individuals to whom the hopes of the future were to be entrusted . 
 Raskolnikov exemplifies all the potentially disastrous hazards contained in such an ideal . Frank notes that " the moral @-@ psychological traits of his character incorporate this <unk> between instinctive kindness , sympathy , and pity on the one hand and , on the other , a proud and idealistic egoism that has become perverted into a contemptuous disdain for the submissive herd " . Raskolnikov 's inner conflict in the opening section of the novel results in a utilitarian @-@ altruistic justification for the proposed crime : why not kill a wretched and " useless " old moneylender to alleviate the human misery ? Dostoyevsky wants to show that this utilitarian type of reasoning and its conclusions had become widespread and commonplace ; they were by no means the solitary invention of Raskolnikov 's tormented and disordered mind . Such radical and utilitarian ideas act to reinforce the innate egoism of Raskolnikov 's character and , likewise , contempt for the lower qualities in Man and for His ideals . He even becomes fascinated with the majestic image of a Napoleonic personality who , in the interests of a higher social good , believes that he possesses a moral right to kill . Indeed , his " Napoleon @-@ like " plan drags him to a well @-@ calculated murder , the ultimate conclusion of his self @-@ deception with utilitarianism . 
 In his depiction of the Petersburg background , Dostoyevsky accentuates the squalor and human wretchedness that pass before Raskolnikov 's eyes . He also uses Raskolnikov 's encounter with Marmeladov to present both the heartlessness of Raskolnikov 's convictions and the alternative set of values to be set against them . Dostoyevsky believes that the " freedom " propounded by the aforementioned ideas is a dreadful freedom " that is contained by no values , because it is before values " . The product of this " freedom " , Raskolnikov , is in perpetual revolt against society , himself , and God . He thinks that he is self @-@ sufficient and self @-@ contained , but at the end " his boundless self @-@ confidence must disappear in the face of what is greater than himself , and his self @-@ fabricated justification must humble itself before the higher justice of God " . Dostoyevsky calls for the regeneration and renewal of the " sick " Russian society through the re @-@ discovering of its country , its religion , and its roots . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The first part of Crime and Punishment published in the January and February issues of The Russian Messenger met with public success . Although the remaining parts of the novel had still to be written , an anonymous reviewer wrote that " the novel promises to be one of the most important works of the author of The House of the Dead " . In his memoirs , the conservative <unk> Nikolay <unk> recalled that in Russia Crime and Punishment was the literary sensation of 1866 . 
 The novel soon attracted the criticism of the liberal and radical critics . <unk> <unk> sprang to the defense of the Russian student corporations , and wondered , " Has there ever been a case of a student committing murder for the sake of robbery ? " Pisarev , aware of the novel 's artistic value attempted in 1867 another approach : he argued that Raskolnikov was a product of his environment , and explained that the main theme of the work was poverty and its results . He measured the novel 's excellence by the accuracy and understanding with which Dostoyevsky portrayed the contemporary social reality , and focused on what he regarded as inconsistencies in the novel 's plot . <unk> rejected Pisarev 's contention that the theme of environmental determinism was essential to the novel , and pointed out that Dostoyevsky 's attitude towards his hero was sympathetic : " This is not mockery of the younger generation , neither a reproach nor an accusation — it is a lament over it .

 = Maraba coffee = 
 Maraba coffee ( Kinyarwanda : <unk> ya Maraba ; French : Café de Maraba ) is grown in the Maraba area of southern Rwanda . 
 Maraba 's coffee plants are the Bourbon variety of the Coffea arabica species and are grown on fertile volcanic soils on high @-@ altitude hills . The fruit is handpicked , mostly during the rainy season between March and May , and brought to a washing station in Maraba , where the coffee beans are extracted and dried . At several stages , the beans are sorted according to quality . The farmers receive credits based on the amount and quality of the beans they provide . 
 The beans are sold to various roasting companies , with the best beans going to Union Coffee Roasters of the United Kingdom , who produce a Fairtrade @-@ certified brand and Community Coffee of the United States . Rwanda Specialty Coffee Roasters buys from Maraba and sells to the domestic market . Maraba coffee is also brewed into a beer . 
 About 2 @,@ 000 <unk> farmers grow the coffee plants under the Abahuzamugambi cooperative , founded in 1999 . Since 2000 , the cooperative has been supported by the National University of Rwanda ( NUR ) and the PEARL . The cooperative has improved coffee quality and penetrated the speciality market . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 Rwandans have been growing coffee since colonial times , but until 1999 the product was classed below Grade C , making it unsalable on the global markets . The farmers did not have the means to wash and prepare their coffee cherries to specifications in a timely manner . Buyers paid US $ 0 @.@ 33 per kilogram , a price that kept the farmers poor . 
 In 1999 , 220 coffee growers formed an association in the Maraba district ( part of the former Butare Province ) to tackle this problem . Many of these farmers had lost family members during the 1994 genocide , while others had husbands in prison , accused of participating in the killings and due to face trial in the traditional <unk> courts . They named the association Abahuzamugambi , a Kinyarwanda word for people who work together to achieve a goal . The farmers hoped that by forming the association , they would increase revenue by selling directly to exporters in Kigali instead of through an intermediary transport company . They divided their profits and used them to buy tools , fertilisers and seeds to increase yields . 
 In 2000 , the mayor of Maraba requested development aid from the National University of Rwanda ( UNR ) , based in nearby Butare ; the following year UNR helped found the Partnership for Enhancing Agriculture in Rwanda through <unk> ( PEARL ) . Several entities supported the PEARL project : USAID , Michigan State University , Texas A & M University and various Rwandan bodies including UNR , the national agricultural research institute ( <unk> ) and the Kigali Institute of Science , Technology and Management ( <unk> ) . PEARL started working with Abahuzamugambi in February 2001 to improve the coffee quality to standards required by the specialty coffee market in the United States . 
 The coffee farmers of Maraba first needed a washing station to remove sugar from the coating of the coffee bean , under the skin . If this sugar is not removed within 12 hours of picking , the flavour of the coffee is impaired . They built the first station in July 2001 in the <unk> sector , close to the main road , with funding from UNR , the Office des Cultures <unk> du Rwanda ( <unk> @-@ Café ) , <unk> / VOCA , and the Institut des Sciences <unk> du Rwanda ( <unk> ) . The opening was late in the harvest season , so only 200 kilograms ( 441 lb ) of that year 's harvest were suitable for washing . However , the results were reasonably good , and the station was upgraded to allow more coffee to be processed in 2002 . To bring mineral water from Mount Huye to the upgraded station , <unk> / VOCA helped fund a pipeline , which opened in March 2002 . 
 A new certification system was introduced for the 2002 harvest to ensure that beans brought to the station were of suitable quality . Around half of the Abahuzamugambi membership attained the certification , which allowed the cooperative to look for serious buyers in the specialty markets of Europe and North America . 
 = = = International acceptance = = = 
 PEARL brought a specialty coffee expert to Rwanda , who put them in touch with a seller , Louisiana @-@ based Community Coffee , to help market Maraba . They sent samples to Louisiana , and in June 2002 a representative from Community visited Maraba . Rwandan president Paul Kagame was also present , as the government placed great importance on the project . Community purchased an 18 @,@ 000 kilogram ( 40 @,@ 000 lb ) container of Maraba beans at the above @-@ average rate of US $ 3 per kilogram . The beans were transported to Louisiana , where they were roasted and blended into one of the company 's gourmet coffees . This was the first direct contract between an American roaster and an African coffee cooperative . 
 Comic Relief also took an interest in Maraba . The 2001 Red Nose Day campaign had brought in £ 55 million for projects in the UK and Africa , some of which they pledged to the Association des <unk> du Genocide ( <unk> ) , an association of widows of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide . The charity discovered that many of the Maraba smallholders were also members of <unk> and could thus provide funding and support . They contacted Union Coffee Roasters ( UCR ) , a British roasting company , whose representatives visited Maraba in 2002 with officials from the Fairtrade Labelling Organisation ( <unk> ) . This group inspected the Maraba site and granted certification , making Maraba coffee the first Rwandan cooperative to gain Fairtrade status . UCR described the coffee as containing " sparkling citrus flavours complemented by deep , sweet chocolate notes " and bought all the remaining produce from the 2002 harvest . 
 UCR distributed its Maraba Coffee in early 2003 via Sainsbury 's supermarkets , which sold the product in all 350 of its stores in the run up to that year 's Red Nose Day . In 2003 , the Abahuzamugambi Cooperative made US $ 35 @,@ 000 in net profits . Of this , 70 percent was divided among the farmers at US $ 0 @.@ 75 per kilogram provided , an amount more than three times that paid to other coffee growers in Rwanda and sufficient to pay for health care and education services which were not previously affordable . The remaining 30 percent was invested back into the cooperative and spent on buying calcium carbonate , an agricultural lime used to reduce acidity in the soil caused by run off of minerals during rainfall . 
 = = = Recent years : independence and coffee beer = = = 
 Beginning in 2003 , PEARL deemed the operation self @-@ sufficient and reduced financial support for the Abahuzamugambi Cooperative . The cooperative provided its growers with loans that helped improve living standards and allowed for livestock investments , affordable medical insurance , and education . A cooperative bank was opened in the village in March , enabling farmers to maintain and manage their own funds locally , rather than having to trek the long distance to Butare . 
 In late 2004 , London @-@ based Meantime Brewing began offering a coffee beer made out of beans grown in Maraba . The drink is intended as an alcoholic iced <unk> or <unk> . The head brewer tasted coffees from around the world but decided that the hints of vanilla and chocolate in Maraba coffee made it more suitable than the nutty and bitter coffees from South America . The original beer had an alcohol content of 4 percent and the same caffeine content as coffee , and was described as having a " silky , velvety character " . It is sold in larger branches of Sainsbury 's and in some pubs and clubs . The beverage was one of only two Fairtrade beers available on the UK market until 2006 , when a reduction in the proportion of coffee and an increased alcohol content ( now 6 percent ) cost it its Fairtrade status . It is still made from Maraba beans . It is the only coffee beer available in the British Isles , and it won the Gold medal for the coffee @-@ flavoured beer category at the 2006 Beer World Cup . 
 In 2006 , the Swedish Minister for Development Co @-@ operation and Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs , Carin <unk> , visited Maraba to extend cooperation between Sweden and Rwanda and expose Maraba coffee to the Swedish specialty market . In July 2006 , a <unk> was opened in Maraba under the coordination of PEARL . USAID , NUR and Washington State University ( WSU ) Extension 's Center to Bridge the Digital Divide ( <unk> ) provided funding and resources . Three WSU students spent six weeks in Rwanda helping to set up the centre and train the local staff , who now operate it . 
 = = Geography and climate = = 
 Maraba coffee is grown in the south of Rwanda at coordinates 2 ° 35 ′ S 29 ° 40 ′ E , roughly 12 kilometres ( 7 mi ) from Butare and 150 kilometres ( 93 mi ) from the capital , Kigali . The project began in the Maraba District of Butare Province , but these entities were replaced under local government organisation in 2006 , and the area is now part of Huye District in the Southern Province . The area is very hilly , due to its proximity to the Western Rift Valley and the montane Nyungwe Forest , and features rich volcanic soils . The coffee is grown at altitudes between 1 @,@ 700 and 2 @,@ 100 metres ( 5 @,@ 577 – 6 @,@ 889 ft ) above sea level , often on steep hillsides with terrace farming . The area experiences an average of 115 centimetres ( 45 in ) of rainfall annually . The majority of this falls during the rainy season of March to May , the major coffee harvesting season . The high altitude lowers the temperature slightly to an average of about 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) . There is little seasonal variation . 
 = = Production cycle = = 
 The main harvesting season for coffee in Rwanda is during the major rainy season , running from March to the end of May . At harvest time , farmers spend most of the day picking cherries by hand . In the evening , they carry them in traditional baskets woven from banana leaves to the washing station , which may be several hours away . Technicians hand @-@ sort the beans to pick out the best cherries , those with a deep red colour , and return the remainder to the grower to be sold on to markets outside the Maraba process at a lower price . The technicians pay the grower US $ 0 @.@ 10 per kilogram . This money accumulates , and the association pays it each fortnight into farmers ' bank accounts . 
 The technicians start the washing process immediately , since delay can cause fermentation of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination of the coffee flavour . The beans are first thrown into a deep tank . The best cherries sink to the bottom and pass through a machine that removes their skin . The technicians remove any floating cherries and process them in the same way as the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than specialty @-@ coffee price . The beans are fed through one of the cooperative 's three de @-@ skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating colander . The colander separates the very highest quality Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B ; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient . This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality , with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types . The beans are kept submerged , two days for the best and 15 – 20 hours for the lesser beans , which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder of the sugar without significantly impairing the flavour . 
 The technicians wash the beans several times to remove the remains of the skin and coating and put them out on shaded racks to dry . Cooperative employees turn the beans regularly as technicians spot and remove bad beans . A longer drying process of up to two weeks in the sun follows ( with provision for quick covering in the event of rain ) , again with constant turning . This last process reduces the water content of the bean from 40 percent to 12 percent . 
 The technicians then move the beans to the technical centre in nearby <unk> . Certain machines , housed in a warehouse up the side of the hill , remove the parchment skins from the beans . Employees take the beans into the adjacent laboratory for the final quality control process – hand sorting – which is carried out by several experienced women . The beans are bagged and labeled according to their quality , and stored in the compound 's warehouse to await sale .

 As of 2006 , Maraba produces 80 short tons ( 73 @,@ 000 kg ) of export @-@ quality coffee per year , of which 40 tons go to roasters and sellers in the United Kingdom and 40 tons to the United States .

 = William Howe , 5th Viscount Howe = 
 General William Howe , 5th Viscount Howe , KB , PC ( 10 August 1729 – 12 July 1814 ) was a British Army officer who rose to become Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of British forces during the American War of Independence . Howe was one of three brothers who had distinguished military careers . 
 Having joined the army in 1746 , Howe saw extensive service in the War of the Austrian Succession and Seven Years ' War . He became known for his role in the capture of Quebec in 1759 when he led a British force to capture the cliffs at Anse @-@ au @-@ Foulon , allowing James Wolfe to land his army and engage the French in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham . Howe also participated in the campaigns to take Louisbourg , Belle Île and Havana . He was appointed Lieutenant @-@ Governor of the Isle of Wight , a post he would hold until 1795 . 
 Howe was sent to North America in March 1775 , arriving in May after the American War of Independence broke out . After leading British troops to a costly victory in the Battle of Bunker Hill , Howe took command of all British forces in America from Thomas Gage in September of that year . Howe 's record in North America was marked by the successful capture of both New York City and Philadelphia . However , poor British campaign planning for 1777 contributed to the failure of John Burgoyne 's Saratoga campaign , which played a major role in the entry of France into the war . Howe 's role in developing those plans and the degree to which he was responsible for British failures that year ( despite his personal success at Philadelphia ) have both been subjects of contemporary and historic debate . 
 He resigned his post as Commander in Chief , North America , in 1778 , and returned to England , where he was at times active in the defence of the British Isles . He served for many years in Parliament , and was knighted after his successes in 1776 . He inherited the <unk> of Howe upon the death of his brother Richard in 1799 . He married , but had no children , and the viscountcy was extinguished with his death in 1814 . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 William Howe was born in England , the third son of Emanuel Howe , 2nd Viscount Howe and Charlotte , the daughter of Sophia von <unk> , Countess of Leinster and Darlington , an acknowledged illegitimate half @-@ sister of King George I. His mother was a regular in the courts of George II and George III . This connection with the crown may have improved the careers of all four sons , but all were also very capable officers . His father was a politician , who served as Governor of Barbados where he died in 1735 . William 's eldest brother , General George Howe , was killed just before the 1758 Battle of Carillon at Fort Ticonderoga . Another brother , Admiral Richard Howe , rose to become one of Britain 's leading naval commanders . A third brother , Thomas , commanded ships for the East India Company , Winchelsea in 1762 – 4 and Nottingham in 1766 , and made observations on Madeira and on the Comoro Islands . 
 William entered the army when he was 17 by buying a cornet 's commission in the Duke of Cumberland 's Dragoons in 1746 . He then served for two years in Flanders during the War of the Austrian Succession . After the war he was transferred to the 20th Regiment of Foot , where he became a friend of James Wolfe . 
 = = Seven Years ' War = = 
 During the Seven Years ' War Howe 's service first brought him to America , and did much to raise his reputation . He joined the newly formed 58th ( <unk> ) Regiment of Foot in February 1757 , and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in December of that year . He commanded the regiment at the Siege of Louisbourg in 1758 , leading an amphibious landing under heavy enemy fire . This action won the attackers a flanking position and earned Howe a commendation from Wolfe . 
 Howe commanded a light infantry battalion under General Wolfe during the 1759 Siege of Quebec . He was in the Battle of Beaufort , and was chosen by Wolfe to lead the ascent from the Saint Lawrence River up to the Plains of Abraham that led to the British victory in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham on 13 September 1759 . After spending the winter in the defence of Quebec City , his regiment fought in the April 1760 Battle of Sainte @-@ Foy , and led a brigade in the capture of Montreal under Jeffery Amherst before returning to England . Howe led a brigade in the 1761 Capture of Belle Île , off the French coast , and turned down the opportunity to become military governor after its capture so that he might continue in active service . He served as adjutant general of the force that captured Havana in 1762 , playing a part in a skirmish at <unk> . 
 In 1758 , Howe was elected a member of parliament for Nottingham , succeeding to the seat vacated by his brother George 's death . His election was assisted by the influence of his mother , who campaigned on behalf of her son while he was away at war , and may very well have been undertaken because service in Parliament was seen as a common way to improve one 's prospects for advancement in the military . In 1764 he was promoted to colonel of the 46th ( South Devonshire ) Regiment of Foot , and in 1768 he was appointed lieutenant governor of the Isle of Wight . As tensions rose between Britain and the colonies in the 1770s , Howe continued to rise through the ranks , and came to be widely regarded as one of the best officers in the army . He was promoted to major general in 1772 , and in 1774 introduced new training drills for light infantry companies . 
 In Parliament he was generally sympathetic to the American colonies . He publicly opposed the collection of legislation intended to punish the Thirteen Colonies known as Intolerable Acts , and in 1774 assured his constituents that he would resist active duty against the Americans and asserted that the entire British army could not conquer America . He also let government ministers know privately that he was prepared to serve in America as second in command to Thomas Gage , whom he knew was unpopular in government circles . In early 1775 , when King George called on him to serve , he accepted , claiming publicly that if he did not , he would suffer " the odious name of backwardness to serve my country in distress . " He sailed for America in March 1775 , accompanied by Major Generals Henry Clinton and John Burgoyne . In May 1775 his colonelcy was transferred to the 23rd Fusiliers .

 Along with fellow British Army Generals Clinton and Burgoyne , Howe arrived at Boston aboard the " H.M.S. Cerberus " on 25 May 1775 , having learned en route that war had broken out with the skirmishes at the marches to Lexington and Concord in April . It provided naval reinforcement at the Battle of Bunker Hill . He led a force of 4 @,@ 000 troops sent to reinforce the 5 @,@ 000 troops under General Thomas Gage who were besieged in the city after those battles . Gage , Howe , and Generals Clinton and Burgoyne discussed plans to break the siege . They formulated a plan to seize high ground around Boston and attack the besieging colonial militia forces , setting its execution for 18 June . However , the colonists learned of the plan and fortified the heights of Breed 's Hill and nearby Bunker Hill on the Charlestown peninsula across the Charles River from Boston on the night of 16 – 17 June , forcing the British leadership to rethink their strategy . 
 = = = Bunker Hill and Boston = = = 
 In a war council held early on 17 June , the generals developed a plan calling for a direct assault on the colonial fortification , and Gage gave Howe command of the operation . Despite a sense of urgency ( the colonists were still working on the fortifications at the time of the council ) , the attack , now known as the Battle of Bunker Hill , did not begin until that afternoon . With Howe personally leading the right wing of the attack , the first two assaults were firmly repulsed by the colonial defenders . Howe 's third assault gained the objective , but the cost of the day 's battle was appallingly heavy . The British casualties , more than 1 @,@ 000 killed or wounded , were the highest of any engagement in the war . Howe described it as a " success ... too dearly bought . " Although Howe exhibited courage on the battlefield , his tactics and overwhelming confidence were criticised . One subordinate wrote that Howe 's " absurd and destructive confidence " played a role in the number of casualties incurred . 
 Although Howe was not injured in the battle , it had a pronounced effect on his spirit . According to British historian George Otto Trevelyan , the battle " exercised a permanent and most potent influence " especially on Howe 's behaviour , and that Howe 's military skills thereafter " were apt to fail him at the very moment when they were especially wanted . " Despite an outward appearance of confidence and popularity with his troops , the " genial six @-@ footer with a face some people described as ' coarse ' " , privately often exhibited a lack of self @-@ confidence , and in later campaigns became somewhat dependent on his older brother Richard ( the admiral in the Royal Navy , also on station in the Colonies ) for advice and approval . 
 On 11 October 1775 , General Gage sailed for England , and Howe took over as Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the British Army in America . British military planners in London had , with the outbreak of hostilities , begun planning a massive reinforcement of the troops in North America . Their plans , made with recommendations from Howe , called for the abandonment of Boston and the establishment of bases in New York and Newport , Rhode Island in an attempt to isolate the rebellion to New England . When orders arrived in November to execute these plans , Howe opted to remain in Boston for the winter and begin the campaign in 1776 . As a result , the remainder of the Siege of Boston was largely a stalemate . Howe never attempted a major engagement with the Continental Army , which had come under the command of Major General George Washington . He did , however , spend a fair amount of time at the gambling tables , and allegedly established a relationship with Elizabeth Lloyd Loring , the wife of Loyalist Joshua Loring , Jr . Loring apparently acquiesced to this arrangement , and was rewarded by Howe with the position of commissary of prisoners . Contemporaries and historians have criticised Howe for both his gambling and the amount of time he supposedly spent with Mrs. Loring , with some going so far as to level accusations that this behaviour interfered with his military activities ; historian John Alden does not give these ideas credence . The alleged relationship is also mentioned in The Battle of the <unk> , an American propaganda ballad written by Francis Hopkinson . In January 1776 Howe 's role as commander in chief was cemented with a promotion to full general in North America . 
 The siege was broken in March 1776 when Continental Army Colonel Henry Knox brought heavy artillery from Fort Ticonderoga to Boston during the winter , and General Washington used them to fortify Dorchester Heights , overlooking Boston and its harbour . Howe at first planned an assault on this position , but a snowstorm interfered , and he eventually decided to withdraw from Boston . On 17 March , British troops and Loyalists evacuated the city , and sailed for Halifax , Nova Scotia .

 Howe and his troops began to arrive outside New York Harbour and made an uncontested landing on Staten Island to the west in early July . Howe , whose orders from Lord George Germain , the Secretary of State responsible for directing the war from Westminster , were fairly clear that he should avoid conflict before the arrival of reinforcements , then waited until those reinforcements arrived in mid @-@ August , along with the naval commander , his brother Richard . This delay proved to be somewhat costly , since the Americans used this time to improve fortifications on northwestern Long Island ( at Brooklyn Heights along the East River shoreline ) and increased the size of their Continental Army with additional militia . After moving most of his army by amphibious barges across the <unk> Narrows to southwestern Long Island without opposition , he attacked the American positions on 27 August in what became known as the Battle of Long Island . In a well @-@ executed manoeuvre , a large column led by Howe and Clinton passed around the American left flank , through the lightly guarded Jamaica Pass far to the east , ( a ridge of hills running east to west bisected the island , with a series of lower entrances that were all guarded by Continentals except inexplicably to the farthest east at Jamaica ) , catching the Patriots off @-@ guard and routing the Americans from their forward positions back into the entrenchments on Brooklyn Heights . Despite the urging of Clinton and others , Howe decided against an immediate assault on these fortifications , claiming " the Troops had for that day done handsomely enough . " He instead began siege operations , methodically advancing on the entrenched Americans . This decision allowed General Washington to successfully orchestrate a nighttime strategic withdrawal across the East River on the night of 29 – 30 August , aided by a thick morning fog . Historian George <unk> notes that had Howe attacked Brooklyn Heights , the capture of even half of Washington 's army , and possibly Washington himself , might have had a significant effect on the rebellion . Some officers , notably General Clinton , were critical of Howe 's decision not to storm the American works . Howe was knighted as a reward for his victory on Long Island . 
 Howe and his brother Richard had , as part of their instructions , been assigned roles as peace commissioners , with limited authority to treat with the rebels . After Long Island , they pursued an attempt at reconciliation , sending the captured General John Sullivan to Philadelphia with a proposal for a peace conference . The meeting that resulted , conducted by Admiral Howe , was unsuccessful . The Howes had been given limited powers , as had the Congressional representatives , and the latter were insistent that the British recognise the recently declared colonial independence . This was not within the Howe 's powers , so the conference failed , and Howe then continued the campaign . He first landed troops on Manhattan on 15 September , and occupied New York City ( which then occupied only Lower Manhattan ) , although his advance northward on Manhattan was checked the next day at Harlem Heights . He then paused , spending nearly one month consolidating control of New York City and awaiting reinforcements . During this time he ordered the execution of Nathan Hale for espionage , and had to deal with the effects of a major fire in the city . He then attempted a landing on the mainland at Throgs Neck , intending to flank Washington 's position at Harlem Heights . However , the narrow causeway between the beach and the mainland was well @-@ defended , and he ended up withdrawing the troops . He then made a successful landing of troops at Pell 's Point in Westchester County ; Washington managed to avoid being flanked , retreating to White Plains . Howe successfully forced Washington out of the New York area in the 28 October Battle of White Plains , and then turned his attention to consolidate British hold on Manhattan . In November he attacked the remaining Continental Army stronghold in the Battle of Fort Washington , taking several thousand prisoners . 
 Washington then retreated across New Jersey , followed by Howe 's advance forces under Charles Cornwallis . At this point , Howe prepared troops under the command of General Clinton for embarkation to occupy Newport , the other major goal of his plan . Clinton proposed that these troops instead be landed in New Jersey , either opposite Staten Island or on the Delaware River , trapping Washington or even capturing the seat of the Continental Congress , Philadelphia . Howe rejected these proposals , despatching Clinton and General Hugh , Earl Percy , two vocal critics of his leadership , to take Newport . In early December Howe came to Trenton , New Jersey to arrange the disposition of his troops for the winter . Washington had retreated all the way across the Delaware , and Howe returned to New York , believing the campaign to be ended for the season . When Washington attacked the Hessian quarters at Trenton on 26 December 1776 , Howe sent Cornwallis to reform the army in New Jersey and chase after Washington . Cornwallis was frustrated in this , with Washington gaining a second victory at Trenton and a third at Princeton . Howe recalled the army to positions much closer to New York for the winter . 
 Howe has been criticised by contemporaries and historians for failing to decisively defeat the Continental Army during the New York campaign . Contemporaries complained that his landing in Westchester failed to trap Washington , but failed to understand that his goal in the campaign was to secure Manhattan , and not necessarily to defeat Washington . However , historian George Billias observes that Howe 's overly rigid adherence to his plans meant that he was unable to capitalise on the opportunities that arose during the campaign for a decisive action . 
 = = = Philadelphia campaign = = = 
 On 30 November 1776 , as Washington was retreating across New Jersey , Howe had written to Germain with plans for the 1777 campaign season . He proposed to send a 10 @,@ 000 @-@ man force up the Hudson River to capture Albany , New York , in conjunction with an expedition sent south from Province of Quebec . He again wrote to Germain on 20 December 1776 with more elaborate proposals for 1777 . These again included operations to gain control of the Hudson River , and included expanded operations from the base at Newport , and an expedition to take Philadelphia . The latter Howe saw as attractive , since Washington was then just north of the city : Howe wrote that he was " persuaded the Principal Army should act offensively [ against Philadelphia ] , where the enemy 's chief strength lies . " Germain acknowledged that this plan was particularly " well digested " , but it called for more men that Germain was prepared to provide . After the setbacks in New Jersey , Howe in mid @-@ January 1777 proposed operations against Philadelphia that included an overland expedition and a sea @-@ based attack , thinking this might lead to a decisive victory over the Continental Army . This plan was developed to the extent that in April , Howe 's army was seen constructing pontoon bridges ; Washington , lodged in his winter quarters at Morristown , New Jersey , thought they were for eventual use on the Delaware River . However , by mid @-@ May Howe had apparently abandoned the idea of an overland expedition : " I propose to invade Pennsylvania by sea ... we must probably abandon the <unk> . " 
 When the campaign season opened in May 1777 , General Washington moved most of his army from its winter quarters in Morristown , New Jersey to a strongly fortified position in the Watchung Mountains . In June 1777 , Howe began a series of odd moves in New Jersey , apparently in an attempt to draw Washington and his army out of that position onto terrain more favourable for a general engagement . His motives for this are uncertain ; historian John Buchanan argues that Howe was determined to attempt to draw Washington into a major engagement while both were in northern New Jersey , writing that " Washington 's shift in position had whetted Howe 's appetite for a major action when , if everything went right , he would finally accomplish what he and his brother 's policies had denied him the previous year : the destruction of the Continental Army " , but that Howe 's underlying campaign goal for the season was Philadelphia . One British major wrote that " [ t ] he report circulated by those in power is that it was thought necessary to march to <unk> [ sic ] to offer Washington battle . " Americans like Henry Knox were perplexed but also concluded that was its purpose : " It was unaccountable that [ the British ] should stop short when they had gone only nine miles ... In the course of a day or two [ we ] discovered that they ... had come out with an intention of drawing us into the plain . " Washington had intelligence that Howe had moved without taking the heavy river @-@ crossing equipment , and was apparently not fooled at all . 
 When Washington failed to take the bait , Howe withdrew the army to Perth Amboy , under harassment by Colonel Daniel Morgan 's elite light unit , Morgan 's Riflemen , who used their superior weapons to snipe at and harry his forces as they moved . Washington moved down to a more exposed position , assuming Howe was going to embark his army on ships . Howe then launched a lightning strike designed to cut Washington 's retreat off . This attempt was foiled by the Battle of Short Hills , which gave Washington time to retreat to a more secure position . Howe then did in fact embark his army and sailed south with his brother 's fleet . Howe maintained an effective secrecy surrounding the fleet 's destination : not only did Washington not know where it was going , neither did many British rank and file . 
 Howe 's campaign for Philadelphia began with an amphibious landing at Head of Elk , Maryland , southwest of the city in late August . Although Howe would have preferred to make a landing on the Delaware River below Philadelphia , reports of well @-@ prepared defences dissuaded him , and the fleet spent almost an entire extra month at sea to reach Head of Elk . Howe 's army left Head of Elk early on 3 September 1777 and pushed back an advance guard of American light infantry at Cooch 's Bridge . On 11 September 1777 , Howe 's army met Washington 's near Chadds Ford along the Brandywine Creek in the Battle of Brandywine . Howe established his headquarters at the Gilpin Homestead , where it stayed until the morning of 16 September . In a reprise of earlier battles , Howe once again flanked the Continental Army position and forced Washington to retreat after inflicting heavy casualties . 
 After two weeks of manoeuvre and engagements ( including The Battle of the Clouds , The Paoli Massacre , and an engagement at Valley Forge where Alexander Hamilton was nearly lost ) , Howe triumphantly entered the city on 26 September . The reception the British received was not quite what they had expected , however . They had been led to believe that " Friends thicker than Woods " would greet them upon their arrival ; they instead were greeted by women , children , and many deserted houses . Despite Howe 's best attempts to minimise the plundering by his army ( he authorised the execution of violators of his orders against it ) , this activity by the army had a significant negative effect on popular support . 
 One week after Howe entered Philadelphia , on 4 October , Washington made a dawn attack on the British garrison at Germantown . He very nearly won the battle before being repulsed by late @-@ arriving reinforcements sent from the city . This forced Howe to withdraw his troops a little closer to the city , where they were also needed to help clear the American Delaware River defences , which were preventing the navy from resupplying the army . It was late November before this task was accomplished , which included a poorly executed attack on Fort Mercer by a division of Hessians . 
 = = = Impact on Burgoyne 's campaign = = = 
 Concomitant with Howe 's campaign , General Burgoyne led his expedition south from Montreal to capture Albany . Burgoyne 's advance was stopped in the Battles of Saratoga in September and October , and he surrendered his army on 17 October . Burgoyne 's surrender , coupled with Howe 's near defeat at Germantown , dramatically altered the strategic balance of the conflict . Support for the Continental Congress , suffering from Howe 's successful occupation of Philadelphia , was strengthened , and the victory encouraged France to enter the war against Britain . Burgoyne 's loss also further weakened the British government of Lord North . 
 Burgoyne made his advance under the assumption that he would be met in Albany by Howe or troops sent by Howe . Burgoyne was apparently not aware that Howe 's plans had evolved as they had . Although Germain knew what Howe 's plans were , whether he communicated them to Burgoyne is unclear . Some sources claim he did while others state that Burgoyne was not notified of the changes until the campaign was well underway . Whether Germain , Howe and Burgoyne had the same expectations about the degree to which Howe was supposed to support the invasion from Quebec is also unclear . Some historians argue that Howe failed to follow instructions and essentially abandoned Burgoyne 's army , while others suggest that Burgoyne failed on his own and then tried to shift the blame to Howe and Clinton . 
 Howe 's decision to focus his own activity on an expedition to Philadelphia may have been motivated by competition with General Burgoyne , who was given command of the northern force despite lobbying by Howe for its command to be given to Clinton . John Alden notes the jealousies among the British leaders , saying , " It is likely that [ Howe ] was as jealous of Burgoyne as Burgoyne was of him and that he was not eager to do anything which might assist his junior up the ladder of military renown . " Along the same lines historian Don Higginbotham concludes that in Howe 's view , " It [ the northern campaign ] was Burgoyne 's whole show , and consequently he [ Howe ] wanted little to do with it . With regard to Burgoyne 's army , he would do only what was required of him ( virtually nothing ) . " 
 Howe himself wrote to Burgoyne on 17 July that he intended to stay close to Washington : " My intention is for Pennsylvania , where I expect to meet Washington , but if he goes to the northward contrary to my expectations , and you can keep him at bay , be assured I shall soon be after him to relieve you . " This suggested that Howe would follow Washington if he went north to assist in the defence of the Hudson . Howe , however , sailed from New York on 23 July . On 30 August , shortly after his arrival at Head of Elk , Howe wrote to Germain that he would be unable to assist Burgoyne , citing a lack of Loyalist support in the Philadelphia area . A small force sent north from New York by General Clinton in early October was also unable to assist Burgoyne . 
 = = = Resignation = = = 
 In October 1777 Howe sent his letter of resignation to London , complaining that he had been inadequately supported in that year 's campaigns . He was finally notified in April 1778 that his resignation was accepted . A grand party , known as the " <unk> " , was thrown for the departing general on 18 May . Organized by his aides John André and Oliver De Lancey Jr . , the party featured a grand parade , fireworks , and dancing until dawn . Washington , aware that the British were planning to evacuate Philadelphia , sent the Marquis de Lafayette out with a small force on the night of the party to determine British movements . This movement was noticed by alert British troops , and Howe ordered a column out to entrap the marquis . In the Battle of Barren Hill , Lafayette escaped the trap with minimal casualties . 
 On 24 May , the day Howe sailed for England , General Clinton took over as commander @-@ in @-@ chief of British armies in America , and made preparations for an overland march to New York . Howe arrived back in England on 1 July , where he and his brother faced censure for their actions in North America . It is likely that the resignation of both William and his brother Richard was due to their desire to hurry home to vindicate their conduct during the campaign . In 1779 Howe and his brother demanded a parliamentary inquiry into their actions . The inquiry that followed was unable to confirm any charges of impropriety or mismanagement levelled against either of them . Because of the inconclusive nature of the inquiry , attacks continued to be made against Howe in pamphlets and the press , and in 1780 he published a response to accusations levelled by Loyalist Joseph Galloway , who issued a reply that harshly criticized the general 's conduct and accused him of deliberately undermining the war effort for the benefit of the anti @-@ war Whig faction in Parliament . 
 = = Later life = = 
 In 1780 Howe lost in his bid to be re @-@ elected to the House of Commons . In 1782 he was named lieutenant general of the ordnance and appointed to the Privy Council . His colonelcy was transferred from the 23rd Fusiliers to the 19th Light Dragoons in 1786 . He resumed limited active duty in 1789 , when a crisis with Spain over territorial claims in northwestern North America threatened to boil over into war . The crisis was resolved , and Howe did not see further action until 1793 , when the French Revolutionary Wars involved Britain . He was promoted to full general in 1793 , and commanded Northern District from 1793 and Eastern District from 1795 . In 1795 he was also appointed governor of Berwick @-@ on @-@ Tweed . 
 When his brother Richard died in 1799 without surviving male issue , Howe inherited the Irish titles and became the 5th Viscount Howe and Baron <unk> . In 1803 he resigned as lieutenant general of the ordnance , citing poor health . In 1805 he was appointed governor of Plymouth , and died at Twickenham in 1814 after a long illness . He was married in 1765 to Frances Connolly , but the marriage was childless , and his titles died with him . His wife survived him by three years ; both are buried in Twickenham .

 Howe appears as an antagonist in the supernatural TV series Sleepy Hollow , depicted in flashbacks by Nicholas Guest and described in the present as being notorious for his brilliant tactics and ruthless cruelty . In his historical role as the British military leader in the War for Independence , Howe was acquainted with Ichabod Crane ( Tom <unk> ) before Crane defected to America ; his first major flashback appearance sees him offer Crane a chance to return to Britain if he identifies Washington 's spies in the British forces , with Crane feeling guilty that he was briefly tempted by the offer . Howe also plays a key role in the crossover episodes between Sleepy Hollow and crime drama Bones ; his body is discovered in a small American church in the present ( characters noting that he is recorded as being buried in Twickenham ) , with his skull being identified as the ' murder weapon ' in Bones episode " The Resurrection in the Remains " , and he is resurrected as a zombie @-@ like warrior in the following Sleepy Hollow episode " Dead Men Tell No Tales " , requiring Crane to destroy him with Greek fire . 
 = Lulworth skipper = 
 The Lulworth skipper ( Thymelicus acteon ) is a butterfly of the Hesperiidae family . Its name is derived from Lulworth Cove in the county of Dorset , England , where the first specimens in Great Britain were collected in 1832 by English naturalist James Charles Dale . 
 The species occurs locally across Central Europe , Asia Minor and North Africa , where its population is considered stable . Its numbers have declined in Northern Europe , leading to its European status of " vulnerable " . Its range in Britain is restricted to the south coast of Dorset , however it is locally abundant and its numbers currently are perhaps at their greatest since its discovery there . 
 With a wingspan of 24 to 28 millimetres , females being larger than males , the Lulworth skipper is a small butterfly , the smallest member of the Thymelicus genus in Europe and among the smallest butterflies in Britain . Aside from the size difference , the sexes are distinguished by females having a distinct circle of golden marks on each forewing . Due to their likeness to the rays around the eye of a peacock 's feather , these are often known as " sun @-@ ray " markings , and they can faintly appear on males . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The Lulworth skipper was first described by German entomologist S. A. von <unk> in 1775 . The butterfly was first discovered in Britain on 15 August 1832 , when specimens were taken from Lulworth Cove in Dorset by English naturalist James Charles Dale It was introduced the following year as the Lulworth skipper ( Thymelicus acteon ) , a name that has remained unchanged ; it is the only one of Britain 's vernacular butterfly names for which there has never been a proposed substitute . 
 = = Description = = 
 The male Lulworth skipper has a wingspan of 24 to 27 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 94 to 1 @.@ 06 in ) , and the female 25 to 28 mm . This makes it one of Britain 's smallest butterflies and , in Europe , the smallest member of the Thymelicus genus . Of Britain 's five " golden " skippers — the others being the silver @-@ spotted skipper ( Hesperia comma ) , large skipper ( <unk> sylvanus ) , small skipper ( Thymelicus sylvestris ) and Essex skipper ( Thymelicus <unk> ) — the Lulworth is both the smallest and darkest . Beyond its small size , it is distinguished particularly by its dark , dun @-@ coloured wings that appear with tinges of olive @-@ brown ; this darkening especially apparent in males . 
 Variations are known to occur ; in north @-@ west Africa , the <unk> of the fore and hind wing are darker , with hints of greenish or greyish brown . Similarly @-@ coloured races occur in Spain , Elba , Crete , and other Eastern Mediterranean islands . T. acteon <unk> , endemic to the Canary Islands , displays colour variations , with the <unk> of the fore @-@ wing showing defined yellow – orange markings . 
 The butterfly is sexually dimorphic ; females have a distinct circle of golden marks on each forewing , often called " sun @-@ ray " markings due to their likeness to the rays around the eye of a peacock 's feather . Males sometimes have these markings , though they are noticeably fainter ( see Illustration 1 ) . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The Lulworth skipper is found locally across southern and central Europe , Asia Minor and North Africa , where its population is considered stable . In northern Europe , its numbers and range have severely declined , most notably in the Netherlands where it is now extinct . This decline has led to the butterfly 's European status of " vulnerable " . Isolated populations of the species in Armenia are also threatened , although not yet included in the National Red List . It is also listed as threatened under the United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan . 
 In Great Britain , where the butterfly reaches the northern limit of its range , its distribution is restricted to the southern coastline of the county of Dorset . Here , both the population and range have changed little in recent decades ; it is locally abundant , with the majority of colonies found on the coast between Weymouth and Swanage and on the Purbeck Ridge , a line of inland chalk hills . Two outlying colonies also exist , at Burton Bradstock and on the Isle of Portland ; the cause of the colony on Portland is unknown , but has been put down to either natural colonisation or released specimens . There is evidence to suggest that the Lulworth skipper is now more abundant in Dorset than at any other time since its discovery in 1832 . 
 Although colonies of Lulworth skippers existed in Devon , the species has , beyond single records , not be seen in the county since the 1930s . Similarly , records of occurrences exist for Cornwall , but they have not been verified as native colonies . 
 Habitats are primarily on unfertilised calcareous grassland ; this includes chalk download , coastal grassland and <unk> in Britain . In all of these habits Tor @-@ grass ( Illustration 2 ) , the butterfly 's sole food plant and that on which it lays eggs , is widespread . Tall , <unk> grass is a favoured habitat due to oviposition and larval development ; Lulworth skippers have benefited from the move away from tight grazing by sheep in the last century and recently outbreaks of myxomatosis among rabbit populations , which otherwise maintain a lower grass height . However , there is evidence to suggest that minimal grazing is not detrimental to the species , and may in fact be beneficial in that it encourages the growth of flowers that act as adult nectar sources .

 The females lay their eggs in rows of 5 to 6 ( although as many as 15 have been recorded ) on the flower @-@ sheath of Tor @-@ grass ( Brachypodium pinnatum ) , preferring the dead sheaths of tall plants . The care taken by females over where to lay their eggs is considered the only remarkable part of the Lulworth skipper breeding process , otherwise it is considered common . 
 Upon hatching , the 2 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 in ) long larva spins a compact cocoon on the site of the eggshell . In this , it will overwinter until around the third week of April , at which point it will eat its way out by making a small hole in the side of the sheath . The caterpillar will then search for tender Tor @-@ grass blades and feed upon them by chewing out notches from the margin . During this time , it will live separately , within a tube composed of the two edges of a blade bound by cords of silk . Fresh tubes will be made as the caterpillar grows larger . Lulworth skipper caterpillars live in the warmest zone of a grass clump , at a height of 20 to 40 centimetres ( 8 to 16 in ) . 
 The pupal stage lasts for about two weeks , from the beginning of June onwards , until late July . It is formed inside a loose " nest " of silk and grass that is spun deep inside a tussock of tor grass . Imago begin to emerge in the early middle of July and finish emerging in the middle of September . Typically , they will live for five to ten days — the normal lifespan for a non @-@ hibernating butterfly of the Lulworth 's seasonal stage . They fly only in strong sunshine and tend to form discrete colonies , with the largest containing up to 100 @,@ 000 individuals .

 = Re Umberto @-@ class ironclad = 
 The Re Umberto class were a group of three ironclad battleships built for the Italian Navy in the 1880s and 1890s . The ships — Re Umberto , Sicilia , and Sardegna — were built as the culmination of a major naval expansion program begun in the 1870s following Italy 's defeat at the Battle of Lissa in 1866 . The Re Umbertos incorporated several innovations over previous Italian designs , including a more efficient arrangement of the main battery , installation of wireless telegraphs , and in Sardegna , the first use of triple @-@ expansion steam engines in an Italian capital ship . Designed by Benedetto Brin , they retained the very thin armor protection and high top speeds of his earlier designs . 
 All three ships served in the Active Squadron for the first decade of their careers , which proved to be uneventful . They were transferred to the Reserve Squadron in 1905 , and by the outbreak of the Italo @-@ Turkish War in 1911 , they were serving as training ships . They provided fire support to Italian troops fighting in Libya during the conflict and took part in the seizure of several Ottoman ports , including Tripoli . During World War I , Sardegna was used as a guard ship in Venice , while Re Umberto served as a floating battery in Brindisi and Sicilia was reduced to a depot ship . All three ships survived the war and were broken up for scrap in the early 1920s .

 Starting in the 1870s , following the Italian fleet 's defeat at the Battle of Lissa , the Italians began a large naval expansion program , aimed at countering the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . The Re Umberto class was the culmination of the first phase of the program , which saw ten modern ironclad battleships built ; these ships placed Italy with the third largest navy , after Great Britain and France . The three Re Umbertos were designed by Benedetto Brin , then the president of the Committee for Naval Projects . The first two ships were authorized in 1883 , and in 1885 Brin , who was now the naval minister , proposed a third vessel . 
 = = = General characteristics and machinery = = = 
 The three ships of the class differed slightly in their dimensions ; Re Umberto and Sicilia were the same length and width but Sardegna was longer . The ships had an overall length of 127 @.@ 6 to 130 @.@ 73 meters ( 418 @.@ 6 to 428 @.@ 9 ft ) ; all three had a beam of 23 @.@ 44 m ( 76 @.@ 9 ft ) . The three ships displaced between 13 @,@ 058 to 13 @,@ 673 metric tons ( 12 @,@ 852 to 13 @,@ 457 long tons ) normally and 14 @,@ 842 to 15 @,@ 454 t ( 14 @,@ 608 to 15 @,@ 210 long tons ; 16 @,@ 361 to 17 @,@ 035 short tons ) at full load , with Sicilia the lightest and Re Umberto the heaviest . The first two ships had a draft of 9 @.@ 29 m ( 30 @.@ 5 ft ) , while Sardegna 's longer hull gave her a reduced draft , at 8 @.@ 84 m ( 29 @.@ 0 ft ) . The ships were fitted with a single military mast with two fighting tops amidships . Sardegna was one of the first warships equipped with Marconi 's new wireless telegraph . The ships ' crews also varied in size , from 733 officers and men aboard Re Umberto , to 736 for Sicilia and 794 on Sardegna . 
 The propulsion system for Re Umberto and Sicilia consisted of a pair of horizontal compound steam engines each driving a single screw propeller , with steam supplied by eighteen coal @-@ fired , cylindrical fire @-@ tube boilers . These ships ' engines were manufactured by Gio . Ansaldo & C. , based on a design from Maudslay , Sons and Field . Sardegna instead received a pair of triple @-@ expansion steam engines , with the same number and type of boilers ; she was the first Italian warship to be equipped with triple expansion engines . The ships ' boilers were trunked into three funnels , with two side @-@ by @-@ side just aft of the conning tower , and the third further aft . Re Umberto 's engines produced a top speed of 18 @.@ 5 knots ( 34 @.@ 3 km / h ; 21 @.@ 3 mph ) at 19 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 14 @,@ 500 kW ) , while Sicilia made 20 @.@ 1 knots ( 37 @.@ 2 km / h ; 23 @.@ 1 mph ) from 19 @,@ 131 ihp ( 14 @,@ 266 kW ) and Sardegna reached 20 @.@ 3 knots ( 37 @.@ 6 km / h ; 23 @.@ 4 mph ) from 22 @,@ 800 ihp ( 17 @,@ 000 kW ) . Specific figures for each ship 's cruising radius have not survived , but the ships of her class could steam for 4 @,@ 000 to 6 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 400 to 11 @,@ 100 km ; 4 @,@ 600 to 6 @,@ 900 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament and armor = = = 
 The ships of the Re Umberto class were armed with a main battery of four 13 @.@ 5 in ( 343 mm ) 30 @-@ caliber guns , mounted in two twin @-@ gun turrets , one on either end of the ship . This was more efficient than the arrangement used in previous designs , with both pairs of guns mounted in a central barbette that limited their arcs of fire . The guns were the Pattern B type manufactured by Armstrong Whitworth . These guns fired a 1 @,@ 250 @-@ pound ( 570 kg ) capped armor @-@ piercing shells with a 507 lb ( 230 kg ) brown powder charge , which produced a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 886 feet per second ( 575 m / s ) . The guns could elevate to 15 degrees and depress to -5 degrees ; elevation was controlled by hand , and loading required the guns to be elevated to 15 degrees . 
 They carried a secondary battery of eight 6 in ( 152 mm ) 40 @-@ caliber guns placed singly in shielded mounts atop the upper deck , with four on each broadside . Close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats was provided by a battery of sixteen 4 @.@ 7 in ( 119 mm ) guns in casemates in the upper deck aboard Re Umberto , eight on each broadside . Sicilia and Sardegna both had twenty of these guns , with ten per side . These were supported by sixteen 57 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) 43 @-@ caliber guns and ten 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns . As was customary for capital ships of the period , they carried five 17 @.@ 7 in ( 450 mm ) torpedo tubes in above @-@ water launchers . The torpedoes carried a 90 lb ( 41 kg ) warhead and had a range of 400 m ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) at a speed of 30 knots ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) . 
 The ships were lightly armored for their size ; the savings in weight allowed for the high top speed , which was typical for Italian capital ships of the period . This was especially true of those designed by Brin , who argued that armor technology of the time could not defeat contemporary heavy guns . The ships ' armor consisted of steel manufactured by Schneider @-@ Creusot . They were protected by belt armor that was 4 in ( 102 mm ) thick , with an armored deck that was 3 in ( 76 mm ) thick . Their forward conning towers were armored with 11 @.@ 8 in ( 300 mm ) of steel plate on the sides . Their main battery turrets had 4 in thick faces and the supporting barbettes had 13 @.@ 75 in ( 349 mm ) thick steel . The secondary guns had 2 in ( 51 mm ) thick gun shields .

 For their first decade in service , all three ships saw duty in the Active Squadron of the Italian fleet , though their early careers were uneventful . Re Umberto and Sardegna made visits to Britain and Germany in 1895 , the latter for the opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal . The ships were involved in an international naval demonstration off Crete in 1897 before the Greco @-@ Turkish War . In 1905 , all three ships were transferred to the Reserve Squadron , having been supplanted by the more modern pre @-@ dreadnought battleships of the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon and Regina Margherita classes . 
 The three ships saw significant action during the Italo @-@ Turkish War of 1911 – 12 , primarily conducting operations in support of Italian troops fighting in Libya . From October to December 1911 , the ships were stationed off Tripoli , where they bombarded Ottoman defenses to prepare for the initial landing and then provided fire support to Italian forces after they had seized the city . After returning to Italy for resupply , the ships were tasked with escorting troop convoys to attack other ports in Libya from June to August 1912 . 
 After the war , Sicilia became a depot ship for the new dreadnought Giulio Cesare in Taranto , and Re Umberto became a depot ship in Genoa . After Italy entered World War I in 1915 , Sardegna was stationed in Venice as the flagship of the naval forces defending the port and Re Umberto returned to service as a floating battery in Brindisi . After the catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Caporetto in November 1917 , Sardegna was withdrawn from Venice to Brindisi , and later to Taranto . In 1918 , Re Umberto was converted into an assault ship for the planned attack on the main Austro @-@ Hungarian naval base at Pola , but the war ended before the attack could be carried out . She was stricken in 1920 and broken up for scrap ; Sicilia and Sardegna followed in 1923 .
