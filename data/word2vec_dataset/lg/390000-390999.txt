 = The Experiment ( Dane Rumble album ) = 
 The Experiment is the first solo studio album by New Zealand singer @-@ songwriter Dane Rumble . Released by Rumble Music and Warner Music on 29 March 2010 , it follows two years after the split of his hip hop group Fast Crew . Rumble found it difficult to write music for himself , and therefore deviated to the pop rock genre . The Experiment includes elements of dance @-@ pop and pop rap , and lyrically focusses on personal issues . Rumble produced the album with Jonathan Campbell . In July 2010 Rumble embarked on The Edge Winter Jam : The Experiment Tour , which had him perform in Auckland , Wellington and Christchurch . 
 The Experiment received mixed to positive reviews from music critics ; some praised its catchiness while others labelled it " chart fodder " . The record received nominations in four categories at the 2010 New Zealand Music Awards , and won the Rumble the award for Best Male Solo Artist . The Experiment debuted at number one on the New Zealand Albums Chart , and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand ( RIANZ ) . Five singles were released from the album : top @-@ ten hits " Don 't Know What to Do " and " Cruel " , and " Always Be Here " , " Everything ( Take Me Down ) " and " What Are You Waiting For ? " . 
 = = Background = = 
 Rumble 's hip hop group , Fast Crew , released their second studio album , Truth , Lies & Red Tape , in 2008 . The band split soon afterwards , and Rumble decided to pursue a solo musical career , and taught himself to play the guitar . He began writing material for his album , but he found that he could no longer write hip hop . " Hip hop was just wearing really thin for me because it 's really quite macho . ' I 'm wicked because of this . I 'm the best because of that ' . It 's a lot of talking yourself up , " Rumble said . He began to write songs inspired by his own experiences and emotions , which allowed him to explore other musical genres . He explained that when he wrote songs for the album , he began by creating a chord progression using his guitar , which evolved into the tune 's basic melody , after which he would determine its theme . Other songs were conceived by Rumble humming a tune during everyday activities , then recording it onto his iPhone so as to not forget it . The tune would later be refined to a full @-@ fledged song . According to Rumble , writing music was the hardest component of the album 's making . " Always Be Here " was the first song Rumble completed , which he sent to record label Warner Music NZ , thereby commencing his solo career . 
 Rumble organised a band of his friends , rather than the standard practice of contracting out to professional studio musicians . Scott Nicholls played drums , Ben White played guitar , Alistair Wood played keyboard instruments and Rumble 's brother Josh played bass . White and Wood had previously played music with Fast Crew . The band spent three months recording the album 's music ; drums were recorded at York Street Studio , Auckland , while the remainder of the recording took place at Beaver Studios , Auckland . Rumble co @-@ produced The Experiment with Jonathan Campbell , who also engineered the record . Rumble said he put a lot of time and effort into the album ; " I really wanted to write a world class record , I didn 't want to come out with some half @-@ pie thing . " 
 = = Composition = = 
 The Experiment is a pop rock album , featuring guitar and synth riffs , and incorporates elements of dance @-@ pop , pop rap and power pop . Some parts of the album contain auto @-@ tuned vocals , and the record has been described as having an " international " feel . Rumble said that this was because he and Campbell made sure that the album " sounded big [ so that ] it could compete on the world stage " . Thematically , The Experiment is " about love , heartbreak , getting what he wants and knowing he is in charge of his own destiny " , although " Let You Down " is " quite dark and weighty " . Many of the song 's discuss Rumble 's own life experiences ; some are reflective while others " just try to get other people enthused about what they 're doing with their lives " . " Always Be Here " discusses maintaining a romantic relationship while constantly travelling , and " What Are You Waiting For ? " is " about being motivated and assessing your own life , which is exactly what happened to [ Rumble ] " .

 = María Santos Gorrostieta Salazar = 
 María Santos Gorrostieta Salazar ( 1976 – 15 November 2012 ) was a Mexican physician and politician of the Party of the Democratic Revolution ( PRD ) . From 2008 to 2011 , she served as mayor of Tiquicheo , a small town in the Mexican state of Michoacán . In spite of three failed assassination attempts during her tenure as mayor , Gorrostieta Salazar continued to be outspoken in the fight against organized crime . In a fourth attack , Gorrostieta Salazar was kidnapped and assassinated by suspected drug traffickers on 15 November 2012 . Michoacán is home to several violent drug trafficking organizations such as La Familia Michoacana and the Knights Templar Cartel . 
 = = Career = = 
 Gorrostieta Salazar was born in 1976 in Tiquicheo , a small town in the state of Michoacán , Mexico . She attended the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo in Morelia and earned a PhD in medicine . 
 She began her political career by joining the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , and from 2008 to 2011 , she served as the mayor of Tiquicheo . While in office , she survived three assassination attempts . She ran for the Chamber of Deputies of the Congress of the Union , but she did not get elected and returned to her office as mayor . After some differences with the PRI , which had urged her to resign , Gorrostieta Salazar left the party and joined the Party of the Democratic Revolution ( PRD ) in August 2010 . She said her Catholic faith influenced her approach to her duties as a politician . She has been described as a " heroine of the 21st century " for her opposition to Mexico 's drug cartels and for refusing to take bribes . 
 She had three children with her first husband , José Sánchez Chávez . After he was killed in the October 2009 attack , Gorrostieta Salazar later married Nereo Patiño Delgado .

 = = = Background = = = 
 In 2008 , Gorrostieta Salazar was elected mayor of Tiquicheo . Several drug trafficking organizations , particularly the La Familia Michoacana and the Knights Templar Cartel , are based in the area . Michoacán is a leading producer of marijuana and opium poppy , making it a lucrative route for smugglers taking narcotics into the United States . Despite receiving threats , Gorrostieta Salazar publicly denounced the activities of these groups . The drug cartels , which are constantly fighting each other for territorial control , often target mayors who confront them . Other mayors , however , are corrupted and bribed by the cartels . Mexico has more than 2 @,@ 500 municipalities , many of which are far from the capital cities and lack amenities available in other parts of the country . Many of these areas are plagued with drug @-@ related violence , so the political parties have faced difficulties finding people interested in holding the post of mayor . 
 It was in Michoacán that Felipe Calderón launched the country 's first military @-@ led operation in the ongoing drug war , just ten days after he took office on 11 December 2006 . The military campaign spread to other states in Mexico , eventually including over 50 @,@ 000 federal agents . After years of past administrations taking a passive stance against the drug cartels , Calderón had decided it was time for the government to " flex its muscles . " Violence exploded in Michoacán and across the country , leaving a death toll of about 60 @,@ 000 ( perhaps even more than 100 @,@ 000 ) in six years . Numerous journalists and mayors have been killed since the start of the drug war , and some members of the Mexican Armed Forces and the Federal police have been accused of human rights abuses and causing forced disappearances . The organized crime groups have diversified their criminal agendas , no longer focusing solely on drug trafficking ; many of them operate kidnapping rings and extortion and protection rackets , and engage in piracy , and human trafficking . The cartels in Michoacán force the local population to pay for " protection " , spy , and report suspicious activities and law enforcement presence . 
 Calderón argued that if he had not acted , Mexico would have become a " narco @-@ state , " where the drug trafficking organizations impose law at their will . " I am sure that the Mexicans of tomorrow will remember these days as the moment when the country took the decision to defend itself , with all its force , against a voracious criminal phenomenon of translational dimensions , " Calderón said on 20 November 2012 at a ceremony for fallen soldiers . His successor , Enrique Peña Nieto , has pledged to continue the fight , but plans to adjust the strategy to reduce the level of violence .

 In January 2008 , three months after Gorrostieta Salazar took office , she and her husband were travelling near the rural community of Las <unk> when an automobile ran them off the road . In that incident , the gunmen only threatened Gorrostieta Salazar by shooting in the air and warning her to resign " before it was too late . " On 16 January 2009 , in the rural area of El Limón de <unk> , the couple was attacked by armed assailants and received minor injuries that did not prevent them from continuing their public lives . The next attack occurred on 15 October 2009 , when Gorrostieta Salazar was ambushed while driving through El Limón de <unk> with her husband . A group of armed men opened fire on Sánchez Chávez when he left the vehicle to make a phone call . Gorrostieta Salazar ran to protect her husband and was shot as well . Sánchez Chávez died that day from three gunshot wounds , but Gorrostieta Salazar survived because the gunmen believed she was dead . 
 A few months later , Gorrostieta Salazar announced that she was still willing to work and returned to her duties as mayor . By then , she contacted the leaders of the PRI to ask for protection , but she encountered difficulties , including unanswered phone calls . 
 = = = 2010 attack = = = 
 On 23 January 2010 , Gorrostieta Salazar was attacked by armed men in Ciudad <unk> , Guerrero , while returning from a local event with four other people . Severely injured by bullet wounds in the abdomen , chest , and leg , she was taken to a local hospital . Also injured were the driver of the vehicle , who was shot twice ; Marbella Reyes <unk> , head of the Institute of Women in Tiquicheo ; and Fanny <unk> Gómez , a journalist from El Sol de Morelia . In addition to the bullet wounds , Gorrostieta Salazar suffered further injuries when the vehicle crashed after the shooting . Her wounds left her in constant pain and she had to use a colostomy bag , but she refused to resign her post as mayor . She publicly displayed her wounds in photographs published in an issue of <unk> <unk> magazine , and repeated her statement that she would continue her work . 
 " I wanted to show you my wounded , mutilated , humiliated body because I am not ashamed of it , because it is the result of the misfortunes that have marked my life ... it is the living testimony that I am a whole and strong woman , who , despite my physical and mental wounds , continues standing . " 
 Gorrostieta Salazar left the PRI and joined the PRD in August 2010 , stating that the PRI had not supported her after the attacks . She ran for election to the National Congress with the PRD , but failed to get elected . At the end of her term as mayor , Gorrostieta Salazar retired from politics . She returned to private life , remarried , and dedicated her time to raise her three children : <unk> , José , and <unk> . Her police protection came to an end when her mayoral term expired in 2011 .

 On 12 November 2012 , Gorrostieta Salazar was driving her daughter to school in Morelia at around 8 : 30 a.m. when a vehicle ran them off the road . Two armed men descended from their vehicle and forced her out of her car as onlookers watched . Gorrostieta Salazar pleaded with her abductors to let her daughter go unharmed , and then agreed to go with the kidnappers . The family of the former mayor initially thought it was a ransom kidnapping . After not hearing from Gorrostieta Salazar or her abductors for two days , they notified the police . On 15 November , police identified the body after farm workers from the rural community of San Juan <unk> in <unk> found the corpse on their way to work . 
 Post @-@ mortem reports indicated that she died of a traumatic brain injury , the result of severe blows to the head . The governor of Michoacán said that organized crime was undoubtedly involved . Gorrostieta Salazar was buried alongside her husband José Sánchez Chávez in a tomb at a local cemetery in Tiquicheo , her hometown .

 = Interstate 195 ( New Jersey ) = 
 Interstate 195 ( abbreviated I @-@ 195 ) is an auxiliary route of the Interstate Highway System located in the U.S. state of New Jersey . Its western end is at I @-@ 295 and Route 29 just south of Trenton , New Jersey in Hamilton Township , Mercer County while its eastern end is at the Garden State Parkway , Route 34 and Route 138 in Wall Township . I @-@ 195 is 34 @.@ 17 miles ( 54 @.@ 99 km ) in length . The route is mostly a four @-@ lane highway that runs through wooded areas in the center of New Jersey . It has an interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike ( I @-@ 95 ) at Exit 7A in Robbinsville Township and serves as a main access road to Six Flags Great Adventure ( which is off the CR 537 exit in Jackson Township ) and the Jersey Shore . I @-@ 195 is occasionally referred to as the Central Jersey Expressway . On April 6 , 1988 , President Ronald Reagan signed H.R. <unk> naming Interstate 195 in New Jersey the James J. Howard Interstate Highway , in honor of the late James J. Howard . 
 The current I @-@ 195 was initially planned as a toll road called the Trenton @-@ Asbury Park Expressway in the 1950s . In the 1960s , the road became part of the proposed Route 37 and Route 38 freeways that were to cross the central part of the state . A compromise between these two freeways was planned between Trenton and Belmar and would get Interstate Highway funding , becoming I @-@ 195 . This freeway was built in several stages during the 1970s and 1980s . Between 2005 and 2015 , a plan existed to extend the I @-@ 195 designation west to the planned interchange between the Pennsylvania Turnpike ( I @-@ 276 ) and I @-@ 95 in Bristol Township , Pennsylvania . Under this plan , I @-@ 195 would have followed present I @-@ 95 and I @-@ 295 to the north of Trenton . It was instead decided to extend the I @-@ 295 designation west and south , along existing I @-@ 95 , to the new interchange . 
 = = Route description = = 
 = = = Mercer County = = = 
 I @-@ 195 's western terminus is at a modified cloverleaf interchange with I @-@ 295 in Hamilton Township , Mercer County , located southeast of the city of Trenton . From this end , the freeway continues north into Trenton as Route 29 . I @-@ 195 serves as the southern continuation of Route 29 , continuing east from I @-@ 295 as a six @-@ lane expressway , passing between suburban neighborhoods to the north and the Crosswicks Creek to the south . After the exit for US 206 , the highway narrows to four lanes and turns northeast as it interchanges with CR 524 and CR 620 . Following this , I @-@ 195 passes near more neighborhoods and runs to the northwest of Gropp Lake before turning more to the east . The route has a cloverleaf interchange with Yardville @-@ Hamilton Square Road before passing near business parks and reaching a cloverleaf junction with US 130 . After US 130 , the road enters Robbinsville Township as the settings start to become more rural , with a few areas of suburban development . In Robbinsville Township , there is a ramp that provides access to the New Jersey Turnpike ( I @-@ 95 ) . Shortly after passing over the New Jersey Turnpike , I @-@ 195 reaches the exit for CR 526 . The highway runs to the north of Allentown before briefly forming the border between Robbinsville Township to the north and Upper Freehold Township , Monmouth County to the south as it reaches the interchange with CR 524 / CR 539 . 
 = = = Monmouth and Ocean counties = = = 
 Upon passing under CR 524 / CR 539 , I @-@ 195 fully enters Upper Freehold Township in Monmouth County and continues east through a mix of woodland and farmland . The next interchange the highway reaches is with CR 43 . Past this exit , the highway passes through more rural areas and crosses into Millstone Township . In this area , I @-@ 195 turns to the southeast and enters more forested areas as it comes to a cloverleaf interchange with CR 537 . This exit off I @-@ 195 provides access to Six Flags Great Adventure and the Jackson Premium Outlets . Due to the presence of Six Flags , this exit off I @-@ 195 can become busy during the summer months since it provides access to the park from both the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway , which lies just east of I @-@ 195 's eastern terminus . Upon crossing CR 537 , the highway enters Jackson Township in Ocean County and continues east through heavy woods . The road comes to an exit with CR 527 , where there is a park and ride lot for motorists . The median of I @-@ 195 widens past the CR 527 junction before narrowing as it comes to the CR 638 interchange . The road runs through more woodland , with nearby residential development increasing . 
 After crossing the North Branch Metedeconk River , I @-@ 195 continues into Howell Township , Monmouth County and turns northeast , reaching a cloverleaf interchange with US 9 . At this point , the road turns east again and soon heads back into dense woods . After crossing the Manasquan River , the expressway interchanges with CR 547 , which provides access to CR 524 and CR 549 . Shortly after CR 547 , I @-@ 195 enters Wall Township and passes through Allaire State Park . The eastern end of I @-@ 195 is located at Exit 35 , its junction with Route 34 that has access to the southbound Garden State Parkway from the eastbound direction . At the exit for Route 34 , I @-@ 195 ends and Route 138 begins , but the highway and exit numbering continue onto Route 138 , marking the interchange with the Garden State Parkway as Exit 36 . Past this interchange , Route 138 continues east to Belmar on the Jersey Shore as an arterial boulevard , making connections with Route 18 and Route 35 . 
 = = History = = 
 What would become I @-@ 195 was first proposed in the late 1950s as a toll road called the Trenton @-@ Asbury Park Expressway that was to be operated by the New Jersey Highway Authority , the owner of the Garden State Parkway at the time . In 1965 , this road would be incorporated into a planned Central Jersey Expressway System . The western portion would become a part of the Route 37 freeway that was to run from Trenton to Seaside Heights while the eastern portion would become a part of the Route 38 freeway that was to run from Camden to Belmar . The two freeways were to meet near Fort Dix . By 1967 , plans for the Route 38 freeway were canceled , leaving Route 37 as the only planned east @-@ west freeway through central New Jersey . The routing of this freeway , which was to be called the Central Jersey Expressway , was changed to run from the Trenton area east to Wall Township In addition , officials pushed for Interstate Highway funding for the freeway , with funds to be diverted from the canceled I @-@ 278 in Union County . The proposed freeway would cost $ 60 million . 
 By 1970 , construction took place on the route between CR 539 near Allentown and CR 527 in Jackson Township . The portion of I @-@ 195 between the New Jersey Turnpike and CR 527 was opened by 1973 and construction on the section between White Horse and the New Jersey Turnpike began . In 1979 , I @-@ 195 was completed east to <unk> . By 1983 , the length of I @-@ 195 was completed . 
 When it was planned , I @-@ 195 did not intersect I @-@ 95 at all ; it instead connected to I @-@ 295 at its west end . When I @-@ 95 was re @-@ routed to the New Jersey Turnpike after the cancellation of the Somerset Freeway , I @-@ 195 was connected to I @-@ 95 . Since I @-@ 95 abruptly ends at I @-@ 295 and US 1 in Lawrence Township , motorists must take I @-@ 295 southbound to I @-@ 195 east in order to access I @-@ 95 / New Jersey Turnpike . 
 On April 6 , 1988 , President Ronald Reagan signed H.R. <unk> naming I @-@ 195 in New Jersey the James J. Howard Interstate Highway , in honor of the late James J. Howard , a U.S. Representative from New Jersey who advocated improving the highways of the United States . In the late 1990s , the New Jersey Department of Transportation considered the possibility of widening I @-@ 195 to six lanes between the New Jersey Turnpike and CR 537 in order to accommodate traffic going to Six Flags Great Adventure . The interchange with CR 537 was improved in 1997 by adding separate ramps to westbound and eastbound CR 537 from I @-@ 195 and by making the westbound ramp two lanes for Six Flags traffic . 
 I @-@ 195 , like many other highways in New Jersey , once had solar powered emergency call boxes every 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) . With the advent of cell phones , the call boxes saw limited use . To save on maintenance costs , the NJDOT removed the call boxes in 2005 . 
 On April 30 , 2010 , NJDOT started a project to repave the expressway both eastbound and westbound from just east of the Turnpike overpasses near Exit 7 in Robbinsville Township to Exit 11 in Upper Freehold Township . This was completed in late autumn of 2010 . 
 From December 2004 until November 2014 , the New Jersey Turnpike ( Interstate 95 ) was widened with the construction of new outer roadways ( " truck lanes " ) that extended the " dual @-@ dual " roadways south to Interchange 6 in Mansfield Township from its former end at Interchange 8A in Monroe Township . As part of this project , the overpasses carrying I @-@ 195 over the Turnpike ( I @-@ 95 ) were reconstructed , the Interchange 7A toll gate was widened , and all the ramps connecting directly to the mainline of the Turnpike were rebuilt which included building a new high @-@ speed ramp over I @-@ 195 to enter the northbound lanes of the Turnpike . 
 In preparation for the completion of the Pennsylvania Turnpike / Interstate 95 Interchange Project and simultaneous rerouting of I @-@ 95 in 2017 , plans were made to extend I @-@ 195 west from its present @-@ day western terminus along I @-@ 295 and I @-@ 95 , continuing counterclockwise to the north , west and south around Trenton to the new interchange . I @-@ 295 would have been truncated to the current interchange with I @-@ 195 . Officials from New Jersey and Pennsylvania had agreed to submit the I @-@ 195 request to American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials , as no route designation is official until approved by them . Had it been approved , approximately 27 @.@ 1 miles ( 43 @.@ 6 km ) would have been added to I @-@ 195 . Interchange renumbering would have also taken place in concert with the future I @-@ 195 designation in Pennsylvania and both the planned and current I @-@ 195 designation in New Jersey . This proposal had received conditional approval from AASHTO . However , on May 20 , 2015 , the original plan of extending I @-@ 295 west and south into Pennsylvania to the new interchange was approved instead , leaving the western terminus of I @-@ 195 at its current location .

 The New Jersey Department of Transportation ( NJDOT ) has studied proposals to expand I @-@ 195 from Exit 16 near Six Flags to the New Jersey Turnpike from 4 to 6 total lanes , which would eliminate the grass median in the process .

 = Chetro Ketl = 
 Chetro Ketl is an Ancestral Puebloan great house and archeological site located in Chaco Culture National Historical Park , New Mexico , United States . Construction on Chetro Ketl began c . 990 and was largely complete by 1075 , with significant remodeling occurring in the early and mid @-@ 1110s . Following the onset of a severe drought , most Chacoans emigrated from the canyon by 1140 ; by 1250 Chetro Ketl 's last inhabitants had vacated the structure . 
 The great house was rediscovered in 1823 by the Mexican governor of New Mexico , José Antonio Vizcarra , and in 1849 Lieutenant James Simpson of the United States Army Corps of Engineers documented the major ruins in Chaco Canyon . Edgar L. Hewett , the director of the first archeological field school in the canyon , conducted excavations of Chetro Ketl during 1920 and 1921 , and again between 1929 and 1935 . 
 Chaco scholars estimate that it required more than 500 @,@ 000 man @-@ hours , 26 @,@ 000 trees , and 50 million sandstone blocks to erect Chetro Ketl . The great house is a D @-@ shaped structure ; its east wall is 280 feet ( 85 m ) long , and the north wall is more than 450 feet ( 140 m ) ; the perimeter is 1 @,@ 540 feet ( 470 m ) , and the diameter of the great kiva is 62 @.@ 5 feet ( 19 @.@ 1 m ) . Chetro Ketl contained approximately 400 rooms and was the largest great house by area in Chaco Canyon , covering nearly 3 acres ( 1 @.@ 2 ha ) . Chetro Ketl lies 0 @.@ 4 miles ( 0 @.@ 64 km ) from Pueblo Bonito , in an area that archeologists call downtown Chaco ; they theorize that the area may be an ancestral sacred zone . Chetro Ketl contains architectural elements , such as a colonnade and tower kiva , that appear to reflect a Mesoamerican influence . 
 Chetro Ketl 's purpose is widely debated but many archeologists believe the building was a place of large @-@ scale ceremony that held an important position within the larger Chacoan system . It may have been occupied primarily by groups of priests and , during times of ritual , pilgrims from outlying communities . Archeologist Stephen H. Lekson believes Chetro Ketl was a palace inhabited by Chacoan royalty , and the scale of its construction was motivated by what architects call " massing " : building imposing structures with the intent to impress onlookers . The building has deteriorated significantly since its rediscovery in the early 19th century , and its usefulness as a source of information about Chacoan culture is slowly diminishing . 
 = = Background = = 
 During the 10th to 8th millennia BCE , the San Juan Basin was occupied by Paleo @-@ Indians known as the Clovis culture ( c . 9 @,@ 300 ) and the Folsom tradition ( 8 @,@ 500 to 7 @,@ 500 ) . Projectile points found in the vicinity of Chaco Canyon suggest that hunters may have been active in the region as early as 10 @,@ 000 . By 6 @,@ 000 the <unk> culture had developed from within the Paleolithic population , as environmental changes caused the eastward movement of animals and people to the Southern Plains , bringing Southwestern and northern Mexican cultures into the San Juan Basin . Cynthia Irwin @-@ Williams proposed that the first human presence in Chaco Canyon dates to a hunter @-@ gatherer society that she named the Oshara Tradition , which developed within the local Archaic ( c . 6 @,@ 000 to 800 ) <unk> population . The Oshara occupied portions of northwestern New Mexico , northeastern Arizona , southeastern Utah , and central and southwestern Colorado . They harvested jackrabbits in the basin as early as 5500 . Irwin @-@ Williams divided the Oshara Tradition into six phases , and during the <unk> phase ( 1800 to 800 ) the Arroyo Cuervo area east of Chaco Canyon saw the introduction of maize and the use of rock shelters . She hypothesized that this period saw the beginning of seasonal gatherings of people from around the San Juan Basin , who eventually began to aggregate into larger social units . 
 By 200 BCE , the Basketmaker culture had begun to develop from the Oshara Tradition . At least two groups of transitional Basketmaker II people inhabited the San Juan Basin during this period , as increased rainfall allowed for sustained agriculture and permanent settlements by 1 CE , when the water table rose and intermittent streams became more reliable . During the first four centuries CE , the Basketmaker II people established pit @-@ houses at elevated locations near sources of water and arable land . Brian M. Fagan notes that the development of pottery in the area during the 4th century permitted the boiling of maize and beans for the first time , and " must have brought a revolution in cooking " . This period also marked the introduction of the bow and arrow to the region . 
 Parts of the San Juan Basin saw plentiful rainfall during the 5th to 8th centuries , leading to significant expansion of pit @-@ house communities . Population increases during the 6th century led to the settlement of the area 's lowlands , including Chaco Canyon , as the Basketmaker II people changed from a primarily hunter @-@ gatherer society to one based on farming . This culture is known as Basketmaker III , and by 500 at least two such settlements had been established in Chaco Canyon . An important phase of Basketmaker III people is known as the La Plata . One of the earliest La Plata phase sites , <unk> <unk> Village , was continuously occupied until the early 8th century , when the canyon was home to a few hundred people . Several clusters of Basketmaker III sites have been identified in the vicinity of Chetro Ketl . 
 As the Basketmaker III people improved their farming techniques during the 8th century , the well @-@ watered areas of the San Juan Basin became densely populated . Greater crop yields necessitated the construction of above @-@ ground storage facilities , which were the first large @-@ scale construction projects in the region . Fagan identifies this as the beginning of the first pueblos , " ushering in a period of profound social tension , population movements , and political change . " In his opinion , " by 800 , there was no going back . The people of Chaco and elsewhere were locked completely into economies based on maize and bean cultivation . " Archeologists refer to the period starting c . 800 as the Pueblo I Period . By the early 10th century the large pit @-@ house settlements had been supplanted by modular construction that later served as the foundation for the Ancestral Puebloan great houses . This marks the beginning of the Bonito Phase . During the 10th century , Chaco 's population was swelled by a steady influx of immigrants from the San Juan River , approximately 100 miles ( 160 km ) north . Fagan notes , " Within a few centuries , as rainfall became more irregular and life less predictable , the Chacoans embarked on a cultural trajectory that melded ancient traditions with new ideas that were to <unk> into a brilliant and short @-@ lived Southwestern society . " 
 = = Location and alignment = = 
 Chaco Canyon lies at the geographic center of the San Juan Basin . It is located in northwestern New Mexico 60 miles ( 97 km ) north of Interstate 40 and 130 miles ( 210 km ) from Gallup , the nearest city . The continental divide is 20 miles ( 32 km ) east . Chaco Canyon was created by the Chaco River , which cut several hundred feet into Chacra Mesa . The elevation of the sandstone canyon and the surrounding high @-@ desert terrain is approximately 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) . Though most of the Chacoan sites are located at the bottom of the canyon , the group also includes some ruins not in the canyon proper , extending 35 miles ( 56 km ) from Kin Ya 'a in the south to Pueblo Alto in the north , and 20 miles ( 32 km ) from Pueblo Pintado to the northeast and Peñasco Blanco in the southwest . In terms of water drainage and cultural affinity , the area is part of the San Juan Basin , which includes Mesa Verde in Colorado and Kayenta , Arizona . 
 Chetro Ketl lies 0 @.@ 4 miles ( 0 @.@ 64 km ) east of Pueblo Bonito , in an area that archeologists call downtown Chaco . Scholars theorize that the area may be an ancestral sacred zone demarcated by a low masonry wall that encloses Chetro Ketl , Pueblo Bonito , and Pueblo del Arroyo . Chetro Ketl 's position is symmetrical to Pueblo Bonito ; the buildings are equidistant from a north @-@ south axis that runs across the canyon . Anna Sofaer proposed that many of the great houses in Chaco Canyon were constructed to emphasize astronomical alignments ; during the minor lunar standstill , the full moon rises along Chetro Ketl 's back wall . 
 Chetro Ketl is located opposite a large opening in the canyon known as South Gap , which helped maximize the building 's exposure to the sun while increasing visibility and access to the south . Its rear wall runs parallel to the canyon , and at less than 100 feet ( 30 m ) from the cliffs its proximity allowed inhabitants to benefit from passive solar energy emanating from the rocks . Chetro Ketl is not perfectly aligned to the cardinal directions , but its nominal southerly orientation further enhanced solar exposure to its tiered rooms . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Like other great houses in Chaco Canyon , Chetro Ketl was built over an extended period , during which the Ancestral Puebloans quarried large amounts of sandstone from the surrounding canyon . W. James Judge describes the period from 1030 to 1130 as " Chaco 's golden century , a period virtually unmatched elsewhere in the pre @-@ Columbian Southwest " . By 1085 , the Chacoans had constructed great houses at Chetro Ketl , Pueblo Alto , and Pueblo del Arroyo , during what Fagan describes as " a time of extraordinary growth and outreach " . 
 = = = Timber = = = 
 In 1983 , dendrochronology of wood samples from Chetro Ketl provided information on species selected , season of cutting , wood modification and use , as well as an estimate of the number of trees required to build the great house . Trees were harvested for construction at Chetro Ketl annually , which contrasts with the sporadic patterns found at other sites in the canyon . Whereas a late summer and early fall harvesting time has been documented at other Chacoan sites , the tree felling for Chetro Ketl was undertaken primarily during the spring and early summer . This may indicate that enough in @-@ house labor was available during the farming season , or that specialized groups of Chacoans were dedicated to tree felling irrespective of the agriculture cycle , when most others were busy with field preparation and planting . One particularly well sampled room suggests that wood was cut during the relatively short span of a couple of weeks per season . 
 The most commonly harvested tree species was ponderosa pine ; the Chacoans felled approximately 16 @,@ 000 of them for use at Chetro Ketl , and the species is now absent from the canyon . Archeologists Florence M. Hawley and Neil Judd proposed that a plentiful forest may have existed in and around the canyon during the 10th and 11th centuries , but was eventually destroyed by over @-@ harvesting . Dean and Warren believe this is unlikely , but the presence of trees in the canyon during the 20th century " suggests that some pines may have been locally available for use in the large towns " . In their opinion , " the harvesting of trees for Chacoan construction must have decimated ponderosa pine stands and forests for many miles in every direction from Chaco Canyon . " Archeologists believe the trees were processed where they were cut , then carried , not dragged , back to Chaco Canyon . 
 A 2001 analysis of strontium isotopes indicates that after 974 the Chacoans harvested architectural timbers primarily from two locations : the Chuska Mountains and Mount Taylor , in the San Mateo Mountains , both located approximately 47 miles ( 76 km ) distant . Despite their equal proximity , they did not harvest from the <unk> Mountains . The selection of timbers from the Chuska and San Mateo ranges , and the avoidance of those from the <unk> Mountains , suggests that " regional socioeconomic ties " factored more heavily into timber procurement than " resource depletion with distance and time " . 
 Nearly 78 percent of the estimated 26 @,@ 000 trees harvested for use at Chetro Ketl were felled between 1030 and 1060 . More than 7 @,@ 000 trees were felled for kiva ( round room ) construction alone , with approximately 750 used in the great kiva . Roofs typically consisted of primary beams , secondary beams , and one or two layers of split shakes , probably of a juniper species or pinyon pine , which were locally available . Most of the primary and secondary construction beams were of ponderosa pine . In addition to bulk materials , construction required other items in smaller quantities . Cordage was used for lashing roof elements together , and baskets and wood frames were needed for transporting mortar and rock . Other tools , such as digging sticks and <unk> , were used in quantity ; many discarded <unk> have been found built into the wall interiors . 
 = = = Stone and mortar = = = 
 Chetro Ketl 's walls were constructed using three bulk materials : stone , clay @-@ sand , and water . Two types of stone were used : a hard gray @-@ brown tabular sandstone that forms the bench above Chaco Canyon 's cliffs , and a softer , tan , massively bedded sandstone that forms the cliffs themselves . Chacoans preferred the harder , tabular stone as it was easier to shape , but much of it had to be dug up and levered out of the ground with wooden poles . Because the massive tan stone of the cliff faces was easier to procure , but much more difficult to work , the Chacoans probably used it only after the more easily quarried gray @-@ brown stone beds had been depleted . 
 The Chacoans used clay or clay @-@ sand and water to make mud mortar . They obtained most of the material from canyon deposits , but some of the clays may have been collected from the base of the cliffs . Clay and clay @-@ sand in soils or stream deposits were accessed by digging large pits , then mixing mortar in the pits and carrying the mix to the construction site in baskets . Water is scarce in Chaco Canyon and construction probably took place primarily during the late summer and early fall rainy season , when it was more readily available . Water was also collected from small reservoirs in the slick rock and deep wells in the bed of Chaco Wash . 
 = = = Masonry = = = 
 Only the most highly skilled Chacoans shaped and set stone ; others carried supplies and mixed mortar . The width of a given wall was determined by its place in a structure . The first story of a two @-@ story wall is always wider than the second . Chacoan walls are often called core @-@ and @-@ veneer , but only the widest walls had cores . The Chacoans tried to build walls with two flush faces , but because the stones were typically quite small , to build a wider wall they built up a space between the two faces ; this spacing is often called the core . In most walls , the core consisted of roughly shaped stone or rubble laid at the same time as the two faces . In others , the faces were built up independently , and the core packed between them . Chacoan walls derive their stability from the degree of contact between stones in the faces and the width of the wall itself , not from the strength of the core . 
 Chacoan wall faces are typically called " veneers " , but they were integral load @-@ bearing elements rather than decorative overlays . The veneers are known for their attention to coursing and detail , and various styles have become synonymous with Chacoan building . Depending on the facing style , the joints between the stones would be filled with spalls or chinks , set in mud mortar ; or the coursing could alternate between larger stones and several courses of smaller tablets . Good veneer minimized the amount of exposed mortar , which reduced maintenance , maximized stone contact , and increased the strength of the wall . It also reduced the possibility of structural failure . Aside from structural considerations , some veneers are the result of highly skilled masons working within well @-@ developed craft traditions . Recurring veneer patterns may indicate a widespread style used during a particular period , or they may suggest the work of a specific social group or line of builders . 
 Doors and vents often had sills of carefully ground flat stone slabs and lintels constructed from a row of thin wood beams . Chacoan masons also frequently included intramural beams – horizontal logs completely enclosed in the wall core – which were probably intended to reduce horizontal deformation of the wall . The interior walls of great houses were typically covered in a rock veneer . Judd identified four distinct types , and his typology is the most commonly accepted in the region . Chetro Ketl 's interior walls , particularly those in the eastern wing , were covered in a Type IV veneer characterized by uniform pieces of sandstone with little to no exposed mortar . Judd excluded a fifth type of masonry , called McElmo style , from his typology . 
 = = = Phases = = = 
 In 1934 , Florence Hawley used 143 tree @-@ ring dates and a comparative masonry analysis to assemble a construction history of Chetro Ketl in three major periods : 945 – 1030 , from which no significant elements are observable ; 1030 – 90 , when construction and remodeling produced most of the building 's extant features ; and 1100 – 16 , which saw renovation of existing features . In 1983 , comprehensive architectural studies by Lekson and McKenna and dendrochronological reanalysis by Dean and Warren largely verified Hawley 's construction phases , with significant additions and clarifications . Lekson , Thomas C. Windes , and Patricia Fournier , authors of " The Changing Faces of Chetro Ketl " , date the beginning of construction to 990 – 1000 ; they based their estimate on 1 @,@ 285 dated elements from the great house . In their opinion , Chetro Ketl was largely complete by 1075 , with periodic construction occurring there until the mid @-@ 1110s , when the great kiva was remodeled . 
 Hawley 's first period ( 945 – 1030 ) was suggested by tree ring dates scattered throughout later parts of Chetro Ketl . Archeologists subsequently discovered that her second period ( 1030 – 90 ) structure was built directly over an earlier ( 990 – 1030 ) one @-@ story @-@ tall , two @-@ room @-@ wide row of rooms . Lekson shortened Hawley 's second period to 1030 – 75 , and subdivided it into at least eight different construction events , including the successive additions of upper stories along the main room block , running the length of the building . After 1075 , construction consisted of minor additions and alternations , with the exception of a row of three large , Chaco @-@ style second- and third @-@ story round rooms that were added to the plaza @-@ facing center of the main room block during 1075 – 95 . Much of the later construction , including the large Chaco @-@ style kivas , was in McElmo style masonry , using shaped blocks of relatively soft tan colored sandstone instead of the previously preferred harder , denser dark brown sandstone , which may have been quarried out in the central canyon after 1075 . Chetro Ketl required an estimated 50 million sandstone blocks and more than 500 @,@ 000 man @-@ hours to complete . 
 = = = = McElmo = = = = 
 The McElmo Phase was a period in the late 11th and early 12th centuries , when major changes in ceramics and masonry techniques appeared in Chaco Canyon . Chacoans started using painted black @-@ on @-@ white pottery , and the masonry and layout of great houses built during the period , which was the last major construction era in the canyon , differs significantly from those built during the Bonito Phase ( 850 to 1140 ) . Archeologists initially believed that the McElmo style was brought to Chaco Canyon by immigrants from Mesa Verde , but subsequent research suggests the developments were of local origin . McElmo black @-@ on @-@ white pottery was abundant in later contexts at Chetro Ketl , and the problematic McElmo style masonry was used in several later additions to the building , including very characteristic Chaco @-@ style kivas . 
 Chetro Ketl 's Kiva G complex was constructed using McElmo @-@ type masonry , and ceramic evidence uncovered from refuse found in the great house indicates a significant McElmo presence . Much of the masonry in North Block F also appears to be McElmo style . A smaller square building known as the <unk> Unit lies just west of Chetro Ketl ; it contains some McElmo style features . R. Gwinn Vivian ( son of Gordon Vivian ) notes , " The jury is still out on this question , a problem that poses intriguing possibilities for future work . " 
 = = Abandonment = = 
 The Ancestral Puebloans relied on regular rainfall to sustain their agricultural society . This proved challenging in Chaco Canyon , even with consistent precipitation . By 1130 , the rains had diminished and the maize crops that the Chacoans depended on had begun to fail , as the region increasingly suffered from the effects of a devastating , fifty @-@ year drought . After a continuous occupation of more than six hundred years , the Chacoans began to migrate from the canyon . Fagan states that by 1140 " Chaco was finished " . A study of 12th @-@ century burials in the Gallup , New Mexico , area indicates as many as half of the people who lived during the drought died before the age of eighteen , with sixty percent of all deaths occurring before age thirty @-@ five . The study estimated that for every woman , four children were needed to sustain the agriculture workforce . 
 The turning point for Chacoan culture prior to the widespread crop failures of 1130 to 1180 was the especially dry period from 1090 to 1095 . Emigration from Chaco Canyon increased significantly during this period , and Puebloan construction in outlying communities such as Mesa Verde , Salmon , and Aztec , began to flourish . Despite rapid depopulation in the canyon , Chetro Ketl 's great kiva may have been remodeled and used during the early 13th century . A haphazardly applied layer of rubble veneer to ceremonial areas in the great kiva are thought to have been added during an " organized closure " that probably included a " termination ceremony " . Ancient potsherds indicate that the last inhabitants of Chetro Ketl vacated the structure by 1250 . 
 = = Rediscovery = = 
 In the years following the Ancestral Puebloan 's departure from Chaco Canyon , several migrations to the region occurred . During the 15th century , Navajo people emigrated to the area from northwestern Canada , and in the 18th century Spanish explorers and settlers came from the south . The Spanish investigated parts of the San Juan Basin , but there is no record of them ever finding Chaco Canyon . When cartographer Bernardo de Miera y Pacheco drew a map in 1774 of Spanish land holdings in the region , he labeled Chaco Canyon with the word <unk> , but it is unlikely he ever visited the area . In 1823 the governor of New Mexico , José Antonio Vizcarra , discovered ancient ruins in the canyon during a military campaign against the Navajo . Vizcarra 's account is the first historical record of the Chacoan great houses that were " of such antiquity that their inhabitants were not known to Europeans " . In 1844 , Josiah Gregg made the first published reference to Chaco Canyon in his popular book , Commerce of the Prairies . 
 The United States started exploring the region following the Mexican – American War of 1846 – 48 and the acquisition of the New Mexico Territory . During a military campaign against the Navajo in 1849 , Lieutenant James Simpson of the United States Army Corps of Engineers became interested in the canyon 's ruins . A group led by the governor of Jemez Pueblo , Francisco Hosta , explored the canyon ; its members included Simpson and the brothers Richard and Edward Kern , who were respectively an artist and a cartographer . Simpson was impressed by Chetro Ketl 's masonry , which he described as " a combination of science and art which can only be referred to a higher stage of civilization and refinement than is discoverable in the works of Mexicans or Pueblos of the present day . " Simpson and company documented their findings , noting the location and style of the great houses , taking measurements , and sketching the canyon 's major ruins . They described the kivas as " circular apartments sunk in the ground " . Simpson briefly explored Chetro Ketl , documenting six of its round rooms and 124 rooms on the ground floor of the four @-@ story building . He noted an especially well preserved room where " the stone walls still have their plaster upon them in a tolerable state of preservation . " Vivian credits Simpson 's 1850 report detailing their brief exploration of the canyon and Richard H. Kern 's lithographs as the beginning of Chacoan archeology . The scientific investigation of Chaco Canyon started when Richard Wetherill began his exploration of the canyon in 1895 . Wetherill was well known for his discovery of some of the largest Ancestral Puebloan dwellings in Mesa Verde , and after an invitation from amateur archeologist Sidney Palmer to survey Chaco Canyon , organized a one @-@ month expedition to the region . He secured financial backing for a full season soon afterward , and in 1896 full @-@ scale excavations began at Pueblo Bonito . 
 = = = Etymology = = = 
 The true origin and meaning of " Chetro Ketl " is unknown . Lekson and Peter J. McKenna note that , although most of the names given to Chacoan ruins are either Spanish or Navajo , " Chetro Ketl is neither . " A Mexican guide who worked for the first American expedition in 1849 translated it as " rain town " . In 1889 , Navajo historian Washington Mathews reported that in Navajo mythology the building is referred to as <unk> or <unk> , which means " broad @-@ house " . Other Navajo translations include " house in the corner " and " shining house " . 
 = = Excavation = = 
 The first formal excavation of Chetro Ketl was conducted during 1920 and 1921 by Edgar L. Hewett , director of Chaco Canyon 's first archeological field school . He visited the canyon in 1902 , and in 1916 he arranged for the School of American Research to participate in excavations at Chetro Ketl with the Royal Ontario Museum and the Smithsonian Institution . He made some preliminary studies at the end of 1916 , but World War I caused the delay of his plans . When work resumed in 1920 , financial considerations forced the Smithsonian to withdraw its support . 
 Hewett suspended his research during Judd 's 1924 – 27 excavation of Pueblo Bonito , financed by the National Geographic Society , but returned to Chetro Ketl in 1929 with graduate students from his newly founded Department of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of New Mexico . He studied the canyon until 1935 , and several Chaco scholars worked for or with him during this period , including Gordon Vivian ( father of R. Gwinn Vivian ) , Edwin Ferdon , Paul Reiter , and Florence M. Hawley . Hewett 's methods have been widely criticized , and his work judged to have been substandard , particularly in comparison to the work done by the National Geographic Project . He spent several years excavating Chetro Ketl , but never published a detailed account of his research there . Despite this , much is known about his studies from the theses and dissertations written by students who worked with him . 
 Hawley began her studies with Hewett in 1929 , focusing primarily on dendrochronology and ceramic dating . She spent two summers excavating Chetro Ketl 's refuse mound , and demonstrated that charcoal found in it could be used for tree @-@ ring dating . Her 1933 doctoral dissertation showed that the mound 's layers represent a reverse stratigraphy . Material from older refuse mounds was often moved and placed on top of contemporary debris . It was then covered by layers of daily waste before still more older debris was piled on top . This resulted in newer material accumulating at the base of the pile , and older material accruing near the top . Subsequent excavations indicated that the mound was likely created by more than typical household waste ; numerous layers of it are composed of refuse from large @-@ scale feasts that included the ritualistic smashing of pottery . Hawley worked at the site through 1933 , and in Fagan 's opinion her comparison dating of masonry walls and potsherds significantly enhanced the study of Chacoan culture . He credits her with aiding the establishment of one of archeology 's most accurate chronologies . In 1983 , as the only surviving member of Hewett 's 1929 – 33 group of researchers , Hawley noted the difficulties of excavating Chaco Canyon during the Great Depression : " The young archeologists and <unk> of today , struggling to reconstruct Chetro Ketl from the notes , maps , and too scanty publications and incomplete collections of the past , know little of the exigencies which have made their task difficult . " 
 In 1921 , Hewett excavated Chetro Ketl 's great kiva , where he discovered a more ancient one buried 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) below . He also found several macaw feathers , but no copper bells like those found at Pueblo Bonito . Hewett was surprised at the lack of exotic items at the site , where no human burials have been found . In 1931 and 1932 , Reiter and Gordon Vivian discovered caches of turquoise beads and pendants while digging in the great kiva . In all , 17 @,@ 454 beads were recovered from the kiva 's buried niches . In 1947 , when flood waters from Chaco Wash encroached on Chetro Ketl , Vivian rescued a stash of wooden artifacts from an unexcavated room . Archeologists consider the wooden figures , some of which depict birds , unique in the region . Several black @-@ and @-@ white stone necklaces was also uncovered . Barbara J. Mills , author of Key Debates in Chacoan Archaeology , believes the items represent " evidence of intense ceremonial activity " at Chetro Ketl . Lekson notes that after " spectacular amounts of material " were recovered at Pueblo Bonito , " expectations for Chetro Ketl were undoubtedly high " , and although Hewett and his students were ultimately disappointed , he describes the wooden artifacts as " an extraordinary collection " . Despite this , scholars continue to regard Chetro Ketl as a place where relatively few items of archeological interest have been uncovered . 
 Several minerals used for paint pigments were excavated from Chetro Ketl , including charcoal , shale , malachite , iron oxides , hematite , limonite , gypsum , and azurite . <unk> sandals , and bones from the ferruginous hawk and the great horned owl have been found there . The relative lack of exotic material uncovered at Chetro Ketl , such as shells , copper bells , and macaw feathers , may indicate its lesser importance compared to Pueblo Bonito , where those items have been found in abundance . Because Chetro Ketl has only been partially excavated definitive conclusions remain elusive . In 1937 , W. W. Postlethwaite , who had for three seasons directed Hewett 's excavation of Chetro Ketl 's great kiva , oversaw the final work at the site conducted by the University of New Mexico and the School of American Research . 
 = = = Artifacts = = = 
 Lekson describes Chetro Ketl as " notoriously sterile " , and states that " it is impossible to say how much material was recovered during the many seasons " of excavation there . Field notes indicate that while several major artifacts , including baskets , sandals , painted wood fragments , digging sticks , arrow heads , and crushed pots were found at the great house , the whereabouts of most of these items is " one of the great archaeological mysteries of the Southwest " . He ascribes the " almost total disappearance " of the Chetro Ketl artifacts , which were viewed as unimpressive in comparison to those found at Pueblo Bonito , as a consequence of Hewett 's flippant treatment of the collection . The Museum of New Mexico holds several items excavated from Chetro Ketl , including pieces of turquoise , a black @-@ on @-@ white pottery canteen , and a fourteen @-@ foot @-@ long stone and shell necklace . 
 = = Description = = 
 Chetro Ketl contained approximately 400 rooms and was the largest great house by area in Chaco Canyon ; sections of it reached four stories , three of which remain . The building covers nearly 3 acres ( 1 @.@ 2 ha ) , with approximately half of that in the enclosed plaza , which was lined by wings of rooms to the north , east , and west . Chetro Ketl 's perimeter is 1 @,@ 540 feet ( 470 m ) . The great house is a D @-@ shaped structure ; its east @-@ facing wall is 280 feet ( 85 m ) long , and the north wall is more than 450 feet ( 140 m ) long . Rooms were constructed three @-@ deep and three or four stories tall , and terraced so that the ground level that faced the plaza in the center of the building was one @-@ story . 
 Chetro Ketl had twelve kivas : two large ones in the west wing plaza , one of which is a great kiva , and ten in the central room block , including one known as a tower kiva . The refuse mound was 205 feet ( 62 m ) long , 120 feet ( 37 m ) wide , and 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) tall ; it contained between 219 @,@ 000 and 275 @,@ 000 cubic feet ( 6 @,@ 200 and 7 @,@ 800 m3 ) of debris . Chetro Ketl 's plaza is raised above the surrounding land by 5 @.@ 75 feet ( 1 @.@ 75 m ) , a feature that is unique in the canyon , where the plazas of all other great houses are level with the surrounding landscape . 
 At the front of the building is a mysterious feature consisting of two closely spaced parallel walls that archeologists call " the moat " . The long and narrow chamber runs along the outside wall , and appears to have been backfilled around the same time that the plaza was raised , c . 1070 . The original purpose of the feature is unknown , but tunnels between rooms are found in more northerly Puebloan sites , and the moat would have facilitated movement between Chetro Ketl 's wings . 
 A narrow slit along the north wall 's outside surface indicates the presence of an ancient balcony . There are several rooms attached to the rear of the structure that lack direct access to the main building ; these are believed to have been dedicated to community storage . Chetro Ketl and Pueblo Bonito are the only two great houses in Chaco Canyon with corner doorways . 
 = = = Great kiva = = = 
 Great kivas are always much larger and deeper than Chaco @-@ style kivas . Whereas the walls of great kivas always extend above the surrounding landscape , the walls of Chaco @-@ style kivas are flush with the surrounding landscape . Chaco @-@ style kivas are often found incorporated into the central room blocks of great houses , but great kivas are always separate from core structures . Great kivas almost always have a bench that encircles the inner space , but this feature is not found in Chaco @-@ style kivas . Great kivas also tend to include floor vaults , which may have served as foot drums for ceremonial dancers , but Chaco @-@ style kivas do not . 
 Whereas many of the great kivas in Chaco Canyon are located adjacent to or isolated from their associated great house , Chetro Ketl 's , which is 62 @.@ 5 feet ( 19 @.@ 1 m ) in diameter , lies within the pueblo 's walls . The earliest and lowest floor lies 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) below the current plaza surface . The present floor of the kiva is on average 9 @.@ 25 feet ( 2 @.@ 82 m ) below . Several peripheral rooms abutted the structure , which is located in the southeast corner of the space ; a smaller round room , known as the Court Kiva , lies 98 feet ( 30 m ) to the west , in the plaza 's south @-@ central area . The Court Kiva began as a Chaco @-@ style kiva , but was later remodeled to include several of the defining features of a great kiva . 
 The outer walls of the great kiva are 2 @.@ 5 feet ( 0 @.@ 76 m ) to 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) thick , and date to 1062 – 90 . Hawley identified the masonry as Type III , with a crude Type IV veneer covering the bench that postdates the final construction period ( 1100 – 16 ) . An 18 foot ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) by 10 foot ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) antechamber is attached to the north end of the space ; the passageway between them contained a stairway that rose 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) in nine steps from the kiva floor . 
 Though few remains of it were found , the great kiva 's roof was most likely flat rather than domed , as was typical of smaller kivas in the canyon . It was supported by four large posts , upon which four more beams were attached . This formed the roof 's main structure , which was covered with a layer of secondary beams , then juniper splints and bark , before being finished with clay . It is not known if the roofs of great kivas were constructed level with the exterior walls or raised above them , but it is believed that the space between the floor and the roof in Chetro Ketl 's great kiva was probably not much more than what would be required for average standing height , approximately 5 to 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 to 1 @.@ 8 m ) . 
 Thirty @-@ nine crypts , measuring approximately 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) in height , 1 @.@ 1 feet ( 0 @.@ 34 m ) wide , and 1 @.@ 25 feet ( 0 @.@ 38 m ) deep , have been uncovered in the great kiva . They are spaced approximately 5 @.@ 3 feet ( 1 @.@ 6 m ) apart and located around the inner circumference of the outer wall . Some artifacts have been recovered from the crypts , but their purpose is unknown ; they may have been shelves or specialized altars . A large bench , measuring 3 @.@ 33 feet ( 1 @.@ 01 m ) wide by 2 @.@ 75 feet ( 0 @.@ 84 m ) tall , encircles the inside of the space . A firebox , measuring 4 @.@ 83 feet ( 1 @.@ 47 m ) by 5 @.@ 3 feet ( 1 @.@ 6 m ) and 1 @.@ 6 feet ( 0 @.@ 49 m ) tall , was located 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) south of the center of the kiva , and a fire screen that helped supply draft air was located 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) away from the firebox . 
 = = = Colonnade = = = 
 The site contains a colonnade that Lekson , Windes , and Fournier describe as " prominent , even dominating within the plaza " , and " possibly the defining form at Chetro Ketl or even at Chaco . " It is not only unique to Chaco Canyon , but also to Ancestral Puebloan architecture as a whole . The nearest similar structure is located more than five hundred miles away at Casas Grandes , in northwestern Mexico . Constructed sometime after 1105 , the plaza @-@ facing columns were among the last additions to Chetro Ketl . The colonnade 's placement and orientation to the canyon indicate that it was intended to be viewed from inside the building . It was later filled in with masonry to accommodate additional living space . It was 93 feet ( 28 m ) long and contained thirteen columns . 
 Several scholars have detected a Mesoamerican influence in the feature ; Ferdon described it as a " column @-@ fronted gallery " that was " wholly untraditional " in Ancestral Puebloan architecture . He proposed that it was inspired by a Quetzalcoatl cult whose traditions were brought to the region by <unk> traders . In his opinion the influence can also be seen in the site 's tower kiva . Lekson , Windes , and Fournier believe the architectural parallels between the colonnade at Chetro Ketl and structures in Mexico " are probably attributable to the adoption of Mesoamerican symbols appropriated by the flow of ideas carried by merchants " . In their opinion , the connection " may have been the result of an interaction mechanism of indirect contact between nuclear Mesoamerica and Chaco though northwestern Mexico . " They believe the colonnade " is a local architectural interpretation of Mexican models , modified to suit local materials and techniques . " 
 = = = Agriculture and pottery = = = 
 Chaco Canyon is watered by winter storms and localized summer rains that fill the arroyos . Chaco Wash is deep , and it drains to the water table located 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) below the canyon floor . Farming terraces on the mesa wall behind Chetro Ketl may have been used for growing specialized crops such as tobacco , and canals running from Pueblo Bonito to Chetro Ketl probably carried rain water . Chetro Ketl 's position in downtown Chaco and its proximity to South Gap further aided agricultural efforts near the great house , as summer storms tended to linger in the opening , funneling moisture to the area . 
 There is no obvious visual evidence of the linear features usually associated with farm fields in the land surrounding Chetro Ketl , but in 1929 aerial black @-@ and @-@ white images by Charles Lindbergh revealed what appeared to be a rectangular plot . In the early 1970s the National Park Service ( NPS ) developed a remote sensing program to further investigate the area using color video imagery . When enhanced and viewed in black @-@ and @-@ white , the video revealed a well @-@ defined grid pattern within a larger rectangular section of land near Chetro Ketl . The NPS employed two types of ground level remote sensing devices to search for magnetic and soil anomalies in the alluvium of the canyon floor . A soil density study proved inconclusive , but a magnetometer identified a rectangular feature 50 by 65 feet ( 15 by 20 m ) , roughly the same size as those seen in Lindbergh 's aerial photographs . The NPS researchers proposed that water had deposited iron @-@ bearing clays in the plots , with the center showing the strongest magnetic evidence . Subsequent comparisons with older data reinforced their conclusion . They determined that had the plots been under heavy alluvium they would not have been detected . 
 In Vivian 's opinion , the Chetro Ketl field represents one of the best examples of Chacoan farming . Approximately 20 acres ( 8 @.@ 1 ha ) of land were divided into 42 plots measuring 75 by 45 feet ( 23 by 14 m ) , with parallel irrigation canals that supplied water to individual parcels . Several scholars have disputed this interpretation , suggesting that the area may instead be the location of an unfinished great house , or it could have been used for mixing mortar or raising frogs and freshwater shrimp . Soil analysis indicates that the field received water from both Chaco Wash and side canyons . Twenty @-@ three similar fields have been detected in Chaco Canyon , but Chetro Ketl 's is the only one that has been extensively surveyed . Archeologists estimate that between 2 @,@ 600 and 3 @,@ 600 acres ( 1 @,@ 100 and 1 @,@ 500 ha ) of arable land was available to Chacoan farmers , whose crops could support approximately 4 @,@ 000 people . <unk> analysis indicates the Chetro Ketl field was last used in 1250 . 
 Studies of ancient corn cobs found at Pueblo Bonito suggest that large quantities of the foodstuff were imported to the canyon from the Chuska Mountains , 50 miles ( 80 km ) west , and the San Juan and Animas River areas , 56 miles ( 90 km ) north . Archeologists believe the corn was imported to help feed groups of laborers during large @-@ scale construction projects . The corn cobs are longer , with more rows of kernels , than most examples from the region . This may indicate genetic differences , superior growing conditions , or " preferential watering " of crops intended for consumption at Chaco Canyon . 
 The black @-@ on @-@ white painted pottery found at Chaco Canyon originated from various places throughout the Four Corners region , including the Red Mesa Valley , northeastern Arizona , the San Juan River , and the Chuska Valley , forty miles distant . Whereas most of the gray ware , non @-@ decorative or utility , pottery uncovered at Puebloan sites was produced locally , more than half of the vessels found in the canyon were imported from places like the Chuska Valley , which supplied the majority of utility pottery found in the region . 
 Red wares were imported from southeastern Utah until c . 1000 , when the Chacoans switched to orange ware products originating from northeastern Arizona , near Kayenta . After 1000 , almost no pottery was fired in the canyon , but was instead produced in outlying communities with access to a steady supply of firewood for their kilns . During the period from 1030 to 1100 , significantly more pottery was imported to the canyon than before . The extensive Puebloan trade network that dispersed stoneware products throughout the region suggests that , although evidence of large @-@ scale production is lacking , proficient local artisans supplied distant communities as well as their own . 
 = = = Purpose = = = 
 Lekson believes that Chetro Ketl was most likely not occupied by scores of families , and in that sense was not a pueblo as early archeologists had concluded . He also notes that , while most if not all round rooms in the canyon have traditionally been labeled as kivas , the smaller ones found at Chetro Ketl were most likely not kivas , " but the final and most elaborate form of the pit @-@ house " , which had served as the region 's primary housing structure during the five hundred years prior to the settlement of Chaco Canyon . He proposed that Chacoan great houses were royal palaces ; Chetro Ketl was a residence for the elite , but also a central location for governance , storage , <unk> , ritual , and bureaucracy . Many scholars disagree because they assume " palaces imply states " , and " it is generally accepted that no Native state ever existed " north of Mexico . In his opinion , the view that palaces cannot exist outside states is misguided , and societies like Chaco may have achieved comparable political complexity on a smaller than typical scale . He considers the political " glass <unk> " an " almost racist " remnant of early archeologists who assumed Native American political sophistication was , by definition , limited to " chiefdoms " and not capable of attaining statehood . 
 The consistent lack of artifacts and features in excavated Chacoan rooms suggests they were used primarily for grain storage , but because their combined areas appear to exceed what would reasonably have been needed for foodstuffs – a large crop of corn from all the arable land near Chaco would fit into two rows of rooms at Chetro Ketl – this interpretation lacks support amongst archeologists . Because so many of these rooms are featureless interior spaces that lie below several stories , the scale of their construction may have been motivated by what architects call " massing " ; building structures with the primary intention of impressing onlookers . 
 The rooms of Chetro Ketl may have served as storage space for ritual objects , and the great house may have been occupied primarily by groups of priests , also housing pilgrims during community events , when the population of the canyon increased dramatically . Judge notes that these pilgrims probably assisted in the construction of Chetro Ketl , thus " confirming their affiliation with the larger ritual alliance " . The area between Chetro Ketl and Pueblo Bonito may have served as a central location for ceremonies . Because water was crucial to their survival , Chacoan rituals most likely focused on prayers for rain . 
 = = Chacoan system = = 
 A long @-@ distance communication system that used smoke and mirrors existed in the region , and direct lines of sight have been established between Pueblo Alto , <unk> Mountain in northern New Mexico , and Chimney Rock Pueblo in southern Colorado . Messages could have been relayed between these three points within minutes . On the mesa behind Chaco Canyon is an ancient road that runs north from Chetro Ketl , then northward along the east side of Pueblo Alto before joining with the Great North Road . The Pueblo Alto road network functioned between 1050 and 1140 . It facilitated access to watering holes , terraced farming areas , and enabled interaction between Pueblo Alto and great houses like Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl . It also led to a community along <unk> Wash . It may have served an important function in the transport of household goods , construction timber , and people throughout the San Juan Basin . Several road segments appear to be related to a row of Chetro Ketl 's exterior rooms , which are thought to have been community storage space . 
 In 1982 Robert Powers theorized that the road network " suggests an <unk> organization and settlement system of regional extent " . Because " Chaco Canyon is the convergence point of all presently documented extra @-@ canyon roads " , the area may represent a locus of regional control , or " the apex of the hierarchical system " . Powers believes that great houses like Chetro Ketl were involved in civic coordination between the canyon sites and outlying communities . In 1993 David R. Wilcox proposed that a state @-@ level society developed at Chaco , with an administrative center at Pueblo Bonito or Chetro Ketl . In a 2003 study of Chacoan artifacts , Frances Joan <unk> stated that the number of warrior @-@ class individuals that would have been needed to support such a state – Wilcox estimated 500 – 1 @,@ 000 – precludes his theory , and Wilcox is assuming a " greater Chacoan organizational complexity than any other scholar to date " . 
 Lekson developed a theory called the Chaco Meridian , which is based on architectural similarities between the Ancestral Puebloan sites at Aztec Ruins and Chaco Canyon , and <unk> at Casas Grandes in northern Mexico . He believes the sites were intentionally located on the same approximate line of longitude ( 107 ° 57 ' 25 " ) , and this indicates a ceremonial connection between them . The Great North Road roughly follows the Chaco Meridian , and many of the ancient roads in the area appear to follow it towards key sites in the basin . 
 Judge notes that " virtually all researchers recognize a strong ritual component to Chacoan authority and view the Chacoans as having formed a regional center with a compelling and integrating body of ceremony at its core . " Preliminary population estimates for the canyon ranged as high as ten thousand people , but in his opinion a figure closer to two thousand is more likely . He views Chaco as a ceremonial center and a " place of ritual architecture " , which pilgrims from throughout the San Juan Basin 's two hundred great house communities would visit . These pilgrims brought large quantities of goods and raw materials to the canyon , including exotics such as turquoise and shell beads , and also ceramics , timber , and food . 
 Neutron activation analysis linked an artifact from Chetro Ketl to the Cerrillos Turquoise Mines , located 20 miles ( 32 km ) south of Santa Fe , New Mexico . Analysis of chipped stone from Chetro Ketl 's trash mound indicates that more than fifty percent of the chert found there was imported from Washington Pass in the Chuska Mountains , 47 miles ( 76 km ) away . The Chacoans enjoyed a bounty of imports from throughout the San Juan Basin , but little evidence of exports from the canyon has been found . This suggests they were consumers , but not producers or distributors of goods . 
 Scholars continue to debate whether Chacoan organization was based on primarily political or primarily ritual considerations . Archeological evidence suggests that the residents of great houses like Chetro Ketl were of a higher social class than those living in smaller settlements , which may indicate a systemic inequality that is considered a hallmark of hierarchal political systems . Others view Chaco as an egalitarian society , with an economy driven by its function as the region 's ceremonial center . Because there has been little to no modern excavation in the canyon , the question remains largely unanswered . Lynne Sebastian suggests that any analysis based on a strict dichotomy of ritual versus political purpose is inherently misguided , because the Chacoans were most likely deeply influenced by both . 
 Lekson believes that by the later period ( 1075 to 1140 ) " Pueblo Bonito , Chetro Ketl and Pueblo del Arroyo ... together with the numerous other structures in the central canyon , should be considered a coherent analytical settlement unit . " He views the structures near South Gap " as a larger settlement of significant complexity " that " when coupled with Chaco 's regional centrality and relatively high population density " should be considered " nearly urban " . He notes that by the mid @-@ 12th century , " Chaco was much closer to being a city than simply a canyon full of independent agricultural towns and villages . " At its peak , the Chacoan system covered an estimated 30 @,@ 000 to 40 @,@ 000 square miles ( 78 @,@ 000 to 104 @,@ 000 km2 ) , an area roughly the size of Portugal . The population of the region at the beginning of the 11th century was approximately 55 @,@ 000 people . 
 = = Deterioration and preservation = = 
 Lekson and McKenna note that following the rediscovery of Chetro Ketl in the early 19th century , the building 's " pace of dissolution increased alarmingly ... [ it ] has deteriorated at a faster rate over the last century and a half than in the previous six . " Chetro Ketl 's wooden elements have proven especially vulnerable in a region that lacks timber , with soldiers , cattlemen , and transients scavenging them from the structure . The rear balcony was present in 1901 , but by 1921 the beams had been removed by people scouring the canyon for wood . The process of uncovering beams during excavation has further hastened their deterioration . Chaco Wash , which deepens and widens during summer rain showers , also threatens the canyon 's ruins . The once prominent refuse mound has been all but destroyed by repeated trenching and by diverting arroyos near Chetro Ketl . Treasure hunting , livestock grazing , and early National Park Service stabilization efforts also contributed to the degradation of the structure , as have deep excavations that left Chaco Wash prone to flooding . Archeology was responsible for the catastrophic effects of a 1947 flood that destroyed the walls of twenty rooms and collapsed 40 feet ( 12 m ) of the north wall . It also toppled Chetro Ketl 's tallest remnants . 
 During the late 1980s , a reburial program was undertaken at Chetro Ketl that sought to preserve the structure 's original timbers by <unk> portions of the site with soil . Because only a thin layer of overburden was applied , specialized geosynthetic materials were added to help keep the area dry . The program also developed techniques that facilitate the sampling of ancient wood for assessment of deterioration . Lekson and McKenna note , " the visible building is far from pristine . Most walls have undergone generations of structural and cosmetic treatment ... Chetro Ketl is an artifact deteriorating before our eyes . If the reader is inspired to questions that cannot be answered by the present study , be advised that Chetro Ketl 's ability to answer in detail is slowly , but surely , disappearing . " 
 = Alpine ibex = 
 The Alpine ibex ( Capra ibex ) , also known as the <unk> or <unk> , is a species of wild goat that lives in the mountains of the European Alps . It is a sexually dimorphic species with larger males who carry larger , curved horns . The coat colour is typically brownish grey . Alpine ibex tend to live in steep , rough terrain above the snow line . They are also social , although adult males and females segregate for most of the year , coming together only to mate . Four distinct groups exist ; adult male groups , female @-@ <unk> groups , groups of young individuals , and mixed sex groups . 
 During the breeding season , males fight for access to females and use their long horns in agonistic behaviours . After being extirpated from most areas by the 19th century , the Alpine ibex was successfully reintroduced to parts of its historical range and all individuals living today descend from the stock in Gran Paradiso National Park in Aosta Valley and from the neighbouring French valley of Maurienne , now part of the Vanoise National Park linked to the former . These two national parks are connected and have been especially created to help the ibex to thrive . The ibex is the emblem of both the Gran Paradiso National Park and the Vanoise National Park . The species is currently listed as of least concern by the IUCN . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The Alpine ibex was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 . It is classified in the genus Capra ( Latin for " goat " ) with at least seven other species of wild goat . Both Capra and Ovis ( sheep ) descended from a goral @-@ like animal from the Miocene and early Pliocene , whose fossils are found in Kenya , China and Slovenia . The genus <unk> appears in China during the late Miocene and appears to have been intermediate between gorals and goats . Fossils of Alpine ibex date back to the late Pleistocene , when it and the Spanish ibex probably evolved from the extinct Pleistocene species Capra <unk> . The Nubian ( C. <unk> ) , Walia ( C. <unk> ) and Siberian ibex ( C. sibirica ) are sometimes considered to be subspecies of the Alpine ibex , giving populations in the Alps the trinomial of C. i. ibex . 
 = = Appearance = = 
 Compared with other members of its genus , the Alpine ibex has a short , broad head and a duller coat . It has brownish grey hair over most of the body , a pale abdomen and slightly darker markings on the chin and throat and in a stripe along the back . They moult twice a year , firstly in April or May , and then again in September , when they replace the short summer coat with thicker hair and a woolly undercoat . 
 Males commonly grow to a height of 90 to 101 centimetres ( 35 to 40 in ) at the withers , with a body length of 149 to 171 centimetres ( 59 to 67 in ) and weigh from 67 to 117 kilograms ( 148 to 258 lb ) . Females are noticeably smaller , with a shoulder height of 73 to 84 centimetres ( 29 to 33 in ) , a body length of 121 to 141 centimetres ( 48 to 56 in ) , and a weight of 17 to 32 kilograms ( 37 to 71 lb ) . Both male and female Alpine ibexes have large , backwards @-@ curving , horns with numerous ridges along their length . At 69 to 98 centimetres ( 27 to 39 in ) , those of the males are substantially larger than those of females , which reach only 18 to 35 centimetres ( 7 @.@ 1 to 13 @.@ 8 in ) in length . 
 = = Distribution and ecology = = 
 The Alpine ibex was , at one point , restricted only to the Gran Paradiso National Park in northern Italy , and in the Maurienne Valley in the French Alps but in recent years it was both reintroduced to and recolonised most of the European Alps , and is now found in most of all the Italian and French alpine ranges , southern Germany , Switzerland and Austria . It was also introduced to Bulgaria and Slovenia . 
 An excellent climber , its preferred habitat is the rocky region along the snow line above alpine forests , where it occupies steep , rough terrain at elevations of 1 @,@ 800 to 3 @,@ 300 metres ( 5 @,@ 900 to 10 @,@ 800 ft ) . Alpine ibex are typically absent from woodland areas although adult males in densely populated areas may stay in larch and mixed larch @-@ spruce woodland if there is no snow . Males spend the winter in coniferous forests . For most of the year , males and females occupy different habitat . Females rely on steep terrain more so than males . Males use lowland meadows during the spring , which is when snow melts and green grass appears . They then climb to alpine meadows during the summer . When winter arrives , both sexes move to steep rocky slopes that amass little snow . They prefer slopes of 30 – 45 ° and use small caves and overhangs for shelter . Home ranges are highly variable , depending on the availability of resources , and vary in size throughout the year . Figures of anything from 180 to 2 @,@ 800 hectares ( 0 @.@ 69 to 10 @.@ 81 sq mi ; 1 @.@ 8 to 28 @.@ 0 km2 ) have been recorded . Home ranges tend to be largest during summer and autumn , smallest in winter and intermediate in spring . Female home ranges are usually smaller than those of males . Alpine ibexes appear to have a low rate of predation and typically die of age , starvation or disease in Gran Paradiso . 
 = = = Foraging = = = 
 Alpine ibexes are strictly herbivorous , with over half of their diet consisting of grasses , and the remainder being a mixture of moss , flowers , leaves , and twigs . If leaves and shoots are out of reach , they often stand on their rear legs to reach this food . Grass genera that are the most commonly eaten are Agrostis , <unk> , Calamagrostis , Festuca , <unk> , Poa , <unk> and Trisetum . The climbing ability of the Alpine ibex is such that it has been observed standing on the sheer face of a dam , where it licks the stonework to obtain mineral salts . 
 = = Life history = = 
 Although the Alpine ibex is a social species , they segregate sexually and spatially depending on the season . Four types of groups exist . Adult male groups , female @-@ offspring groups , groups of young individuals 2 – 3 years old , and mixed sex groups . Young groups are numerous at the beginning of summer but are expelled by females at the end of their gestation period . Female and offspring groups occur year @-@ round , at least in an area of the French Alps . Mixed sex groups of adult males and females occur during breeding , which lasts from December to January . By April and May , the adults separate . The largest aggregations of either sex occur during June and July . Gatherings of males begin to decrease during October and November , and are lowest from the rut from December to March . The males then leave their separate wintering areas and gather again . 
 There is a linear dominance hierarchy among males . In small populations , which are more cohesive , male ibex know their place in the hierarchy based on memories of past encounters while in mobile and large groups , where encounters with strangers are common , rank is based on horn size . Antagonistic behavior in males can come in the form of " direct " or " indirect " aggression . With direct aggression , one male bumps another with its horns or places itself in front of its opponent . It stands on its hind legs and comes down on his opponent with its horns . This may signal that it is ready to clash or it may be attempting a real clash . Indirect aggression is mostly intimidation displays . 
 = = = Reproduction and growth = = = 
 The breeding season starts in December , and typically lasts around six weeks . During this time , male herds break up into smaller groups that search for females . The rut takes place in two phases . In the first phase , the male groups interact with the females who are all in oestrous . The higher the male 's rank , the closer he can get to a female . Males perform courtship displays . In the second phase of the rut , one male separates from his group to follow an individual female . He displays to her and guards her from other males . Before copulation , the female moves her tail and courtship becomes more intensive . They copulate and then he rejoins his group and reverts to the first phase . Gestation lasts around 167 days , and results in the birth of one or two kids , with twins making up about 20 % of births . 
 Alpine ibex reach sexual maturity at eighteen months , but females do not reach their maximum body size for five to six years , and males not for nine to eleven years . The horns grow throughout life , growing most rapidly during the second year of life , and thereafter by about 8 centimetres ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) a year , eventually slowing to half that rate once the animal reaches ten years of age . Alpine ibex live for up to nineteen years in the wild . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 The Alpine ibex historically ranged through France , Italy , Switzerland , Liechtenstein , Bavaria , Austria and Slovenia . Starting in the early 1500s and with firearms becoming common , the overall population declined due to overexploitation and poaching . The ibex became extinct in Switzerland and Germany by the 18th century , and was extinct in Austria and northeastern Italy by the 19th century . They remained only in and around the adjacent Gran Paradiso and Vanoise <unk> , then both part of the Kingdom of Piedmont . Located in the western Italian Alps and the Maurienne valley in the north eastern French alps , bordering the Vanoise and Gran Paradiso Massif , the park was declared a royal hunting reserve in 1854 by Vittorio Emanuele II . 
 Ibex were protected from poaching and their numbers increased , reaching 3 @,@ 020 in 1914 . The ibex enjoyed further protection when Gran Paradiso was made into a national park in 1922 . Animals from this stock both drifted naturally and were introduced to other areas . By 1976 , the number of populations of ibex numbered 104 . Today , the total population of Alpine ibex is over 20 @,@ 000 and is considered to be of Least Concern by the IUCN . However , introduced populations of ibex appear to have low genetic diversity .

 Mauro De Mauro ( born September 6 , 1921 – disappeared September 16 , 1970 ) was an Italian investigative journalist . Originally a supporter of the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini he eventually became a journalist with the left @-@ leaning newspaper L 'Ora in Palermo . He disappeared in September 1970 and his body has not yet been found . The disappearance and probable death of the " inconvenient journalist " ( <unk> <unk> ) – as he became known as a result of his investigative reporting – remains one of the unsolved mysteries in Italian history . 
 Several explanations for his disappearance are current . One is related to the death of the president of Italy 's state @-@ owned oil and gas conglomerate ENI , Enrico Mattei . Another is that De Mauro had discovered drug trafficking between Sicily and the United States . A third explanation links his disappearance with the <unk> Borghese , a planned right @-@ wing coup d 'état ( the plan failed in December 1970 ) . Apparently De Mauro was convinced that he had got hold of a story of a lifetime . Before his disappearance he told colleagues at the newspaper L 'Ora , " I have a scoop that is going to shake Italy . " 
 = = Fascist past = = 
 De Mauro was born in 1921 in Foggia , Apulia . His father Oscar De Mauro belonged to a reputable family of doctors and pharmacists that had been living in Foggia for several generations . His mother Clementina <unk> came from Naples and was a math teacher . His younger brother Tullio De Mauro ( born March 31 , 1932 ) is a linguist and politician , who became Minister of Education in 2000 @-@ 2001 . 
 De Mauro was a supporter of the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini . After the armistice with the Allied Forces in September 1943 , he choose to follow the hard @-@ line fascist regime of the Italian Social Republic ( Repubblica Sociale Italiana – RSI ) in German @-@ held northern Italy . During the German military occupation of Rome in 1943 @-@ 1944 , he was vice @-@ commander of Police under the Commander Caruso , informant of the SS Captain Erich <unk> and of the Colonel Herbert Kappler . He was also a member of the Koch Band , a special unit of the Home Security in the Italian Social Republic . Using a variety of aliases ( Roberto Marini , Mauro <unk> , Mariani , etc . ) , De Mauro managed to infiltrate several resistance organizations ( in Rome and Milan ) to hunt the partisans . 
 He and his wife Elda volunteered to join the Decima MAS , a brutal anti @-@ partisan force under the command of prince Junio Valerio Borghese , also known as the " Black Prince " . De Mauro worked for the journal La <unk> ( The Galley ) of the propaganda unit of the military formation . He was arrested during the liberation in Milan in April 1945 . He escaped from the prison camp <unk> ( Tuscany ) in December 1945 and took refuge in Naples with his young wife ( where he also had two daughters , Junia and Franca Valeria , named after Junio Valerio Borghese ) Accused of having participated in the Fosse Ardeatine massacre in March 1944 in which 335 people were executed , he was absolved by the court in 1948 . 
 = = Journalist in Sicily = = 
 In 1948 , De Mauro moved to Palermo in Sicily under an assumed name , and worked for local newspapers such as Il Tempo di Sicilia , and Il <unk> di Sicilia . In 1959 he started working for L 'Ora , a Communist @-@ oriented paper . Other journalists were puzzled about De Mauro 's presence at the newspaper : he had been a supporter of Mussolini until the bitter end and fought in the brutal war against the anti @-@ Fascist partisans . Rumour had it that his nose had been broken by partisans . 
 At L 'Ora , De Mauro joined a group of crack investigative reporters . From the mid @-@ 1950s to the 1970s the left @-@ leaning newspaper often hit the national spotlight for its investigations and denunciations about the ties between the Sicilian Mafia and corrupt politicians . These were the golden years of investigations , signed by journalists like Mauro De Mauro , Felice <unk> and Mario <unk> . De Mauro could exercise his skills as a successful investigative reporter . He wrote on drug trafficking and the Sack of Palermo , the construction boom in the 1950s and 1960s that led to the destruction of the city 's green belt and ancient villas . He also published articles about the collusion between the Mafia and politics . In 1960 he was among the winners of the <unk> , one of the most important Italian journalism awards , for his crime investigations . 
 In 1962 , he was the first to publish a detailed map of the Sicilian Mafia , which was confirmed 22 years later by the Mafia pentito ( turncoat ) Tommaso Buscetta in his testimony to Judge Giovanni Falcone . In January 1962 he published a series of articles in L 'Ora disclosing the testimony of <unk> Allegra , a medical doctor and a member of the Mafia from 1916 until his arrest in 1937 . Upon being arrested , Allegra disclosed his membership and testified about Mafia activities . It was one of the first testimonies about the Mafia from within , but the document had been neglected until De Mauro republished it . 
 After these and other revelations De Mauro became a target for the Mafia . " De Mauro was a walking corpse , " said Buscetta . " Cosa Nostra had been forced to ' forgive ' the journalist because his death would arouse too much suspicion , but at the first opportunity he would have to pay for the scoop . The death sentence had only been temporarily suspended . " 
 = = Mattei affair = = 
 In 1962 he investigated the mysterious death of Enrico Mattei , the powerful president of Italy 's state @-@ owned oil and gas conglomerate ENI who died in suspicious circumstances in a plane crash on October 27 , 1962 . During his controversial tenure of ENI , Mattei had made many enemies . He tried to break the oligopoly of the ' Seven Sisters ' ( a term Mattei coined to refer to the dominant oil companies of the mid @-@ 20th century ) , and brokered an oil import deal with the Soviet Union in the middle of the Cold War over intense protests from NATO and the U.S. in 1959 , while supporting independence movements against colonial powers such as Algeria . 
 The U.S. National Security Council described Mattei as an irritation and an obstacle in a classified report from 1958 . The French could not forgive him for doing business with the pro @-@ independence movement in Algeria . Responsibility for his death has been attributed to the CIA , to the French extreme @-@ nationalist group , the OAS , and to the Sicilian Mafia . 
 In September 1970 , De Mauro was again investigating the case , upon request of the movie director Francesco Rosi for the movie Il caso Mattei ( The Mattei Affair ) , which would be released in 1972 . He was convinced that Mattei 's aircraft had been sabotaged and looked into possible links of the Mafia with the crash . Two days before his disappearance , De Mauro interviewed Graziano Verzotto , a Christian Democrat politician and former right @-@ hand man of Mattei on Sicily . Verzotto had been head of public relations of ENI and knew De Mauro quite well . Verzotto also knew Mafia boss Giuseppe Di Cristina quite well ; he had been best man at De Cristina ’ s wedding . Verzotto had been with Mattei on his airplane the day before it crashed . De Mauro was convinced that he had got hold of a story of a lifetime . Before his disappearance he told colleagues at the newspaper L 'Ora , “ I have a scoop that is going to shake Italy . ” 
 = = Disappearance = = 
 De Mauro was kidnapped on the evening of September 16 , 1970 , while coming back home from work , in the via delle <unk> in Palermo . Thousands of police and Carabinieri with helicopters and dogs combed Sicily in vain in search of the reporter . De Mauro ’ s body has never been found , a victim of the so @-@ called lupara bianca , despite intensive search efforts by Palermo police assisted by top @-@ level forces from Rome and even a special investigative committee of the Italian Parliament . 
 Over the years , the investigations into the disappearance of De Mauro by the Carabinieri and the police followed widely divergent leads . Colonel Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa and Captain Giuseppe Russo of the Carabinieri were are among the first to work on his case . Years later , and in different circumstances , both were murdered by the Mafia . They focused on the lead of drug trafficking . According to them , the journalist would have been a victim of lupara bianca after discovering leads on drug trafficking by the Mafia between Sicily and the United States . 
 The first inquiries of the police by Bruno <unk> and Boris Giuliano instead focused on the lead of De Mauro ’ s investigations into the death of Mattei , prompted by the disappearance a few pages of notes and a tape with the last speech given by Mattei from De Mauro ’ s office . The investigations were seriously hampered due to deviations by people within the Italian police forces and secret services . According to police inspector Boris Giuliano there was " someone at the ministry in Rome that does not want to go to the bottom of the death of De Mauro . " According to Giuliano an order to scale down the investigation was issued by the head of the secret service , Vito Miceli , allegedly involved in the Borghese coup . Miceli had been in contact with the mafiosi Giuseppe Calderone and Giuseppe Di Cristina who wanted to support the coup , scheduled for December 1970 . 
 = = Italian mystery = = 
 The disappearance of De Mauro remained a mystery and a matter for many speculations . In May 1994 Mafia turncoat Tommaso Buscetta declared that the Sicilian Mafia had been involved in the murder of Mattei . He also claimed that De Mauro was killed because of his investigations into the death of Mattei . According to Buscetta , Mattei was killed at the request of the American Cosa Nostra because his oil policies had damaged important American interests in the Middle East . The American Mafia in turn was possibly doing a favour to the large oil companies . 
 Buscetta claimed that the killing was organized by Mafia bosses Salvatore Greco " <unk> " , Stefano Bontade and Giuseppe Di Cristina on the request of Angelo Bruno , a Sicilian born Mafia boss from Philadelphia . Gaetano <unk> , another pentito , declared that a special agreement had been achieved between Cosa Nostra and " some foreigners " for the elimination of Mattei which was organized by Giuseppe Di Cristina . These statements triggered new inquiries , including the exhumation of Mattei 's corpse . 
 Buscetta claimed that Mafia boss Stefano Bontade organized De Mauro ’ s kidnap , because his investigations into the death of Mattei came very close to the Mafia , and Bontade ’ s own role in the affair . Another pentito , Francesco Di Carlo , declared in 2001 that De Mauro was killed because he had learned that one of his former fascist friends , Prince Junio Valerio Borghese , was planning a coup d 'état ( the so @-@ called <unk> Borghese ) with like @-@ minded army officers determined to stop what they considered as Italy 's drift to the left . Yet another pentito , Rosario Naimo , who started to collaborate with the Italian authorities after his arrest in October 2010 , said that the journalist was killed because of his investigative reporting that damaged the Mafia . 
 The order for the killing of De Mauro came from the heads of the Sicilian Mafia Commission , Stefano Bontade , Gaetano Badalamenti and Salvatore Riina , according to Di Carlo and Buscetta . Both Di Carlo and Naimo say that De Mauro was kidnapped by Emanuele D 'Agostino , a mafioso from Bontade ’ s Santa Maria di Gesù Family . 
 According to Di Carlo , the remains of De Mauro were buried under a bridge over the <unk> river near Palermo . However , the police , after a search , did not find the body . The pentito Francesco Marino <unk> later explained why . He had been ordered by Bontade in 1977 or 1978 to dig up several bodies at the bridge and dissolve them in acid . According to the new testimony of the pentito Naimo , De Mauro was taken to a terrain in Pallavicino neighbourhood in Palermo where the Mafia boss Francesco <unk> owned a chicken farm . He was killed there and dumped in a pit . 
 = = 2006 murder trial = = 
 In 2001 , as a result of the declarations of Di Carlo , the judicial inquiry was reopened . In April 2006 , more than 35 years after De Mauro ’ s disappearance , the trial on his murder started at the Court of Palermo with the former Mafia boss of bosses Riina as the only remaining defendant . ( D 'Agostino and <unk> were killed by Riina ’ s <unk> in the Second Mafia War ; Badalamenti died in a US prison in April 2004 . ) In 2011 the new Mafia turncoat Naimo testified at the trial saying that the journalist was killed by the Mafia on the orders of Riina . 
 The " inconvenient journalist " ( <unk> <unk> ) – as De Mauro had become known – was kidnapped and killed because the Mafia and their backers wanted to know his sources of confidential and potentially devastating information , public prosecutor Antonio Ingroia told the court in his closing speech in March 2011 . " The death sentence on De Mauro was passed because of a convergence of two elements , " Ingroia said . Riina , Bontade and Badalamenti decided to eliminate De Mauro because he was about to go public about Mattei 's 1962 murder as a result of research for Francesco Rosi 's landmark movie , as well as the fact the journalist had uncovered the plans for staging the Mafia @-@ backed far @-@ right Borghese coup d 'état , thanks to his former wartime Fascist connections . 
 " De Mauro was very busy piecing together the elements of the plot , and his death stopped it being uncovered , " according to Ingroia . " The other ' convergent ' element in his death was the fact that he knew , from its inception , about the subversive project involving spies , <unk> and Mafia groups , " to stage the Borghese Coup , " Ingroia said . " From his sources in <unk> circles , from his past in Prince Junio Valerio Borghese 's crack Decima Mas unit , as well as from tip @-@ offs from Mafia boss Emanuele D 'Agostino , he knew something was in the offing " . 
 The " preventive crime " might even have had other motives , such as other events that concerned the " friends in Rome " of the <unk> headed by Riina , as emerged from documents retrieved from the former mayor of Palermo , Vito <unk> . Cosa Nostra was behind the murder of De Mauro , but there were other backgrounds and individuals , allied with the Mafia , such as deviated freemasons and corrupt public officials . " De Mauro was not killed out of revenge , but to prevent harm to the Mafia . The Mafia did not just execute instructions of others , but also because his investigations affected Cosa Nostra itself and other powers associated with it , " according to Ingroia . He said the investigations for the trial had unearthed an " institutional cover @-@ up " in the initial probe into De Mauro 's disappearance . 
 = = Mystery continues = = 
 On June 10 , 2011 , Riina was acquitted of charges for ordering the kidnap and killing of De Mauro by the Court in Palermo because of insufficient evidence . " It 's certainly a surprise , but we 'll see the reasons for this ruling , " said Franca De Mauro , daughter of the journalist . " I am very upset because after 40 years we still have no answer about what happened that day . " In their explanation of the ruling that became public in August 2012 , the judges of the Court of Palermo decided that De Mauro had died because he had gone too far in his quest for the truth about the last hours of Mattei in Sicily . They pointed to Graziano Verzotto as a possible man behind the killing of De Mauro and Mattei , but without a clear conviction . Verzotto had died in June 2010 . 
 The prosecution , which had requested a further life term for Riina , appealed against the acquittal . The appeal trial began in April 2013 . On January 27 , 2014 , the Palermo Appeal Court confirmed the acquittal of Riina . The court considered was convinced of the involvement of Cosa Nostra in De Mauro ’ s murder , but attributed the murder to the group that was headed by Stefano Bontade and identified the likely motive in the discovery by the journalist of important facts about the death of ENI president Enrico Mattei . There was insufficient evidence for the involvement of Riina , due to contradictory evidence , lack of clarity of the evidence gathered and conflicting statements by government witnesses , in particular those of Di Carlo . The prosecution is expected to appeal to the court of last instance , the supreme Court of Cassation . 
 De Mauro ’ s disappearance and likely death remains one of the unsolved mysteries in Italian history . The Sicilian writer Leonardo Sciascia once summarized the puzzle of De Mauro ’ s death : " He said the right thing to the wrong man and the wrong thing to the right man . "

 = Hurricane Floyd ( 1987 ) = 
 Hurricane Floyd was the only hurricane to make landfall in the United States in the 1987 Atlantic hurricane season . The final of seven tropical storms and three hurricanes , Floyd developed on October 9 just off the east coast of Nicaragua . After becoming a tropical storm , it moved northward and crossed western Cuba . An approaching cold front caused Floyd to turn unexpectedly to the northeast , and late on October 12 it attained hurricane status near the Florida Keys . It moved through southern Florida , spawning two tornadoes and leaving minor damage . The hurricane also produced rip tides that killed a person in southern Texas . Floyd maintained hurricane status for only 12 hours before the cold front imparted hostile conditions and caused weakening . It passed through the Bahamas before becoming extratropical and later dissipating on October 14 . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Hurricane Floyd were from a low pressure area in the Gulf of Honduras on October 5 . Over the subsequent few days , it drifted eastward and later southward to a position off the east coast of Nicaragua . On October 9 , a Hurricane Hunters flight confirmed the development of an organized circulation , which indicated that Tropical Depression Thirteen had developed . After continuing a southward drift , the depression turned to the north and later northwest due to a building ridge to its east . With an anticyclone aloft , the depression gradually organized , intensifying into Tropical Storm Floyd on October 10 . 
 After reaching tropical storm status , Floyd accelerated to the north in the western Caribbean Sea , due to an approaching cold front . Steadily intensifying , the storm moved over extreme western Cuba early on October 12 . Initially it was forecast to make landfall between Naples and Fort Myers , Florida . Unexpectedly the storm turned sharply northeastward into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico . Based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters , Floyd briefly attained hurricane status on October 12 . Around the same time , the nearby cold front spawned a low pressure area that cut off the hurricane 's inflow . While moving through the Florida Keys , Floyd became the only hurricane to affect the United States that year . However , its convection was rapidly decreasing over the center due to the front , and shortly thereafter Floyd weakened to tropical storm status . The circulation became nearly impossible to track on satellite imagery , although surface observations indicated it passed just south of Miami , Florida . The storm underwent extratropical transition as it weakened over the Bahamas , and Floyd was no longer a tropical cyclone by late on October 18 . The circulation dissipated within the cold front early the next day . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Around when Floyd first attained tropical storm status , a tropical storm warning was issued for the Swan Islands as well as Grand Cayman . Shortly thereafter , a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for the northeast Yucatán Peninsula before the storm dropped heavy rainfall along the coast . A tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were also issued for Cuba west of Havana . In preparation for the storm , Cuban officials in Pinar del Río Province evacuated 100 @,@ 000 people , as well as 40 @,@ 000 head of cattle . In addition , international flights were canceled for a day during Floyd 's passage . Despite passing over western Cuba as a tropical storm , Floyd left no serious damage or fatalities in the country . 
 When Floyd was a tropical storm located over Cuba , the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for the Florida Keys as well as the southwest Florida coast to Venice . It was the first warning in the state related to the storm , and was issued due to the anticipated intensification to hurricane status as well as short notice . A tropical storm watch , and later warning , was issued for eastern Florida . After the track became more easterly , a hurricane warning was issued for southeastern Florida , as well as the northwestern Bahamas . Officials in southern Florida closed schools due to the storm , and a few flights were canceled at Miami International Airport . Roughly 100 F @-@ 4 and F16 fighter jets were transported out of Homestead Air Force Base to safer facilities . The American Red Cross opened 55 shelters in 10 Florida counties , housing about 2 @,@ 000 people at some point , primarily in Lee County . People in the hurricane 's path prepared by purchasing supplies from supermarkets , gassing up their vehicles , and securing loose outside items . 
 Floyd was the first named storm to strike southern Florida since Hurricane Bob in 1985 . While passing south of Florida , Floyd produced its strongest winds over water away and from land . The strongest wind in the Florida Keys was 59 mph ( 94 km / h ) at Duck Key , although wind gusts were stronger . The Air Force station on Cudjoe Key reported an unofficial gust of 92 mph ( 152 km / h ) . Rainfall directly from Floyd 's rainbands produced minimal rainfall less than 1 in ( 25 mm ) . However , the interaction between the hurricane and the approaching cold front produced much heavier rainfall . Precipitation reached as far north as Daytona , peaking at 10 @.@ 07 in ( 256 mm ) in Fort Pierce . While bypassing the Florida Keys , Floyd spawned a waterspout that moved ashore in Rock Harbor . It damaged a few boats and homes . The hurricane produced rip tides as far west as the Texas coast , killing one person along South Padre Island . 
 Across southern Florida , the hurricane left minor damage of around $ 500 @,@ 000 ( 1987 USD ) , largely due to downed trees and power lines , as well as minor crop damage in Dade County . The rainfall flooded roads in southern Florida , which caused several vehicles to fail on the Florida Turnpike . After affecting Florida , Floyd caused minor wind damage in the Bahamas . In the country , the highest reported gust was 48 mph ( 77 km / h ) at Freeport , Grand Bahama . Freeport International Airport reported sustained winds of 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) from the remnants of Floyd .

 In 2001 , Brandon Flowers was fired by his first band , a Las Vegas synthpop trio known as Blush Response who subsequently relocated to Los Angeles . After attending an Oasis concert at the Hard Rock Hotel during The Tour of Brotherly Love , Flowers realized his calling was to be in a rock band and began searching for like @-@ minded musicians . He eventually came across an ad posted in a Las Vegas newspaper by Dave Keuning , a 25 @-@ year @-@ old guitarist who had moved to Vegas from Iowa a year earlier . The pair shared similar musical influences and soon began writing songs together in Keuning 's apartment . By the end of 2001 , they had recorded a demo at Kill The Messenger Studio in Henderson , Nevada ; the demo featured four tracks , " Desperate " , " Replaceable " and early versions of " Mr. Brightside " and " Under the Gun " . 
 Keuning and Flowers played their first live show together at an open mic night at the Cafe Espresso Roma in Las Vegas in January 2002 ; the pair , joined by Neal and Norcross , began playing venues around the city where they would also hand out free copies of their demo . The Killers brought a unique style to the small Vegas music scene which was predominately filled with punk , nu metal , and rap bands ; one local reviewer stated , " The Killers , thankfully , don 't come across like any other band in town " and described their sound as a mix between the " pop styles of British music and the lo @-@ fi fuzz of modern indie rock . " 
 Ronnie Vannucci Jr joined the Killers shortly before Neal 's departure , Vannucci was well known on the Las Vegas music scene , having played in numerous bands since a young age . It was while he was drumming for a band called Romance Fantasy in 2002 that he and the Killers developed a mutual appreciation for each other . Ronnie 's first show with the band was on August 30 , 2002 at a club called The Junkyard , playing bass for the Killers that night was Mark Stoermer who was at this point the lead guitarist for local progressive rock band The Negative Ponies , the band were keen on Stoermer joining them on a permanent basis with full commitment but he was reluctant to leave The Negative Ponies . The band continued as a three piece trying out other bassists until November 2002 when Stoermer agreed to join and the band 's current line up was complete . 
 The four of them would get together in Vannucci 's garage to work on song ideas . They would also sneak into the band room at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas ( where Vannucci was studying Classical percussion ) at night to practice . It was during this period that the band wrote much of their debut album Hot Fuss including hit singles " Somebody Told Me " and " Smile Like You Mean It " . The band continued playing at small venues around their hometown , often playing Sunday nights at a transvestite bar named Sasha 's ( later renamed Tramps ) . It wasn 't long before they caught the attention of Braden Merrick , an A & R rep for Warner Bros. Records who had come across their demo on a website dedicated to unsigned bands in the Las Vegas area ; after attending a live show he offered to help the band find a record deal and eventually became their manager . He took the band to the San Francisco area , to Berkeley , California , to record demos with former Green Day manager Jeff Saltzman , they then sent the demo tapes out to major record labels in the US . The band was invited to perform at a number of showcases but were ultimately not signed , the band however did catch the eye of Alex Gilbert , who was an A & R rep from the United Kingdom . Gilbert took a demo with him back to the UK and showed it to his friend Ben Durling , who worked at the newly formed Independent label Lizard King Records in London . Despite not yet meeting the band in person , Lizard King were quick to offer the band a deal based on the strength of the five song demo . The Killers signed with the British label in July 2003 .

They eventually signed with the record company Island Def Jam . 
 The band finished recording Hot Fuss in November 2003 with Jeff Saltzman , they decided to keep many of the previously recorded demos as they felt they had a spontaneity that re @-@ recordings would not have .

 " Human " was released in October 2008 with Brandon Flowers describing the song as " Johnny Cash meets the Pet Shop Boys " . The song went on to become a huge hit worldwide , the lyric " Are we human , or are we dancer ? " created much confusion and debate due to its grammar and ambiguity , with some believing the lyric was " dancers " or " denser " rather than " dancer " , Flowers explained that the line was inspired by a Hunter S. Thompson quote where he stated America was raising " a generation of dancers " . It has since been voted by one poll as the most confusing song lyric of all time . 
 The Killers ' third album , Day & Age , was released on November 25 , 2008 . Brandon Flowers stated that " Day & Age " was " like looking at Sam 's Town from Mars " , the band have called it their " most playful record " with the album making use of saxophones , steel drums , harpsichord & tribal chanting . The album also saw the band write some of their most personal and challenging lyrics to date , closing track " Goodnight , Travel Well " was written about the death of guitarist Dave Keuning 's mother . While " A Dustland Fairytale " was written as a tribute to frontman Brandon Flowers ' parents , his mother had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer . Day & Age became the band 's third studio album to reach number one in both the UK and Ireland , it reached number six on the Billboard 200 album chart . It has also been certified 4x Platinum in the UK and Ireland , Platinum in Germany , Australia , New Zealand and Canada and Gold in the US , Mexico , Sweden , Norway , Austria , Switzerland , Greece and the Middle East . 
 The band embarked on the Day & Age World Tour , during which they performed on every continent except Antarctica and headlined US festivals Lollapalooza and Coachella for the first time . The tour was named one of the top fifty worldwide concert tours of 2009 . On July 5 – 6 , 2009 at the Royal Albert Hall , London the Killers recorded their first live DVD , " Live from the Royal Albert Hall " . It was released in November and played at various cinemas across the globe . Live from Royal Albert Hall was certified 2x Platinum in the UK , Platinum in the US and Australia and Gold in Ireland and Brazil . 
 In January 2010 , the band announced that they would take a short break after being on the road for the better part of six years . The break lasted for about a year @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half , during which band members devoted themselves on solo projects , while the band made sporadic other contributions . 
 In late February 2010 , Flowers ' mother died after a two @-@ year fight with brain cancer . This resulted in the cancellation of dates in Asia . Two Australian dates in Sydney and Perth were also cancelled ; however , both the Gold Coast and Melbourne concerts went ahead , with the Day & Age tour finally coming to a close in Melbourne on February 21 as the headline act at the Good Vibrations Festival at Flemington Racecourse . 
 Invited by U.S. President Barack Obama , the band played on the White House South Lawn on July 4 , 2010 for the second annual " Salute To The Military " United Service Organizations concert as part of Independence Day celebrations , which Flowers described as a " monumental honor " . Despite their hiatus , the band got together to play " Human " , " Somebody Told Me " , " Mr. Brightside " , " A Dustland Fairytale " , " God Bless America / Read My Mind " and " When You Were Young " .

 = Simon Byrne = 
 Simon Byrne ( 1806 – 2 June 1833 ) , nicknamed " The Emerald Gem " , was an Irish bare @-@ knuckle prize fighter . The heavyweight boxing champion of Ireland , he was drawn to England by the larger sums of prize money on offer and his hopes of becoming the heavyweight champion there as well . He became one of only six fighters ever to have been involved in fatal fights as both survivor and deceased since records began in 1741 . 
 Byrne fought in an era when English boxing , although illegal , was patronised by many powerful individuals . Its patronage and popularity did not , however , free it from corruption , heavy betting , and staged fights . Byrne fought eight recorded matches , but accounts of his career focus on the last three , against the Scottish champion Alexander McKay , the English champion Jem Ward , and James Burke for the vacant championship of England . The injuries McKay received in his fight with Byrne resulted in his death the following day , and rioting in his home country of Scotland . Byrne went on to lose his next match against Jem Ward , which some commentators believed he was not sufficiently in condition to fight . His final contest in May 1833 was a gruelling 99 rounds against James Burke that lasted for 3 hours and 6 minutes , the longest ever recorded prize fight . Byrne died three days later as the result of damage to his brain caused by the beating he had received . Burke was arrested and tried for manslaughter but was acquitted . Following the death in 1838 of another fighter , William Phelps , also known as Brighton Bill , the London Prize Ring Rules were introduced to more clearly define the rules of prize fighting and to introduce certain safety measures , rules that still form the basis for the modern sport of boxing . 
 = = Early 19th @-@ century English boxing = = 
 During the first half of the 19th century pugilism , better known as prize @-@ fighting , held a curious position in British society . Although supported by members of the establishment from the royal princes downwards , it was considered illegal under the terms of the Riot Act of 1715 , which defined a riot as " a tumultuous disturbance of the peace by three or more persons assembling together , of their own authority , with intent mutually to execute a violent enterprise to the terror of the people " . 
 The boxer George Stevenson had died a few days after his 35 @-@ minute fight with the English champion Jack Broughton in 1741 , an event that triggered Broughton to draw up a set of rules with the help of some of his patrons to prevent a recurrence . Published on 16 August 1743 , Broughton 's Rules outlawed hitting or seizing any part of an opponent 's body below the waist , or striking him when he was down , but otherwise left much to the discretion of referees . Rounds were not of a fixed length but continued until one of the fighters was knocked or thrown to the ground , after which those in his corner were allowed 30 seconds to return him to the " scratch " – the middle of the ring – failing which his opponent was declared the victor . 
 The sport enjoyed an unprecedented surge in popularity during the Regency period when it was openly patronised by the Prince Regent ( later George IV ) and his brothers . Championship boxing matches acquired a louche reputation as the places to be seen by the wealthy upper classes . Thus a match would often be attended by thousands of people , many of whom had wagered money on the outcome . The Duke of Cumberland ( an uncle of King George III ) was reported to have bet thousands of pounds on Jack Broughton , who was the English champion for 18 years . 
 Boxing had become a nest of " gambling related corruption " by the 1820s . The epitome of this era was the championship reign of Jem Ward , a fighter who on one occasion admitted taking £ 100 , equivalent to several thousand pounds today , to lose a contest . By 1830 the sport had become widely known for its corruption , and blatant cheating was commonplace . It was against this background that Simon Byrne earned his living . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Very little is known of Byrne 's early life beyond the fact that he was born in Ireland in 1806 . His first fight , in 1825 , was a loss to Mike Larking ; it lasted 138 rounds spread over two and a half hours — despite the fact that at this time a round could vary in length , and usually only ended when a man was knocked down . His second fight was a draw against Jack Manning in 1826 , earning Byrne £ 100 . Next was Byrne 's first match against the Scottish boxer Alexander McKay , which Byrne won easily in five rounds , earning him a further £ 100 . This match was McKay 's first ever prize @-@ fight . This victory was soon followed by a win against Bob Avery , earning a further £ 50 , then another win over Phil Samson in 1829 , earning him £ 200 . By the standards of the day these latter sums were enormous ; it is therefore surprising that he was then offered £ 200 for a rematch , regardless of whether he won or not , against the less experienced McKay , whom he had beaten so easily on the first occasion . As of 2008 that would be the equivalent of about £ 13 @,@ 600 . 
 = = Byrne versus McKay = = 
 The fight against Alexander McKay was Byrne 's first brush with notoriety . On 2 June 1830 , Byrne , billed as " Champion of Ireland " , fought McKay , the " Champion of Scotland " , for the right to challenge Jem Ward , the heavyweight champion of England . The match had been organized at Tom Spring 's " Castle Tavern " , in Holborn . The former champion boxer Tom Spring , as treasurer of the " Fair Play Club " – the organization which oversaw boxing – was immensely influential in the boxing world . Along with two other well @-@ known boxers , Gentleman Jackson and Tom Cribb ( who also acted as Byrne 's manager ) , he was Byrne 's sponsor for the match . Cribb was considered to be one of the greatest fighters of the era ; more than 20 @,@ 000 people attended one of his fights . 
 Contracts were signed at Spring 's tavern and it was arranged for the fight to take place at Hanslope , Buckinghamshire . But as a vast crowd of spectators began pouring into Hanslope the venue was switched at the last minute to <unk> Green , just inside Northamptonshire , thus rendering the Buckinghamshire constables powerless to prevent it . 
 Despite the publicity and billing this was only McKay 's fifth prize @-@ fight . Since his defeat at the hands of Byrne two @-@ and @-@ half years earlier McKay had fought and won just three matches , earning him £ 180 , while Byrne had earned £ 200 . Both men were promised £ 200 for the match whatever its outcome . McKay had earned £ 100 for his previous fight against Paul Spencer , the most he had ever received ; the promised payment was a huge improvement in his fortunes . 
 McKay 's boxing relied on brute strength rather than scientific pugilistic theory , but the fight still lasted for 47 rounds before McKay collapsed under a left @-@ handed punch to the throat that did not seem particularly powerful . He was carried to his corner where he regained consciousness , complaining of severe headache . He was bled by a surgeon on the scene and taken to a local inn , the Watts Arms , where he died at 9 : 00 pm the following evening . A post mortem examination found the cause of death to be brain damage . McKay was buried in Hanslope Churchyard with the following inscription on his headstone : 
 Strong and athletic was my frame 
 Far from my native home I came 
 And bravely fought with Simon Byrne 
 Alas , but never to return . 
 Stranger take warning from my fate 
 Lest you should rue your case too late 
 If you have ever fought before 
 Determine now to fight no more 
 McKay 's death attracted widespread publicity and led to rioting in the streets of his homeland . In Dundee , three people died and 200 were injured in the fracas . In Glasgow , four people died , and the Dragoons were called out to quell rioting after a Roman Catholic church was burned and looted ( the mob would have assumed Byrne , an Irishman , to be a Roman Catholic ) . Byrne was arrested three days later on board the ferry to Ireland as he tried to leave the country . He was incarcerated in Buckingham Gaol to await his trial and the prospect of the gallows . 
 = = Trial = = 
 The trial was held at the Assizes in the small rural market town of Buckingham . More used to the trials of local poachers and sheep thieves , Buckingham had never before seen such a spectacle . The town was inundated with journalists and the merely curious . Byrne was charged with manslaughter . Tom Cribb , Reuben Martin , Thomas Reynolds , and George Cooper were charged with aiding and abetting manslaughter . With such illustrious names as Cribb 's , Jackson 's and Spring 's involved , the trial had the potential to turn into a huge establishment scandal . People of all classes had bet hundreds of pounds on the outcome of the boxing match . Despite being banned , prize fighting enjoyed huge public support and patronage from levels up to the younger male members of the Royal family , some of whom Jackson had taught to box . The support received by Byrne at his trial is testimony to the wealth of his backers . The establishment rallied to his support ; Byrne was represented by three barristers and five solicitors , and twelve witnesses journeyed from London to give evidence on his behalf . 
 The defence produced a witness who claimed to have seen McKay fall and strike his head on some stones several hours before the fight , and the Glasgow Free Press began a rumour that McKay had been drugged by " a sleeping draught " introduced into his water bottle . That the fight was illegal , as was the public assembly of spectators does not seem to have been considered in court . This benign neglect is surprising because as recently as 1825 , in the case of Rex v. Billingham , Savage and Skinner , it had been deemed that anyone even attending a fight was guilty of an offence . 
 At the trial Byrne was described by a Bow Street Runner as a " very human kind man " , and McKay as " a very large muscular man – a magnificent man " . The jury came to a verdict after only ten minutes of deliberation : " Not guilty " . Byrne was once again a free man , but the image of the sport had been damaged . The Times of 5 June 1830 condemned the " barbarous , filthy and swindling exhibitions called prize fights " and expressed the hope that " an example will be made of the more wealthy monsters in this affair of blood – the sanguinary cowards who stood by and saw a fellow creature beaten to death for their sport and gain ! " 
 As the " wealthy monsters " patronising boxing included King George IV ( who had asked Gentleman Jackson and the country 's leading pugilists to act as pages at his coronation in 1821 ) and his heir , the Duke of Clarence , The Times 's words fell on deaf ears , and the sport continued unabated . The following year a similar legal case occurred when another boxer was killed . However , in this instance less wealthy patrons and illustrious names were involved , and the manager of the convicted boxer , unlike Tom Cribb , was found guilty of abetting manslaughter and sentenced to 14 years transportation . 
 = = Byrne versus Ward = = 
 Cleared of any responsibility for McKay 's death , Byrne collected his £ 200 prize money , and as the winner earned the right to fight the English heavyweight champion Jem Ward . The fight was originally scheduled to take place at Leicester on 10 March 1829 , but at the last minute Ward claimed that he was unfit and too ill to fight , much to the disapproval of his backers and friends . Rumours circulated that Ward had refused to enter the ring unless he received a prize money of £ 250 plus an additional £ 250 if he lost ; the event became known in some quarters as the Leicester Hoax . Ward did not fight again for two years , but he and Byrne finally met on 12 July 1831 at <unk> , near Stratford upon Avon . Each fighter was paid £ 200 . Although Ward was the older man he prevailed in the contest after one hour and seventeen minutes , when Byrne 's seconds , Tom Spring and Tom Reynolds , withdrew their man in the 33rd round . 
 An observer commented that Byrne may not have been in the best of condition for the fight , as " his appearance failed to favour the impression that he possessed active vigour " ; boxing historian Gilbert Odd describes the fight as " disgraceful " . Another commentator noted that " it is a singular fact that neither of the men had a black eye ; neither had an external cut worth mentioning " . 
 = = Byrne versus Burke = = 
 Jem Ward announced his retirement from the ring in a letter published in the 29 January edition of Bell 's Life in London . He was succeeded as champion of England by James Burke , although some disputed Burke 's right to the title as Ward had refused to fight him before retiring . Standing 6 feet 2 inches ( 1 @.@ 88 m ) tall , weighing 200 lb ( 90 kg ) , and handicapped by deafness , Burke had assumed the championship after defeating Harry <unk> in one of the prolonged and brutal fights for which he was known . Ward , who had faced public criticism for his refusal to fight Burke , felt that Byrne was the better fighter and promised to acknowledge the victor of a fight between Burke and Byrne as the new champion . The match took place on 30 May 1833 on <unk> , a tract of common land between the villages of Sandridge and Wheathampstead in Hertfordshire , for a prize of £ 100 to each man . To get himself into condition for the fight Byrne had reduced his weight from 210 pounds ( 95 kg ) to 186 pounds ( 84 kg ) , an effort that " as it was effected by hard work and sweating , somewhat impaired his natural stamina , especially as , his habits being far from abstemious when in Ireland , he was scarcely fitted to undergo the necessary amount of labour " . Despite his hard work Byrne looked " fleshy " , with " no special show of muscle " , compared to Burke 's " perfect condition " , although he did have a slight height advantage . Burke weighed in at 172 pounds ( 78 kg ) , and started the contest as the marginal favourite at odds of 5 – 4 . 
 Tom Spring was once again in Byrne 's corner , as was Jem Ward . In true Burke style the match lasted for 3 hours and 6 minutes , during which time 99 rounds were fought the longest ever recorded prize fight . For the most part Byrne seemed to be in control in the early stages of the fight ; in the 30th round he trapped Burke against the ropes and battered him severely around the body before throwing him to the ground . Burke fell on his face , vomiting and throwing up blood , and for the next few rounds Byrne looked the more likely winner . By the 49th round however , Burke had recovered sufficiently to knock Byrne to the ground , whose hands by then were so swollen that he was unable to deliver a finishing blow . By the 93rd round Byrne was " scarcely able to stand , and rolled before the Deaf 'un like a ship in a storm " . Although both men were utterly exhausted Burke continued to " pepper away at [ Byrne 's ] body and head " , until in the 99th round Byrne collapsed unconscious and could not be revived to take his place once again at the scratch . A contemporary newspaper report of the day describes a blow @-@ by @-@ blow account of a fair match . 
 Byrne was carried to " The <unk> " inn in nearby St Albans , where he was attended to by Tom Spring . On the evening of the fight Byrne was considered to be close to death , but over the course of the following two days he seemed to be recovering , and was sufficiently conscious to thank his friends for their ministrations . But his condition worsened during the afternoon of Saturday 1 June 1833 , and he died the following day ; the cause of death was given as " congestion of blood in the brain " . Byrne himself was reportedly of a different opinion , telling a chambermaid shortly before his death that " If I should die , it will not be from the beating I received but from mortification . I would rather have died than been beaten in that fight . " He left behind a wife and four children in Dublin . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 One contemporary view of Byrne 's fatal fight , and of his earlier contest against Ward , was expressed in a popular poem written by James Catnach , the <unk> publisher of Seven Dials , London : 
 On Thursday , 30 May day , Brave Simon took the ring , 
 Back 'd by Jem Ward the champion , likewise by Gallant Spring , 
 To fight Burke for two hundred pounds , a man of courage bold , 
 To stop reports that with Ward the battle he had sold . 
 Burke was arrested and tried for manslaughter . He was acquitted on 11 July 1833 , but avoided competitive fights for some time afterwards , only taking part in exhibition matches . He retired in 1843 and died of tuberculosis less than two years later in 1845 , having by then been reduced to poverty . 
 Following the death in 1838 of another fighter , William Phelps , also known as Brighton Bill , in a match against Owen Swift , the London Prize Ring Rules were introduced by the <unk> 's Protective Association to more clearly define the range of fouls and to introduce certain safety measures . <unk> , gouging , biting , scratching , kicking were all forbidden as was the use of stones or any hard object in the hand . Thirty @-@ second breaks were introduced between rounds , at the end of which each fighter had to walk to the scratch unaided within 8 seconds . The wearing of spiked boots was prohibited , and boxers who went to ground without being hit were disqualified . These rules still form the basis for the modern sport of boxing .

The club was founded in 1881 and competes in the Lowland Football League , in the fifth tier of the Scottish football league system . The club 's origins can be traced to 1880 when a local cricket club formed a football team under the name Britannia , based in the village of Bainsford . 
 The club was elected to the Scottish Football League in 1900 – 01 and has competed in the league system for most of its existence . East Stirlingshire has won the second tier of Scottish football once and finished runners @-@ up once , earning promotion to the top @-@ flight on both occasions . The club 's highest league ranking came during the two solitary seasons it competed in the top flight in 1932 – 33 and 1963 – 64 . In 2016 , East Stirlingshire became the first club ever to be relegated out of the national league system . 
 East Stirlingshire first entered in the Scottish Cup in 1882 , its best result reaching the quarter @-@ finals on three occasions , the last in 1981 . The club 's best result in a national cup competition was in the 2000 – 01 season when it reached the semi @-@ finals of the Scottish Challenge Cup , losing to Livingston for a place in the final . In 2008 , the club left Firs Park and moved to Ochilview Park to ground @-@ share with local rivals Stenhousemuir . 
 = = History = = 
 East Stirlingshire 's official date of formation was in 1881 , but its origins can be traced to the previous year when a local cricket club called Bainsford <unk> formed a football team under the name Britannia . The team 's first recorded match was a friendly against Falkirk 's second eleven in December 1880 and resulted in a 7 – 0 defeat while its first match as East Stirlingshire was against the same opponent in August 1881 . The club 's nickname is " The Shire " , which refers to the Stirlingshire part of the club name . After joining the Scottish Football Association , the club became eligible to compete in the Scottish Cup , Scotland 's main association football knock @-@ out competition , eliminated in its first game in 1882 . In December 1883 , the Stirlingshire Football Association was founded , with membership open to clubs exclusively from the county of Stirlingshire . It resulted in the establishment of a new regional tournament called the Stirlingshire Cup , with the club reaching the final in its first season . East Stirlingshire dominated the tournament in its early years , winning it for a record four years in a row between 1885 and 1889 , including an emphatic 9 – 0 victory against Falkirk in the 1888 final . Two goals came from Lawrence McLachlan who was an influential goalscorer in the club 's early successes ; scoring more times than any other East Stirlingshire player with 135 known goals . 
 The latter years of the 19th century was East Stirlingshire 's most successful era in the Scottish Cup . In the 1888 – 89 and 1890 – 91 tournaments , the club reached the quarter @-@ finals in what was to be the last time for 91 years , losing to Celtic and Hearts respectively . In the 1888 – 89 tournament , the club recorded its highest win and equalled it in successive rounds with a 10 – 1 victory against local rivals Stenhousemuir in the first round and an 11 – 2 win over Vale of Bannock in the second round . It was during this period that four East Stirlingshire players earned international caps for their countries . The first was the Wales national team captain , Humphrey Jones , who earned five caps whilst with the club . Three other players , David Alexander , Archibald Ritchie , and James McKie made appearances for the Scotland national team from 1891 to 1898 . 
 Between 1891 and 1899 , the club competed in regional leagues , including winning the Midland Football League and Central Football Combination , before being elected to the second tier of Scotland 's main national league competition – the Scottish Football League – in 1900 – 01 , ending its first season ranked 7th from ten . In March 1905 , a proposal was raised for the club to merge with neighbours Falkirk with an aim to creating a bigger and more financially stable club , which Falkirk accepted in a vote . However , East Stirlingshire 's vote was not in favour and the club rejected the proposal . The years following included finishing bottom of the league in 1905 – 06 , recording only one win from 22 games , contrasting with finishing as high as third in table in 1912 – 13 , narrowly missing out on winning the championship by two points . The club remained in Division Two until 1914 – 15 when it , and the Scottish Cup , were both suspended due to World War I. 
 At the end of World War I , the club was re @-@ elected to the old Division Two which was re @-@ established in the 1921 – 22 season . The year beforehand saw the club move to Firs Park after leaving their old ground of Merchiston Park in 1920 . In the same year , a record home attendance of 12 @,@ 000 was set when the club played eventual champions , Partick Thistle , in the Scottish Cup in February 1921 . The club was relegated to the newly created , but short lived , Division Three in 1922 – 23 , earning promotion back to Division Two after one season ; setting a record of 23 home games without a loss . A decade later , East Stirlingshire won promotion to Division One , Scotland 's top flight , for the first time . En route to promotion , the club spent 32 weeks at the top of Division Two , ending the season equal on 55 points with St Johnstone , with East Stirlingshire winning the championship on a superior goal average . East Stirlingshire spent one season in its first spell in the top flight , ending the year bottom of the league in 20th with seventeen points . Back in Division Two in the 1935 – 36 season , the club 's heaviest league defeat of 12 – 1 was inflicted by Dundee United in April 1936 . In 1938 – 39 , the final season before the league was suspended due to World War II , East Stirlingshire finished second @-@ bottom of the league , ahead of only Edinburgh City , but despite finishing low , Malcolm Morrison became the club 's highest league goalscorer in a single season with 36 goals . 
 The club was excluded from a wartime league in 1939 and was also denied re @-@ entry to the Scottish Football League Division Two at the end of World War II , along with six other small league clubs . As a result , the clubs competed in a newly created Division C along with the reserve teams of some of Scotland 's top clubs . In the second season in Division C , East Stirlingshire won the league and was promoted back to Division Two , now renamed " Division B " , but finished last after one season in 1948 – 49 , and failed re @-@ election to compete for another year . At the same time , Division C was abolished and the club was forced leave the Scottish Football League to play in regional leagues for six years before rejoining Division Two in 1955 – 56 when the number of teams was expanded . The club sold many young players to larger clubs , including defender Eddie McCreadie to Chelsea in 1962 who earned 23 international caps for Scotland and is tenth in Chelsea 's all @-@ time appearance list with 410 . The money earned from the transfer helped attract new players and in the 1962 – 63 season , the club won promotion to the top flight for a second time , as runners @-@ up in Division Two behind St Johnstone . Like the previous occasion in 1932 – 33 , East Stirlingshire spent one solitary season in the top tier before being relegated . 
 After relegation from Scotland 's top flight , East Stirlingshire was controversially merged with Clydebank Juniors in 1964 . The new club was renamed East Stirlingshire Clydebank – often E.S. Clydebank for short – and relocated to Kilbowie Park in Clydebank against fans ' wishes . However , the merge lasted only one season , with East Stirlingshire shareholders winning several court cases against it and thus the club reverted to its original legal status and moved back to Falkirk . During the single season as E.S. Clydebank , the club set a record attendance at Kilbowie Park when 14 @,@ 900 spectators attended a Scottish Cup first round replay against Hibernian in February 1965 . 
 In 1966 , Lawrence Binnie became the club 's first official manager , prior to his appointment the board of directors took responsibility for management roles . After de @-@ merging with Clydebank Juniors , the club spent ten seasons in Division Two before being moved by league reconstruction to a new Second Division for the 1975 – 76 season , now the third tier with the creation of the Premier Division at the top of the Scottish Football League . During this period , the club progressed past the group stage of Scottish League Cup for the first time since it was inaugurated in 1947 . The year beforehand saw the club appoint its most famous manager , Alex Ferguson , who was at the club during 1974 before moving to St Mirren . In 1979 – 80 , East Stirlingshire won promotion to the First Division , which is the last time the club was promoted in the league . Managed by Billy Lamont , the club finished runners @-@ up by one point to rivals Falkirk in the Second Division . The clubs shared the top two spots in the league for most of the season and entered the final match equal on points , with East Stirlingshire required to better Falkirk 's result to win the championship due to an inferior goal difference . However , Falkirk won its match and East Stirlingshire drew and so finished second . 
 In the 1994 – 95 season , the Scottish Football League was again restructured and East Stirlingshire was moved to a new Third Division , now the fourth @-@ tier . The club finished its first season in the Third Division ranked fourth from ten and repeated it again in 1997 – 98 . With these exceptions East Stirlingshire generally finished below mid @-@ table , including a final day victory against Arbroath in the 1996 – 97 season to avoid finishing last . In 2000 – 01 , the club reached the semi @-@ final of a national cup competition for the first time in its history , losing 2 – 1 to Livingston for a place in the final of the Scottish Challenge Cup . 
 At the start of the 21st century the club struggled financially , paying players £ 10 @-@ a @-@ week and manager Dennis Newall became the first unpaid manager at senior level in Scottish football . As a result , the club ranked last in the Scottish Football League for five consecutive seasons from 2002 – 03 to 2006 – 07 , losing 24 consecutive league games in the 2003 – 04 season , recording only 8 points from two wins and two draws in 36 games . From the 2005 – 06 season , it was determined if a club finished bottom of the Third Division twice in successive years , it would face the risk of being reduced to associate member status , meaning the loss of voting rights . In East Stirlingshire 's case , a league vote was held and concluded in favour of the club retaining full member status with the condition that it did not finish last the following season in 2008 . The club won its final game of the season to move off the bottom of the table in a 3 – 1 win against Montrose , which was also the last game at Firs Park . The following season , retaining full member status , the club moved to Ochilview Park in a ground @-@ share agreement with neighbours Stenhousemuir . 
 Under manager Jim McInally , the club finished third in successive years to qualify for the promotion play @-@ offs to the Second Division . However , a second @-@ bottom place finish in the 2010 – 11 season saw McInally sacked and replaced by John Coughlin . The club would subsequently post another two bottom @-@ place finishes in the seasons to follow , which could have again put them in danger of reduction to associate member status , but due to ongoing negotiations about league restructuring for the 2013 – 14 season , the league opted not to enforce the rule . The negotiations ultimately saw the formation of a new governing body , the Scottish Professional Football League , following the merger of the Scottish Football League and Scottish Premier League . East Stirlingshire joined the Scottish League Two , the successor to the old Third Division . Having finished bottom of 2015 – 16 Scottish League Two , East Stirlingshire faced a play @-@ off against Edinburgh City for a place in 2016 – 17 Scottish League Two . Edinburgh City won 2 – 1 on aggregate , relegating East Stirlingshire to the Lowland League and ending their 61 @-@ year tenure in the Scottish national league set @-@ up . 
 = = Colours and crest = = 
 East Stirlingshire 's home colours have been black and white hoops for most of its existence since 1882 . The club 's first strip was thin blue and white hoops between 1880 and 1882 , before changing to colours similar to the present day . An all @-@ black shirt was introduced between 1960 and 1962 , and again between 2008 and 2010 , while the club 's centenary strip in 1981 was all @-@ white . In 1996 – 97 , the stripes were changed from horizontal to vertical for a full season ; a similar design featured for one month in August 1982 before changing back . 
 The first company to supply kits for East Stirlingshire was Bukta between 1979 and 1987 . For the 1998 – 99 season , the club signed a deal with French kit supplier Le Coq Sportif who failed to deliver the kits in time for the start of the season so sent a set of Queen 's Park strips with East Stirlingshire 's crest and sponsors ironed on top of the original . The supplier for the 2012 – 13 season is <unk> . Past suppliers include Hummel , Umbro and Joma . 
 The club crest is a shield with black and white stripes and a stylised football , with a banner displaying the club name at the top . It has several variations with the football and banner coloured black , white or orange in different versions .

 East Stirlingshire has played at several grounds over its history . In the club 's early existence as Britannia , it played one of its first known matches at <unk> against a Falkirk 2nd XI , which ended in a 7 – 0 defeat for the team . <unk> is thought to be the location that was to become Merchiston Park , where the club played many of its matches in the late 19th century . Some home matches were also played at <unk> Park in the town . 
 Merchiston Park was a football ground located in the village of Bainsford , approximately 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north of Falkirk . It was situated on the northern bank of the Forth and Clyde Canal near to present day Main Street in Bainsford . The ground hosted East Stirlingshire 's first Scottish Football League match in 1900 – 01 which ended in a 3 – 2 defeat to Airdrieonians . Merchiston Park remained the club 's home until 1921 when a nearby iron works acquired the ground for expansion and the club moved to Firs Park . 
 Firs Park was located to the south of the canal in the centre of Falkirk , named after the street in which it was situated , Firs Street . The club moved to the ground in 1921 and in the same year , the club 's record attendance was set at a Scottish Cup match against Partick Thistle when 12 @,@ 000 spectators attended . Firs Park was East Stirlingshire 's home for 87 years , except a solitary season in 1964 when the club played at Kilbowie Park in Clydebank after being controversially merged with Clydebank Juniors . As a result of the merger , Firs Park was closed , however , after only one season , the merger was disbanded and East Stirlingshire moved back to the ground , where it remained until the end of the 2007 – 08 season . The decision was taken by the club to close Firs Park due to the prohibitive costs of potential refurbishing to meet new Scottish Football Association stadium criteria . At the time of closure , the ground had a capacity of 1 @,@ 800 with 200 seated in the main stand . 
 East Stirlingshire plays its home matches at Ochilview Park which is the home ground of local rivals Stenhousemuir . After leaving Firs Park in 2008 , the club entered a ground @-@ share agreement with Stenhousemuir , originally intended to be for a period of five years during which the club planned to develop a new stadium in Falkirk . In May 2014 East <unk> FC entered into a partnership with LK Galaxy Sports and others to develop a new playing facility at the former BP Club site at Little <unk> , Grange Road , Grangemouth . The site will also host other sports in due course . Planning has recently been approved by Falkirk Council . 
 = = Rivalries = = 
 East Stirlingshire 's traditional rival is Falkirk . The club 's first match known as both Britannia and East Stirlingshire were friendly games against Falkirk in 1880 and 1881 . Both clubs are based in Falkirk and have competed against each other in competitions such as Stirlingshire Cup since the late 19th century . East Stirlingshire was elected to the bottom tier of the Scottish Football League in 1900 , closely followed by Falkirk two seasons later in 1902 – 03 . The first competitive league meeting between the clubs ended in a 2 – 0 win for Falkirk at Merchiston Park in August 1902 . The two clubs ' old grounds of Firs Park and Brockville Park were geographically close , separated by less than half a mile ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) . 
 On a regional scale , East Stirlingshire has rivalries with football clubs from the historical county of Stirlingshire , who have competed in the Stirlingshire Cup against each other since the early 1880s such as Stenhousemuir and since 1945 , Stirling Albion and Alloa Athletic . East Stirlingshire plays its home matches in a ground @-@ share agreement with rivals Stenhousemuir at their Ochilview Park home .

 Manchester ( local / <unk> / ) is a major city and metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester , England , with a population of 514 @,@ 417 as of 2013 . It lies within the United Kingdom 's second @-@ most populous urban area , with a population of 2 @.@ 55 million . Manchester is fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south , the Pennines to the north and east and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation . The local authority is Manchester City Council . 
 The recorded history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort of Mamucium or Mancunium , which was established in about 79 AD on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell . It was historically a part of Lancashire , although areas of Cheshire south of the River Mersey were incorporated during the 20th century . Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township but began to expand " at an astonishing rate " around the turn of the 19th century . Manchester 's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution , and resulted in it becoming the world 's first industrialised city . 
 Manchester achieved city status in 1853 . The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894 , creating the Port of Manchester and linking the city to sea , 36 miles ( 58 km ) to the west . Its fortunes declined after the Second World War , owing to deindustrialisation . The city centre was devastated in a bombing in 1996 , but it led to extensive investment and regeneration that has since helped it turn into a thriving ' reborn ' modern city . 
 In 2014 , the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked Manchester as a beta world city , the highest @-@ ranked British city apart from London . Manchester is the third @-@ most visited city in the UK . It is notable for its architecture , culture , musical exports , media links , scientific and engineering output , social impact , sports clubs and transport connections . Manchester Liverpool Road railway station was the world 's first inter @-@ city passenger railway station and in the city scientists first split the atom and developed the stored @-@ program computer . 
 = = Name = = 
 The name Manchester originates from the Latin name Mamucium or its variant Mancunium and the citizens are still referred to as Mancunians ( / <unk> / ) . These are generally thought to represent a Latinisation of an original Brittonic name , either from <unk> ( " breast " , in reference to a " breast @-@ like hill " ) or from mamma ( " mother " , in reference to a local river goddess ) . Both meanings are preserved in languages derived from Common Brittonic , mam meaning " breast " in Irish and " mother " in Welsh . The suffix <unk> is a survival of Old English ceaster ( " fort ; fortified town " ) . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 The Brigantes were the major Celtic tribe in what is now Northern England ; they had a stronghold in the locality at a sandstone outcrop on which Manchester Cathedral now stands , opposite the banks of the River Irwell . Their territory extended across the fertile lowland of what is now Salford and Stretford . Following the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century , General Agricola ordered the construction of a fort named Mamucium in the year 79 to ensure that Roman interests in Deva Victrix ( Chester ) and Eboracum ( York ) were protected from the Brigantes . Central Manchester has been permanently settled since this time . A stabilised fragment of foundations of the final version of the Roman fort is visible in Castlefield . The Roman habitation of Manchester probably ended around the 3rd century ; its civilian settlement appears to have been abandoned by the mid @-@ 3rd century , although the fort may have supported a small garrison until the late 3rd or early 4th century . After the Roman withdrawal and Saxon conquest , the focus of settlement shifted to the confluence of the Irwell and Irk sometime before the arrival of the Normans after 1066 . Much of the wider area was laid waste in the subsequent Harrying of the North . 
 Thomas de la Warre , lord of the manor , founded and constructed a collegiate church for the parish in 1421 . The church is now Manchester Cathedral ; the domestic premises of the college house Chetham 's School of Music and Chetham 's Library . The library , which opened in 1653 and is still open to the public today , is the oldest free public reference library in the United Kingdom . 
 Manchester is mentioned as having a market in 1282 . Around the 14th century , Manchester received an influx of Flemish weavers , sometimes credited as the foundation of the region 's textile industry . Manchester became an important centre for the manufacture and trade of woollens and linen , and by about 1540 , had expanded to become , in John Leland 's words , " The fairest , best builded , quickest , and most populous town of all Lancashire . " The cathedral and Chetham 's buildings are the only significant survivors of Leland 's Manchester . 
 During the English Civil War Manchester strongly favoured the Parliamentary interest . Although not long @-@ lasting , Cromwell granted it the right to elect its own MP . Charles Worsley , who sat for the city for only a year , was later appointed Major General for Lancashire , Cheshire and Staffordshire during the Rule of the Major Generals . He was a diligent puritan , turning out ale houses and banning the celebration of Christmas ; he died in 1656 . 
 Significant quantities of cotton began to be used after about 1600 , firstly in linen / cotton fustians , but by around 1750 pure cotton fabrics were being produced and cotton had overtaken wool in importance . The Irwell and Mersey were made navigable by 1736 , opening a route from Manchester to the sea docks on the Mersey . The Bridgewater Canal , Britain 's first wholly artificial waterway , was opened in 1761 , bringing coal from mines at Worsley to central Manchester . The canal was extended to the Mersey at Runcorn by 1776 . The combination of competition and improved efficiency halved the cost of coal and halved the transport cost of raw cotton . Manchester became the dominant marketplace for textiles produced in the surrounding towns . A commodities exchange , opened in 1729 , and numerous large warehouses , aided commerce . In 1780 , Richard Arkwright began construction of Manchester 's first cotton mill . In the early 1800s , John Dalton formulated his atomic theory in Manchester . 
 = = = Industrial Revolution = = = 
 Manchester 's history is concerned with textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution . The great majority of cotton spinning took place in the towns of south Lancashire and north Cheshire , and Manchester was for a time the most productive centre of cotton processing , and later the world 's largest marketplace for cotton goods . Manchester was dubbed " <unk> " and " Warehouse City " during the Victorian era . In Australia , New Zealand and South Africa , the term " <unk> " is still used for household linen : sheets , pillow cases , towels , etc . The industrial revolution brought about huge change in Manchester and was key to the increase in Manchester 's population . 
 Manchester began expanding " at an astonishing rate " around the turn of the 19th century as people flocked to the city for work from Scotland , Wales , Ireland and other areas of England as part of a process of unplanned urbanisation brought on by the Industrial Revolution . It developed a wide range of industries , so that by 1835 " Manchester was without challenge the first and greatest industrial city in the world . " Engineering firms initially made machines for the cotton trade , but diversified into general manufacture . Similarly , the chemical industry started by producing bleaches and dyes , but expanded into other areas . Commerce was supported by financial service industries such as banking and insurance . 
 Trade , and feeding the growing population , required a large transport and distribution infrastructure : the canal system was extended , and Manchester became one end of the world 's first intercity passenger railway — the Liverpool and Manchester Railway . Competition between the various forms of transport kept costs down . In 1878 the GPO ( the forerunner of British Telecom ) provided its first telephones to a firm in Manchester . 
 The Manchester Ship Canal was built between 1888 and 1894 , in some sections by canalisation of the Rivers Irwell and Mersey , running 36 miles ( 58 km ) from Salford to Eastham Locks on the tidal Mersey . This enabled oceangoing ships to sail right into the Port of Manchester . On the canal 's banks , just outside the borough , the world 's first industrial estate was created at Trafford Park . Large quantities of machinery , including cotton processing plant , were exported around the world . 
 A centre of capitalism , Manchester was once the scene of bread and labour riots , as well as calls for greater political recognition by the city 's working and non @-@ titled classes . One such gathering ended with the Peterloo Massacre of 16 August 1819 . The economic school of Manchester capitalism developed there , and Manchester was the centre of the Anti @-@ Corn Law League from 1838 onward . 
 Manchester has a notable place in the history of Marxism and left @-@ wing politics ; being the subject of Friedrich Engels ' work The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 ; Engels spent much of his life in and around Manchester , and when Karl Marx visited Manchester , they met at Chetham 's Library . The economics books Marx was reading at the time can be seen in the library , as can the window seat where Marx and Engels would meet . The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester ( at the Mechanics ' Institute , David Street ) , from 2 to 6 June 1868 . Manchester was an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement . 
 At that time , it seemed a place in which anything could happen — new industrial processes , new ways of thinking ( the Manchester School , promoting free trade and laissez @-@ faire ) , new classes or groups in society , new religious sects , and new forms of labour organisation . It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe . A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today : " What Manchester does today , the rest of the world does tomorrow . " Manchester 's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century . Many of the great public buildings ( including Manchester Town Hall ) date from then . The city 's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture , which included the Hallé Orchestra . In 1889 , when county councils were created in England , the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy . 
 Although the Industrial Revolution brought wealth to the city , it also brought poverty and squalor to a large part of the population . Historian Simon Schama noted that " Manchester was the very best and the very worst taken to terrifying extremes , a new kind of city in the world ; the chimneys of industrial suburbs greeting you with columns of smoke " . An American visitor taken to Manchester 's <unk> saw " wretched , defrauded , oppressed , crushed human nature , lying and bleeding fragments " . 
 The number of cotton mills in Manchester itself reached a peak of 108 in 1853 . Thereafter the number began to decline and Manchester was surpassed as the largest centre of cotton spinning by Bolton in the 1850s and Oldham in the 1860s . However , this period of decline coincided with the rise of city as the financial centre of the region . Manchester continued to process cotton , and in 1913 , 65 % of the world 's cotton was processed in the area . The First World War interrupted access to the export markets . Cotton processing in other parts of the world increased , often on machines produced in Manchester . Manchester suffered greatly from the Great Depression and the underlying structural changes that began to supplant the old industries , including textile manufacture .

 Like most of the UK , the Manchester area was mobilised extensively during the Second World War . For example , casting and machining expertise at Beyer , Peacock and Company 's locomotive works in Gorton was switched to bomb making ; Dunlop 's rubber works in Chorlton @-@ on @-@ Medlock made barrage balloons ; and just outside the city in Trafford Park , engineers Metropolitan @-@ Vickers made Avro Manchester and Avro Lancaster bombers and Ford built the Rolls @-@ Royce Merlin engines to power them . Manchester was thus the target of bombing by the Luftwaffe , and by late 1940 air raids were taking place against non @-@ military targets . The biggest took place during the " Christmas Blitz " on the nights of 22 / 23 and 24 December 1940 , when an estimated 474 tonnes ( 467 long tons ) of high explosives plus over 37 @,@ 000 incendiary bombs were dropped . A large part of the historic city centre was destroyed , including 165 warehouses , 200 business premises , and 150 offices . 376 were killed and 30 @,@ 000 houses were damaged . Manchester Cathedral was among the buildings seriously damaged ; its restoration took 20 years .

 Cotton processing and trading continued to fall in peacetime , and the exchange closed in 1968 . By 1963 the port of Manchester was the UK 's third largest , and employed over 3 @,@ 000 men , but the canal was unable to handle the increasingly large container ships . Traffic declined , and the port closed in 1982 . Heavy industry suffered a downturn from the 1960s and was greatly reduced under the economic policies followed by Margaret Thatcher 's government after 1979 . Manchester lost 150 @,@ 000 jobs in manufacturing between 1961 and 1983 . 
 Regeneration began in the late 1980s , with initiatives such as the Metrolink , the Bridgewater Concert Hall , the Manchester Arena , and ( in Salford ) the rebranding of the port as Salford Quays . Two bids to host the Olympic Games were part of a process to raise the international profile of the city . 
 Manchester has a history of attacks attributed to Irish Republicans , including the Manchester Martyrs of 1867 , arson in 1920 , a series of explosions in 1939 , and two bombs in 1992 . On Saturday 15 June 1996 , the Provisional Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) carried out the 1996 Manchester bombing , the detonation of a large bomb next to a department store in the city centre . The largest to be detonated on British soil , the bomb injured over 200 people , heavily damaged nearby buildings , and broke windows 1 ⁄ 2 mile ( 800 m ) away . The cost of the immediate damage was initially estimated at £ 50 million , but this was quickly revised upwards . The final insurance payout was over £ 400 million ; many affected businesses never recovered from the loss of trade . 
 Spurred by the investment after the 1996 bomb , and aided by the XVII Commonwealth Games , Manchester 's city centre has undergone extensive regeneration . New and renovated complexes such as The <unk> and The Triangle have become popular shopping and entertainment destinations . The Manchester Arndale is the UK 's largest city centre shopping centre . 
 Large sections of the city dating from the 1960s have been either demolished and re @-@ developed or modernised with the use of glass and steel . Old mills have been converted into modern apartments , Hulme has undergone extensive regeneration programmes , and million @-@ pound <unk> apartments have since been developed . The 169 @-@ metre tall , 47 @-@ storey Beetham Tower , completed in 2006 , is the tallest building in the UK outside London and when finished was the highest residential accommodation in Europe . In January 2007 , the independent Casino Advisory Panel awarded Manchester a licence to build the only <unk> in the UK , however plans were officially abandoned in February 2008 . 
 Since around the turn of the 21st century , Manchester has been regarded by sections of the international press , British public , and government ministers as being the second city of the United Kingdom . The BBC reports that redevelopment of recent years has heightened claims that Manchester is the second city of the UK . Manchester and Birmingham have traditionally competed as frontrunners for this unofficial title . 
 = = Governance = = 
 The City of Manchester is governed by the Manchester City Council . The earlier Greater Manchester County Council was abolished in 1986 so it is effectively a unitary authority . Manchester has been a member of the English Core Cities Group since its inception in 1995 . 
 The town of Manchester was granted a charter by Thomas <unk> in 1301 , but lost its borough status in a court case of 1359 . Until the 19th century local government was largely in the hands of manorial courts , the last of which was dissolved in 1846 . 
 From a very early time , the township of Manchester lay within the historic or ceremonial county boundaries of Lancashire . Pevsner wrote " That [ neighbouring ] Stretford and Salford are not administratively one with Manchester is one of the most curious anomalies of England " . A stroke of a Norman baron 's pen is said to have divorced Manchester and Salford , though it was not Salford that became separated from Manchester , it was Manchester , with its humbler line of lords , that was separated from Salford . It was this separation that resulted in Salford becoming the judicial seat of Salfordshire , which included the ancient parish of Manchester . Manchester later formed its own Poor Law Union using the name " Manchester " . In 1792 , Commissioners — usually known as " Police Commissioners " — were established for the social improvement of Manchester . Manchester regained its borough status in 1838 , and comprised the townships of Beswick , Cheetham Hill , Chorlton upon Medlock and Hulme . By 1846 , with increasing population and greater industrialisation , the Borough Council had taken over the powers of the " Police Commissioners " . In 1853 , Manchester was granted " city status " in the United Kingdom . 
 In 1885 , Bradford , Harpurhey , Rusholme and parts of Moss Side and Withington townships became part of the City of Manchester . In 1889 , the city became a county borough as did many larger Lancashire towns , and therefore not governed by Lancashire County Council . Between 1890 and 1933 , more areas were added to the city which had been administered by Lancashire County Council , including former villages such as Burnage , Chorlton @-@ cum @-@ Hardy , Didsbury , Fallowfield , Levenshulme , Longsight , and Withington . In 1931 , the Cheshire civil parishes of Baguley , Northenden and Northen Etchells from the south of the River Mersey were added . In 1974 , by way of the Local Government Act 1972 , the City of Manchester became a metropolitan district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester . That year , Ringway , the town where the Manchester Airport is located , was added to the City . 
 In November 2014 it was announced that Greater Manchester would receive a new directly elected Mayor . The Mayor would have fiscal control over health , transport , housing and police in the area . The move was dubbed " Devo <unk> " , a play on the phrase Devo Max .

 At 53 ° 28 ′ 0 ″ N 2 ° 14 ′ 0 ″ W , 160 miles ( 260 km ) northwest of London , Manchester lies in a bowl @-@ shaped land area bordered to the north and east by the Pennines , a mountain chain that runs the length of northern England , and to the south by the Cheshire Plain . Manchester is 35 @.@ 0 miles ( 56 @.@ 3 km ) north @-@ east of Liverpool and 35 @.@ 0 miles ( 56 @.@ 3 km ) north @-@ west of Sheffield , making the city the halfway point between the two . The city centre is on the east bank of the River Irwell , near its confluences with the Rivers Medlock and Irk , and is relatively low @-@ lying , being between 35 to 42 metres ( 115 to 138 feet ) above sea level . The River Mersey flows through the south of Manchester . Much of the inner city , especially in the south , is flat , offering extensive views from many highrise buildings in the city of the foothills and moors of the Pennines , which can often be capped with snow in the winter months . Manchester 's geographic features were highly influential in its early development as the world 's first industrial city . These features are its climate , its proximity to a seaport at Liverpool , the availability of water power from its rivers , and its nearby coal reserves . 
 The name Manchester , though officially applied only to the metropolitan district within Greater Manchester , has been applied to other , wider divisions of land , particularly across much of the Greater Manchester county and urban area . The " Manchester City Zone " , " Manchester post town " and the " Manchester Congestion Charge " are all examples of this . 
 For purposes of the Office for National Statistics , Manchester forms the most populous settlement within the Greater Manchester Urban Area , the United Kingdom 's third @-@ largest conurbation . There is a mixture of high @-@ density urban and suburban locations in Manchester . The largest open space in the city , at around 260 hectares ( 642 acres ) , is Heaton Park . Manchester is contiguous on all sides with several large settlements , except for a small section along its southern boundary with Cheshire . The M60 and M56 motorways pass through the south of Manchester , through Northenden and Wythenshawe respectively . Heavy rail lines enter the city from all directions , the principal destination being Manchester Piccadilly station 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Manchester experiences a temperate Oceanic climate , like much of the British Isles , with mild summers and cool winters . Summer daytime temperatures regularly top 20 Celsius , typically reaching 25 Celsius on sunny days throughout July and August in particular . In more recent years , temperatures now reach over 30 Celsius on occasions . In Winter , temperatures rarely dip below freezing anymore . There is regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year . The city 's average annual rainfall is 806 @.@ 6 millimetres ( 31 @.@ 76 in ) compared to the UK average of 1 @,@ 125 @.@ 0 millimetres ( 44 @.@ 29 in ) , and its mean rain days are 140 @.@ 4 per annum , compared to the UK average of 154 @.@ 4 . Manchester however has a relatively high humidity level and this , along with the abundant supply of soft water , was one of the factors that led to the localisation of the textile industry in the area . Snowfalls are not common in the city , due to the urban warming effect . However , the Pennine and Rossendale Forest hills that surround the city to its east and north receive more snow and roads leading out of the city can be closed due to <unk> notably the A62 road via Oldham and Standedge , the A57 ( Snake Pass ) towards Sheffield , and the M62 over Saddleworth Moor . 
 = = Demography = = 
 Historically the population of Manchester began to increase rapidly during the Victorian era , peaking at 766 @,@ 311 in 1931 . From then the population began to decrease rapidly , due to slum clearance and the increased building of social housing overspill estates by Manchester City Council after the Second World War such as Hattersley and Langley . 
 The 2012 Mid @-@ Year Estimate for the population of Manchester was 510 @,@ 700 . This was an increase of 7 @,@ 900 , or 1 @.@ 6 % , since the 2011 <unk> .

 As the UK economy continues to recover from the downturn experienced in 2008 – 10 , Manchester compares favourably to other <unk> according to the latest figures . In 2012 it is shown the strongest annual growth in business stock ( 5 % ) of all the Core Cities . The city experienced a relatively sharp increase in the number of business deaths , the largest increase of all the Core Cities , however this was offset by strong growth in new businesses which resulted in a strong net growth . 
 Manchester 's civic leadership has a reputation for business acumen . It owns two of the country 's four busiest airports and uses its earnings to fund local projects . Meanwhile , KPMG 's competitive alternative report found that in 2012 Manchester had the 9th lowest tax cost of any industrialised city in the world , and fiscal devolution has come earlier to Manchester than to any other British city : it can keep half the extra taxes it gets from transport investment . 
 KPMG 's competitive alternative report also found that Manchester was Europe 's most affordable city featured , ranking slightly better than Dutch cities , Rotterdam and Amsterdam , who all have a cost of living index less than 95 . 
 Manchester is a city of contrast , where some of the country 's most deprived and most affluent neighbourhoods can be found .

The strong office market in Manchester has been partly attributed to ' <unk> ' , ( from offshoring ) which entails the relocation or alternative creation of jobs away from the overheated South to areas where office space is possibly cheaper and workforce market may not be as saturated . 
 = = Landmarks = = 
 Manchester 's buildings display a variety of architectural styles , ranging from Victorian to contemporary architecture . The widespread use of red brick characterises the city , much of the architecture of which harks back to its days as a global centre for the cotton trade . Just outside the immediate city centre is a large number of former cotton mills , some of which have been left virtually untouched since their closure while many have been redeveloped into apartment buildings and office space . Manchester Town Hall , in Albert Square , was built in the Gothic revival style and is considered to be one of the most important Victorian buildings in England . 
 Manchester also has a number of skyscrapers built during the 1960s and 1970s , the tallest of which was the CIS Tower located near Manchester Victoria station until the Beetham Tower was completed in 2006 ; it is an example of the new surge in high @-@ rise building and includes a Hilton hotel , a restaurant , and apartments . It remains the tallest building outside London and has been described as the United Kingdom 's only true skyscraper outside the capital . The Green Building , opposite Oxford Road station , is a pioneering eco @-@ friendly housing project , while the recently completed One Angel Square , is one of the most sustainable large buildings in the world . The award @-@ winning Heaton Park in the north of the city borough is one of the largest municipal parks in Europe , covering 610 acres ( 250 ha ) of parkland . The city has 135 parks , gardens , and open spaces . 
 Two large squares hold many of Manchester 's public monuments . Albert Square has monuments to Prince Albert , Bishop James Fraser , Oliver Heywood , William Ewart Gladstone , and John Bright . Piccadilly Gardens has monuments dedicated to Queen Victoria , Robert Peel , James Watt and the Duke of Wellington . The cenotaph in St Peter 's Square , by Edwin Lutyens , is Manchester 's main memorial to its war dead . The Alan Turing Memorial in Sackville Park commemorates his role as the father of modern computing . A larger @-@ than @-@ life statue of Abraham Lincoln by George Gray Barnard in the eponymous Lincoln Square ( having stood for many years in Platt Fields ) was presented to the city by Mr. and Mrs. Charles Phelps Taft of Cincinnati , Ohio , to mark the part that Lancashire played in the cotton famine and American Civil War of 1861 – 1865 .

Manchester is a centre for musical education , with the Royal Northern College of Music , which celebrates its 40th Anniversary since its merger , and Chetham 's School of Music . Forerunners of the RNCM were the Northern School of Music ( founded 1920 ) and the Royal Manchester College of Music ( founded 1893 ) , which were merged in 1973 . One of the earliest instructors and classical music pianists / conductors at the <unk> , shortly after its founding was the famous Russian @-@ born Arthur <unk> , ( 1859 – 1932 ) , who later had the music library at the famed Peabody Institute conservatory of music in Baltimore , Maryland , named for him .
