 Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms ) drives all the way to Florida to try and woo back Erin Hannon ( Ellie Kemper ) , where she has been living with the elderly Irene ( Georgia Engel ) and her middle @-@ aged Grandson , Glenn ( Brad Morris ) , as a live @-@ in maid . He surprises Erin by popping out of a delivery box and singing Signed , Sealed , Delivered I 'm Yours , but she is not particularly excited to see him , and states she does not want to go back to Scranton with him . The situation is further complicated when Andy reveals to Erin that he has not yet broken up with his current girlfriend , Jessica . Andy tells Erin he loves her , but she rejects him ; Andy subsequently leaves , his feelings crushed . Irene , who had been treating Andy with disdain over the way Erin spoke of him , sees that he is a nice person and encourages Erin to go back with him . She runs up to him in his car and they share a kiss before heading back to Scranton . 
 Meanwhile , Nellie Bertram ( Catherine Tate ) shows up in Scranton after Robert California ( James Spader ) allows her to have a job there . She is invited to take an open desk , and she takes Andy 's manager desk , as he is currently in Florida . Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) says she cannot take Andy 's job , but Robert is interested in her spontaneous behavior . As acting manager , Nellie decides to give everyone performance reviews . Both Jim and Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) refuse to let her proceed , as she is unfamiliar with the other employees . To counter this , Nellie offers Dwight a raise on the spot , and eventually , he and the other employees relent , except for Jim . When it is Jim 's turn , Jim still refuses . Everyone in the office , except for Jim and his wife , Pam Halpert ( Jenna Fischer ) , applaud her . Nellie promptly begins rearranging the office . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Get the Girl " was written by Charlie Grandy , his second eighth season writing credit after " Lotto " . The episode was directed by series regular Rainn Wilson , who portrays Dwight Schrute . This episode marked his third directing credit to the series , after the sixth season 's " The Cover @-@ Up " , the seventh season 's " Classy Christmas " . The episode marks the sixth appearance of Catherine Tate as Nellie Bertram and her fifth consecutive appearance . Initially , her character , Nellie , worked with several of the office workers on a special project for Sabre in a six @-@ episode arc . " Get the Girl " , however , brought Tate 's character to the Scranton branch where she installed herself as de facto manager . 
 The Season Eight DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode . Notable cut scenes include Nellie offering to give Meredith , Nate , and Darryl a raise ; Robert inviting Nellie out for coffee ; and Jim , Pam and Darryl attempting to contact Andy ; the office discussing the situation with Nellie as manager , Robert refusing to put his foot down ; Andy talking to Erin about his drive to Tallahassee ; and Andy telling the camera that he will not give up on their relationship easily .

 " Get the Girl " aired on March 15 , 2012 . The episode was viewed by an estimated 4 @.@ 88 million viewers and received a 2 @.@ 3 rating / 6 % share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 . This means that it was seen by 2 @.@ 3 % of all 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ olds , and 6 % of all 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ olds watching television at the time of the broadcast . This marked a decrease in the ratings from the previous episode , " Last Day in Florida " . The episode finished second in its time slot , beating a rerun of the Fox supernatural series Touch and The CW teen drama series The Secret Circle . Despite this , the episode was defeated by the ABC medical drama Grey 's Anatomy which drew a 3 @.@ 0 / 6 % rating . In addition , " Get the Girl " was the highest @-@ rated NBC television episode of the night , barely beating the return of Community . 
 = = = Reviews = = = 
 The episode received a wide variety of mixed reviews from critics , ranging from largely negative to moderately positive . Matt Dougherty noted that " Get the Girl " returned The Office " to what it was before the Florida storyline , which is bad . " Furthermore , he called the episode " the worst [ ... ] of the show simply because it lacked any form of logic or emotion . " He ultimately gave the episode a 2 out of 10 rating . A review from Clique Clack called the main plot " miserably insufferable " . Other reviews were more mixed . Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club gave the episode a C + rating . A review from <unk> noted that the episode was " rather predictable , somewhat inconsequential , a bit silly and representative of perhaps a slight step back . " 
 Not all reviews were negative . TV Equals called the episode " pretty funny , " particularly praising the episode 's cold opening . Jeffrey Hyatt from Screen Crave awarded the episode a 7 out of 10 , noting that " There have been worse . And this is another one I will re @-@ watch later and probably like better the second time around . " IGN reviewer Cindy White gave the episode a 7 @.@ 0 out of 10 rating , signifying a " good episode . " Brett Harrison Davinger from the California Literary Review awarded the episode " faint praise " , noting that it was " slightly greater than the sum of its parts . " 
 Many reviews criticized the Andy @-@ Erin plot . White wrote that , " If the Andy and Erin scenes in this episode were supposed to make me root for them , I 'm afraid it didn 't quite work . " Dougherty wrote , " Was anyone else rooting for Erin to just stay down there ? I certainly was . " McNutt bluntly wrote , " I ’ m not buying this relationship . " The <unk> review noted that the arc was " a total carbon copy of the Jim / Pam version that sucked us all in years ago . " 
 Reviews were split on the addition of Nellie <unk> to the Scranton office . McNutt criticized Nellie Bertram , noting that , despite the character 's potential , the show " places her into the series as a blind antagonist without any sense of what drives her to these actions . " Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times argued that the producers of The Office seemed to be using her only because " ' British people are ridiculous and are completely different to Americans ' " . Dan Forcella from TV Fanatics , on the other hand , praised Catherine Tate 's acting and her character , writing , " Tate 's first appearance last season was intriguing , and her stint as head <unk> down in Florida was entertaining , but in " Get the Girl " it became obvious that Nellie Bertram as branch manager could be exactly what The Office needs to stay afloat . " 
 Several reviews criticized the decision to film Erin in front of a green screen for one of her talking heads . White attributed the " terrible green @-@ screen effect " among other things , to Wilson 's " offbeat sense of humor and style . " McNutt proposed that the reason for the " obnoxious " effect was because the show had lost that lawn set but wanted to add an additional talking head scene . 
 = Pensacola Dam = 
 The Pensacola Dam , also known as the Grand River Dam , is a multiple @-@ arch buttress dam on the Grand River in @-@ between Disney and Langley in the U.S. state of Oklahoma . The dam is operated by the Grand River Dam Authority and creates Grand Lake o ' the Cherokees . After decades of vision and planning , it was constructed between 1938 and 1940 for the purposes of hydroelectric power generation , flood control and recreation . It is Oklahoma 's first hydroelectric power plant and is referred to as the longest multiple @-@ arch dam in the world . 
 = = Background = = 
 The idea to construct a dam on the Grand River originated in the late 1800s with Henry C. Holderman , a Cherokee Nation citizen , who wanted to provide electric power to the Cherokee Nation . Holderman and a few colleagues soon conducted the first survey of the river in 1895 on their own handmade houseboat . Holderman later left the United States at the age of 16 and worked on dam projects in India and Africa before returning to Oklahoma . He sold his land holdings and borrowed money from friends in order to purchase rights to the dam sites he had prospected . Over several decades , Holderman and a group known as the " Rainbow Chasers " tried to secure funding to construct the a dam ; making several trips to Washington DC . 
 The dam was almost built in 1914 by British capitalists but plans were halted due to World War I. In 1920 , Holderman refused an offer given by Chicago businessmen and in 1929 , the Wall Street Crash ended the hopes of Canadian engineers and investors building the dam for Holderman . In DC , supporters of the dam , which later included state and federal officials , argued for the dam as a source of hydroelectric power and that it could stimulate the state 's economy but local energy providers opposed the possibility of a state @-@ run electric utility . The onset of the Great Depression would revive and accelerate plans to construct the dam . Just prior in 1928 , Oklahoma Representative Everette B. Howard secured $ 5 @,@ 000 in funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to survey the Grand River . The results of the study concluded that it would cost over $ 6 @.@ 2 million to construct a dam at the " Pensacola site " for flood control . The name " Pensacola " was derived from the only available means of identifying the site at the time : an old store on a Cherokee plantation . Because of limited state funding and a limited water supply on the Grand River , the project was not proposed at first for federal funding under the scope of hydroelectric power but instead for flood control . 
 Oklahoma set up the Grand River Dam Authority ( GRDA ) on January 10 , 1935 . Eventually , on September 18 , 1937 , with the help of Oklahoma Representative Wesley E. Disney , Senator Elmer Thomas and engineer W. R. Holway , President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved $ 20 million in funding through the New Deal 's Public Works Administration for the dam . The higher cost for the dam was attributed to a project that was approved for additional purposes , including hydroelectric power generation and recreation . Additional costs for the dam were covered by the state government and by GRDA municipal bond auctions which appropriated or raised $ 11 million . Disney had pushed much of the legislation for the dam , comparing the higher electric utility rates in Oklahoma compared to other states . Senator Thomas helped appropriate additional state and public funding for the dam while also being instrumental in its legislation . 
 Once approved and funded , Holway , the main engineer on the project and previous engineer of the nearby <unk> Dam , began survey and engineering work on October 25 , 1937 . The multiple @-@ arch buttress design was adopted because materials were expensive at the time of the Great Depression and the limestone and chert foundation was considered " ideal " for the design . John Duncan Forsyth served as the architect for the dam and applied an Art Deco @-@ style to it and the power house . Massman Construction Company out of Kansas City , Missouri was selected to construct the major superstructures , including the dam and power plant . Thousands of workers moved to the area to work on the dam before construction began and 3 @,@ 000 eventually did , earning about $ 16 a week . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Initial construction began in February 1938 and included the excavation of over 1 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 cu yd ( 1 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 m3 ) of earth and rock . Workers also constructed the first cofferdam on the east side of the river and left it in place until the arches were above the normal water level . Once this was achieved , workers removed the east cofferdam and constructed another on the west side of the river to divert water from the location of the future power plant . On December 30 , 1938 , Massman began the first concrete pour . Pouring was conducting 24 @-@ hours a day for 20 months , totaling 510 @,@ 000 cu yd ( 390 @,@ 000 m3 ) . A total of 23 @.@ 9 million pounds of steel and iron were placed into the dam 's structure to reinforce it . Major works on the dam were complete on March 21 , 1940 and the lake was filled by the end of that year 's summer . The dam 's power plant , with four original hydroelectric generators , began commercial operation in 1941 . The dam was finished in 26 months , ahead of schedule . Much of this was attributed to eastern Oklahoma having its 18 driest months on record during construction which alleviated obstacles from flooding . The federal government took control of the dam in November 1941 to aid in the World War II effort and returned it to the GRDA in 1946 . 
 = = = Effect on Native Americans = = = 
 The construction of the Pensacola Dam resulted in the loss of 1 @,@ 285 acres ( 520 ha ) of Cherokee land and 802 acres ( 325 ha ) of the Quapaw Indian Agency , most of which belonged to the Seneca @-@ Cayuga Tribe . This land was condemned and later flooded by the reservoir in 1940 . Half of the Seneca @-@ Cayuga Elk River ceremonial area was flooded as well . Although losing significant portions of land , some tribe members were able to find work on the dam project . 
 = = = Power plant upgrades = = = 
 In the 1950s , two additional generators were added to the power station , bringing the total to six . Between 1995 and 2003 , the dam 's six hydroelectric generators were upgraded , bringing the installed capacity of the power plant from 92 MW to 120 MW and increasing its generation 20 % . Each autumn , a generator was taken out of service , upgraded and returned to service by spring of the next year . The sixth and final generator upgrade was completed in May 2003 . Among the components principally upgraded were the turbine shafts and runners .

 Pensacola Dam is a multiple @-@ arch buttress type consisting of 51 arches and one main spillway , two auxiliary . It has a maximum height of 150 ft ( 46 m ) above the river bed . The total length of the dam and its sections is 6 @,@ 565 ft ( 2 @,@ 001 m ) while the multiple @-@ arch section is 4 @,@ 284 ft ( 1 @,@ 306 m ) long and its combination with the spillway sections measure 5 @,@ 145 ft ( 1 @,@ 568 m ) . Each arch in the dam has a clear span of 60 ft ( 18 m ) and each buttress is 24 ft ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) wide . The thickness of the buttress sidewalls ranges from 5 ft ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) at the base to 2 @.@ 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 67 m ) at the crest . Inside of each buttress are 18 in ( 460 mm ) thick transverse walls that act as " stiffeners " . The buttresses were the widest of their type prior to 1938 and are designed to withstand 500 lbf / in2 ( 3 @,@ 400 kPa ; 35 kgf / cm2 ) . 
 The main spillway , part of the eastern end of the dam , is a 861 ft ( 262 m ) long <unk> @-@ type and utilizes twenty @-@ one 25 ft ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) tall and 36 ft ( 11 m ) wide <unk> gates that are operated by two 60 @-@ ton hoists . The auxiliary spillways are located about 1 mi ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) northeast of the dam and are controlled by another twenty @-@ one 37 ft ( 11 m ) wide and 15 ft ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) high <unk> gates stretched over their combined 860 ft ( 260 m ) length . The lip of the spillways lie at an elevation of 730 ft ( 220 m ) above sea level while the tops of the gates are 755 ft ( 230 m ) . All three spillways have a combined maximum discharge of 525 @,@ 000 cu ft / s ( 14 @,@ 900 m3 / s ) . The two @-@ lane State Highway 28 crosses over the top of the dam and a bridge that stretches over the main spillway . It is accessible by cars and trucks within weight . 
 The dam 's reservoir , Grand Lake o ' the Cherokees ( Grand Lake over the Cherokees ) , has a storage capacity of 1 @,@ 672 @,@ 000 acre · ft ( 2 @.@ 062 × 109 m3 ) of which 540 @,@ 000 acre · ft ( 670 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) is flood storage . The reservoir 's surface area is 46 @,@ 500 acres ( 188 km2 ) and it extends 66 mi ( 106 km ) upstream , creating 1 @,@ 300 mi ( 2 @,@ 100 km ) of shoreline . Normal surface elevation is 742 ft ( 226 m ) above sea level . 
 The dam 's power station is located at the base of the dam 's western end and its building is 279 ft ( 85 m ) long , 72 ft ( 22 m ) wide and 60 ft ( 18 m ) tall . The building houses six 20 MW Francis turbine generators that generate 335 million kWh annually and are each fed with their own individual penstock . The power plant is designed to accommodate four additional generators . It operates at its highest generation levels during the summer and lowest during the winter . Just west of the power station is its substation and an observation house . 
 = = Regulation = = 
 The power station is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) , under the Federal Power Act , with the current license issued in 1992 and set to expire in 2022 . The first license was granted by the FERC 's predecessor , the Federal Power Commission in 1939 . When the reservoir 's elevation exceeds 745 ft ( 227 m ) , control of the dam 's discharges are transferred to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ( USACE ) who manage flood control in the larger basin . By federal regulation , the GRDA and the Corps of Engineers often coordinate discharges and reservoir levels . 
 = = = Impact = = = 
 FERC and USACE regulated releases downstream from the dam have been the center of controversy in recent years . Since the dam is a multi @-@ purpose project , there are conflicting interests between flood control , environmental conservation , recreation and hydroelectric power production . The USACE may request minimal releases to prevent flooding in areas downstream and in hot mid @-@ summer periods , releases can be minimal . This reduces dissolved oxygen ( DO ) levels in the river downstream . Such reductions resulted in the death of at least 5 @,@ 000 fish downstream in July 2007 . Significant releases from the dam have drawn opposition from people such as Oklahoma State Representative Doug Cox . He argues that the large releases effect the state 's economy as an off @-@ road recreational rock park is flooded downstream . Inconsistent releases are blamed for the overall problem and a better regulation of releases has been proposed while the GRDA is contemplating the installation of aeration devices and conducting studies along with other measures . The 1992 FERC license had addressed problematic DO levels and required the GRDA to plan methods to monitor and improve DO levels to a consistency with state water quality standards . 
 = = Tourism = = 
 Between Memorial Day and Labor Day , the GRDA offers free tours of the dam . In 2010 , there were over 9 @,@ 000 visitors ; a number which has been steadily growing in recent years . Additionally in 2010 , the Ecosystems and Education Center was completed and has become part of the tour . The center serves as a water and fish monitoring research lab while offering visitors information about hydropower and water / electrical safety .

 The 1886 Navy Midshipmen football team represented the United States Naval Academy in the 1886 college football season . The team marked the second time that the school played a multiple @-@ game season . The squad was captained by halfback Clarence Stone . The year began with consecutive wins over rivals St. John 's College and Johns Hopkins , but then reversed with a loss to the former and a close victory over the latter . The year concluded with shutout losses to the Princeton reserve squad and Gallaudet . The season was the program 's longest until 1890 , when that year 's team played seven games . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 According to Ellsworth P. <unk> 's biographer C. Douglas Kroll , the first evidence of a form of football at the United States Naval Academy came in 1857 , but the school 's cadets lost interest in the game shortly afterward . The Naval Academy fielded its first official football program in 1879 , headed by William John Maxwell . The team played one match , a 0 – 0 tie , after which the program went on hiatus for two years . It returned with the 1882 season under the guidance of player @-@ coach Vaulx Carter . That season and the following two years of football were single @-@ game seasons played against rival Johns Hopkins ; Navy won two of the three years . The 1885 season was the first the school participated in a multi @-@ game year , playing three games , including the first against nearby St. Johns College . The season was a disappointment , ending in a 1 – 2 record . 
 = = Schedule = = 
 = = Season = = 
 The season began with a game against St. Johns , one of the first contests in what would become a heated rivalry . Navy won the game with relative ease , 12 – 0 . The following game was against Johns Hopkins , played on November 13 . The contest was an irregularity in the schools ' rivalry ; all previous and most following games were played on Thanksgiving Day , as a part of the Naval Academy 's Thanksgiving athletic carnival . Although the score was close , a 6 – 0 win for the Naval Academy , Hopkins was never a threat to the cadets . After this point , the Academy 's luck shifted . The squad was upset 4 – 0 in a rematch with St. Johns , and barely defeated Johns Hopkins in a 15 – 14 contest , played as a part of the athletic carnival . The Baltimore American covered the Johns Hopkins game in detail : 
 Early in the first half , by much rushing , forcing , snapbacks and vigorous <unk> Riggs , the huge Hopkins quarterback , crashed over the goal line for 4 points . Paul Dashiell converted . Riggs repeated his performance but Dashiell missed conversion . Navy then adopted the Hopkins rushing tactics and Stone went over for the first score . 
 With Hopkins backed up against her own goal line , Dashiell broke through the entire Navy team for a touchdown . Goal was missed and the score was 14 to 6 against Navy . With the game fast coming to a close The Tars formed a closely knit ball with the halfback in center . 
 Navy hit paydirt but the referee found something illegal and called the ball back , much to the consternation of the Cadet <unk> . But on the next play George Hayward kicked a field goal , making the score 14 to 11 . Just before the game ended a double pass , Bill Cloke to captain Clarence Stone , carried to ball over the Hopkins goal for the 4 points that won the game . 
 Just two days after the second Hopkins game , on November 27 , the Naval Academy challenged the Princeton Tigers reserve squad and was easily shutout , 30 – 0 . The Academy never came close to scoring on the reserves . The Naval Academy hosted Gallaudet in its final game of the season sometime in December , a contest that the visitors won in a shutout , 16 – 0 . 
 = = Players = = 
 The 1886 Navy football team was made up of twelve players at five unique positions . The squad consisted of five rushers , one snapback , two fullbacks , two halfbacks , and two quarterbacks . Three of the players ( both halfbacks and a rusher ) had played the previous season . The age of the players ranged several years due to the academy 's admission policy ; the school allowed for men between the ages of 14 and 18 to be admitted , which future player John B. Patton remarked made it " just a boys ' school " . 
 = = Postseason and aftermath = = 
 The first postseason college football game would not be played until 1902 , with the Pasadena Tournament of Roses ' establishment of the Tournament East @-@ West football game , later known as the Rose Bowl . The Midshipmen would not participate in their first Rose Bowl until the 1923 season , when they went 5 – 1 – 2 and tied with the Washington Huskies 14 – 14 in the match . As a result of the lack of competition , there were no postseason games played after the 1886 season . According to statistics compiled by <unk> , Houlgate , the National Championship Foundation , Parke H. Davis , and the Helms Athletic Foundation , Princeton and Yale were declared the 1886 season national co @-@ champions . 
 Paul Dashiell , the Johns Hopkins player who nearly single @-@ handedly beat the Naval Academy , later served as the team 's head coach , leading the program to a 25 – 5 – 4 record between 1904 and 1906 . The 1886 season kept Navy 's overall win – loss record at an even 6 – 6 – 1 . It also brought the Academy 's record against Johns Hopkins to a 4 – 2 lead , from which Hopkins never recovered . The season marked the first time a team for the Naval Academy would play a multiple @-@ game season . The 1886 schedule was the longest for the Naval Academy until 1891 , when that year 's squad played seven matches . Navy finished the 1880s with four winning seasons , and an overall record of 14 – 12 – 2 . The school outscored their opponents 292 – 231 , and would go on to finish the 19th century with an overall record of 54 – 19 – 3 . 
 = North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest = 
 The North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) is an area of European importance for wildlife in Norfolk , England . It comprises 7 @,@ 700 ha ( 19 @,@ 027 acres ) of the county 's north coast from just west of Holme @-@ next @-@ the @-@ Sea to Kelling , and is additionally protected through Natura 2000 , Special Protection Area ( SPA ) listings ; it is also part of the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty ( AONB ) . The North Norfolk Coast is also designated as a wetland of international importance on the Ramsar list and most of it is a Biosphere Reserve . 
 Habitats within the SSSI include reed beds , salt marshes , freshwater lagoons and sand or shingle beaches . The wetlands are important for wildlife , including some scarce breeding birds such as pied avocets , western marsh harriers , Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings . The location also attracts migrating birds including vagrant rarities . Ducks and geese winter along this coast in considerable numbers , and several nature reserves provide suitable conditions for water voles , natterjack toads and a number of scarce plants and invertebrates . 
 The area is archaeologically significant , with artefacts dating back to the Upper Paleolithic . The mound of an Iron Age fort is visible at Holkham , and the site of a 23 ha ( 57 acres ) Roman naval port with a fort built on the castrum pattern is just outside Brancaster . The site of the medieval " chapel " ( probably a domestic dwelling ) at Blakeney is no longer accessible . Remains of military use from both world wars include an armoured fighting vehicle gunnery range , a hospital and bombing ranges , as well as passive defences such as pillboxes , barbed wire and tank traps . 
 The SSSI is economically important to the area because of the tourists it attracts for birdwatching and other outdoor activities , although sensitive wildlife sites are managed to avoid damage from the large numbers of visitors . Another threat is the encroachment of the sea on this soft coast . The Environment Agency considers that managed retreat is likely to be the long @-@ term solution , and is working with the Norfolk Wildlife Trust to create new reserves inland to compensate for the loss of scarce habitats at the coast . 
 = = Description = = 
 The SSSI is a long , narrow strip of coast that starts at the eastern boundary of The Wash between Old Hunstanton and Holme @-@ next @-@ the @-@ Sea , and runs east for about 43 km ( 27 mi ) to Kelling . The southern boundary runs roughly west to east except where it detours around towns and villages , and never crosses the A149 coast road . 
 The SSSI has a wide variety of habitats , with bare mud , sand and shingle characterising the intertidal zone along the whole of the coast , although higher areas may have algae or eelgrass that are grazed by ducks and geese in winter . The salt marshes which form on sheltered coasts , in the lee of islands , or behind spits are described in the SSSI notification document as " among the best in Europe " due to their exceptionally diverse flora . Sand dunes occur at several places along the coast , but the best examples are at Holme Dunes , Holkham , Blakeney Point , and Scolt Head Island . The latter two sites are also important for geomorphology research purposes as structures consisting mainly of shingle ridges . Reed beds are fairly localised , but substantial areas occur at Titchwell Marsh , Brancaster and Cley Marshes . Grassland is represented by grazing pasture reclaimed from former salt marsh , with wetter areas at Cley and Salthouse marshes . Woodland is limited in the SSSI , although a belt of Corsican pine planted at Holkham has provided shelter for other trees and shrubs to become established .

 Norfolk has a long history of human occupation dating back to the Palaeolithic , and including significant archaeology . Both modern and Neanderthal people were present in the area between 100 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 years ago , before the last glaciation , and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards . The archaeological record is poor until about 20 @,@ 000 years ago , partly because of the then prevailing very cold conditions , but also because the coastline was much further north than at present . As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic ( 10 @,@ 000 – 5 @,@ 000 BCE ) , the sea level rose , filling what is now the North Sea . This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line , so that many ancient sites are under the sea . Early Mesolithic flint tools with characteristic long blades up to 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) long found on the present @-@ day coast at Titchwell date from a time when it was 60 – 70 km ( 37 – 43 mi ) from the sea . Other flint tools have been found dating from the Upper Paleolithic ( 50 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 BCE ) to the Neolithic ( 5 @,@ 000 – 2 @,@ 500 BCE ) . 
 By 11 @,@ 000 BC , the makers of the long blades had gone . Two timber platforms have been identified within the peat at Titchwell , and may possibly be rare Bronze Age ( 2 @,@ 500 – 800 BCE ) survivals . <unk> is another early Bronze Age site found on the coast at Holme in 1998 . It consists of a ring of 55 oak posts and was built in 2049 BC ; a similar nearby structure , Holme II , may be almost two centuries older . A large Iron Age fort at Holkham enclosed 2 @.@ 5 ha ( 6 @.@ 1 acres ) at the end of a sandy spit in what was then salt marsh , and remained in use until the defeat of the Iceni in 47 AD . 
 Roman period settlements have been discovered all along the Norfolk Coast , notably the complex at <unk> , which covered at least 23 ha ( 57 acres ) near Brancaster . This site included a fort built on the castrum pattern enclosing 2 @.@ 6 ha ( 6 @.@ 3 acres ) within its walls , 2 @.@ 9 m ( 10 ft ) wide . The fort had internal turrets at the corners and was backed by an earth rampart . Early Saxon sites are scarce close to the Norfolk coast , but a gold bracteate found near Blakeney Chapel was a rare and significant 6th @-@ century find , and there is a somewhat later Saxon cemetery at Thornham . The Danelaw left few tangible traces within the SSSI , but place names such as Holkham ( " ship town " ) reflect the Viking influence . Saxon building foundations were described as the ruins of " Cley Chapel " on a 1797 map , although it is more likely that they belonged to a barn . 
 = = = Medieval to nineteenth century = = = 
 An " eye " is an area of higher ground in the marshes , dry enough to support buildings . Cley Eye had been farmed since the earliest human habitation , and was 28 ha ( 70 acres ) in extent in 1651 , but is much reduced by coastal erosion . The Eye and its Saxon barn were accessed by an ancient causeway , passable at low tide . A 1588 map showed " Black Joy Forte " in the same area , which may have been intended as a defence against the Spanish Armada , but was never completed . On the other side of the Glaven , Blakeney Eye had a ditched enclosure during the 11th and 12th centuries , and a building known as " Blakeney Chapel " , which was occupied from the 14th century to around 1600 , and again in the late 17th century . Despite its name , it is unlikely that it had a religious function . Nearly a third of the mostly 14th @-@ to @-@ 16th @-@ century pottery found within the larger and earlier of the two rooms was imported from the continent , reflecting the Glaven ports ' importance in international trade at this time . 
 The sheltered waters of Blakeney Haven had brought prosperity to the internationally important Glaven ports of Cley , Wiveton and Blakeney . Blakeney gained its market charter in 1222 , and the three ports , along with Salthouse , were jointly required to provide three ships for Edward II in 1322 , having previously contributed to his father 's navy in 1301 . By the early 15th century , Blakeney was one of the few ports permitted to trade in horses , gold and silver , through " merchants sworn by oath to the king " , which contributed to the town 's growing wealth . In 1640 , land reclamation schemes , especially those by Henry Calthorpe just to the west of Cley , led to the silting up of the shipping channel and relocation of the wharf , and further reclamation east of the Glaven meant that all the Glaven ports declined ; Cley and Wiveton silted up in the 17th century , but Blakeney had packet ships until 1840 . Similar marsh reclamation schemes took place elsewhere , often with the same consequence for the local harbours , as for example at Holkham . Only Wells @-@ next @-@ the @-@ Sea had significant trade into the late 20th century .

 Artillery may been installed at Gun Hill on the coast near Burnham Overy during the Napoleonic wars , but there were no modern fortifications in north Norfolk at the start of World War I. Following the German naval attack on Great Yarmouth in November 1914 , defences such as trenches , concrete pillboxes and gun batteries were constructed along much of the Norfolk coast . The main bases were outside the SSSI boundaries , but Thornham Marsh was used between 1914 and 1918 by the Royal Flying Corps as a bombing range . A World War I concrete building on Titchwell 's west bank was let as holiday accommodation until the British Army returned in 1942 , but some brickwork on Titchwell Marsh is all that remains of a military hospital dating from that period . 
 There were no new fortifications along this coast at the start of World War II . After the fall of France in 1940 , the threat of invasion led to the creation of new defences . In addition to the installation of anti @-@ tank and other passive obstacles , fourteen coastal batteries , each of two guns , were constructed . A number of these emplacements and other military bases fell within the SSSI area . Four spigot mortar base plates found at Holme dunes may not have originated at that site , since there is no record of such armament there . The marsh at Titchwell was <unk> , and pillboxes built into the beach bank . Between 1942 and 1945 , the marsh was used by the Royal Tank Regiment ; an armoured fighting vehicle gunnery range was established and banks were constructed for firing practice , with targets set at 900 m ( 980 yd ) intervals . Some of the still extant islands were built to hold " pop @-@ up " targets , operated by cables from winches in a building whose foundations now lie below a bird hide . Remains of the triangular concrete track used by the tanks also survive . Military activities continued in the area after the war , and the Royal Air Force returned to Thornham Marsh between 1950 and 1959 . Bombing practice was supervised from a control tower , which was demolished in 1962 , leaving only a concrete structure opposite the end of Titchwell 's west bank . The remains of two World War II Covenanter tanks , probably used as targets , are sometimes exposed at low tide . The SS Vina , an 1894 cargo steamer , was anchored offshore in 1944 for use as an RAF target , but a gale dragged her to the sands off <unk> , where the wreck can still be seen at low tide . 
 Brancaster beach had a base including three pillboxes , Nissen huts and two gun emplacements , and another possible base , comprising about fifty different structures , was located in a salt marsh north @-@ east of Burnham Overy Staithe . A wreck at the west end of Scolt Head Island was used as a bombing target , and the remains of a Blenheim bomber were found at the north of the island in 2004 . 
 Royal Artillery military fortifications were established at Cley beach , including two 6 @-@ inch ( 15 @.@ 24 cm ) guns , five buildings , two pillboxes , a minefield , and concrete anti @-@ tank blocks . A spigot mortar emplacement and an Allan Williams Turret machine gun emplacement were sited closer to the village . One of the pillboxes and remains of the beach gun emplacements were still surviving as of 2012 . The military camp accommodated 160 men and was later used to hold prisoners of war . Near the end of the war , the camp was used to house East European refugees , and was finally pulled down in 1948 . Many of the wartime buildings were destroyed by the Royal Engineers in 1955 , but the generator house was taken over by the coastguard service as an observation post . It was acquired by the NWT in 1983 , and the upper part was used as a look @-@ out , while the larger lower section became a beach café . The building was overwhelmed by shingle in a storm in 2008 , and subsequently demolished .

 The first step towards the protection of this coast by a national conservation body was the purchase of Blakeney Point from the Calthorpe family by banker Charles Rothschild in 1912 . Rothschild gave the property to the National Trust in 1912 , which has managed it since . In 1926 , another early protected area was created when Norfolk birdwatcher Dr Sydney Long bought the land which makes up the Cley Marshes reserve for the sum of £ 5 @,@ 100 , to be held " in perpetuity as a bird breeding sanctuary " . Long then went on to establish the Norfolk Wildlife Trust ( NWT ) . 
 The current SSSI was created in 1986 from pre @-@ existing SSSIs at Blakeney Point , Holme Dunes , Cley , and Salthouse Marshes ( all designated in 1954 ) , Morston Saltmarshes and Brancaster Manor ( 1968 ) , Stiffkey Saltmarshes ( 1969 ) , Thornham Marshes ( 1972 ) and Titchwell Marshes ( 1973 ) , together with the national nature reserves ( <unk> ) at Scolt Head Island ( 1967 ) and Holkham ( 1968 ) , and substantial formerly undesignated areas . 
 Although much of the SSSI is in private hands , considerable areas are managed by large conservation organisations . As well as the two <unk> , there is an RSPB reserve at Titchwell Marsh , and Norfolk Wildlife Trust reserves are at Cley and Salthouse Marshes . The NWT also manages the Holme Dunes NNR . In addition to Blakeney Point , the National Trust owns land at Brancaster Staithe . 
 The SSSI covers 7 @,@ 700 ha ( 19 @,@ 027 acres ) and is additionally protected through Natura 2000 , Special Protection Area ( SPA ) and Ramsar listings , and is part of the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty ( AONB ) . Scolt Head Island and the coast from the Holkham NNR to Salthouse are a Biosphere Reserve .

 The SSSI is designated as a Special Protection Area for birds for its variety of coastal habitats . The large breeding colonies of Sandwich terns and little terns , especially those at Blakeney Point and Scolt Head Island , are of " European importance " as defined in the Birds Directive , and the coast as a whole meets Natural England 's criteria for nationally important populations of common terns , pied avocets and reedbed specialists like western marsh harriers , Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings . Other birds nesting in the wetlands include the northern lapwing , common redshank , and sedge , reed and Cetti 's warblers . Ringed plovers and Eurasian oystercatchers lay their eggs on bare sand in the dunes . Little egrets , Eurasian spoonbills , ruffs and black @-@ tailed godwits are present for much of the year , and the egret and spoonbill have both started nesting within the SSSI . 
 In spring and early summer , migrant birds including the little gull , black tern , Temminck 's stint and garganey may pass through on their way to breed elsewhere . In the autumn , birds arrive from the north ; some , such as <unk> , curlew sandpipers and little stints , just pausing for a few days to refuel before continuing south , others staying for the winter . Offshore , great and Arctic skuas , northern gannets and black @-@ legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds . Large numbers of ducks winter along the coast , including many Eurasian wigeons , Eurasian teals , mallards and gadwalls , goldeneyes and northern pintails . Red @-@ throated divers are usually on the sea , and brent geese feed on sea lettuce and other green algae . Barn owls and sometimes hen harriers quarter the marshes in winter , and snow bunting flocks can be found on the beaches . Thousands of geese , mainly pink @-@ footed , roost at Holkham . 
 The SSSI 's north @-@ facing east coast location can be favourable for huge numbers of migrating birds when the weather conditions are right . These may include vagrant rarities . A black @-@ winged stilt , which acquired the nickname " Sammy " , arrived at Titchwell in 1993 and became a permanent resident up to its disappearance in 2005 . Other major rarities included a western sandpiper at Cley in 2012 , a rufous @-@ tailed robin at Warham Greens in 2011 , and a black @-@ winged pratincole at Titchwell in 2009 .

 Water voles are a highly threatened species in the UK , with a 70 – 90 % decline in numbers mainly due to predation by the introduced American mink , but also habitat loss and water pollution . There are a number of East Anglian sites of national importance for this species , including Cley , Titchwell and other Norfolk coastal sites . Brown hares are widespread , and European otters may be seen at several locations . Both common and grey seals can be seen at the Blakeney Point colony and off the beaches . The common frog , common toad and common lizard all occur in suitable habitats , and the rare natterjack toad breeds at Holkham and Holme . 
 The green hairstreak , purple hairstreak , hummingbird hawk @-@ moth and ghost moth are sometimes seen , particularly in the woods at Holkham , along with the common butterfly and moth species . In some years the clouded yellow , Camberwell beauty , painted lady or diamondback moth may be seen , and the silver Y can sometimes occur in huge numbers . The dune tiger beetle is a nationally rare denizen of moist sand dunes . 
 The lagoons behind the shingle beach at Salthouse and Cley are salty due to the percolation of seawater through the bank . These saline lagoons may cover mud , firm sand or submerged vegetation , and hold some rare and threatened invertebrates including the starlet sea anemone , lagoon sand shrimp , Atlantic ditch shrimp , and lagoon cockle . These marshes are the only reliable UK site for the water beetle yellow <unk> , and even here it is localised and hard to find . 
 = = = Plants = = = 
 On exposed parts of the coast , the muds and sands are scoured by the tides , and have no vegetation except possibly algae or eelgrass . Where the shoreline is more protected , internationally important salt marshes can form , with several uncommon species . The salt marshes contains glassworts and common cord grass in the most exposed regions , with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established : first sea aster , then mainly sea lavender , with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants . The uncommon spiral <unk> and long @-@ <unk> sedge are other lower salt marsh specialists . Scrubby sea @-@ blite and matted sea lavender are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh , although they are uncommon in the UK away from this coast . They may occur alongside scarce species including lesser centaury , curved hard @-@ grass and sea pearlwort , with soft <unk> in the dykes . 
 Grasses such as sea couch grass and sea poa grass are important in the driest areas of the marshes , and on the coastal dunes , where marram grass , sand couch @-@ grass , lyme @-@ grass and red fescue help to bind the sand . Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat , and <unk> is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes . Bird ’ s @-@ foot trefoil , pyramidal orchid , bee orchid and carline thistle flower on the dunes , and Holkham 's Corsican pines shelter creeping lady ’ s tresses and yellow bird 's nest orchids . The shingle ridges on Scolt Head Island and from Blakeney Point east to Salthouse attract biting stonecrop , sea campion , yellow horned poppy , sea thrift and sea beet . Sea barley is a scarcer species of this habitat . 
 The reedbeds , the largest of which are at the Cley , Salthouse and Titchwell reserves , are dominated by common reed , and salt marsh rush , brackish water crowfoot , sea clubrush and common bulrush also occur in the various wetland habitats . The coastal pastures at Cley and Salthouse Marshes have <unk> rush , common <unk> , and less common grasses such as annual beard grass , marsh foxtail , and slender hare ’ s @-@ ear . The flat land just inland from the dunes at Holkham was reclaimed from the marshes by the nineteenth century and was initially used for grazing . It was made arable during World War II , but the water levels have been raised to make the fields attractive to breeding and wintering birds . The pastures are of international importance for the tens of thousands of geese and ducks that feed there in the winter months . 
 = = Access and facilities = = 
 Scolt Head Island is accessed by a ferry from Burnham Overy Staithe which runs between April and September . Blakeney Point can also be reached by boats from Morston quay , either to see the seal colonies or to avoid the long walk up the shingle spit from Cley Beach . The National Trust has an information centre and tea room at the quay , and a visitor centre on the Point , formerly a lifeboat station , is open in the summer months . 
 The rest of the SSSI is close to the A149 coast road , and can be accessed at many points by footpaths or roads . The main nature @-@ orientated facilities are on the major reserves . Holme Dunes NNR is accessed from Holme @-@ next @-@ the @-@ Sea . It has a visitor centre , three bird hides , one of which has disabled access , and a 4 km ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) nature trail . The other reserves are all adjacent to the A149 . Titchwell Marsh RSPB is just west of Titchwell village and has a visitor centre , café and hides . Most of the reserve and its facilities are wheelchair accessible , but the last part of the footpath to the beach is rough , and crosses a steep bank . The two bird hides at Holkham NNR can be reached from the end of Lady Anne 's Drive in Holkham village ; there is also a car park further east on Beach Road , Wells @-@ next @-@ the @-@ Sea . Cley Marshes visitor centre and car park are to the south of the A149 , opposite the main reserve . The centre and four of the five bird hides are accessible to people with limited mobility . 
 Their proximity to the main coast road means that the reserves can be accessed by bus as well as car . The Peddars Way National Trail runs the length of the SSSI , and only short sections of this part of the long distance footpath venture south of the SSSI boundary .

 A 2005 survey at six North Norfolk coastal sites ( <unk> , Titchwell , Holkham , Morston Quay , Blakeney and Cley ) found that 39 per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as the main purpose of their visit . The 7 @.@ 7 million day visitors and 5 @.@ 5 million who made overnight stays in the area in 1999 are estimated to have spent £ 122 million , and created the equivalent of 2 @,@ 325 full @-@ time jobs . Titchwell Marsh RSPB , Cley Marshes NWT and Holkham NNR each attract 100 @,@ 000 or more visitors annually . 
 The small village of Titchwell shows the effect that wildlife visitors can have locally . It adjoins the RSPB 's busiest reserve , Titchwell Marsh , and a 2002 survey reported that an estimated 137 @,@ 700 visitors spent £ 1 @.@ 8 million in the area in 1998 . The village has two three @-@ star hotels and a shop selling telescopes and binoculars , although it does not have a general store or a public house . 
 The large number of visitors sometimes has negative effects . Wildlife may be disturbed , a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as Ringed Plovers , Little Terns and Common Seals , but also wintering geese . Plants can be trampled , which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle . Damage is reduced by measures such as <unk> breeding colonies , using fences , boardwalks and signs to control access , and appropriate positioning of car parks . The Norfolk Coast Partnership , a grouping of conservation and environmental bodies , divide the coast into a number of zones for tourism development purposes . Holme dunes , Holkham dunes and Blakeney Point , sensitive habitats suffering from visitor pressure , were designated as red @-@ zone areas with no development or parking improvements to be recommended . " Orange " locations had fragile habitats , but were under less tourism pressure , or , as with the large nature reserves , were equipped to cope with many visitors . The most robust sites , mainly outside the SSSI , were placed in the green zone . 
 = = Threats = = 
 The underlying geology of the North Norfolk coast is Cretaceous chalk , exposed at Hunstanton cliffs just to the west of the SSSI , but for the entire length of the SSSI coast , the chalk is buried by soft Quaternary glacial debris . Unlike the rapidly eroding soft cliffs further east , the coast of the SSSI has shown a less consistent pattern , with a net accretion of beach material between 1880 and 1950 . However , this coastline is threatened by climate change , with sea level rising an estimated at 1 – 2 mm per year for the last 100 years , increasing the risk of flooding and coastal erosion . 
 One of the most vulnerable stretches is that between Blakeney Point and Weybourne , which included the Cley and Salthouse Marsh reserves . The coast here is protected by a shingle ridge , but the sea attacks the ridge and spit through tidal and storm action , with a single storm sometimes moving a " spectacular " amount of shingle . The Blakeney Point spit has sometimes been breached , becoming an island for a time , and this may happen again . The northernmost part of nearby Blakeney was lost to the sea in the early Middle Ages , probably due to a storm . The spit is moving towards the mainland at about 1 m ( 1 yd ) per year , and for the last two hundred years maps have been accurate enough for the encroachment of the sea to be quantified . Blakeney Chapel was 400 m ( 440 yd ) from the sea in 1817 , but this had reduced to 195 m ( 215 yd ) by the end of the 20th century . The landward movement of the shingle means that the channel of the River Glaven becomes blocked increasingly often , leading to flooding of the reserve and Cley village . The Environment Agency considered a number of remedial options to protect these vulnerable areas , and a new route for the river to the south of its original line was completed in 2007 at a cost of about £ 1 @.@ 5 million . 
 The Environment Agency 's long @-@ term policy is to hold the line only to protect communities and infrastructure , with managed retreat as the solution to rising sea levels elsewhere , even at sites like Cley where the financial benefits from the recreational value of the reserve outweigh the cost of maintaining the sea defences . A scheme to allow tidal flooding of part of the reserve has already been implemented at Titchwell Marsh . 
 Another strategy is to create new reserves inland . To compensate for the inevitable loss of the important reedbeds at Cley , the Environment Agency and the Norfolk Wildlife Trust have been working since 2010 to make a new wetland near Hilgay . The 60 @-@ hectare ( 150 @-@ acre ) Hilgay Wetland Creation Project is converting former farmland into a variety of wetland habitats by using banks , ditches and a lake to manage water levels . The Trust sees this as the first stage of a long @-@ term plan to create a roughly 10 @,@ 000 @-@ hectare ( 25 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ) <unk> Living Landscape . 
 = USS Constitution = 
 USS Constitution is a wooden @-@ hulled , three @-@ masted heavy frigate of the United States Navy , named by President George Washington after the Constitution of the United States of America . Constitution is the oldest commissioned warship afloat in the world . Constitution was launched in 1797 , one of six original frigates authorized for construction by the Naval Act of 1794 and the third constructed . Joshua Humphreys designed the frigates to be the young Navy 's capital ships , and so Constitution and her sisters were larger and more heavily armed and built than standard frigates of the period . Constitution was built in the North End of Boston , Massachusetts at Edmund Hartt 's shipyard . Her first duties with the newly formed U.S. Navy were to provide protection for American merchant shipping during the Quasi @-@ War with France and to defeat the Barbary pirates in the First Barbary War . 
 Constitution is most noted for her actions during the War of 1812 against the United Kingdom , when she captured numerous merchant ships and defeated five British warships : HMS Guerriere , Java , Pictou , Cyane , and Levant . The battle with Guerriere earned her the nickname of " Old Ironsides " and public adoration that has repeatedly saved her from scrapping . She continued to serve as flagship in the Mediterranean and African squadrons , and circled the world in the 1840s . During the American Civil War , she served as a training ship for the United States Naval Academy . She carried American artwork and industrial displays to the Paris Exposition of 1878 . 
 Constitution was retired from active service in 1881 , and served as a receiving ship until designated a museum ship in 1907 . In 1934 , she completed a three @-@ year , 90 @-@ port tour of the nation . Constitution sailed under her own power for her 200th birthday in 1997 , and again in August 2012 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of her victory over Guerriere . 
 Constitution 's stated mission today is to promote understanding of the Navy 's role in war and peace through educational outreach , historical demonstration , and active participation in public events as part of the Naval History & Heritage Command . As a fully commissioned U.S. Navy ship , her crew of 60 officers and sailors participate in ceremonies , educational programs , and special events while keeping the ship open to visitors year round and providing free tours . The officers and crew are all active @-@ duty U.S. Navy personnel and the assignment is considered to be special duty in the U.S. Navy . Traditionally , command of the vessel is assigned to a Navy commander . The ship is usually berthed at Pier 1 of the former Charlestown Navy Yard , at one end of Boston 's Freedom Trail . On May 18 , 2015 , Constitution entered Dry Dock 1 in Charlestown Navy Yard to begin a three @-@ year restoration program .

 In 1785 , Barbary pirates began to seize American merchant vessels in the Mediterranean , most notably from Algiers . In 1793 alone , eleven American ships were captured and their crews and stores held for ransom . To combat this problem , proposals were made for warships to protect American shipping , resulting in the Naval Act of 1794 . The act provided funds to construct six frigates , but included a clause that , if peace terms were agreed to with Algiers , the construction of the ships would be halted . 
 Joshua Humphreys ' design was unusual for the time , being long on keel and narrow of beam ( width ) and mounting very heavy guns . The design called for a diagonal scantling ( rib ) scheme intended to restrict hogging while giving the ships extremely heavy planking . This design gave the hull a greater strength than a more lightly built frigate . Humphreys ' design was based on his realization that the fledgling United States of the period could not match the European states in the size of their navies . This being so , the frigates were designed to overpower any other frigate yet escape from a ship of the line . 
 Primary materials used in her construction consisted of pine and oak , including southern live oak , which was cut from Gascoigne Bluff and milled near St. Simons , Georgia . Her masts were of white pine from Maine . Samuel Nicholson , who became the first captain of the ship , offered the owner of the Old Avery Oak Tree " the unheard of price of $ 70 " to buy the tree to harvest the timber for the keel , but the owner would not sell . The keel was ultimately constructed from an alternative white oak tree , sourced from New Jersey . 
 The name Constitution was selected by President George Washington . Her keel was laid down on 1 November 1794 at Edmund Hartt 's shipyard in Boston , Massachusetts under the supervision of Captain Nicholson and naval constructor Colonel George <unk> . Constitution 's hull was built 21 inches ( 530 mm ) thick and her length between perpendiculars was 175 ft ( 53 m ) , with a 204 ft ( 62 m ) length overall and a width of 43 ft 6 in ( 13 @.@ 26 m ) . In total , 60 acres ( 24 ha ) of trees were needed for her construction . Paul Revere forged the copper bolts and <unk> . The copper sheathing , installed to prevent shipworm , was imported from England . 
 A peace accord was announced between the United States and Algiers in March 1796 , as construction slowly progressed , and construction was halted in accordance with the Naval Act of 1794 . After some debate and prompting by President Washington , Congress agreed to continue to fund the construction of the three ships nearest to completion : United States , Constellation , and Constitution . Constitution 's launching ceremony on 20 September 1797 was attended by President John Adams and Massachusetts Governor Increase Sumner . Upon launch , she slid down the ways only 27 feet ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) before stopping ; her weight had caused the ways to settle into the ground , preventing further movement . An attempt two days later resulted in only an additional 31 feet ( 9 @.@ 4 m ) of travel before the ship again stopped . After a month of rebuilding the ways , Constitution finally slipped into Boston Harbor on 21 October 1797 , with Captain James Sever breaking a bottle of Madeira wine on her bowsprit . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Constitution was rated as a 44 @-@ gun frigate , but she often carried more than 50 guns at a time . Ships of this era had no permanent battery of guns , such as modern Navy ships carry . The guns and cannons were designed to be completely portable , and often were exchanged between ships as situations warranted . Each commanding officer outfitted armaments to his liking , taking into consideration factors such as the overall tonnage of cargo , complement of personnel aboard , and planned routes to be sailed . Consequently , the armaments on ships changed often during their careers , and records of the changes were not generally kept . 
 During the War of 1812 , Constitution 's battery of guns typically consisted of thirty 24 @-@ pounder ( 11 kg ) cannons , with 15 on each side of the gun deck . A total of 22 cannons were deployed on the spar deck , 11 per side , each a 32 @-@ pounder ( 15 kg ) carronade . Four chase guns were also positioned , two each at the stern and bow . 
 Since her 1927 – 1931 restoration , all of the guns aboard Constitution are replicas . Most were cast in 1930 , but two carronades on the spar deck were cast in 1983 . A modern 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) saluting gun was hidden inside the forward long gun on each side during her 1973 – 1976 restoration , in order to restore the capability of firing ceremonial salutes .

 President John Adams ordered all Navy ships to sea in late May 1798 to patrol for armed ships of France , and to free any American ship captured by them . Constitution was still not ready to sail and eventually had to borrow sixteen 18 @-@ pound ( 8 @.@ 2 kg ) cannons from Castle Island before finally being ready . Constitution put to sea on the evening of 22 July 1798 with orders to patrol the Eastern seaboard between New Hampshire and New York . A month later , she was patrolling between Chesapeake Bay and Savannah , Georgia when Nicholson found his first opportunity for capturing a prize . Off the coast of Charleston , South Carolina on 8 September , she intercepted Niger , a 24 @-@ gun ship sailing with a French crew en route from Jamaica to Philadelphia , claiming to have been under the orders of Great Britain . Perhaps not understanding his orders correctly , Nicholson had the crewmen imprisoned , placed a prize crew aboard Niger , and brought her into Norfolk , Virginia . Constitution sailed south again a week later to escort a merchant convoy , but her bowsprit was severely damaged in a gale ; she returned to Boston for repairs . In the meantime , Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddert determined that Niger had been operating under the orders of Great Britain as claimed , and the ship and her crew were released to continue their voyage . The American government paid a restitution of $ 11 @,@ 000 to Great Britain . 
 After departing from Boston on 29 December , Nicholson reported to Commodore John Barry , who was flying his flag in United States near the island of Dominica for patrols in the West Indies . On 15 January 1799 , Constitution intercepted the English merchantman Spencer , which had been taken prize by the French frigate L 'Insurgente a few days prior . Technically , Spencer was a French ship operated by a French prize crew ; but Nicholson , perhaps hesitant after the affair with Niger , released the ship and her crew the next morning . Upon joining Barry 's command , Constitution almost immediately had to put in for repairs to her rigging due to storm damage , and it was not until 1 March that anything of note occurred . On this date , she encountered HMS Santa Margarita , the captain of which was an acquaintance of Nicholson . The two agreed to a sailing duel , which the English captain was confident he would win . But after 11 hours of sailing , Santa Margarita lowered her sails and admitted defeat , paying off the bet with a cask of wine to Nicholson . Resuming her patrols , Constitution managed to recapture the American sloop Neutrality on 27 March and , a few days later , the French ship Carteret . Secretary Stoddert had other plans , however , and recalled Constitution to Boston . She arrived there on 14 May , and Nicholson was relieved of command . 
 = = = Change of command = = = 
 Captain Silas Talbot was recalled to duty to command Constitution and serve as Commodore of operations in the West Indies . After repairs and resupply were completed , Constitution departed Boston on 23 July with a destination of Saint @-@ Domingue via Norfolk and a mission to interrupt French shipping . She took the prize Amelia from a French prize crew on 15 September , and Talbot sent the ship back to New York City with an American prize crew . Constitution arrived at Saint @-@ Domingue on 15 October and rendezvoused with Boston , General Greene , and Norfolk . No further incidents occurred over the next six months , as French depredations in the area had declined . Constitution busied herself with routine patrols and Talbot made diplomatic visits . It was not until April 1800 that Talbot investigated an increase in ship traffic near Puerto Plata , Santo Domingo , and discovered that the French privateer Sandwich had taken refuge there . On 8 May the squadron captured the sloop Sally , and Talbot hatched a plan to capture Sandwich by utilizing the familiarity of Sally to allow the Americans access to the harbor . First Lieutenant Isaac Hull led 90 sailors and Marines into Puerto Plata without challenge on 11 May , capturing Sandwich and spiking the guns of the nearby Spanish fort . However , it was later determined that Sandwich had been captured from a neutral port ; she was returned to the French with apologies , and no prize money was awarded to the squadron . 
 Routine patrols again occupied Constitution for the next two months , until 13 July , when the mainmast trouble of a few months before recurred . She put into Cap Français for repairs . With the terms of enlistment soon to expire for the sailors aboard her , she made preparations to return to the United States , and was relieved of duty by Constellation on 23 July . Constitution escorted twelve merchantmen to Philadelphia on her return voyage , and on 24 August put in at Boston , where she received new masts , sails , and rigging . Even though peace was imminent between the United States and France , Constitution again sailed for the West Indies on 17 December as squadron flagship , rendezvousing with Congress , Adams , Augusta , Richmond , and Trumbull . Although no longer allowed to pursue French shipping , the squadron was assigned to protect American shipping and continued in that capacity until April 1801 , when Herald arrived with orders for the squadron to return to the United States . Constitution returned to Boston , where she lingered ; she was finally scheduled for an overhaul in October , but it was later canceled . She was placed in ordinary on 2 July 1802 .

 Troubles with the Barbary States were suppressed during the United States ' preoccupation with France and the Quasi @-@ War by the payment of tribute to ensure that American merchant ships were not harassed and seized . In 1801 , Yusuf Karamanli of Tripoli was dissatisfied with the amount of tribute that he was receiving in comparison to Algiers , and he demanded an immediate payment of $ 250 @,@ 000 , equal to $ 3 @,@ 555 @,@ 500 today . In response , Thomas Jefferson sent a squadron of frigates to protect American merchant ships in the Mediterranean and to pursue peace with the Barbary States . 
 The first squadron under the command of Richard Dale in President was instructed to escort merchant ships through the Mediterranean and negotiate with leaders of the Barbary States . A second squadron was assembled under the command of Richard Valentine Morris in Chesapeake . The performance of Morris 's squadron was so poor that he was recalled and subsequently dismissed from the Navy in 1803 . 
 Captain Edward Preble recommissioned Constitution on 13 May 1803 as his flagship , and made preparations to command a new squadron for a third blockade attempt . The copper sheathing on Constitution 's hull needed to be replaced ; Paul Revere supplied the copper sheets necessary for the job . Constitution departed Boston on 14 August . On 6 September , near the Rock of Gibraltar , she encountered an unknown ship in the darkness . Constitution went to general quarters , then ran alongside of her . Preble hailed the unknown ship , only to receive a hail in return . After identifying his ship as the United States frigate Constitution , he received the same question again . Preble , losing his patience , said : " I am now going to hail you for the last time . If a proper answer is not returned , I will fire a shot into you . " The stranger returned , " If you give me a shot , I 'll give you a broadside . " Asking once more , Preble demanded an answer , to which he received , " This is His Britannic Majesty 's ship Donegal , 84 guns , Sir Richard Strachan , an English commodore , " as well as a command to " Send your boat on board . " Preble , now devoid of all patience , exclaimed , " This is United States ship Constitution , 44 guns , Edward Preble , an American commodore , who will be damned before he sends his boat on board of any vessel . " And then to his gun crews : " Blow your matches , boys ! " Before the incident escalated further , a boat arrived from the other ship and a British lieutenant relayed his captain 's apologies . The ship was in fact not Donegal but instead HMS Maidstone , a 32 @-@ gun frigate . Constitution had come alongside her so quietly that Maidstone had delayed answering with the proper hail while she readied her guns . This act began the strong allegiance between Preble and the officers under his command , known as " Preble 's boys " , as he had shown that he was willing to defy a presumed ship of the line . 
 Arriving at Gibraltar on 12 September , Preble waited for the other ships of the squadron . His first order of business was to arrange a treaty with Sultan Slimane of Morocco , who was holding American ships hostage to ensure the return of two vessels that the Americans had captured . Departing Gibraltar on 3 October , Constitution and Nautilus arrived at Tangiers on the 4th . Adams and New York arrived the next day . With four American warships in his harbor , the Sultan was more than glad to arrange the transfer of ships between the two nations , and Preble departed with his squadron on 14 October , heading back to Gibraltar . 
 = = = Battle of Tripoli Harbor = = = 
 On 31 October Philadelphia , under the command of William Bainbridge , ran aground off Tripoli while pursuing a Tripoline vessel . The crew was taken prisoner ; Philadelphia was refloated by the <unk> and brought into their harbor . To deprive the <unk> of their prize , Preble planned to destroy Philadelphia using the captured ship <unk> , which was renamed Intrepid . Under the command of Stephen Decatur , Intrepid entered Tripoli Harbor on 16 February 1804 disguised as a merchant ship . Decatur 's crew quickly overpowered the Tripoline crew and set Philadelphia ablaze . 
 Withdrawing the squadron to Syracuse , Sicily , Preble began planning for a summer attack on Tripoli , procuring a number of smaller gunboats that could move in closer to Tripoli than was feasible for Constitution given her deep draft . Arriving the morning of 3 August , Constitution , Argus , Enterprise , Scourge , Syren , the six gunboats , and two bomb ketches began operations . Twenty @-@ two Tripoline gunboats met them in the harbor and , in a series of attacks in the coming month , Constitution and her squadron severely damaged or destroyed the Tripoline gunboats , taking their crews prisoner . Constitution primarily provided gunfire support , bombarding the shore batteries of Tripoli . Despite his losses , Karamanli remained firm in his demand for ransom and tribute . 
 In a last attempt of the season against Tripoli , Preble outfitted Intrepid as a " floating volcano " with 100 short tons ( 91 t ) of gunpowder aboard . She was to sail into Tripoli harbor and blow up in the midst of the corsair fleet , close under the walls of the city . Under the command of Richard Somers , Intrepid made her way into the harbor on the evening of 3 September , but exploded prematurely , killing Somers and his entire crew of thirteen volunteers . 
 Constellation and President arrived at Tripoli on the 9th with Samuel Barron in command ; Preble was forced to relinquish his command of the squadron to Barron , who was senior in rank . Constitution was ordered to Malta on the 11th for repairs , and while en route captured two Greek vessels attempting to deliver wheat into Tripoli . On the 12th , a collision with President severely damaged Constitution 's bow , stern , and figurehead of Hercules . The collision was attributed to an " act of God " , in the form of a sudden change in wind direction . 
 = = = Peace treaty = = = 
 Captain John Rodgers assumed command of Constitution on 9 November 1804 while she underwent repairs and resupply in Malta . She resumed the blockade of Tripoli on 5 April 1805 , capturing a Tripoline xebec and the two prizes that she had captured . Meanwhile , Commodore Barron gave William Eaton naval support to bombard <unk> , while a detachment of US Marines under the command of Presley O 'Bannon was assembled to attack the city by land . They captured it on 27 April . A peace treaty with Tripoli was signed aboard Constitution on 3 June , in which she embarked the crew members of Philadelphia and returned them to Syracuse . Dispatched to Tunis , Constitution arrived there on 30 July , and by 1 August seventeen additional American warships had gathered in its harbor : Congress , Constellation , Enterprise , Essex , Franklin , Hornet , John Adams , Nautilus , Syren , and eight gunboats . Negotiations went on for several days until a short @-@ term blockade of the harbor finally produced a peace treaty on 14 August . 
 Rodgers remained in command of the squadron , tasked with sending warships back to the United States when they were no longer needed . Eventually , all that remained were Constitution , Enterprise , and Hornet . They performed routine patrols and observed the French and Royal Navy operations of the Napoleonic Wars . Rodgers turned over the command of the squadron and Constitution to Captain Hugh G. Campbell on 29 May 1806 . 
 James Barron and Chesapeake sailed out of Norfolk on 15 May 1807 to replace Constitution as the flagship of the Mediterranean squadron , but soon encountered HMS Leopard , resulting in the Chesapeake – Leopard Affair . Relief of Constitution was thereby delayed . Constitution continued patrols , unaware of the delay . She arrived in late June at Leghorn , where she took aboard the disassembled Tripoli Monument for transport back to the United States . Arriving at Málaga , she learned the fate of Chesapeake . Campbell immediately began preparing Constitution and Hornet for possible war against Britain . The crew became mutinous upon learning of the delay in their relief , and refused to sail any further unless the destination was the United States . Campbell and his officers threatened to fire a cannon full of grape shot at the crewmen if they did not comply , thereby putting an end to the conflict . Campbell and the squadron were ordered home on 18 August and set sail for Boston on 8 September , arriving there on 14 October . Constitution had been gone over four years . 
 = = War of 1812 = = 
 Constitution was recommissioned in December with Captain John Rodgers again taking command to oversee a major refitting . She was overhauled at a cost just under $ 100 @,@ 000 ; however , Rodgers inexplicably failed to clean her copper sheathing , leading him to later declare her a " slow sailer " . She spent most of the following two years on training runs and ordinary duty . Isaac Hull took command in June 1810 , and he immediately recognized that she needed her bottom cleaned . " Ten waggon loads " of barnacles and seaweed were removed . 
 Hull departed on 5 August 1811 for France , transporting the new Ambassador Joel Barlow and his family ; they arrived on 1 September . During her visit in Cherbourg , Constitution was examined by French engineers , who reported her qualities to Denis Decrès , comparing her to the similar French 24 @-@ pounder frigate Forte . Decrès ordered construction to resume of 24 @-@ pounder frigates , but the fall of the Empire occurred only a few months later . Hull remained near France and the Netherlands through the winter months , continually holding sail and gun drills to keep the crew ready for possible hostilities with the British . After the events of the Little Belt Affair the previous May , tensions were high between the United States and Britain , and Constitution was shadowed by British frigates while awaiting dispatches from Barlow to carry back to the United States . They arrived home on 18 February 1812 . 
 War was declared on 18 June and Hull put to sea on 12 July , attempting to join the five ships of a squadron under the command of Rodgers in President . Hull sighted five ships off Egg Harbor , New Jersey on 17 July and at first believed them to be Rodgers ' squadron but , by the following morning , the lookouts determined that they were a British squadron out of Halifax : HMS Aeolus , Africa , Belvidera , Guerriere , and Shannon . They had sighted Constitution and were giving chase . 
 Finding himself becalmed , Hull acted on a suggestion given by Charles Morris , ordering the crew to put boats over the side to tow the ship out of range , using kedge anchors to draw the ship forward , and wetting the sails down to take advantage of every breath of wind . The British ships soon imitated the tactic of <unk> and remained in pursuit . The resulting 57 @-@ hour chase in the July heat saw the crew of Constitution employ myriad methods to outrun the squadron , finally pumping overboard 2 @,@ 300 US gal ( 8 @.@ 7 kl ) of drinking water . Cannon fire was exchanged several times , though the British attempts fell short or overshot their mark , including an attempted broadside from Belvidera . On 19 July , Constitution pulled far enough ahead of the British that they abandoned the pursuit . 
 Constitution arrived in Boston on 27 July and remained there just long enough to replenish her supplies . Hull sailed without orders on 2 August to avoid being blockaded in port , heading on a northeast route towards the British shipping lanes near Halifax and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence . Constitution captured three British merchantmen , which Hull ordered burned rather than risk taking them back to an American port . On 16 August , Hull was informed of the presence of a British frigate 100 nmi ( 190 km ; 120 mi ) to the south and sailed in pursuit . 
 = = = Constitution vs. Guerriere = = = 
 A frigate was sighted on 19 August and subsequently determined to be HMS Guerriere ( 38 ) with the words " Not The Little Belt " painted on her <unk> . Guerriere opened fire upon entering range of Constitution , doing little damage . After a few exchanges of cannon fire between the ships , Captain Hull maneuvered into an advantageous position and brought Constitution to within 25 yards ( 23 m ) of Guerriere . He then ordered a full double @-@ loaded broadside fired of grape and round shot which took out Guerriere 's mizzenmast . With her mizzenmast dragging in the water , Guerriere 's maneuverability decreased and she collided with Constitution , her bowsprit becoming entangled in Constitution 's mizzen rigging . This left only Guerriere 's bow guns capable of effective fire . Hull 's cabin caught fire from the shots , but the fire was quickly extinguished . With the ships locked together , both captains ordered boarding parties into action , but due to heavy seas , neither party was able to board the opposing ship . 
 At one point , the two ships rotated together counter @-@ clockwise , with Constitution continuing to fire broadsides . When the two ships pulled apart , the force of the bowsprit 's extraction sent shock waves through Guerriere 's rigging . Her foremast soon collapsed , and that brought the mainmast down shortly afterward . Guerriere was now a dismasted , unmanageable hulk , with close to a third of her crew wounded or killed , while Constitution remained largely intact . The British surrendered . 
 Using his heavier broadsides and his ship 's sailing ability , Hull had managed to surprise the British . Adding to their astonishment , many of their shots rebounded harmlessly off Constitution 's hull . An American sailor reportedly exclaimed " <unk> ! her sides are made of iron ! " and Constitution acquired the nickname " Old Ironsides " . 
 The battle left Guerriere so badly damaged that she was not worth towing to port . The next morning , after transferring the British prisoners onto Constitution , Hull ordered Guerriere burned . Arriving back in Boston on 30 August , Hull and his crew found that news of their victory had spread fast , and they were hailed as heroes . 
 = = = Constitution vs Java = = = 
 William Bainbridge , senior to Hull , took command of " Old Ironsides " on 8 September and prepared her for another mission in British shipping lanes near Brazil . Sailing with Hornet on 27 October , they arrived near São Salvador on 13 December , sighting HMS Bonne Citoyenne in the harbor . Bonne Citoyenne was reportedly carrying $ 1 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 in specie to England , but her captain refused to leave the neutral harbor lest he lose his cargo . Constitution sailed offshore in search of prizes , leaving Hornet to await the departure of Bonne Citoyenne . On 29 December , she met with HMS Java under Captain Henry Lambert , a frigate of the same class as the Guerriere ( approximately half the displacement of Constitution ) and , at the initial hail from Bainbridge , Java answered with a broadside that severely damaged Constitution 's rigging . She was able to recover , however , and returned a series of broadsides to Java . A shot from Java destroyed Constitution 's helm ( wheel ) , so Bainbridge directed the crew to steer her manually using the tiller for the remainder of the engagement . ( Bainbridge was wounded twice during the battle . ) As in the battle with Guerriere , Java 's bowsprit became entangled in Constitution 's rigging , allowing Bainbridge to continue raking her with broadsides . Java 's foremast collapsed , sending her fighting top crashing down through two decks below . 
 Bainbridge drew off to make emergency repairs and re @-@ approached Java an hour later . As in the case with Guerriere , Java lay in shambles , an unmanageable wreck with a badly wounded crew . The British ship surrendered . Bainbridge determined that Java was far too damaged to retain as a prize and ordered her burned , but not before having her helm salvaged and installed on Constitution . Constitution returned to São Salvador on 1 January 1813 , where she met with Hornet and that ship 's two British prizes to disembark the prisoners of Java . Bainbridge ordered Constitution to sail for Boston on 5 January , being far away from a friendly port and needing extensive repairs , leaving Hornet behind to continue waiting for Bonne Citoyenne in the hopes that she would leave the harbor ( she did not ) . Constitution 's victory over Java , the third British warship in as many months to be captured by the United States , prompted the British Admiralty to order its frigates not to engage the heavier American frigates one @-@ on @-@ one ; only British ships of the line or squadrons were permitted to come close enough to these ships to attack . Constitution arrived in Boston on 15 February to even greater celebrations than Hull had received a few months prior . 
 = = = Marblehead and blockade = = = 
 Bainbridge determined that Constitution required new spar deck planking and beams , masts , sails , and rigging , and replacement of her copper bottom . However , personnel and supplies were being diverted to the Great Lakes , causing shortages that kept her in Boston intermittently with her sister ships Chesapeake , Congress , and President for the majority of the year . Charles Stewart took command on 18 July and struggled to complete the construction and recruitment of a new crew , finally making sail on 31 December . She set course for the West Indies to harass British shipping and had captured five merchant ships by late March 1814 , and the 14 @-@ gun HMS Pictou . She also pursued HMS Columbine and Pique , though both ships escaped after realizing that she was an American frigate . 
 Off the coast of Bermuda on 27 March , it was discovered that her mainmast had split , requiring immediate repair . Stewart set a course for Boston where two British ships HMS Junon and Tenedos commenced pursuit on 3 April . Stewart ordered drinking water and food to be cast overboard to lighten her load and gain speed , trusting that her mainmast would hold together long enough for her to make her way into Marblehead , Massachusetts . The last item thrown overboard was the supply of spirits . Upon Constitution 's arrival in the harbor , the citizens of Marblehead rallied in support , assembling what cannons they possessed at Fort Sewall , and the British called off the pursuit . Two weeks later , Constitution made her way into Boston , where she remained blockaded in port until mid @-@ December . 
 = = = HMS Cyane and HMS Levant = = = 
 Captain George Collier of the Royal Navy received command of the 50 @-@ gun HMS Leander and was sent to North America to deal with the American frigates that were causing losses to British merchant shipping . Meanwhile , Charles Stewart saw his chance to escape from Boston Harbor and made it good on the afternoon of 18 December . The ship again set course for Bermuda . Collier gathered a squadron consisting of Leander , Newcastle , and Acasta , and set off in pursuit , but was unable to overtake Constitution . 
 On 24 December , Constitution intercepted the merchantman Lord Nelson and placed a prize crew aboard . Lord Nelson 's stores readily supplied a Christmas dinner for the crew of Constitution ; she had left Boston not fully supplied . Off Cape Finisterre on 8 February 1815 , Stewart learned that the Treaty of Ghent had been signed , but realized that , until it was ratified , a state of war still existed . On 16 February , Constitution captured the British merchantman Susanna with her cargo of animal hides valued at $ 75 @,@ 000 . She then sighted two British ships on 20 February and gave chase . The two were Cyane and Levant , sailing in company . 
 Cyane and Levant began a series of broadsides against Constitution , but Stewart outmaneuvered both of them and forced Levant to draw off for repairs . He concentrated fire on Cyane , which soon struck her colors . Levant returned to engage Constitution but , once she saw that Cyane had been defeated , she turned and attempted escape . Constitution overtook her and , after several more broadsides , she too struck her colors . Stewart remained with his new prizes overnight while ordering repairs to all ships . Constitution had suffered little damage in the battle , though it was later discovered that she had twelve 32 @-@ pound British cannonballs embedded in her hull , none of which had penetrated through . The trio next set a course for the Cape Verde Islands and arrived at Porto <unk> on 10 March . 
 The next morning , Collier 's squadron was spotted on a course for the harbor , and Stewart ordered all ships to sail immediately . Stewart had been unaware until then of the pursuit by Collier . Cyane was able to elude the squadron and make sail for America , where she arrived on 10 April , but Levant was overtaken and recaptured . Collier 's squadron was distracted with Levant while Constitution made another escape from overwhelming forces . 
 Constitution set a course towards Guinea and then west towards Brazil , as Stewart had learned from the capture of Susanna that HMS Inconstant was transporting gold bullion back to England , and he wanted her as a prize . Constitution put into Maranhão on 2 April to offload her British prisoners and replenish her drinking water . While there , Stewart learned by rumor that the Treaty of Ghent had been ratified , and set course for America , receiving verification of peace at San Juan , Puerto Rico on 28 April . He then set course for New York and arrived home on 15 May to large celebrations . Constitution emerged from the war undefeated , though her sister ships Chesapeake and President were not so fortunate , having been captured in 1813 and 1815 respectively . Constitution was moved to Boston and placed in ordinary in January 1816 , sitting out the action of the Second Barbary War . 
 = = = Mediterranean Squadron = = = 
 In April 1820 Isaac Hull , commandant of the Charlestown Navy Yard , directed a refitting of Constitution to prepare her for duty with the Mediterranean Squadron . Joshua Humphreys ' diagonal riders were removed to make room for two iron freshwater tanks , and timbers below the waterline along with the copper sheathing were replaced . At the direction of Secretary of the Navy Smith Thompson , she was also subjected to an unusual experiment in which manually operated paddle wheels were fitted to her hull . If stranded by calm seas , the paddle wheels were designed to propel her at up to 3 knots ( 5 @.@ 6 km / h ; 3 @.@ 5 mph ) by the crew using the ship 's capstan . Initial testing was successful , but Hull and the new commanding officer of Constitution , Jacob Jones , were reportedly unimpressed with paddle wheels on a US Navy ship ; Jones had them removed and stowed in the cargo hold before he departed on 13 May 1821 for a three @-@ year tour of duty in the Mediterranean . 
 The Constitution experienced an uneventful tour , sailing in company with Ontario and Nonsuch , until the behavior of the crews during shore leave gave Jones a reputation as a Commodore who was lax in discipline . Weary of receiving complaints about the crews ' antics while in port , the Navy ordered Jones to return , and Constitution arrived in Boston on 31 May 1824 , upon which Jones was relieved of command . Thomas Macdonough took command and sailed on 29 October for the Mediterranean under the direction of John Rodgers in North Carolina . With discipline restored , Constitution resumed uneventful duty . Macdonough resigned his command for health reasons on 9 October 1825 . Constitution put in for repairs during December and into January 1826 , until Daniel Todd Patterson assumed command on 21 February . By August she had put into Port Mahon , suffering decay of her spar deck , and she remained there until temporary repairs were completed in March 1827 . Constitution returned to Boston on 4 July 1828 and was placed in ordinary . 
 = = Old Ironsides = = 
 Constitution was built in an era when a wooden ship had an expected service life of ten to fifteen years , and she was now thirty @-@ one years old . Secretary of the Navy John Branch made a routine order for surveys of ships held in ordinary , and commandant of the Charlestown Navy Yard Charles Morris estimated a repair cost of over $ 157 @,@ 000 for Constitution . On 14 September 1830 , an article appeared in the Boston Advertiser which erroneously claimed that the Navy intended to scrap Constitution . Two days later , Oliver Wendell Holmes ' poem " Old Ironsides " was published in the same paper and later all over the country , igniting public indignation and inciting efforts to save " Old Ironsides " from the scrap yard . Secretary Branch approved the costs , and Constitution began a leisurely repair period while awaiting completion of the dry dock then under construction at the yard . In contrast to the efforts to save Constitution , another round of surveys in 1834 found her sister ship Congress unfit for repair ; she was unceremoniously broken up in 1835 . 
 On 24 June 1833 , Constitution entered dry dock in company of a crowd of observers , among them Vice President Martin Van Buren , Levi Woodbury , Lewis Cass , and Levi Lincoln . Captain Jesse Elliott , the new commander of the Navy yard , would oversee her reconstruction . With 30 in ( 760 mm ) of hog in her keel , Constitution remained in dry dock until 21 June 1834 . This was the first of many times that souvenirs were made from her old planking ; Isaac Hull ordered walking canes , picture frames , and even a phaeton that was presented to President Andrew Jackson . Meanwhile , Elliot directed the installation of a new figurehead of President Jackson under the bowsprit , which became a subject of much controversy due to Jackson 's political unpopularity in Boston at the time . Elliot was a Jacksonian Democrat , and he received death threats . Rumors circulated about the citizens of Boston storming the navy yard to remove the figurehead themselves . 
 A merchant captain named Samuel Dewey accepted a small wager as to whether he could complete the task of removal . Elliot posted guards on Constitution to ensure safety of the figurehead , but Dewey crossed the Charles River in a small boat , using the noise of thunderstorms to mask his movements , and managed to saw off most of Jackson 's head . The severed head made the rounds between taverns and meeting houses in Boston until Dewey personally returned it to Secretary of the Navy Mahlon Dickerson ; it remained on Dickerson 's library shelf for many years . The addition of busts to her stern escaped controversy of any kind , depicting Isaac Hull , William Bainbridge , and Charles Stewart ; the busts remained in place for the next forty years . 
 = = = Mediterranean and Pacific Squadrons = = = 
 Elliot was appointed captain of Constitution and got underway in March 1835 to New York , where he ordered repairs to the Jackson figurehead , avoiding a second round of controversy . Departing on 16 March Constitution set a course for France to deliver Edward Livingston to his post as Minister . She arrived on 10 April and began the return voyage on 16 May , narrowly avoiding being wrecked off the Isles of Scilly due to the mistaken navigation of her Officer of the Deck . She arrived back in Boston on 23 June , then sailed on 19 August to take her station as flagship in the Mediterranean , arriving at Port Mahon on 19 September . Her duty over the next two years was uneventful as she and United States made routine patrols and diplomatic visits . From April 1837 into February 1838 Elliot collected various ancient artifacts to carry back to America , adding various livestock during the return voyage . Constitution arrived in Norfolk on 31 July . Elliot was later suspended from duty for transporting livestock on a Navy ship . 
 As flagship of the Pacific Squadron under the command of Captain Daniel Turner , she began her next voyage on 1 March 1839 with the duty of patrolling the western coast of South America . Often spending months in one port or another , she visited Valparaíso , Callao , Paita , and Puna while her crew amused themselves with the beaches and taverns in each locality . The return voyage found her at Rio de Janeiro , where Emperor Pedro II of Brazil visited her about 29 August 1841 . Departing Rio , she collided with the ketch Queen Victoria , suffering minor damage , and returned to Norfolk on 31 October . On 22 June 1842 she was recommissioned under the command of Foxhall Alexander Parker for duty with the Home Squadron . After spending months in port she put to sea for three weeks during December , then was again put in ordinary . 
 = = = Around the world = = = 
 In late 1843 , she was moored at Norfolk , serving as a receiving ship . Naval Constructor Foster Rhodes calculated that it would require $ 70 @,@ 000 to make her seaworthy . Acting Secretary David Henshaw faced a dilemma . His budget could not support such a cost , yet he could not allow the country 's favorite ship to deteriorate . He turned to Captain John Percival , known in the service as " Mad Jack " . The captain traveled to Virginia and conducted his own survey of the ship 's needs . He reported that the necessary repairs and upgrades could be done at a cost of $ 10 @,@ 000 . On 6 November , Henshaw told Percival to proceed without delay , but stay within his projected figure . After several months of labor , Percival reported Constitution ready for " a two or even a three year cruise . " 
 She got underway on 29 May , carrying Henry A. Wise , the new Ambassador to Brazil and his family , arriving at Rio de Janeiro on 2 August after making two port visits along the way and remaining there to pack away supplies for the planned journey . She sailed again on 8 September , making port calls at Madagascar , Mozambique , and Zanzibar , and arriving at Sumatra on 1 January 1845 . Many of her crew began to suffer from dysentery and fevers , causing several deaths , which led Percival to set course for Singapore , arriving there 8 February . While in Singapore , Commodore Henry Ducie Chads of HMS Cambrian paid a visit to Constitution , offering what medical assistance his squadron could provide . Chads had been the Lieutenant of Java when that ship surrendered to William Bainbridge thirty @-@ three years earlier . 
 Leaving Singapore , Constitution arrived at <unk> , Cochinchina ( present day Da Nang , Vietnam ) on 10 May . Not long after , Percival was informed that French missionary Dominique Lefèbvre was being held captive under sentence of death . Percival and a squad of Marines went ashore to speak with the local Mandarin . Percival demanded the return of Lefèbvre and took three local leaders hostage to ensure that his demands were met . When no communication was forthcoming , he ordered the capture of three junks , which were brought to Constitution . Percival released the hostages after two days , attempting to show good faith towards the Mandarin , who had demanded their return . During a storm , the three junks escaped upriver ; a detachment of Marines pursued and recaptured them . The supply of food and water from shore was stopped , and Percival gave in to another demand for the release of the junks in order to keep his ship supplied , expecting Lefèbvre to be released . He soon realized that no return would be made , however , and Percival ordered Constitution to depart on 26 May , arriving at Canton , China on 20 June . 
 She spent the next six weeks there while Percival made shore and diplomatic visits . Again the crew suffered from dysentery due to poor drinking water , resulting in three more deaths by the time that she reached Manila on 18 September , spending a week there preparing to enter the Pacific Ocean . She then sailed on 28 September for the Hawaiian Islands , arriving at Honolulu on 16 November . At Honolulu she found Commodore John D. Sloat and his flagship Savannah ; Sloat informed Percival that Constitution was needed in Mexico , as the United States was preparing for war after the Texas annexation . She provisioned for six months and sailed for Mazatlán , arriving there on 13 January 1846 . She sat at anchor for over three months until she was finally allowed to sail for home on 22 April , rounding Cape Horn on 4 July . Arriving in Rio de Janeiro , the ship 's party learned that the Mexican War had begun on 13 May , soon after their departure from Mazatlán . She arrived home in Boston on 27 September and was placed in ordinary on 5 October . 
 = = = Mediterranean and African Squadrons = = = 
 Constitution began a refitting in 1847 for duty with the Mediterranean Squadron . The figurehead of Andrew Jackson that caused so much controversy fifteen years earlier was replaced with another , this time sans the top hat and with a more Napoleonic pose for Jackson . Captain John Gwinn commanded her on this voyage , departing on 9 December 1848 and arriving at Tripoli on 19 January 1849 . She carried Daniel Smith McCauley and his family to Egypt . McCauley 's wife gave birth en route to a son , who was named Constitution Stewart McCauley . 
 At Gaeta on 1 August Constitution received onboard King Ferdinand II and Pope Pius IX , giving them a 21 @-@ gun salute . This was the first time that a Pope set foot on American territory or its equivalent . 
 At Palermo on 1 September , Captain Gwinn died of chronic gastritis and was buried near Lazaretto on the 9th . Captain Thomas Conover assumed command on the 18th and resumed routine patrolling for the rest of the tour , heading home on 1 December 1850 . She was involved in a severe collision with the English brig Confidence , which sank with the loss of her captain . The surviving crew members were carried back to America , where Constitution was placed in ordinary at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in January 1851 . 
 Constitution was recommissioned on 22 December 1852 under the command of John Rudd , and carried Commodore Isaac Mayo for duty with the African Squadron , departing the yard on 2 March 1853 on a leisurely sail towards Africa , arriving there on 18 June . Making a diplomatic visit in Liberia , Mayo arranged a treaty between the <unk> and the Grebo tribes . Mayo resorted to firing cannons into the village of the <unk> in order to get them to agree to the treaty . Constitution took as a prize the American ship H. N. Gambrill , which was determined to be involved in the slave trade , near Angola on 3 November — her last capture . About 22 June 1854 , Mayo arranged another peace treaty between the leaders of <unk> and Half <unk> . The rest of her tour passed uneventfully and she sailed for home on 31 March 1855 . She was diverted to Havana , Cuba , arriving there on 16 May , and departing on the 24th . She arrived at Portsmouth Navy Yard and was decommissioned on 14 June , ending her last duty on the front lines . 
 = = = The American Civil War = = = 
 Santee was the last sailing frigate of the US Navy , launched in 1855 . Steamships began service with the US Navy in growing numbers during the 1850s , and many sail @-@ powered ships were assigned to training duty . Since the formation of the US Naval Academy in 1845 , there had been a growing need for quarters in which to house the students . In 1857 , Constitution was moved to dry dock at the Portsmouth Navy Yard for conversion into a training ship . Some of the earliest known photographs of her were taken during this refitting , which added classrooms on her spar and gun decks and reduced her armament to only 16 guns . Her rating was changed to a " 2nd rate ship . " She was recommissioned on 1 August 1860 and moved from Portsmouth to the Naval Academy . 
 At the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861 , Constitution was ordered to relocate farther north after threats had been made against her by Confederate sympathizers . Several companies of Massachusetts volunteer soldiers were stationed aboard for her protection . R. R. Cuyler towed her to New York City , where she arrived on 29 April . She was subsequently relocated , along with the Naval Academy , to Fort Adams near Newport , Rhode Island for the duration of the war . Her sister ship United States was abandoned by the Union and then captured by Confederate forces at the Gosport Shipyard in Norfolk , Virginia , leaving Constitution as the only remaining frigate of the original six frigates . 
 The Navy bestowed the name New Ironsides , to honor Constitution 's tradition of service , on an ironclad that was launched on 10 May 1862 as part of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron ; she participated in the bombardment of Fort Sumter on 7 April 1863 . However , New Ironsides 's naval career was short @-@ lived ; she was destroyed by fire on 16 December 1865 . In August 1865 , Constitution moved back to Annapolis , along with the rest of the Naval Academy . During the voyage , she was allowed to drop her tow lines from the tug and continue alone under wind power . Despite her age , she was recorded running at 9 knots ( 17 km / h ; 10 mph ) , and arrived at Hampton Roads ten hours ahead of the tug . 
 Settling in again at the Academy , a series of upgrades was installed that included steam pipes and radiators to supply heat from shore , along with gas lighting . From June to August each year , she would depart with midshipmen for their summer training cruise and then return to operate for the rest of the year as a classroom . In June 1867 , her last known plank owner William Bryant died in Maine . George Dewey assumed command in November and he served as her commanding officer until 1870 . In 1871 , her condition had deteriorated to the point where she was retired as a training ship , and then towed to the Philadelphia Navy Yard , where she was placed in ordinary on 26 September . 
 = = = Paris Exposition = = = 
 In the early months of 1873 it was decided that Constitution would be overhauled to participate in the centennial celebrations of the United States . Work began slowly and was intermittently delayed by the transition of the Philadelphia Navy Yard to League Island . By late 1875 the Navy opened bids for an outside contractor to complete her work , and Constitution was moved to Wood , Dialogue and Company in May 1876 , where a small boiler for heat and a coal bin were installed . The Andrew Jackson figurehead was removed at this time and given to the Naval Academy Museum where it remains today . Her construction dragged on during the rest of 1876 , and when the centennial celebrations had long passed , it was decided that she would be used as a training and school ship for apprentices entering the Navy . 
 Oscar C. Badger took command on 9 January 1878 to prepare her for a voyage to the Paris Exposition of 1878 , transporting artwork and industrial displays of American manufacturers to France . Three railroad cars were lashed to her spar deck and all but two cannons were removed when she departed on 4 March . While docking at Le Havre she collided with Ville de Paris , which resulted in Constitution entering dry dock for repairs . Remaining in France for the rest of 1878 , she got underway for the United States on 16 January 1879 , but poor navigation ran her aground the next day near <unk> Head . She was towed into the Portsmouth Naval Dockyard , Hampshire , England , where only minor damage was found and repaired . 
 Her problem @-@ plagued voyage would continue on 13 February when her rudder was damaged during heavy storms , resulting in a total loss of steering control . With the rudder smashing into the hull at random , three crewmen went over the stern on ropes and boatswain 's chairs and secured it . The next morning they rigged together a temporary steering system . Badger set a course for the nearest port , and she arrived in Lisbon on 18 February . Slow dock services delayed her departure until 11 April and her voyage home did not end until 24 May . Carpenter 's Mate Henry Williams , Captain of the Top Joseph Matthews , and Captain of the Top James Horton would receive the Medal of Honor for their actions in repairing the damaged rudder at sea . Constitution returned to her previous duties of training apprentice boys , and on 16 November Ship 's Corporal James Thayer , received a Medal of Honor for saving a boy , who was a crew member of the ship , from drowning . 
 Over the next two years she continued her training cruises , but it soon became apparent that her overhaul in 1876 had been of poor quality , and she was determined to be unfit for service in 1881 . As funds were lacking for another overhaul , she was decommissioned , ending her days as an active @-@ duty naval ship . Moved to the Portsmouth Navy Yard , she was used as a receiving ship . There , she had a housing structure built over her spar deck , and her condition continued to deteriorate , with only a minimal amount of maintenance performed to keep her afloat . In 1896 , Massachusetts Congressman John F. Fitzgerald became aware of her condition and proposed to Congress that funds be appropriated to restore her enough to return to Boston . She arrived at the Charlestown Navy Yard under tow on 21 September 1897 , and after her centennial celebrations in October , she lay there with an uncertain future . 
 = = Museum ship = = 
 In 1900 Congress authorized restoration of Constitution , but did not appropriate any funds for the project ; funding was to be raised privately . The Massachusetts Society of the United Daughters of the War of 1812 spearheaded an effort to raise funds , but ultimately failed . In 1903 the Massachusetts Historical Society 's president Charles Francis Adams requested of Congress that she be rehabilitated and placed back into active service . 
 In 1905 , Secretary of the Navy Charles Joseph Bonaparte suggested that she be towed out to sea and used as target practice , after which she would be allowed to sink . Reading about this in a Boston newspaper , Moses H. <unk> , a businessman from Worcester , Massachusetts , offered to purchase Constitution for $ 10 @,@ 000 . The State Department refused , but <unk> initiated a public campaign which began from Boston and ultimately " spilled all over the country . " The storms of protest from the public prompted Congress to authorize $ 100 @,@ 000 for her restoration in 1906 . First to be removed was the barracks structure on her spar deck , but the limited amount of funds allowed just a partial restoration . By 1907 she began to serve as a museum ship with tours offered to the public . On 1 December 1917 she was renamed Old Constitution , to free her name for a planned new Lexington @-@ class battlecruiser . Originally destined for the lead ship of the class , the name Constitution was shuffled around between hulls until CC @-@ 5 was given the name ; construction of CC @-@ 5 was canceled in 1923 due to the Washington Naval Treaty . The incomplete hull was sold for scrap , and Old Constitution was granted the return of her name on 24 July 1925 . 
 = = = 1925 restoration and tour = = = 
 Admiral Edward Walter Eberle , Chief of Naval Operations , ordered the Board of Inspection and Survey to compile a report on her condition , and the inspection of 19 February 1924 found her in grave condition . Water had to be pumped out of her hold on a daily basis just to keep her afloat , and her stern was in danger of falling off . Almost all deck areas and structural components were filled with rot , and she was considered to be on the verge of ruin . Yet the Board recommended that she be thoroughly repaired in order to preserve her as long as possible . The estimated cost of repairs was $ 400 @,@ 000 . Secretary of the Navy Curtis D. Wilbur proposed to Congress that the required funds be raised privately , and he was authorized to assemble the committee charged with her restoration . 
 The first effort was sponsored by the national Elks Lodge . Programs presented to schoolchildren about " Old Ironsides " encouraged them to donate pennies towards her restoration , eventually raising $ 148 @,@ 000 . In the meantime , the estimates for repair began to climb , eventually reaching over $ 745 @,@ 000 after costs of materials were realized . In September 1926 , Wilbur began to sell copies of a painting of Constitution at 50 cents per copy . The silent film Old Ironsides , which portrayed Constitution during the First Barbary War , premiered in December and helped spur more contributions to her restoration fund . The final campaign allowed memorabilia to be made of her discarded planking and metal . Among the items sold were ashtrays , bookends and picture frames . The committee eventually raised over $ 600 @,@ 000 after expenses — still short of the required amount — and Congress approved up to $ 300 @,@ 000 to complete the restoration . The final cost of the restoration was $ 946 @,@ 000 . 
 Lieutenant John A. Lord was selected to oversee the reconstruction project , and work began while efforts to raise funds were still underway . Materials were difficult to find , especially the live oak needed ; Lord uncovered a long @-@ forgotten stash of live oak ( some 1 @,@ 500 short tons [ 1 @,@ 400 t ] ) at Naval Air Station Pensacola , Florida that had been cut sometime in the 1850s for a ship building program that never began . By the mid @-@ 1920s even the tools needed for the restoration were difficult to find , and some came from as far away as Maine . Constitution entered dry dock with a crowd of 10 @,@ 000 observers on 16 June 1927 . Meanwhile , Charles Francis Adams had been appointed as the Secretary of the Navy , and he proposed that Constitution make a tour of the United States upon her completion as a gift to the nation for its efforts to help restore her . She emerged from dry dock on 15 March 1930 , and many amenities were installed to prepare her for the three @-@ year tour of the country , including water piping throughout , modern toilet and shower facilities , electric lighting to make the interior visible for visitors , and several <unk> for ease of navigation . 
 No stranger to controversy , Constitution experienced another episode when Assistant Secretary of the Navy Ernest Jahncke made comments doubting the ability of the modern US Navy to still sail a vessel of her type . Veterans groups from around the country had proposed that she should make the tour under sail , but due to the schedule of visits on her itinerary she was towed by the minesweeper Grebe . Nevertheless , she was recommissioned on 1 July 1931 under the command of Louis J. Gulliver with a crew of sixty officers and sailors , fifteen Marines , and their mascot , a pet monkey named Rosie . Setting out with much celebration and a 21 @-@ gun salute , the tour of 90 port cities along the Atlantic , Gulf , and Pacific coasts began at Portsmouth , New Hampshire . She went as far north as Bar Harbor , Maine , on the Atlantic coast , south through the Panama Canal Zone , and north again to Bellingham , Washington , on the Pacific Coast . Constitution returned to her home port of Boston in May 1934 after more than 4 @.@ 6 million people visited her during the three @-@ year tour . 
 = = = 1934 return to Boston = = = 
 Settled in Boston again , Constitution returned to serving as a museum ship , receiving 100 @,@ 000 visitors per year . She was maintained by a small crew that watched over her and were berthed on the ship , requiring that a more reliable heating system be installed , eventually leading to a forced @-@ air system in the 1950s and the addition of a sprinkler system that would help protect her from fire . On 21 September 1938 during the New England Hurricane , Constitution broke loose from her dock and was blown out into Boston Harbor where she collided with the destroyer Ralph Talbot ; she suffered only minor damage . 
 With limited funds available , she experienced more deterioration over the years , and items began to disappear from the ship as souvenir hunters picked away at the more portable objects . In 1940 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt placed her in permanent commission . General Bruce Magruder gave the nickname " Old Ironsides " to the 1st Armored Division of the United States Army in honor of the ship . In early 1941 , she was assigned the hull classification symbol IX @-@ 21 and began to serve as a brig for officers awaiting court @-@ martial . The United States Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating Constitution in 1947 , and an act of Congress in 1954 made the Secretary of the Navy responsible for her upkeep . 
 In 1946 Constitution was joined in Boston by the historic sloop @-@ of @-@ war USS Constellation which had spent the previous four decades in Newport , Rhode Island . In an unusual arrangement , both ships had the same commanding officer . In 1954 Constellation was stricken from the Navy list and donated to the city of Baltimore , Maryland for preservation . 
 = = = Restoration = = = 
 In 1970 another survey of her condition was performed , this time finding that repairs were required , but not as extensive as those she had needed in the 1920s . The US Navy determined that an officer of the rank of Commander — typically someone with about twenty years of seniority — would be required as commanding officer , so as to have the experience to organize the maintenance she required . Funds were approved in 1972 for her restoration , and she entered dry dock in April 1973 , remaining until April 1974 . During this period , large quantities of red oak were removed and replaced . The red oak had been added in the 1950s as an experiment to see if it would last better than the live oak , but it had mostly rotted away by 1970 . 
 = = = Bicentennial celebrations = = = 
 Commander Tyrone G. Martin became her captain in August 1974 , as preparations for the upcoming United States Bicentennial celebrations began . Commander Martin set the precedent that all construction work on Constitution was to be aimed towards maintaining her to the 1812 configuration for which she is most noted . In September 1975 her hull classification of IX @-@ 21 was officially canceled . 
 The privately run USS Constitution Museum opened on 8 April 1976 , and one month later Commander Martin dedicated a tract of land located at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Indiana as " Constitution Grove . " The 25 @,@ 000 acres ( 100 km2 ) now supply the majority of the white oak required for repair work . On 10 July Constitution led the parade of tall ships up Boston Harbor for Operation Sail , firing her guns at one @-@ minute intervals for the first time in approximately 100 years . On the 11th she rendered a 21 @-@ gun salute to Her Majesty 's Yacht Britannia as Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh , arrived for a state visit . The royal couple were piped aboard and privately toured the ship for approximately thirty minutes with Commander Martin and Secretary of the Navy J. William Middendorf . Upon their departure the crew of Constitution rendered three cheers for the Queen . Over 900 @,@ 000 visitors toured " Old Ironsides " that year . 
 = = = 1995 reconstruction = = = 
 Constitution entered dry dock in 1992 for an inspection and minor repair period that turned out to be her most comprehensive structural restoration and repair since she was launched in 1797 . Over the 200 years of her career , as her mission changed from a fighting warship to a training ship and eventually a receiving ship , multiple <unk> had removed most of her original construction components and design . In 1993 the Naval History & Heritage Command Detachment Boston reviewed Humphreys ' original plans and identified five main structural components that were required to prevent hogging of a ship 's hull , as Constitution had at this point 13 in ( 330 mm ) of hog . Using a 1 : 16 scale model of the ship , they were able to determine that restoring the original components would result in a 10 % increase in hull stiffness . 
 Using radiography , a technique unavailable during previous reconstructions , 300 scans of her timbers were completed to find any hidden problems otherwise undetectable from the outside . Aided by the United States Forest Service 's Forest Products Laboratory , the repair crew used sound wave testing to determine the condition of the remaining timbers that may have been rotting from the inside . The 13 in ( 330 mm ) of hog was removed from her keel by allowing the ship to settle naturally while in dry dock . The most difficult task , as it had been during her 1920s restoration , was the procurement of timber in the quantity and sizes needed . The city of Charleston , South Carolina , donated live oak trees that had been felled by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 , and the International Paper Company donated live oak from its own property . The project continued to reconstruct her to 1812 specifications even as she remained open to visitors , who were allowed to observe the process and converse with workers . The twelve million dollar project was completed in 1995 . 
 = = = Sailing on 200th anniversary = = = 
 As early as 1991 , Commander David Cashman had suggested that Constitution should sail , rather than be towed , to celebrate her 200th anniversary in 1997 . The proposal was approved , though it was thought to be a large undertaking since she had not sailed in over 100 years . When she emerged from dry dock in 1995 , a more serious effort began to prepare her for sail . As in the 1920s , education programs aimed at school children helped collect pennies to purchase the sails to make the voyage possible . Eventually her six @-@ sail battle configuration would consist of <unk> , topsails , and driver . 
 Commander Mike Beck began training the crew for the historic sail using an 1819 Navy sailing manual and several months of practice , including time spent aboard the Coast Guard cutter Eagle . On 19 July 1997 a free showing of the classic silent film Old Ironsides was given , with the film accompanist , organist Dennis James , using original materials by Hugo Riesenfeld , and period scores . During the scene depicting its battle with the Guerriere , the ship 's actual cannon were fired in sync with the film . The next day , on 20 July , Constitution was towed from her usual berth in Boston to an overnight mooring in Marblehead , Massachusetts . En route she made her first sail in 116 years at a recorded 6 knots ( 11 km / h ; 6 @.@ 9 mph ) , and was absent overnight from her berth in Charlestown for the first time since 1934 . Embarked dignitaries included the Secretary of the Navy John H. Dalton , Chief of Naval Operations Jay L. Johnson , the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps Richard I. Neal , US Senator Ted Kennedy , US Senator John Kerry , and journalist and avid recreational sailor Walter Cronkite . 
 The next day , 21 July , she was towed 5 nautical miles ( 9 @.@ 3 km ; 5 @.@ 8 mi ) offshore , where the tow line was dropped and Commander Beck ordered six sails set ( <unk> , topsails , and <unk> ) . She then sailed for 40 minutes on a south @-@ south @-@ east course with true wind speeds of about 12 kn ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) , attaining a top recorded speed of 4 kn ( 7 @.@ 4 km / h ; 4 @.@ 6 mph ) . While under sail , her modern US naval combatant escorts , the guided missile destroyer Ramage and frigate Halyburton , rendered passing honors to " Old Ironsides " , and she was overflown by the US Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron , the Blue Angels . Inbound to her permanent berth at Charlestown she rendered a 21 @-@ gun salute to the nation off Fort Independence in Boston Harbor . 
 = = = Present day = = = 
 The mission of Constitution is to promote understanding of the Navy 's role in war and peace through active participation in public events and education through outreach programs , public access , and historic demonstration . Her crew of 6 officers and 46 enlisted participate in ceremonies , educational programs , and special events while keeping the ship open to visitors year @-@ round and providing free tours . The crewmen are all active @-@ duty members of the U.S. Navy , and the assignment is considered to be special duty . Despite entering dry dock in May 2015 , Constitution is the oldest commissioned warship afloat in the world , as her dry docking is for a scheduled restoration , before returning to sea . 
 The Naval History and Heritage Command Detachment Boston is responsible for planning and performing her maintenance , repair , and restoration , keeping her as close to her 1812 configuration as possible . The detachment estimates that approximately 10 – 15 percent of the timber in Constitution contains original material installed during her initial construction period in the years 1795 – 1797 . 
 Constitution was previously berthed at Pier One of the former Charlestown Navy Yard , at one end of Boston 's Freedom Trail . She is currently docked in Dry Dock 1 , and is open to the public year round . The privately run USS Constitution Museum is nearby , located in a restored shipyard building at the foot of Pier Two . Prior to her dry @-@ docking , Constitution would typically make one " turnaround cruise " each year during which she would be towed out into Boston Harbor to perform underway demonstrations , including a gun drill , and then returned to her dock , where she would be berthed in the opposite direction to ensure that she weathers evenly . The " turnaround cruise " was open to the general public based on a " lottery draw " of interested persons each year . 
 In 2003 the special effects crew from the production of Master and Commander : The Far Side of the World spent several days using Constitution as a computer model for the fictional French frigate Acheron , using stem @-@ to @-@ stern digital image scans of " Old Ironsides . " Lieutenant Commander John <unk> of the Royal Navy , commanding officer of HMS Victory , paid a visit to Constitution in November 2007 , touring the local facilities with Commander William A. Bullard III . They discussed arranging an exchange program between the two ships . 
 Constitution emerged from a three @-@ year repair period in November 2010 . During this time the entire spar deck was stripped down to the support beams , and the decking overhead was replaced to restore its original curvature , allowing water to drain overboard and not remain standing on the deck . In addition to decking repairs , 50 hull planks and the main hatch were repaired or replaced . The restoration continued the focus toward keeping her appearance of 1812 by replacing her upper sides so that she now resembles what she looked like after her triumph over Guerriere , when she gained her nickname " Old Ironsides " . The crew of Constitution and her commanding officer , Commander Matt Bonner , during the bicentennial observances of the War of 1812 , sailed Constitution under her own power on 19 August 2012 , the anniversary of her victory over Guerriere . Bonner was Constitution 's 72nd commanding officer . Her 73rd and current commanding officer , Commander Sean D. Kearns , assumed command of Constitution on 26 July 2013 . 
 On 17 October 2014 , Constitution set out into the Boston harbor for her fifth and final voyage of 2014 , the historic warship 's final Boston Harbor cruise until 2018 . A special ceremony was held aboard the ship to celebrate its 217th birthday . The Boston Pops and Dropkick Murphys gave performances aboard the ship . 
 On 18 May 2015 the ship entered Dry Dock 1 in Charlestown Navy Yard to begin a three @-@ year restoration program . The restoration plans to restore the copper sheets on the ship 's hull and replace additional deck boards . The Department of the Navy is providing the $ 12 – 15 million expected cost . 
 After the USS Simpson was decommissioned in September 2015 , the 217 @-@ year @-@ old Constitution became the only United States ship still in active service to have sunk an enemy vessel . However , this arguably depends on the definition of ' enemy ' as USS Farragut , USS Bunker Hill and several other active ships have sunk pirate skiffs / <unk> during Operation Ocean Shield

 = = Plot = = 
 The film starts with Rahul ( Shah Rukh Khan ) standing near a fire mourning the loss of his wife Tina ( Rani Mukerji ) . A series of flashbacks is then shown with Rahul & Tina 's marriage , their honeymoon , Tina pregnant with her baby girl and , in a year of marriage , Tina gives birth to the baby girl . Tina was told that she would have complications in her pregnancy earlier but decided not to tell Rahul as she knew how much he wanted the child . Tina , who also loved the baby more than her life , has little time left , so she had previously written eight letters to her daughter ( one for each of her first eight birthdays ) and gives them to Rahul 's mother ( Farida Jalal ) so that she will know her mother . Before dying , Tina asks Rahul to promise her to name their daughter Anjali . 
 Eight years pass , and Rahul is a single parent living with his daughter Anjali Khanna ( Sana Saeed ) and loving mother . On her eighth birthday , little Anjali reads the last and most important letter that her mother left her ; it tells the story of how Rahul met Tina . 
 We are then taken back in time : Rahul Khanna and Anjali Sharma ( Kajol ) were best friends in St. Xavier 's College . The college principal Mr. Malhotra ( Anupam Kher ) had a beautiful daughter Tina , who came to St. Xavier 's from London to finish her degree . She became friends with both Rahul and Anjali . When Anjali realized that she was in love with Rahul , she was encouraged by her motherly guardian <unk> Bi ( Himani Shivpuri ) to tell him so . Instead , Anjali was left heartbroken when Rahul told her that he loved Tina . Anjali decided to leave college and shared a tearful goodbye with Rahul , going away from Rahul and Tina 's lives forever . Tina then realized that she came between two best friends . Back in the present , Tina explains in her letter that Rahul always said that love is friendship , and without friendship there can be no love . Rahul is a single parent and lacks a friend in his life , so Tina gives her daughter the mission of reuniting Rahul with Anjali Sharma and bringing back Rahul 's lost love . 
 The next day , Rahul , little Anjali and his mom head to Faridabad where they meet Mr. Malhotra for Tina 's death anniversary . Anjali Sharma is no longer the tomboy she was in college ; she is now more feminine , and is engaged to Aman Mehra ( Salman Khan ) , an NRI living in London . However , she explains to her mother ( Reema Lagoo ) that she does not really love him and is marrying him as a compromise as she feels she can never love again after losing Rahul . Aman also suspects that she does not really love him . Anjali Khanna and her grandmother search for Anjali Sharma and soon learn that she is going to be working at a summer camp . Rahul tells Anjali that she is not going to summer camp and heads to a conference , only to find out that his mom and daughter went without telling him but Anjali left a letter . They travel there , with a plan to later lure Rahul to come as well , and the two <unk> meet each other . One night while watching television , Anjali Sharma realizes she has met her best friend 's daughter , and that Tina is dead . Rahul soon arrives at Camp Sunshine when his daughter Anjali fakes a cough , where he and Anjali Sharma are surprised and delighted to see each other again , sharing a sweet reunion . Throughout the days spent at the camp , Rahul and Anjali feel themselves falling in love . However , Anjali remembers that she is engaged and feels guilty . Aman arrives and tells Rahul that he is Anjali 's fiancee . Rahul is heartbroken but congratulates Anjali . She takes this as him rejecting her again , so she leaves summer camp and decides to get married to Aman as soon as possible . 
 After seeing Tina in a vision , Rahul and his family go to Anjali 's wedding , where Rahul silently confesses to Anjali that he loves her , and watches in tears as she is brought forth for the wedding . Realizing this , Anjali is hesitant to go on with the marriage , and stands weeping . Aman notices the tears in her eyes and realizes that she has always been in love with Rahul . He releases Anjali from the engagement and tells her to marry Rahul . Rahul and Anjali have an emotional hug and as the two marry , little Anjali sees a vision of Tina , who is smiling and giving her the thumbs up .

 After the experience of assisting and acting in his cousin Aditya Chopra 's directorial debut , the romance film Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge , Karan Johar was encouraged to try his own hand at directing . With Kuch Kuch Hota Hai , he chose to pair up the same lead actors , Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol , for his own romance film . During the filming of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge , Khan had also encouraged Johar to make his own film , and said that he would be willing to star in it . 
 Johar first wrote a story , which was a love triangle between a tomboy , a very pretty girl and a slightly insensitive boy , but he shelved the idea because he was not very satisfied with it . Then he wrote another plot about a widower and his child , which he shelved as well . Eventually he decided to merge the two stories into one . He explained in an interview with Rediff.com : " It was about the trauma of a widower and his little child . How the child really wants a mother and how she brings her mother into her father 's life . Then I thought : Why not bring a youth aspect to the story ? Why not a flashback ? That 's how the story got made . " The story also includes a " personal desires vs. parental loyalties " theme , and has some " East meets West " themes , but instead of the characters going abroad , it creates a virtual West inside India .

 Karan Johar was certain from the beginning that he wanted to cast Shah Rukh Khan in the lead role , having observed him during the making of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge . It took longer to fill the role of Tina . The role was written with Twinkle Khanna in mind , but she turned it down . Other actresses such as Tabu , Shilpa Shetty , Urmila <unk> , Aishwarya Rai , Raveena Tandon and Karisma Kapoor were offered the role but also turned it down . Rani Mukerji , without being asked , read the script and volunteered for the part , which gave a boost to her career . Saif Ali Khan , Ajay Devgan and <unk> Singh were initially offered the role of Aman , but they all turned it down , thus prompting Johar to rope in Salman Khan . 
 Johar , who is also a costume designer , wanted to set a new level for style in Hindi cinema with this film . He and his friend Manish Malhotra , the film 's costume designer , made trips to London for costumes , much to the chagrin of his father and producer Yash Johar , who was concerned about the budget . Many of the costumes in the film prominently displayed logos from designers such as DKNY and Polo . In addition to the designer fashions , Johar also created a somewhat fantastical world where the students speak Hinglish and enjoy a pristine college campus , where there is no crime or hate , and traditional Hindu values are pervasive . Johar admitted that the look and feel of the college scenes in the film were patterned after Beverly Hills 90210 , saying , " The art , the costumes , tilt toward the West , but the soul of the film is Indian . " He hired Sharmishta Roy as art director , and told her to produce something similar to Riverdale High School of the Archie Comics , with some 90210 influence as well . Johar said of the outcome , " If you see KKHH , Shahrukh plays Archie , Rani Mukherji plays Veronica , and Kajol played Bettie . It was exactly that . And the principal looked like <unk> , and Ms. Grundy was Archana Puran Singh . " Johar also hired Farah Khan to do the choreography , Jatin @-@ Lalit to provide the music , Santosh <unk> as cinematographer , and Nikhil Advani as his associate director . Shabina Khan assisted Manish Malhotra with costume design .

 Filming began on 21 October 1997 . The crew was young and inexperienced to the point where Shah Rukh Khan had to explain basic technicalities of filming . Khan later said , " Karan makes no bones of the fact that his technical knowledge of filmmaking was not at its peak when he made the biggest hit of the decade . " The entire film was shot in nine and half months with a substantial part of it shot in Mauritius . The title song was filmed over a ten @-@ day <unk> in several picturesque locations in Scotland , including Eilean Donan , Glen Coe , Loch Lomond and Tantallon Castle with the nearby Bass Rock as a backdrop in one scene . 
 During the bicycle sequence in the " Yeh <unk> Hai Deewana " song , Kajol lost control of her bike , fell flat on her face and was knocked unconscious while also injuring her knee . During the promotional Making of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai TV special , Kajol stated that the accident was her most memorable part of shooting the film because she doesn 't remember it . During preparation for the reunion scene where the two leads met after more than 8 years apart , the director told them to improvise and rehearse the reactions that they might use , but he secretly taped them , and was so pleased with the result that it was put into the film .

On the negative side , she said " The second half however gets drowned in a sea of emotions . Too many people begin to cry a bit too much . " Anish Khanna of Planet Bollywood rated the film 9 @.@ 5 out of 10 stars , calling it " pure escapist cinema at its best . " He praised the cinematography , choreography , set decoration , and also raved over Kajol 's performance , along with her onscreen chemistry with Shah Rukh Khan .

" In contrast to these views , the reaction of Sujata C J , writing for Rediff.com , was that the film was very disappointing , with many cliches and a bad story line , though Santosh <unk> and Sharmishta Roy were praised for their camerawork and art direction , respectively .

 " En Ami " is the fifteenth episode of the seventh season of the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on March 19 , 2000 . The episode helped to explore the series ' overarching mythology . " En Ami " earned a Nielsen household rating of 7 @.@ 5 , being watched by 11 @.@ 99 million people in its initial broadcast . The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics , although elements of the script , as well as The Smoking Man 's ( William B. Davis ) motives , were criticized . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In this episode , Scully is intrigued after a young boy with cancer , whose parents don ’ t believe in medical treatment because it is against God ’ s will , recovers miraculously . What she soon discovers is that his cure is not miraculous , but scientific . Eager , if wary , to learn of the truth behind his secrets , Scully agrees to travel with the Smoking Man to get the cure to all mankind ’ s diseases . 
 The script was Davis ' first — and only — writing contribution to the series . Davis , inspired by the Shakespeare play Richard III , wanted to write a story wherein The Smoking Man was able to lure Scully in by enticing her with medical knowledge . In addition , " En Ami " was the last episode of The X @-@ Files to be directed by Rob Bowman . The episode 's title means " as a friend " in French and also functions as a pun , reading phonetically as " enemy " in English . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Jason <unk> , a young cancer patient , is ushered out of the car , carried past cameras and shouting onlookers , and placed in his bed , where his father tells him that God will decide if he can be cured of his cancer . Later in the night , the boy sees bright light and men in black walking towards his window . The next day , the boy is miraculously cured of his cancer . 
 Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) are anonymously given information about Jason 's case , and they soon investigate . At the <unk> house , Jason says that angels came to him and one of them pinched the back of his neck , and now his cancer is gone . Scully examines his neck and finds an incision exactly like the one she received when she was abducted . Upon leaving , Scully finds The Smoking Man ( William B. Davis ) in her car . The Smoking Man tells her that he was the one who saved Jason 's life , and that since he is dying he wants to atone his previously evil behavior by giving the cure to Scully . Scully leaves , but not before The Smoking Man gives her his phone number . Scully traces the number to The Smoking Man 's office address . He explains that he is dying of a cerebral inflammation that developed after his surgery ( The Sixth Extinction II : Amor Fati ) . She agrees to go on a trip to retrieve the cure , but wears a wire , in order to send taped recordings of their conversations to Mulder . 
 During the trip , The Smoking Man tells Scully that he believes he shares a special kinship with her because he once held her own life in his hands . Mulder finds a message Scully left on his phone suspicious and goes to her apartment , where the landlord tells him that she left with someone else . The Smoking Man and Scully arrive at the home of Marjorie Butters ( Louise Latham ) , a 118 @-@ year @-@ old gardener who also has the chip implanted in the back of her neck . Meanwhile , Mulder visits Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) to voice his concern , but Scully calls Skinner during the meeting and says that she is fine . At a gas station , Scully removes the wire , places it in an envelope , and mails it to Mulder . However , a man following the two removes the letter from the mailbox . 
 The Lone Gunmen come to Mulder 's apartment in disguise and tell him that they cannot find Scully . They reveal that they have found e @-@ mails between Scully and a man called Cobra , who is apparently working on a shadow project at the Department of Defense . Meanwhile , Scully wakes up in a cabin in Pennsylvania in pajamas instead of her clothes , and accuses The Smoking Man of drugging her . He claims she was merely exhausted and he was trying to make her comfortable . She attempts to leave but decides to continue when The Smoking Man tells her she 's free to go and that the choice of whether to accept his help or not is hers . Mulder and The Lone Gunmen go to Skinner to figure out why Scully was communicating with Cobra . They find that an anonymous person has hacked into Scully 's computer and has been sending Cobra messages calling for a meeting . The group believe that it is the work of The Smoking Man , but Skinner still does not know how to get a hold of him . At dinner , The Smoking Man tells Scully that the cure he possesses is not just the cure for cancer , but for all human disease , and that it is extraterrestrial . The Smoking Man goes outside and tells the man who has been following them that Cobra has not shown . Scully finds a note under her dessert plate saying to meet at Calico Cove at dawn . She goes alone and is stopped by Cobra , who gives her a disc before being shot and killed by a sniper . The sniper also attempts to kill Scully , but is killed by The Smoking Man . 
 Scully leaves The Smoking Man and gives the disc to The Lone Gunmen to analyze , but it turns out that The Smoking Man swapped the disc for a blank one . She goes back to his office but it has been emptied . Mulder informs her that this was a con and she was used to retrieve this information , but he does not understand why The Smoking Man left Scully alive . The final scene shows The Smoking Man throwing the real disc into a lake .

 " En Ami " was written by William B. Davis , who portrayed The Smoking Man . The main theme of the episode is The Smoking Man 's desire to seduce Scully using an agenda she would understand , in this case medical knowledge . Davis approached series creator Chris Carter with his idea , who was intrigued . He assigned executive producer Frank Spotnitz to work with Davis and craft a full @-@ fledged script . The script went through many revisions ; several scenes were cut , including one that featured The Smoking Man teaching Scully how to water @-@ ski . Originally , Alex Krycek was in the script and an alliance between him and The Smoking Man was " integral to the storyline . " As the script was written , however , this element was eliminated . The first draft of the script was finished in four weeks . 
 Davis saw his character as a romantic hero . Carter and Spotnitz , however , did not want " Scully trusting this man she 's spent seven years hating " so easily . Eventually , the producers tweaked the script , adding " the reality of The X @-@ Files 's existing mythos and past character development " to ease the transition . Davis later noted , " I was basically happy with the way [ the episode ] turned out , despite the fact that there were many other ideas that I had that I did not get to see . My original conception of the story was that Cigarette @-@ Smoking Man was a much better actor at winning Scully 's affections and that Scully was less resistant to this attention to her . " Because The Smoking Man was able to manipulate Scully , Carter later referred to " En Ami " as " the creepiest episode of the year . " 
 Part of the inspiration for the episode came from the Shakespeare play Richard III , most notably , the interaction between Richard and Lady Anne . The biggest inspiration for the episode , however , came from the fact that Davis wished to have an episode wherein he would interact solely with Gillian Anderson . He later noted , " if they 're not going to give me a scene with Gillian , I 'll just have to write one myself . " The episode 's title , " En Ami , " translates from French into English as " as a friend . " The title also functions as a pun , reading phonetically as " enemy " in English . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Production and filming for the episode were rushed . The scene featuring The Smoking Man and Scully eating dinner at a restaurant was filmed on two different days : Anderson 's side of the scene was shot on one day and Davis ' side was shot on another . The short schedule resulted in some quick scene construction , most notably for the dock sequence near the end of the episode . A majority of the lake scenes were filmed at Lake Sherwood in California . A stunt actor , Danny <unk> , filled in for Anderson during the scenes that called for her to drive the motor boat . " En Ami " was directed by Rob Bowman and marked his last contribution to the show : " Artistically I felt like I couldn 't help any more , " he explained . 
 Originally , " En Ami " was supposed to air early in the seventh season , but the producers realized that placing the episode so close to the Mulder @-@ centric " The Sixth Extinction " / " Amor Fati " made character development problematic . Thus , the producers decided to move the episode near the middle of the season .

 " En Ami " first aired in the United States on March 19 , 2000 .

" The episode was later included on The X @-@ Files Mythology , Volume 3 – Colonization , a DVD collection that contains episodes involved with the alien Colonist 's plans to take over the earth . 
 Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five . The two praised the episode , writing , " The plot itself is all smoke ( ahem ) and mirrors , but that doesn 't really matter " and " Davis ' skills as both an actor and writer is [ … ] very moving . " Rich Rosell from DigitallyObsessed.com awarded the episode 4 out of 5 stars and wrote " Get out your flowcharts to try and keep things straight , as we get to learn a little more about Cigarette Smoking Man and his hijinks , in this ep written by ol ' smoky himself . Scully and CSM get some edgy moments together , as info is revealed about an extraterrestrial @-@ based cure for all human diseases . To further confuse things Black @-@ Haired Man from The X @-@ Files feature film shows up , but so do The Lone Gunmen , so all is not lost . " 
 Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a " B + " and wrote that " it mostly overcomes some significant script flaws " . He was critical of the fact that the script " requires Scully to be a lot more naive than she usually is " . Handlen wrote that , because the episode was not as believable as it could have been this far into the series , the reveal that The Smoking Man is using Scully is " more disappointing than shocking . " Despite these setbacks , he concluded that the episode is largely sound because of the performances of Davis and Anderson , as well as the fact that the entry allowed the audience to gain insight into The Smoking Man 's motives . Kenneth Silber from Space.com was not happy with the ambiguity of The Smoking Man , writing , " Perhaps unsurprisingly , the episode provides few answers . And the ending , with its high degree of ambiguity , provides little satisfaction . This reviewer , for one , is puzzled about both CSM 's physical condition and his state of mind . "

In 2013 it was discovered that at least two of his graphic novels ( Stale N Mate and Let 's Fucking Party ) contained text plagiarized from Benoît <unk> and Charles Bukowski . 
 LaBeouf played a bootlegger in John Hillcoat 's 2012 crime drama Lawless . In June 2012 , the Icelandic band Sigur Rós released a video for the song " <unk> <unk> " , starring LaBeouf , in which he appears nude . According to a press release for the band , the video depicts " a man and woman locked in a never @-@ ending cycle of addiction and desire " . In February 2013 , he pulled out of what would have been his Broadway debut , in Lyle Kessler 's play Orphans , citing " creative differences " with co @-@ star Alec Baldwin , though The New York Times and Baldwin himself maintain LaBeouf was fired . 
 LaBeouf co @-@ starred with Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman in David Ayer 's World War II @-@ set film , Fury ; filming began in September 2013 , and the movie was released in October 2014 . LaBeouf was singled out for praise for his role as Boyd " Bible " Swan . Peter Travers for Rolling Stone called him " outstanding " , whilst Joe Neumaier commented that " ... LaBeouf finally finds a role he can disappear into , without his image getting in the way . " Calvin Wilson for St. Louis Post Dispatch called it one of LaBeouf 's best performances . 
 In 2015 , LaBeouf starred in Sia 's music video for " Elastic Heart " along with Maddie Ziegler . He is also set to star as the lead role in the upcoming war @-@ thriller film Man Down directed by Dito Montiel alongside Gary Oldman and Kate Mara . 
 In 2015 LaBeouf appeared in a 31 @-@ minute video for Central Saint Martins , an Art School based in London titled # <unk> , in which LaBeouf reads transcripts that students sent to him . One of the transcripts depicts LaBeouf screaming the words " DO IT ! " at various points .

 In January 2014 , LaBeouf stated that his Twitter account was " meta @-@ modernist performance art ” , following a sequence of appropriated Twitter apologies and skywriting messages in response to revelations he had plagiarized the work of graphic novelist Daniel Clowes . Collaborating with British artist Luke Turner and Finnish performance artist <unk> <unk> Rönkkö , LaBeouf embarked upon a series of actions described by Dazed as " a multi @-@ platform meditation on celebrity and vulnerability " . 
 On February 9 , 2014 , LaBeouf caused controversy at the Berlin Film Festival by walking out of the press conference for <unk> , quoting the famous " seagulls " statement made by French footballer Eric Cantona : " When the seagulls follow the trawler , it is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea . " Later that night , he arrived at the red carpet wearing a brown paper bag over his head emblazoned with the words " I am not famous anymore " . 
 Two days later , LaBeouf , Rönkkö , and Turner staged a six @-@ day performance in a Los Angeles gallery entitled # IAMSORRY , in which LaBeouf sat wearing a tuxedo and the paper bag , silently crying in front of visitors . Attendees were allowed to enter one at a time , and invited to choose an item from a table of " implements " to take in with them , including a Transformers toy , an Indiana Jones whip , a bottle of Jack Daniel 's , a pair of pliers , a ukulele , a bowl full of hateful tweets directed at LaBeouf , and a copy of Clowes ' book The Death @-@ Ray . Time columnist Joel Stein , who spent three days waiting in line to see the performance , observed that LaBeouf " was immensely present " and that " he was whatever was projected upon him " , while Kate <unk> of The Daily Dot found the experience " genuinely disturbing " and " felt like I was further dehumanizing someone whose humanity I 'd discounted " . The Daily Beast 's Andrew Romano opined , " There was more going on in those few seconds than in a lot of contemporary art . LaBeouf 's look @-@ at @-@ me Internet penance ritual had become an actual moment between actual people . " The following November , in an email interview with Dazed Digital , LaBeouf said that a woman " stripped [ his ] clothing and proceeded to rape [ him ] " during the February performance . 
 The Guardian and Time both suggested that # IAMSORRY bore a resemblance to Marina Abramović 's The Artist is Present , although Abramović herself stated that " this is not the same work " , commenting that LaBeouf 's performance was " a pretty strong statement " and that she found it very interesting " that the Hollywood world wanted to go back to performance ... to be connected to [ the ] direct public , which , you know , being a Hollywood actor doesn 't permit you " . James Franco also voiced his support of LaBeouf , writing a New York Times article in which he called LaBeouf 's project " a worthy one " , describing it as a piece " in which a young man in a very public profession tries to reclaim his public persona " . During LaBeouf 's performance , Jerry O 'Connell parodied the project by opening his own art installation , # <unk> , right next door to the gallery in a stunt for the comedy video website Funny or Die . 
 On Presidents ' Day 2014 , the day after LaBeouf 's gallery performance ended , LaBeouf arranged for skywriting over Los Angeles to display the message " # <unk> " . This was in contrast to a similar skywriting message , " # <unk> " , which LaBeouf had made the previous month in reference to a cease and desist letter Clowes ' lawyer had sent him . 
 In May 2014 , LaBeouf took part in an exhibition at London 's Auto Italia South East with a performance entitled Meditation for <unk> , in which he jumped rope for an hour via a live Skype link . During the performance , LaBeouf invited the audience to take the ropes provided in the gallery and " join me on my quest to find my inner self " . Dazed reported that the performance 's attendees " all gave off an air of self @-@ consciousness that came not from watching themselves in a digital mirror , but from being under the gaze of someone who is usually — constantly — under the gaze of the public " . 
 During 2014 , LaBeouf gave lectures via Skype at the London College of Fashion , in which he read passages from Guy Debord 's 1967 Situationist work The Society of the Spectacle , and at <unk> University Nijmegen , where he presented a talk on <unk> . Turner 's 2011 <unk> Manifesto has also been credited to his collaborator LaBeouf , defining <unk> as " the mercurial condition between and beyond irony and sincerity , naivety and knowingness , relativism and truth , optimism and doubt , in pursuit of a plurality of disparate and elusive horizons " and concluding with a call to " go forth and oscillate " .

 = = = Relationships = = = 
 From 2004 to 2007 , LaBeouf dated China <unk> , whom he met on the set of The Greatest Game Ever Played . They broke up because he became too busy with his work to put any time into the relationship , and he described the break @-@ up as being like " rebuilding after a tornado . " He dated English actress and one @-@ time co @-@ star Carey Mulligan from August 2009 to October 2010 ; they were introduced by the film 's director , Oliver Stone , prior to filming and began dating shortly after . Of that relationship he said : " I still love her . I think she 's a fucking awesome person and an incredible actress . We 're still pals . I wouldn 't take any of it back , and I don 't think she would either . It just ran its course . " In the August 2011 issue of Details magazine , he acknowledged having had a relationship with actresses Isabel Lucas , while she was still dating Adrian Grenier , and Megan Fox , while she was still seeing her now @-@ husband Brian Austin Green .

 In February 2005 , LaBeouf was arrested by police in Los Angeles and charged with assault with a deadly weapon after threatening his neighbor by driving into his car . A bystander claimed that LaBeouf " lost his cool " after he had to wait to get access to his garage while the neighbor , who was blocking his path , chatted to his girlfriend . The onlooker said : " Shia began honking his horn and yelling at the guy , but the neighbor told him to wait a minute , and carried on talking to his girlfriend . Then Shia rammed his car into the back of the other guy 's car . Words were exchanged and Shia jumped out and threatened the neighbor . " LaBeouf allegedly appeared at his neighbor 's front door hours later , waving a kitchen knife . The two fought , someone called the police , and LaBeouf was led off in handcuffs . 
 Early in the morning of November 4 , 2007 , a security guard asked LaBeouf to leave a Chicago Walgreens , which the latter refused . LaBeouf was arrested for misdemeanor criminal trespassing . The criminal charges were dropped on December 12 , 2007 . 
 In March 2008 , police issued an arrest warrant for LaBeouf after he failed to make a court appearance , which had been in relation to a ticket he had received for unlawful smoking in Burbank , California , in February 2008 . When neither LaBeouf nor a lawyer appeared at the court at the 8 : 30 a.m. hearing , a $ 1000 bench warrant was issued for his arrest . However , the court commissioner in California recalled this warrant on March 19 , 2008 , after the actor 's attorney arrived a day late to plead not guilty on LaBeouf 's behalf , and a pre @-@ trial hearing was set for April 24 , 2008 . The charge was dismissed , after the actor paid a $ 500 fine . 
 During the early morning of July 27 , 2008 , LaBeouf was involved in a car crash at the intersection of La Brea Avenue and Fountain Avenue in Los Angeles . His Ford F @-@ 150 was hit from the side by a vehicle running a red light . LaBeouf 's hand was out of the window as he drove and , upon impact , the truck rolled onto his exposed left hand , crushing it . While responding to the accident , police officers smelled alcohol on LaBeouf 's breath . Because he refused a breathalyzer examination , authorities arrested LaBeouf at the scene for misdemeanor drunk driving , and his driver 's license was suspended for one year . Michael Bay , who at the time of the accident was working with LaBeouf in Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen , stated that LaBeouf had been drinking hours before the car accident and he had felt that , by the time the accident had occurred , the alcohol had worn off . LaBeouf had to undergo one of many hand surgeries immediately after the accident . His passenger , Isabel Lucas , and the driver and passenger in the other car all suffered only minor injuries . Due to severe damages from the accident , LaBeouf 's truck was totaled ; his father keeps the vehicle at his home as a memento . Two days later , a Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department spokesman announced that LaBeouf was not at fault in the accident , because the other driver had run the red light . LaBeouf returned to the set of the Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen and shooting resumed . In an interview two months later , LaBeouf described the car accident as being " eye @-@ opening and terrifying . " He said that , as a result of the injuries , he had screws and plates put in his left hand ; there is also scarring . A screw was placed in one of his knuckles , and he had a shaved piece of bone from his hip made into a bone for his finger . In April 2009 , he stated he had undergone three hand surgeries . He said that he would regain " probably about 80 @-@ something percent " use of his hand and , while he would be able to make a fist again , " there 's a knuckle [ I will ] never be able to move again . " In May 2010 , he said that he has " completely " regained movement in his fingers . In June 2011 , in an interview in Details magazine , he claimed that he and Lucas were " philandering around " before the accident occurred . 
 In the early hours of February 5 , 2011 , he was involved in an altercation with another patron at the Mad Bull 's Tavern bar in the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles , which resulted in the actor getting punched in the face . Both LaBeouf and the unnamed patron were placed in handcuffs and questioned by a Los Angeles Police Department officer but later released with no arrest being made . In 2014 , LaBeouf was banned from The Local Peasant restaurant in Sherman Oaks after urinating on the wall . 
 On June 26 , 2014 , LaBeouf was charged with disorderly conduct and criminal trespass at New York 's Studio 54 theater . He was reported to have been " acting disorderly , yelling and being loud " . He refused to leave the theater , where the musical Cabaret starring Alan Cumming was being performed , so the police were called . In the arrest report it was stated that LaBeouf spat at arresting officers . The report also details LaBeouf using a homophobic slur and swearing at arresting officers . He was arrested and held at the Midtown North police station to later appear in court . Following the incident , LaBeouf voluntarily began seeking outpatient treatment for alcoholism , becoming involved in a 12 @-@ step program . LaBeouf 's publicist stated ' He understands that these recent actions are a symptom of a larger health problem and he has taken the first of many necessary steps towards <unk> 
 = = = Plagiarism accusations = = = 
 On December 17 , 2013 , LaBeouf released his short film Howard <unk> to the Internet and shortly after several bloggers noted its close similarity to Justin M. Damiano , a 2007 comic by Ghost World creator Dan Clowes . Wired journalist Graeme McMillan noted at least three similarities in their article , one of which was that the opening monologue for the short and the comic were identical . LaBeouf would later remove the film and claim that he did not intend to copy Clowes but was instead " inspired " by him and " got lost in the creative process . " He followed this up with several apologies via Twitter writing , " In my excitement and naiveté as an amateur filmmaker , I got lost in the creative process and neglected to follow proper accreditation " , and " I deeply regret the manner in which these events have unfolded and want @ <unk> to know that I have a great respect for his work " . Clowes responded by saying " The first I ever heard of the film was this morning when someone sent me a link . I 've never spoken to or met Mr. LaBeouf ... I actually can 't imagine what was going through his mind . " LaBeouf was criticized over his apology , with some sites such as The A.V. Club noting that the apology itself appeared to have been lifted from a 2010 post on Yahoo ! Answers . 
 Since the initial discovery of the plagiarism of Clowe 's work , LaBeouf 's other work has come under scrutiny . News outlets reported that LaBeouf 's comic books , Let 's Fucking Party and Stale N Mate , had been plagiarized from Benoît <unk> 's The Little Girl and the Cigarette and Charles Bukowski 's Assault . 
 In January 2014 , LaBeouf spoke about the plagiarism accusations with Bleeding Cool writer Rich Johnston , where he stated that he saw copyright laws as too restrictive and that it did not allow for ideas to flow freely . LaBeouf later tweeted a description of his next project , Daniel Boring ( a reference to David Boring , another comic created by Clowes ) . The description of the project was also taken word @-@ for @-@ word from a description by Clowes of his comic . Clowes ' attorney , Michael Kump , has since sent a cease @-@ and @-@ desist letter to LaBeouf 's attorney , which LaBeouf posted on Twitter .

 In November 2014 , LaBeouf stated that a woman " stripped [ his ] clothing and proceeded to rape [ him ] " the previous February at his Los Angeles art installation # IAMSORRY . LaBeouf 's artist collaborators , <unk> <unk> Rönkkö and Luke Turner , stated that as soon as they were aware of the incident starting to occur , they " put a stop to it . " In response to Piers Morgan 's questions on Twitter as to why the woman was not detained , Turner stated that she ran out before it was clear precisely what had happened , and that the first priority had been to ensure everybody 's safety in the gallery . When later asked whether they regretted not having a code of conduct for participants during the exhibit , Turner said , " I don ’ t think you need a notice on the wall saying ' Do not murder the artist ' . " 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 In 2004 , LaBeouf contributed an essay to the book I Am Jewish , by Judea Pearl , in which LaBeouf stated that he has a " personal relationship with God that happens to work within the confines of Judaism " . He has described himself as Jewish , but declared in 2007 that religion had " never made sense " to him . However , in an interview published in Interview Magazine in October 2014 , LaBeouf stated " I found God doing Fury . I became a Christian man , and not in a fucking bullshit way – in a very real way . I could have just said the prayers that were on the page . But it was a real thing that really saved me " .

 = Samuel Hahnemann Monument = 
 The Samuel Hahnemann Monument , also known as Dr. Samuel Hahnemann , is a public artwork dedicated to Samuel Hahnemann , the founder of homeopathy . It is located on the east side of Scott Circle , a traffic circle in the northwest quadrant of Washington , D.C. The Classical Revival monument consists of an exedra designed by architect Julius Harder and a statue sculpted by Charles Henry Niehaus , whose works include the John Paul Jones Memorial in Washington , D.C. and several statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection . The monument is significant because Hahnemann is the first foreigner not associated with the American Revolution to be honored with a sculpture in Washington , D.C. 
 The monument was dedicated in 1900 following years of fundraising efforts by the American Institute of Homeopathy . Among the thousands of attendees at the dedication ceremony were prominent citizens including President William McKinley , Attorney General John W. Griggs , and General John Moulder Wilson . The monument was rededicated in 2000 and a restoration process was completed in 2011 . It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007 . The monument and surrounding lot are owned and maintained by the National Park Service , a federal agency of the Interior Department . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Samuel Hahnemann ( 1755 – 1843 ) was a German physician who created homeopathy , an alternative medicine system that is considered a pseudoscience . He studied chemistry and medicine at the University of Erlangen @-@ Nuremberg , earning a medical degree in 1779 . He was then appointed Surgeon @-@ in @-@ Chief at a hospital in Dresden and later served as superintendent of an insane asylum in <unk> . While serving on the faculty at Leipzig University , Hahnemann became disillusioned with standard medical procedures of the time , including over drugging and bleeding . He pursued what he considered " natural laws " of medicine , opposing <unk> and developed the " laws of <unk> " ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , meaning like is cured by like ) . His unorthodox views were controversial at the time , but Hahnemann continued to pursue his homeopathic studies and published several works , including The <unk> of the Healing Act ( 1810 ) , Materia Medica Para ( 1811 – 1821 ) , and The Chronic Diseases , Their Peculiar Nature and Their Homeopathic Cure ( 1828 ) . He is considered the greatest influence on the practice of homeopathy , which was very influential in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . 
 A monument honoring Hahnemann was first proposed in 1881 by physician James H. McClelland at a meeting of the Homeopathic Medical Society . It wasn 't until June 1892 at the 45th Session of the American Institute of Homeopathy ( AIH ) that the organization agreed to undertake the project . Members of the nation 's homeopathic community began raising funds , including the largest single donation of $ 4 @,@ 510 by physician Nancy T. Williams . The AIH was assisted in its endeavor by the National Sculpture Society , which formed a committee to select an artist and design . The committee consisted of sculptors George Edwin Bissell , Daniel Chester French , and Olin Levi Warner , and architects Thomas Hastings and Russell Sturgis . A design competition was held with 25 models submitted . They were displayed at the American Academy of the Fine Arts in New York City , the first time a public exhibition of competition models was held in the country . The committee unanimously selected the model submitted by Charles Henry Niehaus ( 1855 – 1935 ) . 
 Niehaus was a German @-@ American from Ohio who attended the Royal Academy in Munich . In 1881 , the Ohio state government commissioned him to create a statue of the recently assassinated President James A. Garfield . He moved to New York City in 1887 and opened a studio where his works included the pediments at the Appellate Division Courthouse of New York State and the doors of Trinity Church . Niehaus was best known for his portraiture work , including eight statues for the National Statuary Hall Collection in the United States Capitol and two works for the Thomas Jefferson Building 's Main Reading Room . His statue of John Paul Jones in Washington , D.C. is listed on the National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) . Niehaus created Hahnemann 's likeness by using a bust sculpted by David d 'Angers that is now housed in the Saint Jacques Hospital in Paris . 
 While funds were being raised for the monument , permission to install the structure in Washington , D.C. was a difficult and long process . Hahnemann was not an American and had never visited the country . Supporters of the monument lobbied members of Congress to support its erection , but President Grover Cleveland refused to sign the agreement . After the election of President William McKinley , supporters renewed their efforts and eventually won the support of many congressional members and the president . But in 1899 , a congressional vote to authorize the monument being placed in Washington , D.C. failed . Members such as Representative L. Irving Handy of Delaware argued that only individuals who had distinguished careers in the military or civil branches of the national government should be honored in the city . Supporters finally won approval of Congress on January 31 , 1900 , when members voted to approve the monument 's placement and appropriate $ 4 @,@ 000 for its foundation . Hahnemann became the first foreigner not associated with the American Revolution to be honored with a sculpture in Washington , D.C. The site selected for the monument was chosen by a committee created by Congress . The committee included McClelland , who first proposed the monument , Senator George P. Wetmore and General John Moulder Wilson . The committee chose a site on the east side of Scott Circle " by reason of its abundant opportunities to display to the best advantage the delicate lines which are features of the artist 's work . " The architect chosen to design the monument was Julius Harder of the firm Israel and Harder . The statue was founded by the Gorham Manufacturing Company and the contractor was the Maine & New Hampshire Granite Company . The total cost of the monument and its installation was around $ 75 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Dedication = = = 
 The dedication ceremony took place on June 21 , 1900 , during an AIH convention . Thousands of people , including hundreds of medical professionals , attended the elaborate ceremony at Scott Circle . In front of the monument were chairs for distinguished guests , including President McKinley and his wife , Ida , both supporters of homeopathy , Attorney General John W. Griggs , General Wilson , and District Commissioner Henry Brown Floyd MacFarland . Temporary scaffolding , adorned with flags and bunting , was built to shield these guests from the sun . When the president arrived , the Marine Band played " Hail to the Chief " . 
 Physician James Bayard Gregg Custis of Washington , D.C. presided over the event . His remarks included : " This monument is erected in the hope that from it , as a center , truth may be spread which will result in the lessening of suffering and the increased usefulness of mankind . " The invocation was provided by Presbyterian minister Benjamin Franklin Bittinger . McClelland , who served as chairman of the monument committee , gave a brief address and formally presented the monument to the AIH . The monument was then unveiled as the Marine Band played " My Country , ' Tis of Thee " . The president of the AIH , physician Charles E. Walton of Cincinnati , then presented the monument to the government on behalf of the organization 's members . He said , " Their labors make it possible , in this memorable year 1900 , which marks on the dial of time the dividing point of centuries , to rear in our nation 's capital this beautiful monument commemorating at once the genius of Samuel Hahnemann and the loyalty of his followers . " An ode by physician William Tod Helmuth of New York was read followed by acceptance of the monument by government representative Colonel Theodore A. Bingham . He said , " It is with great pleasure that I have the honor , as the government 's officer in charge of public buildings and grounds in the District of Columbia , to accept this monument on behalf of the government , and I assure you that every care will be taken for its preservation . " 
 The Marine Band then played " The Star @-@ Spangled Banner " followed by an address by Attorney General Griggs . He stated : " In the center of this park stands the statue of a great warrior , General Scott ; on the other side is a statue of a great statesman and orator , Daniel Webster . Here on this side , with great appropriateness , has been placed the statue of a scientist , a reformer , a good physician . There is , said he , but one test of worthiness , and that is that a man shall have wrought in unselfishness , in the interests of his country , of humanity and the world . It was the merit of Dr. Hahnemann , he said , that he exposed fallacy , uncovered truth and uncovered errors . " The ceremony concluded with the crowd giving three cheers for the president followed by the band playing music . Following the ceremony , the president invited around 1 @,@ 000 guests to the White House and received them in the state rooms . 
 = = = Later history = = = 
 On June 21 , 2000 , one hundred years after the original dedication , the AIH hosted " Homeopathy 2000 : Rededication and Celebration in Washington , D.C. " A rededication ceremony organized by homeopathic societies and other organizations was held with an Armed Forces Color Guard and music provided by the Marine Band Brass Quintet . It was during this ceremony that attendees realized the monument was in need of repair , including the crumbling mosaic above the statue . Physician Sandra M. Chase of the American Institute of Homeopathy Hahnemann Monument Preservation Committee organized a fundraising drive called the Hahnemann Monument Restoration Project . During the next few years , AIH members and the public raised over $ 30 @,@ 000 for repairs . Working with the National Park Service ( NPS ) , the committee hired conservator Judy Jacob to oversee the restoration . The process included the statue being evaluated and cleaned , the granite edifice being cleaned , the fountain basin and pedestal on the back of the monument being restored , and the brick in the surrounding plaza being relayed and leveled . A missing oak tree was also replaced and an informal pathway was covered . The completion of the restoration project was marked by an event at the monument site on September 16 , 2011 , with representatives from the NPS and AIH in attendance . 
 The monument was added to the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites on February 22 , 2007 , and the NRHP on October 11 , 2007 . It is also designated a contributing property to the Sixteenth Street Historic District , listed on the NRHP in 1978 . The monument and surrounding lot are owned and maintained by the NPS , a federal agency of the Interior Department .

 = Wendell Willkie = 
 Wendell Lewis Willkie ( born Lewis Wendell Willkie ; February 18 , 1892 – October 8 , 1944 ) was an American lawyer , corporate executive , and the 1940 Republican candidate for president . Willkie appealed to many convention delegates as the Republican field 's only interventionist : although the U.S. remained neutral prior to Pearl Harbor , he favored greater U.S. involvement in World War II to support Britain and other Allies . His Democratic opponent , incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt , won the 1940 election with roughly 55 % of the popular vote to Willkie 's roughly 45 % of the popular vote . Willkie lost the electoral college vote by a wide margin . 
 Willkie was born in Indiana in 1892 ; both his parents were lawyers , and he also became one . He served in World War I but was not sent to France until the final days of the war , and saw no action . Willkie settled in Akron , Ohio , where he was initially employed by Firestone , but left for a law firm , becoming one of the leaders of the Akron bar . Much of his work was representing electric utilities and in 1929 , Willkie accepted a job in New York City as counsel for Commonwealth & Southern Corporation ( C & S ) , a utility holding company . He was rapidly promoted , and became corporate president in 1933 . Roosevelt was sworn in as U.S. president soon after Willkie became head of C & S , and announced plans for a Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA ) that would supply power in competition with C & S. Between 1933 and 1939 , Willkie fought against the TVA before Congress , in the courts , and before the public . He was ultimately unsuccessful , but sold C & S 's property for a good price , and gained public esteem . 
 A longtime Democratic activist , Willkie changed his party registration to Republican in late 1939 . He did not run in the 1940 presidential primaries , but positioned himself as an acceptable choice for a deadlocked convention . He sought backing from uncommitted delegates , while his supporters , many youthful , enthusiastically promoted his candidacy . As Hitler rampaged through Western Europe in the spring of 1940 , many Republicans did not wish to nominate an isolationist like Thomas E. Dewey , and turned to Willkie , who was nominated on the sixth ballot over Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft . Willkie 's support for aid to Britain removed it as a major factor in his race against Roosevelt , and Willkie also backed the president on a peacetime draft . Both men took more isolationist positions in the final days of the race . Roosevelt won a third term , taking 38 of the 48 states . 
 After the election , Willkie made two wartime foreign trips as Roosevelt 's informal envoy , and as nominal leader of the Republican Party gave the president his full support . This angered many conservatives , especially as Willkie increasingly advocated liberal or internationalist causes . Willkie ran for the Republican nomination in 1944 , but bowed out after a disastrous showing in the Wisconsin primary in April . He and Roosevelt discussed the possibility of forming , after the war , a liberal political party , but Willkie died in October 1944 before the idea could bear fruit . Willkie is remembered for giving Roosevelt necessary political cover in 1940 , which allowed the president to aid Britain in her hour of need .

 Lewis Wendell Willkie was born in Elwood , Indiana on February 18 , 1892 , the son of Herman and Henrietta ( <unk> ) Willkie . Both of his parents were lawyers , his mother being one of the first women admitted to the Indiana bar . All four of his grandparents emigrated from Germany after being involved in the unsuccessful 1848 revolutions there . The <unk> initially settled in Kansas Territory but as they were abolitionists , they moved to Indiana after the territory was opened to slavery in the mid @-@ 1850s . Willkie was the fourth of six children , all intelligent , and learned skills during the nightly debates around the dinner table that would later serve him well . 
 Although given the first name Lewis , Willkie was known from childhood by his middle name . Herman Willkie , who had come from Prussia with his parents at age four , was intensely involved in progressive politics , and in 1896 took his sons to a torchlight procession for Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan , who had come to Elwood during his campaign . The Willkie boys had a sidewalk fight with Republican youths , and though the <unk> won their battle , Bryan did not , defeated by former Ohio governor William McKinley . When Bryan ran again in 1900 , he stayed overnight at the Willkie home , and the Democratic candidate for president became the first political hero for the boy who would later seek that office . 
 By the time Willkie reached age 14 and Elwood High School , his parents were concerned about a lack of discipline and a slight stoop , and sent him to Culver Military Academy for a summer in an attempt to correct both . Willkie began to shine as a student at high school , inspired by his English teacher ; one classmate said that Philip " Pat " Bing " fixed that boy up . He started preaching to Wendell to get to work and that kid went to town . " Faced with a set of athletic brothers — Edward became an Olympic wrestler — Willkie joined the football team but had little success ; he enjoyed the debate team more , but was several times disciplined for arguing with teachers . He was class president his final year , and president of the most prominent fraternity , but resigned from the latter when a sorority blackballed his girlfriend , Gwyneth Harry , as the daughter of immigrants . 
 During Willkie 's summer vacations from high school , he worked , often far from home . In 1909 , aged 17 , his journey took him from Aberdeen , South Dakota , where he rose from dishwasher to co @-@ owner of a flophouse , to Yellowstone National Park , where he was fired after losing control of the horses drawing a tourist stagecoach . Back in Elwood , Herman Willkie was representing striking workers at the local tin plate factory , and in August journeyed with Wendell to Chicago in an attempt to get liberal attorney Clarence Darrow to take over the representation . They found Darrow willing , but at too high a price for the union to meet ; Darrow told Wendell Willkie , " there is nothing unethical in being adequately compensated for advocating a cause in which you deeply believe . " 
 After graduation from Elwood High in January 1910 , Willkie enrolled at Indiana University in Bloomington . There , he became a student rebel , chewing tobacco , reading Marx , and petitioning the faculty to add a course on socialism to the curriculum . He also involved himself in campus politics , successfully managing the campaign of future Indiana governor Paul McNutt for student office , but when Willkie ran himself , he was defeated . He graduated in June 1913 , and to earn money for law school , taught high school history in Coffeyville , Kansas , coaching debaters and several sports teams . In November 1914 , he left his job there for one as a lab assistant in Puerto Rico arranged by his brother Fred . Wendell Willkie saw workers badly abused ; the experience deepened his commitment to social justice . 
 Willkie enrolled at Indiana School of Law in the fall of 1915 . He was a top student , and graduated with high honors in 1916 . At the commencement ceremony , with the state supreme court present , he gave a provocative speech criticizing his school . The faculty withheld his degree , but granted it after two days of intense debate . Willkie joined his parents ' law firm , but volunteered for the United States Army on April 2 , 1917 , the day President Woodrow Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war against Germany . An army clerk transposed his first two names ; with Willkie unwilling to invest the time to have the bureaucracy correct it , he kept his name as Wendell Lewis Willkie . Commissioned as a first lieutenant , Willkie was sent for artillery training , meaning he did not embark for France until September 1918 . In January of that year , he married Edith Wilk , a Rushville , Indiana librarian ; the couple had one son , Philip . The war ended before Willkie reached the front , and he spent his time defending soldiers who had slipped away for time in Paris against orders . He was recommended for promotion to captain , but was discharged in early 1919 before the paperwork went through .

 = = = Akron attorney and activist = = = 
 Discharged from the army , Willkie returned to Elwood . He considered a run for Congress as a Democrat , but was advised that the district was so Republican he would be unlikely to keep the seat even if he could win it , and his chances might be better in a more urban area . Herman Willkie wanted Wendell and Robert to rejoin the family law firm , but Henrietta was opposed , feeling that opportunities in Elwood were too limited for her sons . She got her way , and in May 1919 Wendell Willkie successfully applied for a job with the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company in Akron , Ohio as head of the legal office that advised workers on wills and other personal matters . He was soon bored there , and on the advice of his wife , left for a law firm despite an offer from Harvey Firestone to double his salary . Firestone told the departing lawyer that he would never amount to anything because he was a Democrat . 
 Willkie became active in the Akron Democratic Party , becoming prominent enough while still with Firestone to introduce the Democratic presidential nominee , Ohio Governor James M. Cox , when he came to town during the 1920 campaign . He was a delegate to the 1924 Democratic National Convention , and supported New York Governor Al Smith through the record 103 ballots , when the nomination fell to former West Virginia congressman John W. Davis . More important to Willkie , though , was a fight against the Ku Klux Klan , which had become powerful in much of the nation and in the Democratic Party , but he and other delegates were unsuccessful in their attempt to include a plank in the party platform condemning the Klan . He also backed a proposed plank in support of the League of Nations that ultimately failed . In 1925 , Willkie led a successful effort to oust Klan members on the Akron school board . 
 After leaving Firestone in 1920 , Willkie joined leading Akron law firm Mather & Nesbitt , which represented several local public utilities . Although he quickly gained a reputation as a leading trial lawyer , he was especially noted for presenting utility cases before the Ohio Public Utilities Commission . In 1925 , he became president of the Akron Bar Association . One of Willkie 's clients , Ohio Power & Light , was owned by New York @-@ based Commonwealth & Southern Corporation ( C & S ) , whose chairman , B.C. Cobb , noticed him . Cobb wrote to the senior partner of Willkie 's firm , " I think he is a comer and we should keep an eye on him . " In 1929 , Cobb offered Willkie a salary of $ 36 @,@ 000 to be corporate counsel to C & S , a job which would involve a move to New York , and Willkie accepted . 
 = = = Commonwealth & Southern executive = = = 
 Wendell and Edith Willkie moved to New York in October 1929 , only weeks before the Wall Street Crash of 1929 , and found an apartment overlooking Central Park . Initially intimidated by the size and anonymity of the big city , Wendell Willkie soon learned to love it . He attended the Broadway theatre , and read through ten newspapers each day . Willkie and his wife had little in common , and grew apart through the 1930s . He acquired a social life , and met <unk> Van Doren , the book review editor of the New York Herald Tribune who became a friend , and later his lover . Cultured , brilliant and well connected , Van Doren introduced him to new books , new ideas , and new circles of friends . Unlike Van Doren , Willkie was indiscreet about their relationship , and their affair was well known to the reporters covering him during his 1940 presidential campaign . None of them printed a word . 
 At C & S , Willkie rose rapidly under the eye of Cobb , impressing his superiors . Much of his work was outside New York City ; Willkie was brought in to help try important cases or aid in the preparation of major legal briefs . Cobb , a pioneer in the electricity transmission business , had presided over the 1929 merger of 165 utilities that made C & S the largest electric utility holding company in the country . He promoted Willkie over 50 junior executives , designating the younger man as his successor . In January 1933 , Willkie became president of C & S. 
 Willkie maintained his interest in politics , and was a delegate to the 1932 Democratic National Convention . Since the incumbent Republican president , Herbert Hoover , was widely blamed for the Depression that had followed the stock market crash , the nominee would have a good chance of becoming president . The major candidates were Smith ( the 1928 nominee ) , Smith 's successor as New York 's governor , Franklin D. Roosevelt , Speaker of the House John Nance Garner , and former Secretary of War Newton D. Baker sought the nomination . Willkie backed Baker , and was an assistant floor manager for his campaign . With a two @-@ thirds majority needed to gain the Democratic presidential nomination , Willkie and others tried to deadlock the convention in the hope that it would turn to Baker . Roosevelt was willing to swing his votes to Baker in the event of a stalemate , but this did not occur , as Governor Roosevelt gained the nomination on the fourth ballot . Willkie , although disappointed , backed Roosevelt , and donated $ 150 to his successful campaign . 
 = = = TVA battle = = = 
 Soon after taking office , President Roosevelt proposed legislation creating the Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA ) , a government agency with far @-@ reaching influence that promised to bring flood control and cheap electricity to the impoverished Tennessee Valley . However , the TVA would compete with existing private power companies in the area , including C & S subsidiaries . Willkie appeared before the House Military Affairs Committee on April 14 , 1933 . He approved of the ideas for development of the Tennessee Valley , but felt that the government role should be limited to selling power generated by dams . Although the House of Representatives passed a bill limiting the TVA 's powers , the Senate took the opposite stance , and the latter position prevailed . 
 Negotiations took place though the remainder of 1933 for C & S to sell assets , including a transmission line , to allow the TVA to distribute energy to retail customers , leading to an agreement on January 4 , 1934 . TVA head David Lilienthal was impressed by Willkie , who left him " somewhat overwhelmed " and " pretty badly scared " . C & S agreed to sell some of its properties in part of the Tennessee Valley , and the government agreed that the TVA would not compete with C & S in many areas . In October 1934 , holders of securities issued by a C & S subsidiary filed suit to block the transfer . Willkie angrily denied that he had prompted the lawsuit , though plaintiffs ' counsel proved later to have been paid by the Edison Electric Institute , of which Willkie was a board member . Willkie warned that New York capital might avoid Tennessee if the TVA experiment continued , and when Roosevelt gave a speech in praise of the agency , issued a statement rebutting him . By 1934 , Willkie had become the spokesman for the private electric power industry . 
 Amid this tension , Willkie and Roosevelt met for the first time , at the White House on December 13 , 1934 . The meeting was outwardly cordial , but each man told his own version of what occurred : the president boasted of having <unk> Willkie , while the executive sent a soon @-@ to @-@ be @-@ famous telegram to his wife : " <unk> <unk> ... I <unk> <unk> HIM WHAT YOU THINK OF HIM " Roosevelt decided that the utility holding companies had to be broken up , so stated in his 1935 State of the Union address and met with Willkie later in January to inform him of his intent . In the meantime , the companies did their best to sabotage the TVA ; farmers were told by corporate representatives that lines from the new Norris Dam could not carry enough power to make a light bulb glow , and the company ran " spite lines " that might not even carry power in an effort to invoke the non @-@ compete agreement over broad areas . 
 Through 1935 , as the breakup legislation wound through Congress , and litigation through the courts , Willkie was the industry 's chief spokesman and lobbyist . When the Senate narrowly passed a bill for the breakup , Willkie made a series of speeches asking the public to oppose the legislation , and a storm of letters to congressmen followed . After the House of Representatives defeated the breakup clause , investigation proved that many of these communications were funded by the electric companies , signed with names taken from the telephone book , though Willkie was not implicated . Amid public anger , Roosevelt forced through a bill requiring the breakup to take place within three years . 
 In September 1936 , Roosevelt and Willkie met again at the White House , and a truce followed as both sides waited to see if Roosevelt would be re @-@ elected over the Republican , Kansas Governor Alf Landon . Willkie , who voted for Landon , expected a narrow victory for the Republican , but Roosevelt won an overwhelming landslide as Landon won only Maine and Vermont . In December , a federal district court judge granted the C & S companies an injunction against the TVA , and negotiations broke off by Roosevelt 's order as the litigation continued . Willkie took his case to the people , writing columns for major publications , and proposing terms for an agreement that The New York Times described as " sensible and realistic " . He received favorable press , and many invitations to speak . 
 The January 1938 Supreme Court ruling in Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes , resolving the 1934 case , and the lifting of the injunction by an appeals court , sent the parties back to the negotiating table . Willkie kept the public pressure on : like most corporate executives , he had not spoken out against Roosevelt 's New Deal policies , but in January stated in a radio debate that anti @-@ utility policies were depressing share prices , making it hard to attract investment that would help America to recover . " For several years now , we have been listening to a bedtime story , telling us that the men who hold office in Washington are , by their very positions , endowed with a special virtue . " The Saturday Evening Post dubbed Willkie " the man who talked back " . 
 Willkie and Lilienthal negotiated for a year , with Willkie wanting $ 88 million for C & S 's properties in and around the Tennessee Valley , and the TVA offering $ 55 million . After a final , January 1939 , legal defeat for C & S in the Supreme Court , the pace of the talks quickened , and on February 1 , 1939 , C & S sold the assets to the TVA for $ 78 @.@ 6 million . Securities and Exchange Commission chairman William O. Douglas deemed Willkie to have outsmarted Lilienthal . Though defeated in the courts , Willkie had gained national stature for driving a hard bargain for his shareholders , and was seen by some as a potential presidential candidate in 1940 . 
 = = 1940 presidential election = = 
 = = = Dark horse candidate = = = 
 The 1940 presidential campaign was conducted against the backdrop of World War II . Although the United States remained neutral , the nation — and especially the Republican Party — was deeply divided between isolationists , who felt the nation should avoid any steps that could lead America into the war , and interventionists , who felt that America 's survival depended upon helping the Allies defeat Nazi Germany . The three leading candidates for the 1940 Republican nomination were all isolationists to varying degrees : Senators Robert A. Taft of Ohio and Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan , and Thomas E. Dewey , the young ( 38 ) , " <unk> " Manhattan District Attorney . Roosevelt 's popularity had declined since the 1936 landslide , but many still hoped he would run for an unprecedented third term . He had long contemplated one , but made no announcement . Roosevelt 's decision @-@ making on this point is uncertain : as late as April 1940 , he may have been thinking of retirement . If he stepped aside , possible candidates included Vice President Garner , Secretary of State Cordell Hull and Postmaster General James A. Farley . 
 On the assumption Roosevelt would not seek a third term , Willkie had been spoken of as a possible Democratic presidential candidate as early as 1937 , but raised his stock considerably when on January 3 , 1938 , he debated Assistant Attorney General Robert H. Jackson on the radio show , Town Meeting of the Air . With the topic cooperation between the public and private sectors , Willkie came across as a businessman with a heart , while Jackson appeared dull . A stream of positive press mentions for Willkie continued through 1938 and into 1939 , culminating with a favorable cover story in Time magazine in July 1939 . Willkie was initially dismissive of the many letters he received urging him to run for president , but changed his mind . Van Doren thought Willkie could be president , and worked to persuade her contacts . After hosting the <unk> for a weekend , Fortune magazine managing editor Russell Davenport became convinced Wendell Willkie had presidential timber ; he devoted the magazine 's April 1940 issue to Willkie , and later served as his campaign manager . In that issue , Willkie wrote an article , " We The People : A Foundation for a Political Platform for Recovery , " urging both major parties to omit anti @-@ business policies from their party platforms , protect individual rights , and oppose foreign aggression while supporting world trade . This piece won him applause and supporters from the press . 
 Willkie never had any doubt that Roosevelt would run for a third term , and that his route to the White House would have to be through the Republican Party . In late 1939 he changed his registration from Democratic to Republican , and early in 1940 announced that he would accept the Republican nomination if it were offered to him . He blamed his allegiance shift on the Roosevelt policies that he deemed anti @-@ business . He had voted for Landon in 1936 , he said , and he felt that the Democrats no longer represented the values he advocated . As he later characterized it , " I did not leave my party . My party left me . " 
 The start of the war in September 1939 alarmed many Americans , but the majority thought the U.S. should not get involved . Willkie spoke often about the threat to America and the need to aid Britain and other Allies . Willkie biographer Steve Neal wrote that the war " transformed Willkie from a big @-@ business critic of the New Deal into a champion of freedom . And it gave his candidacy new purpose . " Despite the chatter about Willkie , there were many who were skeptical about his chances should he seek the nomination . Kenneth F. Simpson , Republican National Committeeman from New York , initially thought the idea of a Willkie run to be silly . Indiana Senator James Watson stated that he did not mind if " the town whore " joined the church , but she should not lead the choir the first week . Willkie did not enter the Republican primaries , placing his hope in a deadlocked convention . His campaign was composed mostly of political amateurs . New York lawyer Orem Root , Jr . ( grandnephew of former Secretary of State Elihu Root ) formed a network of local Willkie Clubs , which attracted a large membership among Republicans discontented with their leadership and seeking a new figure who might beat Roosevelt . He especially appealed to liberal , Eastern Establishment Republicans who saw none of the declared candidates to their liking . His rumpled suits , country @-@ style haircut , and Indiana twang carried reminders of ordinary midwesterners , something which led to some mocking as the efforts to nominate him became more obvious : Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes mocked that Willkie was " a simple , barefoot Wall Street lawyer " . Alice Roosevelt Longworth stated that the Willkie campaign came " from the grass roots of ten thousand country clubs " . 
 Although Willkie entered no primaries , this did not greatly disadvantage him as most were " beauty contests " serving only to show voter preferences and not elect delegates . The primaries were governed by a complex set of unwritten rules about who would enter which primary and Taft ran only in his native Ohio , where Dewey did not enter his name . Most delegates pledged to support a candidate had no strong attachment : what was important to most Republicans was to field a nominee who could beat Roosevelt . The run @-@ up to the June convention in Philadelphia coincided with Hitler 's advance in Western Europe , and delegates had second thoughts about running an isolationist , let alone a young one without national experience such as Dewey . Willkie , who had spoken out against isolationism , and who was a successful executive , was an attractive possibility . Willkie made speeches widely , including in a tour of New England that paid off with promises of support , though delegates might first support a favorite son candidate for a ballot or two . Important converts to Willkie 's cause included Minnesota Governor Harold Stassen and Massachusetts Governor Leverett Saltonstall . The move to Willkie was reflected in polls ; he went from 3 to 29 percent in the seven weeks before the convention , while Dewey , the frontrunner , fell from 67 to 47 percent . 
 = = = Convention = = = 
 The 1940 Republican National Convention opened at the Philadelphia Civic Center on June 24 , 1940 . As the delegates assembled , they discussed the war , the candidates , and Roosevelt 's appointment of two Republican interventionists to his cabinet four days before the convention . Henry L. Stimson , Secretary of War under President Taft and of State under Hoover , was restored to the War position , and Landon 's 1936 running mate , Frank Knox , was appointed Navy Secretary . The cabinet appointments divided the Republicans , who accused Roosevelt of dirty politics . 
 Willkie arrived by train in Philadelphia on June 22 , two days before the convention , and immediately attracted attention by walking from 30th Street Station to his hotel , answering questions from reporters and anyone else who could get close enough to be heard . Dewey , Vandenberg and Taft had large public headquarters , but Willkie 's campaign was run from clandestine rooms at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel . Root 's Willkie Clubs and other supporters bombarded the delegates with telegrams urging support for their candidate , to the annoyance of some . Key convention officials were Willkie supporters ; these included House Minority Leader Joe Martin , Massachusetts ' favorite son and permanent chairman of the convention . When the head of the Committee on Arrangements , Ralph Williams ( deemed likely to support Taft ) died just before the convention , he was succeeded by the vice chairman , Sam Pryor , a firm Willkie backer . This placed a Willkie supporter in charge of tickets for the public galleries . 
 The opening night of the convention saw the keynote speech by Governor Stassen ; he subsequently announced his support for Willkie and became one of the candidate 's floor managers . The second night featured a speech by the only living former president , Herbert Hoover , who hoped to stampede the convention to a third nomination . His address went almost unheard in the hall because of problems with the sound system . In the meantime , the Dewey campaign , faced with the German announcement that with France taken , Hitler 's forces would sail on Britain , did its best to stem the flow of delegates to Willkie . Negotiations among Dewey , Taft , and Vandenberg came to nothing as none was willing to accept less than the presidential nomination . A blaze of publicity followed Willkie wherever he went , as he caucused with delegates and appeared at press conferences with supporters , including the entire Connecticut delegation . A strong minority of African Americans still supported the Republicans , and Willkie met with a group of them , urging those delegates to visit him in the White House in 1941 . 
 Indiana Congressman Charles Halleck gave the nominating speech for Willkie on the evening of June 26 , arguing that Willkie 's recent conversion to the Republican Party was no reason not to nominate him , " is the Republican Party a closed corporation ? Do you have to be born into it ? " When Halleck mentioned Willkie 's name , there were initially boos from some delegates , but they were quickly drowned out by those in the public balconies , who thunderously chanted , " We want Willkie ! " . Pryor had cut ticket allocations to delegations that were not for Willkie , and distributed thousands of standing room passes to Willkie partisans . The vocal support for Willkie among spectators led to complaints that other campaigns had been shorted in the distribution of tickets , but provided one of the convention 's most dramatic moments . 
 Dewey had predicted he would have 400 of the 501 votes needed to nominate on the first ballot and kept nothing in reserve so that he might show momentum in future ballots . When delegates first balloted on the afternoon of June 27 , he had only 360 to 189 for Taft , 105 for Willkie , and 76 for Vandenberg . On the second ballot , Dewey began to slip , falling to 338 to Taft 's 203 and 171 for Willkie . The losses greatly damaged Dewey 's campaign , as other than the trivial losses suffered in the early rounds of balloting by Warren G. Harding in 1920 , no Republican candidate had ever lost support from the previous ballot and won the nomination . Dewey came under pressure from his advisors to withdraw during the dinner break that followed the second ballot , and when the convention resumed to chants of " We want Willkie ! " from the packed galleries , Dewey continued to slip as the convention became a two @-@ horse race between Taft and Willkie . Listening by radio from his hotel room , Willkie refused to make a deal to get support from Taft delegates in exchange for making the Ohioan his running mate , and became convinced he would lose on the fifth ballot . Dewey had planned to go to the convention and withdraw , hoping to stop Willkie by endorsing Taft , but by the time he decided this , the fifth ballot was about to begin and he could not get to the Civic Center in time . Willkie led with 429 delegates after the fifth ballot , while Taft held 377 and Dewey only 57 . The large states whose votes still were not committed to one of the two leaders were Pennsylvania ( Governor Arthur James was the favorite son ) and Michigan , most of whose delegates stayed with Senator Vandenberg . Although Willkie had refrained from making deals to this point , to get Michigan , he agreed to allow the Republican organization there to pick that state 's federal judges . The sixth ballot , held at 12 : 20 am on June 28 , saw Taft , then Willkie take the lead . As those in the gallery continued to call for Willkie , Vandenberg released his delegates , most of whom went to Willkie . Pennsylvania also broke for him , making Willkie the Republican nominee for president on a vote that was made unanimous . 
 Willkie had offered the vice presidential nomination to Connecticut Governor Raymond Baldwin , a key supporter , but scuttled those plans after his advisors and Republican officials felt that a New York @-@ Connecticut ticket would not give sufficient geographic balance . They urged Willkie to select the Senate Minority Leader , Oregon 's Charles McNary . A lawyer , advocate of public power , and farmer , McNary was popular and respected in the West . Willkie agreed , and got Baldwin to withdraw as others persuaded McNary , who had called Willkie a tool of Wall Street after arriving in Philadelphia . The convention dutifully nominated McNary . Before departing Philadelphia , Willkie went to the Civic Center to appear before the delegates who had chosen him , becoming the first Republican nominee to speak to the convention after gaining its endorsement : 
 Democracy and our way of life is facing the most crucial test it has ever faced in all its long history ; and we here are not Republicans , alone , but Americans , to dedicate ourselves to the democratic way of life in the United States because here stands the last firm , untouched foothold of freedom in all the world .

 After the convention , Willkie returned to New York . When he went to the movies , he received a standing ovation , as he did when he went to see the play Life With Father . He resigned from C & S on July 8 , 1940 , confident that even if he lost his presidential bid , he would not lack for work . He had Republican National Committee ( RNC ) chairman John Hamilton dismissed on the advice of some of his advisors , who felt Hamilton was too conservative and isolationist , though the former chairman was given the post of executive director with partial responsibility for the Willkie campaign . Congressman Martin became RNC chair . At a time when little campaigning was done until after Labor Day , Willkie left on a five @-@ week working vacation to The Broadmoor , a resort in Colorado Springs , but found neither peace nor privacy . 
 Roosevelt had been surprised by the outcome of the Republican convention , having expected to oppose a conservative isolationist . The polls showed Willkie behind by only six points , and the president expected this to be a more difficult race than he had faced in his defeats of Hoover and Landon . Roosevelt felt that Willkie 's nomination would remove the war issue from the campaign . Roosevelt was nominated by the Democratic convention at Chicago in July , though he stated that because of the world crisis , he would not actively campaign , leaving that to surrogates . The fact that both major @-@ party presidential candidates favored intervention frustrated isolationists , who considered wooing Charles Lindbergh as a third party candidate . 
 Willkie formally accepted the nomination at Elwood on August 17 before a crowd of at least 150 @,@ 000 , the largest political gathering in the United States to that point . It was an extremely hot day , and Willkie , who tried to read his speech from a typed manuscript without enlargement , failed to ignite the crowd . He remained in Rushville , where he owned farmland , over the next month , trying to become more associated with his native state than with Wall Street . He gave interviews to reporters there , and his firm support for Roosevelt 's aid for the Allies led Congressman Martin and Senator McNary to support a peacetime draft despite the strident objections of many Republicans and some Democrats . Roosevelt contacted Willkie through intermediaries to ensure that the Republican candidate would not make a political issue out of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement ; Willkie was supportive of the transfer , though he felt Congress should act , and opposed Roosevelt sending armaments to Britain by executive order . 
 Conservatives and isolationists had little enthusiasm for the Willkie campaign , and the moderates wanted to see stronger positions on progressive issues and foreign policy . Publisher Henry Luce decried both Roosevelt and Willkie for failing to be honest with the American people , " America will never be ready for any war until she makes her mind up there is going to be a war . " ( italics in original ) Despite his pledge not to campaign , Roosevelt made inspection tours to military installations , well covered by the press . The president did not mention Willkie by name , seeking to avoid giving the Republican publicity . According to Susan Dunn in her book in the 1940 campaign , this forced Willkie " to box against a phantom opponent and carry on a one @-@ sided partisan debate ... Even in Willkie 's speeches , Roosevelt occupied center stage " . Willkie promised to keep intact New Deal social welfare programs , expand Social Security , and provide full employment , a job for everyone : " I pledge a new world " . 
 On September 12 , Willkie began a whistle @-@ stop tour by train , and between then and November 2 , he reached 31 of the 48 states . He did not visit the Solid South , though he spoke in Texas , hoping to win it as Hoover had in 1928 . Willkie filled the Los Angeles Coliseum with 70 @,@ 000 middle @-@ class supporters , but reporters saw few working @-@ class people at his rallies , and he cancelled some appearances at auto plants in the Midwest . Other people in working @-@ class areas booed the candidate , held up signs in support of Roosevelt , or pelted his motorcade with overripe fruit . Although Edith Willkie accompanied her husband on his tour ( he had little time for contact with Van Doren ) , she disliked the media attention and did not give interviews , completing the campaign without ever giving a speech . On one occasion , she looked at her husband and stated , " Politics makes strange bedfellows " . The Democrats knew of Willkie 's affair with Van Doren , but the Republicans had letters from Henry A. Wallace , the Democratic vice presidential nominee , to his former guru , Russian mystic Nicholas Roerich , and neither issue became a factor in the campaign . 
 With polls released on October 6 showing Roosevelt well ahead , Willkie began to sound an isolationist theme , accusing Roosevelt of being a warmonger . Many of Willkie 's speeches to that point had been on domestic issues , but he had been advised by Martin , Hamilton , and other advisors that the war was the issue the voters really cared about . Willkie began to argue that Roosevelt would not keep the U.S. out of war , but that he would . He was given room to make this argument by the United Kingdom 's increasing success in the Battle of Britain , as it was clear a German invasion was not imminent . The polls showed voters responding positively to this new tack , and Willkie kept on this course for the remainder of the campaign . Roosevelt reacted by scheduling five speeches for the final days , in which he proposed to rebut Willkie 's " <unk> " . The president stated , " I have said again and again and again that your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars . " Willkie was prone to ad lib remarks , which sometimes led to gaffes : addressing steelworkers , he pledged to appoint a new Secretary of Labor , " and it will not be a woman either " . This allusion to Secretary Frances Perkins , the only woman to hold a cabinet position in American history to that point , did not aid him among female voters . 
 Willkie concluded his campaign on November 2 with a large rally at New York 's Madison Square Garden . Polls showed him four points behind Roosevelt , but with a trend towards the Republicans . Many pundits expected a tight race . On Election Day , November 5 , 1940 , the early returns were encouraging , but quickly turned against Willkie . By 11 pm , radio commentators were reporting that Roosevelt had won a third term . Willkie received 45 percent of the popular vote to Roosevelt 's 55 percent . The president received 27 @.@ 2 million votes to Willkie 's 22 @.@ 3 million , and won 449 to 82 in the Electoral College . Willkie won 10 states to the president 's 38 though he did better than Hoover and Landon had against Roosevelt . Willkie 's popular vote total of 22 @,@ 348 @,@ 480 set a record for a Republican not broken until Eisenhower in 1952 . 
 The endorsement of CIO head John L. Lewis probably gave Willkie Michigan , and he gained ground in the suburbs and rural areas , but Roosevelt consolidated his 1936 coalition of working @-@ class Americans , minorities , and Southerners to take the election . On the evening of November 11 , Willkie gave a nationwide radio address , urging those who had voted for him not to oppose Roosevelt on all issues , but to give support where it was called for . In late November , Willkie interrupted a Florida vacation for a speech he concluded by offering a toast " to the health and happiness of the President of the United States " ; Roosevelt confided to his son James : " I 'm happy I 've won , but I 'm sorry Wendell lost " .

 Although defeated in the election , Willkie had become a major figure on the public scene , and at age 48 , was deemed likely to remain one for years to come . Landon had received some 6 @,@ 000 letters <unk> with him in his defeat ; Willkie received over 100 @,@ 000 . Financially independent , he was in no hurry to decide among the many offers of employment from top law firms and major corporations . He resumed his affair with Van Doren . 
 While on vacation , Willkie decided his next cause should be military aid to embattled Britain , and announced his support for the president 's Lend @-@ Lease program on January 13 , 1941 . Lend @-@ Lease was highly unpopular in the Republican Party , and Willkie 's announcement created a firestorm , with Landon and Taft decrying his actions . Former RNC chairman Hamilton wrote that of the almost 200 Republican members of the House and Senate , " Willkie couldn 't dig up ten friends if his life depended on it . " 
 Roosevelt , both appreciating Willkie 's talents , and seeking to divide and conquer his opposition , had been mulling over ways his former opponent might be of use . The president 's onetime advisor , Justice Felix Frankfurter , had suggested to Van Doren on New Year 's Eve that Willkie should travel across the Atlantic to demonstrate bipartisan support for Britain . Willkie had already been planning a visit in support of Britain . Roosevelt believed that the visit of the nominal head of the opposition party would be far more effective in demonstrating American support than sending one of his advisors . 
 Willkie visited the president at the White House for the first time as an ally on January 19 , 1941 , the evening before Roosevelt 's third swearing @-@ in . The president asked Willkie to be his informal personal representative to Britain , and Willkie accepted . Eleanor Roosevelt recorded that family members and White House staff found excuses to observe Willkie , and she would have done so herself had she been aware of the visit as it was happening . Roosevelt urged Willkie to see W. Averell Harriman and Harry Hopkins , both in London on missions from Roosevelt , and gave his former rival a letter to be hand @-@ delivered to the British prime minister , Winston Churchill . At this time it was not routine for politicians to travel abroad ; McNary , with considerable influence in foreign affairs , had never left North America . Thus , there was much public attention on Willkie 's mission . He departed from New York Municipal Field for London on January 22 . 
 Upon arrival , Willkie told the press , " I want to do all I can to get the United States to give England the utmost aid possible in her struggle " . Willkie saw the damage Nazi bombing had inflicted on Britain , visiting bombed @-@ out sites in London , Birmingham , Coventry , Manchester and Liverpool . In London during the Blitz , he walked the streets at night without helmet or gas mask ( until Churchill gave him some ) , visiting bomb shelters . Churchill hosted Willkie at an official luncheon at 10 Downing Street and had him as a guest at Chequers . In his writings , Churchill recalled " a long talk with this most able and forceful man " . 
 Although it was cut short by Roosevelt 's desire to have him testify before Congress on Lend @-@ Lease , Willkie 's visit to Britain was deemed a triumph . Willkie also went to Ireland , hoping to persuade Éamon de Valera to abandon neutrality , but his urging was unavailing . Willkie left London for Washington on February 5 ; because of the risk of being shot down by Nazi aircraft , the roundabout journey home took four days . He testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 11 , and his support was key to passing Lend @-@ Lease . 
 Willkie 's Senate testimony made him the leading interventionist outside the government , with Lindbergh ( who had testified against Lend @-@ Lease ) the leading isolationist , and they debated in the pages of magazines . Roosevelt weighed in , backing his former opponent in a radio address on March 29 . " The leader of the Republican Party himself — Mr. Wendell Willkie — in word and in action is showing what patriotic Americans mean by rising above partisanship and rallying to the common cause . " That same month , a Gallup poll showed that 60 percent of Americans believed Willkie would have made a good president . 
 In April 1941 , Willkie joined the New York law firm of Miller , Boston , and Owen as senior partner , with the firm changing its name to Willkie , Owen , Otis , Farr , and Gallagher . Two months later , he agreed to represent motion picture producers before a Senate subcommittee which was investigating claims that Hollywood was producing pro @-@ war propaganda . Willkie defended the rights of the studios to make films that reflected their views , and warned , " the rights of the individuals mean nothing if freedom of speech and freedom of the press are destroyed . " Congress took no further action . 
 In the fall of 1941 , Willkie fought for the repeal of the Neutrality Act . In September , Lindbergh accused American Jews of " agitating for war " ; Willkie responded that the aviator 's speech was " the most un @-@ American made in my time " . Willkie lobbied Republican congressmen to repeal the act . The measure passed Congress with the aid of Republican votes , though most of that party voted against . Roosevelt invited Willkie to dedicate Mount Rushmore , but because of other commitments , Willkie could not . Roosevelt also sought to have Willkie join his administration , which the Republican was reluctant to do , wishing to preserve independence of word and action . 
 = = = Wartime advocate = = = 
 After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , Willkie offered his full support to Roosevelt . Willkie was interested in the post of war production czar , but that position went to Donald M. Nelson . Labor Secretary Perkins offered to have Willkie arbitrate between management and labor in war industries , but Willkie declined after White House officials informed the press . In the spring of 1942 , Willkie considered a run for Governor of New York . He later stated that Roosevelt had been willing to endorse him , but Willkie ultimately concluded that the Dewey forces were too strong and a defeat might eliminate him from a possible run for president in 1944 . In July , Willkie proposed to Roosevelt that he go on another foreign mission , and the following month Willkie announced that he would be visiting the Soviet Union , China , and the Middle East . Dewey wrote , " I hear he is going to Russia before the Republican [ state ] convention , so he will be where he belongs and I hope he stays there until Christmas " . 
 According to Dunn , Willkie 's mission was to be Roosevelt 's personal representative , " demonstrating American unity , gathering information , and discussing with key heads of state plans of the postwar future " . After leaving the U.S. on August 26 , Willkie 's first stop was North Africa , where he met General Montgomery and toured the front at El Alamein . In Beirut , he stayed with General de Gaulle , leader of the Free French . In Jerusalem , Willkie met with Jews and Arabs , told the British ruling Palestine that both peoples should be brought into the government , and later wrote that the conflict there was so ancient , it was unrealistic to think it could " be solved by good will and simple honesty " . Willkie had been moved to add the Soviet Union to his itinerary when three Western reporters there urged him by telegram to do so . There , he met with Stalin , and on his return advocated more liberal Lend @-@ Lease terms for the USSR . In China , Willkie was hosted by Chiang Kai @-@ Shek and was fascinated by Madame Chiang . Willkie was taken to the front against the Japanese , and spoke out against colonialism , in China and elsewhere . His statements were reported widely in Britain , angering Churchill , who responded , " We mean to hold our own . I have not become the King 's First Minister in order to preside over the liquidation of the British Empire . " 
 While in the USSR , Willkie urged the opening of a second front against the Germans ; when reporters asked Roosevelt about those comments , the president responded flippantly that he had read the headlines but had not considered the speculative comments worth the reading . This angered Willkie , and on his return from his 49 @-@ day trip , he confronted Roosevelt about it when making his report at the White House . 
 On October 26 , 1942 , Willkie made a " Report to the People " , telling Americans about his trip in a radio speech heard by about 36 million people . The following April , he published One World , a book Van Doren edited , in which he recounted his travels and urged that America join a worldwide organization after the war was successfully concluded . The book was an immediate bestseller , selling a million copies in its first month . It was especially influential as Willkie was seen by many as having transcended partisan politics . 
 = = = Civil rights activist = = = 
 During his 1940 campaign , Willkie had pledged to integrate the civil service and armed forces , and proudly pointed to what he deemed the strongest civil rights plank in history in the Republican platform . He also promised to end segregation in Washington , D.C. He gained the endorsements of the two largest African American newspapers , the Pittsburgh Courier and Baltimore Afro @-@ American . With Willkie running to the left of Roosevelt on civil rights , Roosevelt feared that blacks would return to their traditional home in the Republican Party , and made several prominent promotions or hirings of African Americans . Roosevelt was successful in keeping the majority of the black vote . Willkie , after the election , promised to keep fighting for civil rights . 
 Willkie warned Republicans that only a full commitment to equal rights for minorities would woo African Americans back to the party , and criticized Roosevelt for yielding to Southern racists among the Democrats . Willkie addressed a convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) in 1942 , one of the most prominent politicians to do so to that point . He urged integration of the armed forces , and when a violent race riot broke out in Detroit in June 1943 , went on national radio to criticize both parties for ignoring race issues . When the movie hearings of 1941 ended without further action , Willkie had been made chairman of the board of Twentieth @-@ Century Fox . In 1943 , he worked with Walter White , executive secretary of the NAACP , to try to convince Hollywood to give blacks better treatment in film . Movie moguls promised changes , and some films featured blacks in major roles , but faced with objections from white Southerners , reverted after Willkie 's death in 1944 to giving blacks stereotyped roles , such as servants . After his death , the NAACP named its headquarters the Wendell Willkie Memorial Building . 
 On November 9 , 1942 , soon after making his reports to Roosevelt and the American people , Willkie argued the case of Schneiderman v. United States before the Supreme Court . William Schneiderman , secretary of the California Communist Party , was a naturalized American until the government revoked his citizenship , stating that he had concealed his membership on his application for naturalization in 1927 . Two lower federal courts upheld the <unk> . Representing a communist , and in wartime , did nothing to shore up Willkie 's diminishing support in the Republican Party , but he wrote to a friend , " I am sure I am right in representing Schneiderman . Of all the times when civil liberties should be defended , it is now . " Willkie in his argument quoted Lincoln and Jefferson that the people could , if they deemed it necessary , remake the government , and stated that Marx 's view of revolution was mild by comparison . In 1943 , the Supreme Court ruled for Schneiderman , 5 — 3 , restoring his citizenship . Although he refrained from criticizing Roosevelt 's internment of Japanese Americans , Willkie in a speech stated that war was no excuse for depriving groups of people of their rights . He spoke out against those who blamed the Jews for the war , warning against " witch @-@ hanging and mob @-@ baiting " . For his activities , he received the American Hebrew Medal for 1942 .

 Willkie spent much of 1943 preparing for a second presidential run , addressing Republican and nonpartisan groups . He did not meet with Roosevelt ; with the presidential election approaching and both men likely candidates , continued association would be awkward . Although they differed with him on many issues , Republican leaders recognized Willkie 's appeal and had wanted him to campaign for the party in the 1942 midterm elections , but he went around the world instead . The huge publicity received by the titular head of the Republican Party as an emissary for a Democratic president frustrated leading Republicans . In spite of this , the Republicans gained in both House and Senate , though still remaining in the minority . Few Republican members of Congress were by then willing to support Willkie , and he dropped to second place behind General Douglas MacArthur in polls of likely voters in the party 's 1944 presidential primaries . By 1943 , even liberal Democrats did not doubt Willkie 's progressive credentials . He spoke of appointing an African American to the cabinet or the Supreme Court , and warned California 's Republican committee that the New Deal was irreversible and all they would get by opposing it was oblivion . 
 Willkie made his candidacy clear in an interview with Look magazine in early October 1943 , arguing that a return to isolationism would lead the party to disaster . He decided to enter several presidential primaries to demonstrate public support , and chose Wisconsin , with a primary on April 4 , 1944 , as the first major test . Willkie had not taken Wisconsin 's electoral votes in 1940 , though he had won all parts of the state but Milwaukee . His advisors feared the large German @-@ American vote in Wisconsin , which had contributed to the state being firmly isolationist until Pearl Harbor . None of the other major candidates — Dewey , Stassen , MacArthur and Ohio Governor John Bricker — spoke in Wisconsin ; MacArthur and Stassen were on active duty and could not do so . Willkie stated that if he did badly in Wisconsin , he would end his campaign . 
 The New Hampshire primary had not taken on the significance it later would , and Willkie won it on March 14 , taking six of eleven delegates . This was deemed a disappointment as he had spoken there many times since 1940 , and was expected to do better . In Wisconsin , Willkie ran a slate of delegates led by future governor Vernon W. Thomson , and devoted two weeks to campaigning there . He was endorsed by most newspapers , but polls showed him well behind Dewey both in the state and nationwide . 
 On March 16 , his first day of campaigning in Wisconsin , Willkie made eight speeches , and the pace took a toll on his voice . The weather did not cooperate , and he travelled 200 miles ( 320 km ) through a blizzard to reach a rally in the northern part of the state . Willkie attracted large crowds in most places , and he told them the Republican party would fail unless it accepted the New Deal and recognized the need for the U.S. to remain active in the world after the war . The Democrats , he alleged , had been too long in office and did not have the vision needed for the postwar world . Willkie 's speech in Milwaukee attracted 4 @,@ 000 to a hall that could hold 6 @,@ 000 , and he left the state on the 29th for Nebraska , where he had also entered the primary . Once he was gone , Dewey 's backers , including most of the Wisconsin Republican leadership , flooded the state with billboard advertisements and radio commercials . On April 4 , Dewey gained 17 of Wisconsin 's 24 delegates , Stassen 4 , and MacArthur 3 . Willkie 's delegates ran last in every district . The following night , after giving his speech in Omaha , Willkie addressed the crowd : 
 I quite deliberately entered the Wisconsin primary to test whether the Republican voters of that state would support me ... It is obvious now that I cannot be nominated . I therefore am asking my friends to desist from any activity toward that end and not to present my name at the convention . I earnestly hope that the Republican convention will nominate a candidate and write a platform that really represents the views which I have advocated and which I believe are shared by millions of Americans . I shall continue to work for these principles and policies for which I have fought during the last five years . 
 = = Final months and death = = 
 Defeated in his second bid for the White House , Willkie announced he was returning to the practice of law , but his friends doubted he would be content there . Roosevelt was anxious to dump Vice President Wallace from the ticket in the president 's bid for a fourth term , and had an intermediary sound out Willkie about running in Wallace 's place . Willkie was reluctant even to respond , knowing Roosevelt had made promises to potential running mates he did not follow through on . There were further discussions between Willkie and the White House , of which third parties were aware though the details are not known ; the vice presidential nomination went to Harry S Truman . Willkie interested Roosevelt in a new liberal party to be formed once peace came that would combine the left of the two existing major parties , but Willkie broke off contact with the White House after there were leaks of this to the press , as he felt that Roosevelt had used him for political gain . Roosevelt sent a letter expressing his regret for the leak , but that too was printed in the papers , and Willkie stated , " I 've been lied to for the last time . " 
 In spite of their breach , Roosevelt continued to try to conciliate Willkie . Roosevelt 's son Elliott later stated that his father hoped to have Willkie be the first Secretary General of the United Nations , and the two men agreed to meet in the fall . Willkie had not been invited to speak at the 1944 Republican National Convention in Chicago that nominated Dewey for president , and declined a pass as an " honored guest " . Dewey hoped to get Willkie 's endorsement , and sent his foreign policy advisor , John Foster Dulles , to see Willkie . The former candidate refused to be drawn , and he made no endorsement before he died . Willkie wrote two articles for Collier 's , one urging an internationalist foreign policy , and the other demanding advances in civil rights for African Americans . He also explored becoming a newspaper publisher . 
 Willkie had long been careless of his health and diet , smoking heavily , and rarely exercising . His heavy drinking had charmed the reporters in Philadelphia in 1940 , but by 1944 it was becoming a problem . In August 1944 , Willkie felt weak while traveling by train to his Rushville home . There , he suffered a heart attack , but had to be persuaded to see a doctor and refused to be admitted to a hospital . 
 Willkie 's condition only worsened as the weeks went on . He went to New York by rail in mid @-@ September , but on the trip he was stricken again with a heart attack . Although his advisors told him to seek treatment and abandon the trip , Willkie pressed on . When he arrived in New York , Willkie was in great pain and his press secretary called an ambulance to take him to Lenox Hill Hospital . He recovered to some extent , enough so that his friends expected him to be discharged . He spent time working on the galleys of his second book , An American Program , and planned future projects . On October 4 , Willkie caught a throat infection , which was treated with penicillin . As he was recovering , Willkie 's now chronic heart attacks struck again and he suffered three more attacks on October 7 . The hospital , which had been issuing reassuring bulletins to the public , was now forced to inform the public that Willkie 's condition had worsened and that he was critically ill . The next morning , Willkie suffered one last attack which proved fatal . From the time he checked into Lenox Hill Hospital , he was said to have suffered over a dozen heart attacks . 
 Roosevelt released a statement applauding Willkie 's " tremendous courage " which " prompted him more than once to stand alone ... In this hour of grave crisis the nation loses a great citizen . " War Secretary Stimson offered burial in Arlington National Cemetery , but Edith Willkie wanted her husband to be buried in his native Indiana , at Rushville . His casket was placed in the center aisle of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church ; 60 @,@ 000 people filed by his casket , and 35 @,@ 000 crowded around the church during the service , including many blacks — as , Eleanor Roosevelt noted in her column , was fitting . Wendell and Edith Willkie rest together in Rushville 's East Hill Cemetery , the gravesite marked by a cross , and a book carved in stone , inscribed with quotations from One World . It was designed by sculptor Malvina Hoffman ( 1885 @-@ 1966 ) . 
 = = Legacy and remembrance = = 
 Soon after the 1940 convention , Roosevelt described Willkie 's nomination as a " <unk> to our country " , as it ensured the presidential race would not turn on the issue of aid to Britain . Walter Lippmann believed Willkie 's nomination to have been crucial to Britain 's survival , " second only to the Battle of Britain , the sudden rise and nomination of Willkie was the decisive event , perhaps providential , which made it possible to rally the free world when [ Britain ] was almost conquered . Under any other leadership but his the Republican party in 1940 would have turned its back on Great Britain , causing all who resisted Hitler to feel abandoned " . Charles Peters wrote that " it is arguable that [ Willkie 's ] impact on [ the United States ] and the world was greater than that of most men who actually held the office [ of president ] . At a crucial moment in history , he stood for the right things at the right time . " When Georgia Senator Zell Miller , a Democrat , gave the keynote address at the 2004 Republican National Convention , he urged unity instead of partisan strife in the War on Terror , and recalled Willkie 's actions , " He gave Roosevelt the critical support he needed for a peacetime draft , an unpopular idea at the time . And he made it clear that he would rather lose the election than make national security a partisan campaign issue . " 
 Historian Hugh Ross argued that in gaining the nomination , Willkie " gave exceptional promise of being a winner . There were ample precedents from American political history in which a minority party , queasy over prospects for survival , bypassed professional leadership to entrust its political fortunes to a man without political experience . In most of the previous instances , the nomination had gone to a military man . In 1940 , it went to a businessman . " Richard Moe , in his book on the 1940 election , suggested that the nomination of Willkie left long @-@ lasting scars on the Republican Party , with conservatives angered by the success of the Eastern Establishment wing of the party , " whatever else it did , Philadelphia gave birth to the bitter proprietary division within the Republican Party , one accentuated by ideology and geography , that would define the party for decades to come . " Among those converted from isolationism by Willkie 's oratory , and who worked intensely on the Willkie campaign in Michigan , was Gerald R. Ford , who wrote many years later in his memoirs , " I now realize that my participation did not make much difference at all to the political fate of Wendell Willkie . But it made a lot of difference to me . " 
 Correspondent and author Warren Moscow wrote that after 1940 , Willkie helped Roosevelt , who was always careful not to go too far in front of public opinion , " as a pace @-@ setter with the President 's blessing " . Willkie 's global trip and the publication of One World increased public support for the idea that the United States should remain active internationally once the war was won , and should not withdraw to a new isolationism . Indiana University president Herman B Wells noted that One World " has had such a profound influence on the thinking of Americans " . Zipp noted , " He launched the most successful and unprecedented challenge to conventional nationalism in modern American history ... He urged [ Americans ] to imagine and feel a new form of reciprocity with the world , one that millions of Americans responded to with unprecedented urgency . " 
 His advocacy came at a cost to his standing in the Republican Party , according to Moscow , " his appeal for the party to be the party of the Loyal Opposition , supporting the President , was treason to the diehards ; his trip around the world marked him as a Presidential agent seeking to infiltrate the Republican Party " . This decline was accelerated as it became apparent that Willkie was a liberal , standing to the left of Roosevelt and proposing even higher taxes than the president was willing to stomach . 
 In 1992 , the United States Postal Service marked the centennial of Willkie 's birth with a 75 @-@ cent stamp in the Great Americans series . Dunn concluded that Willkie " died as he had lived , an idealist , a humanitarian — and a lone wolf " . Willkie 's biographer , Neal , wrote of him , 
 Though he never became President , he had won something much more important , a lasting place in American history . Along with Henry Clay , William Jennings Bryan , and Hubert Humphrey , he was the also @-@ ran who would be long remembered . " He was a born leader , " wrote historian Allan Nevins , " and he stepped to leadership at just the moment when the world needed him . ' Shortly before his death , Willkie told a friend , " If I could write my own epitaph and if I had to choose between saying , ' Here lies an unimportant President , ' or , ' Here lies one who contributed to saving freedom at a moment of great peril , ' I would prefer the latter . ' " 
 = School for Creative and Performing Arts = 
 The School for Creative and Performing Arts ( SCPA ) is a magnet arts school in Cincinnati , Ohio , United States , and part of the Cincinnati Public Schools ( CPS ) . SCPA was founded in 1973 as one of the first magnet schools in Cincinnati and became the first school in the country to combine a full range of arts studies with a complete college @-@ preparatory academic program for elementary through high school students . Of the approximately 350 arts schools in the United States , SCPA is one of the oldest and has been cited as a model for both racial integration and for arts programs in over 100 cities . 
 SCPA had three different homes in its first four years , including a makeshift campus in the Mount Adams neighborhood and another in Roselawn . In 1976 , it occupied the Old Woodward High School building , on the site of one of the oldest public schools in the country . The school rose to national prominence in the 1980s , but was nearly closed in the 1990s following a series of scandals , leadership struggles , and an arson fire which destroyed the auditorium . Its reputation recovered in the years that followed and in 2009 – 10 , the school was featured in the MTV reality series Taking the Stage , filmed at the school and featuring SCPA students . In 2010 SCPA combined with the Schiel Primary School for Arts Enrichment to create the first kindergarten through twelfth grade ( about ages five to seventeen ) arts school and first private sector / public arts school in the US . A new facility in Over @-@ the @-@ Rhine was championed by the late Cincinnati Pops Maestro Erich Kunzel and funded through a unique public @-@ private partnership that raised over $ 31 million in private contributions to match public funding . The building features specialized facilities for the arts and three separate theaters and is the key to redevelopment plans for the area . 
 Students must audition for admission ; fewer than 20 percent of those who apply each year are accepted . SCPA is free to CPS students but also attracts tuition @-@ paying students from outside the district and the state . The newly combined school will serve approximately 1 @,@ 300 students in 2010 , offering a curriculum designed to prepare students for professional careers in creative writing , dance , drama , music , technical theater , and visual art . The emphasis is on performance , and students in every field are required to perform or present their work in public regularly . Students compete successfully in arts competitions locally and internationally . On standardized tests , SCPA ranks second among Cincinnati public schools . Ninety percent of graduating seniors continue on to college , and those students receive one of the highest levels of scholarship funding in the city . A limited number of extracurricular activities are offered , as students are expected to commit significant after @-@ school time to training and performance . SCPA has produced notable graduates in a wide range of artistic fields , including award @-@ winning actors , singers , directors and technicians . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 The School for Creative and Performing Arts arose , in part , as a response to the recurring desegregation battles in the Cincinnati Public Schools ( CPS ) in the late 1960s and early 1970s . In a 1965 civil rights suit , the city prevailed when a federal judge found that the schools were not intentionally segregated , but that " the racial composition of each school is simply a result of the racial composition of the neighborhoods which they serve " . By 1971 , Cincinnati 's neighborhoods and schools had grown more segregated and the Supreme Court of the United States upheld forced busing as a remedy for school segregation in other cities . Desiring to avoid such drastic remedies for Cincinnati , newly appointed Superintendent Dr. Donald Waldrip pushed forward a program of alternative schools ( later called magnet schools ) , designed " to calm the desires of parents for academic choice and to stem the demands of federal judges for court @-@ ordered desegregation . " The theory behind alternative schools was open enrollment : students could attend any alternative school they chose at no cost , so long as an even racial balance at the new school was maintained . So far as possible , students were admitted to these programs on a one white for one black basis . The School for Creative and Performing Arts was the first alternative school in what would become one of the largest and most robust magnet programs in the country . 
 In 1965 , Robert <unk> and Bill Dickinson , both music teachers in the Cincinnati Public Schools , founded the Cincinnati All @-@ City Boy Choir , where they were struck by how the discipline they established for the boys in the choir carried over into their academic studies . They conceived the idea of a school where basic education was combined with intensive attention to children with artistic talents . With the support of Waldrip and Tom Murray , director for the west @-@ central division of Cincinnati elementary schools , they pushed for $ 119 @,@ 000 as part of a tax levy referendum in May 1973 ; the measure was defeated . The school was approved with a drastically reduced budget of $ 27 @,@ 000 plus $ 9 @,@ 850 from the Board of Education ’ s general fund . They turned to private funding and won a $ 292 @,@ 000 grant from J. Ralph Corbett , one of the city 's foremost philanthropists for the arts , and $ 24 @,@ 500 for a piano lab from the Baldwin Piano Company , which had manufactured pianos in Cincinnati since 1891 . 
 The School for Creative and Performing Arts opened in August 1973 , as the only grade four through six school for the performing arts in the country and the first public school that combined all of the arts in a single program . The curriculum included art , instrumental music , choral music , dance and drama , and was not organized strictly by grade , but permitted students to advance as soon as their abilities allowed . Murray explained : 
 Fourth through sixth grades will be together in classes . Teaching will often be done in teams . Art students will design scenery for plays , written by drama students . Music pupils will supply the music . They work together regardless of age . In reading classes they will read according to their own individual levels . A brilliant music student , capable of interpreting Beethoven 's wildest dreams , might stumble on fifth level reading . This does not make him a dunce simply a slow reader . 
 = = = Founding in Mount Adams ( 1973 – 1975 ) = = = 
 Dickinson was named coordinator and six weeks later he , <unk> , Murray and others had selected a staff , developed a program , recruited students , and moved into the Mount Adams Public School building at 1125 St. Gregory Street . Described by Cincinnati Magazine as " a quaint village of imaginative , arty residents , unusual shops and restaurants , and historic buildings " and overlooking downtown Cincinnati and the Ohio River , Mount Adams had been home to the Art Academy of Cincinnati ( the museum school of the Cincinnati Art Museum ) since 1887 , and was a " mecca for students and teachers of art " . The Mount Adams School was nearly defunct , with fewer than 80 students remaining . Fifty of those children , ranging from kindergarten ( around age five ) to third grade ( around age eight ) remained alongside the new SCPA . A dozen of the Mount Adams middle school students were accepted into the new program , along with the 140 other fourth through sixth grade pupils selected from schools around the city by audition . 
 By 1974 , SCPA had 332 students , with 500 on the waiting list , and had overflowed into rented space in the surrounding neighborhood , including three rooms at the nearby Holy Cross School , two rooms at the community center two blocks away , and large room for drama above Mike 's Meat Market across the street . Students practiced instruments in hallways and restrooms , and the library was in the middle of the second floor hall . Student productions were held in other schools around the city , and the first major musical , Babes in Toyland , was performed at Education Center downtown . With plans to expand to ninth grade ( around age 14 ) and 540 students in 1975 , and to twelfth grade ( around age 17 ) and 1 @,@ 400 students in 1977 , a new facility had to be found . Waldrip proposed the school move to the Old Woodward school building , then home of Abigail Cutter Junior High School , in Over @-@ the @-@ Rhine , a predominantly African @-@ American area near downtown . Neighborhood resistance was strong and opponents , arguing that " the school administration was trying to avoid problems of integration by moving an alternative school to Cutter and transferring Cutter students elsewhere " , blocked the plan . 
 Councilwoman Bobbie Stern proposed the school move to Cincinnati Union Terminal , a National Historic Landmark which the Historic American Buildings Survey called " a unique and monumental manifestation of Art Deco architecture and interior decoration " , noted for its mosaic murals depicting the history of Cincinnati and its rotunda , 106 feet ( 32 m ) high and 110 feet ( 34 m ) long , the largest semi @-@ dome in the western hemisphere . The facility , vacant since it was abandoned by Amtrak in 1972 , was to house the school , a maintenance facility for the Queen City Metro transit service , and a new rail terminal for Amtrak . The plan was approved in April 1975 and was due for completion for the 1976 school year . 
 = = = Transition in Roselawn ( 1975 – 1976 ) = = = 
 Temporary space was needed in the interim , and the school relocated its 550 fourth through ninth grade students to rented space in Roselawn , the epicenter of Cincinnati 's Jewish Community . The school was divided between two buildings , the Yavneh Day School building at 1636 Summit Road and the nearby Jewish Community Center . The Yavneh Day school , founded in 1952 by parents who wanted to combine secular and Jewish education for their children , moved to Roselawn in 1958 but had outgrown that facility . The school had no lockers ; students carried their belongings between buildings . <unk> were delivered from another school and served at a nearby church . 
 Dickinson became principal in 1975 , and worked to fully integrate the arts into the academic program . " Academics don 't end when art , drama or music classes begin , " he said , " but blend , in an interdisciplinary approach to education . " Music study included acoustics and the history and architecture of important musical periods ; art history was part of the art curriculum and anatomy and physiology were studied in the dance program . The school was recognized with The Cincinnati Post 's Corbett Award in 1976 as " the arts organization making an outstanding contribution to the community " . 
 The Union Terminal project was derailed when the three prospective tenants failed to agree on how to share the space . Having outgrown its temporary facilities , SCPA was again forced to find a new home for the following year . After examining options including the historic Rockdale Temple and two schools slated to be closed in the city 's West End , the school board once again settled on the Old Woodward building , over the objections of the community . 
 = = = Old Woodward and national attention ( 1976 – 1990 ) = = = 
 SCPA 's new home was in the heart of Pendleton district in Over @-@ the @-@ Rhine . One of the largest German @-@ American neighborhoods in the United States in the 19th century and a famed entertainment district at that time , Over @-@ the @-@ Rhine had declined into an impoverished and crime @-@ ridden enclave for migrant Appalachians in the 20th century . By 1970 , a combination of white flight and the destruction of surrounding slums had transformed the area into Cincinnati 's most infamous ghetto . It is one of the largest , most intact urban historic districts in the United States and the most dangerous neighborhood in Cincinnati . The school , with its 650 students , moved into this historic but blighted neighborhood , and its Old Woodward School building at 1310 Sycamore Street . 
 Woodward was one of the oldest public schools in the country , founded as the Woodward Free Grammar School in 1831 ; it was named for William Woodward , a local tanner who donated the land to provide , in his words , " facilities to educate the children of persons who could not afford the expense of private schooling " . The building was replaced once in 1855 , and again in 1907 when President William Howard Taft , who graduated from Woodward in 1874 , laid the cornerstone of the current building ; it opened in 1910 . The site is linked to the Underground Railroad , an informal network of secret routes and safe houses used by 19th @-@ century black slaves in the United States ; Levi Coffin ( known as " The President of the Underground Railroad " ) had a home there from 1856 to 1863 . The five @-@ story brick , stone , and terra cotta building is approximately 225 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 20 @,@ 900 m2 ) . Designed by Gustav Brach , it was considered " an architectural gem " in its time , with some of the most modern facilities of its day , including flush toilets , central heating , and two swimming pools . It is graced with 12 rare Rookwood Pottery drinking fountains from the early 1900s , gifts of the Art League , founded in 1895 , which raised dues from students who would then vote on works of art to buy for the school . The building is part of the Over @-@ the @-@ Rhine National Register Historic District , which encompasses 362 @.@ 5 acres ( 146 @.@ 7 ha ) of the original German community and adjoins the Sycamore – 13th Street Historic District , which reflects the significant architecture associated with middle and late 19th century Greek Revival , Queen Anne , and Italianate styles . 
 Woodward High School moved to a new facility in Bond Hill in 1953 , and the building became Abigail Cutter Junior High School ( also known as Cutter ) , named for William Woodward 's wife . SCPA occupied the fourth floor in 1976 , and the entire building in 1977 , displacing the Cutter students to other public schools . It graduated its first class in 1979 , becoming the first elementary through grade twelve arts program in the country . The first so @-@ called " survivors " , who began in fourth grade , graduated in 1982 . 
 SCPA continued to attract national attention , and as a local TV special reported , " educators from all over the country flock [ ed ] to Cincinnati to see how , and why , it works . " In 1981 , SCPA was invited to perform The Wiz at the National Theatre in Washington , DC , the " Theatre of the Presidents " and oldest major touring house in the country , becoming the first non @-@ professional group to perform there since it opened in 1835 . SCPA student Roscoe ( Rocky ) Carroll won the 1981 National Endowment for the Arts Talent Search in drama and became a Presidential Scholar in the Arts . The school received the Blue Ribbon School of the United States Department of Education in 1984 and the National Secondary School Merit Award in 1985 . By 1985 , it had been credited as the model for arts schools in 100 cities in the US , Europe , and Asia , and had been cited in textbooks as a model of excellence in school integration . 
 The school relied heavily on donations , which made up over ten percent of the total budget . The Friends of SCPA ( commonly known as The Friends ) , a nonprofit organization led by parents and members of the business and arts communities , had been a vital source of funding since the school 's inception . In 1984 , The Friends raised over $ 400 @,@ 000 to pay the salaries of the artistic director , technical director , costume designer , and dance , strings , and production teachers . In later years , The Friends raised up to $ 1 million each year through special events , corporate gifts and sponsorships , advertising sales , and other programs to support the artistic needs of the school including staff salaries , production expenses , scholarships for private lessons , and artists in residence . 
 = = = Controversy and comeback ( 1991 – 2009 ) = = = 
 Scandal erupted when founding principal Dickinson resigned in 1991 , citing health reasons , while under investigation for alleged improper contact with students off school grounds ; no charges were ever filed . He was succeeded by Dr. Rosalyn England , former principal of Central VPA High School in St. Louis . Controversy continued and between 1992 and 1995 , two teachers confessed to having or attempting to have sex with students and two more were investigated for allegations of sexual misconduct . In 1992 , open conflict with England led to the departure of original Artistic Director Jack Louiso , whom Dickinson had called " the ' life @-@ blood ' of the school 's artistic endeavors " . The artistic program would remain in upheaval ; four more artistic directors would come and go under England . The controversies took a toll ; applications suffered , teachers departed , financial support dwindled and the quality of the productions declined . By 1996 , enrollment had fallen from nearly 1 @,@ 200 to 956 . 
 In April 1996 , an arson fire destroyed the school 's auditorium , causing over $ 1 million of damage ; it was a turning point for a school then dangerously close to closure . The culprit was never identified . Erich Kunzel , long time Maestro of the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra and nationally renowned as " the Prince of Pops " , announced his vision for a new SCPA campus near Cincinnati Music Hall , which would be part of an arts and education complex that would help revitalize Over @-@ the @-@ Rhine . A campaign was launched that , over the following 13 years , raised funds and made plans for the new facility . 
 England abruptly retired in 1997 and was replaced by Jeff Brokamp , who had been principal of the Crest Hills Year @-@ Round School , which had won awards for its all @-@ year curriculum . Brokamp , with no previous arts experience , began to turn the school around . A new emphasis on academics , more Advanced Placement courses and more stringent audition standards that admitted only the most dedicated students led to better test scores and a higher level of artistic talent ; Brokamp pushed to expand the school 's vocational training programs in photography , stage management , and costume design by 50 percent . Applications to audition more than tripled by 2001 and fund @-@ raising rebounded . 
 Brokamp resigned and was replaced by Clarence Crum in 2004 , who was followed by John Carlisle in 2006 . Carlisle went on extended leave in October 2007 , pending an investigation into the alleged rape of a former student off school grounds . Carlisle denied the accusation and no criminal charges were filed . He resigned in March 2008 . According to Cincinnati Magazine , the " scandal launched rumors and confusion " and " the revolving door of school administrators " took a toll on faculty and student morale . Carlisle was replaced by Dr. Jonathan <unk> , formerly Assistant Principal at Withrow High School . 
 = = = Taking the Stage ( 2009 – 2010 ) = = = 
 Taking the Stage , a " musical reality " TV series set at SCPA , premiered on MTV in March 2009 . The series , co @-@ created and co @-@ produced by SCPA graduate Nick Lachey , was a dramatized depiction of life at the school . The show chronicled the lives of five real SCPA high school students and their friends in their careers at SCPA . Each episode featured original music and choreography by the students themselves , performed at the school and other locations in Over @-@ the @-@ Rhine . 
 The first season , which premiered on March 19 , 2009 , was the number one primetime cable telecast among females 12 – 24 years old and one of the top four among all viewers 12 – 34 years old . The second season began filming at the school in 2009 , and first aired on January 16 , 2010 . The show was cut from one hour to 30 minutes and focused on new transfer students instead of current SCPA students , leading some students and parents to complain that the admission process had been compromised . The school denied the claim . It ran for 16 episodes , through April 15 , 2010 . In May 2010 , MTV announced there would be no third season . 
 The school was paid $ 10 @,@ 000 for each of the nine episodes in season one and twelve in season two . The show attracted international attention for the school and interest from prospective students around the world ; applications for admission increased by 60 percent in 2009 . 
 = = = Washington Park ( 2010 – ) = = = 
 In the aftermath of the 1996 fire , a group of local benefactors led by Kunzel formed the Greater Cincinnati Arts and Education Center ( GCAEC ) to , in Kunzel 's words , " transform the area around Washington Park into a unique arts community that would include a new School for the Creative and Performing Arts . " The GCAEC committed $ 31 million , the Cincinnati Public Schools $ 34 million , and the State of Ohio $ 7 million , to combine SCPA with the Schiel Primary School for Arts Enrichment in one building to create the first public kindergarten through twelfth grade arts school in what the GCAEC called the " nationally unprecedented public school system – private sector partnership " . 
 Schiel , built in 1911 as an elementary school for the <unk> neighborhood , was converted to a Spanish @-@ language magnet school in 1974 and again to an arts enrichment school in 1985 . Schiel students have been admitted by open enrollment on a first @-@ come @-@ first @-@ served basis . With 420 kindergarten through third grade students in 2008 ( around ages five through nine ) , 83 percent of them black , 72 percent economically disadvantaged , it has been the primary feeder school for SCPA , for which Schiel students have been required to audition . Schiel was one of two CPS schools recognized as a Blue Ribbon School in 2010 . 
 The construction plans faced opposition from those in the community who feared the project would displace the Drop Inn Center , the region 's largest homeless shelter , and the design was revised to build around it . By 2007 , after more than a decade of fund @-@ raising and negotiations , 90 percent of the final $ 72 million budget had been secured and ground was broken for a new building across from Washington Park in September of that year . The 5 @.@ 75 @-@ acre ( 2 @.@ 33 ha ) park , reclaimed from old burial grounds between 1858 and 1863 , is lined with trees and benches and features statues of Friedrich Hecker and Robert Latimer McCook , German @-@ American heroes of the American Civil War . As Over @-@ the @-@ Rhine has declined , a significant homeless population has overtaken the area . 
 The park faces Cincinnati Music Hall , home to the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra , Cincinnati Opera , Cincinnati May Festival , and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra . Designed by Samuel Hannaford , one of Cincinnati 's most important architects , and built with private funds in 1878 , it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 , noting its " stunning composition in the High Victorian Gothic mode " . It was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1974 . Memorial Hall , a Beaux Arts theater built by Hannaford in 1908 , is immediately south of Music Hall , and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 . Since 2005 the area has also been home to the Art Academy of Cincinnati , founded in 1869 . Formerly aligned with the Cincinnati Art Museum , it became an independent college of design in 1998 . The Ensemble Theatre of Cincinnati and Know Theater are also part of the rich cultural community that has developed around the park and Music Hall . 
 The combined school retains the name School for the Creative and Performing Arts . Private donors will have a significant and ongoing voice in how the school is operated . According to the Cincinnati Enquirer , the school board approved a plan in 2003 to allow the GCAEC to choose five of the twelve members of the Local School Decision @-@ Making Committee ( <unk> ) , an independent body that provides oversight for the school , as a condition for continued fund @-@ raising . This private sector oversight has been criticized by union leaders as excluding faculty and staff . The GCAEC began fundraising for an endowment in 2010 , and as of 2010 , had pledged to contribute at least $ 150 @,@ 000 per year to the school . 
 No plans were announced for the Old Woodward building , but it was expected to remain vacant for years . An Ohio School Facilities Assessment in 2002 reported that it was " very attractive architecturally and merits any means required to preserve it " , and that residential units would be the best use , but that a major redevelopment project , while attractive to private developers , would be prohibitively expensive . The area surrounding the old building has seen a resurgence in recent years including a public green space named Cutter Playground directly north of the building , currently home to the OTR Urban Kickball League . In November , 2012 , the building was sold at auction to Core Redevelopment of Indianapolis for $ 1 @.@ 3 million . It had been appraised at $ 8 @.@ 5 million . The developer 's plans for the building were not made clear at the time . 
 = = Admission = = 
 The school has been criticized as " elitist " for its selective admission policies . Prospective students are evaluated on their artistic sensitivity and potential . Students entering grades four through six are required to audition in every arts major ; older students may audition in only the areas they choose . Each applicant performs in front of up to seven teachers in different areas in the day @-@ long process , which is designed to ensure that no student is admitted to a program in which they do not belong . Admission is granted to students scoring 8 out of 10 points in at least one area . On average , 1 @,@ 700 students apply each year , 1 @,@ 000 are invited to audition , and 250 are accepted . Attendance is free for Cincinnati Public School students . Ten percent of students come from outside the district — some from outside the state — and pay tuition to attend . Tuition for the 2006 – 2007 year was $ 6 @,@ 309 for out @-@ of @-@ district students and $ 9 @,@ 654 for out @-@ of @-@ state students . 
 As a magnet school founded to promote school integration , racial and economic diversity have been important factors in admissions decisions . The student body was 52 @.@ 1 percent black , 41 @.@ 7 percent low income , and 7 @.@ 7 percent disabled in 2009 – 10 . In 2007 , in response to a US Supreme Court decision prohibiting racial criteria for assigning students to public schools , CPS eliminated race and gender as determining factors in magnet school admissions . School officials insist this will have little impact , despite parent concerns that the decision will erode diversity . 
 = = Curriculum = = 
 = = = Arts = = = 
 The curriculum is designed to prepare students for professional careers in the arts . Each student concentrates in at least one major area : creative writing , dance , drama , music , stagecraft , and visual art . Younger students often concentrate in two or more . High school students are required to specialize and major only in the areas in which they have potential to do professional work . Advanced students study up to two hours each day in their major . Forty percent of the students stay at least two hours after school for rehearsals , private lessons , and productions . 
 The program stresses discipline and performance . There are no appreciation courses ; the curriculum emphasizes that arts appreciation grows from practicing an art . The interrelation of the arts is also stressed . All students take at least one course in each major area . A dancer , for example , will be required to study visual art , drama , and music . 
 The visual arts program includes drawing , painting , photography , sculpting , digital art , and art history . The program is highly structured , emphasizing technique and control over free expression , which has attracted criticism from the local art community . Art students receive individualized instruction , participate in art exhibits and competitions , undertake commissioned work , and work at in @-@ house galleries and off @-@ site exhibits . Most art majors take Advanced Placement art courses by the end of their sophomore year , and many attend pre @-@ college programs at major universities between their high school years . 
 The drama program stresses technique and performance ; students must perform in public at least twice a year . There are three major dramatic productions each season , and high school students are required to compete in the English Speaking Union Shakespeare Contest . Advanced students audition for the Acting Ensemble Company , which provides a full season of performances in venues outside the school . The creative writing program focuses on writing as an art in journalism , script writing , poetry , and creative non @-@ fiction . Students participate in writing competitions , internships , and develop portfolios to showcase their work . 
 The dance program was founded on the training principles of the " most famous dance schools of Europe " , which emphasize body training . All dancers are required to study ballet , but may also learn modern dance , jazz , tap , and other forms of dance . There are nine levels of ballet , and students begin intensive training in fourth grade . Dance classes meet for at least two 45 @-@ minute periods every day ; advanced students may train for three or more . Dance Ensemble , selected by audition , stages public performances throughout the year . 
 The instrumental music program offers specializations in orchestra , band , piano , jazz , percussion , and harp . Students major in an instrument and specialized training begins in grade four . Advanced students take private lessons , arranged by the school , and have master classes with guest instructors from the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra . Vocal music students audition to perform in one of 13 vocal performance groups . High school students may audition for the most selective of these , " 13th & Broadway " , which performs throughout the region . 
 The technical theater program offers college @-@ level training in stage management , lighting , sound , and set and costume design . Each specialty has a lab for students to develop concepts and practice technique , and students work side @-@ by @-@ side with professional trades people in their chosen field . 
 Student present to the faculty of their major department twice a year in a " proficiency review " to assess their progress . It is a learning experience for younger students , but students in grades 7 – 12 who fail to attain a passing rating are placed on probation and must pass their subsequent review to be allowed to continue in that major . Students must audition if they wish to change majors for the following year . 
 The highlight of the performance season is a major musical production which is an important source of revenue for the school . There are two ballets each year : The Nutcracker in the winter and a piece from repertoire in the spring . The technical and production aspects of performances are handled entirely by students , a level of responsibility the school claims is unusual even among arts schools . Strict racial balance is maintained in all school performances through " non @-@ traditional casting " , in which the race of each lead role alternates in each production . 
 SCPA students and faculty have performed with professional companies and in major venues including Carnegie Hall and the Kennedy Center . Students are selected to perform with every major local arts company , including the Cincinnati Opera , Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park , and the Cincinnati Ballet , and appear in local television programs and commercials . SCPA students have performed on PBS with the Cincinnati Pops and toured with Broadway productions including 42nd Street and The King and I. Students on tour continue their studies at " set school " and rejoin their classmates when they return . 
 SCPA students are encouraged to compete in arts competitions at all levels , including international contests like the World Piano Competition and the American High School Theater Festival in Edinburgh . Honors since 2008 have included first place in the <unk> Robert Fox Award for Young Writers , a bronze medal at the Cincinnati World Piano Competition , top honors at the Days of International Choir Music Competition , and the 2008 Cincinnati Arts Association Overture Award in Visual Art . 
 = = = Academics = = = 
 Students are required to complete a standard CPS academic curriculum alongside their arts studies and the school day is 45 minutes longer than other Cincinnati public schools . SCPA ranks first in the district on standardized test scores at the elementary school level . At the high school level , only Walnut Hills High School , Cincinnati 's selective public college preparatory magnet , ranks higher . In 2009 , the graduation rate was 95 @.@ 5 percent and the mean score on the ACT , a standardized college admissions test , was 23 ( at the 69th percentile ) . On the Ohio Department of Education 2009 – 2010 School Year Report card , SCPA was designated " Effective " and Schiel was designated " Excellent . " Ninety percent of graduating seniors continue on to college , and those students receive one of the highest levels of scholarship funding in the city . In 2007 , the 98 graduating seniors received a combined $ 7 @.@ 1 million in scholarships and SCPA averaged $ 72 @,@ 449 per student , the third most of any public or private school in Cincinnati . 
 = = Extracurricular activities = = 
 SCPA offers a limited range of sports and other activities compared to other CPS schools , as students are expected to commit significant after @-@ school time to practice and performance . Volunteer community service opportunities are organized by the Positive School Culture committee and made available to students in every grade . Student Council is elected from each grade and raises funds for student activities . National Honor Society ( for grades ten to twelve ) and National Junior Honor Society ( for grades seven through nine ) are by invitation only to students who demonstrate outstanding achievement , service , leadership , and citizenship . 
 German , French , and Spanish clubs are open to all students and plan language @-@ related activities . The Astronomy Club for Girls for fourth through sixth graders takes advantage of the nearby Cincinnati Observatory to explore astronomy .

 Glenn Alan Robinson III ( born January 8 , 1994 ) is an American professional basketball player for the Indiana Pacers of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . Robinson played college basketball for the Michigan Wolverines for two years . He was an All @-@ State high school basketball player for Lake Central High School in St. John , Indiana . After his sophomore season at Michigan for the 2013 – 14 team he declared for the NBA draft . Robinson was drafted 40th overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 2014 NBA draft . He has also played in the NBA with the Philadelphia 76ers . He is the son of Glenn Robinson , the 1994 NBA first overall draft pick . 
 = = Early life and high school = = 
 Robinson was born , weighing 3 pounds 4 ounces ( 1 @.@ 5 kg ) , three months premature to his single Purdue University freshman mother , Shantelle Clay , at Methodist Hospital in Gary , Indiana . He spent his first two months in an incubator ( with a miniature basketball ) , until he was about 6 pounds ( 2 @.@ 7 kg ) . By age three he was a participant in the Hammond , Indiana YMCA children 's basketball league . Robinson attended <unk> Middle School in <unk> , Indiana prior to attending Lake Central High School in St. John , Indiana . He stood at 5 feet 6 inches ( 1 @.@ 68 m ) in seventh grade and 6 feet 1 inch ( 1 @.@ 85 m ) two years later as a freshman . Robinson was nearly 6 feet 4 inches ( 1 @.@ 93 m ) during his sophomore season and stood at over 6 feet 5 @.@ 5 inches ( 1 @.@ 97 m ) as a junior . 
 As a freshman , he played junior varsity for Lake Central and once made a game @-@ winning half @-@ court shot . That year he became obsessed with his dream of dunking and even bought special shoes and wore ankle weights to help his dream come true . At the time , his father lived in Atlanta and Robinson grew up with his mother , Shantelle Clay @-@ Irving and younger brother Gelen . During the summer between his freshman and sophomore season , he came under the wing of two substitute father figures : Dave <unk> , Lake Central Varsity Basketball head coach , and Wayne Brumm , AAU SYF Players under @-@ 17 coach . <unk> convinced Robinson to come to the gym for early morning workouts , often waking Robinson at his home . Brumm , who would eventually continue to mentor Robinson as a collegian , advised Robinson to hire a personal trainer named Andrew Wallen , who helped Robinson augment his vertical leap . He also helped Robinson bulk up from 167 pounds ( 75 @.@ 75 kg ) prior to his sophomore year to 210 pounds ( 95 @.@ 25 kg ) in two years . Growing up , Robinson has not embodied the tough vocal demeanor that his father had and the his brother developed . His passive nature has shown itself in all facets of Robinson 's life including his basketball game . 
 As a sophomore , he was a first @-@ team All @-@ area selection after leading Lake Central in scoring . On September 14 , 2010 , Robinson became the first verbal commitment to the Michigan Wolverines men 's basketball class of 2012 . At the time , he had scholarship offers from Colorado , Valparaiso , Missouri State , IUPUI and Indiana State , and Rivals.com rated him as the 118th best player in the class of 2012 . On February 5 , 2011 , Robinson posted his career @-@ high 39 points against East Chicago Central High School on 14 @-@ for @-@ 19 shooting . This was his first high school game that his father attended . In the 2011 Indiana sectional against Munster High School , Robinson scored 31 points in an overtime 54 – 53 loss , but missed a free throw in the final seconds . 
 Robinson and Mitch McGary had been friends for years prior to their Michigan affiliation . By the time McGary committed to Michigan in November 2011 , Robinson had moved up to the national number 34 player ranking according to Rivals.com.

 The episode was written by Ken Levine and David Isaacs , and directed by Mark Kirkland . It was the first episode of The Simpsons Kirkland directed . He has since directed over 50 episodes . Executive producer James L. Brooks came up with the idea of the Moe 's Tavern wraparounds at the beginning and the end of the episode . It was added because the writers did not know how to end the episode . Levine had worked as a minor league baseball announcer before the episode was produced so he was able to give directions to the animators on the characters ' looks and ambiance of the episode . 
 Many of the new characters introduced in the episode were named after Levine 's friends from his announcer career . The minor league announcer in the episode , that Levine voiced , was named Dan Hoard after his broadcasting partner in Syracuse , New York . The major league announcer was named Dave Glass after Levine 's partner in Norfolk , Virginia , and the Capital City Capitals owner who fires Homer was named Dave Rosenfield after the general manager of the Tidewater Tides . The episode features a guest appearance by singer Tony Bennett , who was the first guest star to appear as himself on The Simpsons . Bennett appears in a scene in which the Simpson family meets him while taking a tour of Capital City . He also sings a song called " Capital City " over the closing credits . The lyrics and music of the song were written by Simpsons writer Jeff Martin . Tom Poston guest starred in the episode as the Capital City Goofball . The mascot has appeared in many episodes later on in the show , but he has only spoken once since " Dancin ' Homer " and has been reduced to making minor background appearances . Ron Taylor was meant to reprise his role of Bleeding Gums Murphy , who he had played in the first season episode " Moaning Lisa " , but was unable to record the part ; Daryl L. Coley filled in for him . 
 " Dancin ' Homer " was , together with " Old Money " , selected for release in a video collection titled The Best of The Simpsons that was released May 3 , 1994 . In 2000 , it was included on video collection of selected sports @-@ themed episodes , titled : The Simpsons : On Your Marks , Get Set , D 'oh ! .

Levine , Isaacs , Kirkland , Mike Reiss , and Matt Groening participated in the DVD 's audio commentary .

 Homer 's chants and his nickname " Dancin ' Homer " is a reference to American baseball fan Wild Bill Hagy , who earned the nickname " The Roar from Thirty @-@ Four " for his chants during the 1970s in section thirty @-@ four at Baltimore 's Memorial Stadium . Homer spells out Springfield just like Hagy spelled O @-@ R @-@ I @-@ O @-@ L @-@ E @-@ S with his arms . 
 A drunk Homer performs his first dance to the 1961 tune " Baby Elephant Walk " written by Henry Mancini . 
 Bleeding Gums Murphy makes a 26 @-@ minute long performance of the " Star @-@ Spangled Banner " at the game where Homer performs his first dance . 
 Homer 's line , " Today , as I leave for Capital City , I consider myself the luckiest mascot on the face of the earth " that he says in his farewell speech to the Springfield fans , is a reference to Lou Gehrig 's farewell speech in the 1942 baseball film The Pride of the Yankees . 
 The song " Capital City " that Bennett sings over the closing credits is a parody of the 1980 song " New York , New York " .

 Since airing , the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics . DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson said it was " probably the best episode " of the season , and commented that " Dancin ' Homer " offered a " consistently satisfying show . Like the better episodes , it packed a lot of action into its twenty @-@ three minutes , as Homer ’ s saga took on a near epic feeling . It also contained more wonderfully bizarre asides than usual at this point in the series ’ run . From the Rastafarians who appear in the crowd when Homer performs ' Baby Elephant Walk ' , to the existence of the Players ’ Ex @-@ Wives section at the ballpark , the episode provided a fun and rich program . " In a review of the second season , Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend said " Dancin ' Homer " felt " a bit flat " , but " even in [ its ] lowest points , humor is easy to find . " Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought the best line of the episode was Homer 's " Marge , this ticket doesn 't just give me a seat . It also gives me the right — no , the duty — to make a complete ass of myself . " Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk said lines from the episode such as " A Simpson on a T @-@ shirt , I never thought I 'd see the day " show a " humorous self @-@ awareness of the emergence of The Simpsons as cultural phenomenon " . 
 The episode was by Jerry Greene of the Orlando Sentinel named the third best episode of the show with a sports theme . The Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette named it second best sports moment in the history of the show . Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , the authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , wrote : " Understanding baseball isn 't really a requirement for this episode , as the humor doesn 't come from the games so much as the personalities . Tony Bennett 's cameo is great , and Homer 's dance has rightly become legendary . "

 Jared Leto as Nemo Nobody , both <unk> and 118 @-@ year @-@ old . Nemo is a Latin word meaning " nobody " .

It is the false name that Odysseus in Homer 's poem Odyssey gives to the cyclops Polyphemus , to deceive him and save his own life . Van Dormael said that Leto was chosen because he is " an actor who could transform himself , as much physically as vocally , rhythmically , his breathing . " Leto described his role saying , " Mr. Nobody is everyone and no one all at the same time , an illusion , the product of his own dreams . He 's love , he 's hope , he 's fear , he 's life and he 's death . This is without doubt the most complex character I 've ever played . It was a challenge to keep all these lives concentrated into one character for the duration of the filming without losing myself . But we had outlines and things that helped me to keep track of where we were . " Actor Toby Regbo portrays Nemo at fifteen and Thomas Byrne Nemo at nine . 
 Sarah Polley as Elise . Polley was the first to be cast in the film . She describes Elise as " a young woman who carries a lot of love inside her .

She doesn 't understand why she can 't pull out of it . Over time she develops a feeling of shame and guilt towards her husband and her children . " Actress Clare Stone portrays Elise at fifteen . 
 Diane Kruger as Anna . Kruger described Anna as " the most complete of all the characters . She never makes any compromises , in any one of her lives . She gets married and keeps her promise until the end : she will not fall in love with anyone else . " Actress Eva Green was originally reported for the role , but the casting was not confirmed . Actress Juno Temple portrays Anna at fifteen .

It also shows that lives that seem perfect on paper might not be so perfect in reality . " Actress Audrey Giacomini portrays Jeanne at fifteen . 
 Rhys Ifans as Nemo 's father . Van Dormael chose Ifans after seeing his " multifaceted " performances in Notting Hill ( 1999 ) and Enduring Love ( 2004 ) .

 Belgian director Jaco Van Dormael began seeking to film Mr. Nobody in 2001 , an attempt that lasted six years before the director was able to make his English @-@ language feature debut in 2007 . Van Dormael 's project differed from other Belgian productions in being filmed in English instead of in one of Belgium 's main languages . The director explained , " The story came to me in English . It 's a story set over very long distances and time frames . One of the strands of the plot is about a kid who must choose between living with his mother in Canada or his father in England . There are also some incredible English @-@ speaking actors I wanted to work with . " Mr. Nobody is Van Dormael 's first feature film since the Belgian film Le huitième jour ( The Eighth Day ) in 1996 . Van Dormael began preparing production of Mr. Nobody in February 2007 with actress Sarah Polley the first to be cast in the film . Actor Jared Leto was later cast into the primary role of Nemo Nobody . 
 The production budget for Mr. Nobody was € 33 million ( US $ 47 million ) , ranking it the most expensive Belgian film to date . The budget was approved before casting was done , based on the prominence of the director 's name and the strength of his script . Half of the budget was provided by the film 's French producer Philippe Godeau through his production company Pan @-@ Européenne , and the other half was financed by distributors Wild Bunch and Pathé . Production took place throughout 2007 , lasting 120 days and filming in Belgium , Germany , and Canada . Scenes were filmed on location in Montreal , Canada and at Babelsberg Studios in Berlin , Germany . Van Dormael said , " I think the film needed that for these multiple lives . Each time a new style of setting is required . And each life is filmed in a different style , with a different grammar for the camera , the colours , the decor . At the same time , if all the styles have to be very contrasted , they knock together by fusing . " The three lives that Nemo Nobody experiences were separated by color @-@ coding and musical cues . Each life 's design was also based on the work of British photographer Martin Parr .
