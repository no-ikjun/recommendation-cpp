 Unlike most materials , plutonium increases in density when it melts , by 2 @.@ 5 % , but the liquid metal exhibits a linear decrease in density with temperature . Near the melting point , the liquid plutonium has also very high viscosity and surface tension as compared to other metals . 
 = = = Allotropes = = = 
 Plutonium normally has six allotropes and forms a seventh ( zeta , ζ ) at high temperature within a limited pressure range . These allotropes , which are different structural modifications or forms of an element , have very similar internal energies but significantly varying densities and crystal structures . This makes plutonium very sensitive to changes in temperature , pressure , or chemistry , and allows for dramatic volume changes following phase transitions from one allotropic form to another . The densities of the different allotropes vary from 16 @.@ 00 g / cm3 to 19 @.@ 86 g / cm3 . 
 The presence of these many allotropes makes machining plutonium very difficult , as it changes state very readily . For example , the α form exists at room temperature in unalloyed plutonium . It has machining characteristics similar to cast iron but changes to the plastic and malleable β ( beta ) form at slightly higher temperatures . The reasons for the complicated phase diagram are not entirely understood . The α form has a low @-@ symmetry monoclinic structure , hence its brittleness , strength , compressibility , and poor thermal conductivity . 
 Plutonium in the δ ( delta ) form normally exists in the 310 ° C to 452 ° C range but is stable at room temperature when alloyed with a small percentage of gallium , aluminium , or cerium , enhancing workability and allowing it to be welded . The δ form has more typical metallic character , and is roughly as strong and malleable as aluminium . In fission weapons , the explosive shock waves used to compress a plutonium core will also cause a transition from the usual δ phase plutonium to the denser α form , significantly helping to achieve supercriticality . The ε phase , the highest temperature solid allotrope , exhibits anomalously high atomic self @-@ diffusion compared to other elements . 
 = = = Nuclear fission = = = 
 Plutonium is a radioactive actinide metal whose isotope , plutonium @-@ 239 , is one of the three primary fissile isotopes ( uranium @-@ 233 and uranium @-@ 235 are the other two ) ; plutonium @-@ 241 is also highly fissile . To be considered fissile , an isotope 's atomic nucleus must be able to break apart or fission when struck by a slow moving neutron and to release enough additional neutrons to sustain the nuclear chain reaction by splitting further nuclei . 
 Pure plutonium @-@ 239 may have a multiplication factor ( <unk> ) larger than one , which means that if the metal is present in sufficient quantity and with an appropriate geometry ( e.g. , a sphere of sufficient size ) , it can form a critical mass . During fission , a fraction of the binding energy , which holds a nucleus together , is released as a large amount of electromagnetic and kinetic energy ( much of the latter being quickly converted to thermal energy ) . Fission of a kilogram of plutonium @-@ 239 can produce an explosion equivalent to 21 @,@ 000 tons of TNT ( 88 @,@ 000 GJ ) . It is this energy that makes plutonium @-@ 239 useful in nuclear weapons and reactors . 
 The presence of the isotope plutonium @-@ 240 in a sample limits its nuclear bomb potential , as plutonium @-@ 240 has a relatively high spontaneous fission rate ( ~ 440 fissions per second per gram — over 1 @,@ 000 neutrons per second per gram ) , raising the background neutron levels and thus increasing the risk of predetonation . Plutonium is identified as either weapons @-@ grade , fuel @-@ grade , or reactor @-@ grade based on the percentage of plutonium @-@ 240 that it contains . Weapons @-@ grade plutonium contains less than 7 % plutonium @-@ 240 . Fuel @-@ grade plutonium contains from 7 % to less than 19 % , and power reactor @-@ grade contains 19 % or more plutonium @-@ 240 . <unk> plutonium , with less than 4 % of plutonium @-@ 240 , is used in U.S. Navy weapons stored in proximity to ship and submarine crews , due to its lower radioactivity . The isotope plutonium @-@ 238 is not fissile but can undergo nuclear fission easily with fast neutrons as well as alpha decay . 
 = = = Isotopes and synthesis = = = 
 Twenty radioactive isotopes of plutonium have been characterized . The longest @-@ lived are plutonium @-@ 244 , with a half @-@ life of 80 @.@ 8 million years , plutonium @-@ 242 , with a half @-@ life of 373 @,@ 300 years , and plutonium @-@ 239 , with a half @-@ life of 24 @,@ 110 years . All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half @-@ lives that are less than 7 @,@ 000 years . This element also has eight metastable states , though all have half @-@ lives less than one second . 
 The isotopes of plutonium range in mass number from 228 to 247 . The primary decay modes of isotopes with mass numbers lower than the most stable isotope , plutonium @-@ 244 , are spontaneous fission and alpha emission , mostly forming uranium ( 92 protons ) and neptunium ( 93 protons ) isotopes as decay products ( neglecting the wide range of daughter nuclei created by fission processes ) . The primary decay mode for isotopes with mass numbers higher than plutonium @-@ 244 is beta emission , mostly forming americium ( 95 protons ) isotopes as decay products . Plutonium @-@ 241 is the parent isotope of the neptunium decay series , decaying to americium @-@ 241 via beta or electron emission . 
 Plutonium @-@ 238 and 239 are the most widely synthesized isotopes . Plutonium @-@ 239 is synthesized via the following reaction using uranium ( U ) and neutrons ( n ) via beta decay ( β − ) with neptunium ( Np ) as an intermediate : 
 <formula> 
 Neutrons from the fission of uranium @-@ 235 are captured by uranium @-@ 238 nuclei to form uranium @-@ 239 ; a beta decay converts a neutron into a proton to form Np @-@ 239 ( half @-@ life 2 @.@ 36 days ) and another beta decay forms plutonium @-@ 239 . Egon Bretscher working on the British Tube Alloys project predicted this reaction theoretically in 1940 . 
 Plutonium @-@ 238 is synthesized by bombarding uranium @-@ 238 with deuterons ( D , the nuclei of heavy hydrogen ) in the following reaction : 
 <formula> 
 In this process , a deuteron hitting uranium @-@ 238 produces two neutrons and neptunium @-@ 238 , which spontaneously decays by emitting negative beta particles to form plutonium @-@ 238 . 
 = = = Decay heat and fission properties = = = 
 Plutonium isotopes undergo radioactive decay , which produces decay heat . Different isotopes produce different amounts of heat per mass . The decay heat is usually listed as watt / kilogram , or <unk> / gram . In larger pieces of plutonium ( e.g. a weapon pit ) and inadequate heat removal the resulting self @-@ heating may be significant . All isotopes produce weak gamma on decay . 
 = = = Compounds and chemistry = = = 
 At room temperature , pure plutonium is silvery in color but gains a tarnish when oxidized . The element displays four common ionic oxidation states in aqueous solution and one rare one : 
 Pu ( III ) , as <unk> + ( blue lavender ) 
 Pu ( IV ) , as Pu4 + ( yellow brown ) 
 Pu ( V ) , as PuO + 
 2 ( light pink ) 
 Pu ( VI ) , as PuO2 + 
 2 ( pink orange ) 
 Pu ( VII ) , as <unk> − 
 5 ( green ) — the <unk> ion is rare . 
 The color shown by plutonium solutions depends on both the oxidation state and the nature of the acid anion . It is the acid anion that influences the degree of complexing — how atoms connect to a central atom — of the plutonium species . 
 Metallic plutonium is produced by reacting plutonium tetrafluoride with barium , calcium or lithium at 1200 ° C. It is attacked by acids , oxygen , and steam but not by alkalis and dissolves easily in concentrated hydrochloric , <unk> and perchloric acids . Molten metal must be kept in a vacuum or an inert atmosphere to avoid reaction with air . At 135 ° C the metal will ignite in air and will explode if placed in carbon tetrachloride . 
 Plutonium is a reactive metal . In moist air or moist argon , the metal oxidizes rapidly , producing a mixture of oxides and hydrides . If the metal is exposed long enough to a limited amount of water vapor , a powdery surface coating of PuO2 is formed . Also formed is plutonium hydride but an excess of water vapor forms only PuO2 . 
 Plutonium shows enormous , and reversible , reaction rates with pure hydrogen , forming plutonium hydride . It also reacts readily with oxygen , forming PuO and PuO2 as well as intermediate oxides ; plutonium oxide fills 40 % more volume than plutonium metal . The metal reacts with the halogens , giving rise to compounds with the general formula <unk> where X can be F , Cl , Br or I and <unk> is also seen . The following oxyhalides are observed : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . It will react with carbon to form <unk> , nitrogen to form <unk> and silicon to form <unk> . 
 <unk> of plutonium , its hydrides and certain oxides like <unk> are pyrophoric , meaning they can ignite spontaneously at ambient temperature and are therefore handled in an inert , dry atmosphere of nitrogen or argon . Bulk plutonium ignites only when heated above 400 ° C. <unk> spontaneously heats up and transforms into PuO2 , which is stable in dry air , but reacts with water vapor when heated . 
 <unk> used to contain plutonium need to be able to withstand its strongly reducing properties . Refractory metals such as tantalum and tungsten along with the more stable oxides , borides , carbides , nitrides and silicides can tolerate this . Melting in an electric arc furnace can be used to produce small ingots of the metal without the need for a crucible . 
 Cerium is used as a chemical simulant of plutonium for development of containment , extraction , and other technologies . 
 = = = = Electronic structure = = = = 
 Plutonium is an element in which the 5f electrons are the transition border between delocalized and localized ; it is therefore considered one of the most complex elements . The anomalous behavior of plutonium is caused by its electronic structure . The energy difference between the 6d and 5f subshells is very low . The size of the 5f shell is just enough to allow the electrons to form bonds within the lattice , on the very boundary between localized and bonding behavior . The proximity of energy levels leads to multiple low @-@ energy electron configurations with near equal energy levels . This leads to competing <unk> and 5fn − <unk> configurations , which causes the complexity of its chemical behavior . The highly directional nature of 5f orbitals is responsible for directional covalent bonds in molecules and complexes of plutonium . 
 = = = Alloys = = = 
 Plutonium can form alloys and intermediate compounds with most other metals . Exceptions include lithium , sodium , potassium , rubidium and caesium of the alkali metals ; and magnesium , calcium , strontium , and barium of the alkaline earth metals ; and europium and ytterbium of the rare earth metals . Partial exceptions include the refractory metals chromium , molybdenum , niobium , tantalum , and tungsten , which are soluble in liquid plutonium , but insoluble or only slightly soluble in solid plutonium . Gallium , aluminium , americium , scandium and cerium can stabilize the δ phase of plutonium for room temperature . Silicon , indium , zinc and zirconium allow formation of metastable δ state when rapidly cooled . High amounts of hafnium , holmium and thallium also allows some retention of the δ phase at room temperature . Neptunium is the only element that can stabilize the α phase at higher temperatures . 
 Plutonium alloys can be produced by adding a metal to molten plutonium . If the alloying metal is sufficiently reductive , plutonium can be added in the form of oxides or halides . The δ phase plutonium – gallium and plutonium – aluminium alloys are produced by adding plutonium ( III ) fluoride to molten gallium or aluminium , which has the advantage of avoiding dealing directly with the highly reactive plutonium metal . 
 Plutonium – gallium is used for stabilizing the δ phase of plutonium , avoiding the α @-@ phase and α – δ related issues . Its main use is in pits of implosion nuclear weapons . 
 Plutonium – aluminium is an alternative to the Pu – Ga alloy . It was the original element considered for δ phase stabilization , but its tendency to react with the alpha particles and release neutrons reduces its usability for nuclear weapon pits . Plutonium – aluminium alloy can be also used as a component of nuclear fuel . 
 Plutonium – gallium – cobalt alloy ( <unk> ) is an unconventional superconductor , showing superconductivity below 18 @.@ 5 K , an order of magnitude higher than the highest between heavy fermion systems , and has large critical current . 
 Plutonium – zirconium alloy can be used as nuclear fuel . 
 Plutonium – cerium and plutonium – cerium – cobalt alloys are used as nuclear fuels . 
 Plutonium – uranium , with about 15 – 30 mol . % plutonium , can be used as a nuclear fuel for fast breeder reactors . Its pyrophoric nature and high susceptibility to corrosion to the point of self @-@ igniting or disintegrating after exposure to air require alloying with other components . Addition of aluminium , carbon or copper does not improve disintegration rates markedly , zirconium and iron alloys have better corrosion resistance but they disintegrate in several months in air as well . Addition of titanium and / or zirconium significantly increases the melting point of the alloy . 
 Plutonium – uranium – titanium and plutonium – uranium – zirconium were investigated for use as nuclear fuels . The addition of the third element increases corrosion resistance , reduces flammability , and improves ductility , <unk> , strength , and thermal expansion . Plutonium – uranium – molybdenum has the best corrosion resistance , forming a protective film of oxides , but titanium and zirconium are preferred for physics reasons . 
 Thorium – uranium – plutonium was investigated as a nuclear fuel for fast breeder reactors . 
 = = = Occurrence = = = 
 Trace amounts of at least four plutonium isotopes ( plutonium @-@ 238 , <unk> , -240 , and <unk> ) can be found in nature . Small traces of plutonium @-@ 239 , a few parts per trillion , and its decay products are naturally found in some concentrated ores of uranium , such as the natural nuclear fission reactor in Oklo , Gabon . The ratio of plutonium @-@ 239 to uranium at the Cigar Lake Mine uranium deposit ranges from 2 @.@ 4 × 10 − 12 to 44 × 10 − 12 . Even smaller amounts of primordial plutonium @-@ 244 occur naturally due to its relatively long half @-@ life of about 80 million years . These trace amounts of 239Pu originate in the following fashion : on rare occasions , 238U undergoes spontaneous fission , and in the process , the nucleus emits one or two free neutrons with some kinetic energy . When one of these neutrons strikes the nucleus of another 238U atom , it is absorbed by the atom , which becomes 239U . With a relatively short half @-@ life , 239U decays to 239Np , which decays into 239Pu . 
 Because the relatively long @-@ lived isotope plutonium @-@ 240 occurs in the decay chain of plutonium @-@ 244 it should also be present , albeit 10 @,@ 000 times rarer still . Finally , exceedingly small amounts of plutonium @-@ 238 , attributed to the extremely rare double beta decay of uranium @-@ 238 , have been found in natural uranium samples . 
 Minute traces of plutonium are usually found in the human body due to the 550 atmospheric and underwater nuclear tests that have been carried out , and to a small number of major nuclear accidents . Most atmospheric and underwater nuclear testing was stopped by the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963 , which was signed and ratified by the United States , the United Kingdom , the Soviet Union , and other nations . Continued atmospheric nuclear weapons testing since 1963 by non @-@ treaty nations included those by China ( atomic bomb test above the Gobi Desert in 1964 , hydrogen bomb test in 1967 , and follow @-@ on tests ) , and France ( tests as recently as the 1990s ) . Because it is deliberately manufactured for nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors , plutonium @-@ 239 is the most abundant isotope of plutonium by far . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Discovery = = = 
 Enrico Fermi and a team of scientists at the University of Rome reported that they had discovered element 94 in 1934 . Fermi called the element hesperium and mentioned it in his Nobel Lecture in 1938 . The sample was actually a mixture of barium , krypton , and other elements , but this was not known at the time . Nuclear fission was discovered in Germany in 1939 by Fritz Strassmann and Otto Hahn . The mechanism of fission was then theoretically explained by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch . 
 Plutonium ( specifically , plutonium @-@ 238 ) was first produced and isolated on December 14 , 1940 , and chemically identified on February 23 , 1941 , by Glenn T. Seaborg , Edwin McMillan , Joseph W. Kennedy , and Arthur Wahl by deuteron bombardment of uranium in the 60 @-@ inch ( 150 cm ) cyclotron at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory at the University of California , Berkeley . In the 1940 experiment , neptunium @-@ 238 was created directly by the bombardment but decayed by beta emission with a half @-@ life of a little over two days , which indicated the formation of element 94 . 
 A paper documenting the discovery was prepared by the team and sent to the journal Physical Review in March 1941 , but publication was delayed until a year after the end of World War II due to security concerns . At the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge , Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather realized that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would theoretically produce substantial amounts of plutonium @-@ 239 as a by @-@ product . They calculated that element 94 would be fissile , and had the added advantage of being chemically different from uranium , and could easily be separated from it . 
 McMillan had recently named the first transuranic element neptunium after the planet Neptune , and suggested that element 94 , being the next element in the series , be named for what was then considered the next planet , Pluto . Nicholas <unk> of the Cambridge team independently proposed the same name , based on the same reasoning as the Berkeley team . Seaborg originally considered the name " <unk> " , but later thought that it did not sound as good as " plutonium . " He chose the letters " Pu " as a joke , which passed without notice into the periodic table . Alternative names considered by Seaborg and others were " <unk> " or " <unk> " because of the erroneous belief that they had found the last possible element on the periodic table . 
 = = = Early research = = = 
 The basic chemistry of plutonium was found to resemble uranium after a few months of initial study . Early research was continued at the secret Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago . On August 20 , 1942 , a trace quantity of this element was isolated and measured for the first time . About 50 micrograms of plutonium @-@ 239 combined with uranium and fission products was produced and only about 1 microgram was isolated . This procedure enabled chemists to determine the new element 's atomic weight . On December 2 , 1942 , on a racket court under the west grandstand at the University of Chicago 's Stagg Field , researchers headed by Enrico Fermi achieved the first self @-@ sustaining chain reaction in a graphite and uranium pile known as CP @-@ 1 . Using theoretical information garnered from the operation of CP @-@ 1 , DuPont constructed an air @-@ cooled experimental production reactor , known as X @-@ 10 , and a pilot chemical separation facility at Oak Ridge . The separation facility , using methods developed by Glenn T. Seaborg and a team of researchers at the Met Lab , removed plutonium from uranium irradiated in the X @-@ 10 reactor . Information from CP @-@ 1 was also useful to Met Lab scientists designing the water @-@ cooled plutonium production reactors for Hanford . Construction at the site began in mid @-@ 1943 . 
 In November 1943 some plutonium trifluoride was reduced to create the first sample of plutonium metal : a few micrograms of metallic beads . Enough plutonium was produced to make it the first synthetically made element to be visible with the unaided eye . 
 The nuclear properties of plutonium @-@ 239 were also studied ; researchers found that when it is hit by a neutron it breaks apart ( fissions ) by releasing more neutrons and energy . These neutrons can hit other atoms of plutonium @-@ 239 and so on in an exponentially fast chain reaction . This can result in an explosion large enough to destroy a city if enough of the isotope is concentrated to form a critical mass . 
 During the early stages of research , animals were used to study the effects of radioactive substances on health . These studies began in 1944 at the University of California at Berkeley ’ s Radiation Laboratory and were conducted by Joseph G. Hamilton . Hamilton was looking to answer questions about how plutonium would vary in the body depending on exposure mode ( oral ingestion , inhalation , absorption through skin ) , retention rates , and how plutonium would be fixed in tissues and distributed among the various organs . Hamilton started administering soluble microgram portions of plutonium @-@ 239 compounds to rats using different valence states and different methods of introducing the plutonium ( oral , intravenous , etc . ) . Eventually , the lab at Chicago also conducted its own plutonium injection experiments using different animals such as mice , rabbits , fish , and even dogs . The results of the studies at Berkeley and Chicago showed that plutonium 's physiological behavior differed significantly from that of radium . The most alarming result was that there was significant deposition of plutonium in the liver and in the " actively metabolizing " portion of bone . Furthermore , the rate of plutonium elimination in the excreta differed between species of animals by as much as a factor of five . Such variation made it extremely difficult to estimate what the rate would be for human beings . 
 = = = Production during the Manhattan Project = = = 
 During World War II the U.S. government established the Manhattan Project , which was tasked with developing an atomic bomb . The three primary research and production sites of the project were the plutonium production facility at what is now the Hanford Site , the uranium enrichment facilities at Oak Ridge , Tennessee , and the weapons research and design laboratory , now known as Los Alamos National Laboratory . 
 The first production reactor that made plutonium @-@ 239 was the X @-@ 10 Graphite Reactor . It went online in 1943 and was built at a facility in Oak Ridge that later became the Oak Ridge National Laboratory . 
 In January 1944 , workers laid the foundations for the first chemical separation building , T Plant located in 200 @-@ West . Both the T Plant and its sister facility in 200 @-@ West , the U Plant , were completed by October . ( U Plant was used only for training during the Manhattan Project . ) The separation building in 200 @-@ East , B Plant , was completed in February 1945 . The second facility planned for 200 @-@ East was canceled . Nicknamed Queen Marys by the workers who built them , the separation buildings were awesome canyon @-@ like structures 800 feet long , 65 feet wide , and 80 feet high containing forty process pools . The interior had an eerie quality as operators behind seven feet of concrete shielding manipulated remote control equipment by looking through television monitors and periscopes from an upper gallery . Even with massive concrete lids on the process pools , precautions against radiation exposure were necessary and influenced all aspects of plant design . 
 On April 5 , 1944 , Emilio Segrè at Los Alamos received the first sample of reactor @-@ produced plutonium from Oak Ridge . Within ten days , he discovered that reactor @-@ bred plutonium had a higher concentration of the isotope plutonium @-@ 240 than cyclotron @-@ produced plutonium . Plutonium @-@ 240 has a high spontaneous fission rate , raising the overall background neutron level of the plutonium sample . The original gun @-@ type plutonium weapon , code @-@ named " Thin Man " , had to be abandoned as a result — the increased number of spontaneous neutrons meant that nuclear pre @-@ detonation ( fizzle ) was likely . 
 The entire plutonium weapon design effort at Los Alamos was soon changed to the more complicated implosion device , code @-@ named " Fat Man " . With an implosion weapon , plutonium is compressed to a high density with explosive lenses — a technically more daunting task than the simple gun @-@ type design , but necessary to use plutonium for weapons purposes . Enriched uranium , by contrast , can be used with either method . 
 Construction of the Hanford B Reactor , the first industrial @-@ sized nuclear reactor for the purposes of material production , was completed in March 1945 . B Reactor produced the fissile material for the plutonium weapons used during World War II . B , D and F were the initial reactors built at Hanford , and six additional plutonium @-@ producing reactors were built later at the site . 
 By the end of January 1945 , the highly purified plutonium underwent further concentration in the completed chemical isolation building , where remaining impurities were removed successfully . Los Alamos received its first plutonium from Hanford on February 2 . While it was still by no means clear that enough plutonium could be produced for use in bombs by the war 's end , Hanford was by early 1945 in operation . Only two years had passed since Col. Franklin Matthias first set up his temporary headquarters on the banks of the Columbia River . 
 According to Kate Brown , the plutonium production plants at Hanford and <unk> in Russia , over a period of four decades , " both released more than 200 million curies of radioactive isotopes into the surrounding environment — twice the amount expelled in the Chernobyl disaster in each instance " . Most of this radioactive contamination over the years were part of normal operations , but unforeseen accidents did occur and plant management kept this secret , as the pollution continued unabated . 
 In 2004 , a safe was discovered during excavations of a burial trench at the Hanford nuclear site . Inside the safe were various items , including a large glass bottle containing a whitish slurry which was subsequently identified as the oldest sample of weapons @-@ grade plutonium known to exist . Isotope analysis by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory indicated that the plutonium in the bottle was manufactured in the X @-@ 10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge during 1944 . 
 = = = Trinity and Fat Man atomic bombs = = = 
 The first atomic bomb test , codenamed " Trinity " and detonated on July 16 , 1945 , near Alamogordo , New Mexico , used plutonium as its fissile material . The implosion design of " the gadget " , as the Trinity device was code @-@ named , used conventional explosive lenses to compress a sphere of plutonium into a supercritical mass , which was simultaneously showered with neutrons from the " Urchin " , an initiator made of polonium and beryllium ( neutron source : ( α , n ) reaction ) . Together , these ensured a runaway chain reaction and explosion . The overall weapon weighed over 4 tonnes , although it used just 6 @.@ 2 kg of plutonium in its core . About 20 % of the plutonium used in the Trinity weapon underwent fission , resulting in an explosion with an energy equivalent to approximately 20 @,@ 000 tons of TNT . 
 An identical design was used in the " Fat Man " atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki , Japan , on August 9 , 1945 , killing 35 @,@ 000 – 40 @,@ 000 people ( most of whom were industrial workers ) and destroying 68 % – 80 % of war production at Nagasaki . Only after the announcement of the first atomic bombs was the existence and name of plutonium made known to the public by the Manhattan Project 's Smyth Report . 
 = = = Cold War use and waste = = = 
 Large stockpiles of weapons @-@ grade plutonium were built up by both the Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War . The U.S. reactors at Hanford and the Savannah River Site in South Carolina produced 103 tonnes , and an estimated 170 tonnes of military @-@ grade plutonium was produced in the USSR . Each year about 20 tonnes of the element is still produced as a by @-@ product of the nuclear power industry . As much as 1000 tonnes of plutonium may be in storage with more than 200 tonnes of that either inside or extracted from nuclear weapons . SIPRI estimated the world plutonium stockpile in 2007 as about 500 tonnes , divided equally between weapon and civilian stocks . 
 Radioactive contamination at the Rocky Flats Plant primarily resulted from two major plutonium fires in 1957 and 1969 . Much lower concentrations of radioactive isotopes were released throughout the operational life of the plant from 1952 to 1992 . Prevailing winds from the plant carried airborne contamination south and east , into populated areas northwest of Denver . The contamination of the Denver area by plutonium from the fires and other sources was not publicly reported until the 1970s . According to a 1972 study coauthored by Edward Martell , " In the more densely populated areas of Denver , the Pu contamination level in surface soils is several times fallout " , and the plutonium contamination " just east of the Rocky Flats plant ranges up to hundreds of times that from nuclear tests . " As noted by Carl Johnson in <unk> , " Exposures of a large population in the Denver area to plutonium and other radionuclides in the exhaust plumes from the plant date back to 1953 . " Weapons production at the Rocky Flats plant was halted after a combined FBI and EPA raid in 1989 and years of protests . The plant has since been shut down , with its buildings demolished and completely removed from the site . 
 In the U.S. , some plutonium extracted from dismantled nuclear weapons is melted to form glass logs of plutonium oxide that weigh two tonnes . The glass is made of <unk> mixed with cadmium and gadolinium . These logs are planned to be encased in stainless steel and stored as much as 4 km ( 2 mi ) underground in bore holes that will be back @-@ filled with concrete . The U.S. planned to store plutonium in this way at the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository , which is about 100 miles ( 160 km ) north @-@ east of Las Vegas , Nevada . 
 On March 5 , 2009 , Energy Secretary Steven Chu told a Senate hearing " the Yucca Mountain site no longer was viewed as an option for storing reactor waste . " Starting in 1999 , military @-@ generated nuclear waste is being entombed at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico . 
 In a Presidential Memorandum dated January 29 , 2010 , President Obama established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America 's Nuclear Future . In their final report the Commission put forth recommendations for developing a comprehensive strategy to pursue , including : 
 " Recommendation # 1 : The United States should undertake an integrated nuclear waste management program that leads to the timely development of one or more permanent deep geological facilities for the safe disposal of spent fuel and high @-@ level nuclear waste " . 
 = = = Medical experimentation = = = 
 During and after the end of World War II , scientists working on the Manhattan Project and other nuclear weapons research projects conducted studies of the effects of plutonium on laboratory animals and human subjects . Animal studies found that a few milligrams of plutonium per kilogram of tissue is a lethal dose . 
 In the case of human subjects , this involved injecting solutions containing ( typically ) five micrograms of plutonium into hospital patients thought to be either terminally ill , or to have a life expectancy of less than ten years either due to age or chronic disease condition . This was reduced to one microgram in July 1945 after animal studies found that the way plutonium distributed itself in bones was more dangerous than radium . Most of the subjects , Eileen <unk> says , were poor , powerless , and sick . 
 From 1945 to 1947 , eighteen human test subjects were injected with plutonium without informed consent . The tests were used to create diagnostic tools to determine the uptake of plutonium in the body in order to develop safety standards for working with plutonium . Ebb Cade was an unwilling participant in medical experiments that involved injection of 4 @.@ 7 micrograms of Plutonium on 10 April 1945 at Oak Ridge , Tennessee . This experiment was under the supervision of Harold Hodge . Other experiments directed by the United States Atomic Energy Commission and the Manhattan Project continued into the 1970s . The Plutonium Files chronicles the lives of the subjects of the secret program by naming each person involved and discussing the ethical and medical research conducted in secret by the scientists and doctors . The episode is now considered to be a serious breach of medical ethics and of the Hippocratic Oath . 
 The government covered up most of these radiation mishaps until 1993 , when President Bill Clinton ordered a change of policy and federal agencies then made available relevant records . The resulting investigation was undertaken by the president ’ s Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments , and it uncovered much of the material about plutonium research on humans . The committee issued a controversial 1995 report which said that " wrongs were committed " but it did not condemn those who perpetrated them .

 The isotope plutonium @-@ 239 is a key fissile component in nuclear weapons , due to its ease of fission and availability . Encasing the bomb 's plutonium pit in a tamper ( an optional layer of dense material ) decreases the amount of plutonium needed to reach critical mass by reflecting escaping neutrons back into the plutonium core . This reduces the amount of plutonium needed to reach criticality from 16 kg to 10 kg , which is a sphere with a diameter of about 10 centimeters ( 4 in ) . This critical mass is about a third of that for uranium @-@ 235 . 
 The Fat Man plutonium bombs used explosive compression of plutonium to obtain significantly higher densities than normal , combined with a central neutron source to begin the reaction and increase efficiency . Thus only 6 @.@ 2 kg of plutonium was needed for an explosive yield equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT . Hypothetically , as little as 4 kg of plutonium — and maybe even less — could be used to make a single atomic bomb using very sophisticated assembly designs .

 Spent nuclear fuel from normal light water reactors contains plutonium , but it is a mixture of plutonium @-@ 242 , 240 , 239 and 238 . The mixture is not sufficiently enriched for efficient nuclear weapons , but can be used once as MOX fuel . Accidental neutron capture causes the amount of plutonium @-@ 242 and 240 to grow each time the plutonium is irradiated in a reactor with low @-@ speed " thermal " neutrons , so that after the second cycle , the plutonium can only be consumed by fast neutron reactors . If fast neutron reactors are not available ( the normal case ) , excess plutonium is usually discarded , and forms the longest @-@ lived component of nuclear waste . The desire to consume this plutonium and other transuranic fuels and reduce the radiotoxicity of the waste is the usual reason nuclear engineers give to make fast neutron reactors . 
 The most common chemical process , PUREX ( Plutonium – URanium EXtraction ) reprocesses spent nuclear fuel to extract plutonium and uranium which can be used to form a mixed oxide ( MOX ) fuel for reuse in nuclear reactors . Weapons @-@ grade plutonium can be added to the fuel mix . MOX fuel is used in light water reactors and consists of 60 kg of plutonium per tonne of fuel ; after four years , three @-@ quarters of the plutonium is burned ( turned into other elements ) . Breeder reactors are specifically designed to create more fissionable material than they consume . 
 MOX fuel has been in use since the 1980s , and is widely used in Europe . In September 2000 , the United States and the Russian Federation signed a Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement by which each agreed to dispose of 34 tonnes of weapons @-@ grade plutonium . The U.S. Department of Energy plans to dispose of 34 tonnes of weapons @-@ grade plutonium in the United States before the end of 2019 by converting the plutonium to a MOX fuel to be used in commercial nuclear power reactors . 
 MOX fuel improves total burnup . A fuel rod is reprocessed after three years of use to remove waste products , which by then account for 3 % of the total weight of the rods . Any uranium or plutonium isotopes produced during those three years are left and the rod goes back into production . The presence of up to 1 % gallium per mass in weapons @-@ grade plutonium alloy has the potential to interfere with long @-@ term operation of a light water reactor . 
 Plutonium recovered from spent reactor fuel poses little proliferation hazard , because of excessive contamination with non @-@ fissile plutonium @-@ 240 and plutonium @-@ 242 . Separation of the isotopes is not feasible . A dedicated reactor operating on very low burnup ( hence minimal exposure of newly formed plutonium @-@ 239 to additional neutrons which causes it to be transformed to heavier isotopes of plutonium ) is generally required to produce material suitable for use in efficient nuclear weapons . While " weapons @-@ grade " plutonium is defined to contain at least 92 % plutonium @-@ 239 ( of the total plutonium ) , the United States have managed to detonate an under @-@ <unk> device using plutonium believed to contain only about 85 % plutonium @-@ 239 , so called ' " fuel @-@ grade " plutonium . The " reactor @-@ grade " plutonium produced by a regular LWR burnup cycle typically contains less than 60 % Pu @-@ 239 , with up to 30 % parasitic Pu @-@ 240 / Pu @-@ 242 , and 10 – 15 % fissile Pu @-@ 241 . It is unknown if a device using plutonium obtained from reprocessed civil nuclear waste can be detonated , however such a device could hypothetically fizzle and spread radioactive materials over a large urban area . The IAEA conservatively classifies plutonium of all isotopic vectors as " direct @-@ use " material , that is , " nuclear material that can be used for the manufacture of nuclear explosives components without transmutation or further enrichment " . 
 = = = Power and heat source = = = 
 The isotope plutonium @-@ 238 has a half @-@ life of 87 @.@ 74 years . It emits a large amount of thermal energy with low levels of both gamma rays / particles and spontaneous neutron rays / particles . Being an alpha emitter , it combines high energy radiation with low penetration and thereby requires minimal shielding . A sheet of paper can be used to shield against the alpha particles emitted by plutonium @-@ 238 . One kilogram of the isotope can generate about 570 watts of heat . 
 These characteristics make it well @-@ suited for electrical power generation for devices that must function without direct maintenance for timescales approximating a human lifetime . It is therefore used in radioisotope thermoelectric generators and radioisotope heater units such as those in the Cassini , Voyager , Galileo and New Horizons space probes , and the Curiosity Mars rover . 
 The twin Voyager spacecraft were launched in 1977 , each containing a 500 watt plutonium power source . Over 30 years later , each source is still producing about 300 watts which allows limited operation of each spacecraft . An earlier version of the same technology powered five Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Packages , starting with Apollo 12 in 1969 . 
 Plutonium @-@ 238 has also been used successfully to power artificial heart pacemakers , to reduce the risk of repeated surgery . It has been largely replaced by lithium @-@ based primary cells , but as of 2003 there were somewhere between 50 and 100 plutonium @-@ powered pacemakers still implanted and functioning in living patients . Plutonium @-@ 238 was studied as a way to provide supplemental heat to scuba diving . Plutonium @-@ 238 mixed with beryllium is used to generate neutrons for research purposes . 
 = = Precautions = = 
 = = = Toxicity = = = 
 There are two aspects to the harmful effects of plutonium : the radioactivity and the heavy metal poison effects . Isotopes and compounds of plutonium are radioactive and accumulate in bone marrow . Contamination by plutonium oxide has resulted from nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents , including military nuclear accidents where nuclear weapons have burned . Studies of the effects of these smaller releases , as well as of the widespread radiation poisoning sickness and death following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , have provided considerable information regarding the dangers , symptoms and prognosis of radiation poisoning , which in the case of the Japanese Hibakusha / survivors was largely unrelated to direct plutonium exposure . 
 During the decay of plutonium , three types of radiation are released — alpha , beta , and gamma . Alpha , beta , and gamma radiation are all forms of ionizing radiation . Either acute or longer @-@ term exposure carries a danger of serious health outcomes including radiation sickness , genetic damage , cancer , and death . The danger increases with the amount of exposure . Alpha radiation can travel only a short distance and cannot travel through the outer , dead layer of human skin . Beta radiation can penetrate human skin , but cannot go all the way through the body . Gamma radiation can go all the way through the body . Even though alpha radiation cannot penetrate the skin , ingested or inhaled plutonium does irradiate internal organs . The skeleton , where plutonium accumulates , and the liver , where it collects and becomes concentrated , are at risk . Plutonium is not absorbed into the body efficiently when ingested ; only 0 @.@ 04 % of plutonium oxide is absorbed after ingestion . Plutonium absorbed by the body is excreted very slowly , with a biological half @-@ life of 200 years . Plutonium passes only slowly through cell membranes and intestinal boundaries , so absorption by ingestion and incorporation into bone structure proceeds very slowly . 
 Plutonium is more dangerous when inhaled than when ingested . The risk of lung cancer increases once the total radiation dose equivalent of inhaled plutonium exceeds 400 mSv . The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that the lifetime cancer risk from inhaling 5 @,@ 000 plutonium particles , each about 3 µm wide , to be 1 % over the background U.S. average . Ingestion or inhalation of large amounts may cause acute radiation poisoning and death ; however no human is known to have died because of inhaling or ingesting plutonium , and many people have measurable amounts of plutonium in their bodies . 
 The " hot particle " theory in which a particle of plutonium dust <unk> a localized spot of lung tissue is not supported by mainstream research — such particles are more mobile than originally thought and toxicity is not measurably increased due to particulate form . When inhaled , plutonium can pass into the bloodstream . Once in the bloodstream , plutonium moves throughout the body and into the bones , liver , or other body organs . Plutonium that reaches body organs generally stays in the body for decades and continues to expose the surrounding tissue to radiation and thus may cause cancer . 
 A commonly cited quote by Ralph Nader states that a pound of plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere would be enough to kill 8 billion people . However , calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation . This makes the toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas . Nader 's views were challenged in 1976 by Bernard Cohen , as described in the book Nuclear Power , Both Sides : The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology . Cohen 's own estimate is that a dose of 200 micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer . 
 Several populations of people who have been exposed to plutonium dust ( e.g. people living down @-@ wind of Nevada test sites , Nagasaki survivors , nuclear facility workers , and " terminally ill " patients injected with Pu in 1945 – 46 to study Pu metabolism ) have been carefully followed and analyzed . These studies generally do not show especially high plutonium toxicity or plutonium @-@ induced cancer results , such as Albert Stevens who survived into old age after being injected with plutonium . " There were about 25 workers from Los Alamos National Laboratory who inhaled a considerable amount of plutonium dust during 1940s ; according to the hot @-@ particle theory , each of them has a 99 @.@ 5 % chance of being dead from lung cancer by now , but there has not been a single lung cancer among them . " 
 Plutonium has a metallic taste . 
 = = = Criticality potential = = = 
 Care must be taken to avoid the accumulation of amounts of plutonium which approach critical mass , particularly because plutonium 's critical mass is only a third of that of uranium @-@ 235 . A critical mass of plutonium emits lethal amounts of neutrons and gamma rays . Plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to moderation by the hydrogen in water . 
 Criticality accidents have occurred in the past , some of them with lethal consequences . Careless handling of tungsten carbide bricks around a 6 @.@ 2 kg plutonium sphere resulted in a fatal dose of radiation at Los Alamos on August 21 , 1945 , when scientist Harry Daghlian received a dose estimated to be 5 @.@ 1 sievert ( 510 rems ) and died 25 days later . Nine months later , another Los Alamos scientist , Louis Slotin , died from a similar accident involving a beryllium reflector and the same plutonium core ( the so @-@ called " demon core " ) that had previously claimed the life of Daghlian . 
 In December 1958 , during a process of purifying plutonium at Los Alamos , a critical mass was formed in a mixing vessel , which resulted in the death of a chemical operator named Cecil Kelley . Other nuclear accidents have occurred in the Soviet Union , Japan , the United States , and many other countries . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Metallic plutonium is a fire hazard , especially if the material is finely divided . In a moist environment , plutonium forms hydrides on its surface , which are pyrophoric and may ignite in air at room temperature . Plutonium expands up to 70 % in volume as it oxidizes and thus may break its container . The radioactivity of the burning material is an additional hazard . Magnesium oxide sand is probably the most effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire . It cools the burning material , acting as a heat sink , and also blocks off oxygen . Special precautions are necessary to store or handle plutonium in any form ; generally a dry inert gas atmosphere is required . 
 = = Transportation = = 
 Around 11 metric tons of plutonium may be possessed by Japan alone , with 36 tons pending return after reprocessing in Britain and France . This is probably enough to make 6 @,@ 000 atomic bombs . 
 = = = Land and sea = = = 
 The usual transportation of plutonium is through the more stable plutonium oxide in a sealed package . A typical transport consists of one truck carrying one protected shipping container , holding a number of packages with a total weight varying from 80 to 200 kg of plutonium oxide . A sea shipment may consist of several containers , each of them holding a sealed package . The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission dictates that it must be solid instead of powder if the contents surpass 0 @.@ 74 TBq ( 20 Curie ) of radioactive activity . In a recent example , the Pacific Egret and Pacific Heron of Pacific Nuclear Transport Ltd. are taking 331 kg ( 730 lbs ) of plutonium to a United States government facility in Savannah River , South Carolina . 
 = = = Air = = = 
 The U.S. Government air transport regulations permit the transport of plutonium by air , subject to restrictions on other dangerous materials carried on the same flight , packaging requirements , and stowage in the rearmost part of the aircraft . 
 In 2012 media revealed that plutonium has been flown out of Norway on commercial passenger airlines — around every other year — including one time in 2011 . Regulations permit an airplane to transport 15 grams of fissionable material . Such plutonium transportation is without problems , according to a Senior Advisor ( <unk> ) at Statens <unk> . 
 = A History of British Birds = 
 A History of British Birds is a natural history book by Thomas Bewick , published in two volumes . Volume 1 , " Land Birds " , appeared in 1797 . Volume 2 , " Water Birds " , appeared in 1804 . A supplement was published in 1821 . The text in " Land Birds " was written by Ralph Beilby , while Bewick took over the text for the second volume . The book is admired mainly for the beauty and clarity of Bewick 's wood engravings , which are widely considered his finest work , and among the finest in that medium . 
 British Birds has been compared to works of poetry and literature . It plays a recurring role in Charlotte Brontë 's novel Jane Eyre . William Wordsworth praised Bewick in the first lines of his poem " The Two Thieves " : " Oh now that the genius of Bewick were mine , And the skill which he learned on the banks of the Tyne . " 
 The book was effectively the first " field guide " for non @-@ specialists . Bewick provides an accurate illustration of each species , from life if possible , or from skins . The common and scientific name ( s ) are listed , citing the naming authorities . The bird is described , with its distribution and behaviour , often with extensive quotations from printed sources or correspondents . Those who provided skins or information are acknowledged . The species are grouped into families such as " Of the Falcon " , using the limited and conflicting scientific sources of the time . The families of land birds are further grouped into birds of prey , omnivorous birds , insectivorous birds , and granivorous birds , while the families of water birds are simply listed , with related families side by side . 
 Each species entry begins on a new page ; any spaces at the ends of entries are filled with tail @-@ pieces , small , often humorous woodcuts of country life . British Birds remains in print , and has attracted the attention of authors such as Jenny Uglow . Critics note Bewick 's skill as a naturalist as well as an engraver . 
 = = Approach = = 
 The preface states that " while one of the editors [ Thomas Bewick ] of this work was engaged in preparing the cuts , which are faithfully drawn from Nature , and engraved upon wood , the compilation of the descriptions .. ( of the Land Birds ) was undertaken by the other [ Ralph Beilby ] , subject , however , to the corrections of his friend , whose habits had led him to a more intimate acquaintance with this branch of Natural History " , and goes on to mention that the compilation of text was the " production of those hours which could be spared from a laborious employment " , namely the long hours of work engraving the minutely detailed wood printing blocks . What the preface does not say is the reason for this statement about the " editors " , which was an angry stand @-@ off between Bewick and Beilby , caused by Beilby 's intention to have an introduction which merely thanked Bewick for his " assistance " , and a title page naming Beilby as the sole author . Bewick 's friend ( and his wife 's godfather ) Thomas Hornby heard of this , and informed Bewick . An informal trade panel met to judge the matter , and the preface was the result ; and Beilby 's name did not appear on the title page . 
 Each species of bird is presented in a few pages ( generally between two and four ; occasionally , as with the mallard or " Common Wild Duck " , a few more ) . First is a woodcut of the bird , always either perched or standing on the ground , even in the case of water birds – such as the <unk> – that ( as winter visitors ) do not nest in Britain , and consequently are rarely seen away from water there . Bewick then presents the name , with variations , and the Latin and French equivalents . For example , " The Musk Duck " is also named on the line below as " Cairo , Guinea , or Indian Duck " , and the next line " ( Anas moschata , Linn . — Le Canard Musque , Buff . ) " provides the scholarly references to the giving of the Latin binomial by Linn [ <unk> ] and a French description by Buff [ on ] . 
 The text begins by stating the size of the bird . Bewick then describes the bird , typically in one paragraph , naming any notable features such as the colour of the eyes ( " irides " ) , the bill , the legs , and plumage on each part of the body . Next , the origin and distribution of the species are discussed , with notes or quotations from authorities such as John Ray , Gilbert White and Buffon . 
 Bewick then mentions any other facts of interest about the bird ; in the case of the musk duck , this concerns its " musky smell , which arises from the liquor secreted in the glands on the rump " . If the bird hybridizes with other species , this is described , along with whether the hybrids are fertile ( " productive " ) . 
 Finally , Bewick acknowledges anyone who helped . The musk duck is stated to have been drawn from a " living specimen " which was however " excepting the head , entirely white " , unlike the " general appearance " shown in the woodcut ; the bird " was lent to this work by William Losh , Esq . , of Point Pleasant , near Newcastle " . Losh , one of Bewick 's many collaborators , was a wealthy partner in Losh , Wilson and Bell , manufacturers of chemicals and iron . Many of the birds , especially the rarer species , were necessarily illustrated from skins rather than from life . For example , for the Sabine 's snipe , " The author was favoured by N. A. Vigors , Esq . , [ who had described the supposed species ] with a preserved specimen , from which the above figure is taken . " In A Memoir ( posthumously published in 1862 ) , Bewick states that he intended to " stick to nature as closely as I could " , but admits that he had " in several cases " to rely on the stuffed " preserved skins " of his neighbour Richard Routledge Wingate . 
 The grouping of species gave Bewick difficulty , as the scientific sources of the time did not agree on how to arrange the species in families , or on a sequence or grouping of those families . Bewick for example uses family groups like " Of the Falcon " , in which he includes buzzards and sparrowhawks as well as what are now called falcons . The families of land birds are further grouped into birds of prey , omnivorous birds , insectivorous birds , and granivorous birds , while the families of water birds are simply listed , with what seemed to be related families , such as " Of the Anas " ( ducks ) and " Of the <unk> " ( <unk> ducks ) , side by side . 
 In this way the book takes the form of , and sets a precedent for , modern field guides . Indeed , the French naturalist François <unk> ( 1753 – 1830 ) assembled a field guide using Bewick 's woodcuts as early as 1800 . 
 Each account is closed with a miniature woodcut known from its position in the text as a tail @-@ piece . These small artworks depict aspects of country life , often with humorous subjects , but all with Bewick 's eye for detail , style , and precision . Some add to the illustration of the bird in question , as for example the heron , where the tail @-@ piece shows one heron catching an eel , and another flying away . The tail @-@ piece for Sabine 's snipe , a gamebird , shows a hunter firing , and a small bird falling to the ground . There is no exclusion of human life from the images : one tail @-@ piece depicts a works complete with smoking chimney beside a river .

 = = = Land birds = = = 
 The first volume " containing the History and Description of Land Birds " begins with a preface , an introduction , and a list of technical terms illustrated with Bewick 's woodcuts . The introduction begins : 
 In no part of the animal creation are the wisdom , the goodness , and the bounty of Providence displayed in a more lively manner than in the structure , formation , and various endowments of the feathered tribes . 
 The birds are divided into granivorous ( grain eating ) and carnivorous groups , which are explained in some detail . The speed , senses , flight , migration , pairing behaviour and feeding of birds are then discussed , with observations from <unk> and Gilbert White , whose Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne was published in 1789 . The pleasure of watching birds is mentioned : 
 To the practical ornithologist there arises a considerable gratification in being able to ascertain the distinguishing characters of birds as they appear at a distance , whether at rest , or during their flight ; for not only every genus has something peculiar to itself , but each species has its own appropriate marks , by which a judicious observer may discriminate almost with certainty . 
 Bewick also mentions conservation , in the context of the probable local extinction of a valuable resource : 
 " Both this and the Great Bustard are excellent eating , and would well repay the trouble of domestication ; indeed , it seems surprising , that we should suffer these fine birds to be in danger of total extinction , although , if properly cultivated , they might afford as excellent a repast as our own domestic poultry , or even as the Turkey , for which we are indebted to distant countries . " 
 The 1847 edition , revised with additional woodcuts and descriptions , is organized as follows , with the species grouped into families such as the shrikes :

 The second volume " containing the History and Description of Water Birds " begins with its own preface , and its own introduction . Bewick discusses the question of where many seabirds go to breed , revisits the subject of migration , and concludes with reflections on " an all @-@ wise Providence " as shown in Nature . 
 The 1847 edition is organized as follows : 
 Foreign Birds 
 The ' foreign birds ' are not grouped but just listed directly as species , from Bearded Vulture to Mino . Fifteen birds are included , with no description , and despite their placement in the table of contents , they appear at the front of the volume as an ' Appendix ' . 
 = = Reception = = 
 In 1805 , the British Critic wrote that it was " superfluous to <unk> much on the merits of a work " that everyone liked because of " the aptness of its descriptions , the accuracy of its figures , the spirit of its wood engravings , and the ingenious variety of its vignettes . " 
 The 1829 Magazine of Natural History commented that " Montagu 's Ornithological Dictionary and Bewick 's Birds .. have rendered [ the ] department of natural history popular throughout the land " . 
 Ibis , reviewing the Memoir of Thomas Bewick , written by himself in 1862 , compares the effect of Bewick and Gilbert White , writing " It was the pages of Gilbert White and the woodcuts of Bewick which first beguiled the English schoolboy to the observation of our feathered friends " , and " how few of our living naturalists but must gratefully acknowledge their early debt to White 's ' History ' and to the life @-@ like woodcuts of Bewick ! " The reviewer judges that " Probably we shall not wrong the cultivated annalist of Selborne by giving the first place to Bewick . " However , comparing them as people , " Bewick has not the slightest claim to rank with Gilbert White as a naturalist . White was what Bewick never was , a man of science ; but , if no naturalist , Bewick was a lover of nature , a careful observer , and a faithful copier of her ever @-@ varying forms . In this , and in this alone , lies his charm . " 
 The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica 's entry on Thomas Bewick describes " the British Birds " as " his great achievement , that with which his name is inseparably associated " , observing that " Bewick , from his intimate knowledge of the habits of animals acquired during his constant excursions into the country , was thoroughly qualified to do justice to this great task . " 
 British Birds , reviewing a " lavishly illustrated " British Library book on Bewick , writes that " No ornithologist will ever regard Thomas Bewick , known primarily for The History of British Birds ( 1797 – 1804 ) , as a naturalist of the same standing as contemporaries such as Edward Donovan , John Latham and James Bolton " , noting however that Bewick helped to define " a certain English Romantic sensibility " . More directly , the review notes that " Bewick was aware that his role was to offer a modest guide to birds that the common man not only could afford but would also want to possess . " Bewick was not " a scientist , but he was a perfectionist " . The book 's text was written by " failed author " Ralph Beilby , but the text is " almost extraneous " given Bewick 's masterpiece . 
 The Tate Gallery writes that Bewick 's " best illustrations ... are in his natural history books . The History of British Birds ( 2 vols , Newcastle upon Tyne , 1797 – 1804 ) reveals Bewick 's gifts as a naturalist as well as an engraver ( the artist was responsible for the text as well as the illustrations in the second volume ) . " The article notes that the book makes " extensive use of narrative tailpieces : vignettes in which manifold aspects of north @-@ country life are expressed with affection , humour and a genuine love of nature . In later years these miniature scenes came to be more highly regarded than the figures they accompany . " 
 Dissenting from the general tone of praise for Bewick , Jacob Kainen cites claims that " many of the best tailpieces in the History of British birds were drawn by Robert Johnson " , and that " the greater number of those contained in the second volume were engraved by Clennell . Granted that the outlook and the engraving style were Bewick 's , and that these were notable contributions , the fact that the results were so close to his own points more to an effective method of illustration than to the outpourings of genius . " Kainen argues that while competent , Bewick " was no Holbein , no Botticelli — it is absurd to think of him in such terms — but he did develop a fresh method of handling wood engraving . " 
 The Linnean Society writes that the History " shows that he was also an excellent naturalist , a meticulous observer of birds and animals in their habitats . " 
 The University of Maryland writes that " The Birds is specific to those species indigenous to Britain and is incredibly accurate due to Bewick 's personal knowledge of the habits of birds in the wild acquired during his frequent bird @-@ watching expeditions . " It adds that " Bewick 's woodcarvings are considered a pinnacle example of the medium . " 
 Jenny Uglow , writing in The Guardian , notes that " An added delight was the way he filled the blank spaces with ' tail @-@ pieces ' , tiny , witty , vivid scenes of ordinary life . " She describes the importance of Birds in Jane Eyre , and ends " He worked with precision and insight , in a way that we associate with poets such as Clare and Wordsworth , Gerard Manley Hopkins and Elizabeth Bishop . To Bewick , nature was the source of joy , challenge and perpetual consolation . In his woodcuts of birds and animals as well as his brilliant tail @-@ pieces , we can still feel this today . " However , in her biography of Bewick , she adds that " The country might be beautiful but it also stank : in his vignettes men relieve themselves in hedges and ruins , a woman holds her nose as she walks between the <unk> , and a farmyard privy shows that men are as filthy as the pigs they despise . " 
 Hilary Spurling , reviewing Uglow 's biography of Bewick in The Observer , writes that when Birds appeared , people all over Britain " became his pupils " . Spurling cites Charles Kingsley 's story of his father 's hunting friends from the New Forest mocking him for buying " a book ' about <unk> @-@ birds " , until , astonished , they saw the book and discovered " things they had known all their lives and never even noticed " . 
 John Brewer , writing in the London Review of Books , says that for his Birds , " Bewick had acquired national renown as the artist who most truthfully depicted the flora and fauna of the British countryside . " He adds that " Bewick 's achievement was both technical and aesthetic . " In his view , Bewick " reconciled nature , science and art . His engravings of British birds , which represent his work at its finest , are almost all rendered with the precision of the ornithologist : but they also portray the animals in their natural habitat – the grouse shelters in his covert , the green woodpecker perches on a gnarled branch , waders strut by streams ... " He observes that " Most of the best engravings include a figure , incident or building which draws the viewer 's eye beyond and behind the animal profile in the foreground . Thus the <unk> in the distant field pulls our gaze past the yellow wagtail ... "

 The History is repeatedly mentioned in Charlotte Brontë 's 1847 novel Jane Eyre . John Reed throws the History of British Birds at Jane when she is ten ; Jane uses the book as a place to which to escape , away from the painful Reed household ; and Jane also bases her artwork on Bewick 's illustrations . Jane and Mr Rochester use bird names for each other , including linnet , dove , skylark , eagle , and falcon . Brontë has Jane Eyre explain and quote Bewick : 
 I returned to my <unk> 's History of British Birds : the letterpress thereof I cared little for , generally speaking ; and yet there were certain introductory pages that , child as I was , I could not pass quite as a blank . They were those which treat of the haunts of sea @-@ fowl ; of ' the solitary rocks and promontories ' by them only inhabited ; of the coast of Norway , studded with isles from its southern extremity , the <unk> , or Naze , to the North <unk> 
 The English romantic poet William Wordsworth began his 1800 poem The Two Thieves ; or , the Last Stage of Avarice with the lines 
 Peter Hall 's 1974 film <unk> ( from the 1969 book by Ronald Blythe ) contains a scene where the grandfather as a young man is reaping a cornfield . He weeps when he accidentally crushes a bird 's egg , an image derived from Bewick 's tail @-@ piece woodcut for the partridge . The woodcut shows a reaper with a scythe , a dead bird and its nest of a dozen eggs on the ground under the scythe , which has just lifted . George Ewart Evans used the image on the title page of his 1956 book about <unk> ( near <unk> , on which ' <unk> ' is probably partly based ) .

 = Western Front ( World War I ) = 
 The Western Front was the main theatre of war during World War I. Following the outbreak of war in August 1914 , the German Army opened the Western Front first by invading Luxembourg and Belgium , then gaining military control of important industrial regions in France . The tide of the advance was dramatically turned with the Battle of the Marne . Following the race to the sea , both sides dug in along a meandering line of fortified trenches , stretching from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier with France . This line remained essentially unchanged for most of the war . 
 Between 1915 and 1917 there were several major offensives along this front . The attacks employed massive artillery bombardments and massed infantry advances . However , a combination of entrenchments , machine gun nests , barbed wire , and artillery repeatedly inflicted severe casualties on the attackers and counter @-@ attacking defenders . As a result , no significant advances were made . Among the most costly of these offensives were the Battle of Verdun , in 1916 , with a combined 700 @,@ 000 casualties ( estimated ) , the Battle of the Somme , also in 1916 , with more than a million casualties ( estimated ) , and the Battle of Passchendaele , in 1917 , with roughly 600 @,@ 000 casualties ( estimated ) . 
 In an effort to break the deadlock , this front saw the introduction of new military technology , including poison gas , aircraft and tanks . But it was only after the adoption of improved tactics that some degree of mobility was restored . The German Army 's Spring Offensive of 1918 was made possible by the Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk that marked the end of the conflict on the Eastern Front . Using the recently introduced infiltration tactics , the German armies advanced nearly 100 kilometres ( 60 miles ) to the west , which marked the deepest advance by either side since 1914 and very nearly succeeded in forcing a breakthrough . 
 In spite of the generally stagnant nature of this front , this theatre would prove decisive . The inexorable advance of the Allied armies during the second half of 1918 persuaded the German commanders that defeat was inevitable , and the government was forced to sue for conditions of an armistice . The terms of peace were agreed upon with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 . 
 = = 1914 — German invasion of France and Belgium = = 
 At the outbreak of the First World War , the German Army ( consisting in the West of seven field armies ) executed a modified version of the Schlieffen Plan , designed to quickly attack France through neutral Belgium before turning southwards to encircle the French army on the German border . Belgium 's neutrality was guaranteed by Britain under the 1839 Treaty of London ; this caused Britain to join the war at the expiration of its ultimatum at 11 pm GMT on 4 August . Armies under German generals Alexander von <unk> and Karl von Bülow attacked Belgium on 4 August 1914 . Luxembourg had been occupied without opposition on 2 August . The first battle in Belgium was the Siege of Liège , which lasted from 5 – 16 August . Liège was well fortified and surprised the German army under von Bülow with its level of resistance . However , German heavy artillery was able to ruin the key forts within a few days . Following the fall of Liège , most of the Belgian army retreated to Antwerp and Namur , with the Belgian capital , Brussels , falling to the Germans on 20 August . Although the German army bypassed Antwerp , it remained a threat to their flank . Another siege followed at Namur , lasting from about 20 – 23 August . 
 For their part , the French had five Armies deployed on their borders . The pre @-@ war French offensive plan , Plan XVII , was intended to capture Alsace @-@ Lorraine following the outbreak of hostilities . On 7 August the VII Corps attacked Alsace with its objectives being to capture Mulhouse and Colmar . The main offensive was launched on 14 August with 1st and 2nd Armies attacking toward <unk> @-@ Morhange in Lorraine . In keeping with the Schlieffen Plan , the Germans withdrew slowly while inflicting severe losses upon the French . The French advanced the 3rd and 4th Armies toward the Saar River and attempted to capture Saarburg , attacking Briey and <unk> , before being driven back . The French VII Corps captured Mulhouse after a brief engagement on 7 August , but German reserve forces engaged them in the Battle of Mulhouse and forced a French retreat . 
 The German army swept through Belgium , executing civilians and razing villages . The application of " collective responsibility " against a civilian population further galvanised the allies , and newspapers condemned the German invasion and the army 's violence against civilians and property , together called the " Rape of Belgium " . ( A modern author uses the term only in the narrower sense of describing the war crimes committed by the German army during this period . ) After marching through Belgium , Luxembourg and the Ardennes , the German Army advanced , in the latter half of August , into northern France where they met both the French army , under Joseph Joffre , and the initial six divisions of the British Expeditionary Force , under Sir John French . A series of engagements known as the Battle of the Frontiers ensued . Key battles included the Battle of Charleroi and the Battle of Mons . In the former battle the French 5th Army was almost destroyed by the German 2nd and 3rd Armies and the latter delayed the German advance by a day . A general Allied retreat followed , resulting in more clashes such as the Battle of Le Cateau , the Siege of Maubeuge and the Battle of St. Quentin ( Guise ) . 
 The German army came within 70 km ( 43 mi ) of Paris , but at the First Battle of the Marne ( 6 – 12 September ) , French and British troops were able to force a German retreat by exploiting a gap which appeared between the 1st and 2nd Armies , ending the German advance into France . The German army retreated north of the Aisne River and dug in there , establishing the beginnings of a static western front that was to last for the next three years . Following this German setback , the opposing forces tried to outflank each other in the Race for the Sea , and quickly extended their trench systems from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier . The resulting German @-@ occupied territory held 64 % of France 's pig @-@ iron production , 24 % of its steel manufacturing and 40 % of the total coal mining capacity , dealing a serious , but not crippling setback to French industry . 
 On the Entente side , the final lines were occupied by the armies of the Allied countries , with each nation defending a part of the front . From the coast in the north , the primary forces were from Belgium , the British Empire and France . Following the Battle of the Yser in October , the Belgian forces controlled a 35 km length of Belgium 's Flanders territory along the coast , known as the Yser Front , along the Yser river and the <unk> canal , from Nieuwpoort to <unk> . Stationed to the south was the sector of the British Expeditionary Force ( BEF ) . Here , from 19 October until 22 November , the German forces made their final breakthrough attempt of 1914 during the First Battle of Ypres . Heavy casualties were suffered on both sides but no breakthrough occurred . After the battle Erich von Falkenhayn reasoned that it was no longer possible for Germany to win the war , and on 18 November 1914 he called for a diplomatic solution , but Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann @-@ Hollweg , Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff disagreed . By Christmas , the BEF guarded a continual line from the La Bassée Canal to south of St. Eloi in the Somme valley . The greater part of the front , south to the border with Switzerland , was manned by French forces . 
 = = 1915 — Stalemate = = 
 Between the coast and the Vosges was a westward bulge in the trench line , named the Noyon salient for the captured French town at the maximum point of advance near Compiègne . Joffre 's plan for 1915 was to attack this German salient on both flanks to cut it off . The British would form the northern attack force by pressing eastward in Artois , while the French attacked in Champagne . 
 On 10 March , as part of what was intended as a larger offensive in the Artois region , the British army attacked at Neuve Chapelle in an effort to capture the Aubers Ridge . The assault was made by four divisions along a 3 @-@ kilometre ( 2 mi ) front . Preceded by a concentrated bombardment lasting 35 minutes , the initial assault made rapid progress and the village was captured within four hours . The advance then slowed because of problems with logistics and communications . The Germans then brought up reserves and counter @-@ attacked , forestalling the attempt to capture the ridge . Since the British had used about one @-@ third of their supply of artillery shells , General Sir John French blamed the failure on the shortage of shells , despite the success of the initial attack . 
 = = = Gas warfare = = = 
 All sides signed treaties ( the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 ) which prohibited the use of chemical weapons in warfare before World War I. In spite of this , World War I saw large @-@ scale chemical warfare . 
 In 1914 , there had been small @-@ scale attempts by both the French and Germans to use of various tear gases , which were not strictly prohibited by the early treaties , but which were also largely ineffective . The first use of more lethal chemical weapons was against the British near Belgian town of Ypres . 
 Despite the German plans to maintain the stalemate with the French and British , German commanders planned an offensive at Ypres , which the British had defended in November 1914 . This Second Battle of Ypres , April 1915 , was intended to divert attention from offensives in the Eastern Front and disrupt Franco @-@ British planning . After a two @-@ day bombardment , the Germans released 168 tons of chlorine gas onto the battlefield . Though primarily a powerful irritant , it can asphyxiate in high concentrations or prolonged exposure . Being heavier than air , the gas crept across no man 's land and drifted into the British trenches . The green @-@ yellow cloud started killing some defenders and those in the rear fled in panic , creating an undefended 6 @-@ kilometre @-@ wide ( 4 mi ) gap in the Allied line . The Germans were unprepared for the level of their success and lacked sufficient reserves to exploit the opening . Canadian troops quickly arrived and drove back the German advance . 
 The gas attack was repeated two days later and caused a 5 @-@ kilometre ( 3 mi ) withdrawal of the Franco @-@ British line , but the opportunity had been lost . The success of this attack would not be repeated , as the Allies countered by introducing gas masks and other countermeasures . An example of the success of these measures came a year later , on 27 April at <unk> 40 km ( 25 mi ) to the south of Ypres , where the 16th ( Irish ) Division withstood several German gas attacks . 
 The British retaliated , developing their own chlorine gas , and using it at the Battle of Loos in September , 1915 . <unk> winds and inexperience led to more British casualties from the gas than German . 
 French , British , and German forces all escalated the use of gas attacks through the rest of the war , developing the more deadly phosgene gas in 1915 , then the infamous mustard gas in 1917 , which could linger for days and could kill slowly and painfully . Countermeasures also improved , however , and the stalemate continued . 
 = = = Air warfare = = = 
 Aeroplanes specifically modified for aerial combat were introduced in 1915 . While planes had already been used in the war for scouting , on 1 April the French pilot Roland Garros became the first to shoot down an enemy plane by using a machine gun that shot forward through the propeller blades . This was achieved by crudely reinforcing the blades so bullets which hit them were deflected away . 
 Several weeks later Garros was forced to land behind German lines . His plane was captured and sent to Dutch engineer Anthony Fokker , who soon produced a significant improvement , the interrupter gear , in which the machine gun is synchronised with the propeller so it fires in the intervals when the blades of the propeller are out of the line of fire . This advance was quickly ushered into service , in the Fokker <unk> ( Eindecker , or monoplane , Mark 1 ) , the first single seat fighter aircraft to combine a reasonable maximum speed with an effective armament ; Max Immelmann scored the first confirmed kill in an Eindecker on 1 August . 
 This started a back @-@ and @-@ forth arms race , as both sides developed improved weapons , engines , airframes and materials , which continued until the end of the war . It also inaugurated the cult of the ace , the most famous being the Red Baron . Contrary to the myth , antiaircraft fire claimed more kills than fighters . 
 = = = Continued Entente attacks = = = 
 The final Entente offensive of the spring was fought at Artois , with the goal of trying to capture Vimy Ridge . The French 10th Army attacked on 9 May after a six @-@ day bombardment and advanced 5 kilometres ( 3 mi ) . However , they retreated as they had come into sights of machine gun nests and the German reinforcements fired artillery at the attackers . By 15 May the advance had been stopped , although the fighting continued until 18 June . 
 In May the German army captured a French document at La Ville @-@ aux @-@ Bois describing a new system of defence . Rather than relying on a heavily fortified front line , the defence is arranged in a series of echelons . The front line would be a thinly manned series of outposts , reinforced by a series of strongpoints and a sheltered reserve . If a slope was available , troops were deployed along the rear side for protection . The defence became fully integrated with command of artillery at the divisional level . Members of the German high command viewed this new scheme with some favour and it later became the basis of an elastic defence in depth doctrine against Entente attacks . 
 During autumn of 1915 , the " Fokker Scourge " began to have an effect on the battlefront as Allied spotter planes were nearly driven from the skies . These reconnaissance planes were used to direct gunnery and photograph enemy fortifications but now the Allies were nearly blinded by German fighters . However , the impact of German air superiority was diminished by their doctrinal reluctance to risk their pilots capture by fighting over Allied held territory . 
 In September 1915 the Entente allies launched another offensive , with the French attacking at Champagne and the British at Loos . The French had spent the summer preparing for this action , with the British assuming control of more of the front to release French troops for the attack . The bombardment , which had been carefully targeted by means of aerial photography , began on 22 September . The main French assault was launched on 25 September and at first made good progress , in spite of surviving wire entanglements and machine gun posts . Rather than retreating , the Germans adopted a new defence @-@ in @-@ depth scheme that consisted of a series of defensive zones and positions with a depth of up to 8 @.@ 0 km ( 5 mi ) . 
 On 25 September , the British began their assault at Loos , which was meant to supplement the larger Champagne attack . The attack was preceded by a four @-@ day artillery bombardment of 250 @,@ 000 shells and a release of 5 @,@ 100 cylinders of chlorine gas . The attack involved two corps in the main assault and two more corps performing diversionary attacks at Ypres . The British suffered heavy losses , especially due to machine gun fire , during the attack and made only limited gains before they ran out of shells . A renewal of the attack on 13 October fared little better . In December , British Field Marshal Sir John French was replaced by General Douglas Haig as commander of the British forces . 
 = = 1916 — Artillery duels and attrition = = 
 The German Chief of Staff , Erich von Falkenhayn , believed that a breakthrough might no longer be possible , and instead focused on forcing a French capitulation by inflicting massive casualties . His new goal was to " bleed France white " . 
 As such , he adopted two new strategies . The first was the use of unrestricted submarine warfare to cut off Allied supplies arriving from overseas . The second would be targeted , high @-@ casualty attacks against the French ground troops . To inflict the maximum possible casualties , he planned to attack a position from which the French could not retreat for reason of both strategic positions and national pride and thus trap the French . The town of Verdun was chosen for this because it was an important stronghold , surrounded by a ring of forts , that lay near the German lines and because it guarded the direct route to Paris . The operation was codenamed Gericht , German for " court " , but meant " place of execution " . 
 Falkenhayn limited the size of the front to 5 to 6 kilometres ( 3 to 4 mi ) to concentrate their firepower and to prevent a breakthrough from a counteroffensive . He also kept tight control of the main reserve , feeding in just enough troops to keep the battle going . In preparation for their attack , the Germans had amassed a concentration of aircraft near the fortress . In the opening phase , they swept the air space of enemy spotters which allowed the accurate German artillery spotters and bombers to operate without interference . However , by May , the French countered by deploying <unk> de chasse with superior Nieuport fighters . The tight air space over Verdun turned into an aerial battlefield , and illustrated the value of tactical air superiority , as each side sought to dominate air reconnaissance . 
 = = = Battle of Verdun = = = 
 The Battle of Verdun began on 21 February 1916 after a nine @-@ day delay due to snow and blizzards . After a massive eight @-@ hour artillery bombardment , the Germans did not expect much resistance as they slowly advanced on Verdun and its forts . However , heavy French resistance was encountered . The French lost control of Fort Douaumont . Nonetheless , French reinforcements halted the German advance by 28 February . 
 The Germans turned their focus to Le Mort Homme to the north from which the French were successfully shelling them . After some of the most intense fighting of the campaign , the hill was taken by the Germans in late May . After a change in French command at Verdun from the defensive @-@ minded Philippe Pétain to the offensive @-@ minded Robert Nivelle the French attempted to re @-@ capture Fort Douaumont on 22 May but were easily repulsed . The Germans captured Fort Vaux on 7 June and , with the aid of the gas <unk> , came within 1 kilometre ( 1 @,@ 100 yd ) of the last ridge over Verdun before stopping on 23 June . 
 Over the summer , the French slowly advanced . With the development of the rolling barrage , the French recaptured Fort Vaux in November , and by December 1916 they had pushed the Germans back 2 @.@ 1 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 3 mi ) from Fort Douaumont , in the process rotating 42 divisions through the battle . The Battle of Verdun — also known as the ' <unk> Machine of Verdun ' or ' Meuse Mill ' — became a symbol of French determination and self @-@ sacrifice . 
 = = = Battle of the Somme = = = 
 In the spring Allied commanders had been concerned about the ability of the French army to withstand the enormous losses at Verdun . The original plans for an attack around the river Somme were modified to let the British make the main effort . This would serve to relieve pressure on the French , as well as the Russians who had also suffered great losses . On 1 July , after a week of heavy rain , British divisions in Picardy launched an attack around the river Somme , supported by five French divisions on their right flank . The attack had been preceded by seven days of heavy artillery bombardment . The experienced French forces were successful in advancing but the British artillery cover had neither blasted away barbed wire , nor destroyed German trenches as effectively as was planned . They suffered the greatest number of casualties ( killed , wounded , and missing ) in a single day in the history of the British army , about 57 @,@ 000 . 
 Having assessed the air combat over Verdun , the Allies had new aircraft designed by Citroën engineer Andrew <unk> , for the attack in the Somme valley . The Verdun lesson learnt , the Allies ' tactical aim became the achievement of air superiority and the German planes were , indeed , largely swept from the skies over the Somme . The success of the Allied air offensive caused a reorganisation of the German air arm , and both sides began using large formations of aircraft rather than relying on individual combat . 
 After regrouping , the battle continued throughout July and August , with some success for the British despite the reinforcement of the German lines . By August General Haig had concluded that a breakthrough was unlikely , and instead switched tactics to a series of small unit actions . The effect was to straighten out the front line , which was thought necessary in preparation for a massive artillery bombardment with a major push . 
 The final phase of the battle of the Somme saw the first use of the tank on the battlefield . The Allies prepared an attack that would involve 13 British and Imperial divisions and four French corps . The attack made early progress , advancing 3 @,@ 200 to 4 @,@ 100 metres ( 3 @,@ 500 to 4 @,@ 500 yd ) in places , but the tanks had little effect due to their lack of numbers and mechanical unreliability . The final phase of the battle took place in October and early November , again producing limited gains with heavy loss of life . All told , the Somme battle had made penetrations of only 8 kilometres ( 5 mi ) , and failed to reach the original objectives . The British had suffered about 420 @,@ 000 casualties and the French around 200 @,@ 000 . It is estimated that the Germans lost 465 @,@ 000 , although this figure is controversial . 
 The Somme led directly to major new developments in infantry organisation and tactics ; despite the terrible losses of 1 July , some divisions had managed to achieve their objectives with minimal casualties . In examining the reasons behind losses and achievements , the British , and the Colonial contingents , reintroduced the concept of the infantry platoon , following in the footsteps of the French and German armies who were already groping their way towards the use of small tactical units . At the time of the Somme , British senior commanders insisted that the company ( 120 men ) was the smallest unit of manoeuvre ; less than a year later , the section of 10 men would be so . 
 = = = Hindenburg line = = = 
 In August 1916 the German leadership along the western front had changed as Falkenhayn resigned and was replaced by Generals Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff . The new leaders soon recognised that the battles of Verdun and the Somme had depleted the offensive capabilities of the German army . They decided that the German army in the west would go over to the strategic defensive for most of 1917 , while the Central powers would attack elsewhere . 
 During the Somme battle and through the winter months , the Germans created a prepared defensive position behind a section of their front that would be called the Hindenburg Line using the defensive principles elaborated since the defensive battles of 1915 , including the use of Eingreif divisions . This was intended to shorten the German front , freeing 10 divisions for other duties . This line of fortifications ran from Arras south to St Quentin and shortened the front by about 50 kilometres ( 30 mi ) . British long @-@ range reconnaissance aircraft first spotted the construction of the Hindenburg Line in November 1916 . 
 = = 1917 — British offensives = = 
 The Hindenburg Line was built between two and 50 kilometres ( 30 mi ) behind the German front line . On 9 February German forces retreated to the line and the withdrawal was completed 5 April , leaving behind a devastated territory to be occupied by the Allies . This withdrawal negated the French strategy of attacking both flanks of the Noyon salient , as it no longer existed . However , offensive advances by the British continued as the High Command claimed , with some justice , that this withdrawal resulted from the casualties the Germans received during the Battles of the Somme and Verdun , despite the Allies suffering greater losses . 
 Meanwhile , on 6 April the United States declared war on Germany . In early 1915 , following the sinking of the Lusitania , Germany had stopped its unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic because of concerns of drawing the United States into the conflict . With the growing discontent of the German public due to the food shortages , however , the government resumed unrestricted submarine warfare in February 1917 . They had calculated that a successful submarine and warship siege of Britain would force that country out of the war within six months , while American forces would take a year to become a serious factor on the Western Front . The submarine and surface ships had a long period of success before Britain resorted to the convoy system , bringing a large reduction in shipping losses . 
 By 1916 – 17 , the size of the British Army on the Western Front had grown to two @-@ thirds the total numbers in the French forces . In April 1917 the British Empire forces launched an attack starting the Battle of Arras . The Canadian Corps and the British 5th Division , attacked German lines at Vimy Ridge , capturing the heights . However , the rest of the offensive was halted with heavy losses . The Allied attack ended with the refusal to provide reinforcements to the region . 
 During the winter of 1916 – 17 , German air tactics had been improved , a fighter training school was opened at Valenciennes and better aircraft with twin guns were introduced . The result was near disastrous losses for Allied air power , particularly for the British , Portuguese , Belgians , and Australians who were struggling with outmoded aircraft , poor training and weak tactics . As a result , the Allied air successes over the Somme would not be repeated , and heavy losses were inflicted by the Germans . During their attack at Arras , the British lost 316 air crews and the Canadians lost 114 compared to 44 lost by the Germans . This became known to the RFC as Bloody April . 
 = = = French mutinies = = = 
 The same month , French General Robert Nivelle ordered a new offensive against the German trenches , promising that it would end the war within 48 hours . The 16 April attack , dubbed the Nivelle Offensive ( also known as Chemin des Dames , after the area where the offensive took place ) , would be 1 @.@ 2 million men strong , to be preceded by a week @-@ long artillery bombardment and accompanied by tanks . However , the operation proceeded poorly as the French troops , with the help of two Russian brigades , had to negotiate rough , upward @-@ sloping terrain . In addition , detailed planning had been dislocated by the voluntary German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line , secrecy had been compromised , and German planes gained control of the sky making reconnaissance difficult . This allowed the creeping barrage to move too far ahead of the advancing troops . Within a week 100 @,@ 000 French troops were dead . Despite the heavy casualties and his promise to halt the offensive if it did not produce a breakthrough , Nivelle ordered the attack continued into May . 
 On 3 May the weary French 2nd Colonial Division , veterans of the Battle of Verdun , refused their orders , arriving drunk and without their weapons . Lacking the means to punish an entire division , the officers of the division did not immediately implement harsh measures against the mutineers . Thereupon mutinies afflicted 54 French divisions and saw 20 @,@ 000 men desert . Other Allied forces attacked but suffered massive casualties . Appeals to patriotism and duty followed , as did mass arrests and trials . The French soldiers returned to defend their trenches , but refused to participate in further offensive action . On 15 May Nivelle was removed from command , replaced by General Philippe Pétain who immediately suspended large @-@ scale attacks . The French would go on the defensive for the following months to avoid high casualties and to restore confidence in the French High Command . 
 = = = British offensives , American troops arrive = = = 
 On 7 June a British offensive was launched on Messines Ridge , south of Ypres , to retake the ground lost in the First and Second Battles of Ypres in 1914 . Since 1915 specialist Royal Engineer tunnelling companies had been digging tunnels under the ridge , and about 500 tonnes ( roughly 500 @,@ 000 kg ) of explosives had been planted in 21 mines under the enemy lines . Following four days of heavy bombardment , the explosives in 19 of these mines were detonated , resulting in the deaths of 10 @,@ 000 Germans . The offensive that followed again relied on heavy bombardment which allowed the British infantry to capture the ridge in one day . The limited offensive was a great success , all German counter @-@ attacks were defeated and the southern flank of the Gheluvelt plateau protected from German observation . 
 On 11 July 1917 during this battle , the Germans introduced a new weapon into the war when they fired gas shells delivered by artillery . The limited size of an artillery shell required that a more potent gas be deployed , and so the Germans employed mustard gas , a powerful blistering agent . The artillery deployment allowed heavy concentrations of the gas to be used on selected targets . Mustard gas was also a persistent agent , which could linger for up to several days at a site , an additional demoralising factor for their opponents . Along with phosgene , mustard gas would be used extensively by both German and Allied forces in later battles , as the Allies also began to increase production of gas for chemical warfare . 
 On 25 June the first US troops began to arrive in France , forming the American Expeditionary Force . However , the American units did not enter the trenches in divisional strength until October . The incoming troops required training and equipment before they could join in the effort , and for several months American units were relegated to support efforts . In spite of this , however , their presence provided a much @-@ needed boost to Allied morale . 
 Beginning on 31 July and continuing to 10 November the struggle around Ypres was renewed with the Battle of Passchendaele ( technically the Third Battle of Ypres , of which Passchendaele was the final phase ) . The battle had the original aim of capturing the ridges east of Ypres then advancing to Roulers and <unk> to close the main rail line supplying the German garrisons of the Western front and the Belgian coast then capturing the German submarine bases on the Belgian coast , but was later restricted to advancing the British Army onto the ridges around Ypres , as the unusually wet weather slowed British progress . Canadian veterans from the Battle of Vimy Ridge and the Battle of Hill 70 relieved the two ANZAC Corps and other British forces and took the village of Passchendaele on 6 November , despite extremely heavy rain and casualties . The offensive produced large numbers of casualties on both sides for relatively little gain of ground against dogged German resistance , yet that captured was of great tactical importance and the British made inexorable gains during periods of drier weather . The ground was generally muddy and pocked by shell craters , making supply missions and further advancement very difficult . 
 Both sides lost a combined total of over a half million men during this offensive . The battle has become a byword among some British historians for bloody and futile slaughter , whilst the Germans called Passchendaele " the greatest martyrdom of the War " . It is one of the two battles ( the other is the Battle of the Somme ) which have done most to earn British Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig his controversial reputation . 
 = = = Battle of Cambrai = = = 
 On 20 November the British launched the first massed tank attack during the Battle of Cambrai . The Allies attacked with 324 tanks , with one @-@ third held in reserve , and twelve divisions , against two German divisions . To maintain surprise , there was no preparatory bombardment ; only a curtain of smoke was laid down before the tanks . The machines carried fascines on their fronts to bridge trenches and 4 @-@ metre @-@ wide ( 13 ft ) German tank traps . Special " grapnel tanks " towed hooks to pull away the German barbed wire . The initial attack was a success for the British . The British forces penetrated further in six hours than had been achieved at the Third Ypres in four months , and at a cost of only 4 @,@ 000 British casualties . 
 However , the advance produced an awkward salient and a surprise German counteroffensive on 30 November drove the British back to their starting lines . Despite the reversal , the attack had been seen as a success by the Allies and Germans as it proved that tanks could overcome trench defences . The battle had also seen the first massed use of German <unk> on the Western front , who used infantry infiltration tactics to successfully penetrate the Allied lines , bypassing resistance and quickly advancing into the enemy 's rear . 
 = = 1918 — Final offensives = = 
 Following the successful Allied attack and penetration of the German defences at Cambrai , Ludendorff and Hindenburg determined that the only opportunity for German victory now lay in a decisive attack along the Western front during the spring , before American manpower became a significant presence . On 3 March 1918 , the Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk was signed , and Russia withdrew from the war . This would now have a dramatic effect on the conflict as 33 divisions were now released from the Eastern Front for deployment to the West . However , the Germans occupied almost as much Russian territory under the provisions of the Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk as they did in the Second World War : this considerably restricted their troop redeployment . Nonetheless , they still had an advantage of 192 divisions to the Allied 178 divisions , which allowed Germany to pull veteran units from the line and retrain them as <unk> . In contrast , the Allies still lacked a unified command and suffered from morale and manpower problems : the British and French armies were sorely depleted , and American troops had not yet transitioned into a combat role . 
 Ludendorff 's strategy would be to launch a massive offensive against the British and Commonwealth designed to separate them from the French and her allies , then drive them back to the channel ports . The attack would combine the new storm troop tactics with ground attack aircraft , tanks , and a carefully planned artillery barrage that would include gas attacks . 
 = = = German spring offensives = = = 
 Operation Michael , the first of the German Spring Offensives , very nearly succeeded in driving the Allied armies apart , advancing about 60 kilometres ( 40 mi ) during the first eight days and moving the front lines more than 100 kilometres ( 60 mi ) west , within shelling distance of Paris for the first time since 1914 . 
 As a result of the battle , the Allies finally agreed on a unified system of command . General Ferdinand Foch was appointed commander of all Allied forces in France . The unified Allies were now better able to respond to each of the German drives , and the offensive turned into a battle of attrition . 
 In May , the American divisions also began to play an increasing role , winning their first victory in the Battle of <unk> . By summer , 300 @,@ 000 American soldiers were arriving every month . A total of 2 @.@ 1 million American troops would be deployed on this front before the war came to an end . The rapidly increasing American presence served as a counter for the large numbers of redeployed German forces . 
 = = = Final allied counter @-@ offensives = = = 
 In July , Foch initiated a counter @-@ offensive against the Marne salient produced during the German attacks , eliminating the salient by August . A second major offensive was launched two days after the first , ending at Amiens to the north . This attack included Franco @-@ British forces , and was spearheaded by Australian and Canadian troops , along with 600 tanks and supported by 800 aircraft . The assault proved highly successful , leading Hindenburg to name 8 August as the " Black Day of the German Army " . The Italian 2nd Army Corps , commanded by general <unk> <unk> , also participated in the operations around Reims . 
 The German army 's manpower had been severely depleted after four years of war , and its economy and society were under great internal strain . The Entente now fielded a total of 216 divisions against 197 understrength German divisions . The Hundred Days Offensive beginning in August proved the final straw , and following this string of military defeats , German troops began to surrender in large numbers . As the Allied forces broke the German lines , Prince Maximilian of Baden was appointed as Chancellor of Germany in October to negotiate an armistice . Because of his opposition to the peace feelers , Ludendorff was forced to step aside and he fled to Sweden . Fighting was still continuing , but the German armies were in retreat when the German Revolution put a new government in power . An armistice was quickly signed , that stopped all fighting on the Western Front on Armistice Day ( 11 November 1918 ) . The German Imperial Monarchy collapsed as General Groener ( Ludendorff 's successor ) backed the moderate Social Democratic Government under Friedrich Ebert , rather than face the possibility of a revolution like that in Russia the previous year . 
 = = Consequences = = 
 The war along the Western Front led the German government and its allies to sue for peace in spite of German success elsewhere . As a result , the terms of the peace were dictated by France , Britain and the United States , during the 1919 Paris Peace Conference . The result was the Treaty of Versailles , signed in June 1919 by a delegation of the new German government . 
 The terms of the treaty would effectively cripple Germany as an economic and military power . The Versailles treaty returned the border provinces of Alsace @-@ Lorraine to France , thus limiting the coal required by German industry . The Saar , which formed the west bank of the Rhine , would be demilitarised and controlled by Britain and France , while the Kiel Canal opened to international traffic . The treaty also drastically reshaped Eastern Europe . It severely limited the German armed forces by restricting the size of the army to 100 @,@ 000 and disallowing a navy or air force . The navy was sailed to Scapa Flow under the terms of surrender but was later scuttled , under the order of German admirals , as a reaction to the treaty . 
 Germany in 1919 was bankrupt , the people living in a state of semi @-@ starvation and having no commerce with the remainder of the world . The Allies occupied the Rhine cities of Cologne , Koblenz and Mainz , with restoration dependent on payment of reparations . Among the German populace , the myth arose — openly cultivated by the Army Chief of Staff Hindenburg — that the defeat was not the fault of the ' good core ' of the army but due to certain left @-@ wing groups within Germany ; this would later be exploited by Nazi party propaganda to partly justify the overthrow of the Weimar Republic . See Stab @-@ in @-@ the @-@ back legend . 
 France suffered heavy damage in the war . In addition to losing more casualties relative to its population than any other great power , the industrial north @-@ east of the country had been devastated by the war . The provinces overrun by Germany had produced 40 % of the nation 's coal and 58 percent of its steel output . Once it was clear that Germany was going to be defeated , Ludendorff had ordered the destruction of the mines in France and Belgium . His goal was to cripple the industries of Germany 's main European rival . To prevent similar German attacks in the future , France later built a massive series of fortifications along the German border known as the Maginot Line . 
 The war in the trenches of the Western Front had left a generation of maimed soldiers and war widows . The unprecedented loss of life had a lasting effect on popular attitudes toward war , resulting later in an Allied reluctance to pursue an aggressive policy toward Adolf Hitler ( a decorated veteran of the war ) .

 = Monmouth Rebellion = 
 The Monmouth Rebellion , also known as The Revolt of the West or The West Country rebellion , was an attempt to overthrow James II , the Duke of York who had become King of England , Scotland , and Ireland upon the death of his elder brother Charles II on 6 February 1685 . James II was a Roman Catholic , and some Protestants under his rule opposed his kingship . James Scott , 1st Duke of Monmouth , an illegitimate son of Charles II , claimed to be rightful heir to the throne and attempted to displace James II . 
 Plans were discussed for several different actions to overthrow the monarch , following the failure of the Rye House Plot to assassinate Charles II and James , in 1683 , while Monmouth was in self @-@ imposed exile in the Dutch Republic . The Monmouth rebellion was coordinated with a rebellion in Scotland , where Archibald Campbell , the Earl of Argyll , landed with a small force . The Duke of Monmouth had been popular in the South West of England , so he planned to recruit troops locally and take control of the area before marching on London . 
 Monmouth landed at Lyme Regis on 11 June 1685 . In the following few weeks , his growing army of nonconformists , artisans , and farm workers fought a series of skirmishes with local militias and regular soldiers commanded by Louis de Duras , 2nd Earl of Feversham , and John Churchill , who later became the Duke of Marlborough . Monmouth 's forces were unable to compete with the regular army and failed to capture the key city of Bristol . The rebellion ended with the defeat of Monmouth 's army at the Battle of Sedgemoor on 6 July 1685 by forces led by Feversham and Churchill . 
 Monmouth was executed for treason on 15 July 1685 . Many of his supporters were tried during the Bloody Assizes , led by Judge Jeffreys , and were condemned to death or transportation . James II was then able to consolidate his power . He reigned until 1688 , when he was overthrown in a coup d 'état by William of Orange in the Glorious Revolution . 
 = = Duke of Monmouth = = 
 Monmouth was an illegitimate son of Charles II . There had been rumours that Charles had married Monmouth 's mother , Lucy Walter , but no evidence was forthcoming , and Charles always said that he only had one wife , Catherine of Braganza . 
 Monmouth had been appointed Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the English Army by his father in 1672 and Captain general in 1678 , enjoying some successes in the Netherlands in the Third Anglo @-@ Dutch War . 
 = = Context = = 
 The English Civil War had left resentment among some of the population about the monarchy and the penalties which had been imposed on the supporters of the Commonwealth . The South West of England contained several towns where opposition remained strong . Fears of a potential Catholic monarch persisted , intensified by the failure of Charles II and his wife to produce any children . A defrocked Anglican clergyman , Titus Oates , spoke of a " Popish Plot " to kill Charles and to put the Duke of York on the throne . The Earl of Shaftesbury , a former government minister and a leading opponent of Catholicism , attempted to have James excluded from the line of succession . Some members of Parliament even proposed that the crown go to Charles 's illegitimate son , James Scott , who became the Duke of Monmouth . In 1679 , with the Exclusion Bill - which would exclude the King 's brother and heir presumptive , James , Duke of York , from the line of succession - in danger of passing , Charles II dissolved Parliament . Two further Parliaments were elected in 1680 and 1681 , but were dissolved for the same reason . 
 After the Rye House Plot of 1683 , an attempt to assassinate both Charles and James , Monmouth went into self @-@ imposed exile in the Netherlands , and gathered supporters in The Hague . Monmouth was a Protestant and had toured the South West of England in 1680 , where he had been greeted amicably by crowds in towns such as Chard and Taunton . So long as Charles II remained on the throne , Monmouth was content to live a life of pleasure in Holland , while still hoping to accede peaceably to the throne . The accession of James II and coronation at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1685 put an end to these hopes . 
 = = Plan = = 
 The Monmouth rebellion was planned in Holland and coordinated with another rebellion in Scotland led by Archibald Campbell , the Earl of Argyll . Several areas of England were considered as potential locations for rebellion , including Cheshire and Lancashire along with the South West , as these were seen as having the highest number of opponents of the monarchy . Argyll and Monmouth both began their expeditions from Holland , where James 's nephew and son @-@ in @-@ law , William of Orange , had not detained them or put a stop to their recruitment efforts . Argyll sailed to Scotland and , on arriving there , raised recruits mainly from his own clan , the Campbells , as part of the Scottish revolt . He had previously been involved in the Rye House Plot of 1683 . 
 Another important member of the rebellion was Robert Ferguson , a fanatical Scottish Presbyterian minister . He was also known as " the plotter " . It was Ferguson who drew up Monmouth 's proclamation , and he who was most in favour of Monmouth being crowned King . Thomas Hayward Dare was a goldsmith from Taunton and a Whig politician , a man of considerable wealth and influence who had been jailed during a political campaign calling for a new parliament . He was also fined the huge sum of £ 5 @,@ 000 for uttering " seditious " words . After his release from jail , he fled to Holland and became the paymaster general to the Rebellion . 
 To raise the funds for ships and weaponry , Monmouth pawned many of his belongings . His wife Anne Scott , 1st Duchess of Buccleuch , and her mother also pawned their jewellery to hire the Dutch warship <unk> . 
 = = From Lyme Regis to Sedgemoor = = 
 On 30 May 1685 Monmouth set sail for South West England , a strongly Protestant region , with three small ships , four light field guns , and 1500 muskets . He landed on 11 June with 82 supporters , including Lord Grey of <unk> , Nathaniel Wade , and Andrew Fletcher of <unk> . They gathered about 300 men on the first day at Lyme Regis in Dorset , where a long statement prepared by Ferguson denounced the king . 
 King James had previously received intelligence about the impending plot , and the ships leaving Holland ten days before . He was warned of Monmouth 's arrival soon after the first landing . The mayor of the town , Gregory Alford , informed the local militias while Samuel <unk> and another customs officer rode from Lyme to London , arriving on 13 June , having ridden 200 miles ( 322 km ) . To face Monmouth 's rebels , John Churchill was given command of the regular foot in the King 's army , and the honour of leading the campaign passed to Earl of Feversham . It would take a few days to assemble the army and travel from London to the west country , therefore initial defence was left to local militias . 
 Over the next couple of days volunteers arrived in Lyme offering to serve under Monmouth . By 15 June he had a force in excess of 1 @,@ 000 men . On 13 June he lost two of his leading supporters when Dare and Fletcher disputed who should ride one of the best horses provided by local supporters . Fletcher shot and killed Dare and was then put under arrest and sent back to the frigate <unk> . The next day , 40 cavalry and 400 foot soldiers , under the command of Lord Grey and Wade , moved on to the nearby town of Bridport , where they encountered 1 @,@ 200 men from the local royalist Dorset militia . The skirmish ended with the retreat of Grey and the cavalry followed by Wade with the foot soldiers . Many of the militiamen deserted and joined Monmouth 's army . Following this confrontation , Lord Albermarle led a royalist force from Exeter towards the forces of the Duke of Somerset , who were approaching Lyme Regis from the opposite direction . 
 Monmouth learned of the approach of royalist reinforcements and departed , but instead of marching to London , he headed north with his force towards the county of Somerset . On 15 June he fought with the militia at Axminster , taking the town before the militias could join up . More recruits joined his disorganised force , which was now around 6 @,@ 000 , consisting mostly of nonconformists , artisans , and farm workers armed with farm tools ( such as pitchforks ) . One famous supporter was the young Daniel Defoe . 
 Monmouth again denounced the king in Chard and was the subject of a coronation in Taunton on 20 June 1685 , against the wishes of some of his republican supporters such as Wade . The Taunton Corporation was forced to witness the event at sword point outside the White Hart Inn , to encourage the support of the country gentry . In Taunton , Monmouth was joined by many new supporters and formed a new regiment of 800 men . The king 's force of Dragoons under Churchill continued to close on Monmouth , arriving in Chard on 19 June . With the assistance of the local militias they attempted to stop new recruits arriving in Taunton to join Monmouth . Feversham meanwhile moved with his forces into Bristol , on the assumption that this would be Monmouth 's next target , and took overall charge of the campaign . 
 Monmouth and his growing force then continued north via Bridgwater , where he took up residence at Bridgwater Castle ( 21 June ) , Glastonbury ( 22 June ) and Shepton Mallet ( 23 June ) in worsening weather . Meanwhile , the Royal Navy captured Monmouth 's ships , cutting off any hope of an escape back to the continent . The Royalist forces of Churchill , who was now in Chard , and of Feversham , in Bristol , also received reinforcements who had marched from London . 
 On 24 June , Monmouth 's army encamped at Pensford , and a small force skirmished with the Gloucester Militia to take control of Keynsham , a vital crossing point over the River Avon . Monmouth intended to attack the city of Bristol ( the largest and most important city after London at that time ) . However , he heard the city had been occupied by Henry Somerset , 1st Duke of Beaufort . There were inconclusive skirmishes with a force of Life Guards commanded by Feversham . These attacks gave the impression that there was a much larger royalist force in the vicinity then there actually was . Several historians have speculated that if Monmouth had marched as quickly as possible for Bristol at this point , when it was only protected by the Gloucestershire militia , he would probably have been able to take the city and the final outcome of the rebellion might have been very different . Once Bristol had been taken , more recruits would have been attracted to the Rebellion and a later march on London would have been possible . 
 Monmouth left his headquarters at Keynsham Abbey and moved towards Bath , which had also been occupied by royalist troops , making entry into the city impossible . Monmouth camped in Philips Norton ( now Norton St Philip ) , where his forces were attacked on 27 June by the leading elements of Feversham 's forces , which had now combined into a larger force , but were still awaiting their artillery . The Duke of Grafton led some cavalry , dragoons , and 500 musketeers into the village , where they were surrounded by the rebels and had to hack through hedges to escape . They were rescued by Churchill and withdrew with approximately 20 losses on each side ; however each side believed that the other had taken greater losses . 
 Monmouth then marched overnight to Frome arriving on 28 June . The morale of Monmouth 's forces started to collapse as news of the failure of the rebellion in Scotland arrived that day , while the makeshift army was camped in Frome . Argyll 's small force had been involved in minor skirmishes at Greenock and <unk> . He took <unk> castle , but after disagreements with key supporters about when and where to fight the royalists commanded by Rosse and William Cleland , his supporters dwindled away and the Scottish rebellion failed . 
 The rebels , heading for Warminster got as far as Trowbridge , but royalist forces cut off the route and Monmouth turned back towards Somerset through Shepton Mallet , arriving in Wells on 1 July . The soldiers damaged the Bishop 's Palace and west front of Wells Cathedral , tearing lead from the roof to make bullets , breaking the windows , smashing the organ and the furnishings , and for a time stabling their horses in the nave . 
 Feversham aimed to contain the rebels in the South West until the rest of his forces , including three battalions from Holland arrived . In the light of propaganda suggesting the rebels had an army of 40 @,@ 000 and that 500 royalist troops had been lost at Norton St Philip , Feversham was ordered to engage Monmouth 's forces . On 30 June the final parts of Feversham 's army , including his artillery , arrived and eventually Monmouth was pushed back via Shepton Mallet to the Somerset Levels , where Alfred the Great had found refuge in his conflicts with the Vikings . Becoming hemmed in at Bridgwater on 3 July , he ordered his troops to fortify the town . 
 = = Battle of Sedgemoor = = 
 Monmouth was finally defeated by Feversham with John Churchill , his second in command , on 6 July at the Battle of Sedgemoor . 
 Once Monmouth 's force had entered and started to fortify Bridgwater , he sent some of his cavalry to collect six cannon from Minehead . He planned to stay in Bridgwater until they returned and then break out and head for Bristol . Feversham and his army of 500 horse and 1 @,@ 500 militiamen camped on the edge of Sedgemoor at the village of Westonzoyland . Monmouth could view them from the tower of Church of St Mary and may have inspected them more closely from the Church of St Mary in <unk> , before deciding to attack them . 
 The Duke eventually led his untrained and ill @-@ equipped troops out of Bridgwater at around 10 : 00 pm to undertake a night @-@ time attack on the King 's army . They were guided by Richard Godfrey , the servant of a local farmer , along the old Bristol road towards <unk> . With their limited cavalry in the vanguard , they turned south along <unk> Lane and Marsh Lane and came to the open moor with its deep and dangerous rhynes ( drainage ditches ) . 
 There was a delay while the rhyne was crossed and the first men across startled a royalist patrol . A shot was fired and a horseman from the patrol galloped off to report to Feversham . Lord Grey of <unk> led the rebel cavalry forward and they were engaged by the King 's Regiment of Horse which alerted the rest of the royalist forces . The superior training of the regular army and their horses routed the rebel forces by outflanking them . His untrained supporters were quickly defeated by the professionals , and hundreds were cut down by <unk> and musket @-@ fire . 
 The death count on the rebel side has variously been given as between 727 and 2 @,@ 700 , with royalist losses of 27 who were buried in the churchyard of the Church of St Mary the Virgin in Westonzoyland , which was used as a prison for rebel soldiers . 
 = = After Sedgemoor = = 
 Monmouth fled from the field of battle , but was captured in a ditch on 8 July ( either at Ringwood in the New Forest , or at Horton in Dorset ) . Parliament had passed an Act of Attainder , on 13 June sentencing Monmouth to death as a traitor , Therefore , no trial was needed before his execution . Despite begging for mercy and claims of conversion to Roman Catholicism , he was beheaded at Tower Hill by Jack Ketch on 15 July 1685 . It is said that it took multiple blows of the axe to sever his head . ( Though some sources say it took eight blows , the official Tower of London website says it took five blows , while Charles Spencer , in his book Blenheim , claims it was seven . ) His dukedoms of Monmouth and Buccleuch were forfeited , but the subsidiary titles of the dukedom of Monmouth were restored to the Duke of Buccleuch . 
 The subsequent Bloody Assizes of Judge Jeffreys were a series of trials of Monmouth 's supporters in which 320 people were condemned to death and around 800 sentenced to be transported to the West Indies . 
 James II took advantage of the suppression of the rebellion to consolidate his power . He asked Parliament to repeal the Test Act and the Habeas Corpus Act , used his dispensing power to appoint Roman Catholics to senior posts , and raised the strength of the standing army . Parliament opposed many of these moves , and on 20 November 1685 James dismissed it . In 1688 , when the birth of James Francis Edward Stuart heralded a Catholic succession , James II was overthrown in a coup d 'état by William of Orange in the Glorious Revolution at the invitation of the disaffected Protestant Establishment .

 = Tiridates I of Armenia = 
 Tiridates I ( Armenian : <unk> <unk> , <unk> A ; Parthian : <unk> , <unk> ; Greek : <unk> , <unk> ) was King of Armenia beginning in 53 AD and the founder of the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia . The dates of his birth and death are unknown . His early reign was marked by a brief interruption towards the end of the year 54 and a much longer one from 58 to 63 AD . In an agreement to resolve the Roman @-@ Parthian conflict in and over Armenia , Tiridates I ( one of the brothers of Vologases I of Parthia ) was crowned king of Armenia by the Roman emperor Nero in 66 AD ; in the future , the king of Armenia was to be a Parthian prince , but his appointment required approval from the Romans . Even though this made Armenia a client kingdom , various contemporary Roman sources thought that Nero had de facto ceded Armenia to the Parthian Empire . 
 In addition to being a king , Tiridates I was also a Zoroastrian priest and was accompanied by other magi on his journey to Rome in 66 AD . In the early 20th century , Franz Cumont speculated that Tiridates was instrumental in the development of <unk> which became the main religion of the Roman Army and spread across the whole empire . Furthermore , during his reign , he started reforming the administrative structure of Armenia , a reform which was continued by his successors , and which brought many Iranian customs and offices into it . 
 Tiridates I is one of the principal characters in George Frideric Handel 's opera Radamisto and Reinhard Keiser 's opera Octavia .

 Tiridates I was one of the sons born to Vonones II , king of Media Atropatene and later king of Parthia , by a Greek concubine . Virtually nothing is known about Tiridates ' youth , which he spent in Media Atropatene . " Tiridates " means " given by Tir " . Tir was the Armeno @-@ Parthian god of literature , science and art based on the Avestan Tishtrya and fused with the Greek Apollo . 
 In 51 AD the Roman procurator of Cappadocia , Julius <unk> , invaded Armenia and ravaged the country , then under an Iberian usurper Rhadamistus . Rhadamistus had killed his uncle Mithridates , the legitimate king of Armenia , by luring the Roman garrison that was protecting him outside of the fortress of <unk> . Acting without instruction , <unk> recognized Rhadamistus as the new king of Armenia . Syrian governor Ummidius Quadratus sent Helvidius Priscus with a legion to repair these outrages , but he was recalled so as not to provoke a war with Parthia . 
 In 52 AD King Vologases I of Parthia took the opportunity to invade Armenia , conquering Artaxata ( Artashat in Armenia ) and proclaiming his younger brother Tiridates I as king . This action violated the treaty that had been signed by the Roman emperor Augustus and Parthian king Phraates IV which gave the Romans the explicit right to appoint and crown the kings of Armenia . Vologases I considered the throne of Armenia to have been once the property of his ancestors , now usurped by a foreign monarch in virtue of a crime . A winter epidemic as well as an insurrection initiated by his son Vardanes forced him to withdraw his troops from Armenia , allowing Rhadamistus to come back and punish locals as traitors ; they eventually revolted and replaced him with the prince Tiridates I in early 55 . Rhadamistus escaped along with his wife Zenobia who was pregnant . Unable to continue fleeing , she asked her husband to end her life rather than be captured . Rhadamistus stabbed her with a Median dagger and flung her body into the river Araxes . Zenobia was not fatally injured and was recovered by shepherds who sent her to Tiridates . Tiridates I received her kindly and treated her as a member of the monarchy . Rhadamistus himself returned to Iberia and was soon put to death by his father Parasmanes I of Iberia for having plotted against the royal power . 
 = = War with Rome = = 
 Unhappy with the growing Parthian influence at their doorstep , Roman Emperor Nero sent General Corbulo with a large army to the east in order to restore Roman client kings . A Hasmonean named Aristobulus was given Lesser Armenia ( Nicopolis and Satala ) and Sohaemus of Emesa received Armenia Sophene . In the spring of 58 , Corbulo entered Greater Armenia from Cappadocia and advanced towards Artaxata , while Parasmanes I of Iberia attacked from the north , and Antiochus IV of Commagene attacked from the southwest . Supported by his brother , Tiridates I sent flying columns to raid the Romans far and wide . Corbulo retaliated using the same tactics and the use of the <unk> tribes who raided outlying regions of Armenia . Tiridates I fled from the capital , and Corbulo burned Artaxata to the ground . In the summer , Corbulo began moving towards Tigranocerta through rough terrain and passing through the <unk> ( Taron ) , where several of his commanders died in an ambush by the Armenian resistance ; however , the city opened its doors , with the exception of one of the citadels , which was destroyed in the ensuing assault . By this time the majority of Armenians had abandoned resistance and accepted the prince favored by Rome . 
 Nero gave the crown to the last royal descendant of the Kings of Cappadocia , the grandson of <unk> ( daughter of Archelaus of Cappadocia ) and Alexander of Judea ( the brother of Herod Archelaus and the son of Herod the Great ) , who assumed the Armenian name Tigranes ( his uncle was Tigranes V ) . His son , named Gaius Julius Alexander , married Iotapa , the daughter of Antiochus IV of Commagene and was made King of Cilicia . Nero was hailed vigorously in public for this initial victory and Corbulo was appointed governor of Syria as a reward . A guard of 1000 legionary soldiers , three auxiliary cohorts and two wings of horses were allotted to Tigranes in order to defend the country . Border districts were bestowed to Roman allies that assisted Corbulo including Polemon , Parasmanes , <unk> and Antiochus . 
 Vologases I was infuriated by the fact that an alien now sat on the Armenian throne but hesitated to reinstate his brother as he was engaged in a conflict with the Hyrcanians who were revolting . Tigranes invaded the Kingdom of Adiabene and deposed its King <unk> in 61 , who was a vassal of Parthians . 
 Vologases I considered this an act of aggression from Rome and started a campaign to restore Tiridates I to the Armenian throne . He placed under the command of <unk> <unk> a well @-@ disciplined force of cataphracts along with <unk> auxiliaries and ordered him to expel Tigranes from Armenia . Having quelled the <unk> revolt , Vologases I gathered the strength of his dominions and embarked toward Armenia . Corbulo , having been informed of the impending attack , sent two legions under the commands of <unk> Severus and Vettius <unk> to the assistance of Tigranes with secret directions that they should act with caution rather than vigour . He also dispatched a message to Nero , urging him to send a second commander with the explicit purpose of defending Armenia as Syria was now also in peril . Corbulo placed the remainder of the legions on the banks of the Euphrates and armed irregular troops of the nearby provinces . Since the region was deficient in water , he erected forts over the fountains and concealed the rivulets by heaping sand over them . 
 <unk> marched towards Tigranocerta but failed to break the defense of the city walls as his troops were unfit for a long siege . Corbulo , although eminently successful thought it prudent to use his good fortune with moderation . He sent a Roman centurion by the name of Casperius to the camp of Vologases I in Nisibis located 37 miles ( 60 km ) from Tigranocerta with the demand to raise the siege . Because of a recent locust storm and the scarcity of fodder for his horses Vologases I agreed to raise the siege of Tigranocerta and petitioned to be granted Armenia in order to achieve a firm peace . Vologases I demanded that both the Roman and Parthian troops should evacuate Armenia , that Tigranes should be dethroned , and that the position of Tiridates I be recognized . The Roman government declined to accede to these arrangements and sent Lucius Caesennius Paetus , governor of Cappadocia , to settle the question by bringing Armenia under direct Roman administration . 
 Paetus was an incapable commander and suffered a humiliating defeat at the Battle of Rhandeia in 62 , losing the legions of XII Fulminata commanded by Calvisius Sabinus and IIII Scythica commanded by <unk> <unk> . The command of the troops was returned to Corbulo , who the following year led a strong army into Melitene and beyond into Armenia , eliminating all of the regional governors he suspected were pro @-@ Parthian . Finally in Rhandeia , Corbulo and Tiridates I met to make a peace agreement . The location of Rhandeia suited both Tiridates I and Corbulo . It appealed to Tiridates I because that is where his army had beaten the Romans and sent them away under a capitulation ; on the other hand , it appealed to Corbulo because he was about to wipe out the ill repute earned before in the same location . When Tiridates I arrived at the Roman camp he took off his royal diadem and placed it on the ground near a statue of Nero , agreeing to receive it back only from Nero in Rome . Tiridates I was recognized as the vassal king of Armenia ; a Roman garrison would remain in the country permanently , in Sophene while Artaxata would be reconstructed . Corbulo left his son @-@ in @-@ law Annius <unk> to accompany Tiridates I to Rome in order to attest his own fidelity to Nero . 
 = = Visiting Rome = = 
 Prior to embarking for Rome , Tiridates I visited his mother and two brothers in Media Atropatene and Parthia . On his long trek he was accompanied by his wife and children and two of his brothers . His escort included an imposing retinue , comprising many feudal lords , several sages , 3 @,@ 000 Parthian horsemen , and also a large number of Romans . His route lay across Thrace , through Illyria , on the eastern shores of the Adriatic and Picenum , in northeastern Italy . The journey took nine months , and Tiridates I rode on horseback , with his children and queen at his side . The children of Vologases , <unk> and Pacorus also accompanied Tiridates I. 
 Cassius Dio , a second @-@ century Roman historian , described Tiridates I favorably at the time of his arrival : " Tiridates himself was in the prime of his life , a notable figure by reason of his youth , beauty , family , and intelligence . " Nero greeted Tiridates I at Neapolis ( Naples ) in October , sending a state chariot to carry the visitor over the last few miles . No one was allowed to approach the emperor armed , but Tiridates I maintained his dignity by refusing to remove his sword as he approached the ruler of the Roman Empire ( though as a compromise , he agreed to have his sword firmly fastened in the sheath , so that it could not be drawn ) . At <unk> ( modern Pozzuoli , near Naples ) Nero ordered athletic games to be staged in honor of his guest . The Armenian king himself had an opportunity to display his ability as a marksman by shooting an arrow through the bodies of two buffaloes . The event at <unk> also marked the first attested appearance of female gladiators : 
 Nero admired him for this action [ ( Tiridates ' refusal to remove his sword ) ] and entertained him in many ways , especially by giving a gladiatorial exhibition at Puteoli . It was under the direction of <unk> , one of his freedmen , who managed to make it a most brilliant and costly affair , as may be seen from the fact that on one of the days not a person but Ethiopians — men , women , and children — appeared in the theatre . 
 The climax of the ceremonies was reserved for the capital . Rome was profusely decorated with flags , torches , garlands and bunting , and was gorgeously illuminated at night with great crowds of people seen everywhere . 
 On the day after Tiridates I 's arrival , Nero came to the Forum clothed in triumphal vestments and surrounded by dignitaries and soldiers , all resplendent in expensive attire and glittering armor . While Nero sat on the imperial throne , Tiridates I and his retinue advanced between two lines of soldiers . Arriving in front of the dais , Tiridates I knelt , with hands clasped on his breast . After the thundering shouts and acclamations excited by this spectacle had subsided , Tiridates I addressed the emperor : 
 My Lord , I am a descendant of <unk> and the brother of the Kings Vologases and Pacorus . I have come to you who are my god ; I have worshipped you as the [ sun ] ; I shall be whatever you would order me to be , because you are my destiny and fortune . 
 To which Nero replied : 
 You have done well by coming here to enjoy my presence in person . What your father has not left to you and what your brothers did not preserve for you , I do accord to you , and I make you King of Armenia , so that you , as well as they , may know that I have the power to take away and to grant kingdoms . 
 Tiridates I then mounted the steps of the platform and knelt , while Nero placed the royal diadem on his head . As the young king was about to kneel a second time , Nero lifted him by his right hand and after kissing him , made him sit at his side on a chair a little lower than his own . Meanwhile , the populace gave tumultuous ovations to both rulers . A Praetor , speaking to the audience , interpreted and explained the words of Tiridates , who spoke in Greek . According to Pliny the Elder , Tiridates I then introduced Nero to <unk> feasts ( <unk> <unk> ) . Tacitus claimed that Tiridates I was also interested in all things Roman . 
 Public festivities continued for some time after the coronation ceremony . The interior of the Theatre of Pompey and every piece of its furniture was entirely gilded for the occasion ; for this reason , Rome thenceforth recalled that date as " the Golden Day . " Daytime festivities were on a scale no less lavish than those of the night : Royal purple awnings stretched as protection against the heat of the sun . Nero , clad in green and wearing a chariot driver 's headdress , took part in a chariot race . At the evening banquets , Nero , in gold @-@ embroidered vestments , sang and played the lyre with zither accompaniment . Tiridates I was amazed and disgusted by Nero 's extravagance , but he had only praise for Corbulo and expressed to Corbulo his surprise at his serving such a master . He made no concealment of his views to Nero 's face and said to him sarcastically : " Sire , you have a wonderful servant in the person of Corbulo . " 
 In memory of these events , the Senate honored Nero with the laurel wreath and the title of Imperator , or commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the armies . No reception comparable to this in magnitude and splendor is recorded in the history of Rome . Besides the enormous sum spent in festivities , the Roman Government bore the entire cost of the journey of Tiridates I and his retinue , both from and to their homeland . Nero also made a gift to Tiridates I of fifty million sesterces . 
 On his journey back to Armenia , Tiridates I viewed an exhibition of <unk> . When seeing that one of the contestants fell on his back and was being beaten by his opponents , Tiridates I saw exclaimed : " That 's an unfair contest . It isn 't fair that a man who has fallen should be beaten . " 
 Later , Nero summoned the Parthian King Vologases I to Rome several times , but when the invitations became burdensome to Vologases I , he sent back a dispatch to this effect : " It is far easier for you than for me to traverse so great a body of water . Therefore , if you will come to Asia , we can then arrange to meet each other . " 
 It has been suggested that the visit of Tiridates I , an event that greatly impressed contemporaries , was adapted by Christians to become the story of the adoration of the Christ Child by the Three Magi . The Christian legend changed Rome into Bethlehem , the birthplace of the Ruler of the coming Kingdom of God , and replaced Tiridates I with that contemporary king who was already connected with Christianity through the Acts of St. Thomas : <unk> , otherwise known as Kaspar . 
 = = Fragile Peace = = 
 Peace prevailed at this time throughout the Roman Empire . Nero therefore closed the gates of the Temple of Janus , which were never shut save in times of universal peace . When Tiridates I returned to Armenia , he took with him a great number of skilled artisans for the reconstruction of Artaxata . He renamed the capital <unk> in honor of the emperor ; he embellished the royal residence at Garni , nearby , with colonnades and monuments of dazzling richness and also the addition of a new temple . Trade between the two continents also grew , allowing Armenia to secure its independence from Rome . Rome now counted upon Armenia as a loyal ally , even after Nero 's death and through the entire duration of Vespasian 's rule in the East . Peace was a considerable victory for Nero politically . 
 The immediate dividend of the peace was Rome 's ability to turn its full attention to the mounting problems at Judea , which broke into open warfare culminating in the First Jewish @-@ Roman War just one year after Tiridates ' coronation . Large numbers of legions were diverted to Judea from Syria , which would otherwise have been impossible . Nero became very popular in the eastern provinces of Rome and with the Armenians and Parthians . The name of Legio XII Fulminata discovered carved on a mountain in <unk> ( in modern Azerbaijan ) , attests to the presence of Roman soldiers by the shores of the Caspian Sea in 89 AD , farther east than any previously known Roman inscription . The peace between Parthia and Rome lasted 50 years , until emperor Trajan invaded Armenia in 114 . 
 = = War with Alans and aftermath = = 
 In 72 the Alans , a warlike nomadic Sarmatian tribe , made an incursion into Media Atropatene as well as various districts of northern Armenia . Tiridates I and his brother Pacorus , King of Media Atropatene , faced them at a number of battles , during one of which Tiridates I was briefly captured , narrowly escaping being taken alive . He was lassoed from a distance and caught , but he quickly managed to whip out his sword and slash the rope in time . The Alans withdrew with a lot of booty after plundering Armenia and Media Atropatene . The King of Iberia asked for protection against the Alans from Vespasian , who helped reconstruct the fortress of <unk> around the Iberian capital Mtskheta , near modern Tbilisi . An Aramaic inscription found near Tbilisi indicates that Tiridates I also warred with Iberia during his final years . The exact date of the end of Tiridates I 's reign is unknown ; various sources name Sanatruces as his successor . It is known that Tiridates ' nephew , <unk> , the son of Pacorus II of Parthia , was King of Armenia by 110 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Franz Cumont in Les <unk> Orientales dans le <unk> Romain ( " The Oriental Religions in Roman Paganism " ) pointed out that Tiridates I was instrumental in the development of <unk> in Rome , which ultimately became the most dominant Roman religion throughout the empire .

 = Cad and the Dandy = 
 Cad and the Dandy is an independent tailoring company based in London , England with premises on Savile Row and in the City . It sells bespoke suits , manufactured from English and Italian fabrics , and using traditional tailoring methods , at a lower price than the traditional Savile Row houses . The company was founded in 2008 by James Sleater and Ian <unk> ; two City of London bankers who , at the height of the 2008 financial crisis , were both made redundant from their jobs . It has attracted local , national and international press coverage , including being listed by The Guardian in the Courvoisier Future 500 , and in July 2010 the founders won the Bento Entrepreneur of the Year Award at the Macworld Awards . 
 = = History = = 
 Cad and the Dandy was founded in 2008 . The founders met through a supplier as both pursued a similar business idea independently , and they agreed to work together to start the company , each contributing £ 20 @,@ 000 of initial capital . Both had family connections to the tailoring industry , giving them knowledge helpful in launching the new company . 
 After initially conducting fittings in rented office space , they came to an arrangement with <unk> & Morgan to allow appointments in their shop on Savile Row . In October 2009 , the company opened its first permanent store in the City of London . 
 The company achieved a turnover of £ 1.3M in 2010 , and was listed by The Guardian in the Courvoisier Future 500 . In July 2010 the founders won the Bento Entrepreneur of the Year Award at the Macworld Awards and in July 2013 they opened permanent premises on Savile Row .

 Based in London , where the company employs 10 tailors in three workshops , it also employs an additional 40 in a workshop in China where most of its entry @-@ level , machine @-@ sewn suits are made . All suits are made from British or Italian cloth , and are available either in " machine grade " or " hand stitched " . Suit prices vary based on the cloth that is used as well as the amount of hand @-@ stitching that is done on the suit . The fully hand @-@ made suits require around 50 hours of stitching , include a basted fitting , and conform to all the specifications for a bespoke suit suggested by the Savile Row Bespoke Association . Prices are kept lower than the average for bespoke tailors by requiring payment up @-@ front . This allows Cad and the Dandy to negotiate discounts of 30 % to 40 % with their suppliers . 
 Cad & the Dandy launched a new flagship store at 13 Savile Row in June 2013 . The store is the first on the iconic tailoring street to hand @-@ weave a cloth before making it up into a fully finished suit . Believing that Britain ’ s bespoke tailoring industry was facing a shortage of master tailors , the company established an apprenticeship programme in London , with young would @-@ be tailors joining Cad & the Dandy ’ s 22 staff members at its three London locations , Savile Row , Birchin Lane and Canary Wharf .

 = Astral Weeks = 
 Astral Weeks is the second studio album by Northern Irish singer @-@ songwriter Van Morrison . It was recorded at Century Sound Studios in New York City during three sessions in September and October 1968 , although most participants and biographers agree that the eight songs were culled from the first and last early evening sessions . Except for John Payne , Morrison and the assembled jazz musicians had not played together before and the recordings commenced without rehearsals or lead sheets handed out . 
 The cover art , music and lyrics of the album portray the symbolism equating earthly love and heaven that would often feature in Morrison 's work . When Astral Weeks was released by Warner Bros. Records in November 1968 , it did not receive promotion from the label and was not an immediate success with consumers or critics . Blending folk , blues , jazz , and classical music , the album 's songs signaled a radical departure from the sound of his previous pop hits , such as " Brown Eyed Girl " ( 1967 ) . 
 Astral Weeks ' critical standing eventually improved greatly , however , and it has since been viewed as one of rock music 's greatest and most important records ( a reputation Morrison himself has dismissed ) . Sometimes referred to as a song cycle or concept album , critics laud the album 's arrangements and songwriting ; Morrison 's lyrics are often described as impressionistic , hypnotic , and modernist . It was placed on numerous widely circulated lists of the best albums of all time and had an enduring impact on both listeners and musicians . Forty years after the album 's release , Morrison performed all eight of its songs live for the first time during two Hollywood Bowl concerts in November 2008 . 
 = = Background = = 
 At the beginning of 1968 , Van Morrison became involved in a contract dispute with Bang Records that kept him away from any recording activity . This occurred after the sudden death of the label 's founder Bert Berns . Born with a congenital heart defect , Berns had a fatal heart attack and was discovered dead in a New York hotel room on 30 December 1967 . Prior to Berns ' death , he and Morrison had experienced some creative difficulties . Berns had been pushing Morrison towards a more pop @-@ oriented direction , while Morrison wanted to explore newer musical terrain . As a result , Berns ' widow , Ilene Berns , held Morrison and this conflict responsible for her husband 's death . Years later she would downplay this scenario but Morrison 's ex @-@ wife Janet ( Planet ) Rigsbee Minto has gone on record describing her initial subsequent vindictiveness towards Morrison . 
 Upon Bert Berns ' death , Ilene Berns inherited the contracts of Bang Records . Morrison 's annual option on his recording contract was also due less than a week after Berns ' funeral . Legally bound to Bang Records , Morrison was not only kept out of the studio , but he also found himself unable to find performing work in New York as most clubs refrained from booking him , fearing reprisals . Ilene Berns then discovered that her late husband had previously been remiss in filing all the appropriate paperwork to keep Morrison ( still a British citizen ) in New York . She contacted Immigration and Naturalization Service and attempted to have Morrison deported . However , Morrison managed to stay in the U.S. when his then @-@ girlfriend Janet ( Planet ) Rigsbee Minto agreed to marry him . Once married , Morrison and his wife moved to Cambridge , Massachusetts , where he found work performing in local clubs . Morrison began performing with a small electric combo doing blues numbers , songs from Blowin ' Your Mind ! and from Morrison 's Them band days . Two of the musicians soon left but Morrison retained the bassist , Tom Kielbania , a student at the Berklee School of Music . At that juncture , Morrison decided to try an acoustic sound , and he and Kielbania began performing shows in coffee houses in the Boston area as an acoustic duo with Morrison playing guitar and Kielbania on upright bass . Before this , Morrison had primarily recorded and performed with electric musicians . The acoustic medium would provide him " greater vocal improvisation and a freer , <unk> feel " . 
 Later , Kielbania heard jazz @-@ trained flautist John Payne for the first time while sitting in on a jam session . He invited Payne to the club where he played with Morrison , hoping Morrison would invite him to join them . After allowing Payne to sit in on one performance , Morrison extended an invitation which Payne accepted . The trio of Payne , Kielbania , and Morrison continued performing for four months . In the weeks they played at the Catacombs , they began to develop the template for Astral Weeks . It was around this time that Warner Bros. Records approached Morrison , hoping to sign him to their roster . Presumably their interest focused on his prior success with " Brown @-@ Eyed Girl " , not on Morrison 's current acoustic work . Regardless , their interest allowed Morrison to return to the recording studio . 
 At the time , Warner Bros. had a deal with Inherit Productions , the production arm of Schwaid @-@ Merenstein which was founded by manager Bob Schwaid ( who worked for Warners Publishing ) and producer Lewis Merenstein . Merenstein received a call from Warner Bros. to go see Morrison in Boston and related how eight or nine producers had gone to hear Morrison thinking they were going to hear " Brown Eyed Girl " and " it was another person with the same voice " . Merenstein first heard Morrison play at Ace Recording studio and recalled that when Morrison played the song " Astral Weeks " for him , " I started crying . It just vibrated in my soul , and I knew that I wanted to work with that sound . " While <unk> had been to see Morrison , Schwaid had set to work on resolving Morrison 's contractual troubles . 
 Still legally bound to Bang Records , Morrison would yet have more issues with them in the future . For the time being , Schwaid managed to free him from those obligations , under several conditions . First , Morrison had to write and submit to Web IV Music ( Bert Berns 's publishing company ) three original compositions per month over the course of one year . Morrison fulfilled that obligation by recording thirty @-@ six nonsense songs in a single session . Such action risked legal reprisals , but ultimately none transpired . Morrison then had to assign Web IV one half of the copyright to any musical composition written and recorded by Morrison and released as a single within one year from 12 September 1968 . That demand became a moot point when Warner Bros. refrained from releasing any single during that time frame , as no single was released from Astral Weeks . Finally , Morrison had to include two original compositions controlled by Web IV on his next album . Morrison fulfilled that demand with two of his own compositions , " Madame George " and " Beside You " , although the versions subsequently released were vastly different musically from the original versions recorded with Bang . 
 = = Recording sessions = = 
 With his legal matters resolved , Morrison now had the freedom to proceed with recording his Warner Bros. debut album , with the recording sessions taking place at the Century Sound Studios in New York on 25 September , 1 and 15 October 1968 . 
 Recording adjacent to Van Morrison 's studio , musician John Cale reported , " Morrison couldn 't work with anybody , so finally they just shut him in the studio by himself . He did all the songs with just an acoustic guitar , and later they overdubbed the rest of it around his tapes . " This is , in fact , completely untrue – the live tracks for the sessions were performed by Morrison on vocals and acoustic guitar in a separate vocal booth with the other musicians playing together on upright bass , lead acoustic guitar , vibes , flute , and drums . The strings and horns constituted the only instruments added subsequently to the initial recording sessions . 
 Producer Lewis Merenstein had a background in jazz , and according to Merenstein , Morrison " was not an aficionado of jazz when I met him . R & B and soul , yes ; but jazz , no . For the Astral Weeks recording sessions , Merenstein first contacted veteran bassist Richard Davis . Perhaps best known for his work with Eric Dolphy , Davis essentially served as the session leader , and it was through Davis that Merenstein recruited guitarist Jay Berliner , percussionist Warren Smith , Jr . , and drummer Connie Kay . All of these musicians had strong backgrounds in jazz ; Berliner had worked closely with Charles Mingus and Kay was part of the Modern Jazz Quartet . Morrison was still working with Kielbania and Payne , but for these sessions , they were essentially replaced . According to Kielbania , " I got to show all the bass lines to Richard Davis . He embellished a lot of them , but I gave him the feeling . " 
 Davis proved , perhaps , to be the most pivotal instrumentalist during these sessions . " If you listen to the album , every tune is led by Richard and everybody followed Richard and Van 's voice , " says Merenstein . " I knew if I brought Richard in , he would put the bottom on to support what Van wanted to do vocally , or acoustically . Then you get Jay playing those beautiful counter @-@ lines to Van . " Davis was not impressed by Morrison , but not out of disdain or any preconceived notions , but rather because Morrison 's professional comportment generally did not meet Davis 's expectations . " No prep , no meeting , " recalls Davis . " He was remote from us , ' cause he came in and went into a booth ... And that 's where he stayed , isolated in a booth . I don 't think he ever introduced himself to us , nor we to him ... And he seemed very shy ... " Drummer Connie Kay later told Rolling Stone that he approached Morrison and asked " what he wanted me to play , and he said to play whatever I felt like playing . We more or less sat there and jammed . " Morrison 's impression of the sessions was " The songs came together very well in the studio . Some of the tracks were first takes . [ But ] the musicians were really together . Those type of guys play what you 're gonna do before you do it , that 's how good they are . " He told Ritchie Yorke that only two tracks recorded during the sessions did not make it to the album . " One was about Jesse James and the other about trains . They were both just basic blues numbers . That 's why they didn 't fit in with the album . " 
 For the Astral Weeks sessions , apparently they did not employ any lead sheets , or at least none were distributed to the musicians . " What stood out in my mind was the fact that he allowed us to stretch out , " recalls Berliner . " We were used to playing to charts , but Van just played us the songs on his guitar and then told us to go ahead and play exactly what we felt . " Berliner actually had great appreciation for the freedom given to him and the band ; something few , if any , of them were used to . " I played a lot of classical guitar on those sessions and it was very unusual to play classical guitar in that context , " says Berliner . 
 The first session , held in the evening on 25 September 1968 , produced four recordings that made it to the album . Only three had initially been intended for inclusion : " Cyprus Avenue " , " Madame George " , and " Beside You " . Although not scheduled to play , Payne still attended the first session and listened as another flautist played his parts . To this day , nobody recalls the name of this flautist , nor has he been identified on any of the surviving documentation ; he does play flute on the released takes of " Beside You " and " Cyprus Avenue " but is not included in the album credits . When Morrison tried to squeeze in one last tune during the end of that first session , Payne spoke up and pleaded to Merenstein to permit him to participate . Payne was then allowed to play on what became the title track of the album – " Astral Weeks " – the fourth song produced from this initial session . For the remainder of the sessions , John Payne played on every song . 
 The next session , according to John Payne , occurred early in the morning , but it did not work and nothing from this session worked for the final album . " It just didn 't happen ' " says Payne . " It was the wrong time of day for jazz musicians to create . I think that by the end of that session we all knew that nothing was going to be used . They just said , let 's forget it . " Jay Berliner was not available , so Barry Kornfeld was recruited to play lead guitar in his place . According to Merenstein , there was tension at this second session and it was stopped after about three hours . Morrison was quoted by Ritchie Yorke as saying the album was recorded in " two eight @-@ hour sessions , plus two overdub sessions . That was the whole album . " In his biography , Clinton Heylin gives the date for the second session as 1 October and states that " Only ' As Young Lovers Do ' from this session would make the album " contending that this is the reason for the different " lounge @-@ jazz sound " on this track . Other biographers have primarily noted that the early morning first of October session was abandoned without producing any of the songs on the album . 
 The third and final session , in the evening on 15 October , produced four more recordings that completed the album — " The Way Young Lovers Do " " Sweet Thing " , " Ballerina " and " Slim Slow Slider " . Davis expressed to Rolling Stone that there was a " certain feel about a seven @-@ to @-@ ten o ' clock session " and that " the ambience of that time of day was all through everything we played " . Both " Sweet Thing " and " Ballerina " were originally scheduled for the session , but the search for a ' closer ' consumed a considerable amount of time . They attempted ( and rejected ) a number of songs until Morrison suggested " Slim Slow Slider " . " I don 't think we 'd ever done [ it ] live , " recalls Payne . " [ Morrison ] had a book full of songs ... I don 't know why he decided to do it ... And we were first doing it with the drums , with Richard Davis and Connie Kay and the guitar player and the vibe player and me and Van — all of us were playing . Then I started playing soprano sax on the thing , and Lew said , ' OK , I wanna try it again . Start again . And I want just the bass , the soprano sax , and Van . ' " It was a successful take , but it also came with a very long coda , prompting Merenstein to make a large cut during the editing process . Many of the tracks on Astral Weeks would be subjected to edits ( mainly to tighten the performances ) , but the one on " Slim Slow Slider " was easily the most substantial . " I would estimate three , five minutes of instrumental stuff , " says Payne . " We went through stages [ until ] we got to be avant @-@ garde kind of weird , which is what you hear after the splice – all that weird stuff we 're playing – but there was a whole progression to that . " According to Merenstein , before he cut it , the coda " was a long , long ending that went nowhere , that just carried on from minute to minute ... If it had [ some ] relativity to the tune itself , I would have left it there . " 
 The recording engineer for the album , Brooks Arthur , remembered the sessions in 2009 : " A cloud came along , and it was called the Van Morrison sessions . We all hopped upon that cloud , and the cloud took us away for awhile [ sic ] , and we made this album , and we landed when it was done . " In a Rolling Stone interview in 1972 , Morrison told John <unk> , Jr . : " I was really pretty happy with the album . The only complaint I had was that it was rather rushed . But I thought it was closer to the type of music I wanted to put out . And still is , actually . " 
 = = Composition = = 
 Astral Weeks has stream of consciousness and poetic lyrics that evoke emotions and images instead of coherent , intellectual ideas and narratives . According to Guy Raz from NPR , it is a folk rock album , " perhaps the seminal album of the folk @-@ rock genre " , while the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame online biography of Morrison said its music is trance @-@ like folk jazz set to " impressionistic , free @-@ flowing " lyrics . AllMusic 's William Ruhlmann , on the other hand , viewed the music as an amalgam of folk , blues , jazz , and classical music that is unlike rock . 
 Although usually described as a song cycle rather than a concept album , the songs do , when considered in their totality , seem to link together as one long song , forming an " intangible narrative of unreachable worlds " and delivered with what one writer calls " a masterpiece of virtuoso singing " . According to Charlie Gillett , the album has meditative songs that combine themes of nostalgia , drama , and Morrison 's personal mysticism and are performed in a blue @-@ eyed soul style . 
 The album embraces a form of symbolism that would eventually become a staple of Morrison 's songs , equating earthly love and heaven , or as close as a living being can approach it . Morrison and Davis 's upright bass can be interpreted as the earth opposing Kay 's percussion and the string arrangement representing heaven and with Berliner 's lead acoustic guitar residing on a plane in between . 
 Van Morrison told Ritchie Yorke , one of his biographers , he wrote both of the songs " Madame George " and " Cyprus Avenue " in stream of consciousness : " [ ' Madame George ' ] just came right out ... The song is just a stream of consciousness thing , as is ' Cyprus Avenue ' ... I didn 't even think about what I was writing . " 
 In an interview with Paste in 2009 , Morrison said the songs on Astral Weeks were written " prior to 1968 over a period of five years " . In an NPR review he comments : " It 's not about me . It 's totally fictional . It 's put together of composites , of conversations I heard — you know , things I saw in movies , newspapers , books , whatever . It comes out as stories . That 's it . There 's no more . " 
 = = Songs = = 
 Side One – In The Beginning 
 " Astral Weeks " 
 The song " Astral Weeks " opens the album with the lines " If I ventured in the slipstream , between the viaducts of your dream / Where immobile steel rims crack , and the ditch in the back roads stop " , which according to Erik Hage shows Morrison had " once and for all pulled neck and neck with Dylan as a lyricist " . Morrison described it as " one of those songs where you can see the light at the end of the tunnel ... I don 't think I can elaborate on it any more than that . " The words in the song : " Talkin ' to Huddie Ledbetter / <unk> ' pictures on the wall " appear to be based on Morrison 's real life custom of carrying around a poster of Lead Belly and hanging it on the wall wherever he lived . ( This was revealed in a Rolling Stone interview in 1978 . ) 
 " Beside You " 
 " Beside You " , the second song on the album , has been described as " expressionistic poetry and a scattershot collection of images and scenarios " . It begins with the classical guitar of Jay Berliner and Morrison 's voice circling each other . Morrison described it as " the kind of song that you 'd sing to a kid or somebody that you love . It 's basically a love song . It 's just a song about being spiritually beside somebody . " It was originally recorded for Bang Records in December 1967 . That first recording shows the pop music intentions of Bert Berns which give it a different sound from the Astral Weeks recording . 
 " Sweet Thing " 
 " Sweet Thing " is the only song on the album to look forward instead of backward . In the words of The AllMusic reviewer : " Over the endlessly descending , circular progression , Morrison sings positive lyrics about nature and a romantic partner , seemingly beginning in the middle of a thought : ' And I will stroll the merry way . ' " Paul Du Noyer wrote , " Sweet Thing puts the singer in a hazy , pastoral paradise where he wanders in ' gardens wet with rain ' , or counts the stars in his lover 's eyes , and vows to ' never grow so old again ' or ' read between the lines ' . He pleads with his mind to keep quiet , so his heart can hear itself think . He yearns to obliterate experience and rediscover innocence . " It has been a more popular cover song than any of the others on the album and is the only Astral Weeks song that has been included in any of Morrison 's compilation albums . 
 " Cyprus Avenue " 
 The song " Cyprus Avenue " is a three chord blues composition and served for many years as the closing song for most of Morrison 's live shows . Along with " Madame George " , it is the centerpiece of the album and both songs are Belfast related and highly impressionistic . The song is told from the point of view of an outsider watching from inside an automobile and getting tongue @-@ tied as the refined school girl he fantasizes about appears and he imagines her a fine lady with " rainbow ribbons in her hair " in a carriage drawn by six white horses and " returning from a fair " . Van Morrison described Cyprus Avenue as " a street in Belfast , a place where there 's a lot of wealth . It wasn 't far from where I was brought up and it was a very different scene . To me it was a very mystical place . It was a whole avenue lined with trees and I found it a place where I could think . " 
 Side Two – Afterwards 
 " The Way Young Lovers Do " 
 " The Way Young Lovers Do " is described by Clinton Heylin as a " lounge @-@ jazz " sound that " still sticks out like <unk> at a champagne buffet " . In his review for Rolling Stone , Greil Marcus also spoke of the song as a " poor jazz @-@ flavored cut that , is uncomfortably out of place on this record " . Brian Hinton describes it as there being " a Sinatra strut to Van 's voice , a blues knowingness with Stax brass , and a string section which swirls where previously it drifted . " He describes it as " about growing up , an adolescent first kiss ... " 
 " Madame George " 
 Called the other album masterpiece ( along with Cyprus Avenue ) , " Madame George " is almost ten minutes long and tells of the mysterious madame " in a corner playing dominoes in drag " , among other things . It also has a setting of Cyprus Avenue in Belfast with impressionistic lyrics that give stream @-@ of @-@ conscious details that are seemingly unrelated . Erik Hage describes the effect of the sensory experience of the lyrics , the instrumentation and Morrison 's impassioned vocals on the listener and the album as being " like some kind of twilight state between sleeping and wakefulness " , engaging the listener to project themselves into the spell of the song . Rolling Stone 's album reviewer wrote : " The crowning touch is ' Madame George ' , a cryptic character study that may or may not be about an aging transvestite but that is certainly as heartbreaking a reverie as you will find in pop music . " Morrison has denied that the song is about a transvestite , as others , including Lester Bangs , have believed . The original title of the song is " Madame Joy " and Morrison later changed the title although he actually sings the words " Madame Joy " in the song . An earlier recording for Bang Records with slightly altered lyrics , backing singers , a much swifter tempo and a " bizarrely inappropriate party atmosphere " changes the tone considerably from the Astral Weeks recording . 
 " Ballerina " 
 The oldest composition on Astral Weeks is " Ballerina " , which Morrison composed in 1966 while still a member of Them . About the same time he first met his future wife , Janet . Inspired by " a flash about an actress in an opera house appearing in a ballet " ( according to Morrison ) , former Them guitarist Jim Armstrong recalls the band working on the song between engagements . " [ Morrison ] had all these words " , Armstrong says , " we sort of formalized it , ' cause there was no structure to it " . Them performed the song one night in Hawaii , but it was not recorded until Astral Weeks . On the full @-@ length version of " Ballerina " which first appeared on the 2015 expanded edition , the left and right audio channels are opposite to those on the originally released edited version . 
 " Slim Slow Slider " 
 " Slim Slow Slider " is the only song on the album to not have string overdubs and according to John Payne , Morrison had not played it live before . Like in the song " T.B. Sheets " , the singer tells of watching a young girl die , but in " Slim Slow Slider " the girl seems bent on her own self @-@ destruction : " I know you 're dying , baby / I know you know it too . " The song ends abruptly with the words , " Every time I see you , I just don 't know what to do . " It has been said to be about a junkie but Morrison has only said that it 's about someone " who is caught up in a big city like London or maybe is on dope , I 'm not sure . " 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 When Astral Weeks was first released , it sold poorly . In the United States , the album became a somewhat popular cult import , while it was largely overlooked by critics in the United Kingdom . The British magazine Beat Instrumental published a negative review , finding Morrison 's songs monotonous and unoriginal , while Nick Logan from NME called it a pale imitation of guitarist José Feliciano 's 1968 album Feliciano ! , one of the year 's best @-@ selling records . With the exception of the title track , he felt the compositions were indistinguishable and " suffer from being stuck in the same groove throughout " . In the American magazine Stereo Review , editor Peter Reilly panned Astral Weeks as a " free @-@ verse mind bender of an album " plagued by nonsensical lyrics and incoherent singing from Morrison , especially on " Madame George " . Greil Marcus , on the other hand , argued in Rolling Stone that his lyrics are thoughtful and deeply intellectual " in terms of the myths and metaphors that exist within the world of rock and roll " . Marcus believed both his music and lyrics captured the spirit of Bob Dylan 's 1967 album John Wesley Harding , calling Astral Weeks a " unique and timeless " record . The magazine later named it the album of the year . Melody Maker also called it one of the year 's best records , featuring Morrison 's " small harsh voice " backed by an attractive musical combo that " verges on genius " during " Madame George " . When Morrison 's third album Moondance was released in 1970 , Warner Bros. ran full @-@ page advertisements remarking on the unavailability of Astral Weeks in record stores , calling it a " damn shame " that it " ended up as what you might call a critically acclaimed but obscure album ... If you want it and can 't find it , yell at the store 's record buyer . Loud , because you 're the customer and you 're always right . Undo the veils of potential obscurity . " 
 Astral Weeks ' critical standing improved greatly over time , becoming viewed as one of rock 's greatest records and a culturally significant work . A number of factors afforded the record its canonical reputation in rock criticism : its backstory as a commercial underachiever and highly personal work for Morrison , its distinction from the rest of his discography , his artistic autonomy , the music 's song cycle composition , enigmatic lyrics , and the quality of seriousness and originality as perceived by mature rock audiences and writers . According to Rob Sheffield , it was Morrison 's " most beautiful and intense album " , the foundation for his " legend " , and a work that continues to captivate musicians and listeners . Lester Bangs said its anguished feeling resonated with him on first listen , calling it " the rock record with the most significance in my life so far ... a record about people stunned by life , completely overwhelmed , stalled in their skins , their ages and selves , paralyzed by the enormity of what in one moment of vision they can comprehend . " Irish musician Glen Hansard said it made him think about life with a greater depth of feeling , " with a greater sense of fear and horror and desire than you ever imagined . " Colin Larkin credited Morrison for fully realizing his ambition to " create without pop 's constraints " on Astral Weeks , while AllMusic 's William Ruhlmann said its reputation among critics was justified because " unlike any record before or since , " it " encompasses the passion and tenderness that have always mixed in the best postwar popular music " . 
 The critical recognition and renown of Astral Weeks came to overshadow Morrison 's subsequent work , as well as Morrison himself . According to biographer Johnny Rogan , his recording career was " all too often crystallized in a single moment . Like the Beach Boys ' Pet Sounds , Astral Weeks was perceived as a one @-@ off whose critical standing allowed little discussion for other equally fascinating musical forays that followed . " Morrison felt annoyed by the retrospective acclaim and claims about the record 's significance . In agreement with Logan 's original criticism , he later said he should have " changed the arrangements because the arrangements are too samey ... four or five other songs should have had a change of mood . " Merenstein , on the other hand , still admires the album : " To this day it gives me pain to hear it . Pain is the wrong word — I 'm so moved by it . " In 2001 , the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America , having shipped 500 @,@ 000 copies in the US . Music historian Andrew Ford said the album 's commercial performance , much like its musical aesthetic , is similar to classical music : " Neither instant nor evanescent : Astral Weeks will sell as many copies this year as it did in 1968 and has every year in between " . 
 Astral Weeks has appeared in all @-@ time best album polls worldwide , and according to Acclaimed Music , it is the 15th most ranked record in critics ' all @-@ time lists . In 1978 , it was voted the 22nd best album of all time in Paul Gambaccini 's poll of 50 prominent American and English rock critics . It was also ranked second greatest by Mojo in 1995 , 19th by Rolling Stone in 2003 , and 3rd by The Times . In 1998 , it was voted the 9th greatest album of all time in a " Music of the Millennium " poll conducted by HMV , Channel 4 and The Guardian . In 2000 , Q placed the record at number 6 on its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever . Time included Astral Weeks in its 2006 list of the " All @-@ TIME 100 Albums " . When Astral Weeks was voted the best Irish album of all time in 2009 , Niall Stokes wrote in Hot Press , " It 's an extraordinary work , packed with marvelously evocative songs that are rooted in Belfast but which deliver a powerful and lasting universal poetic resonance . "

 Astral Weeks had an impact on future releases of other musicians such as Bono and Bruce Springsteen . Mike Ragogna with The Huffington Post wrote that Astral Weeks influenced Springsteen 's 1973 first album Greetings from Asbury Park , N.J. and two of the songs from his second . Steven Van Zandt , from Springsteen 's E Street Band , has said : " Astral Weeks was like a religion to us . " According to writer Steve Turner , the album also became popular with travelers of the hippie trail , " from Europe through to Kathmandu and there were even reports of vans painted in psychedelic colours being renamed ' the Van Morrison ' . " In his 1975 book , Ritchie Yorke wrote " It was almost as if Van Morrison , elusive at any time , had deliberately created an album of music which would indefinitely withstand the vulgarity of music industry image @-@ making . Later they might say that other albums were reminiscent of Astral Weeks , but they could never claim that Astral Weeks was like anything else . " 
 According to Greil Marcus , Martin Scorsese said that the first fifteen minutes of his 1976 film Taxi Driver was based on Astral Weeks . Marcus referred to the impact of the album , calling it a " common language " and relates that : " I was so shocked when I was teaching a seminar at Princeton just a couple years ago , and out of 16 students , four of them said their favorite album was Astral Weeks . " Marcus goes on to say , " Now , how did it enter their lives ? We 're talking about an album that was recorded well before they were born , and yet it spoke to them . They understood its language as soon as they heard it . " Elvis Costello described Astral Weeks as " still the most adventurous record made in the rock medium , and there hasn 't been a record with that amount of daring made since " . Johnny Depp , in a Rolling Stone interview in 2008 , recalled how when he was a preteen his older brother ( by ten years ) tiring of Johnny 's favourite music of the time said , " ' Try this . ' And he put on Van Morrison 's Astral Weeks . And it stirred me . I 'd never heard anything like it . " Joan Armatrading has said that Astral Weeks was the first album she purchased as a teenager and that it opened her up musically . In August 2010 , director and choreographer , Jessica <unk> , staged a production in Portland , Oregon of a rock opera / story ballet of Astral Weeks called " Find me Beside You " .

 According to Steve Turner , one of Van Morrison 's biographers , Irish painter Cecil McCartney influenced the titling of Astral Weeks . Morrison related how " A friend of mine had drawings in his flat of astral projection . I was at his house when I was working on a song which began , ' If I venture down the slipstream ' and that 's why I called it ' Astral Weeks ' . " " It was a painting , " McCartney corrects . " There were several paintings in the studio at the time . Van looked at the painting and it suggested astral travelling to him . " The album cover photograph of Van Morrison was taken by Joel Brodsky , best known for his " Young Lions " photoshoot with Jim Morrison . The squared circle in the cover photo is described as portraying " the mystic symbol of the union of opposites ; the sacred marriage of heaven and earth " .

 In November 2008 , Van Morrison performed two concerts at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles , California playing the entire Astral Weeks album . The band featured Jay Berliner who played on the original album . Morrison toured performing the album live throughout most of 2009 , with Rolling Stone calling these concerts " some of the most inspired performances of his whole career " . 
 A live album entitled Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl was released by Morrison 's record label , Listen to the Lion , on 24 February 2009 . It was also issued as a double vinyl LP album released the same date . A DVD featuring the Hollywood Bowl performances and entitled Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl : The Concert Film was released on 19 May 2009 . 
 When asked by Rolling Stone editor , David Wild why he was performing the album again live after forty years , Morrison replied : " It received no promotion , from Warner Bros. — that 's why I never got to play the songs live . I had always wanted to play the record live and fully orchestrated — that is what this is all about . I always like live recording and I like listening to live records too . I 'm not too fond of being in a studio — it 's too contrived and too confining . I like the freedom of live , in @-@ the @-@ moment sound . " 
 As for the songs on the original album , Morrison told Los Angeles Times columnist Randy Lewis : " The songs are poetic stories , so the meaning is the same as always — timeless and unchanging . The songs are works of fiction that will inherently have a different meaning for different people . People take from it whatever their disposition to take from it is . " 
 On October 30 , 2015 , the album remastered was reissued by Warner Bros. Records with four session bonus tracks , including the full @-@ length versions of both " Ballerina " and " Slim Slow Slider . "

 " Rock with U " is a song by American recording artist Janet Jackson , from her tenth studio album , Discipline ( 2008 ) . It was written by Ne @-@ Yo , Jermaine Dupri , and Eric Stamile , and produced by the last two . The song was released as the album 's second single on February 5 , 2008 , by Island Records . " Rock with U " is a pop song that was created for the gay community , as Jackson felt the necessity to do something for its members . 
 " Rock with U " received positive reviews from music critics , with the majority lauding its retro , but futuristic sound , and commending the song 's elements of house music . The song had minimal success , only being able to reach the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles and the top @-@ twenty of the Hot Dance Club Songs , Although it did manage to make the Top 5 of the UK R & B Chart . Saam Farahmand directed the long take music video , which features Jackson having a party inside a club , with red and white rays of light entering the room . " Rock with U " served as the title for Jackson 's Rock Witchu Tour the same year , where the song was also performed .

 In July 2007 , it was announced that Jackson had signed a recording contract with Island Records , after her five @-@ album deal with Virgin Records was fulfilled with the release of her album 20 Y.O. ( 2006 ) . Jackson 's tenth studio album , Discipline , which was an acknowledgment of Jackson 's commitment , focus and dedication to her career , was released on February 26 , 2008 under the supervision of label head L. A. Reid . She did not write or co @-@ write any songs on the album , a departure from her usual practice of co @-@ writing and producing all of the songs on her albums . " Rock With U " was written by Shaffer Smith , Jermaine Dupri and Eric Stamile , with Dupri producing it , while Stamile co @-@ produced it . In an interview for NewNowNext , Jackson explained that the song was created for the gay community , saying , 
 " Honestly the song was created for the gay community . I kept stressing to Jermaine [ Dupri , the song 's co @-@ writer ] , ‘ I got to do something for the kids . ’ I had talked about it on the last album – and there was a song that I had , and it wasn ’ t quite completed . And I talked about it to the papers , gay magazines , and it didn 't wind up on the album with the cut @-@ off date . I felt really badly about that . So he just handed me a CD and said , ‘ Here are 10 tracks for the kids ; tell me which one you like the best . ’ I fell in love with ' Rock With U ' . " 
 After the song was released , Jackson was awarded the Vanguard Award at the 19th annual GLAAD Media Awards , honoring her contributions in promoting equal rights among the gay community . The organization 's president commented , " Ms. Jackson has a tremendous following inside the LGBT community and out , and having her stand with us against the defamation that LGBT people still face in our country is extremely significant . " 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 " Rock with U " is a " digitized form " of pop song which draws influence from Euro disco . According to Jackson , it still reminiscent of " Together Again " or " Throb " from The Velvet Rope ( 1997 ) and janet . ( 1993 ) , respectively . " It 's still classic me but with a different twist to it – a modern twist " , she said . Jim Farber from New York Daily News noted the song 's riffs , which he considered greater when they first appeared in Madonna 's 1985 song " Into the Groove " . The song was compared to Michael Jackson 's " Rock With You " ( 1979 ) , due to its disco themes . 
 " Rock with U " also contains vocodered whispers and murmured vocals . The song opens with the line , " Strobe lights make everything sexier , " while it talks about an erotic proposition which was reportedly dedicated to the gay community . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 " Rock with U " was made available for sale through the US iTunes Store on February 5 , 2008 along with a pre @-@ order offer for her tenth studio album , Discipline . The song was serviced to rhythmic crossover radio stations on February 11 , 2008 and was released to Top 40 radio stations on February 26 , 2008 . 
 " Rock with U " was met with general critical acclaim from most music critics , with most praising its style and retro vibe . Picking the song as one of the album 's best tracks , Andy Kellman of Allmusic named it " an irresistible , grade @-@ A dancefloor track , " calling it " swift and swooning . " Bryan Borzykowski of Now newspaper called it a " bouncy house track , " while Nick Levine from Digital Spy called it " cosmic , sleek , catchy and bracingly modern " , writing that " it wouldn 't disgrace itself as a Kylie [ Minogue ] single . " Dan Gennoe of Yahoo ! Music was extremely positive , writing that the song marries Jackson 's sweet and stomping side for an 1980s influenced song , which we called both genuinely exciting and " sounds 100 per cent like Janet Jackson " . 
 Ann Powers from Los Angeles Times enjoyed the track , calling it " the gentlest time travel ever accomplished . " Powers also wrote , " Playing on memory and melancholia , Janet 's ' Rock With U ' is nowhere as great as the original , but as a bit of intimate meta @-@ pop it 's utterly poignant . Jackson has long been the bearer of her brother 's secrets , and on this song she shows that she can still crave something other than sexual fulfillment . Something like innocence . " Michael Arceneaux of PopMatters praised the track , calling it " a sensual gem " and " almost euphoric " , effectively complimenting Jackson 's " whispery delivery . " Arceneaux added , " It ’ s a digitized form of pop music Janet should look into for future recordings . " Tom Young from BBC was negative in his review , saying that its lyrics would not seduce anybody .

 The accompanying music video for " Rock with U " was directed by Saam Farahmand and choreographed by Gil Duldulao . It premiered on Access Granted on March 5 , 2008 . Jackson described Farahmand as an excited , <unk> and creative person . He wanted to make the video as a long take video , like the music video for previous single " Feedback " , which he also directed . According to the singer , the makeup looks and fashion of the video were a " futuristic version of the Blitz Kids from the 80 's " . <unk> commented " I just wanted sort of bring Janet into the visionary style she 's had in the past and I wanted to bring to like , video , and bring it back " . He also mentioned that it took him at least a day and a half to finish its choreography . 
 The long take video begins with many people dancing on a hallway , until a girl comes and opens a door which leads to a room . There , other dancers are dancing to the song in midway of white rays of light , until the camera shows Jackson in the corner of the room and they start performing a dance routine . While the singer disappears from vision , people dance until she appears again dancing to the song . Then she goes to a hallway and enters a red @-@ lighted room , accompanied by dancers , where entertainer Mimi Marks is seen . There she dances another routine along with her dancers . After dancing , she enters in another hallway where she gets alone with a man , until they share a kiss . Then , people who were in the previous room enter to the hallway to connect to another room , with Marks taking Jackson with her . The video ends with people coming closer to Jackson . 
 Jackson included the song on her similarly titled Rock Witchu Tour in 2008 .

 = Portrait painting in Scotland = 
 Portrait painting in Scotland includes all forms of painted portraiture in Scotland , from its beginnings in the early sixteenth century until the present day . The origins of the tradition of portrait painting in Scotland are in the Renaissance , particularly through contacts with the Netherlands . The first portrait of a named person that survives is that of Archbishop William Elphinstone , probably painted by a Scottish artist using Flemish techniques around 1505 . Around the same period Scottish monarchs turned to the recording of royal likenesses in panel portraits , painted in oils on wood . The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much of the sixteenth century . It began to flourish after the Reformation , with paintings of royal figures and nobles by Netherlands artists Hans Eworth , Arnold Bronckorst and Adrian Vanson . A specific type of Scottish picture from this era was the " vendetta portrait " , designed to keep alive the memory of an atrocity . The Union of Crowns in 1603 removed a major source of artistic patronage in Scotland as James VI and his court moved to London . The result has been seen as a shift " from crown to castle " , as the nobility and local lairds became the major sources of patronage . 
 The first significant Scottish portrait artist was George Jameson , who became one of the most successful painters of the reign of Charles I. He trained the Baroque artist John Michael Wright . In this period the full @-@ length portrait in Highland dress became a common form of painting . William Aikman emerged as the leading Scottish portrait @-@ painter of the next generation . He , like most Scottish painters of note before the late eighteenth century , migrated to London . John Alexander and William Mossman painted many of the figures of early @-@ Enlightenment Edinburgh . Allan Ramsay established himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility and he undertook portraits of many of the major figures of the Scottish Enlightenment . He later focused on royal portraits , anticipating the grand manner of Joshua Reynolds , but many of his early portraits , particularly of women , are less formal and more intimate . The leading portrait painter of the second half of the century was Henry Raeburn , the first significant artist to pursue his entire career in Scotland , his subjects went beyond the nobility to the middle classes . His pupils included the brothers William ( Alexander ) , Archibald and Andrew Robertson . The former two brothers founded the Columbian Academy of Painting in New York , and Andrew was the leading Scottish miniaturist of his day . 
 The generation of painters that followed Raeburn included David Watson , John Watson Gordon and David Wilkie who became one of the most influential British artists of the century . From the mid @-@ nineteenth century , portrait painting , particularity the miniature , declined as an art , photography also began to influence painting . Major figures who worked in portraiture and came to prominence in the second half of the century included Francis Grant , Robert Scott Lauder , William Quiller Orchardson and John <unk> . In the twentieth century the move away from figurative painting to impressionism and abstraction , speeded the decline of portrait painting . Artists who continued to pursue portraiture included Francis Cadell , Cecile Walton , Dorothy Johnstone and James Cowie . The second half of the twentieth century saw a general movement back towards figurative representation . Alexander Moffat was among the leading Scottish intellectuals from the 1960s . The artists associated with Moffat known as the " new Glasgow Boys " included Steven Campbell , Peter Howson , Ken Currie and Adrian Wisniewski . A parallel movement in Edinburgh , focused around the 369 Gallery in the city , included Caroline McNairn , Robert MacLaurin and Gwen Hardie . 
 = = Sixteenth century = = 
 The origins of the tradition of portrait painting in Scotland are in the Renaissance , which began to reach Scotland in the fifteenth century . Portraits were given an important role in Renaissance society , valued as objects , and as depictions of earthly success and status . In Scotland this was particularly through contacts with the Netherlands , generally considered the centre of painting in the Northern Renaissance . The products of these connections included a fine portrait of William Elphinstone ( 1431 – 1514 ) , Lord Chancellor , Bishop of Aberdeen and founder of the university there . Painted around 1505 , it is one of the earliest representations of a named Scottish subject to survive and was probably painted by a Scots artist using Flemish techniques of oil on wood . Around the same time , Scottish monarchs , like those in England , turned to the recording of royal likenesses in panel portraits , painted in oils on wood , perhaps as a form of political expression . As in England , the monarchy may have had model portraits of royalty used for copies and reproductions , but the versions of native royal portraits that survive are generally crude by continental standards . In 1502 James IV paid for delivery of portraits of the Tudor household , perhaps by the " Inglishe <unk> " named " Mynours , " who stayed in Scotland to paint the king and his new bride Margaret Tudor the following year . " Mynours " was Maynard Wewyck , a Flemish painter who usually worked for Henry VII in London . Another Flemish painter , called " Piers " , and perhaps <unk> <unk> , an apprentice of an Antwerp painter <unk> van der Weyden , was brought to Scotland by Andrew Halyburton , the trading agent in Middelburg , in September 1505 . No details are known of his work , except his assistance in painting costumes and heraldry for tournaments , but the king gave him a salary and accommodation , and it is likely that Piers made portraits for the court . Piers returned to Flanders from Inverkeithing in July 1508 . Some references in the royal accounts call him a " Frenchman " . 
 The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much of the sixteenth century . In his majority James V was probably more concerned with architectural expressions of royal identity . Mary Queen of Scots had been brought up in the French court , where she was drawn and painted by major European artists , but she did not commission any adult portraits , with the exception of the joint portrait with her second husband Henry Stuart , Lord Darnley . This may have reflected an historic Scottish pattern , where heraldic display , or an elaborate tomb were considered more important than a portrait . 
 Portraiture began to flourish after the Reformation in the mid @-@ sixteenth century . There were anonymously painted portraits of important individuals , including one of James Hepburn , 4th Earl of Bothwell ( 1556 ) . Artists from the Low Countries remained important . Hans Eworth , who had been court painter to Mary I of England , painted a number of Scottish subjects in the 1560s . His 1561 wedding portraits were miniatures commemorating the brief marriage of the earl of Bothwell and Jean Gordon . He also painted James Stewart , 1st Earl of Moray in 1561 and two years later he painted a joint portrait of the young Darnley and his brother Charles Stuart . Lord Seton , Master of the Royal Household , commissioned two portraits in the Netherlands in the 1570s , one of himself and one a family portrait . A specific type of Scottish picture from this era was the " vendetta portrait " , designed to keep alive the memory of an atrocity . Examples include the Darnley memorial portrait , which shows the young James VI kneeling at his murdered father 's tomb , and the life @-@ size portrait of the corpse of The Bonnie Earl of Moray , vividly showing the wounds received by James Stewart , 2nd Earl of Moray when he was killed by George Gordon , 1st Marquess of Huntly in 1591 . 
 There was an attempt to produce a series of portraits of Scottish kings in panel portraits , probably for the royal entry of the fifteen @-@ year @-@ old James VI in 1579 , which are Medieval in form . In James VI 's personal reign , Renaissance forms of portraiture began to dominate . He employed two Flemish artists , Arnold Bronckorst in the early 1580s and Adrian Vanson from around 1584 to 1602 , who have left a visual record of the king and major figures at the court . However , the Union of Crowns in 1603 removed a major source of artistic patronage in Scotland as James VI and his court moved to London . The result has been seen as a shift " from crown to castle " , as the nobility and local lairds became the major sources of patronage . 
 = = Seventeenth century = = 
 By the seventeenth century the fashion for portraiture had spread down the social order to lairds such as Colin Campbell of Glenorchy and John Napier of Merchiston . Adam de <unk> , perhaps the son of Adrian Vanson and probably trained in the Netherlands , was working in England in the 1620s . In 1623 he painted his portrait of George Seaton , 3rd Earl of Winton and his sons and another of Seaton 's wife Anne Hay with her two daughters . 
 The first significant native artist was George Jamesone of Aberdeen ( 1589 / 90 @-@ 1644 ) , who , having trained in the Netherlands , became one of the most successful portrait painters of the reign of Charles I. He trained the Baroque artist John Michael Wright ( 1617 – 94 ) , who also studied in Rome with Poussin and Velázquez . Wright painted both Scottish and English subjects , including his sensitive portrait of the architect William Bruce ( 1664 ) and styled himself as " king 's painter " . His full @-@ length painting of Lord Mungo Murray in Highland dress ( c . 1680 ) is an early example of what became a standard format of Scottish portrait . The Commonwealth period saw the emergence of David <unk> ( 1598 – 1661 ) , mainly noted for his portrait of the Covenanter leader Archibald Campbell . Also important was the miniaturist David Paton ( fl . 1668 – 1708 ) , who worked mainly in plumbago , but also painted portraits in oil . Visiting artists included Jacob de <unk> ( c . 1610 – c . 1691 ) , who was commissioned in 1684 to paint images of 110 kings for Holyroodhouse and similar work at Glamis Castle . 
 After the Glorious Revolution , Wright , a Jacobite , fell out of favour at the royal court . The Flemish @-@ Spanish painter John Baptist Medina ( 1659 – 1710 ) came to Scotland in 1693 and became the leading Scottish portrait painter of his generation . Among his best known works are a group of about 30 oval bust @-@ lengths , including a self @-@ portrait , in Surgeons ' Hall , Edinburgh . He trained his son , also John , and William Aikman ( 1682 – 1731 ) , who became the leading Scottish portrait @-@ painter of the next generation . Aikman migrated to London in 1723 , and from this point until the late eighteenth century , most Scottish painters of note followed him . 
 = = Eighteenth century = = 
 John Alexander was born in Aberdeen and was a great grandson of portrait painter George Jamesone . He studied in London and Rome , returning to Scotland about 1720 . His younger contemporary William Mossman ( 1700 – 71 ) was also from Aberdeen and studied in Rome . Both worked predominately in the north @-@ east around their home city , but also painted many of the figures of early @-@ Enlightenment Edinburgh . Alexander 's best known work included the portrait of George Drummond the Lord Provost of Edinburgh ( 1756 ) , who had been responsible for the creation of the New Town in Edinburgh and the Royal Infirmary , which is shown in the background of the painting . Mosman 's work included his portrait of John Campbell of the Bank ( 1749 ) , who was chief cashier of the Royal Bank of Scotland and a Whig , but who is depicted in the recently forbidden Highland dress . Because of his Jacobite sympathies Alexander was forced to leave for the continent after the rebellion of 1745 , and in Rome he made a living painting the Jacobite expatriates who congregated there , before his return a few years later . 
 Allan Ramsay ( 1713 – 84 ) studied in Sweden , London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh , where he established himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility . He undertook portraits of many of the major figures of the Scottish Enlightenment , including his friend the philosopher David Hume and the visiting Jean @-@ Jacques Rousseau . After a second visit to Italy he moved to London in 1757 and from 1761 he was Principal Painter in Ordinary to George III . He now focused on royal portraits , often presented by the king to ambassadors and colonial governors , but also more intimate works like that of Queen Charlotte and her Children ( c . 1755 ) . His work has been seen as anticipating the Grand Manner of Joshua Reynolds , but many of his early portraits , particularly of women , are less formal and more intimate studies . 
 The leading portrait painter of the second half of the century was Henry Raeburn ( 1756 – 1823 ) . He was the first significant artist to pursue his entire career in Scotland . Born in Edinburgh and returning there after a trip to Italy in 1786 , he is most famous for his intimate portraits of leading figures in Scottish life , going beyond the aristocracy to lawyers , doctors , professors , writers and ministers , adding elements of Romanticism to the Grand Manner tradition . He became a knight in 1822 and the King 's painter and limner in 1823 , marking a return to the post being associated with the production of art . His pupils included the brothers William ( Alexander ) ( 1772 – 1841 ) , Archibald ( 1765 – 1835 ) and Andrew Robertson ( 1777 – 1845 ) . William and Archibald went on to found the Columbian Academy of Painting in New York , and Andrew to be the leading Scottish miniaturist of his day . Also associated with Raeburn towards the end of his career were John Syme ( 1795 – 1861 ) and Colvin Smith ( 1795 – 1875 ) . 
 = = Nineteenth century = = 
 Of the generation of painters that followed Raeburn , David Watson ( 1767 – 1837 ) trained with Reynolds in London before returning home to become the first president of the Scottish Academy in 1826 . The influence of both Reynolds and Raeburn can be seen in his work , including A Girl Drawing ( 1813 ) and the large group portrait The Children of the Earl of Elgin with their Nurse ( c . 1805 ) . He was followed as president of the academy by his nephew John Watson Gordon ( 1788 – 1864 ) , who also studied with Raeburn . He painted portraits of leading cultural figures James Hogg and Lady Nairne as part of a series of portraits commissioned by William Blackwood . David Wilkie ( 1785 – 1841 ) worked mainly in London , and produced the flattering painting of the King George IV in Highland dress commemorating the royal visit to Scotland in 1823 that set off the international fashion for the kilt . He succeeding Raeburn as Royal Limner in 1823 and would emerge of one of the most influential British artists of the century . Andrew Geddes ( 1783 – 1844 ) produced some landscapes , but also portraits of Scottish subjects , including Walter Scott , before he finally moved to London in 1831 . John Graham @-@ Gilbert ( 1794 – 1866 ) was born in Glasgow and worked in the city from 1834 , playing an important part in the professionalisation of painting there . Other figures to pursue their careers largely in portraiture based in Glasgow included Daniel Macnee ( 1806 – 82 ) , who only moved to Edinburgh after his election of President of the Academy in 1876 . 
 From the mid @-@ nineteenth century portrait painting declined as an art . This was partly due to the advent of photography , which could record the human face with greater ease . While grander commissions were still made , the miniature in particular , which had often been in an intimate locket or broach , was largely replaced . David Octavius Hill ( 1802 – 70 ) originally took an interest in photography as a means of being able to record the figures of Great Disruption of 1843 for a composite painted portrait , but as part of Hill & Adamson he was one of the founding fathers of art photography . Just as portrait photography inherited many of the conventions of painting , photography also began to influence painting . From the 1840s John Watson Gordon 's work began to be influenced by early photography , with cool light and muted colours , as can be seen in his full @-@ length portrait of Principal Lee ( 1847 ) . Major figures who worked in portraiture and came to prominence in the second half of the century included Francis Grant , who became the first Scottish president of the Royal Academy in London , Robert Scott Lauder ( 1803 – 69 ) , William Quiller Orchardson ( 1832 – 1910 ) and John <unk> ( 1839 – 93 ) . John Zephaniah Bell ( 1794 – 1883 ) was educated in London and was a forerunner of the trend of Parisian education that would become common among Scottish artists from the later nineteenth century . The most significant grouping in late nineteenth @-@ century Scotland , the Glasgow Boys , mainly focused on landscape . They were influenced by the leading continental artists of the day and broke with Victorian convention . A number of artists identified with the group came to support themselves through portrait painting , including James Guthrie ( 1859 – 1930 ) and Belfast @-@ born John Lavery ( 1856 – 1944 ) . 
 = = Twentieth century to the present = = 
 In the twentieth century the move away from figurative painting to impressionism and abstraction , continued the decline of portrait painting . The first significant group of Scottish artists to emerge in the twentieth century were the four members of the Scottish Colourists in the 1920s . They have been described as the first Scottish modern artists and were the major mechanism by which post @-@ impressionism reached Scotland . Of their number Francis Cadell ( 1883 – 1937 ) , emerged as a significant painter of still lives and single figure compositions , particularly with interior backdrops , before moving closer to abstraction . Of the next significant movement , known as The Edinburgh School , Cecile Walton ( 1891 – 1956 ) referenced classical forms , particularly in her ironic self @-@ portrait Romance ( 1920 ) , which draws on Titian 's Venus of Urbino and Manet 's Olympia . Her close friend Dorothy Johnstone 's portraits , such as the young girl in September Sunlight ( 1916 ) , made use of interior natural light . The work of James Cowie ( 1886 – 1956 ) , who painted a number of girls in interior settings , is similar in theme to that of Johnstone , but had a more distant and elegiac feel that can be seen in Falling Leaves ( 1934 ) , which has been read as a commentary as a commentary on the transition from childhood to adolescence . 
 The second half of the twentieth century saw a general movement back towards figurative representation in European art . Alexander Moffat ( b . 1943 ) , who concentrated on portraiture , labelled with the description of " Scottish realism " , was among the leading Scottish intellectuals from the 1960s . His work included the allegorical Poet 's Pub ( 1980 ) , which shows leading figures in Scottish twentieth @-@ century intellectual life grouped around the poet Hugh MacDiarmid . The artists associated with Moffat and the Glasgow School of Art who came to prominence in the 1980s are sometimes known as the " new Glasgow Boys " , or " Glasgow pups " and included Steven Campbell ( 1953 – 2007 ) , Peter Howson ( b . 1958 ) , Ken Currie ( b . 1960 ) and Adrian Wisniewski ( b . 1958 ) . Strongly influenced by New Image painting that came to prominence in the early 1980s , they have combined figurative art with social commentary . A parallel movement in Edinburgh , focused around the 369 Gallery in the city , included Caroline McNairn ( 1955 – 2010 ) , Robert MacLaurin ( b . 1965 ) and Gwen Hardie ( b . 1962 ) . 
 = I Am Legend ( film ) = 
 I Am Legend is a 2007 American post @-@ apocalyptic horror film directed by Francis Lawrence and starring Will Smith , who plays US Army virologist Robert Neville . The story is set in New York City after a virus has wiped out most of mankind , leaving Neville as the last human in New York , other than nocturnal mutants . Neville is immune to the virus , which was originally created to cure cancer . He works to create a remedy while defending himself against the hostile mutants . 
 Warner Bros. began developing I Am Legend in 1994 , and various actors and directors were attached to the project , though production was delayed due to budgetary concerns related to the script . Production began in 2006 in New York City , filming mainly on location in the city , including a $ 5 million scene at the Brooklyn Bridge . It is the third feature @-@ film adaptation of Richard Matheson 's 1954 I Am Legend novel , following 1964 's The Last Man on Earth and 1971 's The Omega Man . 
 I Am Legend was released on December 14 , 2007 , in the United States and Canada , and opened to the largest ever box office ( not adjusted for inflation ) for a non @-@ Christmas film released in the U.S. in December . The film was the seventh @-@ highest grossing film of 2007 , earning $ 256 million domestically and $ 329 million internationally , for a total of $ 585 million . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In 2009 , a genetically re @-@ engineered measles virus , originally created as a cure for cancer , turns into a lethal strain which kills 90 % of those it infects , mutates 9 % into predatory , nocturnal mutants called " Darkseekers " who are extremely vulnerable to sunlight and other sources of UV , with only the remaining 1 % immune . Three years after the outbreak , US Army virologist Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville ( Will Smith ) lives an isolated life in the ruins of New York City , which is now deserted , unsure if any other uninfected humans are left in the world . 
 The effects of the virus vary in other species , animals that coexist with humans like rats and domestic dogs are infected but wild animals like deer and lions are unaffected . The city has fallen into ruins and overgrown vegetation covers crumbling buildings and wild deer roam the streets while being preyed upon by lions that have escaped Central Park Zoo . Neville 's daily routine includes experimentation on infected rats to find a cure for the virus and trips through Manhattan to hunt for food and supplies . He also waits each day for a response to his continuous recorded radio broadcasts , which instruct any uninfected survivors to meet him at midday at the South Street Seaport . Flashbacks reveal that his wife ( Salli Richardson ) and daughter ( Willow Smith ) died in a helicopter accident during the chaotic evacuation of Manhattan , prior to the military @-@ enforced quarantine of the island in 2009 , in which Neville stays behind on the island as military personnel . Neville 's loneliness is mitigated by the companionship of his German Shepherd Sam ( given to him by his daughter Marley as a puppy to protect him before she died in the helicopter crash ) , interaction with mannequins he has set up as patrons at a video store , and recordings of old television broadcasts . At night , he barricades himself and Sam inside his heavily fortified Washington Square Park home to hide from the Darkseekers . One day while waiting for survivors , Sam follows a deer into a dark building . Neville cautiously goes in after her and finds the deer 's corpse along with Sam , but the building is infested by a colony of Darkseekers , both manage to escape unharmed and the attacking Darkseekers are killed by the sunlight . 
 Neville finds a promising treatment derived from his own blood , so he sets a snare trap and captures a female Darkseeker from a rundown building being used as a hive for the Darkseekers , while a male Darkseeker ( termed " Alpha Male " in the script , and played by Dash Mihok ) angrily tries to go after them , but is blocked by the sunlight and returns to the shadows . Back in his laboratory in the basement of his house , Neville treats the female without success . The next day , he is ensnared in a trap similar to the one he used to capture the female , and by the time he manages to escape , the sun is setting and he is attacked by infected dogs . Neville and Sam manage to kill them , but Sam is bitten in the fight . Neville brings Sam home and injects her with a strand of his serum , but when she shows signs of infection and tries to attack him , Neville is forced to strangle her to death . Heartbroken and driven over the edge by loneliness by his dog 's death , he ventures out and suicidally attacks a group of Darkseekers the next night . He kills a large number of Darkseekers but the rest overwhelm him and he is nearly killed , but is rescued by a pair of immune survivors , Anna ( Alice Braga ) and a young boy named Ethan ( Charlie Tahan ) , who have traveled from Maryland after hearing one of his broadcasts . They take the injured Neville back to his home , where Anna explains that they survived the outbreak aboard a Red Cross evacuation ship from São Paulo and are making their way to a survivors ' camp in Bethel , Vermont . Neville angrily argues that no such survivors ' camp exists . 
 Neville once again attempts to administer a potential cure to the infected woman in his laboratory , but the next night , a group of Darkseekers , who had followed Anna and Neville back the night before , attacks the house and overruns its defenses . Neville , Anna , and Ethan retreat into the basement laboratory , sealing themselves in with the female Darkseeker on which Neville has been experimenting . Discovering that the last treatment was successful , Neville draws a vial of her blood and gives it to Anna , before shutting Ethan and her inside a coal chute in the back of the lab . He then takes a grenade and kills the Darkseekers and himself , saving the cure . The next day , before the crack of dusk , Anna and Ethan discover that her theory is right as they arrive at the survivors ' camp in Vermont . They are greeted by some military officers and Anna hands the cure to one of them .

 The alpha male suddenly ceases its attack and makes a butterfly @-@ shaped smear on the glass .

Neville puts his gun down and returns the female . Neville and the alpha male both stare each other down ; then Neville apologizes to the Darkseekers ; the alpha male accepts his apology , keeping the other Darkseekers back and they leave . Shocked by the ordeal , Neville sits down for a moment in his laboratory . Looking over the pictures of his numerous test subjects , the implications of his research methods begin to dawn on him . The final shot follows Neville , Anna , and Ethan as they drive away towards the survivors ' camp in Vermont with the antidote .

 The late 1990s brought a reemergence of the science @-@ fiction horror genre . In 1995 , Warner Bros. began developing the film project , having owned the rights to Richard Matheson 's 1954 novel I Am Legend since 1970 and having already made the 1971 adaptation The Omega Man . Mark Protosevich was hired to write the script after the studio was impressed with his spec script of The Cell . Protosevich 's first draft took place in 2000 in San Francisco , and contained many similarities with the finished film , though the Darkseekers ( called ' <unk> ' ) were civilized to the point of the creatures in The Omega Man and Anna was a lone morphine addict , as well as the fact that a <unk> character named Christopher joined forces with Neville . Warner Bros. immediately put the film on the fast track , attaching Neal H. Moritz as producer . 
 Actors Tom Cruise , Michael Douglas , and Mel Gibson had been considered to star in the film , using a script by Protosevich and with Ridley Scott as director ; however , by June 1997 , the studio 's preference was for actor Arnold Schwarzenegger . In July , Scott and Schwarzenegger finalized negotiations , with production slated to begin the coming September , using Houston as a stand @-@ in for the film 's setting of Los Angeles . Scott had Protosevich replaced by a screenwriter of his own choosing , John Logan , with whom he spent months of intensive work on a number of different drafts . The Scott / Logan version of I Am Legend was a mix of sci @-@ fi and psychological thriller , without dialogue in the first hour and with a sombre ending . The creatures in Logan 's version were similar to the Darkseekers of the finished film in their animalistic , barbaric nature . The studio , fearing its lack of commercial appeal and merchandising potential , began to worry about the liberties they had given Scott – then on a negative streak of box office disappointments – and urged the production team to reconsider the lack of action in the screenplay . After an " esoteric " draft by writer Neal Jimenez , Warner Bros. reassigned Protosevich to the project , reluctantly working with Scott again . 
 In December 1997 , the project was called into question when the projected budget escalated to $ 108 million due to media and shareholder scrutiny of the studio in financing a big @-@ budget film . Scott rewrote the script in an attempt to reduce the film 's budget by $ 20 million , but in March 1998 , the studio canceled the project due to continued budgetary concerns , and quite possibly to the box office disappointment of Scott 's last three films , 1492 : Conquest of Paradise , White Squall , and G.I. Jane . Likewise , Schwarzenegger 's recent films at the time ( Eraser and Warner Bros. own Batman & Robin ) also underperformed , and the studio 's latest experiences with big budget sci @-@ fi movies Sphere and The Postman were negative , as well . In August 1998 , director Rob Bowman was attached to the project , with Protosevich hired to write a third all @-@ new draft , far more action @-@ oriented than his previous versions , but the director ( who reportedly wished for Nicolas Cage to play the lead ) moved on to direct Reign of Fire and the project did not get off the ground . 
 In March 2002 , Schwarzenegger became the producer of I Am Legend , commencing negotiations with Michael Bay to direct and Will Smith to star in the film . Bay and Smith were attracted to the project based on a redraft that would reduce its budget . However , the project was shelved due to Warner Bros. president Alan F. Horn 's dislike of the script . In 2004 , Akiva Goldsman was asked by head of production Jeff Robinov to produce the film . In September 2005 , director Francis Lawrence signed on to helm the project , with production slated to begin in 2006 . Guillermo del Toro was originally approached to direct by Smith , but turned it down to direct Hellboy II : The Golden Army . Lawrence , whose film Constantine was produced by Goldsman , was fascinated by empty urban environments . He said , " Something 's always really excited me about that ... to have experienced that much loss , to be without people or any kind of social interaction for that long . " 
 Goldsman took on the project as he admired the second I Am Legend film adaptation , The Omega Man . A rewrite was done to distance the project from the other zombie films inspired by the novel , as well as from the recently released 28 Days Later , although Goldsman was inspired by the scenes of a deserted London in the British horror film to create the scenes of a deserted New York City . A 40 @-@ page scene @-@ by @-@ scene outline of the film was developed by May 2006 . When delays occurred on Smith 's film Hancock , which was scheduled for 2007 , it was proposed to switch the actor 's films . This meant filming would have to begin in 16 weeks : production was given a green light , using Goldsman 's script and the outline . Elements from Protosevich 's script were introduced , while the crew consulted with experts on infectious diseases and solitary confinement . Rewrites continued throughout filming , because of Smith 's improvisational skills and Lawrence 's preference to keep various scenes silent . The director had watched Jane Campion ’ s film The Piano with a low volume so as to not disturb his newborn son , and realized that silence could be very effective cinema . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Will Smith signed on to play Robert Neville in April 2006 . He said he took on I Am Legend because he felt it could be like " Gladiator [ or ] Forrest Gump — these are movies with wonderful , audience @-@ pleasing elements , but also uncompromised artistic value . [ This ] always felt like it had those possibilities to me . " The actor found Neville to be his toughest acting challenge since portraying Muhammad Ali in Ali ( 2001 ) . He said that " when you 're on your own , it is kind of hard to find conflict . " The film 's dark tone and exploration of whether Neville has gone insane during his isolation meant Smith had to restrain himself from falling into a humorous routine during takes . To prepare for his role , Smith visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Georgia . He also met with a person who had been in solitary confinement and a former prisoner of war . Smith compared Neville to Job , who lost his children , livelihood , and health . Like the Book of Job , I Am Legend studies the questions , " Can he find a reason to continue ? Can he find the hope or desire to excel and advance in life ? Or does the death of everything around him create imminent death for himself ? " He also cited an influence in Tom Hanks ' performance in Cast Away ( 2000 ) . 
 Abbey and Kona , both three @-@ year @-@ old German Shepherd dogs , played Neville 's dog Sam . The rest of the supporting cast consists of Salli Richardson as Zoe , Robert 's wife , and Alice Braga as a survivor named Anna . Willow Smith , Will Smith 's daughter , makes her film debut as Marley , Neville 's daughter . Emma Thompson has an uncredited role as Dr. Alice Krippin , who appears on television explaining her vaccine for cancer that mutates into the virus . Singer Mike Patton provided the guttural screams of the infected " hemocytes " , and Dash Mihok provided the character animation for the infected " alpha male " . Several filler characters with uncredited roles were in old news broadcasts and flashbacks , such as the unnamed President 's voice ( Pat Fraley ) , and the cast of The Today Show .

 Akiva Goldsman decided to move the story from Los Angeles to New York City to take advantage of locations that would more easily show emptiness . Goldsman explained , " L.A. looks empty at three o 'clock in the afternoon , [ but ] New York is never empty . . . it was a much more interesting way of showing the windswept emptiness of the world . " Warner Bros. initially rejected this idea because of the logistics , but Francis Lawrence was determined to shoot on location , to give the film a natural feel that would benefit from not shooting on soundstages . Lawrence went to the city with a camcorder , and filmed areas filled with crowds . Then , a special effects test was conducted to remove all those people . The test had a powerful effect on studio executives . Michael Tadross convinced authorities to close busy areas such as the Grand Central Terminal viaduct , several blocks of Fifth Avenue , and Washington Square Park . The film was shot primarily in the anamorphic format , with flashback scenes shot in Super 35 . 
 Filming began on September 23 , 2006 . The Marcy Avenue Armory in Williamsburg was used for the interior of Neville 's home , while Greenwich Village was used for the exterior . Other locations include the Tribeca section of lower Manhattan , the aircraft carrier Intrepid , the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx , and St. Patrick 's Cathedral . Weeds were imported from Florida and were strewn across locations to make the city look like it had been overgrown with them . The closure of major streets was controversial with New Yorkers . Will Smith said , " I don 't think anyone 's going to be able to do that in New York again anytime soon . People were not happy . That 's the most middle fingers I 've ever gotten in my career . " 
 A bridge scene was filmed for six consecutive nights in January on the Brooklyn Bridge to serve as a flashback scene in which New York 's citizens evacuate the city . Shooting the scene consumed $ 5 million of the film 's reported $ 150 million budget , which was likely the most expensive shoot in the city to date . The scene , which had to meet requirements from 14 government agencies , involved 250 crew members and 1 @,@ 000 extras , including 160 National Guard members . Also present were several Humvees , three <unk> , a 110 @-@ foot ( 34 m ) cutter , a 41 @-@ foot ( 12 m ) utility boat , and two 25 @-@ foot ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) response boat small craft , as well as other vehicles including taxis , police cars , fire trucks , and ambulances . Filming concluded on March 31 , 2007 . Computer @-@ generated imagery ( CGI ) was used to depict the main spans of the Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan Bridge collapsing as missiles from passing military jets blew them up to quarantine Manhattan island . 
 Reshoots were conducted around November 2007 . Lawrence noted , " We weren 't seeing fully rendered shots until about a month ago . The movie starts to take on a whole other life . It 's not until later that you can judge a movie as a whole and go , ' Huh , maybe we should shoot this little piece in the middle , or tweak this a little bit . ' It just so happened that our re @-@ shoots revolved around the end of the movie . "

 A week into filming , Francis felt the infected ( referred to as " Darkseekers " or " hemocytes " in the script ) , who were being portrayed by actors wearing prosthetics , were not convincing . His decision to use CGI resulted in an increased budget and extended post @-@ production , although the end results were not always well received . The concept behind the infected was that their adrenal glands were open all of the time and Lawrence explained , " They needed to have an abandon in their performance that you just can ’ t get out of people in the middle of the night when they ’ re barefoot . And their metabolisms are really spiked , so they ’ re constantly hyperventilating , which you can ’ t really get actors to do for a long time or they pass out . " The actors remained on set to provide motion capture . " The film 's producers and sound people wanted the creatures in the movie to sound somewhat human , but not the standard " , so Mike Patton , lead singer of Faith No More , was engaged to provide the screams and howls of the infected . 
 In addition , CGI was used for the lions and deer in the film , and to erase pedestrians in shots of New York . Workers visible in windows , spectators , and moving cars in the distance were all removed . In his vision of an empty New York , Lawrence cited John Ford as his influence : " We didn 't want to make an apocalyptic movie where the landscape felt apocalyptic . A lot of the movie takes place on a beautiful day . There 's something magical about the empty city as opposed to dark and scary that was the ideal that the cast and crew wanted . "

 I Am Legend was originally slated for a November 21 , 2007 , release in the United States and Canada , but was delayed to December 14 . The film opened on December 26 , 2007 , in the United Kingdom , and Ireland , having been originally scheduled for January 4 , 2008 . 
 In December 2007 , China temporarily suspended the release of all American films in the country , which is believed to have delayed the release of I Am Legend . Will Smith spoke to the chairman of China Film Group about securing a release date , later explaining , " We struggled very , very hard to try to get it to work out , but there are only a certain amount of foreign films that are allowed in . " 
 Premieres were held in Tokyo , New York , and London . At the London premiere in Leicester Square , British comedian and actor <unk> Dupree was arrested after pushing his way onto the red carpet and running around shouting " I am Legend ! " . The stunt was part of his " <unk> 's Urban Sports " section of comedy game show Balls of Steel .

 A tie @-@ in comic from DC Comics and Vertigo Comics has been created , I Am Legend : Awakening . The project draws upon collaboration from Bill Sienkiewicz , screenwriter Mark Protosevich , and author Orson Scott Card . The son of the original book 's author , Richard Christian Matheson , also collaborated on the project . The project will advance from the comic to an online format in which animated featurettes ( created by the team from Broken Saints ) will be shown on the official website . 
 In October 2007 , Warner Bros. Pictures , in conjunction with the Electric Sheep Company , launched the online multiplayer game I Am Legend : Survival in the virtual world Second Life . The game is the largest launched in the virtual world in support of a film release , permitting people to play against each other as the infected or the uninfected across a replicated 60 acres ( 240 @,@ 000 m2 ) of New York City . The studio also hired the ad agency Crew Creative to develop a website that would be specifically viewable on the iPhone .

 Most critics were favorable towards the film . The consensus among favorable reviews was that Will Smith 's performance and slow pace overcame questionable special effects . Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 70 % , based on 207 reviews . At the similar website Metacritic , which assigns a rating out of 100 to each review , the film has received an average score of 65 , based on 37 reviews . 
 A. O. Scott wrote that Will Smith gave a " graceful and effortless performance " and also noted the " third @-@ act collapse " . He felt that the movie " does ponder some pretty deep questions about the collapse and persistence of human civilization " . Dana Stevens of Slate wrote that the movie lost its way around the hour mark , noting that " the Infected just aren 't that scary . " NPR critic Bob Mondello noted the film 's subtext concerning global terrorism and that this aspect made the film fit in perfectly with other , more direct cinematic explorations of the subject . Richard Roeper gave the film a positive review on the television program At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper , commending Will Smith as being in " prime form " , also saying there are " some amazing sequences " and that there was " a pretty heavy screenplay for an action film . " The film has been criticized for diverging from Matheson 's novel , especially in its portrayal of a specifically Christian theme . Much of the negative criticism concerned the film 's third act , with some critics favoring the alternative ending in the DVD release . 
 Popular Mechanics published an article on December 14 , 2007 , addressing some of the scientific issues raised by the film : 
 the rate of deterioration of urban structures , infrastructure , and survival of fauna and flora 
 the plausibility of a retrovirus spreading out of control as depicted in the film ( The measles virus depicted in the film , however , is not a retrovirus , but is in fact a part of the <unk> family . ) 
 the mechanics of the Brooklyn Bridge 's destruction 
 The magazine solicited reactions from Alan Weisman , author of The World Without Us , virologist W. Ian Lipkin , MD , and Michel Bruneau , PhD , comparing their predictions with the film 's depictions . The article raised the most questions regarding the virus ' mutation and the medical results , and pointed out that a suspension bridge like the Brooklyn Bridge would likely completely collapse rather than losing only its middle span . Neville 's method of producing power using gasoline @-@ powered generators seemed the most credible : " This part of the tale is possible , if not entirely likely , " Popular Mechanics editor Roy <unk> says . 
 Philosopher Slavoj <unk> criticized the film politically as being the most regressive adaptation from the novel . He claimed that while the original novel had a progressive multicultural message where Neville became a " legend " to the new creatures and is subsequently killed by them ( much like vampires were legends to humans ) , the 2007 film finds a cure for the Darkseekers and it is delivered by a survivor through apparent divine intervention . According to <unk> , this misses the original message and " openly opt [ s ] for religious fundamentalism . "

 I Am Legend earned four nominations for the Visual Effects Society awards , and was also nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble at the Screen Actors Guild Awards , Outstanding Film and Actor at the Image Awards , and Best Sound at the Satellite Awards .

 Francis Lawrence said in late 2008 that there would be a prequel and that Will Smith would be reprising his role . He stated that the film would reveal what happens to Neville before the infected take over New York . D. B. Weiss was recruited to write the script , while Lawrence would direct " if we figure out the story " . Smith stated the film would have Neville and his team going from New York City to Washington , D.C. and back again , as they made their last stand . The film would again explore the premise of what it is like to be alone , as Lawrence explained , " ... the tough thing is , how do we do that again and in a different way ? " 
 On May 3 , 2011 , Francis Lawrence stated that , so far as it involved him , the prequel was dead , with Lawrence stating , " I don 't think that 's ever going to happen . " 
 In 2012 , Warner Bros. announced that deals had been made to produce " another installment " ( not necessarily the rumored prequel ) , with the intention of having Will Smith reprise his role .

 In April 2014 , Warner Bros. bought a spec script entitled A Garden at the End of the World , described as a postapocalyptic variation of The Searchers . Studio executives found so many similarities to I Am Legend in the screenplay , they asked the writer , Gary Graham , to rewrite it so it could serve as a reboot of the earlier film , hoping to create a new franchise . Will Smith , who is known for his reluctance to appear in sequels , is not expected to appear in the new film . 
 = HMS Highlander ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Highlander was an H @-@ class destroyer that had originally been ordered by the Brazilian Navy with the name <unk> in the late 1930s , but was bought by the Royal Navy after the beginning of World War II in September 1939 and later renamed . When completed in March 1940 , she was assigned to the 9th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet . The ship was assigned to convoy escort duties in June with the Western Approaches Command , sinking one German submarine in October . Highlander was transferred to Freetown , Sierra Leone in mid @-@ 1941 to escort convoys off West Africa , but returned to the United Kingdom in August . She became flotilla leader of Escort Group B @-@ 4 of the Mid @-@ Ocean Escort Force in early 1942 and continued to escort convoys in the North Atlantic for the rest of the war . The ship became a target ship after the war ended and was sold for scrap in mid @-@ 1946 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Highlander displaced 1 @,@ 350 long tons ( 1 @,@ 370 t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 883 long tons ( 1 @,@ 913 t ) at deep load . The ship had an overall length of 323 feet ( 98 @.@ 5 m ) , a beam of 33 feet ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 5 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines , driving two shafts , which developed a total of 34 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 25 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3 @-@ drum water @-@ tube boilers . Highlander carried a maximum of 470 long tons ( 480 t ) of fuel oil , giving her a range of 5 @,@ 530 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 240 km ; 6 @,@ 360 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ship 's complement was 152 officers and men . 
 The vessel was designed for four 45 @-@ calibre 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch Mk IX guns in single mounts , designated ' A ' , ' B ' , ' X ' , and ' Y ' from front to rear , but ' Y ' gun was removed to compensate for the additional depth charges added . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , Highlander had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0 @.@ 5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun . She was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedoes . One depth charge rail and two throwers were originally fitted , but this was increased to three sets of rails and eight throwers while fitting @-@ out . The ship 's load of depth charges was increased from 20 to 110 as well . 
 Highlander was completed without a director @-@ control tower ( DCT ) so the three remaining 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch low @-@ angle guns fired in local control using ranges provided by a rangefinder . She was fitted with an ASDIC set to detect submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water . 
 = = = Wartime modifications = = = 
 Little data on Highlander 's modifications during the war has survived , although it is known that she had her rear torpedo tubes replaced by a 12 @-@ pounder AA gun in July 1940 . The ship 's short @-@ range AA armament was later augmented by two Oerlikon 20 mm guns on the wings of the ship 's bridge and the .50 @-@ calibre machine gun mounts were replaced by a pair of Oerlikons . It is uncertain if the ship 's director @-@ control tower was installed before a Type 271 target indication radar was installed above the bridge . At some point , the ship was converted to an escort destroyer . ' A ' gun was replaced by a Hedgehog anti @-@ submarine spigot mortar and additional depth charge stowage replaced the 12 @-@ pounder high @-@ angle gun . A Type 286 short @-@ range surface search radar was fitted as well as a HF / DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast .

 She was originally ordered as <unk> on 16 December 1937 by the Brazilian Navy . The ship was laid down by John I. Thornycroft and Company at Woolston , Hampshire on 28 September 1938 and was purchased by the British on 5 September 1939 after the beginning of World War II . Renamed HMS Highlander , she was launched on 16 October and commissioned on 18 March 1940 . After working up at Portland Harbour , she was assigned to the 9th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet and began escort duty on 11 April . Six days later , the ship ran aground in the Shetland Islands and was moderately damaged . Re @-@ floated , Highlander was repaired at Hull between 20 April and 19 May . She escorted the battlecruiser Renown to Scapa Flow and arrived there on 24 May . The flotilla was transferred to the Western Approaches Command in mid @-@ June and Highlander rescued survivors of the torpedoed armed merchant cruiser Scotstoun en route to Plymouth . Later in the month , the ship escorted ships evacuating Allied troops from French ports on the Atlantic coast ( Operation Ariel ) . 
 Highlander then rejoined the 9th Destroyer Flotilla on convoy escort duties until January 1941 . During this time , she was briefly refitted in mid @-@ July with a 12 @-@ pounder AA gun replacing her rear set of torpedo tubes and , together with her sister Harvester , the ship sank the German submarine U @-@ 32 on 30 October . On 1 December , she escorted the torpedoed Canadian destroyer HMCS Saguenay to Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness for repairs . Highlander began a longer refit at Hawthorn Leslie 's shipyard at Hebburn from 30 January to 23 March 1941 . After its completion , the ship was briefly assigned to Force H at Gibraltar , before continuing on to Freetown to begin escort duties with the 18th Destroyer Flotilla there . She remained there until August when she was transferred to Londonderry where she was later assigned to the 28th Escort Group of Western Approaches Command . 
 Highlander was refitted and rearmed from 2 February – 18 March 1942 at Tilbury . She became flotilla leader for Escort Group B4 and was assigned to the Mid @-@ Ocean Escort Force when her refit was completed . The ship and her consorts escorted Convoy SC 122 through the largest convoy battle of the war in March 1943 ; Highlander was unsuccessfully attacked by U @-@ 441 and U @-@ 608 during the battle . The ship was given an extensive overhaul at Troon from 28 December – 12 April 1944 that was lengthened when she was damaged in a collision with a tugboat . Upon its completion , she rejoined her group and remained with them until September when she was transferred to Escort Group B2 and became its flotilla leader . Highlander crushed her bow on 15 April 1945 when she struck some ice ; she had to be towed to Bay Bulls , Newfoundland , for temporary repairs . She received permanent repairs at nearby St. John 's from 17 April to 24 July . The ship reached Portsmouth five days later and later sailed to Rosyth for service as a target ship for aircraft . Highlander was placed in Category C reserve on 19 January 1946 and was approved for scrapping on 19 February 1946 . She was sold on 27 May , but demolition did not begin until May 1947 .

 Chelsea centre back Frank Sinclair and left back Graeme Le Saux were both sidelined for the final due to their calf injuries , causing player @-@ manager Vialli to swap them with Michael Duberry , and Danny Granville , who had recovered from an abscess pain . Central midfielder Poyet was also included in the starting line @-@ up to join captain Dennis Wise , after returning from a damaged cruciate ligament . Together with forward and lead goalscorer Vialli , Flo began in the attack , instead of Zola , who was named as a substitute , despite making an improvement from his damaged groin , sustained in a league fixture against Liverpool in April . 
 Stuttgart suffered from no player injuries , but defenders Frank Verlaat and Martin <unk> 's bans , prevented them from taking part in the game , leading to manager Joachim Löw to replace Verlaat , with midfielder Murat Yakin as <unk> , and Thomas Berthold taking over <unk> 's role in the middle .

 Chelsea 's goalscoring chance came in the fifth minute when Poyet found Di Matteo , who fumbled his opportunity as it went over the goal . Stuttgart almost took the lead through Bobic , who took advantage of Steve Clarke 's poor clearance but Bobic 's attempt went just past the right goalpost . The Germans continued to push forward , as <unk> had a chance on goal , after being found by Poschner , but his shot was kept out by Ed de Goey to mark the first save of the match . Chelsea held on however ; a few minutes later , Poyet ran towards the ball to direct a powerful volley on goal following a weak clearing header from Berthold , but a well @-@ placed Franz Wohlfahrt dived to read the attempt . Chelsea had another chance before half time , which saw Wise from a Di Matteo free kick launch another volley , with the successive effort going just off the target .

 Prior to the first half , Chelsea continued to dominate possession and round @-@ up more opportunities – the ball was given to Wise , after cooperation between Petrescu and Vialli , whose shot went just across the left goal . It did not take long , before Granville generated another endeavor for Chelsea to make Wohlfahrt throw himself to the right in order to prevent the shot . The club made its first substitute change in the 71st minute , which saw Flo being replaced by Zola . He made an effect immediately , picking up the ball after a well @-@ timed pass by Wise , and finishing with a half volley in the penalty box , past Wohlfahrt , which found its way straight in the top right corner . As the match went on , Petrescu was sent off for an illegal tackle on Yakin . It did not affect Chelsea as Stuttgart failed to produce anything to turn the final in their favour . Stuttgart 's situation proved worse when they were also reduced to ten men , as Poschner was dismissed after quarrels with referee Braschi .

 Following Chelsea 's victory , player @-@ manager Vialli was satisfied with his club 's performance , commending the substitution of Zola by assistant manager Graham Rix : " He decided he had a feeling and he was right " . Vialli also praised Zola , but felt that the honours had to be shared by all the players including Vialli himself , who took part in the match : " It was a great first touch – he put the ball in the net and we won the cup . But the credit has to be shared between all the chaps – and I am over the moon . " The Italian further added that their goal now was to win the league championship : " The next step will be the Premier League , fingers crossed . I am still the player @-@ manager and I have to be one next season . We are very happy to win , but we do not want to stop here . We want to keep improving and next season we will start trying to win the Premier League , which is our aim now . " 
 Zola himself was happy with his achievements to the Chelsea side , but when asked if his substitution was all projected , he denied it , stating : " It wasn 't planned . In the moment , I used my positive strength and I got a reward for the passion , the work not only I , but the masseur Mimmo <unk> did together in Rimini . The injury should take one month to heal , Mimmo <unk> helped me be fit in less than half that . I thank this man for a beautiful moment which will be in my heart for as long as I can remember . " Their victory meant Aston Villa gained a place in the 1998 – 99 UEFA Cup . 
 Stuttgart manager Joachim Löw was disappointed with the defeat , but remained confident about his future at the team , as well as the season : " I 'm calmly looking forward to the discussion . The club has to approach me . I have a contract until 1999 . There must be some tough words . For me , the season has been positive " . His word was also shared by Bobic who felt that his team were treated unfairly to the goal , also taking time to defend Löw : " We need to talk about mistakes and learn from them , it does not mean that it is necessary to change the manager " . He added : " It is bitter to lose by such a goal " . However , Verlaat dissented , and criticised Stuttgart 's campaign : " The club has to make up its mind finally . We could have done better this season . We carelessly squandered about eight games " . Yakin agreed and offered his own comments : " You have to talk about many things , you cannot work together in the way it was this year . "
