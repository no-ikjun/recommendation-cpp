 = = = Syntax = = = 
 Syntax refers to patterns for combining words and phrases to make clauses and sentences . Verbal and nominal inflectional morphology are central to Ottawa syntax , as they mark grammatical information on verbs and nouns to a greater extent than in English ( which has few inflections , and relies mainly on word order ) . Preferred word orders in a simple transitive sentence are verb @-@ initial , such as verb – object – subject ( VOS ) and VSO . While verb @-@ final orders are avoided , all logically possible orders are attested . Ottawa word order displays considerably more freedom than is found in languages such as English , and word order frequently reflects discourse @-@ based distinctions such as topic and focus . 
 Verbs are marked for grammatical information in three distinct sets of inflectional paradigms , called Verb orders . Each order corresponds generally to one of three main sentence types : the Independent order is used in main clauses , the Conjunct order in subordinate clauses , and the Imperative order in commands . 
 Ottawa distinguishes yes @-@ no questions , which use a verb form in the Independent order , from content questions formed with the Ottawa equivalents of " what " , " where " , " when " , " who " and others , which require verbs inflected in the Conjunct order . 
 Ottawa distinguishes two types of grammatical third person in sentences , marked on both verbs and animate nouns . The proximate form indicates a more salient noun phrase , and obviative indicates a less prominent noun phrase . Selection and use of proximate or obviative forms is a distinctive aspect of Ottawa syntax that indicates the relative discourse prominence of noun phrases containing third persons ; it does not have a direct analogue in English grammar . 
 = = Vocabulary = = 
 Few vocabulary items are considered unique to Ottawa . The influx of speakers of other Ojibwe dialects into the Ottawa area has resulted in mixing of dialects that were historically distinct . Given that vocabulary spreads readily from one dialect to another the presence of a particular vocabulary item in a given dialect is not a guarantee of the original source of the item . Two groups of function words are characteristically Ottawa : the sets of demonstrative pronouns and interrogative adverbs are both distinctive relative to other dialects of Ojibwe . Although some of the vocabulary items in each set are found in other dialects , taken as a group each is uniquely Ottawa . 
 = = = Demonstrative pronouns = = = 
 Ottawa uses a set of demonstrative pronouns that contains terms unique to Ottawa , while other words in the set are shared with other Ojibwe dialects . Taken as a group the Ottawa set is distinctive . The following chart shows the demonstrative pronouns for : ( a ) Wikwemikong , an Ottawa community ; ( b ) Curve Lake , an Eastern Ojibwe community ; and ( c ) Cape Croker , an Ottawa community that uses a mixed pronoun set . The terms maaba ' this ( animate ) ' , <unk> ' these ( animate ) ' , and <unk> ' these ( inanimate ) ' are unique to Ottawa . 
 = = = <unk> pronouns and adverbs = = = 
 Ottawa interrogative pronouns and adverbs frequently have the emphatic pronoun dash fused with them to form a single word . In this table the emphatic pronoun is written as <unk> immediately following the main word . 
 = = = Other vocabulary = = = 
 A small number of vocabulary items are characteristically Ottawa . Although these items are robustly attested in Ottawa , they have also been reported in some other communities . 
 = = Writing system = = 
 Written representation of Ojibwe dialects , including Ottawa , was introduced by European explorers , missionaries and traders who were speakers of English and French . They wrote Ottawa words and sentences using the letters and orthographic conventions of their own languages , adapting them to the unfamiliar new language . Indigenous writing in Ottawa was also based upon English or French , but only occurred sporadically through the 19th and 20th centuries . Modern focus on literacy and use of written forms of the language has increased in the context of second language learning , where mastery of written language is viewed as a component of the language learning process . Although there has never been a generally accepted standard written form of Ottawa , interest in standardization has increased with the publication of a widely used dictionary in 1985 and reference grammar in 2001 , which provide models for spelling conventions . A conference held in 1996 brought together speakers of all dialects of Ojibwe to review existing writing systems and make proposals for standardization . 
 = = = Early orthographic practices = = = 
 19th @-@ century missionary authors who wrote in Ottawa include Catholic missionary Frederic Baraga and Anglican Frederick O ’ Meara ( illustration , this section ) . Ottawa speaker Andrew Blackbird wrote a history of his people in English ; an appended grammatical description of Ottawa and the Southwestern Ojibwe ( Chippewa ) dialect also contains vocabulary lists , short phrases , and translations of the Ten Commandments and the Lord 's Prayer . Accurate transcriptions of Ottawa date from linguist Leonard Bloomfield ’ s research with Ottawa speakers in the late 1930s and early 1940s . 
 A tradition of indigenous literacy in Ottawa arose in the 19th century , as speakers of Ottawa on Manitoulin Island became literate in their own language . Manitoulin Island Ottawas who were Catholic learned to write from French Catholic missionaries using a French @-@ influenced orthography , while Methodist and Anglican converts used English @-@ based orthographies . Documents written in Ottawa by Ottawa speakers on Manitoulin Island between 1823 and 1910 include official letters and petitions , personal documents , official Indian band regulations , an official proclamation , and census statements prepared by individuals . Ottawa speakers from Manitoulin Island contributed articles to <unk> <unk> ( " the Praying Indian " ) , an Ojibwe newspaper started by Franciscan missionaries and published in Harbor Springs , Michigan between 1896 and 1902 . 
 It has been suggested that Ottawa speakers were among the groups that used the Great Lakes Algonquian syllabary , a syllabic writing system derived from a European @-@ based alphabetic orthography , but supporting evidence is weak . 
 = = = Modern orthography = = = 
 Although there is no standard or official writing system for Ottawa , a widely accepted system is used in a recent dictionary of Ottawa and Eastern Ojibwe , a collection of texts , and a descriptive grammar . The same system is taught in programs for Ojibwe language teachers . One of its goals is to promote standardization of Ottawa writing so that language learners are able to read and write in a consistent way . By comparison , folk phonetic spelling approaches to writing Ottawa based on less systematic adaptations of written English or French are more variable and idiosyncratic , and do not always make consistent use of alphabetic letters . While the modern orthography is used in a number of prominent publications , its acceptance is not universal . Prominent Ottawa author Basil Johnston has explicitly rejected it , preferring to use a form of folk spelling in which the correspondences between sounds and letters are less systematic . Similarly , a lexicon representing Ottawa as spoken in Michigan and another based on Ottawa in Oklahoma , use English @-@ based folk spellings distinct from that employed by Johnson . 
 The Ottawa writing system is a minor adaptation of a very similar one used for other dialects of Ojibwe in Ontario and the United States , and widely employed in reference materials and text collections . Sometimes referred to as the Double Vowel system because it uses doubled vowel symbols to represent Ottawa long vowels that are paired with corresponding short vowels , it is an adaptation attributed to Charles Fiero of the linguistically oriented system found in publications such as Leonard Bloomfield ’ s Eastern Ojibwa . Letters of the English alphabet substitute for specialized phonetic symbols , in conjunction with orthographic conventions unique to Ottawa . The system embodies two basic principles : ( 1 ) alphabetic letters from the English alphabet are used to write Ottawa , but with Ottawa sound values ; ( 2 ) the system is phonemic in nature , in that each letter or letter combination indicates its basic sound value , and does not reflect all the phonetic detail that occurs . Accurate pronunciation cannot be learned without consulting a fluent speaker . 
 The Ottawa variant of this system uses the following consonant letters or digraphs : 
 b , ch , d , f , g , h , j , k , l , m , n , p , r , s , sh , t , w , y , z , zh 
 The letters f , l , and r are found in loan words , such as <unk> " give me a call " and <unk> " in the refrigerator " . Loan words that have recently been borrowed from English are typically written in standard English orthography . 
 The letter h is used for the glottal stop [ ʔ ] , which is represented in the broader Ojibwe version with the apostrophe . In Ottawa the apostrophe is reserved for a separate function noted below . In a few primarily expressive words , orthographic h has the phonetic value [ h ] : aa <unk> " OK " . 
 Vowels are represented as follows : 
 Long ii , oo , aa , e ; Short i , o , a 
 By convention the three long vowels that correspond to a short vowel are written double , while the single long vowel written as orthographic e that does not have a corresponding short vowel is not written doubled . 
 The apostrophe ’ is used to distinguish primary ( underlying ) consonant clusters from secondary clusters that arise when the rule of syncope deletes a vowel between two consonants . For example , orthographic ng must be distinguished from n ’ g . The former has the phonetic value [ ŋ ] ( arising from place of articulation assimilation of / n / to the following velar consonant / ɡ / , which is then deleted in word @-@ final position as in <unk> [ <unk> ] " at the island " ) , while the latter has the phonetic value [ <unk> ] as in san ’ goo [ <unk> ] " black squirrel " . 
 = = History = = 
 In the general model of linguistic change , " a single ancestor language ( a proto @-@ language ) develops dialects which in time through the accumulation of changes become distinct languages . " Continued changes in the descendant languages result in the development of dialects which again over time develop into distinct languages . The Ojibwe language is a historical descendant of Proto @-@ Algonquian , the reconstructed ancestor language of the Algonquian languages . Ojibwe has subsequently developed a series of dialects including Ottawa , which is one of the three dialects of Ojibwe that has innovated the most through its historical development , along with Severn Ojibwe and Algonquin . 
 = = Sample text = = 
 Traditional Ottawa stories fall into two general categories , <unk> " legend , sacred story " and <unk> " narrative , story " . Stories in the <unk> category involve mythical beings such as the trickster character <unk> . Stories in the <unk> category include traditional stories that do not necessarily involve mythical characters , although the term is also used more generally to refer to any story not in the <unk> category . Published Ottawa texts include a range of genres , including historical narratives , stories of conflict with other indigenous groups , humorous stories , and others . 
 Ottawa speaker Andrew Medler dictated the following text while working with linguist Leonard Bloomfield in a linguistic field methods class at the 1939 Linguistic Society of America Summer Institute . Medler grew up near Saginaw , Michigan but spent most of his life at Walpole Island . The texts that Medler dictated were originally published in a linguistically oriented transcription using phonetic symbols , and have been republished in a revised edition that uses the modern orthography and includes detailed linguistic analyses of each text .

 " The Hand of St. Sebastian " is the eighth episode of the second season of the American crime @-@ thriller television series Millennium . It originally aired on the Fox network on November 14 , 1997 . The episode was written by Glen Morgan and James Wong , and directed by Thomas J. Wright . " The Hand of St. Sebastian " featured a guest appearance from C. C. H. Pounder . 
 Millennium Group offender profilers Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) and Peter Watts ( Terry O 'Quinn ) travel to Germany to locate a preserved relic of Saint Sebastian , unintentionally discovering cracks within the unity of the Group . 
 " The Hand of St. Sebastian " was inspired by Wong 's research into Freemasonry and the Knights Templar ; Wong wanted to replicate the disharmony of these societies within the Millennium Group . The episode has received mixed responses from critics , and was viewed by approximately 6 @.@ 7 percent of the available audience in its initial broadcast . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In 998 , a monk is betrayed by his compatriot , and shot to death by archers . As they search his robe to find their objective — the mummified hand of Saint Sebastian — they notices a tattoo on the man 's body ; an ouroboros , symbol of the Millennium Group . 
 In 1998 , modern Group member Peter Watts ( Terry O 'Quinn ) asks his colleague Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) for help with a case the Group have not authorized ; he remains cryptic as to what it is . They travel to Germany to investigate the murder of a Dr. Schlossburg , whose lab is found to house a mummified body . The two are arrested by German police , but when the police realize they have apprehended fellow investigators they promise cooperation . However , the pair learn that Schlossburg has already been cremated ; later they narrowly escape death when their rental car has been rigged with a car bomb . 
 Black connects the attempt on their lives to Schlossburg 's murder . He demands details of the case from Watts , who explains that the mummy found earlier dates to early Christianity , the time when the Millennium Group first convened . However , they realize they are being tailed by two men , and return to their hotel . There , they are met by Cheryl Andrews ( C. C. H. Pounder ) , a fellow Group member who has worked with them in the past . She offers her help but Watts declines it . Watts is later able to access Schlossburg 's computer files ; meanwhile , the doctor is found to be alive , regaining consciousness in a hospital bed and telling police his assailant was Watts . 
 Andrews tells Black she has been sent to prevent Watts acting outside the Group 's remit ; she gives Black a contact number and leaves . Later , Black returns to Schlossburg 's lab and finds Watts , who explains that a knightly order , the Knights Chroniclers , had possessed the relic of Saint Sebastian at the turn of the second millennium ; the hand imparts knowledge to its possessor that will help to overcome the evils associated with the turn of the millennium . Watts reveals that Schlossburg had uncovered the order 's burial ground . 
 Black and Watts learn that Schlossburg is alive and visit him ; the doctor does not recognize Watts , but insists that his attacker identified himself as " Peter Watts " . He reveals the locations of the burial ground , in a peat bog . Black and Watts leave to reach it ; Schlossburg is murdered shortly afterwards by two assassins . At the bog , the pair find a mummified corpse clutching the relic ; however , they have been followed by the police , and Watts is arrested for Schlossburg 's murder . Black tracks down Andrews at the storage building where the relic has been taken . They are ambushed by the two assassins , and during their escape , Black mentions where the relic is hidden . Andrews immediately turns on Black ; the ambush was a trick to draw the information out of Black , while she had engineered events to use Watts as a fall man to discredit the Group . However , the police are able to intervene , hearing everything and rescuing Black . Later , Watts and Black study the relic , but Black is convinced that their own convictions will be more important to them than mystical artefacts .

 " The Hand of St. Sebastian " was written by frequent collaborators Glen Morgan and James Wong . It was the ninth episode to have been written by the pair , who had penned several across the first and second seasons . The pair had also taken the roles of co @-@ executive producers for the season . " The Hand of St. Sebastian " was directed by Thomas J. Wright ; Wright had directed eight episodes previously and would helm a further seventeen over the series ' run . Wright would also go on to direct " Millennium " , the series ' crossover episode with its sister show The X @-@ Files . 
 The episode was driven by Wong 's desire to write an episode focussing on Watts , as he wanted to showcase O 'Quinn as an actor . Wong also felt " that by revealing that the Millennium Group had existed for centuries and setting the episode overseas , that would give the story greater scope and weight " . The introduction of schisms within the Group was inspired by Wong 's research into the Knights Templar and Freemasonry , as he considered these secretive organizations to have mirrored the way he wanted to present the Group , and he felt each contained factions or reactionary elements which he wanted to recreate . The episode features the penultimate appearance by C. C. H. Pounder as pathologist Cheryl Andrews . Pounder portrayed the character in four other episodes , appearing across all three seasons .

 " The Hand of St. Sebastian " was first broadcast on the Fox network on November 14 , 1997 . The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 6 @.@ 7 during its original broadcast , meaning that 6 @.@ 7 percent of households in the United States viewed the episode . This represented approximately 6 @.@ 566 million households , and left the episode the eightieth most @-@ viewed broadcast that week . 
 " The Hand of St. Sebastian " has received mixed responses from critics . The A.V. Club 's Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a " B + " , finding it to contain an entertaining mix of mysticism and espionage . However , he considered the revelation that Andrews was a turncoat within the Group to be confusing , finding it unclear how a human villain could be defined within a series already making use of demons and theological evil . Bill Gibron , writing for DVD Talk , rated the episode 4 @.@ 5 out of 5 , praising the guest performances by Pounder and Hall . Gibron wrote that the episode had a " feature film " feel , and described it as one of the best episodes of the season . 
 However , Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated " The Hand of St. Sebastian " one star out of five . Shearman felt that by this point , the series no longer resembled what it had been in its previous season , derisively comparing it to the Indiana Jones film series . He wrote that Henriksen 's portrayal of Frank Black seemed " weakened " in the episode , as the actor had built a credible and deep character who now seemed entirely unlike his former self . 
 = Pedra Branca , Singapore = 
 Pedra Branca ( formerly referred to by Malaysia as Pulau Batu Puteh and now as Batu Puteh ) is an outlying island and also the easternmost point of Singapore . The name means " white rock " in Portuguese ( Portuguese pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ̃ <unk> ] ) , and refers to whitish guano ( bird droppings ) deposited on the rock . The island consists of a small outcrop of granite rocks with an area of about 8 @,@ 560 square metres ( 92 @,@ 100 sq ft ) . During the low water spring tide it measures , at its longest , 137 metres ( 449 ft ) and has an average width of 60 metres ( 200 ft ) . Despite being under Singapore 's sovereignty , the island has a unique distinction of not being located in any planning area , <unk> or political constituency in the country . Pedra Branca is situated at 1 ° 19 ′ 48 ″ N 104 ° 24 ′ 27 ″ E , where the Singapore Strait meets the South China Sea . 
 There are two maritime features near Pedra Branca . Middle Rocks , under the sovereignty of Malaysia , consists of two clusters of small rocks about 250 metres ( 820 ft ) apart situated 0 @.@ 6 nautical miles ( 1 @.@ 1 km ; 0 @.@ 7 mi ) south of Pedra Branca . South Ledge , which is 2 @.@ 2 nautical miles ( 4 @.@ 1 km ; 2 @.@ 5 mi ) to the south @-@ south @-@ west of Pedra Branca , is a rock formation visible only at low @-@ tide . 
 Pedra Branca was known to sailors for centuries . It was originally within the territory of the Johor Sultanate , which was founded in 1528 , and remained under the new Sultanate of Johor under the British sphere of influence following the signing of the Anglo – Dutch Treaty of 1824 between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands . Between 1850 and 1851 , the British built Horsburgh Lighthouse on the island without seeking the consent of the Johor authorities , or even informing them of the decision . From that time , the Straits Settlements administered the island ; Singapore then assumed responsibility in 1946 after the dissolution of the Straits Settlements . On 21 September 1953 , the Acting State Secretary of Johor , responding to a query from the Colonial Secretary of Singapore about the status of the island , stated that " the Johore Government does not claim ownership of Pedra Branca " . 
 On 21 December 1979 , Malaysia published a map that showed the island to be within its territorial waters . This ignited a 29 @-@ year territorial dispute which , together with the issue of sovereignty over the nearby maritime features of Middle Rocks and South Ledge , the disputants presented to the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) for resolution . On 23 May 2008 the ICJ ruled that Pedra Branca was under Singapore 's sovereignty . Although the island had originally been under the sovereignty of the Johor Sultanate , the United Kingdom and Singapore had carried out various acts of sovereignty in respect of the island . The failure of Malaysia and its predecessors to respond to these acts , and other actions that demonstrated their acknowledgment of Singapore 's sovereignty over the island , meant that Singapore had gained sovereignty over Pedra Branca . On the other hand , Middle Rocks remains part of Malaysian territory as Singapore had not manifested any acts of sovereignty in respect of it . The Court did not rule definitively on the remaining outcrop , South Ledge , merely declaring that it belonged to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located . Malaysia and Singapore have established what they have named the Joint Technical Committee to delimit the maritime boundary in the area around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks , and to determine the ownership of South Ledge .

 Pedra Branca means " white rock " in Portuguese , and refers to whitish guano ( bird droppings ) deposited on the rock by the black @-@ naped tern , which used the island as a nesting ground . This name is used by both the English @-@ language and Malay @-@ language press in Singapore . Malaysia formerly referred to the island as Pulau Batu Puteh , which means " white rock island " in Malay , but the Government of Malaysia subsequently decided to drop the word Pulau ( " Island " ) . In August 2008 Foreign Minister Rais Yatim said Malaysia considered that the maritime feature did not meet internationally recognised criteria for an island , that is , land inhabited by humans that had economic activity . 
 The island is known in Mandarin as <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) , which means " white reef " . The Tamil name is <unk> ் <unk> <unk> ் <unk> , a transliteration of Pedra Branca .

 Pedra Branca was known to sailors for centuries . Part of the Chinese sailing instructions for the South China Sea based on information compiled by Admiral Zheng He ( 1371 – 1433 ) advised a navigator that after departing Long Ya Men ( Mandarin for " Dragon 's Teeth Gate " ) , a rocky outcrop at the gateway to what is now Keppel Harbour in Singapore , he should steer a course of between 75 ° and 90 ° for five watches until his vessel reached <unk> . Pedra Branca was also mentioned in Dutch voyager Jan <unk> van <unk> 's <unk> ( Itinerary ) , an account of his voyages in the Portuguese East Indies . After the publication of the work in 1596 , the island began appearing regularly on European maps of the Far East . The 1598 English edition of the work stated : 
 From the Cape of Singapura to the hook named <unk> to the east , are 18 miles ; 6 or 7 miles from there lies a <unk> in the sea called Pedra <unk> , or White Rock , where the <unk> that come and <unk> from China doe <unk> passe in greate danger and some are left upon it , whereby the Pilots when they come thither are in greate <unk> for other way than this they have not . 
 Pedra Branca was originally within the territory of the Johor @-@ Riau Sultanate , which was founded in 1528 by Sultan Alauddin <unk> Shah II , the son of Sultan Mahmud Shah of the Malacca Sultanate . In the mid @-@ 17th century , the Dutch Governor of Malacca wrote to the Dutch East India Company , asking it to send two boats to the Straits of Singapore to " cruise to the south of Singapore Straits under the Hook of <unk> and in the vicinity of Pedra Branca " to stop Chinese traders from entering Johor River . The plan was put into force , and two Chinese junks were captured in the Straits and diverted to Malacca . However , this action provoked a protest from the Sultan of Johor , which showed that the Sultan regarded the junks ' seizure as an infringement of his sovereignty in the area . Three letters written in 1824 to the Government of India by the British Resident in Singapore , John Crawfurd , also confirm it was his understanding that all the islands in the region of the Straits of Singapore came under the Johor Sultanate . 
 In addition , other 19th @-@ century documents show that the Sultan of Johor exercised authority over the Orang Laut ( " sea people " ) who inhabited the maritime areas of the Straits of Singapore and visited Pedra Branca . One of these was a letter of November 1850 by John Turnbull Thomson , the Government Surveyor of Singapore , which reported on the need to exclude the Orang Laut from Pedra Branca where Horsburgh Lighthouse was being built . Calling them a " half fishing half piratical sect " , Thomson noted that they " frequently visit the rock so their visits should never be encouraged nor any trust put in them ... In the straits and islets of the neighbouring shores and islands many lives are taken by these people . " 
 On 17 March 1824 , the United Kingdom and the Netherlands signed the Anglo – Dutch Treaty of 1824 . It divided the old Johor Sultanate into two new Sultanates : the new Sultanate of Johor , which would be under the British sphere of influence , and the Sultanate of Riau – Lingga under Dutch influence . Under Article XII of the Treaty , Britain agreed that " no British Establishment shall be made on the Carimon Isles , or on the Island of Bantam , Bintang , Lingin , or on any of the other Islands South of the Straits of Singapore ... " The islands and islets within the Straits fell within the British sphere of influence . This included Pedra Branca , which thus remained part of the territorial domain of the new Johor Sultanate . 
 = = = 1840s to 1851 : Construction of Horsburgh Lighthouse = = = 
 Captain James Horsburgh , a Scottish hydrographer to the British East India Company who had prepared many charts and sailing instructions for the East Indies , China , New Holland , the Cape of Good Hope and other intermediate ports , died in May 1836 . Merchants and mariners felt that the building of one or more lighthouses would be a fitting tribute to him , and in as early as November 1836 Pedra Branca was proposed as one of the preferred sites . By 1844 , preference had been expressed for Romania Outer Island , or Peak Rock . Some time in November 1844 , the Governor of the Straits Settlements , William John Butterworth , wrote to the Sultan and the Temenggung of Johor regarding the matter . His letters have not been found , but English translations of the replies , dated 25 November 1844 , indicate that the Sultan and Temenggung favoured the proposal . In particular , the Temenggung wrote that " the [ East India ] company are at full liberty to put up a Light House there , or any spot deemed eligible " . Three days later , on 28 November , the Governor wrote to the Secretary of the Government in India to recommend that the lighthouse be sited on Peak Rock . Among other things , he said that " [ t ] his Rock is part of the Territories of the Rajah of Johore , who with the <unk> ... have willingly consented to cede it gratuitously to the East India Company " , and enclosed the replies received from the Sultan and Temenggung . Although this was apparently the Governor 's understanding of the situation , he did not communicate it to the Sultan and Temenggung . It is unclear whether the correspondence was limited to Peak Rock or extended to other potential sites for the lighthouse such as Pedra Branca , and whether the sovereignty of Johor over any place chosen for the lighthouse was ceded to the British Government or only a permission to build , maintain and operate a lighthouse was granted . 
 On 22 August 1845 , Governor Butterworth wrote again to the Government of India , indicating he trusted that construction of the lighthouse on Peak Rock would begin soon " as a light in that quarters is becoming daily of more paramount importance " . Between 1824 and 1851 , at least 16 sizeable vessels were wrecked in the vicinity of Pedra Branca and Point Romania ( on the Johor coast ) . However , in April 1846 , the Lords of the Admiralty in London informed the Court of Directors of the East India Company they were inclined to think that Pedra Branca was the best point for the lighthouse . John Thomson and Captain S. <unk> , commander of the East India Company 's steamer called the Hooghly , carried out surveys in May and August . In a report dated 25 August , they said they were " decidedly of opinion that Pedra Branca is the only proper position for a Light to be placed ... for the safety of Shipping whether entering or departing for the Straits of Singapore ... " The following day , Governor Butterworth wrote to the Government of India stating that the Government " will at once perceive that Pedra Branca is the only true position " for the lighthouse . On 30 October 1846 the President in Council in India approved Pedra Branca as the site for the lighthouse . The East India Company gave its approval on 24 February 1847 , and on 10 May of that year the Government of India asked Governor Butterworth to take measures for the construction of the lighthouse . There is no evidence that the authorities in Singapore thought it necessary or desirable to inform the Johor authorities of the decision about the siting of the lighthouse or to seek any consent for its erection . 
 Although the private subscribers wishing to commemorate Horsburgh had raised a sum which , with compound interest , came up to more than 7 @,@ 400 Spanish dollars when it was paid over to the Singapore authorities , there was still a shortfall of funds for the building works . Thus , the Government of India , in agreement with the East India Company , authorised Governor Butterworth to prepare a law imposing a duty on vessels entering Singapore and asked him to take immediate measures to begin constructing the lighthouse . The Light Dues Act 1852 was duly enacted by the Governor @-@ General of India in Council on 30 January 1852 . Thomson , appointed by the Governor as architect for the project , took charge of planning and supervising the construction of Horsburgh Lighthouse . Construction work began in late March or early April 1850 . On Queen Victoria 's birthday , 24 May 1850 , the foundation stone was laid at a ceremony conducted by members of the newly founded Masonic Lodge Zetland in the East No. 749 and attended by the Governor , the commander of the Singapore garrison , a rear admiral and several foreign consuls . The construction of the lighthouse then continued till 21 October , and resumed after the monsoon in April 1851 . Up to 50 workmen were involved , including Chinese carpenters and stonemasons and their Malay assistants , Indian quarrymen and convict labourers , a cook and his assistant , and six lascars to defend the island from attack by pirates . The pirates of the South China Sea were notorious – during the construction of Horsburgh Lighthouse nine Chinese labourers were killed in pirate raids . Building materials and supplies were brought by the Hooghly , supported by two gunboats and two lighters . Unless he was required elsewhere , Thomson stayed on the island to supervise the works . The ceremonial first lighting of the lamp was arranged for 27 September 1851 , again attended by the Governor , Masons of the Zetland Lodge , foreign dignitaries , senior residents of Singapore and other notables ; the Singapore Free Press reported : " A simultaneous rising [ of the guests from the dinner table ] announced that the process of illumination had commenced . Three hearty cheers welcomed the light , the meteor @-@ like brilliancy of which will probably serve to guide the midnight path of the mariner for a thousand years to come . " On 15 October the lighthouse was permanently turned on , and Thomson finally departed Pedra Branca for Singapore on the Hooghly on 18 November 1851 .

 The Light Dues Acts of 1852 and 1854 ( India ) declared that Horsburgh Lighthouse and its appurtenances were the property of and vested in the East India Company . In 1867 , the Straits Settlements , of which Singapore was a part , became a Crown Colony , and by the Straits Settlements Light @-@ Houses Ordinance 1912 , the lighthouse was vested in Singapore . After 1912 , the duties levied on ships passing through the Singapore Strait were abolished ; instead , the costs of the lighthouse were shared by the neighbouring states . 
 In 1946 , following World War II , Singapore became a separate Crown Colony . The other Straits Settlements , Malacca and Penang , joined the Malay states ( including Johor ) to form the Malayan Union . The latter became the Federation of Malaya in 1948 , and the Federation of Malaysia in 1963 . On 17 June 1953 , the Colonial Secretary of Singapore wrote to the British Adviser to the Sultan of Johor to clarify the status of Pedra Branca . He noted that the rock was outside the limits ceded by Sultan Hussein Shah and the Temenggung with the island of Singapore under the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance of 2 August 1824 they had entered into with the East India Company . However , the Colonial Government had been maintaining the lighthouse built on it , and " [ t ] his by international usage no doubt confers some rights and obligations on the Colony " . He therefore asked if " there is any document showing a lease or grant of the rock or whether it has been ceded by the Government of the State of Johore or in any other way disposed of " . The Acting State Secretary of Johor replied on 21 September that " the Johore Government does not claim ownership of Pedra Branca " . This correspondence indicated that as of 1953 Johor understood it did not have sovereignty over Pedra Branca , which had therefore vested in the United Kingdom . 
 The Colony of Singapore became a self @-@ governing state in 1959 , and left the British Empire to join the Federation of Malaysia in 1963 . Two years later , in 1965 , Singapore became a fully independent republic . In 1959 , in an official publication regarding meteorological information collected on Pedra Branca , Malaya listed Horsburgh Lighthouse as a " Singapore " station together with the Sultan Shoal and Raffles Lighthouses . The lighthouse on Pedra Branca was described in the same way in a joint Malaysian and Singaporean publication in 1966 , the year after Singapore left the Federation . In 1967 , when the two countries began reporting meteorological information separately , Malaysia ceased referring to Horsburgh Lighthouse . In maps published by the Malayan and Malaysian Surveyor General and Director of General Mapping in 1962 , 1965 , 1970 , 1974 and 1975 , the island was indicated with the word " ( SINGAPORE ) " or " ( SINGAPURA ) " under it . The same designation was used for an island that was unquestionably under Singapore 's sovereignty . On the other hand , the designation was not used for Pulau Pisang , an island under Malaysian sovereignty on which Singapore operated a lighthouse . 
 Singapore replaced the original kerosene @-@ fired lamp of Horsburgh Lighthouse with automated navigational lights in the 1970s . In 1972 , 1973 , 1974 and 1978 , the Port of Singapore Authority ( PSA ) considered the feasibility of carrying out reclamation of about 5 @,@ 000 square metres ( 54 @,@ 000 sq ft ) of land around Pedra Branca , but did not go ahead with the project . On 30 May 1977 , with the permission of the PSA , the Republic of Singapore Navy installed a military rebroadcast station which it shared with the Republic of Singapore Air Force . Subsequently , the PSA installed a helipad on the eastern half of the island , and a communications tower for its Vessel Traffic Information System for the 900 @-@ odd ships that pass daily through the south and middle channels which are the main shipping channels of the eastern part of the Singapore Strait .

 In the 1980s , Malaysian Marine Police boats entered the waters around Pedra Branca on several occasions . However , both Malaysia and Singapore acted with restraint , the Singapore Navy having been given strict instructions not to escalate matters . In 1989 , the then Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad made an unannounced visit to the vicinity of the island . His boat was intercepted by Singapore naval vessels . To avoid an international incident , he directed his boat to leave . 
 With effect from 27 June 2002 , Pedra Branca was declared a protected area within the meaning of the Protected Areas and Protected Places Act . Consequently , a permit from the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore is required for access to the island , and unauthorised presence there is a criminal offence . On 6 October 2008 , a Singaporean man , Roger Lee , was convicted of illegally landing on Pedra Branca . In court documents , he said he had gone to Batam , Indonesia , in 1998 . He later married and started a family with an Indonesian woman , but she left him in 2007 due to his unstable income and inability to hold down a job . As he had illegally overstayed in Indonesia , and had been cheated of his passport and other personal documents by a friend , Lee hatched a plan to pretend to be a lost fisherman in the hope that the Police Coast Guard would rescue him and take him back to Singapore . On 5 February 2008 he paid a boatman to transport him out to sea in a motorised sampan . As he did not see any coast guard or navy patrols he disembarked on Pedra Branca and was arrested by staff stationed there . Lee pleaded guilty to illegally entering Singapore via an unauthorised landing place . A second charge of being found in a protected place without permission was taken into consideration for sentencing purposes . In mitigation , Lee 's pro bono lawyer said that there was no sign on Pedra Branca warning against trespassing on the island . Lee was sentenced to six weeks ' imprisonment . 
 Speaking at the Singapore Energy Conference on 4 November 2008 , Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew mentioned that the Singapore Government had considered reclaiming land and building a nuclear power plant on Pedra Branca . Such a plant could not be built on the main island of Singapore as international standards require a safety zone of 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) around the plant . However , it was recognised that this was probably not feasible as Pedra Branca is less than 30 kilometres from the Malaysian coast . 
 = = Territorial dispute = = 
 = = = International Court of Justice case = = = 
 On 21 December 1979 , the Director of National Mapping of Malaysia published a map entitled Territorial Waters and Continental Shelf Boundaries of Malaysia showing Pedra Branca to be within its territorial waters . Singapore rejected this claim in a diplomatic note of 14 February 1980 and asked for the map to be corrected . The dispute was not resolved by an exchange of correspondence and intergovernmental talks in 1993 and 1994 . In the first round of talks in February 1993 the issue of sovereignty over Middle Rocks and South Ledge was also raised . Malaysia and Singapore therefore agreed to submit the dispute to the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) , signing a Special Agreement for this purpose in February 2003 and notifying the Court of it in July 2003 . The case was heard at the Peace Palace in The Hague between 6 and 23 November 2007 . 
 The ICJ delivered its judgment on 23 May 2008 . It held that although Pedra Branca had originally been under the sovereignty of Johor , the conduct of Singapore and its predecessors à titre de souverain ( with the title of a sovereign ) and the failure of Malaysia and its predecessors to respond to such conduct showed that by 1980 , when the dispute between the parties arose , sovereignty over the island had passed to Singapore . The relevant conduct on the part of Singapore and its predecessors included investigating marine accidents in the vicinity of the island , planning land reclamation works , installing naval communications equipment , and requiring Malaysian officials wishing to visit the island to obtain permits . In contrast , Johor and its successors had taken no action with respect to the island from June 1850 for a century or more . In 1953 the Acting Secretary of the State of Johor had stated that Johor did not claim ownership of Pedra Branca . All visits made to the island had been with Singapore 's express permission , and maps published by Malaysia in the 1960s and 1970s indicated that it recognised Singapore 's sovereignty over Pedra Branca . 
 Like Pedra Branca , the Sultan of Johor held the original ancient title to Middle Rocks . As Singapore had not exercised any rights as a sovereign over Middle Rocks , the ICJ determined that Malaysia retained sovereignty over this maritime feature . As for South Ledge , the ICJ noted that it fell within the apparently overlapping territorial waters of mainland Malaysia , Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks . As the Court had not been mandated to draw the line of delimitation with respect to the territorial waters of Malaysia and Singapore in the area in question , it simply held that sovereignty over South Ledge belonged to the state which owned the territorial waters in which it is located . 
 = = = Reactions to ICJ decision = = = 
 Although both Malaysia and Singapore had agreed to respect and accept the ICJ 's decision , Malaysian Foreign Minister Rais Yatim later said his country had renewed its search for the letters written by Governor Butterworth to the Sultan and Temenggung of Johor seeking permission to build Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca . He noted that the rules of the ICJ allowed a case to be reviewed within ten years if new evidence was adduced . In response , Singapore 's Law Minister K. Shanmugam said that the city @-@ state would wait to see what new evidence the Malaysian government could come up with . 
 A week after the delivery of the ICJ 's judgment , the Foreign Ministry of Malaysia asked the Malaysian media to cease using the Malay word Pulau ( " Island " ) for Pedra Branca and to refer to it as " Batu Puteh " or " Pedra Branca " . On 21 July 2008 , in response to questions from Singapore Members of Parliament about Pedra Branca , the Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Balaji Sadasivan stated that the maritime territory around the island included a territorial sea of up to 12 nautical miles ( 22 km ; 14 mi ) and an Exclusive Economic Zone . This was condemned by Malaysia 's Foreign Minister Rais Yatim as " against the spirit of Asean and the legal structure " as the claim was " unacceptable and unreasonable and contradicts the principles of international law " . In response , a Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said that Singapore first stated its claim to a territorial sea and Exclusive Economic Zone on 15 September 1980 , and reiterated this claim on 23 May 2008 following the ICJ 's judgment . Both statements had made clear that if the limits of Singapore 's territorial sea or Exclusive Economic Zone overlapped with the claims of neighbouring countries , Singapore would negotiate with those countries to arrive at agreed delimitations in accordance with international law . In August 2008 , Rais said Malaysia took the view that Singapore was not entitled to claim an Exclusive Economic Zone around Pedra Branca as it considered that the maritime feature did not meet internationally recognised criteria for an island , that is , land inhabited by humans that had economic activity . 
 At the National Day Awards in August 2008 , Singapore announced that awards would be conferred on a number of people and organisations for their special contributions towards the Pedra Branca case . Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong ; Tommy Koh , Ambassador @-@ at @-@ Large ; and Justice Chao Hick Tin , then Attorney @-@ General of Singapore , who appeared as counsel and advocates for Singapore , would respectively be awarded the Darjah Utama Temasek ( Order of Temasek ) ( Second Class ) , the Darjah Utama Nila Utama ( Order of Nila Utama ) ( First Class ) , and the Darjah Utama Bakti <unk> ( Distinguished Service Order ) . The Pingat Jasa Gemilang ( <unk> Service Medal ) would be conferred on <unk> Tiwari s / o <unk> Tiwari , Special Consultant to the International Affairs Division of the Attorney @-@ General 's Chambers . Twenty @-@ two people from the Attorney @-@ General 's Chambers , Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore , Ministry of Defence , Ministry of Foreign Affairs , National Archives of Singapore , National Library Board , National University of Singapore and Supreme Court of Singapore would receive the Pingat <unk> Awam ( Public Administration Medal ) , the Pingat <unk> ( Commendation Medal ) and the Pingat <unk> ( Efficiency Medal ) . The President 's Certificate of Commendation would be issued to the Coastal Command ( <unk> ) , Republic of Singapore Navy ; the Police Coast Guard , Singapore Police Force ; the Centre for Heritage Services , Ministry of Defence ; the National Archives of Singapore ; and the Hydrographic Department , Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore . The awards were presented on 17 November 2008 . 
 = = = Resolution of outstanding issues = = = 
 Malaysia and Singapore have established what they have named the Joint Technical Committee to delimit the maritime boundary in the area around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks , and to determine the ownership of South Ledge . Following a meeting on 3 June 2008 , the Committee agreed that a technical sub @-@ committee would be established to oversee the conduct of joint survey works to prepare the way for talks on maritime issues in and around the area . If any incident occurred in and around the waters of Pedra Branca , Middle Rocks and South Ledge , either side would provide humanitarian assistance to the vessels involved . Finally , both Malaysian and Singaporean fishermen could continue traditional fishing activities in those waters . In September 2008 , the Joint Technical Committee reported that its Sub @-@ Committee on Joint Survey Works was finalising technical preparations for a hydrographic survey that would provide data for future delimitation discussions . A Sub @-@ Committee on Maritime and Airspace Management and Fisheries had also been formed , and after a meeting on 20 August 2008 it decided that traditional fishing activities by both countries should continue in waters beyond 0 @.@ 5 nautical miles ( 0 @.@ 9 km ; 0 @.@ 6 mi ) off Pedra Branca , Middle Rocks and South Ledge .

 The City of Manchester Stadium in Manchester , England , also known as the Etihad Stadium for sponsorship reasons , is the home ground of Manchester City Football Club and , with a domestic football capacity of 55 @,@ 097 , is the third @-@ largest stadium in the Premier League and eighth @-@ largest in the United Kingdom . 
 Built to host the 2002 Commonwealth Games , the stadium has since staged the 2008 UEFA Cup Final , England football internationals , rugby league matches , a boxing world title fight , the England rugby union team 's last match of the 2015 Rugby World Cup and music concerts . 
 The stadium , originally proposed as an athletics arena in Manchester 's bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics , was converted after the 2002 Commonwealth Games from a 38 @,@ 000 capacity arena to a 48 @,@ 000 seat football stadium at a cost to the city council of £ 22 million and to Manchester City of £ 20 million . It was agreed in 1997 that Manchester City F.C. would lease the stadium from Manchester City Council and move from their aging Maine Road ground - a move which took place in the summer of 2003 . 
 The stadium was built by Laing Construction at a cost of £ 112 million and was designed and engineered by <unk> , whose design incorporated a cable @-@ stayed roof structure , suspended by twelve exterior masts and attached cables . The stadium design has received much praise and many accolades , including an award from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 2004 for its innovative inclusive building design , and a special award in 2003 from the Institution of Structural Engineers for its unique structural design . 
 In August 2015 , a 7 @,@ 000 seat third tier on the South Stand was completed , in time for the start of the 2015 – 16 football season . The expansion was designed to be in keeping with the existing roof design . A North Stand third tier has planning approval and work on it is expected to begin by 2017 , increasing capacity to around 61 @,@ 000 .

 Plans to build a new stadium in Manchester were formulated before 1989 as part of the city 's bid to host the 1996 Summer Olympics . Manchester City Council submitted a bid that included a design for an 80 @,@ 000 @-@ capacity stadium on a greenfield site west of Manchester city centre . The bid failed and Atlanta hosted the Games . Four years later the city council bid to host the 2000 Summer Olympics , but this time focusing on a brownfield site 1 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 99 mi ) east of the city centre on derelict land that was the site of Bradford Colliery , known colloquially as Eastlands . The council 's shift in focus was driven by emerging government legislation on urban renewal , promising vital support funding for such projects ; the government became involved in funding the purchase and clearance of the Eastlands site in 1992 . 
 For the February 1993 bid the city council submitted another 80 @,@ 000 @-@ capacity stadium design produced by design consultants Arup Associates , the firm that helped select the Eastlands site . On 23 September 1993 , the games were awarded to Sydney , but the following year Manchester submitted the same scheme design to the Millennium Commission as a " Millennium Stadium " , only to have this proposal rejected . Undeterred , Manchester City Council subsequently bid to host the 2002 Commonwealth Games , once again proposing the same site along with downsized stadium plans derived from the 2000 Olympics bid , and this time were successful . In 1996 , this same planned stadium competed with Wembley Stadium to gain funding to become the new national stadium , but the money was used to redevelop Wembley . 
 After successful athletics events at the Commonwealth Games , conversion into a football venue was criticised by athletics figures such as Jonathan Edwards and Sebastian Coe as , at the time , the United Kingdom still lacked plans for a large athletics venue due to the capability of installing an athletics track having been dropped from the designs for a rebuilt Wembley Stadium . Had either of the two larger stadium proposals developed by Arup been agreed for funding , then Manchester would have ended up with a venue capable of being adapted to hosting large @-@ scale athletics events through the use of movable seating . 
 Sport England wished to avoid creating a white elephant , so they insisted that the City Council agree to undertake and fund extensive work to convert CoMS from a track and field arena to a football stadium , thereby ensuring its long @-@ term financial viability . Sport England hoped either Manchester City Council or Manchester City F.C. would provide the extra £ 50 million required to convert the stadium to a 65 @,@ 000 seater athletics and footballing venue with movable seating . However , Manchester City Council did not have the money to facilitate movable seating and Manchester City were lukewarm about the idea . Stadium architects Arup Sport believed history demonstrated that maintaining a rarely used athletics track often does not work with football – and cited examples such as the Stadio delle Alpi and the Munich Olympic Stadium , with both Juventus and Bayern Munich moving to new stadiums less than 40 years after inheriting them . 
 = = = 2002 Commonwealth Games = = = 
 The stadium 's foundation stone was laid by Prime Minister Tony Blair in December 1999 , and construction began in January 2000 . The stadium was designed by Arup Associates and constructed by Laing Construction at a cost of approximately £ 112 million , £ 77 million of which was provided by Sport England , with the remainder funded by Manchester City Council . For the Commonwealth Games , the stadium featured a single lower tier of seating running around three sides of the athletics track , and second tiers to the two sides , with an open @-@ air temporary stand at the northern end ; initially providing a seating capacity for the Games of 38 @,@ 000 , subsequently extended to 41 @,@ 000 through the installation of additional temporary trackside seating along the east and south stands . 
 The first public event at the stadium was the opening ceremony of the 2002 Commonwealth Games on 25 July 2002 . Among the dignitaries present was Queen Elizabeth II who made a speech , delivered to her in an electronic baton , and ' declared the Commonwealth Games open ' . During the following ten days of competition , the stadium hosted the track and field events and all the rugby sevens matches . Sixteen new Commonwealth Games track and field records ( six men 's and ten women 's ) were set in the stadium , eight of which ( three men 's and five women 's records ) are still extant after three subsequent series of Games in 2006 , 2010 and 2014 . Prior to the 2012 Summer Olympics held in London , the 2002 Games was the largest multi @-@ sport event ever to be staged in the UK , eclipsing the earlier London 1948 Summer Olympics in numbers of teams and competing athletes ( 3 @,@ 679 ) , and it was the world 's first multi @-@ sport tournament to include a limited number of full medal events for elite athletes with a disability ( EAD ) . In terms of number of participating nations , it is still the largest Commonwealth Games in history , featuring 72 nations competing in 281 events across seventeen ( fourteen individual and three team ) sports .

 Sections of the track were removed and relaid at other athletics venues , and the internal ground level was lowered to make way for an additional tier of seating , on terracing already constructed then buried for the original configuration . The two temporary stands with a total capacity of 16 @,@ 000 were dismantled , and replaced with a permanent structure of similar design to the existing one at the southern end . This work took nearly a year to complete and added 23 @,@ 000 permanent seats , increasing the capacity of the converted stadium by 7 @,@ 000 to approximately 48 @,@ 000 . Manchester City F.C. moved to the ground in time for the start of the 2003 – 04 season . The total cost of this conversion was in excess of £ 40 million , with the track , pitch and seating conversion being funded by the city council at a cost of £ 22 million ; and the installation of bars , restaurants and corporate entertainment areas throughout the stadium being funded by the football club at a cost of £ 20 million . The Games had made a small operating surplus , and Sport England agreed that this could be reinvested in converting the athletics warm @-@ up track adjacent to the main stadium into the 6 @,@ 000 seat Manchester Regional Arena at a cost of £ <unk> 
 = = = Stadium expansion = = = 
 The stadium is owned by Manchester City Council and leased by the football club . The 2008 takeover made the football club one of the wealthiest in the world , prompting suggestions that it could consider buying the stadium outright . Manchester City signed an agreement with Manchester City Council in March 2010 to allow a £ 1 billion redevelopment led by architect Rafael Viñoly . 
 During the 2010 closed season the football pitch and hospitality areas were renovated , with a £ 1 million investment being made in the playing surface so that it is better able to tolerate concerts and other events without damage . In October 2010 , Manchester City renegotiated the stadium lease , obtaining the naming rights to the stadium in return for agreeing to now pay the City Council an annual fixed sum of £ 3 million where previously it had only paid half of the ticket sales revenue from match attendances exceeding 35 @,@ 000 . This new agreement occurred as part of a standard 5 @-@ year review of the original lease and it amounts to an approximate £ 1 million annual increase in council revenues from the stadium . During 2011 @-@ 14 the club sold all 36 @,@ 000 of its allocated season tickets each season and experienced an average match attendance that is very close to its maximum seating capacity ( see table in previous section ) . Consequently , during the 2014 @-@ 15 season an expansion of the stadium was undertaken . The South Stand was extended with the addition of a third tier which , in conjunction with an additional three rows of pitch side seating , increased stadium capacity to approximately 55 @,@ 000 . Construction commenced on the South Stand in April 2014 and was completed for the start of the 2015 @-@ 16 season . 
 A final phase of expansion , that received planning approval at the same time as the others but which remains unscheduled , will add a matching third tier of seats to the North Stand . Once this last phase is completed it will bring the stadium 's total seating capacity up to approximately 61 @,@ 000 , making the Etihad Stadium the nation 's second largest capacity club ground . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 When planning the development , Manchester City Council required a sustainable landmark structure that would be an icon for the regeneration of the once heavily industrialised site surrounding Bradford Colliery , as well as providing spectators with good sightlines in an atmospheric arena . Arup Associates designed the stadium to be " an intimate , even intimidating , gladiatorial arena embodying the atmosphere of a football club " with the pitch six metres below ground level , a feature of Roman gladiatorial arenas and amphitheatres . The attention to detail , often absent in stadium design , has been remarked upon , including the cigar @-@ shaped roof supports with blue lighting beacons , sculpted rainwater gutters , poly @-@ carbonate perimeter roof edging and <unk> louvres to aid pitch grass growth with similarities also made to High @-@ tech architecture . 
 = = = Iconic roof design = = = 
 The toroidal @-@ shaped stadium roof is held together by a tensioned system , which has been described as " ground @-@ breaking " by New Steel Construction magazine . The stadium 's architectural focal point is the sweeping roof and support masts which are separate from the concrete bowl . A catenary cable is situated around the inner perimeter of the roof structure which is tied to the masts via <unk> cables . <unk> cables and corner ties from the masts are connected to the ground to support the structure . With the expansion of the South Stand in 2015 to accommodate a third tier of seating , the original south end roof was dismantled ; but with the southern masts and corner ties remaining , so as to continue to tie the catenary cable which now runs below the new roof . The new higher South Stand roof is a separate structure , with its own set of braced masts and cables ; and it is expected that a counterpart arrangement will be adopted for the proposed North Stand expansion . 
 Cables are attached to the twelve masts circling the stadium with rafters and purlins for additional rigid support . The cigar @-@ shaped masts double as visual features , with the highest at 70 metres ( 230 ft ) . Access to the upper tiers of seats is provided by eight circular ramps with conical roofs resembling turrets above which eight of the twelve masts rise up providing the support structure for the roof . 
 The roof of the south , east and west stands built for the athletics stadium configuration was supported by the cable net system . The temporary open stand at the north end was built around the masts and tie down cables that would ultimately support the roof of the North Stand . After the games the track and field were excavated . The temporary bleachers at the north end were removed and the North Stand and lower tier of seats constructed on the prepared excavation . The North Stand roof was completed by adding rafters , purlins and cladding . 
 = = = Facilities and pitch = = = 
 The stadium has facilities for players and match officials in a basement area below the west stand , which also contains a kitchen providing meals for up to 6 @,@ 000 people on match days , press rooms , ground staff storage , and a prison cell . The stadium also has conference facilities and is licensed for marriage ceremonies . Fitting out of the hospitality suites , kitchens , offices , and concourse concessions was accomplished by KSS Architects , and included the installation of the communications cabling and automatic access control system . 
 The stadium 's interior comprises a continuous oval bowl , with three tiers of seating at the sides , and two tiers at each end . Entry by patrons is gained by contactless smart card rather than traditional manned turnstiles . The system can admit up to 1 @,@ 200 people per minute through all entrances . A service tunnel under the stadium provides access for emergency vehicles and the visiting team 's coach to enter the stadium directly . Once inside the stadium patrons have access to six themed restaurants , two of which have views of the pitch , and there are 70 executive boxes above the second tier of seating in the north , west and east stands . 
 To create the optimum grass playing surface in the stadium bowl , the roof was designed to maximise sunlight by using a ten @-@ metre band of translucent polycarbonate at its periphery . Additionally , each of the corners of the stadium without seating have perforated walls with moveable louvres that can be adjusted to provide ventilation of the grass and general airflow through the stadium . Drainage and under @-@ pitch heating were installed to provide optimum growing conditions for the grass . The pitch has a UEFA standard dimension of 105 by 68 metres ( 115 by 74 yd ) . and is covered with natural grass reinforced by artificial fibres made by Desso . The field of play is lit by 218 2000 @-@ watt floodlights , consuming a total of 436 @,@ 000 watts . The grass playing surface is recognised as being one of the best in English football , and has been nominated five times in the last nine seasons for best Premier League pitch , an accolade it won in 2010 – 11 among other awards .

 The stadium was named the City of Manchester Stadium by Manchester City Council before construction began in December 1999 , but has a number of commonly used alternatives . City of Manchester Stadium is abbreviated to CoMS when written and spoken . Eastlands refers to the site and the stadium before they were named SportCity and CoMS respectively , and remains in common usage for both the stadium and the whole complex , as does SportCity but with less frequency . The stadium was also officially referred to as Manchester City Stadium for the 2015 Rugby World Cup . The football club , under its new ownership , renegotiated its 250 @-@ year lease with the city council in October 2010 , gaining the naming rights in return for a substantial increase in rent . The stadium was renamed the Etihad Stadium by the club in July 2011 as part of a ten @-@ year agreement with the team kit sponsors Etihad Airways . The agreement encompasses sponsorship of the stadium 's name , extends the team kit sponsorship for ten years , and includes plans to relocate the club 's youth academy and training facilities to the City Football Academy on a new campus development adjacent to the stadium . 
 Despite being a continuous oval bowl , each side of the stadium is named in the manner of a traditional football ground . All sides were initially named by compass direction ( North Stand and South Stand for the ends , East Stand and West Stand for the sides ) . In February 2004 , after a vote by fans , the West Stand was renamed the Colin Bell Stand in honour of the former player . The vote was almost cancelled ( and the stand instead named after Joe Mercer ) due to suspicions it had been hijacked by rival fans who wished to dub the renamed stand The Bell End . However , core supporters of the club made it clear they still wished the stand named after their hero . The East Stand is unofficially known by fans as the Kippax as a tribute to the very vocal east stand at the club 's Maine Road ground . 
 The North Stand is the only part of the stadium built after the Commonwealth Games , during the stadium 's conversion . The temporary unroofed north stand it replaced had been dubbed the New Gene Kelly Stand by supporters , a reference to the unroofed corner between the Kippax and the North Stand at the club 's former Maine Road home , because , being exposed to the elements , they frequently found themselves " singing in the rain . " Commencing season 2010 – 11 , seating in the North Stand has been restricted to only supporters accompanied by children , resulting in this end of the ground now being commonly referred to as the Family Stand . Although the North Stand has never been officially renamed and is still frequently referenced that way , most external ticketing offices and stadium guides , in addition to the club itself , now preferentially label and refer to this section of the ground as the Family Stand when discussing seating and ticket sales . Supporters initially dubbed the South Stand the Scoreboard End ( the former name of the North Stand at Maine Road ) , and it houses the majority of City 's more vocal fans . Supporters of visiting teams are also normally allocated seats in this stand . From 2003 to 2006 it was renamed the Key 103 Stand for sponsorship reasons , though this was largely ignored by regular patrons .

 The stadium is the centrepiece of SportCity , which includes several other nationally important sporting venues . Adjacent to the stadium is the Manchester Regional Arena , which served as a warm @-@ up track during the Commonwealth Games and is now a 6 @,@ 178 @-@ capacity venue that hosts national athletics trials , but has previously also hosted the home games of both the Manchester City women 's team and the club 's U21 reserve team . The Regional Arena has regularly hosted the AAA Championships and Paralympic World Cup , and is currently the home ground of amateur rugby league side Manchester Rangers . 
 The National Squash Centre and the National Cycling Centre , which includes both the Manchester Velodrome and the National Indoor BMX Arena , are all a short distance from the stadium . The Squash Centre - which has hosted the British National Squash Championships since 2003 - was added to the SportCity complex for the Commonwealth Games along with CoMS . The Velodrome , another showpiece venue used to stage all the track cycling events for the Games , was already in place and had been home to British Cycling , the governing body for cycling in Britain , since it was built in 1994 as part of Manchester ’ s unsuccessful 2000 Olympics bid . Prior to the completion of the Lee Valley <unk> for the 2012 Summer Olympics , the Velodrome had been the only indoor Olympic @-@ standard track in the United Kingdom . The collocated BMX Arena houses the United Kingdom ’ s only permanent indoor BMX track and provides seating for up two thousand spectators . It was added to the National Cycling Centre at SportCity in 2011 . 
 Other major sporting and sport @-@ related venues located in SportCity in the immediate vicinity of the Etihad Stadium - all legacies of the 2002 Commonwealth Games - are the English Institute of Sport , west of the stadium , adjacent to the southwest corner of the Regional Arena ; the Manchester Regional Tennis Centre , adjacent to the north end of the stadium ; and the Manchester Tennis & Football Centre , also adjacent to the stadium , which is operated and administered by the Manchester Sport and Leisure Trust .

 Between 11 March ( Commonwealth Day ) and 10 August 2002 , as part of the preparations for the upcoming Commonwealth Games and to celebrate Her Majesty the Queen 's Golden Jubilee , a national Spirit of Friendship Festival was organised . On 9 July , a few weeks before the Games began , a sculpture outside the new national headquarters of the English Institute of Sport at SportCity was unveiled by the middle @-@ distance runner , Steve Cram MBE . This sculpture , commissioned in late 2001 , was created in a little over eight weeks by Altrincham @-@ based artist , Colin Spofforth , who had submitted to Manchester City Council his idea for a heroic @-@ sized sculpture of a sprinter as a means of celebrating the beauty , power and determination of the competing athletes . Reaching thirty feet high , weighing seven tonnes , and titled The Runner , this unique larger @-@ than @-@ life bronze statue of a male sprinter surmounting a bronze globe was , at the time , the UK 's largest sporting sculpture . It depicts the very moment the runner leaves the blocks once the starter 's gun has fired . 
 From 2005 to 2009 a Thomas Heatherwick sculpture , B of the Bang , was situated to the southeast of the stadium at the junction of Ashton New Road and Alan Turing Way . Built after the Commonwealth Games to commemorate them , it was the tallest sculpture in the UK . However , numerous structural problems led to the 184 ft. sculpture being dismantled in 2009 for safety reasons . In 2014 , money recovered by the Manchester City Council as a result of lengthy legal battles consequent to this debacle was used to fund a new £ 341 @,@ 000 public sculpture a few hundred yards further south .

 The first public football match at the stadium was a friendly between Manchester City and Barcelona on 10 August 2003 . Manchester City won the game 2 – 1 , with Nicolas Anelka scoring the first ever goal in the stadium . 
 The first competitive match followed four days later , a UEFA Cup match between Manchester City and Welsh Premier League side The New Saints , which City won 5 – 0 with Trevor Sinclair scoring the first competitive goal in the stadium . Having started the Premier League season with an away match , Manchester City 's first home league fixture in the new stadium was on 23 August , a game drawn 1 – 1 with Portsmouth , with Pompey 's <unk> scoring the first league goal in the stadium . 
 2011 – 2012 saw the Etihad Stadium play host to the setting of a number of new club and Premier League footballing records , such as the club becoming the first ever team to win 11 of its opening 12 games in a Premier League season , and going on to remain unbeaten at the Etihad Stadium in all nineteen of the Premier League games played there . The club 's record of 55 home points out of a possible 57 at the stadium is a joint best Premier League record , and the club 's record of twenty consecutive home wins at the stadium ( going back to the end of the previous season ) also set a new Premier League record in March 2012 . 
 The record football attendance at the stadium not involving its host team Manchester City is 43 @,@ 878 which was set at the 2008 UEFA Cup Final game between Zenit Saint Petersburg and Rangers on 14 May 2008 . As is customary for such games , the then 47 @,@ 715 maximum physical capacity of the stadium had been reduced by UEFA to around 44 @,@ 000 for this final . However , neither limit would have been able to accommodate the vast number of supporters of the Scottish club , estimated to be in excess of 130 @,@ 000 , that travelled down from Glasgow to Manchester on the day of the game , despite the club 's official ticket allocation being just 13 @,@ 000 and police requests for fans without tickets to stay home . This order of magnitude mismatch between the numbers of traveling fans and those holding tickets ultimately led to a serious public disorder incident in the centre of the city now inextricably associated with this final , despite the fact that the 44 @,@ 000 or so crowd who watched the game inside the stadium were perfectly well @-@ behaved .

 The 2002 Commonwealth Games were deemed a success and the stadium gained critical acclaim for its atmosphere and architectural design . It has won a number of design awards , including the 2004 Royal Institute of British Architects Inclusive Design Award for inclusive building design , the 2003 Institution of Structural Engineers Structural Special Award , and in 2002 a BCI Major Project high commendation was awarded by the British Construction Industry . In July 2014 , the stadium was declared one of the United Kingdom 's five most iconic structures by the Construction Industry Training Board . 
 In 2003 , initial reception by Manchester City supporters was polarised , with some lukewarm about moving from Maine Road which had a reputation for being one of English football 's most atmospheric grounds , whilst others were enthusiastic about the bigger stadium and move back to East Manchester where the club was formed . Since 2010 , the club has boasted more than 36 @,@ 000 season ticket holders each season , which is more than the 35 @,@ 150 maximum capacity of Maine Road just before the club moved homes . 
 A 2007 Premier League survey found that fans thought sight lines at the stadium were the second best in the Premier League after the Emirates Stadium . Opposition fans have generally given positive feedback , with CoMS coming second to Old Trafford in a 2005 poll to find the United Kingdom 's favourite football ground . In 2010 , the City of Manchester Stadium was the third most visited stadium after Old Trafford and Anfield by overseas visitors . 
 In the early years of Manchester City 's tenure , the stadium suffered from a poor atmosphere , a common problem with modern stadia when compared with traditional football grounds such as Maine Road . In the 2007 Premier League survey , Manchester City supporters rated the atmosphere as second worst in the league , but the atmosphere has since significantly improved and continues to do so . 
 In October 2014 , the club received two national VisitFootball awards for the quality of its customer care of Premier League fans visiting the Etihad Stadium during the previous season . VisitFootball , a joint venture between the Premier League and the national tourism board 's <unk> , has been assessing the care that patrons receive at football grounds since August 2010 , and presents annual awards for those clubs who deliver outstanding customer service . Manchester City had been one of the first four clubs to receive an inaugural VisitFootball award in 2011 , but in 2014 it was the recipient of both the Club of the Year and <unk> Welcome awards . According to the panel of experts from the football and customer service industries that assess the services and facilities provided at each of the twenty Premier League club stadia , " Manchester City are the gold standard in providing fans with the best matchday experience .

 In July 2011 , CoMS was renamed the Etihad Stadium , sponsored by Etihad Airways who fought off competition from Ferrostaal and <unk> to gain the stadium naming rights . This lucrative 10 @-@ year sponsorship deal included not just the naming rights to the stadium itself but to the whole £ 200 million complex of football @-@ related facilities into which it was soon to be incorporated . In mid @-@ September 2011 , development plans were duly announced for a new state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art youth academy and training facility - now known as the City Football Academy ( CFA ) - to be built on derelict land adjacent to the stadium and which would include a 7 @,@ 000 capacity mini @-@ stadium plus fifteen additional outdoor football pitches , six swimming pools and three gyms . The planned CFA facility was not only to become the new home base of the Manchester City first team squad , reserve ( U21 youth ) team squad , and all of the Academy younger age group squads , but also the new home of the prior loosely affiliated Manchester City Ladies team ( which was re @-@ branded in 2012 as Manchester City Women 's F.C. and more formally merged into the Manchester City family of affiliated football teams ) . Also fully integrated into the new CFA facility would be the parent club 's world headquarters . 
 At the beginning of March 2014 , the structural framework for a new pedestrian walkway / footbridge over the junction of Alan Turing Way and Ashton New Road connecting the CFA with the Etihad Stadium was lowered into place . With sponsor Suisse Power & Gas SA having subsequently secured the naming rights , the completed <unk> Bridge was officially opened and turned over to Manchester City Council for general public access on 26 November 2014 . Twelve days later , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , George Osborne , presided over the official opening of the CFA .

 As part of Manchester City 's commitment to community outreach in their redevelopment plans for the areas of East Manchester adjacent to the Etihad Stadium , other urban regeneration plans incorporated into the overall Etihad Campus development project include the new £ 43 million Beswick Community Hub , that includes Connell Sixth Form College ; a community leisure centre ( with swimming pool , dance studio , health and fitness gym , rugby pitch , and grass sports pitches ) ; and a planned Manchester Institute of Health and Performance . On 26 November 2014 , the same day the <unk> Bridge was officially opened , a " globally admired " grouping of stainless steel sculptures - consisting of three towering metallic chess pieces called Dad 's Halo Effect by its internationally acclaimed creator , Ryan Gander - was likewise unveiled to the public . Commissioned by the Manchester City Council to represent both the past industrial and current sporting heritage of this area of east Manchester , the public artwork is located in front of the Connell Sixth Form College , close to the central circus of the Beswick Community Hub and only a few hundred yards south from where the area 's last public sculpture , B of the Bang , had been situated .

 = 1953 Pacific hurricane season = 
 The 1953 Pacific hurricane season was the least active season on record . The season officially began on May 15 in the northeast Pacific Ocean and on June 1 in the central northern Pacific . They ended on November 30 . These dates conventionally delimit the time of year when most tropical cyclones form in northeast Pacific Ocean . Before the satellite age started in the 1960s , data prior to that time on Pacific hurricanes is extremely unreliable as most east Pacific storms are of no threat to land . 
 Of the four known tropical systems , two became hurricanes . Although only a tropical storm , the first storm of the season was the deepest , with a pressure of 981 mbar ( 29 @.@ 0 inHg ) . This season is unusual in that no one was killed , no damage was inflicted , and no tropical cyclones made landfall .

 Only four known systems were observed during the 1953 season . This was below the average at that time , which was six . Furthermore , the season was well below the 1949 @-@ 2006 average of 13 named storms and had the fewest number of storms in the hurricane database . Only two tropical cyclones reached hurricane status , compared to the modern @-@ day average of seven . Furthermore , 1953 is also one of the few seasons without a major hurricane . This season was part of a decade @-@ long absence of major hurricanes ; from 1950 – 56 , no major hurricanes ( Category 3 or higher on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale ) were reported in the Eastern Pacific basin . However , it is possible that some storms were missed due to the lack of satellite coverage in the region in addition to the lack of Hurricane Hunter data , which did not become available until the following year . 
 The four known storms developed between the 14 ° N and the 20 ° N. All of the storms remained at sea throughout their lifetime ; no deaths nor damages were noted during the season , though moisture from two of them reached the Southwestern United States . The season got onto an extremely slow start . The first storm formed in late August . At that time , it was believed that two systems would have long formed by then on average . According to the modern @-@ day National Hurricane Center , 8 @-@ 10 storms would have by that time on average . Additionally , 1953 had the latest start date of any Pacific hurricane season on record . Additionally , 1953 is the only season in the database to have no storms by August . Throughout the 1953 hurricane season , the Weather Bureau office in Los Angeles ( <unk> ) issued 42 advisories during the season , mostly due to the storms ' threat to Southern California .

 Thunderstorm activity off the Mexican coast was quite for the first half of August . Based on data from six ships , a closed atmospheric circulation may have formed near the Revillagigedo Islands at 0000 UTC on August 23 , which are situated roughly 350 mi ( 565 km ) south of the Baja California Peninsula . At this time , winds were estimated to be no higher than 28 mph ( 45 km / h ) . After formation , One moved west @-@ northwest and on August 25 , the storm attained its peak intensity of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . Furthermore , the ship S.S. Sirocco measured a minimum barometric pressure of 981 mbar ( 29 @.@ 0 inHg ) . Although the <unk> reported that the storm dissipated that night near the peninsula , the HURDAT database suggests that the storm maintained peak intensity for another day , until August 27 when it dissipated .

By that night , it was estimated to have developed winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . A tropical storm formed on September 9 ; meanwhile , ship reports indicated a pressure of 1 @,@ 001 mbar ( 29 @.@ 6 inHg ) and sustained winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) .

 On October 1 , a closed low formed in the Gulf of Tehuantepec from an area of disturbed weather , which had persisted for several days prior .

 = No. 4 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF = 
 No. 4 Elementary Flying Training School ( No. 4 EFTS ) was a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) pilot training unit that operated during World War II . It was one of twelve elementary flying training schools employed by the RAAF to provide introductory flight instruction to new pilots as part of Australia 's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme . No. 4 EFTS was established in January 1940 at Mascot , New South Wales , and initially operated in conjunction with civilian flying organisations based at Mascot and Newcastle . The school was disbanded in April 1942 , and its operations transferred to No. 6 Elementary Flying School at Tamworth . 
 = = History = = 
 Flying instruction in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) underwent major changes following the outbreak of World War II , in response to a vast increase in the number of aircrew volunteers and the commencement of Australia 's participation in the Empire Air Training Scheme ( EATS ) . The Air Force 's pre @-@ war pilot training facility , No. 1 Flying Training School at RAAF Station Point Cook , Victoria , was supplanted in 1940 – 41 by twelve elementary flying training schools ( EFTS ) and eight service flying training schools ( SFTS ) . The EFTS provided a twelve @-@ week introductory flying course to personnel who had graduated from one of the RAAF 's initial training schools . Flying training was undertaken in two stages : the first involved four weeks of instruction ( including ten hours of flying ) to determine trainees ' suitability to become pilots . Those that passed this grading process then received a further eight weeks of training ( including sixty @-@ five hours of flying ) at the EFTS . Pilots who successfully completed this course were posted to an SFTS in either Australia or Canada for the next stage of their instruction as military aviators . 
 No. 4 Elementary Flying Training School ( No. 4 EFTS ) was formed at Kingsford Smith Aerodrome , Mascot , New South Wales , on 2 January 1940 , and came under the control of No. 2 Group . Its inaugural commanding officer was Squadron Leader <unk> Ellis . Mascot had been Sydney 's civil airport since 1920 , and was home to several private aviation organisations . It was the airfield 's position as the hub of civilian flight instruction in New South Wales that led to it becoming the base for the fourth flying school the RAAF raised during World War II . The same principle was followed in basing No. 1 EFTS at Parafield , South Australia , No. 2 EFTS at Archerfield , Queensland , and No. 3 EFTS at Essendon , Victoria . 
 The first training courses at No. 4 EFTS were not conducted under the auspices of EATS but by civil organisations under government contract . The instructors from these organisations were commissioned as officers in the RAAF . The flying school was divided into four flights : " A " ( training conducted by the Royal Aero Club of New South Wales ) , " B " ( conducted by Kingsford Smith Air Services Pty Ltd ) , " C " ( conducted by <unk> Pty Ltd ) , and " D " ( conducted at Newcastle by the Newcastle Aero Club ) . The training aircraft were de Havilland Tiger Moths and Gipsy Moths . All air cadets were subject to RAAF discipline , and the school 's training program was directed by the commanding officer . The initial intake of twenty @-@ four students arrived on 8 January 1940 . Accommodation was severely limited at the new flying school : No. 4 EFTS headquarters was housed in the clubhouse of the Royal Aero Club , the base sick quarters utilised the Department of Civil Aviation 's casualty room , and cadets had to pay for their own rooms at the nearby Brighton @-@ Le @-@ Sands Hotel . 
 No. 4 EFTS 's strength as at 1 February 1940 was four officers , twenty @-@ one airmen , one civilian , and twenty @-@ four cadets . The second intake of twenty @-@ four cadets arrived four days later . The school 's inaugural EATS course commenced on 29 April . The government 's contracts with the civilian organisations for flying instruction at Mascot and Newcastle were terminated during August 1940 , and their aircraft — fifteen Tiger Moths and eight Gipsy Moths — were impressed by the RAAF . <unk> was engaged to provide maintenance . On 18 November , an instructor was killed when he fell into a Randwick street from a Tiger Moth performing a slow roll after his safety harness broke ; neither he nor his student , who though badly shaken was able to land the plane , were wearing parachutes . One Tiger Moth landed on top of another on 27 December ; both planes were badly damaged but no @-@ one was killed . 
 No. 4 EFTS 's strength as at 1 February 1941 was twenty officers , 101 airmen , and sixty @-@ two aircrew trainees . Two Tiger Moths collided over the Lakes Golf Club on 6 April , killing the instructor and his pupil in one of the aircraft ; the pilots of the other plane survived after crash @-@ landing on the golf course . Owing to urgent requirements to house elements of the United States Army Forces in Australia ( USAFIA ) , No. 4 EFTS was disbanded on 24 April 1942 , and its operations transferred to No. 6 Elementary Flying School at Tamworth , New South Wales . No. 4 EFTS 's graduates included Clive Caldwell , who became Australia 's top @-@ scoring fighter ace of World War II .

 The Carrière des Nerviens Regional Nature Reserve ( in French Réserve naturelle régionale de la carrière des Nerviens ) is a protected area in the Nord @-@ Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais region of northern France . It was established on 25 May 2009 to protect a site containing rare plants and covers just over 3 hectares ( 7 @.@ 4 acres ) . It is located in the municipalities of Bavay and Saint @-@ Waast in the Nord department . 
 The reserve was created to protect fifteen plants of regional interest and three plant communities listed in the Habitats Directive . Its flora are linked to calcium present in marl . It is located in a transition zone between the oceanic and semi @-@ continental climates and that gives increased biodiversity , with typical species of the atlantic areas and others more continental . The reserve also plays a role in a wildlife corridor . 
 The site consists of an old quarry of sandstone dated to the Famennian stage in the Late Devonian epoch . It was backfilled in the 1970s with marl . The new soil was re @-@ colonized by pioneer species , which coexist alongside an established afforestation , forming a mosaic of habitats . 
 CPIE Bocage de l 'Avesnois , a non @-@ governmental organization , is the owner and operator of the reserve . The main objective is to maintain the current diversity . To this end , regular management mainly struggles against the afforestation and against invasive species , such as Japanese knot weed . The secondary objectives are environmental education , heritage interpretation , improvement of knowledge fauna and flora , and environmental monitoring .

 = = = Hydrology = = = 
 The reserve is located in the valley of the Ruisseau de Bavay , a tributary of the Hogneau , and is part of the greater drainage basin of the Scheldt . The reserve is not in direct contact with the river . It is supplied with water only by precipitation , which is retained by the natural properties of marl . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 The reserve 's nearest weather station is at Cambrai , about 42 kilometres away , inland , to the southeast . However , the nature reserve is affected by the nearby presence of the Ardennes Mountains , which gives a continental influence to the climate . 
 The regular precipitation and the absence of drought , as well as the predominance of south @-@ southwest winds and rain vectors , show the influence of oceanic climate . However , some significant rainfall variability between seasons , the moderate temperature range , and the high proportion ( 69 @.@ 8 percent ) of low winds ( less than 4 metres per second ( 13 ft / s ) ) compared to strong winds ( 3 @.@ 2 percent over 8 metres per second ( 26 ft / s ) ) winds are typical of a continental influence . This combination is atypical of an altered oceanic climate , a transition zone between the oceanic and semi @-@ continental climates , characterized by mild winters and cool summers . 
 In the reserve , this climatic transition leads to increased biodiversity . For example , common bluebell ( Hyacinthoides non @-@ scripta ) is a typical species of the Atlantic areas , while the common butterbur ( Petasites hybridus ) is more continental . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Quarry = = = 
 The site is a former quarry , used for its sandstone deposits as early as the late nineteenth century. by the Chevallier & Cie company , which employed about 70 workers , including 25 miners . In 1909 , the annual production was 12 @,@ 000 cubic metres ( 420 @,@ 000 cu ft ) of macadam , 500 cubic metres ( 18 @,@ 000 cu ft ) of ballast and 25 @,@ 000 cubic metres ( 880 @,@ 000 cu ft ) of cobblestones . 
 Boreholes were drilled manually . Stone blocks were divided using a mass and a steel heavy hammer ( up to 14 kilograms ( 31 lb ) ) called <unk> . Stones obtained were then classified by eye into stone for cobble and rubble for macadam . The first were <unk> : <unk> were removed by <unk> to form regular cobblestones . They were then sorted by size . The rubble was crushed in a jaw crusher . Debris were mechanically separated according to their size . Each particle has a particular use . Macadam , made of stones between 2 and 8 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 79 and 3 @.@ 15 in ) , was used for the construction and maintenance of roads . Ballast is a gravel 10 to 20 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 39 to 0 @.@ 79 in ) used for concrete . Shot from 2 to 10 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 079 to 0 @.@ 394 in ) was used for the surface of concrete or paths in parks and gardens . The fine dust , from 0 to 2 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 000 to 0 @.@ 079 in ) , was used for concrete paver blocks , concrete pipes , etc . 
 Quarrying ceased in the early 1960s ( 1962 – 1965 ) , when the stones extracted were no longer of sufficient quality . Between 1971 and 1978 , the quarry was gradually filled with marl from the Bellignies quarry . Since then , the site has been completely recolonized by vegetation through ecological succession , forming tree , shrub and herb layers . 
 = = = Reserve = = = 
 In 2001 , the site was brought to the attention of the CPIE Bocage de l 'Avesnois , pointing out the biodiversity of the new plant life . The association performed the first inventories . In the meantime , she contacted the five owners to consider a land management proposal . The commune of Bavay , the Bellignies quarry ( <unk> ) and a third owner sold her the property in 2003 . The CPIE Bocage de l 'Avesnois became the owner / operator of 85 percent of the site . The association implemented the first environmental resources management actions at the site and developed its first environmental management scheme In 2009 , the association obtained the agreement establishing the regional nature reserve at the site for a period of 20 years . 
 The name of the reserve recalls the former industrial activity ( Carrière : quarry ) and the Gallo @-@ Roman history of Bavay , the capital city of the ancient <unk> tribe . 
 In 2015 , an other owner give the management of his parcel . 
 = = Geology = = 
 The Paleozoic folded outcrops of the Bavay @-@ Saint @-@ Waast area are the bedrock of the eastern flank of the <unk> ' anticline , where the transgressive Cretaceous ( Turonian and Cenomanian chalk ) thins , and may eventually disappear by erosion . Strata of Hercynian basement , raised in the East by an important structural horst @-@ type accident , then appear locally . In these Paleozoic strata , the Devonian presents as a sandstone base of the Lower Famennian , where the levels were quarried 
 = = = Formations = = = 
 = = = = <unk> level = = = = 
 The stone that was quarried is arkose of the Famennian stage . Approximately 360 million years ago , the thrust of forming Gondwana plates raised the seabed . Meanwhile , an ice age occurred in regions near the poles . Marine regression allowed sedimentation of detrital sand and clays which left large shoals of hard sandstone with ripple marks , alternating with levels more or less shaley according to their clay 's content . 
 At the base of the deposit , these sandstones are reddish brown , very micaceous and shaley , sometimes containing calcareous nodules , ferruginous concretions and vegetable wax ; above , they are gray and <unk> . This is the Aye formation , including <unk> like Cyrtospirifer <unk> , Rhynchonellida as <unk> <unk> and R. <unk> , some <unk> , <unk> striatula or <unk> reticularis Well @-@ preserved feldspar and mica probably come from wind erosion under a semi @-@ arid climate of mountains present in the Netherlands today and extending to Düsseldorf . 
 = = = = Lower level = = = = 
 Under the Famennian , the <unk> consists , from top to bottom , of nodular gray shale , and mica rich in fossils such as Cyrtospirifer <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> reticularis , <unk> striatula , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . Below this are gray limestone @-@ built beds , rich in corals such as <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , alternating with black shale and nodular limestone containing Cyrtospirifer <unk> and <unk> <unk> . These beds issue from siltation of the <unk> present in the <unk> epoch , 370 million years ago . 
 = = = = Upper levels = = = = 
 Those Famennian strata represent the top of the Paleozoic series pleated with north dipping . Above , the transgressive Upper Cretaceous overlies horizontally with unconformity . It includes from the bottom to the top a paleozoic boulder conglomerate mixed with a sandy and glauconitic marl matrix , coarse clayey and glauconitic sands , containing Chlamys asper , Ostrea <unk> , <unk> plenus and finally marl with <unk> gracilis . These strata belong to the Cenomanian @-@ Turonian and were deposited between 90 and 100 million years ago , during a transgressive phase . 
 Fifty million years ago , during the Ypresian age , locally called <unk> , forms of marl of the <unk> are found . It comes from the alteration of Cretaceous rocks and takes the form of a brown or greenish plastic clay without fossils . The flints normally present at the base of the deposit have not been reported by Ladrière 1881 . 
 This stratum is covered with silt composed of clay , sand and flints and Roman pottery pieces , of the late Neogene age . Its origin can be attributed to the alteration of the underlying rocks and wind erosion . 
 = = = Nature of the embankments = = = 
 The stones used to backfill the quarry are those which underlie the Givetian limestone extracted in the Bellignies quarry . There is <unk> de <unk> , a coarse shelly limestone , deep gray , yellowish when it outcrops , detrital ferruginous dated to the Lower Cenomanian epoch , a hundred million years ago . There is clay and very glauconitic marl of the Upper Cenomanian stage , enriched by a pebble conglomerate <unk> stones . These rocks contain <unk> plenus , Chlamys asper , Ostrea <unk> and radiated fossils : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Arca <unk> . There is also bluish marl of the Turonian . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Plant communities = = = 
 The site is characterized by a mosaic of 17 plant communities regrouped into three main types of ecological units : grassy open areas , shrubby areas and wooded areas . Of these , three are listed in the Habitats Directive . The calcareous rocky slopes with <unk> vegetation <unk> fragilis @-@ <unk> <unk> are considered as exceptional , with a degree of uncertainty in the Nord @-@ Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais region . <unk> tall herb fringe community with Petasites hybridus , at the limit of its range , is also exceptional . The herbaceous fringe with red campion ( Silene dioica ) et wood forget @-@ me @-@ not ( Myosotis sylvatica ) ( <unk> <unk> - <unk> <unk> ) is very rare in the Nord @-@ Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais . The wood @-@ fringe <unk> sylvestris – <unk> <unk> is also regionally interesting . 
 = = = Flora = = = 
 = = = = Vascular plants = = = = 
 The reserve has 171 plant species , and 15 of them have heritage interest . 
 Twelve of them were inventoried in 2003 , and their populations have been managed since . The light undergrowth contains common spotted orchid ( Dactylorhiza <unk> ) and round @-@ leaved wintergreen ( <unk> rotundifolia ) . Liquorice milkvetch ( Astragalus <unk> ) and narrow @-@ leaved everlasting @-@ pea ( Lathyrus sylvestris ) are present in the small herb glade . The population of lesser butterfly @-@ orchid ( Platanthera <unk> ) is located in the pioneer wood . In the glade with <unk> and at the boundary of a pioneer grove grow pyramidal orchid ( Anacamptis pyramidalis ) . bee orchid ( <unk> <unk> ) and man orchid ( Orchis <unk> ) grow everywhere , except in the older glade . In the different herbaceous fringes grow wood forget @-@ me @-@ not ( Myosotis sylvatica ) and zigzag clover ( Trifolium medium ) . A tall herb fringe hosts common butterbur ( Petasites hybridus ) . 
 Seven plants are protected by a regional scale : common spotted orchid , man orchid , bee orchid , zigzag clover , liquorice milkvetch , narrow @-@ leaved everlasting @-@ pea and wood forget @-@ me @-@ not . 
 = = = = Mosses = = = = 
 In 2012 , 43 species of bryophytes were inventoried , including Stellar calcareous moss ( <unk> <unk> ) , taxon considered as endangered on the Nord @-@ Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais red regional list of bryophytes . 
 = = = Mushrooms = = = 
 Among the 115 species recorded in 2004 on the site , 15 are included in the red list of the Nord @-@ Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais region . In the shrubs near the path where green waste was deposited by people from outside the organization grow yellow club fungus ( Clavulinopsis <unk> ) , gray shag ( Coprinopsis cinerea ) , black earth tongues ( <unk> hirsutum ) , <unk> <unk> and Marasmius limosus . Those two last species are also in the <unk> 's glade of a pioneer wood of willow and birch , with moor club ( Clavaria <unk> ) , Geoglossum <unk> , lilac leg fibrecap ( Inocybe <unk> ) , ( Stropharia <unk> ) , girdled knight ( Tricholoma <unk> ) and burnt knight ( Tricholoma <unk> ) . Near orchid stations in the pioneer wood exist golden spindles ( Clavulinopsis fusiformis ) , Hebeloma <unk> , Hebeloma <unk> , Hebeloma <unk> , and also lilac leg fibrecap and burnt knight . Dog stinkhorn ( Mutinus caninus ) and <unk> <unk> for their part , were observed in the shaded path north of the site on the edge of mature wood . 
 = = = Fauna = = = 
 = = = = Mammals = = = = 
 Common mammals found here include the red fox , red squirrel , hare and rabbit , mole , wood mouse , bank vole and field vole . Two species of bats frequent the site regularly to hunt : the Daubenton 's bat ( Myotis <unk> ) and common pipistrelle ( Pipistrellus <unk> ) . They cannot , however , establish their habitat due to the lack of roosting sites in the reserve 's young trees . 
 = = = = Birds = = = = 
 Forty @-@ two species of birds have been observed on the site , 25 of which are breeding there . Twenty @-@ two species are protected nationally ; five are listed on the annex OO of the Bonn Convention , which aims to conserve migratory species throughout their range . However , no species can be considered as heritage . The northern goshawk and Eurasian sparrowhawk benefit from the abundance of sparrows feeding . The common grasshopper warbler stops there during its migration and the common nightingale nests there occasionally . 
 = = = = Reptiles ans amphibians = = = = 
 The common toad ( Bufo bufo ) and the common frog ( Rana temporaria ) are the only amphibians on the site . They use it in winter or during their migration . The viviparous lizard ( <unk> vivipara ) likes the slate deposits and ballast of the track . It hunts in the herbaceous areas , very flowery in summer and high in insects . The common wall lizard ( <unk> muralis ) has been seen in 2013 . The slow worm reproduction ( Anguis sp . ) is attested by the observation of young under rocks and other debris . 
 = = = = Invertebrates = = = = 
 Reproduction of Odonata is not possible on the site because of the lack of standing water . However , thanks to the richness of insects in the herbaceous areas , several species can be encountered including the western <unk> ( Gomphus pulchellus ) , a species present in the Regional Red List of dragonflies North Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais . 
 Twenty @-@ three species of butterflies and 105 species of moth enjoy the floral diversity of the site . The holly blue ( <unk> <unk> ) is a heritage species . 
 Of the nine species of Orthoptera identified , two are considered heritage : the sickle @-@ bearing bush cricket ( <unk> falcata ) , rare in the region , enjoys the dry and high herbaceous areas and the long @-@ horned groundhopper ( <unk> <unk> ) is a pioneer species of poor vegetation settings . 
 = = = The wildlife corridor = = = 
 To the north are present two sites containing a rich biodiversity : the Natura 2000 Belgian area " Hauts @-@ Pays des <unk> " and a ZNIEFF " Vallée de l ’ Hogneau et ses <unk> et les <unk> d ’ <unk> et de Bavay " . The Bellignies quarry with embankments similar to those which filled " Carrière des Nerviens " is therefore under similar ecological conditions . In the south , the Forêt de Mormal is a major area for biodiversity covered by ZNIEFF and Natura 2000 sites . The railway , unused recently and the stream Ruisseau de Bavay then the river Hogneau provide connection . 
 = = = Threats and responses = = = 
 In the past , the site was threatened by garbage dumps or by passage of 4x4 vehicles or quads . The installation of gates by the municipality of Bavay solved the problem . Pedestrians rarely venture off the path . The <unk> is limited . The greatest threats to the species are primary succession and invasive plants . 
 = = = = Primary succession = = = = 
 The marls was colonized by pioneer species , then shrubs and trees , corresponding to a primary succession . Without human intervention , a climax community would be reached . This dynamic may eventually lead to the disappearance of related open environments , particularly heritage species . However woodlands can also play an important role in creating habitat for many species . The management plan is therefore to maintain patch dynamics . 
 = = = = Invasive species = = = = 
 Four invasive species are a problem in the reserve . 
 Wood small @-@ reed ( Calamagrostis <unk> ) is present in the center of the site and threatens to spread into herbaceous areas . It compromises sustainability of stations , including man orchid and bee orchid populations . Two distinct zones can be distinguished . The first , where the wood small @-@ reed has a very high rate of recovery , is not hosting any heritage value . It is mowed early and disposed of . Grazing is not possible at the moment . The second , on the contrary , not densely colonized by this plant is much more of a fragile situation due to the presence of orchids and the sickle @-@ bearing bush cricket or long @-@ horned groundhopper . <unk> management is applied depending on the issues . At orchid stations , slight thinning is done early by hand pruning . The less dense areas where the grass is sparse ( conducive to the long @-@ horned groundhopper ( <unk> <unk> ) ) are pulled . In the newly opened areas , a systematic and annual pulling avoids expansion . Finally , dense areas , well exposed , are left in that state . 
 Many extensive areas of Japanese knotweed ( <unk> japonica ) are on the site . Heritage stations of common butterbur and hart 's @-@ tongue fern , colonized by invasive species , are managed by manual removal and disposal for incineration . 
 The bramble ( Rubus sp . ) lie around the ruins and along the south @-@ east of the site near the houses . Due to an interest in preserving wildlife ( e.g. refuge for mammals , insects , nesting wrens ) , they are not eradicated but contained . 
 Canada golden @-@ rod ( <unk> canadensis ) appeared in 2003 as a result of plant deposits . The threat proved to be serious the following year . Some stations show a significant concentration of the species , while isolated plants grow everywhere on the site . This plant is easily pulled by hand before flowering to prevent seed dispersal , and the shoots are burned . 
 Finally , <unk> aster ( <unk> <unk> ) is also present among the invasive plants . In their native countries , American asters are found in wet places . In France , these plants colonize relatively dry ruderal areas ( <unk> , road shoulder ... ) or wetlands . In this second case , asters show strong invasive behavior . In the reserve , where the majority of areas are dry , this plant does not present special hazards and removal is managed easily .

 Parcels of land owned by the CPIE Bocage de l 'Avesnois were classified as a regional nature reserve on 25 May 2009 by decision of the Conseil Régional Nord @-@ Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais . The entire site is included in a ZNIEFF type 1 Château de Rametz ( carrière des Nerviens ) and another of type 2 Complexe <unk> de la <unk> de Mormal et des zones <unk> <unk> . 
 = = = Management objectives = = = 
 The second version of the environmental management scheme covers the period 2007 – 2012 . It presents the knowledge , management , monitoring and <unk> objectives . 
 The preservation of the existing diversity was the most important goal . It required conservation of the heritage plant communities : tall @-@ herb fen with common butterbur , the <unk> vegetation with hart 's @-@ tongue fern and the woody fringe <unk> sylvestris – <unk> <unk> . The survival of populations of round @-@ leaved wintergreen and of man orchid , the two most interesting plants , was also a priority , as a strikeout against brush invasion in the open areas where bee orchid and pyramidal orchid grow . The natural forest dynamics are to be contained within areas of clear undergrowth or fringes with these species : common spotted orchid , zigzag clover and lesser butterfly @-@ orchid . Pioneer areas with mushrooms should be preserved and the invasive species contained . Artificial infrastructures ( ruin , concrete pylons , walls and rock piles ) should be utilized for the creation of new habitats . 
 The education , interpretation and promotion of local heritage missions should also be continued , while the fauna knowledge was to be developed and floristic monitoring provided . 
 = = = Assessment of the activities = = = 
 Evaluation is in progress . However , a partial analysis is already underway . 
 = = = = Activities carried out = = = = 
 The Bavay 's municipality has erected two barriers to prohibit access to motorized vehicles . Volunteers and employees of the CPIE Bocage de l 'Avesnois manage the site regularly . 
 = = = = Management of the diversity = = = = 
 Manual removal of the Japanese knotweed has preserved heritage stations of common butterbur and hart 's @-@ tongue fern . Early hand pruning was conducive to orchids . The late mowing seems rather ineffective . The grubbing @-@ up of the Canada golden @-@ rod and American asters was successful . The bush clearing and selective logging have helped maintain the wood @-@ fringe with narrow @-@ leaved everlasting @-@ pea and liquorice milkvetch . Common spotted orchid , zigzag clover and lesser butterfly @-@ orchid , species non @-@ adapted to open areas , benefited areas without clearing . The low dry @-@ stone walls probably favored the installation of viviparous lizard or common wall lizard , observed in 2013 , but also the consolidation of the hart 's @-@ tongue fern population . 
 From 2007 to 2012 , the number of round @-@ leaved wintergreen footage increased by 50 percent . On the other hand , those of man orchid fall suddenly and continually . Whereas 27 plants were counted in 2003 , the number reached a peak of 240 in 2006 with the uprooting of the wood small @-@ reed , before collapsing to 13 plants in 2012 , despite the continued management . The observation of gnawed seedlings can assume leaf consumption by herbivores . Protection against rodents was established in 2013 and will be evaluated at flowering . 
 On this site , 171 plant species are surveyed . Given its size and poor soil , this diversity is notable . Management undertaken in recent years has been essential to maintaining open areas , the most threatened by primary succession . Thus , the various vegetation layers ( pioneer and mature woodland , bushy areas , open areas ) provide a mosaic of habitats , and thus remarkable species . 
 = = = = Improved knowledge of flora and fauna = = = = 
 Besides heritage plants monitoring , an additional inventory of Orthoptera is being undertaken ; three new species were identified in 2013 : common pheasant , Eurasian siskin and common wall lizard . Fourteen new plants were also identified . Inventories of bats and mushrooms are being carried out by partners .

In an interview for Billboard , Sia said , " She [ Aguilera ] was just excited to get to work with the artists she loves . There 's this misconception that she 's a middle @-@ America kind of person . But she 's a little hipster . You go back to her house and sit by the fire with some wine , and what 's playing over the sound system ? The Knife and Arthur Russell . She doesn 't listen to pop music " .

 = The Fabulous Moolah = 
 Mary Lillian Ellison ( July 22 , 1923 – November 2 , 2007 ) was an American professional wrestler , better known by her ring name The Fabulous Moolah . She began her career working with promoter Billy Wolfe and his wife , wrestler and trainer Mildred Burke , as well as working alongside professional wrestler " Nature Boy " Buddy Rogers . She won the NWA World Women 's Championship in 1956 and was the most prominent holder of the title for approximately the next 30 years . 
 In the 1980s , she joined the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF , later WWE ) as part of the Rock ' n ' Wrestling Connection storyline , feuding with Cyndi Lauper and Wendi Richter , the latter of whom defeated her for the WWF Women 's Championship in 1984 . Ellison was marketed by the WWF as holding the record for the longest title reign by any athlete in any professional sport . According to WWE , she was also the first WWF Women 's Champion and held the title a total of four times . 
 In addition , Ellison was a prominent trainer and promoter in women 's professional wrestling . In the 1990s , she returned to the WWF in a comedic role with longtime friend Mae Young . Ellison became the first woman to be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 1995 and became the oldest champion in the history of professional wrestling when she won the WWF Women 's Championship at age 76 , in 1999 . In 2010 , WWE recognized her as the 27th best wrestler ever . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Mary Lillian Ellison was born in 1923 in Kershaw County , South Carolina , and grew up in <unk> , 12 miles from Columbia . The youngest of five children , Ellison was the only daughter of a part Cherokee father and an Irish mother . Her parents owned a farm , a grocery store , and a service station . 
 When her mother died of cancer , eight @-@ year @-@ old Ellison went to live with her paternal grandmother and worked on her cousin 's cotton farm to make money . At age 10 , Ellison was still deeply distraught over her mother ’ s death ; to cheer her up , her father took her to the local wrestling matches . Ellison liked the matches , but it was not until she saw Women 's Champion Mildred Burke wrestle that " they began to mean much more to me . " 
 Ellison returned to the Columbia home of her father and brothers . She graduated Columbia High School , but at age 14 married 21 @-@ year @-@ old Walter Carroll . They soon became parents to a daughter . A few months after the birth of her daughter , she divorced Carroll . Still only 15 , she left her daughter with a friend and set out on a wrestling career of her own .

 Ellison began her wrestling career with Mildred Burke ’ s husband Billy Wolfe , the dominant women 's promoter of the time . Her first match was on May 26 , 1949 against June Byers at the Boston Arena . Wolfe was notorious for advising his wrestlers to enter into sexual relationships with either himself or competing promoters to ensure additional bookings , a practice with which Ellison refused to go along . She , however , soon began a romance with wrestler Johnny Long . Long later introduced Ellison to Jack <unk> who gave her the moniker " Slave Girl Moolah " . By the early 1950s , Moolah was a valet for " Nature Boy " Buddy Rogers , accompanying him to the ring while providing eye candy for the male audiences and assisting Rogers against his opponents . Ellison broke up the partnership because Rogers kept pushing her to begin a sexual relationship . She then served as the valet for the Elephant Boy ( Tony Olivas ) . Olivas was Mexican , but had very dark skin , which caused controversy when Ellison , a white woman , would kiss him on the cheek during their ring entrance routine . At one show in Oklahoma City , a man , who thought that Olivas was a black man , attempted to stab Ellison with a knife for kissing him . Moolah later left Pfeffer 's promotion and began wrestling under Boston promoters Tony Santos and Paul Bowser . In 1955 , she began working for Vince McMahon , Sr. ' s Capitol Wrestling Corporation . 
 = = = World Champion ( 1956 – 1970s ) = = = 
 On September 18 , 1956 , Moolah defeated Judy Grable in a 13 @-@ woman battle royal to win the vacant World Women 's Championship , which shares a lineage with the NWA World Women 's Championship . She was not immediately recognized by everyone as the NWA Champion because Billy Wolfe , with whom she had had conflict earlier in her career , still controlled the promotion . After the match , Vince McMahon , Sr. dubbed Ellison with a new ring name – The Fabulous Moolah . Subsequently , June Byers came out of retirement to challenge Moolah to a match for the title . During the match , Moolah acted as the aggressor and pinned Byers to retain the championship . Moolah 's first World Championship reign lasted over ten years . Moolah successfully defended the belt against the top female wrestlers in the world , such as Judy Grable and Donna Christanello , while also purporting to befriend some of the biggest celebrities of the day . Moolah claimed in her book , " First Goddess of the Squared Circle , " that she formed friendships with Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis . 
 After June Byers retired in 1964 , Moolah was subsequently recognized as official NWA Champion , thus making her the undisputed Women ’ s World Champion . Nevertheless , Moolah dropped the belt on September 17 , 1966 to Bette Boucher , although she regained the title just weeks later . She also traded the belt with Yukiko Tomoe during a tour of Japan in 1968 . On July 1 , 1972 , Moolah became the first woman allowed to wrestle at Madison Square Garden , which had previously banned women 's wrestling . In fact , Moolah helped overturn the ban on women 's wrestling in the entire state of New York , which the New York State Athletic Commission lifted in June 1972 . During her quest to overturn the ban , she flipped football player Roosevelt " Rosey " Grier onto his back on The Mike Douglas Show . Moolah continued an uninterrupted eight @-@ year reign before losing to Sue Green at Madison Square Garden in 1976 . Moolah regained her title a short time later . She also bought the legal rights to the championship in the late 1970s , and after losing the championship for two days to Evelyn Stevens in 1978 , began another long reign , defending her title for another six years . Also in the 1970s , Moolah held the NWA Women 's World Tag Team Championship twice with Toni Rose . 
 = = = Rock ' n ' Wrestling Connection ( 1980s ) = = = 
 In 1983 , Vince McMahon , Jr. began expanding the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) nationally , and Moolah sold him the rights to her Women ’ s World Championship . Moolah agreed to appear exclusively for the WWF , and thus became the first WWF Women 's Champion . The following year , singer Cyndi Lauper began a verbal feud with manager " Captain " Lou Albano , who long had a reputation of being a villain , that brought professional wrestling into mainstream culture in a storyline that became known as the " Rock ' n ' Wrestling Connection . " When it was finally time for Lauper and Albano to settle their differences in the ring , a match @-@ up was scheduled with Albano representing Moolah against the challenge of Lauper ’ s protégé , Wendi Richter . After much buildup and hype , the Fabulous Moolah lost the championship when defeated by Richter , who had Lauper in her corner , on July 23 , 1984 in the main event of The Brawl to End It All , which was broadcast live on MTV . Prior to the match , the WWF promoted Moolah as holding the championship for the previous 28 years . 
 After losing the title to Richter , Moolah aided Leilani Kai in defeating Richter for the title in February 1985 . Richter won it back at the inaugural WrestleMania , but when Richter ’ s relationship soured with the WWF , Moolah donned a mask as " The Spider Lady " and regained the belt on November 25 , 1985 , in a controversial decision . Richter was never told she would be losing the title and fell victim to a real @-@ life " screwjob " finish known as " The Original Screwjob " . Richter promptly quit the WWF afterward , while Moolah continued to be champion for another two years — excluding a six @-@ day reign by Velvet McIntyre during a tour of Australia in 1986 — before losing the belt to Sherri Martel on July 24 , 1987 . She later captained a team at the inaugural Survivor Series . Her team ( Moolah , Velvet McIntyre , Rockin ' Robin , and the Jumping Bomb Angels ) defeated champion Martel and her team ( Leilani Kai , Judy Martin , Donna Christanello , and Dawn Marie ) . 
 = = = Semi @-@ retirement = = = 
 Throughout the early 1990s , she made appearances in video packages and at live WWF events . On June 24 , 1995 , she was the first female wrestler to be inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame . In the late 1990s , Pat Patterson and Ellison began jokingly discussing a comeback for her , which resulted in Patterson contacting WWF Chairman Vince McMahon about the possibility . In 1998 , Moolah and Mae Young re @-@ emerged in the WWF ( later renamed World Wrestling Entertainment , WWE ) . The WWF women 's division , however , had since moved away from the traditional athletic match @-@ ups of the past and now featured women competing in sexually @-@ themed bikini contests and strip matches . 
 Moolah received a call from McMahon in late 1998 about returning to the company . On the September 9 , 1999 episode of SmackDown ! , Jeff Jarrett invited Moolah , 76 , into the ring and smashed a guitar over her head . Moolah and Young then began appearing regularly in comedic roles . On the September 27 , 1999 episode of Monday Night Raw , Moolah and Young defeated Ivory in a Handicapped Evening Gown match , which led to a title match at No Mercy on October 17 , 1999 . The match saw seventy @-@ six @-@ year @-@ old Moolah defeat Ivory to regain the WWE Women 's Championship , thus becoming the oldest WWE Women 's Champion ever , though she lost the title to Ivory eight days later . 
 On the September 15 , 2003 episode of Raw , Moolah won a match against Victoria . Moolah had been promised the match for her eightieth birthday and became the first octogenarian to compete in a WWE ring . After Moolah 's victory , the " Legend Killer " Randy Orton came out and performed an RKO on her . Moolah and Young made another appearance at New Years Revolution in 2006 , during a Bra and Panties Gauntlet match attacking Victoria and stripping her of her top . She also made brief appearances at WrestleMania 23 and the 2007 Draft Lottery on June 11 , 2007 . Her last WWE appearance before her death was at SummerSlam in August 2007 , in a backstage segment with Vince McMahon and Raw General Manager William Regal . 
 = = Training and promoting = = 
 Ellison and her second husband Johnny Long began training women to become female wrestlers , which included Ella Waldek , Daisy Mae , and Katherine Simpson . Long later contacted promoter Jack <unk> , who agreed to book some of the wrestlers at his shows . After marrying wrestler Buddy Lee , he began helping Ellison train the female wrestlers . After she left Pfeffer 's promotion in the 1950s , Ellison found it difficult to book her trainees in shows due to Pfeffer 's influence over other National Wrestling Alliance promoters . Ellison claimed Pfeffer would threaten to reveal the pre @-@ planned nature of wrestling if any other promoters did not do as he liked . As a result , Ellison began selling cosmetics door @-@ to @-@ door and Lee opened a service station to make enough money to pay their bills . They later began to book their wrestlers , including Judy Grable in Boston , under promoter Paul Bowser . 
 In the late 1950s when the once @-@ dominant promoter of women 's wrestling , Billy Wolfe , was out of business , Ellison and Lee began to book their female wrestlers for more and more shows . They began calling their promoting business Girl Wrestling Enterprises ( <unk> ) . Ellison demanded a lot from the girls of <unk> , including that they had to keep their hair and make @-@ up done , act like a lady , and not date men who were in the professional wrestling business . In addition to women , Ellison also trained midget professional wrestlers , including Katie Glass in the 1960s . Ellison founded the Ladies ' International Wrestling Association , a non @-@ profit organization to help retired professional wrestlers , in the late 1980s . In the 1990s , she spent most of her time training female wrestlers at her school in Columbia , South Carolina . She also began training men , including Del Wilkes , and in 1995 trained more men than women . She also spent time training in Los Angeles at Verne Langdon 's Slammers Gym . 
 However , Wendi Richter stated that Ellison did not actually train the wrestlers at her wrestling school . Instead , Richter stated that Ellison accepted payment of the training fee ( which at the time of Richter 's training was five hundred dollars ) and had other female wrestlers within her camp ( including Leilani Kai , Judy Martin , Winona <unk> , and Joyce Grable ) train the new recruits , and that these women did not get paid for their additional work as trainers . Richter also stated that Ellison required all women that received training at her camp to each sign a contract that allowed Ellison to function as their booker and receive twenty five percent of their booking fee . Trainees were also required to rent duplex apartments on Ellison 's property and they were responsible for paying her for rent and utilities . The training lasted six months and took place up to five hours per day inside a wrestling ring in a barn that lacked heating and air conditioning or fans . Debbie Johnson , another former trainee of Ellison 's , stated that she was required to give Ellison thirty percent of her booking fee , and her paycheck was further reduced as Ellison deducted travel expenses , food , rent , and utilities before paying her . As a result , Johnson worked for Ellison for two years before she received any money . Johnson stated that Ellison would refuse to book certain women in her training camp if they angered her , and that Ellison monitored her and refused to let her leave the physical constraints of the training camp unless she was accompanied by someone else . 
 Over the years , various female wrestlers have come forward with stories accusing Ellison of being a pimp that often provided various wrestling promoters with unsuspecting female wrestlers that would be used as sex objects . One of the most notorious accusations is from the family of Sweet Georgia Brown ( Susie Mae McCoy ) . McCoy , who was trained and booked by Ellison and her then @-@ husband Buddy Lee , told her daughter that she was often raped , given drugs and made an addict in an intentional attempt by Ellison and Lee to control her . Ida Martinez , who wrestled during the 1960s , also recalls that many of the regional promoters “ demanded personal services ” before they would pay the female wrestlers . In a 2002 interview , Luna Vachon claimed that when she was sixteen years old and training at Ellison 's camp , Ellison sent her out of state to be photographed by an older man . Although she remained clothed during the photo shoot , Vachon stated she felt taken advantage of by Ellison and the older man . Vachon also stated that her aunt , Vivian Vachon , witnessed Ellison abusing alcohol and having sex with her female trainees . Sandy Parker , a lesbian former pupil of Ellison 's , also claims that Ellison forbade her from going to any gay bars and tried to press her to date men . Parker says this <unk> her , because " ( Moolah ) was two faced because she had her own little dalliances that we all knew about . " 
 As well as allegedly exploiting female wrestlers sexually , Ellison has been accused of using her financial influence to control the women 's wrestling scene and ensure that other women did not gain greater recognition . In addition to being a key participant in the original screwjob on Wendi Richter , Ellison used her influence to take over the spot originally held by her protégé Mad Maxine on the animated series Hulk Hogan 's Rock ' n ' Wrestling . Maxine was about to receive a big push by Vince McMahon but left the WWF shortly afterwards , as Ellison was unwilling to provide her with additional bookings . Numerous other former trainees defected from Ellison after growing tired of sharing their paychecks with Ellison . Women wrestlers including Vivian and Luna Vachon , Ann Casey , and Darling Dagmar moved into other regions where Ellison had less control and negotiated their own payouts with promoters . 
 Both Judy Martin and Leilani Kai told in later interviews that Moolah would collect the women wrestler 's pay from promoters , and after taking out her own pay , would only give the girls half of the money they were owed ( keeping half of their pay for herself , plus her own pay ) and telling them that was all the promoter gave her to give them . Martin stated that shortly before Ellison left the WWF in 1988 ( shortly after falling out with Martin and Kai due to Ellison no longer receiving their booking fees ) , she sabotaged the duo while they were touring Japan . Martin stated that Ellison contacted Japanese promoters and informed them that the Jumping Bomb Angels were supposed to drop the WWF Women 's Tag Team Championship to The Glamour Girls before Martin and Kai returned to the United States . This was contrary to the booking decision made by Pat Patterson before the Japanese tour began . Unable to reach Patterson by telephone , Kai and Martin agreed to win the titles from the Angels since Ellison had already misinformed the Japanese promoters . Martin stated that upon returning to the United States , Patterson was angry with them and confirmed that nobody within the WWF made the decision for the title change and that due to her long @-@ standing relationship with the company , the WWF refused to listen to their explanation of Ellison 's deceit . Shortly thereafter , the WWF phased out the WWF Women 's Tag Team Championship . In a later shoot interview , Leilani Kai told that had things gone as the WWF originally planned , The Glamour Girls would have had a title match against the Jumping Bomb Angels at Wrestlemania IV and that Ellison 's actions had cost the four girls what would have been ultimately their biggest ever payday . 
 Women that chose to continue allowing Ellison to work as their booker were kept under tight control . Velvet McIntyre was forced to compete against Ellison ( whom McIntyre stated she didn 't care for ) at WrestleMania 2 instead of competing during an all @-@ women tour of Kuwait with a group of Ellison 's other female wrestlers . Their Wrestlemania 2 match lasted less than two minutes with the referee ignoring McIntyre 's leg being on the ropes while she was being pinned . Women that did not agree to Ellison 's booking fees faced limited options . Rhonda Sing stated that Ellison contacted her and offered to let her wrestle Richter in a couple of pay @-@ per @-@ view matches for the WWF in 1985 , but demanded she receive half of Sing 's pay check ; a stipulation Sing was unwilling to accept . Penny Banner stated that her retirement was due in large part to Ellison refusing to allow any of her female wrestlers to accept bookings against Banner , which severely limited the number of bookings that Banner was offered by promoters .

 An animated version of Moolah was included on a CBS Saturday morning cartoon during this lucrative time , titled Hulk Hogan 's Rock ' n ' Wrestling . In addition , she appeared in one of Cyndi Lauper 's music videos , " The Goonies ' R ' Good Enough " . An illness in the mid @-@ 1970s meant Ellison had to pull out of the Bill Cosby movie Mother , <unk> & Speed , which had a role written specifically for her . In 2002 , Moolah wrote her autobiography , The Fabulous Moolah : First Goddess of the Squared Circle . The book has been criticized for keeping kayfabe ( the stance that wrestling storylines are real ) and did not reveal a lot about her time controlling women 's wrestling . Defending herself against these claims , Ellison retorted it was hard to fit all of her almost five decade career into one book . 
 Moolah and Young , along with several other female wrestlers , starred in the 2004 film Lipstick and Dynamite a documentary about the female wrestlers from the 1950s era . They also appeared on Late Night with Conan O 'Brien promoting the film . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Ellison 's first husband was Walter Carroll , who became the father of her daughter Mary . Mary wrestled briefly but decided against pursuing the profession . Ellison had six grandchildren , five biological and one adopted . Ellison and Carroll divorced shortly after their daughter 's birth . Later , Ellison married wrestler Johnny Long . Marital conflicts developed when Long wanted Ellison to be a housewife instead of a career woman . In addition , Ellison claims Long was a " womanizer " . Ellison and Long divorced . Ellison also says that she dated country singer Hank Williams for four months in 1952 . According to Ellison , Williams proposed to her , but Williams 's drinking and heroin abuse forced the couple to go separate ways . She further claimed that he wanted Ellison to quit her wrestling career , which she did not want to do . Two months after the breakup , Williams died due to an overdose . 
 Later , Ellison met a wrestler named Buddy Lee , whom she claims was the " love of her life . " They were eventually married , and after divorcing in 1970 after nine years of marriage , they remained friends until Lee 's death in 1999 . The divorce was attributed to Lee 's affair with Rita Cortez , one of the wrestlers the duo was training . In the early 1980s , Ellison opened Moolah 's Hideaway , a bar and grill which was operated by her daughter Mary and frequented by André the Giant . 
 Beginning in 1991 , Ellison lived with Mae Young in a house in Columbia , South Carolina . Her estate was located on a road named Moolah Drive . A midget professional wrestler named Katie Glass also lived with Moolah for over 40 years . Another wrestler , Donna Christanello , also lived with Ellison on @-@ and @-@ off for 40 years , ending in May 1999 . 
 During her return to the ring in 1999 , Ellison began experiencing occasional dizziness , and as a result , her doctor requested that she begin to wear a heart monitor . A few days later , Ellison was admitted to the hospital for what turned out to be two clogged arteries and viral pneumonia . She stayed at the intensive @-@ care unit of the hospital for 24 days , during which she was unconscious for fifteen days .

 = Larry David = 
 Lawrence Gene " Larry " David ( born July 2 , 1947 ) is an American comedian , writer , actor , and television producer . He and Jerry Seinfeld created the television series Seinfeld , and he served as its head writer and executive producer from 1989 to 1996 . David has subsequently gained further recognition for the HBO series Curb Your Enthusiasm , which he also created , in which he stars as a semi @-@ fictionalized version of himself . 
 David 's work won him a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1993 . Formerly a stand @-@ up comedian , David went into television comedy , writing and starring in ABC 's Fridays , as well as writing briefly for Saturday Night Live . He has won two Primetime Emmy Awards as well as being voted by fellow comedians and comedy insiders as number 23 of the greatest comedy stars ever in a 2004 British poll to select " The Comedian 's Comedian " . 
 = = Early life = = 
 David was born in the neighborhood of Sheepshead Bay , in Brooklyn , New York , the son of Rose ( née Ratner ) and Morty David , who was a men 's clothing manufacturer . His family is Jewish . He graduated from Sheepshead Bay High School , and then from the University of Maryland with a bachelor 's degree in History , before graduating in Business Administration from Maryland 's Robert H. Smith School of Business . After college , he enlisted in the United States Army Reserve . 
 = = Career = = 
 While a stand @-@ up comedian , David also worked as a store clerk , limousine driver , and historian . He lived in Manhattan Plaza , a federally subsidized housing complex in the Hell 's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan , across the hall from Kenny Kramer , the inspiration for the Cosmo Kramer character in Seinfeld . David then became a writer for and cast member of ABC 's Fridays from 1980 to 1982 , and a writer for NBC 's Saturday Night Live ( SNL ) from 1984 to 1985 . During his time at SNL , he was able to get only one sketch on the show , which aired at 12 : 50 AM , the last time slot on the show . 
 David quit his writing job at SNL in the first season , only to show up to work a few days later acting as though nothing had happened . That event inspired a second @-@ season episode of Seinfeld entitled " The Revenge " . David met his future Seinfeld stars during that early stage of his career : he worked with Michael Richards ( Kramer ) on Fridays and with Julia Louis @-@ Dreyfus ( Elaine ) on SNL . He can be heard heckling Michael McKean when McKean hosted SNL in 1984 , and he can be seen in the sketch " The Run , Throw , and Catch Like a Girl Olympics " when Howard Cosell hosted the season finale in 1985 . 
 = = = Seinfeld = = = 
 In 1989 , David teamed up with comedian Jerry Seinfeld to create a pilot for NBC called The Seinfeld Chronicles , which became the basis for Seinfeld , one of the most successful shows in history , reaching the top of TV Guide 's list of the 50 greatest TV shows of all time . Entertainment Weekly ranked it the third @-@ best TV show of all time . David made occasional uncredited appearances on the show , playing such roles as Frank Costanza 's cape @-@ wearing lawyer and the voice of George Steinbrenner . He was also the primary inspiration for the show 's character George Costanza . David left Seinfeld on friendly terms after the seventh season but returned to write the series finale in 1998 , two years later . He also continued to provide the voice for the Steinbrenner character . 
 David wrote 62 of the episodes of Seinfeld , including 1992 's " The Contest " , for which he won a Primetime Emmy Award and which TV Guide ranked the episode No. 1 on its list of " TV 's Top 100 Episodes of All Time " . Syndication of Seinfeld earned David an estimated US $ 250 million in 1998 alone . This amount has been steadily decreasing each year , but payments will continue until the full $ 1 @.@ 7 billion from the original deal has been paid . In 2008 David made $ 55 million from Seinfeld syndication , DVD sales , and Curb Your Enthusiasm . He was nominated for an Emmy award 19 times for Seinfeld , winning twice – once for best comedy and once for writing . 
 = = = Curb Your Enthusiasm = = = 
 The HBO cable television channel aired David 's 1 @-@ hour special , Larry David : Curb Your Enthusiasm , on October 17 , 1999 . This was followed by Curb Your Enthusiasm , a television series on HBO that aired its first episode on October 15 , 2000 . The show revisits many of the themes of Seinfeld , and is improvised from a story outline only several pages long that David writes ( as of the 5th season , additional writers were hired ) . 
 The actors improvise their dialogue based on the story outline , direction , and their own creativity . David has said that his character in the show , a fictionalized version of himself , is what he would be like in real life if he lacked social awareness and sensitivity . The character 's numerous and frequent social faux pas , misunderstandings , and ironic coincidences are the basis of much of the show 's comedy and have led to the entry into the American pop culture lexicon of the expression " Larry David moment " , meaning an inadvertently created socially awkward situation . 
 The basis of the show is the events in David 's life following the fortune he earned from the Seinfeld series ; David , semi @-@ retired , strives to live a fulfilled life . Alongside David is his wife Cheryl ( played by Cheryl Hines ) , his manager and best friend Jeff ( played by Jeff Garlin ) , and Jeff 's wife Susie ( played by Susie <unk> ) . Celebrities , including comedians Bob Einstein , Wanda Sykes , and Richard Lewis , appear on the show regularly . Actors Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen have had recurring roles as themselves . 
 The show is critically acclaimed and has been nominated for 30 Primetime Emmy Awards , with one win , as well as one Golden Globe win . In the first six seasons , Julia Louis @-@ Dreyfus and Jason Alexander appeared in several episodes , and Jerry Seinfeld made a cameo . In season 7 , the cast of Seinfeld , including Michael Richards , returned in a story arc involving David 's attempt to organize a Seinfeld reunion special . 
 On Wednesday , June 2 , 2010 , the series premiered on the TV Guide Network , making its network television debut . TV Guide Network also produced a series of related discussions with high @-@ profile guest stars , media pundits , and prominent social figures called " Curb : The Discussion " debating the moral implications depicted in each episode . David is quoted as saying " Finally , thanks to the TV Guide Network , I 'll get a chance to watch actual , intelligent people discuss and debate the issues addressed on ' Curb ' . Now if only someone could tell me where this alleged ' Network ' is , I might even watch it . "

 David has also been involved in other films and television series . David wrote and directed the 1998 film Sour Grapes , about two cousins who feud over a casino jackpot . It was neither a commercial nor a critical success . He appeared in minor parts in two Woody Allen films – Radio Days and New York Stories – before taking the leading role in Allen 's New York @-@ based comedy film Whatever Works ( 2009 ) . Because his daughters were Hannah Montana fans , David , along with his daughters , guest @-@ starred , as themselves , in the episode " My Best Friend 's Boyfriend , " in which they were waiting for a table at a fancy restaurant . David had a cameo appearance on the HBO series Entourage as a client of Ari Gold , and also appeared as a panelist on the NBC series The Marriage Ref . During the 2008 U.S Presidential Election , David supported and actively campaigned for Barack Obama . In December 2010 , David penned an op @-@ ed piece for The New York Times , a sardonic critique of the extension of Bush @-@ era tax cuts headlined " Thanks for the Tax Cut ! " David played Sister Mary @-@ Mengele in the 2012 reboot of The Three Stooges . David co @-@ wrote and starred in the 2013 HBO television film Clear History . 
 David stars in the Broadway play Fish In The Dark , which he also wrote , alongside Rita Wilson , Jayne <unk> and Rosie Perez . The play centers on the death of a family patriarch and opened March 5 , 2015 . As of February 1 , 2015 , its advance sale of $ 13 @.@ 5 million had broken records for a Broadway show . 
 In 2015 and 2016 , David had multiple guest appearances portraying 2016 U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Saturday Night Live ; he also hosted the show on February 6 , 2016 , with musical guest The 1975 and a cameo from Sanders himself .

 David married Laurie Lennard on March 31 , 1993 . They have two daughters , and lived in Pacific Palisades , California . David and his wife became contributing bloggers at The Huffington Post in May 2005 . On June 5 , 2007 , the couple announced their intention to separate amicably . Laurie David filed for divorce on July 13 , 2007 , citing irreconcilable differences and seeking joint custody of the couple 's two daughters . As of 2013 , David 's estimated net worth was $ 900 million . However , the estimate according to a former Reuters reporter does not take into account the divorce . David also disputes the figure , saying he has nowhere near that amount . 
 The results of a DNA test shown live on Lopez Tonight in 2009 revealed that 37 % of David 's ethnic lineage might be Native American , though some criticism was shared about the method of testing that the show used . Specifically : " The best known quirk of the test Lopez Tonight is using is its problem distinguishing between Iberian , Italian , and Ashkenazi heritage . Many people of Iberian , Italian and Ashkenazi heritage are assigned Native American ancestry - and Larry David is Ashkenazi . "

 = Canada 's Walk of Fame = 
 Canada 's Walk of Fame ( French : Allée des <unk> <unk> ) , located in Toronto , Ontario , Canada , is a walk of fame that acknowledges the achievements and accomplishments of successful Canadians . It consists of a series of maple leaf @-@ like stars embedded in 13 designated blocks ' worth of sidewalks in Toronto , located in front of Roy Thomson Hall , The Princess of Wales Theatre , and The Royal Alexandra Theatre on King Street as well as Simcoe Street . 
 The first group of members was inducted in 1998 , and to date 163 Canadians have been inducted into Canada 's Walk of Fame . These Inductees include athletes ; coaches ; actors , directors , writers and producers of movies , television and stage ; singers , songwriters and musicians ; playwrights ; authors ; comedians ; cartoonists and models . 
 = = History = = 
 The Walk of Fame was first conceived in 1996 when co @-@ founder , Peter <unk> , suggested the idea of a Walk of Fame for famous Torontonians to the board of the Toronto Entertainment District Association . They rejected his idea , but he went on to establish a Walk of Fame for Canadians in partnership with Bill Ballard , Dusty Cohl and Gary Slaight . In spite of a lack of funds , research and no media plan , they managed to succeed and the first class of inductees was inducted in 1998 . Canada 's Walk of Fame has since become a popular tourist attraction in Toronto and has been named the number one Canadian recognition event . 
 = = Walk of Fame = = 
 = = = Induction process = = = 
 Canada 's Walk of Fame accepts nominations for potential inductees from the public year round , culminating with their National Nomination Promotion during the month of April . In 2000 , prior to the introduction of the online voting system , over 30 @,@ 000 nominations were received via letters , fax and e @-@ mail . Now submissions are accepted on the official Canada 's Walk of Fame website and thousands of nominations are received every year , which are then sent to selection committee for consideration . 
 The committee then analyzes the nominees based on the following criteria : the nominee was born in Canada or has spent their formative or creative years in Canada ; they have had a minimum of 10 years experience in their field ; they have had a national or international impact on Canada ’ s Cultural heritage . Following the Selection Committee 's evaluation , the nominees that meet all of the requirements are forwarded to the board of directors , who then select the inductees . 
 The process differs greatly from that of the Hollywood Walk of Fame . The Hollywood version allows only celebrities of the silver screen , television , radio , live theatre and singers / musicians , while Canada 's Walk allows people of more diverse occupations , as listed above . While most celebrities on the Hollywood Walk of Fame are American or have achieved their fame in the United States , Canada 's Walk of Fame is exclusive to Canadians . For someone to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame , they must be nominated by a sponsor who must agree to field the approximately $ 25 @,@ 000 cost of installing a star . From there , the names are submitted to a nominating committee of five people , who pick 10 – 15 names to award stars to annually . The only criteria for it are : " professional achievement , longevity of five years or more , contributions to the community and the guarantee that the celebrity will attend the dedication ceremony if selected . " 
 Canadian stars are inducted in an annual group ceremony ; while the Hollywood Walk of Fame rarely inducts more than two major stars at a time . Celebrities can have more than one star on the Hollywood Walk , the same celebrity can receive as many as five stars under the various categories . This does not happen with Canada 's Walk of Fame , although some may have an individual star but are also included as part of a larger group , such as John Candy , Martin Short , Eugene Levy and Catherine O 'Hara who have their own star but also were in Second City Television . 
 = = = Induction ceremony = = = 
 New inductees are inducted annually at an unveiling ceremony where their star , a stylized maple leaf , is revealed . The first was held in 1998 and only four of the twelve living inductees attended : Karen Kain , Norman Jewison , Barbara Ann Scott and Rich Little . The 2007 ceremony was held at Toronto 's Hummingbird Centre , was attended by all seven inductees and was hosted by Eugene Levy . 
 Past hosts include Trish Stratus , Tom Green , Jann Arden , Kurt Browning and Catriona Le May Doan . The ceremony was broadcast by CTV until 2008 . Beginning in 2009 the ceremony was broadcast by Global . The first ceremony on the network was hosted by Anne Murray while Howie Mandel hosted for the following two years . Paul Shaffer hosted the event in 2012 .

 In 1998 , Laurie Brown of the CBC criticized the Walk of Fame , calling it " just an attraction to lure tourists to theatres in the area .

But I doubt I 'm going to see a star on the Walk of Fame that is only a known @-@ name here in Canada . " 
 In September 2010 , William Shatner commented on Twitter regarding damage to his star on the Walk of Fame : " I hear my star on the Canadian Walk of Fame is a bit frazzled ... but , then again , so am I. I wonder if anybody hovering around that area can tell me what ’ s wrong with it and what needs fixing . " The family of Gordie Howe also commented on the damage to Gordie 's star . The Canadian Press reported that " A number of celebrities ' stars are looking a bit rough around the edges . " The president of the Walk of Fame stated that damage was due to the freezing and thawing during Canadian winters and also sidewalk snowplows . It was announced that the city of Toronto would replace Shatner and Howe 's damaged tiles , and the Walk of Fame was looking into an alternative to installing the plaques on a sidewalk where they are subjected to harsh environmental conditions . 
 = Robert R. Wilson = 
 Robert Rathbun Wilson ( March 4 , 1914 – January 16 , 2000 ) was an American physicist known for his work on the Manhattan Project during World War II , as a sculptor , and as an architect of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory ( Fermilab ) , where he was the first director from 1967 to 1978 . 
 A graduate of the University of California , Berkeley ( BA and PhD ) , Wilson received his doctorate under the supervision of Ernest Lawrence for his work on the development of the cyclotron at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory . He subsequently went to Princeton University to work with Henry DeWolf Smyth on electromagnetic separation of the isotopes of uranium . In 1943 , Wilson and many of his colleagues joined the Manhattan Project 's Los Alamos Laboratory , where Wilson became the head of its Cyclotron Group ( R @-@ 1 ) , and later its Research ( R ) Division . 
 After the war , Wilson briefly joined the faculty of Harvard University as an associate professor , then went to Cornell University as professor of physics and the director of its new Laboratory of Nuclear Studies . Wilson and his Cornell colleagues constructed four electron synchrotrons . In 1967 he assumed directorship of the National Accelerator Laboratory , subsequently known as the Fermilab . He managed to complete the facility on time and under budget , but at the same time made it aesthetically pleasing , with a main administrative building purposely reminiscent of the Beauvais Cathedral , and a restored prairie with a herd of American Bison . He resigned in 1978 in a protest against inadequate government funding . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Robert Rathbun Wilson was born in Frontier , Wyoming , in 1914 , the son of Platt Elvin and Edith Elizabeth ( Rathbun ) Wilson . He had an older sister , Mary Jane . His parents separated when he was eight years old , and custody was awarded to his father , although he lived with his mother from time to time . Much of his early life was spent on cattle ranches . He changed schools frequently , and attended a number of schools , including the Todd School in Woodstock , Illinois , where his grandmother worked . 
 Wilson entered the University of California , Berkeley , in 1932 , and was awarded his Bachelor of Arts ( AB ) degree cum laude in 1936 . He joined Ernest O. Lawrence 's Radiation Laboratory , which was at that time blossoming into the top American site for both experimental and theoretical physics due to the efforts of Lawrence and J. Robert Oppenheimer , respectively . Wilson received his Doctor of Philosophy ( PhD ) in 1940 for his thesis on " Theory of the Cyclotron " . That year he married Jane Inez Scheyer . 
 Wilson ran into trouble with Lawrence 's harsh frugality while working on his cyclotron and was fired twice from the Radiation Laboratory . The first time was for losing a rubber seal in the 37 @-@ inch cyclotron which prevented its use in a demonstration to a potential donor . He was later rehired at Luis Alvarez 's urging , but melted an expensive pair of pliers whilst welding , and was fired again . Though offered his job back , he decided instead to go to Princeton University to work with Henry DeWolf Smyth . 
 = = Manhattan Project = = 
 At Princeton , Wilson eventually took over Smyth 's project the development of an alternative approach to electromagnetic separation from Lawrence 's calutron method , used for the purpose of separating the fissile uranium @-@ 235 isotope of uranium from the much more common uranium @-@ 238 , which is a key step to producing an atomic bomb . By 1941 the project had produced a device called the " isotron , " which , unlike the calutron , used an electrical field to separate the uranium instead of a magnetic one . 
 The work at Princeton was terminated during World War II when Oppenheimer 's secret laboratory for research on the atomic bomb , the Manhattan Project 's Los Alamos National Laboratory , opened in 1943 . " Like a bunch of professional soldiers , " Wilson later recalled , " we signed up , en masse , to go to Los Alamos . " 
 Wilson moved there with some of his Princeton staff and Harvard University 's cyclotron , and was appointed as head of the Cyclotron Group ( R @-@ 1 ) by Oppenheimer . Only in his late twenties , he was the youngest group leader in the experimental division . The cyclotron would be used for measurements of the neutron cross section of plutonium . 
 When Oppenheimer reorganized the laboratory in August 1944 to focus on the development of an implosion @-@ type nuclear weapon , Wilson became head of R ( Research ) Division . As such he had four groups reporting to him : the Cyclotron Group ( R @-@ 1 ) , still headed by himself ; the Electrostatic Group ( R @-@ 2 ) , headed by John H. Williams ; the D @-@ D ( Deuterium @-@ Deuterium ) Group ( R @-@ 3 ) , headed by John H. Manley ; and the Radioactivity Group ( R @-@ 4 ) , headed by Emilio G. Segrè . In March 1945 , R Division acquired the additional responsibility of developing instrumentation for the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945 . Wilson helped stack boxes of explosives for the 100 @-@ ton test that preceded it . At Los Alamos , he was also active in community affairs , serving on the town council . 
 In May 1945 , when Nazi Germany surrendered , and the initial motivation for the crash atomic bomb project dissipated as it was discovered that the German nuclear energy project was years behind , Wilson raised the question of whether they should continue with their work . News of this met with an icy reception from Major General Leslie Groves , director of the Manhattan Project . In later life , when interviewed in the Oscar @-@ nominated documentary The Day After Trinity ( 1980 ) , Wilson would say that he should have strongly considered ceasing work on the bomb after the surrender of Germany , and regretted not doing so to some extent . 
 After the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , Wilson helped organize the Association of Los Alamos Scientists ( <unk> ) , which called , with a scientists ' petition , for the international control of atomic energy . The petition was carried by Oppenheimer to Washington , D.C. , eventually making its way via Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson to President Harry S. Truman .

 After the war , Wilson also helped form the Federation of American Scientists and served as its chairman in 1946 . He accepted an appointment as an associate professor at Harvard , but spent the first eight months of 1946 at Berkeley designing a new 150 MeV cyclotron for Harvard to replace the one taken to Los Alamos . At Harvard , Wilson published a seminal paper , " Radiological Use of Fast Protons " , which founded the field of proton therapy . 
 = = = Cornell = = = 
 In 1947 Wilson went to Cornell University as professor of physics and the director of its new Laboratory of Nuclear Studies . At Cornell , Wilson and his colleagues constructed four electron synchrotrons . The first , a 300 MeV synchrotron , was under construction when he arrived . In a 1948 report to the Office of Naval Research , he described their purpose : 
 The most important problems of nuclear physics , to our minds are : What are the elementary particles of which nuclei are made and what is the nature of the forces that hold these particles together ? A more general but connected problem concerns the general expression of electrical laws at such high energies as will be produced by our synchrotron . Our experiments are planned to attack all three problems . Thus we hope to produce artificial mesons which are supposedly elementary particles and to study the interactions of these mesons with nuclei . Further , we shall explore the electrical interactions of high energy electrons with electrons and protons in search of evidence pointing to a correct theory of electricity at high energy . 
 Wilson initiated the construction of a 1 @.@ 4 GeV synchrotron in 1952 . As he had foreseen in 1948 , it produced artificial K mesons and rho mesons , and tested quantum electrodynamics at short distances . The last machine he built at Cornell was a 12 GeV synchrotron that remains in use as an injector for the Cornell Electron Storage Ring ( CESR ) , built between 1977 and 1999 . It is located in what is now known as the Wilson Synchrotron Laboratory . 
 Wilson was one of the first physicists to use Monte Carlo methods , which he used to model electron and proton initiated particle showers . He invented the <unk> so that he could measure the intensity of high @-@ energy X @-@ ray beams . 
 = = = Fermilab = = = 
 In 1967 he took a leave of absence from Cornell to assume directorship of the nascent National Accelerator Laboratory at Batavia , Illinois , which was to be largest particle accelerator constructed to date . In 1969 , Wilson was called to justify the multimillion @-@ dollar machine to the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy . <unk> the trend of the day , Wilson emphasized it had nothing at all to do with national security , rather : 
 It only has to do with the respect with which we regard one another , the dignity of men , our love of culture ... It has to do with : Are we good painters , good sculptors , great poets ? I mean all the things that we really venerate and honor in our country and are patriotic about . In that sense , this new knowledge has all to do with honor and country but it has nothing to do directly with defending our country except to help make it worth defending . 
 Thanks to Wilson 's talented leadership , a management style very much adopted from Lawrence , the facility was completed on time and under budget . According to Wilson , he gave Atomic Energy Commission chairman Glenn T. Seaborg his assurance " signed in blood " that he would not exceed the authorized $ 250 million budget and " would rot in Hell " if he did . The facility centered on a four @-@ mile circumference , 400 GeV accelerator . Wilson subsequently initiated the design of the <unk> , a 1 TeV particle accelerator . The National Accelerator Laboratory , was renamed the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in 1974 , after Enrico Fermi . It is frequently referred to as " Fermilab " . 
 Wilson had studied sculpture at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze in Italy while on sabbatical in 1961 , and he wanted Fermilab to be an appealing place to work , believing that external harmony would encourage internal harmony as well , and labored personally to keep it from looking like a stereotypical " government lab " , playing a key role in its design and architecture . Surrounding the facility was a restored prairie which served as a home to a herd of American Bison that started with Wilson bringing in a bull and four cows in 1969 . 
 The site also had ponds , and a main building purposely reminiscent of the Beauvais Cathedral . Fermilab also celebrates his role as a sculptor , featuring several of his works , including " The Mobius Strip " , " The Hyperbolic Obelisk " , " <unk> " , and " Broken Symmetry " . Another metal sculpture " Topological III " sits in the lobby of the Harvard Science Center . Fermilab 's Central Laboratory building was named Robert Rathbun Wilson Hall in his honor in 1980 . 
 Wilson served as the director of Fermilab until 1978 , when he resigned in protest against what he considered was inadequate funding by the Federal government . He then joined the faculty of the University of Chicago as <unk> Professor at the Enrico Fermi Institute . He became Emeritus Professor of Physics at Chicago in 1980 . He moved to Columbia University , where he became I. I. Rabi Visiting Professor of Science and Human Relations in 1979 , Michael I. Pupin Professor of Physics in 1980 , and Emeritus Professor in 1982 . He retired in 1983 and moved back to Ithaca , NY .

 " Props " is the twentieth episode of the third season of the American musical television series Glee , and the sixty @-@ fourth overall . Written and directed by Ian Brennan , the episode is the first of two new episodes that aired back @-@ to @-@ back on Fox in the United States on May 15 , 2012 . It features New Directions preparing a new performance routine for the impending Nationals competition , an extended sequence in which Tina ( Jenna Ushkowitz ) has a vision of the glee club having swapped roles , including herself as Rachel , and an appearance by special guest star Whoopi Goldberg as NYADA dean Carmen Tibideaux . 
 The episode received mostly positive reviews overall , though reaction to the musical performances was not as strong . The body @-@ swap sequence was given an enthusiastic reception . The scenes featuring Coach Beiste ( Dot @-@ Marie Jones ) and Puck ( Mark Salling ) were also much praised , and in particular the pair 's acting was highlighted . Their performance of the song " Mean " , by contrast , received the most divergent reactions from reviewers , yet it was the one song from the four singles released from the episode to chart in North America , and debuted on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100 . 
 Upon its initial airing , this episode was viewed by 6 @.@ 09 million American viewers and received a 2 @.@ 5 / 8 Nielsen rating / share in the 18 – 49 demographic . The total viewership was down significantly from " Prom @-@ asaurus " the week before . 
 = = Plot = = 
 When New Directions starts planning a setlist for the impending Nationals competition , Tina ( Jenna Ushkowitz ) is frustrated that Rachel ( Lea Michele ) is again singing lead while she remains stuck in the background , and walks out . When Rachel tries to bribe her to withdraw her objections , she tells Rachel that she wants to experience a standing ovation of her own . Tina later falls into a fountain and strikes her head , which causes her to experience a vision in which all of the glee club members have switched roles , — most notably , she sees herself as Rachel and Rachel as Tina . " Rachel " performs " Because You Loved Me " , and the club gives her a standing ovation . She thanks " Tina " for her support , and " Tina " in turn gives " Rachel " advice on how to salvage her failed NYADA audition . After Tina comes back to reality , she conveys that advice : Rachel should see NYADA dean Carmen Tibideaux ( Whoopi Goldberg ) in person — she is conducting a master class at Oberlin . Tina drives Rachel there , but Carmen has been annoyed by Rachel 's repeated messages and says she does not deserve any special attention . Tina disagrees , telling Carmen that although Rachel wants whatever she can gets and is " a pain in the ass " , but retorts that Rachel gets it all because she is exceptional . Rachel invites Carmen to attend their Nationals performance , and pledges to audition for NYADA every year until she is accepted . 
 Sue ( Jane Lynch ) announces that rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline is the team to beat , thanks mostly to its transgender lead singer Wade " Unique " Adams ( Alex Newell ) , who has become a media star . Sue decides that New Directions needs a similar gimmick to win and she tells Kurt ( Chris Colfer ) to dress in drag , but he adamantly refuses . Puck ( Mark Salling ) dons a dress and volunteers to lead the drag number , but Will vetoes the gimmickry and refocuses the group on its choreography . 
 Santana ( Naya Rivera ) , Brittany ( Heather Morris ) , and Mercedes ( Amber Riley ) are worried because Coach Beiste ( Dot @-@ Marie Jones ) has not left her abusive husband , Cooter ( Eric Bruskotter ) , as she claimed . Beiste tells them that adult relationships are more complex and insists she is fine . Hockey player Rick " The Stick " ( Rock Anthony ) ridicules Puck for being seen in the dress ; they agree to a fight outside the school . Rick gains the upper hand and Puck is thrown into a dumpster , but he emerges brandishing a switchblade . Coach Beiste breaks up the fight ; in the locker room , Puck tells her that the knife is a fake stage prop , and she retorts that he could have gotten expelled . Puck replies that he is flunking out anyway and a failure , telling her that she does not know what it feels like to be worthless . He breaks down , and Beiste comforts him as he cries . At home , Beiste tells Cooter that she is leaving him , and removes her wedding ring . He asks who else would love her ; she answers : " Me " . Back at the school auditorium , she joins Puck in singing " Mean " , tells him that she has arranged for him to retake a crucial test to graduate , and promises to help him pass . As the episode ends , Rachel and Tina sing " Flashdance ... What a Feeling " , and board the glee club 's bus to Nationals . 
 = = Production = = 
 This episode was written by Glee co @-@ creator Ian Brennan , who also made his directorial debut in this episode . While the first scenes for the episode were shot on March 30 , 2012 , on a day that also saw scenes shot for the previous two episodes , shooting on the episode began in earnest on Monday , April 9 , 2012 , after the completion of the prior episode at the end of the week before . Filming continued into the following week at least through Wednesday , April 18 , 2012 , by which point the next episode had begun shooting in parallel . 
 The plot has Tina suffering a " mild " head injury — she falls into a fountain — that causes her to see an alternate reality version of New Directions : actors playing club members had to swap roles with another actor in the cast . Chris Colfer , who normally plays Kurt Hummel , said that the portrayals " were really hard to nail — they 're not over the top by any means " . Pairs who are swapping roles include Tina and Rachel , Kurt and Finn ( Cory Monteith ) , Mike ( Harry Shum , Jr . ) and Joe ( Samuel Larsen ) , Puck and Blaine ( Darren Criss ) , Artie ( Kevin McHale ) and Santana , Quinn ( Dianna Agron ) and Sugar ( Vanessa Lengies ) , Rory ( Damian McGinty ) and Sam ( Chord Overstreet ) , Mercedes and Brittany , and Will and Sue . 
 In addition to those mentioned above , other recurring roles include football coach Shannon Beiste ( Jones ) and her husband , football recruiter Cooter Menkins ( Bruskotter ) , and Newell as Vocal <unk> lead singer Wade " Unique " Adams . Special guest star Whoopi Goldberg returns for a second appearance as NYADA dean Carmen Tibideaux . 
 Four songs from the episode were released in the US as singles available for digital download : Taylor Swift 's " Mean " performed by Jones and Salling , Jason Mraz 's " I Won 't Give Up " performed by Michele , Irene Cara 's " Flashdance ... What a Feeling " performed by Michele and Ushkowitz , and Celine Dion 's " Because You Loved Me " performed by Ushkowitz as Rachel . " I Won 't Give Up " is also featured on the soundtrack album Glee : The Music , The Graduation Album . A fifth song , an excerpt of " Always True to You in My Fashion " from Kiss Me Kate , is performed by an unnamed male student ( Derek L. Butler ) singing in a master class for Carmen ; it was not released as a single .

 The episode received mostly positive reviews . John Kubicek of BuddyTV called it " easily my favorite episode of the past two seasons , and quite possibly one of the best episodes the show has ever made " . Damian Holbrook of TV Guide described it and the episode that followed , " Nationals " , as " clever , funny and filled with moments that felt like little gifts to the fans who have hung in there " . Houston Chronicle 's Bobby Hankinson said the " double feature continued the recent hot streak " of episodes , and Michael Slezak of TVLine highlighted this episode 's " script that <unk> acknowledged fan complaints that Ryan Murphy & Co. all too often ignore some of Glee 's original players in favor of new and more @-@ hyped flavors " . The A.V. Club 's Todd VanDerWerff wrote that it showcased writer and director Ian Brennan 's " strengths of acid comedy and sad stories of small @-@ town teenagers who 'll never get anything but to sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream " ; he gave " Props " a " B " grade . Rae Votta of Billboard said , " It felt organically Glee , zany but with heart . " 
 E ! Online 's Jenna Mullins thought the body @-@ swap sequence " breathed fresh ' n ' crazy air into Glee " , and Kubicek called it " the best thing Glee has ever done and will ever do " . <unk> Saskin of MTV said it was " super trippy , makes no sense plot @-@ wise " and was a " totally awesome Glee moment " ; Entertainment Weekly 's Erin Strecker wrote that " the entire cast deserved an MVP award for their completely on @-@ point mannerisms " , and singled out " Finn and Puck all <unk> together , holding hands and dressed up like Kurt and Blaine " . VanDerWerff , however , described it as a " totally odd curiosity that comes out of nowhere " , and said that the car trip taken by Tina and Rachel later in the episode was more successful at showing Tina " what Rachel 's life is like " . Kubicek called the offer of the trip and subsequent drive a " sweet bonding moment " between the pair , and called it " great " that " Tina is the one who saves the day " at the meeting with Carmen , but Chaney wondered why it took Rachel two episodes to regain her drive and aspirations . 
 The scenes with Puck and Beiste were much praised , as were the actors . While reviewers such as Bell and VanDerWerff criticized the domestic abuse storyline , both were far happier with the way it was ended than with how it had been introduced in " Choke " — VanDerWerff wrote that " the fact that both Puck and Beiste 's storylines resolve at the same time in the same scene is a nice piece of writing , with some strong acting " . Votta called the pair 's scenes " delightful " and thought they merited a " road trip adventure spin @-@ off " ; Bell said that she " could have seriously watched an hour dedicated to Beiste and Puck " . Slezak highlighted " terrific work " by Jones and Salling , and the scenes with " Beiste holding a sobbing Puck " and confronting Cooter as " pretty remarkable " . Strecker called the latter scene " painful to watch , in the best possible way " , and Bell described Salling 's performance in the former as " truly incredible " . 
 = = = Music and performances = = = 
 The musical performances were greeted with somewhat less enthusiasm than the episode as a whole , and given mixed to positive reviews . An example of this was the song 's opening number , " I Won 't Give Up " . Saskin wrote that " Rachel sings Jason Mraz , like everything else , beautifully " , while Rolling Stone 's Erica Futterman credits her for having made a " sappy ballad mildly more tolerable " . Strecker gave the performance a " B + " grade and called it a " classic Berry power ballad " ; " B " grades were given by Slezak and Washington Post 's Jen Chaney , who also noted Rachel 's " vocal power " . 
 " Because You Loved Me " performed by Tina as Rachel received the most consistently positive reviews , though both Chaney , who gave the song an " A − " , and Strecker , who graded it a " B + " , stated their belief that the real Rachel would have done it better , and Saskin was more blunt : " We love you , Tina , but you just can 't belt like Rachel " . Futterman was the most pleased , and wrote : " The richness of her voice removes some of the Lite FM softness embedded in the tune , and it really is great to see Tina get a song that suits her vocal abilities " . 
 The most divergent views were expressed about Puck and Beiste 's performance of " Mean " . Crystal Bell of Huffington Post asked , " How could you not be moved by their duet in the auditorium ? " E ! Online 's Jenna Mullins called it " one of the highlights of the season " , and Slezak gave it a grade of " A " . Chaney 's " B + " followed her statement that " it was more effective than Swift 's version because I can believe that both Puck and Beiste have had it rough " , and Strecker described it as " lovely and thematically perfect " and gave it a " B " . VanDerWerff said he " could have done without " their duet , and Futterman was even harsher : " it was quite unfortunate " . Houston Chronicle 's Bobby Hankinson wrote that he " sort of liked " how the pair were " simultaneously improving upon and butchering a Taylor Swift song " , and Saskin characterized it as " heartfelt and passionate " . 
 Futterman said of " Flashdance ... What a Feeling " that " there was a glimmer of old @-@ school Glee in the performance , carefree underdog status that made me smile " . Saskin and Chaney both found the performance lacking ; the former wrote that " something about this version falls flat " , and Chaney gave it a " B − " and said it " wasn 't as soaring as it could have been " , though " Rachel and Tina 's bonding moment was sweet " and she liked " the way it took us from hour one into hour two and Nationals " . Slezak and Strecker both gave the performance an " A − " .

 Richard Marshall Eakin ( pronounced AY @-@ kin ; May 5 , 1910 – November 25 , 1999 ) , was an American zoologist and professor at the University of California , Berkeley , widely known for portraying prominent historical scientists during some of his lectures ; dressing in costume and speaking in character to entertain and inform his students . A 1953 Guggenheim fellow , he wrote several books and more than 200 scientific papers . His research focused on eyes and vision in animals , especially the parietal eye or " third eye " of vertebrates , as well as animal embryology . He served as chairman of the UC Berkeley Department of Zoology for over 10 years , was elected president of the Western Society of Naturalists and American Society of Zoologists , and was a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences . 
 Eakin was born in Florence , Colorado , and grew up in Tulsa , Oklahoma . He initially studied at the University of Tulsa , planning a career in the clergy , before switching to zoology , earning a bachelor 's degree and doctorate at UC Berkeley . After postdoctoral studies in Germany under Hans Spemann he returned to UC Berkeley as a faculty member , where he would teach for over 40 years , earning awards and recognition for his teaching before retiring with highest faculty honors .

He initially planned to go into the clergy , enrolling in the University of Tulsa and studying subjects such as theology and Greek for two years , before deciding to pursue zoology . 
 In 1929 , Eakin moved to Berkeley , California to attend UC Berkeley . He earned his A.B. in 1931 , then enrolled in graduate school under J. Franklin Daniel , an ichthyologist and embryologist . For his dissertation , Eakin studied the development of salamander and frog embryos , earning a PhD in zoology in 1935 . From 1935 to 1936 he worked in Germany as a postdoctoral scholar in the laboratories of <unk> Otto Mangold and Nobel laureate Hans Spemann . 
 On August 8 , 1935 , Eakin married Mary Mulford , daughter of Walter Mulford , a Berkeley professor of forestry .
