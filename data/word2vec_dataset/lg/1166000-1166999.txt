 = Leviathan ( roller coaster ) = 
 Leviathan / <unk> / is a steel roller coaster in the Medieval Faire section of the park at Canada 's Wonderland in Vaughan , Ontario , Canada . It is the first roller coaster made by Swiss manufacturer Bolliger & Mabillard to exceed a height of 300 feet ( 91 m ) , putting it in a class of roller coasters commonly referred to as giga . At 5 @,@ 486 feet ( 1 @,@ 672 m ) long , 306 feet ( 93 m ) tall , and with a top speed of 92 miles per hour ( 148 km / h ) , Leviathan is the tallest and fastest roller coaster in Canada . As of 2015 , Leviathan is ranked as the eighth @-@ tallest , and the eighth @-@ fastest roller coaster in the world , and the third @-@ tallest traditional lift @-@ style coaster in the world . It was the 16th roller coaster to be built at Canada 's Wonderland , and the ride 's track was completed in February 2012 , with the first test run being completed on 15 March 2012 . The coaster opened to season pass holders on 27 April 2012 , and to the general public on 6 May 2012 . 
 = = History = = 
 In the early planning stages of Leviathan , had Bolliger & Mabillard declined to make a roller coaster over 300 feet ( 91 m ) , the park would have gotten another manufacturer to design the roller coaster . Walter Bolliger admitted that he " owed " the park , as an inverted roller coaster could not be built several years earlier because of an exclusivity clause . 
 Speculation about a new roller coaster at Canada 's Wonderland began in early 2011 , when construction work started around the Dragon Fire ride and the Go <unk> . On 3 July 2011 , Canada 's Wonderland launched a teaser website featuring a countdown clock to 18 August 2011 , 7 : 00 <unk> accessible through the park 's Facebook page . The website also featured quotations from online theme park reporters and Cedar Fair 's CEO . 
 = = = Announcement and construction = = = 
 Canada 's Wonderland announced Leviathan at 7 : 00 am on 18 August 2011 , and the ride was also announced live on Breakfast Television Toronto . Erection of the track began during the week of 11 September 2011 ; the brake @-@ run and station portions of track were completed by the end of September . 
 On 18 October 2011 , the coaster 's longest and heaviest lift hill track piece , standing at 120 feet ( 37 m ) long , was installed . By mid – November the lift hill and drop were finished and the overbank turn was nearing completion . Construction continued through December and January , and the track was completed on 7 February 2012 . The first test run was completed on 15 March 2012 , and on 18 April 2012 , Canada 's Wonderland announced on its Facebook account that a 100 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) tunnel would be placed at the bottom of the ride 's first drop .

 On 19 January 2012 , Canada 's Wonderland launched an auction in which bidders around the world competed to be one of the first ninety @-@ six public riders on Leviathan on 27 April 2012 , a week before the park officially opened . The auction raised over CA $ 40 @,@ 000 , which was donated to the Hospital for Sick Children . The highest bid in the auction for a single seat was $ 1 @,@ 000 . When bidders got to ride the roller <unk> , the tunnel at the bottom of the first drop was not yet installed . 
 = = Ride experience = = 
 As of 2016 , Leviathan is Bolliger & Mabillard 's second tallest roller coaster and the company 's first giga coaster – a class of roller coasters with a height or drop that exceeds 300 feet ( 91 m ) . One cycle of the ride lasts about 3 minutes and 28 seconds . 
 = = = Layout = = = 
 After leaving the station , the train turns 180 degrees to the right , then begins to climb the chain lift hill . Once at the top of the 306 @-@ foot ( 93 m ) lift , it drops to the ground at an 80 @-@ degree angle , reaching 92 miles per hour ( 148 km / h ) . Following the first drop , the train goes through a 100 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) tunnel , then curves upwards into a 164 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 50 m ) overbanked banked turn to the right before dropping again and turning at high speed turn to the left at approximately 76 miles per hour ( 122 km / h ) . The exit of the first high speed turn leads directly into a 183 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 56 m ) camelback , followed by a 147 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 45 m ) , 115 @-@ degree hammerhead turn . Both of these elements are located above the guest parking lot and in front of the park 's main entrance . After leaving the hammerhead turn , the train enters a second high @-@ speed curve at approximately 60 miles per hour ( 97 km / h ) . The train then traverses a smaller , 124 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 38 m ) camelback , leading to a third high @-@ speed turn which bends to the left and leads into the brake run and into the station . 
 = = = Trains = = = 
 Leviathan operates with three open @-@ air steel and fibreglass trains coloured red , orange and yellow , respectively . The face of Leviathan , a theme element , covers the front of the trains . Each train has eight cars with four seats per car , which are styled after Bolliger & Mabillard 's traditional hyper coaster cars , as opposed to the staggered seating used on Behemoth . Each train seats 32 riders , who are restrained using <unk> and seatbelts . 
 = = = Track = = = 
 The steel track of Leviathan is over a mile long at 5 @,@ 486 feet ( 1 @,@ 672 m ) , the height of the lift hill is 306 feet ( 93 m ) , and the angle of the first descent is approximately 80 degrees . The color of the track is cyan , and its supports are blue . Unlike the two Intamin giga coasters ( Millennium Force at Cedar Point and Intimidator 305 at Kings Dominion ) , Leviathan only uses a single chain for the lift hill . 
 = = = Station and plaza = = = 
 Leviathan 's station has an elevator near the exit , wooden guard rails with slanted railings and two queues , one of which is the Fast Lane queue for pass holders . In front of the station is a rock fountain with a sculpture of a Leviathan on top . To the right of the sculpture , there is an arcade building that was renovated during the construction of the roller coaster . Unlike most of the park 's attractions , Leviathan has its own gift shop .

 = The Boat Race 1890 = 
 The 47th Boat Race took place in 1890 . Held annually , it is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . The race , umpired by former Oxford rower Frank Willan ) was won by Oxford . They passed the finishing post one length ahead of Cambridge in a time of 22 minutes 3 seconds , and took their overall lead in the event to 24 – 22 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the boat clubs of University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities ; as of 2014 it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide . Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having beaten Oxford by seven lengths in the previous year 's race , while Oxford held the overall lead , with 23 victories to Cambridge 's 22 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 Oxford 's coaches were F. P. Bully , F. Fenner , William Grenfell ( who rowed for Oxford in the 1877 and 1878 races , and was non @-@ rowing boat club president in the 1879 race ) and Frederick Smith , 2nd Viscount Hambleden . There is no record of who coached Cambridge . The Light Blues began their practice on 9 January , nearly two weeks ahead of Oxford , but it was not until 4 March that Cambridge persuaded James Cardwell Gardner to return as stroke . They improved and were considered by author and former Oxford rower George Drinkwater to be " by no means a bad crew , though deficient in length and <unk> " . Despite William Fletcher being considered " one of the greatest sixes " , and although " no greater worker has ever rowed " , he was positioned at stroke . 
 The umpire for the race for the second year in a row was Frank Willan who won the event four consecutive times , rowing for Oxford in the 1866 , 1867 , 1868 and 1869 races . 
 = = Crews = = 
 Both crews weighed an average of 12 st 1 @.@ 5 lb ( 76 @.@ 7 kg ) . Cambridge saw three former Blues return , including Stanley Muttlebury who was rowing in his fifth consecutive Boat Race . Oxford 's crew contained five rowers with experience of the event , including W. F. C. Holland in his fourth race , along with the cox John Pemberton Heywood @-@ Lonsdale who had steered the Dark Blues in 1889 . 
 = = Race = = 
 Cambridge were considered slight favourites for the race , and won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station , handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford . While the weather was fine , a westerly wind made for rough conditions between Hammersmith Bridge and Barnes Bridge . Commencing at <unk> , Cambridge made the faster start , outrating the Dark Blues by two strokes per minute , and held a quarter @-@ of @-@ a @-@ length lead after two minutes . Despite the bend of the river favouring Oxford , the Light Blues held their lead and at the Crab Tree pub , began to pull further ahead as the course favoured them . 
 By Hammersmith Bridge , the lead was half @-@ a @-@ length but the wind appeared to affect Oxford and by The Doves pub , Cambridge were nearly clear . Oxford reduced the deficit along Chiswick Reach and by Chiswick Steps were nearly level . In more sheltered water , the Dark Blues pushed ahead and were almost clear by Barnes Bridge but Cambridge kept in touch . Oxford passed the finishing post with a lead of one length in a time of 22 minutes 3 seconds . It was Oxford 's first victory since the 1885 race , their narrowest winning margin for 23 years and the slowest winning time for either university since the 1878 race . 
 = Interstate 196 = 
 Interstate 196 ( I @-@ 196 ) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway that runs for 80 @.@ 594 miles ( 129 @.@ 703 km ) in the US state of Michigan . It is a state trunkline highway that links Benton Harbor , South Haven , Holland , and Grand Rapids together . In Kent , Ottawa , and Allegan counties , I @-@ 196 is known as the Gerald R. Ford Freeway , or simply the Ford Freeway , after the 38th President of the United States , Gerald Ford , who was raised in Grand Rapids and served Michigan in the House of Representatives . This name generally refers only to the section between Holland and Grand Rapids . I @-@ 196 changes direction ; it is signed as a north – south highway from its southern terminus to the junction with US Highway 31 ( US 31 ) just south of Holland , and as an east – west trunkline from this point to its eastern terminus at an interchange with I @-@ 96 , its parent highway . There are currently three business routes related to the main freeway . There are two business loops ( BL I @-@ 196 ) and one business spur ( BS I @-@ 196 ) that serve South Haven , Holland and the Grand Rapids areas . Another business spur for Muskegon had been designated relative to the I @-@ 196 number . 
 The current freeway numbered I @-@ 196 is the second in the state to bear the number . Originally to be numbered as part of the I @-@ 94 corridor in the state , the Benton Harbor – Grand Rapids freeway was given the I @-@ 96 number in the 1950s while another Interstate between Muskegon and Grand Rapids was numbered I @-@ 196 . That I @-@ 196 was built in the late 1950s and completed in the early 1960s . The first segment of the current I @-@ 196 was opened as I @-@ 96 near Benton Harbor in 1962 . Michigan officials requested a change in 1963 , which reversed the two numbers and the subsequent segments of freeway opened northward to Holland and from Grand Rapids westward under the current number . The gap between Holland and Grandville was filled in the 1970s , and a section of freeway that runs through downtown Grand Rapids was rebuilt as a wider freeway in 2010 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Like other state highways in Michigan , I @-@ 196 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) . In 2011 , the department 's traffic surveys showed that on average , 77 @,@ 500 vehicles used the highway daily between Lane Avenue and US 131 in Grand Rapids and 12 @,@ 778 vehicles did so each day north of the split with US 31 near Holland . These are the highest and lowest counts along the highway , respectively . As an Interstate Highway , all of I @-@ 196 is listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . In addition , the highway has been named by the Michigan Legislature the Gerald R. Ford Freeway to honor the 38th President of the United States . The original legislation from 1974 extended that name to the full length of the freeway , but when the various memorial highway names were re @-@ codified in 2001 , the name was not applied to the Berrien County segment . From the junction with M @-@ 63 north to the split with US 31 except for the section that connects the ends of the South Haven business loop , the freeway is also a part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour ( LMCT ) , a tourist route that follows Lake Michigan . 
 = = = Benton Harbor to Holland = = = 
 The freeway starts northeast of Benton Harbor at exit 34 on I @-@ 94 in Benton Charter Township in Berrien County . At the trumpet interchange , I @-@ 196 runs north from I @-@ 94 and passes to the west of the Point O <unk> Golf & Country Club . US 31 joins I @-@ 196 from the southwest and runs concurrently with I @-@ 196 as the freeway passes through farm fields in southwestern Michigan . The trunkline turns northwesterly near the Lake Michigan Hills Golf Course and crosses the Paw Paw River . Past the river , the freeway turns northeasterly and runs roughly parallel to the Lake Michigan shoreline several miles inland . At the community of Lake Michigan Beach , I @-@ 196 / US 31 meets the northern terminus of M @-@ 63 at exit 7 , and the LMCT joins the freeway for the first time . North of this interchange , the freeway parallels A @-@ 2 , a county road that follows the Blue Star Highway , the former route of US 31 . 
 A bit further north , I @-@ 196 / US 31 crosses into Van Buren County and assumes the Gerald R. Ford Freeway name . The inland side of the freeway is forested while the <unk> side is predominantly either forest or fields . As it approaches South Haven , the freeway passes near the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station and Van Buren State Park . North of the power plant and park , the freeway turns farther inland to bypass the city of South Haven . There is an interchange on the south side of town that provides access to Business Loop I @-@ 196 ( BL I @-@ 196 ) and M @-@ 140 . The freeway crosses over M @-@ 43 without an interchange and then intersects the other end of the business loop about two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) later . It crosses the Black River near the Van Buren – Allegan county line . 
 In Allegan County , I @-@ 196 / US 31 passes a pair of golf courses and continues northward through farm fields . Near the community of Glenn , A @-@ 2 crosses over the freeway and runs parallel to it on the east . They trade places again when I @-@ 196 / US 31 turns northeasterly on the south side of the twin cities of Saugatuck and Douglas . The freeway crosses over a section of Kalamazoo Lake , a wider section of the Kalamazoo River that flows between the two towns . A @-@ 2 crosses back to the eastern side of the freeway north of Saugatuck , and I @-@ 196 / US 31 continues north @-@ northeasterly toward Holland . 
 = = = Holland to Grand Rapids = = = 
 On the south side of Holland , the two highways split apart ; US 31 separates from I @-@ 196 at a partial interchange near the West Michigan Regional Airport ( formerly the Tulip City Airport ) . At this interchange , northbound traffic may follow a left exit to continue on the BL I @-@ 196 / US 31 freeway or continue along I @-@ 196 which turns more eastward ; the LMCT departs I @-@ 196 at this point as well . Signage along I @-@ 196 changes after this interchange . Up to this point , it had been signed north – south , but from the US 31 split onward , the directions are now signed east – west . The freeway passes to the south side of the airport , and it crosses a rail line owned by CSX Transportation and used by Amtrak 's Pere Marquette train before curving northeasterly through the interchange with M @-@ 40 . The freeway crosses into Ottawa County south of the <unk> River before meeting the other two interchanges for Holland , the second of which is the northern end of the business loop in Zeeland . 
 Continuing past Zeeland , I @-@ 196 runs more east @-@ northeasterly as it parallels M @-@ 121 ( Chicago Drive ) . The freeway passes to the south side of Hudsonville and intersects A @-@ 37 . About two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) past Hudsonville , the trunkline has an interchange with M @-@ 6 , a freeway that runs along the south side of the Grand Rapids area . Just past this interchange , the freeway crosses into Kent County at the <unk> Avenue overpass . Now in the city of Grandville , I @-@ 196 turns northward to run parallel to the county line . The freeway has an interchange for 44th Street , which provides access to the <unk> Crossings mall and other retail and restaurant establishments in the area . At exit 69 , I @-@ 196 crosses Chicago Drive and the rail line and turns northeasterly next to Jenison , an unincorporated community opposite the Kent – Ottawa county line . The Ford Freeway name is now prominently used on the freeway signage as I @-@ 196 follows a section of the Grand River . Past the interchange for M @-@ 11 ( 28th Street ) , the freeway crosses into the suburb of Wyoming . 
 In Wyoming , the freeway runs along the river , passing Millennium Park on the opposite banks in Walker and Hopewell Indian Mounds Park on the near banks . To the south of the freeway , the business spur for Wyoming and Grand Rapids departs to follow Chicago Drive near an industrial area . After the interchange for Market Avenue , I @-@ 196 crosses the Grand River and enters the city of Grand Rapids . The freeway meanders northward past the transmission antennas for radio stations <unk> and <unk> and around the west side of the John Ball Zoological Garden . The trunkline has an interchange with M @-@ 45 ( Lake Michigan Drive ) on the north side of the zoo before I @-@ 196 runs downhill turning eastward . 
 At the bottom of the hill , I @-@ 196 enters the urban core of Grand Rapids . The freeway runs eastward through residential neighborhoods on the city 's west side as it approaches the interchange with US 131 . This complex structure is adjacent to the Grand River north of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum . The carriageways for I @-@ 196 run through the interchange on different levels , with the eastbound traffic carried down near river level and the westbound lanes above the criss @-@ crossing carriageways of US 131 's freeway . I @-@ 196 crosses the river on the opposite side of the interchange and both directions return to the same level . The freeway picks up an additional lane at this point as the median is replaced by a concrete barrier . 
 As the freeway runs eastward , it passes the area of Grand Rapids known as the " Medical Mile " , a district anchored by the Van Andel Institute , Helen DeVos Children 's Hospital , a campus of the Michigan State University College of Human Medicine and the Butterworth Hospital campus of Spectrum Health . The Ford Freeway jogs slightly to the northeast as it crosses a line of the Grand Rapids Eastern Railroad between College and Eastern avenues . It then passes to the south of the offices buildings that house the Kent County Health Department , the Sheriff 's Department and the animal shelter . A little over a mile and a quarter ( 2 @.@ 0 km ) east of those offices , I @-@ 196 meets its parent highway , I @-@ 96 on the east side of the city . This interchange marks the eastern terminus of the Ford Freeway and I @-@ 196 .

 = = = Previous designation = = = 
 In the first tentative Interstate numbering plans , the freeways in Michigan now numbered I @-@ 96 and I @-@ 196 were supposed to be part of the I @-@ 94 corridor , and the freeway between Muskegon and Grand Rapids was to be I @-@ 94N . Later , the initial approvals by the federal government routed I @-@ 96 from Benton Harbor north to Grand Rapids and then east to Detroit , and I @-@ 196 was the spur route from Grand Rapids to Muskegon . The first segment of freeway built was a relocated section of US 16 near Coopersville and Marne . The freeway opened at the end of 1957 or in early 1958 , and the first markers for I @-@ 196 were erected in 1959 . The full Grand Rapids – Muskegon I @-@ 196 freeway was completed and opened to traffic in December 1962 , connecting to an I @-@ 96 freeway that led east toward Lansing ; the US 16 corridor was a continuous freeway with two different Interstate designations . Before the Grand Rapids – Benton Harbor segment was completed , the Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) , predecessor to the modern MDOT , petitioned federal highway officials to switch the Interstate designations west of Grand Rapids . Permission for this switch was granted in 1963 . Consideration was also made to name the Grand Rapids – Benton Harbor freeway I @-@ 67 . The previously completed I @-@ 196 was redesignated as an extension of I @-@ 96 , and the completed freeway segments southwest of Grand Rapids were redesignated I @-@ 196 ; I @-@ 67 was rejected by the American Association of State Highway Officials . 
 = = = Current designation = = = 
 In 1962 , a section of freeway along US 31 was opened between I @-@ 94 and the Berrien – Van Buren county line . This section was originally designated as part of I @-@ 96 / US 31 . After the designation switch in 1963 , an additional 35 miles ( 56 km ) was opened from the northern end of I @-@ 196 near Benton <unk> to Holland as I @-@ 196 . An additional section of freeway was opened between Grandville through downtown Grand Rapids to meet I @-@ 96 at the end of 1964 . M @-@ 21 was moved to the freeway from its previous surface @-@ street routing . The final link in the freeway was completed in November 1974 along the Holland – Grandville segment , completing I @-@ 196 for a second time . At the same time , M @-@ 21 was removed from the freeway , truncating that highway designation to end in Grand Rapids . 
 In 2009 , access to Jenison was improved by the addition of a partial interchange with Baldwin Street . The section through downtown Grand Rapids east of the Grand River was rebuilt during 2010 in a project MDOT dubbed the " Fix on I @-@ 196 " . The project added a third travel lane in each direction with weave @-@ merge lanes between interchanges and rebuilt several of the overpasses in the area .

 Business Loop I @-@ 196 ( BL I @-@ 196 ) is a loop that runs for 11 @.@ 649 miles ( 18 @.@ 747 km ) in Holland and Zeeland . The loop starts at a connection with I @-@ 196 / US 31 at exit 44 and continues concurrently along the freeway into Holland . BL I @-@ 196 / US 31 has an interchange for A @-@ 2 ( Blue Star Highway ) and Washington Avenue before the freeway ends in the southern reaches of Holland . The trunkline then runs as a divided highway northward , bypassing downtown Holland to the east and intersecting M @-@ 40 . Northeast of downtown , BL I @-@ 196 leaves US 31 and the LMCT at an interchange to follow an expressway along the route of Chicago Drive . The loop follows this expressway through Zeeland and back out to I @-@ 196 at exit 55 . 
 The loop was created in 1974 when I @-@ 196 was completed south of the city of Holland . From that point , the old route of M @-@ 21 inside the cities to US 31 was redesignated as a business loop of I @-@ 196 with the state taking control of Washington Avenue to the downtown area . Then from downtown looping back up to Chicago Drive , the business loop used the old M @-@ 21 . Along Washington Avenue and Chicago Drive between junctions with US 31 , the highway bore a concurrent Bus . US 31 designation . The concurrent trunkline inside the downtown area of Holland was transferred to the City of Holland in 2005 , and BL I @-@ 196 was rerouted to follow US 31 .

 John Warne Gates ( May 18 , 1855 – August 9 , 1911 ) , also known as " Bet @-@ a @-@ Million " Gates , was an American Gilded Age industrialist , who was a pioneer promoter of barbed wire . He was born and raised in what is now West Chicago , Illinois . He did not enjoy farm life and began offering neighbors various business propositions at an early age , including the sale of firewood to homes and to the local railroad . When he started a local grain brokerage that failed , Gates began spending time at the local railroad station and became reacquainted with the men he previously sold firewood to . He was invited to join their poker games and through this , Gates ' aptitude for cards and other games of chance was developed . 
 After studying penmanship , bookkeeping and business law in North Central College ( by then Northwestern College ) , he failed as an owner of a local hardware store . Gates became interested in barbed wire and became a salesman for the Washburn @-@ Moen Company . When he was assigned to the Texas sales territory , he learned that ranchers were adamant about not buying his product . Gates staged a demonstration of the wire in San Antonio 's Military Plaza with charging cattle failing to break the barbed wire fences he had set up . He then proved very successful in selling the company 's product , and went on to start his own barbed wire manufacturing business , which eventually led to the production of steel . In the process , his company was purchased by J. P. Morgan 's U. S. Steel . Gates was not invited to become part of the company , and he fought back at Morgan for many years through a series of business acquisitions and sales ; both men were key figures in the Panic of 1907 . 
 Gates was the president of Republic Steel and of the Texas Company , later known as Texaco . He was instrumental in changing the steel industry 's production methods from the Bessemer process to the open hearth process and in building the city of Port Arthur , Texas .

 = = = Early years = = = 
 Gates was born in West Chicago , Illinois ( then known as Turner Junction ) on May 18 , 1855 . He was the son of Asel A. and Mary Warne Gates . Gates had two older brothers , George and Gilbert , but both had died by the time he was 15 years old . While Gates was raised in a religious household , his mother , Mary , became more religious after the deaths of her two older sons . Because he had been involved in some harmless childhood mischief in both grammar and Sunday School , he was accused of stealing a collection at the Sunday School . He was barred from attending church as a result . 
 Gates was raised on the family 's farm , but did not care for farm life . At an early age , he entered into his first business proposition : to husk a neighbor 's corn . His next business venture was to clear some land of timber for another neighbor . Gates earned US $ 1 @,@ 000 for this job , selling the timber as firewood to homes and to the railroad . Gates then took the money from this labor and bought a half interest in a threshing machine . As this type of equipment was very new at the time , few farms owned one , so Gates and his partner hired themselves out to work with it at various local farms . After one season , Gates tired of this type of work and he sold his interest in the threshing machine to his partner and another friend . Gates then set himself up as a local grain broker , doing business from the family 's home . This business venture was a failure ; in an effort to escape farm work , he took to spending time at the railroad depot where he had previously sold firewood . The railroad men remembered him and now asked him to join their poker games . Gates found he had an aptitude for the game and for anticipating the cards men held and how they would play them . With the grain brokerage now forgotten , he was able to make up the losses at the card table . 
 While attending a house party near St. Charles , he met and fell in love with a farmer 's daughter , Dellora Baker . Gates proposed to her at one of the house parties . Dellora was willing to accept Gates ' proposal , but wondered how he would be able to provide for a wife , as his only income came from winning at the railroad poker games . When his father discovered Gates in a poker game with some railroad men in the family 's barn , Asel told his son he was no good and would never be any good . Only Mary 's mediation stopped her son from leaving home . With the realization that he needed more education than grammar school had provided , he announced to his parents that he would be enrolling in some local college classes . Gates attended some courses at nearby Wheaton College and graduated from North Central College in 1876 . He had little opportunity to put his new business education to work , as the financial Panic of 1873 began just as he was completing his college work . In order to be able to marry Dellora , Gates accepted every type of job he could get for the next year ; most of them were for farm work . Gates and Dellora were married on February 25 , 1874 . 
 = = = Marriage and early business ventures = = = 
 Gates tried to revive to his grain brokerage business but lost all his savings through it . When the couple 's first child was stillborn , Gates returned to his old pattern of playing poker and thought seriously about leaving town with Dellora . With this knowledge , Mary Gates told her husband he needed to help his son financially so he could start a new business . Gates ' father in law , Ed Baker , had already offered to help his daughter and son in law in this way . Asel purchased a two @-@ story brick building and Ed Baker provided the capital for stock to open a hardware store in Turner Junction . At first the business went well ; Gates and Dellora were able to move into their own home . Gates began taking time away from the hardware store and while his partner tried to handle all the business , he was not able to . A son , Charles Gilbert Gates , was born to Gates and Dellora on May 21 , 1876 . Gates began to complain of various ailments soon after the baby 's birth ; at times , he would take to his bed for some days with them . Business at the hardware store had become so bad , Gates was not able to afford the rent on the family 's home . They had to move into two rooms above the hardware store , with Gates saying he was too ill to help with the moving and packing . 
 While at the hardware store , Gates met a salesman who was in the barbed wire business . As a result , Gates became interested in the relatively new product . When he announced his intentions to sell his interest in the hardware store and become a traveling salesman for the product , his wife and mother were both in favor of the plan . He made a trip to San Antonio , Texas in 1876 where Isaac Ellwood hired him as a salesman for the Washburn @-@ Moen barbed wire company . After being assigned to work in Texas , Gates quickly learned that while he found friends and poker playing companions , when it came to selling barbed wire , ranchers were not buying . After watching a medicine show proprietor stage an elaborate presentation for his wares and noting that people fought to buy the products sold , Gates decided to have a similar production to demonstrate the merits of barbed wire . In San Antonio 's Military Plaza , Gates provoked cattle into charging into a barbed wire fence which did not break . Gates went from not being able to sell his product to not being able to fill orders quickly enough after the demonstration . 
 = = = The barbed wire and steel business = = = 
 Upon Ellwood 's refusal to grant him a partnership in the company . Gates traveled to St. Louis , Missouri , where in partnership with Alfred Clifford , he started the Southern Wire Company to compete with Washburn @-@ Moen . Clifford 's equipment to manufacture barbed wire had come from George C. Baker , who had invented a machine for producing barbed wire which was similar but not identical to the one made by Isaac Ellwood . Baker had resisted all attempts by Ellwood and Washburn @-@ Moen to buy him out . Gates and Clifford sold their product at a cheaper price than Washburn @-@ Moen . Before long , Washburn @-@ Moen was losing substantial business to Gates and Clifford 's Southern Wire Company . 
 In an effort to stop the success of the former company salesman , Ellwood and Washburn @-@ Moen filed for an injunction to stop the business of Southern Wire Company . The suit , filed in U. S. District Court , claimed the machines Gates and Clifford used in the production of their product were a direct copy of those used by Washburn @-@ Moen . The suit also called for Gates and Clifford to pay US $ 100 @,@ 000 in damages to the company . As they avoided process servers , Gates and Clifford made a plan to save their company . They were able to rent a building in East St. Louis , Illinois and moved their equipment out of the factory and onto a ferryboat after dark . After they crossed the Mississippi River , the machines were out of the jurisdiction of the St. Louis U. S. District Court and were back in business the next day . When Clifford and Gates hired an attorney to answer the charges made against them in court , the judge ruled that the manufacturing process used by Southern Wire Company was not an infringement on any patents or machinery owned by Ellwood and Washburn @-@ Moen . 
 After a fire destroyed the Southern Wire Company , Gates gambled on the idea that William Edenborn had not heard the news and approached him for a merger with the idea that Southern Wire would manufacture in Edenborn 's now idle barbed wire plant . The new company was known as St. Louis Wire Mill Company . They continued to buy other wire companies and had strong sales . Washburn @-@ Moen went back into court , this time in Des Moines , Iowa , where a federal judge ruled that the machinery created by Baker was an infringement of Washburn @-@ Moen 's patents . By this time , Gates had created a syndicate of barbed wire manufacturers who did not produce their wares using Washburn @-@ Moen 's methods ; the ruling in favor of Washburn @-@ Moen only applied to areas in the jurisdiction of the U. S. Federal Court in Des Moines . Washburn @-@ Moen continued to falter ; Isaac Ellwood sent word asking for a meeting with Gates . Ellwood and another key figure with Washburn @-@ Moen , John Lambert , now accepted offers from Gates . The barbed wire legal issues ended with Washburn @-@ Moen selling their patent rights to Gates and his syndicate of wire manufacturers . 
 Through a series of mergers and acquisitions the company went through various name changes , finally settling on American Steel and Wire Company . Gates and his family moved to Chicago , where they lived for a period of ten years . Chicago attorney Elbert Henry Gary had helped Gates form the syndicate which led to the defeat of Washburn @-@ Moen . Gary was called on again in 1901 to negotiate a merger with J. P. Morgan 's U. S. Steel . Though he had provided Gates with some loans and advice in the past , Morgan did not want Gates to be a part of the merged company , saying that there was only a deal without Gates . Morgan made an offer to Gates for the American Steel and Wire Company , telling him that he was not welcome to take part in the business of U. S. Steel @-@ either as part of management or on the company 's board of directors . Morgan continued by saying that if Gates did not accept his offer , U. S. Steel intended to build its own wire production plant . 
 = = = Railroads , oil and Port Arthur , Texas = = = 
 Gates never forgot J. P. Morgan 's snub at the U. S. Steel merger . One month after the deal was completed , he became involved in a struggle between E. H. Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad and James J. Hill of the Northern Pacific Railway . Both men sought control of the Chicago , Burlington and Quincy Railroad . Hill , who was financed by J. P. Morgan , needed access to Chicago ; Harriman was interested in stopping Hill from obtaining it . Gates saw this as an opportunity to get back at Morgan for his refusal to seat him on the board of U. S. Steel . Along with Harriman , he began buying shares of Northern Pacific stock . When James Hill noted a sudden rise in Northern Pacific stock prices , he traveled to New York to consult with Morgan . Morgan and Hill stopped the sales of the Northern Pacific stock , which remained high while other stocks took steep drops . Those who had been selling short could not obtain enough stock to cover themselves and were faced with large financial losses . It was rumored that Gates was short 60 @,@ 000 shares of Northern Pacific stock . Gates did not confirm or deny any of the rumors about the railroad stock and would only say that he was doing well . 
 As Gates continued to search for a way to get back at Morgan for cutting him out of U. S. Steel , he found a vulnerability in Morgan 's railroad holdings in 1902 and began buying large numbers of shares in Morgan 's Louisville and Nashville Railroad . When it was decided to add another short line to the L & N system , its board of directors voted to issue 50 @,@ 000 new shares of stock to finance the new line . A clerical error offered the stock for sale before it could be listed on the New York Stock Exchange . Gates saw the offering and purchased the shares prior to their listing ; he also continued buying all the Louisville and Nashville stock he was able to . Gates had enough shares of the railroad to duplicate the panic that ensued the year before with the Great Northern Railway shares . J. P. Morgan learned of the events in April 1902 and found that Gates now owned more than 51 percent of the Louisville and Nashville 's stock . Morgan decided to act to stop another Wall Street panic , and asked what Gates ' terms of sale would be . Gates wanted US $ 150 per share of stock , an offer which Morgan initially rejected . He then dispatched his aide , George Walbridge Perkins , to talk to Gates and make the best possible arrangements . Perkins called on Gates in his Waldorf @-@ Astoria suite at 1 : 30 am . The deal for the Louisville and Nashville cost Morgan US $ 43 million , with Gates making a more than US $ 15 million profit from the transaction . 
 After the Louisville and Nashville Railroad incident , Gates found that public opinion had turned against him as a result of it . Gates talked some associates into submitting his son 's name for membership in the New York Yacht Club and New York 's Union League Club . The application for Charlie Gates went from one desk to another for a number of weeks . When young Gates ' name was brought up for a vote , the members of the admissions committee were unanimous in their " no " decision . Gates threatened to sue the club and the members denied his charges of Morgan being behind Charlie Gates ' refusal . Gates withdrew Charlie 's Yacht Club and Union League Club applications , apparently resigned that his son would not be a member of either society . When he and Dellora traveled to England , the couple wanted to stay at Claridge 's , as they had done in 1900 . Claridge 's refused to accept their registration as Gates was now on the hotel 's list of undesirables . 
 Pattillo Higgins had begun a well on Spindletop in 1900 , but ran out of money to continue drilling for oil . Higgins went to Gates for funds to continue ; Gates obliged and founded The Texas Company , later known as Texaco . His investment entitled Gates to 46 percent of the company 's stock . When Spindletop came in the next year , Gates was already in control of Port Arthur 's docks , its refinery and the railroad needed to get the oil to market . 
 = = = = Port Arthur = = = = 
 Gates became influential in the development of the city of Port Arthur , Texas when he took over the Kansas City , Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad in December 1899 after he forced it into bankruptcy along with its previous owner and Port Arthur founder Arthur Edward Stilwell . Gates built a winter home in the city and contributed much to its development . After Gates became the owner of the Port Arthur Canal and Dock Company , he held the asset for a time ; in 1906 he gave the canal to the US government under the condition that Port Arthur would be named an international port of entry . Gates founded the first bank , built a rice mill and established the Port Arthur Light , Power and Ice Company . When he decided to make Port Arthur his permanent residence in 1908 , the town held a celebration . After Mary Gates died while on a visit to her son and his family in December 1908 , Gates built Mary Gates Hospital to honor her memory . He was also a large contributor to Port Arthur Business College , and built a model farm to give the city a source of fresh dairy products . 
 After Port Arthur 's Hotel Sabine burned to the ground in 1904 , Gates decided that the city needed a good hotel to replace it . In 1909 , he proposed to build another , called the Plaza , on the site the Hotel Sabine had once occupied . Gates could have easily afforded to finance the entire cost of the new hotel , but he wanted Port Arthur 's residents to have an equal share in the venture . Gates held local meetings and was happy to discuss the project or take pledges for the building fund at any time . After the pledges of local businessmen had reached US $ 150 @,@ 000 , Gates donated the remaining US $ 150 @,@ 000 , and the project began to be built by United States Realty Company . 
 Gates took great pleasure in watching the Plaza Hotel take shape . He was a daily visitor to the construction site as the Spanish mission style building was erected . When the hotel was opened , Gates held a special " billion dollar banquet " on November 15 , 1909 ; his guests were men who owned railroads , Texas Company board members , and other successful men in business . Port Arthur had never seen so many wealthy and powerful men and residents were impressed by the sight of them . Gates served as the hotel 's manager in the first few weeks it was in operation . He hired African @-@ Americans as waiters ; this was considered to be very bold , as African @-@ Americans were barred from living and working in the city at the time . 
 = = = The steel industry and dashed hopes = = = 
 Gates continued to have hopes of being able to take on J. P. Morgan again @-@ this time with a rival steel trust . After the sale of his Louisville and Nashville Railroad stocks to Morgan in 1902 , Gates quietly began buying shares of Colorado Fuel and Iron Company . He and his associates easily owned more than 50 percent of the company 's stock shares , but the company 's owner and founder , John C. Osgood , claimed the shares were not valid . Osgood said that while the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange , any transfer of the shares without his signature and approval , made them invalid . He went on to say that because of their invalidity , those who held shares of the company 's stock without them , were not eligible to attend the annual stockholders ' meeting . Osgood was upheld in this opinion by the company 's board of directors . 
 Determined to attend the meeting , Gates hired a special train to get to the meeting in Denver . John Osgood was prepared for Gates ' arrival . He had obtained a Circuit Court injunction barring Gates and his associates from attending the meeting ; the doors of Colorado Fuel and Iron were guarded by sheriff 's deputies armed with shotguns . Gates was angry about being refused entry to the meeting , but he became enraged when he learned he was described in the local Circuit Court as a " high roller and a gambler " . Gates returned to New York to try utilizing the Federal Court system there . As the legal wrangles continued , the stock of the company began dropping in value ; during this time Gates lost US $ 3 million , but still was unsure of his legal status with Colorado Fuel and Iron . Osgood announced he was willing to meet Gates halfway , but Gates declined the offer . He accused Osgood of tampering with the courts and claimed that he would receive the legal ownership of the company he was due . Apparently feeling that a long battle was not worth it , Gates gave up the fight some weeks later and sold the shares , which eventually wound up with the Rockefeller family . 
 Once more , Gates planned to get back into the steel industry . In 1903 , he began buying shares of Republic Steel . Its two main competitors were in the US South @-@ Tennessee Coal , Iron and Railroad Company , and the Sloss @-@ Sheffield Iron and Steel Company in Alabama . All three were able to use inexpensive Southern iron ore to produce quality steel with the open hearth process , making the price of the steel produced with it cheaper . The minerals needed for the open hearth process were readily found in Alabama . Gates envisioned bringing Republic , Tennessee Coal and Iron and Sloss @-@ Sheffield together into a steel trust to challenge J. P. Morgan 's U. S. Steel . When August Belmont , Jr. resigned his seat on Republic 's board to concentrate on consolidating the New York transit system , Gates was elected to fill Belmont 's seat . 
 Gates found two like @-@ minded members of the board when he began talking about consolidating the three steel companies . One was L. C. Hanna , the brother of Mark Hanna ; the other was Grant Schley , who had a Wall Street brokerage . Gates now began purchasing shares of Tennessee Coal and Iron in preparation of the consolidation . In January 1905 he was ready to outline his plan to potential members of the trust , with the exception of Republic 's president , A. W. Thompson . When Thompson was advised of the scheme , he declared there would be no such trust with Republic as a member ; when put to a formal vote , Republic 's board members voted down the idea of joining a trust . During this time , Gates was able to purchase enough shares of Tennessee Coal and Iron to give him a controlling interest in the company . 
 Gates was riding high with both Republic and Tennessee Coal and Iron doing well with more orders that both could fill . His assessment of the open @-@ hearth process for steel production was confirmed by a report from the US Bureau of Corporations . The report stated that an agent for U. S. Steel and a large railroad affiliated with J. P. Morgan pronounced the rails produced by the open @-@ hearth process to be twice as good at those made by the Bessemer process , which was used by U. S. Steel . The report went on to praise Gates and his competitiveness . 
 = = = = The Panic of 1907 = = = = 
 In 1907 , Gates took his usual summer holiday in Europe . Upon arriving in Paris , he was met with an urgent cablegram from Grant Schley . Schley , the owner of a brokerage and a board member of Republic Steel and Tennessee Coal and Iron , advised Gates of serious business trouble and asked him to return to the US at once . As the Panic of 1907 began , Schley 's brokerage had become short of money and it was necessary for him to obtain large loans to try to keep the brokerage solvent . Schley offered some US $ 6 million shares of Tennessee Coal and Iron Company as part of the collateral for the loans . Oakleigh Thorne was the president of the Trust Company of America bank and also a member of the Gates coalition . Thorne believed his bank was in sound financial condition until a New York Times article stated otherwise . Thorne told reporters that if he paid off every depositor , he would still have US $ 4 million in assets . When the clearing house run by J. P. Morgan audited the bank 's books , they found the bank was sound , but were quite interested in the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company stock they found and indicated that the stock was not acceptable to them as security . 
 Morgan proposed to buy Tennessee Coal and Iron to " rescue " all involved with the company . He outlined a plan whereby U. S. Steel would change its second mortgage bonds for Tennessee Coal and Iron stock . Because the U. S. Steel bonds were acceptable to the clearing house , they would be able to be used for the debts . It was suggested that President Theodore Roosevelt be consulted before such action was taken . Roosevelt was given only an outline of the issue ; he was never told which institution would fail without U. S. Steel 's takeover of Tennessee Coal and Iron . Roosevelt wrote a note to his Attorney General stating he had not learned the name of the troubled business , but felt that he should not object to this occurrence . 
 The New York Times , however , printed its amazement that Tennessee Coal and Iron stocks were not acceptable to the clearing house and that the Trust Company of America was deemed insolvent when it had more than enough assets to cover all deposits . The newspaper concluded that U. S. Steel wanted to take over a serious business competitor and the company was only worried about the Sherman Antitrust Act . All of this had taken place before Gates was able to return to New York ; when he was briefed on the situation , he was told that all other members of the coalition had agreed to Morgan 's terms . While Gates realized he had no choice but to submit his shares of stock , he insisted that all stockholders were to be treated equally with regard to the rate of exchange of their shares . Though this was promised , those holding smaller amounts of stock were said to have received less compensation for them . 
 = = = = Aftermath = = = = 
 Gates involved himself in bettering Port Arthur after losing Tennessee Coal and Iron . He was suffering from a kidney ailment and diabetes and needed to take time away from the town 's business when either flared up . He still had control of the Texas Company and was able to successfully battle Rockefeller 's Standard Oil , who would have liked to take over his company 's land . In 1909 , he was taking his usual summer holiday in Europe when members of the Republican party from the Eastern District of Texas nominated him for Congress . He wired the convention to refuse the nomination , saying that he preferred to participate through his financial contributions . Gates had purchased an animal show and a stable of performing horses with the idea of creating a circus for himself and Port Arthur , when in early 1911 , he found a growth in his throat . The growth was malignant and there were times Gates was hardly able to speak . 
 The US Congress was beset with requests to deal with the U. S. Steel Trust as they had done with the Tobacco Trust and Standard Oil . The House of Representatives formed a committee to examine the dealings of Morgan 's company . Congressman Augustus Owsley Stanley of Kentucky , was named chairman of the committee ; in his long list of persons to subpoena for their testimony the first was John Gates . Gates appeared to give his testimony on May 28 , 1911 ; he was seriously ill and this was evident by how thin and pale he had become . He planned a trip to Paris to consult with doctors there after his testimony . Gates spoke of all of his dealings with J. P. Morgan , from the American Steel and Wire Company to the Louisville and Nashville Railroad and to the time when control of Tennessee Coal and Iron Company was wrested from him forcibly . He left for Paris while the committee was still in session . The result of the hearings was an investigation of U. S. Steel and its practices which would last for almost ten years . J. P. Morgan , who held the belief that he had " saved " the country from the Panic of 1907 , was disgusted at the " ingratitude " of both the government and the nation 's citizens . 
 = = Bet A Million = = 
 Gates maintained a suite at the Waldorf @-@ Astoria of New City from 1894 onwards . Though he paid US $ 30 @,@ 000 yearly for it , his visits pained the hotel 's manager , George Boldt , at times . Gates and his guests were often loud and boisterous . He had a private entrance and elevator , but Gates had a habit of banging on the elevator doors and shouting for service . Boldt instructed his elevator operators to take their time when serving his floor , as it allowed Gates to make as much noise as he wished for a few minutes . Gates ' suite was often home to high @-@ stakes poker parties and Baccarat games . Many poker games began on the train from Chicago to New York and were continued at the Waldorf . One poker game lasted for five days and nights ; when it was done at least US $ 2 million had changed hands . Dellora Gates had long since resigned herself to her husband 's all @-@ night poker games , but many times became upset about them . Gates made it a practice to keep some unset diamonds in his vest pocket for the times when Dellora became angry about the late hours at cards . He would then present a gem to his wife , who would suddenly forget her anger with him . Dellora would take the diamond to Tiffany & Co. to be set in a piece of jewelry of her choice . 
 In 1900 , Gates won $ 600 @,@ 000 on a $ 70 @,@ 000 bet on a horse race in England , exaggerated at over $ 1 million , which conferred on him the nickname " Bet @-@ A @-@ Million " . The Waldorf 's Oscar Tschirky recalled that Gates did not like the nickname , but did little to repudiate the claims as he would bet on practically everything . Oscar recalled a rainy afternoon in the Waldorf 's Oak Room as Gates and two associates watched raindrops trickle down the windows . Gates remarked that the drops did not move down the window at the same speed . One of Gates ' associates spotted two raindrops that were moving at the same rate and pointed them out to him . Gates selected a raindrop and bet his associate that it would reach the bottom of the window first . His associate took him up on the bet and before Gates ' raindrop had won the race , the bets had changed from hundreds of dollars to thousands . Gates believed that all life was a gamble ; a farmer gambled that he would have a successful harvest when planting crops , a merchant gambled that customers would buy items when ordering stock and a traveler gambled on arriving safely when setting out on a journey . 
 Gates continued his heavy betting on horse races when in the United States . In 1902 , he attended the American Derby at Chicago 's Washington Park Race Track , favoring Wyeth , the horse of an associate . When Wyeth won , Gates had profited close to US $ 100 @,@ 000 . At yet another race , Gates won US $ 650 @,@ 000 from his large bets . The Jockey Club president , August Belmont , Jr . , asked Gates to limit his bets to US $ 10 @,@ 000 , as such large wagers gave the impression that the races were not honest ones . Outside of his own hotel suite , Gates ' favorite spot in New York City was the gambling establishment opened by Richard Canfield in 1898 . The club was at 5 East 44th Street . Delmonico 's was next door and provided catering to the club 's guests . When there or at Canfield 's Saratoga clubhouse , Gates ' favored game was faro which he had learned while selling barbed wire in Texas . 
 Gates set up a brokerage office in the hotel 's main lobby for his son , Charlie , and an experienced stockbroker . He speculated on Wall Street from there . In early 1907 , when Gates realized that the market would be headed for a sharp downturn , he closed the offices of Charles G. Gates and Company , announcing he was done with Wall Street for good . Gates also changed his New York residence in May of the same year . He had purchased a substantial number of shares in the United States Realty Company , which had built New York 's Plaza Hotel and was able to design his own 16 room apartment at the Plaza . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Gates died in Paris , France on August 9 , 1911 , following an unsuccessful operation to remove a throat tumor . His funeral was held on August 23 , 1911 in the ballroom of the Plaza Hotel in New York ; Gates had provided the funding for the construction of the hotel . Gates ' mourners had come from all parts of the country ; three floors of the Plaza Hotel were reserved for those attending his services . A large delegation arrived from Texas , where Gates had done much for the city of Port Arthur . 
 The city of Port Arthur held its own memorial service on the same day Gates was buried . Flags were lowered to half staff and from noon until 6pm all businesses in Port Arthur were closed ; the city 's docks and refineries also stopped their operations during this time to honor Port Arthur 's benefactor . While Gates left the bulk of his estate to his wife and son , he inserted a clause in his will that prohibited his family from selling any of his securities until ten years after his death . Gates is said to have included the clause in his will to protect friends who had invested with him from these securities being sold soon after his death . Gates ' estate was valued at between US $ 40 and US $ 50 million . He was buried in the family mausoleum at Woodlawn Cemetery . 
 The Gates Memorial Library in Port Arthur was funded by his widow and donated to the city in 1918 . Originally the city 's public library , Gates Memorial now serves as the campus library for Lamar State College – Port Arthur . It was entered into the National Register of Historic Places in 1981 . In 1971 , Gates was honored with a state historical marker at the site of his Military Plaza barbed wire demonstration in San Antonio .

 = Polyclonal B cell response = 
 Polyclonal B cell response is a natural mode of immune response exhibited by the adaptive immune system of mammals . It ensures that a single antigen is recognized and attacked through its overlapping parts , called epitopes , by multiple clones of B cell . 
 In the course of normal immune response , parts of pathogens ( e.g. bacteria ) are recognized by the immune system as foreign ( non @-@ self ) , and eliminated or effectively neutralized to reduce their potential damage . Such a recognizable substance is called an antigen . The immune system may respond in multiple ways to an antigen ; a key feature of this response is the production of antibodies by B cells ( or B lymphocytes ) involving an arm of the immune system known as humoral immunity . The antibodies are soluble and do not require direct cell @-@ to @-@ cell contact between the pathogen and the B @-@ cell to function . 
 Antigens can be large and complex substances , and any single antibody can only bind to a small , specific area on the antigen . Consequently , an effective immune response often involves the production of many different antibodies by many different B cells against the same antigen . Hence the term " polyclonal " , which derives from the words poly , meaning many , and clones ( " Klon " = Greek for sprout or twig ) ; a clone is a group of cells arising from a common " mother " cell . The antibodies thus produced in a polyclonal response are known as polyclonal antibodies . The heterogeneous polyclonal antibodies are distinct from monoclonal antibody molecules , which are identical and react against a single epitope only , i.e. , are more specific . 
 Although the polyclonal response confers advantages on the immune system , in particular , greater probability of reacting against pathogens , it also increases chances of developing certain autoimmune diseases resulting from the reaction of the immune system against native molecules produced within the host . 
 = = <unk> response to infection = = 
 Diseases which can be transmitted from one organism to another are known as infectious diseases , and the causative biological agent involved is known as a pathogen . The process by which the pathogen is introduced into the body is known as inoculation , and the organism it affects is known as a biological host . When the pathogen establishes itself in a step known as colonization , it can result in an infection , consequently harming the host directly or through the harmful substances called toxins it can produce . This results in the various symptoms and signs characteristic of an infectious disease like pneumonia or diphtheria . 
 Countering the various infectious diseases is very important for the survival of the susceptible organism , in particular , and the species , in general . This is achieved by the host by eliminating the pathogen and its toxins or rendering them nonfunctional . The collection of various cells , tissues and organs that specializes in protecting the body against infections is known as the immune system . The immune system accomplishes this through direct contact of certain white blood cells with the invading pathogen involving an arm of the immune system known as the cell @-@ mediated immunity , or by producing substances that move to sites distant from where they are produced , " seek " the disease @-@ causing cells and toxins by specifically binding with them , and neutralize them in the process – known as the humoral arm of the immune system . Such substances are known as soluble antibodies and perform important functions in countering infections . 
 Types of White blood cells ( <unk> ) 
 = = B cell response = = 
 Antibodies serve various functions in protecting the host against the pathogen . Their soluble forms which carry out these functions are produced by plasma B cells , a type of white blood cell . This production is tightly regulated and requires the activation of B cells by activated T cells ( another type of white blood cell ) , which is a sequential procedure . The major steps involved are : 
 Specific or nonspecific recognition of the pathogen ( because of its antigens ) with its subsequent engulfing by B cells or macrophages . This activates the B cell only partially . 
 Antigen processing . 
 Antigen presentation . 
 Activation of the T helper cells by antigen @-@ presenting cells . 
 <unk> of the B cell by activated T cell resulting in its complete activation . 
 Proliferation of B cells with resultant production of soluble antibodies . 
 = = = Recognition of pathogens = = = 
 Pathogens synthesize proteins that can serve as " recognizable " antigens ; they may express the molecules on their surface or release them into the surroundings ( body fluids ) . What makes these substances recognizable is that they bind very specifically and somewhat strongly to certain host proteins called antibodies . The same antibodies can be anchored to the surface of cells of the immune system , in which case they serve as receptors , or they can be secreted in the blood , known as soluble antibodies . On a molecular scale , the proteins are relatively large , so they cannot be recognized as a whole ; instead , their segments , called epitopes , can be recognized . An epitope comes in contact with a very small region ( of 15 – 22 amino acids ) of the antibody molecule ; this region is known as the paratope . In the immune system , membrane @-@ bound antibodies are the B cell receptor ( BCR ) . Also , while the T cell receptor is not biochemically classified as an antibody , it serves a similar function in that it specifically binds to epitopes complexed with major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) molecules . The binding between a paratope and its corresponding antigen is very specific , owing to its structure , and is guided by various noncovalent bonds , not unlike the pairing of other types of ligands ( any atom , ion or molecule that binds with any receptor with at least some degree of specificity and strength ) . The specificity of binding does not arise out of a rigid lock and key type of interaction , but rather requires both the paratope and the epitope to undergo slight conformational changes in each other 's presence . 
 = = = = Specific recognition of epitope by B cells = = = = 
 In figure at left , the various segments that form the epitope have been shown to be continuously collinear , meaning that they have been shown as sequential ; however , for the situation being discussed here ( i.e. , the antigen recognition by the B cell ) , this explanation is too simplistic . Such epitopes are known as sequential or linear epitopes , as all the amino acids on them are in the same sequence ( line ) . This mode of recognition is possible only when the peptide is small ( about six to eight amino acids long ) , and is employed by the T cells ( T lymphocytes ) . 
 However , the B memory / naive cells recognize intact proteins present on the pathogen surface . In this situation , the protein in its tertiary structure is so greatly folded that some loops of amino acids come to lie in the interior of the protein , and the segments that flank them may lie on the surface . The paratope on the B cell receptor comes in contact only with those amino acids that lie on the surface of the protein . The surface amino acids may actually be discontinuous in the protein 's primary structure , but get juxtaposed owing to the complex protein folding patterns ( as in the adjoining figure ) . Such epitopes are known as conformational epitopes and tend to be longer ( 15 – 22 amino acid residues ) than the linear epitopes . Likewise , the antibodies produced by the plasma cells belonging to the same clone would bind to the same conformational epitopes on the pathogen proteins . 
 The binding of a specific antigen with corresponding BCR molecules results in increased production of the MHC @-@ II molecules . This assumes significance as the same does not happen when the same antigen would be internalized by a relatively nonspecific process called <unk> , in which the antigen with the surrounding fluid is " drunk " as a small vesicle by the B cell . Hence , such an antigen is known as a nonspecific antigen and does not lead to activation of the B cell , or subsequent production of antibodies against it . 
 = = = = <unk> recognition by macrophages = = = = 
 Macrophages and related cells employ a different mechanism to recognize the pathogen . Their receptors recognize certain motifs present on the invading pathogen that are very unlikely to be present on a host cell . Such repeating motifs are recognized by pattern recognition receptors ( <unk> ) like the Toll @-@ like receptors ( <unk> ) expressed by the macrophages . Since the same receptor could bind to a given motif present on surfaces of widely disparate microorganisms , this mode of recognition is relatively nonspecific , and constitutes an innate immune response . 
 = = = Antigen processing = = = 
 After recognizing an antigen , an antigen presenting cell such as the macrophage or B lymphocyte engulfs it completely by a process called phagocytosis . The engulfed particle , along with some material surrounding it , forms the endocytic vesicle ( the phagosome ) , which fuses with lysosomes . Within the lysosome , the antigen is broken down into smaller pieces called peptides by proteases ( enzymes that degrade larger proteins ) . The individual peptides are then complexed with major histocompatibility complex class II ( MHC class II ) molecules located in the lysosome – this method of " handling " the antigen is known as the exogenous or endocytic pathway of antigen processing in contrast to the endogenous or cytosolic pathway , which complexes the abnormal proteins produced within the cell ( e.g. under the influence of a viral infection or in a tumor cell ) with MHC class I molecules . 
 An alternate pathway of endocytic processing had also been demonstrated wherein certain proteins like fibrinogen and myoglobin can bind as a whole to MHC @-@ II molecules after they are denatured and their disulfide bonds are reduced ( breaking the bond by adding hydrogen atoms across it ) . The proteases then degrade the exposed regions of the protein @-@ MHC II @-@ complex . 
 = = = Antigen presentation = = = 
 After the processed antigen ( peptide ) is complexed to the MHC molecule , they both migrate together to the cell membrane , where they are exhibited ( elaborated ) as a complex that can be recognized by the CD 4 + ( T helper cell ) – a type of white blood cell . This is known as antigen presentation . However , the epitopes ( conformational epitopes ) that are recognized by the B cell prior to their digestion may not be the same as that presented to the T helper cell . Additionally , a B cell may present different peptides complexed to different MHC @-@ II molecules . 
 = = = T helper cell stimulation = = = 
 The CD 4 + cells through their T cell receptor @-@ CD3 complex recognize the epitope @-@ bound MHC II molecules on the surface of the antigen presenting cells , and get ' activated ' . Upon this activation , these T cells proliferate and differentiate into Th2 cells . This makes them produce soluble chemical signals that promote their own survival . However , another important function that they carry out is the stimulation of B cell by establishing direct physical contact with them . 
 = = = <unk> of B cell by activated T helper cell = = = 
 Complete stimulation of T helper cells requires the B7 molecule present on the antigen presenting cell to bind with <unk> molecule present on the T cell surface ( in close proximity with the T cell receptor ) . Likewise , a second interaction between the CD40 ligand or <unk> ( <unk> ) present on T cell surface and CD40 present on B cell surface , is also necessary . The same interactions that stimulate the T helper cell also stimulate the B cell , hence the term <unk> . The entire mechanism ensures that an activated T cell only stimulates a B cell that recognizes the antigen containing the same epitope as recognized by the T cell receptor of the " <unk> " T helper cell . The B cell gets stimulated , apart from the direct <unk> , by certain growth factors , viz . , interleukins 2 , 4 , 5 , and 6 in a <unk> fashion . These factors are usually produced by the newly activated T helper cell . However , this activation occurs only after the B cell receptor present on a memory or a naive B cell itself would have bound to the corresponding epitope , without which the initiating steps of phagocytosis and antigen processing would not have occurred . 
 = = = Proliferation and differentiation of B cell = = = 
 A naive ( or inexperienced ) B cell is one which belongs to a clone which has never encountered the epitope to which it is specific . In contrast , a memory B cell is one which derives from an activated naive or memory B cell . The activation of a naive or a memory B cell is followed by a manifold proliferation of that particular B cell , most of the progeny of which terminally differentiate into plasma B cells ; the rest survive as memory B cells . So , when the naive cells belonging to a particular clone encounter their specific antigen to give rise to the plasma cells , and also leave a few memory cells , this is known as the primary immune response . In the course of proliferation of this clone , the B cell receptor genes can undergo frequent ( one in every two cell divisions ) mutations in the genes coding for paratopes of antibodies . These frequent mutations are termed somatic hypermutation . Each such mutation alters the epitope @-@ binding ability of the paratope slightly , creating new clones of B cells in the process . Some of the newly created paratopes bind more strongly to the same epitope ( leading to the selection of the clones possessing them ) , which is known as affinity maturation . Other paratopes bind better to epitopes that are slightly different from the original epitope that had stimulated proliferation . Variations in the epitope structure are also usually produced by mutations in the genes of pathogen coding for their antigen . Somatic hypermutation , thus , makes the B cell receptors and the soluble antibodies in subsequent encounters with antigens , more inclusive in their antigen recognition potential of altered epitopes , apart from bestowing greater specificity for the antigen that induced proliferation in the first place . When the memory cells get stimulated by the antigen to produce plasma cells ( just like in the clone 's primary response ) , and leave even more memory cells in the process , this is known as a secondary immune response , which translates into greater numbers of plasma cells and faster rate of antibody production lasting for longer periods . The memory B cells produced as a part of secondary response recognize the corresponding antigen faster and bind more strongly with it ( i.e. , greater affinity of binding ) owing to affinity maturation . The soluble antibodies produced by the clone show a similar enhancement in antigen binding . 
 = = Basis of <unk> = = 
 Responses are polyclonal in nature as each clone somewhat specializes in producing antibodies against a given epitope , and because , each antigen contains multiple epitopes , each of which in turn can be recognized by more than one clone of B cells . To be able to react to innumerable antigens , as well as multiple constituent epitopes , the immune system requires the ability to recognize a very great number of epitopes in all , i.e. , there should be a great diversity of B cell clones . 
 = = = <unk> of B cells = = = 
 Memory and naïve B cells normally exist in relatively small numbers . As the body needs to be able to respond to a large number of potential pathogens , it maintains a pool of B cells with a wide range of specificities . Consequently , while there is almost always at least one B ( naive or memory ) cell capable of responding to any given epitope ( of all that the immune system can react against ) , there are very few exact duplicates . However , when a single B cell encounters an antigen to which it can bind , it can proliferate very rapidly . Such a group of cells with identical specificity towards the epitope is known as a clone , and is derived from a common " mother " cell . All the " daughter " B cells match the original " mother " cell in their epitope specificity , and they secrete antibodies with identical paratopes . These antibodies are monoclonal antibodies , since they derive from clones of the same parent cell . A polyclonal response is one in which clones of multiple B cells react to the same antigen . 
 = = = Single antigen contains multiple overlapping epitopes = = = 
 A single antigen can be thought of as a sequence of multiple overlapping epitopes . Many unique B cell clones may be able to bind to the individual epitopes . This imparts even greater multiplicity to the overall response . All of these B cells can become activated and produce large colonies of plasma cell clones , each of which can secrete up to 1000 antibody molecules against each epitope per second . 
 = = = Multiple clones recognize single epitope = = = 
 In addition to different B cells reacting to different epitopes on the same antigen , B cells belonging to different clones may also be able to react to the same epitope . An epitope that can be attacked by many different B cells is said to be highly immunogenic . In these cases , the binding affinities for respective epitope @-@ paratope pairs vary , with some B cell clones producing antibodies that bind strongly to the epitope , and others producing antibodies that bind weakly . 
 = = = <unk> selection = = = 
 The clones that bind to a particular epitope with greater strength are more likely to be selected for further proliferation in the germinal centers of the follicles in various lymphoid tissues like the lymph nodes . This is not unlike natural selection : clones are selected for their fitness to attack the epitopes ( strength of binding ) on the encountered pathogen . What makes the analogy even stronger is that the B lymphocytes have to compete with each other for signals that promote their survival in the germinal centers . 
 = = = Diversity of B cell clones = = = 
 Although there are many diverse pathogens , many of which are constantly mutating , it is a surprise that a majority of individuals remain free of infections . Thus , maintenance of health requires the body to recognize all pathogens ( antigens they present or produce ) likely to exist . This is achieved by maintaining a pool of immensely large ( about 109 ) clones of B cells , each of which reacts against a specific epitope by recognizing and producing antibodies against it . However , at any given time very few clones actually remain receptive to their specific epitope . Thus , approximately 107 different epitopes can be recognized by all the B cell clones combined . Moreover , in a lifetime , an individual usually requires the generation of antibodies against very few antigens in comparison with the number that the body can recognize and respond against . 
 = = Significance of the phenomenon = = 
 = = = Increased probability of recognizing any antigen = = = 
 If an antigen can be recognized by more than one component of its structure , it is less likely to be " missed " by the immune system . Mutation of pathogenic organisms can result in modification of antigen — and , hence , epitope — structure . If the immune system " remembers " what the other epitopes look like , the antigen , and the organism , will still be recognized and subjected to the body 's immune response . Thus , the polyclonal response widens the range of pathogens that can be recognized . 
 = = = Limitation of immune system against rapidly mutating viruses = = = 
 Many viruses undergo frequent mutations that result in changes in amino acid composition of their important proteins . <unk> located on the protein may also undergo alterations in the process . Such an altered epitope binds less strongly with the antibodies specific to the unaltered epitope that would have stimulated the immune system . This is unfortunate because somatic hypermutation does give rise to clones capable of producing soluble antibodies that would have bound the altered epitope avidly enough to neutralize it . But these clones would consist of naive cells which are not allowed to proliferate by the weakly binding antibodies produced by the <unk> stimulated clone . This doctrine is known as the original antigenic sin . This phenomenon comes into play particularly in immune responses against influenza , dengue and HIV viruses . This limitation , however , is not imposed by the phenomenon of polyclonal response , but rather , against it by an immune response that is biased in favor of experienced memory cells against the " novice " naive cells . 
 = = = Increased chances of autoimmune reactions = = = 
 In autoimmunity the immune system wrongly recognizes certain native molecules in the body as foreign ( self @-@ antigen ) , and mounts an immune response against them . Since these native molecules , as normal parts of the body , will naturally always exist in the body , the attacks against them can get stronger over time ( akin to secondary immune response ) . Moreover , many organisms exhibit molecular mimicry , which involves showing those antigens on their surface that are <unk> similar to the host proteins . This has two possible consequences : first , either the organism will be spared as a self antigen ; or secondly , that the antibodies produced against it will also bind to the mimicked native proteins . The antibodies will attack the self @-@ antigens and the tissues harboring them by activating various mechanisms like the complement activation and antibody @-@ dependent cell @-@ mediated cytotoxicity . Hence , wider the range of antibody @-@ specificities , greater the chance that one or the other will react against self @-@ antigens ( native molecules of the body ) . 
 = = = Difficulty in producing monoclonal antibodies = = = 
 Monoclonal antibodies are structurally identical immunoglobulin molecules with identical epitope @-@ specificity ( all of them bind with the same epitope with same affinity ) as against their polyclonal counterparts which have varying affinities for the same epitope . They are usually not produced in a natural immune response , but only in diseased states like multiple myeloma , or through specialized laboratory techniques . Because of their specificity , monoclonal antibodies are used in certain applications to quantify or detect the presence of substances ( which act as antigen for the monoclonal antibodies ) , and for targeting individual cells ( e.g. cancer cells ) . Monoclonal antibodies find use in various diagnostic modalities ( see : western blot and immunofluorescence ) and therapies — particularly of cancer and diseases with autoimmune component . But , since virtually all responses in nature are polyclonal , it makes production of immensely useful monoclonal antibodies less straightforward . 
 = = History = = 
 The first evidence of presence of a neutralizing substance in the blood that could counter infections came when Emil von Behring along with Kitasato Shibasaburō in 1890 developed effective serum against diphtheria . This they did by transferring serum produced from animals immunized against diphtheria to animals suffering from it . Transferring the serum thus could cure the infected animals . Behring was awarded the Nobel Prize for this work in 1901 . 
 At this time though the chemical nature of what exactly in the blood conferred this protection was not known . In a few decades to follow , it was shown that the protective serum could neutralize and precipitate toxins , and clump bacteria . All these functions were attributed to different substances in the serum , and named accordingly as antitoxin , <unk> and agglutinin . That all the three substances were one entity ( gamma globulins ) was demonstrated by Elvin A. <unk> in 1939 . In the preceding year <unk> had demonstrated the heterogeneity of antibodies through ultracentrifugation studies of horses ' sera . 
 Until this time , cell @-@ mediated immunity and humoral immunity were considered to be contending theories to explain effective immune response , but the former lagged behind owing to lack of advanced techniques . Cell @-@ mediated immunity got an impetus in its recognition and study when in 1942 , Merrill Chase successfully transferred immunity against tuberculosis between pigs by transferring white blood cells . 
 It was later shown in 1948 by Astrid <unk> in her doctoral thesis that the plasma B cells are specifically involved in antibody production . The role of lymphocytes in mediating both cell @-@ mediated and humoral responses was demonstrated by James Gowans in 1959 . 
 In order to account for the wide range of antigens the immune system can recognize , Paul Ehrlich in 1900 had hypothesized that preexisting " side chain receptors " bind a given pathogen , and that this interaction induces the cell exhibiting the receptor to multiply and produce more copies of the same receptor . This theory , called the selective theory was not proven for next five decades , and had been challenged by several instructional theories which were based on the notion that an antibody would assume its effective structure by folding around the antigen . In the late 1950s however , the works of three scientists — Jerne , Talmage and Burnet ( who largely modified the theory ) — gave rise to the clonal selection theory , which proved all the elements of Ehrlich 's hypothesis except that the specific receptors that could neutralize the agent were soluble and not membrane @-@ bound . 
 The clonal selection theory was proved correct when Sir Gustav Nossal showed that each B cell always produces only one antibody . 
 In 1974 , the role of MHC in antigen presentation was demonstrated by Rolf <unk> and Peter C. Doherty .

 In February – June 1872 , Railroad Gazette published a series of articles written by a person using the pen name " Hindoo " , and reader comments in response to the articles . Hindoo was a British colonial official who was visiting the United States , who stated that the Indian railway system very rarely had problems with head @-@ on and rear @-@ end collisions , which were more frequent in the United States . Hindoo proposed that this was due to the manner in which Indian train stations dispatched trains using telegraphs , in which a system was used whereby each train station acted as a " blocking point . " This blocking point system was originally devised by the British railroad industry , and forbade trains from leaving a station until a telegraph was received from the next station stating that the line was clear , upon which a clearance card was issued to the train operator . Hindoo felt that the U.S. system placed too much responsibility upon a single dispatcher , who would " oversee all freight and passenger train movements on a division . " 
 Hindoo 's articles provided a comparison of safety matters between Indian and American railway systems , comparisons of management systems and styles and comparisons in train dispatching methods . A main contributor to the ongoing discussion was a reader using the pen name " X " , and several other readers also responded . In a response , X stated that the U.S. system was less expensive and more efficient compared to British and Indian methods , and posited whether another system could be used that is both cost effective and safe . Additional reader responses generally concurred with X 's opinion , but did not provide solid suggestions about how to remedy such problems . One respondent stated that some of the comparisons were faulty as being based upon U.S. railway lines that did not use telegraphic dispatching . This discourse in Railroad Gazette during this time also covered various aspects of problems and flaws in the American railroad system , and potential reforms to remedy these problems . 
 An article published on April 18 , 1884 in Railroad Gazette , written by railroad engineer Horatio Allen and titled " The First Railroad in America " , states that the author ( Allen ) was the operator of the first locomotive run in the United States on a railroad . Allen stated that on August 9 , 1829 , he ran a locomotive named Stourbridge Lion in Pennsylvania " three miles and back over rails of wood upon which bar iron 2 ¼ inches wide and 1 ½ inch thick was spiked down " .

 = Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 = 
 Ireland participated at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 after Radio Telefís Éireann ( RTÉ ) , the Irish broadcaster , internally selected the Irish traditional group Dervish to represent them at the 2007 contest , held in Helsinki , Finland . 
 Although RTÉ internally selected the artist to represent Ireland at the contest , the song that Dervish sung was selected by the Irish public during The Late Late Show on 16 February 2007 . The song selected was " They Can 't Stop the Spring " , which was composed by John Waters and Tommy Moran . Having automatically qualified to the final after coming in 10th in 2006 , Dervish only managed to receive five points , all from Albania , placing last of 24 countries . This was the first time Ireland came last in the contest , after winning a total of seven times in its history , more than any other country in the contest . 
 After the contest , reactions in Ireland were unsettled , with talks of " vote hijacking " and calls for a new selection for Eurovision . Criticism was also given to Dervish 's performance at the contest . 
 = = Background = = 
 Ireland first entered the Eurovision Song Contest in 1965 , making their 41st participation in 2007 . Ireland has won the contest seven times in total and no other country has equaled or beaten that record . The country 's first win came in their sixth entry , in 1970 , when then 18 @-@ year @-@ old Dana won with " All Kinds of Everything " . Ireland holds the record for being the only country to win the country three times in a row ( in 1992 , 1993 and 1994 ) . Ireland also has the only three @-@ time winner ( Johnny Logan , who won in 1980 as a singer , 1987 as a singer @-@ songwriter , and again in 1992 as a songwriter ) . In recent years , however , Ireland 's impressive record at Eurovision has taken a turn , with only two Top 10 results during the 2000s , and Ireland 's first last place finish in 2007 . 
 The Irish national <unk> , Radio Telefís Éireann ( RTÉ ) broadcasts the event each year and organizes the selection process for the entry . Many methods of selection have been used , with the most common method used by RTÉ being a national final featuring a multi @-@ artist , multi @-@ song selection in which regional juries , and later the public , chooses the winner . In recent years the artist has sometimes been selected internally by RTÉ , with the song being chosen by the public .

 RTÉ decided to continue internally selecting the singer that would represent them at the contest after coming in 10th in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 in Athens with Brian Kennedy and " Every Song Is a Cry for Love " . Many names were rumoured to be in contention to represent Ireland in Helsinki , with the front @-@ runner being three @-@ time winner , Johnny Logan , after he said in an interview on Tubridy Tonight that he would represent Ireland in the contest once again if " everything was right , and that everyone was in agreement " , including the song he would sing . However , a deal between RTÉ and Logan was not agreed upon and Logan was not selected to represent Ireland at the contest . 
 Apart from Logan , many other artists were popular with the book @-@ makers , including You 're A Star winner Lucia Evans , host of the Eurovision Song Contest 1997 Ronan Keating , as well as winner of the 1992 contest Linda Martin . However , RTÉ announced in November 2006 that they had selected Irish traditional group Dervish to sing for Ireland at the contest . Dervish consists of Cathy Jordan ( vocals and bodhrán ) , Bob The 2nd , ( <unk> the head ) Brian McDonagh ( mandola ) , Tom Morrow ( fiddle ) , Michael Homes ( bouzouki ) , Shane Mitchell ( accordion ) and Liam Kelly ( flute and whistle ) . 
 = = = The songs = = = 
 Songwriters were told that they had until 8 January to submit their songs to RTÉ . The songs submitted needed to be suitable to both Dervish and the contest , with all eligible songs having to pass through a judging panel to reduce the number of songs to four that would be performed at the national final . The judging panel included Shay Healy , the songwriter of " What 's Another Year " which was the winning song for Ireland in 1980 . More than 200 songs were submitted to the judging panel at RTÉ , with only 4 of them selected to compete at the national final . 
 The four selected songs were " The Thought of You " , a traditional Irish ballad which uses Irish traditional instruments throughout the piece , such as a whistle , a fiddle and a bouzouki ; the song was composed by Matti Kallio . The second song " Walk With Me " was composed by <unk> Lindell , and is also a ballad , however more upbeat than " The Thought of You " . The third was " They Can 't Stop The Spring " , composed by John Waters and Tommy Moran , which features a long whistle introduction , and prolific use of the bouzouki and fiddle , as well as use of the bodhrán .

 After coming in 10th in the 2006 contest , Ireland automatically qualified to the final of the 2007 contest in Helsinki . Commentary on RTÉ One for both the final and semi @-@ final , which was broadcast in Ireland even though it was not part of it , was made by Marty Whelan , while Larry Gogan provided commentary on RTÉ Radio 1 . Before the contest , " They Can 't Stop the Spring " received a change in its performance , with the instrumental break in the song being increased in length . The odds of Ireland 's win at the contest varied between bookmakers , ranging from 25 – 1 up to 51 – 1 , however , the writer of the song John Waters believed that Dervish could win the contest . 
 Three @-@ time winner Johnny Logan criticised the contest when interviewed in the Danish newspaper <unk> Bladet . He disapproved of the its lack of orchestra , the televoting system as well as the allowance of free language in the contest , calling it a " karaoke contest " .

 Dervish performed " They Can 't Stop the Spring " fourth on the night of the final , held on 12 May 2007 . Jordan was dressed in a red and white dress , while the men were dressed in plain black shirts , with jeans . The song was performed quicker than in the national final , but did not lose its Irish traditional quality . The performance by Dervish involved lots of movement , as well as some dancing by the group . The group was accompanied by a background showing large flowers in bloom . The song , however , was not well received by the European audience and Dervish only managed to collect 5 points , all from Albania , placing last for the first time in Ireland 's history at the contest .

 Despite coming in last at Eurovision , Dervish announced that they would continue to play their music , saying that they " play [ it ] for music 's sake " and that " it 's about heart and soul , it 's not about votes " . It was also announced that , despite Ireland 's last place , RTÉ received an increase of viewership over the 2006 numbers ; RTÉ received 780 @,@ 000 viewers for the final , marginally higher than in 2006 . Despite this , reactions in Ireland were unsettled , with talks of " vote hijacking " after Ireland gave 12 points to Lithuania , getting little elsewhere . 
 A TV special was aired on RTÉ on Dervish , however this faced criticism from Irish local media on RTÉ 's choice of Dervish as well as the production of the forthcoming show after Dervish 's last place in the contest , with claims that their performance on the night of the contest was " disastrous " . Demands were also made that RTÉ change their selection method for Eurovision . 
 Rumours spread that RTÉ would withdraw from the 2008 contest , however RTÉ announced changes to the selection of the Irish entry for the 2008 contest , abandoning The Late Late Show format and reverting to the " National Song Contest " format used in Ireland prior to 2001 .

 In Game 1 , Herb Pennock pitched the Yanks to a 2 – 1 win over the Cards . In Game 2 , pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander evened the Series for the Cards with a 6 – 2 victory . <unk> Jesse Haines ' complete game shutout in Game 3 gave St. Louis a 2 – 1 Series lead . In the Yanks ' 10 – 5 Game 4 win , Babe Ruth hit three home runs , a World Series record equaled only four times since . According to newspaper reports , Ruth had promised a sickly boy named Johnny Sylvester to hit a home run for him in Game 4 . After Ruth 's three @-@ homer game , the boy 's condition miraculously improved . The newspapers ' account of the story is disputed by contemporary baseball historians , but it remains one of the most famous anecdotes in baseball history .

 The Cardinals won the 1926 National League pennant with 89 wins and 65 losses , two games ahead of the runner @-@ up Cincinnati Reds , after finishing only fourth in 1925 at 77 – 76 . Before 1926 was half over , they traded outfielder Heinie Mueller to the New York Giants for outfielder Billy Southworth . They also claimed future Hall of Fame pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander on waivers from the Chicago Cubs . Their starting rotation was led by Flint Rhem with 20 wins and a 3 @.@ 21 earned run average ( ERA ) , far surpassing his eight wins and 4 @.@ 92 ERA of 1925 . Offensively , the Cardinals were led by Jim Bottomley , Rogers Hornsby ( who had hit over .400 in 1925 ) and catcher Bob O 'Farrell , 1926 National League MVP @-@ to @-@ be . 
 The 1926 NL pennant race was heated . During the second and third weeks of September , both the Cardinals and the Reds had multi @-@ game winning streaks and traded first and second place almost every day . On September 17 , the Cards took a one @-@ game lead over the Reds and extended their lead when the Reds lost several games in a row . They lost the last game of the season to the Reds on September 26 , but still finished two games ahead of them in first place in the final standings . 
 The Yanks had the best record in the AL at 91 – 63 , finishing three games ahead of the Cleveland Indians and greatly improving on their 69 @-@ win , seventh @-@ place 1925 season , making Lou Gehrig their permanent starting first baseman and trading for rookie second baseman Tony Lazzeri in the offseason . Gehrig , Lazzeri , Ruth and Earle Combs led the offense , while Pennock and Urban Shocker led the starting rotation with 42 wins between them . 
 In early September 1926 , thousands of Cleveland fans , confident that their Indians would win the pennant even when they trailed the Yanks by six games , made World Series ticket reservations . By September 23 they were only two games behind New York , but then lost three of their final four games to finish the season three games behind . 
 On September 11 , Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis met with representatives from four of the top teams in each of the two major leagues . The group gave home field to the AL for World Series Games 1 & 2 ( scheduled for October 2 & 3 ) and 6 & 7 , while the NL would host Games 3 – 5 . Each game was to start at 1 : 30 PM local time . 
 Some bookmakers made the Yankees a 15 @-@ to @-@ 1 Series favorite , while others , like New York 's top betting commissioners , thought the teams were evenly matched . One The New York Times <unk> found " little justification for installing either team as the favorite " . Regardless of the odds , players from both teams were confident of victory . Hornsby said , " We 're going to come through winners . We have the better pitching staff , the better hitters and the greater experience . That 's what it takes to win . ... We 're going to beat the Yankees . Any of my ball players will tell you that , and we expect to do it . " Yankee skipper Miller Huggins retorted , 
 We 're confident we 're going to win . It 'll be whichever team does the hitting , and we 're sure we 're going to do it . We 're out of our hitting slump . We have a more experienced team and more experienced pitchers . We 're about even in the strength of the infields , but ours is steadier . Our outfield is better , stronger and more experienced , and all the boys are cocky and ready to go . There 's no doubt in their minds or in mine that the Yankees will win .

As one of the game announcers ( either McNamee or Carlin ) described the situation : 
 The Babe is up . Two home runs today . One ball , far outside . Babe 's shoulders look as if there is murder in them down there , the way he is swinging that bat down there . A high foul into the left @-@ field stands . That great big bat of Babe 's looks like a toothpick down there , he is so big himself . Here it is . Babe shot a bad one and fouled it . Two strikes and one ball . The outfield have all moved very far towards right . It is coming up now . A little too close . Two strikes and two balls . He has got two home runs and a base on balls so far today . Here it is , and a ball . Three and two . The Babe is waving that wand of his over the plate . Bell is loosing up his arm . The Babe is hit clear into the center @-@ field bleachers for a home run ! For a home run ! Did you hear what I said ? Where is that fellow who told me not to talk about Ruth anymore ? Send him up here . 
 Oh what a shot ! Directly over second . The boys are all over him over there . One of the boys is riding on Ruth 's back . Oh , what a shot ! Directly over second base far into the bleachers out in center field , and almost on a line and then that dumbbell , where is he , who told me not to talk about Ruth ! Oh , boy ! Not that I love Ruth , but oh , how I love to see a shot like that ! Wow ! That is a world 's series record , three home runs in one world 's series game and what a home run ! That was probably the longest hit ever in Sportsman 's Park . They tell me this is the first ball ever hit in the center @-@ field stand . That is a mile and half from here . You know what I mean . 
 It was measured at over 430 feet ( 130 m ) and had cleared the 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) wall in center field , crashing through the window of an auto dealer across the street from the stadium . Locals claimed it was the longest home run ever hit in St. Louis . Meusel then hit a single in right field , but was tagged out as he tried to head for second base . Gehrig followed with a double to the opposite side , but could not score when Lazzeri popped up to Thevenow to end the inning . 
 In the seventh inning , the Yankees faced a new pitcher , this time a southpaw named Bill Hallahan , who served as both a starter and reliever for the Cardinals . After Severeid singled and subsequently advanced on a sacrifice bunt by Hoyt , he scored on a double hit into left field by Combs . The Yankees led 10 – 4 and did not get any more runs or hits in the eighth or ninth inning . The Cardinals came up to bat in the bottom of the ninth inning with Hoyt trying to hold on to his six @-@ run lead . Hornsby singled to right field and advanced to second base on the following play .

With the series tied at two games apiece , both teams anticipated Game 5 , which featured a rematch between Herb Pennock and Bill Sherdel . 
 = = = = Babe Ruth and Johnny Sylvester = = = = 
 The 1926 World Series produced one of the most famous anecdotes in baseball history , involving Babe Ruth and Johnny Sylvester . Sylvester was an 11 @-@ year @-@ old boy from Essex Fells , New Jersey , who was supposedly hospitalized after falling off a horse . Sylvester asked his father to get him a baseball autographed by Babe Ruth . Prior to the start of the World Series , the boy 's parents sent urgent telegrams to the Yankees in St. Louis , asking for an autographed ball . Soon , the family received an airmail package with two balls , one autographed by the entire St. Louis Cardinals team and the other with signatures from a number of Yankees players and a personal message from Ruth saying , " I 'll knock a homer for you on Wednesday " . After Ruth hit three home runs in Game 4 on Wednesday , October 6 , newspapers reported that Sylvester 's condition had miraculously improved . After the World Series had ended , Ruth made a highly publicized visit to Sylvester 's home , in which the boy said to Ruth , " I 'm sorry the Yanks lost the series " . In the spring of 1927 , Sylvester 's uncle visited Ruth and thanked him for saving the boy 's life . Ruth asked how the boy was doing and asked the uncle to give the boy his regards . After the man left , Ruth , who was seated next to a group of baseball writers , said , " Now who the hell is Johnny Sylvester ? " 
 There have been many alternate versions of this event . One version , which was later portrayed in The Babe Ruth Story , claims that Ruth went to Sylvester 's hospital bed and promised him in person that he would hit a home run for him . On October 9 , Ruth followed up on Sylvester and told him he would " try to knock you another homer , maybe two today " . Differing newspaper reports from October 1926 claimed that Sylvester suffered from blood poisoning , a spinal infection , a sinus condition , or had a condition requiring a spinal fusion . Contemporary analyses dispute whether Sylvester was ever hospitalized , dying , or if Ruth 's three home runs had actually saved the boy 's life , as claimed by the newspapers . 
 A new documentary entitled ' I 'll Knock a Homer for You ' sets the record straight on this legendary story of Johnny Sylvester and Babe Ruth . Made by filmmaker Andrew Lilley , the award @-@ winning movie was broadcast on <unk> in late 2013 , and was also screened at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown , New York . Johnny Sylvester was Andrew 's great @-@ uncle .

With runners at first and second base , Koenig hit a single to left fielder Hafey . Pennock scored on the play , and Combs moved to second base . Ruth then struck out , and Bob Meusel followed by hitting a sacrifice fly to right fielder Billy Southworth , on which Combs promptly advanced to third base . Lou Gehrig drew a walk to load the bases for Tony Lazzeri , who ended the inning by hitting a fly ball to center fielder Wattie Holm . 
 The Cardinals came back to take the lead in the bottom of the seventh inning . Bell led the inning by hitting a double into left field .

With runners at first and second base , Pennock hit a groundball to shortstop Thevenow , who tossed it to second base to get the force out on Severeid . With Pennock at first base and Paschal at third base , Combs grounded to second base , ending the Yankees ' hope of taking the lead . The Cardinals could not break the 2 – 2 tie in the bottom of the ninth inning , so the game went into extra innings . 
 The Yankees immediately took advantage of Sherdel in the top of the tenth inning . Koenig led things off by singling into left field . Sherdel threw a wild pitch to Ruth , and Koenig advanced to second base . Ruth then walked , and Meusel followed with a sacrifice bunt straight to pitcher Sherdel .

 Saturday October 9 , 1926 at Yankee Stadium ( I ) in the Bronx , New York 
 The teams moved back to Yankee Stadium for Game 6 . Over 48 @,@ 000 fans came into Yankee Stadium on October 9 to see if the Yankees could win their second World Series in franchise history . The game 's pitching matchup was between Grover Cleveland Alexander and Bob Shawkey , both of whom had made appearances in previous games in the series . Shawkey had come in as relief in Games 2 and 3 , while Alexander had pitched a complete game against the Yankees in the Cardinals ' Game 2 victory . In the 1926 season , Shawkey had made most of his pitching appearances in relief , and had been an occasional starter on the Yankees rotation . He started 10 of his 29 total pitching appearances and posted an 8 – 7 record with a 3 @.@ 62 earned run average . 
 The game was lopsided from the start . In the top of the first inning , Shawkey gave up three runs on three hits , with the runs coming from a Jim Bottomley double and Les Bell single . Alexander encountered a minor setback in the fourth inning . To open up the bottom of the inning , Bob Meusel launched a triple into left field and scored on the following ground out by Lou Gehrig . Alexander shut down the Yankees for the rest of the inning , and the Cardinals held on to a 3 – 1 lead . In the top of the fifth inning , the Cardinals expanded their two @-@ run lead . Tommy Thevenow hit a single to left fielder Babe Ruth . Alexander laid down a sacrifice bunt and was tagged out by first baseman Gehrig , but was successful in advancing Thevenow to second base . Wattie Holm , substituting for Taylor Douthit as center fielder , followed by hitting a single into center field , scoring Thevenow on the play . Billy Southworth and Rogers Hornsby followed with groundouts in the infield to end the inning . 
 The Cardinals scored again in the top of the seventh inning . Thevenow again led the inning by hitting a single into left field . Alexander bunted right in front of the plate . Yankees catcher Hank Severeid made the throw to second baseman Tony Lazzeri , but Lazzeri made an error on the play , and both runners were safe at their respective bases . Holm followed by hitting a weak grounder that led to a force out of Thevenow at third base . With runners at first and second base , Southworth lined a double right by Ruth , scoring Alexander and sending Holm to third base . Urban Shocker , the starter in Game 2 , then came in to relieve Shawkey as pitcher . Shocker gave up a single to Hornsby into center field , allowing Holm and Southworth to score . Bottomley then hit a grounder to shortstop Mark Koenig , who stepped on second base to get Hornsby out on the force play . Bell followed with a two @-@ run home run , extending the Cardinals ' lead to 9 – 1 . Chick Hafey lined a double into left field , but Bob O 'Farrell ended the inning by striking out . In the bottom of the seventh inning , the Yankees scored one run on an Earle Combs single to cut the Cardinals ' lead to seven runs . 
 In the eighth inning , Myles Thomas came in to relieve Shocker , who had given up three hits and two unearned runs in less than an inning of work . Meanwhile , Alexander shut down the Yankees offense for the rest of the game . In the top of the ninth inning , the Cardinals increased their lead back to eight runs after Hornsby had an RBI groundout , scoring Southworth . Alexander finished with his second complete game of the series and gave up only two runs on eight hits , while striking out six batters . The three Yankee pitchers combined to give up thirteen hits , seven earned runs , three unearned runs , and one home run .

 Sunday October 10 , 1926 at Yankee Stadium ( I ) in the Bronx , New York 
 The deciding Game 7 was played on October 10 , 1926 , at Yankee Stadium in front of a crowd of 38 @,@ 093 people . The game featured two future Baseball Hall of Famers , who were both winners in their respective pitching appearances earlier in the series . Jesse Haines took to the mound for the Cardinals ; he had pitched in relief in Game 1 and threw a complete game shutout against the Yankees in Game 3 . Waite Hoyt had pitched a complete game 10 – 5 Yankees victory in Game 4 . 
 The Yankees scored the first run of the game in the third inning on a Babe Ruth solo home run into the right field bleachers . In the following half inning , the Cardinals came back to take a 3 – 1 lead over the Yankees . Jim Bottomley lined a one @-@ out single into left field to start the Cardinals ' fourth inning rally . Les Bell just barely made it to first base after shortstop Mark Koenig accidentally kicked the ball while trying to field it . With runners at first and second base , Chick Hafey hit a bloop single into left field , which loaded up the bases for catcher Bob O 'Farrell . This time , left fielder Bob Meusel made an error by dropping O 'Farrell 's fly ball , so Bottomley scored to tie the game , and the bases remained loaded . Tommy Thevenow followed with a two @-@ run single to right fielder Ruth . Hoyt struck out the next batter , and Wattie Holm hit into a force play at second base . All three runs in the inning were charged as unearned on Hoyt , due to the two Yankee errors . 
 In the sixth inning , the Yankees cut the Cardinals lead . With two outs , Joe Dugan hit a single . Hank Severeid followed with a double , scoring Dugan , before pinch @-@ hitter Ben Paschal grounded to Haines to end the inning . Game 1 and 5 winner Herb Pennock came in relief for Hoyt in the seventh inning . He yielded only one hit in the inning and limited the Cardinals to their 3 – 2 lead . In the bottom half of the inning , the Yankees loaded up the bases with Earle Combs , Ruth and Lou Gehrig . At this point , there were two outs , and Haines had developed a blister on his pitching hand , and could no longer pitch in the game . 
 Rogers Hornsby had to determine who he would put in to replace Haines as pitcher . Although Grover Cleveland Alexander had pitched a complete game the day before and may have spent the night drinking , Hornsby decided to trust him after Alexander said he " had it in easy in there " in Game 6 and would be ready whenever Hornsby needed him . The first two pitches thrown by Alexander to batter Tony Lazzeri went for a strike and a ball , respectively . On the third pitch , Lazzeri hit a fly ball down the left field line . The ball initially appeared to be going into the stands for a grand slam , but at the last minute , it curved several feet into the stands in foul territory . Alexander then threw a fastball that Lazzeri swung late at and missed for strike three , ending the inning and the Yankees ' threat . 
 Alexander retired the Yankees in order in the eighth inning . The Cardinals did nothing offensively in the top of the ninth inning , so it was up to Alexander to preserve the Cardinals ' game in the bottom of the ninth . Alexander got the first two batters of the inning , Combs and Dugan , to ground out to third baseman Bell . With two outs and no runners on base , Alexander faced Ruth . Ruth had hit a solo home run and walked three times in the game . Manager Hornsby walked to the mound to talk with Alexander . Alexander told Hornsby that he would rather face Ruth than intentionally walk him . Alexander 's first pitch to Ruth fell in for a solid strike in the middle of the plate . Alexander 's next pitch fell outside of the strike zone for ball one . Ruth then fouled the next pitch , making the count one ball and two strikes . Alexander 's next two pitches fell too low for balls two and three , making it a full count . The following full count pitch was noted by New York Herald Tribune sportswriter W. O. McGeehan : " The count went to three and two , Ruth was swaying eagerly . The <unk> creaked again . The ball seemed a fraction of an inch from being a strike . Ruth paused a moment . Even he was uncertain . Then he trotted down to first . " 
 With two outs and Ruth at first base , left fielder Bob Meusel came up to the plate . Meusel was a .315 hitter that year and had batted in 81 runs in just over 100 regular season games . Meusel also had success in Game 6 against Alexander , with a double and triple . Just as Meusel was about to take his first pitch , Ruth made the bold move of trying to steal second base . Ruth was known as a good but overly aggressive baserunner , with about a 50 % success rate at stealing bases in his career , and his attempt surprised many people throughout the stadium . Meusel swung and missed at the pitch , and Cardinals catcher Bob O 'Farrell immediately threw the ball to second baseman Hornsby . Hornsby reached for the ball , and laid the tag immediately on Ruth . Ruth was out by a good 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) , and the game was over . As the game announcer described it , " Ruth is walked again for the fourth time today . One strike on Bob Meusel . Going down to second ! The game is over ! Babe tried to steal second and is put out catcher to second ! " 
 As Hornsby recalled later , Ruth " didn 't say a word . He didn 't even look around or up at me . He just picked himself up and walked away " . Ruth 's failed attempt to steal second base ended the game and the 1926 World Series ; it is , as of 2014 , the only time a World Series has ended with a runner being caught stealing . Ruth explained later that he attempted to steal second base because he thought no one would expect it . He hoped that by getting to second base , he could have an easier chance at scoring if Meusel hit a single into the outfield . 
 The Cardinals went back home to St. Louis to a rapturous fan reception , having won their first undisputed world championship . Each member of the championship team collected $ 5 @,@ 584 @.@ 51 , while the Yankees ' players were given $ 3 @,@ 417 @.@ 75 each . 
 To date , the Cardinals ' 11 world championships are the most won by any National League team , and rank second only to the Yankees ' 27 . The Cardinals ' and Yankees ' last wins were within two years of each other ( having occurred in 2011 and 2009 , respectively ) . The two teams would meet again in 1928 ( which the Yankees swept in four games ) ; 1942 ( which the Cardinals won in five games ) ; 1943 ( which the Yankees won in five games ) ; and 1964 ( which the Cardinals won in seven games ) . 
 As for the Yankees , Game 7 of the 1926 series marked the last postseason loss for the team in a decade . The Bronx Bombers would go on to sweep their next three World Series , 1927 , 1928 , and 1932 . Their next World Series loss would be Game 1 of the 1936 World Series which the Yankees would eventually win 4 games to 2 .

 = Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd = 
 Lucy Page Mercer Rutherfurd ( April 26 , 1891 – July 31 , 1948 ) was an American woman best known for her affair with US President Franklin D. Roosevelt . 
 Lucy Mercer was born to wealthy parents who lost most of their fortune and separated in the years following her birth . Mercer then worked briefly in a dress store before taking a position as the social secretary of Eleanor Roosevelt , Franklin 's wife , in 1914 . Mercer and Franklin are believed to have begun an affair in mid @-@ 1916 , when she was 25 years old and he was 34 . The relationship was discovered by Eleanor in September 1918 , when she found a packet of their letters when unpacking his luggage upon his return from an inspection trip to the war zone in Europe while Assistant Secretary of the Navy near the end of the First World War in September 1918 . Though Eleanor offered Franklin a divorce and Franklin considered accepting ; political , financial , and familial pressures caused him to remain in the marriage . Franklin terminated the affair and promised not to see Mercer again . 
 Mercer soon married wealthy socialite Winthrop Rutherfurd , ( 1862 – 1944 ) , a widower then in his fifties , but despite her marriage and Franklin 's promise , the two remained in surreptitious , albeit infrequent contact in the three decades that followed . Especially during the War years , Franklin 's daughter Anna Roosevelt Halsted arranged for her father to meet with his former mistress , more frequently after Rutherfurd 's death in 1944 . Mercer was in Warm Springs , Georgia , at the " Little White House " the President 's long @-@ time cottage and retreat , at the time of Roosevelt 's death in April 1945 . He was having his portrait painted , at Mercer 's request , by the artist Elizabeth Shoumatoff in the living room – with Mercer and two female cousins attending . While sitting at a card table by the fireplace , reading an upcoming speech , Roosevelt said , " I have a terrific pain in the back of my head . " He then slumped forward in his chair , unconscious . Madame Shoumatoff , who maintained close friendships with both Roosevelt and Mercer , rushed Mercer away to avoid negative publicity and implications of infidelity . Mercer 's presence in the house was not mentioned in the immediate press reports nor in any of the early published biographies . 
 Lucy died of leukemia on July 31 , 1948 . Despite rumors , her affair with Roosevelt did not become widespread public knowledge until the publication of Jonathan W. Daniels ' 1966 memoir The Time Between the Wars . 
 = = Background = = 
 Born in Washington , D.C. , Lucy Page Mercer was the daughter of Carroll Mercer , ( 1857 – 1917 ) , a member of Theodore Roosevelt 's " Rough Riders " cavalry military unit in the campaigns in Cuba , on the south shore of the island near Santiago during the brief Spanish – American War in 1898 , and Minnie Mercer , ( 1863 – 1947 ) , an independent woman of " Bohemian " exotic , free @-@ spirited tastes . Lucy had one sister , Violetta Carroll Mercer ( 1889 – 1947 ) . Though they were both from wealthy , well @-@ connected families , Mercer 's parents lost their fortune through the Financial Panic of 1893 and subsequent great recession / depression which curtailed their lavish spending . The pair separated shortly after Lucy 's birth , and Carroll became an alcoholic . Minnie then raised the girls alone . 
 = = Affair with Franklin D. Roosevelt = = 
 As a young woman , Lucy Mercer worked in a dress shop . In 1914 , Mercer was hired by Eleanor Roosevelt to become her social secretary . Mercer quickly became an established part of the Roosevelt household , and good friends with Eleanor . According to historians Joseph Persico and Hazel Rowley , the affair between Mercer and Franklin likely began in 1916 , when Eleanor and the children were vacationing at Campobello Island to avoid the summer heat , while Franklin remained in Washington , D.C. In 1917 , Franklin often included Mercer in his summer yachting parties , which Eleanor usually declined to attend . 
 In June 1917 , Mercer quit or was fired from her job with Eleanor and enlisted in the US Navy , which was then mobilizing for World War I. Franklin was at that time the Assistant Secretary of the Navy , and Mercer was assigned to his office . Mercer and Franklin continued to see one another privately , causing widespread gossip in Washington . Alice Roosevelt Longworth — daughter of Theodore Roosevelt , and a cousin of Eleanor 's — encouraged the affair , inviting Mercer and Franklin to dinner together several times . She later commented , " He deserved a good time . ... He was married to Eleanor . " 
 In 1918 , Franklin went on a trip to Europe to inspect naval facilities for the war . When he returned in September , sick with pneumonia in both lungs , Eleanor discovered a packet of love letters from Mercer in his suitcase . Eleanor subsequently offered her husband a divorce . 
 Franklin 's mother , Sara Delano Roosevelt , was adamantly against the idea of divorce , however , as it would mark the end of Franklin 's political career ; she stated that she would cut him off from the family fortune if he chose to do so . Historians have also debated whether , as a Roman Catholic , Mercer would have been willing to marry a divorced man . Eleanor Roosevelt biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook expressed skepticism that this had been a serious obstacle , noting the depth of Mercer 's feelings . Persico also doubts that this was a factor , observing that Mercer 's mother Minnie had divorced and remarried , and that the family had come to Roman Catholicism only recently . 
 In the end , Franklin appears to have told Mercer disingenuously that Eleanor was not willing to grant a divorce . He and Eleanor remained married , and he pledged never to see Mercer again . The Roosevelts ' son James later described the state of the marriage after the incident as " an armed truce that endured until the day he died " . Eleanor later wrote , " I have the memory of an elephant . I can forgive , but never forget . " The incident marked a turning point in her life ; disillusioned with her marriage , she became active in public life , and focused increasingly on her social work rather than her role as a wife . 
 = = Marriage and continued contact with Roosevelt = = 
 Mercer left Washington after the affair and became the governess for the children of Winthrop Rutherfurd , ( 1862 – 1944 ) , a wealthy New York socialite . Winthrop Rutherfurd was famous for winning the heart of socialite / heiress Consuelo Vanderbilt , ( 1877 – 1964 ) , back in 1896 , only to see her social @-@ climbing mother instead force her into marriage with Charles Spencer @-@ Churchill , 9th Duke of Marlborough , ( 1871 – 1934 ) , ( cousin to later British prime minister Winston Churchill ) . Now in his fifties , Rutherfurd was considered one of society 's most eligible widowers . About a year and half later , on February 11 , 1920 , Mercer became his second wife . Franklin Roosevelt learned of the marriage by overhearing news of it at a party . The <unk> had one child , Barbara Mercer Rutherfurd Knowles ( 1922 – 2005 ) . 
 Despite Franklin 's promise to Eleanor , he kept in contact with Lucy Rutherfurd after her marriage , corresponding with her by letter throughout the 1920s . Historian / author Persico speculates that these letters may have been the cause of the 1927 nervous breakdown of Franklin 's long @-@ time unmarried first secretary Marguerite " Missy " LeHand , ( 1898 – 1944 ) , as LeHand was also reputedly in love with Roosevelt and no medical cause for her breakdown was found . 
 In 1926 , Roosevelt mailed Rutherfurd a copy of his first public lecture after his affliction with polio , privately dedicating it to her with an inscription . At his first memorable presidential inauguration on March 4 , 1933 , Roosevelt made arrangements for Rutherfurd to attend and witness his swearing @-@ in . When her husband later suffered a stroke , she contacted Roosevelt to arrange for him to be cared for at well @-@ regarded Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington , D.C. Historian / author Doris Kearns Goodwin speculated that an entry in the White House ushers diary for August 1 , 1941 included a code name for Lucy Rutherfurd , suggesting that she attended a private dinner with the president then . After her husband 's death when the two began seeing each other more occasionally , Rutherfurd also arranged for her friend Elizabeth Shoumatoff , ( 1888 – 1980 ) , a well @-@ known artist , to paint Roosevelt 's portrait . 
 Winthrop Rutherfurd died in March 1944 after a long illness . Lucy continued to meet with Roosevelt in the months that followed more frequently . In June 1944 , Franklin requested of his daughter Anna , who was then managing some White House social functions and acting as hostess , that she help him arrange to meet Lucy without Eleanor 's knowledge . Aware of Rutherfurd 's role in her parents ' early marriage , Anna was at first angry that her father had put her in such a difficult position . However , she ultimately relented and set up a meeting in Georgetown . To her surprise , Anna found that she liked Lucy immediately , and the pair became friends . There were supposedly several dinners in the White House 's second floor private quarters during Roosevelt 's last year which were attended by Rutherfurd in a group with Anna 's presence and obvious acceptance . When Eleanor discovered shortly after FDR 's death from the female cousins of Anna 's role in arranging for these meetings , the relationship between Eleanor and Anna became strained and cool for some time . 
 In early April 1945 , Anna arranged for Rutherfurd to come over from her South Carolina estate in Aiken to meet her father at his " Little White House " in Warm Springs , Georgia , the small plain rustic cottage built at the polio therapy center by the heated mineral water springs resort that Roosevelt helped develop beginning in the 1920s . Rutherfurd and Shoumatoff along with two female cousins were sitting there as the artist worked on her painting of FDR as he sat at a card table by the living room stone fireplace , fine @-@ tuning a future speech and reading over some other papers on the early afternoon of April 12 , 1945 . In this quiet domestic scene as the two had just been smiling at each other , Roosevelt suddenly placed his hand up on his forehead and temple , saying " I have a terrific headache " , then slumped over losing consciousness . Later his two doctors called in quickly said he suffered a fatal cerebral hemorrhage . Since a thorough medical exam a year before , which he had been under increasing more intensive care and concern by the young recently recruited private physician in his last year . The two women , Mercer and Shoumatoff immediately packed and left the cottage . Eleanor nonetheless soon later learned the truth from the cousins and felt doubly betrayed to learn of her daughter 's role in the long @-@ time deception . Finding Shoumatoff 's unfinished preliminary watercolor among Franklin 's possessions some time later however , she mailed it to Rutherfurd , to which Rutherfurd responded with a warm letter of thanks and condolences . 
 In 1947 , Rutherfurd 's sister Violetta committed suicide after her husband requested a divorce . Mercer / Rutherfurd herself died from leukemia at the young age of 57 on July 31 , 1948 , just 3 @-@ 1 / 4 years later after FDR , having destroyed almost all of her correspondence with Franklin . Rutherfurd is buried along with her husband in Green Township , New Jersey . 
 = = Public revelation of affair = = 
 Following Roosevelt 's death , his administration concealed from the press the fact that Rutherfurd had been present during his death , fearing the scandal that would ensue . Shoumatoff 's presence became known , and she gave a press conference to address questions , but managed to hide Rutherfurd 's role and was even not mentioned in early post @-@ war biographies and administration histories for almost two decades . Roosevelt 's second private secretary Grace Tully , ( 1900 @-@ 1984 ) , who had also been at Warm Springs for his death , did briefly mention Rutherfurd 's presence in " <unk> , My Boss " , her 1949 memoir , but gave no further hint of the relationship . Though it was reported several times in Eleanor 's lifetime that Roosevelt had had a serious affair with an unnamed Catholic woman , this remained only a rumor for decades . 
 The Mercer @-@ Roosevelt affair became wider public knowledge in 1966 , when revealed in " The Time Between the Wars " , a memoir of the decades 1920s and 1930s , written by Jonathan W. Daniels , ( 1902 @-@ 1981 ) , a former Roosevelt aide from 1943 to 1945 . When the news of the memoir 's contents broke , Franklin Delano Roosevelt , Jr . , ( 1914 @-@ 1988 ) , said that he had no knowledge of an affair between Rutherfurd and his father , while Rutherfurd 's daughter Barbara flatly denied that any such romance had occurred . Well @-@ known historian / author Arthur Schlesinger Jr . , ( 1917 @-@ 2007 ) , stated of the affair that if Rutherfurd " in any way helped Franklin Roosevelt sustain the frightful burdens of leadership in the second world war , the nation has good reason to be grateful to her " .

 = Papal election , 1130 = 
 The papal election of February 14 , 1130 was convoked after the death of Pope Honorius II and resulted in a double election . Part of the cardinals , led by Cardinal @-@ Chancellor Aymeric de la Chatre , elected Gregorio Papareschi as Pope Innocent II , but the rest of them refused to recognize him and elected Cardinal Pietro Pierleoni , who took the name of Anacletus II . Although Anacletus had the support of the majority of the cardinals , the Catholic Church considers Innocent II as the legitimate Pope , and Anacletus II as Antipope . 
 The double election was a result of the growing tensions inside the College of Cardinals concerning the policy of the Holy See towards the Holy Roman Empire , initiated by the Concordat of Worms ( 1122 ) , which ended the investiture controversy . Several , particularly older , cardinals considered the compromise achieved in Worms as desertion of the principles of the Gregorian Reform , and inclined to accept it only as a tactical move . They supported the traditional alliance of the Papacy with the Normans in southern Italy . Some of them were connected to old monastic centers in Southern Italy such as Montecassino . One of their leaders was Cardinal Pierleoni , representative of one of the most powerful families of Rome . 
 The opposite faction was headed by Aymeric de la Chatre , who was named cardinal and chancellor of the Holy See shortly after signing the Concordat of Worms and was one of the main architects of the new policy . He and his adherents looked at the compromise as a good solution both for the Church and the Emperor , and did not trust the Norman vassals of the Holy See , who expressed some expansionist tendencies . It seems that at least some major representatives of this faction had strong connections to the " new spirituality " , meaning the new religious orders such as regular canons . Besides , they were allied with the Roman family of Frangipani , opponents of the Pierleoni family . 
 In the last weeks of the lifetime of Pope Honorius II the cardinals , fearing the possible schism , made an agreement that the new pope would be elected by the commission of eight of them , including two cardinal @-@ bishops , three cardinal @-@ priests and three cardinal @-@ deacons . 
 = = Cardinals = = 
 The College of Cardinals had probably 43 ( or 42 ) members in February 1130 . It seems that no more than 37 ( 36 ) were present at Rome on the death of Honorius II : 
 Probably six cardinals were absent from Rome : 
 = = Preparations for the election = = 
 Both parties of the College of Cardinals were of almost an equal size . The party of Aymeric had 19 members , while that of his opponents 24 , but the party of the Chancellor was certainly better organized . 
 One of the undeniable aspects of that division is that the <unk> were mainly older cardinals , veterans of the investiture controversy , created either by <unk> II or early in the pontificate of Callixtus II , while <unk> cardinals with few exceptions were created after Concordat of Worms ( 1122 ) , which established peace with the Emperor . Out of nineteen cardinals created before 1122 , only five supported the Chancellor , while out of twenty four appointed from that time onwards as many as fourteen . The other possible reasons for such radical tensions in the College ( e.g. national divisions , connections to different spiritual centres ) are widely discussed by historians without final conclusion . 
 In the elected committee the party of Aymeric had 5 members out 8 . This was due to the way of their election – each of the three <unk> orders had to elect their own representatives . Although adherents of Aymeric were in the minority in the whole College , they had a majority among cardinal @-@ bishops and cardinal @-@ deacons , while their opponents were mainly cardinal @-@ priests . Therefore , the faction of the Chancellor acquired a majority in the electoral body 
 The following cardinals were elected to the committee ( the opponents of Aymeric are denoted with † ) : 
 Cardinal @-@ Bishops ( two adherents of Aymeric ) 
 Guillaume , Bishop of Palestrina 
 Corrado della <unk> , Bishop of Sabina 
 Cardinal @-@ Priests ( two opponents and one adherent of Aymeric )

 = = Death of Honorius II and the election of Innocent II = = 
 Honorius II died in the night 13 / 14 February 1130 in the Roman monastery of S. Gregorio , after a long illness . Cardinal Aymeric arranged a hasty burial there and immediately called the members of the committee to the monastery to proceed for the election of a new pope . But Cardinals Pierleoni and Gionata , realising that the commission certainly would elect a supporter of the Chancellor , withdrew from it hoping that a lack of quorum would prevent it from functioning . But Aymeric ignored this fact and the commission assembled with six members only . Despite the protests of Cardinal Pietro Pisano , who was a distinguished canonist , the committee elected one of its members , Cardinal Gregorio Papareschi of S. Angelo , who accepted the election and took the name Innocent II . He was enthroned in the Lateran Basilica early in the morning on February 14 . His election was almost immediately recognized by six other cardinals : two bishops ( Giovanni of Ostia and Mathieu of Albano ) and four priests ( <unk> of S. Cecilia , Petrus of S. Anastasia and Giovanni of S. Crisogono ; the identity of the fourth one is uncertain , but most probably it was Gerardo of S. Croce ) . In a short time they were joined also by the next eight cardinals .

 The majority of the cardinals , however , did not recognize Innocent II under the influence of Pietro Pisano , who , as a distinguished canonist , declared that his election was invalid . On February 14 in the morning the opponents of Aymeric and his candidate assembled under the leadership of Pietro Pierleoni in the church of S. Marco to elect the new Pope . Initially , Cardinal Pierleoni proposed the election of the Dean of the College Pietro Senex of Porto , but he refused to accept the papal dignity . Then the cardinals unanimously elected Pierleoni himself , who took the name of Anacletus II . 
 It is not known how many cardinals elected Anacletus II . The decree proclaiming his election issued on the same day was subscribed by 14 cardinals : 
 Bishop Pietro Senex of Porto , 
 Priests Gregorio de <unk> of SS . Apostoli , Saxo of S. Stefano , Pietro of S. Marcello , Comes of S. Sabina , Gregorio of S. Balbina , <unk> of SS . Marcellino e Pietro , <unk> of S. Vitale , Pietro Pisano of S. Susanna , Matteo of S. Pietro in Vincoli and Enrico of S. <unk> , 
 Deacons Gregorio of S. Eustachio , Gionata of SS . Cosma e Damiano and Angelo of S. Maria in Domnica . 
 It is not known whether the remaining five adherents of Pierleoni , who are believed to have been present at Rome , participated in the electoral proceedings . There is no doubt , however , that the lesser clergy of Rome was represented in the election . The electoral decree of Anacletus II bears the subscriptions of some of them , including <unk> Gregorio , <unk> scholae <unk> , who was appointed Cardinal @-@ Deacon of S. Maria in Aquiro the following February 21 , and <unk> , Archpriest of the Patriarchal Liberian Basilica . 
 = = Division of the College of Cardinals = = 
 The double election resulted with the open split of the College of Cardinals into two parties . Their compositions can be established in the following way : 
 Liber Pontificalis mentions the names of 16 cardinals who supported Innocent II from the very beginning . To them should be added two other cardinals ( Guido of Tivoli and Rustico of S. Ciriaco ) , whose attitude is attested by the fact that they subscribed the bulls of Innocent II . 
 The obedience of Anacletus II may be reconstructed basing on the letter addressed to king Lothair III of Germany by his cardinals soon after his coronation . This letter bears the subscriptions of 27 cardinals , including five created by Anacletus II on February 21 , a Friday of the ember week . To them should be added also cardinal Oderisio of S. Agata , who later subscribed the bulls issued by Anacletus II . 
 Therefore , at the beginning of the schism 18 cardinals belonged to the College of Innocent II , and 28 to the College of Anacletus II . 
 The <unk> cardinals , who are not mentioned by Liber Pontificalis , and the <unk> , who did not subscribe the letter to king Lothair , are denoted with † . 
 Stefano <unk> joined the obedience of Innocent II no later than 1132 ; <unk> of S. Vitale and Giovanni <unk> did the same in 1133 , Pietro Pisano in 1137 , and Desiderio of S. <unk> shortly before the end of the schism in 1138 . It seems that ca . 1135 Comes of S. Sabina also abandoned Anacletus II . 
 = = The schism = = 
 Both popes were consecrated and crowned on the same day , February 23 . Innocent II received episcopal consecration from Cardinal Giovanni of Ostia in the church S. Maria Nuova , the titular <unk> of Chancellor Aymeric . Anacletus II was consecrated by Cardinal Pietro of Porto in the Vatican Basilica , which means that Anacletus took the advantage in the city from the very beginning . Almost all Roman aristocracy ( with the significant exception of the Frangipani family ) , the majority of the lesser clergy and the people of Rome recognized Anacletus II and at the end of May Innocent II had to flee to France . After his defection to France even the Frangipani submitted to Anacletus . 
 In France , however , Innocent II found a strong ally in the person of Bernard of Clairvaux . Under Bernard ’ s influence , almost all European monarchs and episcopates recognized the exiled Innocent II . Anacletus II , although he controlled Rome and the Patrimony of St. Peter , received the support only of the Normans of southern Italy , Scotland , Aquitaine , some cities in northern Italy ( incl . Milan ) , and perhaps Outremer and probably also Poland . 
 Both elections were irregular , because they contradicted the rules established by the decree In Nomine Domini in 1059 , but both sides defended the legality of the respective pontificates . The adherents of Anacletus argued that he was elected by the majority of the cardinals , lower clergy and the people of Rome . The partisans of Innocent II answered that Innocent II was elected by majority of the cardinal @-@ bishops , who according to the decree In Nomine Domini had to play the preeminent role in the election . Their opponents answered with another version of the decree ( false , but very popular at the time ) , which stated that the pope was elected by " cardinals " ( meaning cardinal @-@ priests and deacons ) , while cardinal @-@ bishops could only express their approval or disapproval . Both parties used , by analogy , the Benedictine rule , which stated that in the case of a double election for abbot , the valid election was the one made by " the sounder part " ( <unk> pars ) of the electors – but there was no consensus which part of the College was " sounder " in this case . 
 Decisive for the verdict about the legality of both pontificates were not the legal arguments , but the attitude of the Catholic world , which had almost universally recognized Innocent II . His main supporters were Abbot Bernard of Clairvaux , Archbishop of Magdeburg Norbert of Xanten and King Lothair III of Germany . The few secular lords who had initially supported Anacletus gradually abandoned his cause as lost ; only King Roger II of Sicily , who had received the crown from Anacletus in exchange for support , stood at his side to the very end . Although Anacletus II was able to retain the control of the city of Rome and the Patrimony of St. Peter until his death in January 1138 , his successor quickly made his submission to Innocent II , who is now regarded as true Pope .

 The 2012 AutoZone Liberty Bowl was a post @-@ season American college football bowl game held on December 31 , 2012 at the Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis , Tennessee in the United States . The 54th edition of the Liberty Bowl began at 2 : 30 p.m. CST and aired on ESPN . It featured the Iowa State Cyclones from the Big 12 Conference against the Conference USA champion Tulsa Golden Hurricane and was the final game of the 2012 NCAA Division I FBS football season for both teams . The Golden Hurricane advanced to the game by virtue of winning the 2012 Conference USA Football Championship Game , while the Cyclones were also eligible for the bowl game due to their 6 – 6 regular @-@ season record . The two teams had previously met on September 1 at the Cyclones ' home of Jack Trice Stadium in Ames , Iowa ; Iowa State won that game , 38 – 23 . 
 The pre @-@ game buildup was primarily focused on the rematch . A slight plurality of experts picked Tulsa over Iowa State , but most predicted the game to be very close . Tulsa was considered a strong running team with a solid defense , while Iowa State was balanced offensively and struggled at times on defense . This was the only rematch of the 2012 @-@ 13 college bowl season . 
 Tulsa won the game by a score of 31 – 17 , led by Trey Watts ' 25 rush , 149 yard effort along with a three @-@ touchdown effort by Alex Singleton . Iowa State lost their quarterback , Sam Richardson , due to a " flu bug " in the fourth quarter . After Iowa State took a 17 – 3 lead , Tulsa scored 28 unanswered points to win 31 – 17 .

 On November 30 , Louisiana Tech was invited to play in the Independence Bowl but asked for more time as they were in negotiations with the Liberty Bowl and Heart of Dallas Bowl . Louisiana Tech athletic director Bruce Van De Velde and WAC commissioner Jeff Hurd both claimed that on December 1 , the Liberty Bowl executive director Steve Ehrhart guaranteed the Bulldogs a bowl invite . After the Independence Bowl 's deadline for Louisiana Tech to accept their invitation passed , the Independence Bowl selected the MAC 's Ohio ( 8 – 4 ) instead . On December 2 , the Liberty Bowl extended their remaining bid to Iowa State ( 6 – 6 ) instead of Louisiana Tech ( 9 – 3 ) . The Liberty Bowl did not respond to The Times ' request for comment on the situation . Louisiana Tech did not end up playing in any bowl game despite boasting the nation 's top scoring offense . 
 Iowa State and Tulsa previously met on September 1 , 2012 in Ames , Iowa . After taking a 16 – 7 lead , Tulsa gave up their lead allowing Iowa State to score 24 unanswered points . Iowa State went on to win 38 – 23 .

 = Coat of arms of Pichilemu = 
 The coat of arms of Pichilemu ( Spanish : Escudo de armas de Pichilemu ) is the official heraldic symbol representing the city of Pichilemu , the capital of the Chilean province of Cardenal Caro . It consists of a party per cross referencing the importance of tourism in Pichilemu , and the commune 's agricultural , <unk> origins . The coat of arms is crested with a " symbolical representation of Pichilemu 's past and present : a <unk> fused in a mitre " , worn by José María Caro Rodríguez , the first Cardinal of the Chilean Roman Catholic Church , who was born in the village of San Antonio de Petrel , in Pichilemu . 
 In September 1986 , the municipality of Pichilemu and the Council of Communal Development ( CODECO ) made a public call for tenders to create a coat of arms for the commune , similar to that of the province of Cardenal Caro . A design made by Hernán Martínez Morales from Curicó was eventually adopted by the local government on 19 December 1986 , under the administration of Mayor René Maturana Maldonado . 
 The original date inscribed in the coat of arms , " 21 @-@ XII 1891 " ( 21 December 1891 ) , prompted criticism from local historians Antonio Saldías and José Arraño Acevedo , who have pointed out it is " incorrect " . Saldías has suggested to commemorate the first municipal meeting of 6 May 1894 , or the grant of the title of encomienda of Topocalma on 24 January 1544 , for example . 
 = = Origin = = 
 During the earlier years of the municipal administration of Pichilemu by Mayor René Maturana Maldonado ( 1984 – 92 ) , the municipality made use of a drawing resembling a sun as the official logo and seal , which was used in official documents . 
 In September 1986 , the local government and the Council of Communal Development ( Consejo de Desarrollo Comunal , CODECO ) made a public call for tenders to create a coat of arms for the commune , with the purpose of " counting with a symbolic expression of representativeness , and to exalt distinctive features of the area and its people , " adding that they were " seeking a coat of arms similar , but not identical to that of the province of Cardenal Caro . " Participants could send as many designs as they wanted , as far as it included the name of the commune and the date of its creation , 21 December 1891 . Authors could add a motto and an inscription to their coat of arms if they wanted to . An article in local newspaper Pichilemu stated that the new coat of arms was to be chosen by a jury composed of the mayor of Pichilemu , the director of Municipal Works , two members of the CODECO , a representative of the culture department of the regional secretariat of the Education Ministry , an artist , and a teacher . The eventual winner would earn a prize of 100 @,@ 000 pesos , and a diploma . Once past the deadline , set for 31 October 1986 , the jury had a month to make a decision . 
 The winning design for coat of arms of Pichilemu was announced in December 1986 . It was created by Hernán Martínez Morales from Curicó , Region of the Maule , who was described in the Pichilemu edition of that month as a " fan ( of Pichilemu ) , and regular vacationer " in the city . He told the newspaper he took knowledge of the public call made by the local government by reading a previous edition of Pichilemu ; Martínez requested the municipality for more details on his Fiestas <unk> holiday , and sent a design " with a lot of faith . " Martínez Morales was , at the time , a student of graphic design at the University of Valparaíso . His design was adopted by decree of mayor René Maturana Maldonado on 19 December 1986 as the official coat of arms of the commune of Pichilemu in a public ceremony . 
 = = Description = = 
 The shield is divided party per cross : that is , it is divided in four equal parts . The first quarter is or , and the remaining are bleu celeste . According to descriptions by the designer of the coat of arms , Hernán Martínez Morales , in the December 1986 edition of Pichilemu , the forest and sea quarter , which has a yellow background , portrays " the richness of the area , its potential ; " the <unk> boards quarter , which like the two remaining quarters has a sky blue background , depicts the tourism in Pichilemu , water sports , and " the exceptional conditions for their practice ; " the sea quarter represents " the men who work at the sea , in a symbolic manner ; " the fourth quarter represents the local agriculture , " with the country and a spur . " 
 The name of the commune , Pichilemu is written in the upper side of the coat of arms , while the date of creation of the commune is located in the lower side ( " 22 @-@ XII 1891 " , originally had incorrectly inscribed " 21 @-@ XII 1891 " ) . The crest , according to its designer , " symbolically represents the past and future " of Pichilemu , with " a balustrade that fuses with a mitre " , worn by the first Chilean Cardinal of the Catholic Church José María Caro Rodríguez , who was born in the Pichilemu village of San Antonio de Petrel , to Rita Rodríguez Cornejo and José María Caro Martínez , the first mayor of Pichilemu . 
 Martínez described the colors used in his creation , beginning with the yellow , which " represents the sun , the light and the warmth of a welcoming place . Sun which stays in Pichilemu to make us spend beautiful moments . " The green color and its tones represent the " forest , economic potential of the area , which augurs the countryman a promising future . " He described the blue color and its tones used in the coat of arms as " speaking of the sea off the coast of Pichilemu , sea that is present in every moment of our stay in Pichilemu . Sea that is richness and that ' promises us a future splendor ' . " Martínez used the red color to represent " the tourism along all colors , happiness , vacations , sport , " while described the use of greenish gray as the " touch of distinction , elegance , nobleness . " 
 = = = Possibly inappropriate date = = = 
 Concerns were raised by Antonio Saldías ( pen name Don Antonio de Petrel ) regarding the appropriateness of the date used to celebrate the anniversary of Pichilemu , which commemorated the creation of the commune , on 21 December 1891 , a date also used in the coat of arms . Saldías pointed out that , since there was no act of foundation of Pichilemu nor record of date of the first inhabitation of the area by the Promaucaes , the date of 24 January 1544 , specified in the title of encomienda of Topocalma given by Spanish conquistador Pedro de Valdivia to Juan Gómez de Almagro , another conquistador , was the most correct date to be used to commemorate the anniversary of Pichilemu . The current territory of Pichilemu was part of the encomienda of Topocalma . 
 Later , in a March 1987 article for Pichilemu , Saldías condemned the use of an " incorrect " date in the coat of arms , stating that all Chilean communes were created on 22 December 1891 and not on 21 December , as it appeared in the coat of arms . The historian wrote that " Pichilemu possesses its own events , many of them with more valid and rightful dates [ ... ] . But overall , very ours , " and went on to suggest some " more appropriate dates " for the coat of arms and the anniversary of Pichilemu , including : the grant of the Topocalma encomienda title , the date of the purchase of the current territory of central Pichilemu by Daniel Ortúzar Cuevas ( 1884 ) , the date of purchase of the " rustic farm " of San Antonio de Petrel by Agustín Ross Edwards ( 5 September 1885 ) , the <unk> de tierra of Cáhuil given to Leonor de la Corte ( 1609 ) , the <unk> de tierra of San Antonio de Petrel given to Francisco Rojas y Puebla ( 1611 ) , the date of the first municipal meeting of Pichilemu ( 6 May 1894 ) . 
 In September 1987 , local journalist and historian José Arraño Acevedo said after declining the <unk> 11 de Septiembre ( 11 September Award ) award given by the Municipality of Pichilemu that his nomination was an " <unk> " , " when I have gone to the municipality to tell them that they have committed an error by using a wrong date in the official coat of arms of the commune , and although I have spoken with reasonings , they have not heard me .

Ali <unk> , deputy head of the Turkish aviation authority , said initial information indicated there was no technical malfunction on the plane . 
 There is confusion as to the whereabouts of the aircraft 's Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder ( FDR and CVR , commonly referred to as " black boxes " ) . The Turkish Foreign Ministry stated they have been shipped to Antonov 's Kiev headquarters , but Turkish Minister of Transportation <unk> <unk> claims they are still in Iraq , with the rest of the debris . All that is confirmed is that they have been recovered , which occurred on 30 January .

 Schwa is an acclaimed , upscale restaurant run by chef @-@ owner Michael Carlson in Chicago , United States . It is located in the West Town community area and is considered a leader in the molecular gastronomy style of cooking . Schwa is known for its unconventional approach to business . Simple table settings match the building 's drab exterior and its tiny 26 @-@ seat interior . The restaurant employs no support staff of any kind . Chefs interact directly with customers and are encouraged to act as silly as they wish , as long as they produce top quality food . 
 Opening in 2005 , Schwa quickly drew local and national attention resulting in a large backlog of reservations . In 2007 , Schwa was chosen to host the opening night of Charlie Trotter 's 20th anniversary celebration . The evening was considered a success , but placed a great deal of stress on Carlson , causing him to close Schwa the following day . After a four @-@ month hiatus Schwa returned , much to the delight of local culinary enthusiasts , or " foodies " . 
 Schwa 's menu is known for unusual ingredients and innovative food combinations , such as Carlson 's version of pad Thai made with jellyfish tentacles instead of noodles . The quail egg ravioli is considered the restaurant 's signature dish . 
 Schwa has received positive reviews from both local and national critics . It has received three star to three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half star ratings from the Chicago Tribune , Chicago magazine , and the Mobil Travel Guide . BlackBook Magazine says Schwa features " some of the best food you will ever consume " , while famed chef Grant <unk> lists it among his personal favorite places to eat . Several critics have stated that below @-@ average service prevents the restaurant from getting a higher rating . Schwa made Citysearch 's Top 10 New Restaurants of 2006 and New York magazine 's Grub Street blog ranked it among the five hardest reservations to score in the country . In 2009 , Schwa made Frommer 's international list of 500 exceptional restaurants . 
 = = Description = = 
 Schwa is a tiny , 825 square feet ( 76 @.@ 6 m2 ) restaurant located in the Wicker Park neighborhood of Chicago , Illinois . Seating 26 , it features what chef Michael Carlson describes as a " pared @-@ down " approach to food and has been described as being on the forefront of a new " molecular gastronomy " style of cooking . The menu is short and constantly changing . Writing for the Chicago Sun Times , <unk> <unk> calls dinner at Schwa " a window into Carlson 's own brain – laser @-@ focused on food with little time for anything else . " Unlike typical upscale restaurants , Schwa does not have a wine list , a liquor license , or even <unk> . 
 The pared @-@ down approach can also be seen in the way the business is run . Carlson maintains a staff of only four people to run his restaurant – himself and three other chefs . Schwa has no receptionist , waiters , or other support staff . Schwa 's chefs do every job in the restaurant ranging from taking orders to busing tables . Tables are small , simple , and have none of the usual restaurant amenities – no flowers , candles , salt , or pepper . The decor is minimalist , and the kitchen is viewable by patrons in the dining room . 
 Even the building itself is minimalistic . One observer described it as " so understated that [ it ] is easy to miss even when one is looking for it " , while another said " pass by and you might think it 's the home of a batty husband and wife who rarely go outside " . The building has a dirty awning and cheap blinds that give the impression the business is closed for remodeling . Schwa is surrounded by dingy buildings and a tire store featuring plastic palm trees . 
 In line with its minimalistic tendencies , Schwa serves a maximum of 32 customers a night ( often leaving the dining room half empty ) , with staggered seating so that only one table is ordering at any time . Arriving guests are typically greeted with Carlson 's trademark salutation : " How you cats doing tonight ? " He enjoys casual interaction with his customers , such as calling his dishes " awesome " and " badass " . Instead of the soft background music typical of an upscale restaurant , guests are treated to loud hip @-@ hop or heavy metal music . One customer called Schwa " a nice change from all the corporate restaurants " . 
 One complaint many customers have with Schwa is that it is exceedingly difficult to get a reservation . GQ magazine describes a typical customer as having spent weeks trying to get past the always full answering machine that serves as Schwa 's primary reservation system . The restaurant attracts an estimated 60 requests for its 26 seats each day , and is notoriously slow at returning phone calls . One couple got so frustrated with the system that they drove down to the restaurant to make a reservation in person . Upon arrival , they were told they had to call it in . Despite their frustration , the couple kept trying and when they finally got in they remarked , " You know what ? It was worth it . " According to Carlson , most customers ' first comment when they arrive at Schwa is either to complain about how difficult it was to get a reservation or to ask for another one . Schwa will not seat customers without a reservation , even if the restaurant is empty . 
 The work environment at Schwa is also relaxed . Carlson allows his employees to act goofy and talk however they like , as long as they produce high @-@ quality food . There is no dress code ; one reporter remarked that the staff looked like a bunch of <unk> . Carlson and his all @-@ male staff work long hours ( 16- to 18 @-@ hour workdays ) for below @-@ average pay . 
 The casual environment at Schwa attracts a diverse clientele , including many local chefs . Carlson says he does not care about etiquette or attire , but will not tolerate rudeness . " If anybody acts as though they expect to be catered to , they 're in the wrong place , " he says . Carlson adds that he is not afraid to tell a customer off if they deserve it . One reporter observed that Schwa couldn 't possibly " do less to <unk> customers or filter out undesirable ones . " Schwa does not cater to families , offering no <unk> and few tables capable of seating more than two people . 
 According to Carlson , Schwa struggles to break even in most weeks . Salaries at Schwa are modest , but food costs make up an astronomical 60 % of the take @-@ in . Carlson has said he would rather cook and run his restaurant the way he wants than make money , and has rejected buyout offers and calls for expansion . 
 = = History = = 
 In the fall of 2005 , chef Michael Carlson was approached by an old friend who owned a small restaurant named Lovitt . The friend was moving out of state and offered to sell Carlson his location and equipment for a bargain price . With financial support from his father , Carlson took over Lovitt and renamed the restaurant after the neutral , unstressed vowel schwa ( ə ) , a name he says reflects his " pared @-@ down " approach to food . 
 Schwa opened September 10 , 2005 , with Carlson promising unstressed food and a laid back attitude . Initially , the restaurant was staffed only by Carlson and his sous chef Nathan <unk> . 
 Carlson said his aim with Schwa was to " push the culinary envelope , " while using seasonal , organic ingredients . The Chicago Tribune noted Schwa 's initial menu did just that , featuring " a soft @-@ boiled organic egg coated in brioche , served with potato puree and Illinois sturgeon caviar " . Within weeks , the restaurant had garnered a strong buzz among local foodies . National press attention quickly followed , including Carlson receiving " Best New Chef " honors from Food & Wine magazine , as Schwa earned a reputation for great food and an innovative chef @-@ customer relationship . By early 2007 , Schwa was receiving 100 calls a day and had a three @-@ month @-@ long waiting list for reservations . 
 One food critic attributed Schwa 's early attention to its unusual combination of " culinary alchemy " and " straightforward Italian cuisine " . Another observer said Schwa was " all about casual sophistication " . A Metromix review called the restaurant " <unk> 's punk @-@ rock little brother . " 
 On October 5 , 2007 , Carlson hosted a gathering of world @-@ famous chefs at Schwa as part of Charlie Trotter 's 20th anniversary celebration . The evening was a success , but the next morning Carlson abruptly closed Schwa " indefinitely " and left town . He later said that he had burned out from working too hard – 18 @-@ hour days were not uncommon – and needed a break and explained that he and his crew had been " talking about closing for weeks , but [ knew they ] just had to do [ the Trotter ] dinner " first . Additionally , Schwa was low on cash and struggling to keep the bills paid . 
 After Schwa closed , about ten different Chicago restaurant owners offered to help Carlson get back on his feet . Carlson declined their help , but reopened Schwa four months later in mid @-@ February 2008 , thanks in part to a cash infusion from his father . He hired an additional chef , allowing him to focus more of his attention on the dining room . The menu was redone , with only the three most popular dishes – the quail egg ravioli , the jellyfish pad Thai , and the " pine cone " dessert – returning . The decor was also tweaked . Customers with old , unfulfilled reservations were given the opportunity to try the new Schwa before new reservations were accepted . 
 Schwa 's buzz , and customers , quickly returned . By May 2008 , it was routine for the restaurant 's voice mail to reach capacity because of the large number of people trying to get reservations ( and the restaurant 's lack of a receptionist ) . Shortly after its relaunch , one food critic described Schwa as even better than before , saying it was an " Oscar @-@ worthy redemption story . " 
 Later in 2008 , Michelle Obama ate at the restaurant . Carlson joked that it was good thing that Barack did not join her : " I don 't think the twenty extra Secret Service agents needed would have fit " . 
 = = Menu = = 
 Schwa offers a three @-@ course dinner for $ 55 and an eight- to ten @-@ course " <unk> " ( taster ) menu for $ 110 . The latter option could be described as " chef 's choice " – on any given night , Carlson prepares courses of his choosing which make up the <unk> menu for that evening . Add @-@ ons are also available . Approximately 85 % of customers prefer the nine @-@ course option , as it is officially called . 
 Portions at Schwa are said to be " small and intentionally artful . " Dishes available change frequently , as Carlson becomes bored and moves on to something new . " If he 's bored with something , no matter how many people love it and demand it , he 's done with it , " notes his girlfriend . 
 The menu at Schwa is hard to classify . Schwa chef Jonathan Ory describes it as " modern American " , but sous @-@ chef Gaetano <unk> disagrees : " I don 't think it 's contemporary American , not at all . " Food critic Alan Richman describes it as " one of a kind ... earnest , innocent , irresistible , and imaginative " . The menu is famous for using sophisticated ingredients to create , as one critic put it , " poetic courses " . Surprising ingredients such as jellyfish , roe , tongue , and offal are found in a large number of dishes , as are unusual combinations such as oysters and oatmeal . No portion of the meal is spared from experimentation ; tomato sorbet finds its way into the salad , while the consommé soup features melon pieces . 
 Despite the large number of unusual dishes , Schwa is perhaps best known for Carlson 's simple , modern interpretation of Italian classics . Among the most popular dishes is the quail egg ravioli , which has been on the menu since day one . Considered the restaurant 's signature dish , it consists of a single ravioli stuffed with quail egg yolk and laced with truffle butter . Schwa is known for emphasizing locally grown produce , and many dishes feature organic ingredients . However , The Local Beet ( a website that promotes eating locally grown food ) questioned Schwa 's commitment to the principle , noting the use of out @-@ of @-@ season strawberries and peas . Most dishes are served with <unk> . 
 Also among Schwa 's best known dishes is the sweetbread dessert . Combining caramelized sweetbreads with vanilla bean – parsnip custard , the dish has been described as " unequivocally adored " . Other notable dishes include pad Thai made with jellyfish instead of noodles , antelope meat dusted with curry powder and coated with white chocolate pudding , " pine cones " ( sea urchin ice cream served in pine @-@ flavored cones ) , and something Carlson calls " onion glue " . Innovative drinks , such as beet juice flavored with bacon , are also available . However , Schwa does not serve bread or wine . Customers wishing wine are required to bring their own , although Carlson will offer suggestions of what to bring upon request . 
 = = Reputation = = 
 Schwa has received positive reviews from the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , Chicago Tribune , Frommer 's , and GQ , among others . In 2006 , Phil Vettel of the Chicago Tribune described the food as four @-@ star quality , while giving the restaurant an overall rating of three stars ( out of four ) because of below @-@ average service . Vettel added that nearly every item on the menu is " wonderful " . Vettel returned to Schwa after the 2008 relaunch and concluded " Schwa is at least as good as it was in its early days , and probably better " . He credited Carlson 's increased focus on the dining room for the improvement , and maintained Schwa 's three @-@ star rating . 
 In the Daily Herald , Jennifer Olvera wrote that Schwa 's original menu was " a culinary affair " and that seafood @-@ lovers would leave Schwa " gushing " . She described dishes as " refreshing and interesting , " " visually stunning " , and " [ begging ] to be savored " , but was not completely satisfied . She found the portions to be small and pricey , and the service to be rather poor , bordering on rude . " They need to get past the pomp and focus on the issue at hand " , she said . A Chicago magazine reviewer remarked that the cooking was " superbly inventive " and that Carlson wowed him with " tasty stunts ... [ that ] knock your socks off " . 
 Writing about Schwa 's post @-@ relaunch menu , Metromix dining producer Chris <unk> writes , " It 's [ even ] better now – dishes are more focused , yet still inventive . Presentation is better . Quality is more consistent . Chef @-@ servers are ( slightly ) more approachable . " <unk> did find some fault during his visit , describing the china as " monotonous " and saying the chef @-@ waiters " always dash off too quickly . " Martha Bayne of Chicago Reader , also writing about the post @-@ relaunch menu , agreed saying , " the food is better than ever . " Bayne called the food " legendary " , but did say the jellyfish pad Thai did not " quite live up to their promise " . Her favorite dish of the night was the sweetbreads dessert , which she described as " salty , savory , sweet , and deliriously complex , it shoots for the moon and succeeds by confounding every expectation . " 
 Chicago magazine gives Schwa three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars ( out of four ) , saying " count on OK service but brilliant food " and an experience that " defies the norm . " Alan Richman of GQ writes " I did not taste one bite of food ... that was prepared imprecisely ... plates are filled with flavors out to the edge of the rim , " while BlackBook Magazine claims Schwa features " some of the best food you will ever consume . " 
 Schwa is known as a " chef 's restaurant " where local chefs eat on their days off . Paul Kahan remarks , " I think it 's so cool that the chefs serve the food " , while Carrie <unk> emphatically declares " Everyone loves Schwa . " Grant <unk> lists Schwa as one of his three favorite places to eat in Chicago . 
 Locally grown product enthusiast Rob Gardner described Schwa as " a fun restaurant " and a " tremendous value " despite the price . He was , however , disappointed in the restaurant 's use of out @-@ of @-@ season produce . " What you will not get ... [ is ] enough local food " , he wrote , adding that the out @-@ of @-@ season " pea dish was the worst of the offerings . " 
 In 2009 , Schwa made Frommer 's international list of 500 exceptional restaurants . Frommer 's author Holly Hughes described Schwa 's dishes as " miniature works of art " and Carlson 's cooking as " innovative " . She continued , " Carlson 's food just plain tastes good " and " sometimes rises to the level of sheer poetry . " That same year , Mobil Travel Guide awarded Schwa three stars ( out of five ) calling the menu " remarkably innovative " and " knockout " good . The Mobil reviewer did , however , conclude that the food was " a little pricey " . 
 Schwa made Citysearch 's " Top 10 New Restaurants " of 2006 , placing fourth nationwide , and was named best new restaurant by <unk> . Also in 2006 , Schwa was listed as one of Chicago 's hottest eating spots by Nation 's Restaurant News . In January 2010 , Schwa 's caramelized sweetbreads made Alan Richman 's top five desserts of the year . 
 In 2008 , The New York Times profiled Schwa as one of a handful of restaurants employing an innovative chef @-@ client relationship . The next year , New York magazine 's Grub Street blog ranked Schwa among the country 's five toughest reservations . 
 = King for a Day ... Fool for a Lifetime = 
 King for a Day ... Fool for a Lifetime is the fifth studio album by San Francisco @-@ based band Faith No More , released on March 28 , 1995 . It was their first album recorded without longtime guitarist Jim Martin . The album showcased a greater variety than the band 's usual heavy metal leanings , with Rolling Stone calling the result a " genre shuffle " . The album spawned three singles — " Digging the Grave " , " Ricochet " and " Evidence " . 
 Following Martin 's departure , Trey Spruance was brought on to perform on the album , having also been in Mr. Bungle with singer Mike Patton . Production of the album was further marred by the band suffering a car accident , and by the absence of keyboard player Roddy Bottum , who had been affected by the deaths of both his father and Kurt Cobain , whose wife was Bottum 's close friend . Spruance was replaced on the supporting tour by the band 's former roadie Dean Menta . However , Spruance did play live with Faith No More for the first time in November 2011 , playing the entire album during a show in Chile . 
 Critical reception to the album has been mixed , with its varied genres being cited as a detraction by several reviewers . The album earned the band two Bay Area Music award nominations . The album 's first two singles showed more of the typical heavy metal style while " Evidence " was a departure from the band 's typical sound , incorporating jazz and funk elements .

 = = = Background = = = 
 After releasing Angel Dust in 1992 , Faith No More 's next project was a collaboration with Boo @-@ <unk> <unk> , contributing the single " Another Body Murdered " to the soundtrack for the 1993 film Judgment Night . This recording would be the first the band released without guitarist Jim Martin , with bassist Billy Gould recording the guitar parts instead . Martin had already begun skipping practice sessions with the band during the Angel Dust recording sessions , having grown dissatisfied with their new musical directions ; he had also reportedly stopped writing new music at this time . 
 Martin was fired from the band later that year due to musical differences , via a fax from keyboard player Roddy Bottum ; and Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance was brought in to record their next album . However , Spruance left the band before the subsequent tour , and was replaced by the band 's keyboard roadie , Dean Menta . Reasons given for the change differ — the band claim Spruance was unwilling to commit to a long touring schedule in support of the album , whilst Spruance claims he was never meant to be a permanent member in the first place . Roddy Bottum also claims to have been mostly absent during this period , owing to the deaths of his father and Kurt Cobain , whose wife Courtney Love was a close friend of Bottum 's and one of the temporary lead singers of the band before Chuck Mosely joined . Bottum 's absence led to the album being written largely without keyboards . 
 = = = Recording = = = 
 King for a Day ... Fool for a Lifetime was recorded in Bearsville Studios , in Woodstock , New York . Gould has described the remote location of the studio as a form of " sensory deprivation " . Writing and rehearsing the songs for the album took eight to nine months , although half of this time was also spent finding a replacement for Martin . Recording the album took an additional three months , for which the band hired producer Andy Wallace . Wallace — unconnected to their previous producer Matt Wallace — had previously worked with Sonic Youth , Nirvana and Slayer . Bottum claimed that the combination of Wallace and Spruance as two new influences helped to create " a real up @-@ in @-@ the @-@ air , what the fuck is gonna happen kind of feel " while recording . 
 According to singer Mike Patton , the band were involved in a car accident during the recording sessions for the album , while Patton was driving . Spruance and drummer Mike Bordin were also involved , and Patton claimed to have " had to look at a lot of things in the face " as a result . The band used art from the graphic novel Flood by Eric Drooker for the album 's cover and those of its singles . 
 = = Singles = = 
 Before the album 's release , the song " Digging the Grave " was released as a single on February 28 , 1995 . That March , the band appeared on the British television program Top of the Pops to promote the single , later performing it on MTV Europe , Canal + ' s <unk> Part <unk> and The Jon Stewart Show . The single reached number 16 on the UK Singles Chart , and number 12 on the Australian ARIA Charts . It featured on an episode of Beavis and Butt @-@ head in August 1995 , and was included on the soundtrack of the 1996 Italian film Jack Frusciante è <unk> dal <unk> . A video for the song was recorded , directed by Marcus Raboy , and filmed in San <unk> and was later included on the collection Who Cares a Lot ? : The Greatest Videos . 
 " Ricochet " was released as the album 's second single on May 1 , 1995 ; and was promoted with an appearance on Late Night with Conan O 'Brien . The song peaked at number 27 on the UK charts and number 58 in Australia . The song was also included on the soundtrack to the 1996 PlayStation game Fox Hunt . A video for " Ricochet " was filmed in Paris and directed by Alex Hemmings . It does not appear on the video collection , Who Cares a Lot ? : The Greatest Videos . 
 The album 's third and final single was the jazz @-@ funk number " Evidence " , released on May 8 , 1995 . The band had made an appearance the previous month on the Australian variety show Hey Hey It 's Saturday to perform the song , which eventually peaked at number 32 in the UK and number 27 in Australia . A video was made for the song , directed by Walter A. Stern . 
 = = = Other songs = = = 
 A total of twenty tracks were recorded for the album , with only fourteen making the final listing . Cut tracks " I Won 't Forget You " and " Hippie Jam Song " both appeared on the later compilations Who Cares a Lot ? and The Very Best Definitive Ultimate Greatest Hits Collection ; whilst covers of " I Started a Joke " and " <unk> " were included as B @-@ sides to the single " Digging the Grave " ; and covers of " I Wanna Fuck Myself " and " Spanish Eyes " were both included as B @-@ sides to the singles " Ricochet " and " Evidence " . 
 " Just A Man " was influenced by Chinese classical music , Patton 's vocal track being based on the style of Anthony Newley . " Star A.D. " makes an appearance on the 2008 compilation The Works . When asked if the song was a reference to Kurt Cobain , Mike Patton stated " God no ! It 's about a phenomenon . And if that guy happened to be one , I don 't know . It 's one of those things that happen ; it 's a Vegas thing . What could be more shameful than having to change your colostomy bag on stage ? ! Vegas is great , though . I love it . Welcome to America " . The song " What a Day " includes the line " Kill the body and the head will die " , which was taken from Hunter S. Thompson 's 1971 book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas . In a late 1994 interview , Bottum described the penultimate track " The Last to Know " as " Pearl Jam on mushrooms " . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Unlike Faith No More 's previous albums , initial reception to King for a Day ... Fool for a Lifetime was mixed . Entertainment Weekly gave the album a grade of C − and called it an " archaic progressive @-@ rock fusion , oddly out of step with the times " . Al Wiesel of Rolling Stone gave it a rating of two stars out of five , saying " one hopes that that last song 's moving chorus – ' Don 't let me die with this silly look in my eyes ' – doesn 't prove to be Faith No More 's epitaph " . Metal Hammer acknowledges that the album was met with " crushing disappointment " , but praised its diversity . Michael Snyder of the San Francisco Chronicle , however , was more favourable , calling it " an utter triumph " , adding that it was " enigmatic , sarcastic , provocative and incisive " . Spin magazine 's Jonathan Gold rated the album 6 out of 10 , praising its " deftness " and its " burnished , jackhammer @-@ sheathed @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lubricated @-@ condom presence " , but feeling that its multiple genres were a distraction . 
 Writing for Allmusic , Greg Prato gave it a more positive rating of three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five , while calling it one of the band 's " underrated releases " . New York magazine described the album as " <unk> , nightmarishly weird " , praising Mike Patton 's vocals . Writing for the Los Angeles Daily News , Bruce Warren rated the album two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four , writing that the band " sounds more accomplished than ever " , and singling Bottum 's keyboards out as particularly noteworthy . Jan Brady of The Buffalo News gave the album a rating of three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five , noting that " Patton still acts wild but has matured as a singer " , and describing " Digging the Grave " as a " power pop masterpiece " . 
 King for a Day ... Fool for a Lifetime was nominated for a Bay Area Music Award in 1995 , in the category " Hard Music Album or EP " . Bassist Billy Gould also received a nomination for Best Bassist at the same event . However , neither nomination was won ; Gould lost out to Les Claypool of Primus , while the album itself was beaten by Green Day 's Insomniac . In 2005 , Germany 's Visions magazine ranked King for a Day ... Fool for a Lifetime 37 in their list of " 150 Albums for Eternity " and in 2014 , it placed fourth on the Alternative Nation site 's " Top 10 Underrated 90 ’ s Alternative Rock Albums " list .

 = SMS Babenberg = 
 SMS Babenberg was a pre @-@ dreadnought battleship built by the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy in 1899 . She was launched on 4 October 1902 as the last of three Habsburg @-@ class battleships . Along with her sister ships , she participated at the bombardment of Ancona during World War I. At the end of the war , she was ceded to Great Britain as a war prize . She was scrapped in Italy in 1921 . 
 = = Construction and layout = = 
 Babenberg was the last of three battleships of her class . Her keel was laid down on 19 January 1901 at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste . Following about a year and a half of construction , she was launched on 4 October 1902 . After final fitting @-@ out work was completed , the ship was commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet on 15 April 1904 . 
 Like all ships of her class , Babenberg was 113 @.@ 11 meters ( 371 ft 1 in ) long at the waterline and was 114 @.@ 55 m ( 375 ft 10 in ) in overall length . She had a beam of 19 @.@ 8 m ( 65 ft 0 in ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 5 m ( 24 ft 7 in ) . Freeboard was approximately 5 @.@ 8 m ( 19 ft 0 in ) forward and about 5 @.@ 5 m ( 18 ft 1 in ) aft . The ship also displaced 8 @,@ 364 metric tons ( 8 @,@ 232 long tons ) . Once construction was finished , she was commissioned into the Navy with a crew of 638 officers and enlisted men . 
 Babenberg was powered by 2 @-@ shaft , 4 @-@ cylinder vertical triple expansion engines , which were supplied with steam by 16 Belleville boilers . Babenberg 's power output was rated at 16 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 000 kW ) , which produced a top speed of 19 @.@ 85 knots ( 36 @.@ 76 km / h ; 22 @.@ 84 mph ) . 
 The hull for the ship was constructed from longitudinal and transverse steel frames , over which the outer hull plates were riveted into place . The hull incorporated a double bottom that ran for 63 % of the ship 's length . A series of watertight bulkheads also extended from the keel to the gun deck . All in all , there was a total of 174 watertight compartments in the ship . Babenberg had a metacentric height of between .82 m ( 2 @.@ 7 ft ) and 1 @.@ 02 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) . Bilge keels were mounted on either side of the hull to reduce rolling and prevent her from capsizing . Babenberg had a flush main deck that was planked with wood , while the upper decks were covered with linoleum or corticine . 
 Babenberg had three 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) L / 40 guns , two mounted in a twin turret forward and one mounted in a single turret aft of the main superstructure . The C 97 @-@ type guns were manufactured by Krupp in Germany . The main guns fired at a rate of between three and four 215 kg ( 474 lb ) armor @-@ piercing ( AP ) shells per minute . Her secondary armament consisted of twelve 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) SK L / 40 guns in casemates . These guns could fire at 4 – 5 shells per minute . Babenberg was built with face @-@ hardened chrome @-@ nickel steel . The main armored belt was 220 mm ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) in the central portion of the ship , where the ammunition magazines , machinery spaces , and other critical areas were located . The belt tapered slightly to 180 mm ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) on either end of the central section .

 When Babenberg was commissioned in 1904 , she began participation in fleet drills with her sister ships SMS Árpád and SMS Habsburg . Following a series of simulated wargames against the three Monarch @-@ class battleships , Babenberg and the other two Habsburg @-@ class ships became the I Battleship Division . With the commissioning of the Erzherzog Karl @-@ class battleships in 1906 and 1907 , the Habsburg @-@ class battleships were transferred from the I to the II Battleship Division , and the three Monarch @-@ class battleships were moved from the II to the III Battleship Division . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 During World War I , Babenberg served with the IV Division of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy 's battleships and along with her sister ships Habsburg and Árpád and the remainder of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . Babenberg was mobilized on the eve of World War I to support the flight of SMS Goeben and Breslau . The two German ships were stationed in the Mediterranean and were attempting to break out of the strait of Messina , which was surrounded by British troops and vessels and make their way to the Ottoman Empire . After the Germans successfully broke out of Messina , the navy was recalled . The fleet had by that time advanced as far south as Brindisi in southeastern Italy . Babenberg and her sister ships also participated in the Bombardment of Ancona after the Italian declaration of war on the Central Powers . Towards the end of the war , the ship was decommissioned and was retained as a harbor defense ship . Following the end of the war , the ship was awarded to Great Britain as a war prize , but was instead sold and broken up for scrapping in Italy in 1921 .

 The National Flag of India is a horizontal rectangular tricolour of deep saffron , white and India green ; with the Ashoka Chakra , a 24 @-@ spoke wheel , in navy blue at its centre . It was adopted in its present form during a meeting of the Constituent Assembly held on 22 July 1947 , when it became the official flag of the Dominion of India . The flag was subsequently retained as that of the Republic of India . In India , the term " tricolour " ( Hindi : <unk> , <unk> ) almost always refers to the Indian national flag . The flag is based on the Swaraj flag , a flag of the Indian National Congress designed by Pingali Venkayya . 
 The flag , by law , is to be made of khadi , a special type of hand @-@ spun cloth , or silk , made popular by Mahatma Gandhi . The manufacturing process and specifications for the flag are laid out by the Bureau of Indian Standards . The right to manufacture the flag is held by the Khadi Development and Village Industries Commission , who allocate it to the regional groups . As of 2009 , the Karnataka Khadi <unk> Samyukta Sangha has been the sole manufacturer of the flag . 
 Usage of the flag is governed by the Flag Code of India and other laws relating to the national emblems . The original code prohibited use of the flag by private citizens except on national days such as the Independence day and the Republic Day . In 2002 , on hearing an appeal from a private citizen , Naveen Jindal , the Supreme Court of India directed the Government of India to amend the code to allow flag usage by private citizens . Subsequently , the Union Cabinet of India amended the code to allow limited usage . The code was amended once more in 2005 to allow some additional use including adaptations on certain forms of clothing . The flag code also governs the protocol of flying the flag and its use in conjunction with other national and non @-@ national flags .

 According to the Flag code of India , the Indian flag has a ratio of two by three ( where the length of the flag is 1 @.@ 5 times that of the width ) . All three stripes of the flag ( saffron , white and green ) are to be equal in width and length . The size of the Ashoka Chakra is not specified in the Flag code , but it has twenty @-@ four spokes that are evenly spaced . In section 4 @.@ 3 @.@ 1 of " IS1 : Manufacturing standards for the Indian Flag " , there is a chart that details the size of the Ashoka Chakra on the nine specific sizes of the national flag . In both the Flag code and IS1 , they call for the Ashoka Chakra to be printed or painted on both sides of the flag in navy blue . Below is the list of specified shades for all colours used on the national flag , with the exception of Navy Blue , from " IS1 : Manufacturing standards for the Indian Flag " as defined in the 1931 CIE Colour Specifications . The navy blue colour can be found in the standard IS : 1803 @-@ 1973 .

 Gandhi first proposed a flag to the Indian National Congress in 1921 . The flag was designed by Pingali Venkayya . In the centre was a traditional spinning wheel , symbolising Gandhi 's goal of making Indians self @-@ reliant by fabricating their own clothing . The design was then modified to include a white stripe in the centre for other religious communities , and provide a background for the spinning wheel . Subsequently , to avoid sectarian associations with the colour scheme , saffron , white and green were chosen for the three bands , representing courage and sacrifice , peace and truth , and faith and chivalry respectively . 
 A few days before India became independent on 15 August 1947 , the specially constituted Constituent Assembly decided that the flag of India must be acceptable to all parties and communities . A modified version of the Swaraj flag was chosen ; the tricolour remained the same saffron , white and green . However , the charkha was replaced by the Ashoka Chakra representing the eternal wheel of law . The philosopher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan , who later became India 's first Vice President and second President , clarified the adopted flag and described its significance as follows : 
 = = History = = 
 A number of flags with varying designs were used in the period preceding the Indian Independence Movement by the rulers of different princely states ; the idea of a single Indian flag was first raised by the British rulers of India after the rebellion of 1857 , which resulted in the establishment of direct imperial rule . The first flag , whose design was based on western heraldic standards , were similar to the flags of other British colonies , including Canada and Australia ; its blue field included the Union Flag in the upper @-@ left quadrant and a Star of India capped by the royal crown in the middle of the right half . To address the question of how the star conveyed " Indianness " , Queen Victoria created the Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India to honour services to the empire by her Indian subjects . Subsequently , all the Indian princely states received flags with symbols based on the heraldic criteria of Europe including the right to fly defaced British red ensigns . 
 In the early twentieth century , around the coronation of Edward VII , a discussion started on the need for a heraldic symbol that was representative of the Indian empire . William Coldstream , a British member of the Indian Civil Service , campaigned the government to change the heraldic symbol from a star , which he considered to be a common choice , to something more appropriate . His proposal was not well received by the government ; Lord Curzon rejected it for practical reasons including the multiplication of flags . Around this time , nationalist opinion within the dominion was leading to a representation through religious tradition . The symbols that were in vogue included the Ganesha , advocated by Bal Gangadhar Tilak , and Kali , advocated by Aurobindo Ghosh and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay . Another symbol was the cow , or Gau Mata ( cow mother ) . However , all these symbols were Hindu @-@ centric and did not suggest unity with India 's Muslim population . 
 The partition of Bengal ( 1905 ) resulted in the introduction of a new flag representing the Indian independence movement that sought to unite the multitude of castes and races within the country . The Vande Mataram flag , part of the Swadeshi movement against the British , comprised Indian religious symbols represented in western heraldic fashion . The tricolour flag included eight white lotuses on the upper green band representing the eight provinces , a sun and a crescent on the bottom red band , and the Vande Mataram slogan in Hindi on the central yellow band . The flag was launched in Calcutta bereft of any ceremony and the launch was only briefly covered by newspapers . The flag was not covered in contemporary governmental or political reports either , but was used at the annual session of the Indian National Congress . A slightly modified version was subsequently used by Madam <unk> Cama at the Second Socialist International Meeting in Stuttgart . Despite the multiple uses of the flag , it failed to generate enthusiasm amongst Indian nationalists . 
 Around the same time , another proposal for the flag was initiated by Sister Nivedita , a Hindu reformist and disciple of Swami Vivekananda . The flag consisted of a thunderbolt in the centre and a hundred and eight oil lamps for the border , with the Vande Mataram caption split around the thunderbolt . It was also presented at the Indian National Congress meeting in 1906 . Soon , many other proposals were initiated , but none of them gained attention from the nationalist movement . 
 In 1909 , Lord Ampthill , former Governor of the Madras Presidency , wrote to The Times of London in the run up to Empire Day pointing out that there existed " no flag representative of India as a whole or any Indian province ... Surely this is strange , seeing that but for India there would be no Empire . " 
 In 1916 , Pingali Venkayya submitted thirty new designs , in the form of a booklet funded by members of the High Court of Madras . These many proposals and recommendations did little more than keep the flag movement alive . The same year , Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak adopted a new flag as part of the Home Rule Movement . The flag included the Union Jack in the upper left corner , a star and crescent in the upper right , and seven stars displayed diagonally from the lower right , on a background of five red and four green alternating bands . The flag resulted in the first governmental initiative against any nationalistic flag , as a magistrate in Coimbatore banned its use . The ban was followed by a public debate on the function and importance of a national flag . 
 In the early 1920s , national flag discussions gained prominence across most British dominions following the peace treaty between Britain and Ireland . In November 1920 , the Indian delegation to the League of Nations wanted to use an Indian flag , and this prompted the British Indian government to place renewed emphasis on the flag as a national symbol . 
 In April 1921 , Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi wrote in his journal Young India about the need for an Indian flag , proposing a flag with the charkha or spinning wheel at the centre . The idea of the spinning wheel was put forth by Lala Hansraj , and Gandhi commissioned Pingali Venkayya to design a flag with the spinning wheel on a red and green banner , the red colour signifying Hindus and the green standing for Muslims . Gandhi wanted the flag to be presented at the Congress session of 1921 , but it was not delivered on time , and another flag was proposed at the session . Gandhi later wrote that the delay was fortuitous since it allowed him to realise that other religions were not represented ; he then added white to the banner colours , to represent all the other religions . Finally , owing to the religious @-@ political sensibilities , in 1929 , Gandhi moved towards a more secular interpretation of the flag colours , stating that red stood for the sacrifices of the people , white for purity , and green for hope . 
 On 13 April 1923 , during a procession by local Congress volunteers in Nagpur commemorating the Jallianwala Bagh massacre , the Swaraj flag with the spinning wheel , designed by Pingali Venkayya , was hoisted . This event resulted in a confrontation between the Congressmen and the police , after which five people were imprisoned . Over a hundred other protesters continued the flag procession after a meeting . Subsequently , on the first of May , Jamnalal Bajaj , the secretary of the Nagpur Congress Committee , started the Flag Satyagraha , gaining national attention and marking a significant point in the flag movement . The satyagraha , promoted nationally by the Congress , started creating cracks within the organisation in which the <unk> were highly enthused while the other group , the Swarajists , called it inconsequential . 
 Finally , at the All India Congress Committee meeting in July , 1923 , at the insistence of Jawaharlal Nehru and Sarojini Naidu , Congress closed ranks and the flag movement was endorsed . The flag movement was managed by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel with the idea of public processions and flag displays by common people . By the end of the movement , over 1500 people had been arrested across all of British India . The Bombay Chronicle reported that the movement drew from diverse groups of society including farmers , students , merchants , labourers and " national servants " . While Muslim participation was moderate , the movement enthused women , who had hitherto rarely participated in the independence movement . 
 While the flag agitation got its impetus from Gandhi 's writings and discourses , the movement received political acceptance following the Nagpur incident . News reports , editorials and letters to editors published in various journals and newspapers of the time attest to the subsequent development of a bond between the flag and the nation . Soon , the concept of preserving the honour of the national flag became an integral component of the independence struggle . While Muslims were still wary of the Swaraj flag , it gained acceptance among Muslim leaders of the Congress and the Khilafat Movement as the national flag . 
 Detractors of the flag movement , including Motilal Nehru , soon hailed the Swaraj flag as a symbol of national unity . Thus , the flag became a significant structural component of the institution of India . In contrast to the subdued responses of the past , the British Indian government took greater <unk> of the new flag , and began to define a policy of response . The British parliament discussed public use of the flag , and based on directives from England , the British Indian government threatened to withdraw funds from municipalities and local governments that did not prevent the display of the Swaraj flag . The Swaraj flag became the official flag of Congress at the 1931 meeting . However , by then , the flag had already become the symbol of the independence movement . 
 A few days before India gained its independence in August 1947 , the Constituent Assembly was formed . To select a flag for independent India , on 23 June 1947 , the assembly set up an ad hoc committee headed by Rajendra Prasad and including Maulana Abul Kalam Azad , Sarojini Naidu , C. Rajagopalachari , K. M. Munshi and B. R. Ambedkar as its members . 
 On 14 July 1947 , the committee recommended that the flag of the Indian National Congress be adopted as the National Flag of India with suitable modifications , so as to make it acceptable to all parties and communities . It was also resolved that the flag should not have any communal undertones . The spinning wheel of the Congress flag was replaced by the Chakra ( wheel ) from the Lion Capital of Ashoka . According to Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan , the chakra was chosen as it was representative of dharma and law . However , Nehru explained that the change was more practical in nature , as unlike the flag with the spinning wheel , this design would appear symmetrical . Gandhi was not very pleased by the change , but eventually came around to accepting it . 
 The flag was proposed by Nehru at the Constituent Assembly on 22 July 1947 as a horizontal tricolour of deep saffron , white and dark green in equal proportions , with the Ashoka wheel in blue in the centre of the white band . Nehru also presented two flags , one in Khadi @-@ silk and the other in Khadi @-@ cotton , to the assembly . The resolution was approved unanimously . It served as the national flag of the Dominion of India between 15 August 1947 and 26 January 1950 , and has served as the flag of the Republic of India since then . 
 = = Manufacturing process = = 
 The design and manufacturing process for the national flag is regulated by three documents issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards ( BIS ) . All of the flags are made out of khadi cloth of silk or cotton . The standards were created in 1968 and were updated in 2008 . Nine standard sizes of the flag are specified by law . 
 In 1951 , after India became a republic , the Indian Standards Institute ( now the BIS ) brought out the first official specifications for the flag . These were revised in 1964 to conform to the metric system which was adopted in India . The specifications were further amended on 17 August 1968 . The specifications cover all the essential requirements of the manufacture of the Indian flag including sizes , dye colour , chromatic values , brightness , thread count and hemp cordage . The guidelines are covered under civil and criminal laws and defects in the manufacturing process can result in punishments that include fines or jail terms . 
 Khadi or hand @-@ spun cloth is the only material allowed to be used for the flag , and flying a flag made of any other material is punishable by law with imprisonment up to three years , besides a fine . Raw materials for khadi are restricted to cotton , silk and wool . There are two kinds of khadi used : The first is the khadi @-@ bunting which makes up the body of the flag , and the second is the khadi @-@ duck , which is a beige @-@ coloured cloth that holds the flag to the pole . The khadi @-@ duck is an unconventional type of weave that meshes three threads into a weave , compared to the two threads used in conventional weaving . This type of weaving is extremely rare , and there are fewer than twenty weavers in India professing this skill . The guidelines also state that there should be exactly 150 threads per square centimetre , four threads per stitch , and one square foot should weigh exactly 205 grams ( 7 @.@ 2 oz ) . 
 The woven khadi is obtained from two handloom units in the Dharwad and Bagalkot districts of northern Karnataka . Currently , Karnataka Khadi <unk> Samyukta Sangha based in Hubli is the only licensed flag production and supply unit in India . Permission for setting up flag manufacturing units in India is allotted by the Khadi Development and Village Industries Commission , though the BIS has the power to cancel the licences of units that flout guidelines . The hand @-@ woven khadi for the National Flag was initially manufactured at <unk> , a small village in the Dharwad district . A Centre was established at <unk> in 1954 by a few freedom fighters under the banner of Dharwad Taluk <unk> Seva Sangh and obtained the Centre 's licence to make flags . 
 Once woven , the material is sent to the BIS laboratories for testing . After quality testing , the material , if approved , is returned to the factory . It is then separated into three lots which are dyed saffron , white and green . The Ashoka Chakra is screen printed , stencilled or suitably embroidered onto each side of the white cloth . Care also has to be taken that the chakra is completely visible and synchronised on both sides . Three pieces of the required dimension , one of each colour , are then stitched together according to specifications and the final product is ironed and packed . The BIS then checks the colours and only then can the flag be sold . 
 = = Protocol = = 
 Display and usage of the flag is governed by the Flag Code of India , 2002 ( successor to the Flag Code – India , the original flag code ) ; the Emblems and Names ( Prevention of Improper Use ) Act , 1950 ; and the Prevention of <unk> to National Honour Act , 1971 . <unk> to the national flag , including gross affronts or indignities to it , as well as using it in a manner so as to violate the provisions of the Flag Code , are punishable by law with imprisonment up to three years , or a fine , or both . 
 Official regulation states that the flag must never touch the ground or water , or be used as a drapery in any form . The flag may not be intentionally placed upside down , dipped in anything , or hold any objects other than flower petals before unfurling . No sort of lettering may be inscribed on the flag . When out in the open , the flag should always be flown between sunrise and sunset , irrespective of the weather conditions . Prior to 2009 , the flag could be flown on a public building at night under special circumstances ; currently , Indian citizens can fly the flag even at night , subject to the restriction that the flag should be hoisted on a tall flagpole and be well @-@ illuminated . 
 The flag should never be depicted , displayed or flown upside down . Tradition also states that when draped vertically , the flag should not merely be rotated 90 degrees , but also reversed . One " reads " a flag like the pages of a book , from top to bottom and from left to right , and after rotation the results should be the same . It is considered insulting to display the flag in a frayed or dirty state , and the same rule applies to the flagpoles and halyards used to hoist the flag , which should always be in a proper state of maintenance . 
 The original flag code of India did not allow private citizens to fly the national flag except on national days such as Independence Day or Republic Day . In 2001 , Naveen Jindal , an industrialist used to the more egalitarian use of the flag in the United States where he studied , flew the Indian flag on his office building . The flag was confiscated and he was warned of prosecution . Jindal filed a public interest litigation petition in the High Court of Delhi ; he sought to strike down the restriction on the use of the flag by private citizens , arguing that hoisting the national flag with due decorum and honour was his right as a citizen , and a way of expressing his love for the country . 
 At the end of the appeals process , the case was heard by the Supreme Court of India ; the court ruled in Jindal 's favour , asking the Government of India to consider the matter . The Union Cabinet of India then amended the Indian Flag Code with effect from 26 January 2002 , allowing private citizens to hoist the flag on any day of the year , subject to their safeguarding the dignity , honour and respect of the flag . It is also held that the code was not a statute and restrictions under the code ought to be followed ; also , the right to fly the flag is a qualified right , unlike the absolute rights guaranteed to citizens , and should be interpreted in the context of Article 19 of the Constitution of India . 
 The original flag code also forbade use of the flag on uniforms , costumes and other clothing . In July 2005 , the Government of India amended the code to allow some forms of usage . The amended code forbids usage in clothing below the waist and on undergarments , and forbids embroidering onto pillowcases , handkerchiefs or other dress material . 
 Disposal of damaged flags is also covered by the flag code . Damaged or soiled flags may not be cast aside or disrespectfully destroyed ; they have to be destroyed as a whole in private , preferably by burning or by any other method consistent with the dignity of the flag . 
 = = = Display = = = 
 The rules regarding the correct methods to display the flag state that when two flags are fully spread out horizontally on a wall behind a podium , their hoists should be towards each other with the saffron stripes uppermost . If the flag is displayed on a short flagpole , this should be mounted at an angle to the wall with the flag draped tastefully from it . If two national flags are displayed on crossed staffs , the hoists must be towards each other and the flags must be fully spread out . The flag should never be used as a cloth to cover tables , lecterns , podiums or buildings , or be draped from railings . 
 Whenever the flag is displayed indoors in halls at public meetings or gatherings of any kind , it should always be on the right ( observers ' left ) , as this is the position of authority . So when the flag is displayed next to a speaker in the hall or other meeting place , it must be placed on the speaker 's right hand . When it is displayed elsewhere in the hall , it should be to the right of the audience . The flag should be displayed completely spread out with the saffron stripe on top . If hung vertically on the wall behind the podium , the saffron stripe should be to the left of the onlookers facing the flag with the hoist cord at the top . 
 The flag , when carried in a procession or parade or with another flag or flags , should be on the marching right or alone in the centre at the front . The flag may form a distinctive feature of the unveiling of a statue , monument , or plaque , but should never be used as the covering for the object . As a mark of respect to the flag , it should never be dipped to a person or thing , as opposed to regimental colours , organisational or institutional flags , which may be dipped as a mark of honour . During the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag , or when the flag is passing in a parade or in a review , all persons present should face the flag and stand at attention . Those present in uniform should render the appropriate salute . When the flag is in a moving column , persons present will stand at attention or salute as the flag passes them . A dignitary may take the salute without a head dress . The flag salutation should be followed by the playing of the national anthem . 
 The privilege of flying the national flag on vehicles is restricted to the President , the Vice @-@ President or the Prime Minister , Governors and Lieutenant Governors of states , Chief Ministers , Union Ministers , members of the Parliament of India and state legislatures of the Indian states ( Vidhan Sabha and Vidhan Parishad ) , judges of the Supreme Court of India and High Courts , and flag officers of the Army , Navy and Air Force . The flag has to be flown from a staff affixed firmly either on the middle front or to the front right side of the car . When a foreign dignitary travels in a car provided by government , the flag should be flown on the right side of the car while the flag of the foreign country should be flown on the left side . 
 The flag should be flown on the aircraft carrying the President , the Vice @-@ President or the Prime Minister on a visit to a foreign country . Alongside the National Flag , the flag of the country visited should also be flown ; however , when the aircraft lands in countries en route , the national flags of the respective countries would be flown instead . When carrying the president within India , aircraft display the flag on the side the president embarks or disembarks ; the flag is similarly flown on trains , but only when the train is stationary or approaching a railway station . 
 When the Indian flag is flown on Indian territory along with other national flags , the general rule is that the Indian flag should be the starting point of all flags . When flags are placed in a straight line , the rightmost flag ( leftmost to the observer facing the flag ) is the Indian flag , followed by other national flags in alphabetical order . When placed in a circle , the Indian flag is the first point and is followed by other flags alphabetically . In such placement , all other flags should be of approximately the same size with no other flag being larger than the Indian flag . Each national flag should also be flown from its own pole and no flag should be placed higher than another . In addition to being the first flag , the Indian flag may also be placed within the row or circle alphabetically . When placed on crossed poles , the Indian flag should be in front of the other flag , and to the right ( observer 's left ) of the other flag . The only exception to the preceding rule is when it is flown along with the flag of the United Nations , which may be placed to the right of the Indian flag . 
 When the Indian flag is displayed with non @-@ national flags , including corporate flags and advertising banners , the rules state that if the flags are on separate staffs , the flag of India should be in the middle , or the furthest left from the viewpoint of the onlookers , or at least one flag 's breadth higher than the other flags in the group . Its flagpole must be in front of the other poles in the group , but if they are on the same staff , it must be the uppermost flag . If the flag is carried in procession with other flags , it must be at the head of the marching procession , or if carried with a row of flags in line abreast , it must be carried to the marching right of the procession . 
 = = = Half @-@ mast = = = 
 The flag should be flown at half @-@ mast as a sign of mourning . The decision to do so lies with the President of India , who also decides the period of such mourning . When the flag is to be flown at half mast , it must first be raised to the top of the mast and then slowly lowered . Only the Indian flag is flown half mast ; all other flags remain at normal height . 
 The flag is flown half @-@ mast nationwide on the death of the president , Vice @-@ president or prime minister . It is flown half @-@ mast in New Delhi and the state of origin for the Speaker of the Lok Sabha , Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , and Union Ministers . On deaths of Governors , Lt. Governors and Chief Ministers , the flag is flown at half @-@ mast in the respective states and union territories . 
 The Indian flag cannot be flown at half @-@ mast on Republic Day ( 26 January ) , Independence day ( 15 August ) , Gandhi Jayanti ( 2 October ) , National Week ( 6 – 13 April ) or state formation anniversaries , except over buildings housing the body of the deceased dignitary . However , even in such cases , the flag must be raised to full @-@ mast when the body is moved from the building . 
 <unk> of State mourning on the death of foreign dignitaries are governed by special instructions issued from the Ministry of Home Affairs in individual cases . However , in the event of death of either the Head of the State or Head of the Government of a foreign country , the Indian Mission accredited to that country may fly the national flag at half @-@ mast . 
 On occasions of state , military , central para @-@ military forces funerals , the flag shall be draped over the bier or coffin with the saffron towards the head of the bier or coffin . The flag should not be lowered into the grave or burnt in the pyre . 
 = Genesis ( band ) = 
 Genesis are an English rock band formed at Charterhouse School , Godalming , Surrey in 1967 . The most commercially successful and long @-@ lasting line @-@ up includes keyboardist Tony Banks , bassist / guitarist Mike Rutherford and drummer / singer Phil Collins . Other important members were the original lead singer Peter Gabriel and guitarist Steve Hackett . The band underwent many changes in musical style over its career , from folk music to progressive rock in the 1970s , before moving towards pop at the end of the decade . They have sold 21 @.@ 5 million RIAA @-@ certified albums in the US and their worldwide sales are estimated to be between 100 million and 130 million . 
 Formed by five Charterhouse pupils including Banks , Rutherford , Gabriel , and Anthony Phillips , Genesis was named by former pupil Jonathan King who arranged them to record several unsuccessful singles and an album . After splitting with King , the group began touring professionally , signing with Charisma Records . Following the departure of Phillips , Genesis recruited Collins and Hackett and recorded several progressive rock style albums , with live shows centred around Gabriel 's theatrical costumes and performances . The group were initially commercially successful in Europe , before entering the UK charts with Foxtrot ( 1972 ) . They followed this with Selling England by the Pound ( 1973 ) and The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway ( 1974 ) before Gabriel decided to leave the group . 
 After an unsuccessful search for a replacement , Collins took over as lead singer , while the group gained popularity in the UK and the US . Following A Trick of the Tail and Wind & Wuthering ( both 1976 ) , Hackett left the band , reducing it to a core of Banks , Rutherford , and Collins . Genesis had their first UK top ten and US top 30 single in 1978 with " Follow You Follow Me " and the group continued to gain commercial success with Duke ( 1980 ) , Abacab ( 1981 ) , and Genesis ( 1983 ) , reaching a peak with Invisible Touch ( 1986 ) , which featured five US top five singles . Its title track reached number one in the US . After the follow up , We Can 't Dance ( 1991 ) and related tour , Collins left Genesis in 1996 to focus on his solo career . Banks and Rutherford recruited Ray Wilson for Calling All Stations ( 1997 ) , but a lack of success in the US led to a group hiatus . Banks , Rutherford and Collins reunited for the Turn It On Again Tour in 2007 , and together with Gabriel and Hackett were interviewed for the BBC documentary Genesis : Together and Apart in 2014 . 
 Their discography includes fifteen studio and six live albums , six of which topped the UK chart . They have won numerous awards and nominations , including a Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video with " Land of Confusion " , and inspired a number of tribute bands recreating Genesis shows from various stages of the band 's career . In 2010 , Genesis were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .
