 Just before the birth of their only child , daughter Irene , Szigeti found himself stuck in Berlin during the Kapp Putsch of 1920 , unable to return to Geneva . The entire city had been paralyzed by a general strike , and the trains were not running . His scheduled concert could not go on as planned , but he was forced to stay in Berlin for " interminable days " while the Putsch ran its course . Szigeti writes : " ... the impossibility of communicating by phone or wire with my <unk> condition I pictured with the somewhat lurid pessimism usual to young prospective <unk> certainly a greater torment to me than all the other discomforts put together " . 
 By 1940 , the outbreak of World War II forced the <unk> to leave Europe for the United States . ( Irene remained in Switzerland , having married pianist Nikita <unk> earlier that year . ) They settled in California , where Wanda , always fond of nature , was delighted to be able to raise her own garden . In a letter to a friend , Szigeti describes their California life : 
 Wanda is happy , doing wonders with her gardening , chicken and rabbit raising , preserve and pâté de foie making . She doesn 't budge from our place , doesn 't want to come back to New York even for a visit , which I , for one , can well understand ! Two dogs , an aviary full of exotic birds , tomatoes , grapes , strawberries , asparagus , artichokes , lovely flowers ( camellias too ! ) , right in our own little world . 
 Szigeti narrowly escaped being killed in the plane crash that claimed the life of movie star Carole Lombard in January 1942 . Szigeti , who was on his way to Los Angeles for a concert , was forced to give up his seat on TWA Flight 3 at a refueling stop in Albuquerque , NM to allow the plane to take on 15 soldiers who , it being wartime , had priority . The plane , off course at night and with wartime blackout conditions in effect , crashed into a mountain cliff after take off from an intermediate stop in Las Vegas , killing everyone on board . 
 In 1960 , the couple returned to Europe and settled near Lake Geneva in Switzerland , close to the home of their daughter and son @-@ in @-@ law . They remained there for the rest of their lives . Wanda died in 1971 , predeceasing her husband by two years .

 Writing in the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians , Boris Schwarz commented : 
 Szigeti 's performing technique was not always flawless and his tone lacked sensuous beauty , although it acquired a spiritual quality in moments of inspiration ... Szigeti held the bow in an old @-@ fashioned way , with the elbow close to the body , and produced much emphatic power , but not without extraneous sounds . Minor reservations , however , were swept aside by the force of his musical personality . 
 This comment illustrates well the general nature of Szigeti 's reception by both critics and fellow musicians : while his musical insights , intellect , and depth of interpretation were almost universally lauded , the purely technical aspect of his playing was awarded a more mixed reaction . His tone in particular seems to have been occasionally uneven from performance to performance . A 1926 recital review in The New York Times , for example , laments that 
 ... his performance was stiff and dry in its observance of letter and its absence of spirit ... Mr. Szigeti was not only inclined to dryness of tone and angularity of phrase , but there were also passages of poor intonation . 
 In contrast , a review from the previous year in the same journal remarked after a performance of the Beethoven concerto that 
 Mr. Szigeti has a rather small but beautiful tone , elegance , finish . He played with a quiet sincerity which grew upon the audience , though not with the virility and sweep that other violinists find ... it is clear that Mr. Szigeti is a player to command esteem and respect for his musicianship , for the genuineness of his interpretations , and his artistic style . 
 = = = Musicians = = = 
 Among his fellow musicians , Szigeti was widely admired and respected . Violinist Nathan Milstein wrote that 
 Szigeti ... was an incredibly cultured musician . Actually his talent grew out of his culture ... I always admired him , and he was respected by musicians ... in his late years , he finally got the appreciation he deserved from the general public as well . 
 In his memoirs , published in 2004 , cellist János Starker asserts that 
 Szigeti was one of the giants among the violinists I had heard from childhood on , and my admiration for him is undiminished up to this day . 
 Starker then describes a recital he attended late in Szigeti 's career , illustrating both the extent to which Szigeti was suffering from arthritis and his ability to still communicate his musical ideas effectively : 
 " He invited me to his recital in Town Hall ... the first few minutes were excruciating : as I saw later , his fingers had deteriorated to the point that he had almost no flesh on them . But once he loosened up a bit he produced heart @-@ rending beauty . 
 Violinist Yehudi Menuhin comments at length about Szigeti in his own memoirs , remarking as many others did on Szigeti 's intellectual approach to music , but in a somewhat more critical fashion : 
 Apart from <unk> , he was the most cultivated violinist I have ever known but while <unk> was a force of nature , Szigeti , slender , small , anxious , was a beautifully fashioned piece of porcelain , a priceless Sèvres vase . Curiously for a Hungarian , from whom one expects wild , energetic , spontaneous qualities , Szigeti travelled even farther up a one @-@ way road of deliberate intellectualism . A young accompanist who worked with Szigeti told me that two hours concentration wouldn 't get them beyond the first three bars of a <unk> much analysis and ratiocination went into his practice ... A similar <unk> marked his adjudication . Shortly before he died in 1973 , he was a member of our jury at the City of London Carl Flesch Concours ... I was struck not only by the sharpness of his intellect but also by what seemed to me the perversity of his opinions . Some particular aspect of a competitor 's playing would hold his attention , and he would take violent issue with it , to the exclusion of everything else . For him a violinist was made or broken , a prize awarded or withheld , on details that to me scarcely mattered . 
 Nevertheless , Menuhin too referred to Szigeti as " a violinist whom I much admired and a man of whom I was very fond " .

 = = = The writer = = = 
 During his time in America , Szigeti took to writing ; his memoirs , With Strings Attached : Reminiscences and Reflections were published in 1947 . The New York Times reviewed it favorably : although in their description the book was " constructed along utterly anarchistic lines , with each episode and anecdote left pretty much on its own " , they asserted that " It also has the flavor of life in it , and it is marked by an exhilarating revolt against the custom of arranging catastrophes and triumphs under neat chapter headings " . 
 In 1969 , he published his treatise on violin playing , Szigeti on the Violin . In it Szigeti presents his opinions about the then @-@ current state of violin playing and the various challenges and issues facing musicians in the modern world , as well as a detailed examination of violin technique as he understood it . 
 A recurring theme in the first part is the changing nature of violinist ’ s lives during Szigeti ’ s later years . In his youth , concert artists relied primarily on recitals to establish themselves and attract critical attention and acclaim ; by the time of Szigeti ’ s writings , the recital had been eclipsed in importance by the competition . Szigeti was dismayed by this trend , especially since he considered the fast @-@ paced and intense preparation necessary for high @-@ level competitions to be " … incompatible with the slow maturing either of the performing artist or of the repertoire . " Szigeti believed that such accelerated development of a musician led to performances that " lack ( ed ) the stamp of authenticity , the mark of a personal view evolved through trial and error . " In a similar vein , he was skeptical of the effects produced by the recording industry on the culture of music @-@ making . In Szigeti ’ s opinion , the allure of the recording contract and the instant " success " that it implied led many young artists to record works before they were musically ready , and thus contributed to the problem of artificially fast development and resulting musical immaturity . 
 Szigeti also offers a lengthy and detailed explanation of his approach to violin technique . He believed that a violinist should be concerned primarily with musical goals , rather than simply choosing either the easiest or most impressively virtuosic way to play a certain passage . He was particularly concerned with tone color : he advised that " The player should cultivate a seismograph @-@ like sensitivity to brusque changes of tone colour caused by fingerings based on expediency and comfort rather than the composer ’ s manifest or probable intentions . " Other topics prominently discussed include the most effective position of a violinist 's left hand , the violin works of Béla Bartók , a cautionary list of widely accepted misprints and editorial inaccuracies in the standard repertoire , and most notably , the vital importance of J.S. Bach 's Six Sonatas and Partitas for any violinist 's technical and artistic development . 
 = = = New music = = = 
 Szigeti was an avid champion of new music , and frequently planned his recitals to include new or little @-@ known works alongside the classics . Many composers wrote new works for him , notably Béla Bartók , Ernest Bloch , and Eugène Ysaÿe , along with lesser @-@ known composers such as David Diamond and Hamilton Harty . 
 The reason for Szigeti 's appeal to composers was articulated by Bloch upon completion of his Violin Concerto : the concerto 's premiere would have to be delayed a full year for Szigeti to be the soloist , and Bloch agreed , saying that 
 Modern composers realize that when Szigeti plays their music , their inmost fancy , their slightest intentions become fully realized , and their music is not exploited for the glorification of the artist and his technique , but that artist and technique become the humble servant of the music . 
 Szigeti was also the dedicatee of the first of Eugène Ysaÿe 's Six Sonatas for Solo Violin ; in fact , Ysaÿe 's inspiration to compose the sonatas came from hearing Szigeti 's performances of J.S. Bach 's Six Sonatas and Partitas , to which they are intended as a modern counterpart . 
 Perhaps Szigeti 's most fruitful musical partnership was with his friend Béla Bartók . The first piece Bartók dedicated to him was the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra ( or piano ) of 1928 ; the rhapsody , based on both Romanian and Hungarian folk tunes , was one of a pair of violin rhapsodies written in 1928 ( the other being dedicated to Zoltán Székely . ) In 1938 , Szigeti and clarinetist Benny Goodman teamed up to commission a trio from Bartók : originally intended to be a short work just long enough to fill both sides of a 78 rpm record , the piece soon expanded beyond its modest intent and became the three @-@ movement Contrasts for piano , violin and clarinet . In 1944 , by which time Szigeti and Bartók had both fled to the United States to escape the war in Europe , Bartók 's health was failing and he had sunk into depression . He was in dire need of money , but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would never sell to an American audience . Szigeti came to his friend 's aid by securing donations from the American Society of Composers and Publishers to pay for Bartók 's medical treatment , and then , together with conductor and compatriot Fritz Reiner , persuaded Serge Koussevitzky to commission from Bartók what eventually became his much @-@ beloved Concerto for Orchestra . The work 's success brought Bartók some measure of financial security and provided him with a much @-@ needed emotional boost . 
 As well as performing new works dedicated to him , Szigeti also championed the music of other contemporary composers , notably Sergei Prokofiev and Igor Stravinsky . He was among the first violinists to make Prokofiev 's First Violin Concerto a standard part of his repertoire , and frequently performed and recorded works of Stravinsky ( including the Duo Concertante , recorded with the composer at the piano in 1945 . ) The Berg Violin Concerto he even recorded twice , under the baton of Dimitri Mitropoulos . 
 = Ionian Islands under Venetian rule = 
 The Ionian Islands were a maritime and overseas possession of the Republic of Venice from the mid @-@ 14th century until the late 18th century . The conquest of the islands took place gradually . The first to be acquired was Cythera and the neighboring islet of Anticythera , indirectly in 1238 and directly after 1363 . In 1386 , Corfu voluntarily became part of Venice 's colonies . Following a century , Venice captured Zante in 1485 , Cephalonia in 1500 and Ithaca in 1503 . The conquest was completed in 1718 with the capture of Lefkada . Each of the islands remained part of the Venetian Stato da <unk> until Napoleon Bonaparte dissolved the Republic of Venice in 1797 . The Ionian Islands are situated in the Ionian Sea , off the west coast of Greece . Cythera , the southernmost , is just off the southern tip of the Peloponnese and Corfu , the northernmost , is located at the entrance of the Adriatic Sea . In modern Greek , the period of Venetian rule over Greek territory is known as <unk> or <unk> ( Modern Greek : <unk> or <unk> ) and literally means " rule of the Venetians " . It is believed that the Venetian period on the Ionian Islands was agreeable , especially compared with the coinciding Turkish rule over other parts of present @-@ day Greece . 
 The governor of the Ionian Islands during the Venetian period was the Provveditore generale da Mar , who resided on Corfu . Additionally , each island 's authorities were divided into the Venetian and the domestic authorities . The economy of the islands was based on exporting local goods , primarily raisins , olive oil and wine , whereas Venetian lira , the currency of Venice , was also the currency of the islands . Some features of the culture of Venice were incorporated in the culture of the Ionian Islands , thus influencing to this day local music , cuisine and language . The Italian language , for instance , which was introduced on the islands as the official language and was adopted by the upper class , is still popular today throughout the islands . 
 = = Relations between Venice and Byzantium = = 
 Venice was founded in 421 after the destruction of nearby communities by the Huns and the Lombards . In the shifting Italian borders of the following centuries , Venice benefited from remaining under the control of the Roman Empire - increasingly as the <unk> Northwestern outpost of the now Constantinople centered power . During Justinian I 's reconquest of Italy from the Visigoths , Venice was an increasingly important stronghold for the Empire 's Exarchate of Ravenna . The political centre of the <unk> , and the most senior military officials of the Empire , were situated in Ravenna . The subordinate military officials who were their representatives in the Venetian lagoons were called tribunes , and only in about AD 697 were the lagoons made a separate military command under a dux ( doge ) . Notwithstanding the election of the first Doge , <unk> evidence such as honours and orders received by the doge from the Emperor implies that Venice was considered part of the Byzantine Empire even after the capture of Ravenna by the Lombards . Despite the Pax Nicephori ( 803 ) , which recognised Venice as Byzantine territory , the influence of the Eastern Roman Emperor slowly faded away . By 814 Venice functioned as a fully independent republic . Even so , Venice became a partner of the Empire and trading privileges were granted to it by the Emperors via treaties , such as the Byzantine – Venetian Treaty of 1082 . 
 The Fourth Crusade ( 1202 – 1204 ) was initially intended to invade Muslim @-@ controlled areas ; instead , the Crusaders attacked the capital of the Byzantine Empire , Constantinople , resulting in the temporary dissolution of the empire and the sack of its capital . As Venice was one of the participants in the Crusade its relations with the Byzantine Empire were strained during this period . Moreover , by styling himself " Lord of one @-@ quarter and one @-@ eighth of the whole Empire of Romania " after the Crusade , the Doge of Venice at that time , Enrico Dandolo ( who had masterminded the attack and personally led the final assault ) contributed to the deterioration of the relations between the two states . Efforts to improve relations , for example through the Nicaean – Venetian Treaty of 1219 , proved unsuccessful . A period of friendly relations only followed the Sicilian Vespers in 1282 , when Venice , foreseeing the fall of Charles , the French King of Sicily , began forming closer relations with Byzantium . Venice had been bound by an alliance with Charles against Byzantium in 1281 .

 The Islands were referred to , both individually and collectively , by various names . After Venice captured Cephalonia on 24 December 1500 , the administration of the defense of all the islands was delegated to an official seated in Corfu . This official was being referred to as " the General Provveditore of the Three Islands " ( Provveditore Generale delle Tre Isole ) and resided at the fortress of Angelokastro from 1387 to the end of the 16th century . The Three Islands refer to Corfu , Zante and Cephalonia . The Venetian equivalent for " Ionian Islands " is <unk> <unk> , the Italian being Isole <unk> and the Greek <unk> <unk> in Modern Greek and <unk> <unk> in Katharevousa . 
 Below are the seven principal islands from north to south , including their Greek and Italian names in parentheses : 
 Corfu ( Kerkyra ; <unk> ) 
 Paxos ( <unk> ; Passo ) 
 Lefkada ( Leucas ; Santa Maura or <unk> ) 
 Cephalonia ( <unk> ( l ) <unk> or <unk> ( l ) <unk> ; Cefalonia ) 
 Ithaca ( <unk> or <unk> ; <unk> , Val di Compare or Piccola Cefalonia ) 
 Zante ( Zakynthos ; Zante or <unk> ) 
 Cythera ( <unk> ; Cerigo ) 
 Cythera and Lefkada were additionally called <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> and <unk> respectively by the Ottomans .

 During the Roman Empire , the Ionian Islands were variously part of the provinces of Achaea and Epirus vetus . These would form , with the exception of Cythera , the Byzantine theme of Cephallenia in the late 8th century . From the late 11th century , the Ionian Islands became a battleground in the Byzantine – Norman Wars . The island of Corfu was held by the Normans in 1081 – 1085 and 1147 – 1149 , while the Venetians unsuccessfully besieged it in 1122 – 1123 . The island of Cephalonia was also unsuccessfully besieged in 1085 , but was plundered in 1099 by the Pisans and in 1126 by the Venetians . Finally , Corfu and the rest of the theme , except for Lefkada , were captured by the Normans under William II of Sicily in 1185 . Although Corfu was recovered by the Byzantines by 1191 , the other islands henceforth remained lost to Byzantium , and formed a County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos under William 's Greek admiral <unk> of Brindisi . 
 = = = The <unk> = = = 
 Following the Fourth Crusade and the signature of the <unk> terrarum imperii <unk> , Corfu came under Venetian rule . In 1207 though , doge Pietro <unk> ceded the island as a <unk> to ten Venetian nobles , provided that they demonstrate loyalty and devotion and that they pay taxes . Corfu passed in the hands of the Despotate of Epirus around 1214 , and was captured in 1257 by Manfred of Sicily , who put his admiral Philippe Chinard there in charge of his eastern possessions . Nonetheless , with the defeat of Manfred at Benevento and the signature of the Treaty of Viterbo on 27 May 1267 , Corfu became a possession of the Angevin Kingdom of Naples . Meanwhile , the rest of the islands continued to form part of the County palatine , which throughout its existence was governed by three families : the Orsini family , the House of Anjou and the Tocco family . The rule of the family of Tocco lasted for 122 years , up until 1479 , when Ottomans captured Cephalonia , Zante , Lefkada and Ithaca . 
 = = = The Venetian conquest = = = 
 On 13 February 1386 Corfu became once more a Venetian possession and this time Venetian rule would last until the end of the Republic . This was accomplished voluntary by the people of Corfu . On 10 May , the <unk> appointed five ambassadors to submit to the Venetian senate . The Ottomans made several attempts to capture Corfu , the first of which was in 1537 . This attack led Venice to an alliance with the Pope and Emperor Charles V. , known as the Holy League , against the Ottoman Empire . Another major unsuccessful Ottoman attack was that of July 1716 . 
 After the partition of the Byzantine Empire in 1204 , Cythera fell into Venetian hands in 1238 through the marriage of Marco <unk> with the daughter of the Greek lord of the island . Cythera and Anticythera constituted part of the Stato da Mar for the first time in 1363 followed by an interruption of a three @-@ year Turkish rule , between 1715 and 1718 . With the Treaty of Passarowitz Cythera and Anticythera passed to the Venetian Republic and remained under its control until its fall , in 1797 . 
 The Turkish rule in the three islands of Cephalonia , Zante and Ithaca was short @-@ lived . In 1481 , two years after the beginning of the Turkish rule , Antonio Tocco invaded and briefly occupied Cephalonia and Zante but he was soon driven out by the Venetians . Zante was officially recovered by the Venetians in 1485 . Then , Cephalonia , after sixteen years of Turkish occupation ( 1484 – 1500 ) , became part of the Stato da Mar on 24 December 1500 , with the Siege of the Castle of St. George . Finally , Ithaca , following the fate of Cephalonia , was conquered by Venice in 1503 . 
 Lefkada , part of the Despotate of Epirus since the latter 's foundation in 1205 , was incorporated by Leonardo I Tocco into the County of Cephalonia in 1362 . The Despotate of Epirus was one of the three Byzantine Empires in exile created after the Fourth Crusade in 1204 . Following the fate of the other central Ionian Islands , it was captured by the Turks in 1479 and then by the Venetians in 1502 . However , Venetian rule did not last , as Lefkada was given back to the Ottoman Empire one year later . Turkish rule over Lefkada lasted for over 200 years , from 1479 to 1684 , when Francesco Morosini attacked and subdued the island during the Morean War . Lefkada , however , did not become officially Venetian until 1718 , with the signature of the Treaty of Passarowitz . 
 = = = Dissolution of the Republic and aftermath = = = 
 Napoleon Bonaparte declared war against Venice on 3 May 1797 . The signing of the Treaty of Campo Formio , on 17 October 1797 , marked the dissolution of the Republic of Venice and the sharing of its territories between France and Austria . The lands of the <unk> up to the River Adige , the city itself and the possessions of the Balkan peninsula of Istria and Dalmatia were yielded to Austria . The Ionian Islands , part of Venetian maritime territories , were ceded to France . Napoleon organized the islands into three departments : <unk> , <unk> , and Mer @-@ <unk> . The first included the islands of Corfu and Paxos , as well as the former Venetian settlements of Butrint and Parga situated in Epirus . The second department was formed by the islands of Cephalonia , Ithaca and Lefkada and the cities of Preveza and <unk> , whereas Zante and Cerigo were part of the third department . The French rule , however , did not last as Russia allied with the Ottoman Empire in September 1798 and in 1799 a Russo @-@ Ottoman naval expedition captured the islands . With the signing of a treaty between Russia and the Porte on 21 March 1800 , an independent island republic under the protection of both the empires was established . The name of the new state was agreed to be the " Septinsular Republic " and included all the territories of the three former French departments except for the continental possessions of Parga , Preveza , <unk> and Butrint . With the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807 , the seven islands were given back to France by Russia . In October 1809 , Great Britain took possession of all the islands with the exception of Corfu and Paxos , which was only surrendered in 1814 . In 1815 , the Ionian Islands became a British protectorate under the name United States of the Ionian Islands . 
 = = Administration = = 
 The civil and military governor of the Ionian Islands was the Provveditore generale da Mar , who lived on Corfu and had the supreme command of the armed Venetian fleet . In the early days of Venetian rule , he was elected only in case of need and on several occasions in peacetime , the Provveditore generale da Mar was appointed as Provveditore generale delle tre Isole , " Provveditore generale of the three Islands " . 
 Authorities in the islands were divided into two types : the Venetian ones , occupied by Venetians and represented the sovereign state and its political and military power over the Islands , and the domestic authorities , which were appointed by the Communal Council ( Consiglio della <unk> ) . The Venetians were appointed by the Great Council of Venice . There were three officials constituting the reggimento ( " regime " ) of each island . The head of the reggimento had the title of Provveditore in all the islands except for Corfu , where he was called <unk> . The title could only be held by a nobleman . The subordinate Venetian officials were the <unk> , two on each island , who performed administrative and judicial functions along with the Provveditore of each island . The Provveditore ' s responsibilities also included security from hostile raids , taxation , religious and other issues . 
 In Corfu the Venetian officials included a <unk> , a Provveditore and a Capitano , two <unk> , a Capitano della <unk> and a Castellano della <unk> . In Cephalonia and Zante there were only one Provveditore and two <unk> . When Lefkada was incorporated a Provveditore <unk> and a Provveditore <unk> became the representatives of Venice on the island , although , in 1595 , another provveditore was appointed to the Fortress of <unk> . In Cythera the reggimento included both a Provveditore and a <unk> . The domestic authorities comprised both a Consiglio Maggiore and a Consiglio Minore composed of members of the local aristocracy . 
 There were ten fortresses throughout the islands , with one on each island serving as its capital . On Corfu , however , there were three fortresses ; two in the town of Corfu and the Angelokastro . On Cephalonia there were two , the castle of St. George or the Fortress of Cephalonia ( Città di Cefalonia ) and the Fortress of <unk> ( Fortezza d <unk> ) in the northern part . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The Ionian economy during the Venetian period was largely based on exporting local products . The most important of the agricultural products of Corfu was olive oil . On the islands of Cephallonia and Zante the main exports were raisins , olive oil and wine . One of the most significant exports was olive oil . Groves of olive trees were planted throughout the islands during the Venetian period as olive oil was important to Venice 's economy . Although the production of it was successful , the Republic only allowed exportation to Venice . Statistics for the years 1766 @-@ 1770 indicate 1 @,@ 905 @,@ 917 olive trees on Corfu , 113 @,@ 161 on Zante , 38 @,@ 516 on Cephalonia , 44 @,@ 146 on Lefkada and 31 @,@ 884 on Cythera . 
 Nevertheless , raisin exports were the most important export of the islands during the Venetian rule . By the early 18th century Zante , Cephalonia , and part of Ithaca had become a major centre of the currant trade . Because of the fierce competition in the raisin trade between Venice and the United Kingdom , Venice prohibited the free export of raisins from the islands . Another measure was the <unk> <unk> , a heavy export tax for foreign ships . 
 The currency of the islands during Venetian rule was the Venetian lira , as in Venice . There was a special issue for the Islands ; the observe side of it has the complete or <unk> inscription <unk> / <unk> / <unk> in three lines . The reserve depicts the winged and haloed lion of Saint Marc in a front view , holding the book of the Gospel in his fore @-@ paws . The Ionian Islands formed part of the Venetian maritime trade route to the Orient . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 When the central Ionian Islands were captured by Venice their population was very low and Ithaca was completely uninhabited . To address this problem , a small colonisation to the islands took place . Catholic Italians from <unk> and Orthodox Greeks from the Stato da Mar were transferred to the islands as part of the colonisation . Τhe population eventually increased : in 1765 @-@ 1766 it had reached 111 @,@ 439 ; in 1780 , the population was 150 @,@ 908 . Fourteen years later , there were 155 @,@ 770 inhabitants throughout the islands . 
 These are some figures concerning the population of each island during the Venetian period : 
 = = = Language and education = = = 
 During the Venetian period all public acts were drawn up in the Venetian language , the official language of the Government . Greek remained spoken by the peasantry whereas Venetian was adopted by the upper class and it was generally preferred within the towns . Thus , the Venetian language became , if not the common language of the Ionians , at least the prestige one . The Venetians did little in the area of education , mainly due to the fact that schooling was not a responsibility of the state at that time in Europe but a private matter . Some authors believe that this was done intentionally by Venice , as part of its colonial policy . People belonging to the upper classes were more likely to be educated and to have studied in an Italian university , usually that of Padua . Modelled after the academies operating at that time in Venice , the first literary academy , Accademia degli <unk> , was founded in Corfu in 1656 by individuals . It had as an emblem two rocks beneath a winged lion , with an inscription His Semper hovering in the air . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 Venetians , being Catholics , retained the privileges enjoyed by the Latin bishopric of the islands under the Count Palatine Dynasties . The Catholics were not numerous , and during the Venetian period , they were mainly concentrated in Corfu and Cephalonia . Most of them were descendants of Italian settlers but there were some conversions by Greeks to Catholicism . According to the law , Greek Orthodox priests and monks had to accept the Catholics as their superiors , though the Venetians placed the interests of the Republic ahead of those of the Papacy . Mixed marriages between Catholic and Orthodox Christians were allowed . These two were the main factors in the decline of Roman Catholicism in the Islands . 
 Jews were also a native religious group to the Islands during the Venetian period . They were even fewer in number than the Catholics ; in 1797 the number of Jews in Corfu appears to have been only two thousand . Jewish presence in Corfu can be traced since the times of the Principality of Taranto . In Cephalonia , there is evidence of Jewish habitation in the old capital , the Castle of St. George , since the early 17th century . When the capital of the island was transferred to Argostoli the Jews resettled there .

 The social structure of the islands followed that of Venice . The whole population was divided into three classes : the nobles ( nobili ) , the bourgeoisie ( <unk> ) and the common people ( <unk> ) . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Throughout Venice 's old possessions , but above all in the Ionian islands , the memory of the Republic is deeply rooted in the population , who recall it with a shade of nostalgia even after so much time and so many events . Because of the long Venetian period , the manners and traditions of the inhabitants of the Ionian Islands are a mixture of Greek and Italian . The Venetian influence is illustrated in all aspects of culture and everyday life . In 1800 the Septinsular Republic was established ; its flag design was based on the flag of the Republic of Venice . In addition , Italian was the co @-@ official language of both the Septinsular Republic and the United States of the Ionian Islands . Because of its status , Italian was also taught at schools along with Greek and English ( Ionian Islands were a protectorate of the United Kingdom from 1815 until 1864 ) . In the First Year of the secondary education , for instance , Greek was taught four times a week , Italian three times and English twice . In the Greek Census of 1907 , 4 @,@ 675 people from the Ionian Islands stated Catholicism as their denomination , about 1 @.@ 8 % of the total population ( 254 @,@ 494 ) , while 2 @,@ 541 ( 1 % ) Ionians stated Italian as their mother tongue , making it the second language by number of speakers . The Italian language remains popular on the islands . The Hellenic Union of <unk> , a civil non @-@ profit company working for the promotion of the <unk> Culture , objected to the decision of the Ministry to abolish the teaching of Italian in schools , saying that " especially for the Ionian Islands the selection of the Italian language has become a tradition for their schools , but also a necessary language because of the many tourists from Italy and other relations e.g. cultural , commercial , etc . , of the islands with the country " and they propose " respect for the choice of the children and recognition of their right to learn the language they want and especially the Italian as it 's the language with the greatest preference on the Ionian Islands " . 
 These cultural remnants of the Venetian period were the pretext of Mussolini 's desire to incorporate the Ionian Islands into the Kingdom of Italy . Even before the outbreak of World War II and the Greek @-@ Italian War , Mussolini had expressed his wish to annex the Ionian Islands as part of his wider plans for an Italian Empire centered around the Mediterranean Sea . On 15 October , in a meeting in the Palazzo Venezia , he made the final decision to invade Greece . His initial goal was the occupation of Corfu , Zante and Cephalonia . After the fall of Greece , in early April 1941 , the invaders divided its lands into three occupation zones ; the Italians occupied much of the country , including the Ionians . Mussolini informed General Carlo Geloso that the Ionian Islands would form a separate Italian province through a de facto annexation , but the Germans would not approve it . The Italian authorities nevertheless continued to prepare the ground for the annexation . Finally , on 22 April 1941 , after discussions between the German and Italian rulers , German <unk> Adolf Hitler agreed that Italy could proceed with a de facto annexation of the islands . From then on , until the end of the war , the islands passed through a phase of <unk> in all areas , from their administration to their economy . 
 = Elk = 
 The elk , or wapiti ( Cervus canadensis ) , is one of the largest species within the deer family , Cervidae , in the world , and one of the largest land mammals in North America and Eastern Asia . This animal should not be confused with the larger moose ( Alces alces ) to which the name " elk " applies in the British Isles and Eurasia . Apart from the moose , the only other member of the deer family to rival the elk in size is the south Asian sambar ( Rusa unicolor ) . 
 Elk range in forest and forest @-@ edge habitat , feeding on grasses , plants , leaves , and bark . Male elk have large antlers which are shed each year . Males also engage in ritualized mating behaviors during the rut , including posturing , antler wrestling ( sparring ) , and <unk> , a loud series of vocalizations that establishes dominance over other males and attracts females . 
 Although they are native to North America and eastern Asia , they have adapted well to countries in which they have been introduced , including Argentina , Australia and New Zealand . Their great adaptability may threaten endemic species and ecosystems into which they have been introduced . 
 Elk are susceptible to a number of infectious diseases , some of which can be transmitted to livestock . Efforts to eliminate infectious diseases from elk populations , largely by vaccination , have had mixed success . 
 Some cultures revere the elk as a spiritual force . In parts of Asia , antlers and their velvet are used in traditional medicines . Elk are hunted as a game species . The meat is leaner and higher in protein than beef or chicken . 
 It was long believed to be a subspecies of the European red deer ( Cervus elaphus ) , but evidence from a number of mitochondrial DNA genetic studies beginning in 1998 show that the two are distinct species . Key morphological differences that distinguish C. canadensis from C. elaphus are the former 's wider rump patch and paler @-@ hued antlers . 
 = = Naming and etymology = = 
 Early European explorers in North America , who were familiar with the smaller red deer of Europe , thought that the larger North American animal resembled a moose , and consequently gave it the name elk , which is the common European name for moose . The word elk is related to the Latin alces , Old Norse <unk> , Scandinavian <unk> / <unk> and German <unk> , all of which refer to the animal known in North America as the moose . 
 The name wapiti is from the Shawnee and Cree word <unk> , meaning " white rump " . This name is used in particular for the Asian subspecies ( Altai wapiti , Tian Shan wapiti , Manchurian wapiti and Alashan wapiti ) , because in Eurasia the name elk continues to be used for the moose . 
 Asian subspecies are sometimes referred to as the maral , but this name applies primarily to the Caspian red deer ( Cervus elaphus maral ) , a subspecies of red deer . There is a subspecies of elk in Mongolia called the Altai wapiti ( Cervus canadensis sibiricus ) , also known as the Altai maral . ( The name " Siberian elk " is used for Alces alces ssp. <unk> . ) 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Members of the genus Cervus ( and hence early relatives or possible ancestors of the elk ) first appear in the fossil record 25 million years ago , during the Oligocene in Eurasia , but do not appear in the North American fossil record until the early Miocene . The extinct Irish elk ( Megaloceros ) was not a member of the genus Cervus , but rather the largest member of the wider deer family ( Cervidae ) known from the fossil record . 
 Until recently , red deer and elk were considered to be one species , Cervus elaphus . However , mitochondrial DNA studies , conducted on hundreds of samples in 2004 from red deer and elk subspecies as well as other species of the Cervus deer family , strongly indicate that elk , or wapiti , should be a distinct species , namely Cervus canadensis . The previous classification had over a dozen subspecies under the C. elaphus species designation ; DNA evidence concludes that elk are more closely related to Thorold 's deer and even sika deer than they are to the red deer . Though elk and red deer can produce fertile offspring in captivity , geographic isolation between the species in the wild and differences in mating behaviors indicate that reproduction between them outside a controlled environment would be unlikely . However , the two species have freely inter @-@ bred in New Zealand 's Fiordland National Park , where the cross @-@ bred animals have all but removed the pure elk blood from the area . 
 = = = Subspecies = = = 
 There are numerous subspecies of elk described , with six from North America and four from Asia , although some taxonomists consider them different ecotypes or races of the same species ( adapted to local environments through minor changes in appearance and behavior ) . Populations vary as to antler shape and size , body size , coloration and mating behavior . DNA investigations of the Eurasian subspecies revealed that phenotypic variation in antlers , mane and rump patch development are based on " climatic @-@ related lifestyle factors " . Of the six subspecies of elk known to have inhabited North America in historical times , four remain , including the Roosevelt ( C. canadensis roosevelti ) , tule ( C. canadensis nannodes ) , Manitoban ( C. canadensis <unk> ) and Rocky Mountain ( C. canadensis nelsoni ) . The eastern elk ( C. canadensis canadensis ) and Merriam 's elk ( C. canadensis <unk> ) subspecies have been extinct for at least a century . 
 Four subspecies described in Asia include the Altai wapiti ( C. canadensis sibiricus ) and the <unk> wapiti ( C. canadensis <unk> ) . Two distinct subspecies found in China and Korea are the Manchurian wapiti ( C. canadensis xanthopygus ) and the Alashan wapitis ( C. canadensis <unk> ) . The Manchurian wapiti is darker and more reddish in coloration than the other populations . The Alashan wapiti of north central China is the smallest of all subspecies , has the lightest coloration and is the least studied . Biologist Valerius Geist , who has written on the world 's various deer species , holds that there are only three subspecies of elk . Geist recognizes the Manchurian and Alashan wapiti but places all other elk into C. canadensis canadensis , claiming that classification of the four surviving North American groups as subspecies is driven , at least partly , for political purposes to secure individualized conservation and protective measures for each of the surviving populations . 
 Recent DNA studies suggest that there are no more than three or four subspecies of elk . All American forms seem to belong to one subspecies ( Cervus canadensis canadensis ) . Even the Siberian elk ( Cervus canadensis sibiricus ) are more or less identical to the American forms and therefore may belong to this subspecies , too . However the Manchurian wapiti ( Cervus canadensis xanthopygus ) is clearly distinct from the Siberian forms , but not distinguishable from the Alashan wapiti . The Chinese forms MacNeill 's deer , Kansu red deer , and Tibetan red deer belong also to the wapitis and were not distinguishable from each other by mitochondrial DNA studies . These Chinese subspecies are sometimes treated as a distinct species , namely the Central Asian red deer ( Cervus <unk> ) , which also includes the Kashmir stag .

 The elk is a large animal of the ungulate order Artiodactyla , possessing an even number of toes on each foot , similar to those of camels , goats and cattle . It is a ruminant species , with a four @-@ chambered stomach , and feeds on grasses , plants , leaves and bark . During the summer , elk eat almost constantly , consuming between 4 and 7 kilograms ( 8 @.@ 8 and 15 @.@ 4 lb ) of vegetation daily . In North America , males are called bulls , and females are called cows . In Asia , stag and hind , respectively , are sometimes used instead . 
 Elk are more than twice as heavy as mule deer and have a more reddish hue to their hair coloring , as well as large , buff colored rump patches and smaller tails . Moose are larger and darker than elk ; bulls have distinctively different antlers . Elk gather in herds , while moose are solitary . Elk cows average 225 to 241 kg ( 496 to 531 lb ) , stand 1 @.@ 3 m ( 4 @.@ 3 ft ) at the shoulder , and are 2 @.@ 1 m ( 6 @.@ 9 ft ) from nose to tail . Bulls are some 40 % larger than cows at maturity , weighing an average of 320 to 331 kg ( 705 to 730 lb ) , standing 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) at the shoulder and averaging 2 @.@ 45 m ( 8 @.@ 0 ft ) in length . The largest of the subspecies is the Roosevelt elk ( C. c. roosevelti ) , found west of the Cascade Range in the U.S. states of California , Oregon and Washington , and in the Canadian province of British Columbia . Roosevelt elk have been reintroduced into Alaska , where the largest males are estimated to weigh up to 600 kg ( 1 @,@ 300 lb ) . More typically , male Roosevelt <unk> weigh around 300 to 544 kg ( 661 to 1 @,@ 199 lb ) , while females weigh 260 to 285 kg ( 573 to 628 lb ) . The smallest @-@ bodied race is the tule elk ( C. c. nannodes ) , which weighs from 170 to 250 kg ( 370 to 550 lb ) in both sexes . 
 Only the males have antlers , which start growing in the spring and are shed each winter . The largest antlers may be 1 @.@ 2 metres ( 3 @.@ 9 ft ) long and weigh 18 kilograms ( 40 lb ) . Antlers are made of bone which can grow at a rate of 2 @.@ 5 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) per day . While actively growing , the antlers are covered with and protected by a soft layer of highly vascularised skin known as velvet . The velvet is shed in the summer when the antlers have fully developed . Bull elk may have eight or more tines on each antler ; however , the number of tines has little to do with the age or maturity of a particular animal . The Siberian and North American elk carry the largest antlers while the Altai wapiti have the smallest . The formation and retention of antlers is testosterone @-@ driven . After the breeding season in late fall , the level of pheromones released during estrus declines in the environment and the testosterone levels of males drop as a consequence . This drop in testosterone leads to the shedding of antlers , usually in the early winter . 
 During the fall , elk grow a thicker coat of hair , which helps to insulate them during the winter . Males , females and calves of Siberian and North American elk all grow thin neck manes ; female and young Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis do not . By early summer , the heavy winter coat has been shed , and elk are known to rub against trees and other objects to help remove hair from their bodies . All elk have small and clearly defined rump patches with short tails . They have different coloration based on the seasons and types of habitats , with gray or lighter coloration prevalent in the winter and a more reddish , darker coat in the summer . Subspecies living in arid climates tend to have lighter colored coats than do those living in forests . Most have lighter yellow @-@ brown to orange @-@ brown coats in contrast to dark brown hair on the head , neck , and legs during the summer . Forest @-@ adapted Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis have darker reddish @-@ brown coats with less contrast between the body coat and the rest of the body during the summer months . Calves are born spotted , as is common with many deer species , and they lose their spots by the end of summer . Adult Manchurian wapiti may retain a few orange spots on the back of their summer coats until they are older . This characteristic has also been observed in the forest @-@ adapted European red deer . 
 = = = Behavior = = = 
 Adult elk usually stay in single @-@ sex groups for most of the year . During the mating period known as the rut , mature bulls compete for the attentions of the cow elk and will try to defend females in their harem . Rival bulls challenge opponents by bellowing and by paralleling each other , walking back and forth . This allows potential combatants to assess the other 's antlers , body size and fighting prowess . If neither bull backs down , they engage in antler wrestling , and bulls sometimes sustain serious injuries . Bulls also dig holes in the ground , in which they urinate and roll their body . A male elk 's urethra points upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a right angle to the penis . The urine soaks into their hair and gives them a distinct smell which attracts cows . 
 Dominant bulls follow groups of cows during the rut , from August into early winter . A bull will defend his harem of 20 cows or more from competing bulls and predators . Only mature bulls have large harems and breeding success peaks at about eight years of age . Bulls between two and four years and over 11 years of age rarely have harems , and spend most of the rut on the periphery of larger harems . Young and old bulls that do acquire a harem hold it later in the breeding season than do bulls in their prime . A bull with a harem rarely feeds and he may lose up to 20 percent of his body weight . Bulls that enter the rut in poor condition are less likely to make it through to the peak conception period or have the strength to survive the rigors of the oncoming winter . 
 Bulls have a loud vocalization consisting of screams known as <unk> , which can be heard for miles . <unk> is often associated with an adaptation to open environments such as parklands , meadows , and savannas , where sound can travel great distances . Females are attracted to the males that bugle more often and have the loudest call . <unk> is most common early and late in the day and is one of the most distinctive sounds in nature , akin to the howl of the gray wolf . 
 = = = Reproduction and lifecycle = = = 
 Female elk have a short estrus cycle of only a day or two , and matings usually involve a dozen or more attempts . By the autumn of their second year , females can produce one and , very rarely , two offspring , although reproduction is most common when cows weigh at least 200 kilograms ( 440 lb ) . The gestation period is 240 to 262 days and the offspring weigh between 15 and 16 kilograms ( 33 and 35 lb ) . When the females are near to giving birth , they tend to isolate themselves from the main herd , and will remain isolated until the calf is large enough to escape predators . Calves are born spotted , as is common with many deer species , and they lose their spots by the end of summer . Manchurian wapiti may retain a few orange spots on the back of their summer coats until they are older . After two weeks , calves are able to join the herd , and are fully weaned at two months of age . Elk calves are as large as an adult white @-@ tailed deer by the time they are six months old . The offspring will remain with their mothers for almost a year , leaving about the time that the next season 's offspring are produced . The gestation period is the same for all subspecies . 
 Elk live 20 years or more in captivity but average 10 to 13 years in the wild . In some subspecies that suffer less predation , they may live an average of 15 years in the wild . 
 = = = Predators and defensive tactics = = = 
 Wolf and coyote packs and the solitary cougar are the most likely predators , although brown and black bears also prey on elk . Coyote packs mostly prey on elk calves , though they can sometimes take a winter @-@ weakened adult . In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem which includes Yellowstone National Park , bears are the most significant predators of calves . Major predators in Asia include the wolf , dhole , brown bear , Siberian tiger , Amur leopard , and snow leopard . Eurasian lynx and wild boar sometimes prey on Asian elk calves . Historically , tigers in the Lake Baikal region fed on Manchurian wapiti , and continue to do so in the Amur region . 
 Male elk retain their antlers for more than half the year and are less likely to group with other males when they have antlers . Antlers provide a means of defense , as does a strong front @-@ leg kick , which is performed by either sex if provoked . Once the antlers have been shed , bulls tend to form bachelor groups which allow them to work cooperatively at fending off predators . Herds tend to employ one or more scouts while the remaining members eat and rest . 
 After the rut , females form large herds of up to 50 individuals . Newborn calves are kept close by a series of vocalizations ; larger nurseries have an ongoing and constant chatter during the daytime hours . When approached by predators , the largest and most robust females may make a stand , using their front legs to kick at their attackers . Guttural grunts and posturing effectively deter all but the most determined predators . 
 = = = Migration = = = 
 As is true for many species of deer , especially those in mountainous regions , elk migrate into areas of higher altitude in the spring , following the retreating snows , and the opposite direction in the fall . Hunting pressure also impacts migration and movements . During the winter , they favor wooded areas and sheltered valleys for protection from the wind and availability of tree bark to eat . Roosevelt elk are generally non @-@ migratory due to less seasonal variability of food sources . 
 The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem elk herd numbers over 200 @,@ 000 individuals and during the spring and fall , they take part in the longest elk migration in the continental U.S. Elk in the southern regions of Yellowstone National Park and in the surrounding National Forests migrate south towards the town of Jackson , Wyoming , where they winter for up to six months on the National Elk Refuge . Conservationists there ensure the herd is well fed during the harsh winters . Many of the elk that reside in the northern sections of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem migrate to lower altitudes in Montana , mainly to the north and west . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 Elk are ruminants and therefore have four @-@ chambered stomachs . Unlike white @-@ tailed deer and moose which are primarily browsers , elk have a similarity to cattle as they are primarily grazers , but like other deer , they also browse . Elk have a tendency to do most of their feeding in the mornings and evenings , seeking sheltered areas in between feedings to digest . Their diets vary somewhat depending on the season , with native grasses being a year @-@ round supplement , tree bark being consumed in winter and forbs and tree sprouts during the summer . Elk consume an average of 9 @.@ 1 kilograms ( 20 lb ) of various vegetation daily . Particularly fond of aspen sprouts which rise in the spring , elk have had some impact on aspen groves which have been declining in some regions where elk exist . 
 Range and wildlife managers conduct surveys of elk pellet groups to monitor populations and resource use . 
 = = = Parasites and disease = = = 
 At least 53 species of protist and animal parasites have been identified in elk . Most of these parasites seldom lead to significant mortality among wild or captive elk . <unk> tenuis ( <unk> or meningeal worm ) is a parasitic nematode known to affect the spinal cord and brain tissue of elk and other species , leading to death . The definitive host is the white @-@ tailed deer , in which it normally has no ill effects . Snails and slugs , the intermediate hosts , can be inadvertently consumed by elk during grazing . The liver fluke <unk> magna and the nematode <unk> <unk> are also commonly found parasites that can be fatal to elk . Since infection by either of these parasites can be lethal to some commercial livestock species , their presence in elk herds is of some concern . 
 Chronic wasting disease , transmitted by a misfolded protein known as a prion , affects the brain tissue in elk , and has been detected throughout their range in North America . First documented in the late 1960s in mule deer , the disease has affected elk on game farms and in the wild in a number of regions . Elk that have contracted the disease begin to show weight loss , increased watering needs , disorientation and listlessness , and at an advanced stage the disease leads to death . The disease is similar to but not the same as mad cow disease , and no risks to humans have been documented , nor has the disease been demonstrated to pose a threat to domesticated cattle . In 2002 , South Korea banned the importation of elk antler velvet due to concerns about chronic wasting disease . 
 The Gram @-@ negative bacterial disease brucellosis occasionally affects elk in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem , the only place in the U.S. where the disease is still known to exist . In domesticated cattle , brucellosis causes infertility , abortions and reduced milk production . It is transmitted to humans as <unk> fever , producing flu @-@ like symptoms which may last for years . Though bison are more likely to transmit the disease to other animals , elk inadvertently transmitted brucellosis to horses in Wyoming and cattle in Idaho . Researchers are attempting to eradicate the disease through vaccinations and herd management measures , which are expected to be successful . 
 A recent necropsy study of captive elk in Pennsylvania attributed the cause of death in 33 of 65 cases to either gastrointestinal parasites ( 21 cases , primarily Eimeria sp. and <unk> sp . ) or bacterial infections ( 12 cases , mostly pneumonia ) .

 Modern subspecies are descended from elk that once inhabited Beringia , a steppe region between Asia and North America that connected the two continents during the Pleistocene . Beringia provided a migratory route for numerous mammal species , including brown bear , camel , horse , caribou , and moose , as well as humans . As the Pleistocene came to an end , ocean levels began to rise ; elk migrated southwards into Asia and North America . In North America they adapted to almost all ecosystems except for tundra , true deserts , and the gulf coast of the U.S. The elk of southern Siberia and central Asia were once more widespread but today are restricted to the mountain ranges west of Lake Baikal including the <unk> and Altai Mountains of Mongolia and the <unk> region that borders Kyrgyzstan , Kazakhstan , and China 's Xinjiang Province . The habitat of Siberian elk in Asia is similar to that of the Rocky Mountain subspecies in North America . 
 Throughout their range , they live in forest and in forest edge habitat , similar to other deer species . In mountainous regions , they often dwell at higher elevations in summer , migrating down slope for winter . The highly adaptable elk also inhabit semi @-@ deserts in North America , such as the Great Basin . Manchurian and Alashan wapiti are primarily forest dwellers and their smaller antler size is a likely adaptation to a forest environment . 
 = = = Introductions = = = 
 The Rocky Mountain elk subspecies has been reintroduced by hunter @-@ conservation organizations in the Appalachian region of the eastern U.S. , where the now extinct eastern elk once lived After elk were reintroduced in the states of Kentucky , North Carolina and Tennessee , they migrated into the neighboring states of Virginia and West Virginia , and have established permanent populations there . Elk have also been reintroduced to a number of other states , including Pennsylvania , Michigan , Wisconsin , and <unk> and <unk> Islands in Alaska . As of 1989 , population figures for the Rocky Mountain subspecies were 782 @,@ 500 , and estimated numbers for all North American subspecies exceeded 1 million . Prior to the European colonization of North America , there were an estimated 10 million elk on the continent . 
 Outside their native habitat , elk and other deer species , especially white tails , were introduced in areas that previously had few if any large native ungulates . Brought to these countries for hunting and ranching for meat , hides and antler velvet , they have proven highly adaptable and have often had an adverse impact on local ecosystems . Elk and red deer were introduced to Argentina in the early 20th century . There they are now considered an invasive species , encroaching on Argentinian ecosystems where they compete for food with the indigenous Chilean <unk> and other herbivores . This negative impact on native animal species has led the IUCN to identify the elk as one of the world 's 100 worst invaders . Both elk and red deer have also been introduced into Australia . 
 The introduction of deer to New Zealand began in the middle of the 19th century , and current populations are primarily European red deer , with only 15 percent being elk . There is significant hybridization of elk with the more numerous red deer to the extent that pure elk may no longer exist in the wild in New Zealand . These deer have had an adverse impact on forest regeneration of some plant species , as they consume more palatable species which are replaced with those that are less favored by the elk . The long @-@ term impact will be an alteration of the types of plants and trees found , and in other animal and plant species dependent upon them . As in Chile and Argentina , the IUCN has declared that red deer and elk populations in New Zealand are an invasive species . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 Elk have played an important role in the cultural history of a number of peoples . <unk> and petroglyphs of elk were carved into cliffs thousands of years ago by the Anasazi of the southwestern U.S. More recent Native American tribes , including the Kootenai , Cree , Blackfeet , Ojibwa and Pawnee , produced blankets and robes from elk hides . The elk was of particular importance to the Lakota , and played a spiritual role in their society . At birth , Lakota males were given an elk 's tooth to promote a long life since that was seen as the last part of dead elk to rot away . The elk was seen as having strong sexual potency and young Lakota males who had dreamed of elk would have an image of the mythical representation of the elk on their " courting coats " as a sign of sexual prowess . The Lakota believed that the mythical or spiritual elk , not the physical one , was the teacher of men and the embodiment of strength , sexual prowess and courage . 
 Neolithic petroglyphs from Asia depict antler @-@ less female elk , which have been interpreted as symbolizing rebirth and sustenance . By the beginning of the Bronze Age , the elk is depicted less frequently in rock art , coinciding with a cultural transformation away from hunting . 
 The Rocky Mountain elk is the official state animal for Utah . An image of an elk and a moose appear on the state seal and flag of Michigan . The Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks ( <unk> ) chose the elk as its namesake because a number of its attributes seemed appropriate for cultivation by members of the fraternity . A representation of the majestic head of the male , with its spreading antlers , was adopted as the first badge of the Order ; and is still the most conspicuous element of its copyrighted fraternal emblem . A prized possession of many members of the <unk> are jewel encrusted , gold mounted elk teeth – which are actually ivory . 
 = = Commercial uses = = 
 Although breakdown figures for each game species are not available in the 2006 National Survey from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , hunting of wild elk is most likely the primary economic impact . 
 Elk are held in captivity , or farmed , for hunting , meat production and velvet collection . In what is known as a canned hunt , a hunter pays a fee for an essentially guaranteed chance to shoot an elk in an escape @-@ proof range . While elk are not generally harvested for meat production on a large scale , some restaurants offer the meat as a specialty item and it is also available in some grocery stores . The meat has a taste somewhere between beef and venison and is higher in protein and lower in fat and cholesterol than beef , pork , and chicken . Elk meat is also a good source of iron , phosphorus and zinc . 
 A male elk can produce 10 to 11 kilograms ( 22 to 24 lb ) of antler velvet annually and on ranches in the United States , Canada and New Zealand , this velvet is collected and sold to markets in East Asia , where it is used in medicine . Velvet is also considered by some cultures to be an aphrodisiac . However , consuming velvet from elk in North America may be risky since velvet from animals infected with chronic wasting disease may contain prions that could result in a human getting variant Creutzfeldt @-@ Jakob disease . 
 Antlers are also used in artwork , furniture and other novelty items . All Asian subspecies , along with other deer , have been raised for their antlers in central and eastern Asia by Han Chinese , Turkic peoples , Tungusic peoples , Mongolians , and Koreans . Elk farms are relatively common in North America and New Zealand . 
 Elk hides have been used for thousands of years for tepee covering , blankets , clothing and footwear . Modern uses are more decorative , but elk skin shoes , gloves and belts are not uncommon . 
 Since 1967 , the Boy Scouts of America have assisted employees at the National Elk Refuge in Wyoming by collecting the antlers which are shed each winter . The antlers are then auctioned with 80 % of the proceeds returned to the refuge . In 2010 , 2 @,@ 520 kilograms ( 5 @,@ 560 lb ) of antlers were auctioned , bringing in over $ 46 @,@ 000 .

In its election manifesto , INC promised " Right to Health " , " Right to homestead " , " Right to social security " and " Right to pension " . During the elections , Congress leaders criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) and its prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi for being involved in low level politics . They accused Modi of favouring businessmen . The party campaigned throughout India , but suffered its worst ever defeat , winning only 44 seats over 543 constituencies ; the BJP won the election and was able to form a government with a majority for the first time since the victory of Rajiv Gandhi in 1984 . After the results were announced both Sonia and Rahul Gandhi offered to resign from their posts in the party but the Congress Working Committee rejected their resignations and criticised the government 's communication strategy for the party 's defeat .

The Congress party initiated its election campaign in January 2014 . It gave extra focus to the new middle class of India which was above the poverty line but not enough rich to be in middle class . This new economic class comprises 700 million people out of the country 's total population of 1 @.@ 2 billion . This class includes railway coolies , servants , rickshaw @-@ pullers , labourers , fishermen , guards and other people who earn their living by doing minor chores . 
 The party created a social media platform called <unk> It was designed under the supervision of national spokesperson Sandeep Dikshit with the motive of promoting the party during the elections . It was inaugurated by Rahul Gandhi during a media conclave in July 2013 . While addressing a rally in Uttarakhand on 23 February , Gandhi promised that after forming the government , INC will provide free healthcare facilitates . He accused BJP of practising " politics of blood " . On 15 March , he interacted with party workers , block , district and Pradesh Congress Committee presidents on Google Hangout for the first one hour and then with general public afterwards . This step was seen by media as a measure to counter Narendra Modi 's " Chai pe <unk> " where he interacted with people on Internet while sipping tea . The party began its campaign in Uttar Pradesh on 23 March 2014 in Pratapgarh by organising a rally which was addressed by Rahul Gandhi , Madhusudan Mistry , Pramod Tiwari and other senior party leaders . On 29 March , Rahul Gandhi shared stage with Imran Masood 's wife in Saharanpur a few hours after he was arrested for making libelous remarks on Modi .

Priyanka also said that it is not 56 @-@ inch chest but big heart , moral strength that are necessary to run the nation . She further said that Modi wanted power for himself and alleged that books defaming her family members were being dropped at night in the places where her public meetings were scheduled to take place . Agitated by the allegations BJP launched a CD and booklet titled <unk> accusing <unk> Singh Hooda and Ashok <unk> of helping Vadra in acquiring land in violation of the regulations . Priyanka Gandhi criticised this move of the BJP and compared it to " panicky rats " . She also took a pun on Modi 's remarks on Rahul Gandhi in which he called him <unk> ( prince ) and <unk> ( specimen ) , by calling Modi 's behaviour childish . 
 On 10 May , the last day of campaigning Rahul Gandhi did a roadshow in Varanasi , the constituency from where the prime ministerial candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party , Narendra Modi was contesting in the elections .

During the same month a half @-@ page advertisement titled Main Nahi Hum ( Not me , but We ) featuring Rahul Gandhi and nine people from different communities was launched for newspapers . It had a slogan — Har Hath Shakti , Har Hath <unk> ( power in every hand , progress to everyone ) . The advertisement also mocked Narendra Modi 's Gujarat model of development and spotted a punch line — " No hand has a magic wand that can be waved to achieve progress " . US @-@ based Burson @-@ Marsteller , JWT and Dentsu India , a Japanese publicity agency were given contracts to provide an image makeover for the party and its vice @-@ president Rahul Gandhi . The primary focus of the advertising was to portray " Rahul Gandhi as a young , vibrant leader who will deliver on the aspirations of the common Indian . " 
 An advertisement " Face of the Congress – <unk> <unk> Nahi , Yuva Josh " was aired through TV , Radio , hoardings , newspapers etc . It featured <unk> B Amin , who is the Congress party 's students ' Wing National Student Union of India 's state president from Goa .

 Political parties in India use the money donated by willing people and organisations to campaign for elections . The Congress party received donations from General Electoral Trust , Torrent Power Ltd , the Bharti Electoral Trust , Asianet V Holding Pvt. Ltd , the Electoral Trust and ITC Ltd. to name a few . Before the commencement of elections the Cabinet of India revised the limit of election expenditure by a candidate for Parliamentary Constituencies to ₹ 7 million ( US $ 100 @,@ 000 ) in bigger states and to ₹ 5 @.@ 4 million ( US $ 80 @,@ 000 ) in smaller states and all union territories except Delhi . This revision of the ceiling on election expenditure was attributed to the increase in the number of electors and polling stations as well as the increase in the cost inflation index .

 Former prime ministerial adviser Sanjaya Baru published a book titled The Accidental Prime Minister : The Making and <unk> of Manmohan Singh in which he criticised Singh for not being " fully in charge of his government in having to compete with the dynastic INC leader , Sonia Gandhi , for influence within his own cabinet . " Singh 's office retorted in saying it is " smacks of fiction and coloured views of a former adviser . " After Baru said " it is no secret that Sonia Gandhi was the super prime minister , " Priyanka Vadra replied " I think Manmohan Singh ji is the super PM . " The opposition targeted Sonia Gandhi on the basis of this book .

 A pneumothorax ( <unk> + thorax ; plural pneumothoraces ) is an abnormal collection of air or gas in the pleural space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall . Like pleural effusion ( liquid buildup in that space ) , pneumothorax may interfere with normal breathing . It is often called collapsed lung , although that term may also refer to atelectasis . One or both lungs may be affected . 
 A primary pneumothorax is one that occurs spontaneously without an apparent cause and in the absence of significant lung disease , while a secondary pneumothorax occurs in the presence of existing lung pathology . Pneumothoraces can be caused by physical trauma to the chest ( including blast injury ) , or as a complication of medical or surgical intervention ; in this case it is referred to as a traumatic pneumothorax . In a minority of cases of both spontaneous or traumatic pneumothorax , the amount of air in the chest increases markedly when a one @-@ way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue , leading to a tension pneumothorax . This condition is a medical emergency that can cause steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure . Unless reversed by effective treatment , these sequelae can progress and cause death . 
 Symptoms typically include chest pain and shortness of breath . Diagnosis of a pneumothorax by physical examination alone can be difficult or inconclusive ( particularly in smaller pneumothoraces ) , so a chest radiograph or computed tomography ( CT ) scan is usually used to confirm its presence . 
 Small spontaneous pneumothoraces typically resolve without treatment and require only monitoring . This approach may be most appropriate in subjects who have no significant underlying lung disease . In larger pneumothoraces , or when there are marked symptoms , the air may be extracted with a syringe or a chest tube connected to a one @-@ way valve system . Occasionally , surgical interventions may be required when tube drainage is unsuccessful , or as a preventive measure , if there have been repeated episodes . The surgical treatments usually involve pleurodesis ( in which the layers of pleura are induced to stick together ) or pleurectomy ( the surgical removal of pleural membranes ) . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 A primary spontaneous pneumothorax ( PSP ) tends to occur in a young adult without underlying lung problems , and usually causes limited symptoms . Chest pain and sometimes mild breathlessness are the usual predominant presenting features . People who are affected by PSPs are often unaware of potential danger and may wait several days before seeking medical attention . PSPs more commonly occur during changes in atmospheric pressure , explaining to some extent why episodes of pneumothorax may happen in clusters . It is rare for PSPs to cause tension pneumothoraces . 
 Secondary spontaneous pneumothoraces ( SSPs ) , by definition , occur in individuals with significant underlying lung disease . Symptoms in SSPs tend to be more severe than in PSPs , as the unaffected lungs are generally unable to replace the loss of function in the affected lungs . Hypoxemia ( decreased blood @-@ oxygen levels ) is usually present and may be observed as cyanosis ( blue discoloration of the lips and skin ) . <unk> ( accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood ) is sometimes encountered ; this may cause confusion and - if very severe - may result in comas . The sudden onset of breathlessness in someone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , cystic fibrosis , or other serious lung diseases should therefore prompt investigations to identify the possibility of a pneumothorax . 
 Traumatic pneumothorax most commonly occurs when the chest wall is pierced , such as when a stab wound or gunshot wound allows air to enter the pleural space , or because some other mechanical injury to the lung compromises the integrity of the involved structures . Traumatic pneumothoraces have been found to occur in up to half of all cases of chest trauma , with only rib fractures being more common in this group . The pneumothorax can be occult ( not readily apparent ) in half of these cases , but may enlarge - particularly if mechanical ventilation is required . They are also encountered in patients already receiving mechanical ventilation for some other reason . 
 Upon physical examination , breath sounds ( heard with a stethoscope ) may be diminished on the affected side , partly because air in the pleural space dampens the transmission of sound . Measures of the conduction of vocal vibrations to the surface of the chest may be altered . Percussion of the chest may be perceived as <unk> ( like a booming drum ) , and vocal resonance and tactile <unk> can both be noticeably decreased . Importantly , the volume of the pneumothorax can show limited correlation with the intensity of the symptoms experienced by the victim , and physical signs may not be apparent if the pneumothorax is relatively small . 
 = = = Tension pneumothorax = = = 
 Although multiple definitions exist , a tension pneumothorax is generally considered to be present when a pneumothorax ( primary spontaneous , secondary spontaneous , or traumatic ) leads to significant impairment of respiration and / or blood circulation . Tension pneumothorax tends to occur in clinical situations such as ventilation , resuscitation , trauma , or in patients with lung disease . The most common findings in people with tension pneumothorax are chest pain and respiratory distress , often with an increased heart rate ( tachycardia ) and rapid breathing ( <unk> ) in the initial stages . Other findings may include quieter breath sounds on one side of the chest , low oxygen levels and blood pressure , and displacement of the trachea away from the affected side . Rarely , there may be cyanosis ( bluish discoloration of the skin due to low oxygen levels ) , altered level of consciousness , a <unk> percussion note on examination of the affected side with reduced expansion and decreased movement , pain in the epigastrium ( upper abdomen ) , displacement of the apex beat ( heart impulse ) , and resonant sound when tapping the sternum . This is a medical emergency and may require immediate treatment without further investigations ( see below ) . 
 Tension pneumothorax may also occur in someone who is receiving mechanical ventilation , in which case it may be difficult to spot as the person is typically receiving sedation ; it is often noted because of a sudden deterioration in condition . Recent studies have shown that the development of tension features may not always be as rapid as previously thought . Deviation of the trachea to one side and the presence of raised jugular venous pressure ( distended neck veins ) are not reliable as clinical signs . 
 = = Cause = = 
 = = = Primary spontaneous = = = 
 Spontaneous pneumothoraces are divided into two types : primary , which occurs in the absence of known lung disease , and secondary , which occurs in someone with underlying lung disease . The cause of primary spontaneous pneumothorax is unknown , but established risk factors include male sex , smoking , and a family history of pneumothorax . The various suspected underlying mechanisms are discussed below . 
 = = = Secondary spontaneous = = = 
 Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in the setting of a variety of lung diseases . The most common is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , which accounts for approximately 70 % of cases . Known lung diseases that may significantly increase the risk for pneumothorax are 
 In children , additional causes include measles , echinococcosis , inhalation of a foreign body , and certain congenital malformations ( congenital cystic <unk> malformation and congenital lobar emphysema ) . 
 11 @.@ 5 % of people with a spontaneous pneumothorax have a family member who has previously experienced a pneumothorax . The hereditary conditions — Marfan syndrome , <unk> , Ehlers – Danlos syndrome , alpha 1 @-@ antitrypsin deficiency ( which leads to emphysema ) , and Birt – Hogg – Dubé syndrome — have all been linked to familial pneumothorax . Generally , these conditions cause other signs and symptoms as well , and pneumothorax is not usually the primary finding . Birt – Hogg – Dubé syndrome is caused by mutations in the FLCN gene ( located at chromosome <unk> ) , which encodes a protein named folliculin . FLCN mutations and lung lesions have also been identified in familial cases of pneumothorax where other features of Birt – Hogg – Dubé syndrome are absent . In addition to the genetic associations , the HLA haplotype <unk> is also a genetic predisposition to PSP . 
 = = = Traumatic = = = 
 A traumatic pneumothorax may result from either blunt trauma or penetrating injury to the chest wall . The most common mechanism is due to the penetration of sharp bony points at a new rib fracture , which damages lung tissue . Traumatic pneumothorax may also be observed in those exposed to blasts , even though there is no apparent injury to the chest . 
 Medical procedures , such as the insertion of a central venous catheter into one of the chest veins or the taking of biopsy samples from lung tissue , may lead to pneumothorax . The administration of positive pressure ventilation , either mechanical ventilation or non @-@ invasive ventilation , can result in barotrauma ( pressure @-@ related injury ) leading to a pneumothorax . 
 Divers who breathe from an underwater apparatus are supplied with breathing gas at ambient pressure , which results in their lungs containing gas at higher than atmospheric pressure . Divers breathing compressed air ( such as when scuba diving ) may suffer a pneumothorax as a result of barotrauma from ascending just 1 metre ( 3 ft ) while breath @-@ holding with their lungs fully inflated . An additional problem in these cases is that those with other features of decompression sickness are typically treated in a diving chamber with hyperbaric therapy ; this can lead to a small pneumothorax rapidly enlarging and causing features of tension . 
 = = Mechanism = = 
 The thoracic cavity is the space inside the chest that contains the lungs , heart , and numerous major blood vessels . On each side of the cavity , a pleural membrane covers the surface of lung ( visceral pleura ) and also lines the inside of the chest wall ( parietal pleura ) . Normally , the two layers are separated by a small amount of lubricating serous fluid . The lungs are fully inflated within the cavity because the pressure inside the airways is higher than the pressure inside the pleural space . Despite the low pressure in the pleural space , air does not enter it because there are no natural connections to an air @-@ containing passage , and the pressure of gases in the bloodstream is too low for them to be forced into the pleural space . Therefore , a pneumothorax can only develop if air is allowed to enter , through damage to the chest wall or damage to the lung itself , or occasionally because microorganisms in the pleural space produce gas . 
 Chest @-@ wall defects are usually evident in cases of injury to the chest wall , such as stab or bullet wounds ( " open pneumothorax " ) . In secondary spontaneous pneumothoraces , vulnerabilities in the lung tissue are caused by a variety of disease processes , particularly by rupturing of bullae ( large air @-@ containing lesions ) in cases of severe emphysema . Areas of necrosis ( tissue death ) may precipitate episodes of pneumothorax , although the exact mechanism is unclear . Primary spontaneous pneumothorax has for many years been thought to be caused by " blebs " ( small air @-@ filled lesions just under the pleural surface ) , which were presumed to be more common in those classically at risk of pneumothorax ( tall males ) due to mechanical factors . In PSP , blebs can be found in 77 % of cases , compared to 6 % in the general population without a history of PSP . As these healthy subjects do not all develop a pneumothorax later , the hypothesis may not be sufficient to explain all episodes ; furthermore , pneumothorax may recur even after surgical treatment of blebs . It has therefore been suggested that PSP may also be caused by areas of disruption ( porosity ) in the pleural layer , which are prone to rupture . Smoking may additionally lead to inflammation and obstruction of small airways , which account for the markedly increased risk of PSPs in smokers . Once air has stopped entering the pleural cavity , it is gradually reabsorbed . 
 Tension pneumothorax occurs when the opening that allows air to enter the pleural space functions as a one @-@ way valve , allowing more air to enter with every breath but none to escape . The body compensates by increasing the respiratory rate and tidal volume ( size of each breath ) , worsening the problem . Unless corrected , hypoxia ( decreased oxygen levels ) and respiratory arrest eventually follow . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 The symptoms of pneumothorax can be vague and inconclusive , especially in those with a small PSP ; confirmation with medical imaging is usually required . In contrast , tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency and may be treated before imaging - especially if there is severe hypoxia , very low blood pressure , or an impaired level of consciousness . In tension pneumothorax , X @-@ rays are sometimes required if there is doubt about the anatomical location of the pneumothorax . 
 = = = Chest X @-@ ray = = = 
 Traditionally a plain radiograph of the chest , ideally with the X @-@ ray beams being projected from the back ( <unk> , or " PA " ) , has been the most appropriate first investigation . These are usually performed during maximal inspiration ( holding one 's breath ) ; no added information is gathered by obtaining a chest X @-@ ray in expiration ( after exhaling ) . If the PA X @-@ ray does not show a pneumothorax but there is a strong suspicion of one , lateral X @-@ rays ( with beams projecting from the side ) may be performed , but this is not routine practice . It is not unusual for the mediastinum ( the structure between the lungs that contains the heart , great blood vessels and large airways ) to be shifted away from the affected lung due to the pressure differences . This is not equivalent to a tension pneumothorax , which is determined mainly by the constellation of symptoms , hypoxia , and shock . 
 The size of the pneumothorax ( i.e. the volume of air in the pleural space ) can be determined with a reasonable degree of accuracy by measuring the distance between the chest wall and the lung . This is relevant to treatment , as smaller pneumothoraces may be managed differently . An air rim of 2 cm means that the pneumothorax occupies about 50 % of the <unk> . British professional guidelines have traditionally stated that the measurement should be performed at the level of the hilum ( where blood vessels and airways enter the lung ) with 2 cm as the cutoff , while American guidelines state that the measurement should be done at the apex ( top ) of the lung with 3 cm differentiating between a " small " and a " large " pneumothorax . The latter method may overestimate the size of a pneumothorax if it is located mainly at the apex , which is a common occurrence . The various methods correlate poorly , but are the best easily available ways of estimating pneumothorax size . CT scanning ( see below ) can provide a more accurate determination of the size of the pneumothorax , but its routine use in this setting is not recommended . 
 Not all pneumothoraces are uniform ; some only form a pocket of air in a particular place in the chest . Small amounts of fluid may be noted on the chest X @-@ ray ( <unk> ) ; this may be blood ( <unk> ) . In some cases , the only significant abnormality may be the " deep sulcus sign " , in which the normally small space between the chest wall and the diaphragm appears enlarged due to the abnormal presence of fluid . 
 = = = Computed tomography = = = 
 Computed tomography ( CT , or " CAT scan " ) is not necessary for the diagnosis of pneumothorax , but it can be useful in particular situations . In some lung diseases , especially emphysema , it is possible for abnormal lung areas such as bullae ( large air @-@ filled sacs ) to have the same appearance as a pneumothorax on chest X @-@ ray , and it may not be safe to apply any treatment before the distinction is made and before the exact location and size of the pneumothorax is determined . In trauma , where it may not be possible to perform an upright film , chest radiography may miss up to a third of pneumothoraces , while CT remains very sensitive . 
 A further use of CT is in the identification of underlying lung lesions . In presumed primary pneumothorax , it may help to identify blebs or cystic lesions ( in anticipation of treatment , see below ) , and in secondary pneumothorax it can help to identify most of the causes listed above . 
 = = = Ultrasound = = = 
 Ultrasound is commonly used in the evaluation of people who have sustained physical trauma , for example with the FAST protocol . Ultrasound may be more sensitive than chest X @-@ rays in the identification of pneumothorax after blunt trauma to the chest . Ultrasound may also provide a rapid diagnosis in other emergency situations , and allow the quantification of the size of the pneumothorax . Several particular features on ultrasonography of the chest can be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis . 
 = = Management = = 
 The treatment of pneumothorax depends on a number of factors , and may vary from discharge with early follow @-@ up to immediate needle decompression or insertion of a chest tube . Treatment is determined by the severity of symptoms and indicators of acute illness , the presence of underlying lung disease , the estimated size of the pneumothorax on X @-@ ray , and - in some instances - on the personal preference of the person involved . 
 In traumatic pneumothorax , chest tubes are usually inserted . If mechanical ventilation is required , the risk of tension pneumothorax is greatly increased and the insertion of a chest tube is mandatory . Any open chest wound should be covered with an airtight seal , as it carries a high risk of leading to tension pneumothorax . Ideally , a dressing called the " Asherman seal " should be utilized , as it appears to be more effective than a standard " three @-@ sided " dressing . The Asherman seal is a specially designed device that adheres to the chest wall and , through a valve @-@ like mechanism , allows air to escape but not to enter the chest . 
 Tension pneumothorax is usually treated with urgent needle decompression . This may be required before transport to the hospital , and can be performed by an emergency medical technician or other trained professional . The needle or cannula is left in place until a chest tube can be inserted . If tension pneumothorax leads to cardiac arrest , needle decompression is performed as part of resuscitation as it may restore cardiac output . 
 = = = Conservative = = = 
 Small spontaneous pneumothoraces do not always require treatment , as they are unlikely to proceed to respiratory failure or tension pneumothorax , and generally resolve spontaneously . This approach is most appropriate if the estimated size of the pneumothorax is small ( defined as < 50 % of the volume of the <unk> ) , there is no breathlessness , and there is no underlying lung disease . It may be appropriate to treat a larger PSP conservatively if the symptoms are limited . Admission to hospital is often not required , as long as clear instructions are given to return to hospital if there are worsening symptoms . Further investigations may be performed as an outpatient , at which time X @-@ rays are repeated to confirm improvement , and advice given with regard to preventing recurrence ( see below ) . Estimated rates of resorption are between 1 @.@ 25 % and 2 @.@ 2 % the volume of the cavity per day . This would mean that even a complete pneumothorax would spontaneously resolve over a period of about 6 weeks . There ; however , is no high quality evidence comparing conservative to non conservative management . 
 Secondary pneumothoraces are only treated conservatively if the size is very small ( 1 cm or less air rim ) and there are limited symptoms . Admission to the hospital is usually recommended . Oxygen given at a high flow rate may accelerate resorption as much as fourfold . 
 = = = Aspiration = = = 
 In a large PSP ( > 50 % ) , or in a PSP associated with breathlessness , some professional guidelines recommend that reducing the size by aspiration is equally effective as the insertion of a chest tube . This involves the administration of local anesthetic and inserting a needle connected to a three @-@ way tap ; up to 2 @.@ 5 liters of air ( in adults ) are removed . If there has been significant reduction in the size of the pneumothorax on subsequent X @-@ ray , the remainder of the treatment can be conservative . This approach has been shown to be effective in over 50 % of cases . Compared to tube drainage , first @-@ line aspiration in PSP reduces the number of people requiring hospital admission significantly , without increasing the risk of complications . 
 Aspiration may also be considered in secondary pneumothorax of moderate size ( air rim 1 – 2 cm ) without breathlessness , with the difference that ongoing observation in hospital is required even after a successful procedure . American professional guidelines state that all large pneumothoraces - even those due to PSP - should be treated with a chest tube . Moderately sized iatrogenic traumatic pneumothoraces ( due to medical procedures ) may initially be treated with aspiration . 
 = = = Chest tube = = = 
 A chest tube ( or intercostal drain ) is the most definitive initial treatment of a pneumothorax . These are typically inserted in an area under the axilla ( armpit ) called the " safe triangle " , where damage to internal organs can be avoided ; this is delineated by a horizontal line at the level of the nipple and two muscles of the chest wall ( latissimus dorsi and pectoralis major ) . Local anesthetic is applied . Two types of tubes may be used . In spontaneous pneumothorax , small @-@ bore ( smaller than 14 F , 4 @.@ 7 mm diameter ) tubes may be inserted by the Seldinger technique , and larger tubes do not have an advantage . In traumatic pneumothorax , larger tubes ( 28 F , 9 @.@ 3 mm ) are used . 
 Chest tubes are required in PSPs that have not responded to needle aspiration , in large SSPs ( > 50 % ) , and in cases of tension pneumothorax . They are connected to a one @-@ way valve system that allows air to escape , but not to re @-@ enter , the chest . This may include a bottle with water that functions like a water seal , or a Heimlich valve . They are not normally connected to a negative pressure circuit , as this would result in rapid re @-@ expansion of the lung and a risk of pulmonary edema ( " re @-@ expansion pulmonary edema " ) . The tube is left in place until no air is seen to escape from it for a period of time , and X @-@ rays confirm re @-@ expansion of the lung . 
 If after 2 – 4 days there is still evidence of an air leak , various options are available . Negative pressure suction ( at low pressures of – 10 to – 20 cmH2O ) at a high flow rate may be attempted , particularly in PSP ; it is thought that this may accelerate the healing of the leak . Failing this , surgery may be required , especially in SSP . 
 Chest tubes are used first @-@ line when pneumothorax occurs in people with AIDS , usually due to underlying pneumocystis pneumonia ( PCP ) , as this condition is associated with prolonged air leakage . Bilateral pneumothorax ( pneumothorax on both sides ) is relatively common in people with pneumocystis pneumonia , and surgery is often required . 
 It is possible for a patient with a chest tube to be managed in an ambulatory care setting by using a Heimlich valve , although research to demonstrate the equivalence to hospitalization has been of limited quality . 
 = = = <unk> and surgery = = = 
 <unk> is a procedure that permanently eliminates the pleural space and attaches the lung to the chest wall . No long @-@ term study ( 20 years or more ) has been performed on its consequences . Good results in the short term are achieved with a thoracotomy ( surgical opening of the chest ) with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy ( stripping of the pleural lining ) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion ( scraping of the pleura ) of the inner layer . During the healing process , the lung adheres to the chest wall , effectively obliterating the pleural space . Recurrence rates are approximately 1 % . Post @-@ thoracotomy pain is relatively common . 
 A less invasive approach is thoracoscopy , usually in the form of a procedure called video @-@ assisted <unk> surgery ( VATS ) . The results from VATS @-@ based pleural abrasion are slightly worse than those achieved using thoracotomy in the short term , but produce smaller scars in the skin . Compared to open thoracotomy , VATS offers a shorter in @-@ hospital stays , less need for postoperative pain control , and a reduced risk of lung problems after surgery . VATS may also be used to achieve chemical pleurodesis ; this involves insufflation of talc , which activates an inflammatory reaction that causes the lung to adhere to the chest wall . 
 If a chest tube is already in place , various agents may be instilled through the tube to achieve chemical pleurodesis , such as talc , tetracycline , minocycline or doxycycline . Results of chemical pleurodesis tend to be worse than when using surgical approaches , but talc pleurodesis has been found to have few negative long @-@ term consequences in younger people . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 If pneumothorax occurs in a smoker , this is considered an opportunity to emphasize the markedly increased risk of recurrence in those who continue to smoke , and the many benefits of smoking cessation . It may be advisable for someone to remain off work for up to a week after a spontaneous pneumothorax . If the person normally performs heavy manual labor , several weeks may be required . Those who have undergone pleurodesis may need two to three weeks off work to recover . 
 Air travel is discouraged for up to seven days after complete resolution of a pneumothorax if recurrence does not occur . Underwater diving is considered unsafe after an episode of pneumothorax unless a preventative procedure has been performed . Professional guidelines suggest that pleurectomy be performed on both lungs and that lung function tests and CT scan normalize before diving is resumed . Aircraft pilots may also require assessment for surgery . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 A preventative procedure ( thoracotomy or thoracoscopy with pleurodesis ) may be recommended after an episode of pneumothorax , with the intention to prevent recurrence . Evidence on the most effective treatment is still conflicting in some areas , and there is variation between treatments available in Europe and the US . Not all episodes of pneumothorax require such interventions ; the decision depends largely on estimation of the risk of recurrence . These procedures are often recommended after the occurrence of a second pneumothorax . Surgery may need to be considered if someone has experienced pneumothorax on both sides ( " bilateral " ) , sequential episodes that involve both sides , or if an episode was associated with pregnancy . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 The annual age @-@ adjusted incidence rate ( AAIR ) of PSP is thought to be three to six times as high in males as in females . Fishman cites AAIR 's of 7 @.@ 4 and 1 @.@ 2 cases per 100 @,@ 000 person @-@ years in males and females , respectively . Significantly above @-@ average height is also associated with increased risk of PSP — in people who are at least 76 inches ( 1 @.@ 93 meters ) tall , the AAIR is about 200 cases per 100 @,@ 000 person @-@ years . Slim build also seems to increase the risk of PSP . 
 The risk of contracting a first spontaneous pneumothorax is elevated among male and female smokers by factors of approximately 22 and 9 , respectively , compared to matched non @-@ smokers of the same sex . Individuals who smoke at higher intensity are at higher risk , with a " greater @-@ than @-@ linear " effect ; men who smoke 10 cigarettes per day have an approximate 20 @-@ fold increased risk over comparable non @-@ smokers , while smokers consuming 20 cigarettes per day show an estimated 100 @-@ fold increase in risk . 
 In secondary spontaneous pneumothorax , the estimated annual AAIR is 6 @.@ 3 and 2 @.@ 0 cases per 100 @,@ 000 person @-@ years for males and females , respectively , with the risk of recurrence depending on the presence and severity of any underlying lung disease . Once a second episode has occurred , there is a high likelihood of subsequent further episodes . The incidence in children has not been well studied , but is estimated to be between 5 and 10 cases per 100 @,@ 000 person @-@ years . 
 Death from pneumothorax is very uncommon ( except in tension pneumothoraces ) . British statistics show an annual mortality rate of 1 @.@ 26 and 0 @.@ 62 deaths per million person @-@ years in men and women , respectively . A significantly increased risk of death is seen in older victims and in those with secondary pneumothoraces . 
 = = History = = 
 An early description of traumatic pneumothorax secondary to rib fractures appears in Imperial Surgery by Turkish surgeon <unk> <unk> ( 1385 – 1468 ) , which also recommends a method of simple aspiration . 
 <unk> was described in 1803 by Jean Marc Gaspard Itard , a student of René Laennec , who provided an extensive description of the clinical picture in 1819 . While Itard and Laennec recognized that some cases were not due to tuberculosis ( then the most common cause ) , the concept of spontaneous pneumothorax in the absence of tuberculosis ( primary pneumothorax ) was reintroduced by the Danish physician Hans <unk> in 1932 . In 1941 , the surgeons Tyson and Crandall introduced pleural abrasion for the treatment of pneumothorax . 
 Prior to the advent of anti @-@ tuberculous medications , iatrogenic pneumothoraces were intentionally given to people with tuberculosis in an effort to collapse a lobe , or entire lung , around a <unk> lesion . This was known as " resting the lung " . It was introduced by the Italian surgeon Carlo <unk> in 1888 , and publicized by the American surgeon John Benjamin Murphy in the early 20th century ( after discovering the same procedure independently ) . Murphy used the ( then ) recently discovered X @-@ ray technology to create pneumothoraces of the correct size . 
 = = Other animals = = 
 Non @-@ human animals may experience both spontaneous and traumatic pneumothorax . Spontaneous pneumothorax is , as in humans , classified as primary or secondary , while traumatic pneumothorax is divided into open and closed ( with or without chest wall damage ) . The diagnosis may be apparent to the veterinary physician because the animal exhibits difficulty breathing in , or has shallow breathing . Pneumothoraces may arise from lung lesions ( such as bullae ) or from trauma to the chest wall . In horses , traumatic pneumothorax may involve both <unk> , as the mediastinum is incomplete and there is a direct connection between the two halves of the chest . Tension pneumothorax — the presence of which may be suspected due to rapidly deteriorating heart function , absent lung sounds throughout the thorax , and a barrel @-@ shaped chest — is treated with an incision in the animal 's chest to relieve the pressure , followed by insertion of a chest tube . 
 = Gunpowder Plot = 
 The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 , in earlier centuries often called the Gunpowder Treason Plot or the Jesuit Treason , was a failed assassination attempt against King James I of England and VI of Scotland by a group of provincial English Catholics led by Robert Catesby . 
 The plan was to blow up the House of Lords during the State Opening of England 's Parliament on 5 November 1605 , as the prelude to a popular revolt in the Midlands during which James 's nine @-@ year @-@ old daughter , Princess Elizabeth , was to be installed as the Catholic head of state . Catesby may have embarked on the scheme after hopes of securing greater religious tolerance under King James had faded , leaving many English Catholics disappointed . His fellow plotters were John Wright , Thomas Wintour , Thomas Percy , Guy Fawkes , Robert Keyes , Thomas Bates , Robert Wintour , Christopher Wright , John Grant , Ambrose Rookwood , Sir Everard Digby and Francis Tresham . Fawkes , who had 10 years of military experience fighting in the Spanish Netherlands in suppression of the Dutch Revolt , was given charge of the explosives . 
 The plot was revealed to the authorities in an anonymous letter sent to William Parker , 4th Baron Monteagle , on 26 October 1605 . During a search of the House of Lords at about midnight on 4 November 1605 , Fawkes was discovered guarding 36 barrels of gunpowder — enough to reduce the House of Lords to rubble — and arrested . Most of the conspirators fled from London as they learned of the plot 's discovery , trying to enlist support along the way . Several made a stand against the pursuing Sheriff of Worcester and his men at Holbeche House ; in the ensuing battle , Catesby was one of those shot and killed . At their trial on 27 January 1606 , eight of the survivors , including Fawkes , were convicted and sentenced to be hanged , drawn and quartered . 
 Details of the assassination attempt were allegedly known by the principal Jesuit of England , Father Henry Garnet . Although he was convicted of treason and sentenced to death , doubt has been cast on how much he really knew of the plot . As its existence was revealed to him through confession , Garnet was prevented from informing the authorities by the absolute confidentiality of the confessional . Although anti @-@ Catholic legislation was introduced soon after the plot 's discovery , many important and loyal Catholics retained high office during King James I 's reign . The thwarting of the Gunpowder Plot was commemorated for many years afterwards by special sermons and other public events such as the ringing of church bells , which have evolved into the Bonfire Night of today . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Religion in England = = = 
 Between 1533 and 1540 , the Tudor King Henry VIII took control of the English Church from Rome , the start of several decades of religious tension in England . English Catholics struggled in a society dominated by the newly separate and increasingly Protestant Church of England . Henry 's daughter , Elizabeth I , responded to the growing religious divide by introducing the Elizabethan Religious Settlement , which required anyone appointed to a public or church office to swear allegiance to the monarch as head of the Church and state . The penalties for refusal were severe ; fines were imposed for recusancy , and repeat offenders risked imprisonment and execution . Catholicism became marginalised , but despite the threat of torture or execution , priests continued to practise their faith in secret . 
 = = = Succession = = = 
 Queen Elizabeth , unmarried and childless , steadfastly refused to name an heir . Many Catholics believed that her Catholic cousin , Mary , Queen of Scots , was the legitimate heir to the English throne , but she had been executed for treason in 1587 . The English Secretary of State , Robert Cecil , negotiated secretly with Mary 's son , James VI of Scotland , who had a strong claim to the English throne as Elizabeth 's first cousin twice removed . In the months before Elizabeth 's death on 24 March 1603 , Cecil prepared the way for James to succeed her . 
 Some exiled Catholics favoured Philip II of Spain 's daughter , Infanta Isabella , as Elizabeth 's successor . More moderate Catholics looked to James 's and Elizabeth 's cousin Arbella Stuart , a woman thought to have Catholic sympathies . As Elizabeth 's health deteriorated , the government detained those they considered to be the " principal papists " , and the Privy Council grew so worried that Stuart was moved closer to London to prevent her from being kidnapped by papists . 
 Despite competing claims to the English throne , the transition of power following Elizabeth 's death went smoothly . James 's succession was announced by a proclamation from Cecil on 24 March , which was generally celebrated . Leading papists , rather than causing trouble as anticipated , reacted to the news by offering their enthusiastic support for the new monarch . Jesuit priests , whose presence in England was punishable by death , also demonstrated their support for James , who was widely believed to embody " the natural order of things " . James ordered a ceasefire in the conflict with Spain , and even though the two countries were still technically at war , King Philip III sent his envoy , Don Juan de Tassis , to congratulate James on his accession . 
 For decades , the English had lived under a monarch who refused to provide an heir , but James arrived with a family and a future line of succession . His wife , Anne of Denmark , was the daughter of a king . Their eldest child , the nine @-@ year @-@ old Henry , was considered a handsome and confident boy , and their two younger children , Princess Elizabeth and Prince Charles , were proof that James was able to provide heirs to continue the Protestant monarchy . 
 = = = Early reign of James I = = = 
 James 's attitude towards Catholics was more moderate than that of his predecessor , perhaps even tolerant . He promised that he would not " persecute any that will be quiet and give an outward obedience to the law " , and believed that exile was a better solution than capital punishment : " I would be glad to have both their heads and their bodies separated from this whole island and transported beyond seas . " Some Catholics believed that the martyrdom of James 's mother , Mary , Queen of Scots , would encourage James to convert to the Catholic faith , and the Catholic houses of Europe may also have shared that hope . James received an envoy from the Habsburg Archduke Albert of the Southern Netherlands , ruler of the remaining Catholic territories after over 30 years of war in the Dutch Revolt by English @-@ supported Protestant rebels . For the Catholic expatriates engaged in that struggle , the restoration by force of a Catholic monarchy was an intriguing possibility , but following the failed Spanish invasion of England in 1588 the papacy had taken a longer @-@ term view on the return of a Catholic monarch to the English throne . 
 During the late 16th century , Catholics made several assassination attempts against Protestant rulers in Europe and in England , including plans to poison Elizabeth I. The Jesuit Juan de Mariana 's 1598 On Kings and the Education of Kings explicitly justified the assassination of the French king Henry III — who had been stabbed to death by a Catholic fanatic in 1589 — and until the 1620s , some English Catholics believed that regicide was justifiable to remove tyrants from power . Much of the " rather nervous " James I 's political writing was " concerned with the threat of Catholic assassination and refutation of the [ Catholic ] argument that ' faith did not need to be kept with heretics ' " . 
 = = = Early plots = = = 
 In the absence of any sign that James would move to end the persecution of Catholics , as some had hoped for , several members of the clergy ( including two anti @-@ Jesuit priests ) decided to take matters into their own hands . In what became known as the Bye Plot , the priests William Watson and William Clark planned to kidnap James and hold him in the Tower of London until he agreed to be more tolerant towards Catholics . Cecil received news of the plot from several sources , including the Archpriest George Blackwell , who instructed his priests to have no part in any such schemes . At about the same time , Lord Cobham , Lord Grey de Wilton , Griffin Markham and Walter Raleigh hatched what became known as the Main Plot , which involved removing James and his family and supplanting them with Arbella Stuart . Amongst others , they approached Henry IV of France for funding , but were unsuccessful . All those involved in both plots were arrested in July and tried in autumn 1603 ; Sir George Brooke was executed , but James , keen not to have too bloody a start to his reign , reprieved Cobham , Grey , and Markham while they were at the scaffold . Raleigh , who had watched while his colleagues sweated , and who was due to be executed a few days later , was also pardoned . Stuart denied any knowledge of the Main Plot . The two priests , condemned by the pope , and " very bloodily handled " , were executed . 
 The Catholic community responded to news of these plots with shock . That the Bye Plot had been revealed by Catholics was instrumental in saving them from further persecution , and James was grateful enough to allow pardons for those recusants who sued for them , as well as postponing payment of their fines for a year . 
 On 19 February 1604 , shortly after he discovered that his wife , Queen Anne , had been sent a rosary from the pope via one of James 's spies , Sir Anthony Standen , James denounced the Catholic Church . Three days later , he ordered all Jesuits and all other Catholic priests to leave the country , and reimposed the collection of fines for recusancy . James changed his focus from the anxieties of English Catholics to the establishment of an Anglo @-@ Scottish union . He also appointed Scottish nobles such as George Home to his court , which proved unpopular with the Parliament of England . Some Members of Parliament made it clear that in their view , the " effluxion of people from the Northern parts " was unwelcome , and compared them to " plants which are transported from barren ground into a more fertile one " . Even more discontent resulted when the King allowed his Scottish nobles to collect the recusancy fines . There were 5 @,@ 560 convicted of recusancy in 1605 , of whom 112 were landowners . The very few Catholics of great wealth who refused to attend services at their parish church were fined £ 20 per month . Those of more moderate means had to pay two @-@ thirds of their annual rental income ; middle class recusants were fined one shilling a week , although the collection of all these fines was " haphazard and negligent " . When James came to power , almost £ 5 @,@ 000 a year ( equivalent to over £ 10 million in 2008 ) was being raised by these fines . 
 On 19 March , the King gave his opening speech to his first English Parliament in which he spoke of his desire to secure peace , but only by " profession of the true religion " . He also spoke of a Christian union and reiterated his desire to avoid religious persecution . For the Catholics , the King 's speech made it clear that they were not to " increase their number and strength in this Kingdom " , that " they might be in hope to erect their Religion again " . To Father John Gerard , these words were almost certainly responsible for the heightened levels of persecution the members of his faith now suffered , and for the priest Oswald Tesimond they were a rebuttal of the early claims that the King had made , upon which the papists had built their hopes . A week after James 's speech , Lord Sheffield informed the king of over 900 recusants brought before the Assizes in Normanby , and on 24 April a Bill was introduced in Parliament which threatened to outlaw all English followers of the Catholic Church .

 The conspirators ' principal aim was to kill King James , but many other important targets would also be present at the State Opening , including the monarch 's nearest relatives and members of the Privy Council . The senior judges of the English legal system , most of the Protestant aristocracy , and the bishops of the Church of England would all have attended in their capacity as members of the House of Lords , along with the members of the House of Commons . Another important objective was the kidnapping of the King 's daughter , third in the line of succession , Princess Elizabeth . Housed at Coombe Abbey near Coventry , the Princess lived only ten miles north of Warwick — convenient for the plotters , most of whom lived in the Midlands . Once the King and his Parliament were dead , the plotters intended to install Elizabeth on the English throne as a titular Queen . The fate of Princes Henry and Charles would be improvised ; their role in state ceremonies was , as yet , uncertain . The plotters planned to use Henry Percy , Earl of Northumberland , as Elizabeth 's Protector , but most likely never informed him of this .

 Robert Catesby ( 1573 – 1605 ) , a man of " ancient , historic and distinguished lineage " , was the inspiration behind the plot . He was described by contemporaries as " a good @-@ looking man , about six feet tall , athletic and a good swordsman " . Along with several other conspirators , he took part in the Earl of Essex 's rebellion in 1601 , during which he was wounded and captured . Queen Elizabeth allowed him to escape with his life after fining him 4 @,@ 000 marks ( equivalent to more than £ 6 million in 2008 ) , after which he sold his estate in Chastleton . In 1603 Catesby helped to organise a mission to the new king of Spain , Philip III , urging Philip to launch an invasion attempt on England , which they assured him would be well supported , particularly by the English Catholics . Thomas Wintour ( 1571 – 1606 ) was chosen as the emissary , but the Spanish king , although sympathetic to the plight of Catholics in England , was intent on making peace with James . Wintour had also attempted to convince the Spanish envoy Don Juan de Tassis that " 3 @,@ 000 Catholics " were ready and waiting to support such an invasion . Concern was voiced by Pope Clement VIII that using violence to achieve a restoration of Catholic power in England would result in the destruction of those that remained . 
 According to contemporary accounts , in February 1604 Catesby invited Thomas Wintour to his house in Lambeth , where they discussed Catesby 's plan to re @-@ establish Catholicism in England by blowing up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament . Wintour was known as a competent scholar , able to speak several languages , and he had fought with the English army in the Netherlands . His uncle , Francis Ingleby , had been executed for being a Catholic priest in 1586 , and Wintour later converted to Catholicism . Also present at the meeting was John Wright , a devout Catholic said to be one of the best swordsmen of his day , and a man who had taken part with Catesby in the Earl of Essex 's rebellion three years earlier . Despite his reservations over the possible repercussions should the attempt fail , Wintour agreed to join the conspiracy , perhaps persuaded by Catesby 's rhetoric : " Let us give the attempt and where it <unk> , pass no further . " 
 Wintour travelled to Flanders to enquire about Spanish support . While there he sought out Guy Fawkes ( 1570 – 1606 ) , a committed Catholic who had served as a soldier in the Southern Netherlands under the command of William Stanley , and who in 1603 was recommended for a captaincy . Accompanied by John Wright 's brother Christopher , Fawkes had also been a member of the 1603 delegation to the Spanish court pleading for an invasion of England . Wintour told Fawkes that " some good <unk> of his wished his company in Ingland " , and that certain gentlemen " were uppon a resolution to doe some whatt in Ingland if the pece with Spain healped us nott " . The two men returned to England late in April 1604 , telling Catesby that Spanish support was unlikely . Thomas Percy , Catesby 's friend and John Wright 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , was introduced to the plot several weeks later . Percy had found employment with his kinsman the Earl of Northumberland , and by 1596 was his agent for the family 's northern estates . About 1600 – 1601 he served with his patron in the Low Countries . At some point during Northumberland 's command in the Low Countries , Percy became his agent in his communications with James . Percy was reputedly a " serious " character who had converted to the Catholic faith . His early years were , according to a Catholic source , marked by a tendency to rely on " his sword and personal courage " . Northumberland , although not a Catholic himself , planned to build a strong relationship with James in order to better the prospects of English Catholics , and to reduce the family disgrace caused by his separation from his wife Martha Wright , a favourite of Elizabeth . Thomas Percy 's meetings with James seemed to go well . Percy returned with promises of support for the Catholics , and Northumberland believed that James would go so far as to allow Mass in private houses , so as not to cause public offence . Percy , keen to improve his standing , went further , claiming that the future King would guarantee the safety of English Catholics .

 The first meeting between the five conspirators took place on 20 May 1604 , probably at the Duck and Drake Inn , just off the Strand , Thomas Wintour 's usual residence when staying in London . Catesby , Thomas Wintour , and John Wright were in attendance , joined by Guy Fawkes and Thomas Percy . Alone in a private room , the five plotters swore an oath of secrecy on a prayer book . By coincidence , and ignorant of the plot , Father John Gerard ( a friend of Catesby 's ) was celebrating Mass in another room , and the five men subsequently received the Eucharist . 
 = = = Further recruitment = = = 
 Following their oath , the plotters left London and returned to their homes . The adjournment of Parliament gave them , they thought , until February 1605 to finalise their plans . On 9 June , Percy 's patron , the Earl of Northumberland , appointed him to the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms , a mounted troop of 50 bodyguards to the King . This role gave Percy reason to seek a base in London , and a small property near the Prince 's Chamber owned by Henry Ferrers , a tenant of John Whynniard , was chosen . Percy arranged for the use of the house through Northumberland 's agents , Dudley Carleton and John Hippisley . Fawkes , using the pseudonym " John Johnson " , took charge of the building , posing as Percy 's servant . The building was occupied by Scottish commissioners appointed by the King to consider his plans for the unification of England and Scotland , so the plotters hired Catesby 's lodgings in Lambeth , on the opposite bank of the Thames , from where their stored gunpowder and other supplies could be conveniently rowed across each night . Meanwhile , King James continued with his policies against the Catholics , and Parliament pushed through anti @-@ Catholic legislation , until its adjournment on 7 July . 
 The conspirators returned to London in October 1604 , when Robert Keyes , a " desperate man , ruined and indebted " was admitted to the group . His responsibility was to take charge of Catesby 's house in Lambeth , where the gunpowder and other supplies were to be stored . Keyes 's family had notable connections ; his wife 's employer was the Catholic Lord Mordaunt . Tall , with a red beard , he was seen as trustworthy and , like Fawkes , capable of looking after himself . In December Catesby recruited his servant , Thomas Bates , into the plot , after the latter accidentally became aware of it . 
 It was announced on 24 December that the re @-@ opening of Parliament would be delayed . Concern over the plague meant that rather than sitting in February , as the plotters had originally planned for , Parliament would not sit again until 3 October 1605 . The contemporaneous account of the prosecution claimed that during this delay the conspirators were digging a tunnel beneath Parliament . This may have been a government fabrication , as no evidence for the existence of a tunnel was presented by the prosecution , and no trace of one has ever been found . The account of a tunnel comes directly from Thomas Wintour 's confession , and Guy Fawkes did not admit the existence of such a scheme until his fifth interrogation . Logistically , digging a tunnel would have proved extremely difficult , especially as none of the conspirators had any experience of mining . If the story is true , by 6 December the Scottish commissioners had finished their work , and the conspirators were busy tunnelling from their rented house to the House of Lords . They ceased their efforts when , during tunnelling , they heard a noise from above . The noise turned out to be the then @-@ tenant 's widow , who was clearing out the undercroft directly beneath the House of Lords — the room where the plotters eventually stored the gunpowder . 
 By the time the plotters reconvened at the start of the old style new year on Lady Day , 25 March , three more had been admitted to their ranks ; Robert Wintour , John Grant , and Christopher Wright . The additions of Wintour and Wright were obvious choices . Along with a small fortune , Robert Wintour inherited Huddington Court ( a known refuge for priests ) near Worcester , and was reputedly a generous and well @-@ liked man . A devout Catholic , he married Gertrude Talbot , who was from a family of recusants . Christopher Wright ( 1568 – 1605 ) , John 's brother , had also taken part in the Earl of Essex 's revolt and had moved his family to <unk> in Lincolnshire , then known as something of a haven for priests . John Grant was married to Wintour 's sister , Dorothy , and was lord of the manor of Norbrook near Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon . Reputed to be an intelligent , thoughtful man , he sheltered Catholics at his home at Snitterfield , and was another who had been involved in the Essex revolt of 1601 . 
 = = = Undercroft = = = 
 In addition , 25 March was the day on which the plotters purchased the lease to the undercroft they had supposedly tunnelled near to , owned by John Whynniard . The Palace of Westminster in the early 17th century was a warren of buildings clustered around the medieval chambers , chapels , and halls of the former royal palace that housed both Parliament and the various royal law courts . The old palace was easily accessible ; merchants , lawyers , and others , lived and worked in the lodgings , shops , and taverns within its precincts . Whynniard 's building was along a right @-@ angle to the House of Lords , alongside a passageway called Parliament Place , which itself led to Parliament Stairs and the River Thames . <unk> were common features at the time , used to house a variety of materials including food and firewood . Whynniard 's undercroft , on the ground floor , was directly beneath the first @-@ floor House of Lords , and may once have been part of the palace 's medieval kitchen . Unused and filthy , its location was ideal for what the group planned to do . 
 In the second week of June Catesby met in London the principal Jesuit in England , Father Henry Garnet , and asked him about the morality of entering into an undertaking which might involve the destruction of the innocent , together with the guilty . Garnet answered that such actions could often be excused , but according to his own account later admonished Catesby during a second meeting in July in Essex , showing him a letter from the pope which forbade rebellion . Soon after , the Jesuit priest Oswald Tesimond told Garnet he had taken Catesby 's confession , in the course of which he had learnt of the plot . Garnet and Catesby met for a third time on 24 July 1605 , at the house of the wealthy catholic Anne Vaux in Enfield Chase . Garnet decided that Tesimond 's account had been given under the seal of the confessional , and that canon law therefore forbade him to repeat what he had heard . Without acknowledging that he was aware of the precise nature of the plot , Garnet attempted to dissuade Catesby from his course , to no avail . Garnet wrote to a colleague in Rome , Claudio Acquaviva , expressing his concerns about open rebellion in England . He also told Acquaviva that " there is a risk that some private endeavour may commit treason or use force against the King " , and urged the pope to issue a public brief against the use of force . 
 According to Fawkes , 20 barrels of gunpowder were brought in at first , followed by 16 more on 20 July . The supply of gunpowder was theoretically controlled by the government , but it was easily obtained from illicit sources . On 28 July , the ever @-@ present threat of the plague again delayed the opening of Parliament , this time until Tuesday 5 November . Fawkes left the country for a short time . The King , meanwhile , spent much of the summer away from the city , hunting . He stayed wherever was convenient , including on occasion at the houses of prominent Catholics . Garnet , convinced that the threat of an uprising had receded , travelled the country on a pilgrimage . 
 It is uncertain when Fawkes returned to England , but he was back in London by late August , when he and Wintour discovered that the gunpowder stored in the undercroft had decayed . More gunpowder was brought into the room , along with firewood to conceal it . The final three conspirators were recruited in late 1605 . At Michaelmas , Catesby persuaded the staunchly Catholic Ambrose Rookwood to rent Clopton House near Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon . Rookwood was a young man with recusant connections , whose stable of horses at Coldham Hall in <unk> , Suffolk was an important factor in his enlistment . His parents , Robert Rookwood and Dorothea Drury , were wealthy landowners , and had educated their son at a Jesuit school near Calais . Everard Digby was a young man who was generally well liked , and lived at Gayhurst House in Buckinghamshire . He had been knighted by the King in April 1603 , and was converted to Catholicism by Gerard . Digby and his wife , Mary <unk> , had accompanied the priest on his pilgrimage , and the two men were reportedly close friends . Digby was asked by Catesby to rent Coughton Court near Alcester . Digby also promised £ 1 @,@ 500 after Percy failed to pay the rent due for the properties he had taken in Westminster . Finally , on 14 October Catesby invited Francis Tresham into the conspiracy . Tresham was the son of the Catholic Thomas Tresham , and a cousin to Robert Catesby — the two had been raised together . He was also the heir to his father 's large fortune , which had been depleted by recusant fines , expensive tastes , and by Francis and Catesby 's involvement in the Essex revolt . 
 Catesby and Tresham met at the home of Tresham 's brother @-@ in @-@ law and cousin , Lord Stourton . In his confession , Tresham claimed that he had asked Catesby if the plot would damn their souls , to which Catesby had replied it would not , and that the plight of England 's Catholics required that it be done . Catesby also apparently asked for £ 2 @,@ 000 , and the use of Rushton Hall in Northamptonshire . Tresham declined both offers ( although he did give £ 100 to Thomas Wintour ) , and told his interrogators that he had moved his family from Rushton to London in advance of the plot ; hardly the actions of a guilty man , he claimed . 
 = = = Monteagle letter = = = 
 The details of the plot were finalised in October , in a series of taverns across London and Daventry . Fawkes would be left to light the fuse and then escape across the Thames , while simultaneously a revolt in the Midlands would help to ensure the capture of Princess Elizabeth . Fawkes would leave for the continent , to explain events in England to the European Catholic powers . 
 The wives of those involved and Anne Vaux ( a friend of Garnet who often shielded priests at her home ) became increasingly concerned by what they suspected was about to happen . Several of the conspirators expressed worries about the safety of fellow Catholics who would be present in Parliament on the day of the planned explosion . Percy was concerned for his patron , Northumberland , and the young Earl of Arundel 's name was brought up ; Catesby suggested that a minor wound might keep him from the chamber on that day . The Lords Vaux , Montague , Monteagle , and Stourton were also mentioned . Keyes suggested warning Lord Mordaunt , his wife 's employer , to derision from Catesby . 
 On Saturday 26 October , Monteagle ( Tresham 's brother @-@ in @-@ law ) received an anonymous letter while at his house in Hoxton . Having broken the seal , he handed the letter to a servant who read it aloud : 
 My Lord , out of the love I bear to some of your friends , I have a care of your preservation . Therefore I would advise you , as you tender your life , to devise some excuse to shift your attendance at this parliament ; for God and man hath concurred to punish the wickedness of this time . And think not slightly of this advertisement , but retire yourself into your country where you may expect the event in safety . For though there be no appearance of any stir , yet I say they shall receive a terrible blow this Parliament ; and yet they shall not see who hurts them . This counsel is not to be condemned because it may do you good and can do you no harm ; for the danger is passed as soon as you have burnt the letter . And I hope God will give you the grace to make good use of it , to whose holy protection I commend you . 
 Uncertain of the letter 's meaning , Monteagle promptly rode to Whitehall and handed it to Cecil ( then Earl of Salisbury ) . Salisbury informed the Earl of Worcester , considered to have recusant sympathies , and the suspected papist Henry Howard , 1st Earl of Northampton , but kept news of the plot from the King , who was busy hunting in Cambridgeshire and not expected back for several days . Monteagle 's servant , Thomas Ward , had family connections with the Wright brothers , and sent a message to Catesby about the betrayal . Catesby , who had been due to go hunting with the King , suspected that Tresham was responsible for the letter , and with Thomas Wintour confronted the recently recruited conspirator . Tresham managed to convince the pair that he had not written the letter , but urged them to abandon the plot . Salisbury was already aware of certain stirrings before he received the letter , but did not yet know the exact nature of the plot , or who exactly was involved . He therefore elected to wait , to see how events unfolded . 
 = = = Discovery = = = 
 The letter was shown to the King on Friday 1 November following his arrival back in London . Upon reading it , James immediately seized upon the word " blow " and felt that it hinted at " some strategem of fire and powder " , perhaps an explosion exceeding in violence the one that killed his father , Lord Darnley , at Kirk o ' Field in 1567 . Keen not to seem too intriguing , and wanting to allow the King to take the credit for unveiling the conspiracy , Salisbury feigned ignorance . The following day members of the Privy Council visited the King at the Palace of Whitehall and informed him that , based on the information that Salisbury had given them a week earlier , on Monday the Lord Chamberlain Thomas Howard , 1st Earl of Suffolk would undertake a search of the Houses of Parliament , " both above and below " . On Sunday 3 November Percy , Catesby and Wintour had a final meeting , where Percy told his colleagues that they should " abide the uttermost <unk> " , and reminded them of their ship waiting at anchor on the Thames . By 4 November Digby was ensconced with a " hunting party " at Dunchurch , ready to abduct Princess Elizabeth . The same day , Percy visited the Earl of Northumberland — who was uninvolved in the conspiracy — to see if he could discern what rumours surrounded the letter to Monteagle . Percy returned to London and assured Wintour , John Wright , and Robert Keyes that they had nothing to be concerned about , and returned to his lodgings on Gray 's Inn Road . That same evening Catesby , likely accompanied by John Wright and Bates , set off for the Midlands . Fawkes visited Keyes , and was given a pocket watch left by Percy , to time the fuse , and an hour later Rookwood received several engraved swords from a local cutler . 
 Although two accounts of the number of searches and their timing exist , according to the King 's version , the first search of the buildings in and around Parliament was made on Monday 4 November — as the plotters were busy making their final preparations — by Suffolk , Monteagle , and John Whynniard . They found a large pile of firewood in the undercroft beneath the House of Lords , accompanied by what they presumed to be a serving man ( Fawkes ) , who told them that the firewood belonged to his master , Thomas Percy . They left to report their findings , at which time Fawkes also left the building . The mention of Percy 's name aroused further suspicion as he was already known to the authorities as a Catholic agitator . The King insisted that a more thorough search be undertaken . Late that night , the search party , headed by Thomas Knyvet , returned to the undercroft . They again found Fawkes , dressed in a cloak and hat , and wearing boots and spurs . He was arrested , whereupon he gave his name as John Johnson . He was carrying a lantern now held in the Ashmolean Museum , Oxford , and a search of his person revealed a pocket watch , several slow matches and <unk> . The barrels of gunpowder were discovered hidden under piles of faggots and coal . Fawkes was taken to the King early on the morning of 5 November . 
 = = = Flight = = = 
 As news of " John Johnson 's " arrest spread among the plotters still in London , most fled northwest , along Watling Street . Christopher Wright and Thomas Percy left together . Rookwood left soon after , and managed to cover 30 miles in two hours on one horse . He overtook Keyes , who had set off earlier , then Wright and Percy at Little Brickhill , before catching Catesby , John Wright , and Bates on the same road . Reunited , the group continued northwest to Dunchurch , using horses provided by Digby . Keyes went to Mordaunt 's house at Drayton . Meanwhile , Thomas Wintour stayed in London , and even went to Westminster to see what was happening . When he realised the plot had been uncovered , he took his horse and made for his sister 's house at Norbrook , before continuing to Huddington Court . 
 The group of six conspirators stopped at Ashby St Ledgers at about 6 pm , where they met Robert Wintour and updated him on their situation . They then continued on to Dunchurch , and met with Digby . Catesby convinced him that despite the plot 's failure , an armed struggle was still a real possibility . He announced to Digby 's " hunting party " that the King and Salisbury were dead , before the fugitives moved west to Warwick . 
 In London , news of the plot was spreading , and the authorities set extra guards on the city gates , closed the ports , and protected the house of the Spanish Ambassador , which was surrounded by an angry mob . An arrest warrant was issued against Thomas Percy , and his patron , the Earl of Northumberland , was placed under house arrest . In " John Johnson 's " initial interrogation he revealed nothing other than the name of his mother , and that he was from Yorkshire . A letter to Guy Fawkes was discovered on his person , but he claimed that name was one of his aliases . Far from denying his intentions , " Johnson " stated that it had been his purpose to destroy the King and Parliament . Nevertheless , he maintained his composure and insisted that he had acted alone . His unwillingness to yield so impressed the King that he described him as possessing " a Roman resolution " . 
 = = = Investigation = = = 
 On 6 November , the Lord Chief Justice , Sir John Popham ( a man with a deep @-@ seated hatred of Catholics ) questioned Rookwood 's servants . By the evening he had learnt the names of several of those involved in the conspiracy : Catesby , Rookwood , Keyes , Wynter [ sic ] , John and Christopher Wright , and Grant . " Johnson " meanwhile persisted with his story , and along with the gunpowder he was found with , was moved to the Tower of London , where the King had decided that " Johnson " would be tortured . The use of torture was forbidden , except by royal prerogative or a body such as the Privy Council or Star Chamber . In a letter of 6 November James wrote : " The gentler <unk> [ tortures ] are to be first used unto him , et sic per gradus ad ima <unk> [ and thus by steps extended to greater ones ] , and so God speed your good work . " " Johnson " may have been placed in manacles and hung from the wall , but he was almost certainly subjected to the horrors of the rack . On 7 November his resolve was broken ; he confessed late that day , and again over the following two days . 
 = = = Last stand = = = 
 On 6 November , with Fawkes maintaining his silence , the fugitives raided Warwick Castle for supplies and continued to Norbrook to collect weapons . From there they continued their journey to Huddington . Bates left the group and travelled to Coughton Court to deliver a letter from Catesby , to Father Garnet and the other priests , informing them of what had transpired , and asking for their help in raising an army . Garnet replied by begging Catesby and his followers to stop their " wicked actions " , before himself fleeing . Several priests set out for Warwick , worried about the fate of their colleagues . They were caught , and then imprisoned in London . Catesby and the others arrived at Huddington early in the afternoon , and were met by Thomas Wintour . They received practically no support or sympathy from those they met , including family members , who were terrified at the prospect of being associated with treason . They continued on to Holbeche House on the border of Staffordshire , the home of Stephen Littleton , a member of their ever @-@ decreasing band of followers . Tired and desperate , they spread out some of the now @-@ soaked gunpowder in front of the fire , to dry out . Although gunpowder does not explode unless physically contained , a spark from the fire landed on the powder and the resultant flames engulfed Catesby , Rookwood , Grant , and a man named Morgan ( a member of the hunting party ) . 
 Thomas Wintour and Littleton , on their way from Huddington to Holbeche House , were told by a messenger that Catesby had died . At that point , Littleton left , but Thomas arrived at the house to find Catesby alive , albeit scorched . John Grant was not so lucky , and had been blinded by the fire . Digby , Robert Wintour , John Wintour , and Thomas Bates , had all left . Of the plotters , only the singed figures of Catesby and Grant , and the Wright brothers , Rookwood , and Percy , remained . The fugitives resolved to stay in the house and wait for the arrival of the King 's men . 
 Richard Walsh ( Sheriff of Worcestershire ) and his company of 200 men besieged Holbeche House on the morning of 8 November . Thomas Wintour was hit in the shoulder while crossing the courtyard . John Wright was shot , followed by his brother , and then Rookwood . Catesby and Percy were reportedly killed by a single lucky shot . The attackers rushed the property , and stripped the dead or dying defenders of their clothing . Grant , Morgan , Rookwood , and Wintour were arrested . 
 = = Reaction = = 
 Bates and Keyes were captured shortly after Holbeche House was taken . Digby , who had intended to give himself up , was caught by a small group of pursuers . Tresham was arrested on 12 November , and taken to the Tower three days later . Montague , Mordaunt , and Stourton ( Tresham 's brother @-@ in @-@ law ) were also imprisoned in the Tower . The Earl of Northumberland joined them on 27 November . Meanwhile the government used the revelation of the plot to accelerate its persecution of Catholics . The home of Anne Vaux at Enfield Chase was searched , revealing the presence of trap doors and hidden passages . A terrified servant then revealed that Garnet , who had often stayed at the house , had recently given a Mass there . Father John Gerard was secreted at the home of Elizabeth Vaux , in Harrowden . Elizabeth was taken to London for interrogation . There she was resolute ; she had never been aware that Gerard was a priest , she had presumed he was a " Catholic gentleman " , and she did not know of his whereabouts . The homes of the conspirators were searched , and looted ; Mary Digby 's household was ransacked , and she was made destitute . Some time before the end of November , Garnet moved to Hindlip Hall near Worcester , the home of the <unk> , where he wrote a letter to the Privy Council protesting his innocence . 
 The foiling of the Gunpowder Plot initiated a wave of national relief at the delivery of the King and his sons , and inspired in the ensuing parliament a mood of loyalty and goodwill , which Salisbury astutely exploited to extract higher subsidies for the King than any ( bar one ) granted in Elizabeth 's reign . Walter Raleigh , who was languishing in the Tower owing to his involvement in the Main Plot , and whose wife was a first cousin of Lady Catesby , declared he had had no knowledge of the conspiracy . The Bishop of Rochester gave a sermon at St. Paul 's Cross , in which he condemned the plot . In his speech to both Houses on 9 November , James expounded on two emerging preoccupations of his monarchy : the divine right of kings and the Catholic question . He insisted that the plot had been the work of only a few Catholics , not of the English Catholics as a whole , and he reminded the assembly to rejoice at his survival , since kings were divinely appointed and he owed his escape to a miracle . Salisbury wrote to his English ambassadors abroad , informing them of what had occurred , and also reminding them that the King bore no ill will to his Catholic neighbours . The foreign powers largely distanced themselves from the plotters , calling them atheists and Protestant heretics . 
 = = = Interrogations = = = 
 Sir Edward Coke ( pronounced " Cook " ) was in charge of the interrogations . Over a period of about ten weeks , in the Lieutenant 's Lodgings at the Tower of London ( now known as the Queen 's House ) he questioned those who had been implicated in the plot . For the first round of interrogations , no real proof exists that these people were tortured , although on several occasions Salisbury certainly suggested that they should be . Coke later revealed that the threat of torture was in most cases enough to elicit a confession from those caught up in the aftermath of the plot . 
 Only two confessions were printed in full : Fawkes 's confession of 8 November , and Wintour 's of 23 November . Having been involved in the conspiracy from the start ( unlike Fawkes ) , Wintour was able to give extremely valuable information to the Privy Council . The handwriting on his testimony is almost certainly that of the man himself , but his signature was markedly different . Wintour had previously only ever signed his name as such , but his confession is signed " Winter " , and since he had been shot in the shoulder , the steady hand used to write the signature may indicate some measure of government interference — or it may indicate that writing a shorter version of his name was less painful . Wintour 's testimony makes no mention of his brother , Robert . Both were published in the so @-@ called King 's Book , a hastily written official account of the conspiracy published in late November 1605 . 
 Henry Percy , Earl of Northumberland , was in a difficult position . His midday dinner with Thomas Percy on 4 November was damning evidence against him , and after Thomas Percy 's death there was nobody who could either implicate him or clear him . The Privy Council suspected that Northumberland would have been Princess Elizabeth 's protector had the plot succeeded , but there was insufficient evidence to convict him . Northumberland remained in the Tower and on 27 June 1606 was finally charged with contempt . He was stripped of all public offices , fined £ 30 @,@ 000 ( about £ 5 @.@ 9 million in 2016 ) , and kept in the Tower until June 1621 . The Lords Mordaunt and Stourton were tried in the Star Chamber . They were condemned to imprisonment in the Tower , where they remained until 1608 , when they were transferred to the Fleet Prison . Both were also given significant fines . 
 Several other people not involved in the conspiracy , but known or related to the conspirators , were also questioned . Northumberland 's brothers , Sir Allen and Sir Josceline , were arrested . Anthony @-@ Maria Browne , 2nd Viscount Montagu had employed Fawkes at an early age , and had also met Catesby on 29 October , and was therefore of interest ; he was released several months later . Agnes Wenman was from a Catholic family , and related to Elizabeth Vaux . She was examined twice but the charges against her were eventually dropped . Percy 's secretary and later the controller of Northumberland 's household , Dudley Carleton , had leased the vault where the gunpowder was stored , and consequently he was imprisoned in the Tower . Salisbury believed his story , and authorised his release . 
 = = = Jesuits = = = 
 Thomas Bates confessed on 4 December , providing much of the information that Salisbury needed to link the Catholic clergy to the plot . Bates had been present at most of the conspirators ' meetings , and under interrogation he implicated Father Tesimond in the plot . On 13 January 1606 he described how he had visited Garnet and Tesimond on 7 November to inform Garnet of the plot 's failure . Bates also told his interrogators of his ride with Tesimond to Huddington , before the priest left him to head for the <unk> at Hindlip Hall , and of a meeting between Garnet , Gerard , and Tesimond in October 1605 . At about the same time in December , Tresham 's health began to deteriorate . He was visited regularly by his wife , a nurse , and his servant William Vavasour , who documented his strangury . Before he died Tresham had also told of Garnet 's involvement with the 1603 mission to Spain , but in his last hours he retracted some of these statements . Nowhere in his confession did he mention the Monteagle letter . He died early on the morning of 23 December , and was buried in the Tower . Nevertheless he was attainted along with the other plotters , his head was set on a pike either at Northampton or London Bridge , and his estates confiscated . 
 On 15 January a proclamation named Father Garnet , Father Gerard , and Father Greenway ( Tesimond ) as wanted men . Tesimond and Gerard managed to escape the country and live out their days in freedom ; Garnet was not so lucky . Several days earlier , on 9 January , Robert Wintour and Stephen Littleton were captured . Their hiding place at Hagley , the home of Humphrey Littleton ( brother of MP John Littleton , imprisoned for treason in 1601 for his part in the Essex revolt ) was betrayed by a cook , who grew suspicious of the amount of food sent up for his master 's consumption . Humphrey denied the presence of the two fugitives , but another servant led the authorities to their hiding place . On 20 January the local Justice and his retainers arrived at Thomas <unk> 's home , Hindlip Hall , to arrest the Jesuits . Despite Thomas <unk> 's protests , the men spent the next four days searching the house . On 24 January , starving , two priests left their hiding places and were discovered . Humphrey Littleton , who had escaped from the authorities at Hagley , got as far as Prestwood in Staffordshire before he was captured . He was imprisoned , and then condemned to death at Worcester . On 26 January , in exchange for his life , he told the authorities where they could find Father Garnet . Worn down by hiding for so long , Garnet , accompanied by another priest , emerged from his priest hole the next day . 
 = = = Trials = = = 
 By coincidence , on the same day that Garnet was found , the surviving conspirators were arraigned in Westminster Hall . Seven of the prisoners were taken from the Tower to the Star Chamber by barge . Bates , who was considered lower class , was brought from the Gatehouse Prison . Some of the prisoners were reportedly despondent , but others were nonchalant , even smoking tobacco . The King and his family , hidden from view , were among the many who watched the trial . The Lords Commissioners present were the Earls of Suffolk , Worcester , Northampton , Devonshire , and Salisbury . Sir John Popham was Lord Chief Justice , Sir Thomas Fleming was Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer , and two Justices , Sir Thomas Walmsley and Sir Peter Warburton , sat as Justices of the Common Pleas . The list of traitors ' names was read aloud , beginning with those of the priests : Garnet , Tesimond , and Gerard . 
 The first to speak was the Speaker of the House of Commons ( later Master of the Rolls ) , Sir Edward Philips , who described the intent behind the plot in lurid detail . He was followed by the Attorney @-@ General Sir Edward Coke , who began with a long speech — the content of which was heavily influenced by Salisbury — that included a denial that the King had ever made any promises to the Catholics . Monteagle 's part in the discovery of the plot was welcomed , and denunciations of the 1603 mission to Spain featured strongly . Fawkes 's protestations that Gerard knew nothing of the plot were omitted from Coke 's speech . The foreign powers , when mentioned , were accorded due respect , but the priests were accursed , their behaviour analysed and criticised wherever possible . There was little doubt , according to Coke , that the plot had been invented by the Jesuits . Garnet 's meeting with Catesby , at which the former was said to have absolved the latter of any blame in the plot , was proof enough that the Jesuits were central to the conspiracy ; according to Coke the Gunpowder Plot would always be known as the Jesuit Treason . Coke spoke with feeling of the probable fate of the Queen and the rest of the King 's family , and of the innocents who would have been caught up in the explosion . 
 Each of the condemned , said Coke , would be drawn backwards to his death , by a horse , his head near the ground . He was to be " put to death halfway between heaven and earth as unworthy of both " . His genitals would be cut off and burnt before his eyes , and his bowels and heart then removed . Then he would be decapitated , and the dismembered parts of his body displayed so that they might become " prey for the fowls of the air " . Confessions and declarations from the prisoners were then read aloud , and finally the prisoners were allowed to speak . Rookwood claimed that he had been drawn into the plot by Catesby , " whom he loved above any worldy man " . Thomas Wintour begged to be hanged for himself and his brother , so that his brother might be spared . Fawkes explained his not guilty plea as ignorance of certain aspects of the indictment . Keyes appeared to accept his fate , Bates and Robert Wintour begged for mercy , and Grant explained his involvement as " a conspiracy intended but never effected " . Only Digby , tried on a separate indictment , pleaded guilty , insisting that the King had reneged upon promises of toleration for Catholics , and that affection for Catesby and love of the Catholic cause mitigated his actions . He sought death by the axe and begged mercy from the King for his young family . His defence was in vain ; his arguments were rebuked by Coke and Northumberland , and along with his seven co @-@ conspirators , he was found guilty by the jury of high treason . Digby shouted " If I may but hear any of your lordships say , you forgive me , I shall go more cheerfully to the gallows . " The response was short : " God forgive you , and we do . " 
 Garnet may have been questioned on as many as 23 occasions . His response to the threat of the rack was " <unk> ista <unk> [ Threats are only for boys ] " , and he denied having encouraged Catholics to pray for the success of the " Catholic Cause " . His interrogators resorted to the forgery of correspondence between Garnet and other Catholics , but to no avail . His jailers then allowed him to talk with another priest in a neighbouring cell , with eavesdroppers listening to every word . Eventually Garnet let slip a crucial piece of information , that there was only one man who could testify that he had any knowledge of the plot . Under torture Garnet admitted that he had heard of the plot from fellow Jesuit Oswald Tesimond , who had learnt of it in confession from Catesby . Garnet was charged with high treason and tried in the Guildhall on 28 March , in a trial lasting from 8 am until 7 pm . According to Coke , Garnet instigated the plot : " [ Garnet ] hath many gifts and endowments of nature , by art learned , a good linguist and , by profession , a Jesuit and a Superior as indeed he is Superior to all his predecessors in devilish treason , a Doctor of <unk> , <unk> of Princes , Disposing of Kingdoms , <unk> and deterring of subjects , and Destruction . " Garnet refuted all the charges against him , and explained the Catholic position on such matters , but he was nevertheless found guilty and sentenced to death . 
 = = = Executions = = = 
 Although Catesby and Percy escaped the executioner , their bodies were exhumed and decapitated , and their heads exhibited on spikes outside the House of Lords . On a cold 30 January , Everard Digby , Robert Wintour , John Grant , and Thomas Bates , were tied to hurdles — wooden panels — and dragged through the crowded streets of London to St Paul 's Churchyard . Digby , the first to mount the scaffold , asked the spectators for forgiveness , and refused the attentions of a Protestant clergyman . He was stripped of his clothing , and wearing only a shirt , climbed the ladder to place his head through the noose . He was quickly cut down , and while still fully conscious was castrated , disembowelled , and then quartered , along with the three other prisoners . The following day , Thomas Wintour , Ambrose Rookwood , Robert Keyes , and Guy Fawkes were hanged , drawn and quartered , opposite the building they had planned to blow up , in the Old Palace Yard at Westminster . Keyes did not wait for the hangman 's command and jumped from the gallows , but he survived the drop and was led to the quartering block . Although weakened by his torture , Fawkes managed to jump from the gallows and break his neck , thus avoiding the agony of the gruesome latter part of his execution . 
 Steven Littleton was executed at Stafford . His cousin Humphrey , despite his cooperation with the authorities , met his end at Red Hill near Worcester . Henry Garnet 's execution took place on 3 May 1606 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Greater freedom for Roman Catholics to worship as they chose seemed unlikely in 1604 , but the discovery of such a wide @-@ ranging conspiracy , the capture of those involved , and the subsequent trials , led Parliament to consider introducing new anti @-@ Catholic legislation . In the summer of 1606 , laws against recusancy were strengthened ; the Popish Recusants Act returned England to the Elizabethan system of fines and restrictions , introduced a sacramental test , and an Oath of Allegiance , requiring Catholics to abjure as a " heresy " the doctrine that " princes excommunicated by the Pope could be deposed or assassinated " . Catholic Emancipation took another 200 years , but many important and loyal Catholics retained high office during King James I 's reign . Although there was no " golden time " of " toleration " of Catholics , which Father Garnet had hoped for , James 's reign was nevertheless a period of relative leniency for Catholics , and few were subject to prosecution . 
 The playwright William Shakespeare had already used the family history of Northumberland 's family in his Henry IV series of plays , and the events of the Gunpowder Plot seem to have featured alongside the earlier Gowrie conspiracy in Macbeth , written some time between 1603 and 1607 . Interest in the demonic was heightened by the Gunpowder Plot . The King had become engaged in the great debate about other @-@ worldly powers in writing his <unk> in 1597 , before he became King of England as well as Scotland . Inversions seen in such lines as " fair is foul and foul is fair " are used frequently , and another possible reference to the plot relates to the use of equivocation ; Garnett 's A Treatise of Equivocation was found on one of the plotters . Another writer influenced by the plot was John Milton , who in 1626 wrote what one commentator has called a " critically vexing poem " , In <unk> <unk> . Reflecting " partisan public sentiment on an English @-@ Protestant national holiday " , in the published editions of 1645 and 1673 the poem is preceded by five epigrams on the subject of the Gunpowder Plot , apparently written by Milton in preparation for the larger work . The plot may also have influenced his later work , Paradise Lost . 
 The Gunpowder Plot was commemorated for years by special sermons and other public acts , such as the ringing of church bells . It added to an increasingly full calendar of Protestant celebrations that contributed to the national and religious life of 17th @-@ century England , and has evolved into the Bonfire Night of today . In What If the Gunpowder Plot Had Succeeded ? historian Ronald Hutton considered the events which might have followed a successful implementation of the plot , and the destruction of the House of Lords and all those within it . He concluded that a severe backlash against suspected Catholics would have followed , and that without foreign assistance a successful rebellion would have been unlikely ; despite differing religious convictions , most Englishmen were loyal to the institution of the monarchy . England might have become a more " Puritan absolute monarchy " , as " existed in Sweden , Denmark , Saxony , and Prussia in the seventeenth century " , rather than following the path of parliamentary and civil reform that it did . 
 = = = Accusations of state conspiracy = = = 
 Many at the time felt that Salisbury had been involved in the plot to gain favour with the King and enact more stridently anti @-@ Catholic legislation . Such conspiracy theories alleged that Salisbury had either actually invented the plot or allowed it to continue when his agents had already infiltrated it , for the purposes of propaganda . The Popish Plot of 1678 sparked renewed interest in the Gunpowder Plot , resulting in a book by Thomas Barlow , Bishop of Lincoln , which refuted " a bold and groundless surmise that all this was a contrivance of Secretary Cecil " . 
 In 1897 Father John Gerard of Stonyhurst College , namesake of John Gerard ( who , following the plot 's discovery , had evaded capture ) , wrote an account called What was the Gunpowder Plot ? , alleging Salisbury 's culpability . This prompted a refutation later that year by Samuel Gardiner , who argued that Gerard had gone too far in trying to " wipe away the reproach " which the plot had exacted on generations of English Catholics . Gardiner portrayed Salisbury as guilty of nothing more than opportunism . Subsequent attempts to prove Salisbury 's involvement , such as Francis Edwards 's 1969 work Guy Fawkes : the real story of the gunpowder plot ? , have similarly foundered on the lack of any clear evidence . 
 The cellars under the Houses of Parliament continued to be leased out to private individuals until 1678 , when news of the Popish Plot broke . It was then considered prudent to search the cellars on the day before each State Opening of Parliament , a ritual that survives to this day . 
 = = = Bonfire Night = = = 
 In January 1606 , during the first sitting of Parliament since the plot , the Observance of 5th November Act 1605 was passed , making services and sermons commemorating the event an annual feature of English life ; the act remained in force until 1859 . The tradition of marking the day with the ringing of church bells and bonfires started soon after the Plot 's discovery , and fireworks were included in some of the earliest celebrations . In Britain , the 5th of November is variously called Bonfire Night , Fireworks Night , or Guy Fawkes Night . 
 It remains the custom in Britain , on or around 5 November , to let off fireworks . Traditionally , in the weeks running up to the 5th , children made " guys " — effigies supposedly of Fawkes — usually made from old clothes stuffed with newspaper , and fitted with a grotesque mask , to be burnt on the 5 November bonfire . These guys were exhibited in the street to collect money for fireworks , although this custom has become less common . The word guy thus came in the 19th century to mean an oddly dressed person , and hence in the 20th and 21st centuries to mean any male person . 
 November the 5th firework displays and bonfire parties are common throughout Britain , in major public displays and in private gardens . In some areas , particularly in Sussex , there are extensive processions , large bonfires and firework displays organised by local bonfire societies , the most elaborate of which take place in Lewes . 
 According to the biographer Esther Forbes , the Guy Fawkes Day celebration in the pre @-@ revolutionary American colonies was a very popular holiday . In Boston , the revelry took on anti @-@ authoritarian overtones , and often became so dangerous that many would not venture out of their homes . 
 = = = Reconstructing the explosion = = = 
 In the 2005 ITV programme The Gunpowder Plot : Exploding The Legend , a full @-@ size replica of the House of Lords was built and destroyed with barrels of gunpowder . The experiment was conducted on the <unk> <unk> test site , and demonstrated that the explosion , if the gunpowder was in good order , would have killed all those in the building . The power of the explosion was such that the 7 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) deep concrete walls ( replicating how archives suggest the walls of the old House of Lords were constructed ) were reduced to rubble . Measuring devices placed in the chamber to calculate the force of the blast were themselves destroyed by the explosion ; the skull of the dummy representing King James , which had been placed on a throne inside the chamber surrounded by courtiers , peers and bishops , was found a considerable distance from the site . According to the findings of the programme , no one within 330 feet ( 100 m ) of the blast could have survived , and all of the stained glass windows in Westminster Abbey would have been shattered , as would all of the windows in the vicinity of the Palace . The explosion would have been seen from miles away , and heard from further away still . Even if only half of the gunpowder had gone off , everyone in the House of Lords and its environs would have been killed instantly . 
 The programme also disproved claims that some deterioration in the quality of the gunpowder would have prevented the explosion . A portion of deliberately deteriorated gunpowder , of such low quality as to make it unusable in firearms , when placed in a heap and ignited , still managed to create a large explosion . The impact of even deteriorated gunpowder would have been magnified by its containment in wooden barrels , compensating for the quality of the contents . The compression would have created a cannon effect , with the powder first blowing up from the top of the barrel before , a millisecond later , blowing out . Calculations showed that Fawkes , who was skilled in the use of gunpowder , had deployed double the amount needed . 
 Some of the gunpowder guarded by Fawkes may have survived . In March 2002 workers cataloguing archives of diarist John Evelyn at the British Library found a box containing a number of gunpowder samples , including a compressed bar with a note in Evelyn 's handwriting stating that it had belonged to Guy Fawkes . A further note , written in the 19th century , confirmed this provenance , although in 1952 the document acquired a new comment : " but there was none left ! " 
 = Paul Stephenson ( civil rights campaigner ) = 
 Paul Stephenson OBE ( born 6 May 1937 in Rochford , Essex ) , is a community worker , activist and long @-@ time campaigner for civil rights for the British African @-@ Caribbean community in Bristol , England . 
 As a young social worker , in 1963 Stephenson led a boycott of the Bristol Omnibus Company , protesting against its refusal to employ Black or Asian drivers or conductors . After a 60 @-@ day boycott supported by thousands of Bristolians , the company revoked its colour bar in August . In 1964 Stephenson achieved national fame when he refused to leave a public house until he was served , resulting in a trial on a charge of failing to leave a licensed premises . His campaigns were instrumental in paving the way for the first Race Relations Act , in 1965 . Stephenson is a Freeman of the City of Bristol and was awarded an OBE in 2009 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Stephenson was born in 1937 to a West African father and a British mother . His maternal grandmother Edie Johnson was a well known actress in the 1920s . He received his secondary education at Forest Gate Secondary School in London , where he was the only black child in the school . Service in the Royal Air Force followed from 1953 to 1960 . Stephenson gained a Diploma in Youth and Community Work from University College Birmingham in 1962 and then moved to Bristol to work as a youth officer for Bristol City Council . 
 = = Bus boycott = = 
 In January 1955 the Passenger group , that is the section representing those working in Passenger Transport , of the local branch of the Transport and General Workers Union had passed a resolution that " coloured workers should not be employed as bus crews " by the Bristol Omnibus Company . The Bristol Evening Post ran a series of articles in 1961 exposing this colour bar . The union publicly denied the bar , but the company general manager , Ian Petey , did admit it . He attempted to justify the company policy by stating in a meeting with the city 's Joint Transport Committee that he " had ' factual evidence ' that the introduction of coloured crews in other cities downgraded the job , causing existing ( white ) staff to go elsewhere . " 
 Several members of the city 's West Indian community set up an organisation , the West Indian Development Council , to fight discrimination of this sort , aided by Paul Stephenson who was the city 's first black youth officer . In 1963 Stephenson established that the bus company was indeed operating a colour bar and inspired by the example of Rosa Parks ' refusal to move off a " whites only " bus seat in Montgomery , Alabama , leading to the Montgomery Bus Boycott , a Bristol bus boycott was organised . 
 As an articulate and university educated person , Stephenson became spokesman for the boycott , which soon attracted nationwide media interest and the campaign grew to receive support from Bristolians of all colours , Tony Benn , MP for Bristol East , and Harold Wilson , leader of the Labour opposition . After 60 days , on 28 August 1963 , the bus company capitulated and in September <unk> Singh became Bristol 's first non @-@ white bus conductor . 
 In August 2014 <unk> unveiled a plaque inside Bristol Bus Station commemorating the bus boycott . 
 = = Further career = = 
 In the following year Stephenson achieved national prominence when he refused to leave a public house without being served . He was charged with failing to leave a licensed premises and was tried in a magistrate 's court . The case was dismissed and the barman was dismissed by his employers . 
 Following this , Stephenson left Bristol to work in Coventry as a Senior Community Relations Officer . In 1972 he went to London to work for the Commission for Racial Equality . While in London he worked with boxer Muhammad Ali setting up the Muhammad Ali Sports Development Association in Brixton , and also set up the Cleo Laine Schools ’ Music Awards from 1977 to 1982 with Cleo Laine and John Dankworth . In 1975 he was appointed to the Sports Council and campaigned prominently against sporting contacts with apartheid South Africa . Stephenson became honorary president of Bristol 's West Indian Parents ' Association in 1979 and in 1981 was appointed to the Press Council . 
 On his return to live in Bristol in 1992 , he helped set up the Bristol Black Archives Partnership ( <unk> ) , which " protects and promotes the history of African @-@ Caribbean people in Bristol . " It was initiated when he placed his own personal archives with Bristol Record Office for safekeeping . 
 = = Awards and honours = = 
 In 1988 Stephenson received the Bristol City Council Community Award for Achievement and Services Rendered to the Black Community and the West Indian Community Publishers Award . Further awards include the Bristol West African and Caribbean Council Community <unk> ' Award ( 1996 ) , and the city council 's One Person Can Make a Difference Award ( 2006 ) . In 2007 Stephenson was granted the Freedom of the City of Bristol , being the first person of Black origin to be so honoured . The citation stated : " Paul Stephenson has devoted his life to improving race relations and encouraging community involvement and is a founder member of the Bristol Black Archives Project which has contributed greatly to an understanding of the history of the City and has helped to build closer relations between all the communities of Bristol . " 
 In 2009 he was given an OBE " for his services to equal opportunities and to community relations in Bristol " . He received honorary degrees from the University of the West of England ( Master of Education ) in November 2009 , " in recognition of his substantial contribution to pioneering work in race relations and the extension of opportunity to socially excluded young people " , and the University of Bristol ( Doctor of Law ) in July 2014 " for his dedication to fighting for equality and civil rights across Bristol and around the world for over 60 years " .

 The 2010 – 11 Harvard Crimson men 's basketball team represented Harvard University in the Ivy League athletic conference during the 2010 – 11 NCAA Division I men 's basketball season . The team played its home games in Cambridge , Massachusetts at the Lavietes Pavilion , which has a capacity of 2 @,@ 195 . The team was led by fourth @-@ year head coach Tommy Amaker . By earning a share of the 2010 – 11 Ivy League men 's basketball season title , the team became the first men 's basketball Ivy League champion in school history . This was the 100th season for Harvard basketball . 
 After the annual 14 @-@ game double round robin schedule , Harvard and Princeton tied as co @-@ champion , resulting in a one @-@ game playoff to determine the league 's automatic bid to the 2011 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament . After losing , the team earned an at @-@ large bid to the 2011 National Invitation Tournament , where they lost in the first round . It was the school 's first appearance in the National Invitation Tournament . 
 The <unk> team was captained by Keith Wright and Oliver McNally . Wright , a junior , was a unanimous All @-@ Ivy first team selection and named Ivy League Men 's Basketball Player of the Year . Sophomores Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry were named All @-@ Ivy second team and sophomore Christian Webster was an honorable mention .

 The team was coming off a 2009 – 10 season during which it set a school record for wins ( 21 ) , non @-@ conference wins ( 11 ) , home wins ( 11 ) , and road / neutral wins ( 10 ) . However , the team lost its star Jeremy Lin to the National Basketball Association . The team entered the season not having participated in the NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament since the 1946 Tournament . It also entered the season as the only member school not to have won at least one Ivy League men 's basketball championship since the league was formed during the 1956 – 57 season . Of the 34 men 's and women 's sports in which Harvard competes , this was the only sport that they had never won a championship . They had only finished in second three times in the past and only one of those was outright . 
 Most preseason publications predicted Princeton would finish in first place and Harvard would finish in second place , although the Sporting News projected that Cornell would finish in first followed by Princeton and Harvard . Breaking a three @-@ year streak by Cornell , the Ivy League media poll selected Princeton as the top team with twelve first place votes , Harvard second with four first place votes and Cornell third with one first place vote . It was the first Princeton team to be the preseason selection since the 2004 – 05 Princeton team . 
 = = Season = = 
 During the season , the team lost to its only ranked opponent , # 4 Connecticut ( December 22 ) , but defeated power conference opponents Boston College ( January 5 ) of the Atlantic Coast Conference and Colorado ( November 28 ) of the Big 12 Conference . The Colorado victory was the team 's first ever against a Big 12 opponent . In addition to defeating Boston College , the team defeated other cross @-@ town rivals Boston University ( December 11 ) and MIT ( December 31 ) . The team also lost to Amaker 's former team ( as a coach ) , Michigan ( December 4 ) . The Harvard gameplan involved fast breaks initiated by its defensive and an inside @-@ outside game . Although Harvard never appeared in the 2010 – 11 NCAA Division I men 's basketball rankings , for a few weeks ( January 24 , January 31 and February 21 and March 7 ) during the season they received a vote in the AP Poll . 
 As the season wound down , there was much ado in the press about a possible Harvard Ivy League championship . The most recent Harvard team to be in contention for a championship entering the final weekend was the 1984 team . On March 5 , Harvard clinched a share of the league championship for the first time since the Ivy League was formed . By defeating Princeton at home on March 5 and earning a split of the season series , they clinched at least a share of the 2010 – 11 Ivy League men 's basketball season Championship with a 12 – 2 conference record . Princeton fell to 11 – 2 with one conference game remaining to force a one @-@ game playoff for the conferences automatic bid to the 2011 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament . Harvard finished the season a perfect 14 – 0 at home , which surpassed the prior season 's record of eleven home wins . Harvard will enter the 2011 – 12 NCAA Division I men 's basketball season with a 17 @-@ game home streak ( 10th longest in the country ) . Harvard 's 12 conference game wins was also a school record . On March 7 , Harvard received a vote in both the AP Poll and the Coaches ' Poll . It was the first time in program history that they received votes in the Coaches ' Poll .

 On March 8 , Princeton defeated Penn to force a one @-@ game playoff at the Payne Whitney Gymnasium at Yale University in New Haven , Connecticut . Princeton won the playoff by a 63 – 62 margin . However , many thought Harvard had a chance to make the tournament in spite of the loss as an at @-@ large team . Four of Harvard 's regular season losses were to postseason contenders , and Cornell represented the conference well the year before . Entering selection Sunday ( March 13 ) , Harvard ranked 35th in the Ratings Percentage Index ( RPI ) . However , Harvard was not selected . Unfortunately , neither of Harvard 's quality wins ( against Colorado and Boston College ) helped them because both teams were left out of the NCAA tournament and relegated to number one seed status in the NIT tournament . It was the Ivy League 's first NIT invitation since the 2003 when Brown participated . As a regular season champion not invited to the NCAA tournament , they were an at @-@ large selection for the 2011 National Invitation Tournament , where they were seeded # 6 . On March 15 , Harvard was defeated by Oklahoma State by a 71 – 54 margin in the first round . The final record of 23 – 7 established a school record for number of wins , surpassing the prior season 's total of 21 . Harvard finished the season ranked 40th nationally by the Collegiate Basketball News RPI , <unk> RPI and NCAA RPI . The team finished second in the nation in free throw percentage ( 80 @.@ 8 % ) , led by Oliver McNally who was 2nd as an individual with a 92 @.@ 6 % and Christian Webster who was 12th with an 89 @.@ 4 % .

 = Slovenian presidential election , 2007 = 
 The 2007 Slovenian presidential election was held in order to elect the successor to the second President of Slovenia Janez Drnovšek for a five @-@ year term . France <unk> , the President of the National Assembly , called the election on 20 June 2007 . 
 Seven candidates competed in the election 's first round on 21 October 2007 ; three entered the race as independent candidates , the other four were supported by political parties . Several political events , as well as tension between the Government and the political opposition , overshadowed the campaign . The front runner Lojze Peterle , supported by the governing conservative coalition , won the first round with far fewer votes than predicted by opinion polls . In the second round , held on 11 November 2007 , Peterle faced the runner @-@ up , the left @-@ wing candidate Danilo Türk . Türk won the second round in a landslide , with 68 @.@ 03 % of the vote . 
 In a referendum called by the National Council , and held on the same day as the second round of the presidential election , the electorate voted to overturn a law providing for the nationalization of citizens ' share in the major national insurance company . Nearly three quarters of the votes were cast against the law . After both election and referendum results were announced , the Prime Minister Janez Janša announced that he might resign , following what he perceived to be a heavy defeat for the Government . The Government later won a vote of confidence in the National Assembly . 
 = = Background = = 
 The role of the president of Slovenia is mainly ceremonial . One of the president 's duties is to nominate the Prime Minister , after consulting with political groups represented in the National Assembly . The president also proposes candidates for various state offices , as well as judicial appointments to the Constitutional and Supreme Court , which must be approved by the National Assembly . In rare circumstances , the president possesses the power to pass laws and dissolve the National Assembly . The President is also the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces . Unlike the majority of the government , which is chosen by the National Assembly and elected through proportional representation , the president is directly elected by the majority of Slovenian voters . 
 The previous presidential election in 2002 brought major changes to Slovenian politics . The former president Milan Kučan , in office since the first free elections held in the Republic of Slovenia in April 1990 ( before the country 's independence from Yugoslavia ) , was forbidden by the constitution from running for President again , and announced his retirement from active politics . Prime Minister Janez Drnovšek of the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia stood for the office , comfortably winning the runoff against conservative candidate Barbara <unk> . 
 The 2004 legislative election brought further changes and a political swing to the right . Janez Janša , the leader of a right @-@ wing coalition , formed the new government . In Slovenia , this was the first time after 1992 that the President and the Prime Minister had represented opposing political factions for more than a few months . Between 2002 and 2004 , the relationship between President Drnovšek and Janez Janša , then leader of the opposition , were considered more than good and in the first year of cohabitation , no major problems arose . 
 In the beginning of his term , Drnovšek , who was ill with cancer , stayed out of public view . When he reemerged in late 2005 he had changed his lifestyle : he became a vegan , moved out of the capital into the countryside , and withdrew from party politics completely , ending his already frozen membership in the Liberal Democracy . Drnovšek 's new approach to politics prompted one political commentator to nickname him " Slovenia 's Gandhi " . 
 The relationship between Drnovšek and the government quickly became tense . Disagreements began with Drnovšek 's initiatives in foreign politics , aimed at solving major foreign conflicts , including those in Darfur and Kosovo . Initially , these initiatives were not openly opposed by the Prime Minister , but were criticized by the foreign minister <unk> Rupel , Drnovšek 's former collaborator and close political ally until 2004 . The disagreements moved to issues of domestic politics in October 2006 , when Drnovšek publicly criticised the treatment of the Romani family <unk> . The neighborhood had forced the <unk> to relocate , which in turn subjected them to police supervision and limitation of movement . The disagreements however escalated when the parliamentary majority repeatedly rejected President 's candidates for the Governor of the Bank of Slovenia , beginning with the rejection of incumbent <unk> Gaspari . The friction continued over the appointment of other state official nominees , including Constitutional Court judges . Although the President 's political support suffered after his personal transformation , the polls nevertheless showed public backing of the President against an increasingly unpopular Government . The tension reached its height in May 2007 , when the newly appointed director of the Slovenian Secret Service <unk> <unk> unclassified several documents from the period before 2004 , revealing , among other , that Drnovšek had used secret funds for personal purposes between 2002 and 2004 . The President reacted with a harsh criticism of the government 's policies , accusing the ruling coalition of abusing its power for personal <unk> and labeled the Prime Minister as " the leader of the negative guys " . After years of speculation about his health and intentions , Janez Drnovšek announced in February 2007 that he would not run for president again .

 = = = Requirements for candidacy = = = 
 Under Slovenian Election Law , candidates for president require support of either : 
 10 members of the National Assembly , 
 one or more political parties and either 3 members of the National Assembly or 3 @,@ 000 voters , 
 or 5 @,@ 000 voters . 
 Each political party can support only one candidate . In the election , the president is elected with a majority of the vote . If no candidate receives more than half of votes , the top two candidates meet in the second round of election . 
 = = = Leading candidates = = = 
 The first official candidate was Lojze Peterle , a conservative member of the European parliament and first democratically elected Prime Minister of Slovenia ( 1990 – 1992 ) , who announced his candidacy in November 2006 . He was endorsed by the three government center @-@ right parties , New Slovenia ( <unk> ) , Slovenian Democratic Party ( SDS ) , and Slovenian People 's Party ( SLS ) . 
 Drnovšek 's announcement that he would not run for president again led to expectations that the Social Democrats ( SD ) would nominate their leader Borut Pahor and indeed Pahor confirmed that he was ready to run for the office . The Social Democrats had become the most popular party in opinion polls and were considered the likely winners at the next general election in 2008 ; opinion polls indicated that Pahor would easily win the presidential election . However , after months of mixed signals , Pahor finally announced that he would instead concentrate on the general election and would not run for the mostly ceremonial office of the president . 
 The Social Democrats then nominated Danilo Türk , a former Slovenian ambassador and high official in the United Nations , who at the time was a professor at the University of Ljubljana 's Faculty of Law . Türk 's candidacy was also endorsed by <unk> and the pensioners ' party <unk> . Türk also gained support from Active Slovenia ( AS ) and the Party of Ecological Movements ( SEG ) , two parties not represented in the National Assembly . 
 Liberal Democracy of Slovenia ( LDS ) , which had earlier discussed the candidacy with Danilo Türk , subsequently nominated <unk> Gaspari , the former Governor of the Bank of Slovenia . Gaspari had earlier had discussions with the Social Democrats about the candidacy . 
 The Slovenian National Party ( SNS ) nominated its leader , <unk> Jelinčič . Jelinčič had already run for the office at the 2002 election , finishing third with 8 @.@ 51 % of the votes . 
 Peterle , Türk and Gaspari all decided to enter the election as independent candidates and all managed to collect enough nominating votes with Peterle reaching the required number within the first 4 hours of the nominating process . Jelinčič was supported by his fellow party members . Early polls indicated that Peterle , who had been campaigning for months and had cultivated the image of a " man of the people " , would win the election in a runoff against Türk or possibly Gaspari . 
 = = = Other candidates = = = 
 Other candidates , none of whom were expected to win a significant share of votes , were Darko <unk> of the formerly parliamentarian Youth Party of Slovenia , the disabled rights activist Elena <unk> , and Monika <unk> , supported by the Women 's Voice of Slovenia party . <unk> was supported by non @-@ aligned <unk> <unk> , independent Slavko Gaber and Roberto <unk> , representative of the Italian minority in Slovenia . <unk> and <unk> were supported by non @-@ parliamentary political parties so they only needed to collect 3 @,@ 000 support votes . 
 Several other candidates publicly announced their intention to run for the office . Jože <unk> , <unk> Horvat , Matej <unk> , Marjan <unk> , Marko <unk> and Pavel <unk> failed to gather sufficient public support or later decided to withdraw from the race . Artur <unk> , after leading a spoof campaign , announced that he was in fact performing a hidden camera experiment . The footage was used by <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in a film Gola <unk> , airing in early 2009 and addressing objectivity of media , problems with election legislation and reactions from Slovenes . 
 = = First round campaign = = 
 The official election campaign began in late September 2007 . The campaigns of the three front runners were based mostly on the personal appeal of the candidates , with few concrete statements about political issues . <unk> Jelinčič led an aggressive campaign , focusing on denouncing the three front runners , the Government , the ethnic and religious minorities , the Roman Catholic Church , and demanding an aggressive policy towards neighbouring Croatia . 
 The candidates appeared in televised debates during which they discussed various topics . One of them were the rules governing the voting of non @-@ resident nationals , which had been changed by the National Electoral Commission during the campaign . Before the campaign , non @-@ resident nationals who wanted to cast their votes as absentee ballots had been obliged to request voting materials , but the Commission had introduced a new system in which such materials were sent to all non @-@ residents entered in the electoral register , whether they had asked for them or not . Opposition parties , representing the left @-@ wing of Slovenian politics , disliked this move because the record of voters ' addresses was not always reliable , and also because the rules had been changed after the campaign had already started . They particularly opposed the change because voters from abroad seemed to favor right @-@ wing parties , so that in the event of a very close ballot , votes from non @-@ residents could tip the scale in favour of Peterle . 
 Other events overshadowed the campaign . During the summer , journalists Matej <unk> and Blaž <unk> launched a Petition Against Censorship and Political Pressures on Journalists in Slovenia , alleging government interference with journalism . The petition was signed by hundreds of Slovenian journalists from the mainstream media . It was sent to the heads of state , prime ministers and parliamentary speakers of all EU member states during the campaign . Following the petition , the International Press Institute ( IPI ) sent a fact @-@ finding mission to Ljubljana in November , to discuss the claims made in the petition with members of the Slovenian media . The contents of the mission 's report remain confidential , but IPI called for the establishment of an independent commission to investigate the claims further . 
 Another event which attracted much debate was the Supreme Court 's annulment of the 1946 war crimes conviction of <unk> Rožman . Rožman was the Catholic bishop of Ljubljana who had been found guilty of war crimes and treason during World War II as a result of his collaboration with Italian and German occupation forces . Several attempts during the 1990s to review the trial had failed . This had led to Janša 's government changing the law , enabling the religious communities to request a review of trials of their deceased members , something which had previously been reserved only for close relatives . After the Archdiocese of Ljubljana initiated the review , the Supreme Court annulled the 1946 trial on procedural grounds , effectively rehabilitating Rožman , a decision that caused much controversy . This proved harmful for Peterle 's campaign , as he was closely associated with the Catholic Church . When asked about the Rožman case in a TV debate , Peterle confined himself to remarking that he was a supporter of the rule of law , that the war had divided the nation and that Rožman had played some part in that . 
 The last opinion polls published before the first round predicted a runoff between Peterle , who would win 40 % , and either Türk or Gaspari . The latter were each predicted to receive 20 – 25 % ; most polls predicted a substantially larger share for Türk . 
 = = First round result and reactions = = 
 The first round , held on 21 October , brought unexpected results . Contrary to predictions , Peterle won less than 29 % of the vote , with Türk and Gaspari finishing a close second and third , respectively . Jelinčič , who according to opinion polls was expected to win around 12 % of the vote , actually won almost 20 % , finishing first in two of Slovenia 's eight electoral units . Prime Minister Janez Janša blamed Peterle 's poor showing on certain topics that were brought up during the campaign by " hidden centres of power " . This was a reference to the journalists ' petition , the timing of the Supreme Court 's decision on the Rožman case and misinterpretation of Janša 's and Minister of Economy Andrej <unk> 's remarks on reasons for Slovenia 's high inflation in 2007 . 
 = = Runoff campaign = = 
 Following the unexpected results of the first round , new opinion polls showed major changes , giving Türk a large lead over Peterle . Liberal Democracy of Slovenia , which supported Gaspari in the first round , announced it would support Türk in the second . 
 After the surprise gains of the flamboyant Jelinčič in the first round , the campaigns of both candidates opted for more concrete political statements in public campaigning and debates . Peterle replaced the head of his campaign , and concentrated on questioning Türk 's role in the 1991 secession from Yugoslavia . Peterle alleged that at the time when he , as Prime Minister , struggled for Slovenia 's independence , Türk continued to act as an official representative of Yugoslavia in international institutions . The campaign was backed by the Prime Minister Janša and the Foreign Minister <unk> Rupel who went so far as to confirm Peterle 's claims on the Foreign Ministry 's official website . Türk denied the allegations , pointing to his opinion piece in the International Herald Tribune advocating international recognition of Slovenia , and the fact that it was Rupel himself who in 1992 appointed Türk as the Ambassador to the UN and praised him for his service to the country . Peterle 's new strategy appeared to backfire , and the polls before the runoff predicted that Türk would win between 63 % and over 70 % of the vote . 
 = = Runoff result and reactions = = 
 The runoff was held on 11 November 2007 . Exit poll results published at the closing of the vote predicted a victory for Türk , with 69 % of the vote . " I 'm very happy with the results as they appear now . I want to be a president who is uniting people . I believe that conditions here are such that people have a strong desire for something new , " Türk told reporters . 
 Peterle conceded immediately . In his first statements , Peterle said his defeat was a vote against the ruling Janša government , and that he had expected a better result . He added , however , that he would have regretted it if he had not decided to run for the office . By midnight , unofficial results from the Electoral Commission gave Türk a lead of 68 % vs. 32 % . Türk won in all eight electoral units , with Peterle narrowly winning in only four of 88 electoral districts . Together with the second round of the election , a referendum on a law providing for the nationalization of citizens ' share in the major national insurance company was held as well . Nearly three quarters of the votes were cast against the law . 
 The ballots from abroad that were considered potentially contentious before the election proved to have very little effect on the result . While Peterle received more votes from abroad than Türk , both the total number of votes and the difference was smaller than expected ( <unk> for Peterle and <unk> for Türk ) . 
 Two days after the election , Prime Minister Janša announced that he might resign following what was perceived as a heavy defeat for the Government : " We will analyze the situation further , but all possibilities are open , including a resignation of the Government . " He said that " it is particularly worrying that a lot of energy was invested in blackening the Government abroad " , claiming his opponents portrayed Slovenia " as Belarus " or some other authoritarian country . The opposition parties said that talk of resignation just weeks before Slovenia took over European Union presidency was irresponsible and unwise , but the Prime Minister called a vote of confidence for 19 November 2007 . The Government won the confidence vote , but support for the ruling SDS subsequently reached an all @-@ time low , with only 18 % of voters intending to vote for it in the fall 2008 election . 
 Reactions to Türk 's victory from international media were positive . The Swiss newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung described him as " more or less the ideal man for the job " . The media focused on the landslide victory that was perceived to be a severe defeat for Janša ’ s centre @-@ right coalition . Since the EU presidency was closing , Türk 's diplomatic background was put forward . " Slovenia is your solid , faithful and credible partner . Rely on us , and we 'll be a good president of the European Union next year , " Türk said . Türk was also expected to maintain Slovenia 's alliance with the United States even though he was highly critical of the war in Iraq , as Al Jazeera reported . 
 On 22 December , Türk was sworn in as the President of the Republic of Slovenia . In his inaugural address , he thanked his predecessor Janez Drnovšek for his contribution to success and respect of Slovenia . Later , he also stated that he would work closely with Janša 's government during Slovenia 's six @-@ month EU presidency .

 = Demobilisation of the Australian military after World War II = 
 The demobilisation of the Australian military after World War II involved discharging almost 600 @,@ 000 men and women from the military , supporting their transition to civilian life and reducing the three armed services to peacetime strengths . Planning for the demobilisation process began in 1942 and thousands of servicemen and women were discharged in the last years of the war in response to shortages of labour in the domestic war economy . The general demobilisation of the military began in October 1945 and was completed in February 1947 . The demobilisation process was largely successful , though some military personnel stationed in the South West Pacific complained that their repatriation to Australia was too slow . 
 The disposal of surplus military equipment took place at the same time as the size of the services was being reduced . The disposal process was managed to limit its economic impact . Most equipment was transferred to other government agencies , sold or destroyed by the end of 1949 . 
 = = Planning = = 
 Planning for the demobilisation of the Australian military began at the end of 1942 when the Department of Post @-@ War Reconstruction was formed . The department was involved with drawing up plans for determining veterans ' entitlements and the assistance which would be provided to discharged personnel to help them settle into civilian life . This included planning the delivery of training , housing and ensuring that jobs were available . An important consideration was to ensure that civilian employment opportunities were created at an appropriate rate as the size of the military was reduced . In order to achieve this , it was decided to continue many wartime economic regulations such as price controls in order to limit inflation and direct resources to where the Australian Government believed they were most needed . 
 The Australian War Cabinet approved the Department of Post @-@ War Reconstruction 's proposed principles to govern demobilisation on 12 June 1944 . The key element of these principles was that the order in which personnel would be demobilised was to be based on a points system , with service men and women being allocated points on the basis of their period of service , age , marital status and employment or training prospects . An extensive demobilisation plan was then developed by an inter @-@ service committee following further consultation with trade unions , employers and returned servicemen . This plan was accepted as the basis for planning by the War Cabinet on 6 March 1945 . The rate at which personnel were to be discharged was set at 3 @,@ 000 a day for six days a week and was to be capable of being increased in the event of an emergency . 
 The final demobilisation plan assigned differing scales of points for service men and women . Service men were allocated two points for each year of age based on their age at enlistment and a further two points for each month of service if they did not have dependent children or three points if they did . Service women received three points for each year of age at enlistment and a point for each month of service . Women with children were given priority for demobilisation , followed by those who had married before the end of the war . Service women who married after the war could ask for an early discharge on compassionate grounds . Men were also eligible for early discharge on compassionate or health grounds , if they had skills which were important to the Australian economy or had been accepted into a full @-@ time training course . 
 Limited demobilisation began during the final years of the war . In order to meet the needs of the war economy 20 @,@ 000 soldiers were released from the Australian Army in October 1943 . Further reductions took place in August 1944 when another 30 @,@ 000 soldiers and 15 @,@ 000 personnel from the Royal Australian Air Force were discharged . In mid @-@ 1945 the Government implemented a policy in which service men and women who had completed five years of service , including at least two years outside Australia , could volunteer for discharge . 
 = = Post @-@ war demobilisation = = 
 The demobilisation plan was put into action on 16 August 1945 , the day after Japan surrendered . At this time the military had a strength of 598 @,@ 300 men and women . Of these , 310 @,@ 600 were in Australia , 224 @,@ 000 were serving in the South West Pacific Area ( SWPA ) and 20 @,@ 100 were in Britain and other parts of the world . The only personnel to be discharged during August and September were former prisoners of war and those with a long period of service , however , as general demobilisation did not begin until 1 October 1945 . During the intervening months dispersal centres were established in each state and territory 's capital city . These centres were to provide information on employment , land settlement , housing , training , loans , tools for trades and other benefits for service personnel as their discharges were processed . Lieutenant @-@ General Stanley Savige was appointed the Coordinator of Demobilisation and Dispersal in September . 
 Former prisoners of war were given a high priority for repatriation back to Australia and discharge . Planning for the recovery of prisoners of the Japanese , most of whom had been held in harsh conditions , had begun in 1944 and the 2nd and 3rd Australian Prisoner of War Reception Groups were established at Singapore and Manila respectively in August 1945 . By the end of September most of the prisoners recovered from Singapore , Java and Sumatra had been returned to Australia along with about half of those recovered from the Bangkok area . Transport shortages delayed the repatriation of Australian prisoners from Formosa , Japan and Korea , but almost all were on their way home by mid @-@ September . 
 In line with a plan approved by the Australian Government in September 1945 , general demobilisation was conducted in four stages . The first stage ran from October 1945 to January 1946 and involved the discharge of 249 @,@ 159 personnel , which was higher than the targets of 10 @,@ 000 members of the Royal Australian Navy , 135 @,@ 000 soldiers and 55 @,@ 000 airmen specified in the demobilisation plan . In the second stage 193 @,@ 461 personnel left the military between February and 30 June 1946 , though this was slightly lower than the target of 200 @,@ 000 . The third stage ran from 1 July to 31 December by which time the services were reduced to 78 @,@ 000 personnel , which was considered the strength necessary for the military 's post @-@ war tasks . Of the remaining servicemen , those who did not wish to volunteer for continuing service in the military were released in the fourth stage which began on 1 January 1947 . At the end of this process the military 's strength had fallen 60 @,@ 000 personnel . Where possible , service men and women were placed on leave and allowed to return home while awaiting discharge . 
 The demobilisation of the military included disbanding the female branches of the three services . The Women 's Royal Australian Naval Service , Australian Women 's Army Service and Women 's Auxiliary Australian Air Force had been formed during 1941 and 1942 to enable women to serve in the military but were disbanded during 1947 , with military service being again restricted to men . Demobilised service women were provided with similar assistance to male members of the military , but were placed under pressure to return to traditional family roles . 
 The return of Australian personnel from the SWPA was delayed by shipping shortages and the need to maintain a force in the area for garrison duties . The military provided these personnel with training courses to prepare them for civilian life . <unk> courses in basic subjects such as maths and English were run first before vocational training began . The teachers and instructors for these courses were service personnel selected on the basis of their civilian occupations . In addition , sport competitions were conducted to keep the men busy . 
 Many men in the SWPA believed that the demobilisation process was too slow . On 10 December 1945 4 @,@ 500 men at Morotai in the Netherlands East Indies staged a protest march demanding that shipping be made available to return them to Australia . Soldiers at Bougainville also complained about having to remain on the island after the war had ended , and Prime Minister Ben Chifley 's plane was sabotaged in an apparent protest during his visit on 27 December 1945 . Minister for Defence Frank Forde was largely blamed for the slowness with which military personnel were being demobilised . As a result , he lost his seat at the 1946 election , though the Labor Party itself comfortably retained office . 
 Despite the dissatisfaction of the men in the SWPA , the demobilisation and repatriation process generally proceeded smoothly . Most men had been returned to Australia by January 1946 and 80 percent were demobilised by the middle of the year . Before leaving the military service men and women attended either a dispersal centre or naval depot where they were provided with a medical examination , interviewed by a rehabilitation officer and provided with information about the benefits they were eligible for . The Manpower Directorate was then responsible for placing discharged personnel in employment as well as providing them with identity documentation and ration entitlements . Training courses were made available to veterans , and by 1951 94 @,@ 000 had completed university , technical or rural training courses and 39 @,@ 000 were still in training . A further 135 @,@ 000 began training but withdrew before completing their course . 
 Demobilisation also included establishing arrangements for the medical care of ex @-@ service personnel . After the war responsibility for medical treatment was gradually transferred from the services to the Repatriation Commission . The Army 's hospitals were also transferred to the Commission , meeting its immediate need for facilities . It proved necessary to build new hospitals for the treatment of tuberculosis and mental disorders , however as the specialised Army hospitals established for the treatment of these conditions were respectively unsatisfactory and had to be returned to the Government of New South Wales . The Department of Social Services was responsible for providing assistance to veterans with a disability not caused by their military service , and this led to the foundation of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service in 1955 . 
 = = Disposal of military equipment = = 
 The disposal of military equipment and materials was also a key priority after the end of the war . Equipment with civilian uses such as motor vehicles , clothing and housing were urgently needed to counter shortages in the civilian economy . The timing of equipment release had to be carefully planned , however , to avoid harming employment by creating surpluses of manufactured goods . Planning for the disposal of equipment began in 1943 and the Commonwealth Disposals Commission was established to oversee the sale or destruction of equipment on September 1944 . Before the commission was established the Government decided that ex @-@ military equipment would be offered to other government agencies before being made available to the public , that sales to the public were to be made on a ' as is , where is ' basis and be processed through existing trade channels or public auction at ' fair market prices ' and that payment was to be required in cash . Some special priorities were also established ; farmers were to be given priority for motor vehicles , machine tools were to be allocated to ex @-@ servicemen and training colleges and special consideration was to be given to the needs of the Red Cross and other overseas and domestic charitable associations . 
 Preparations for the disposal of equipment began in the second half of 1944 when the War Cabinet directed the military to survey all stocks and indicate any surpluses . General Thomas Blamey , the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Army , hindered these preparations as he believed they were premature and that the Army 's stocks needed to be maintained until Japan was defeated . This position was opposed by the acting Minister for the Army , and the RAAF and RAN made some attempts to identify their surpluses , but was successful in delaying the Disposal Commission 's work until July 1945 . As a result , relatively little military equipment was sold between September 1944 and June 1945 . 
 After the war ended the Disposals Commission rapidly disposed of large stocks of military equipment . Consumer goods and raw materials which could be used immediately by manufacturers were the first items to be sold and sales of motor vehicles grew rapidly . Ex @-@ military vehicles made an important contribution to meeting transport shortages in rural areas , though there was some dissatisfaction with the priority given to the agricultural sector and the way in which the vehicles were sold . The Disposal Commission 's sales were also important in meeting shortages of clothing , housing , industrial and construction equipment and tractors . Most of the military 's stocks of food were donated to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration or sold for export . 
 The disposal of military equipment , particularly outside of Australia , presented a challenge to the Disposals Commission . At the end of the war inadequate preparations were made for the storage of equipment in New Guinea , and many stores were stolen by soldiers , native New Guineans and ' salvage pirates ' or damaged by the tropical conditions . Sales of stocks in these areas were completed at the end of 1946 , often at very low prices , but much equipment was stolen . Specialised military equipment also proved difficult to dispose of given its unsuitability for civilian purposes . Bombs and other explosives were destroyed after any scrap metal was recovered and large numbers of combat aircraft had to be scrapped due to a worldwide glut . Training aircraft and other aeronautical equipment were sold to the public and other government agencies , however , and demand for tanks and Universal Carriers which could be converted to tractors was greater than expected . 
 The Disposals Commission 's activities peaked during 1946 and 1947 . Sales generally went smoothly and in accordance with the principles set by the Government and did not significantly disrupt normal commerce . While the Commission generally operated efficiently , some mistakes occurred such as clothing and scrap metal being sold well beneath their market value . The volume of sales dropped rapidly after 1947 and the Disposals Commission was disbanded in July 1949 . By this time the commission had sold £ 135 @,@ 189 @,@ 000 worth of equipment .

 Cold Feet is a British comedy @-@ drama television series produced by Granada Television for the ITV network . The series was created and principally written by Mike Bullen as a follow @-@ up to his award @-@ winning 1997 Comedy Premiere of the same name . The storyline follows three couples experiencing the ups @-@ and @-@ downs of romance . Adam Williams and Rachel Bradley ( James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale ) are a new couple who go through dating , marriage and the birth of a child . Pete and Jenny Gifford ( John Thomson and Fay Ripley ) are a married couple with a newborn son ; they experience parenthood , adultery , separation and eventually divorce when Jenny leaves for a job in New York . Pete starts a new relationship with Jo Ellison ( Kimberley Joseph ) . Karen and David Marsden ( Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst ) live an upper @-@ middle @-@ class lifestyle , employing a nanny for their son and holding dinner parties with friends . Their marriage disintegrates after each has an affair . 
 The original series was executive @-@ produced by Bullen with Granada 's head of comedy Andy Harries , and produced by Christine Langan , Spencer Campbell and Emma Benson . 32 episodes were broadcast over the original five series from 15 November 1998 to 16 March 2003 . A reboot of the original series with some of the original cast is planned for 2016 . The series is set in Greater Manchester and was primarily filmed there for all five years . Filming occasionally went overseas to locations such as Belfast , Paris and Sydney . To distinguish the look of the series from regular sitcoms , all episodes were shot on film stock and were overseen by directors with little television experience , creating a visual style more akin to advertisements ; Jon Jones was nominated for a British Academy Television Craft Award for his work on the third series . 
 The show was a critical and ratings success for ITV , which has struggled to recapture Cold Feet 's kind of audience since the series ended . Critics analysed the depiction of social issues , the use of popular music , and the relevance of the series to contemporary audiences when compared to the big @-@ budget BBC costume dramas Vanity Fair ( 1998 ) and The Way We Live Now ( 2001 ) . Mike Bullen 's style of writing has served as inspiration to British screenwriters Danny Brocklehurst and Sanjeev Kohli . The series was a regular nominee at the British Comedy Awards — at which it won four out of five " Best TV Comedy Drama " nominations — the National Television Awards , and television societies worldwide . It has been broadcast in over 34 countries and has been remade for local audiences in the United States and European countries . The series also spawned merchandise , including soundtracks , DVDs and spin @-@ off books . 
 = = Background = = 
 Series creator Mike Bullen 's working relationship with Granada Television began in 1994 when his agent sold his first screenplay , a one @-@ off comedy @-@ drama called The Perfect Match , to the company 's head of comedy Andy Harries . Harries had been looking for television scripts that would reflect the lives of people from his generation — people in their 30s who were under @-@ represented on television . The Perfect Match , about a man who proposes to his girlfriend at the FA Cup Final and has to deal with constant media attention afterwards , was made and then broadcast in 1995 . Harries asked Bullen to pitch more ideas for television to The Perfect Match 's assistant producer Christine Langan . As a fan of American television such as Thirtysomething , Frasier and Hill Street Blues , Bullen pitched Cold Feet , a traditional " boy @-@ meets @-@ girl , boy @-@ loses @-@ girl , boy @-@ wins @-@ girl @-@ back " story told from both sides of the relationship but using elements of fantasy and flashback to distort events to fit a character 's point of view . The initial pitch centred on Adam Williams and Rachel Bradley ( James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale ) , which Harries believed would diminish the storytelling potential if the ITV Network Centre commissioned a full series after the pilot , so Bullen " tacked on " plots for two other couples — Adam and Rachel 's respective friends Pete and Jenny Gifford ( John Thomson and Fay Ripley ) and David and Karen Marsden ( Robert Bathurst and Hermione Norris ) . 
 The pilot was directed by Father Ted 's Declan Lowney over 12 days in 1996 on location around Greater Manchester . The programme was one of four one @-@ off Comedy Premieres made by Granada for ITV . Cold Feet was eventually broadcast on 30 March 1997 . It received only 3 @.@ 5 million viewers and little critical attention . As ITV 's comedy portfolio was so thin , Cold Feet was submitted as the network 's comedy entry at the Montreux Television Festival in May 1997 . There it won the Silver Rose for Humour and the Rose d 'Or , the highest accolade of the festival . ITV scheduled a repeat broadcast a few days afterwards but did not commission a series . Not until David Liddiment 's appointment as director of programming at ITV in August 1997 was a six episode series ordered .

 It was announced in November 2015 that a sixth series of Cold Feet was in pre @-@ production and would be shown during 2016 . The character Rachel will not be returning . Helen Baxendale " I was really touched he ’ d ( writer : Mike Bullen ) written Rachel into it , but I felt it wasn ’ t right for me , Rachel or the new series . 
 = = Cast and characters = = 
 Cold Feet began its first series with the six main cast members — James Nesbitt , Helen Baxendale , John Thomson , Fay Ripley , Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst — who had appeared in the pilot . Thomson 's character Pete Gifford was written specifically for him after his performance in The Perfect Match made a positive impression on Christine Langan . Norris originally auditioned for the part of Rachel but was cast as Karen because the role suited her social class . Nesbitt got an audition through a mutual friend of pilot director Declan Lowney , and read the part in his natural accent because he was keen to play a Northern Irish character in a contemporary drama unconnected to The Troubles . Baxendale was best known for her role in Cardiac Arrest and was hesitant to star as Rachel because she did not believe she could perform comedy . Bathurst was known to Langan for his starring role in Joking Apart . Ripley thought she would be auditioning for the part of Rachel , and had to put on an accent for her role as natural Mancunian Jenny . When the fourth series was commissioned , Ripley announced that she was leaving the show to broaden her career options . Kimberley Joseph was cast as Jo Ellison , a replacement character who remained on screen until Cold Feet 's conclusion . Bullen makes numerous Hitchcock @-@ esque cameo appearances ; he plays a neighbour and a husband in the first series and a workman in the third . 
 Despite all receiving equal billing in the credits , the original principal cast members were paid different salaries in the first few years ; Baxendale and Nesbitt were the most well @-@ known , so received more than Ripley , Thomson , Norris and Bathurst , who were comparatively less well @-@ known to audiences . Prompted by the continued success of the show , Andy Harries reviewed the salaries in 2000 and decided to pay all six actors the same amount . The amount was not publicly disclosed but was believed to be £ 20 @,@ 000 per episode , plus repeat broadcast royalties . Another pay deal for the fourth series in 2001 increased the salaries of the cast to £ 50 @,@ 000 . For the final series in 2003 , they each received £ 75 @,@ 000 an episode . 
 = = = Main characters = = = 
 The six core characters were devised to be " regular people , not distinguished by their careers or by crime " and were based on people from Mike Bullen 's life . 
 Adam Williams is a serial womaniser who lives a carefree lifestyle until he settles down with Rachel — though he is still tempted by the next @-@ door neighbour and women in fast cars . Bullen based Adam 's womanising personality on how he saw himself during his twenties . He is diagnosed and treated for testicular cancer during the second series , a storyline developed by Bullen to directly contrast Adam 's Lothario characterisation . Adam marries Rachel in Series 3 and their son , Matthew , is born in Series 4 . In Series 5 , Adam 's estranged father Bill Williams arrives in Manchester . Adam moves to patch up the relationship after Bill comes out as a bisexual . After Rachel 's death , Adam and Matthew leave their old house to see Bill . Adam 's backstory was inconsistent ; the first series established that Adam and Pete had known each other since their childhood when they attended the same school in Manchester . To justify Adam 's accent , his Northern Irish origins were developed in Series 3 and it was explained on screen that he spent his school holidays there . His background is reinforced when his father is introduced in Series 5 . Bullen admitted that Adam 's biography was never fully planned but conceded that Cold Feet was " full of gaffes " . 
 Rachel Bradley is an advertising executive . After being with Adam for nine months , she admits to him that she is married but promises to ask her estranged husband for a divorce . Unknown to Adam , while her husband is in Manchester , she has sex with him and later finds out she is pregnant . Unable to cope with not knowing who the father is , she terminates the pregnancy . The abortion causes her to become infertile . She marries Adam at the end of Series 3 and has a surprise conception in Series 4 , which leads to the birth of her child . She is killed in a car crash in Series 5 . Helen Baxendale became pregnant during Series 4 , which meant the plot of Rachel being infertile had to be abandoned and the rest of the series re @-@ written . Baxendale found the character limiting and hard to play when she was just " the woman that Adam saw through rose @-@ tinted glasses " . She found that , as the series progressed , Bullen learned how to write for the character , giving her a clearer idea of how to play her . She found the death of Rachel " unfair " and believed the character was being punished for terminating her pregnancy . 
 Pete Gifford is Jenny 's husband and has been Adam 's best friend since childhood . Bullen based Pete on his own childhood friend , with whom he went through university . Pete is often deliberately insensitive towards Adam , which Thomson attributes to Pete thinking Adam is jealous of his achievements . In Series 2 , Pete has an affair with co @-@ worker Amy . It upsets his marriage to Jenny and by Series 3 they are separated . At the beginning of Series 4 , they are back together and expecting a second child . After Jenny miscarries , she leaves Pete and takes little Adam with her . Pete has a rebound relationship with Jo , and marries her at the end of Series 4 . They break up at the end of Series 5 . 
 Jenny Gifford is Pete 's wife . She spends much of the first series raising their baby . In Series 2 , she develops a brief crush on Adam . She throws Pete out of the house when she finds out about his affair with Amy but they try to repair the marriage after Adam 's cancer treatment . When she and Pete separate in Series 3 , she asserts her independence in a series of short @-@ lived secretarial jobs , and by dating millionaire Robert Brown . She and Pete briefly consider a divorce but get back together after Robert dumps her . In Series 4 , the couple are expecting a second child . Jenny miscarries and re @-@ evaluates her life in Manchester . She is offered a job in New York by the head of the company she works for and decides to divorce Pete and leave for America with their son . She returns for Rachel 's funeral in Series 5 and moves back in with Pete . Ripley said of her character , " Jenny 's very ballsy and speaks her mind , but she 's more sensitive than people give her credit for . She 's seen as very hard but I don 't think she is — it 's just that she won 't show her vulnerability to everyone . " 
 David Marsden is a management consultant and the husband of Karen . The Marsdens were the least @-@ developed characters when the pilot was produced ; Robert Bathurst noted that David was " set up as a post @-@ Thatcherite boo @-@ boy to represent all that is evil about materialism " . He was concerned that the only character note in the script related to David 's high salary and that , to make more than a brief cameo appearance in the series , the character needed to be significantly developed . David is made redundant in Series 2 and Karen arranges for him to take a new , better @-@ paid job . In Episode 3 , the couple celebrate their wedding anniversary in Paris . The episode originally had a downbeat ending scripted but was changed on the advice of Andy Harries and the editor of the episode . David and Karen both then have affairs ; David with local residents ' campaigner Jessica in Series 3 , and Karen with publisher Mark in Series 4 . The affairs lead to the end of their marriage , which was discussed to great lengths by the production staff . David starts a relationship with his solicitor , Robyn Duff , in Series 5 and divorces Karen . 
 Karen Marsden is a publishing editor and the wife of David . Of Karen , Norris said " [ S ] he 's the strength behind the marriage . David thinks he wears the trousers and she is prepared to think that to an extent . So she manages to massage his ego and then does her own thing anyway . " Karen becomes an alcoholic in Series 4 and seeks therapy to control her urges . After trying to put David 's affair with Jessica behind them , Karen starts an affair with publisher Mark . She breaks up with him via email while in Australia but he flies down and reveals their relationship to David . She briefly gets back together with Mark during her divorce from David in Series 5 but ends the relationship again when he wants nothing to do with her children . After Rachel 's death , Karen sees a grief counsellor . Norris and Bullen changed Karen 's personality significantly between the pilot and the series ; Norris altered the character 's accent to be less " posh " and Bullen wrote her to be more sympathetic . Bullen found it difficult to write situations for Karen that took place outside the character 's house . Eventually , he wrote a storyline for her in Series 2 where she rebels against her upper @-@ middle @-@ class lifestyle by smoking cannabis at a dinner party . Norris was disappointed that the plot of Karen and David 's divorce could not be developed further in Series 5 , as the majority of screen time was given to Adam and Rachel . 
 Jo Ellison is introduced as a co @-@ worker at Rachel 's advertising agency in Series 4 . After Jenny leaves England and Jo is evicted from her flat , she moves into Pete 's spare room . The two fall in love and marry in Australia in Episode 8 . In Series 5 , Pete suspects that Jo may have married him as a visa scam to stay in Britain . Their relationship is damaged and Jo sleeps with a colleague on a work weekend away . Pete asks her for a divorce when he finds out . Jo was devised when Bullen and Harries wanted Pete to fall in love with an Australian woman so they could film the Series 4 finale in Sydney . Kimberley Joseph was based in Los Angeles and had been out of work for 18 months before getting an audition with Spencer Campbell . Two weeks later she had moved to Manchester and was doing read @-@ throughs with the rest of the cast . Joseph thought Bullen had envisioned the character as a coarse " big fat truck @-@ driving lesbian type " before he met her . Thomson thought Pete 's lust for Jo was a rebound from Jenny and that , while Jo genuinely liked Pete , she did not actually love him , which Pete suspects when he reads Jo 's emails in Series 5 , Episode 2 . 
 = = = Supporting characters = = = 
 Significant supporting roles in the series are played by Jacey Salles ( Ramona Ramirez , Series 1 – 5 ) , Rosie Cavaliero ( Amy , Series 2 ) , Ben Miles ( Robert Brown , Series 3 ) , Yasmin Bannerman ( Jessica Barnes , Series 3 ) , Sean Pertwee ( Mark Cubitt , Series 4 – 5 ) , Richard Armitage ( Lee , Series 5 ) and Lucy Robinson ( Robyn Duff , Series 5 ) . 
 Salles is introduced as Ramona Ramirez in Series 1 , Episode 1 . Jacey Salles expected to play the Marsdens ' Spanish nanny for just two episodes , believing that the characters would regularly replace their son 's carer . She subsequently appeared in 27 episodes . Salles , half @-@ Spanish herself , auditioned for the role after appearing in the Granada film The Misadventures of Margaret — executive @-@ produced by Andy Harries . The character was developed to be the complete opposite of the typically English Karen and David . David finds her continental personality annoying but Karen enjoys it . Ramona 's role in Series 2 developed beyond just child @-@ caring — in Episode 2 , she bribes David for £ 30 to cook dinner for his former boss . By Series 3 , she has a major storyline where she dates Pete . In Series 4 , she gets caught up in Karen and David 's deteriorating marriage and briefly quits to work for their neighbours , and to work part @-@ time at a strip club . In Series 5 , she dates Lee , a fitness instructor who is the catalyst of Pete and Jo 's break @-@ up when he sleeps with Jo . 
 Doreen Keogh is introduced in Series 1 , Episode 4 as Pete 's mother Audrey Gifford . She makes a cameo appearance in Series 3 , Episode 1 , and reappears in Series 4 , Episode 4 and Series 5 , Episode 1 . The character 's recurrence was based on the good chemistry between Keogh and Thomson . 
 Yasmin Bannerman played local residents ' campaigner Jessica in Series 3 . Bannerman and Bathurst did not know that Jessica and David would have a full @-@ blown affair after their kiss in Episode 3 , as David was seen as too much of a " jittery type " . The character appears in five episodes . Bathurst was more impressed with the storylines that came out of the affair , rather than the affair itself : " It was the deception , the guilt and the recrimination rather than the actual affair , which was neither interesting nor remarkable " . 
 = = Production = = 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Mike Bullen has sole writing credit on 26 episodes of the series ; four episodes of Series 3 were written by David Nicholls , and Bullen co @-@ wrote one episode of Series 4 and 5 with Mark Chappell and Matt Greenhalgh respectively . Bullen usually wrote ten pages of script per day , whatever the quality of his writing . His own third draft was usually submitted to the producers as the " first " draft . As he was still an inexperienced writer by the time production of the first series began in January 1998 , Bullen was aided by Christine Langan , who pitched in as a script editor . Storylines were planned in advance — the producers knew that they wanted to split up Adam and Rachel at the end of Series 1 — but the later scripts were written once filming on earlier episodes had already begun . The number of people on the development team varied ; the third series ' comprised Bullen , Langan , Harries , producer Spencer Campbell , script editor Camilla Campbell , ITV 's controller of comedy , and a team of five writers . 
 Many storylines were based on life experiences of the production team ; Bullen and his wife Lisa had their first child in late 1997 , which made Bullen identify with the Pete character , whose son is born in the first episode . Bullen incorporated his experiences of the first few months of parenthood into the Pete and Jenny storyline . Adam 's testicular cancer storyline in Series 2 , Episode 5 was influenced by a similar condition that afflicted Harries , and was supplemented by the newspaper columns written by terminal cancer sufferer John Diamond . If a storyline was not drawn from real life experiences , it was researched by communicating with experts ; Bullen consulted the relationship support charity <unk> for the scenes of Karen and David 's marriage guidance session in Series 1 , Episode 5 , and consulted Dr Sammy Lee for information about Rachel 's intracytoplasmic sperm injection in Series 3 . When it was decided to have Rachel 's abortion lead to her developing Asherman 's syndrome in Series 3 , the British Pregnancy Advisory Service ( BPAS ) were contacted . BPAS strongly recommended that the plot be developed in a different direction , on the basis that infertility from what would appear to have been a routine abortion would be an " improbable link " , though the producers proceeded with their original story anyway . 
 By the time pre @-@ production on the third series began , Bullen had grown tired of writing the series single @-@ handedly and believed all the stories that could be told had been told . ITV were keen to increase the number of episodes per series to 20 but Granada refused , though did agree to add two more , bringing the total to eight . A writing team of five was assembled , overseen by Bullen . Four of the scriptwriters were deemed not good enough and they parted company with Granada . David Nicholls remained and scripted four of the eight @-@ third series episodes ; Bullen wrote the other four and his interest in the series was revived . 
 At the conclusion of the third series , Bullen announced that he did not want to write a fifth series , and that the fourth would be the last . Series 4 , Episode 8 was produced as the final episode but the cast and crew realised that they would like to make one final series for proper closure . Bullen agreed to write the final episodes on the condition that there would be just four , and that he could kill off a character . Matt Greenhalgh co @-@ wrote Series 5 , Episode 3 with Bullen , specifically the scenes depicting Rachel 's death . Greenhalgh worked on the script at the same time as he was writing his BBC Three series Burn It , also set in Manchester . In a 2007 interview , he said that he was not a fan of Cold Feet — decrying the depiction of Manchester in the series — and that killing off Rachel was " a privilege " . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 All episodes of Cold Feet were shot on film stock on locations in and around Greater Manchester . Sets were designed by Chris Truelove to reflect the characters ; Karen and David 's home was designed as a spacious detached house intended to be located in Bowdon , while Pete and Jenny and Adam and Rachel had smaller middle @-@ class abodes intended to be located in Didsbury . All exteriors of the characters ' houses were shot on location . Christine Langan was keen to avoid a generic sitcom style of filming , citing the formulae of such programmes as " tired and dreary " and lacking emotional depth . To achieve this goal , she and Harries recruited directors with little background in television . These included Nigel Cole , who came from an advertising background and was keen to use the two episodes of the first series he was allotted to " make his mark " and establish himself as a good television director . Other directors included Mark Mylod , Tom Hooper , Tom Vaughan , Pete Travis , Jon Jones , Ciaran Donnelly and Tim Sullivan . 
 For the first series , interior sets were built at the Blue Shed Studios in Salford . Three directors and three film crews were used to film the six 50 @-@ minute episodes over 14 weeks from March to May 1998 . Locations included an empty shop unit near Piccadilly station for the charity shop sex scene in Episode 3 and a Masonic Lodge for the gala dinner scenes in Episode 6 . In the second year , the sets were moved to the Spectrum Arena in Warrington , where filming ran from March to June . The series featured the first location shoots outside Manchester ; a short scene in Episode 2 featuring Bathurst was filmed over half a day in Blackpool ; Bathurst , Norris and a small production crew filmed scenes in Paris for Episode 3 ; exterior location scenes of the characters on holiday in Episode 6 were filmed on Lindisfarne , though the castle interiors were shot at Hoghton Tower . The second series also featured more visual effects ; in Episode 5 Adam dreams about being chased by a giant testicle ( which was computer @-@ generated ) and in Episode 6 a fireworks explosion was supervised by pyrotechnics experts . The testicle dream scene drew mixed reaction . The Mirror 's television critic Charlie Catchpole praised it but Robert Bathurst was critical : " I hated that sequence . I thought it was really unfunny . It was a lousy prop and awful graphics and there was too much of it — it would have been much better if it was like a Monty Python foot come smacking down like that and get it over with . You couldn 't keep up that surprise and hilarity for all the minutes it was on the screen . " By the third series , Cold Feet 's sets were permanently located on a Granada warehouse stage and were left intact between series . This meant the basic sets could be used on other Granada programmes , such as The <unk> and My Beautiful Son . After the final episode was filmed in 2002 , the sets were dismantled and taken to a landfill . 
 In Series 3 , Cold Feet shot outside England for the first time for Episode 5 . A storyline featuring Adam 's stag weekend was originally scripted to take place first in Blackpool and then in Dublin . James Nesbitt suggested that it should be filmed in Belfast and Portrush , near where he grew up . He , Andy Harries and producer Spencer Campbell scouted the locations in April 2000 before filming went ahead later that year . Local businesspeople were so eager to promote the area that they waived any fees Granada would have given them for allowing filming , meaning the location manager only spent £ 20 , considerably less than the £ 3 @,@ 000 a typical shoot of that length would have cost . This location shoot inspired the producers to film even further away from Manchester ; in November 2000 , Bullen and Harries spoke at the Screen Producers Association of Australia conference , where they decided to base the fourth series finale in Sydney . The episode was written to be a " normal episode " of Cold Feet that just had a different background . The main cast — except for Helen Baxendale who was pregnant — the producers and Ciaran Donnelly shot for 18 days in October 2001 in locations that included Hyde Park , Kirribilli , Double Bay and the northern beaches . Budget problems meant an overseas location could not be secured for Series 5 , so scenes in the final episode were shot in Portmeirion , Wales . 
 Screen time was divided up equally between the couples over the course of an episode , though occasionally some scenes would run longer ; in Series 4 , Episode 3 , the scenes of Karen clubbing went on for ten uninterrupted minutes . These scenes were also a rarity for location filming ; usually filming in public places was done on a Sunday during closing hours but the clubbing scenes in this episode were filmed during opening hours at the Music Box in Manchester . A hand @-@ held camera was used to enhance the frenetic pace . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Incidental music for the series was composed by Mark Russell . He also composed a theme tune , which was used as an alternative to Space 's " Female of the Species " . Christine Langan heard " Female of the Species " on The Chart Show while the pilot was being produced and decided to make it the theme song . She remained involved in choosing popular music used on the show for the three series she worked on it . " Female of the Species " was used as a closing theme throughout the first series . For the second series , it was replaced by Morcheeba 's " Let Me See " , except for the last episode when John Lennon 's " Love " was used . The Mirror 's Charlie Catchpole described the <unk> popular music in the school reunion scenes of Series 2 , Episode 4 — " Don 't You Want Me " ( The Human League ) , " Relax " ( Frankie Goes to Hollywood ) , " Temptation " ( Heaven 17 ) , " True " ( Spandau Ballet ) , " Do You Really Want to Hurt Me " ( Culture Club ) and " Tainted Love " ( Soft Cell ) — as " [ catching ] the changing mood with devastating precision " . Catchpole 's positive comments about the music led to a previously shelved soundtrack album being released . 
 = = Broadcast = = 
 The ITV Network Centre originally scheduled the first series to be broadcast in the 10 pm timeslot on Sunday nights . This went against the wishes of Andy Harries , who wanted it broadcast at 9 pm in the so @-@ called " ironing slot " — generally used for programmes that an audience does not have to concentrate on . David Liddiment compromised by allowing the show to start at 9 @.@ 30 pm Harries was able to get the second series moved to 9 pm , which annoyed advertisers . The third series remained in the same timeslot but , like other series on the network , suffered from ITV 's late decision to add a third advert break to hour @-@ long shows . Episode 8 , featuring Adam and Rachel 's wedding , was broadcast on Boxing Day — the first time the show was aired on a Tuesday . The eighth episode of Series 4 and all four episodes of Series 5 were extended to fill a 90 @-@ minute timeslot . 
 The series was repeated when ITV launched digital channel ITV3 , then marketed towards over @-@ 35 viewers . In the United States , Cold Feet was first broadcast on the cable network Bravo . Bravo bought the pilot and first three series for $ 1 million . The pilot was broadcast as a " sneak peek " before the regular series run began . From 2005 the series was broadcast by BBC America . When broadcast on SABC 3 in South Africa , the series is retitled Life , Love and Everything Else . Worldwide , it has been broadcast in over 34 countries .

 = = = Critical reaction = = = 
 Critical response to the first episode was not favourable ; in The Independent , Nicholas Barber called it the most depressing TV programme he had ever seen . He wrote of the six main characters , " Are we supposed to care about these people ? The theory , I think , is that we should relate to them , because their lives are as prosaic as our own , and because Cold Feet is a portrait of urban life as it really is in the Nineties . This is another way of saying the writer hasn 't bothered with research or imagination . " He criticised the conclusion of Episode 1 but praised the other five , which he had seen on preview tapes . On The Late Review , Germaine Greer and Tony Parsons singled out Nesbitt 's acting ; Greer called him " especially awful " and Parsons wished that he had plunged to his death from the scissor lift Adam appears on at the beginning of the episode . General reaction improved as the first year went on . At the conclusion of the first series , Andrew Billen compared it with Vanity Fair in the Evening Standard and was pleased that it offered a televisual outlet for the " forgotten " <unk> . Paul Hoggart for The Times wrote positively of the writing , directing , acting , and editing and looked forward to how Rachel 's pregnancy plot would be resolved in the second series . 
 Other critics hailed it as " the British answer to Thirtysomething " ; in 1998 , Meg Carter wrote in The Independent , " More than 10 years on , Granada Television has finally produced a modern show that mines the rich seam of a generation that is as confused as it is liberated by increased choice and freedom , and that caters for an audience which has not , traditionally , watched very much ITV . " Mark Lawson compared it to the American sitcom Friends , a series that is also based around three men and three women , and featured Helen Baxendale in a guest role . In a 2003 interview with Bullen on BBC Radio 4 's Front Row , Lawson asked whether Friends had influenced Cold Feet . Bullen explained that the connection was made by media as " a useful shorthand " , that he was irritated by the characters in Friends and " would liked to have taken a baseball bat to them " . 
 In 2001 , Andrew Billen compared the contemporary cultural relevance of the series to The Way We Live Now , as a follow @-@ up to his comparison of the first series with Vanity Fair : " In previous years we have seen the anguish caused by infidelity , impotence and infertility . This season the characters face the hazards thrown up by miscarriage , alcoholism and a late @-@ flowering career . Sustaining relationships looks as hard as ever . Yet there is nothing each protagonist wants more than old @-@ fashioned domestic bliss . " The review resonated with other critics ; in The Scotsman , Linda Watson @-@ Brown wrote an overall positive review of the series in general — dismissing the spate of " anti @-@ Cold Feet " reviews — but criticised " the ease with which problems are resolved and morality used to slap the viewer in the face " . The final episode set in Australia polarised critics ; in a column focusing on <unk> ' the Fat , Scotsman critic Aidan Smith accused the big @-@ budget episode " which somehow managed to squeeze the Harbour Bridge into every shot " of being the point the series jumped the shark , and Times columnist Caitlin Moran complimented it , but was concerned that the series ' original main characters — Adam and Rachel — were being sidelined by everyone including Mike Bullen . 
 When the fifth series began in 2003 , critics welcomed its end . Paul Hoggart wrote in The Times that the flashback and fantasy scenes were becoming so overused on television that their use in Cold Feet was less surprising than it was in 1998 . In Scotland on Sunday , Helen Stewart lamented the loss of Fay Ripley and Jenny 's replacement by " the bland but international crossover @-@ friendly Jo , [ ... ] who is sufficiently pointless to be dismissed even by her fellow characters as ' not as good as Jenny ' . " Stewart also criticised Hermione Norris 's acting and Karen for being a " spoon @-@ faced <unk> " . A brief article on the MediaGuardian website described a " revisionist backlash " as critics ' negative opinions of the series clashed with the positive reaction that greeted it in 1998 . 
 = = = Depiction of social issues = = = 
 Cold Feet 's cast and crew were frequently praised for their depiction of real @-@ life social issues on the series . When Cold Feet began , Christine Langan stated , " The real challenge was to overcome the traditional view that many of the issues we cover — jealousy , guilt , money , sexual problems , parental death — are ordinary issues , hardy perennials and , as such , not interesting enough for drama . " The fourth episode of the first series was controversial due to its depiction of the characters freely discussing their sex lives ; in the left @-@ wing New Statesman , Andrew Billen praised it as a homage to La Ronde and , despite the sex @-@ talk , being " intricately constructed as a farce " . The right @-@ wing tabloid Daily Mail 's critic wrote that the episode " veered a little too close last night towards the category of ' adult entertainment ' , with all its connotations of sleaze and smut " and " we found ourselves immersed in their sex lives on a level of embarrassing intimacy which most people would share only with their doctor " . A complaint was made by a viewer to the Independent Television Commission — the commercial television regulator — about the depiction of sex , but it was not upheld . 
 A scene in Series 2 , Episode 4 showing Karen smoking a joint at a dinner party was controversial with censors at the writing stage ; all scripts were required to be sent to Granada 's Compliance department to ensure they maintained the ITC 's code of conduct . The department would not allow Karen 's drug use to be portrayed without some cost to her , so suggested that Karen and Adam could be arrested while rolling joints at the school reunion . Bullen thought the idea was " ludicrous " so added a scene where David berates Ramona for her drug use . Despite the measures taken , four people complained to the ITC about the <unk> of drugs . The ITC dismissed the complaints . The scenes of Jo and Audrey smoking cannabis in Series 5 , Episode 1 drew seven complaints to the ITC by people who thought it would give children the wrong impression of drugs . The ITC dismissed the complaints on the basis that the episode was broadcast after the watershed . Mark Lawson was unappreciative of the scene , writing that the drugs plot was a " forced jollity " compared to the other humorous scenes in the episode . 
 In Series 3 , Adam and Rachel seek intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( <unk> ) when they have trouble conceiving a child naturally . The characters take out bank loans of thousands of pounds to pay for the treatment , which is unsuccessful each time . The producers devised this storyline because IVF was a major contemporary issue and wrote the treatment as a failure because it was representative of the odds of conception in real life . 
 Rachel 's problem with conception is soon diagnosed as being due to " partial Asherman 's syndrome " , a storyline that runs through Series 3 and 4 . The plot was analysed on an episode of BBC Radio 4 's Woman 's Hour . Ann Furedi of BPAS , which had supplied information to the writing team during the research stages , stated that there had not been a recorded case of Asherman 's syndrome in the United Kingdom since the second world war . Further to that , she stated that the consensus among medical groups was that there was no real direct link between abortions and infertility ; rather an untreated infection could increase the chances of fertility problems if it interfered with an abortion . Christine Geraghty countered that the factual accuracy of the storyline depended on how the producers wanted to portray the issue to viewers . Her opinion was backed up by an ITV statement , which said that " stories for Cold Feet are not just chosen in order to make people aware of the issues involved ; they 're also chosen for their dramatic potential and relevance to modern living " . Woman 's Hour presenter Jenni Murray developed the discussion in an article for The Guardian ; she mentioned that no impression was given that Rachel had suffered an incorrectly performed operation or had had to travel to eastern Europe for it , and that it was improbable that Rachel managed to conceive a child after all . 
 = = = Influence on television = = = 
 In a 2007 feature for The Guardian 's G2 supplement , screenwriter Danny Brocklehurst discussed the impact the series has had on British television , including inspiration for one of his programmes , Talk to Me . He opined that until Cold Feet there had not been a significant television series depicting " the wants and needs of ordinary young adults " since Thirtysomething concluded in 1991 . Brocklehurst developed Talk to Me in the same manner as Bullen developed Cold Feet , namely by basing its characters on his own experiences and friends . Both Brocklehurst and Mark Lawson have discussed similar " copycat " series , including Hearts and Bones , Metropolis , Couples and Wonderful You . Brocklehurst noted that these series " lacked [ Cold Feet 's ] warmth and believability " adding that they were " unrealistic and cynical " . 
 " Cold Feet proved that you didn 't have to have a high concept to make compelling , heartwarming , sometimes profound drama . And , while the show dealt with issues such adoption , alcoholism and testicular cancer , it was always at its most successful when bouncing playfully between the three couples , neatly exposing the differences between men and women . "
