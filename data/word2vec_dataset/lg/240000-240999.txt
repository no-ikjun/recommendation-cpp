 Spanish teacher Will Schuester ( Matthew Morrison ) learns that Sandy Ryerson ( Stephen Tobolowsky ) , the head of William McKinley High School 's glee club has been fired for inappropriate sexual behavior toward student Hank Saunders ( Ben Bledsoe ) . The school principal , Figgins ( Iqbal Theba ) , gives Will permission to take over the club , and he plans to revitalize it , naming the group New Directions . The club consists of fame @-@ hungry Rachel Berry ( Lea Michele ) , diva Mercedes Jones ( Amber Riley ) , flamboyant countertenor Kurt Hummel ( Chris Colfer ) , paraplegic electric guitar player Artie Abrams ( Kevin McHale ) and stuttering goth Tina Cohen @-@ Chang ( Jenna Ushkowitz ) . Will 's efforts are derided by Sue Sylvester ( Jane Lynch ) , head of the school 's successful cheerleading team , the Cheerios who soon plans to abolish the Glee club to restore her money funded towards the spoilt Cheerios . His wife Terri ( Jessalyn Gilsig ) is also unsupportive , suggesting that Will become an accountant to increase their income and give up teaching . Rachel threatens to leave the club if Will cannot find a male vocalist with talent comparable to hers . When the school 's football coach Ken Tanaka ( Patrick Gallagher ) allows Will to try to recruit football team members , in return that he put a good word for Emma for him ( because Ken likes her ) , he discovers that quarterback Finn Hudson ( Cory Monteith ) is secretly a talented singer . He plants marijuana in Finn 's locker , and blackmails him into joining New Directions . Finn , determined not to disappoint his widowed mother , complies . 
 Will takes New Directions to see Vocal Adrenaline , a rival club , perform . He is accompanied by Emma Pillsbury ( Jayma Mays ) , the school 's <unk> guidance counselor , who has a crush on him . Vocal Adrenaline perform an impressive rendition of Amy Winehouse 's " Rehab " , which leaves New Directions worried about their chances of competing in the regional show choir competition . When Will returns from the performance , Terri informs him she is pregnant . Believing he needs to support his family , Will regretfully tells the club he is resigning , and applies for a job as an accountant . Finn is attacked by the football team for his involvement with New Directions , and initially decides to quit the club . The team traps Artie in a portable toilet which they intend to tip over , however , Finn refuses to take part . He apologizes to the Glee club members , and the group resolves to continue without Will .

 Ryan Murphy , Brad Falchuk , and Ian Brennan created Glee . Murphy drew inspiration from his own childhood , which saw him play the lead role in all of his high school 's musicals . Brennan and producer Mike Novick were also highly involved in their own schools ' glee clubs . Brennan originally wrote a script for a Glee movie , but Murphy believed the concept would work better as a TV series . Fox picked up the series pilot within 15 hours of receiving the script , which Murphy attributes in part to the success of the network 's American Idol , commenting : " It made sense for the network with the biggest hit in TV , which is a musical , to do something in that vein " . Murphy intended the show to be a form of escapism , explaining : " There 's so much on the air right now about people with guns , or sci @-@ fi , or lawyers running around . This is a different genre , there 's nothing like it on the air at the networks and cable . Everything 's so dark in the world right now , that 's why ' Idol ' worked . It 's pure escapism . " With regards to Glee 's audience , Murphy intended for it to be a family show which would appeal to adults as well as children , with adult characters starring equally alongside the teenage leads . Glee is set in Lima , Ohio . Murphy chose a Midwest setting as he himself originates from Indiana , and recalls childhood visits to Ohio to the Kings Island theme park . Although set in Lima , the show is actually filmed at Paramount Studios in Hollywood . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The episode features covers of numerous songs sung on @-@ screen by the characters . Musical segments take the form of performances , as opposed to the characters singing spontaneously , as the intention is for the series to remain reality @-@ based . Murphy has commented that his interest lay in creating a " postmodern musical " , rather than " doing a show where people burst into song " , drawing on the format of Chicago . Murphy is responsible for selecting all of the songs used , and strives to maintain a balance between show tunes and chart hits , as : " I want there to be something for everybody in every episode . That 's a tricky mix , but that 's very important – the balancing of that . " 
 Songs featured in the pilot are " Where is Love ? " from Oliver ! , Aretha Franklin 's " Respect " , " Mister Cellophane " from Chicago , Katy Perry 's " I Kissed a Girl " , " On My Own " from Les Misérables , " Sit Down , You 're Rockin ' the Boat " from Guys and Dolls , " You 're the One That I Want " from Grease , REO Speedwagon 's " Can 't Fight This Feeling " , Amy Winehouse 's " Rehab " and " Don 't Stop Believin ' " and " Lovin ' , Touchin ' , Squeezin ' " by Journey . The director 's cut version also includes an acoustic rendition of John Denver 's " Leaving on a Jet Plane " . Murphy was surprised at the ease with which use of songs was approved by the record labels approached , and explained : " I think the key to it is they loved the tone of it . They loved that this show was about optimism and young kids , for the most part , reinterpreting their classics for a new audience . " The score of the episode features a cappella covers of instrumental songs provided by The Swingle Singers . Dance routines were choreographed by Zach Woodlee . 
 Four of the songs featured in the episode were released as singles , available for digital download . " On My Own " charted at number 42 in Ireland and 73 in the UK , and " Can 't Fight This Feeling " charted at number 117 in the UK . " Rehab " charted at number 93 in Australia , 38 in Ireland , 62 in the UK and 98 in America . " Don 't Stop Believin ' " reached number 2 in the UK , 4 in America , 50 in Canada , 5 in Australia , 4 in Ireland and 16 in New Zealand . It sold 177 @,@ 000 copies in the US in its first week , and went on to sell the most copies of any Glee single : it was certified gold with 500 @,@ 000 sales in the US in October 2009 , and reached one million in sales and platinum certification in March 2011 ; it has also been certified platinum in Australia . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 In casting Glee , Murphy sought out actors who could identify with the rush of starring in theatrical roles . Instead of using traditional network casting calls , he spent three months on Broadway , where he found Morrison , who had previously starred on stage in Hairspray and The Light in the Piazza , Michele , who starred in Spring Awakening , and Ushkowitz , from the Broadway revival of The King and I. The role of Rachel was written specifically for Michele . Colfer had no previous professional experience , but reminded Ryan of the character of Kurt from The Sound of Music , and was thus cast as Kurt Hummel . He originally auditioned for Artie with the song " Mr. Cellophane " , however Murphy was so impressed by his performance that the role of Kurt was created for him . Colfer commented on his casting : " I 'm so happy to be a part of something that is so new and different and so needed at this time . It 's good to have something positive , especially for kids in small towns , like myself , who need a little pick @-@ me @-@ up . It 's true : You can be famous – even if there 's no money left in the world . " 
 Auditioning actors with no theatrical experience were required to prove they could sing and dance as well as act . Mays auditioned with the song " Touch @-@ a , Touch @-@ a , Touch @-@ a , Touch Me " from The Rocky Horror Show , while Monteith initially submitted a tape of himself acting only , and was requested to submit a second , musical tape , in which he sang " a cheesy , ' 80s music @-@ video @-@ style version " of REO Speedwagon 's " Can 't Fight This Feeling " . " Monteith has deemed his casting " spot on " as : " I 'm just like my character . I 've never trained or had any lessons . I can just do it – with some adjustments , obviously . " McHale came from a boy @-@ band background , having previously been part of the group Not Like Them . He auditioned with the song " Let It Be " and tested alongside Colfer and Ushkowitz . He explained that the diversity of the cast 's backgrounds reflects the range of different musical styles within the show itself : " It 's a mix of everything : classic rock , current stuff , R & B. Even the musical theater stuff is switched up . You won 't always recognize it . " Lynch was originally intended to be a guest star , but became a series regular when a Damon Wayans pilot she was working on for ABC fell through .

 Entertainment Weekly 's Ken Tucker gave the episode an A , posing the question : " Has there ever been a TV show more aptly named than Glee ? It both embodies and inspires exactly that quality . " Glee was the top ranked topic on social networking site Twitter on the night of its initial airing . Alessandra Stanley for the New York Times called the show " blissfully unoriginal in a witty , imaginative way " , saying the characters are " high school archetypes " but noted " a strong satiric pulse that doesn ’ t diminish the characters ’ identities or dim the showmanship of a talented cast " . The Daily News ' David Hinckley wrote that the show " isn 't close to perfect " but " has likable characters , a good sense of humor and a reasonably deft touch with music . " He called the pilot episode " not very plausible " but " potentially heartwarming " , writing of the musical choices : " The duet of " You 're the One That I Want " from Grease may be a little obvious , but setting a group dance routine to Amy Winehouse 's " Rehab " shows some inspiration . Whether Glee can hold that note remains a very unanswered question . But it will at least be worth watching to see . " USA Today 's Robert Bianco assessed : " There 's a lot to like here : the exuberance of the musical numbers , the bite to the comedy and the joy of seeing something different . It has casting and tone problems , but it has all summer to fix them . " 
 The Baltimore Sun 's David Zurawik was critical of the show 's characterization and comedy , but was impressed by the staging of " Don 't Stop Believin ' " , calling it " so elevating and inspirational that it almost redeems all the stereotypes and lame humor that come before . Grit my teeth as I did at how one @-@ dimensionally empty @-@ headed the writing could be , I will still be back for the start of this series in the fall because of its musical punch . " Tom Jicha for The Sun Sentinel similarly claimed of the episode that : " A lively score and appealing performers somewhat compensate for overly familiar characters and plotting " , while Rob Owen for the Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette agreed : " It 's the music that makes Glee a gleeful delight . Without the song @-@ and @-@ dance production numbers , this Fox pilot would be just another high @-@ school @-@ set comedy @-@ drama . " 
 The Chicago Tribune 's Maureen Ryan commented that : " the two biggest musical numbers are tremendously entertaining . They 're shot and performed with verve , and they put to shame those medleys contestants often perform on the Wednesday edition of American Idol " , but again observed : " Whether it will work as a satirical dramedy about the cutthroat social environment of high school is another matter . " Of the principal cast , Ryan said : " Casting Matthew Morrison as Will Schuester [ ... ] was a wise move ; the actor not only has a sweet voice but a hangdog hopefulness that gives a needed anchor to the show 's more satirical elements . Cory Monteith gives quarterback Finn Hudson a jock @-@ ish authority mixed with an appealingly square naivete , and Lea Michele not only has an amazing voice but manages to make her character , spoiled diva Rachel Berry , more than a humorless stereotype . " She was critical , however , of Gilsig as Terri , calling her " the worst thing about Glee " and opining : " As written by Murphy and played by Gilsig , the character is screechy , unfunny and deeply unpleasant . It 's as if Ryan didn 't trust that the audience would get behind Will and the saga of his ragtag glee club and so saw fit to give the teacher the shrewish , nagging wife from hell . " 
 In contrast , Tom Shales for The Washington Post criticized Morrison as Will , writing : " Morrison is definitely not gleeful and doesn 't seem particularly well equipped to be a high @-@ school impresario ; as pipers go , he 's not even marginally pied . " Shales was more positive regarding Lynch 's performance , and concluded that : " Dramatic tension isn 't exactly plentiful , but pleasingly staged songs and a general aura of retro ingenuousness come through , and seem awfully if fitfully refreshing " . Variety 's Brian Lowry also highlighted acting and characterization issues with the show , writing that : " It 's among the adults , alas – who are mostly over @-@ the @-@ top buffoons – where Glee nearly sails off the rails , from Jane Lynch 's tyrannical cheer matron to the salivating football coach , a bit like the Rydell High gang in Grease . " Lowry felt that : " Modest redemption comes from the stammering Emma ( Heroes ' Jayma Mays ) , who has a clear crush on Will , even though he 's married to his high @-@ school sweetheart . Perhaps to foster a rooting interest ( or at least sympathy ) for a Will @-@ Emma pairing , said wife ( Jessalyn Gilsig ) is initially presented as a ditsy shrew . " Mary McNamara for the Los Angeles Times has called Glee : " the first show in a long time that 's just plain full @-@ throttle , no @-@ guilty @-@ pleasure @-@ rationalizations @-@ necessary fun . " She praised Lynch as Sue , writing that " Lynch alone makes Glee worth watching " , and claimed that overall : " The music , though by no means edgy , is energetic with a wide audience appeal , like the show itself . 
 = I Ching = 
 The I Ching ( [ <unk> <unk> ] or Classic of Changes , is an ancient divination text and the oldest of the Chinese classics . Possessing a history of more than two and a half millennia of commentary and interpretation , the I Ching is an influential text read throughout the world , providing inspiration to the worlds of religion , psychoanalysis , business , literature , and art . Originally a divination manual in the Western Zhou period ( 1000 – 750 BC ) , over the course of the Warring States period and early imperial period ( 500 – 200 BC ) it was transformed into a cosmological text with a series of philosophical commentaries known as the " Ten Wings . " After becoming part of the Five Classics in the 2nd century BC , the I Ching was the subject of scholarly commentary and the basis for divination practice for centuries across the Far East , and eventually took on an influential role in Western understanding of Eastern thought . 
 The I Ching uses a type of divination called cleromancy , which produces apparently random numbers . Four numbers , 6 to 9 , are turned into a hexagram , which can then be looked up in the I Ching book , arranged in an order known as the King Wen sequence . The interpretation of the readings found in the I Ching is a matter of centuries of debate , and many commentators have used the book symbolically , often to provide guidance for moral decision making as informed by Taoism and Confucianism . The hexagrams themselves have often acquired cosmological significance and paralleled with many other traditional names for the processes of change such as yin and yang and Wu Xing . 
 = = The divination text : Zhou yi = = 
 The core of the I Ching is a Western Zhou divination text called the Changes of Zhou ( <unk> Zhōu yì ) . Various modern scholars suggest dates ranging between the 10th and 4th centuries BC for the assembly of the text in approximately its current form . Based on a comparison of the language of the Zhou yi with dated bronze inscriptions , Edward Shaughnessy dated its compilation in its current form to the early decades of the reign of King Xuan of Zhou , in the last quarter of the 9th century BC . A copy of the text in the Shanghai Museum corpus of bamboo and wooden slips ( recovered in 1994 ) shows that the Zhou yi was used throughout all levels of Chinese society in its current form by 300 BC , but still contained small variations as late as the Warring States period . It is possible that other divination systems existed at this time ; the Rites of Zhou name two other such systems , the <unk> and the <unk> . 
 = = = Name and origins = = = 
 The name Zhou yi literally means the " changes " ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : Yì ) of the Zhou dynasty . The " changes " involved have been interpreted as the transformations of hexagrams , of their lines , or of the numbers obtained from the divination . Feng <unk> proposed that the word for " changes " originally meant " easy " , as in a form of divination easier than the oracle bones , but there is little evidence for this . There is also an ancient folk etymology that sees the character for " changes " as containing the sun and moon , the cycle of the day . Modern Sinologists believe the character to be derived either from an image of the sun emerging from clouds , or from the content of a vessel being changed into another . 
 Traditionally , the Zhou yi is associated with the legendary world ruler Fu Xi . According to the canonical Great Commentary , Fu Xi observed the patterns of the world and created the eight trigrams ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) , " in order to become thoroughly conversant with the numinous and bright and to classify the myriad things . " The Zhou yi itself does not contain this legend and indeed says nothing about its own origins . The Rites of Zhou , however , also claims that the hexagrams of the Zhou yi were derived from an initial set of eight trigrams . During the Han dynasty there were various opinions about the historical relationship between the trigrams and the hexagrams . Eventually , a consensus formed around 2nd century AD scholar Ma Rong 's attribution of the text to the joint work of Fu Xi , King Wen of Zhou , the Duke of Zhou , and Confucius , but this traditional attribution is no longer generally accepted . 
 = = = Structure = = = 
 The basic unit of the Zhou yi is the hexagram ( <unk> <unk> ) , a figure composed of six stacked horizontal lines ( <unk> <unk> ) . Each line is either broken or unbroken . The received text of the Zhou yi contains all 64 possible hexagrams , along with the hexagram 's name ( <unk> <unk> ) , a short hexagram statement ( <unk> <unk> ) , and six line statements ( <unk> <unk> ) . The statements were used to determine the results of divination , but the reasons for having two different methods of reading the hexagram are not known , and it is not known why hexagram statements would be read over line statements or vice versa . 
 The book opens with the first hexagram statement , yuán <unk> <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) . These four words , translated traditionally by James Legge as " originating and penetrating , advantageous and firm , " are often repeated in the hexagram statements and were already considered an important part of I Ching interpretation in the 6th century BC . Edward Shaughnessy describes this statement as affirming an " initial receipt " of an offering , " beneficial " for further " divining " . The word <unk> ( <unk> , ancient form ) was also used for the verb " divine " in the oracle bones of the late Shang dynasty , which preceded the Zhou . It also carried meanings of being or making upright or correct , and was defined by the Eastern Han scholar Zheng Xuan as " to enquire into the correctness " of a proposed activity . 
 The names of the hexagrams are usually words that appear in their respective line statements , but in five cases ( 2 , 9 , 26 , 61 , and 63 ) an unrelated character of unclear purpose appears . The hexagram names could have been chosen arbitrarily from the line statements , but it is also possible that the line statements were derived from the hexagram names . The line statements , which make up most of the book , are exceedingly cryptic . Each line begins with a word indicating the line number , " base , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , top " , and either the number 6 for a broken line , or the number 9 for a whole line . <unk> 1 and 2 have an extra line statement , named yong . Following the line number , the line statements may make oracular or prognostic statements . Some line statements also contain poetry or references to historical events . 
 = = = Usage = = = 
 Archaeological evidence shows that Zhou dynasty divination was grounded in cleromancy , the production of seemingly random numbers to determine divine intent . The Zhou yi provided a guide to cleromancy that used the stalks of the yarrow plant , but it is not known how the yarrow stalks became numbers , or how specific lines were chosen from the line readings . In the hexagrams , broken lines were used as shorthand for the numbers 6 ( <unk> ) and 8 ( <unk> ) , and solid lines were shorthand for values of 7 ( <unk> ) and 9 ( <unk> ) . The Great Commentary contains a late classic description of a process where various numerological operations are performed on a bundle of 50 stalks , leaving remainders of 6 to 9 . Like the Zhou yi itself , yarrow stalk divination dates to the Western Zhou period , although its modern form is a reconstruction . 
 The ancient narratives Zuo zhuan and Guoyu contain the oldest descriptions of divination using the Zhou yi . The two histories describe more than twenty successful divinations conducted by professional soothsayers for royal families between 671 BC and 487 BC . The method of divination is not explained , and none of the stories employ predetermined commentaries , patterns , or interpretations . Only the hexagrams and line statements are used . By the 4th century BC , the authority of the Zhou yi was also cited for rhetorical purposes , without relation to any stated divination . The Zuo zhuan does not contain records of private individuals , but Qin dynasty records found at Shuihudi show that the hexagrams were privately consulted to answer questions such as business , health , children , and determining lucky days . 
 The most common form of divination with the I Ching in use today is a reconstruction of the method described in these histories , in the 300 BC Great Commentary , and later in the Huainanzi and the Lunheng . From the Great Commentary 's description , the Neo @-@ Confucian Zhu Xi reconstructed a method of yarrow stalk divination that is still used throughout the Far East . In the modern period , Gao Heng attempted his own reconstruction , which varies from Zhu Xi in places . Another divination method , employing coins , became widely used in the Tang dynasty and is still used today . In the modern period , alternative methods such as specialized dice and <unk> have also appeared . 
 In the Zuo zhuan stories , individual lines of hexagrams are denoted by using the genitive particle zhi , followed by the name of another hexagram where that specific line had another form . In later attempts to reconstruct ancient divination methods , the word zhi was interpreted as a verb meaning " moving to " , an apparent indication that hexagrams could be transformed into other hexagrams . However , there are no instances of " changeable lines " in the Zuo zhuan . In all 12 out of 12 line statements quoted , the original hexagrams are used to produce the oracle . 
 = = The classic : I Ching = = 
 In 136 BC , Emperor Wu of Han named the Zhou yi " the first among the classics " , dubbing it the Classic of Changes or I Ching . Emperor Wu 's placement of the I Ching among the Five Classics was informed by a broad span of cultural influences that included Confucianism , Daoism , Legalism , yin @-@ yang cosmology , and Wu Xing physical theory . While the Zhou yi does not contain any cosmological analogies , the I Ching was read as a microcosm of the universe that offered complex , symbolic correspondences . The official edition of the text was literally set in stone , as one of the <unk> Stone Classics . The canonized I Ching became the standard text for over two thousand years , until alternate versions of the Zhou yi and related texts were discovered in the 20th century . 
 = = = Ten Wings = = = 
 Part of the canonization of the Zhou yi bound it to a set of ten commentaries called the Ten Wings . The Ten Wings are of a much later provenance than the Zhou yi , and are the production of a different society . The Zhou yi was written in Early Old Chinese , while the Ten Wings were written in a predecessor to Middle Chinese . The specific origins of the Ten Wings are still a complete mystery to academics . Regardless of their historical relation to the text , the philosophical depth of the Ten Wings made the I Ching a perfect fit to Han period Confucian scholarship . The inclusion of the Ten Wings reflects a widespread recognition in ancient China , found in the Zuo zhuan and other pre @-@ Han texts , that the I Ching was a rich moral and symbolic document useful for more than professional divination . 
 Arguably the most important of the Ten Wings is the Great Commentary ( <unk> ) or Xi ci , which dates to roughly 300 BC . The Great Commentary describes the I Ching as a microcosm of the universe and a symbolic description of the processes of change . By partaking in the spiritual experience of the I Ching , the Great Commentary states , the individual can understand the deeper patterns of the universe . Among other subjects , it explains how the eight trigrams proceeded from the eternal oneness of the universe through three <unk> . The other Wings provide different perspectives on essentially the same viewpoint , giving ancient , cosmic authority to the I Ching . For example , the <unk> provides a moral interpretation that parallels the first two hexagrams , <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) , with Heaven and Earth , and the <unk> attributes to the symbolic function of the hexagrams the ability to understand self , world , and destiny . Throughout the Ten Wings , there are passages that seem to purposefully increase the ambiguity of the base text , pointing to a recognition of multiple layers of symbolism . 
 The Great Commentary associates knowledge of the I Ching with the ability to " delight in Heaven and understand fate ; " the sage who reads it will see cosmological patterns and not despair in mere material difficulties . The Japanese word for " metaphysics " , <unk> ( <unk> ; pinyin : xíng ér shàng <unk> ) is derived from a statement found in the Great Commentary that " what is above form [ xíng ér shàng ] is called Dao ; what is under form is called a tool " . The word has also been borrowed into Korean and re @-@ borrowed back into Chinese . 
 The Ten Wings were traditionally attributed to Confucius , possibly based on a misreading of the Records of the Grand Historian . Although it rested on historically shaky grounds , the association of the I Ching with Confucius gave weight to the text and was taken as an article of faith throughout the Han and Tang dynasties . The I Ching was not included in the burning of the Confucian classics , and textual evidence strongly suggests that Confucius did not consider the Zhou yi a " classic " . An ancient commentary on the Zhou yi found at Mawangdui portrays Confucius as endorsing it as a source of wisdom first and an imperfect divination text second . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 In the canonical I Ching , the hexagrams are arranged in an order dubbed the King Wen sequence after King Wen of Zhou , who founded the Zhou dynasty and supposedly reformed the method of interpretation . The sequence generally pair hexagrams with their upside @-@ down equivalents , although in eight cases hexagrams are paired with their inversion . Another order , found at Mawangdui in 1973 , arranges the hexagrams into eight groups sharing the same upper <unk> . But the oldest known manuscript , found in 1987 and now held by the Shanghai Library , was almost certainly arranged in the King Wen sequence , and it has even been proposed that a pottery paddle from the Western Zhou period contains four hexagrams in the King Wen sequence . Whichever of these arrangements is older , it is not evident that the order of the hexagrams was of interest to the original authors of the Zhou yi . The assignment of numbers , binary or decimal , to specific hexagrams is a modern invention .

 During the Eastern Han , I Ching interpretation divided into two schools , originating in a dispute over minor differences between different editions of the received text . The first school , known as New Text criticism , was more egalitarian and eclectic , and sought to find symbolic and numerological parallels between the natural world and the hexagrams . Their commentaries provided the basis of the School of Images and Numbers . The other school , Old Text criticism , was more scholarly and hierarchical , and focused on the moral content of the text , providing the basis for the School of Meanings and Principles . The New Text scholars distributed alternate versions of the text and freely integrated non @-@ canonical commentaries into their work , as well as propagating alternate systems of divination such as the <unk> . Most of this early commentary , such as the image and number work of Jing Fang , Yu Fan and Xun Shuang , is no longer extant . Only short fragments survive , from a Tang dynasty text called Zhou yi <unk> . 
 With the fall of the Han , I Ching scholarship was no longer organized into systematic schools . The most influential writer of this period was Wang Bi , who discarded the numerology of Han commentators and integrated the philosophy of the Ten Wings directly into the central text of the I Ching , creating such a persuasive narrative that Han commentators were no longer considered significant . A century later Han <unk> added commentaries on the Ten Wings to Wang Bi 's book , creating a text called the Zhouyi zhu . The principal rival interpretation was a practical text on divination by the soothsayer Guan Lu . 
 = = = Tang and Song dynasties = = = 
 At the beginning of the Tang dynasty , Emperor Taizong of Tang ordered Kong <unk> to create a canonical edition of the I Ching . Choosing the 3rd @-@ century Zhouyi zhu as the official commentary , he added to it a <unk> drawing out the subtler levels of Wang Bi 's explanations . The resulting work , the Zhouyi <unk> , became the standard edition of the I Ching through the Song dynasty . 
 By the 11th century , the I Ching was being read as a work of intricate philosophy , as a jumping @-@ off point for examining great metaphysical questions and ethical issues . Cheng Yi , patriarch of the Neo @-@ Confucian Cheng – Zhu school , read the I Ching as a guide to moral perfection . He described the text as a way to for ministers to form honest political factions , root out corruption , and solve problems in government . 
 The contemporary scholar Shao Yong rearranged the hexagrams in a format that resembles modern binary numbers , although he did not intend his arrangement to be used mathematically . 
 = = = Neo @-@ Confucian = = = 
 The 12th century Neo @-@ Confucian Zhu Xi , cofounder of the Cheng – Zhu school , rejected both of the Han dynasty lines of commentary on the I Ching , proposing that the text was a work of divination , not philosophy . However , he still considered it useful for understanding the moral practices of the ancients , called " rectification of the mind " in the Great Learning . Zhu Xi 's reconstruction of I Ching yarrow stalk divination , based in part on the Great Commentary account , became the standard form and is still in use today . 
 As China entered the early modern period , the I Ching took on renewed relevance in both Confucian and Daoist study . The Kangxi Emperor was especially fond of the I Ching and ordered new interpretations of it . Qing dynasty scholars focused more intently on understanding pre @-@ classical grammar , assisting the development of new philological approaches in the modern period . 
 = = = Korean and Japanese = = = 
 In 1557 , the Korean Neo @-@ Confucian Yi Hwang produced one of the most influential I Ching studies of the early modern era , claiming that the spirit was a principle ( li ) and not a material force ( qi ) . Hwang accused the Neo @-@ Confucian school of having misread Zhu Xi . His critique proved influential not only in Korea but also in Japan . Other than this contribution , the I Ching was not central to the development of Korean Confucianism , and by the 19th century , I Ching studies were integrated into the <unk> reform movement . 
 In medieval Japan , secret teachings on the I Ching were publicized by <unk> Zen master <unk> <unk> and the <unk> Yoshida <unk> . I Ching studies in Japan took on new importance in the Edo period , during which over 1 @,@ 000 books were published on the subject by over 400 authors . The majority of these books were serious works of philology , reconstructing ancient usages and commentaries for practical purposes . A sizable minority focused on numerology , symbolism , and divination . During this time , over 150 editions of earlier Chinese commentaries were reprinted in Japan , including several texts that had become lost in China . In the early Edo period , writers such as Itō <unk> , Kumazawa <unk> , and <unk> <unk> ranked the I Ching the greatest of the Confucian classics . Many writers attempted to use the I Ching to explain Western science in a Japanese framework . One writer , <unk> Tadao , even attempted to employ Newtonian mechanics and the Copernican principle within an I Ching cosmology . This line of argument was later taken up in China by the Qing scholar and official Zhang <unk> . 
 = = = Early European = = = 
 Leibniz , who was corresponding with Jesuits in China , wrote the first European commentary on the I Ching in 1703 , arguing that it proved the universality of binary numbers and theism , since the broken lines , the " 0 " or " nothingness " , cannot become solid lines , the " 1 " or " oneness " , without the intervention of God . This was criticized by Hegel , who proclaimed that binary system and Chinese characters were " empty forms " that could not articulate spoken words with the clarity of the Western alphabet . In their discussion , I Ching hexagrams and Chinese characters were conflated into a single foreign idea , sparking a dialogue on Western philosophical questions such as universality and the nature of communication . In the 20th century , Jacques Derrida identified Hegel 's argument as <unk> , but accepted without question Hegel 's premise that the Chinese language cannot express philosophical ideas . 
 = = = Modern = = = 
 After the Xinhai Revolution , the I Ching was no longer part of mainstream Chinese political philosophy , but it maintained cultural influence as China 's most ancient text . Borrowing back from Leibniz , Chinese writers offered parallels between the I Ching and subjects such as linear algebra and logic in computer science , aiming to demonstrate that ancient Chinese cosmology had anticipated Western discoveries . The Sinologist Joseph Needham took the opposite stance , arguing that the I Ching had actually impeded scientific development by incorporating all physical knowledge into its metaphysics . The psychologist Carl Jung took interest in the possible universal nature of the imagery of the I Ching , and he introduced an influential German translation by Richard Wilhelm by discussing his theories of archetypes and synchronicity . Jung wrote , " Even to the most biased eye , it is obvious that this book represents one long admonition to careful scrutiny of one 's own character , attitude , and motives . " The book had a notable impact on the 1960s counterculture and on 20th century cultural figures such as Philip K. Dick , John Cage , Jorge Luis Borges , and Herman Hesse . 
 The modern period also brought a new level of skepticism and rigor to I Ching scholarship . Li <unk> spent several decades producing a new interpretation of the text , which was published posthumously in 1978 . Gao Heng , an expert in pre @-@ Qin China , <unk> its use as a Zhou dynasty oracle . Edward Shaughnessy proposed a new dating for the various strata of the text . New archaeological discoveries have enabled a deeper level of insight into how the text was used in the centuries before the Qin dynasty . Proponents of newly reconstructed Western Zhou readings , which often differ greatly from traditional readings of the text , are sometimes called the " modernist school . " 
 = = Translations = = 
 The I Ching has been translated into Western languages dozens of times , the most influential edition being the 1923 German translation of Richard Wilhelm . The earliest complete published I Ching translation in a Western language was a Latin translation done in the 1730s by Jesuit missionary Jean @-@ Baptiste Régis that was published in Germany in the 1830s . Although Thomas <unk> and James Legge had both translated the text in the 19th century , the text gained significant traction during the counterculture of the 1960s , with the translations of Wilhelm and John Blofeld attracting particular interest . Richard <unk> 's 1996 translation incorporated much of the new archaeological and philological discoveries of the 20th century . Gregory <unk> 's 1986 translation also attempts to reconstruct Zhou period readings and is arguably easier to read .

 = Béla H. Bánáthy = 
 Béla Heinrich Bánáthy ( Hungarian : Bánáthy Béla ; December 1 , 1919 – September 4 , 2003 ) was the founder of the White Stag Leadership Development Program , organized the International Systems Institute , and was co @-@ founder of the General Evolutionary Research Group , A Hungarian @-@ American who remained loyal to his birth country his entire life , he served as an influential professor of systems theory , systems scientist and professor at San Jose State University and UC Berkeley . He became a widely read and respected author in the United States . 
 He grew up in largely rural Hungary and served in the Hungarian military during World War II . When Russia invaded Hungary in April 1945 , he and his family fled to Allied occupied Austria and lived in a displaced persons camp for six years . In 1951 , they emigrated to Chicago , sponsored by the Presbyterian church . Within the year his former commanding officer suggested to the U.S. government that they hire Bánáthy as a Hungarian instructor at the Army Language School in Monterey , California . While living in Monterey , he founded the White Stag Leadership Development Program . His program gained national attention , and the Boy Scouts of America conducted research into incorporating leadership training into its programs . The Boy Scouts of America 's Wood Badge and junior leader training programs had until then focused primarily on Scoutcraft skills , not leadership , and William " Green Bar Bill " Hillcourt among others resisted the change . 
 After 20 years , Bánáthy left the renamed Defense Language Institute and went to work for the Far West Laboratory for Research and Development in Berkeley and later San Francisco . He retired from Far West in 1989 but maintained an active interest in social systems and science , including attending many conferences and advising students and others in those fields . In 1992 , he helped restart the Hungarian Scout Association within his native country . In 2003 , Bánáthy and Eva moved to live with their son Tibor in Chico , California . After a brief and unexpected illness , Bánáthy died on September 4 , 2003 . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Béla Bánáthy was born in 1919 in Gyula , Hungary , as the oldest of four sons . His father Peter was a minister of the Reformed Church in Hungary and his mother Hildegard <unk> was a teacher . Peter Bánáthy had earned the honorary title Vitéz for his service during World War I , and Béla , as his oldest son , inherited the title . 
 = = = Youth spent in Hungary = = = 
 When Bánáthy was about six years old , their family informally adopted Tamas Feri . Tamas was about 13 years old and from a poor gardener 's family . Tamas took Bánáthy on his first overnight camp out with his patrol to a small forest near Gyula . Bánáthy 's father became the Scoutmaster of the " small scouts " troop ( similar to American Cub Scouts ) . 
 When Bánáthy was nine years old , he became the troop leader ; during one national holiday , led the troop in a parade . About that time , the entire troop spent two weeks camping at a church camp at <unk> , north of Budapest . The church groups lived in wooden barracks , but Bánáthy 's troop stayed in tents , " as Scouts are supposed to do " . 
 The family moved about 84 kilometres ( 52 mi ) from Bánáthy 's birthplace of Gyula , to <unk> , Hungary , about 202 kilometres ( 126 mi ) southeast of Budapest . He joined the regular scout program of the Hungarian Scout Association and " <unk> <unk> " Troop 92 . During the 1930s , the troop had more than 50 Scouts and 30 " small scouts " . They held their monthly troop meetings on Sunday in a large <unk> and met weekly every Saturday as a patrol . Bánáthy reported : " Our weekly patrol meetings focused on scoutcraft and Scout spirit and guiding us to move through the various stages of advancement in rank . " 
 The Hungarian Scout program had four stages . During the first three years , Bánáthy advanced three stages . The last stage required Bánáthy to earn 25 merit badges . This last stage was called <unk> , after the mythical bird of Hungary . From spring to fall , as weather permitted , the patrol had many outings . Every summer the troop went on a two- to three @-@ week long summer camp . Bánáthy and his troop attended the 4th World Scout Jamboree in 1933 . Up until this time , he had intended to follow his father into the ministry , but changed his mind . 
 Bánáthy later wrote , 
 The highlight of the Jamboree for me was meeting Baden Powell , the Chief Scout of the World . One day , he visited our camp with the Chief Scout of Hungary , Count Pál Teleki ( who later became our Prime Minister ) , and the chief of the camp staff , Vitez Kisbarnaki Ferenc Farkas , a general staff officer of the Hungarian Royal Army . A few years later he became the commander of the Royal Ludovika Akademia ( when I was a student there ) . In the 1940s , he became the Chief Scout of Hungary . ( I was serving on his staff as head of national junior leadership training . ) 
 For me the Jamboree became a crucial career decision point . I resolved to choose the military as a life work ... There were two sources of this decision . One was my admiration of Lord Baden @-@ Powell , and his life @-@ example as a hero of the British Army and the founder and guide of scouting . The other was the influence of Captain <unk> , a staff officer of the Jamboree , who was assigned to our <unk> . We spent hours in conversation about scouting and the military as a career , as a major service in the character development of young Hungarian adults . After the Jamboree we corresponded for a while . By the end of the year I shared my decision with my parents . 
 While at the Jamboree , Bánáthy briefly met Joseph Szentkiralyi , another Scout from Hungary . Hungarian Sea Scout Paul Ferenc Sujan and American Maurice Tripp also attended . More than 20 years later , these three men collaborated in helping Bánáthy build a leadership program for youth in the United States . 
 Also in 1933 , Bánáthy attended the regional patrol leader training week . Later in 1934 , Bánáthy and six other members of his troop traveled to the National Jamboree in Poland . They camped in a large pine forest and visited Kraków and Warsaw . The Polish government hosted a banquet for all of the Scouts in the Presidential Palace . In 1934 , he was awarded the best notebook prize of the national spring leadership camp and in 1935 , he was invited to serve on the junior staff of the same camp at <unk> , Budapest . In 1935 , the troop traveled to the <unk> Mountains in northeastern Hungary for their summer camp . As a Senior Patrol leader , Bánáthy and two others took a bicycle tour in advance of the summer camp to preview the camping site . 
 = = = Military service during World War II = = = 
 The two military men that Bánáthy had met , and from whom he developed a desire to serve in the military , soon played roles on the national stage that would affect Bánáthy . In 1937 , Bánáthy entered the Ludovika <unk> , as was the custom for young men aspiring to military careers . In 1940 , at age 21 , Bánáthy was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the armored infantry . Later that year he met his future wife Eva Balazs . 
 Pál Teleki , whom Bánáthy had met at the 4th World Scout Jamboree in 1933 , was Chief Scout of Hungary and Prime Minister of Hungary . He and Regent Miklós Horthy tried to keep Hungary out of the war . They did seek reversal of what they believed was the unjust geographic division of Hungary by the 1920 Treaty of Trianon , which Germany promised to them . Through the First Vienna Award , the country gained a portion of Czechoslovakia that had historically been part of Hungary , and via the Second Vienna Award , they regained additional Romanian territory that had formerly been Hungarian . 
 When Yugoslavia 's government fell in a bloodless coup d 'état , Germany 's southern flank was exposed , and its planned invasion of Russia was threatened . Germany planned to invade and compel Belgrade 's support for the Axis ; it suggested that Hungary should also attack . Teleki refused , and the Germans asked permission to transport their troops across Hungary . 
 The British , with whom Teleki had had a long relationship , sent word via the Hungarian Minister in London that they would declare war if he assented to this action . Teleki soon learned that Regent Horthy and General Henrik Werth , Chief of Staff of the Hungarian Army , had permitted the Germans to cross Hungary 's borders . On 3 April 1941 , Teleki committed suicide . Horthy named General Farkas as the country 's new Chief Scout . 
 Bánáthy served two tours on the Russian front in World War II as an armored infantry officer . The peace @-@ time Hungarian Army had received very little training . The Hungarian Army expanded rapidly from an initial force of 80 @,@ 000 , but when fighting started , the rank @-@ and @-@ file of the army had undergone only eight weeks of training . 
 In 1941 , Bánáthy 's unit advanced as part of German Army Group South to within 140 kilometres ( 87 mi ) of Moscow , during a severe November ice storm . Wounded during the action , Banathy returned from the front to Budapest for convalescence . He married his fiancé , Eva Balazs , with his arm in a sling . 
 In 1942 , as a soldier in the 109 @,@ 000 strong Second Hungarian Army , Bánáthy returned to the Russian front with the Hungarian Second Army ( Second Magyar <unk> ) . They fought at the Don River bend , supporting the German attack during the Stalingrad . They were charged with protecting the 8th Italian Army 's's northern flank between the Novaya Pokrovka on the Don River to <unk> , part of the larger force defending the drive by the German 6th Army against Soviet General Vasily Chuikov 's 62nd Army , which was defending Stalingrad . 
 On 13 January 1943 , the Russian troops , with an overwhelming force in numbers and equipment , began the Voronezh @-@ Kharkov Strategic Offensive Operation on the Bryansk , Voronezh , and Southwestern Fronts . They rapidly destroyed the Hungarian Second Army in which Bánáthy served near Svoboda on the Don River . During the Second Hungarian Army 's 12 months of activity on the Russian front , from an initial force of about 200 @,@ 000 Hungarian soldiers and 50 @,@ 000 Jewish forced laborers , it had lost about 100 @,@ 000 to death , 35 @,@ 000 wounded , and 60 @,@ 000 taken prisoners of war . About 40 @,@ 000 men returned to Hungary , where they became scapegoats by Hitler for the catastrophic Axis defeat . " No nation lost as much blood during World War II in such a short period of time . " 
 Bánáthy had been seriously wounded and returned to Budapest , where he spent seven months recuperating . Afterward he was promoted as a junior officer of the Royal Hungarian Army and served on the faculty of the Ludovika Akademia under Commandant General Farkas . Farkas sought a volunteer to teach junior leader training at the academy and Bánáthy volunteered . Farkas also asked Bánáthy to organize a Scout Troop for young men , 19 years and older , which was a common practice within the Hungarian Scout Association at the time . Bánáthy became committed to training the young men in officer 's leadership skills ; he served as the voluntary national director for youth leadership development and a member of the National Council of the Hungarian Scout Association . 
 In July 1944 Bánáthy 's mentor Colonel @-@ General Kisbarnaki Ferenc Farkas was Commander of the Hungarian VI Army Corps , which had been garrisoned at Debrecen . He replaced General <unk> , who was loyal to the fascist Arrow Cross Party . During that month , Farkas ' VI Army Corp was instrumental in repelling a Red Army attack across the Carpathian mountains . On 15 October 1944 , Farkas was named commander of the Pest bridgehead and Government Commissioner for Evacuation . In early November 1944 , the first Russian units appeared on the southeastern edge of Budapest . As an associate of Farkas , Bánáthy likely had advance notice of the Russian advance . He also knew he would likely be executed if captured . Bánáthy was able to get his wife Eva , one @-@ year @-@ old son Béla and two @-@ week @-@ old son László out of Budapest . Bánáthy 's family , along with other officers and their families , found shelter at first in farmhouses , and later in bunkers , caves , and trenches . 
 When the Hungarian Second Army was disbanded on 1 December 1944 due to a lack of equipment and personnel , the remaining units of the Second Army , including Bánáthy 's , were transferred to the Third Army . The Siege of Budapest began when the city was encircled on 29 December 1944 by the Red Army . Bánáthy fought with the remainder of his unit against the Russians until after Budapest fell on 13 February 1945 . The Axis was striving to protect the last oil fields they controlled in western Hungary around Lake Balaton . By late March 1945 , most of what was left of the Hungarian Third Army was surrounded and destroyed about 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) to the west of Budapest in an advance by the Soviet 46th Army towards Vienna . The remaining shattered units fought on as they retreated progressively westward through the Transdanubian Mountains towards Austria . 
 Bánáthy 's family and others of the remainder of his and other military units made their way west , along with tens of thousands of other refugees , about 250 kilometres ( 160 mi ) into Austria , trying to stay ahead of advancing Russian troops . Temperatures through the time of their flight remained near 0 ° C ( 32 ° F ) . 
 = = = Life in displaced persons camp = = = 
 Bánáthy reunited with his family in Austria . As the war ended and Austria was occupied in April 1945 by the French , British , Soviet and US military forces , the family was placed in an Allied displaced persons camp . They were housed in a single 6 by 10 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 by 3 @.@ 0 m ) room in a wooden barrack ; it served as their bedroom , kitchen , living room and firewood storage area . Food was extremely scarce and for five years they subsisted on around 600 calories per person per day . They were among 1 @.@ 4 million displaced persons in Austria at the time during a worldwide food shortage as a result of the war . Food was also severely restricted by punitive U.S. policies including directive JCS 1067 . In 1947 German citizens were surviving on 1040 calories a day , but the Allies were also suffering from food shortages . 
 Bánáthy later traded for milk to give two @-@ year @-@ old Béla and one @-@ year @-@ old László enough protein . As extremely little food was available in the camps , in early 1947 his wife 's twin sister came from Hungary to take their older two sons back to live with the older sister . The Pallendal family , Bánáthy 's in @-@ laws , was well @-@ educated and relatively wealthy , so they had access to more food than what was available in the camps . They intended to return the Banathy boys to their parents within a year . Beginning in early 1948 , when the Cold War ensued , it became virtually impossible for refugees or displaced persons to cross from the border of one country into another , or even from one Occupation Zone to another . The Pallendal family could not return the two boys from behind the Iron Curtain . 
 In 1948 , shortly after their third son Tibor was born , the Banathy family was moved to another camp , near a Marshall Plan warehouse . Bánáthy was assigned to unload sacks of wheat from railroad cars . He contacted the World Scouting Movement for assistance and began to organize scouting in the DP camps . During 1947 , Bánáthy was named the Hungarian Scout Commissioner for Austria ; he led training for Hungarian Scout leaders along with his former commanding officer Farkas . He was ordained by the World Council of Churches and became minister for youth among Hungarian refugees . Banathy served as director of religious education of the Protestant Refugee Service of Austria , was editor of a religious youth service and of a Scout publication . 
 In 1948 Bánáthy 's fourth son Robert was born . Bánáthy soon found work as a technical draftsman in the statistical office of a U.S. Army warehouse . In 1949 , with help from a Swiss foundation , Bánáthy assisted in establishing and was selected as the President of the Collegium <unk> , a boarding school for refugees , at Zell am See near <unk> , Austria . In the same year , the Communist government in Hungary seized the businesses belonging to the Pallendal family . Because they were members of the social elite , the Communist government considered them to be a political threat . 
 In 1951 , in what was a common practice during this time , the Hungarian Police arrived at dawn to seize the Pallendal family home and arrest and deport the family from Budapest . Seven @-@ year @-@ old Béla and six @-@ year @-@ old László Banathy , along with their Pallendal grandmother and two aunts , were put aboard a freight train and sent toward Russia . The train stopped occasionally and a few hundred people were forced off at rural towns . The Pallendal family was ejected in eastern Hungary . There an uncle located them and hid them from authorities in a small village . 
 = = = <unk> to the United States = = = 
 In January , 1951 , the student body of the Presbyterian McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago sponsored Béla , Eva , Tibor and Robert Banathy as refugees to the United States . Bánáthy lived with his family at the Seminary , where he worked nights 60 hours a week shoveling coal to fire the Seminary furnace . At the same time , he was studying English from a book . He occasionally preached at nearby Hungarian churches . His wife found work in a paper factory and Tibor , their third son , entered American public school . 
 = = = Begins teaching Hungarian language = = = 
 When World War II ended , General Farkas was designated as the U.S. Army 's liaison to former Hungarian prisoners of war . In 1951 he recommended Bánáthy as a Hungarian language instructor , and the younger man was invited to teach at the U.S. government 's Army Language School in Monterey , California . Bánáthy moved to Monterey in June 1951 , a pivotal change in his life . At the Army Language School , he met Joseph Szentkiralyi ( Americanized as St. Clair ) , the founder of the Hungarian Department . He learned they had met when Banathy was 14 at the 4th World Scout Jamboree in 1933 . The wives of the two men met and realized they had been girlhood friends in grammar school in Budapest . From having managed a <unk> family restaurant in Budapest before World War II , Eva took work as a waitress in a restaurant on the Monterey Peninsula . Bánáthy served as President of his local Parent @-@ Teacher Association and on the board of the local Red Cross . In the same year , Paul Ferenc Sujan , another former scout , joined the language school faculty . 
 On February 28 , 1956 , Bánáthy was naturalized as a United States citizen . After nine years of separation , and repeated failures to get his sons repatriated from behind the Iron Curtain , Bánáthy obtained help from Dr. Eugene Blake , President of the National Council of Churches ; Representative Charles M. Teague ; Ernest Nagy , Vice Consul in the U.S. Legation in Budapest ; Hulda <unk> of the McCormick Theological Seminary ; and Howard Pyle , deputy assistant to President Dwight D. Eisenhower . He was finally able to arrange for 13 @-@ year @-@ old Béla and 11 @-@ year @-@ old László to emigrate to the United States A photograph of the two boys greeting their mother was featured in Life Magazine . 
 Carrying pictures of their parents , two Hungarian brothers arrived at New York International Airport , Idlewild , Queens , yesterday ... The pictures are necessary because the boys ... have not seen their mother and father for nine years . 
 The boys were greeted by their parents at San Francisco International Airport at 1 : 10 a.m. The boys ' release marked the first time since the Cold War that anyone under 65 years old had been allowed to leave Hungary to be reunited with family .

 Bánáthy was an educator , a systems and design scientist , and an author . At the Army Language School , he taught in the Hungarian language department , later becoming its chairman . 
 = = = White Stag Leadership Development Program = = = 
 In 1957 Bánáthy began enlarging a concept for a leadership development program . As Council Training Chairman in the Monterey Bay Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America , he received strong support from the Council Executive and Council Executive Board for his proposal to train boys in leadership skills . He was assisted by fellow Hungarians Joe Szentkiralyi ( aka St. Clair , Chair of the Hungarian Language Department at the Army Language school ) and Paul Sujan ( Hungarian Language Instructor at the Army Language school ) ; Fran Peterson ( a member of the National Council and a Scoutmaster from <unk> , California ) ; and Maury Tripp ( a Scouter from Saratoga , California , a member of the National Council , and a research scientist ) . " Lord Baden @-@ Powell was my personal idol and I long felt a commitment to give back to Scouting what I had received " , Bánáthy said . 
 As part of his master 's degree program in counseling psychology at San José State University , he wrote a thesis titled " A Design for Leadership Development in Scouting " . This book described the founding principles of the White Stag program , which was later adapted by the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America . Prior to Bánáthy 's work , the adult Wood Badge and the junior leader training programs had focused on teaching Scoutcraft skills and some aspects of the Patrol Method . His research and findings on teaching principles and competencies of leadership had a huge impact on these two programs , shifting their focus to leadership skills . 
 Some individuals on the national staff and many volunteers across the nation resisted the idea of changing the focus of Wood Badge from training leaders in Scoutcraft to leadership skills . Among them was William " Green Bar Bill " Hillcourt , who had been the first United States Wood Badge Course Director in 1948 . Although officially retired , he had many loyal followers . He was adamant that Wood Badge should continue to teach Scoutcraft skills and tried to persuade the national council to stick to that tradition , but his objections were ignored . 
 The leadership competencies Banathy articulated became the de facto method for Scout adult and junior leader training . ( In 2008 , the White Stag program celebrated its 50th anniversary . ) In 1960 , the Monterey Bay Area Council recognized Béla for his exceptional service to youth and awarded him the Silver Beaver . 
 In the 1970s , due to the success of the White Stag program , Bánáthy was appointed to the Interamerican Scout Committee and participated in three <unk> " Train the Trainer " events in Mexico , Costa Rica , and Venezuela . He guided their national training teams in designing leadership development by design programs . Béla also taught in Sunday School and was on the Board of the United Methodist Church of the Wayfarer in Carmel , California . 
 = = = Systems science = = = 
 In the 1960s Bánáthy began teaching courses in applied linguistics and systems science at San José State University . In 1962 he was named Dean and Chairman of the East Europe and Middle East Division at the Army Language School , overseeing ten language departments . In 1963 he completed his master 's degree in psychology at San Jose State University , and in 1966 he received a doctorate in education for a transdisciplinary program in education , systems theory , and linguistics from the University of California in Berkeley . During the mid @-@ 1960s Bánáthy was named Chair of Western Division of the Society for General Systems Research . He published his first book , Instructional Systems , in 1968 . 
 = = = Large complex systems = = = 
 During the 1960s and 1970s , Bánáthy was a visiting professor at the University of California , Berkeley and continued teaching at San Jose State University . In 1969 , he left the renamed Defense Language Institute and became a Program Director , and later Senior Research Director and Associate Laboratory Director , at the Far West Laboratory for Research and Development ( now <unk> ) in Berkeley ( later moved to San Francisco ) . He " directed over fifty research and development programs , designed many curriculum projects and several large scale complex systems , including the design and implementation of a Ph.D. program in educational research and development for UC Berkeley " . 
 In the 1970s and 1980s , he focused his research on the application of systems and design theories and methodologies in social , social service , educational , and human development systems . In the 1980s he developed and guided a Ph.D. curriculum in humanistic systems inquiry and social systems design for the Saybrook Graduate School . 
 = = = International Systems Institute = = = 
 In 1981 , he founded the International Systems Institute ( ISI ) , a non @-@ profit , public benefit scientific and educational corporation in Carmel , California , USA . He organized its first meeting at <unk> am See , Austria in 1982 . 
 What was truly revolutionary about the International Systems Institute was Banathy 's method for organizing conferences . Banathy observed that in traditional conferences , a few usually well @-@ respected or prestigious individuals would apply to present " pre @-@ packaged new ideas " to others . In typical conferences , presenting almost always carries more prestige than listening ; the few presenters share their wisdom with the many . This one @-@ to @-@ many or " hierarchical knowledge distribution system " slowed the sharing and spreading of ideas about which many people cared deeply if not passionately , as there was always limited opportunity for interchange among participants . This interaction was usually wedged into the interstices of the formal schedule in the form of informal , spontaneous gatherings for which no record existed . 
 The notion that presenting is more important than listening aroused lifelong antipathy in Bánáthy . When he formulated the leadership competencies of the White Stag Leadership Development Program in the 1960s , he described the passing of knowledge from one to another as " Manager of Learning " . He wrote extensively about how the focus should be on the learner , not the teacher . 
 Bánáthy advanced a different vision for conferences , one that would allow everyone to fully engage . He proposed that everyone be given the opportunity to prepare and distribute papers to all participants in advance of the conference . And instead of listening to speeches , conference attendees took part in extended , non @-@ hierarchical conversations about the conference papers . The conference proceedings were the result of these conversations . Bánáthy felt strongly that systems scholars from all over the world should be given ongoing opportunities to engage in extended conversations so they might put their expertise " actively into the service of humanity worldwide " . 
 Bánáthy wrote : " We aspire to reap the ' reflecting and creating power ' of groups that emerge in the course of disciplined and focused conversations on issues that are important to us and to our society " . Participants at International Systems Institute gatherings have , since the original meeting organized by Bánáthy in 1982 , organized them around this principle and referred to them as " conversations " .

 In 1984 , he was co @-@ founder with general evolution theorist Ervin László and others of the initially secret General Evolutionary Research Group . A member of the Society of General Systems Research since the 1960s , he was Managing Director of the Society in the early 1980s , and in 1985 he became its president . He then served on its Board of Trustees . During the 1980s , he served on the Executive Committee of the International Federation of Systems Research . In 1989 , he retired from Far West Labs and returned to live on the Monterey Peninsula . He continued to serve as Professor Emeritus for the Saybrook Graduate School , counseling Ph.D. students . He also continued his work with the annual ISI international systems design conversations , and authored a number of articles and books about systems , design , and evolutionary research . He served two terms as president of the International Federation of Systems Research during 1994 @-@ 98 . 
 He coordinated over twenty international systems research conferences held in eight countries , including the 1994 Conversation on Systems Design conversation held at <unk> Am See , Austria , sponsored by the International Federation of Systems Research . He was also honorary editor of three international systems journals : Systems Research and Behavioral Science , the Journal of Applied Systems Studies , and Systems . He was on the Board of Editors of World Futures , and served as a contributing editor of Educational Technology .

 In 1992 , Bánáthy , a long @-@ standing member of the Hungarian Scout Association Abroad ( <unk> Magyar <unk> ) , traveled from his Monterey , California home in the United States to Hungary following its renewed freedom . There , he helped restart the Hungarian Scout Association within his native country . 
 Bánáthy spent considerable time during the last few years of his life caring for his wife Eva in their home in Carmel , California . She had been in poor health for a number of years after a stroke . In the summer of 2003 Bánáthy and his wife moved to live with their son Tibor in Chico , California . After a brief and unexpected illness , Bánáthy died on September 4 , 2003 . He and Eva had been married 64 years at the time of his death .

 = Pithole , Pennsylvania = 
 Pithole , or Pithole City , is a ghost town in Cornplanter Township , Venango County in Pennsylvania , about 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) from Oil Creek State Park and the Drake Well Museum , the site of the first commercial oil well in the United States . Pithole 's sudden growth and equally rapid decline , as well as its status as a " proving ground " of sorts for the burgeoning petroleum industry , made it one of the most famous of oil boomtowns . 
 Oil strikes at nearby wells in January 1865 prompted a large influx of people to the area that would become Pithole , most of whom were land speculators . The town was laid out in May 1865 , and by December was incorporated with an approximate population of 20 @,@ 000 . At its peak , Pithole had at least 54 hotels , 3 churches , the third largest post office in Pennsylvania , a newspaper , a theater , a railroad , the world 's first pipeline and a red @-@ light district " the likes of Dodge City 's . " By 1866 , economic growth and oil production in Pithole had slowed . Oil strikes around other nearby communities and numerous fires drove residents away from Pithole and , by 1877 , the borough was unincorporated . 
 The site was cleared of overgrowth and was donated to the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission in 1961 . A visitor center , containing exhibits pertaining to the history of Pithole , was built in 1972 . Pithole was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The city of Pithole derived its name from its proximity to Pithole Creek , which flows through Venango County to the Allegheny River . The origin of the name " Pithole " itself , however , is a mystery . One origination theory is that early pioneers stumbled across strange fissures from which sulfurous fumes wafted . Such " pit @-@ holes " are found in the area where Pithole Creek empties into the Allegheny River , with some measuring 14 inches ( 36 cm ) wide and 8 feet ( 2 m ) long . Another possible explanation involves the discovery of ancient pits dug by early settlers , some 8 feet ( 2 m ) wide and 12 feet ( 4 m ) deep , that were cribbed with oil @-@ soaked timbers . These " pit @-@ holes " , found along Oil Creek and in Cornplanter Township , supposedly predate the Senecas who inhabited the area from the mid @-@ 17th to the late 18th century . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Most of the oil produced in northwestern Pennsylvania was formed in sandstone reservoir rocks at the boundary between the Mississippian and Devonian rock layers . Over time , the oil migrated toward the surface , became trapped beneath an impervious layer of caprock , and formed a reservoir . The presence of upwards @-@ curving folds in the caprock called anticlines , or sometimes an inversion of an anticline called a syncline , greatly varied the depth of the reservoirs , from around 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) to just beneath the surface . 
 The majority of the oil wells in the vicinity of Pithole and the Oil Creek valley tapped into a sandstone formation known as the Venango Third sand . The Venango Third contained large volumes of oil under high pressure at only 450 to 550 feet ( 140 to 170 m ) below ground level . Other oil @-@ producing formations in the area were " the Venango First and Second [ sands ] , the latter often prevailing after the Third sand was lost . " At Pithole , the " first sandstone was reached at 115 feet [ 35 m ] , the second at 345 feet [ 105 m ] , the third at 480 feet [ 146 m ] , the fourth at 600 feet [ 183 m ] , and the oil itself at 615 feet [ 187 m ] " by the Frazier Well , according to a report by the Oil City Register . Inaccurate numbering of the layers by the drillers , however , put the Fourth sand above the real Third at 670 feet ( 200 m ) . 
 = = Geography and climate = = 
 Pithole is located in northwestern Pennsylvania , 50 miles ( 80 km ) southeast of Erie and 103 miles ( 166 km ) north @-@ northeast of Pittsburgh . The nearest cities to Pithole are Titusville , approximately 8 miles ( 13 km ) to the northwest , and Oil City , 9 miles ( 14 km ) to the southwest . Pithole is located on Pithole Road ( State Route 1006 ) , almost 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) southwest of Pennsylvania Route 36 and about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) east Pennsylvania Route 227 . 
 Pithole was laid out with four primary east – west streets : First , Second , Third and Fourth . Duncan , Mason , Prather , Brown and Holmden Streets traversed Pithole from north to south . Each street was 60 feet ( 18 m ) wide , except for Duncan at 80 feet ( 24 m ) . All five north – south streets terminated at First Street ; Mason started at Third ; Prather and Brown started at Fourth . Duncan and Holmden Streets both began at a Y @-@ intersection with the road from Titusville . All four east – west streets began at Duncan and ended at Holmden Street except for First , which extended to the Frazier Well . 
 July is the hottest month in Pithole , when the average high temperature is 81 ° F ( 27 ° C ) and the average low is 57 ° F ( 14 ° C ) . January is the coldest month with an average high of 32 ° F ( 0 ° C ) and an average low of 13 ° F ( − 11 ° C ) . The average 44 inches ( 1 @,@ 118 mm ) of precipitation a year wreaked havoc on Pithole 's many unpaved streets , especially the heavily traveled First and Holmden . Portions of First Street were planked or <unk> in response to the resulting quagmire of mud that would often trap wagons and draft animals . 
 = = History = = 
 The area around Pithole , and modern @-@ day Venango County , was formerly inhabited by Eries , who were eventually wiped out by the Iroquois in 1653 . On October 23 , 1784 , the Iroquois , which included the Seneca , ceded the land to Pennsylvania in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix . Venango County was formed from portions of Allegheny and Lycoming counties on March 12 , 1800 . Cornplanter Township was settled in 1795 and was incorporated on November 28 , 1833 . 
 In 1859 , Edwin Drake successfully drilled the first oil well along the banks of Oil Creek , outside of Titusville in Crawford County . Within a half year , over 500 wells were built along Oil Creek , in the 16 @-@ mile ( 26 km ) corridor from Titusville to the creek 's mouth at the Allegheny River in Oil City . Other wells were drilled down the Allegheny towards Franklin and upriver to Tionesta in Forest County . Pithole Creek did not attract the same attention from speculators and investors , who preferred to risk their money on the tried @-@ and @-@ true method of drilling on flatter terrain near large rivers like the Allegheny and Oil Creek , rather than gamble on rougher terrain . In January 1864 , Isaiah Frazier leased two tracts of land , totaling 35 acres ( 14 ha ) , from Thomas Holmden , a farmer along Pithole Creek . Frazier , James Faulkner Jr . , Frederick W. Jones and J. Nelson Tappan formed the United States Petroleum Company in April 1864 and started drilling what was dubbed the United States Well , or Frazier Well , in June . On January 7 , 1865 , the Frazier Well struck oil . 
 = = = Boom = = = 
 Two weeks after the Frazier strike , the Twin Wells , just to the south of the Frazier Well , also struck oil . In May 1865 , A. P. Duncan and George C. Prather purchased the Holmden Farm , including the portions still leased to United States Petroleum , for $ 25 @,@ 000 and a bonus of $ 75 @,@ 000 . The wooded bluff overlooking the Frazier and Twin Wells was cleared and a town was laid out . The town was divided into 500 lots , which were put up for sale on May 24 . By July , the population was estimated to have been at least 2 @,@ 000 . The population of Pithole rose to 15 @,@ 000 people in September and 20 @,@ 000 by Christmas . Pithole was incorporated as a borough on November 30 , 1865 . 
 As many residents were temporary , Pithole had a total of 54 hotels ranging from simple rooming houses to luxury hotels like the Chase and Danforth Houses , or the Bonta House located in Prather City on the bluff on the opposite side of Pithole Creek . The Astor House , Pithole 's first hotel , was built in one day . Construction of the hotel was especially poor ; a lack of insulation and innumerable gaps in the walls made conditions in the hotel miserable during the winter . At one point , the Pithole Post Office , located on the first @-@ floor of the Chase House , was the third @-@ busiest in the state of Pennsylvania , behind Philadelphia and Pittsburgh . Three different churches — Catholic , Methodist and Presbyterian — were constructed by their respective congregations . Pithole 's local newspaper , the Pithole Daily Record was started on September 5 , 1865 . The largest building in Pithole — the three @-@ story , 1 @,@ 100 @-@ seat Murphy 's Theater — opened on September 17 . Among all the glamour , " every other building [ in Pithole ] was a bar " . Prostitution was rampant in Pithole , with most of the brothels built along First Street . Although the borough council passed ordinances banning the sex trade and carried out raids in an attempt to enforce them , they had little impact . 
 As oil production increased through the success of wells like the Frazier , Twin , Pool , Grant , and the two Homestead Wells , transportation of the oil to the outside world was still reliant on teamsters . The teamsters were notorious for mistreatment of their horses , most of which lost their hair due to a buildup of oil and only had a lifespan of a few months in Pithole . The high mortality rate caused a horse shortage , with more having to be brought in by rail from Ohio and New York . Teamsters often refused to work on days when the roads were impassable or gouged the oil producers . Various investors , fed up with the teamsters , pooled resources and built a plank toll road from Pithole to Titusville . Samuel Van <unk> , an oil buyer also frustrated with the teamsters , designed the world 's first pipeline , which opened on October 9 , 1865 . The 2 @-@ inch @-@ diameter ( 51 mm ) , 5 @.@ 5 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 8 @.@ 9 km ) pipeline connected Pithole to the Oil Creek Railroad and was initially able to transport 81 barrels ( 13 m3 ) per hour operating with three steam engines , equivalent to 300 teams working a 10 @-@ hour shift . A fourth engine brought the pipeline 's maximum capacity to 2 @,@ 500 barrels ( 397 m3 ) a day . The Oil City and Pithole Railroad ( OC & P ) was opened on December 18 . A second railroad was partly built but never finished , and plans for other railroads never led to construction . Along with the pipeline , another innovation developed in Pithole was the railroad tank car , which was essentially two wooden tanks , each with a capacity of 80 barrels ( 13 m3 ) , mounted onto a flatcar . 
 = = = Bust = = = 
 In March 1866 , a chain of banks owned by Charles Vernon Culver , a financier and member of United States House of Representatives for Pennsylvania 's 20th congressional district , collapsed . This triggered a financial panic throughout the oil region , bursting the oil bubble . <unk> and potential investors stopped coming to Pithole and life in Pithole settled down . In the early morning of February 24 , a house caught fire and the flames were spread to other buildings by the wind . In two hours , most of Holmden Street , and parts of Brown and Second Streets , were reduced to smoldering ashes . The worst of multiple fires occurred on August 2 , burning down several city blocks and destroying 27 wells . 
 When many oil strikes occurred elsewhere in Venango County in 1867 , people left Pithole , often taking their houses and places of business with them or abandoning their property . By December 1866 , the population had dropped to 2 @,@ 000 . The newspaper was relocated to Petroleum Center in July 1868 , becoming the Petroleum Center Daily Record . Both the Chase House and Murphy 's Theater were sold in August 1868 and moved to Pleasantville . Prather and Duncan sold their interests in Pithole before the downturn ; Prather split an estimated $ 3 million with his two brothers and moved to Meadville , while Duncan returned to Scotland with his fortune . The 1870 United States Census recorded the population of Pithole as only 237 . The borough charter of Pithole was officially annulled in August 1877 . The remains of the city were sold , in 1879 , back to Venango County for $ 4 @.@ 37 . The Catholic church was dismantled and moved to Tionesta in 1886 ; the Methodist church was kept in " usable condition " through private donations before being taken down in the 1930s . A stone altar was erected and consecrated by the Methodist Episcopal Church on August 27 , 1959 , the centennial of the Drake Well strike . 
 = = Visitor center = = 
 The site was purchased in 1957 by James B. Stevenson , the publisher of the Titusville Herald , who later served as the chairman of the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission from 1962 to 1971 . Stevenson cleared the brush from the site , and donated it to the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission in 1961 . Today , only a few foundations and mowed paths mark the buildings and former streets of Pithole . The site of Pithole was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on March 20 , 1973 . A walking tour of Pithole 's 84 @.@ 3 acres ( 34 @.@ 1 ha ) of streets can be completed in 42 minutes . The visitor center was constructed in 1972 . 
 The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission operates the visitor center as part of the nearby Drake Well Museum , adjacent to Oil Creek State Park , outside of Titusville . The visitor center contains several exhibits , including a scale model of the city at its peak , an oil @-@ transport wagon that is stuck in mud , and a small , informational theater . The visitor center is usually open , annually , from the Memorial Day weekend , at end of May , through Labor Day in September . The season is kicked off with the annual <unk> Day celebration featuring music , tours , demonstrations and other activities . 
 = King of Pop ( album ) = 
 King of Pop is a compilation album by American recording artist Michael Jackson released in commemoration of Michael Jackson 's 50th birthday . The album differs significantly in each country it was released because fan voting was employed to determine the songs for each country 's version . The album 's title comes from the title Jackson acquired approximately 20 years earlier . The album 's launch was made public on June 20 , 2008 , with the official announcement of the Australian version . The first release came with the German edition ( which is identical to the Swiss edition ) on August 22 , 2008 . 
 Fans in countries where Sony BMG operates national offices were given the opportunity to vote for songs from a list of Jackson 's back catalogue to be included in their country 's version of the album . Aside from the tracks selected by fans , a megamix of five songs from the Thriller album by Jason Nevins was also included in the pool . The album has been released in a total of 26 countries . Each pool list and release date differed slightly by country . " Billie Jean " is the only song to appear on all versions of the album . There has been no announcement of a release in North America . 
 = = Background = = 
 Prior to the release of King of Pop , Jackson issued the double @-@ disc album Thriller 25 , a 25th anniversary edition of Thriller . It was a commercial success , having done particularly well as a re @-@ issue , peaking at number one in eight countries and Europe . It reached number two in the US , number three in the UK and top 10 on over 30 national charts . In the US , Thriller 25 was just 14 @,@ 000 copies short of reaching the peak position , selling 166 @,@ 000 copies . It was ineligible for the Billboard 200 chart as a re @-@ release , but entered atop the Pop Catalog chart , where it stayed for 10 non @-@ consecutive weeks and had the best sales on that chart since December 1996 . 
 A few months afterward , Sony announced the release of regional editions of the King of Pop compilation , in celebration of Jackson 's 50th birthday . The album 's title is a reference to the same title Jackson acquired approximately 20 years ago when actress and friend Elizabeth Taylor presented Jackson with an " Artist of the Decade " award at the 1989 Soul Train Awards , proclaiming him " the true king of pop , rock and soul " . MTV , VH1 , FOX , and Jackson 's record label began marketing Jackson as the " King of Pop " to coincide with the release of Dangerous and the music video for " Black or White " , the album 's first single .

 = Japanese battleship Yashima = 
 Yashima ( <unk> , Yashima ) was a Fuji @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) in the 1890s . As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships herself , the ship was designed and built in the United Kingdom . She participated in the early stages of the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 1905 , including the Battle of Port Arthur on the second day of the war . She was involved in the subsequent operations until she struck two mines off Port Arthur in May 1904 . She did not sink immediately , but capsized while under tow a number of hours later . The Japanese were able to keep her loss a secret from the Russians for over a year so they did not try to take advantage of her loss . 
 = = Description = = 
 Yashima was 412 feet ( 125 @.@ 6 m ) long overall and had a beam of 73 feet 6 inches ( 22 @.@ 4 m ) and a full @-@ load draught of 26 feet ( 7 @.@ 925 m ) . She normally displaced 12 @,@ 230 long tons ( 12 @,@ 430 t ) and had a crew of 650 officers and enlisted men . Unlike her sister ship Fuji , she was fitted as an admiral 's flagship . 
 The ship was powered by two vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines using steam generated by ten cylindrical boilers . The engines were rated at 13 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 10 @,@ 100 kW ) , using forced draught , and designed to reach a top speed of 18 @.@ 25 knots ( 33 @.@ 80 km / h ; 21 @.@ 00 mph ) . Yashima , however , reached a top speed of 19 @.@ 46 knots ( 36 @.@ 04 km / h ; 22 @.@ 39 mph ) from 14 @,@ 075 ihp ( 10 @,@ 496 kW ) on her sea trials . She carried a maximum of 1 @,@ 200 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 200 long tons ) of coal which allowed her to steam for 4 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 400 km ; 4 @,@ 600 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 Yashima 's main battery consisted of four 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns mounted in two twin gun turrets , one each fore and aft of the superstructure . The secondary battery consisted of ten 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) quick @-@ firing guns , four mounted in casemates on the sides of the hull and six mounted on the upper deck , protected by gun shields . A number of smaller guns were carried for defence against torpedo boats . These included fourteen 47 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) 3 @-@ pounder guns and ten 2 @.@ 5 @-@ pounder Hotchkiss guns of the same calibre . She was also armed with five 18 @-@ inch torpedo tubes . Yashima 's waterline armour belt consisted of Harvey armour and was 14 – 18 inches ( 356 – 457 mm ) thick . The armour of her gun turrets was six inches thick and her deck was 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) thick . 
 In 1901 , the ship exchanged 16 of her 47 mm guns for an equal number of QF 12 pounder 12 cwt guns . This raised the number of crewmen to 652 and later to 741 . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Yashima , an old name for Japan , was ordered as part of the 1894 Naval Programme and the ship was laid down by Armstrong Whitworth at their Elswick shipyard on 6 December 1894 as yard number 625 . The ship was launched on 28 December 1896 and completed on 17 August 1897 , at a total cost of ¥ 10 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 . She conducted her sea trials during the following month . Yashima departed the UK on 15 September and arrived at Yokosuka on 30 November . 
 She was initially assigned to the Standing Fleet , the IJN 's primary combat fleet , but was reduced to reserve on 20 November . The ship was reclassified as a first @-@ class battleship on 21 March 1898 and reassigned to the Standing Fleet . Two years later , Yashima was again placed in reserve where she remained until reactivated on 28 December 1903 and assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet of the Combined Fleet . 
 At the start of the Russo @-@ Japanese War , Yashima , commanded by Captain Hajime Sakamoto , participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904 when Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō led the 1st Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur . Tōgō had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was , anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened , but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack . The Japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser Boyarin , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defences . Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns . Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese eight @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) and six @-@ inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships , which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect . Although many ships on both sides were hit , Russian casualties numbered only 17 , while the Japanese suffered 60 killed and wounded before Tōgō disengaged . Yashima was not hit during the battle . 
 On 10 March , Yashima and her sister Fuji , under the command of Rear Admiral Nashiba Tokioki , blindly bombarded the harbour of Port Arthur from Pigeon Bay , on the southwest side of the Liaodong Peninsula , at a range of 9 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 9 mi ) . They fired 154 twelve @-@ inch shells , but did little damage . When they tried again on 22 March , they were attacked by Russian coast defence guns that had been transferred there by the new Russian commander , Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov , and also from several Russian ships in Port Arthur using observers overlooking Pigeon Bay . The Japanese ships disengaged after Fuji was hit by a 12 @-@ inch shell . 
 Yashima participated in the action of 13 April when Tōgō successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron , including Makarov 's flagship , the battleship Petropavlovsk . When Makarov spotted the five battleships of the 1st Division , he turned back for Port Arthur and Petropavlovsk struck a minefield laid by the Japanese the previous night . The Russian battleship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded , Makarov one of the 677 killed . Emboldened by his success , Tōgō resumed long @-@ range bombardment missions , which prompted the Russians to lay more minefields . 
 On 14 May 1904 , Nashiba put to sea with the battleships Hatsuse ( flagship ) , Shikishima , and Yashima , the protected cruiser Kasagi , and the dispatch boat Tatsuta to relieve the Japanese blockading force off Port Arthur . On the following morning , the squadron encountered a minefield laid by the Russian minelayer Amur . Hatsuse struck one mine that disabled her steering around 11 : 10 and Yashima struck two others when moving to assist Hatsuse . One blew a hole in her starboard aft boiler room and the other detonated on the starboard forward side of her hull , near the underwater torpedo room . After the second detonation the ship had a 9 ° list to starboard that gradually increased during the day . 
 Yashima was towed away from the minefield , north towards the Japanese base in the Elliott Islands . She was still taking on water at an uncontrollable rate and Captain Sakamoto ordered the ship anchored around 17 : 00 near Encounter Rock to allow the crew to easily abandon ship . He assembled the crew , which sang the Japanese national anthem , Kimigayo , and then abandoned ship . Kasagi took Yashima in tow , but the battleship 's list continued to increase and she capsized about three hours later , after the cruiser was forced to cast off the tow , roughly at coordinates 38 ° 34 ′ N 121 ° 40 ′ E. No Russians observed Yashima sink so the Japanese were able to conceal her loss for more than a year . As part of the deception , the surviving crewmen were assigned to four auxiliary gunboats that were assigned to guard Port Arthur for the rest of the war and addressed their letters as if they were still aboard the battleship .

 = = Composition = = 
 " Conquistador " is an alternative rock song with influences and elements from electronica , utilizing programming and synthesizers .

The song features call @-@ and @-@ response verses leading to an anthemic chorus as Jared Leto voices the line " Say a prayer " . It includes the contribution from the band 's fans , credited as the Knights of the White Shadow , who provide additional vocals recorded at the band 's studio . During the song 's bridge , Leto proclaims " This is a fight to the death " over a " crushing " riff by guitarist Tomo Miličević and " pounding " drums by Shannon Leto . James Montgomery , writing for MTV News , felt that the sentiment " seems oddly fitting " as the song " crashes and careens " around Leto 's vocals . 
 In an interview with Loudwire , Jared Leto named the song the " dark wild child " of Love , Lust , Faith and Dreams . He explained , " Unbridled , and full of anarchistic madness , this song is crushed full of passion and energy . " He further described it as " big and bombastic and full of guitars " . The track features combative lyrics and repeated chants of " We will rise again " . Nadia Noir of CBS News felt that " conquistador " is an " apt title " for the " bombastic <unk> @-@ rock tune , an apocalyptic summons to something greater " .

 " Conquistador " received mostly positive reviews from music critics . Emily Zemler of Billboard called it " one of the grandest numbers " on the album and an " appropriately compelling early track " . Kaitlyn Hodnicki from Stature magazine described the song as a " sleazy rock stomp " that works " perfectly " with drummer Shannon Leto 's " addictive beat " , with lead guitarist Tomo Miličević delivering " one of his best riffs so far " . She also felt that the grit in Jared Leto 's voice is " surprising " and " works well " with the tone of the track . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic praised it as one of the album 's highlights . Alex Lai from Contactmusic gave the song a positive review , calling it a " thumping anthem " which is " instantly grasped " with the various chanted vocal parts . Brent Faulkner from PopMatters felt that the song " reveals " the total picture of the album , noticing the " dirty guitars that rock from the onset " . He stated that " Leto never fights the production for vocal clarity , even when things grow gargantuan on the anthemic chorus . " 
 Chris Maguire , writing for AltSounds , was impressed with the song , calling it a " solid rock track " , while Ian Winwood from Kerrang ! found it " rousing " . Adam Silverstein of Digital Spy named it a stand @-@ out track from the album and felt that songs like " Conquistador " " power up the vibe " . James Montgomery from MTV praised its " massive guitars , stabbing strings and thundering drums " . Andy Baber of musicOMH noticed the song 's " big guitar riff " and the " combative lyrics " . PureVolume 's Tom Lanham called it a " marching " that " keeps upping the sonic ante " . In a mixed review , John Watt from Drowned in Sound described the track as a " weird Brit @-@ rock stomp " which " fails to resonate " .

 = = Live performances = =

Ashley Zimmerman from the New Times Broward @-@ Palm Beach felt that " everyone got even more amped " as the band performed songs like " Conquistador " , while Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic deemed it a highlight of the show .

 Brothers Kim Hyun @-@ jun ( Lee Byung @-@ hun ) and Jin Sa @-@ woo ( Jung Joon @-@ ho ) , were training under the South Korean army 's 707th Special Mission Battalion until they were scouted by NSS ( National Security Service ) . The duo was independently scouted by the beautiful NSS agent , Choi Seung @-@ hee ( Kim Tae @-@ hee ) ; the two didn 't realize they have fallen for the same woman and continued to win her love . Unaware they have been scouted , the two were secretly captured and subjected through a simulated torture test and the duo passed their test to be worthy NSS agents . 
 After completing the test , Hyun @-@ jun and Sa @-@ woo were introduced to the director of the NSS , Baek San ( Kim Yeong @-@ cheol ) . Baek San explained to them that the NSS is a secret organization tasked with preempting foreign threats and protecting the country 's interests through <unk> operations , including assassination of anyone who could be a threat to South Korean ( SK ) national security . Since its founding in 1976 , during the rule of Park Chung @-@ hee , the agency 's very existence has remained a state secret from everyone , including the President . 
 After entering NSS , the pair learned that Seung @-@ hee was their undercover scout agent . While the duo was surprised and somewhat hurt , Hyun @-@ jun was angered the most as he felt his heart was toyed with ; during a team celebration dinner , Hyun @-@ jun confronted her alone and the two embraced the passion they have for one another . Afterwards , the two maintained a secret romantic relationship without the knowledge of anyone . 
 Hyun @-@ jun and Seung @-@ hee took the opportunity to secretly fly off to Akita @-@ Japan for a romantic winter escape after saving the life of SK President Cho Myung @-@ ho ( Lee Jung @-@ gil ) ; Baek San seized opportunity to reveal NSS to the president to gain his support . While vacationing , the couple befriended a young teen , Yuki ( who was smitten with Hyun @-@ jun at first sight ) . However , their vacation was cut short after being recalled back by NSS for a life @-@ changing mission at Budapest : recovering the head NK nuclear scientist , Hong Seung @-@ ryong . 
 At Budapest , Sa @-@ woo catches up with Hyun @-@ jun and Seung @-@ hee to extract Hong Seung @-@ ryong back to SK ; Sa @-@ woo learned of their romantic relationship and pretended to be happy for them . Unfortunately , Hong Seung @-@ ryong was killed along with his handlers by IRIS Agent , Vic . Afterwards , Baek San ( who is secretly an IRIS agent ) tricked Hyun @-@ jun by having him assassinate North Korean Minister Yoon . 
 Hyun @-@ jun successfully killed NK Minister Yoon and was on the run . NK agents , Seon @-@ hwa and Cheol @-@ young , hunted for Hyun @-@ jun as he escaped . Wounded , Hyun @-@ jun escaped capture and tried to get help , but Baek San betrayed him by manipulating Sa @-@ woo to silence him ; he escaped capture and after reunited with Seung @-@ hee . The couple agreed to run away together , but both thought each other had been killed by the enemy ( Seung @-@ hee by car bomb and Hyun @-@ jun by crashed plane ) . Because of their failure to capture Hyun @-@ jun , NK agent , Seon @-@ hwa , was stripped of her title and jailed . 
 Both Hyun @-@ jun and Seung @-@ hee survived their ordeal . Hyun @-@ jun was rescued by Jeong @-@ hoon ( a friend of Hyun @-@ jun 's deceased parents and revealed Baek San murdered them ) . Seung @-@ hee refused to accept Hyun @-@ jun 's death , but Sa @-@ woo convinced her he is dead . Jeong @-@ hoon warned Hyun @-@ jun of a war profiteering organization known as IRIS , a force that had long existed to create political turmoil to profit from a country 's strife and his counter @-@ agency that opposes them . Not willing to help a stranger , he escaped to Akita @-@ Japan to investigate . 
 NK intelligence later found out Hyun @-@ jun lives and gave Seon @-@ hwa a final chance to kill Hyun @-@ jun for redemption . Seon @-@ hwa failed and was captured by Hyun @-@ jun ; he gave mercy and even offered his life to her after he completes his quest for vengeance . Seon @-@ hwa believed him and eventually integrated herself with Yuki 's family as well . Over time , Seon @-@ hwa falls in love with him . The two eventually make their way back to Korea after an unfortunate scuffle with Vic that lead to Yuki and her family 's death . Hyun @-@ jun defects and cooperates with a NK black @-@ ops team to get his revenge on Baek San . 
 Not long , Baek San and Sa @-@ woo ( manipulated into working for IRIS ) found Jeong @-@ hoon . They used NSS resources to track him down . Before Jeong @-@ hoon died , he activated a video feed to record his final moments for Hyun @-@ jun ( via cell phone video ) to see . The video was meant to be part evidence and also a clue for Hyun @-@ jun to continue his mission ; the clue led him to meet President Cho Myung @-@ ho once again . In a private meeting , Hyun @-@ jun finally had a chance to explain his side of the story and that he is now a double @-@ agent between both sides to stop a nuclear plot ( by IRIS ) from happening . 
 Around the same time , Cheol @-@ young , discovered his own commanding officer , Gi @-@ hoon , is part of a coup with IRIS to start a civil war and take control both sides of Korea under their unified control . Hyun @-@ jun and Seon @-@ hwa teams up with the very black @-@ ops team that 's in charge of nuking South Korea . Because he 's not trusted , Hyun @-@ jun helped the team infiltrate and attack NSS HQ to steal special equipment to complete building their nuke . However , their actions wasn 't enough to earn the team 's trust as they had their own agendas and the team went ahead with their plans without Hyun @-@ jun and Seon @-@ hwa . 
 It was between this time that Hyun @-@ jun finally reunited with Seung @-@ hee and learned what really happened at Budapest , including Sa @-@ woo 's actions . It was also the first time she learned about IRIS , however , there wasn 't enough time to explain things as NSS agents are after them . Seung @-@ hee confronts Sa @-@ woo with the truth and told him she 'll never forgive his actions against Hyun @-@ jun . 
 Impatient of allowing IRIS to act any further through NSS , President Cho Myung @-@ ho had Head of National Security , Yoo Kwang @-@ ho , execute a hostile takeover on NSS ; both Sa @-@ woo and Baek San were arrested for conspiracy . Later , on the president 's official announcement of reunification , Hyun @-@ jun and Seon @-@ hwa searched for the hidden nuke . During this time , Cheol @-@ young successfully rooted out IRIS agents within North Korean ranks ; through arrested confessions , he reported to the duo that IRIS had targeted the Federal Building Complex , the U.S. Embassy , and the Blue House . While searching throughout Seoul , Hyun @-@ jun realized the notes they found earlier corresponded to a particular bus route and figured out the nuke was within a moving tour bus . However , their former NK black @-@ ops teammates tried to stop them in a massive gunfight to lead to their deaths ; Hyun @-@ jun saved the day . With the nuke neutralized and all enemy forces killed , the SK president thanked Hyun @-@ jun in his efforts and earned his complete faith . 
 Peace had finally come and Hyun @-@ jun took time off . Afterwards , Hyun @-@ jun took the time to bid farewell to Seon @-@ hwa . Even though Hyun @-@ jun got presidential permission to allow Seon @-@ hwa live in SK ; due to her unrequited love for Hyun @-@ jun , she declined and returned to NK . Seon @-@ hwa wanted to retire from being an agent ; she would quickly return to SK with the Cheol @-@ young when she realized Seung @-@ hee 's profile was within a discovered IRIS personnel database and wanted to warn Hyun @-@ jun of the potential danger . 
 Meanwhile , Hyun @-@ jun went to Jeju Island to vacation with Seung @-@ hee , but inexplicably left without notice . Hyun @-@ jun couldn 't find her as he was called back to Seoul due to the IRIS jailbreak with Sa @-@ woo and Baek San . She would later confess that she met with Baek San as he tried to recruit her into IRIS . She explained that Baek San helped raise her like a daughter and she didn 't want to talk about it due to personal conflicts within herself ; Hyun @-@ jun sympathized and forgave her . 
 In the hunt for Baek San , Hyun @-@ jun found and killed Vic ; he avenged Yuki 's death . Clues left behind suggests that IRIS had hidden themselves within private golf club house ; Hyun @-@ jun infiltrated and attacked the golf club house with an NSS team to arrest Baek San and Sa @-@ woo , but Sa @-@ woo escaped . When Hyun @-@ jun and Baek San finally meet , Hyun @-@ jun demanded Baek San to ask for forgiveness , but Baek San couldn 't help laugh at the matter . Hyun @-@ jun was tempted to kill Baek San , but Hyun @-@ jun had him arrested . 
 Later , Sa @-@ woo and IRIS agents attacked a local mall for hostages to blackmail both sides of the Korean government to release their IRIS agents and to make SK 's president announce their political stand to not unite with NK . Hyun @-@ jun became the negotiator for the president and for the hostages ' release , but he was really there to appeal to Sa @-@ woo 's conscience . Because the IRIS agents had conflicting commands with Sa @-@ woo , Hyun @-@ jun and Sa @-@ woo were forced to team up again and kill all the IRIS agents . During the gun @-@ fight , Sa @-@ woo was mortally wounded . Dying before his friends , he apologized and was forgiven before he died . With all things hindering the reunification process gone , the peace talks resumed . 
 At the reunification summit , the president personally requested Hyun @-@ jun to be at his side . Concurrently , NSS agents realized they 've been duped : the presumed dead IRIS agents at the mall crisis was actually the hostages . The true IRIS agents escaped and infiltrated the summit to kill all delegates . IRIS agents killed and replaced various security agents for a massacre . Unfortunately , it failed with Seung @-@ hee 's interference . She pretended to be an IRIS agent and used the confusion to stop them . This created mass panic as IRIS agents make their stand against all security forces . Ultimately , the SK president and NK forces survived the assault and Hyun @-@ jun saved the day again . 
 In the aftermath , Hyun @-@ jun and Seung @-@ hee left NSS for a normal life . While Seung @-@ hee waited at a lighthouse for Hyun @-@ jun , he was driving up to meet her and propose . However , during the drive , Hyun @-@ jun was sniped in the head by IRIS Agent Ray ( from IRIS II ) . Afterwards , Hyun @-@ jun ’ s life and death were later classified , Baek San was sent to a “ black prison , ” and IRIS receded for three years until they regained their strength to take on the world once again .

 = = = = National Security Service ( NSS ) = = = = 
 The NSS is headed by Baek San ( Kim Yeong @-@ cheol ) , its standing deputy director only in title and the man responsible for the recruiting of Hyun @-@ jun and Sa @-@ woo . The named director of the NSS comes and goes with each change of power in the presidency , but it is the deputy director that oversees the organization . Baek San 's motivations for many of his actions are mysterious , occasionally outright inconsistent with that of the general national interests . Due to the very existence of the organization being kept secret , he enjoys a state of personal protection that few others do . 
 While Baek San oversees the organization , the acting chief director , Park Sang @-@ hyun ( Yoon Je @-@ moon ) , is the general supervisor and runs the daily operations of the NSS . He fabricated the understanding but also intransigent where failures are concerned , often personally dealing with each and every agent . For field assignments , he watches over and commands all missions set domestically . 
 Many of the NSS agents have close personal ties to one another , and the floor supervisor and head of security resources , Yang Jung @-@ in ( Kim Hye @-@ jin ) , is no exception . She is often viewed as a dependable and accommodating authority figure and remains a very close friend to colleague Choi Seung @-@ hee . 
 Being the South 's first line of defense against foreign threats , the NSS houses technology unavailable to their sister intelligence agencies . The two primary tech agents , Yang Mi @-@ jung ( Juni ) and Hwang Tae @-@ sung ( Na Yoon ) , are often responsible for ensuring field agents have all that is required to see their missions through . Mi @-@ jung does not meet the expected conventions of someone involved in national intelligence . Given that her sense of fashion and general interests are more contemporary than that of her associates , she often stands out from the others , but her status as the top hacker in Korea has made her irreplaceable . Still , Tae @-@ sung remains the more <unk> of the two and is often instrumental in the success of a number of operations . 
 The forensics and scientific investigations section is headed by Oh Hyun @-@ ku ( Yoon Joo @-@ sang ) , an eccentric that is the eldest of the general staff . He often exhibits a fatherly relationship with many of the agents , including Mi @-@ jung and Seung @-@ hee . 
 = = = = The Blue House = = = = 
 Due to the overarching plot of the series involving the disputes inherent to the Korean Peninsula and the intricacies of the foreign relations between the North and South , the Blue House and its primary staff are featured prominently throughout . The candidate that wins the election and assumes office is eventual President of South Korea Cho Myung @-@ ho ( Lee Jung @-@ gil ) . His administration begins with his undertaking the grand task of forwarding talks of reunification between the North and South after witnessing the grim reality that is the struggle between the two nations . With strong ambitions , he leads diplomatic <unk> with the North that no one expected of a candidate so early in his term . 
 President Cho 's chief advisor and head of his cabinet is Jung <unk> @-@ jun ( Jung Han @-@ yong ) , and is one of the few around him that the president feels he can trust with any information , no matter how sensitive it may be . Later in the series , he becomes the only reliable lifeline the president has against the influence of sabotage originating inside and outside the Blue House . 
 The secretary to the president , Hong Soo @-@ jin ( Myung Ji @-@ <unk> ) , tends to find herself at odds with the head of the his chief advisor . She rarely speaks her mind freely and appears to have allegiances beyond those that are already apparent .

 Given the wide range of countries the characters find themselves in throughout the story , a number of recurring characters arise from countries outside of Korea . 
 Early in the series , Hyun @-@ jun and Seung @-@ hee encounter a young Japanese schoolgirl while in Akita by the name of Yuki ( Karen <unk> ) . Her family operates one of the tourist traps nearby , and she exhibits affection for Hyun @-@ jun and attempts to find herself in his company as much as possible . Later , it is Hyun @-@ jun that needs her , as Yuki and her family help him when he needs them most . 
 When Hyun @-@ jun finds himself tangled in a political web while in Japan , he crosses paths with Eriko Sato ( Yoo Min ) . A Japanese woman with the country 's national intelligence agency , Sato is charged with investigating foreign threats that find themselves on Japanese soil .

 Based on the general concept of the 1999 film Shiri , Iris was first revealed in 2008 by its production company Taewon Entertainment and attracted wide attention due to its record budget and star power . Kang Je @-@ gyu , the director of Shiri , was involved with initially developing the project for television , which would later be directed by Kim Kyu @-@ tae and Yang Yun @-@ ho . 
 Written by Kim Hyun @-@ jun , Jo Gyu @-@ won , and Kim Jae @-@ un , the series began pre @-@ production without the backing of a Korean broadcaster in an attempt to spark a bidding war amongst potential suitors . 
 On April 18 , 2008 , it was announced that Lee Byung @-@ hun had been cast in the lead role . It was to be Lee 's first television role since 2003 after a five @-@ year hiatus to focus on film roles , including the 2009 film G.I. Joe : The Rise of Cobra , which had been filming at the time of the announcement . Lee 's salary was the third highest in the history of Korean television dramas , amounting to ₩ 100 million ( $ 90 @,@ 000 USD ) per episode and was six times greater than that of the Korean industry guideline . His salary was inclusive of an overhead deal of ₩ 1 @.@ 5 billion won ( $ 1 @.@ 35 million USD ) in guarantees due to his namesake drawing potential investors , particularly in Japan , and opportunities in other overseas markets . 
 The production company announced on June 24 that Big Bang member T.O.P would be starring alongside Lee as an assassin and the recurring antagonist of the series . It was announced on October 10 that Kim Tae @-@ hee , known for her roles in Forbidden Love and Stairway to Heaven , had been cast as the female lead in the series . Like Lee , she had not worked in television for several years and had been working in film prior to accepting the role . 
 Pre @-@ production continued on Iris as it drew increasing attention not only in Korea but also in Japan due to Lee 's involvement . Kim Seung @-@ woo and Jung Joon @-@ ho were also cast as the head of the North Korean security team and Kim Hyun @-@ jun 's lifelong friend , respectively . 
 The large budget and notable talent for the project made it difficult for the production company to secure directors willing to take on the series , causing 2009 to begin with a brief stir of media attention . Shortly thereafter , Taewon announced that the search was over and Kim Kyu @-@ tae and Yang Yun @-@ ho would be helming the series . Simultaneously , KBS was announced as the South Korean broadcaster . Later in the month , on February 19 , Kim So @-@ yeon was cast as a North Korean agent .

 The first filmed scenes of Iris were shot in Akita , Japan on March 10 , 2009 . Lee Byung @-@ hun 's popularity in Japan caused the series and its production to gain immediate notability in the country . Lee 's filming was often shadowed by fans , beginning with thousands greeting him at Akita Airport upon his arrival . Due to several pivotal moments of the series being filmed in the prefecture , Akita soon experienced a surge of Korean tourists going on tours tailored to followers of the show . The crew went on to shoot in Japan for three weeks and left the country on March 28 . 
 With its unprecedented budget , Iris was able to pioneer several firsts for Korean television dramas , particularly with its large scale action sequences . Throughout filming , the actors were often responsible for filming their own stunts and action sequences , including Lee Byung @-@ hun jumping from the 130 meter @-@ tall Tamagawa Dam in <unk> , Akita . To prepare for the demanding physical requirements of the series , several members of the primary cast , including Kim Tae @-@ hee , underwent special training to lend authenticity to the action . During a break in filming , Lee Byung @-@ hun appeared at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival in support of the production in May . A press conference was also held later in the month with the entire finalized cast of the series . 
 The following international shoot commence on June 9 in Hungary . Shot in and around Budapest and other locales , the filming lasted for one month before the cast and crew returned to Korea . In late July , it was announced that Iris would air on Wednesdays and Thursdays on <unk> , for premiere on October 14 . Filming continued throughout the year and , on October 5 , a production press conference was held for the Korean and world media just over a week prior to the series premiere . 
 Filming continue after the premiere of the series . On November 29 , 2009 , the filming crew took over a section of <unk> @-@ ro at <unk> Plaza , Seoul for twelve hours to film lengthy gunfight scenes . The five lanes along the plaza in front of the <unk> Center for the Performing Arts were closed to traffic for filming from 07 : 00 to 19 : 00 . This marks the first time the Seoul Metropolitan Government has granted permission to blocked traffic along the Plaza for filming and it is part of Government 's plans to promote the city 's major tourist attractions .

 Iris premiered on October 14 , 2009 to strong ratings and went on to become one of the most critically and commercially successful series of the year , earning numerous awards for its actors and production . 
 The series ended its initial run on December 17 , 2009 . KBS announced that an Iris special would be aired the following week , on December 22 . The special contained extensive behind @-@ the @-@ scenes footage from the filming in Hungary , Japan , and Korea , along with numerous interviews with the cast and crew . 
 On January 28 , 2010 , it was reported that the distribution rights for the Japanese market were purchased by TBS for a record 400 million yen ( $ 4 @.@ 2 million USD ) . The station began airing the Japanese @-@ dubbed version during primetime — a first for a South Korean @-@ produced drama series in the country — on April 21 , 2010 with numerous acting talents providing the voiceovers , including Tatsuya Fujiwara as Kim Hyun @-@ jun . The two @-@ hour premiere drew TBS 's highest ratings for the day and doubled the station 's usual average for the timeslot . The airing had been preceded by a promotional blitz with stars Lee Byung @-@ hun and Kim Tae @-@ hee appearing on numerous Japanese programs , in addition to billboards and posters being placed throughout Tokyo . 
 Publicity for Iris in Japan was strong from its premiere and beyond . In late May 2010 , a set of two concert events billed as dramatic live stage shows drew sold @-@ out crowds that amounted to over 60 @,@ 000 attendees . The concerts were a combination of live interviews with much of the primary cast , re @-@ enactments of pivotal scenes from the series , and performances by the musical acts featured in its soundtrack . Broadcaster TBS revealed in June 2010 that airings of the series on its satellite offerings had broken records daily , doubling the ratings of its previous programs . Such was the influence of the series that flights between Seoul and Akita that had been nearing decommission were revitalized as a result of mounting tourist interest . Due to the commerce generated for Akita prefecture as a result of Iris having filmed there , local governments in Japan began competing for interest from producers in order to solicit tourists with future installments of the series . 
 A producer with Taewon Entertainment , the production company behind Iris , was quoted on May 6 , 2010 as saying they were in negotiations toward exporting the series to American television for broadcast on a major network . The episode count would be reduced from the original twenty down to twelve and , should the deal go through , would mark the first time a South Korean @-@ produced drama program was aired on a major television network in the United States .

 = Black Isle 's Torn = 
 Black Isle 's Torn was a role @-@ playing video game developed for Windows by Black Isle Studios , announced on March 22 , 2001 and cancelled in July of that year . The game was to use a modified version of the SPECIAL role @-@ playing system , which had been implemented in the Fallout series . Developed on various editions of the Lithtech engine , Torn possessed features unseen in previous Black Isle Studios games , such as 3D graphics and real @-@ time camera movement . 
 In Torn , the player assumed the role of a wanderer , who was cursed to bring misfortune to people and places around it . Under a king 's orders , the player undertook quests to clarify a series of conflicting prophecies . Unlike several other Black Isle Studios games , the game was to take place in an original world titled " Torn " instead of a traditional Dungeons & Dragons location . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Torn was to use a modified version of the SPECIAL system ; combat occurred in quasi @-@ real @-@ time , rather than strictly being turn @-@ based . To achieve this , Black Isle Studios created the " recovery system " , in which action points were used to determine the amount a combatant could accomplish in a given amount of time . Action points were spent with each action , and based on what percentage of an acting character 's total action points were used , that character would need to wait a varying amount of time before taking action again . For example , if two characters expend half of their action points , they will attack each other at the same speed , regardless of the point totals for each character . Exceptions to this were to include recovery being hindered by movement , using items , or switching equipment , which was always allowed , though it reset the recovery time . 
 Like Fallout , the game was not to support character classes ; instead , the designers opted for a system where a player defined their character by the skills and special abilities selected when leveling up . For example , a character with skill choices of stealth and assassination would become the rough equivalent of a " rogue " . The system would have allowed players to choose their characters ' race , which would change the types of abilities selectable . 
 = = = Companions = = = 
 Torn was to allow the player direct control over only the protagonist character . However , up to five artificial intelligence @-@ controlled " companions " could be hired at once , and would have replaced a conventional adventuring party . Companions would have interacted with one another , obligating the player to find companions who worked well together . 
 Torn would have introduced a unique method for the player to communicate with and control allies ; altering their behaviour through conversation , and a command menu and hot key @-@ driven command system which allowed the player to give companions commands at any time . The system was based around the concept of simple behaviors , such as " Attack , " which could be combined into complex strings . Companions could be ordered to attack , support , defend themselves , follow the player character without attacking , and / or remain behind . It was also possible for the player to command them to carry these orders out in " aggressive " or " passive " manners . Lastly , commands and manners could be " leashed " to other party members or the player character ; for example , " support the entire party aggressively , " or " support another companion passively . " Depending on the playable character 's personality , and the orders companions were given , their level of co @-@ operation would vary . 
 Companions would have followed commands to the best of their ability , but in accordance with their personality ; for example , a berserker @-@ type companion told to attack aggressively would charge into melee combat , while an assassin @-@ type companion would attempt to hide , and then creep about knocking foes unconscious or backstabbing . In contrast , a priestess @-@ type companion might support the player character by casting beneficial spells , while a paladin @-@ type would give support by attacking the player character 's target , and then healing the protagonist after the battle or if he or she came close to dying . 
 While these features were publicized , Feargus Urquhart later stated that " even at the end of our work on Torn , we were still considering going back to a system that gave players direct , full control over the party members " . 
 = = = Magic system = = = 
 Torn was to contain four types of magic : Chaos , Order , Alchemy and Summoning . Order magic primarily consisted of healing , protective , and empowering spells . Conversely , Chaos magic was to have consisted of harmful elemental attacks , detrimental status afflictions , and invisibility spells . 
 Alchemical magic was used to create or alter potions to achieve more powerful effects , repair or enchant items , identify unknown items or creatures , and combine different Order or Chaos spells to create spells with multiple elements ( such as earth and fire spells creating a molten metal spell ) . Alchemical magic could also imbue a target with elemental attributes ; for example , a warrior imbued with the Water element would deal extra cold @-@ type damage but receive additional heat @-@ type damage . 
 Lastly , Summoning magic was to consist of " Call " and " Gate " spells , the former summoning entities able to exist for a set duration of time , or until slain . Summoned creatures behaved in different manners ; one type might simply defend the caster , while another worked to heal the caster and his or her allies . Gate spells opened a portal , allowing different things access to the game 's world . Lead designer David Maldonado called the resulting spells " generally amongst the weirdest in the game , " with the effect often being a combination of " normal " spells fired simultaneously . 
 Unlike Black Isle Studios ' previous games , Torn would have used a " mana point " system . Each spell cast would deplete mana points ; when fully depleted , a spell @-@ caster would have been unable to cast spells until their mana had been restored . Certain races were more adept at casting certain types of magic than others , increasing the importance of racial choice in how the player wished to experience the game . 
 = = Setting and plot = = 
 Torn 's background plot established an omnipotent being , dubbed " the Architect , " as the ultimate creator of the game 's universe . The Architect created a number of god @-@ like beings , who in turn created the world " Torn " . The gods eventually divided into three separate factions , each pursuing a different philosophy . One faction worshipped Chaos , believing in constant alteration of the world , while another worshipped Order , believing that all things should remain unchanged ; between these two was a third faction , which promoted balance between chaos and order . 
 The game 's various races were originally created for combat purposes by the three factions of gods , as the deities struggled to dominate Torn with their respective viewpoints . The name of the game 's world was to have been derived from this conflict , due to the ravaging of the world which took place . In the end , the Architect banished the feuding Chaos and Order factions to the ethereal realms of " nightmare " and " dream " , respectively , and left Torn in the hands of the faction that advocated balance . While isolated , the Order and Chaos factions continued influencing the world 's development , although their segregation forced them to act indirectly through agents still residing in Torn 's world . Resulting from the ability of Torn 's inhabitants to draw energy from the separate realms occupied by the gods of Chaos and Order , magic became available . 
 Black Isle Studios stated on multiple occasions that their goal was to create a world that was both familiar to role @-@ playing game fans , while simultaneously new . David Maldonado once commented on this in an interview with IGN : 
 " I feel that a sense of familiarity and association is a powerful thing , and may be used to heighten a player 's emotional experience in the game . If something can be tied into existing imagery ( even if only subtly so ) and be enhanced by or play off of pre @-@ existing feelings and conceptions within the player , why throw away that extra bit of power at your disposal ? " 
 Later in the interview , Maldonado explained how the world of Torn came about : 
 " I was given a set of directives by Feargus Urquhart , Black Isle Studios ' division head . He was clear that he would encourage the sort of mature , gritty setting that we used in Fallout or Planescape : Torment , but didn 't want a world that was simply " covered in darkness " ... there should places of light , darkness , and a whole lot o ' gray in between . He also wanted some sort of clear , over @-@ arching conflict that influenced all things on some level but didn 't simply overpower everything . We decided on Order vs. Chaos as it 's far less black and white than Good vs. Evil ... after all , agents of Order or Chaos could potentially use any means at their disposal to bring about the rise of their cause , meaning that either side has its share of goodies and baddies . " 
 To this end , the game 's plot was to contain a splinter group of Order followers who would scheme to destroy the entire world , in order to re @-@ create it as a new , unblemished one , so as to achieve " ultimate order . " 
 Torn 's primary narrative revolved around a wandering protagonist character , cursed to bring pain and misfortune wherever he or she traveled , and to whomever he or she traveled with . A misguided king , later revealed to be the game 's ultimate antagonist , would have acted as the player 's benefactor , assigning them various quests in order to discover the truth about a series of apparently conflicting prophecies . It would eventually have been revealed that all the prophecies , and even the <unk> character 's mysterious curse , could be rationalized , and were in fact related to the protagonist character , effectively granting the player control over which interpretation of the future was realized . 
 = = Development = = 
 Announced during GDC 2001 , Torn was subject to much interest by the press , because the team behind the cult classic Planescape : Torment was revealed to be developing it , and the game itself was to use the much @-@ praised SPECIAL system . According to lead designer David Maldonado , the game had been in development for " about fourteen months " before its announcement . 
 Torn made a playable showing at E3 2001 . Although the preview was an early build of the game with several graphical features disabled , it was generally well received . However , the division director of Black Isle Studios , Feargus Urquhart , later stated that the switch from the LithTech 2 @.@ 3 engine to the upgraded 3 @.@ 0 version shortly before the E3 presentation had " significant ramifications " , and the amount of changing and recoding necessitated by the switch caused the game 's E3 showing to suffer . 
 In July 2001 , after circulation of rumors , Torn was officially cancelled . Following the incident , fifty @-@ six members of Black Isle Studios ' staff were laid off . The ultimate reason for Torn 's cancellation was eventually revealed by Feargus Urquhart : 
 " I don 't know if we ever released an official reason on why [ Torn ] was canceled , but in a nutshell , the game was canceled because it was not going to be done in time to get Interplay the revenue the company needed to continue operations . That sounds like it was all Interplay 's fault , but that 's really not the case . The project was not going well and continued to be an ongoing challenge . " 
 At least a few other members of the development team contested this appraisal off the record , however , and management issues as well as unreasonable expectations for another Baldur 's Gate @-@ style hit have been mentioned . 
 = Joseph Desha = 
 Joseph Desha ( December 9 , 1768 – October 11 , 1842 ) was a U.S. Representative and the ninth governor of the U.S. state of Kentucky . After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes , Desha 's Huguenot ancestors fled from France to Pennsylvania , where Desha was born . Eventually , Desha 's family settled near present @-@ day Gallatin , Tennessee , where they were involved in many skirmishes with the Indians . Two of Desha 's brothers were killed in these encounters , motivating him to volunteer for " Mad " Anthony Wayne 's campaign against the Indians during the Northwest Indian War . Having by then resettled in Mason County , Kentucky , Desha parlayed his military record into several terms in the state legislature . 
 In 1807 , Desha was elected to the first of six consecutive terms in the U.S. House of Representatives . A Democratic @-@ Republican , he was considered a war hawk , supporting the War of 1812 . In 1813 , he volunteered to serve in the war and commanded a division at the Battle of the Thames . Returning to Congress after the war , he was the only member of the Kentucky congressional delegation to oppose the unpopular Compensation Act of 1816 . Nearly every other member of the delegation was defeated for reelection after the vote , but Desha 's opposition to the act helped him retain his seat . He did not seek reelection in 1818 , and made an unsuccessful run for governor in 1820 , losing to John Adair . By 1824 , the Panic of 1819 had ruined Kentucky 's economy , and Desha made a second campaign for the governorship almost exclusively on promises of relief for the state 's large debtor class . He was elected by a large majority , and debt relief partisans captured both houses of the General Assembly . After the Kentucky Court of Appeals overturned debt relief laws favored by Desha and the majority of the legislature , the legislators abolished the court and created a replacement court , to which Desha appointed several debt relief partisans . The existing court refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the move , and during a period known as the Old Court – New Court controversy , two courts of last resort existed in the state . 
 Although popular when elected , Desha 's reputation was damaged by two controversies during his term . The first was his role in the ouster of Horace Holley as president of Transylvania University . While the religious conservatives on the university 's board opposed Holley because they considered him too liberal , Desha 's opposition was primarily based on Holley 's friendship with Henry Clay , one of Desha 's political enemies . After Desha bitterly denounced Holley in an address to the legislature in late 1825 , Holley resigned . Desha 's reputation took a further hit after his son , Isaac , was charged with murder . Partially because of Desha 's influence as governor , two guilty verdicts were overturned . After the younger Desha unsuccessfully attempted suicide while awaiting a third trial , Governor Desha issued a pardon for his son . These controversies , along with an improving economy , propelled Desha 's political foes to victory in the legislative elections of 1825 and 1826 . They abolished the so @-@ called " Desha court " over Desha 's veto , ending the court controversy . In a final act of defiance , Desha threatened to refuse to vacate the governor 's mansion , although he ultimately acquiesced without incident , ceding the governorship to his successor , National Republican Thomas Metcalfe . At the expiration of his term , he retired from public life and ultimately died at his son 's home in Georgetown , Kentucky , on October 11 , 1842 . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Joseph Desha was born to Robert and Eleanor ( Wheeler ) Desha in Monroe County , Pennsylvania , on December 9 , 1768 . He was of part French Huguenot ancestry , and his ancestors had fled from France to Pennsylvania after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes , which had largely protected the Huguenots from religious persecution . He obtained a limited education in the state 's rural schools . In July 1781 , Desha 's family relocated to Fayette County , Kentucky , and the following year , they settled in what was then known as Cumberland district near the present @-@ day city of Gallatin , Tennessee . Desha 's younger brother , Robert , would later represent Tennessee in the U.S. House of Representatives . 
 Like most frontier settlers , the Desha family frequently found themselves in conflict with American Indians after moving to Tennessee , and between the ages of 15 and 22 , Joseph Desha volunteered in several military campaigns against them . In one such campaign , two of his brothers were killed while fighting alongside him . Following the war , Desha lived with William Whitley in the town of Crab Orchard , Kentucky . He married Margaret " Peggy " Bledsoe in December 1789 . The couple had thirteen children over the course of their marriage . In 1792 , the family moved to Mason County , Kentucky , where Desha worked as a farmer . In 1794 , he served in the Northwest Indian War under Lieutenant William Henry Harrison . He participated in General " Mad " Anthony Wayne 's rout of the Indians at the August 20 Battle of Fallen Timbers . 
 Desha entered politics in 1797 , when he was elected as a Democratic @-@ Republican to the Kentucky House of Representatives . When the House debated the Kentucky Resolutions in 1798 , he chaired the Committee of the Whole . He again served in the House from 1799 to 1802 , and was elected to the Kentucky Senate from 1802 to 1807 . Concurrent with his legislative career , he continued to serve in the state militia . On January 23 , 1798 , he was appointed as a major in the 29th Regiment . He was promoted to colonel on March 23 , 1799 , and on September 5 , 1805 , he was promoted to brigadier general and given command of the 7th Brigade of the Kentucky Militia . On December 24 , 1806 , he was made a major general , remaining with the 7th Brigade . 
 = = Service in the House and the War of 1812 = = 
 Desha was elected without opposition to the first of six consecutive terms in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1807 . Though he was known as a capable orator , he did not speak often , claiming it was best " to think much and speak but little . " He opposed renewing the charter of the First Bank of the United States because most of the bank 's investors were foreigners . Specifically , he was concerned about the fact King George III of Great Britain was a major shareholder . ( It was thought by many that the British monarch was on the verge of madness at this time . ) The bank 's charter ultimately was not renewed in 1811 . 
 Early in his career , Desha advocated an adequate army to defend American territory from Great Britain and France . He supported President Thomas Jefferson 's Embargo Act of 1807 and related enforcement legislation . He was considered a war hawk , and House Speaker Henry Clay , a fellow Kentuckian and leader of the War Hawks in the House , selected him to serve on the House Foreign Relations Committee during the Twelfth Congress ( 1811 – 13 ) . Consistent with Clay 's expectations , Desha consistently supported the war measures brought before the House , including bills to arm merchant ships , increase the number of regular troops in U.S. Army , and authorize President James Madison to accept volunteer units for military service . Proclaiming his dissatisfaction with Macon 's Bill Number 1 , he maintained that all embargoes and sanctions would fail as long as " the British have a Canada or a Nova Scotia on the continent of America " , although he acknowledged the high cost in both money and lives that annexation of Canada would entail . On June 4 , 1812 , he voted in favor of a declaration of war on Great Britain , officially beginning the War of 1812 . 
 Desha returned to Kentucky after the congressional session . He responded to Governor Isaac Shelby 's call for volunteers to serve in William Henry Harrison 's campaign into Upper Canada . He was commissioned a major general and given command of the 2nd Division of Kentucky militia . The 3 @,@ 500 @-@ man division , composed of the 2nd and 5th Brigades and the 11th Regiment , assembled on the Ohio River at Newport , Kentucky . They joined Harrison in forcing the British retreat from Detroit and held the Indian allies of the British off his left flank during the American victory at the Battle of the Thames on October 5 , 1813 . According to historian Bennett H. Young , Desha 's old friend William Whitley had a premonition of his own death the night before the battle and gave his rifle and <unk> to Desha , asking him to convey it to his widow , along with a message of his affection . Whitley was indeed killed in the fighting the following day . 
 Desha resumed his service in Congress at its next term . He was disappointed at the decision not to pursue the annexation of Upper Canada and to ignore British impressment of American mariners in favor of pursuing peace with the British . Ultimately , he was dissatisfied with the Treaty of Ghent that ended the war . When William Henry Harrison was being considered by Congress for the position of general @-@ in @-@ chief in late 1813 and early 1814 , Desha opposed giving him the title because he claimed that Harrison had determined not to pursue British General Henry Procter following the Battle of the Thames and had only done so after strenuous urging by Isaac Shelby . Desha 's charge was a contributing factor in Congress 's decision to remove Harrison 's name from a resolution of thanks for service in the Northwest Army and withhold from him a Congressional Gold Medal . Both Harrison and Shelby denied Desha 's account , and as the issue began to damage Desha 's reelection chances , he partially recanted his story . He claimed that he had only told some friends that Harrison was wary of pursuit during a council of war held at Sandwich , Ontario , after the battle , but that he had not personally witnessed a disagreement over the pursuit between Harrison and Shelby . 
 Desha gradually became more conservative after his return to the House , consistently resisting expansion of the U.S. Navy . He also opposed Secretary of War James Monroe 's request to maintain a standing peacetime army of 20 @,@ 000 men . Desha argued that a large standing army provided the advocates of a larger federal government with an excuse to increase taxes , and proposed that the standing army should consist of only 6 @,@ 000 men . A coalition of Federalists and conservative Democratic @-@ Republicans in the House united to adopt Desha 's suggestion by a vote of 75 – 65 . The version of the bill passed by the Senate , however , required a standing army of 15 @,@ 000 men . The legislation was referred to a conference committee , which ultimately adopted a compromise of 10 @,@ 000 men . 
 During the Fourteenth Congress ( 1815 – 17 ) , he was the only member of the twelve @-@ member Kentucky congressional delegation to oppose the Compensation Act of 1816 . The act , sponsored by fellow Kentuckian Richard Mentor Johnson , modified congressional compensation , paying each member a flat salary of $ 1 @,@ 500 a year instead of a $ 6 per diem while Congress was in session . The measure proved extremely unpopular with the electorate . Every member of the Kentucky delegation that voted for the bill – excepting Johnson and Henry Clay , who were both extremely popular – lost his congressional seat , either because he did not seek reelection or because he was defeated by another candidate . 
 Desha served as chairman of the Committee on Public Expenditures during the Fifteenth Congress ( 1817 – 19 ) . On March 14 , 1818 , he voted with the minority against a resolution introduced by South Carolina 's William Lowndes asserting Congress 's power to appropriate federal funds for the construction of internal improvements . He did not run for reelection in 1818 . 
 = = Gubernatorial election of 1820 = = 
 Desha was one of four candidates who sought the governorship of Kentucky in 1820 . In the aftermath of the Panic of 1819 – the first major financial crisis in United States history – the primary issue of the campaign was debt relief . Sitting governor Gabriel Slaughter had lobbied for some measures favored by the state 's large debtor class , particularly punitive taxes against the branches of the Second Bank of the United States in Louisville and Lexington . The Second Party System had not yet developed , but there were nonetheless two opposing factions that arose around the debt relief issue . The first – primarily composed of land speculators who had bought large land parcels on credit and were unable to repay their debts due to the financial crisis – was dubbed the Relief Party or faction and favored more legislation favorable to debtors . Opposed to them was the Anti @-@ Relief Party or faction ; it was composed primarily of the state 's aristocracy , many of whom were creditors to the land speculators and demanded that their contracts be adhered to without interference from the government . They claimed that no government intervention could effectively aid the debtors and that attempts to do so would only prolong the economic depression . 
 Although Desha was clearly aligned with the Relief faction , the faction 's leader was John Adair , a veteran of the War of 1812 whose popularity was augmented because of his very public defense of the Kentuckians who served under him at the Battle of New Orleans against charges of cowardice by Andrew Jackson . Adair won a close election with 20 @,@ 493 votes , besting William Logan 's 19 @,@ 947 votes , Desha 's 12 @,@ 418 votes , and Anthony Butler 's 9 @,@ 567 votes . Relief partisans also secured control of both houses of the Kentucky General Assembly . Much debt relief legislation was passed during Adair 's term , but as his term neared expiration , the Kentucky Court of Appeals struck down one popular and expansive debt relief law as unconstitutional , ensuring that debt relief would again be the central issue in the upcoming gubernatorial election . 
 = = Gubernatorial election of 1824 = = 
 With Adair constitutionally ineligible to seek a second consecutive term , Desha was the first candidate to publicly declare his intention to seek the governorship in 1824 . He began his campaign in late 1823 and faced little opposition until Christopher Tompkins declared his candidacy in May 1824 . Tompkins was a little @-@ known judge from Bourbon County who vehemently held to the principles of the Anti @-@ Relief faction . Colonel William Russell , a military veteran of 50 years , also sought to carry the mantle of the Anti @-@ Relief faction . While not as eloquent or well @-@ versed in the faction 's rhetoric , he had few political enemies and his military career brought him great respect among the electorate . 
 While Tompkins and his supporters primarily campaigned through the state 's newspapers , most of which supported the Anti @-@ Relief faction , Desha traveled the state making stump speeches . Offering no specific platform , he focused exclusively on the idea that he opposed " judicial usurpation " and believed " all power belonged to the people " . He was generally acknowledged as the candidate of the Relief Party , but historian Arndt M. Stickles has noted that he used Anti @-@ Relief rhetoric in some counties . Desha attacked Tompkins ' record as a judge , claiming that he had consistently supported the Second Bank of the United States and the current Court of Appeals . This , Desha said , put him in direct and open opposition to the state 's farmers and ensured that , if he were elected , the state would be governed by the judicial branch , not the governor . Desha claimed the state 's newspapers persecuted him the same way the Anti @-@ Relief party persecuted debtors . He also charged that Tompkins was not the true choice of the Anti @-@ Relief party , but only gained its support by being the first candidate with that position to announce his candidacy . Backers of Russell , who consistently ran a distant third in voter support , agreed with this claim , saying Tompkins had joined the race before a date that had been previously agreed on among Anti @-@ Relief candidates , giving him an unfair advantage over Russell . 
 Anti @-@ Relief partisans opened many lines of attack against Desha . They said his refusal to articulate a specific campaign platform showed that he was trying to be all things to all people . They assailed his military record , claiming he had only volunteered for service in the War of 1812 after being promised command of a division , that he balked at fighting and discouraged General Harrison 's pursuit of the British and Indians , and that he billed excessive expenses to the government after his service . Desha 's legislative career was also subject to scrutiny and attack . Anti @-@ Relief partisans claimed that he had espoused certain positions for the sole purpose of pitting the state 's agrarian interests against its aristocracy . They charged that he had secretly favored the Compensation Act of 1816 and had worked to pass it , despite his vote against it . In contrast to his rhetoric in favor of a strong , well @-@ equipped army and navy , opponents claimed he had actually voted against increasing the military 's budget . As further evidence of his lack of trustworthiness , they pointed to his vote for William H. Crawford while serving as a presidential elector in 1816 , even though Kentuckians were nearly unanimous in their support of James Monroe . 
 Although Desha was universally acknowledged as the leading candidate during the early months of the campaign , as election day approached , some began to doubt whether he could withstand the withering attacks of the Anti @-@ Relief Party . The Frankfort Argus , a pro @-@ Desha newspaper , remained confident , however , predicting that the Relief candidate would win by a margin of 4 @-@ to @-@ 1 . On election day , Desha secured a comfortable victory , receiving 38 @,@ 378 votes , nearly 60 % of the votes cast , and carrying large majorities even in some strongly Anti @-@ Relief counties . Tompkins garnered 22 @,@ 499 votes , with his support concentrated mostly in Central Kentucky . Russell finished third with 3 @,@ 900 votes . Desha and his allies in the General Assembly interpreted the victory as a mandate from the voters to aggressively pursue their debt relief agenda . 
 = = Governor of Kentucky = = 
 On November 4 , 1824 , just months after the election , the state capitol building was destroyed by a fire . Some furnishings and records were saved , but the four @-@ year @-@ old building was a total loss . When Gilbert du Motier , Marquis de Lafayette toured the United States in 1825 , a new capitol had not yet been constructed and the governor 's mansion was too small to host a proper reception , so the governor had to entertain the dignitary at <unk> 's Tavern . 
 Desha 's major accomplishment as governor was in the area of internal improvements . In 1825 , he convinced the legislature to fund the creation of the Louisville and Portland Canal on the Falls of the Ohio . The canal opened in 1830 , and proved very profitable , so much so that Desha lamented the fact that the state had split the cost of the project – and consequently , its profits – with the federal government and private investors . He also urged state investment in a turnpike joining Maysville to Louisville via Lexington . He advocated using excess money earmarked for education to construct hard @-@ surfaced roads in the state , but the General Assembly was less responsive to this suggestion . 
 = = = Old Court – New Court controversy = = = 
 Kentucky historian Thomas D. Clark wrote that Desha " made rash promises to relieve the horde of bankrupt voters ... promises on which he had to deliver . " His first address to the legislature was critical of the judiciary in general , especially the Supreme Court 's recent decision in the case of Green v. Biddle which held that land claims granted by Virginia in the District of Kentucky prior to Kentucky becoming a separate state took precedence over those later granted by the state of Kentucky if the two were in conflict . Encouraged by Desha 's strong stance against the judiciary , Relief partisans set about removing the judges on the Court of Appeals who had earlier struck down their debt relief legislation . The first punitive measure proposed against the offending judges was to reduce their salaries to 25 cents per year , but this course was quickly abandoned . Next , legislators attempted to remove the judges by address , but they found they lacked the necessary two @-@ thirds majority in both houses to effect this removal . 
 Finally , on December 9 , 1824 , the Kentucky Senate passed a measure repealing the legislation that created the Kentucky Court of Appeals and establishing a new court of last resort in the state . The bill was sent to the House , and a vigorous debate ensued on December 23 . During the debate , which continued past midnight , Desha appeared on the floor of the chamber to lobby legislators to support the bill and actually moved the previous question to end debate , which was , in the words of Kentucky historian Lowell H. Harrison , a " flagrant violation of House rules " . The House passed the bill by a vote of 54 – 43 , and Desha signed it immediately . 
 On January 10 , 1825 , Desha appointed four justices to the new court . He chose his Secretary of State , former U.S. Senator William T. Barry , as chief justice . The other three members were Lexington lawyer James Haggin , Circuit Judge John Trimble ( brother of Supreme Court Justice Robert Trimble ) , and Benjamin Patton . Of the new court – called by detractors the " Desha court " – Barry " seems to have been the only one who had in a measure an even show in experience , prestige , and ability to rank as a jurist with the old @-@ court justices " , according to Stickles . Achilles Sneed , clerk of the Old Court , refused to surrender the court 's records to Francis P. Blair , clerk of the New Court , so Blair took the records from Sneed 's office by force , and Sneed was fined 10 pounds for contempt of court because of his refusal to cooperate . The Old Court continued to hear cases in a Frankfort church , while the New Court occupied the official court chambers . Neither recognized the other , and both claimed to be the legitimate court of last resort in the state . Most of the state 's lawyers and judges were supporters of the Old Court and continued to practice before them and abide by their mandates , but others chose to acknowledge the New Court as legitimate . 
 Although Desha and his entire administration campaigned on behalf of New Court candidates during the legislative elections of 1825 , Old Court supporters regained the state House and evenly split the Senate between Old and New Court supporters . Desha 's message to the newly reconstituted General Assembly remained critical of banks and the judiciary , but urged legislators to seek a compromise to resolve the court question . Stickles records that Desha was sincere in his desire for a compromise , albeit one that would save face for the New Court Party . He promised that , if the legislature would again authorize appointment of a new set of judges , he would appoint them equally from both parties . Another plan would have expanded the court to six judges , with three appointed from each party . One legislator proposed that all members of both courts resign , along with Desha , lieutenant governor Robert B. McAfee , and all the legislators in the General Assembly , essentially allowing the state government to reset itself . This bill passed the House but was killed in the Senate . The House passed a measure to restore the Old Court , but the Senate deadlocked on the measure and McAfee , the presiding officer in the Senate , cast the tie @-@ breaking vote to defeat it . 
 By 1826 , the economic climate in the state had improved significantly . Seeing the resultant upsurge in Old Court support , two of the four New Court justices resigned . Desha offered the appointments to three different individuals , all of whom ignored or rejected them . John Telemachus Johnson finally accepted the appointment in April 1826 , and the New Court met with only three justices during its 1826 term . In the August 1826 elections , the Old Court Party won majorities of 56 – 44 in the House and 22 – 16 in the Senate . Desha again encouraged the legislators to compromise to resolve the court impasse . The Old Court majorities in both houses , however , completely repudiated the New Court , passing a bill to restore the Old Court and overturn all legislation related to the New Court . Desha vetoed the bill , and scolded the legislators for passing a blatantly partisan bill as opposed to a compromise measure . The General Assembly overrode Desha 's veto on January 1 , 1827 . In a conciliatory move , the Senate confirmed Desha 's appointment of George M. Bibb , a New Court partisan , to a position on the re @-@ empowered Old Court after John Boyle resigned to accept a federal judgeship in November 1826 . 
 = = = Pardon of Isaac Desha = = = 
 Governor Desha 's reputation was further tarnished because of a pardon issued to his son . On November 2 , 1824 , Isaac B. Desha had brutally murdered Francis Baker , a Mississippian who was visiting Kentucky . On November 24 , 1824 , John Rowan , one of the governor 's allies in the General Assembly , introduced legislation ordering the Fleming County Circuit Court to convene a special session on January 17 , 1825 , for Isaac Desha 's trial and providing that the accused should have the option to request a change of venue to Harrison County at that time . Miles from the scene of the murder , Harrison County was the governor 's home county , and he possessed a great deal of influence with officials there . Governor Desha appeared before the legislative committee considering the bill on November 26 and asked that they report it favorably to the full legislature . This was done , and the bill was approved on December 4 , 1824 . 
 At his trial in December , Isaac Desha requested the change of venue ; the case was transferred to Harrison County and scheduled for early January . John Trimble was scheduled to hear the case , but Governor Desha appointed him to the New Court of Appeals following the " abolishment " of the Old Court in late 1824 . Trimble personally appealed to Judge George Shannon of Lexington to hear the case . Governor Desha assembled a formidable defense team for his son , including his newly appointed Secretary of State , William T. Barry ; John Rowan , who had just been elected to the U.S. Senate ; and former congressmen William Brown and T. P. <unk> . William K. Wall and future Congressman John Chambers – the Commonwealth 's Attorneys for Harrison and Fleming counties , respectively – collaborated with attorney Martin P. Marshall to prosecute the case . Governor Desha attended each day of the proceedings , seated with the defense counsel . 
 Despite the best efforts of his father to secure a favorable venue , judge , and defense team , on January 31 , 1825 , the jury convicted Isaac Desha of murder and sentenced him to hang . Rowan immediately requested a new trial upon grounds of jury interference , and Shannon granted the request on February 10 . Jury selection proved problematic , occupying at least parts of four terms of the Harrison County Circuit Court . In September 1825 , a jury was finally empaneled . The judge , Harry O. Brown , had been temporarily appointed to his position by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy . Desha was again found guilty , and sentenced to hang on July 14 , 1826 . Judge Brown overturned the verdict because the prosecution had not proven that the murder took place in Fleming County , as alleged in the indictment against Desha . The state argued that this was of no consequence , since a change of venue had already been granted , but the judge 's ruling stood , and Governor Desha 's reputation took a further hit . 
 In July 1826 , Isaac Desha , free on bail while awaiting a third trial and apparently in a highly intoxicated state , attempted suicide by cutting his own throat . Physicians saved his life by reconnecting his severed windpipe with a silver tube . He recovered , and in June 1827 , faced a third trial . During the June term of the court , Desha 's lawyers used a number of peremptory challenges to again prevent the court from <unk> a jury . The judge ordered him held without bail until the next session of the court , but Governor Desha , who was present at the proceedings , stood and issued a pardon for his son , as well as lambasting the judge in a lengthy impromptu speech . Some accounts hold that the governor immediately resigned upon granting the pardon , but the official records reflect no such action . 
 Following his release , Isaac Desha traveled to Texas under an alias , where he robbed and killed another man . He was identified based on family resemblance and the silver pipe that had earlier saved his life . After being arrested , he confessed to both murders . He died of a fever the day before his trial in August 1828 . 
 = = = Conflict with Horace Holley = = = 
 Another controversial issue during Desha 's tenure was his disdain for Horace Holley , president of Transylvania University . From the time Holley assumed the post of president in 1818 , the university had risen to national prominence and attracted well @-@ qualified and well @-@ respected faculty members such as Constantine Samuel Rafinesque , Daniel Drake , Charles Caldwell , William T. Barry , and Jesse Bledsoe . However , Holley 's New England Unitarian beliefs were too liberal for the tastes of many in Kentucky . Many called Holley an infidel and charged that he was a drinker and a gambler . He was criticized for spending time at the horse races and for furnishing his home with nude classical statues . 
 Desha was drawn into the Holley controversy during the 1824 presidential election . When no candidate achieved a majority of the electoral votes cast , the contest was resolved by the U.S. House of Representatives . Desha and the New Court partisans in the General Assembly instructed the state 's congressional delegation to cast their votes for Andrew Jackson , but the delegation , led by House Speaker Henry Clay , defied these instructions and voted instead for John Quincy Adams . Because of this vote , Clay , a trustee for Transylvania and supporter of Holley , became Desha 's political enemy . Desha 's hostility for Transylvania and Holley worsened when , in the aftermath of the Isaac Desha trial , a student at Transylvania delivered a speech critical of the governor in the university 's chapel . Although Holley was present for the speech , Transylvania historian John D. Wright , Jr. wrote that he did not know the student 's topic beforehand and after hearing the speech , made no effort to condone its content . It was Holley 's practice , however , to allow students to speak openly about current political matters , regardless of which position they took . Desha maintained that , because Holley had not silenced the student , he was at fault for tacitly condoning disrespectful criticism of the state 's chief executive . 
 Desha vehemently attacked Transylvania and Holley in his annual message to the General Assembly in November 1825 . He claimed that the university had not made wise use of the public funding allocated to it by previous Assemblies , noting in particular that Holley 's salary as president exceeded his own . Finally , Desha claimed that under Holley , Transylvania had become too elitist and could not be otherwise , given the high cost of attendance . Holley , who had traveled to Frankfort to speak with Desha and the legislature , was present for Desha 's speech . Afterward , he decided instead to return to Lexington and tender his resignation . Sympathetic members of the university 's board of trustees convinced Holley to remain for another year . Kentucky historian James C. Klotter opined that , with Holley 's departure , " perhaps the state 's best chance for a world @-@ class university had passed . " 
 = = = Gubernatorial legacy and transition = = = 
 The numerous controversies of Desha 's term severely damaged his reputation . Harrison recorded that a visitor to Kentucky remarked in 1825 , " [ Desha ] is said by some to possess talents ; I have never been furnished with evidence . " Harrison further noted that " [ b ] y 1828 , many Kentuckians would have agreed with that assessment . " 
 Desha supported William T. Barry , the Democratic @-@ Republican gubernatorial nominee , to succeed him . Early reports showed Barry leading his opponent , National Republican Thomas Metcalfe , but the final margin favored Metcalfe . Not only did Desha not agree with Metcalfe politically , he believed that the governorship should go to a high @-@ born aristocrat . Although Metcalfe was the son of a Revolutionary War soldier , his nickname of " Old Stone Hammer " indicated his pride in his trade of masonry , which was considered a common profession . 
 Due to a constitutional quirk , Metcalfe 's term was scheduled to begin eight days before the expiration of Desha 's . Desha charged that Metcalfe was not allowing him to finish out his term and threatened not to vacate the governor 's mansion until his term officially ended . Clark records as legend that , after drinking heavily at a local tavern , Metcalfe and some of his supporters formed a mob and went to the governor 's mansion to evict him by force . Accounts in the local newspapers of the time instead record that the <unk> left the mansion peacefully without intervention by Metcalfe . 
 = = Later life and death = = 
 At the expiration of his term as governor , Desha retired from public life to his farm in Harrison County . During the final years of his life , Desha and his wife Margaret moved to Georgetown , Kentucky , where one of his sons , a physician , lived . Desha died at his home in Georgetown , Kentucky , on October 11 , 1842 , and was buried on the grounds . The state erected a monument over his grave . In 1880 , both Desha 's body and the monument were moved to Georgetown Cemetery .
