 The Rolls @-@ Royce Merlin is a British liquid @-@ cooled V @-@ 12 piston aero engine of 27 @-@ litres ( 1 @,@ 650 cu in ) capacity . Rolls @-@ Royce designed the engine and first ran it in 1933 as a private venture . Initially known as the PV @-@ 12 , it was later called Merlin following the company convention of naming its piston aero engines after birds of prey . 
 After several modifications , the first production variants of the PV @-@ 12 were completed in 1936 . The first operational aircraft to enter service using the Merlin were the Fairey Battle , Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire . More Merlins were made for the four @-@ engined Avro Lancaster heavy bomber than for any other aircraft ; however , the engine is most closely associated with the Spitfire , starting with the Spitfire 's maiden flight in 1936 . A series of rapidly applied developments , brought about by wartime needs , markedly improved the engine 's performance and durability . 
 One of the most successful aircraft engines of the World War II era , some fifty marks of Merlin were built by Rolls @-@ Royce in Derby , Crewe and Glasgow , as well as by Ford of Britain at their Trafford Park factory , near Manchester . Post @-@ war , the Merlin was largely superseded by the Rolls @-@ Royce Griffon for military use , with most Merlin variants being designed and built for airliners and military transport aircraft . Production ceased in 1950 after 160 @,@ 000 engines had been delivered . In addition , the Packard V @-@ 1650 was a version of the Merlin built in the United States , itself produced in numbers upwards of 55 @,@ 000 examples , and was the principal engine used in the North American P @-@ 51 Mustang . 
 Merlin engines remain in Royal Air Force service today with the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight , and power many restored aircraft in private ownership worldwide .

 In the early 1930s , Rolls @-@ Royce started planning its future aero @-@ engine development programme and realised there was a need for an engine larger than their 21 @-@ litre ( 1 @,@ 296 cu in ) Kestrel which was being used with great success in a number of 1930s aircraft . Consequently , work was started on a new 1 @,@ 100 hp ( 820 kW ) -class design known as the PV @-@ 12 , with PV standing for Private Venture , 12 @-@ cylinder , as the company received no government funding for work on the project . The PV @-@ 12 was first run on 15 October 1933 and first flew in a Hawker Hart biplane ( serial number <unk> ) on 21 February 1935 . The engine was originally designed to use the evaporative cooling system then in vogue . This proved unreliable and when supplies of ethylene glycol from the U.S. became available , the engine was adapted to use a conventional liquid @-@ cooling system . The Hart was subsequently delivered to Rolls @-@ Royce where , as a Merlin testbed , it completed over 100 hours of flying with the Merlin C and E engines . 
 In 1935 , the Air Ministry issued a specification , F10 / 35 , for new fighter aircraft with a minimum airspeed of 310 mph ( 500 km / h ) . Fortunately , two designs had been developed : the Supermarine Spitfire and the Hawker Hurricane ; the latter designed in response to another specification , <unk> / 34 . Both were designed around the PV @-@ 12 instead of the Kestrel , and were the only contemporary British fighters to have been so developed . Production contracts for both aircraft were placed in 1936 , and development of the PV @-@ 12 was given top priority as well as government funding . Following the company convention of naming its piston aero engines after birds of prey , Rolls @-@ Royce named the engine the Merlin after a small , Northern Hemisphere falcon ( Falco columbarius ) . 
 Two more Rolls @-@ Royce engines developed just prior to the war were added to the company 's range . The 700 hp ( 520 kW ) Rolls @-@ Royce Peregrine was an updated , supercharged development of their V @-@ 12 Kestrel design , while the 1 @,@ 700 hp ( 1 @,@ 300 kW ) 42 @-@ litre ( 2 @,@ 560 cu in ) Rolls @-@ Royce Vulture used four Kestrel @-@ sized cylinder blocks fitted to a single crankcase and driving a common crankshaft , forming an X @-@ 24 layout . This was to be used in larger aircraft such as the Avro Manchester . 
 Although the Peregrine appeared to be a satisfactory design , it was never allowed to mature since Rolls @-@ Royce 's priority was refining the Merlin . As a result , the Peregrine saw use in only two aircraft : the Westland Whirlwind fighter and one of the Gloster F.9 / 37 prototypes . The Vulture was fitted to the Avro Manchester bomber , but proved unreliable in service and the planned fighter using it – the Hawker Tornado – was cancelled as a result . With the Merlin itself soon pushing into the 1 @,@ 500 hp ( 1 @,@ 100 kW ) range , the Peregrine and Vulture were both cancelled in 1943 , and by mid @-@ 1943 the Merlin was supplemented in service by the larger Griffon . The Griffon incorporated several design improvements and ultimately superseded the Merlin .

 Initially the new engine was plagued with problems , such as failure of the accessory gear trains and coolant jackets , and several different construction methods were tried before the basic design of the Merlin was set . Early production Merlins were also unreliable : Common problems were cylinder head cracking , coolant leaks , and excessive wear to the camshafts and crankshaft main bearings .

 The Merlin II and III series were the first main production versions of the engine . The Merlin III was the first version to incorporate a " universal " propeller shaft , allowing either de Havilland or Rotol manufactured propellers to be used . 
 The first major version to incorporate changes brought about through experience in operational service was the XX , which was designed to run on 100 octane fuel . This fuel allowed higher manifold pressures , which were achieved by increasing the boost from the centrifugal supercharger . The Merlin XX also utilised the two @-@ speed superchargers designed by Rolls @-@ Royce , resulting in increased power at higher altitudes than previous versions . Another improvement , introduced with the Merlin X , was the use of a 70 % – 30 % water @-@ glycol coolant mix rather than the 100 % glycol of the earlier versions . This substantially improved engine life and reliability , removed the fire hazard of the flammable ethylene glycol , and reduced the oil leaks that had been a problem with the early Merlin I , II and III series . 
 The process of improvement continued , with later versions running on higher octane ratings , delivering more power . Fundamental design changes were also made to all key components , again increasing the engine 's life and reliability . By the end of the war the " little " engine was delivering over 1 @,@ 600 horsepower ( 1 @,@ 200 kW ) in common versions , and as much as 2 @,@ 030 horsepower ( 1 @,@ 540 kW ) in the Merlin 130 / 131 versions specifically designed for the de Havilland Hornet . Ultimately , during tests conducted by Rolls @-@ Royce at Derby , an <unk> ( the high altitude version of the Merlin 100 @-@ Series ) achieved 2 @,@ 640 horsepower ( 1 @,@ 969 kW ) at 36 lb boost ( 103 " Hg ) on 150 octane fuel with water injection . 
 With the end of the war , work on improving Merlin power output was halted and the development effort was concentrated on civil derivatives of the Merlin . Development of what became the " Transport Merlin " ( <unk> ) commenced with the Merlin 102 ( the first Merlin to complete the new civil type @-@ test requirements ) and was aimed at improving reliability and service overhaul periods for airline operators using airliner and transport aircraft such as the Avro Lancastrian , Avro York ( Merlin 500 @-@ series ) , Avro Tudor II & IV ( Merlin 621 ) , Tudor IVB & V ( Merlin 623 ) , TCA Canadair North Star ( Merlin 724 ) and BOAC Argonaut ( Merlin 724 @-@ IC ) . By 1951 time between overhaul ( <unk> ) was typically between 650 – 800 hours depending on use . By then single @-@ stage engines had accumulated 2 @,@ 615 @,@ 000 engine hours in civil operation , and two @-@ stage engines 1 @,@ 169 @,@ 000 . 
 In addition , an exhaust system to reduce noise levels to below those from ejector exhausts was devised for the North Star / Argonaut . This " cross @-@ over " system took the exhaust flow from the inboard bank of cylinders up @-@ and @-@ over the engine before discharging the exhaust stream on the outboard side of the UPP nacelle . As a result , sound levels were reduced by between 5 and 8 decibels . The modified exhaust also conferred an increase in horsepower over the unmodified system of 38 hp ( 28 kW ) , resulting in a 5 knot improvement in true air speed . Still @-@ air range of the aircraft was also improved by around 4 per cent . The modified engine was designated the " <unk> " and the modified exhaust system was supplied as kit that could be installed on existing engines either by the operator or by Rolls @-@ Royce . 
 Power ratings for the civil Merlin 600 , 620 , and 621 @-@ series was 1 @,@ 160 hp ( 870 kW ) continuous cruising at 23 @,@ 500 feet ( 7 @,@ 200 m ) , and 1 @,@ 725 hp ( 1 @,@ 286 kW ) for take @-@ off . Merlins 622 @-@ 626 were rated at 1 @,@ 420 hp ( 1 @,@ 060 kW ) continuous cruising at 18 @,@ 700 feet ( 5 @,@ 700 m ) , and 1 @,@ 760 hp ( 1 @,@ 310 kW ) for take @-@ off . Engines were available with single @-@ stage , two @-@ speed supercharging ( 500 @-@ series ) , two @-@ stage , two @-@ speed supercharging ( 600 @-@ series ) , and with full <unk> , or with half <unk> / charge heating , charge heating being employed for cold area use such as in Canada . Civil Merlin engines in airline service flew 7 @,@ 818 @,@ 000 air miles in 1946 , 17 @,@ 455 @,@ 000 in 1947 , and 24 @,@ 850 @,@ 000 miles in 1948 .

 Most of the Merlin 's technical improvements resulted from more efficient superchargers , designed by Stanley Hooker , and the introduction of aviation spirits with increased octane ratings . Numerous detail changes were made internally and externally to the engine to withstand increased power ratings and to incorporate advances in engineering practices . 
 = = = = = Ejector exhausts = = = = = 
 The Merlin consumed an enormous volume of air at full power ( equivalent to the volume of a single @-@ decker bus per minute ) , and with the exhaust gases exiting at 1 @,@ 300 mph ( 2 @,@ 100 km / h ) it was realised that useful thrust could be gained simply by angling the gases backwards instead of venting sideways . 
 During tests , 70 pounds @-@ force ( 310 N ; 32 kgf ) thrust at 300 mph ( 480 km / h ) , or roughly 70 horsepower ( 52 kW ) was obtained which increased the level maximum speed of the Spitfire by 10 mph ( 16 km / h ) to 360 mph ( 580 km / h ) . The first versions of the ejector exhausts featured round outlets , while subsequent versions of the system used " fishtail " style outlets which marginally increased thrust and reduced exhaust glare for night flying . 
 In September 1937 the Spitfire prototype , K5054 , was fitted with ejector type exhausts . Later marks of the Spitfire used a variation of this exhaust system fitted with forward @-@ facing intake ducts to distribute hot air out to the wing @-@ mounted guns to prevent freezing and stoppages at high altitudes , replacing an earlier system that used heated air from the engine coolant radiator . The latter system had become ineffective due to improvements to the Merlin itself which allowed higher operating altitudes where air temperatures are lower . Ejector exhausts were also fitted to other Merlin @-@ powered aircraft . 
 = = = = = Supercharger = = = = = 
 Central to the success of the Merlin was the supercharger . A.C. Lovesey , an engineer who was a key figure in the design of the Merlin , delivered a lecture on the development of the Merlin in 1946 ; in this extract he explained the importance of the supercharger : 
 The impression still prevails that the static capacity known as the swept volume is the basis of comparison of the possible power output for different types of engine , but this is not the case because the output of the engine depends solely on the mass of air it can be made to consume efficiently , and in this respect the supercharger plays the most important role ... the engine has to be capable of dealing with the greater mass flows with respect to cooling , freedom from detonation and capable of withstanding high gas and inertia loads ... During the course of research and development on superchargers it became apparent to us that any further increase in the altitude performance of the Merlin engine necessitated the employment of a two @-@ stage supercharger . 
 As the Merlin evolved so too did the supercharger ; the latter fitting into three broad categories : 
 Single @-@ stage , single @-@ speed gearbox : Merlin I to III , XII , 30 , 40 , and 50 series ( 1937 – 1942 ) . 
 Single @-@ stage , two @-@ speed gearbox : experimental Merlin X ( 1938 ) , production Merlin XX ( 1940 – 1945 ) . 
 Two @-@ stage , two @-@ speed gearbox with intercooler : mainly Merlin 60 , 70 , and 80 series ( 1942 – 1946 ) . 
 The Merlin supercharger was originally designed to allow the engine to generate maximum power at an altitude of about 16 @,@ 000 ft ( 4 @,@ 900 m ) . In 1938 Stanley Hooker , an Oxford graduate in applied mathematics , explained " ... I soon became very familiar with the construction of the Merlin supercharger and carburettor ... Since the supercharger was at the rear of the engine it had come in for pretty severe design treatment , and the air intake duct to the impeller looked very squashed ... " Tests conducted by Hooker showed the original intake design was inefficient , limiting the performance of the supercharger . Hooker subsequently designed a new air intake duct with improved flow characteristics which increased maximum power at a higher altitude of over 19 @,@ 000 ft ( 5 @,@ 800 m ) ; and also improved the design of both the impeller , and the diffuser which controlled the airflow to it . These modifications led to the development of the single @-@ stage Merlin XX and 45 series . 
 A significant advance in supercharger design was the incorporation in 1938 of a two @-@ speed drive ( designed by the French company Farman ) to the impeller of the Merlin X. The later Merlin XX incorporated the two @-@ speed drive as well as several improvements that enabled the production rate of Merlins to be increased . The low @-@ ratio gear , which operated from takeoff to an altitude of 10 @,@ 000 ft ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) , drove the impeller at 21 @,@ 597 rpm and developed 1 @,@ 240 horsepower ( 925 kW ) at that height ; while the high gear 's ( 25 @,@ 148 rpm ) power rating was 1 @,@ 175 horsepower ( 876 kW ) at 18 @,@ 000 ft ( 5 @,@ 500 m ) . These figures were achieved at 2 @,@ 850 rpm engine speed using + 9 pounds per square inch ( 1 @.@ 66 atm ) ( 48 " ) boost . 
 In 1940 , after receiving a request in March of that year from the Ministry of Aircraft Production for a high @-@ rated ( 40 @,@ 000 ft ( 12 @,@ 000 m ) ) Merlin for use as an alternative engine to the turbocharged Hercules VIII used in the prototype high @-@ altitude Vickers Wellington V bomber , Rolls @-@ Royce started experiments on the design of a two @-@ stage supercharger and an engine fitted with this was bench @-@ tested in April 1941 , eventually becoming the Merlin 60 . The basic design used a modified Vulture supercharger for the first stage while a Merlin 46 supercharger was used for the second . A liquid @-@ cooled intercooler on top of the supercharger casing was used to prevent the compressed air / fuel mixture from becoming too hot . Also considered was an exhaust @-@ driven turbocharger but , although a lower fuel consumption was an advantage the added weight and the need to add extra ducting for the exhaust flow and waste @-@ gates , meant that this option was rejected in favour of the two @-@ stage supercharger . Fitted with the two @-@ stage two @-@ speed supercharger , the Merlin 60 series gained 300 horsepower ( 224 kW ) at 30 @,@ 000 ft ( 9 @,@ 100 m ) over the Merlin 45 series , at which altitude a Spitfire IX was nearly 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) faster than a Spitfire V. 
 The two @-@ stage Merlin family was extended in 1943 with the Merlin 66 which had its supercharger geared for increased power ratings at low altitudes , and the Merlin 70 series that were designed to deliver increased power at high altitudes . 
 While the design of the two @-@ stage supercharger forged ahead , Rolls @-@ Royce also continued to develop the single @-@ stage supercharger , resulting in 1942 in the development of a smaller " cropped " impeller for the Merlin <unk> and <unk> ; both of these engines developed greater power at low altitudes . In squadron service the <unk> variant of the Spitfire fitted with these engines became known as the " clipped , clapped , and cropped <unk> " to indicate the shortened wingspan , the less @-@ than @-@ perfect condition of the used airframes , and the cropped supercharger impeller . 
 = = = = = <unk> developments = = = = = 
 The use of carburettors was calculated to give a higher specific power output , due to the lower temperature , hence greater density , of the fuel / air mixture compared to injected systems . However , the Merlin 's float controlled carburettor meant that both Spitfires and Hurricanes were unable to pitch nose down into a steep dive . The contemporary Bf 109E , which had direct fuel injection , could " bunt " into a high @-@ power dive to escape attack , leaving the pursuing aircraft behind because its fuel had been forced out of the carburettor 's float chamber by the effects of negative g @-@ force ( g ) . RAF fighter pilots soon learned to " half @-@ roll " their aircraft before diving to pursue their opponents . " Miss Shilling 's orifice " , a restrictor in the fuel supply line to restrict flow together with a diaphragm fitted in the float chamber to contain fuel under negative G , went some way towards curing the fuel starvation in a dive ; however , at less than maximum power a fuel @-@ rich mixture still resulted . Another improvement was made by moving the fuel outlet from the bottom of the S.U. carburettor to exactly halfway up the side , which allowed the fuel to flow equally well under negative or positive g . 
 Further improvements were introduced throughout the Merlin range : 1943 saw the introduction of a Bendix @-@ Stromberg pressure carburettor that injected fuel at 5 pounds per square inch ( 34 kPa ; 0 @.@ 34 bar ) through a nozzle directly into the supercharger , and was fitted to Merlin 66 , 70 , 76 , 77 and 85 variants . The final development , which was fitted to the 100 @-@ series Merlins , was an S.U. injection carburettor that injected fuel into the supercharger using a fuel pump driven as a function of crankshaft speed and engine pressures .

 At the start of the war the Merlin I , II and III ran on the then standard 87 octane aviation spirit and could generate just over 1 @,@ 000 horsepower ( 750 kW ) from its 27 @-@ litre ( 1 @,@ 650 @-@ cu in ) displacement : the maximum boost pressure at which the engine could be run using 87 octane fuel was + 6 pounds per square inch ( 141 kPa ; 1 @.@ 44 atm ) . However , as early as 1938 , at the 16th Paris Air Show , Rolls @-@ Royce displayed two versions of the Merlin rated to use 100 octane fuel . The Merlin <unk> was capable of 1 @,@ 265 horsepower ( 943 kW ) at 7 @,@ 870 feet ( 2 @,@ 400 m ) , 1 @,@ 285 horsepower ( 958 kW ) at 9 @,@ 180 feet ( 2 @,@ 800 m ) and 1 @,@ 320 horsepower ( 984 kW ) on take @-@ off ; while a Merlin X with a two @-@ speed supercharger in high gear generated 1 @,@ 150 horsepower ( 857 kW ) at 15 @,@ 400 feet ( 4 @,@ 700 m ) and 1 @,@ 160 horsepower ( 865 kW ) at 16 @,@ 730 feet ( 5 @,@ 100 m ) . 
 From late 1939 , 100 octane fuel became available from the U.S. , West Indies , Persia , and , in smaller quantities , domestically , consequently , " ... in the first half of 1940 the RAF transferred all Hurricane and Spitfire squadrons to 100 octane fuel . " Small modifications were made to Merlin II and III series engines , allowing an increased ( emergency ) boost pressure of + 12 pounds per square inch ( 183 kPa ; 1 @.@ 85 atm ) . At this power setting these engines were able to produce 1 @,@ 310 horsepower ( 977 kW ) at 9 @,@ 000 ft ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) while running at 3 @,@ 000 revolutions per minute . Increased boost could be used indefinitely as there was no mechanical time limit mechanism but pilots were advised not to use increased boost for more than a maximum of five minutes and it was considered a " definite overload condition on the engine " ; if the pilot resorted to emergency boost he had to report this on landing , when it was noted in the engine log book , while the engineering officer was required to examine the engine and reset the throttle gate . Later versions of the Merlin ran only on 100 octane fuel and the five @-@ minute combat limitation was raised to + 18 pounds per square inch ( 224 kPa ; 2 @.@ 3 atm ) . 
 In late 1943 trials were run of a new " 100 / 150 " grade ( 150 octane ) fuel , recognised by its bright @-@ green colour and " awful smell " . Initial tests were conducted using 6 @.@ 5 cubic centimetres ( 0 @.@ 23 imp fl oz ) of tetraethyllead ( <unk> ) for every one imperial gallon of 100 octane fuel ( or 1 @.@ 43 cc / L or 0 @.@ 18 U.S. fl oz / U.S. gal ) , but this mixture resulted in a build @-@ up of lead in the combustion chambers , causing excessive fouling of the spark plugs . Better results were achieved by adding 2 @.@ 5 % mono methyl aniline ( <unk> ) to 100 octane fuel . The new fuel allowed the five @-@ minute boost rating of the Merlin 66 to be raised to + 25 pounds per square inch ( 272 kPa ; 2 @.@ 7 atm ) . With this boost rating the Merlin 66 generated 2 @,@ 000 hp ( 1 @,@ 491 Kw ) at sea @-@ level and 1 @,@ 860 hp ( 1 @,@ 387 Kw ) at 10 @,@ 500 ft ( 3 @,@ 200 m ) . 
 Starting in March 1944 , the Merlin 66 @-@ powered Spitfire IXs of two Air Defence of Great Britain ( ADGB ) squadrons were cleared to use the new fuel for operational trials , and it was put to good use in the summer of 1944 when it enabled Spitfire L.F. Mk . IXs to intercept V @-@ 1 flying bombs coming in at low altitudes . 100 / 150 grade fuel was also used by Mosquito night fighters of the ADGB to intercept V @-@ 1s . In early February 1945 , Spitfires of the Second Tactical Air Force ( 2TAF ) also began using 100 / 150 grade fuel .

 Production of the Rolls @-@ Royce Merlin was driven by the forethought and determination of Ernest Hives , who at times was enraged by the apparent complacency and lack of urgency encountered in his frequent correspondence with Air Ministry and local authority officials . Hives was an advocate of shadow factories , and , sensing the imminent outbreak of war , pressed ahead with plans to produce the Merlin in sufficient numbers for the rapidly expanding Royal Air Force . Despite the importance of uninterrupted production , several factories were affected by industrial action . By the end of its production run in 1950 , 168 @,@ 176 Merlin engines had been built ; over 112 @,@ 000 in Britain and more than 55 @,@ 000 under licence in the U.S. 
 = = = Derby = = = 
 The existing Rolls @-@ Royce facilities at <unk> , Derby were not suitable for large @-@ scale engine production although the floor space had been increased by some 25 % between 1935 and 1939 ; nevertheless , Hives planned to build the first two- or three hundred engines there until engineering teething troubles had been resolved . To fund this expansion , the Air Ministry had provided a total of ₤ 1 @,@ 927 @,@ 000 by December 1939 . Having a workforce that consisted mainly of design engineers and highly skilled men , the Derby factory carried out the majority of development work on the Merlin , with flight testing carried out at nearby RAF Hucknall . 
 Total Merlin production at Derby was 32 @,@ 377 . 
 The original factory closed in March 2008 , but Rolls @-@ Royce plc still maintains a large presence in Derby . 
 = = = Crewe = = = 
 To meet the increasing demand for Merlin engines , Rolls @-@ Royce started building work on a new factory at Crewe in May 1938 , with engines leaving the factory in 1939 . The Crewe factory had convenient road and rail links to their existing facilities at Derby . Production at Crewe was originally planned to use unskilled labour and sub @-@ contractors with which Hives felt there would be no particular difficulty , but the number of required sub @-@ contracted parts such as <unk> , camshafts and cylinder liners eventually fell short and the factory was expanded to manufacture these parts " in house " . 
 Initially the local authority promised to build 1 @,@ 000 new houses to accommodate the workforce by the end of 1938 , but by February 1939 it had only awarded a contract for 100 . Hives was incensed by this complacency and threatened to move the whole operation , but timely intervention by the Air Ministry improved the situation . In 1940 a strike took place when women replaced men on capstan lathes , the workers ' union insisting this was a skilled labour job ; however , the men returned to work after 10 days . 
 Total Merlin production at Crewe was 26 @,@ 065 . 
 The factory was used postwar for the production of Bentley motor cars , and in 1998 Volkswagen AG bought both the marque and the factory . Today it is known as Bentley Crewe . 
 = = = Glasgow = = = 
 Hives further recommended that a factory be built near Glasgow to take advantage of the abundant local work force and the supply of steel and forgings from Scottish manufacturers . In September 1939 , the Air Ministry allocated ₤ 4 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 for a new Shadow factory . This government @-@ funded and -operated factory was built at <unk> starting in June 1939 with workers moving into the premises in October , one month after the outbreak of war . The factory was fully occupied by September 1940 . A housing crisis also occurred at Glasgow where Hives again asked the Air Ministry to step in . 
 With 16 @,@ 000 employees , the Glasgow factory was one of the largest industrial operations in Scotland . Unlike the Derby and Crewe plants which relied significantly on external subcontractors , it produced almost all the Merlin 's components itself . Engines began to leave the production line in November 1940 , and by June 1941 monthly output had reached 200 , increasing to more than 400 per month by March 1942 . In total 23 @,@ 675 engines were produced . Worker absenteeism became a problem after some months due to the physical and mental effects of wartime conditions such as the frequent occupation of air @-@ raid shelters . It was agreed to cut the punishing working hours slightly to 82 hours a week , with one half @-@ Sunday per month awarded as holiday . Record production is reported to have been 100 engines in one day . 
 Immediately after the war the site repaired and overhauled Merlin and Griffon engines , and continued to manufacture spare parts . Finally , following the production of the Rolls @-@ Royce Avon turbojet and others , the factory was closed in 2005 . 
 = = = Manchester = = = 
 The Ford Motor Company was asked to produce Merlins at Trafford Park , Stretford , near Manchester , and building work on a new factory was started in May 1940 on a 118 @-@ acre ( 48 ha ) site . Built with two distinct sections to minimise potential bomb damage , it was completed in May 1941 and bombed in the same month . At first , the factory had difficulty in attracting suitable labour , and large numbers of women , youths and untrained men had to be taken on . Despite this , the first Merlin engine came off the production line one month later and it was building the engine at a rate of 200 per week by 1943 , at which point the joint factories were producing 18 @,@ 000 Merlins per year . In his autobiography Not much of an Engineer , Sir Stanley Hooker states : " ... once the great Ford factory at Manchester started production , Merlins came out like shelling peas ... " . 
 Some 17 @,@ 316 people worked at the Trafford Park plant , including 7 @,@ 260 women and two resident doctors and nurses . Merlin production started to run down in August 1945 , and finally ceased on 23 March 1946 . 
 Total Merlin production at Trafford Park was 30 @,@ 428 . 
 = = = Packard V @-@ 1650 = = = 
 As the Merlin was considered to be so important to the war effort , negotiations were soon started to establish an alternative production line outside the UK . Rolls @-@ Royce staff visited a number of North American automobile manufacturers in order to select one to build the Merlin in the U.S. or Canada . Henry Ford rescinded an initial offer to build the engine in the U.S. in July 1940 , and the Packard Motor Car Company was subsequently selected to take on the $ 130 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 Merlin order . Agreement was reached in September 1940 , and the first Packard @-@ built engine , a Merlin XX designated the V @-@ 1650 @-@ 1 , ran in August 1941 . 
 Total Merlin production by Packard was 55 @,@ 523 . 
 Six development engines were also made by Continental Motors , Inc . 
 = = Variants = = 
 This is a list of representative Merlin variants , describing some of the mechanical changes made during development of the Merlin . Engines of the same power output were typically assigned different model numbers based on supercharger or propeller gear ratios , differences in cooling system or carburettors , engine block construction , or arrangement of engine controls . Power ratings quoted are usually maximum " military " power . All but the Merlin 131 and 134 engines were " right @-@ hand tractor " , i.e. the propeller rotated clockwise when viewed from the rear . In addition to the mark numbers , Merlin engines were allocated experimental numbers by the Ministry of Supply ( <unk> ) – e.g. : RM <unk> for the Merlin 61 and some variants – while under development ; these numbers are noted where possible . Merlin engines used in Spitfires , apart from the Merlin 61 , used a propeller reduction ratio of .477 : 1 . Merlins used in bombers and other fighters used a ratio of .42 : 1 .

 = Lion @-@ class battleship = 
 The Lion @-@ class battleships were a class of six fast battleships designed for the Royal Navy in the late 1930s . They were a larger , improved version of the King George V class with 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) guns . Only two ships were laid down before World War II began in September 1939 and a third was ordered during the war , but their construction was suspended shortly afterwards . Their design changed several times in response to the removal of treaty restrictions on size and in light of war experience . None of the other ships planned were laid down , although there was a proposal to modify one of the suspended ships into a hybrid battleship / aircraft carrier with two 16 @-@ inch gun turrets and a flight deck . The two ships already begun were scrapped after the end of the war . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The choice of 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) gun and the mix of quadruple and twin turrets for the main battery of the King George Vs had been dictated by the Second London Naval Treaty , which limited battleships to 35 @,@ 000 long tons ( 36 @,@ 000 t ) standard displacement and a main calibre of 14 inches . However , when the Japanese Government refused to agree to its terms , the maximum calibre allowed reverted to 16 inches in April 1937 . The Board of Admiralty then began preliminary design work on a 35 @,@ 000 @-@ ton ship armed with 16 @-@ inch guns and they were promising enough that the Director of Naval Construction ( DNC ) was ordered to further investigate such designs , providing for several aircraft as well . To save design time , many of the features of the King George Vs were incorporated in the new design , but the limited size of the ship was a real challenge for the designers . The increased weight of the main armament was compensated for by a slight reduction in the overall weight of armour and the elimination of two twin 5 @.@ 25 @-@ inch ( 133 mm ) gun turrets . 
 The designer 's issues were made much easier on 31 March 1938 when the signatories of the Treaty invoked its escalation clause because the Japanese refused to provide any information about their battleship construction programme and the signatories feared that their new ships could be outclassed by the new Japanese battleships . The new limit was 45 @,@ 000 long tons ( 46 @,@ 000 t ) at " American insistence " , but the Admiralty decided to limit themselves to 40 @,@ 000 long tons ( 41 @,@ 000 t ) and nine 16 @-@ inch guns on cost grounds and that larger vessels would be unable to dock at Rosyth or Portsmouth . A new design was prepared with more armour , more powerful machinery , the two twin 5 @.@ 25 @-@ inch gun turrets restored , and four aircraft added . The Admiralty approved this design on 15 December and bids were solicited very shortly afterwards . 
 = = = 1938 design = = = 
 The 1938 version of the Lion class had an overall length of 785 feet ( 239 @.@ 3 m ) , a beam of 105 feet ( 32 @.@ 0 m ) , and a maximum draught of 33 feet 6 inches ( 10 @.@ 2 m ) . They displaced 40 @,@ 550 long tons ( 41 @,@ 200 t ) at standard load and 46 @,@ 400 long tons ( 47 @,@ 100 t ) at deep load . The appearance of the Lions closely resembled that of the <unk> , but with a transom stern to improve steaming efficiency at high speed . 
 In the interests of saving time , the four @-@ shaft unit machinery design from the King George Vs was duplicated with alternating boiler and engine rooms . The Lion @-@ class ships had four sets of single @-@ reduction geared Parsons steam turbines housed in separate engine rooms . Each set consisted of one high @-@ pressure and one low @-@ pressure turbine driving one propeller shaft . They were designed to produce a total of 130 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 97 @,@ 000 kW ) at overload condition and a speed of 30 knots ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) . The turbines were powered by eight Admiralty @-@ type three @-@ drum water @-@ tube boilers in four boiler rooms at a working pressure of 400 psi ( 2 @,@ 758 kPa ; 28 kgf / cm2 ) and temperature of 700 ° F ( 371 ° C ) . The turbines and boilers could be cross @-@ connected in an emergency . The ships were designed to carry 3 @,@ 720 long tons ( 3 @,@ 780 t ) of fuel oil . Their maximum estimated range was 14 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 26 @,@ 000 km ; 16 @,@ 000 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . They were equipped with six 330 @-@ kilowatt ( 440 hp ) turbogenerators and two 330 @-@ kW diesel generators that supplied the common ring main at 220 volts . 
 The Lion @-@ class ships ' main armament consisted of nine 45 @-@ calibre 16 @-@ inch guns of a new design in three triple , hydraulically powered gun turrets designated ' A ' , ' B ' , and ' Y ' from bow to stern . The maximum elevation of the turrets was increased to + 40 ° although the guns were loaded at + 5 ° . They fired 2 @,@ 375 @-@ pound ( 1 @,@ 077 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 483 ft / s ( 757 m / s ) ; this provided a maximum range of 40 @,@ 560 yards ( 37 @,@ 088 m ) . Their rate of fire was two rounds per minute . The ships carried 100 shells per gun . The secondary armament consisted of sixteen 45 @-@ calibre QF 5 @.@ 25 @-@ inch Mk I dual purpose guns in eight twin gun mounts . They had a maximum depression of − 5 ° and a maximum elevation of + 70 ° . They fired an 80 @-@ pound ( 36 kg ) high @-@ explosive shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 672 ft / s ( 814 m / s ) . Their normal rate of fire was about 7 – 8 rounds per minute . At maximum elevation , the guns had a maximum range of 24 @,@ 070 yards ( 22 @,@ 010 m ) . 400 rounds were provided for each gun . Short @-@ range air defence was provided by 48 QF 2 @-@ pounder guns in six octuple mountings . The 2 @-@ pounder gun fired a 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) 1 @.@ 684 @-@ pound ( 0 @.@ 764 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 400 ft / s ( 730 m / s ) to a distance of 6 @,@ 800 yards ( 6 @,@ 200 m ) . The gun 's rate of fire was approximately 96 – 98 rounds per minute . 1800 rounds per gun were carried by the ships . 
 Their armour scheme was virtually identical to that of the King George V class . The waterline belt was composed of Krupp cemented armour ( KCA ) 15 inches ( 381 mm ) thick and was 433 feet ( 132 @.@ 0 m ) long . The main portion of the belt was 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) high , but a lower strake , 8 feet 3 inches ( 2 @.@ 5 m ) high , extended an additional 40 feet ( 12 @.@ 2 m ) past the ends of the armoured citadel . It tapered vertically from 15 inches in thickness to 5 @.@ 5 inches ( 140 mm ) at the bottom edge of the belt , while the plates at the end of the belt were only 11 inches ( 279 mm ) thick at the top . Transverse bulkheads 10 – 12 inches ( 254 – 305 mm ) thick closed off each end of the central citadel . At the aft end of the steering gear compartment was a 4 @-@ inch ( 100 mm ) transverse bulkhead . The KCA face @-@ plates of the main gun turrets were 15 inches thick and their roofs 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) non @-@ cemented armour plates . Their sides remained 7 – 10 inches ( 180 – 250 mm ) in thickness . The barbettes for the 16 @-@ inch guns were 15 inches thick on the sides , but tapered to 12 – 13 @.@ 5 inches ( 305 – 343 mm ) closer to the centreline of the ship . 
 Intended to resist the impact of a 1 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 450 kg ) armour @-@ piercing bomb dropped from a height of 14 @,@ 000 feet ( 4 @,@ 300 m ) , the Lions ' deck protection was identical to that of the King George V class . It consisted of 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) non @-@ cemented armour over the magazines that reduced to 5 inches ( 127 mm ) over the machinery spaces . The armour continued forward and aft of the citadel at the lower @-@ deck level . Forward it tapered in steps from five inches down to 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) near the bow . Aft , it protected the steering gear and propeller shafts with 4 @.@ 5 – 5 inches ( 114 – 127 mm ) of armour . Unlike the Germans , French and Americans , the British no longer believed that heavy armour for the conning tower served any real purpose given that the chance of hitting the conning tower was very small and protected the forward conning tower with only 3 – 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 76 – 114 mm ) of armour . 
 The underwater protection , also virtually identical to that of the King George Vs , consisted of a three @-@ layer system of voids and liquid @-@ filled compartments meant to absorb the energy of an underwater explosion . It was bounded on the inside by the 1 @.@ 75 @-@ inch ( 44 mm ) torpedo bulkhead . Both of the inner and outer voids were fitted with pumps to flood them with water to level the ship ( counter @-@ flood ) in case she began to list . Over the length of the citadel , this system was found to be proof against 1 @,@ 000 lb ( 450 kg ) of TNT during full @-@ scale trials . The Lion @-@ class ships had a double bottom with a depth of 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) . 
 = = = 1942 design = = = 
 Construction was suspended shortly after the war began and the Admiralty took advantage of the time to refine the design in light of war experience in late 1941 . The beam was increased to the maximum width of the locks of the Panama Canal to increase the depth and effectiveness of ship 's torpedo protection system , and almost 1 @,@ 100 long tons ( 1 @,@ 100 t ) of fuel oil were added to increase the ship 's endurance . The requirement that ' A ' turret had to be able to fire directly ahead at 0 ° elevation was rescinded as it radically reduced freeboard forward and caused the King George Vs to take a lot of water over the bow in head seas . To partially compensate for the additional weight , the belt armour was reduced in thickness by 1 inch ( 25 mm ) except over the magazines , and the aircraft and their facilities were removed . The space in the superstructure freed up by these changes was used to increase the light anti @-@ aircraft armament to nine octuple and one quadruple 2 @-@ pounder mounts . 
 The overall length of the Lion class increased to 793 feet ( 241 @.@ 7 m ) and the beam to 108 feet ( 32 @.@ 9 m ) . The displacement grew to 42 @,@ 550 long tons ( 43 @,@ 230 t ) at standard load and 47 @,@ 650 long tons ( 48 @,@ 410 t ) at deep load . No changes were made to the propulsion machinery , but the speed decreased to 28 @.@ 25 knots ( 52 @.@ 32 km / h ; 32 @.@ 51 mph ) because of the greater displacement . The 4 @,@ 800 long tons ( 4 @,@ 900 t ) of fuel increased their endurance to an estimated maximum of 16 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 30 @,@ 600 km ; 19 @,@ 000 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots . The freeboard forward was increased by nearly 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) , and the radar suite was increased to match that of the battleship Vanguard , then under construction . Because the cruiser Belfast lost all steam power when she struck a mine early in the war , two diesel generators were substituted for two turbo @-@ generators . The additional beam was used to increase the depth of the torpedo protection system amidships from 13 @.@ 25 feet ( 4 @.@ 0 m ) to 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) . The ships ' crew was estimated at 1750 officers and men . 
 = = = 1944 design = = = 
 Another attempt was started in February 1944 by the DNC to incorporate wartime lessons and create a cutting edge design , but he soon concluded that " the power of modern weapons had increased so much that ever @-@ increasing armour and torpedo protection was required until it became incompatible with the limited offensive power of the ship . " No effort was made to investigate the torpedo protection system , nor were their characteristics finalized . Naval historians William Garzke and Robert Dulin speculate that the ships might have been 830 feet ( 253 @.@ 0 m ) long , with a beam of 115 feet ( 35 @.@ 1 m ) , and a draught of 35 feet ( 10 @.@ 7 m ) . They might have displaced about 56 @,@ 500 long tons ( 57 @,@ 400 t ) . Estimated endurance was <unk> with a clean hull . They would have used an improved Mk IV version of the 16 @-@ inch gun in a new Mk III turret that fired a heavier shell at a marginally lower velocity , mounted in three triple turrets . Additionally , they would carry twelve twin QF 4 @.@ 5 inch Mk V guns for secondary armament and nine sextuple Bofors plus an undetermined number of 20mm Oerlikons for anti @-@ aircraft protection . 
 When it became clear the original 1944 ' Design A ' pushed beyond the technologically feasible , it was abandoned in favour of a simpler modification of the 1942 plans for the Lion class . This was subsequently christened ' Design B ' . The ' B ' proposal scaled back heavily on underwater protection , top speed and reduced the size of the citadel to the minimum possible while dramatically increasing freeboard and retaining much of design A 's armour and firepower . Two further design series ; ' C ' and ' D ' , considered alternative ways of saving weight via reduced armament or belt thickness , but these were quickly deemed unsatisfactory . ' Design B ' became the primary focus and seven proposed versions were produced between March 1944 and February 1945 , of which B3 became DNC 's preference . 
 By mid 1945 the economic pressures on Britain were becoming paramount and a new proposal , with an armour arrangement similar to the modernized HMS Renown , christened ' Design X ' , was submitted by a design committee headed by Admiral Servaes to the DNC . ' Design X ' , along with the earlier preferred ' B3 ' variant Battleship design were further refined through October of 1945 , when further design work was informally suspended on all but the new Mk III 16 inch turret . This work too was finally cancelled by the First Sea Lord in late 1949 and brought a final end to battleship design and construction for the Royal Navy . 
 = = = Hybrid aircraft carrier = = = 
 On 8 January 1941 , Rear Admiral Bruce Fraser , Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy asked the DNC to work up a hybrid aircraft carrier based on the Lion @-@ class hull . Two months later , a sketch design was presented for consideration , but it was not well liked by the participants . This design retained all three main gun turrets and the flight deck was deemed too short to be useful . A revised version with only the two forward turrets retained was requested and was ready in July . In this design , the displacement ranged from 44 @,@ 750 long tons ( 45 @,@ 470 t ) at standard load and 51 @,@ 000 long tons ( 52 @,@ 000 t ) at deep load . The design 's dimensions included a waterline length of 800 feet ( 243 @.@ 8 m ) , a beam of 115 feet ( 35 @.@ 1 m ) and a draught of 29 feet 6 inches ( 9 @.@ 0 m ) . The flight deck was 500 feet ( 152 @.@ 4 m ) long and had a width of 73 feet ( 22 @.@ 3 m ) . The machinery was unchanged , but 600 long tons ( 610 t ) of additional oil increased her endurance to 14 @,@ 750 nautical miles ( 27 @,@ 320 km ; 16 @,@ 970 mi ) at 10 knots . The hybrid 's armament consisted of six 16 @-@ inch guns in two triple turrets , sixteen 5 @.@ 25 @-@ inch guns and eight octuple 2 @-@ pounder mounts . Twelve fighters and two torpedo bombers could be carried . The Director of Naval Gunnery was particularly pungent in his assessment of the design , " The functions and requirements of carriers and of surface gun platforms are entirely incompatible ... the conceptions of these designs ... is evidently the result of an unresolved contest between a conscious acceptance of aircraft and a subconscious desire for a 1914 Fleet ... these abortions are the results of a psychological maladjustment . The necessary readjustments should result from a proper re @-@ analysis of the whole question , what would be a balanced fleet in 1945 , 1950 or 1955 ? " Not surprisingly , the design was rejected . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Six Lion @-@ class ships were planned , two each in the 1938 , 1939 , and 1940 Naval Programmes . The first pair , Lion and Temeraire , were ordered on 28 February 1939 from Vickers Armstrongs and Cammell Laird respectively . Lion was laid down at Vickers ' Walker , Newcastle upon Tyne shipyard on 4 July while Temeraire preceded her at Birkenhead on 1 June . Contracts for Conqueror and Thunderer were awarded on 15 August to John Brown and Fairfield . It is uncertain if Conqueror was actually ordered , but Thunderer was not . Neither ship was ever laid down . 
 After the start of World War II in September , construction continued desultorily until October when it was suspended by the Admiralty for one year to release labour and material for escorts needed to protect merchant convoys . Construction of the 16 @-@ inch guns and their turrets was to continue , however . The question was raised again on 12 November 1940 and the decision to suspend construction was reaffirmed . All three ships ordered were cancelled in 1942 , but Lion 's keel was not scrapped until after the end of the war . Only four 16 @-@ inch guns , and no turrets , were ever completed . 
 = No. 84 Wing RAAF = 
 No. 84 Wing is a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) transport wing . Coming under the control of Air Mobility Group ( AMG ) , it is headquartered at RAAF Base Richmond , New South Wales . The wing comprises No. 34 Squadron , operating Boeing 737 and Bombardier Challenger 604 VIP jets ; No. 37 Squadron , operating Lockheed Martin C @-@ 130J Super Hercules medium transports ; and a technical training unit , No. 285 Squadron . 
 Formed in 1944 for army co @-@ operation duties in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II , No. 84 Wing operated a mix of aircraft including CAC Boomerangs , CAC Wirraways , Auster <unk> and Bristol Beauforts , before disbanding in 1946 . It was re @-@ formed in 1991 as a tactical transport wing headquartered at RAAF Base Townsville , Queensland , comprising Nos. 35 and 38 Squadrons operating de Havilland Canada DHC @-@ 4 Caribous . By 1996 , it had been augmented by No. 32 Squadron , operating Hawker Siddeley HS 748 trainer @-@ transports . 
 In 1998 , No. 84 Wing was reorganised as a special transport wing , headquartered at Richmond . The Caribous were transferred to No. 86 Wing and No. 84 Wing took over responsibility for No. 33 Squadron , operating Boeing 707 tanker @-@ transports , and No. 34 Squadron , operating VIP transports , in addition to controlling No. 32 Squadron . By mid @-@ 2006 , No. 32 Squadron had converted to Beech King Air 350s and transferred to Air Force Training Group , while No. 84 Wing had assumed control of No. 285 Squadron and Air Movements Training and Development Unit ( AMTDU ) . AMTDU was subsequently moved under the direct aegis of ALG , and No. 33 Squadron under No. 86 Wing , following the retirement of the 707s . No. 37 Squadron , by then the RAAF 's sole Hercules unit , was transferred from No. 86 Wing to No. 84 Wing in 2010 . No. 35 Squadron , which had been merged with No. 38 Squadron in 2000 , was re @-@ formed under No. 84 Wing in 2013 to operate Alenia C @-@ 27J Spartan tactical transport commencing in 2015 ; the squadron was detached from the wing in January 2014 but is scheduled to return as the Spartan becomes operational .

 = = = Army cooperation formation = = = 
 The Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) established two army cooperation wings in the South West Pacific Theatre late in World War II . They were , as described by the official history of the RAAF in the Pacific , " essentially non @-@ offensive in character " , responsible for reconnaissance , artillery spotting , supply drops to ground forces , spraying DDT to combat malaria , and guiding close support aircraft to their objectives . The wing 's aircraft could also carry out their own strikes on " targets of opportunity " . 
 No. 84 ( Army Cooperation ) Wing was formed on 11 September 1944 in Cairns , Queensland . Commanded by Group Captain Bill Hely , it comprised No. 5 ( Tactical Reconnaissance ) Squadron , No. 17 Air Observation Post ( AOP ) Flight , No. 10 Communication Unit , and No. 39 Operational Base Unit . The wing arrived at Torokina in October to begin supporting Australian troops during the Bougainville Campaign . No. 5 Squadron , equipped with eighteen CAC Boomerangs and four CAC Wirraways , was assigned to mark targets for F4U Corsairs of the Royal New Zealand Air Force . The Austers of No. 17 AOP Flight were used for reconnaissance and courier work , becoming , in the words of the official history , " the eyes of the battalion commanders " . No. 10 Communications Unit flew Avro Ansons and Bristol Beauforts on courier , reconnaissance , supply , and anti @-@ malarial spraying missions ; it was renamed No. 10 Local Air Supply Unit in March 1945 . Between December 1944 and January 1945 , the wing lost one Auster , one Wirraway , and one Boomerang on operations . 
 Despite suffering shortages of pilots and equipment , No. 84 Wing was generally able to keep pace with the army 's requirements . A detachment of No. 36 Squadron , flying C @-@ 47 Dakotas , was employed to augment the wing 's supply capabilities . Up until the end of June 1945 , No. 5 Squadron had flown almost 2 @,@ 000 sorties and No. 17 AOP Flight over 1 @,@ 300 , while No. 10 Local Air Supply Unit and the No. 36 Squadron detachment had accounted for almost 1 @,@ 000 between them . As the navigational efficiency of the New Zealander pilots increased , demands on the Boomerangs and Wirraways lessened , and the bulk of the reconnaissance duties fell to the Austers of No. 17 AOP Flight . 
 When the Pacific War ended in August 1945 , No. 10 Local Air Supply Unit was tasked with dropping leaflets announcing the news over Japanese positions . That month , Group Captain D.R. Chapman succeeded Hely as No. 84 Wing 's commander . The end of hostilities led to morale problems owing to inactivity and the uncertainties of demobilisation ; Chapman sent Northern Command headquarters a frank report to this effect , its tone earning him a rebuke from the Air Officer Commanding , Air Commodore Allan Walters . No. 17 AOP Flight was disbanded on Bougainville in December , followed a month later by No. 10 Local Air Supply Unit . No. 5 Squadron transferred to RAAF Station Pearce , Western Australia , in January 1946 , and disbanded in October that year . No. 84 Wing headquarters completed " reduction to nucleus " at Bougainville on 29 January 1946 . It departed <unk> and arrived in Essendon , Victoria , on 28 February , disbanding there on 6 March . 
 = = = Transport formation = = = 
 No. 84 Wing was re @-@ established as a tactical transport wing under the newly formed Operational Support Group ( <unk> ) at RAAF Base Townsville , Queensland , in February 1991 . It comprised two squadrons of de Havilland DHC @-@ 4 Caribous : No. 35 Squadron , located at Townsville , and No. 38 Squadron , located at RAAF Base Richmond , New South Wales . Prior to this , the two squadrons had been under the control of Tactical Transport Group , <unk> 's predecessor at Townsville . No. 84 Wing 's primary purpose was to support Australian Army operations and exercises , as well as the Parachute Training School at HMAS Albatross in Nowra , New South Wales . It also maintained detachments for search @-@ and @-@ rescue and local transport duties at RAAF Base Darwin , Northern Territory , and RAAF Base Pearce , Western Australia . The Pearce detachment ( No. 38 Squadron Detachment A ) was formed from No. 2 Flying Training School 's Caribou Flight on 1 March 1991 . In addition to their military role , the Caribous provided assistance to the civil community in the form of disaster relief and medical evacuation . The aircraft frequently operated in Papua New Guinea , for training and humanitarian missions . No. 38 Squadron , responsible for all Caribou aircrew conversion and operations training , transferred to RAAF Base Amberley , Queensland , in October 1992 . Beginning the following month , seven of the fleet 's twenty @-@ one Caribous were retired to storage at Amberley for use as spare parts . By mid @-@ 1996 , No. 84 Wing was under the control of Air Lift Group ( ALG ) , located at Richmond , and had been augmented by No. 32 Squadron , operating Hawker Siddeley HS 748s for navigational training , VIP transport , and fisheries surveillance out of RAAF Base East Sale in Victoria . 
 In January 1998 , No. 84 Wing was reorganised as a special transport wing under ALG , " special transport " meaning activities not directly related to army support , such as carrying VIPs . Its headquarters was relocated to Richmond . In addition to No. 32 Squadron , its complement included No. 33 Squadron , operating Boeing 707s for air @-@ to @-@ air refuelling and VIP transport out of Richmond , and No. 34 Squadron , operating Falcon 900s for VIP transport out of RAAF Base Fairbairn in Canberra . Nos. 35 and 38 Squadrons meanwhile transferred to No. 86 Wing , also headquartered at Richmond . Two of No. 33 Squadron 's five 707s were soon employed to form No. 84 Wing Detachment A in Kuwait , as part of Operation Southern Watch . On 5 March , one of the 707s undertook the first operational aerial tanker mission since the squadron 's re @-@ formation in 1983 , when it refuelled six Panavia Tornados of the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) over Saudi Arabia . The detachment subsequently refuelled US EA @-@ 6 Prowlers , F / A @-@ 18 Hornets , and AV @-@ 8 Harriers , as well as RAF Harriers , in addition to the Tornados . From March to September 2002 , two 707s formed No. 84 Wing Detachment as part of Australia 's contribution to the war in Afghanistan . Located at Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan , the 707s provided aerial refuelling to coalition aircraft operating in the theatre , their efforts earning No. 84 Wing a Meritorious Unit Citation . 
 No. 34 Squadron 's fleet of five Falcon 900s was replaced by two Boeing 737 Business Jets and three Bombardier Challenger 604s in July 2002 . The arrival of the new jets also permitted the Air Force to cease using No. 33 Squadron 's 707s in the VIP transport role . In concert with the No. 84 Wing Navigation Training Aircraft Detachment , No. 32 Squadron completed its conversion from the HS 748 to the Beech King Air 350 in December 2004 . By mid @-@ 2006 , the squadron had been transferred to Air Force Training Group and No. 84 Wing had assumed control of two Richmond @-@ based units from the defunct No. 85 Wing , No. 285 Squadron and the Air Movements Training and Development Unit ( AMTDU ) . No. 285 Squadron undertook instruction of technical staff , and ground @-@ based aircrew training using Hercules and Boeing 707 flight simulators . AMTDU was responsible for developing and disseminating new techniques in air transport operations . It was later moved under the direct control of Headquarters ALG . No. 33 Squadron retired its 707s in June 2008 , and subsequently relocated to Amberley under the control of No. 86 Wing . 
 No. 37 Squadron transferred from No. 86 Wing to No. 84 Wing in October 2010 . It operated a mix of Lockheed C @-@ 130H Hercules and Lockheed Martin C @-@ 130J Super Hercules , No. 86 Wing having consolidated all its C @-@ 130 operations in the one squadron , prior to re @-@ equipping No. 36 Squadron with the Boeing C @-@ 17 Globemaster III . The Hercules , along with Globemasters and King Airs , were employed for flood relief in Queensland and Victoria early in 2011 . In February , Hercules and Globemasters transported medical staff and equipment to aid victims of the Christchurch earthquake . The same year , No. 34 Squadron provided VIP transport during the visits to Australia by Queen Elizabeth II and US President Barack Obama . No. 37 Squadron 's C @-@ 130H Hercules were retired in November 2012 ; the C @-@ 130Js are expected to remain in service until about 2030 . In February 2013 , the RAAF marked ten years rotating a detachment of three C @-@ 130s through the Middle East Area of Operations ( MEAO ) to support the Australian contribution to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , a rotation maintained by No. 37 Squadron under the auspices of No. 84 Wing . Its operations having been absorbed by No. 38 Squadron in 2000 , No. 35 Squadron was re @-@ established under No. 84 Wing on 14 January 2013 , to operate ten Alenia C @-@ 27J Spartan tactical transports out of Richmond . The squadron was transferred to the C @-@ 27J Transition Team on 21 January 2014 , and is expected to return to No. 84 Wing 's control upon the Spartan reaching initial operating capability ; the first of the new aircraft arrived in Australia on 25 June 2015 . On 1 April 2014 , ALG was renamed Air Mobility Group . 
 = Charlie Macartney = 
 Charles George " Charlie " Macartney ( 27 June 1886 – 9 September 1958 ) was an Australian cricketer who played in 35 Tests between 1907 and 1926 . He was known as " The Governor @-@ General " in reference to his authoritative batting style and his flamboyant strokeplay , which drew comparisons with his close friend and role model Victor Trumper , regarded as one of the most elegant batsmen in cricketing history . Sir Donald Bradman — generally regarded as the greatest batsman in history — cited Macartney 's dynamic batting as an inspiration in his cricket career . 
 He started his career as a bowling all @-@ rounder . He made his Test debut in 1907 , primarily as a left arm orthodox spinner who was considered to be a useful lower @-@ middle order right @-@ hand batsman . As Macartney was initially selected for his flexibility , his position in the batting order was frequently shuffled and he was largely ineffective . His most noteworthy Test contribution in his early career was a match @-@ winning ten wicket haul at Headingley in 1909 , before being dropped in the 1910 – 11 Australian season . It was around this time that Macartney befriended Trumper and began to transform himself from a bowler who batted in a defensive and technically correct manner , into an audacious attacking batsman . He reclaimed his Test position and made his maiden Test century in the same season , before establishing himself as the leading batsman in the team . 
 The First World War stopped all first @-@ class cricket and Macartney enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force . Upon the resumption of cricket , Macartney stamped himself as one of the leading batsmen in the world with his performances during the 1921 Ashes tour . Macartney produced an Australian record score in England of 345 against Nottinghamshire . The innings was the fastest triple century in first @-@ class cricket and the highest score made by a batsman in a single day of play . He reached 300 in 205 minutes and the innings took less than four hours . Macartney topped the batting averages and run @-@ scoring aggregates , which saw him named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1922 . Wisden said that he was , " by many degrees the most brilliant and individual Australian batsman of the present day " . After missing the 1924 – 25 series due to mental illness or a recurrence of war injuries , Macartney departed international cricket at the peak of his powers on the 1926 tour of England . He became the second Australian to score a century in the first session of a Test match , and did so on a sticky wicket conducive to bowling . This was part of a sequence of three consecutive Test centuries as he led the batting charts . Macartney was posthumously inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2007 . 
 = = Style = = 
 Macartney 's flair was compared to that of Victor Trumper , and his determination to that of Don Bradman , who is generally regarded as the finest batsman in cricketing history . His style was quite different from that of Trumper , but he generated fascination with his Trumper @-@ like daring and supreme confidence . Self @-@ taught to a greater extent than anyone else in Australia or England in his era , the 1922 Wisden Almanack described Macartney as " a triumph to individualism ... he is not a model to be copied " and " one of the most brilliant and attractive right @-@ handed batsmen in the history of Australian cricket " . His success was largely attributed to his eye , hand and foot co @-@ ordination . 
 Macartney was a short man , standing 160 cm ( 5 " 3 ) . When batting , he would unconventionally attempt to leg glance yorkers pitched on middle stump down to fine @-@ leg , and often lost his wicket in so doing . He was known for preferring his team @-@ mates to give him candid criticism rather than praise . In later life he condemned modern batsmen ; he would explain why he no longer watched cricket by saying " I can 't bear watching luscious half @-@ volleys being nudged gently back to bowlers " . Sir Neville Cardus wrote that " there was always chivalry in his cricket , a prancing sort of heroism . The <unk> of his play , the brave beauty and the original skill bring tears to my eyes yet . " In the late 1940s , Macartney received a letter from a compiler of Who 's Who in Australia , seeking information on his life . Macartney said that he had " no record of figures , nor am I concerned with them . My only interest is the manner in which the runs are compiled and how wickets are taken , and in the good of the game . " " Those sentiments " , wrote former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton , " summed up the cricket story of C. G. Macartney " . 
 An authoritative , combative stylist , Macartney 's élan and devastating strokemaking led Kent cricketer Kenneth Hutchings to dub him " The Governor @-@ General " . Fingleton noted that , early in his innings , Macartney had a strategy of aiming a shot straight at the bowler 's head , in order to rattle him and seize a psychological advantage . On one occasion , after reaching a century before lunch on the first day of a match , he immediately called for a bat change . He selected the heaviest bat from the batch that his team @-@ mate brought out and stated " Now I 'm going to have a hit " . His rate of scoring and boundary @-@ hitting subsequently increased . He possessed powerful hands , strong forearms and broad shoulders . Leg spinning Test team @-@ mate Arthur Mailey recalled that Macartney would often hit him for six in Sydney Grade Cricket matches . Grinning , he would say " Pitch another one there and I 'll hit you for a few more " . On the occasions when he lost his wicket attempting further long hits , Macartney 's grin remained , and he would remark " Wasn 't it good fun ? " The famed cricket writer RC Robertson @-@ Glasgow said 
 No other Australian batsman , not even Bradman , has approached Macartney for insolence of attack . He made slaves of bowlers . His batting suggested a racket player who hits winners from any position . Length could not curb him , and his defence was lost and included in his attack . 
 As a bowler , Macartney delivered the ball at a relatively fast pace for a left @-@ arm orthodox spinner , comparable in speed to Derek Underwood . He was known for his consistent length and his well @-@ concealed faster ball which often caught batsmen off guard . On sticky wickets , he was often incisive , and these conditions helped him take five wickets in an innings 17 times in his first @-@ class career . He was known for his miserly attitude , often giving the impression that he would rather bowl ten consecutive maidens rather than take wickets if it meant conceding runs . This extended to his off @-@ field activities , where he was considered careful with money . On the 1926 tour of England , he and Mailey visited a hat shop that had a tradition of giving souvenir hats to cricketers of touring Australian squads . When asked if he would like a similar style to the one he received in 1921 , Macartney referred to the hat on his head and replied " Not on your life . I 've been wearing this since you gave it to me in 1921 . " Macartney 's notorious fiscal obsessions irritated his captain Warwick Armstrong on the 1921 tour ; during the trip , he would hoard all manner of goods that were given to the team as gifts . 
 In 1909 , Australian team @-@ mate Trumper moved from Paddington , a suburb on Sydney 's south shore to Chatswood on the northern side of the harbour , where Macartney lived . Macartney and Trumper played together for Gordon Cricket Club on the north shore and became close friends . Macartney regularly practised on the Trumper family 's backyard turf pitch . Trumper 's relocation made more frequent meetings possible , since the Sydney Harbour Bridge was not to open until 1932 , and the only way of travelling between either side of the bay was by ferry . Trumper was regarded as the " crown prince of the golden age of cricket " , the finest and most stylish batsman of his era , and one of the most elegant <unk> of all time . Under Trumper 's influence , Macartney became more audacious and adventurous ; Unlike their English counterparts , the Australians were proud of their spontaneous play . Macartney revered Trumper as both a cricketer and a person , and was to be a pall bearer when Trumper died in 1915 at the age of 37 . However , unlike Trumper , Macartney was known for his habit of " walking " , the act of leaving the ground before or contrary to an umpire 's decision if a batsman knows that he is out . On one occasion , Macartney felt so guilty that the umpire had incorrectly ruled him not out despite a clear edge that he attempted to throw his wicket away with a wild airborne shot . However , the ball went for six , and Trumper , his batting partner at the time , admonished him , saying that his good luck would be balanced by occasions when the umpire would give him out incorrectly .

He was taught to play cricket as a child by his maternal grandfather George Moore , a slow roundarm bowler who represented New South Wales in three first @-@ class matches against Victoria . The equipment consisted of small hand @-@ crafted bat made from cedar , and apples from the family orchard used as balls . 
 In 1898 , Macartney and his family moved from Maitland to Sydney . In his school cricketing career Macartney distinguished himself as an all @-@ rounder at Woollahra Superior and Chatswood public schools , before briefly attending Fort Street High School . Macartney asserted that school cricket was insignificant in his development , believing that he learned more about cricket during informal summer cricket games with his brother at the local park , with their dog acting as a fielder . It was during his school career that Macartney was noticed by incumbent Australian captain Monty Noble , who heaped praise on him in a newspaper article . 
 After leaving school , Macartney worked for a fruit and vegetable merchant near Sydney 's Sussex Street docks , honing his batting skills by practising without pads on a wooden wharf during his lunch break . At this stage in his career , he possessed a <unk> technique and defensive style , something he was to discard for an audacious , self @-@ styled and attacking outlook . 
 In 1902 , Macartney joined North Sydney Cricket Club in the first division of Sydney Grade Cricket and then moved to the Gordon club in the outer northern suburbs when it was formed during the 1905 – 06 season . He played regularly for Gordon until 1933 – 34 when he was 47 , amassing <unk> runs at an average of 54 @.@ 62 . He was known for his dominant status at the Chatswood Oval . In one match , he lofted a ball out of the ground , over a railway line and onto an adjacent lawn bowling green , forcing the players to take evasive action . 
 = = First @-@ class debut = = 
 Macartney 's exploits were noticed by the State selectors , and he made his first class debut for New South Wales against Queensland at the start of the 1905 – 06 season . He made 56 in New South Wales ' first innings of 691 , and after not bowling in the first innings , he took 3 / 80 and his first catch in an innings victory . He then scored 70 not out in an innings triumph over South Australia . He failed to pass 25 in his remaining four matches for the season , but took at least one wicket in each game . In one match for his state against an Australian XI , Macartney took a total of 5 / 123 , including the wickets of Trumper and Australian Test captains Noble and Joe Darling . He was also run out in both innings . Aside from this match , New South Wales were victorious in the remaining five fixtures . He scored 185 runs at 26 @.@ 43 and took 15 wickets at 28 @.@ 20 in six matches . 
 Macartney continued his rise with a more productive and consistent second season with both the ball and bat . In his second match in 1906 – 07 , Macartney broke through for his first century , scoring 122 before taking match figures of 4 / 92 in an innings win over Queensland . In the next match , he took his first five @-@ wicket innings haul , recording figures of 5 / 18 and 2 / 17 in an innings win over South Australia , including leading Test batsman Clem Hill twice . Macartney took wickets in each match ; he ended the season with 405 runs at 40 @.@ 50 , with two further fifties , and took 30 wickets at 18 @.@ 20 in nine matches . 
 The following season , in 1907 – 08 , saw the arrival of England for a Test series . Macartney had a chance to stake his claim for national selection in a match for his state against the tourists . He made 9 and 13 , unbeaten in both innings , as his partners were dismissed cheaply and left him stranded . New South Wales made 101 and 96 and lost by 408 runs , with Macartney taking a total of 1 / 64 . He was selected for an Australian XI to play the tourists in an effective dress rehearsal for the Tests , and made 42 and took 4 / 36 in a drawn match . As a result , Macartney was selected to make his debut against England in the First Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground . He was viewed as a utility player , selected for the flexibility in his batting position and his left arm orthodox spin . 
 = = Test debut = = 
 Macartney had a moderately successful debut . He bowled three wicketless overs in the first innings , before scoring 35 in Australia 's reply while batting at No. 7 . He took one wicket , that of leading English batsman Wilfred Rhodes . With Australia needing 274 runs to win in the second innings , Noble decided that Macartney 's first innings effort warranted promotion to act as Trumper 's opening partner . He managed to score only nine , but Australia managed to scrape home to seal a two wicket victory . Macartney 's domestic form after his Test debut was sufficient for him to retain his position for the Second Test in Melbourne . Noble persevered with Macartney as Trumper 's opening partner and he scored 37 of an 84 run opening partnership in the first innings . He returned to the middle order in the second innings to score 54 and took a total of 1 / 55 as England squared the series with a narrow one wicket victory . 
 His most productive batting of the series came in the Third Test in Adelaide , when he scored 75 batting at No. 3 and took two wickets for 66 runs ( 2 / 66 ) in an Australian victory . His batting was largely ineffectual in the last two Tests ; he failed to score more than 30 in any innings as he was moved to No. 8 and then back to the opening position in the Fifth Test . Despite his confused role as a batsman , he contributed with the ball in the Fifth Test victory on a pitch amenable to spin , taking match figures of 5 / 66 . His first international series had yielded 273 runs at an average of 27 @.@ 30 and ten wickets at an average of 26 @.@ 60 . He tasted victory , with Australia taking the series 4 – 0 . His highest score of the season was 96 against England in a later match for New South Wales . The hosts were 12 runs short of victory with one wicket in hand when time ran out . Macartney scored 524 runs at 27 @.@ 58 and took 25 wickets at 28 @.@ 76 in 12 matches . In spite of his unsettled role in the batting line up , Macartney had performed well @-@ enough as an all @-@ rounder in the following domestic season in 1908 – 09 to be selected for the 1909 tour of England , his first overseas tour . Macartney took a total of 6 / 60 in an innings victory over South Australia in the first match of the season . He then scored 100 in the return match , and ended the six matches of the summer with 319 runs at 53 @.@ 17 and nine wickets at 29 @.@ 89 . 
 = = First tour of England = = 
 Macartney started his tour of England by taking match figures of 5 / 86 in a nine @-@ wicket win over Northamptonshire . He took at least two wickets in each of the five matches leading up to the Tests , with 5 / 24 against Oxford University . He totalled 17 wickets at 15 @.@ 18 and scored 141 runs at 28 @.@ 20 . 
 Macartney took 3 / 21 in the first innings of the First Test , removing captain Archie MacLaren , CB Fry and leading batsman Jack Hobbs , but managed only 0 / 35 in the second innings as England scored 0 / 105 to win by ten innings . He then scored five and was wicketless as Australia leveled the series with a nine @-@ wicket win in the Second Test . He then scored 124 , his only century of the tour , in a non @-@ first @-@ class match against Western Union . 
 His bowling confounded the English team in the Third Test at Headingley in Leeds , where he took 7 / 58 in the first innings and 4 / 27 in the second . It was his best innings and match bowling figures in Tests and helped win the Test and eventually retain The Ashes . Australia had struggled to post 188 in their first innings on a pitch conducive to spin bowling , with Macartney scoring only four . Australia responded with a dual spin attack , with Noble bowling off spin in tandem with Macartney 's left arm orthodox . Noble ( 0 / 22 from 13 overs ) tied down the batsman , allowing Macartney to attack at batsman at the other end . He bowled with a high trajectory , tempting the batsmen to attack him and then varied his bowling speed to surprise them . He had Jack Sharp stumped after luring him from the crease and bowled Jack Hobbs with a faster ball . Other victims included English captain MacLaren , JT Tyldesley , George Hirst and Sydney Barnes . England were bowled out for 182 and Australia replied with 207 ; Macartney scored 18 . Australia went on to win by 126 runs after Macartney took four more wickets in the second innings , removing MacLaren , Tyldesley , Rhodes and Barnes to help dismiss the hosts for 87 . Macartney then made a half @-@ century and took a wicket in each of the last two Tests , both of which were drawn to hand Australia a 2 – 1 series win . 
 Macartney 's batting in the Test series was largely unsuccessful . He made two fifties , but otherwise failed to pass 20 and ended with 153 runs at 19 @.@ 13 . In his era , the expectation was that batsmen would be able to bat in a variety of positions and Macartney was gradually moved from seventh down to tenth in the batting order by the end of the tour . Largely due to his efforts at Headingley , his bowling figures were more impressive ; he ended the Tests with 16 wickets at 16 @.@ 13 . At this stage of his career , Macartney was regarded as a bowling all @-@ rounder . He was only eighth on the batting averages for the tour , with 503 first @-@ class runs at 16 @.@ 77 , but took 71 wickets at an average of 17 @.@ 46 in eight matches . 
 Upon returning to the southern hemisphere , Macartney headed to New Zealand for a stint with Otago instead of playing in Australia in 1909 – 10 , due to attractiveness of the foreign outfit 's remuneration . The period was unsuccessful for Otago — all three matches were lost — but Macartney was prolific as an individual . He took match figures of 7 / 68 against Canterbury and 7 / 81 in the first innings of a game against Australia , removing Test teammates Warwick Armstrong and Warren Bardsley . He ended with 17 wickets at 17 @.@ 53 and scored 132 runs at 22 @.@ 00 . 
 Macartney started poorly in the home series against the touring South Africans in the Test series of 1910 – 11 . In the first three Tests , he accumulated 15 runs in five innings and took a solitary wicket . As a result , he was dropped for the Fourth Test . Up to this point he had not passed 45 in 13 innings for the season and taken only seven wickets in seven matches . He then made 119 and 126 for New South Wales against South Africa and took match figures of 4 / 155 as the tourists fell to a 44 @-@ run defeat . This prompted the selectors to restore him to the Test team , and Macartney bounced back with his first Test century , making 137 in the first innings and 56 in the second in just 40 minutes , as Australia completed a seven @-@ wicket win . It was his third century in as many first class innings . The late @-@ season hat @-@ trick of centuries pushed Macartney 's season total to 609 runs at 33 @.@ 83 and 10 wickets at 54 @.@ 90 in ten matches . 
 The 1911 – 12 season started strongly for Macartney . He scored 122 and took 5 / 81 as New South Wales defeated Queensland by an innings . However , the season went downhill from there ; Macartney failed to pass 30 in the next ten innings and took only three wickets in the next six matches . As a result , he was left out of the playing XI and made twelfth man for the first three Tests against the touring England team . 
 = = Omission and recall in 1912 = = 
 Macartney 's omission was part of the most infamous disputes in Australian cricket history and led to a fracas . Australian captain and selector Clem Hill wanted to include Macartney for the Third Test , but another member of the panel , former player Peter McAlister objected and said that Hill should omit himself if he wanted Macartney to play . Tensions between the two selectors were high , and came to a head in a selection meeting ahead of the Fourth Test . McAlister criticised Hill 's tactics and policies towards his bowlers , provoking an exchange of insults regarding the other 's leadership ability . Hill then bloodied McAlister with a powerful blow to the nose and the ensuing brawl lasted between 10 and 20 minutes . Furniture was knocked across the room , artwork shattered and Hill had to be restrained from throwing McAlister out of the third floor window , before resigning as a selector . 
 Eventually , Macartney was recalled for the Fifth Test against England and scored 26 and 27 and took a total of 1 / 54 in a defeat . Macartney scored 300 runs at 27 @.@ 27 and took nine wickets at 32 @.@ 78 in eight first @-@ class matches for the season . Macartney wrote later that " persistent ill @-@ feeling seriously affected the morale of the side " . 
 Macartney then toured England for the 1912 Triangular Test Tournament , which also included South Africa . He was not in the original touring party , but six senior players including Hill and vice @-@ captain Warwick Armstrong and leading batsman Victor Trumper withdrew from the tour due to a dispute with the board . Macartney was thus given a late call @-@ up . 
 Macartney scored 84 but the tourists started on a bad note , losing to Nottinghamshire . He then scored 127 against Northamptonshire , 208 against Essex , 123 and 25 not out against Surrey and 74 against the Marylebone Cricket Club in four consecutive matches . Australia won the first two by an innings and the latter two by seven and five wickets respectively . Up to this point , Macartney had only claimed a solitary wicket . He then took match figures of 6 / 60 in a ten @-@ wicket win over Oxford University . 
 Australia then defeated South Africa in their first Test of the tournament . Macartney made 21 in an innings victory and did not bowl . Macartney 's batting waned in the next seven tour matches , passing 50 only three times in ten innings . However , he did take 13 wickets , including 6 / 54 against Yorkshire . Macartney then scored 99 in a drawn Test against England at Lord 's that did not reach the second innings . Wisden regarded the innings as his best for the season . Macartney added half @-@ centuries in consecutive county matches and after three further matches without passing 21 , the Tests resumed . 
 Macartney scored nine and took 3 / 29 in a ten @-@ wicket win over South Africa , and then scored 142 and 121 in the next match against Sussex . The next Test against England was then washed out in the first innings ; Macartney neither batted nor bowled . The following match against South Africa did not reach the second innings and Australia then lost to England by 244 runs in the final , with Macartney taking a total of 2 / 67 and scoring four and 30 . It was a barren August for Macartney , who did not pass 35 and took only six wickets in six first @-@ class matches . However , he finished the tour strongly , scoring 176 against the South of England and 71 against CB Fry 's XI in the last two matches . 
 Macartney scored 2 @,@ 207 runs during the tour at an average of 45 @.@ 04 . During the English season , he reached the peak of his performance as an all @-@ rounder , taking 38 wickets . He made six centuries , including two in one match against Sussex . Apart from his 99 at Lord 's , Macartney did not pass 34 in the other Tests and ended with 197 runs at 32 @.@ 83 . He did not bowl heavily during the series , taking six wickets at 23 @.@ 66 . It was not a happy tour for the Australians ; without the senior players , there were frequent reports of drunken brawls and verbal abuse towards the locals . Macartney was one of only four players to accept the guaranteed tour fee of 400 pounds ; the others signed up to a percentage share of the profits and the commercial failure of the tour left them with less than half of the flat fee . 
 There were no further Test matches before the First World War . The 1912 – 13 Australian season was a short one for Macartney , but he was in rare form , scoring 125 , 96 , 94 , 76 not out , 91 , 10 and 154 in four matches , to total 646 runs at 107 @.@ 66 . He also took four wickets at 30 @.@ 50 . 
 During an unofficial tour of the Australian team to the United States and Canada during the off season in 1913 , which consisted of more than 50 matches , the overwhelming majority of which were not first @-@ class , Macartney scored 2 @,@ 390 runs at 45 @.@ 92 and took 189 wickets at 3 @.@ 81 , topping both the batting and bowling averages . He also made the most centuries ( seven ) and the highest individual score of 186 against a combined Canada and United States team . Macartney played in only five first @-@ class matches and scored two centuries in these fixtures . In two non @-@ first @-@ class matches , he took 11 / 23 and 10 / 29 in an innings . 
 The 1913 – 14 domestic season was to be the last season of cricket before the outbreak of World War I. Macartney captained New South Wales for the first time against Tasmania . He had another prolific season with the bat ; in six matches he scored 892 runs at 111 @.@ 50 in nine innings . He scored 201 in an innings victory over Victoria , four other centuries including a 195 , and two fifties . With Macartney in such form , five of the matches were won by an innings , and another by nine wickets . The record was blotted only by a loss to South Australia by 19 runs . Macartney took two wickets at 32 @.@ 50 . Macartney was selected for the five @-@ Test tour of South Africa in 1914 – 15 , but the campaign was called off due to the war . 
 Despite his success on the field , Macartney still had a regular job outside of cricket , as with most cricketers of the era . In 1914 , he left his job on the Sydney wharves and joined the staff of New South Wales Railways & Tramways in the Chief Mechanical Engineer 's Office at Redfern . The following season , he scored 191 runs at 38 @.@ 20 including a century in three matches . He did not take a wicket . 
 = = Post @-@ war Test career = = 
 World War I interrupted Macartney 's career as competitive cricket was cancelled . In January 1916 , he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) . In July 1917 he was posted to France as a temporary Warrant Officer in the 3rd Division Artillery . In 1918 , he was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal for gallantry and reached the rank of corporal . The death of his father later in the year led to his repatriation from Britain and prevented his appearance with the AIF cricket team . 
 The war years divided Macartney 's career in two . Prior to the war , he was primarily known as a bowling all @-@ rounder . In 21 Tests , he had taken 34 wickets at 26 and scored 879 runs at 27 , with one century . After the war , Macartney transformed himself into one of the greatest batsmen of his era . In his 14 post @-@ war Tests , he scored 1 @,@ 252 runs at nearly 70 , with six centuries . His bowling became more sporadic , taking just 11 more wickets , averaging 32 . 
 Macartney resumed Test cricket when Australia hosted England in 1920 – 21 , and was one of only four players remaining from before the war . However , he only played in two of the Tests due to illness and injury . His early season form was ominous for the tourists . Macartney scored 161 in guiding New South Wales to a successful run @-@ chase of 4 / 335 over the Englishmen . He then scored 96 and 30 for an Australian XI against the tourists in a dress rehearsal for the Tests . 
 In the First Test , playing as an opening batsman , he struck 19 in the first innings . Australia 's new post @-@ war skipper Warwick Armstrong felt that Macartney would be more effective at number three , and in the second innings , he made a free @-@ flowing 69 in a 111 @-@ run second @-@ wicket stand with Herbie Collins as Australia went on to inflict a 377 @-@ run defeat . Macartney 's return to form was interrupted by an illness , which caused him to miss the following three Test matches . After a two @-@ month layoff , Macartney struck 130 in a match for his state against England . 
 He returned for the Fifth and final Test , where he recorded his highest Test innings of 170 on his home ground , the Sydney Cricket Ground . Among the spectators was a 12 @-@ year @-@ old Don Bradman , who had been taken to watch Macartney by his father . Eight decades later , Bradman recalled the innings , " as if it were yesterday " , describing it as full of " delicate leg @-@ glances , powerful pulls , cuts and glorious drives " and concluding that it was one of the best innings he had seen in his lifetime . Bradman cited the innings as an inspiration for his career . Macartney headed the Australian Test averages with 260 runs at 86 @.@ 66 as Australia won the Ashes 5 – 0 . It was the only such Ashes whitewash until 2006 – 07 . Macartney has amassed 821 runs at 68 @.@ 42 for the season . He took only three wickets at 56 @.@ 33 . 
 = = Wisden Cricketer of the Year = = 
 On the 1921 Ashes tour , Macartney — who needed a special medical clearance before being selected — had a chance to rectify his poor batting performances of his pre @-@ war tours of England . In his first match , against Leicestershire , he started strongly with 177 @.@ his fast scoring helped Australia complete an innings victory in just over half the allotted playing time . He scored 87 against Surrey , 51 against Combined Services and 77 against Oxford University in the next seven matches leading up to the start of the Tests , with a total of 539 runs at 53 @.@ 90 under his belt . 
 Macartney made 20 in the first innings and was unbeaten on 22 , playing as an opener , as Australia completed a ten @-@ wicket win in the First Test . It was Australia 's sixth consecutive Test win over England . He failed to pass 20 in the next two county matches , but did take 2 / 19 against Middlesex , his first wickets on tour . This came in his 11th match on tour and was a reflection of his role as a specialist batsman in the post @-@ war years . The next game against Gloucestershire heralded the start of a rich vein of run @-@ scoring during the remainder of June . Macartney scored 149 , in an Australian innings noted for elegant strokeplay and big hitting , after managing only 31 and eight in the eight @-@ wicket win in the Second Test , hit three consecutive centuries . 
 Macartney hit 105 as Australia amassed 7 / 708 declared against Hampshire and then made 193 as Australia compiled 621 and defeated Northamptonshire by an innings and 484 runs . The two matches were separated by a match against Surrey , which Macartney missed due to injury . In the latter match , Macartney came in at first drop after the hosts took a wicket from the first ball of the match , and he scored 193 of the 318 runs scored while he was in the middle . Macartney took only 135 minutes and hit 31 fours as Australia added more than 300 in just over two hours of batting . Such was the dominance of Macartney and the rest of Armstrong 's men that they disposed of Northamptonshire in less than two days . However , his most famed innings was yet to come . 
 In the next match , Macartney scored 345 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in 232 minutes , with 47 fours and four sixes . Macartney had an inauspicious start to the day , coming to the crease after the dismissal of Warren Bardsley with only one run scored . He attacked immediately and was dropped in the slips when on nine runs . The missed chance further emboldened Macartney , who had a philosophy that being dropped was a signal that it was his day to shine . He proceeded to exhibit his full repertoire of strokes . After reaching his double century in only 150 minutes , Macartney signalled to the pavilion . When Nottinghamshire captain Arthur Carr asked him if he was seeking a drink , Macartney said that he wanted a heavier bat and indicated that he was going to attack . Macartney kept his promise , adding his next 100 runs in only 48 minutes to reach 300 in 198 minutes . At the time , it was the fastest triple century in first @-@ class cricket in terms of minutes . It still stands as the highest innings by an Australian in England , and at the time was the most runs scored by any batsman in one day . During the innings , Macartney partnered Nip Pellew in a partnership of 291 . Australia went on to score 675 and won by an innings and 517 runs , in only two days , the largest winning margin achieved by Australia in a first @-@ class match . The cricket writer Sumner Reid described Macartney 's innings as : 
 the most destructive innings I ever saw in England or Australia . Not Trumper at his brilliant best , nor even Bradman in his calculated genius , ever performed with more unadulterated , murderous power and masterful technique . 
 In the space of four days , Macartney had scored 538 runs , and for the month of June , he had totalled 913 runs at 91 @.@ 30 . He carried this form into the next Test . 
 In the Third Test at Headingley , he made his first Test century on foreign soil , striking 115 in the first innings . It was a relatively sedate innings for his standards , but helped Australia to victory by 191 runs and an unassailable 3 – 0 series lead . It gave Warwick Armstrong 's men an eighth consecutive Test win , which remained a world record for more than five decades until surpassed by the West Indies cricket team of the 1980s . The cricket writer Gideon Haigh said that " It was like watching the armies of succeeding generations in combat , artillery , and tank against sword and horse " . 
 Macartney had a quiet time over the next month , passing fifty only once in the next eight innings in seven matches . He also ended his wicket @-@ taking drought , claiming six in three matches after almost two months without success . He returned to form with 72 against Warwickshire and 155 in the next match against Kent . 
 Macartney finished with 61 in the drawn Fifth Test at The Oval , to head the run @-@ scoring with 300 runs at 42 @.@ 85 as Australia took the series 3 – 0 . He did not take a wicket in the Tests . Macartney then scored 121 against Gloucestershire in an innings victory immediately after the Tests , but did not pass 45 in the remaining four matches of the tour . Macartney topped the batting aggregates and averages with 2 @,@ 317 runs at 59 @.@ 41 in the first @-@ class matches . He took only eight wickets at 32 @.@ 63 for the entire tour . 
 Macartney 's efforts during the 1921 English summer led to his being named as one of the 1922 Wisden Cricketers of the Year . Wisden stated that Macartney was " by many degrees the most brilliant and individual Australian batsman of the present day " . 
 On the journey back to the southern hemisphere , Australia stopped for its first ever Test tour of South Africa . Macartney warmed up with 135 in a victory over Natal . The cricket writer Jack Pollard described Macartney 's hitting as " powerful , almost arrogant " . Macartney then scored 59 and 116 in an aggressive display in the First Test in Durban , which was drawn , with the hosts hanging on with only three wickets in hand . After missing the Second Test due to fitness reasons , Macartney returned against Western Province . He took 5 / 40 in the first innings , his first five @-@ wicket innings since June 1912 , nine and a half years earlier . 
 In the Third Test in Cape Town , Macartney scored 44 , before taking 5 / 44 in the second innings to ensure that Australia would only have to chase a solitary run . He bowled three of his victims and removed Billy <unk> twice . The hosts struggled against the dual spin of Macartney and Mailey . Australians went on to secure a ten @-@ wicket victory . Macartney finished the Test series with seven wickets at 14 @.@ 86 . He totalled 492 runs at 70 @.@ 28 and 14 wickets at 17 @.@ 14 for the tour , against topping the batting averages . 
 Macartney started the 1922 – 23 season strongly , scoring 63 and 84 and taking 2 / 8 in a five @-@ wicket win over the touring MCC in the first match of the summer . He only passed fifty once more in the season and took 5 / 8 in an innings against Victoria . Macartney totalled 350 runs at 29 @.@ 16 and 12 wickets at 12 @.@ 16 in eight matches for the season . The next Australian season was a shortened one for New South Wales . Macartney scored 174 runs at 21 @.@ 75 and took seven wickets at 21 @.@ 14 in four matches before his state embarked on a tour of New Zealand . 
 Macartney struck form immediately , scoring 80 and 120 in the opening match against Wellington . He followed this with 100 ( in a non @-@ first @-@ class match ) , 120 against Otago and 221 in the next match against Canterbury , all in consecutive innings . He added match figures of 4 / 38 as New South Wales defeated Canterbury by an innings . Macartney then scored 36 and 55 not out and took match figures of 4 / 55 in an eight @-@ wicket win over New Zealand . He made only two and seven in the remaining first @-@ class matches , and ended with 13 wickets at 20 @.@ 92 . 
 Macartney missed the 1924 – 25 Test series when England toured Australia . He played in only two first @-@ class matches in the early stages of the season , scoring 11 runs at 3 @.@ 66 and taking five wickets at 23 @.@ 40 . The withdrawal of Macartney from competition was attributed to a flare @-@ up of an injury he had suffered during World War I , but sceptics believed that he had suffered a nervous breakdown . 
 Following his year off , Macartney returned to full @-@ time cricket in 1925 – 26 . He re @-@ established himself in his first match , scoring 114 and taking a total of 4 / 49 as New South Wales crushed Western Australia by an innings and 235 runs . Macartney then scored 84 and 28 to help the Rest of Australia defeat the national team by 156 runs . He then scored two centuries as New South Wales won all four of their Sheffield Shield matches , three by an innings . Up to this point , Macartney had scored 582 runs at 72 @.@ 75 and taken 20 wickets at 20 @.@ 30 . This was enough for him to be selected for the 1926 tour of England . His most notable performance with the ball was his 7 / 85 and 2 / 16 in an innings victory over arch @-@ rivals Victoria . His wickets included batsmen Bill Woodfull ( twice ) , Bill Ponsford , Jack Ryder and all rounder Hunter Hendry , who played alongside him in the 1926 Tests . Following his selection for the England tour , Macartney warmed up by scoring 66 and 163 not out and taking a total of 4 / 48 in consecutive innings victories for the Australian touring party over Tasmania . 
 = = International farewell = = 
 Macartney 's international farewell on the 1926 tour of England saw him at the peak of his batting powers . Unlike the previous tour in 1921 , Macartney was also prominent with the ball . 
 During the opening first @-@ class fixture against Leicestershire , Macartney scored only two but took 5 / 9 in a rain @-@ affected draw . In the next match against Essex , another rain @-@ affected draw , he starred with the bat , scoring 148 . In the third match , another draw against Surrey , Macartney combined both of his skills and scored 53 and took 6 / 63 in the first innings . His victims included English Test batsmen Jack Hobbs and Percy Fender . He then took 3 / 21 and 4 / 57 as Australia beat Hampshire to record their first win of the season . In nine matches before the First Test , Macartney scored 379 runs at 42 @.@ 11 and took 30 wickets at 13 @.@ 20 . 
 The First Test at Trent Bridge was washed out , with England scoring 0 / 32 in the only innings of the match . Macartney then scored 54 as Australia made 6 / 148 in the only innings of another wet match against Yorkshire . He then hit form ahead of the Second Test , scoring 160 and taking a total of 5 / 34 in an innings win over Lancashire . 
 After scoring 39 in the first innings in the Second Test at Lord 's , Macartney took 1 / 90 , removing centurion Jack Hobbs as England took a 92 @-@ run first innings lead . He then scored 133 not out in the second innings , to help to stave off defeat . Australia were 5 / 194 when the match ended , and were it not for Macartney 's effort could have been bowled out . 
 Between Tests , Macartney scored 42 and 81 against Northamptonshire and Nottinghamshire respectively before taking 5 / 38 against Worcestershire . Australia won all three matches . 
 In the Third Test at Headingley , Macartney became only the second Australian to score a century before lunch on the opening day of a Test . The match started poorly for Australia . English captain Arthur Carr won the toss and sent Australia in to bat after a thunderstorm on the previous day had turned the surface into a sticky wicket ; Bardsley was then dismissed by the first ball for a golden duck . Macartney strode to the crease , surveyed the fielding positions and called down the wicket to the bowler Maurice Tate " Let 's have it ! " He nearly regretted his comment when he edged the ball to Carr at third slip from the fifth ball of the day . It was a difficult chance but the English skipper failed to hold the ball . Macartney was then on two . Within a few minutes , he had regained the initiative for the Australians . 
 Utilising both conventional technique and audacious shots , Macartney pierced the field with a variety of cuts , hooks , pulls , drives and glances . He teased the fielders with deliberate deflections through the slips ; his late cuts were described by Raymond Robertson @-@ Glasgow as being " so late they are almost posthumous " . Macartney 's attack helped his partner Bill Woodfull to settle in the difficult conditions . Macartney saved his severest hitting for George Macaulay , a medium pace swing bowler and off spinner whom he regarded as England 's most potent bowler . Macartney had asked for and received permission from captain Herbie Collins to target Macaulay 's bowling . By the end of the Australian innings , Macaulay had figures of 1 / 123 and was never to play against Australia again . Macartney 's confidence was such that he charged down the pitch to meet the medium pace bowlers , a dangerous tactic on a surface with erratic bounce . 
 He reached 40 in as many minutes as Australia 's total reached 50 . Australia reached 100 in only 79 minutes with Macartney contributing 83 of those runs . Macartney reached his century in 103 minutes with the tourists on 131 . By lunch , he had scored 112 in 116 minutes and he continued until the score reached 1 / 235 , when he hit Macaulay to Patsy Hendren and was dismissed , having amassed 151 in 170 minutes . Former English captain Sir Pelham Warner said " I say without hesitation that I have never seen a greater innings ... not even the immortal Victor Trumper could have played more finely " . Macartney 's innings allowed Australia to accumulate a healthy first innings total of 494 . He then took 2 / 51 , removing Carr and Fender as England made 294 and were forced to follow on ; however , the Australians could not dismiss the hosts for a second time and the match ended in a draw . 
 Macartney then made 106 in a non @-@ first @-@ class match against the West of Scotland , before hitting 109 in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford in a rain @-@ affected draw ; the match failed to reach the second innings . Macartney had scored three centuries in as many innings . 
 Macartney 's form tailed off thereafter ; in the following six weeks , he made only one score beyond 40 in 11 innings and took only three wickets in nine matches . This included the Fifth Test , when he scored 25 and 16 and failed to take a wicket as England won the Test by 289 runs and with it the Ashes . Macartney topped the batting averages with 473 runs at 94 @.@ 60 and took four wickets at 53 @.@ 75 . Macartney returned to form in the final first @-@ class fixture of the season with an unbeaten 100 against and England XI . 
 Macartney decided to retire from Tests after the tour . He had taken part in twelve Test century partnerships , the highest being 235 with Woodfull in the Leeds Test .

 After his return to Australia , Macartney continued to play club cricket and turned out for a final first @-@ class summer . At the start of the 1926 – 27 season , he captained a combined Sydney City team against a New South Wales country team , which included the then 18 @-@ year @-@ old Bradman . Macartney scored 126 and Bradman 98 in a match viewed as a generational transition in Australian batting . He scored 114 in his opening first @-@ class match of the season , and took wickets in each of his four matches . Macartney totalled 243 runs at 40 @.@ 50 and took 11 wickets at 17 @.@ 82 . 
 In mid @-@ 1927 he toured Singapore and Malaya with Bert Oldfield 's team and played in a series of non @-@ first @-@ class matches against local teams . In October 1929 , he played for a New South Wales Cricket Association team against a series of local teams in the state 's rural west . 
 In 1935 – 36 , Macartney was vice @-@ captain to Jack Ryder , on the tour of India organised by Frank Tarrant ; he also wrote forthright columns for The Hindu , covering the trip . At the time , India had only received its first official tour , by England , and Australia was not keen on sending a Test team there . Thus , while the Test team were in South Africa , Tarrant 's party consisted mainly of retired Test cricketers in their mid @-@ 40s and beyond . 
 In his return to first @-@ class cricket after nine years , Macartney took 5 / 17 and 3 / 42 in the first international match against India , which the Australians won by eight wickets . He went wicketless as the series was squared in the second match , before taking 3 / 52 and 6 / 41 in the final match . Despite his nine wickets , Australia lost by 34 runs . Other notable performances included an 85 against Bengal and 3 / 45 and 3 / 47 against Madras . In the latter match , Macartney added 39 as the Australians scraped home by one wicket .

 Macartney married Anna Bruce , a schoolteacher , at Chatswood Presbyterian Church in December 1921 . At the time , the NSW Railway & Tramway Magazine noted that he was a " strict teetotaller and non @-@ gambler " who loved his pipe , tennis and music . After his marriage , Macartney described himself as a civil servant while he was not engaged in cricketing activities . Like most Australian cricketers of his era , Macartney was Protestant , and a freemason . 
 Macartney wrote for several Sydney newspapers , and between 1936 and 1942 regularly produced pieces for the Sydney Morning Herald . In 1930 he published the autobiographical My Cricketing Days . During the Second World War , he was a lieutenant in the amenities service of the Australian Defence Force , and afterwards was a personnel officer at Prince Henry Hospital . 
 Childless , Macartney was predeceased by his wife . He died of coronary occlusion ( heart attack ) while at work in Little Bay , New South Wales , aged 72 . In February 2007 , Macartney was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame along with Richie Benaud , making them the 26th and 27th inductees .

 = Battle of Artemisium = 
 The Battle of Artemisium , or Battle of <unk> , was a series of naval engagements over three days during the second Persian invasion of Greece . The battle took place simultaneously with the more famous land battle at Thermopylae , in August or September 480 BC , off the coast of Euboea and was fought between an alliance of Greek city @-@ states , including Sparta , Athens , Corinth and others , and the Persian Empire of Xerxes I. 
 The Persian invasion was a delayed response to the defeat of the first Persian invasion of Greece , which had been ended by the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon . King Xerxes had amassed a huge army and navy , and set out to conquer all of Greece . The Athenian general Themistocles proposed that the Allied Greeks block the advance of the Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae and simultaneously block the Persian navy at the Straits of Artemisium . An Allied naval force of 271 triremes was thus dispatched to await the arrival of the Persians . 
 Approaching Artemisium towards the end of summer , the Persian navy was caught in a gale off the coast of Magnesia and lost around a third of their 1200 ships . After arriving at Artemisium , the Persians sent a detachment of 200 ships around the coast of Euboea in an attempt to trap the Greeks , but these were caught in another storm and shipwrecked . The main action of the battle took place after two days of smaller engagements . The two sides fought all day , with roughly equal losses ; however the smaller Allied fleet could not afford the losses . 
 After the engagement , the Allies received news of the defeat of the Allied army at Thermopylae . Since their strategy required both Thermopylae and Artemisium to be held , and given their losses , the Allies decided to withdraw to Salamis . The Persians overran Boeotia and captured the now @-@ evacuated Athens . However , seeking a decisive victory over the Allied fleet , the Persians were later defeated at the Battle of Salamis in late 480 BC . Fearing being trapped in Europe , Xerxes withdrew with much of his army to Asia , leaving Mardonius to complete the conquest of Greece . The following year , however , saw an Allied army decisively defeat the Persians at the Battle of Plataea , thereby ending the Persian invasion . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Greek city @-@ states of Athens and Eretria had supported the unsuccessful Ionian Revolt against the Persian Empire of Darius I in 499 @-@ 494 BC . The Persian Empire was still relatively young , and prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples . Moreover , Darius was an usurper , and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule . The Ionian revolt threatened the integrity of his empire , and Darius thus vowed to punish those involved ( especially those not already part of the empire ) . Darius also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of Ancient Greece . A preliminary expedition under Mardonius in 492 BC , to secure the land approaches to Greece , re @-@ conquered Thrace , and forced Macedon to become a fully subordinate client kingdom part of Persia . It had been made a vassal or ally as early as the late 6th century BC , but remained having autonomy . Mardonius ' campaign of 492 BC changed this . 
 In 491 BC , Darius sent emissaries to all the Greek city @-@ states , asking for a gift of ' earth and water ' in token of their submission to him . Having had a demonstration of his power the previous year , the majority of Greek cities duly obliged . In Athens , however , the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed by throwing them in a pit ; in Sparta , they were simply thrown down a well . This meant that Sparta was also effectively at war with Persia . 
 Darius thus put together an amphibious task force under Datis and Artaphernes in 490 BC , which attacked Naxos , before receiving the submission of the other Cycladic Islands . The task force then moved on Eretria , which it besieged and destroyed . Finally , it moved to attack Athens , landing at the bay of Marathon , where it was met by a heavily outnumbered Athenian army . At the ensuing Battle of Marathon , the Athenians won a remarkable victory , which resulted in the withdrawal of the Persian army to Asia . 
 Darius therefore began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece ; however , in 486 BC , his Egyptian subjects revolted , indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition . Darius then died whilst preparing to march on Egypt , and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I. Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt , and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece . Since this was to be a full @-@ scale invasion , it required long @-@ term planning , stock @-@ piling and conscription . Xerxes decided that the Hellespont would be bridged to allow his army to cross to Europe , and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of Mount Athos ( rounding which headland , a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC ) . These were both feats of exceptional ambition , which would have been beyond any contemporary state . By early 480 BC , the preparations were complete , and the army which Xerxes had mustered at Sardis marched towards Europe , crossing the Hellespont on two pontoon bridges . 
 The Athenians had also been preparing for war with the Persians since the mid @-@ 480s BC , and in 482 BC the decision was taken , under the guidance of the Athenian politician Themistocles , to build a massive fleet of triremes that would be necessary for the Greeks to fight the Persians . However , the Athenians did not have the manpower to fight on land and sea ; and therefore combating the Persians would require an alliance of Greek city states . In 481 BC , Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for earth and water , but making the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta . Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states . A congress of city states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC , and a confederate alliance of Greek city @-@ states was formed . It had the power to send envoys asking for assistance and to dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points after joint consultation . This was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world , especially since many of the city @-@ states in attendance were still technically at war with each other . 
 The ' congress ' met again in the spring of 480 BC . A Thessalian delegation suggested that the allies could muster in the narrow Vale of Tempe , on the borders of Thessaly , and thereby block Xerxes 's advance . A force of 10 @,@ 000 hoplites was dispatched to the Vale of Tempe , through which they believed the Persian army would have to pass . However , once there , they were warned by Alexander I of Macedon that the vale could be bypassed through the <unk> Pass , and that the army of Xerxes was overwhelming , the Greeks retreated . Shortly afterwards , they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont . 
 Themistocles therefore suggested a second strategy to the allies . The route to southern Greece ( Boeotia , Attica and the Peloponnesus ) would require the army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae . The pass could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites , despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians . Furthermore , to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea , the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium . This dual strategy was adopted by the congress . However , the Peloponnesian cities made fall @-@ back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should all else fail , whilst the women and children of Athens were evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 The Allied fleet sailed north to Cape Artemisium once it became known that the Persian army was advancing along the coast past Mount Olympus , probably around late July or the beginning of August . The Allies took up station at Artemisium , most likely beaching their ships at the headland , from which they could be quickly launched as needed . The Allies sent three ships to Skiathos as scouts to provide warning of the approach of the Persian fleet . Two weeks passed without sight of the Persian fleet . Finally , ten Sidonian triremes arrived off Skiathos , and the main Allied fleet was informed by a fire @-@ beacon lit on the island . However , the Allied patrol ships themselves were caught unaware and two were captured , whilst one ran aground . According to Herodotus , in the ensuing confusion , unsure whether or not the beacon heralded the arrival of the whole Persian fleet , as a precaution the whole Allied fleet launched into the straits of Artemisium . Once it became clear that the Persian fleet was not going to arrive that day , they decided to sail to Chalcis , halfway down on the western coast of Euboea , leaving men on the heights of Euboea to warn of the actual arrival of the Persian ships . 
 Historians suggest that the Allies may have misinterpreted the Persian movements and come to the mistaken conclusion that the Persians were sailing east around Skiathos , aiming to sail around the eastern side of Euboea . The signals sent by fire beacons must have been very simplistic , and potentially interpreted wrongly ; alternatively , the signallers may have genuinely believed that the Persian fleet was sailing to the east of Skiathos . If the Persians sailed around the outer , eastern side of Euboea , they could head straight to Attica , and thereby cut off the Allied fleet 's line of retreat . Furthermore , the Persians had enough ships to attempt to both attack the Straits of Artemisium , and sail around Euboea . The withdrawal to Chalcis therefore gave the Allies the opportunity to escape from the Straits of Euboea if the Persians did travel around the outside of Euboea , but also allowed them to return to Artemisium if necessary . In this context , the watchers left on Euboea could inform the Allies if the Persian fleet did indeed sail east of Euboea . The Allied fleet thus continued to wait at Chalcis . Nevertheless , the Allies , undoubtedly anxious about facing a Persian fleet which outnumbered them so comprehensively , may have somewhat overreacted . 
 Around ten days later , the Persian army arrived at Thermopylae , and the Allies at Chalcis were informed by a ship , captained by <unk> , which had been appointed to liaise between the army and the fleet . However , there was still no sign of the Persian fleet , and the first day the Persians spent at Thermopylae passed without them launching an attack . The next day , the Persian fleet finally drew near to Artemisium , heading for the Gap of Skiathos ( between the coast of Magnesia and Skiathos ) , when a summer gale ( a ' <unk> ' - probably a north @-@ easterly storm ) broke , driving the Persian fleet onto the mountainous coast . The storm lasted two days , wrecking approximately one third of the Persian ships . Meanwhile , at Thermopylae , the Persians had continued to wait for the Greeks to disperse , also choosing not to attack during the storm . 
 The day after the storm finished , the Allied fleet returned to Artemisium to protect the flank of the army at Thermopylae . The following day , ( the fifth since the Persians had arrived at Thermopylae ) the Persian army began their attacks on the Allied army at Thermopylae . The same day , the Persian fleet finally appeared through the Gap of <unk> , and began mooring on the coast opposite Artemisium , at <unk> . According to Herodotus , 15 Persian ships blundered into the Allied lines , and were captured . Although clearly storm damaged , the Persian fleet still probably outnumbered the Allies by nearly 3 : 1 . As a result , the Allies contemplated withdrawing completely . The <unk> , not wanting to be abandoned to the Persians , bribed Themistocles to try to ensure that the Allied fleet remained . Since the joint operation at Thermopylae and Artemisium was his strategy in the first place , it is likely this is exactly what Themistocles wanted , and this bribe allowed him in turn to bribe the Spartan and Corinthian admirals , Eurybiades and <unk> to remain at Artemisium . 
 Later on that day , a deserter from the Persian fleet , a Greek called <unk> , swam into the Allied camp . He brought bad news for the Allies — whilst most of the Persian fleet was undergoing repairs , the Persians had detached 200 seaworthy ships to sail around the outer coast of Euboea , to block the escape route of the Allied fleet . The Persians did not want to attack the Allies yet , because they thought the Allies would simply flee , and so they sought to trap them . The Allies resolved to go and meet this detachment , to prevent being trapped , though they planned to leave by nightfall to prevent the Persians becoming aware of their plans . 
 The Allies most likely realised that this situation presented them with an opportunity to destroy an isolated part of the Persian fleet . Herodotus is not clear on where the Allies planned to meet this detachment , only that they resolved to do so . One possibility is that they planned to sail down the Straits of Euboea , and hope that the other Allied ships , patrolling the coast of Attica , [ Note 1 ] followed the Persians as they entered the Straits of Euboea from the south ; then the Persians might themselves be caught in a trap . Alternatively , the Allies may have planned to ambush the detachment as it passed by Artemisium , on its journey from <unk> . Either way , they decided to make a demonstration towards the Persian lines during what remained of the day , to convince the Persians that they were planning to stay at Artemisium . Herodotus also suggests that this was an opportunity for them to assess Persian seamanship and tactics . The Allies probably waited until late afternoon so that there was little chance of being drawn into a full scale engagement ; they did not want to suffer casualties before sailing to meet to the Persian detachment . These decisions finally led to the beginning of the battle . 
 = = = Chronology = = = 
 The exact chronology of the battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium , and their relation to each other is somewhat unclear . The chronology below represents an estimated reconstruction of the time @-@ line , following Lazenby and Holland . 
 = = Opposing forces = = 
 = = = Persian fleet = = = 
 Herodotus gives a detailed description of the Persian fleet which assembled at Doriskos in spring 480 BC ( see table ) . However , after the fleet was struck the storm off the coast of Magnesia , approximately one third of the fleet was lost . Thus , by Herodotus 's reckoning , the Persian fleet would have had approximately 800 triremes at Artemisium . 
 Some modern scholars have accepted these numbers , especially since the ancient sources are unusually consistent on this point . Other authors reject this number , with 1 @,@ 207 being seen as more of a reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliad , and generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean . 
 = = = Greek fleet = = = 
 Herodotus claims there were 280 ships in the Greek fleet at the Battle of Artemisium , made up of the following contingents ( numbers in parentheses refer to <unk> , other ships are all <unk> ) : 
 The Athenians had been building up a large fleet since 483 BC , ostensibly to help win them in their ongoing conflict with Aegina . However , it is probable this build up , made under the guidance of Themistocles , was also made with a future conflict with the Persians in mind . Although the Athenians initially requested command of the Allied fleet , they allowed command of the fleet to be given to Eurybiades of Sparta , in order to preserve the unity of the force . 
 = = Strategic and tactical considerations = = 
 Strategically , the Allied mission was simple . The fleet needed to protect the flank of the army at Thermopylae , whilst not being cut off themselves . For the Persians , the strategic situation was equally simple , although with more options . They needed to force their way through either one of Thermopylae or Artemisium ( since holding both was necessary for the Allied effort ) , or to outflank either position . <unk> the Straits of Artemisium was theoretically much easier than outflanking Thermopylae , by sailing around the east coast of Euboea . The Greek position at Artemisium may have been chosen in order to watch for such attempts ; if the narrowness of the channel had been the only determinant , the Allies could have found a better position near the city of Histiaea . 
 The Persians were at a significant tactical advantage , outnumbering the Allies and having " better sailing " ships . The " better sailing " that Herodotus mentions was probably due to the superior seamanship of the crews ; most of the Athenian ships ( and therefore the majority of the fleet ) were newly built , and had inexperienced crews . The most common naval tactics in the Mediterranean area at the time were ramming ( triremes were equipped with a ram at the bows ) , or boarding by ship @-@ borne marines ( which essentially turned a sea battle into a land one ) . The Persians and Asiatic Greeks had by this time begun to use a manoeuver known as diekplous . It is not entirely clear what this was , but it probably involved sailing into gaps between enemy ships and then ramming them in the side . This maneuver would have required skilled sailing , and therefore the Persians would have been more likely to employ it . The Allies , however , developed tactics specifically to counter this . 
 Herodotus suggests that the Allied ships were heavier and , by implication , less maneuverable . Their weight would further reduce the likelihood of the Allied ships employing the diekplous . The source of this heaviness is uncertain ; possibly the Allied ships were bulkier in construction . Another suggestion is that the heaviness was caused by the weight of fully armoured hoplite marines . The Allies may have had extra marines on board if their ships were less maneuverable , since boarding would then be the main tactic available to them ( at the cost of making the ships even heavier ) . Indeed , Herodotus refers to the Greeks capturing ships , rather than sinking them . 
 = = Battle = = 
 = = = First day = = = 
 When the Persians saw the Allied fleet rowing towards them , they decided to seize the opportunity to attack , even though it was late in the day , as they thought they would win an easy victory . They quickly advanced on the much smaller Allied fleet . However , the Allies had come up with a tactic for this situation , where they turned their " bows on to the barbarians , [ and ] they drew their sterns together in the middle " . This is usually taken to mean that they formed into a circle , with their rams pointing outwards ; Thucydides reports that in the Peloponnesian War , Peloponnesian fleets twice adopted a circular formation , with their sterns together . However , Herodotus does not actually use the word circle , and Lazenby points out the difficulty of forming a circle of 250 ships ( the Peloponnesian fleets had 30 – 40 ships ) . It is thus possible the Allies formed into more of a crescent formation , with the wings drawn back to prevent the Persian ships sailing around the Allied line . Whatever the case , it seems likely that this maneuver was intended to negate the superior Persian seamanship , and perhaps specifically the use of diekplous . 
 Having assumed this formation upon the giving of a prearranged signal , the Allied ships moved suddenly outwards from this position at a second signal , rowing into the Persian ships and catching them off guard . Their superior seamanship negated , the Persians came off worst from the encounter with 30 of their ships captured or sunk . During the battle a Greek ship , captained by <unk> of Lemnos , defected to the Allies . Nightfall then ended the battle , with the Allies having fared better than they possibly expected to . 
 During the night , another storm broke ( this time probably a thunder @-@ storm , possibly with a south easterly wind ) , preventing the Allies from setting off southwards to counter the Persian detachment sent around the outside of Euboea . However , the storm also hit the Persian detachment of ships , driving them off course and onto the rocky coast of ' the Hollows ' of Euboea . This part of the Persian fleet was thus also shipwrecked , losing most of the ships . 
 = = = Second day = = = 
 The following day , which was also the second day of Battle of Thermopylae , the Persian fleet , now recovering from the two storms , declined to attack the Allies , and instead attempted to make the fleet seaworthy again . News of the shipwreck off Euboea reached the Allies that day , as well as a reinforcement of 53 ships from Athens . 
 Again waiting until late afternoon , the Allies took the opportunity to attack a patrol of Cilician ships , destroying them , before retreating as night fell . These ships were possibly survivors of the wrecked detachment sent around Euboea , or were perhaps anchored in an isolated harbour . 
 = = = Third day = = = 
 On the third day of the battle the Persian fleet was ready to attack the Allied lines in full force . Seeing the Persian fleet assemble , the Allies attempted to block the Straits of Artemisium as best they could , and waited for the Persians to attack . The Persians formed a semicircle of ships , and tried to enclose the Allied fleet , upon which the Allies rowed forward and joined battle . The battle raged all day long , with the Allies hard put to defend their line . When the fleets finally disengaged at nightfall , both sides had suffered roughly equal losses . However , the smaller Allied fleet could scarcely afford such losses ; half the Athenian ships ( the largest contingent in the fleet ) were damaged or lost . 
 Returning to Artemisium , the Allies saw that they would probably not be able to hold the line for another day , such were their losses . They thus debated whether they should withdraw from Artemisium , whilst they awaited news from Thermopylae . Themistocles ordered the men to slaughter and barbecue the flocks of the <unk> , so that they would not fall into Persian hands . <unk> arrived on the liaison ship from Thermopylae and told the Allies of the destruction of the Allied rearguard at Thermopylae . Since holding the Straits of Artemisium now no longer held any strategic purpose , and given their losses , the Allies decided to evacuate immediately . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Persians were alerted to the withdrawal of the Greeks by a boat from Histiaea , but did not at first believe it . They sent some ships to see if this was the case , and finding that it was , the whole fleet set sail for Artemisium in the morning . The Persians then sailed on to Histiaea and sacked the surrounding region . 
 The Allied fleet sailed to Salamis , off the coast of Attica , to assist with the evacuation of the remaining Athenians . En route , Themistocles left inscriptions addressed to the Ionian Greek crews of the Persian fleet on all springs of water that they might stop at , asking them to defect to the Allied cause : 
 " Men of Ionia , that what you are doing is not proper , campaigning against your fathers and wishing to enslave Greece . It would be best if you came on our side . But if this is not possible , at least during the battle stand aside and also beg the Carians to do the same with you . But if you can not do either the one or the other , if you are chained by higher force and you can not defect during the operations , when we come at hand , act purposely as cowards remembering that we are of the same blood and that the first cause of animosity with the barbarians came from you . " 
 Following Thermopylae , the Persian army burned and sacked the Boeotian cities which had not submitted to the Persians , Plataea and Thespiae , before marching on the now evacuated city of Athens . Meanwhile , the Allies ( for the most part Peloponnesian ) prepared to defend the Isthmus of Corinth , demolishing the single road that led through it , and building a wall across it . As at Thermopylae , to make this an effective strategy required the Allied navy to stage a simultaneous blockade , barring the passage of the Persian navy across the Saronic Gulf , so that troops could not be landed directly on the Peloponnese . However , instead of a mere blockade , Themistocles persuaded the Allies to seek a decisive victory against the Persian fleet . Luring the Persian navy into the Straits of Salamis in September , the Allied fleet was able to destroy much of the Persian fleet , which essentially ended the threat to the Peloponnese . 
 Fearing that the Greeks might attack the bridges across the Hellespont and trap his army in Europe , Xerxes retreated with much of the army back to Asia . He left a hand picked force under Mardonius to complete the conquest the following year . However , under pressure from the Athenians , the Peloponnesian Allies eventually agreed to try to force Mardonius to battle , and marched on Attica . Mardonius retreated to Boeotia to lure the Greeks into open terrain and the two sides eventually met near the city of Plataea . There , at the Battle of Plataea in August 479 BC , the Greek army won a decisive victory , destroying much of the Persian army , and ending the invasion of Greece . Meanwhile , at the near @-@ simultaneous naval Battle of Mycale the Greeks destroyed much of the remaining Persian fleet , thereby reducing the threat of further invasions . 
 = = Significance = = 
 Considered by itself , Artemisium was a relatively insignificant battle . The Allies did not defeat the Persian navy , nor prevent it from advancing further along the coast of Greece . Conversely , neither did the Persians destroy the Greek fleet , nor irreparably weaken it . The battle was thus an indecisive one , which pleased neither side . 
 Nevertheless , in the wider context of the Greco @-@ Persian wars , it was a very significant battle for the Allies . The Allies had demonstrated to themselves that they could stand up to the Persian navy , even having the better of some encounters . For many of the Allied crews , it was their first taste of battle , and the experience gained was invaluable at the forthcoming Battle of Salamis . Moreover , fighting the Persians at Artemisium allowed the Greek admirals to see how the Persian fleet performed , and gave them insights into how it might be beaten . In addition , the events before and during Artemisium were crucial in cutting down the size of the Persian fleet ( even if this was not all due to military action ) , meaning that the odds faced by the Allies at the Battle of Salamis were not overwhelming . As the poet Pindar put it , Artemisium was " where the sons of the Athenians laid the shining foundation @-@ stone of freedom " .

 = Satake clan = 
 The Satake clan ( <unk> , Satake @-@ shi ) was a Japanese samurai clan that claimed descent from the Minamoto clan . Its first power base was in Hitachi Province . The clan was subdued by Minamoto no Yoritomo in the late 12th century , but later entered Yoritomo 's service as vassals . In the Muromachi period , the Satake served as provincial deputy ( shugo ) of Hitachi Province ( today Ibaraki prefecture ) , under the aegis of the Ashikaga Shogunate . The clan sided with the Western Army during the Battle of Sekigahara , and was punished by Tokugawa Ieyasu , who moved it to a smaller territory in northern Dewa Province ( northern Honshū ) at the start of the Edo period . The Satake survived as lords ( daimyō ) of the Kubota Domain ( also known as the Akita Domain ) . Over the course of the Edo period , two major branches of the Satake clan were established , one ruled the fief of Iwasaki , the other one the fief of Kubota @-@ Shinden . 
 During the Boshin War of 1868 @-@ 69 , the Satake were signatories to the pact that formed the Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei , but after internal debate and a disagreement with the Sendai Domain , the clan switched sides and joined the imperial forces in subduing the alliance . As with all other daimyō families , the Satake clan was relieved of its title in 1871 . 
 = = Origins = = 
 The Satake clan claimed descent from Satake Masayoshi , the grandson of the prominent 11th century warrior Minamoto no Yoshimitsu . Yoshimitsu received land in Mutsu Province and Hitachi Province as a reward for his military service , and took up residence at Satake village , in Hitachi . Yoshimitsu willed the territory around Satake village to his son , Yoshinobu . Yoshinobu , in turn , passed it on to his own son , Masayoshi . The Satake clan would remain in Hitachi until they were ordered to move in 1602 . In 1106 , Masayoshi led a rebellion against Minamoto no Yoshikuni , a power figure in neighboring <unk> Province , but was defeated and killed by Yoshikuni , who followed him back to Hitachi . During the Genpei War , Masayoshi 's son Takayoshi sided with Taira no Kiyomori . The Satake clan was defeated by Minamoto no Yoritomo in 1180 , and its territory confiscated ; it was not until nine years later that Yoritomo forgave Takayoshi 's son Hideyoshi , and allowed Hideyoshi to become his vassal . Hideyoshi served in the attack on Mutsu Province . The Satake clan later returned to its old territory in Hitachi . 
 = = Muromachi and Sengoku periods = = 
 In the Muromachi period ( 1336 – 1573 ) , the Satake family 's heads served as hereditary governors ( shugo ) of Hitachi Province . They were vassals of the Ashikaga shogunate 's Kamakura @-@ <unk> , the Kamakura @-@ based official who oversaw the Ashikaga shogunate 's affairs in the Kantō region . The Satake clan saw a great deal of military service under the Ashikaga banner . 
 In the Sengoku period , the Satake worked toward unifying the often rebellious clans of the Hitachi region under their control . Satake Yoshishige , family head during the early Sengoku period , was renowned for his ferocity in battle ; he was also known by the nickname of " Ogre Yoshishige " ( <unk> , Oni Yoshishige ) . He often fought against the Late Hōjō clan , who were extending their power into southern Hitachi . One such encounter was the Battle of <unk> , where 20 @,@ 000 men under Yoshishige fought 80 @,@ 000 Hōjō troops . The Satake won , due in part to the use of over 8600 matchlock rifles by their troops . 
 In 1588 and again in 1589 , the Satake also fought with the Date clan at <unk> , but were ultimately defeated by forces under the command of Date Masamune . 
 In 1590 , under the headship of Yoshishige 's son Satake Yoshinobu , the Satake clan pledged fealty to Toyotomi Hideyoshi during the Siege of Odawara . After the fall of Odawara , Hideyoshi accepted them as vassals , and guaranteed their lordship of a 540 @,@ 000 koku swath of territory in Hitachi Province . Having received recognition from Hideyoshi as the ruler of Hitachi Province , Yoshinobu 's drive for unifying the province under his rule was strengthened . He brought nearly all of the province under his control , with the exception of the <unk> and <unk> areas , the control of which Hideyoshi had assured to the Yūki clan . 
 In 1593 , the Satake clan joined in Hideyoshi 's invasion of Korea , deploying troops to Nagoya Castle in Hizen Province . 
 = = Edo era = = 
 In 1600 , the Satake sided with the Western Army at the Battle of Sekigahara , and were discovered to be in secret communication with Ishida <unk> , the leader of the Western Army . After the Western Army 's defeat by the Eastern forces of Tokugawa Ieyasu , the Satake clan was allowed to continue , but was punished . The clan 's income level was severely reduced , and in 1602 , its territories were moved to Kubota , a much smaller fief in northern Japan , where they remained until 1871 . 
 Kubota 's income level was 205 @,@ 000 koku , and it was classified as an outside ( <unk> ) daimyō . The income level remained constant throughout its history . The domain often had agricultural crises , which resulted in several peasant uprisings throughout the course of its history . It was also beset by an internal o @-@ ie sōdō conflict , the Satake disturbance ( <unk> , Satake @-@ sōdō ) , which was brought on by financial issues . 
 Satake Yoshiatsu ( better known by his nom @-@ de @-@ plume Satake <unk> ) , the 8th generation lord of Kubota , was an accomplished artist . Yoshiatsu painted a number of paintings in the Dutch style , and also produced three treatises on European painting techniques , including the depiction of perspective . He was also a student of Dutch studies ( rangaku ) scholar Hiraga <unk> , who he had invited up to Akita to advise him on management of the domain 's copper mines . It was during Yoshiatsu 's lifetime that the Akita school ( <unk> , Akita @-@ ha ) of art was born and briefly flourished . 
 The Kubota domain was uncommon in that it contained more than one castle , despite the Tokugawa shogunate 's " one castle per domain " rule . The main castle was Kubota Castle , but there were also castles at Yokote and Ōdate , and five fortified estates elsewhere in the domain : <unk> , <unk> , Hiyama , <unk> , and In 'nai . Each of these was given to a senior retainer who ran it as his own small castle town . The senior retainers had personal retainers who resided in these castle towns . 
 Two of the clan elder ( karō ) families serving the Kubota domain were branches of the Satake family . One was the North Satake family ( Satake @-@ <unk> ) , <unk> at 10 @,@ 000 koku ; the other the West Satake family ( Satake @-@ <unk> ) , <unk> at 7200 koku . The North Satake family had its landholdings around <unk> , one of the fortified estates mentioned above ; the West Satake resided in and had their landholdings around Ōdate . Another karō family unrelated to the Satake was the Tomura , who held Yokote castle . 
 During its rule over Kubota , the Satake clan was ranked as a Province @-@ holding daimyō ( <unk> , <unk> daimyō ) family , and as such , had the privilege of shogunal audiences in the Great Hall ( <unk> ) of Edo Castle . Though no Satake lord ever held shogunate office , the clan ( together with many of the other domains of northern Honshū ) assisted the shogunate in policing the frontier region of Ezochi ( now Hokkaido ) . 
 = = Boshin war = = 
 After the restoration of imperial rule in late 1867 , the Boshin War broke out in early 1868 , pitting the coalition of southern domains against the forces of the former Tokugawa shogunate . After the city of Edo fell , remnants of the Tokugawa forces retreated northward , and the fighting followed northward . The Satake clan was a signatory to the pact that formed the Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei , the alliance of anti @-@ <unk> northern domains led by the Sendai Domain . The Satake clan 's delegation at Shiroishi , the alliance 's headquarters , was led by the clan elder ( karō ) Tomura <unk> . However , the Satake had political difficulties with the alliance , which culminated in the murder , in Akita , of a delegation from Sendai on August 21 , 1868 , and the display of the messengers ' <unk> heads in the Akita castle town . The Sendai delegation , led by <unk> <unk> , was dispatched to request the Akita domain to hand over Kujō <unk> and other officials of the imperial delegation that had been originally sent to the region to gather support for the imperial cause . The Satake then backed out of the alliance and supported the imperial army ; eleven days later , on September 1 , 1868 the Tsugaru clan of the neighboring Hirosaki domain followed suit . In response , the pro @-@ alliance domains of Morioka and <unk> sent troops to attack Kubota . Kubota forces were hard @-@ pressed to defend their territory , with the result that the alliance troops had made serious advances before the war 's end ; Yokote Castle was burned , and by October 7 , Morioka troops took Ōdate , one of the Akita domain 's castles . In early 1869 , Satake Yoshitaka formally gave up the domain 's registers to the imperial government , and was made imperial governor of the Akita domain ( han chiji ) . In mid @-@ 1869 , the imperial government rewarded the service rendered by the main line of the Satake clan , by raising its income by 20 @,@ 000 koku . The heads of all the Satake clan 's branches were relieved of office as daimyō in 1871 , and ordered to relocate to Tokyo .

 In the Meiji era , Satake Yoshitaka was ennobled with the title of marquess ( <unk> ) . Satake <unk> of Iwasaki received the title of viscount ( shishaku ) . The North Satake family received the title of baron ( <unk> ) . 
 Yoshitaka 's son <unk> served in the Imperial Japanese Army , and fought in the Satsuma Rebellion .

 = Washington State Route 276 = 
 State Route 276 ( SR 276 ) was a legislated , but not constructed , state highway located in the U.S. state of Washington . The highway was meant to serve as a northern bypass of Pullman in Whitman County , traveling east from U.S. Route 195 ( US 195 ) west of the city to SR 270 east of the city . Proposals were first drawn in 1969 for a complete ring road around Pullman , with the west side built and signed as US 195 in 1975 . The northern segment of the ring road was codified in law in 1973 as SR 276 , however no construction has occurred ; in 2016 , the highway was removed via legislative action . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SR 276 is legislated to begin at an intersection with US 195 west of Pullman in rural Whitman County . The highway would continue east through the Palouse as a divided limited @-@ access highway , intersecting Brayton Road at an at @-@ grade intersection and SR 27 at a diamond interchange . SR 276 would turn southeast and intersect the future Coliseum Road at a diamond interchange before ending at SR 270 east of Pullman . 
 The highway was proposed primarily to relieve traffic on SR 27 and SR 270 through downtown Pullman , measured in surveys conducted by the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) using average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) . WSDOT determined the intersection between SR 27 and SR 270 in downtown Pullman as the busiest highway in the region . SR 270 averaged 19 @,@ 000 vehicles east of the intersection and SR 27 averaged 16 @,@ 000 vehicles south of the intersection in 2011 , while WSDOT predicted that average traffic could rise to 26 @,@ 000 vehicles by 2025 .

 A ring road around Pullman was first proposed by the Washington State Highway Commission in 1966 and surveyed in 1970 . Right @-@ of @-@ way acquisition by WSDOT began in 1972 and the corridor was designated and codified into law as SR 276 the following year . 2 @.@ 8 miles ( 4 @.@ 51 km ) of the ring road was completed west of the city as part of US 195 in 1974 while a public survey in 1975 recommended a southern bypass for SR 270 instead of SR 276 . The bypass project was canceled by 1978 and the WSDOT right @-@ of @-@ way was leased to farmers for agricultural purposes . The project was restarted with a transportation study from the Spokane Regional Council in 1993 and funded by the Pullman municipal government as part of their comprehensive plan . A route development plan , funded by WSDOT , recommended the construction of a 6 @.@ 89 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 11 @.@ 09 km ) divided limited @-@ access highway with a single at @-@ grade intersection at Brayton Road . 
 In 2016 , a bill was introduced in the Washington State Legislature to decommission the unbuilt highway by removing its designation , primarily to facilitate the expansion of the Pullman – Moscow Regional Airport runway .

 = God of War : Ascension = 
 God of War : Ascension is a third @-@ person action @-@ adventure video game developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment ( SCE ) . The game was first released on March 12 , 2013 , for the PlayStation 3 ( PS3 ) console . It is the seventh installment in the God of War series and prequel to the entire series . Loosely based on Greek mythology , the game is set in ancient Greece with vengeance as its central motif . The player controls the protagonist Kratos , the former servant of the God of War Ares , who tricked Kratos into killing his wife and daughter . In response to this tragedy , Kratos renounced Ares , breaking his blood oath to the god . Kratos was therefore imprisoned and tortured by the three Furies , guardians of honor and enforcers of punishment . Helped by the oath keeper Orkos , Kratos escapes his imprisonment and confronts the Furies to be completely free of his bond to Ares . 
 The gameplay is similar to previous installments , focusing on combo @-@ based combat with the player 's main weapon — the Blades of Chaos — and other weapons acquired by the new World Weapons mechanic . It continues the use of quick time events and adds a new , <unk> , free @-@ form system . Four magical attacks and a power @-@ enhancing ability can be used as alternative combat options , and the game features puzzles and platforming elements . Ascension is the only installment in the series to include online multiplayer features for both competitive and cooperative play . It also features a redesigned combat system , new gameplay mechanics , and downloadable content . A graphic novel prequel to the single and multiplayer modes launched as Rise of the Warrior prior to the game 's release . 
 God of War : Ascension received generally favorable reception from critics , who praised its fundamental gameplay and spectacle , which they said were true to the series . Some reviewers said the story was not as compelling as previous installments , with IGN stating that in comparison to Zeus and Ares , " the Furies don 't quite cut it " . The game 's multiplayer element received a mixed response . Although reviewers said the gameplay translated well into the multiplayer element , they criticized the balance and depth of combat . Edge magazine , however , approved of the multiplayer element , calling it an " evolutionary step " with " some fine ideas ... that will form part of this genre 's future template " . In terms of sales , Ascension did not perform as well as its predecessors , and unlike them it won no awards . It received several nominations from various media outlets , including the Writers Guild of America Videogame Awards 's " Outstanding Achievement in Videogame Writing " and the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences award for " Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design " . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 In both of God of War : Ascension 's single @-@ player and multiplayer elements , it is primarily a third @-@ person video game viewed from a fixed camera perspective . Some scenes in the single @-@ player campaign feature a first @-@ person camera view . In single @-@ player mode , the player controls the character Kratos in combo @-@ based combat , platforming , and puzzle games . The enemies are an assortment of creatures , most of whom are drawn from Greek mythology , including cyclopes , cerberuses , <unk> , Sirens , Gorgons , satyrs , harpies , and centaurs . Several other monsters were created specifically for the game , such as the juggernauts ( <unk> ) , wraiths , and <unk> . Many of the monsters also appear in the multiplayer . Platforming elements require the player to climb walls and ladders , jump across chasms , and slide down walls to proceed through sections of the game . The game features a variety of puzzles , ranging from simple to complex . 
 = = = Combat = = = 
 Kratos ' main weapon is the Blades of Chaos , a pair of blades attached to chains that are wrapped around his wrists and forearms . In gameplay , the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers . A new weapons mechanic called the World Weapon system allows Kratos to pick up weapons scattered throughout game locations or to take them from defeated foes , and to use these for a limited time . There are five World Weapons ( sword , club , javelin , sling , shield ) that can be collected randomly , although Kratos may possess only one at any time . When a World Weapon is not equipped , Kratos may punch or kick foes as part of the new combat system . Another new addition is that Kratos can tether enemies , referred to as grappling ; he can hold an enemy in place with one blade while he attacks other enemies with the other blade , and he can throw the tethered enemy . 
 Four magical disciplines are acquired , including the Fire of Ares , the Ice of Poseidon , the Lightning of Zeus , and the Soul of Hades , which , depending on the magic equipped , imbues the Blades of Chaos with that elemental property . For example , the Soul of Hades imbues the Blades with purple flames and can unleash souls of the Underworld to briefly attack enemies . The Ice of Poseidon also enables Kratos to breathe underwater , a necessary ability as substantial time is spent there . The Rage ability , Rage of the Gods , featured in previous games is included and unlike them , its meter is filled by landing attacks on enemies and the ability is automatically activated once the meter has reached maximum capacity . It remains activated until Kratos is attacked or stops attacking for an extended period of time , then the meter must be refilled . The Rage ability is also affected by the magic equipped , allowing Kratos to use different Rage attacks , such as the lightning @-@ based Rage of Zeus . 
 Three relics , the Amulet of Uroborus ( Life Cycle mechanic ) , the Oath Stone of Orkos , and the Eyes of Truth , are acquired and needed for game progression . The Amulet of Uroborus allows Kratos to manipulate time by decaying or healing an object ; examples include reconstructing broken pathways and using it during puzzle @-@ solving . Construction can be paused or reversed if needed . The amulet can also be used against enemies to briefly slow their movements . The Oath Stone of Orkos gives Kratos the ability to create a " shadow " duplicate of himself that can depress plates , hold levers , or attack enemies . The Eyes of Truth remove illusions created by the Furies and casts a blinding light on enemies . In addition to the quick time event ( QTE ) mechanic featured in the previous games , a new , <unk> , free @-@ form system has been added , allowing players to choose when to attack or dodge based on the enemy 's actions . When certain foes , such as a cyclops or a juggernaut , have been sufficiently weakened , the player may jump on its back and briefly force it to attack other foes . 
 Other extra features include ten artifacts hidden in the game world that provide additional abilities like unlimited magic during New Game Plus . New Game Plus also allows players to change Kratos ' costume , but trophies are disabled in this mode . A new feature absent from previous installments is " Chapter Select " , which allows players to select and replay previously completed levels . Unlike previous installments , in which behind @-@ the @-@ scenes videos are unlocked after completing the game , these videos are already available from the main menu . 
 = = = Multiplayer = = = 
 God of War : Ascension offers an online multiplayer feature for up to eight players — a first for the series — with a small story element . The main objective for players is to take control of a map to earn rewards from the gods . Before entering multiplayer battles , players are introduced to a warrior , who like Kratos , is an oath @-@ breaker and is imprisoned in the Prison of the Damned — the warrior 's backstory is explored in Rise of the Warrior . The player takes control of the warrior and aligns with one of the four deities : Ares , Hades , Zeus , or Poseidon . Each god offers a unique combat play @-@ style and in @-@ battle abilities . The attack style of the god with whom the player aligns is critical to their warrior 's path . Players can create up to three more warriors and have a champion representing each god . 
 Players can unlock special magic abilities , new and upgraded armors , weapons , relics , and other treasures as they earn experience points ( XP ) to level @-@ up their warrior . Players may also complete " Labors " , which are challenges from the gods that rewards armor and weapons . Throughout multiplayer matches , players receive buffs and <unk> , and there is a color @-@ coding system , called flashes , where a player 's character will flash a certain color indicating a special property , such as vulnerability or invulnerability . A prestige feature called " Ascension " , added in the June 10 , 2013 update , allows players to reset their allegiance progression when they reach Level 40 , and receive in @-@ game currency for " Godly " armors and weapons — the " most valuable and powerful items in the game " . They are classified as a Hero the first time they ascend and then a Demigod the second time and keep that title from then on . 
 There are five multiplayer modes : Team Favor of the Gods , Match of Champions , Trial of the Gods , Capture the Flag , and Bout of Honor . Team matches randomly assign players to compete on either the Spartan or Trojan team . The " signature " multiplayer mode is Team Favor of the Gods , in which two teams of two @-@ to @-@ four players try to accumulate a target quantity of points to win . Points , known as Favor , are earned by killing and other methods . When players are not on the offensive , they may help their team earn points by capturing altars , collecting red orbs from chests , and setting traps for opposing players . The non @-@ team version , Match of Champions , is a four @-@ to @-@ eight @-@ player deathmatch with a similar goal to Team Favor of the Gods . Trial of the Gods is a two @-@ player , cooperative ( co @-@ op ) , time @-@ trial mode in which the duo faces five waves of mythological monsters concluding with a boss fight . A single @-@ player version is also available . In Capture the Flag , two teams of four players battle to capture the opposing team 's flag and return it to their base until a target number of flags have been captured . In Bout of Honor , added in the July 11 , 2013 update , players test their skills in a best @-@ of @-@ seven @-@ rounds one @-@ on @-@ one fight . 
 All but two of the fifteen multiplayer maps are based on locations explored throughout the God of War series , with eight of those based on locations explored in Ascension ; for example , Desert of Lost Souls is from God of War , Bog of the Forgotten is from God of War II , and Labyrinth of Daedalus , Forum of Hercules , and Chamber of the Flame are from God of War III . The two original maps are the Coliseum of Persia and the Walls of Troy ( which features the Trojan Horse ) . Every map features several special power @-@ ups awarded by the gods for earning points , such as the Boots of Hermes for acceleration and running attacks . Maps also have environmental obstacles or objectives to complete for more points . For example , on the Desert of Lost Souls map , the cyclops Polyphemus may attack nearby players and killing him with the Spear of Olympus will grant bonus points for that team .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 As with previous games , God of War : Ascension is set in an alternate version of ancient Greece populated by the Olympian Gods , Titans , and other beings from Greek mythology . Game events are set six months after Kratos killed his family , which takes place before Chains of Olympus ( 2008 ) and ten years before God of War ( 2005 ) . The narrative takes place over four weeks ; it shifts several times between the present ( the fourth week ) and past ( the preceding three weeks ) , while the player controls Kratos in both . Several locations , including the Prison of the Damned and several real @-@ world locations — including the village Kirra , the city Delphi , and the island Delos — are explored in the game . 
 The Prison of the Damned is the Furies ' massive prison to house all oath @-@ breakers . Kirra is an abandoned village that lost its water supply after its water wheel and aqueduct were destroyed . Other than monsters , the only life is in its harbor , where the tamed Harbor Master guides vessels in and out of the port . Delphi is located in the snowy mountains north of Kirra and features the Tower of Delphi . After activating three massive , mechanical pythons , the Tower allows access to the Temple of Delphi , home of the Oracle . Delos features a Titan @-@ sized statue of Apollo , constructed by the inventor Archimedes to honor the god .

 Gameplay begins with Kratos , who is imprisoned , chained , and tormented by the Furies for breaking his blood oath to Ares . Megaera tortures Kratos , but accidentally facilitates his freedom . Chasing the Fury through the prison , he discovers that the prison itself is <unk> the Hecatonchires , the first traitor of the Furies who had broken a blood oath to Zeus ; he was turned into the Prison of the Damned as punishment . Overcoming an illusion created by Tisiphone and Daemon , he finds and kills Megaera , retrieving the Amulet of Uroborus , which the Furies had confiscated from him in a preceding week . 
 The narrative shifts to three weeks before Kratos ' imprisonment . Confronted by Orkos in the Village of Kirra , Kratos is advised that the visions he has been experiencing are mind tricks created by the Furies , and instructs him to find the Oracle of Delphi . Upon arrival at the Temple of Delphi , he overcomes Castor and Pollux , who tried to kill the Oracle . In her dying breath , the Oracle instructs Kratos to travel to Delos to retrieve the Eyes of Truth . Taking the Amulet of Uroborus from the now @-@ dead Castor and Pollux , Kratos travels to Kirra 's harbor , where he again encounters Orkos . The oath keeper reveals that Ares wanted a perfect warrior to help him overthrow Zeus , so Ares helped Kratos against the barbarians to make him into a perfect warrior . Orkos became the oath keeper and did not question the Furies until Ares tricked Kratos into killing his own family . Armed with this knowledge , Kratos takes a ship to Delos . 
 A week later , Kratos arrives at the island of Delos and explores the ruined statue of Apollo . He is attacked by all three Furies and is eventually captured . Orkos appears and frees Kratos , transporting him to another location . Orkos gives Kratos his Oath Stone and reveals that he and Aletheia tried to warn Zeus of Ares ' and the Furies ' plan . In retaliation , the Furies took the Oracle 's eyes , the objects Kratos seeks . After a perilous journey , Kratos uses the Amulet of Uroborus to restore the statue in order to retrieve the eyes . After completing the Trials of Archimedes , however , Kratos is ambushed and captured by the Furies . 
 Back in the present time , Tisiphone and Daemon cast another illusion to deceive Kratos , who overcomes it and retrieves the Oath Stone of Orkos . He encounters the Scribe of Hecatonchires , who reveals that the Furies were originally fair in their punishment , but devolved into ruthless beings because of Ares . Continuing his pursuit of the Furies , Kratos reaches the door to Alecto 's Chamber , but seemingly returns home to his wife and daughter ; another illusion , this time cast by Alecto . She tries to convince Kratos he can live within this illusion if he rejoins Ares , but he denies her . Enraged , Alecto and Tisiphone attack Kratos , who retrieves the eyes , and Alecto transforms into a giant sea monster . After a brutal battle , Kratos uses the eyes to break through the Furies ' illusions before killing them both , which destroys the prison . 
 Kratos returns to Sparta , where he is met by Orkos . He praises Kratos ' victory over the Furies , but reveals that Kratos will not be free from Ares ' bond unless he kills Orkos . He begs Kratos to give him an honorable death , which will free them both from Ares . Kratos initially refuses but Orkos ' continuing pleas ultimately force Kratos to kill him . Afterward , Kratos experiences the first of many nightmares — previously masked by his bond — and discovers his path to redemption through continual service to Olympus . Kratos burns down his house with the corpse of Orkos inside and leaves , beginning his path towards becoming the champion of the gods .

 In January 2010 , Santa Monica 's studio director John Hight advised video @-@ gaming blog Joystiq " while God of War III will conclude the trilogy , it won 't spell the end of the franchise " and said " We 're going to be really careful about what we do next . " From April 2011 until April 2012 , several sources claimed that a fourth main entry would release sometime in 2012 and would feature an online component . On April 12 , 2012 , Sony released a teaser image on its official PlayStation Facebook page , which was followed by the game 's announcement on April 19 , though Amazon leaked the announcement the day before . The trailer announced Todd Papy , who had worked as a designer on God of War and God of War II and as Design Director on God of War III , as Game Director . David Jaffe confirmed that God of War III Game Director Stig Asmussen did not return to direct this game because he was working on another project at Santa Monica . The announcement trailer was narrated by Linda Hunt ; it refers to a time before Kratos became the Ghost of Sparta and was not " bound in blood " . The announcement officially confirmed the game 's title as God of War : Ascension . Papy said the game was not titled God of War IV to avoid confusion because it is a prequel , rather than a sequel , to the trilogy . The name was chosen because it compliments the story and the additional multiplayer component ; according to Papy , in this mode , players are " basically ascending from an unknown hero to a god " . 
 The game features a retooled God of War III engine , enabling online multiplayer battles for up to eight players . Papy said to allow customization , Kratos and other known gods would not be included as playable characters in the multiplayer modes because the developers did not want " red Kratos , blue Kratos , yellow Kratos " , and selecting gods would lock players into established roles . This decision was made " to balance the game when players are pitted against each other " . Papy also said there would be no female characters because each character in the multiplayer mode is based on Kratos ' animation model . The first demonstration of the game 's multiplayer element featured the Team Favor of the Gods mode running on the map Desert of Lost Souls , which features the Titan cyclops Polyphemus . The decision to add multiplayer came about from curiosity , according to Lead Combat Designer Jason McDonald . He said the team asked themselves , " can it be done ? Is there fun to be had ? " The multiplayer was first tested using Kratos , and McDonald said the testers had " a lot of fun " . Seeing their reaction made the team feel that the multiplayer had value . They then began to put the " God of War spin on it " . 
 The development team faced a number of challenges in adding multiplayer to an established single @-@ player franchise . It was a difficult task , and the team felt that they had to prove to critics that their multiplayer would not be " tacked on " ( since sub @-@ par multiplayer performance in other established , single @-@ player franchises has been criticized ) . To tackle this , Santa Monica had to hire new staff specializing in multiplayer , engineering , and design . During development , multiplayer required several rewrites which took longer than expected and delayed their production schedule . The player navigation code had to be changed for online play , which was initially designed for co @-@ op . Since multiplayer was new to the team , they did not realize the amount of work required for the experience they had envisioned . Although the original idea for multiplayer was exclusively co @-@ op , as development progressed , the team realized it was not what they wanted . Before the first press show , the team found the experience they wanted . Because of their focus on preparing multiplayer for the first press announcement , single @-@ player received less attention . When single @-@ player was <unk> , its production was accelerated , resulting in less focus on multiplayer . Development focus shifted between single @-@ player and multiplayer throughout its entire course . Local co @-@ op was also explored , but the team decided to keep multiplayer online @-@ only . 
 David Jaffe , creator and Game Director of God of War , said in an interview with NowGamer if he had worked on God of War : Ascension , he would have incorporated three specific elements : different myths , a co @-@ star , and " look to the Zelda structure as a jumping off point " . He said a cooperative mode , in which " player one [ would ] be Kratos and player two [ would ] be this stupid annoying sidekick that — for some to be determined story reason — Kratos is stuck with for the whole adventure and in the end , once the main quest is over , Kratos just snaps the poor kid 's neck " , " would be cool " . Jaffe also spoke with IGN about the multiplayer element , stating , " I think it looks cool . It looks like another great , impeccably executed Sony Santa Monica game " , and said , " If it turns out to be the case that the single player is watered down because of [ the multiplayer ] , then I think they have some justification . But I don 't see any evidence of that , and I don 't see evidence of that based on the team they are . "

 At Sony 's 2012 Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) press conference , the North American release date was confirmed as March 12 , 2013 . A single @-@ player demo was shown , revealing new gameplay mechanics and combat systems . The demo showcased that Kratos would have an encounter with the sea monster Charybdis , but this sequence was cut from the final game . Charybdis was recast as the creature that Alecto transforms into during the final fight of the game . The same day , Papy confirmed on the PlayStation.Blog that a collector 's edition of the game would be released . He said God of War : Ascension was being developed to feature stereoscopic 3D , however , it was ultimately cut . At gamescom 2012 , new multiplayer footage was shown , followed by the announcement of a multiplayer beta . 
 At the 2012 Penny Arcade Expo ( PAX ) , Game Director Todd Papy , Lead Game Designer Mark Simon , Principal Character Artist Patrick Murphy , and writer of the God of War series Marianne Krawczyk , hosted the first God of War panel , discussing the origins of God of War : Ascension , and provided an overview of the evolution of Kratos . The Fury Megaera was revealed , and Mark Simon discussed the new combat system . Papy said he had considered using the goddess Artemis as a playable female character , which would have offered the player alternative combat options . Artemis would have been depicted as half @-@ human and half @-@ feline , with the head and torso of a woman and the legs of a lioness . Artemis was ultimately cut from the game , but Papy said he would like to explore the possibility of using other gods in the future . 
 In the developmental transition from God of War III to God of War : Ascension , one of the graphics engineers , Cedric Perthuis , noted that the limits of the God of War III engine restricted artist creativity , so they " tried to remove or push those limits as far as possible without losing any performance . " An example noted was the number of UV sets used , which was increased to three sets per mesh . For a complex character model like Kratos , " independent textures are needed for body parts unique to him , each wrapping around the head , torso and limbs - all of which form an editable ' UV set ' when laid out flat . " Allowing more UV sets also made it possible to have a more natural look to the environment . Ascension did not have a graphical leap over its predecessor like God of War III did : " From a graphics ' technical ' perspective , to a large degree God of War : Ascension was more refinement on the graphics front " said another graphics engineer , Ben Diamand , who focused on optimization during Ascension 's development . The development team also added dynamic lighting , which allowed for development of the Life Cycle gameplay mechanic . Particle effects were greatly improved upon from God of War III : " the idea was to give artists more control to achieve better results with less particles " said Perthuis . 
 Terrence C. Carson , Linda Hunt , Corey Burton , Gideon Emery , Steven Blum , and Kevin Sorbo reprised their roles as Kratos , the narrator , Zeus , Poseidon , Ares , and Hercules , respectively . Jennifer Hale , who voiced two characters in the previous installment , voiced the Fury Alecto and Kratos ' wife , Lysandra , who was previously voiced by Gwendoline Yeo . Debi Mae West , Adrienne Barbeau , and Crispin Freeman , who have each done voice work on previous installments , voiced the characters Tisiphone , Aletheia , and the King of Sparta , respectively . Troy Baker voiced the oath keeper Orkos and is the announcer in the multiplayer mode . Series veteran Fred Tatasciore assumed the role of Hades , who was previously voiced by Clancy Brown . Susan Blakeslee reprised her role as the Village Oracle , who makes a cameo appearance as an illusion created by Tisiphone . Unlike previous games in which motion capture and voice recording were done separately , God of War : Ascension used " voice @-@ over motion capture " ; voice recording and motion capture were done at the same time , which allowed the voice actors to act out their characters ' scenes together . The voice @-@ over motion capture was done at House of Moves in Culver City , California .

 A global multiplayer beta was announced at gamescom 2012 . The beta included features that had previously not been publicly revealed . Players who participated in the Rise of the Warrior social challenge on GodofWar.com received early access to the beta in December 2012 . Players from SCE Europe also received an opportunity to access the beta early . The beta became available for PlayStation Plus subscribers on January 8 , 2013 .

All participants of the beta received the Champion 's Armor and Blade for their multiplayer character when the game launched . 
 According to Santa Monica 's senior producer Whitney Wade and director of internal development <unk> Sonny , the beta made the team look at the game as an " evolving service " . The testing allowed the developers to validate that their system would hold up to the criticism and abundance of players once the game launched . Because multiplayer was new , the beta allowed the team to prepare for the final game . Wade and Sonny said the testing went as expected , " revealing successive layers of issues that we would address , deploy fixes for , and then monitor in a live environment . " The most important change from the beta , they said , was their planning in how to support the game post @-@ launch . The team designed a process that allowed them to " quickly iterate on fixes , deploy them through infrastructure ( testing , certification , patching ) , and coordinate with internal technology partners within Sony . " They also developed a system to allow them to monitor , log , and interpret any changes added , and the beta test gave insight on how to prioritize key features .

 = = = Rise of the Warrior = = = 
 Rise of the Warrior was a graphic novel on GodofWar.com that featured a social experience that ran from October 22 , 2012 , until March 19 , 2013 . For the social experience of the graphic novel , players " [ lived ] out [ their ] warrior 's journey " and " [ embarked ] on a quest for redemption that [ lead players ] toward becoming the next Champion of the Gods " . Players were aligned with either the Spartans or the Trojans and competed via a number of social challenges , such as answering questions and solving riddles . In the first challenge , the teams competed to earn their army a week of exclusive , early access to the multiplayer beta test that began on December 12 , and 30 days of PlayStation Plus , which was won by the Spartans ; the Trojans received access on December 17 . The Spartans also won the next team challenge and received early access to the Prison of the Damned single @-@ player demo on February 20 , 2013 . Players could also earn early , in @-@ game unlocks for the final game 's multiplayer mode , including exclusive weapons and armor for all players who attained the rank of Champion of the Gods . Christopher Shy was the artist of the graphic novel . 
 Rise of the Warrior was a prequel story that tied into God of War : Ascension 's single @-@ player and multiplayer modes , and had 20 chapters . The story followed an unnamed warrior , also referred to as the champion or the redeemed warrior , who became the player 's character in the multiplayer mode . The warrior was a native of Kirra whose father was killed by a cruel general who poisoned the water supply of the village , killing many people . Before dying , the warrior 's father beckoned him to honor the gods and swear to never let harm come to their family . The warrior swore his father 's oath and was met by a cloaked figure known as The Giver , who guided him and followed him throughout his journey . Soon after , the warrior called upon Ares to save his people from the poisonous water ; the god destroyed the aqueduct and water wheel that supplied water to the village . The warrior then encountered the surviving soldiers who were under his father 's command . One soldier told the warrior that swords alone could not defeat the general . The warrior and his men traveled to the land of <unk> and recruited the witch Circe , who seemingly also sought revenge against the general . Circe granted the soldiers magical weapons to aid them on their journey , and suggested that they see the Oracle of Delphi to discover whether the general had any weaknesses . During this time , the warrior vowed loyalty to Poseidon and to protect his men . 
 After traveling through Delphi , the warrior obtained the venomous blood of a cerberus . Eventually , both Circe and the warrior encountered the general , who was revealed to be the warrior 's uncle . The general revealed that he killed the warrior 's father because he refused to join the general . Circe was then revealed to be the general 's lover who had only aided the warrior so he would reach the general , who planned to offer the warrior a chance to serve him in his warmongering conquests . The warrior refused , and Circe offered him with a choice ; to serve the general and his men would be spared from Circe 's wrath , or to kill the general and his men shall die . The Giver , who followed the two , reminded the warrior that if he were to kill the general , who was a member of his family , the oath he made to his father would be broken , yet if he killed Circe , his men would perish and the oath he made to protect his men would be broken . The warrior declared that he would not slay Circe and defended the lives of his men . He tricked the general into drinking from a cup he had secretly filled with the cerberus 's blood , which killed the general . Circe was aghast at the warrior 's vengeful act and retreated . Because the warrior killed his own uncle , the oath he made to his father was broken . The Giver revealed himself to be Orkos , the oath keeper of the Furies and the warrior was imprisoned by the Furies in the Prison of the Damned .

 = = Soundtrack = = 
 God of War : Ascension ( Original Soundtrack ) was composed by Tyler Bates and was released on iTunes on March 5 , 2013 by SCE and La @-@ La Land Records . It was included as DLC in the God of War : Ascension — Collector 's Edition and Special Edition . On October 15 , the soundtrack was made available for free on PSN for a limited time . A notable feature of Ascension 's soundtrack is that it was scored by only one composer ; all the previous games had multiple . Tyler Bates previously scored the similarly themed film 300 and game Rise of the Argonauts . Recorded at Abbey Road Studios with top musicians and vocalists , Bates said " My goal was to create a sound that supported the timeless dark age of God of War , while expanding the parameters of the ' Sword and Sandals ' genre . " He said that although the game 's story is linear , he approached the project as if he were scoring a novel as opposed to a film . Bates did not play any of the previous games and chose not to in order to take the score " to new places without being overtly aware of the great music that is emblematic of the first three installments of this storied franchise " . Rafe Pearlman and <unk> Nostalghia helped Bates and contributed their voices to the score ; Pearlman provided thematic voices and Nostalghia created the voice of the Furies . 
 Throughout the score , Bates uses a combination of techniques " to increase the drama of the game " said Emily McMillan of Game Music Online , who gave the album a 4 out of 5 stars . She said one of Bates 's signature techniques is " an intense and simultaneous crescendo and glissando . " All of the themes take place on a harmonic minor scale . On the track , " Warriors ' Truth " , Bates used Gerard Marino 's main God of War theme and " twists it for the prequel setting " , " taking the harmonic ascending scale and reverting it to a downwards pattern with a harsh choir / brass combination . " The track " Visions of Ruin " features the cimbalom , which is rarely used in video game soundtracks . She said overall " The music is powerful , rich , and pulsing " , though listening to the whole album can seem repetitive .

 God of War : Ascension received a generally favorable reception upon release . Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave it an average review score of 79 @.@ 34 % ( based on 58 reviews ) and 80 / 100 ( based on 89 reviews ) , respectively . Critics praised the fundamental gameplay and spectacle , but were critical of the lack of new ideas and gave a mixed response to the additional multiplayer mode . Alex Simmons of IGN said the redesigned combat system adds a source of depth : " Learning how to use each power effectively ... provides a strategic lifeline when there ’ s no energy re @-@ gen chest nearby " . Although he initially found the World Weapons useful , he felt that they became unnecessary after upgrading the Blades of Chaos . He praised the magic system , stating that since magic attacks are unlocked at a later time , " It 's a positive step " because players cannot rely on them as much as they may have done in previous installments , and it encourages players " to think wisely about where to allocate experience points rather than being the ultimate badass from the outset " . 
 Dale North of Destructoid praised the new gameplay mechanics , saying , " God of War has never looked or played better than this " . Xav de Matos of Joystiq said the combat is simpler than God of War III 's , and it rarely required much adjustment . Matos also said , " Combat always looks impressive and chaotic " . Simmons said the majority of the gameplay is balanced , and that Ascension " is probably the easiest " in the series , with the exception of the large amount of enemies in some sections where dying " feels cheap and frustrating " . He said the Trial of Archimedes will likely frustrate advanced players , and " is tougher than anything I 've played in a God of War game before " . Hollander Cooper of GamesRadar was critical of apparent shifts in difficulty at certain points , saying it " [ tests ] your patience , rather than your skills — including one that 's easily the most difficult section in any God of War game to date , for all the wrong reasons " . 
 Simmons said the story is not as compelling as previous installments , stating that in comparison to Zeus and Ares , " the Furies don 't quite cut it " . He said although the narrative is " meticulously delivered " , it " felt a bit incidental " . Matos said , " the narrative fabric woven throughout the franchise has begun to split " , and Ascension does little to enhance its characters " in any meaningful way " . According to Matos , the plot framing does not work and the narrative structure " is just too chaotic " with little room to process it . He did say though that the game provides the " distinct God of War flair " known to the series . 
 North noted the enhanced graphics engine stating , " from the glossy textures , slick animations , and ultra @-@ realistic lighting , there 's a shine and polish that runs throughout the game that makes it a perfect send @-@ off for the PS3 " . Similarly , Cooper wrote , " Kratos battles some of the most impressive foes he 's ever fought " , going on to say the visuals " are not only the best the franchise has seen , but some of the most impressive on the PlayStation 3 " . Edge magazine said , " Aesthetically , it 's a great fit for PS3 's twilight years " , but they had frustrations with the visual approach , such as some camera angles . 
 Matos was critical of the game 's multiplayer mode . He felt that the connection to the single @-@ player mode was " a weird narrative tie @-@ in " , and that although the gameplay translates well into the multiplayer element , " the entire experience may be too chaotic to enrapture a large audience " . He also worried that balance may be an issue over time . He praised the maps , stating they were well designed and approved of the elements that can give players an advantage . He said although the multiplayer mode can be fun and satisfying , " it doesn 't feel deep enough to command much more than a furiously dedicated fan following " . Simmons said the multiplayer mode is " a genuinely fresh addition ... that successfully carries over many of the hallmarks of the much @-@ loved single @-@ player [ game ] " . Of the multiplayer modes , he most enjoyed Team Favor of the Gods , but said that the combat does not offer enough depth " to make [ multiplayer ] a truly engaging experience " . He said as a result of experience points being easily acquired , " multiplayer feels more like a curiosity that provides a few hours of enjoyment rather than being an essential addition " . Edge said the multiplayer element is an " evolutionary step " with " some fine ideas ... that will form part of this genre ’ s future template " . Although " chaotic at first " and options being overwhelming , it " [ starts ] to make sense " as players learn the levels . Edge also said the fixed camera system is an asset because " you can always see exactly what ’ s going on and fight your opponents instead of the viewpoint " , and that the biggest success is the color @-@ coding system , which " effectively lets you know when you have an opening and when to run " .

 = William Cragh = 
 William Cragh ( born ca . 1262 , died some time after 1307 ) , or William the <unk> ( <unk> means " scabby " in Welsh ) , or William ap Rhys , was a medieval Welsh warrior and supporter of Rhys ap Maredudd , lord of the lands of Ystrad Tywi , in his rebellion against King Edward I of England . Captured in 1290 by the son of William de Briouze , the Cambro @-@ Norman Lord of Gower , he was tried and found guilty of having killed thirteen men . Cragh was executed just outside Swansea within sight of de Briouze 's Swansea Castle , twice , as the gallows collapsed during his first hanging . Lady Mary de Briouze decided for reasons unknown to intercede on Cragh 's behalf , and prayed to the deceased Bishop of Hereford , Thomas de Cantilupe , requesting him to ask God to bring Cragh back from the dead . Cragh began to show signs of life the day after his execution , and over the subsequent few weeks made a full recovery , living for at least another eighteen years . 
 The main primary source for Cragh 's story is the record of the investigation into the canonisation of Thomas de Cantilupe , which is held in the Vatican Library . Cragh 's resurrection was one of thirty @-@ eight miracles presented to the papal commissioners who in 1307 were charged with examining the evidence for Cantilupe 's saintliness . The hanged man himself gave evidence to the commission , after which nothing more is known of him . Cantilupe was formally canonised by Pope John XXII on 17 April 1320 . 
 = = Background = = 
 William Cragh was born in about 1262 in the Welsh parish of <unk> , Gower , to Rhys ap Gwilym and his wife <unk> . Between 1282 and 1283 King Edward I of England waged a military campaign in Wales that concluded with his annexation of that country . One of Edward 's allies , Rhys ap Maredudd , found the post @-@ war settlement unsatisfactory and launched a rebellion against the king in 1287 . Edward 's vastly superior forces soon crushed the uprising , but Rhys ap Maredudd remained at liberty until his capture and execution in 1292 . Cragh probably took part in the rebellion on the Welsh side . He was apprehended in 1290 by the son of William de Briouze , the Lord of Gower , who was defending his father 's lands against incursions by the rebels still at large . Cragh was one of 14 prisoners captured by de Briouze , 12 of whom were subsequently released . He was taken to Swansea Castle , where he was held in the dungeons awaiting trial , accused of killing 13 men . 
 The law in Wales at that time permitted condemned men to atone for their crimes by making a payment to their victims . Cragh 's friends and family rallied round to offer 100 cows to de Briouze for his release , but the offer was refused . The substantial scale of the proposed compensation indicates that Cragh was an important man , although some witnesses described him as a thief rather than a rebel . Historian Jussi Hanska has suggested that de Briouze 's refusal to accept the offer strengthens the case for Cragh being a rebel , as there is no other convincing reason to explain why he should have opted to " decline good income just to hang a thief " . 
 Cragh pleaded innocence of the charges against him , but he was nevertheless found guilty and sentenced to be hanged . 
 = = Execution = = 
 Cragh was hanged on a hill about a quarter of a mile ( 400 m ) outside Swansea , in sight of de Briouze 's Swansea Castle , on Monday 27 November 1290 . He was executed along with another " malefactor " , Trahaern ap Hywel . Although the latter was dealt with by the town executioner , Cragh was hanged by one of his own relatives , <unk> <unk> , who was forced into that service by de Briouze . Trahaern ap Hywel was a large and powerful man who struggled a great deal as he was hauled up from the ground by his neck , causing the crossbeam of the gallows to break . Although the executioner , John of Baggeham , considered both men to be already dead when they fell to the ground they were nevertheless hanged again , " as an insult to their kin " , and because it was the usual custom that hanged men could not be removed from the gallows without the lord 's permission . The execution took place early in the morning , and the two men were left swinging from the gallows . John of Baggeham reported that he cut down Cragh 's body at about 4 : 00 pm and sent it into the town at the request of William de Briouze 's wife , Lady Mary . It is unclear what became of Trahaern ap Hywel , but his body may have been buried by the gallows . 
 The younger William de Briouze visited the house in Swansea to which Cragh 's corpse had been taken that evening , and what he saw convinced him that Cragh was dead . Describing the scene some years later he recalled that : 
 His [ Cragh 's ] face was black and in parts bloody or stained with blood . His eyes had come out of their sockets and hung outside the eyelids and the sockets were filled with blood . His mouth , neck , and throat and the parts around them , and also his nostrils , were filled with blood , so that it was impossible in the natural course of things for him to breathe ... his tongue hung out of his mouth , the length of a man 's finger , and it was completely black and swollen and as thick with the blood sticking to it that it seemed the size of a man 's two fists together . 
 Witnesses reported that Cragh had voided his bowels and bladder while hanging from the gallows , which was considered at that time to be a sign of death . 
 = = Resurrection = = 
 Historian Robert Bartlett has commented that " one of the largest uncertainties in the whole story of the death and resurrection of William Cragh is why Lady Mary [ de Briouze ] interceded for him " , but intercede she did . John of Baggeham , when questioned about her motivation 18 years after the event , could only reply that " Lady Mary had sought the body of this William , he did not know why " . Before the execution she had asked her husband to spare the two condemned men , but he had refused . Then on hearing that Trahaern ap Hywel was dead , and believing that Cragh was still alive , she once again asked that he be handed over to her , but de Briouze delayed until he was convinced that Cragh was also dead . Then " he granted him [ Cragh ] to the said lady , such as he was , and ordered him to be taken down from the gallows " . Lady Mary had " a special devotion " to Thomas de Cantilupe , the deceased Bishop of Hereford , and in her own words , upon hearing of Cragh 's death , " on bended knee , she asked Saint Thomas de Cantilupe to ask God to restore life to William Cragh " . 
 Cantilupe had died in Italy on 25 August 1282 ; his flesh was buried in that country after having been boiled from his bones , which were taken back to England . Cantilupe 's tomb at Hereford Cathedral soon became the centre of a " pilgrim cult " , and miracles began to be attributed to him . Lady Mary sent one of her ladies @-@ in @-@ waiting to measure Cragh 's body with a length of thread , which implied a promise to offer to the saint a candle the length of the person on whose behalf the saint was being asked to intercede should the intercession be successful , a common practice during the medieval period . 
 Cragh 's recovery began the day after his hanging , but it was some time – one witness said 15 days – before he was able to stand unaided . That he did not recover more quickly cast doubt on the validity of the miracle , as miracles were supposed to be immediate , but " partial miracles " could be explained by the " lukewarm faith of those who had made the vow " . Once sufficiently recovered , Cragh was summoned to appear at Swansea Castle , before Lord and Lady Briouze . The chaplain , William of Codineston , was also present . Cragh explained , " with great fear and apprehension " according to the chaplain , that as he was being taken to the gallows he prayed to Thomas de Cantilupe to save him . His fear resulted from his concern that he might be executed again , and he had good reason to be worried . Although those who survived were usually pardoned , it was not unknown for them to be hanged again . Between the time of his hanging and his appearance at the castle Cragh may have convinced himself that he had been saved by Cantilupe , or he may simply have decided that it would be prudent for him to go along with the story for his own safety . Cragh went on to claim that as he was hanging from the gallows a bishop dressed all in white appeared , and saved him either by supporting his feet or by replacing his tongue in his mouth . 
 Once he was sufficiently recovered Cragh undertook a pilgrimage to Hereford , accompanied by Lord and Lady Briouze , to thank Cantilupe for restoring his life . He walked barefoot on the three @-@ day trip , wearing the rope he had been hanged with around his neck . The rope was left at Cantilupe 's shrine , after which Cragh said that he would make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land , although there is some doubt as to whether he subsequently even left Wales . Jussi Hanska has suggested that Cragh may have invented the pilgrimage story to escape from his companions . 
 = = Papal investigation = = 
 Richard Swinefield , Cantilupe 's successor as Bishop of Hereford , wrote to Pope Nicholas IV in a letter dated 19 April 1290 proposing the bishop for canonisation , but it was not until 1307 that an investigation into Cantilupe 's saintliness was initiated by Pope Clement V. For the canonisation process to succeed , convincing evidence of miracles that Cantilupe had performed since his death had to be presented , one of which was that William Cragh had been brought back from the dead by the bishop 's intercession . Three papal commissioners were appointed to conduct the inquiry : William de Testa , a papal tax collector in England , Ralph Baldock , Bishop of London , and William Durand the Younger , Bishop of Mende . 
 The investigation opened in London on 14 July 1307 . The first three of the nine witnesses to Cragh 's hanging to be heard were Lady Mary de Briouze , William Codineston , and the younger William de Briouze ; his father had died in 1291 . The commissioners were naturally curious about the details of the execution , because if Cragh had not actually been killed then there could clearly have been no miracle . William de Briouze was in no doubt that the hanging had been properly conducted , and pointed out it was customary that " if any subterfuge or trickery were discovered ... then the executioner himself would be hanged in turn " . He added that any deception could be ruled out because of the hatred that he and his father had for Cragh , whom he described as " the worst of malefactors " . The same point was made by William of Codineston : " the lord de Briouze and his justices , officials , and servants hated William Cragh very much and rejoiced greatly at his hanging and death " . 
 For the convenience of other witnesses the commission moved to Hereford , where it resumed on 18 August 1307 . The other six testifying to Cragh 's execution included the hanged man himself , despite William de Briouze 's stated belief that he had died of natural causes about two years earlier . The official language of the proceedings was ecclesiastical Latin , but Cragh spoke only Welsh , therefore two Franciscan friars from Hereford – John Young and Maurice of <unk> – were recruited as translators . Cragh is identified in the commission 's records by his Welsh name , William ap Rhys , " of the parish of Swansea in the diocese of Saint Davids " . Of the eight other witnesses called , five testified in French and three in English . In his evidence Cragh stated that he believed himself to have been about 28 at the time of his hanging , and that his last conscious memory as he was dangling at the end of the rope was of the noise made by the crowd when Trahaern was hanged beside him . He denied his earlier story of having seen a vision of a white @-@ clad bishop while he was hanging from the gallows , and instead claimed that the Virgin Mary had appeared to him on the morning of his execution , accompanied by " a lordly figure " she introduced as " St Thomas " , who she said would save him from the gallows . Under questioning Cragh said that he presumed the figure to be Cantilupe because he had been on pilgrimage to Cantilupe 's shrine in Hereford , and because on the day of his imprisonment he had " bent a penny ... to the honour of Saint Thomas so that he should liberate him " . After hearing his testimony the commissioners physically examined Cragh , to confirm that he was indeed the man who had been hanged 18 years earlier . Although they found no marks around his neck they did discover some scarring on his tongue , according to Cragh caused by him having bitten it while hanging . 
 The investigation was conducted in an inquisitorial style ; witnesses were not expected to make statements but only to respond to questions asked of them . Bartlett has observed that some of the questions asked by the commissioners were rather leading . During Cragh 's interrogation , for instance , he was asked if " in his country after the time of his hanging , it was publicly and commonly ascribed , and still is ascribed , to a miracle performed by the merits of the Lord Saint Thomas that he obtained and recovered life after the hanging " . Cragh of course had no motivation other than to answer " yes " , which he did . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Nothing more is known of Cragh after his testimony to the papal commission in 1307 . Thirty @-@ eight posthumous miracles attributed to Thomas de Cantilupe were examined by the commissioners and submitted for consideration by the pope and his advisors . Twelve were rejected after further analysis , including Cragh 's resurrection , but no reasons were recorded . Pope John XXII formally announced Cantilupe 's canonisation on 17 April 1320 , thirty @-@ eight years after the new saint 's death . 
 = Cyclops @-@ class monitor = 
 The Cyclops class monitor was a group of four ironclad breastwork monitors built for the Royal Navy during the 1870s . They were slightly modified versions of the Cerberus @-@ class monitors . The ships were ordered to satisfy demands for local defence during the war scare of 1870 , but the pace of construction slowed down tremendously as the perceived threat of war declined . The Cyclops @-@ class monitors spent most of their careers in reserve and were finally sold off in 1903 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The immediate reason why these ships were ordered was for local coast defence during the war scare during the Franco @-@ Prussian War of 1870 , but they were chosen for several other reasons . They were small and cheap , and their shallow draft was thought to limit them to defensive operations , which appealed to economy and defence @-@ minded Members of Parliament . The Admiralty , however , envisioned them attacking shallow @-@ water ports that larger ironclads could not enter and operating in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea . 
 The ships used the basic design of the Cerberus @-@ class breastwork monitors to reduce design and construction time . Their hulls were completed very quickly , but the pace of building reduced as the likelihood of their immediate use diminished . They were delivered to the Royal dockyards in 1872 and commissioned for fitting out , but a number of years elapsed before that process was completed as little sense of urgency remained . 
 The ships had an length between perpendiculars of 225 feet ( 68 @.@ 6 m ) , a beam of 45 feet ( 13 @.@ 7 m ) , and a draught of 16 feet 3 inches ( 4 @.@ 95 m ) at deep load . They displaced 3 @,@ 480 long tons ( 3 @,@ 540 t ) . Their crew consisted of 156 officers and men . 
 The Cyclops @-@ class ships and other ships of her type were described by Admiral George Alexander Ballard as being like " full @-@ armoured knights riding on donkeys , easy to avoid but bad to close with . " While not unfit to face heavy weather their decks were frequently awash in even a moderate sea . Their accommodations were rated the worst in the fleet , referred to by ordinary seamen as " <unk> with tinned air " . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The Cyclops @-@ class ships had two steam engines , each driving a single 12 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) propeller . Cyclops and Hydra had 4 @-@ cylinder inverted compound steam engines made by John Elder that had a working pressure of 60 psi ( 414 kPa ; 4 kgf / cm2 ) . The engines produced a total of 1 @,@ 472 – 1 @,@ 528 indicated horsepower ( 1 @,@ 098 – 1 @,@ 139 kW ) on sea trials which gave the ships a maximum speed around 11 knots ( 20 km / h ; 13 mph ) . The engines used by Hecate and Gorgon were built by Ravenhill and were simple horizontal 4 @-@ cylinder direct acting steam engines . Their working pressure was 34 psi ( 234 kPa ; 2 kgf / cm2 ) and they produced a total of 1 @,@ 579 – 1 @,@ 709 indicated horsepower ( 1 @,@ 177 – 1 @,@ 274 kW ) for about the same speed . The first pair of ships carried 250 long tons ( 250 t ) of coal while the second pair carried 270 long tons ( 270 t ) . This was enough to steam 3 @,@ 000 nmi ( 5 @,@ 600 km ; 3 @,@ 500 mi ) at 10 kn ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) .

The gun had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 365 ft / s ( 416 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal 12 @.@ 9 in ( 330 mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle . The guns could fire both solid shot and explosive shells . They were mounted on compound pivoting carriages that used hydraulic jacks to elevate and depress the guns .

 The Cyclops @-@ class ships had a complete waterline belt of wrought iron that was 8 inches ( 203 mm ) thick amidships and thinned to 6 inches ( 152 mm ) at the ends . The superstructure and conning tower was fully armoured , the reason it was called a breastwork , with 8 – 9 inches ( 203 – 229 mm ) of wrought iron . The gun turrets had 10 inches on their faces and nine inches on the sides and rear . All of the vertical armour was backed by 9 – 11 inches ( 229 – 279 mm ) of teak . The decks were 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 @.@ 1 mm ) thick .

 Although a recommendation had been made while the ships were still under construction to extend the superstructure out to the sides of the ship to improve their stability and habitability , this was not acted upon until they were refitted during the 1880s . This refit also strengthened the breastwork and upper decks , added another watertight bulkhead as well as a false keel . Four quick @-@ firing 3 @-@ pounder Hotchkiss guns were added on the breastwork for torpedo boat defence as well as five machine guns and several searchlights . This increased their crew to approximately 191 men and added 80 long tons ( 81 t ) to their displacement .

 HMS Gorgon was the first ship completed and she served as tender to HMS Cambridge , the gunnery school ship at Devonport , from 1874 to 1877 . All four ships were commissioned between April and August 1878 during the war scare during the Russo @-@ Turkish War for service with Admiral Sir Cooper Key 's Particular Service Squadron in Portland Harbour . She resumed her duties as tender to HMS Cambridge until she was refitted in 1888 – 89 . All four of the ships of the class participated in the annual fleet manoeuvers in 1887 , 1889 – 90 and 1892 ; in between times they were in Fleet Reserve . HMS Gorgon , like all of her sisters , was placed on the non @-@ effective list in 1901 and sold in 1903 for £ 8 @,@ 400 . 
 HMS Hydra was the next ship to be completed . After her service with the Particular Service Squadron she was paid off at Sheerness and served as tender to HMS Duncan . The ship was refitted in 1888 – 89 and was in Fleet Reserve at Chatham until 1901 . 
 HMS Cyclops , the lead ship of the class , was the third ship to be completed . She was placed in 1st Reserve after her completion . The ship was paid off at Chatham in August 1878 and refitted in 1887 – 89 . 
 HMS Hecate was the fourth and final ship of the class to be completed . She paid off at Devonport after her service with the Particular Service Squadron . The ship was refitted in 1885 – 86 and was placed into reserve at Devonport afterwards . 
 = Al @-@ Mu 'tadid = 
 Abu 'l @-@ Abbas Ahmad ibn Talha al @-@ Muwaffaq ( 854 or 861 – 5 April 902 ) , better known by his regnal name al @-@ Mu 'tadid bi @-@ <unk> ( Arabic : <unk> بالله , " Seeking Support in God " ) was the Abbasid Caliph in Baghdad from 892 until his death in 902 . 
 Al @-@ Mu 'tadid was the son of al @-@ Muwaffaq , who was the regent and virtual ruler of the Abbasid state during the reign of his brother , Caliph al @-@ Mu 'tamid . As a prince , the future al @-@ Mu 'tadid served under his father in various military campaigns , most notably in the suppression of the Zanj Rebellion , in which he played a major role . When al @-@ Muwaffaq died in June 891 al @-@ Mu 'tadid succeeded him as regent . He quickly sidelined his cousin and heir @-@ apparent al @-@ Mufawwad , and when al @-@ Mu 'tamid died in October 892 , he succeeded to the throne . Like his father , al @-@ Mu 'tadid 's power depended on his close relations with the army , first forged in the campaigns against the Zanj and reinforced in later expeditions which the Caliph led in person : al @-@ Mu 'tadid would prove to be the most militarily active of all Abbasid caliphs . Through his energy and ability , he succeeded in restoring to the Abbasid state some of the power and provinces it had lost during the turmoil of the previous decades . 
 In a series of campaigns he recovered the Jazira , Thughur and Jibal , and effected a rapprochement with the Saffarids in the east and the Tulunids in the west that secured their — albeit largely nominal — recognition of caliphal suzerainty . These successes came at the cost of gearing the economy almost exclusively towards maintenance of the army , which resulted in the expansion and rise to power of the central fiscal bureaucracy and contributed to the Caliph 's lasting reputation for avarice . Al @-@ Mu 'tadid was also renowned for his cruelty when punishing criminals , and subsequent chroniclers record his extensive and ingenious use of torture . His reign also saw the permanent move of the capital back to Baghdad , where he engaged in major building activities . 
 Despite his successes , al @-@ Mu 'tadid 's reign was ultimately too short to effect a lasting reversal of the Caliphate 's fortunes , and the " Abbasid revival " that he spearheaded was too dependent on the presence of capable personalities at the helm of the state . The brief reign of his less able son and heir , al @-@ Muktafi , still saw some major gains , but his later successors lacked his energy . In addition , the factionalism within the bureaucracy that had become apparent during the later years of al @-@ Mu 'tadid 's reign would debilitate the Abbasid government for decades to come , leading to the subjugation of the Caliphate to a series of military strongmen , culminating in the conquest of Baghdad by the Buyids in 946 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Al @-@ Mu 'tadid was born Ahmad , the son of Talha , one of the sons of the Caliph al @-@ Mutawakkil ( r . 847 – 861 ) , and a Greek slave named <unk> . The exact date of his birth is unknown ; as he is variously recorded as being thirty @-@ eight or thirty @-@ one years old at the time of his accession , he was born either in ca . 854 or ca . 861 . In 861 , al @-@ Mutawakkil was murdered , beginning a period of internal turmoil , known as the " Anarchy at Samarra " from the site of the Caliphate 's capital , which ended in 870 with the rise to the throne of Ahmad 's uncle , al @-@ Mu 'tamid . Real power however had come to lie with the elite Turkish troops and with Ahmad 's own father , Talha , who , as the Caliphate 's main military commander , served as the chief intermediary between the caliphal government and the Turks . Assuming the honorific name al @-@ Muwaffaq in the style of the caliphs , Talha soon became the effective ruler of the Caliphate , a position consolidated in 882 after a failed attempt by al @-@ Mu 'tamid to flee to Egypt led to his confinement in house arrest . 
 Caliphal authority in the provinces collapsed during the " Anarchy at Samarra " , with the result that by the 870s the central government had lost effective control over most of the Caliphate outside the metropolitan region of Iraq . In the west , Egypt had fallen under the control of Ahmad ibn Tulun , who also disputed control of Syria with al @-@ Muwaffaq , while Khurasan and most of the Islamic East had been taken over by the Saffarids , who replaced the Abbasids ' loyal clients , the Tahirids . Most of the Arabian peninsula was likewise lost to local potentates , while in Tabaristan a radical Zaydi Shi 'a dynasty took power . Even in Iraq , the rebellion of the Zanj slaves threatened Baghdad itself , and further south the Qarmatians were a nascent threat . Al @-@ Muwaffaq 's regency was thus a continuous struggle to save the tottering Caliphate from collapse . His attempts to recover control of Egypt and Syria from Ibn Tulun failed , with the latter even able to expand his territory and obtain his recognition as hereditary ruler , but he succeeded in preserving the core of the Caliphate in Iraq by repelling a Saffarid invasion aiming to capture Baghdad , and by subduing the Zanj after a long struggle . 
 It was against the Zanj that the future al @-@ Mu 'tadid — at this time usually referred to by his kunya of Abu 'l @-@ Abbas — would acquire his first military experience and establish the close ties with the army that would characterize his reign . Al @-@ Muwaffaq gave his son a military training from an early age , and the young prince became " a keen horseman and took care to inspect both his troops and their mounts in person " ( Hugh N. Kennedy ) . 
 Within a decade from the outbreak of the revolt in 869 , the Zanj had seized most of lower Iraq , including the cities of Basra and Wasit , and expanded into Khuzistan as well . In 879 the death of the founder of the Saffarid state , Ya 'qub al @-@ Saffar , allowed the Abbasid government to fully concentrate its attention against the Zanj rebellion , and Abu 'l @-@ Abbas ' appointment in December 879 to command against the rebels at the head of 10 @,@ 000 troops marks the turning @-@ point of the war . In the long and hard struggle that followed , which involved amphibious operations in the Mesopotamian Marshes , Abu 'l @-@ Abbas and his own military slaves ( ghilman ) — of which the long @-@ serving <unk> al @-@ Turki was the chief — played the major role : although the Abbasid armies eventually swelled with reinforcements , volunteers , and Zanj defectors , it was the few but elite ghilman who formed the army 's backbone , filling its leadership positions and bearing the brunt of the battle , often under the personal command of Abu 'l @-@ Abbas . After years of gradually tightening the noose around the Zanj , in August 883 the Abbasid troops stormed their capital of al @-@ <unk> , putting an end to the rebellion . The detailed account of the war , written by a former Zanj rebel and preserved in the history of al @-@ Tabari , stresses the role of al @-@ Muwaffaq and Abu 'l @-@ Abbas as the heroes who , in defence of the embattled Muslim state , suppressed the rebellion ; the successful campaign would become a major tool in their propaganda effort to legitimize their de facto usurpation of the Caliph 's power . 
 Following the death of Ibn Tulun in May 884 , the two caliphal generals Ishaq ibn Kundaj and Ibn Abu 'l @-@ Saj sought to take advantage of the situation and attacked the Tulunid domains in Syria , but their initial gains were rapidly reversed . In the spring of 885 , Abu 'l @-@ Abbas was sent to take charge of the invasion . He soon succeeded in defeating the Tulunids and forcing them to retreat to Palestine , but after a quarrel with Ibn Kundaj and Ibn Abu 'l @-@ Saj , the latter abandoned the campaign and withdrew their forces . In the Battle of Tawahin on 6 April , Abu 'l @-@ Abbas confronted Ibn Tulun 's son and heir , Khumarawayh , in person . The Abbasid prince was initially victorious , forcing Khumarawayh to flee , but was in turn defeated and fled the battlefield , while much of his army was taken prisoner . After this victory the Tulunids expanded their control over the Jazira and the borderlands ( the Thughur ) with the Byzantine Empire . A peace agreement followed in 886 , whereby al @-@ Muwaffaq was forced to recognize Khumarawayh as hereditary governor over Egypt and Syria for 30 years , in exchange for an annual tribute . Over the next couple of years , Abu 'l @-@ Abbas was involved in his father 's ultimately unsuccessful attempts to wrest control of Fars from Saffarid control . 
 During this period , the relations between Abu 'l @-@ Abbas and his father deteriorated , although the reason is unclear . Already in 884 , Abu 'l @-@ Abbas ' ghilman rioted in Baghdad against al @-@ Muwaffaq 's vizier , Sa 'id ibn Makhlad , possibly over unpaid salaries . Eventually , in 889 , Abu 'l @-@ Abbas was arrested and put in prison on his father 's orders , where he remained despite the demonstrations of the ghilman loyal to him . He apparently remained under arrest until May 891 , when al @-@ Muwaffaq , already nearing his death , returned to Baghdad after two years he spent in Jibal . Al @-@ Muwaffaq , suffering from gout , was already visibly nearing his end ; the vizier Isma 'il ibn Bulbul and the city commander of Baghdad , Abu 'l @-@ Saqr , called al @-@ Mu 'tamid and his sons , including the heir @-@ apparent al @-@ Mufawwad , into the city , hoping to exploit al @-@ Muwaffaq 's imminent death for their own purposes . Nevertheless , the popularity of Abu 'l @-@ Abbas with the soldiers and the common people was such that he was set free , his opponents ' houses were ransacked by the mob , and the attempt to sideline him failed . 
 Thus , when al @-@ Muwaffaq died in June 891 , Abu 'l @-@ Abbas succeeded him immediately in his offices , with the title of al @-@ Mu 'tadid bi @-@ <unk> and a position in the line of succession after the Caliph and al @-@ Mufawwad . Within a few months , in April 892 , al @-@ Mu 'tadid had his cousin removed from the succession — and probably killed — so that when al @-@ Mu 'tamid died in October , possibly poisoned , he succeeded to the throne as caliph .

 Harold Bowen describes al @-@ Mu 'tadid at his accession as " in appearance upright and thin ; and on his head was a white mole , which , since white moles were not admired , he used to dye black . His expression was haughty . In character he was brave — a story was told of his killing a lion with only a dagger . [ ... ] he had inherited all his father 's energy , and cultivated a reputation of prompt action . " Like his father , al @-@ Mu 'tadid ’ s power rested on his close relations with the military , and it was military activities which consumed his interest , especially as he usually led his army in person on campaign . As the historian Michael Bonner comments , " [ t ] he role of ' <unk> caliph ' , invented by Harun al @-@ Rashid and enhanced by al @-@ Mu 'tasim , now had its greatest performance , in al @-@ Mu 'tadid 's tireless campaigning " . 
 = = = Campaigns of reunification = = = 
 From the start of his reign , the new Caliph set out to reverse the fragmentation of the Abbasid Caliphate , a goal towards with he worked by a mixture of force and diplomacy ; although an active and enthusiastic campaigner , al @-@ Mu 'tadid was also " a skilful diplomat , always prepared to make compromises with those who were too powerful to defeat " ( Hugh Kennedy ) . This policy became immediately evident in the conciliatory attitude the new Caliph adopted towards his most powerful vassal , the Tulunids : in spring 893 , al @-@ Mu 'tadid recognized and reconfirmed Khumarawayh in his office as autonomous emir over Egypt and Syria , in exchange for an annual tribute of 300 @,@ 000 dinars and further 200 @,@ 000 dinars in arrears , as well as the return to caliphal control of the two Jaziran provinces of Diyar Rabi 'a and Diyar Mudar . In order to seal the pact , Khumarawayh offered his daughter , <unk> al @-@ Nada ( " Dew Drop " ) as bride to one of the Caliph 's sons , but al @-@ Mu 'tadid chose to marry her himself . The Tulunid princess brought with her a million dinars as her dowry , a " wedding gift that was considered the most sumptuous in medieval Arab history " ( Th . Bianquis ) . Her arrival in Baghdad was marked by the luxury and extravagance of her retinue , which contrasted starkly with the impoverished caliphal court . According to a story , after a thorough search , al @-@ Mu 'tadid 's chief eunuch could only find five ornate silver @-@ and @-@ gold candlesticks to decorate the palace , while the princess was accompanied by 150 servants each carrying such a candlestick . Thereupon al @-@ Mu 'tadid is said to have remarked " come let us go and hide ourselves , lest we be seen in our poverty " . <unk> al @-@ Nada died soon after the wedding , and the murder of Khumarawayh in 896 left the Tulunid state in the unsteady hands of Khumarawayh 's under @-@ age sons . Al @-@ Mu 'tadid swiftly took advantage of this and in 897 extended his control over the border emirates of the Thughur , where , in the words of Michael Bonner , " [ he ] assumed , after a long hiatus , the old caliphal prerogative of commanding the annual summer expedition and arranging the defence against the Byzantine empire " . In addition , to secure caliphal recognition of his position , the new Tulunid ruler Harun ibn Khumarawayh ( r . 896 – 904 ) was forced to further concessions , handing back all of Syria north of Homs , and increasing the annual tribute to 450 @,@ 000 dinars . Over the next few years , increasing domestic turmoil in the remaining Tulunid domains , and the escalation of Qarmatian attacks , encouraged many Tulunid followers to defect to the resurgent Caliphate . 
 In the Jazira the new Caliph struggled against a variety of opponents : alongside an almost thirty @-@ year @-@ old Kharijite rebellion , there were various autonomous local magnates , chiefly the Shaybani ruler of Amid and Diyar Bakr , Ahmad ibn Isa al @-@ Shaybani , and the Taghlibi chief Hamdan ibn Hamdun . In 893 , while the Kharijites were distracted by internal quarrels , al @-@ Mu 'tadid captured Mosul from the Shayban . Next , in 895 Hamdan ibn Hamdun was evicted from his strongholds , hunted down and captured . Finally , the Kharijite leader Harun ibn Abdallah himself was defeated and captured by Hamdan 's son Husayn in 896 , before being sent to Baghdad , where he was crucified . This exploit marked the beginning of an illustrious career for Husayn ibn Hamdan in the caliphal armies , and the gradual rise of the Hamdanid family to power in the Jazira . Ahmad al @-@ Shaybani retained Amid until his death in 898 , being succeeded by his son Muhammad . In the next year , al @-@ Mu 'tadid returned to the Jazira , ousted Muhammad from Amid , and reunified the entire province under central government control by installing his son and heir , Ali al @-@ Muktafi , as governor . 
 Al @-@ Mu 'tadid was unable , however , to restore effective caliphal control north of the Jazira in Transcaucasia , where Armenia and Adharbayjan remained in the hands of virtually independent local dynasties . Ibn Abu 'l @-@ Saj , who was now the caliphal governor of Adharbayjan , proclaimed himself independent in ca . 898 , although soon he recognized again the Caliph 's suzerainty during his conflicts with the Christian Armenian princes . When he died in 901 , he was succeeded by his son <unk> , marking the consolidation of the semi @-@ independent Sajid dynasty in the region . In 900 Ibn Abu 'l @-@ Saj was even suspected of plotting to seize the Diyar Mudar province with the co @-@ operation of the notables of Tarsus , after which the vengeful Caliph ordered the latter arrested and the city 's fleet burned . This decision was a major self @-@ inflicted wound on the centuries @-@ long war against Byzantium , for in the past decades the Tarsians and their fleet had played a major role in the raids against the Byzantine frontier provinces . While a Syrian fleet under the renegade Damian of Tarsus sacked the port of Demetrias in ca . 900 , and Arab fleets would go on wreak havoc in the Aegean Sea over the next two decades , on land , the Byzantines , strengthened by an influx of Armenian refugees like Melias , began to expand their control over the border regions , scoring victories and founding new provinces ( themes ) in the former no @-@ man 's land between the two empires . 
 In the Islamic East , the Caliph was forced to acknowledge the reality of the Saffarids ' domination and established a modus vivendi with them , perhaps hoping , according to Hugh Kennedy , to harness them in a partnership analogous to that which the Tahirids had enjoyed in previous decades . Consequently , the Saffarids were recognized in their possession of Khurasan and eastern Persia as well as Fars , while the Abbasids were to exercise direct control over western Persia , namely Jibal , Rayy and Isfahan . This policy gave the Caliph free hand to recover the territories of the Dulafids , another semi @-@ independent local dynasty that was centred on Isfahan and <unk> . When the Dulafid Ahmad ibn Abd al @-@ Aziz ibn Abi <unk> died in 893 , al @-@ Mu 'tadid moved swiftly to install his son al @-@ Muktafi as governor in Rayy , Qazvin , Qum and Hamadan . The Dulafids were confined to their core region around <unk> and Isfahan , before being deposed outright in 896 . Nevertheless , Abbasid hold over these territories remained precarious , especially due to the proximity of the Zaydi emirate in Tabaristan , and in 897 Rayy was handed over to Saffarid control . 
 The Abbasid – Saffarid partnership in Iran was most clearly expressed in their joint effort against the general Rafi ibn Harthama , who had made his base in Rayy and posed a threat to both caliphal and Saffarid interests in the region . Al @-@ Mu 'tadid sent Ahmad ibn Abd al @-@ Aziz to seize Rayy from Rafi , who fled and made common cause with the <unk> of Tabaristan in an effort to seize Khurasan from the Saffarids . However , with Amr mobilizing the anti @-@ Alid sentiments of the populace against him and the expected assistance from the <unk> failing to materialize , Rafi was defeated and killed in Khwarazm in 896 . Amr , now at the pinnacle of his power , sent the defeated rebel 's head to Baghdad , and in 897 the Caliph transferred control of Rayy to him . The partnership finally collapsed after Mu 'tadid appointed the Saffarid ruler Amr ibn al @-@ Layth in 898 as governor of Transoxiana , which was ruled by his rivals , the Samanids . Al @-@ Mu 'tamid deliberately encouraged Amr to confront the Samanids , only for Amr to be crushingly defeated and taken prisoner by the latter in 900 . The Samanid ruler , Isma 'il ibn Ahmad , sent him in chains to Baghdad , where he was executed in 902 , after al @-@ Mu 'tadid 's death . Al @-@ Mu 'tadid in turn conferred Amr 's titles and governorships to Isma 'il ibn Ahmad . The Caliph also moved to regain Fars and Kirman , but the Saffarid remnant under Tahir proved sufficiently resilient to thwart the Abbasid attempts at capturing these two provinces for several years . It was not until 910 that the Abbasids managed to regain the coveted Fars province . 
 At the same time , the Caliphate faced a new threat , the Qarmatians . A radical Islamic sect founded in Kufa around 874 , the Qarmatians were originally a sporadic and minor nuisance in the Sawad , but their power grew swiftly to alarming proportions after 897 : under the leadership of Abu Sa 'id al @-@ Jannabi , they seized Bahrayn in 899 and in the next year defeated a caliphal army under al @-@ Abbas ibn Amr al @-@ <unk> . In the years following al @-@ Mu 'tadid 's death , the Qarmatians " were to prove the most dangerous enemies the Abbasids had faced since the time of the Zanj " ( Hugh Kennedy ) . The same period also saw more anti @-@ Abbasid regimes established on the periphery of the Islamic world : the Fatimids seized power in Ifriqiya , and another Zaydi dynasty was established in Yemen . 
 = = = Domestic government = = = 
 The Abbasid army , following the reforms of al @-@ Mu 'tasim , was a smaller and more professional fighting force than the caliphal armies of the past . Although it proved militarily highly effective , it also posed a potential danger to the stability of the Abbasid regime : drawn from Turks and other peoples from the Caliphate 's periphery and the lands beyond , it was alienated from the society of the Caliphate 's heartlands , with the result that the soldiers were " entirely reliant on the state not just for cash but for their very survival " ( Hugh Kennedy ) . As a result , any failure by the central government to provide their pay resulted in a military uprising and a political crisis , as was demonstrated in the Anarchy at Samarra . Consequently , ensuring the regular payment of the army became the prime task of the state . According to Hugh Kennedy , based on a treasury document from the time of al @-@ Mu 'tadid 's accession , " out the total expenditure of <unk> dinars per day , some <unk> are entirely military , 1943 in areas ( like riding animals and stables ) which served both military and non @-@ military and only 851 in areas like the bureaucracy and the harem which can be described as truly civilian ( though even in this case , the bureaucrats ’ main purpose seems to have been to arrange the payment of the army ) . It seems reasonable to conclude that something over 80 per cent of recorded government expenditure was devoted to maintaining the army . " 
 At the same time , however , the Caliphate ' fiscal basis had shrunk dramatically after so many tax @-@ paying provinces had been lost from the central government 's control . The caliphal government was now increasingly reliant on the revenue of the Sawad and the other areas of lower Iraq , but there the 9th century witnessed a rapid decline in agricultural productivity due to the disruption of the civil wars and neglect of the irrigation network : by the early 10th century the Sawad , which in the reign of Harun al @-@ Rashid provided annual revenue of 102 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 dirhams — more than double the revenue of Egypt and three times that of Syria — provided less than a third of that figure . The situation was further exacerbated by the fact that in the remaining provinces , semi @-@ autonomous governors , grandees and members of the dynasty were able to establish virtual latifundia , aided by the system of <unk> 'a , a form of tax farming in exchange for a fixed tribute , which they often failed to pay . To maximise their revenue from the territory remaining to them , the Abbasids increased the breadth and complexity of the central bureaucracy , dividing the provinces into smaller tax districts as well as increasing the number of the fiscal departments ( <unk> ) , allowing for a far closer oversight of both revenue collection and the activities of the officials themselves . 
 To combat this fiscal crisis , the Caliph would often personally devote himself to the supervision of revenue , acquiring a reputation for " a spirit of economy , verging on avarice " ( F. Malti @-@ Douglas ) ; he was said to " examine petty accounts that a commoner would scorn to consider " ( Harold Bowen ) . Fines and confiscations multiplied under his rule , with the resulting revenue , along with the income from the crown domain and even a portion of the provincial taxation , flowing to the caliphal privy purse ( bayt mal al @-@ <unk> ) . The latter now acquired a leading role among the other fiscal departments , and it frequently held more money than the public treasury ( bayt mal al @-@ <unk> ) itself . By the end of al @-@ Mu 'tadid 's reign , the once empty privy purse would contain ten million dinars . On the other hand , in gesture aimed to ease the tax burden of the farmers , in 895 the Caliph changed the start of the tax year from the Persian New Year in March to 11 June — which became known as <unk> al @-@ Mu 'tadid , " al @-@ Mu 'tadid 's New Year " — so that the land tax ( kharāj ) was now collected after the harvest instead of before . 
 The Caliph 's policies strengthened the position of the civil bureaucracy , which now reached the apogee of its influence , and especially the vizier , whom even the army came to respect as the spokesman of the caliph . In terms of personnel , al @-@ Mu 'tadid 's reign was marked by continuity among the senior leadership of the state . Ubayd Allah ibn Sulayman ibn Wahb remained vizier from the start of the reign until his death in 901 , and was succeeded by his son , al @-@ Qasim , who had from the start been <unk> his father during the latter 's absences from the capital . The freedman Badr , a veteran who had served under al @-@ Muwaffaq and whose daughter married the Caliph 's son , remained commander of the army . The fiscal departments , especially of the Sawad ( Lower Iraq ) , were managed first by the Banu 'l @-@ Furat brothers Ahmad and Ali , and after 899 by the Banu 'l @-@ Jarrah under Muhammad ibn Dawud and his nephew , Ali ibn Isa . The original administrative team was so effective and harmonious that according to the 11th @-@ century historian Hilal as @-@ Sabi , it was said by subsequent generations that " there had never been such a quartet , Caliph , Vizier , Commander , and chief of the <unk> , as al @-@ Mu 'tadid , Ubayd Allah , Badr and Ahmad ibn al @-@ Furat " . On the other hand , Michel Bonner points out that the later reign of al @-@ Mu 'tadid " saw a growth of factionalism within this bureaucracy , observable also in the army and in urban civilian life " . The rivalry between the two bureaucratic dynasties of the Banu 'l @-@ Furat and the Banu 'l @-@ Jarrah , with their extensive networks of clients , began at this time . Although a strong caliph and vizier could restrain this rivalry , it would dominate the Abbasid government over the next decades , with the factions alternating in office and often fining and torturing their predecessors to extract money according to a well @-@ established practice known as <unk> . In addition , al @-@ Qasim ibn Ubayd Allah was of an altogether different character than his father : soon after his appointment , he plotted to have al @-@ Mu 'tadid assassinated , and tried to involve Badr in his scheming . The general rejected his proposals with indignation , but al @-@ Qasim was saved from discovery and execution by the Caliph 's sudden death . The vizier then tried to dominate al – Muktafi , moved swiftly to have Badr denounced and executed , and was involved in yet more intrigues against the Banu 'l @-@ Furat . 
 Al @-@ Mu 'tadid also completed the return of the capital from Samarra to Baghdad , which had already served as his father 's main base of operations . The city 's centre , however , was relocated on the eastern bank of the Tigris and further downstream of the original city , where it has remained to this day . As the 10th @-@ century historian al @-@ Mas 'udi wrote , the Caliph 's two main passions were " women and building " ( al @-@ <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , and accordingly he engaged in major building activities in the capital : he restored and expanded the Great Mosque of al @-@ Mansur which had fallen into disuse , enlarged the Hasani palace , built the new palaces of Thurayya ( " Pleiades " ) and <unk> ( " Paradise " ) , and began work on the Taj ( " Crown " ) Palace , which was completed under al @-@ Muktafi . He also took care to restore the city 's irrigation network , cleaning up the silted @-@ up <unk> canal , paying for it with money from those landowners who stood to profit from it . 
 In terms of doctrine , al @-@ Mu 'tadid from the outset of his reign sided firmly with Sunni traditionalist orthodoxy , forbidding theological works , and abolishing the fiscal department on property in escheat , which Hanbali legal opinion regarded as illegal . At the same time he also tried to maintain good relations with the Alids , to the point of seriously considering ordering the official cursing of Mu 'awiya , the first Umayyad caliph and author of the death of Ali ; he was only dissuaded at the last moment by his advisers , who feared what unforeseen consequences such an act might have . Al @-@ Mu 'tadid also maintained good relations with the breakaway Zaydi imams of Tabaristan , but his pro @-@ Alid stance failed to prevent the establishment of the second Zaydi state in Yemen in 901 . 
 In the dispensation of justice , he was characterized by what F. Malti @-@ Douglas describes as " severity bordering on sadism " . While tolerant of error and not above displays of tenderness , when his wrath was aroused he resorted to torture in the most ingenious ways , and had special torture chambers constructed underneath his palace . Chroniclers like al @-@ Mas 'udi and the Mamluk historian al @-@ Safadi describe in great detail the tortures inflicted by the Caliph on prisoners , as well as his practice of making an example of them by having them publicly displayed in Baghdad . At the same time , however , they tend to justify his severity as legitimate , in service of the interests of the state . F. Malti @-@ Douglas remarks that when al @-@ Safadi compared al @-@ Mu 'tadid with the founder of the Abbasid state , calling him " al @-@ Saffah the Second " , this was not only to emphasize his restoration of the Caliphate 's fortunes , but also a direct allusion to the meaning of al @-@ Saffah 's name , " the Blood @-@ <unk> " . 
 = = = Death and legacy = = = 
 Al @-@ Mu 'tadid died at the Hasani palace on 5 April 902 , at the age of either 40 or 47 . There were rumours that he had been poisoned , but it is more likely that the rigours of his campaigns , coupled with his dissipate life , severely weakened his health . During his final illness , he refused to follow the advice of his physicians , and even kicked one of them to death . Al @-@ Mu 'tadid was the first Abbasid caliph to be buried within the walls of Baghdad . Like his sons after him , he was buried in the former Tahirid palace in the western part of the city , which was now used by the caliphs as a secondary residence . 
 According to the Orientalist Karl Vilhelm <unk> , al @-@ Mu 'tadid " had inherited his father 's gifts as a ruler and was distinguished alike for his economy and his military ability " , becoming " one of the greatest of the Abbasids in spite of his strictness and cruelty " . Al @-@ Mu 'tadid 's capable reign is credited with having arrested the Abbasid Caliphate 's decline for a while , but his successes were too dependent on the presence of an energetic ruler at the helm , and ultimately his reign " was too short to reverse long @-@ term trends and re @-@ establish Abbasid power on a long @-@ term basis " ( Hugh Kennedy ) . 
 Al @-@ Mu 'tadid had taken care to prepare his son and successor , al @-@ Muktafi , for his role by appointing him as governor in Rayy and the Jazira . Although al @-@ Muktafi tried to follow his father 's policies , he lacked his energy . The heavily militarized system of al @-@ Muwaffaq and al @-@ Mu 'tadid required the Caliph to actively participate in campaigns , setting a personal example and allowing for the formation of ties of loyalty , reinforced by patronage , between the ruler and the soldiers . Al @-@ Muktafi , on the other hand , did not " in his character and comportment [ ... ] , being a sedentary figure , instil much loyalty , let alone inspiration , in the soldiers " ( Michael Bonner ) . The Caliphate was still able to secure major successes over the next few years , including the reincorporation of the Tulunid domains in 904 and victories over the Qarmatians , but with al @-@ Muktafi 's death in 908 , the so @-@ called " Abbasid restoration " passed its high @-@ water mark , and a new period of crisis began . 
 Power was now wielded by the senior bureaucrats , who installed the weak and pliable al @-@ Muqtadir on the throne . Over the next decades , the expenditure of both the court and the army increased , while maladministration and strife between military and bureaucratic factions intensified . By 932 , when al @-@ Muqtadir was assassinated , the Caliphate was effectively bankrupt , and authority soon devolved on a series of military strongmen who competed for control of the caliph and the title of amir al @-@ umara . This process culminated in the capture of Baghdad in 946 by the Buyids , who put an end to caliphal independence even in name . Thereafter the caliphs remained as symbolic figureheads , but were divested of any military or political authority or independent financial resources .

 Elmer Ernest Southard ( July 28 , 1876 – February 8 , 1920 ) was an American <unk> , neuropathologist , professor and author . Born in Boston , Massachusetts , Southard lived in the city for nearly his entire life . He attended Boston Latin School and completed his education at Harvard University . At Harvard , Southard distinguished himself as a chess player . After briefly studying in Germany , he returned to the United States as a pathologist at Danvers State Hospital . Southard held academic appointments at Harvard University and its medical school . 
 He headed the Boston Psychopathic Hospital when it opened in 1912 , pioneering the study of brain pathology with particular interests in shell shock and schizophrenia . Southard published several books , including Shell Shock and Other Neuropsychiatric Problems with nearly 1 @,@ 000 case histories . He was president of the American Medico @-@ Psychological Association and the Boston Society of Psychiatry and Neurology , and held advisory positions with the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service and the Eugenics Record Office . 
 An influential mentor , Southard guided several well @-@ known figures in medicine and psychology . He worked with neuropathologist <unk> Canavan early in her career , and used his influence to obtain a promotion for her in Boston . Southard introduced Karl Menninger to psychiatry , and Menninger later helped establish the foundation which bears his family name . Comparative psychologist Robert Yerkes called Southard " my master of psychopathology . " 
 Southard was married to physician and Wellesley College professor Mabel Fletcher Austin , and they had three children . His interest in chess continued throughout his life , and he enjoyed intellectual gatherings at the home of art collector and friend Walter Arensberg . At the age of 43 , Southard died of pneumonia in 1920 during a trip to New York City to deliver lectures to two medical societies . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Southard was born in Boston in 1876 to Martin Southard and Olive Wentworth Knowles . His paternal ancestors included Mayflower passenger and Plymouth Colony leader Myles Standish . Olive Southard was descended from early residents of New Hampshire and Maine . Frederick Parker Gay , one of E. E. Southard 's longtime friends and his posthumous biographer , wrote that Southard 's parents were only modestly successful academically . His mother was a schoolteacher for several years ; his father , who supervised a cotton @-@ waste factory and established a trucking business , earned enough money to ensure that Southard did not have to work during his undergraduate and graduate studies . 
 Southard 's mother said that once he learned to read , he took full responsibility for his education . He was influenced academically by a paternal aunt , a Greek scholar who had graduated from Oberlin College . One of his cousins was a prominent attorney in Bath , England . Southard attended Boston Latin School , where his father , aunt and headmaster Arthur Irving Fiske sparked a lifelong interest in language and the meaning of words . Despite a tall , solid build and walking about 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) a day to school , he was awkward at manual labor and athletics . Southard graduated from Boston Latin School in 1893 with awards for reading and essay @-@ writing . 
 He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Harvard College in 1897 . As an undergraduate , Southard 's path was shaped by several notable faculty members . He learned about comparative anatomy and the nervous system from biologist George Howard Parker , studied psychology under William James , took a class in logic taught by Josiah Royce and graduated with a degree in philosophy . Southard then entered Harvard Medical School ; despite his previous academic success and aptitude for science he struggled in several courses focused on medicine , receiving C 's and a D. At Harvard Southard was a noted chess player , and was described as Harvard 's best player in an 1899 newspaper article on an Ivy League chess tournament : " It is probable that as long as he is engaged in the tournament , Harvard will win the cup . " Through the chess team he became lifelong friends with Walter Arensberg , who became a noted art collector . 
 Southard received his medical degree in 1901 . In 1902 , Southard went to Germany and studied medicine at the Senckenberg Institute and Heidelberg University for six months .

 After returning from Germany , Southard interned in pathology at Boston City Hospital and became an instructor at Harvard Medical School in 1904 . From 1906 to 1909 , he was an assistant pathologist at Danvers State Hospital . Southard was named assistant professor of psychology at Harvard University and Bullard Professor of Neuropathology at Harvard Medical School in 1909 , titles he held until his death . That year , he also became a pathologist for the Massachusetts Commission on Mental Diseases . 
 In 1911 Southard and his laboratory assistant , Emma Mooers , contracted a streptococcal infection during an autopsy . Mooers died and Southard developed <unk> in his arm , undergoing aggressive surgery and recovering over several months . Although he wrote an outline of his autobiography and traveled extensively in Europe during his convalescence , he felt unable to concentrate on research and referred to this period as " the wasted year " . Southard led the Boston Psychopathic Hospital , which had opened as a department of Boston State Hospital , from 1912 until his death . 
 He served in a strategic advisory role with the U.S. Army Chemical Warfare Service during World War I , attaining the rank of major . Southard was a past president of the American Medico @-@ Psychological Association , and was president of the Boston Society of Psychiatry and Neurology at his death . Other professional memberships included the American Genetic Association , the National Epilepsy Association , the American Association of <unk> , the Massachusetts Medical Society and the Society of Experimental Biology . He served in an editorial capacity for several publications , including the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease . 
 Southard was a member of the Board of Scientific Directors for the Eugenics Record Office ( ERO ) . Led by biologist Charles Davenport , the ERO lobbied for state sterilization laws and restrictions on U.S. immigration . Public approval of the office waned during the 1930s ( when eugenics became associated with Nazism ) , and the ERO closed in 1939 . Southard coined the word " <unk> " for the study of racial decline . 
 = = = Professional contributions = = = 
 Southard studied the organic basis of mental illness at a time when two camps of professionals ( known informally as " brain spot men " and " mind twist men " ) debated the biological and behavioral manifestations of psychiatric disorders . His neuropathological perspective was eclipsed after his death by the " mind twist " hypothesis of mental illness promoted by the dynamic psychiatry ( or <unk> ) of Adolf Meyer and the psychoanalytic perspectives of Sigmund Freud , Carl Jung and Alfred Adler . Although physiological theories of " <unk> " were explored in U.S. psychiatry before 1940 , Southard had long ago rejected them . 
 During the World War I era , Southard conducted early studies of shell shock . He believed that shell shock resulted from the mind 's inability to align the sensory experiences of war with other life events . Southard said that this process , which could also have physical causes , resulted in disorientation and transformed the events of war into a mental condition . In Shell Shock and Other Neuropsychiatric Problems , he called the term " shell shock " advantageous because it " compared with the more acutely terrible and life @-@ in @-@ the @-@ balance thing we know as traumatic or surgical shock . " The condition initially captured public interest , at least in part because it was thought to result from a traumatic force to the head . When shell shock became known as not resulting from physical injuries , patients were stigmatized and arguments over its cause interfered with effective treatment . 
 At the end of the war , Southard returned to Boston State Hospital and it was reorganized . He was relieved of his directorship at Boston Psychopathic and named director of the Massachusetts Psychiatric Institute , a unit of Boston Psychopathic . Free of his previous hospital administration duties , Southard was able to concentrate on research . Southard delineated several priorities for his scientific work and writing . He hoped to publish four books ; the first would cover observations from his research laboratory made between 1906 and 1919 . The second book , on clinical work he had done at Boston Psychopathic since 1912 , he hoped would increase enthusiasm for psychiatric hospitals . The third would report on the expansion of psychiatric social work , and the final work ( a requirement for his academic post ) would be an overview of neuropathology . 
 Although Southard expressed a great deal of interest in research , he was most inclined to work on the classification , nomenclature and definition of psychiatric and philosophical concepts . He said he realized that such work was ridiculed by many , but a " psychiatric dictionary ( to include definitions of every near @-@ lying psychological and philosophical term also ) would do more to push mental hygiene on than any other single thing I can think of . " Southard proposed an eleven @-@ category classification system for psychiatric diagnoses , which was not adopted . 
 He was particularly interested in dementia praecox ( which he favored renaming schizophrenia ) , and found diffuse anatomic differences in the brains of schizophrenic patients . These changes were ignored or dismissed as artifactual by other investigators for several decades . Serious attention to Southard 's findings did not reemerge in the medical literature until the 1990s , but changes in diagnostic criteria complicate the application of Southard 's findings to modern schizophrenic patients . Shortly before his death Southard wrote and presented Non @-@ dementia non @-@ praecox : note on the advantages to mental hygiene of extirpating a term , but did not live to see it published . 
 Southard and Mary Jarrett founded the field of psychiatric social work , applying psychiatry to industrial employees . The Kingdom of Evils , a book on psychiatric social work by Southard and Jarrett , was published after his death . In his introduction to the book , physician Richard Cabot wrote that it highlighted the collaboration between doctor and social worker ; the physician excels at diagnosis , and the social worker is better able to provide resources for treatment .

 At Danvers State Hospital Southard met <unk> Canavan , with whom he worked and published in neuropathology for the next few years . When Canavan received a tempting job offer from the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane , in his capacity with the Massachusetts Commission on Mental Diseases , Southard petitioned the board to create a position for her as his assistant , and her salary was enough for her to refuse the Pennsylvania offer . 
 Southard also mentored Karl Menninger during Menninger 's internship at Boston Psychopathic Hospital . Menninger planned to join his father , general practitioner Charles Frederick Menninger , in practice . Southard steered Karl Menninger 's interests toward mental health ; the Menninger Foundation was later established with a focus on psychiatry , and Karl Menninger became president of the American Psychoanalytic Association . The Menninger family opened the Southard School , a teaching facility for mentally @-@ ill children , several years after Southard 's death . 
 Southard had considerable influence on the early career of comparative psychologist Robert Yerkes . Working in the philosophy department at Harvard , Yerkes was passed over for promotions because he had only studied animals . Southard asked him to design mental testing techniques applicable to patients at the psychopathic hospital , and Yerkes received a half @-@ time appointment at Boston Psychopathic with Southard from 1913 to 1917 . Shortly afterwards , Yerkes was elected president of the American Psychological Association and developed the U.S. Army 's mental testing program during World War I. In his autobiography , Yerkes called Southard " my master of psychopathology . "

 In 1906 Southard married Mabel Fletcher Austin , a Wellesley College mental @-@ hygiene lecturer and Johns Hopkins University graduate . She was the daughter of former Minnesota governor Horace Austin . Southard wrote to Frederic Parker Gay about the limitations his professional responsibilities placed on his marriage : " Mabel is her own cook , maid and bath steward , as for her being a wife , I have little or no time to be a husband . " 
 Southard had three children : a daughter , Anne , and two sons . His younger son Ordway was an early writer of English @-@ language haiku and published under several names , including O. <unk> Southard , <unk> Southard and <unk> Norway . He was a Communist Party candidate in the 1942 Alabama gubernatorial election . Southard 's older son , Austin , developed schizophrenia and committed suicide several years after his father 's death . 
 The elder Southard 's life was often busy and sleepless . According to L. Vernon Briggs , a colleague at Boston Psychopathic Hospital , Southard considered himself hypomanic . " He himself said that most people fell within one of the classifications of mental disease , and he felt himself to be of the manic @-@ depressive type . We seldom saw the depressive side of him though it was undoubtedly there ; ordinarily he appeared carried away with enthusiasm about his latest interest – and everything worthwhile interested him " , Briggs wrote . 
 Southard experienced chronic headaches and minor seizures ( sometimes accompanied by partial vision loss for several hours ) , which he attributed to mental strain . A 1901 episode kept him in Boston City Hospital for a week , and Southard said he was diagnosed with " acute brain tire " . A similar event several years later was diagnosed as vascular neurosis . According to Gay , a physical examination several months before Southard 's death may have indicated an endocrine gland problem , but no specific condition was diagnosed . 
 A member of two local chess clubs , Southard was described in his New York Times obituary as " one of the foremost amateur chess players in America " . He often arrived at his laboratory after spending the night playing chess . After his death , in " metaphors more appropriate for a comet than a man " , friends described the intellect which allowed Southard to play up to six blind chess matches simultaneously . At Danvers State Hospital , he introduced a move he called the Danvers Opening . 
 Southard frequently traveled from Boston to New York City to participate in Walter Arensberg 's salons , bringing scholarship to discussions of contemporary social @-@ science topics . Arensberg was also friends with artists such as Marcel Duchamp . Southard analyzed the dreams of Arensberg 's guests , and discussed the meaning of Duchamp 's work with the artist . Perhaps influenced by Arensberg and his friends , Southard began to write experimental poetry . He was a member of the <unk> Club , a social and intellectual group of young Harvard academics .

 Southard traveled to New York City on February 1 , 1920 to lecture to medical societies . He spoke to the Society of Neurology of New York on February 3 , and delivered a mental @-@ hygiene lecture at the New York Academy of Medicine the following day before developing pneumonia on February 5 . Despite care by three Presbyterian Hospital physicians at the Prince George Hotel , Southard died on February 8 , at the age of 43 . 
 Canavan became the acting laboratory director at Boston Psychopathic after his death . In 1925 she published Elmer Ernest Southard and His Parents : A Brain Study , following the postmortem dissections of Southard 's brain and those of his parents . Canavan undertook the study to examine hereditary links in brain structure . Southard had a prominent frontal lobe , which she associated with his planning ability . Canavan noted small olfactory tracts , and said that Southard had difficulty detecting certain smells . The arteries at the base of his brain were small , but the significance of this finding was unclear . The distinctive features of Southard 's brain did not appear in those of his mother or father . 
 Canavan later wrote that Southard had experienced " singular difficulties producing considerable mental discomfort " during the last year of his life . According to her , he sensed his impending death and felt pressure to complete his unfinished research tasks . Canavan quoted him as saying , " I shall not live long , I must hurry ; I must get lots of others busy . "

 The origins of Lahore Fort are obscure and traditionally based on various myths It is unknown who first built a fort there . According to some Hindu myths , its foundation was attributed to Loh , the mythical son of Lord Rama . However , the first historical reference to a fort ever actually existing on that location goes back to the 11th century , during the time of Mahmud of Ghazni . It was a weak mud fort that was subsequently destroyed . The earliest reference for this is that in the 1240s , it was destroyed by Mongols . After nearly 50 years , a new fort was constructed in its place by <unk> of Mamluk dynasty of Delhi Sultanate . It was destroyed again around 1399 by the invading forces of Timur only to be rebuilt by Sultan Mubarak Shah Syed after 20 years . In the 1430s , the fort was occupied by Shaikh Ali of Kabul . 
 The present design and structure of the fort , however , traces its origins to the Mughals . In 1575 , Mughal emperor Akbar occupied the fort , which was used to guard the northwest frontier of the kingdom . He rebuilt the fort with solid bricks and lime and over time lofty palaces were built to which additional beauty was lent by luxuriant gardens . The other structures built by him included the <unk> Khana @-@ e @-@ Khas @-@ o @-@ Am , <unk> @-@ e @-@ Darshan , and <unk> Gate . On the other hand , his structures were replaced by subsequent rulers . However the structures built by him were replaced by subsequent rulers . Shah Jahan built the Shah Burj , the Sheesh Mahal and the Naulakha Pavilion . His son Aurangzeb built the entrance , Alamgiri Gate , which is flanked by semi @-@ circular towers with domes pavilions .

 Excavations in 1959 in front of Diwan @-@ i @-@ Am led to the discovery of a gold coin dated 1025 AD belonging to Mahmud of <unk> . The coin was unearthed at the depth of 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) from the lawn . The cultural layers were continuous to the depth of 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) indicating that the fort was inhabited by people even before his conquest . 
 While relaying the deteriorated floor of Akbari Gate in April 2007 , three floors in the fort were unearthed belonging to the British , Sikh and Mughal period . The floor of the British , Sikh and Mughal periods were constructed with bricks , burnt bricks and pebbles respectively . The latter either built during Jahangir ’ s or Shah Jahan ’ s era was the hallmark of Mughals . 
 In April 2006 , it was reported that officials had urged UNESCO to remove the name of the fort from the list of endangered World Heritage Sites because of extensive restoration work funded by Norway , Hong Kong , the United Kingdom and France . 
 Though in 1990 , UNESCO had ordered the Punjab Archaeological Department to bar the use of the Fort for state or private functions on account of historical significance , a wedding reception was held in violation on December 23 , 2010 . The Antiquities Act of 1975 , which prohibits the use of historical places to protect them from damage , was violated in the following month by hosting a dinner in the Diwan @-@ i @-@ Khas .
