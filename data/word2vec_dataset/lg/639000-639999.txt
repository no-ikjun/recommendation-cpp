 Ascension is a feature that allows characters to start the game over and play through it again from the beginning , similar to a New Game Plus feature . This feature becomes available after the game 's final quest is completed . Players who ascend have their character 's experience levels reset to one , but they retain their currency and items . Ascending players can also choose to make their ascension more difficult by taking on various restrictions , such as not being able to eat or drink , in exchange for special rewards . In addition , the game features a leaderboard system which allows players to see one another 's ascension speeds and compete for the fastest ascensions . 
 = = Plot and setting = = 
 The player takes on the role of an adventurer who is tasked with solving problems and killing monsters in a fantasy @-@ based kingdom . The game is humorous in nature , and most quests , battles and individual item descriptions include jokes , witticisms , or references to popular culture . Many quests parody the tropes found in other role @-@ playing games . 
 The premise is that the Naughty Sorceress has captured and " <unk> " ( imprisoned in a prism ) the Kingdom 's ruler , King Ralph XI . The ultimate objective of the game is to defeat the Naughty Sorceress and free King Ralph . In King Ralph 's absence , most of the power in the Kingdom of Loathing is held by the Council of Loathing , which gives quests to characters as they increase in level , with the final quest given when the character has reached level 13 and finished the other quests . Players can also unlock quests from other sources , some of which are available only after ascending . 
 = = Development = = 
 Zack Johnson , the game 's creator , developed several games before Kingdom of Loathing but did not feel that they were good enough to release online . Deciding that he was taking the games he created too seriously , Johnson then set himself the challenge of creating one within a week and publishing the result online . The result was more of a joke than a game , and the initial content including classes and even the name of the game were stream of consciousness . The game was released in early 2003 , and Johnson soon invited his childhood friend Josh Nite to contribute content as a writer and designer . Within a year , 300 @,@ 000 player accounts had been created , far exceeding Johnson and Nite 's expectations ; Johnson has referred to the game 's success as " a never ending series of <unk> " . In 2008 , the game had between 100 @,@ 000 and 150 @,@ 000 regular players . 
 In the game 's early days , Johnson would work on the game during breaks while at work , but eighteen months or so after launch , the game was bringing in enough money for Johnson to quit his day job as a programmer and develop the game full @-@ time . He then began to pay Nite for his work and after approximately two years hired two more developers . There are currently eight full @-@ time employees working on Kingdom of Loathing , as well as three other employees who are working on a separate game . The game 's creative process is fluid and loosely structured . According to Johnson , " At this point , I provide the overall direction . I do about a quarter of the writing , a quarter of the coding , and almost all of the artwork . " The bulk of the writing is done by Nite , who also contributes design ideas , while two other developers , known in the game as Riff and <unk> , work on writing , design , and coding . 
 According to Nite , the game 's writing style owes itself to a humorous email exchange between himself and Johnson that began when the two separated after high school . These emails " helped us develop the shared comedic voice that KoL 's written in " . The game 's developers cite text @-@ based games such as Zork and Legend of the Red Dragon as creative influences , and Nite has compared the game to the Choose Your Own Adventure series of children 's books . 
 The game has been in open beta since its initial release , and is continuously being worked on . New content is released weekly or monthly , and there is also unique holiday @-@ themed content every Christmas , known as <unk> . Occasionally , the developers stage world events such as the Gray Plague , which was similar to the Corrupted Blood incident in World of Warcraft . 
 In November 2014 , Nite was laid off from Asymmetric Publications . 
 = = Business model = = 
 Kingdom of Loathing is advertising @-@ free and does not charge subscription fees . 
 Maintenance and development of the game is supported primarily through donations and players who donate US $ 10 to the game receive a powerful item known as a Mr. Accessory . Mr. Accessories can be equipped to give stat boosts or spent in the " Mr. Store " to buy powerful items ( including special monthly items ) . Mr. Accessories and Mr. Store items may be traded freely between players . According to an interview with Zack Johnson from 2010 , Johnson originally established the Mr. Accessory revenue model as " kind of an afterthought " , but it became lucrative enough to allow him to work on the game full @-@ time and eventually to hire several permanent employees . 
 = = Community = = 
 Kingdom of Loathing has been praised for its welcoming and active player community . One of the most unusual aspects of the community is the large number of female players : according to Johnson , approximately 40 % of players are female . Fans often gather at both official conventions , run by Asymmetric , and unofficial player @-@ organized meet @-@ ups , including the annual <unk> event . Players support the game by writing scripts to perform various in @-@ game functions , using Greasemonkey , Java , Perl , and Lua , and have also developed a player @-@ run wiki which offers puzzle solutions and walkthroughs . Longtime player and <unk> rapper MC <unk> is active in the community and included a Kingdom of Loathing @-@ themed song on his 2010 album Zero Day . 
 Brett Bixler , founder of the Educational Gaming Commons at Pennsylvania State University , has hypothesized that the Kingdom of Loathing community is successful because it accounts for Richard Bartle 's model of player personality types in massively multiplayer online roleplaying games , creating a balanced gameplay system that appeals to a wide variety of players . Researcher Martin Oliver addressed similar issues in a 2009 study of the Kingdom of Loathing player community , " Playing Roles in the MMORPG Kingdom of Loathing " . 
 A Web @-@ based <unk> radio station , Radio KoL , is the " official unofficial " radio station of KoL . It is a 24 / 7 DJ @-@ hosted station , with volunteer DJs drawn from the KoL user base . Twice weekly , development team members host shows on Radio KoL in which they discuss the state of the game and answer questions from players .

 Critical response for Kingdom of Loathing has been generally positive , with consistent praise for the game 's humor and surrealism . The gameplay and content have been praised as " well designed " and having a " huge amount of content " . Matt Gallant of Gizmodo said that the game is " actually very full @-@ featured " with " a lot of content " , and according to Worlds in Motion , " Kingdom of Loathing isn 't just a great game , but a really unique and interesting MMO . " Jay Is Games called it " a ' must play ' game for RPG fans who want something different " . Gamezebo criticized the interface as well , calling it " clunky " , and several reviewers expressed concern that the game might be confusing to new players . 
 = Aberdaron = 
 Aberdaron is a community and former fishing village at the western tip of the Llŷn Peninsula ( Welsh : Penrhyn Llŷn ) in the Welsh county of Gwynedd . It lies 14 @.@ 8 miles ( 23 @.@ 8 km ) west of Pwllheli and 33 @.@ 5 miles ( 53 @.@ 9 km ) south west of Caernarfon , and has a population of 965 . It is sometimes referred to as the " Land 's End of Wales " , or in Welsh <unk> 'r <unk> ( roughly " far end of the world " ) . The community includes Bardsey Island ( Welsh : Ynys Enlli ) , the coastal area around Porthor , and the villages of Anelog , Llanfaelrhys , Penycaerau , Rhoshirwaun , Rhydlios , Uwchmynydd and Y Rhiw . 
 Y Rhiw and Llanfaelrhys have long been linked by sharing rectors and by their close proximity , but were originally ecclesiastical parishes in themselves . The parish of Bodferin / <unk> was assimilated in the 19th century . The village was the last rest stop for pilgrims heading to Bardsey Island ( Ynys Enlli ) , the legendary " island of 20 @,@ 000 saints " . In the 18th and 19th centuries it developed as a shipbuilding centre and port . The mining and quarrying industries became major employers , and limestone , lead , jasper and manganese ( " Mango " ) were exported . There are the ruins of an old pier running out to sea at Porth <unk> , which is the local name for the west end of Aberdaron Beach . After the Second World War the mining industry collapsed , and Aberdaron gradually developed into a holiday resort . The beach was awarded a Seaside Award in 2008 . 
 The coastal waters are part of Pen Llŷn a 'r <unk> Special Area of Conservation ( Welsh : Ardal <unk> Arbennig Pen Llŷn a 'r <unk> ) , one of the largest marine designated sites in the United Kingdom . The coast itself forms part of the Aberdaron Coast and Bardsey Island Special Protection Area ( Welsh : Ardal <unk> Arbennig <unk> Aberdaron ac Ynys Enlli ) , and was designated a Heritage Coast in 1974 . In 1956 the area was included in Llŷn Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty ( Welsh : Ardal o <unk> Naturiol <unk> Llŷn ) . Conservation Areas have been created in Aberdaron , Bardsey Island and Y Rhiw ; and the area has been designated a Landscape of Historic Interest . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Aberdaron means " Mouth of the Daron River " , a reference to the Afon Daron ( English : River Daron ) which flows into Bae Aberdaron ( English : Aberdaron Bay ) in the village . 
 = = History = = 
 The area around Aberdaron has been inhabited by people for millennia . Evidence from the Iron Age hillfort at Castell Odo , on Mynydd <unk> , shows that some phases of its construction began unusually early , in the late Bronze Age , between <unk> and 2650 years before present ( BP ) . The construction was wholly defensive , but in later phases defence appears to have been less important , and in the last phase the fort 's ramparts were deliberately flattened , suggesting there was no longer a need for defence . It appears that Aberdaron became a peaceful farming community . Ptolemy calls the Llŷn Peninsula " <unk> <unk> " ( English : Peninsula of the <unk> ) ; the <unk> were a tribe of Irish Celts , and it is thought there may have been strong ties with Leinster . 
 The church at Aberdaron had the ancient privilege of sanctuary . In 1094 Gruffudd ap Cynan , the exiled King of Gwynedd , sought refuge in the church while attempting to recapture his throne ; he escaped in the monastic community 's boat to Ireland . He regained his territories in 1101 , and in 1115 Gruffydd ap Rhys , the exiled prince of Deheubarth , took refuge at Aberdaron to escape capture by Gwynedd 's ruler . Henry I of England had invaded Gwynedd the previous year , and faced by an overwhelming force , Gruffudd ap Cynan had been forced to pay homage and a substantial fine to Henry . The King of Gwynedd , seeking to give up the exiled prince to Henry , ordered that the fugitive prince be dragged from the church by force , but his soldiers were beaten back by the local clergy ; Gruffydd ap Rhys escaped under cover of night and fled south to join up with his supporters in Ystrad Tywi . 
 Following the conquest of Gwynedd , in 1284 , Edward I set about touring his new territories . He visited the castles at Conwy and Caernarfon . Court was held at Nefyn , at which his new subjects were expected to demonstrate their loyalty ; and he visited Aberdaron on his way to Bardsey Abbey . 
 The medieval townships of Aberdaron were <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) , <unk> ( Anelog , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) , <unk> ( Penrhyn , Cadlan , Ysgo , <unk> ) , and Bodrydd ( Penycaerau , Bodrydd , <unk> ) . These <unk> predate the idea of the modern ecclesiastical parish . Some were or became hamlets in themselves , whereas others have subsequently been divided - for example the modern Bodrydd Farm is only a part of the medieval township . 
 After the English Civil War , when the Parliamentarians under Oliver Cromwell introduced a strongly Protestant regime , Catholicism remained the dominant religion in the area . Catholics , who had largely supported the Royalist side , were often considered to be traitors and efforts were made to eradicate the religion . The persecution even extended to Aberdaron , and in 1657 , Gwen Griffiths of Y Rhiw was summoned to the Quarter Sessions as a " papist " . 
 Agricultural improvement and the Industrial Revolution came to Aberdaron in the 19th century . The Inclosure ( Consolidation ) Act 1801 was intended to make it easier for landlords to enclose and improve common land , introduce increased efficiency , bring more land under the plough , and reduce the high prices of agricultural production . Rhoshirwaun Common , following strong opposition , was enclosed in 1814 ; while the process was not completed in Aberdaron , Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw until 1861 . On the industrial front , mining developed as a major source of employment , especially at Y Rhiw , where manganese was discovered in 1827 . 
 During the Second World War , Y Rhiw played a vital role in preparations for the Normandy landings . A team of electronic engineers set up an experimental ultra high frequency radio station , from where they were able to make a direct link to stations in Fishguard ( Welsh : <unk> ) and Llandudno . The system employed a frequency that the German forces were unable to either monitor or jam , and was used in the 1944 landings . 
 = = Governance = = 
 Aberdaron , Bardsey Island , Bodferin , Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw were civil parishes in the commote of <unk> within Cantref Llŷn , in Caernarfonshire . Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 , parishes were grouped into " unions " : Pwllheli Poor Law Union was created in 1837 . Under the Public Health Act 1848 the area of the poor law union became Pwllheli Rural Sanitary District , which from 1889 formed a second tier of local government under Caernarfonshire County Council . Y Rhiw was absorbed into the smaller Llanfaelrhys in 1886 ; and under the Local Government Act 1894 the four remaining parishes became part of Llŷn Rural District ( Welsh : <unk> <unk> Llŷn ) . Bodferin , Llanfaelrhys , and parts of Bryncroes and Llangwnnadl , were amalgamated into Aberdaron in 1934 . Llŷn Rural District was abolished in 1974 , and Bardsey Island was absorbed into Aberdaron to form a community within Dwyfor District in the new county of Gwynedd ; Dwyfor was abolished as a local authority area when Gwynedd became a unitary authority in 1996 . 
 The community now forms an electoral division of Gwynedd Council , electing one councillor ; William Gareth Roberts of Plaid Cymru was re @-@ elected in 2008 . Aberdaron Community Council has 12 elected members , who represent three wards : Aberdaron De ( English : Aberdaron South ) , Aberdaron <unk> ( English : Aberdaron East ) and Aberdaron Gogledd ( English : Aberdaron North ) . Ten Independent councillors and one from Plaid Cymru were elected unopposed in the 2008 election . 
 From 1950 , Aberdaron was part of Caernarfon parliamentary constituency . In 2010 , the community was transferred to Dwyfor Meirionnydd constituency , represented by Elfyn Llwyd of Plaid Cymru . In the National Assembly for Wales it has , since 2007 , formed part of Dwyfor Meirionnydd assembly constituency , represented by Dafydd Elis @-@ Thomas , also of Plaid Cymru , who until 2011 was the Presiding Officer of the assembly . The constituency forms part of the electoral region of Mid and West Wales . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Aberdaron stands on the shore of Bae Aberdaron ( English : Aberdaron Bay ) in a small valley at the confluence of the Afon Daron and Afon <unk> @-@ y @-@ Felin , between the headlands of Uwchmynydd to the west , and Trwyn y Penrhyn to the east . At the mouth of the bay stand two islands , Ynys Gwylan @-@ Fawr and Ynys Gwylan @-@ Fach , which together are known as Ynysoedd Gwylanod ( English : Seagull Islands ) . Gwylan @-@ Fawr reaches 108 feet ( 33 metres ) in height . The Llŷn Peninsula is a marine eroded platform , an extension of the Snowdonia ( Welsh : Eryri ) massif , with a complex geology including Precambrian rocks . The coastline is rocky , with crags , screes and low cliffs ; heather covered hills are separated by valleys occupied by pastures . 
 To the east , Mynydd Rhiw , Mynydd y Graig and Mynydd <unk> form a 3 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) long series of hog @-@ back ridges of igneous rock that reaches the sea at Trwyn <unk> . Above 800 feet ( 240 m ) the ridges are topped by hard gabbro . At its northern end Mynydd Rhiw rises to 997 feet ( 304 m ) and is a Marilyn . The outcrop of Clip y <unk> ( English : Curlew 's Crag ) looming above the village of Y Rhiw . Mynydd <unk> is one of the best exposures of intrusive , layered , igneous rock in the British Isles . 
 East of Y Rhiw is an extensive low @-@ lying plateau between 65 feet ( 20 m ) and 100 feet ( 30 m ) above sea level . The coastal rock is softer here , and the sea has been free to erode the rock and boulder clay to form sand , resulting in the spacious beach of Porth Neigwl ( or Hell 's Mouth ) . 
 West of Aberdaron , four peaks rise above the rocky shoreline at Uwchmynydd . Mynydd Anelog stands 627 feet ( 191 m ) high , and another Marilyn , Mynydd Mawr at 525 feet ( 160 m ) , Mynydd y <unk> rises to 295 feet ( 90 m ) and Mynydd <unk> is 330 feet ( 100 m ) above sea level . 
 Bardsey Island ( Welsh : Ynys Enlli ) lies 1 @.@ 9 miles ( 3 km ) off Pen y Cil . The island is 0 @.@ 6 miles ( 1 @.@ 0 km ) wide and 1 @.@ 0 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) long . The north east rises steeply from the sea to a height of 548 feet ( 167 m ) . The western plain , in contrast , comprises low , and relatively flat , cultivated farmland ; in the south the island narrows to an isthmus , connecting to a peninsula . 
 The coast around Aberdaron has been the scene of many shipwrecks . In 1822 , the Bardsey Island lighthouse tender was wrecked , with the loss of six lives ; and in 1752 , the schooner John the Baptist , carrying a cargo of oats from Wexford to Liverpool , was wrecked on the beach at Aberdaron . The sailing ship Newry , with 400 passengers bound from <unk> to Québec , was wrecked at Porth Orion in 1880 . The crew abandoned the passengers , leaving just the captain , ship 's mate and one sailor , assisted by three local men , to lead 375 men , women and children to safety . A great storm swept the country on 26 October 1859 and many ships were lost : nine were wrecked at Porthor , seven of them with complete loss of life . On the south coast , vessels were often driven ashore at Porth Neigwl by a combination of south westerly gales and treacherous offshore currents . The Transit was lost in 1839 , the <unk> the following year , and the Henry Catherine in 1866 . The bay earned its English title , " Hell 's Mouth " , from its reputation for wrecks during the days of the sailing ship . 
 Aberdaron is noted for low levels of air pollution . The Gwynedd State of the Environment Report in 2004 found levels of sulfur dioxide , nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide very low , and particulates to be low . It is one of the few sites in the United Kingdom for golden hair lichen , a striking bright orange lichen that is very sensitive to air pollution . The climate is relatively mild and , because of the Gulf Stream , frosts are rare in winter . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Sheep have been raised in the Llŷn Peninsula for over a thousand years , and Aberdaron has produced and exported wool for many years . The main product locally was felt , produced by soaking the cloth in water and beating it with large wooden paddles until the wool formed a thick mat which could be flattened , dried and cut into lengths . There were two fulling mills on the Afon Daron , in addition to three corn mills , and lichen was gathered around Y Rhiw , from which a grey dye was extracted . Arable crops consisted mainly of wheat , barley , oats and potatoes . The field boundaries date back several centuries and are marked by walls , <unk> and hedgerows ; important habitats for a variety of wildlife . 
 Wrecking and smuggling supplemented local incomes . In 1743 John Roberts and Huw <unk> from Y Rhiw were found guilty of the murder of two shipwrecked sailors on the beach at Porth Neigwl on 6 January 1742 , and hanged ; Jonathan Morgan had been killed by a knife thrust into the nape of his neck , and Edward <unk> , described as a boy , had been choked to death . A ship claimed to be from France unloaded illicit tea and brandy at Aberdaron in 1767 , and attempted to sell its cargo to the locals ; a Revenue cutter discovered salt being smuggled at Porth Cadlan in 1809 ; and a schooner en route from Guernsey to Scotland was reported to have offloaded lace , tea , brandy and gin at Y Rhiw in 1824 . 
 During the 19th century good quality limestone and a small amount of lead ore were quarried in the village . Jasper was mined at Carreg ; granite was quarried at Porth y Pistyll ; and there was a brickworks at Porth Neigwl . The main source of income , however , was herring fishing . A regular shipping service was operated to Liverpool , exporting pigs , poultry and eggs ; the vessels returned laden with coal for the neighbourhood . Limestone was also imported and offloaded into the water at high tide , then collected from the beach when the tide went out . Lime was needed to reduce the acidity of the local soil , and lime kilns were built on the beaches at Porthor , Porth Orion , Porth Meudwy , Aberdaron and Y Rhiw to convert the limestone to quicklime . There was shipbuilding at Porth Neigwl , where the last ship , a sloop named the Ebenezer , was built in 1841 ; and at Porthor , which came to an end with the building of a schooner , the Sarah , in 1842 . Aberdaron 's last ship , the sloop Victory , had been built in 1792 , and the last ship to come out of Porth Ysgo had been another sloop , the Grace , in 1778 . 
 The outbreak of the First World War resulted in a great demand for manganese as a strengthening agent for steel . Ore had been discovered at Y Rhiw in 1827 , and the industry became a substantial employer in the village ; over 113 @,@ 000 long tons ( 115 @,@ 000 t ) of ore were extracted between 1840 and 1945 , and in 1906 the industry employed 200 people . 
 Tourism began to develop after 1918 . The first tourist guide to the village was published in 1910 and extolled the virtues of " the salubrious sea and mountain breezes " ; in addition to the two hotels in the village , local farmhouses took in visitors , which provided an extra source of income . 
 At the 2001 census , 59 @.@ 4 per cent of the population were in employment , and 23 @.@ 5 per cent were self @-@ employed ; the unemployment rate was 2 @.@ 3 per cent ; and 16 @.@ 0 per cent were retired .

The community is included in Pwllheli and Llŷn Regeneration Area and was identified in the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation 2005 as the electoral division in Gwynedd with least access to services ; and was ranked 13th in Wales . An agricultural census in 2000 recorded 33 @,@ 562 sheep , 4 @,@ 380 calves , 881 beef cattle , 607 dairy cattle , and 18 pigs ; there were 310 acres ( 130 ha ) of growing crops .

 Two stone bridges , Pont Fawr ( English : Large Bridge ) and Pont Fach ( English : Small Bridge ) , built in 1823 , cross the Afon Daron and Afon <unk> y Felin in the centre of Aberdaron . Beyond the bridges the road opens up to create a small market square . The Old Post Office was designed by <unk> architect , Clough Williams @-@ Ellis . 
 Y <unk> Fawr ( English : The Big Kitchen ) was built in the 13th century as a communal kitchen where pilgrims could claim a meal on their way to Bardsey Island . Aberdaron was the last place on the route for rest and refreshment and pilgrims often had to wait weeks in the village for a chance to cross the treacherous waters of Bardsey Sound ( Welsh : <unk> Enlli ) . 
 Next to the car park is a field , Cae y <unk> ( English : Gallows Field ) , near which is a large red rock . In the Middle Ages , the abbot from the monastery on Bardsey Island visited the rock to dispense justice to local criminals ; if they were found guilty , the wrongdoer would be hanged and thrown into Pwll <unk> ( English : The Bottomless Pool ) . The pool is a kettle lake , formed at the end of the Ice Age , when blocks of ice were trapped underground and melted to form round , deep pools . 
 Above the village , on the Afon Daron , stands <unk> , an early @-@ 16th century stone @-@ built house , which had a fulling mill adjacent ; two large brick @-@ built wings were added later , giving an imposing three @-@ storey facade containing 17th century windows .

 = = = Bardsey Island = = = 
 Bardsey Island ( Welsh : Ynys Enlli ) , 1 @.@ 9 miles ( 3 @.@ 1 km ) off the mainland , was inhabited in Neolithic times , and traces of hut circles remain . During the 5th century the island became a refuge for persecuted Christians , and a small Celtic monastery existed . Saint Cadfan arrived from Brittany in 516 and , under his guidance St Mary 's Abbey was built . For centuries the island was important as " the holy place of burial for all the bravest and best in the land " . Bards called it " the land of indulgences , absolution and pardon , the road to Heaven , and the gate to Paradise " ; and in medieval times three pilgrimages to Bardsey Island were considered to be of equivalent benefit to the soul as one to Rome . In 1188 the abbey was still a Celtic institution , but by 1212 it belonged to the Augustinians . Many people still walk to Aberdaron and Uwchmynydd each year in the footsteps of the saints , although today only ruins of the old abbey 's 13th @-@ century bell tower remain . A Celtic cross amidst the ruins commemorates the 20 @,@ 000 saints reputed to be buried on the island . 
 The island was declared a national nature reserve in 1986 , and is part of Aberdaron Coast and Bardsey Island Special Protection Area ( Welsh : Ardal <unk> Arbennig <unk> Aberdaron ac Ynys Enlli ) . It is now a favourite bird @-@ watching location , on the migration routes of thousands of birds . Bardsey Bird and Field Observatory ( Welsh : <unk> Maes ac Adar Ynys Enlli ) , founded in 1953 , nets and rings 8 @,@ 000 birds each year to understand their migration patterns . 
 Bardsey Island Trust ( Welsh : <unk> Ynys Enlli ) bought the island in 1979 , after an appeal supported by the Church in Wales ( Welsh : Yr Eglwys yng <unk> ) and many Welsh academics and public figures . The trust is financed through membership subscriptions , grants and donations , and is dedicated to protecting the wildlife , buildings and archaeological sites of the island ; promoting its artistic and cultural life ; and encouraging people to visit as a place of natural beauty and pilgrimage . When , in 2000 , the trust advertised for a tenant for the 440 acres ( 180 ha ) sheep farm on the island , they had 1 @,@ 100 applications . The tenancy is now held by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ; and the land is managed to maintain the natural habitat . Oats , turnips and <unk> are grown ; goats , ducks , geese and chickens kept ; and there is a mixed flock of sheep and Welsh Black cattle . 
 Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society has been working on cetaceans in the region . Several species , most notably bottlenose dolphins can be observed from the shores .

 Porth Ysgo , owned by the National Trust , is reached by a steep slope from Llanfaelrhys , 3 @.@ 3 miles ( 5 @.@ 3 km ) east of Aberdaron , past a disused manganese mine in Nant y <unk> . The mine employed 200 people in 1906 ; the ore was used as a strengthening agent for steel . The mine closed in 1927 , and produced 45 @,@ 644 long tons ( 46 @,@ 376 t ) in its lifetime . Where the path from Ysgo reaches the beach , a waterfall , Pistyll y <unk> , tumbles over the cliff . At the eastern end of the bay is Porth <unk> , where the stream from Nant y <unk> flows into the sea . The south @-@ facing beach is composed of fine , firm sand . 
 To the west , King Arthur 's last battle against his arch enemy , Mordred , was supposedly fought in the fields around Porth Cadlan . Offshore lies a rock , Maen <unk> , named after Arthur 's sister . 
 <unk> Maelrhys are two large stones on the border between Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw . It is claimed that , years ago , thieves broke into St Maelrhys Church , intent on stealing money . Caught in the act , they fled for their lives but were caught as they approached Y Rhiw , and killed on the spot ; the stones mark their burial place . Another version claims that as they crossed the parish boundary they were turned to stone for their sacrilege . 
 = = = Porthor = = = 
 Porthor ( English : Whistling Sands ) is a cove 3 @.@ 2 miles ( 5 @.@ 1 km ) north of Aberdaron that has smooth white sand ; when dry , the sand whistles , or squeaks , underfoot . The crescent @-@ shaped beach is backed by steep cliffs of relatively hard rock , from which the cove has been sculpted by the rough seas . The bay is the centre of a National Trust estate which consists of 420 acres ( 170 ha ) of shoreline , headland and farmland , and includes Mynydd Carreg and Mynydd Anelog . 
 On the hill summits that dot the headlands are heather and gorse , shaped by the prevailing wind ; thrift and wild thyme thrive on the acidic soil . The cliffs are a stronghold of the chough , and a nesting place for razorbills and guillemots . On the lower rocks , in reach of the waves , are plentiful lichens , seaweeds , sponges , limpets and barnacles . 
 To the south are Dinas Bach and Dinas Mawr , twin peninsulas formed from weathered pillow lavas 600 million years old , thought to have been early fortified sites from the Iron Age . <unk> , cormorants and shags can be seen on the cliffs , while farm birds such as the yellowhammer frequent the gorse . On Mynydd Anelog , experimental plots have been marked out to monitor different methods of managing heather to discover the best way the habitat can be conserved for the future . 
 North of Porthor is Porth Iago , a south @-@ facing narrow inlet and rocky cove , which has a small beach and steep cliffs . 
 = = = Rhoshirwaun = = = 
 Rhoshirwaun lies 2 @.@ 1 miles ( 3 @.@ 4 km ) to the north east of Aberdaron , and was formerly a marshy area . It provided fuel from peat cuttings , pasture for animals and accommodated squatters , mainly fishermen , who had encroached on the common with the tacit acceptance of the community . An <unk> act was drawn up in 1802 , designed to remove all squatters who had been there less than 20 years . Resistance to the evictions was fierce and was only suppressed by a contingent of dragoons . The act was finally applied in 1814 ; new roads were built across the moor ; boundaries were established ; allotments allocated ; and wetland reclaimed . 
 Castell Odo , on Mynydd <unk> , is one of Europe 's earliest Iron Age Settlements , standing 480 feet ( 150 m ) above sea level . The hillfort , 165 feet ( 50 m ) in diameter , has visible traces of eight circular huts ; pottery found on the site dates from 425 BC . Legend has it that a giant , Odo Gawr , is buried under a cairn of stones on the summit ; nearby is a huge rock known as Carreg Samson , supposedly thrown from Uwchmynydd by Samson . The holes in the rock are said to be the imprint of his fingers ; a pot of gold reputedly lies underneath . 
 To the east of the village , Felin Uchaf is an educational centre exploring ways of living and working in partnership with the environment . Developed on a redundant farm , it provides residential courses in rural skills and sustainable agriculture . A traditional Iron Age roundhouse has been built on the site . 
 = = = Uwchmynydd = = = 
 Uwchmynydd , 1 @.@ 8 miles ( 2 @.@ 9 km ) to the south west of Aberdaron , has a long history of human settlement . Mesolithic flints have been found in the area , and a Neolithic stone axe was discovered on Mynydd Mawr . Hut circles are visible on the summits , and part of a Roman anchor was recovered off Trwyn <unk> . 
 At Mynydd Mawr the picnic site has views which , on a fine day , take in Cardigan Bay ( Welsh : Bae Ceredigion ) , Bardsey Island and the Wicklow Mountains ( Irish : <unk> Chill <unk> ) ; at night , South Stack Lighthouse ( Welsh : <unk> Ynys <unk> ) is visible in the distance . A road to the summit , owned by the National Trust , was built during the Second World War to provide access to the heights , where men were posted to give early warning to Liverpool of Luftwaffe air raids . The former Coastguard lookout point , manned for almost 80 years before becoming redundant in 1990 , provides views over Bardsey Sound to the island . The hut contains an exhibition to the natural history of the area , and a mural created by local children . 
 The headland at <unk> y Pwll is the only known location on the British mainland of the spotted rock rose , which produces bright yellow petals that last only one day . The coast here has open grass heath land and mountain , giving way to rugged sea cliffs and coves . There is a profusion of wildlife , and it is an ideal vantage point to watch the spring and autumn bird migrations . Choughs , peregrine falcons , kestrels , puffins , <unk> , guillemots and Manx shearwaters can be seen , and dolphins , porpoises and seals can be spotted in the water . 
 Above the sea cliffs are the remains of Capel Mair ( English : St Mary 's Chapel ) , where it was customary for pilgrims to invoke the protection of the Virgin Mary before making the dangerous crossing to Bardsey Island . At the foot of Mynydd Mawr is Ffynnon Fair ( English : St Mary 's Well ) , the last stop for pilgrims crossing to the island ; the well is a freshwater spring which is covered twice daily by the sea , emerging from the ebbing tide with crystal clear water . 
 Cwrt ( English : Court ) , now a large farm , was the administrative centre of Bardsey Abbey 's mainland estates , and was known as the " Court of Bardsey " . The steepest cliffs in the Llŷn Peninsula are at Y <unk> , the scene of a local ghost story . In 1794 a newly married couple moved into a cottage nearby . Within a few years they were disturbed by a phantom , but when they read a verse from the Bible , the phantom would retreat towards Y <unk> and hover over the cliff edge before disappearing ; the couple finally moved to Bodferin . In 1801 a ship pilot was put ashore on the rocks below the cliffs . Although very drunk , he managed to climb the cliff face and , reaching the top , fell asleep in a sheep pen . In the early morning , he awoke and , still drunk , headed for home ; he walked in the wrong direction , however , and disappeared over the cliff edge into the sea . 
 The traditional embarkation point for pilgrims crossing to Bardsey Island was at Porth Meudwy ( English : Hermit 's Cove ) , now a lobster fishing cove . Further south is Porth y Pistyll , which has good views of Ynysoedd Gwylanod , home to puffin and guillemot colonies ; and Pen y Cil , where the Precambrian pillow lavas are exposed , revealing how they have been contorted over time . 
 = = = Y Rhiw = = = 
 The mountain @-@ top hamlet of Y Rhiw is 3 @.@ 9 miles ( 6 @.@ 3 km ) to the east . There are fine views of Llŷn towards Snowdonia ( Welsh : Eryri ) . On the slopes of Mynydd Rhiw is a late Stone Age burial chamber , and Neolithic quarries . Nearby on Mynydd y Graig are three hillforts , several hut circles and terraced fields that are thought to date from the late Iron Age ; in 1955 a Bronze Age cinerary urn was uncovered in the village . 
 Plas yn Rhiw , owned by the National Trust , is an early @-@ 17th century house that was restored by the Keating sisters in 1939 , with advice from Clough Williams @-@ Ellis . It is believed that the house is on or near the site of an earlier defended house , built by Meirion Goch in the 10th century to prevent incursions by Vikings into Porth Neigwl . 
 Bwlch y <unk> Wen at Y Rhiw , built in 1731 , is a <unk> cottage , a type of agricultural worker 's house found in Llŷn .

 = = Education = = 
 In the early 19th century there was a school for poor children , which moved in a four @-@ year cycle between Aberdaron , Llanfaelrhys , Bryncroes and Y Rhiw . The Elementary Education Act 1870 provided for local school boards , but was opposed by the established church . The process of establishing boards was lengthy , and the government had to enforce the regulations in Aberdaron , Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw ; the national school opened at Y Rhiw in 1877 and had 74 pupils on its register ; it closed in 1965 . 
 Primary education is now provided by Ysgol Crud y Werin in Aberdaron , which has 54 pupils , and by Ysgol <unk> in Rhoshirwaun , established in 1880 , which has 21 pupils . At the last inspection of Ysgol Crud y Werin , by <unk> in 2008 , there were no pupils entitled to free school meals , and 84 per cent came from homes where Welsh was the main spoken language ; Welsh is the main medium of teaching . Ysgol <unk> was last inspected in 2009 ; 18 per cent of pupils were entitled to free school meals and 36 per cent came from homes where Welsh was the predominant language . Secondary school pupils mainly attend Ysgol Botwnnog .

 Aberdaron is a predominantly Welsh @-@ speaking community ; 75 @.@ 2 per cent of the population speak the language . A mobile library visits a number of sites in the community each week ; and <unk> Llŷn , a <unk> bro published in Abersoch , serves the area ; the local English newspapers are the Caernarfon and Denbigh Herald , published in Caernarfon ; and the Cambrian News , published in Aberystwyth . Summer harp recitals and concerts are held in St Hywyn 's Church ; Gŵyl Pen Draw 'r <unk> ( English : The Land 's End Festival ) is a yearly event which includes beach side concerts and competitions on the shore , with an evening concert at Morfa Mawr Farm ; Gŵyl Pentre Coll ( English : The Lost Village Festival ) , a festival of contemporary acoustic music , has been held since 2008 at Felin Uchaf in Rhoshirwaun ; and a local eisteddfod , Eisteddfod <unk> Uwchmynydd , is held at Ysgol Crud y Werin . 
 The poet R. S. Thomas was vicar of St Hywyn 's Church from 1967 to 1978 ; when he retired he lived for some years in Y Rhiw . An ardent Welsh nationalist who learnt to speak Welsh , his poetry was based on his religious faith . In 1995 he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature , and he was widely regarded as the best religious poet of his time . The subject of one of Thomas 's poems , Richard Robert Jones , better known as " <unk> Aberdaron " , was born in the village in 1780 . Despite very little formal education , he is said to have been fluent in 14 languages , and spent years travelling the country accompanied by his books and his cat . 
 William Rowlands won a prize at the National Eisteddfod in 1922 , for an adventure story written for boys . The book , Y <unk> Lo ( English : The Coal Ship ) was published in 1924 , and told the story of two boys who stow away on one of the ships that brought coal to Porth Neigwl . The South African poet Roy Campbell published The Flaming Terrapin , written in a " <unk> cottage " above Porth Ysgo , in 1922 ; he was considered to be one of the best poets of the period between the two world wars . Considered one of the most significant Welsh poets of the 15th century , Dafydd <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , compared the striking yellow colour of the rocks at Uwchmynydd , covered by golden hair lichen , to the colour of his loved one 's hair . <unk> Daron , a 16th @-@ century poet best known for his elegy to friend and fellow poet Tudur Aled , is thought to have been born in Aberdaron . 
 Yorkshire @-@ born poet Christine Evans lives half the year on Bardsey Island and spends the winters at Uwchmynydd . She moved to Pwllheli as a teacher and married into a Bardsey Island farming family . On maternity leave in 1976 , she started writing poems ; her first book was published seven years later . Cometary Phrases was Welsh Book of the Year 1989 and she was the winner of the inaugural Roland Mathias Prize in 2005 . 
 Edgar Ewart Pritchard , an amateur film @-@ maker from Brownhills , produced " The Island in the Current " , a colour film of life on Bardsey Island , in 1953 ; a copy of the film is held by the National Screen and Sound Archive of Wales . A candle lantern , discovered in 1946 in a cowshed at Y Rhiw , is now displayed in St Fagans National History Museum ; and Iron Age pottery found at Castell Odo is on display at Gwynedd Museum and Art Gallery in Bangor . 
 Dilys Cadwaladr , the former school teacher on Bardsey Island , in 1953 became the first woman to win the Crown at the National Eisteddfod for her long poem Y <unk> ; and artist Brenda Chamberlain twice won the Gold Medal for Art at the Eisteddfod ; some of the murals she painted can still be seen on the walls of Carreg , her island home from 1947 to 1962 . Wildlife artist Kim Atkinson , whose work has been widely exhibited in Wales and England , spent her childhood on the island and returned to live there in the 1980s . 
 Since 1999 , Bardsey Island Trust has appointed an Artist in Residence to spend several weeks on the island producing work which is later exhibited on the mainland . A Welsh literary residence was created in 2002 ; singer @-@ songwriter <unk> Dafydd spent six weeks working on a collection of poetry and prose . Her play Hugo was inspired by her stay , and she has produced two novels , <unk> ( English : Attraction ) , which won the prose medal at the 2006 Eisteddfod ; and Twenty Thousand Saints , winner of the Oxfam Hay Prize , which tells how the women of the island , starved of men , turn to each other . 
 It was tradition for Bardsey Island to elect the " King of Bardsey " ( Welsh : <unk> Enlli ) , and from 1820 onwards he would be crowned by Baron Newborough or his representative ; the crown is now kept at Merseyside Maritime Museum in Liverpool , although calls have been made for it to return to Gwynedd . At the outbreak of the First World War , the last king , Love Pritchard , offered himself and the men of the island for military service , but he was refused as he was considered too old at the age of 71 ; Pritchard took umbrage , and declared the island to be a neutral power . In 1925 Pritchard left the island for the mainland , to seek a less laborious way of life , but died the following year . 
 Owen Griffith , a qualified pharmacist from Penycaerau , who was known as the " Doctor of the Wild Wart " , used a traditional herbalist remedy to cure basal cell carcinoma , also known as rodent ulcer ; the remedy had supposedly been passed on to the family 300 years earlier by an Irish tinker . In 1932 a woman died while receiving treatment and , even though the inquest into her death found that no blame was apportioned to the treatment , the Chief Medical Officer for Caernarfonshire vociferously condemned the treatment in the press . Former patients came out in support of the pharmacist , and petitions were sent to the Department of Health demanding that a medical licence be granted to Griffith and his cousin . 
 There are several folk tales of the Tylwyth Teg , the fairy people who inhabited the area and an invisible land in Cardigan Bay . One tells of a farmer from Aberdaron who was in the habit of stepping outside his house before retiring to bed . One night he was spoken to by a stranger , who asked why the farmer was annoyed by him . The farmer , confused , asked what the stranger meant and was told to stand with one foot on the stranger 's . This he did , and could see another house , just below his own , and that all the farm 's slops went down the chimney of the invisible house . The stranger asked if the farmer would move his door to the other side of the house , which the farmer subsequently did , walling up the original door ; from that day , the farmer 's livestock flourished , and he became one of the most prosperous men in the area . 
 = = Religion = = 
 A church was founded in Aberdaron in the 6th century by Saint Hywyn , a follower of Saint Cadfan ; it was a significant institution , a monastery and centre of religious learning , rather than simply a place of worship for the locals . The present double @-@ naved St Hywyn 's Church ( Welsh : Eglwys Hywyn Sant ) , built in 1137 and known as the " Cathedral of Llŷn " , stands above the shore and was on the pilgrim route to Bardsey Island . It contains a 12th century Romanesque arched door , and a square bell turret . The church was extended in 1417 and abandoned in 1841 , when the locals decided to build a new church , Eglwys Newydd , in the village ; the new building , however , proved unpopular and the congregation returned in 1906 . Inside is a display about the life and works of the poet , Ronald Stuart Thomas ; and in the churchyard stand Y <unk> <unk> a <unk> ( English : The <unk> and <unk> Stones ) , the tombstones of two 5th century Christian priests , found in the 18th century on farmland near Mynydd Anelog . In 2008 the church became the centre of controversy when the local vicar blessed a gay civil partnership , after approval by the local church council ; the vicar was reprimanded by Barry Morgan , the Archbishop of Wales ( Welsh : <unk> Cymru ) . Referring to the archbishop 's protests , the vicar stated " There was a bit of a to @-@ do about it " . 
 The church at Llanfaelrhys is the only one in the United Kingdom dedicated to Saint Maelrhys , the cousin of both Saint Cadfan and Saint Hywyn , who accompanied them to Wales from Brittany . Legend attributes the building of the church to a trader who landed a cargo of flour near Aberdaron during a famine ; he used the profit from his sale to construct a small church for the locals . Much of the building is medieval ; the font dates back to the 15th century ; and there are plain hard wooden benches on the north side ; on the south side are 19th century wooden box pews . The graveyard contains the graves of the three Keating sisters , who restored Plas yn Rhiw . 
 St <unk> 's Church at Y Rhiw was built in 1860 on the footings of an earlier church . It consists of a small nave and short chancel ; aisles to the north and south ; and has boulder @-@ built walls and a slate roof . The churchyard contains the graves of some of the bodies that were washed up at Porth Neigwl during the First World War . Above Porth Iago is the site of the ancient St Medin 's Church ; now just a mound in the middle of a field , it was the parish church of Bodferin . 
 One of the first Non @-@ conformists in the area was Morgan Griffith of Y Rhiw . In 1745 he was brought before the court in Pwllheli , where he was jailed for failing to renounce his beliefs . After his release he returned to Y Rhiw and began to preach again . Re @-@ arrested , he was returned to a prison ship in England , where he subsequently died . Two of the earliest non @-@ conformist chapels in the Llŷn Peninsula were established at Penycaerau , in 1768 , and Uwchmynydd , in 1770 ; the Congregationalists opened Cephas Independent Chapel in 1829 ; and Capel Nebo was built at Y Rhiw in 1813 ; the Wesleyan Methodists followed in 1832 at Capel Pisgah . By 1850 there were eight non @-@ conformist chapels in Aberdaron ; five in Y Rhiw ; and one on Bardsey Island ; but more were to be built . The Calvinistic Methodists opened Capel Tan y Foel ; and Capel Bethesda , the Baptist chapel at Rhoshirwaun , was built in 1904 . Aberdaron is also home to a Seventh @-@ day Adventist youth camp named Glan @-@ yr @-@ afon , located 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from the village centre . 
 At the 2001 census 73 @.@ 9 per cent of the population claimed to be Christian and 15 @.@ 0 per cent stated that they had no religion . 
 = = Sport = = 
 Aberdaron hosts numerous sailing regattas featuring clinker built boats unique to the area ; there is a popular regatta every August where the races are open to everyone . Sea angling trips are operated from Porth Meudwy , fishing for pollock , coley and mackerel ; wrasse , bass , mullet and gurnard are also possible . Bass and coley can be caught from the rocks at Porth Iago ; and wrasse , pollock and mackerel are plentiful . Access is difficult at Uwchmynydd , but pollock , mackerel , wrasse and conger are caught ; huss are plentiful ; and ling are found occasionally . 
 The village is a popular walking centre and lies on the Llŷn Coastal Path ( Welsh : Llwybr <unk> Llŷn ) , which runs 84 miles ( 135 km ) from Caernarfon to Porthmadog . Kayaking is possible from both Aberdaron and Porth Neigwl , and the south @-@ facing " sunshine coast " is a major attraction ; there are camping facilities for canoeists on the shores of Porth Neigwl . Tidal streams are generally weak , although landing conditions are tricky when there is wind or swell from the south . 
 The area has excellent diving . Underwater visibility at Bardsey Island extends to 66 feet ( 20 m ) and there is a rich variety of sea life ; it is considered some of the best diving in Gwynedd . The Ynysoedd Gwylanod are particularly popular , and the wreck of the <unk> , in Bae Aberdaron , is excellent for novices , having a maximum depth of 26 feet ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) ; an extremely large conger eel lives in the lower section of the boiler openings . There is spectacular diving at Pen y Cil , where there is a slate wreck and an unusual cave dive ; nearby Carreg Ddu is an isolated rocky island in Bardsey Sound , although care must be taken as there are strong currents . 
 Bathing is popular along the coast . Aberdaron Beach , facing south west , is sandy , gently shelving and safe ; it received a Seaside Award in 2008 . Porthor also attracts bathers , and has sands which squeak when walked on ; the beach at Porth Neigwl was awarded a Green Coast Award in 2009 ; 
 Aberdaron Beach is a surfing and <unk> location for surfers of all levels , although it can be dangerous at high tide when the waves break directly onto boulders underneath the cliff . The better surfers head for the northern end . 
 = = Climate = = 
 Being situated at the west coast of the UK , Aberdaron has a distinct maritime climate , with mild winters and cool summers . That is not to say that extremes cannot occur . In fact , some extraordinary temperature extremes have been recorded : 
 On 2 August 1995 , Aberdaron equaled the highest ever August minimum temperature in Wales , at 22 ° C , after recording the record high temperature for the village of 29 @.@ 2 ° C on the same day 
 On 20 December 1998 , the maximum temperature at Aberdaron was below average at 5 ° C. The very next day , the highest January temperature ever observed in the UK was recorded there , at 20 @.@ 1 ° C. Yet the average temperature for that day was just 6 @.@ 4 ° C 
 On 9 July 2009 , Aberdaron equaled the lowest ever temperature for the UK for July , at <unk> ° C 
 All of the record lows except for November and December were recorded in 2009 , and they were all below freezing . 
 Despite the fact that Aberdaron can have quite extreme weather , the number of frosts per year is very low , at around 7 @.@ 2 days per year . This is comparable with coastal areas of Devon and Cornwall . The region , England NW and Wales N , averages 52 @.@ 3 days , with December alone exceeding the average yearly amount of frost for Aberdaron . The village is generally quite windy throughout the year , particularly in Autumn and Winter . Sunshine amounts are lower than the UK average . Rainfall is well below the Wales average .

 The Boat Race is an annual competition between the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge . First held in 1829 , the competition is a 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) race along The Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 2008 race by six lengths , while Cambridge led overall with 79 victories to Oxford 's 74 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . The race was sponsored by Xchanging for the fifth consecutive year . 
 The first Women 's Boat Race took place in 1927 , but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s . Up until 2014 , the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races , but as of the 2015 race , it is held on the River Thames , on the same day as the men 's main and reserve races . The reserve race , contested between Oxford 's Isis boat and Cambridge 's Goldie boat has been held since 1965 . It usually takes place on the Tideway , prior to the main Boat Race .

 Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station . Cambridge 's cox Dowbiggin raised her hand to indicate that she was not ready to start just as Umpire Boris Rankov started the race . This allowed Oxford the initiative and they took an early lead . Cambridge slowly edged their way back into contention , and held a half @-@ a @-@ length lead at the two @-@ mile mark . At St Paul 's School , Cambridge were two @-@ thirds of a length ahead before a series of oar clashes and umpire warnings forced the boats apart .

Xenosaga Freaks reused some of the music of Episode I by Mitsuda while also including new work by Satoru Kousaki and Hiroshi Ohkubo , while Xenosaga I & II and Xenosaga : The Animation used new pieces composed by Kousuke Yamashita . 
 Episode I sparked the release of two versions of its soundtrack album as well as a single , Episode II received two soundtrack albums , and Episode III received one . Xenosaga Freaks and Xenosaga : The Animation each also sparked the release of a soundtrack album . In addition to the albums , Episode I saw the release of a book of orchestral sheet music as well as a book of piano sheet music ; Episode II had only a book of piano sheet music . Music from the series has been played multiple times in concerts , especially that of the first two games .

 The first episode in the series was Xenosaga Episode I : Der Wille zur Macht , released in 2002 . Designed as a spiritual successor to Xenogears , the game was worked on by much of the same staff , including the composer Yasunori Mitsuda . For the game , Mitsuda composed a score that is mostly orchestral in nature , using the London Philharmonic Orchestra for several tracks . Other pieces include vocal tracks by the Metro Voices choir , piano solos by Yasuharu Nakanishi , and performances by the Gen <unk> Strings . The game 's theme songs , " Pain " and " Kokoro " , were sung by Celtic singer Joanne Hogg of the band Iona , with whom Mitsuda had previously worked for the soundtrack to Xenogears . The vocal songs throughout the soundtrack range from choral to opera to a capella , while the tone of the soundtrack overall has been described as being " serious , sometimes dark , heavy and even haunting at times " . At one point in the development process , Mitsuda planned to use a separate person to orchestrate his compositions after an early piece proved unworkable and had to be scrapped , causing him to lose confidence in his own ability . After working for several months , however , he regained his confidence and decided to work as his own orchestrator , a decision which he feels improved him as a composer . 
 The first release of the soundtrack as an album was the Xenosaga Original Soundtrack , released by DigiCube on March 6 , 2002 . The two @-@ disc album includes every piece from the game 's soundtrack , with a total length of 1 : 58 : 42 across its 45 tracks . Two years later , on May 19 , 2004 , Mitsuda released another version of the soundtrack through his Sleigh Bells label titled Xenosaga Episode I. This version features two new tracks — " World to be Born " and " Pain ~ piano version ~ " — as well as re @-@ recordings of some of the tracks . The playlist order was also changed between the two versions , with Episode I grouping the tracks by style , rather than in rough chronological order within the game like the original album . Mitsuda explained in the liner notes for the album that he felt that separating the two styles presented a different impression of the music that allowed the listener to greater appreciate the atmosphere of the pieces . In addition to the two albums , a single , " Kokoro " , was released for the game 's theme songs . Published by DigiCube , the disc includes " Pain " and " Kokoro " from the original soundtrack as well as a piano rendition of Kokoro and instrumental versions of both songs . The album has a total length of 23 : 55 , and was released on February 6 , 2002 . 
 The Original Soundtrack album reached # 38 on the Japan Oricon charts and was well received by reviewers . IGN termed it one of Mitsuda 's best soundtracks to date , calling it " near genius with nearly every passing track " . They especially praised the wide range of emotions present in the soundtrack . GameSpy agreed in their review of the game , saying that " the music is rich , full , varied , and underscores the cinemas and battle sequences excellently " . RPGFan , in their review of the Xenosaga Original Soundtrack album , said that the album works well as a stand @-@ alone album apart from the game , and that it has few , if any , bland or mediocre tracks . They repeated their praise for the soundtrack in their review of Xenosaga Episode I , though they felt that the two new tracks were not very impressive additions . " Kokoro " reached # 61 and received praise as well , for its emotional intensity and lyrics .

 The second episode of the series , Xenosaga Episode II : Jenseits von Gut und Böse , was released in 2004 . Mitsuda did not return to compose the soundtrack ; instead , Yuki Kajiura and Shinji Hosoe were brought into the project . Kajiura had previously composed for a few video games as well as numerous anime soundtracks . Her style for the game 's soundtrack , for which she composed only the numerous cinematic scenes , has been described as " a fusion of electronica and techno with either an orchestra or ethnic instruments , " as well as including vocals in places where many composers would have left an instrumental section . Hosoe composed the music for the playable portions of the game , and feels that that the sound quality and balance of the soundtrack is poor . This feeling is based primarily on the fact that he " slashed the orchestral sound while creating the music " so that the music played using the PlayStation 2 's sound chip would match the music played off of the CD . He had predicted that there would be a fan outcry against " changing composers on a series like Xenosaga " , and suspects that his music from the game will never be released on an album ; to date the released albums for the game include only Kajiura 's work . Kajiura and Hosoe did not collaborate on any of the tracks in Episode II ; according to Kajiura they never even met during the production . 
 Episode II 's soundtrack was first released as an album on July 7 , 2004 as Xenosaga II : Jenseits Von Gut und Böse Movie Scene Soundtrack by Victor Entertainment . Including only Kajiura 's work , the album spans two discs and 40 tracks and has a duration of 1 : 52 : 26 . Another soundtrack album for the game , Xenosaga Episode II : Jenseits von Gut und Böse Soundtrack , was released by Namco and Brady Games as a promotional extra for the Brady Games strategy guide for the game . The 11 @-@ track CD again excluded the work of Hosoe , instead sampling Kajiura 's pieces . Released on February 17 , 2005 , the album has a duration of 30 : 25 . The Movie Scene album reached position # 46 on the Japanese Oricon charts . In the liner notes for Movie Scene Soundtrack , Kajiura claims that she felt that her work for the game was different from her previous pieces , as it was more of a soundtrack , with the individual tunes fitting more closely together . She also said that she found it easier to compose tracks that fit with the worldview that Mitsuda had created for the first game , rather than invent her own . She also notes that she intended tracks 1 — 4 to be a single , continuous piece , although they were broken up in the game ; she intended tracks 20 and 21 the same way . 
 IGN , in their review of the game , said that the soundtrack for Episode II was not up to par with that of Episode I. They felt that Hosoe 's tracks were in general too " upbeat and poppy " for the game 's premise , and that while <unk> 's works were better , they were still weaker than Mitsuda 's . One review from RPGamer agreed with this sentiment , calling the music on the whole " pretty dull and unmemorable " , though another RPGamer review praised the increase in the number of tracks present in the game , giving the listener greater variety . An RPGFan review of the Movie Scene album termed it a " fantastic album " , though one with several weak tracks and an aesthetic that would not appeal to many listeners , especially those who disliked vocal tracks . Their review of the promotional album gave that album high marks as well , saying that it was an excellent sampler album and , at the time , easy to find due to its inclusion in the game 's strategy guide .

 The third and final episode in the series , Xenosaga Episode III : Also sprach Zarathustra , was released in 2006 . Composed entirely by Kajiura , her style shifted from that of Episode II to be darker , with a larger focus on rhythm and less use of background vocals . The soundtrack has been described as " melancholy " and " piano @-@ driven " . Despite moving from composing only the cinematic tracks in Episode II to composing the whole score for Episode III , Kajiura says that the difficulty of each game 's score was about the same . She primarily drew her inspiration for the music from the game 's artwork and her conception of the world the game was set in . 
 The only soundtrack album released for the game was Xenosaga III : Also Sprach Zarathustra Original Sound Best Tracks , an album of selections from the soundtrack rather than all of the tracks . The two @-@ disc album has 40 tracks , and a total length of 1 : 51 : 46 . It was published by Victor Entertainment on July 12 , 2006 . The album reached position # 50 on the Japanese Oricon charts , and stayed on the charts for four weeks . In the liner notes for the album , sound producer Keiichi <unk> explains that the album would have needed to be six discs long to hold all of the music from the game , so he asked Kajiura to select a sample that would only fill two discs . 
 In RPGamer 's review of the game , they termed the soundtrack a " stunning success " , saying that Kajiura provided an " emotionally charged soundtrack " that fit the tone of each section of the game and was superior to the soundtrack of Episode II . G4TV called the soundtrack " a respectable contender " and better than Episode II 's soundtrack as well , praising the music 's restraint and usage in accenting the game rather than overpowering it . IGN called it " pretty darned good " , though noted that it was not as good as the score to the first game . RPGFan , in their review of the album , said that while the quality of the overall work was better than that of Episode II 's Movie Scene soundtrack album , the album was very inconsistent between great and poor tracks . They concluded that Kajiura had ultimately not succeeded in being Mitsuda 's successor for the series .

 The spin @-@ off media of the Xenosaga series to include music are a collection of minigames titled Xenosaga Freaks that explores the backstory of Episode I , a remake of the first two episodes for the Nintendo DS titled Xenosaga I & II , and an anime series titled Xenosaga : The Animation . There are also other media adaptions without music , such as a manga series . Xenosaga Freaks included new work by Satoru Kousaki and Hiroshi Ohkubo , while Xenosaga I & II and Xenosaga : The Animation used new pieces composed by Kousuke Yamashita . 
 Freaks sparked the release of an album , Xenosaga Freaks Reservation Privilege CD , which includes three vocal tracks sung by the voice actresses for the characters Shion , KOS @-@ MOS , and <unk> from the game , a fourth vocal track featuring all three of the singers , and a radio @-@ style interview with them . The 31 : 08 long album was released by Namco on April 28 , 2004 . The music , composed by Namco composers Satoru Kousaki and Hiroshi Ohkubo , is described as " silly lighthearted techno @-@ pop " , and very different from the music in the main games of the series . Xenosaga : The Animation also received an album release , titled Xenosaga : The Animation Original Soundtrack ; the 35 @-@ track album was released by Columbia Records on March 23 , 2005 .

In the Eminence April 21 , 2007 " A Night in Fantasia 2007 " concert , " Gnosis " , " Zarathustra " , and " World to be Born " from Episode I were played . " Pain " was again performed by a piano quintet from the Eminence Orchestra in their four @-@ show " Destiny - Reunion " concert series in July 2007 . Several other non @-@ Xenosaga pieces by Mitsuda and Kajiura were again also performed .

 = Willis Ward = 
 Willis Franklin Ward ( December 28 , 1912 – December 30 , 1983 ) was a track and field athlete and American football player who was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1981 . 
 Ward was the Michigan High School Athlete of the Year , after setting a national prep record in the high jump . At the University of Michigan , he was a collegiate champion in the high jump , the long jump , the 100 @-@ yard dash , and the 440 @-@ yard dash , and finished second in the voting for the Associated Press Big Ten Athlete of the Year award in 1933 . In track and field he was a three @-@ time All @-@ American and eight @-@ time Big Ten champion . 
 In football , Ward was only the second African @-@ American to win a varsity letter for the Michigan Wolverines football team , lettering in 1932 , 1933 , and 1934 . In 1934 , a controversy developed when Georgia Tech refused to play if Ward took the field , and university officials opted to keep Ward out of the game . Teammate Gerald R. Ford reportedly threatened to quit the team in response to the university ’ s decision . After being excluded from the Georgia Tech game , Ward went on to score all 12 of Michigan 's points that year outside of the Georgia Tech game , without another Wolverine even having an extra point or a field goal . 
 Ward later became a lawyer in Detroit and a member of the Michigan Public Service Commission from 1966 to 1973 , serving as chairman from 1969 to 1973 . He also served as a probate court judge in Wayne County , Michigan . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Ward was born in Alabama in 1913 . His father , Henry R. Ward , was an Alabama native who moved to Detroit and worked there in a Ford Motor Company factory . His mother , Bessie , was a Georgia native . 
 Ward attended Detroit 's Northwestern High School where he excelled in both track and football . As a high school junior , he was named Michigan High School Athlete of the Year , after setting a national prep record in the high jump at 6 – 4 @.@ 5 . He was city champion in the low hurdles ( with a time of 13 @.@ 0 ) and the high hurdles ( with a time of 15 @.@ 8 ) . Ward also won the 220 hurdles at Ann Arbor ( with a time of 25 @.@ 9 ) and Class A ( with a time of 26 @.@ 1 ) .

 = = = Freshman track star = = = 
 Ward attended the University of Michigan from 1931 to 1935 , where he became one of the most successful track athletes in the school ’ s history . As a freshman in 1932 , Ward 's specialty was the high jump . Ward won the NCAA high jump championship in June 1932 with a jump of 6 – 7 1 / 3 . He jumped as high as 6 @-@ 7 @-@ 1 / 2 in his freshman year . Ward 's best jump in 1932 was two inches above the mark that won the gold medal at the 1932 Summer Olympics ( Canada 's Duncan McNaughton won the gold with a jump of 6 feet , 5 ½ inches ) , but Ward did not qualify for the team . 
 Ward ’ s accomplishments were not limited to the high jump . An Associated Press article in 1932 noted : “ His specialty is the high jump for which he has a mark of 6 feet 7 ½ inches . He can run the high hurdles and the low hurdles . He has broad jumped 22 feet without training in that event . He put the 16 @-@ pound shot over 43 feet without prior experience , and it believed he might be developed into a world champion weight man . He unquestionably could be trained to do the springs . He is only 19 . Ward has an ideal build for a track man , six feet , one inch tall , 185 pounds of well @-@ distributed weight , good legs , natural co @-@ ordination . He is quiet and unassuming , and popular with coaches and fellow members of the squad . ” 
 When Ward decided to try out for the football team as a sophomore , Michigan track fans worried that Ward would be injured . The Associated Press reported : “ University of Michigan track fans do a lot of worrying these days because a Negro boy from Detroit insists on playing football . Willis Ward , they believe , will be the greatest track man ever to compete for the Maize and Blue — if he doesn ’ t get hurt . … Ward is a good football player and loves the game . . . . Well wishers even have told him about the advantages of competing only in track and staying away from the gridiron , but he is determined to play on the eleven , and he is good enough to make the grade . ” Michigan ’ s track coach , Chuck Hoyt , noted that “ Ward is his own boss and football is his recreation . ” 
 = = = First African @-@ American football player in 40 years = = = 
 In addition to the concerns of track fans , Ward 's decision to try out for the football team raised issues of race . Though George Jewett had broken the race barrier as Michigan 's first African @-@ American football player in 1890 , Michigan had not played another African @-@ American in the 40 years after Jewett . During Fielding Yost 's tenure as coach several African @-@ American students joined the football team , but records indicate that none of them ever saw game action and only one earned even a " reserve letter " . Some reports attribute the de facto segregation of the football team to racism on the part of Yost , who was the son of a Confederate soldier . 
 While in high school , Ward had decided to attend Dartmouth College . With Kipke 's assurance that he would be given full opportunity to play football , Ward enrolled at Michigan . Kipke had played with African @-@ American athletes in high school and was eager to have Ward on his team . According to John Behee , the author of a book on the history of African @-@ American athletes at Michigan , Kipke “ threatened to fight , physically fight , those alumni and fellow coaches who opposed his playing Ward . ” Behee wrote that " on several occasions Kipke took off his coat and was prepared to fight with those who bitterly opposed having a Negro play for Michigan . " 
 Ward got the opportunity to prove himself in spring football practice in May 1932 . According to one account , Kipke ordered his veterans to pound Ward " without mercy " during practice . " If , at the end of the week " , said Kipke , " he doesn 't turn in his uniform , then I know I 've got a great player . " The United Press reported on the results of spring practice : “ Three young freshmen at the University of Michigan — Jerry Ford , of Grand Rapids ; Russell Oliver , of Pontiac , and Willis Ward , Detroit Negro — displayed such brilliance during spring football practice that they are expected to become important cogs next fall in the Wolverine varsity eleven . ” Another report in July 1932 described Ward , the “ giant negro , ” as being “ the outstanding athlete becoming eligible for play . ” 
 Ward made the team in 1932 and started four games at end . Ivy Williamson , captain of the 1932 football team , greeted Ward at the field house and told him , " If you have any problems with anybody , let me know because we 're prepared to take care of them . " Reporting on his decision to play football and risk injury , the Associated Press noted : “ Ward would rather win an ‘ M ’ on the gridiron than be an Olympic champion . ” 
 The 1932 Michigan Wolverines football team went 8 – 0 , outscored its opponents 123 – 13 , and won the national championship . 
 = = = 1933 track season = = = 
 During the 1933 track season , Ward was so dominant that he was dubbed Michigan 's “ one @-@ man track team ” and became a national sensation . He led Michigan to Big Ten championships in both indoor and outdoor track . Going into the Big Ten track meet in May 1933 , Ward was expected to dominate . Coach Hoyt descried Ward as “ a good ‘ un , ” and praised him for his unassuming character and tolerance of the spotlight of publicity . One report noted : “ He is altogether likeable , for he always speaks without raising his voice and never protests a decision . … Ward is a star now , but he is just finishing his first year of competition . Unless injuries hamper him it is likely he will be as great an attraction or possibly even greater than the two Negro track stars who preceded him here , DeHart Hubbard and Eddie Tolan . ” 
 Michigan won the Big Ten meet with 60 ½ points , with Ward individually accounting for 18 points . One writer noted that the Wolverines would have finished in second place “ without the huge , versatile negro . ” At the meet , Ward won the 100 @-@ yard dash and the high jump and placed second in the 120 yard high hurdles and the broad jump . His performance at the Big Ten meet was described as “ the greatest individual performance since Carl Johnson scored 20 points for Michigan in 1918 . ” 
 Even TIME magazine took note of Ward ’ s dominating performance . Time noted : “ The other entrants in the <unk> last week had reason to consider with awe another athlete who — until he helped Michigan win the Western Conference title last week , with 60 ½ points to Indiana 's 47 ½ had not often been heard of outside the Midwest , except as a member of Michigan 's football team . He was Willis Ward , 196 @-@ lb . Negro sophomore . At the Big Ten meet in Evanston last week . Willis Ward won the 100 @-@ <unk> dash in 9 @.@ 6 sec . He won the high jump , placed second in the broad jump . In the 120 @-@ <unk> high hurdles , he forced Ohio State 's Jack Keller to world 's record time of 14 @.@ 1 sec . , finished a close second . The 18 points he won were what enabled Michigan to beat Indiana . They made his the most efficient individual performance in a Big Ten meet since Carl Johnson scored 20 points for Michigan in 1918 . Quiet , unassuming , an above @-@ average student of literature , Ward was the first Negro ever elected to Sphinx , Michigan 's junior honor society . ” 
 At the Drake Relay Carnival in April 1933 , he finished second in the 100 @-@ yard dash , narrowly losing to Ralph Metcalfe . The 1934 Michigan yearbook , called the Michiganensian , noted : " Michigan climaxed a successful season by winning the Annual Butler Relays and taking the title from Indiana . Willis Ward won the meet almost single @-@ handed when he scored thirteen of the team ’ s 18 ¾ points . In winning the 60 yard dash , the Flashy negro star equaled the recognized world mark of 6 @.@ 2 seconds . " At the Big Ten indoor track championship , the Michiganensian noted that Ward , “ Michigan ’ s all around athlete , was easily the outstanding star of the meet . ” Ward won the 60 @-@ yard dash , the 70 @-@ yard high hurdles and the high jump . 
 = = = 1933 football season = = = 
 In 1933 , Ward started all eight games for Michigan at right end and was a key player in Michigan ’ s second consecutive undefeated football season and national championship . Time magazine credited the work of Ward and halfback Herman Everhardus : " Michigan came perilously close to slipping from the top of the Big Ten , where it has been for three years . That it did not slip was largely due to a crack halfback named Herman Everhardus and to Willis Ward , a rangy Negro end . It was Ward who , after hard @-@ fighting Illinois had marched to a touchdown in the first period , shot through and blocked the place kick which would have given Illinois a seventh point . " After the season was over , Coach Kipke also credited the play of Everhardus and his ends for the undefeated season : " Our ends , Ward and Petoskey , were near perfection . " Michigan 's left end , Ted Petoskey was named a first @-@ team All @-@ American in 1933 , and Ward earned honorable mention All @-@ American honors at right end .

 In December 1933 , Ward finished second in close balloting for the Associated Press Big Ten Athlete of the Year award . The AP reported that Duane Purvis of Purdue beat Ward " by the slender margin of two votes . " In the AP ’ s polling of conference coaches and sports writers , 55 votes were cast , with Purvis receiving 17 votes to 15 for Ward , described by the AP as " Michigan 's ' one @-@ man track team . ' " The AP pointed to Ward ’ s dual contributions in football and track : “ Ward , in addition to his feats in track , was one of the bright stars of Michigan 's championship football team this fall . Fast and rangy , he was classed as one of the finest wingmen in football . In track , he has run the century in 9 @.@ 6 , high jumped 6 feet 7 ½ inches , leaped 24 feet in the broad jump and won his share of glory in the high hurdles . ”

 The 1934 football season proved to be one of the low points in the school ’ s history , both because of the team 's 1 – 7 record , and the ugly racial incident that kept Ward out of the game against Georgia Tech . Though excluded from the Georgia Tech game , Willis started every other game — five games at right end , and two games at halfback . Incredibly , Michigan scored only 21 points in the entire 1934 season , and Ward scored 12 of those points . In fact , Michigan scored nine points against Georgia Tech and Ward 's 12 points were the only points scored by the Wolverines in the seven games in which Ward played . Michigan was shut out in the first two games , before beating Georgia Tech in the season 's third game . The following week , Michigan lost to Illinois , 7 – 6 , as Ward scored Michigan 's only touchdown from the line of scrimmage of the entire 1934 season . ( The season 's only other touchdown came on a punt return against Georgia Tech . ) Ward 's touchdown came on a trick play , as fullback Johnny <unk> passed the ball to end Mike Savage who lateraled to Ward . According to the Chicago Tribune , the lateral " enabled the fleet Negro to <unk> the Illinois secondary . " After being shut out in three games after the Illinois match , Michigan closed the season with a 13 – 6 loss to Northwestern . Michigan 's only points against Northwestern came on two field goals by Ward . Thus , all 12 of Michigan 's 1934 points outside the Georgia Tech game were scored by Ward , without another Wolverine even having an extra point or a field goal . 
 = = = 1934 Georgia Tech game = = = 
 Despite his many accomplishments , the event for which Ward is most remembered is the game he did not play . In 1934 , Michigan had scheduled Georgia Tech as the third game of the season . After learning that Michigan had an African @-@ American player , Georgia Tech football coach and athletic director W. A. " Bill " Alexander refused to allow his team to take the field if Ward played . As early as the fall of 1933 , Alexander wrote to Yost asking what was going to be done about Ward , asserting that his team would not take the field if Ward played . 
 As the game approached , word spread that Georgia Tech was insisting that Ward not play , and that the administration might capitulate to the demand . Ward ’ s right to play became a major controversy on the campus . Mass meetings and demonstrations were held . Some students and faculty demanded that either Ward must play or the game should be canceled . Petitions were circulated , and formal protests were lodged with the university by the Ann Arbor Ministerial Association , the NAACP , the National Student League and many other groups . The student newspaper , the Michigan Daily opined : “ If the athletic department forgot it had Ward on its football team when it scheduled a game with Georgia Tech , it was astonishingly forgetful ; ... if it was conscious of Ward 's being on the team but scheduled the game anyway , it was extraordinarily stupid . " 
 Time magazine ran a story about the uproar on Michigan ’ s campus : “ Fifteen hundred Michigan students and faculty members signed a petition asking that the team 's star end , Negro Willis Ward , be allowed to play against Georgia Tech . ” According to Time , 200 “ campus radicals ” threatened to prevent the game from being played by standing in the middle of the field . Rumors of a sit @-@ down protest on the 50 @-@ yard line during the game spread across campus in the week before the game . One alumnus recalled that , the night before the game , " bonfires lit all over the campus echoed with screams of student anger , and ' Kill Georgia Tech ' was heard throughout Ann Arbor . " In an attempt to thwart any attempt to disrupt the game , Yost hired a Pinkerton agent to infiltrate " The United Front Committee on Ward " , a conglomerate of student organizations that supported Ward 's right to play . 
 Athletic authorities argued that Ward should not play because it would be discourteous to Georgia Tech , and he might be injured . There was fear that if Ward played , he would be injured by malicious blows after the play had ended . Playwright Arthur Miller , then a writer for Michigan ’ s student newspaper , learned first @-@ hand about the strong resistance among the Georgia Tech team to playing on the same field with an African @-@ American athlete . In his biography of Miller , Enoch Brater noted that Miller had friends from Arkansas who knew one of the Georgia Tech players . Brater described Miller ’ s involvement this way : “ Remmel [ Miller ’ s friend from Arkansas ] took Miller with them to meet with members of the team , to protest but also to appeal to the athletes ' sense of fair play . ‘ Miller was right in the middle of this ’ , Remmel recalls . Not only did the visiting team rebuff ‘ the Yankee ’ Miller ‘ in salty language ’ , but they told him they would actually kill Ward if he set one foot on the Michigan gridiron . ‘ The Georgia Tech team was wild . ’ Miller was furious . He ‘ went immediately to the office of the Michigan Daily and wrote an article about it , but it was not published . ’ . . . Remmel said that Miller ‘ could not believe that the Georgia Tech team would have tried to destroy Willis Ward — but , I am sure they would have . ’ ” 
 In the end , Ward was not allowed to play . As his teammates faced Georgia Tech , there are conflicting reports as to Ward ’ s whereabouts . According to Time , Ward “ sat calmly in a radio booth , watched his teammates defeat the Southerners , 9 @-@ to @-@ 2 . ” According to Behee , Ward was not even allowed to watch the game from the press box , or even from the bench of his own stadium . Instead , he spent the afternoon in a fraternity house . A third account states that Kipke “ quietly sent Willis Ward off to scout another Michigan game in Wisconsin . ” The day after the Georgia Tech game was played , an editorial ran in The Michigan Daily stating " that everyone who touched ( the Ward affair ) did so only to lose in respect and esteem . " 
 = = = Gerald Ford ’ s role in the Georgia Tech controversy = = = 
 The school ’ s refusal to play Ward in the Georgia Tech game later became part of the public legacy of President Gerald R. Ford . Ward recalled that he met “ my man Jerry ” during freshman orientation in 1932 , and the two became friends and roommates when the football team traveled for road games . When Ford learned that the school had capitulated to Georgia Tech , some accounts indicate that he " quit the team " or threatened to quit in order " to make a statement and take a stand because Willis Ward was his friend . " Ford wrote about the Georgia Tech incident in his autobiography , recalling that he felt the decision to keep Willis out of the game was " morally wrong . " “ I went to Willis himself . He urged me to play . ‘ Look , ’ he said , ‘ the team ’ s having a bad year . We ’ ve lost two games already and we probably won ’ t win any more . You ’ ve got to play Saturday . You owe it to the team . ’ I decided he was right . That Saturday afternoon , we hit like never before and beat Georgia Tech 9 – 2 . ” Years later , Ford wrote that the Ward incident had influenced his thinking about race . Ford noted : “ His sacrifice led me to question how educational administrators could capitulate to raw prejudice . ” Ford used the story to voice his support for U @-@ M ’ s affirmative action admissions policy saying , “ Do we really want to risk turning back the clock to an era when the Willis Wards were isolated and penalized for the color of their skin , their economic standing or national ancestry ? ” 
 In 1976 , Ward , then a probate court judge in Wayne County , said that Ford never mentioned the incident to him , but that Ford 's brother later told him about it . “ Jerry was very concerned , ” Ward recalled . “ His brother told me , ‘ Jerry was so upset he wrote father asking him if he should quit the team . He was that angry . ’ ” At Ford 's funeral , President George W. Bush also spoke about the Willis Ward incident . Bush said : “ Long before he was known in Washington , Gerald Ford showed his character and his leadership . As a star football player for the University of Michigan , he came face to face with racial prejudice when Georgia Tech came to Ann Arbor for a football game . One of Michigan 's best players was an African American student named Willis Ward . Georgia Tech said they would not take the field if a black man were allowed to play . Gerald Ford was furious at Georgia Tech for making the demand , and for the University of Michigan for caving in . He agreed to play only after Willis Ward personally asked him to . The stand Gerald Ford took that day was never forgotten by his friend . ” 
 = = = Impact on Ward = = = 
 Ward proved to be one of the most successful athletes in the history of the University of Michigan . He earned six varsity letters in football and track . In track , he won Big Ten titles in the 100 @-@ yard dash in 1933 ; in the high jump in 1933 and 1935 ; in the 400 meter dash in 1933 ; and in the long jump in 1934 . On several occasions , Ward even beat Jesse Owens in the 100 @-@ yard dash . Because of his all @-@ around skills , Ward was considered a likely contender for the U.S. decathlon team in the 1936 Olympics . 
 However , the Georgia Tech incident left Ward angry and disillusioned . He recalled that it sapped his competitive spirit . Ward considered quitting football , even writing a letter to Coach Kipke about his intentions of leaving the team . He recalled later that the refusal to let him play against Georgia Tech destroyed his will . " It was the fact that I couldn 't play in the Georgia Tech game . That all of a sudden , the practice that you just did because it was the thing to do that was good — a tremendous amount of burnt up energy — all of a sudden becomes drudgery . " His one sports highlight in 1935 was beating Jesse Owens at Yost Fieldhouse in the 60 @-@ yard dash and 65 high hurdles . Ward 's times were neck @-@ and @-@ neck with Owens ' up until the NCAA track and field championship . He took part in the Olympic trials in 1936 , but having lost his competitive drive , Ward , in his own words , did not train to his peak and failed to make the U.S. team . " They were urging me to go out in ' 36 , " Ward recalled . " But that Georgia Tech game killed me . I frankly felt they would not let black athletes compete . Having gone through the Tech experience , it seemed an easy thing for them to say ' Well , we just won 't run ' em if Hitler insists . ' " Interviewed about the incident in 1976 , Ward said : “ It was like any bad experience — you can ’ t forget it , but you don ’ t talk about it . It hurts . ”

 Willis Ward went on to earn a law degree from Detroit College of Law in 1939 and had a distinguished career as a lawyer and judge . In 1964 , Ward , described as “ a Detroit Negro attorney , ” spoke out against Barry Goldwater and in favor of Michigan Governor George Romney as a possible Presidential candidate . In 1966 , Romney appointed Willis to the Michigan Public Service Commission , the state agency responsible for regulating Michigan 's public utilities ; Willis became chairman of the PSC in 1969 , serving in that capacity until 1973 . Ward later was elected a probate judge in Wayne County , Michigan . 
 Ward was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1981 , as part of the fourth group inducted . 
 = Chocolatier ( video game ) = 
 Chocolatier is a casual strategy video game with action game elements , developed by Big Splash Games and published by PlayFirst . The game was released as a download on May 1 , 2007 and was followed by CD @-@ ROM release on September 27 , 2007 . Players assume the role of a young Chocolatier , who must navigate 14 cities around the globe while buying ingredients , manufacturing chocolates , and selling them to chocolate shops . Two modes of play are available : in story mode the player must rebuild an almost bankrupt chocolate empire and acquire 64 chocolate recipes from around the world ; in free mode players start out with scant resources and must become successful <unk> . 
 Chocolatier was the first game developed by Big Splash Games , a trio of experienced video game designers , who remained employees whilst developing a prototype game in their spare time . This prototype was rejected by publishers , but after coming up with the premise of Chocolatier the team was signed @-@ up by PlayFirst and completed the title . The game received a mostly positive reception : reviewers enjoyed the action mini @-@ game which is played when chocolates are manufactured , and the game 's graphics , sound , and Victorian @-@ era presentation . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The player assumes the role of a young <unk> in 1880 , during the Victorian era . The game has two modes of play : story and free play . Story mode involves a number of quests , including delivering specific chocolates and restoring the fictional Baumeister chocolate empire to its former glory . The player is enlisted by Evangeline Baumeister to rebuild the Baumeister chocolate empire which has been ruined by Evangeline 's younger sister who scattered chocolate recipes around the world . The player must locate the 64 lost recipes , visit 14 different cities around the globe , purchase 6 closed Baumeister factories , establish business relationships with outlets and suppliers , and manufacture chocolates to keep in business . Free play mode allows the player to travel , manufacture , and trade without undertaking quests . This mode starts the player with a small amount of cash and all chocolate recipes unlocked for use . In story mode , players begin with a single factory and a recipe for simple chocolate bars , the player must visit the market to purchase ingredients and begin the manufacturing process . 
 The game is turn @-@ based . Each turn represents one week , and travelling between cities takes a number of turns depending on the proximity of the destination city . Many cities have a chocolate shop , where the player can sell his or her stock , and a market where ingredients can be purchased . Some specialty cacao beans can only be purchased from plantations in certain cities . Factories manufacturing chocolates produce a set amount of product every turn , as long as the required ingredients are in stock . During story mode , quests are given by non @-@ player characters ; these typically involve producing a particular volume and type of chocolate and delivering it to another non @-@ player character , who is either traveling or can be found at a set location . Quest rewards take the form of a high price for the chocolates or a new recipe . Some encounters with characters give the player an opportunity to gamble a large amount of money on a dice roll . Market owners can be bartered with , though this carries the risk of them becoming irritated and raising prices rather than lowering them . 
 When producing a particular chocolate for the first time , a mini @-@ game is played where ingredients are fired from a cannon to fill circular trays which revolve around the cannon . The ingredients and quantities needed vary , depending on the recipe . Each time a circle is filled with the correct ingredients , it is removed and an empty circle put in its place . The trays spin faster as more circles are filled . If too many ingredients are wasted by misfiring the cannon , production is brought to a halt and the mini @-@ game must be attempted again . The mini @-@ game ends when the timer runs out ; the number of completed circles is equal to the number of chocolates produced by that factory every week . The mini @-@ game cannot be played unless the player owns the correct ingredients , and it can be replayed if the player wishes to try to improve the efficiency of the factory . Playing the mini @-@ game advances in @-@ game time by one week . Different chocolate types , such as truffles and squares , require the factory to be upgraded first , costing money . 
 = = Development = = 
 Tucson , Arizona based Big Splash Games was formed in late 2005 by three veterans of the videogame industry : Jon Blossom , Stephen Lewis and Michael Wyman . They came together to produce a prototype video game for the casual market . They worked on this for a few months when they were not working ( they still held jobs within the industry to support themselves ) . This prototype was pitched to a few publishers in order to gain feedback . PlayFirst , though not interested in the prototype , issued the team a request for proposal for an economic simulation game , hoping that Big Splash could produce another proposal . The next morning , Big Splash co @-@ founder Stephen Lewis remembered that he had been told that some people , in particular women , " have an almost religious connection with chocolate " . Taking this idea he quickly wrote a proposal and forwarded it to his two partners . After brainstorming the idea the team decided that it satisfied PlayFirst 's request for proposal , forwarded a copy of the idea and received word from the publisher that they " had hit the nail on the head " . 
 Chocolatier was designed to appeal to women aged between 35 and 55 , a different market compared to the games previously developed by the trio . In order to immerse themselves in the subject matter during development , Big Splash 's staff tasted as many variety of chocolates as they could find and took the <unk> Berger Chocolate Maker factory tour , where they witnessed the full " bean to bar " process . The factory mini @-@ game was developed in order to give players a break from the economic side of the game , which involves buying low and selling high . It took approximately the same time to produce the mini @-@ game as it did to create the rest of the game , which drained the developer 's resources , though Stephen Lewis believed this was " the right decision " . Journalists were sent Chocolatier @-@ branded chocolate bars and " golden tickets " which allowed them to download the game for free , in order to promote the game 's release . The game 's sequel , Chocolatier 2 : Secret Ingredients was first released on November 27 , 2007 . Chocolatier : Decadence by Design is the third installment , released in 2009 . The Great Chocolate Chase : A Chocolatier Twist was later released by PlayFirst .

 Chocolatier was awarded Gamezebo 's <unk> award for best strategy game of 2007 . The game received a positive response from critics , though GameZone 's Anise Hollingshead found the game too easy , noting " there really isn ’ t a whole lot of thinking involved . " other reviewers called it " a delightfully challenging business tycoon game " , " challenging but not frustratingly so " , and said that the game " turned out as beautifully as the chocolates . " The game 's graphics and sound received praise : Marc Saltzman noted " the game 's wonderful art style and delightful music " , but website Killer <unk> ' Jason Van Horn found the graphics " alright , simply doing what it needs to do to get its gameplay across . " 
 Reviewers praised the amount of freedom given to players , Meryl Evans of Blogcritics stated " There was no right or wrong , or a set path you must take " , but added that the game lost pace when she had gathered a large amount of money and had to find a specific character to speak with before completing her current quest . After finding the non @-@ player character , the game " picked up again and kept me hopping for the rest of it . " Didi Cardoso of website <unk> Gamer also enjoyed the freedom , but noted that sometimes she felt lost and was unsure of how to find the location of the next recipe . The chocolate manufacturing mini @-@ game was also praised as " fun " . Peter Cohen of Macworld noted that some fans of business simulators might find the mini @-@ game " off @-@ putting " , but also suggested that it helped break up gameplay . Marc Saltzman expressed the same opinion , while Anise Hollingshead found the mini @-@ game to be too easy to play . 
 = Operation Charnwood = 
 Operation Charnwood was an Anglo @-@ Canadian offensive that took place from 8 to 9 July 1944 , during the Battle for Caen , part of the larger Battle of Normandy , in the Second World War . The operation was intended to at least partially capture the German @-@ occupied French city of Caen ( French pronunciation : ​ [ kɑ ̃ ] ) , which was an important objective for the Allies during the opening stages of Operation Overlord , the codename for the Battle of Normandy . It was also hoped that the attack would forestall the transfer of German armoured units from the Anglo @-@ Canadian sector to the lightly screened American sector , where a major American offensive was being planned . The British and Canadians advanced on a broad front and by the evening of the second day had taken Caen up to the Orne and Odon rivers . 
 Preceded by a controversial bombing raid that destroyed much of Caen 's historic Old City , Operation Charnwood began at dawn on 8 July , with battalions of three infantry divisions attacking German positions north of Caen behind an artillery creeping barrage . Supported by three armoured brigades , the forces of the British I Corps made gradual progress against the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend and 16th Luftwaffe Field Division . By the end of the day the 3rd Canadian and British 3rd and British 59th infantry divisions had cleared the villages in their path and reached Caen 's outskirts . Moving into the city at dawn the following morning , the Allies encountered resistance from remnants of German units who were beginning a withdrawal across the Orne . Carpiquet airfield fell to the Canadians during the early morning and by 18 : 00 , the British and Canadians had linked up and were on the Orne 's north bank . Discovering Caen 's remaining bridges to be defended or impassable and with German reserves positioned to oppose their crossing , I Corps closed down the operation . 
 With the capture of northern Caen and the many casualties inflicted on the German defenders , Operation Charnwood was a mutually costly tactical success for the Allies . Operationally , the Germans retired from north of the Orne River but did not stop sending formations to the American front . The Germans established another defensive line along two ridges to the south of the city . The Allies maintained the initiative and began Operation Goodwood and Operation Atlantic a week later , in which the rest of Caen was secured . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Norman city of Caen was one of the D @-@ Day objectives for the British 3rd Infantry Division which landed on Sword Beach on 6 June 1944 . The capture of Caen , while " ambitious " , was the most important D @-@ Day objective assigned to British I Corps under Lieutenant @-@ General Sir John Crocker , 
 The quick capture of that key city [ Caen ] and the neighbourhood of Carpiquet was the most ambitious , the most difficult and the most important task of Lieutenant @-@ General J. T. Crocker 's I Corps . 
 The initial Overlord plan called for the British Second Army to secure the city and then form a front line from Caumont @-@ l 'Éventé to the south @-@ east of Caen , to acquire space for airfields and to protect the left flank of the United States First Army while it moved on Cherbourg . Possession of Caen and its environs would give Second Army a suitable staging area for a push south to capture Falaise , which could then be used as the pivot for a swing left to advance on Argentan and then towards the Touques River . The terrain between Caen and Vimont was especially attractive to Allied planners , being open , dry and conducive to swift offensive operations . Since the Allies greatly outnumbered the Germans in tanks and mobile units , creating the conditions for a fluid , fast moving battle was to their advantage . 
 The British 3rd Infantry Division came ashore as planned but was hampered by congestion in its beachhead , diversions en route and the late arrival of much of its armoured support . The division was unable to assault Caen in force and its lead elements were brought to a halt short of the outskirts . Later attacks failed as the German defenders were reinforced by the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend . On 7 June the British began Operation Perch , a pincer attack by I Corps and XXX Corps , to encircle Caen from the east and west flanks . The I Corps attack south of the Orne River was halted by the 21st Panzer Division and the XXX Corps attack to the west of Caen was contained near Tilly @-@ sur @-@ Seulles by the Panzer @-@ Lehr Division . To force the Panzer @-@ Lehr Division to withdraw the British 7th Armoured Division attacked the western flank of the division on 13 June , through a gap created by the U.S. 1st Infantry Division , to reach high ground near Villers @-@ Bocage . In the Battle of Villers @-@ Bocage the 7th Armoured Division vanguard was ordered to retire and the Panzer @-@ Lehr Division held its positions until XXX Corps captured Tilly @-@ sur @-@ Seulles on 19 June . 
 The next British offensive , codenamed Operation Epsom , was launched by VIII Corps on 26 June , after Operation Martlet ( also known as Operation Dauntless ) a preliminary attack on 25 June , to secure the right flank of VIII Corps . VIII Corps advanced to the west of Caen on a 4 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) front from Rauray to Carpiquet . Once across the Odon and Orne rivers , VIII Corps was to make for high ground near Bretteville @-@ sur @-@ Laize and encircle Caen . The Germans managed to contain the offensive by committing all their strength , including two the 9th SS @-@ Panzer Division Hohenstaufen and 10th SS @-@ Panzer Division Frundsberg of the II SS Panzer Corps , which had been sent from the Eastern Front soon after the D @-@ Day and had been intended for a counter @-@ offensive against Bayeux . 
 On 27 June , the 8th Infantry Brigade ( 1st Suffolk Regiment , 2nd East Yorkshire Regiment , 1st South Lancashire Regiment ) of the 3rd Infantry Division , supported by the Staffordshire Yeomanry , of 27th Armoured Brigade , and specialist armour from the 79th Armoured Division , launched Operation Mitten . The objective was to seize the German @-@ occupied Château la <unk> and Château le Landel . The initial evening assault , led by the 1st Battalion , South Lancashire Regiment was repulsed but the following morning further attacks gained the objectives and destroyed several German tanks . Operation Mitten cost at least three British tanks and had it succeeded quicker , the 9th Brigade , supported by the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade , would have launched Operation Aberlour , to capture the villages of la <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , St. Contest , Authie and <unk> but this follow @-@ up operation was cancelled by Lieutenant @-@ General J. T. Crocker the I Corps commander . The area of the Châteaux was later called the " bloodiest square mile in Normandy " . and 268 men . 
 Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt , supreme commander of the German forces in the west ( OB West ) , directed on 1 July that Caen should be gradually abandoned and the bulk of the German armoured divisions be shifted to the west end of the beachhead against the U.S. First Army but the city and its surroundings were considered by the German Armed Forces High Command ( OKW ) to be fundamental to the defence of Normandy . OKW wanted an arc of defensible terrain from the English Channel to the western banks of the Orne to be held and Adolf Hitler sacked Rundstedt and replaced him with Generalfeldmarschall Günther von Kluge . Learning of this through Ultra , the Allied ground forces commander , General Bernard Law Montgomery , planned an offensive to capture Caen and to prevent a large redeployment of German forces from the Anglo @-@ Canadian sector to the American front . 
 On 4 July , the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division launched Operation Windsor , to seize Carpiquet and the adjacent airfield from the 12th SS @-@ Panzer Division . Carpiquet fell on 5 July , the airfield remained in German hands . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 = = = Allies = = = 
 Having failed to take Caen through successive flanking manoeuvres , Montgomery decided the next attack would be a frontal assault . Although Caen 's strategic importance had vastly diminished since D @-@ Day , he sought control of Bourguébus and the commanding high ground to the south . On 5 July the orders for Operation Charnwood were issued ; it was to be launched at 04 : 20 , an hour and a half before dawn on 8 July . 
 The objective of Charnwood was to clear Caen of its defenders up to the Orne river and if possible to secure bridgeheads in southern Caen . To achieve the latter it was planned to send an armoured column through the city to rush the bridges ; it was hoped that I Corps could exploit the situation to sweep on through southern Caen towards the Verrières and Bourguébus ridges , paving the way for the British Second Army to advance towards Falaise . Historian Roger <unk> however points out the operation was designed to clear the town of German forces ; due to it being cut by both a river and a canal any attempts to make rapid progress through and beyond Caen were " in all probability , impossible . " 
 Crocker 's 115 @,@ 000 @-@ strong I Corps was assigned the task of penetrating to the Orne and Odon rivers . The 3rd Infantry Division would attack on a one brigade front from the north @-@ east , supported by the 33rd Armoured Brigade ; the 59th ( Staffordshire ) Infantry Division would attack on a two brigade front from the north , supported by the 27th Armoured Brigade ; and the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division would attack on a one brigade front from the northwest , supported by the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade . To maintain the maximum possible pressure on German forces in the sector , VIII Corps was placed on 24 hours notice to launch further attacks to the west of Caen . 
 In the light of lessons learned from the partial Canadian success during Operation Windsor , Charnwood was to be launched on a broad front to increase the pressure on the German defences and disperse their defensive fire . SHAEF planners had advised , on 10 June , that the best way to break a stalemate was to use air power to support an attack ; this method was to be used for Charnwood as Montgomery enlisted the aid of RAF Bomber Command . Heavy bombers would attack Caen on the night preceding the assault , with 15 % of the total bomb load being delayed action bombs set to explode when the ground attack was launched . A second wave of light bombers would follow the heavies and a third wave of American bombers would attack on the morning of the operation . 
 Additional support would be provided by rocket firing Typhoon fighter @-@ bombers , the monitor HMS Roberts , the light cruisers HMS Belfast and HMS Emerald and the 16 @-@ inch guns of the battleship Rodney . Five divisions would contribute 656 guns for bombarding German positions to the south . In all , it was planned that 2 @,@ 000 tons of bombs would be dropped on Caen before the infantry assault began . Due to the proximity of the target area to the Allied lines and the resulting risk of friendly casualties , the aiming point for the bombers was shifted 6 @,@ 000 yards ( 5 @,@ 500 m ) to the south — beyond most of the main German defences screening the city . Following a long saturation bombardment , the three infantry divisions were to push through the fortified villages in their path and advance directly into Caen 's northern suburbs . 
 = = = Germans = = = 
 Caen 's defence fell to two divisions ; the 12th SS Panzer Division of I SS Panzer Corps , and the 16th Luftwaffe Field Division of LXXXVI Corps . An assault on the city was expected , and it was assumed that further attacks in the Odon valley towards the Orne river would quickly follow suit . The 12th SS Panzer Division , commanded by Kurt Meyer , consisted of three panzergrenadier regiments including one — the 1st SS Panzergrenadier Regiment — borrowed from the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler ( 1st SS Panzer Division ) . With its 61 surviving tanks 12th SS Panzer was holding the northwest approaches to Caen , defending the city and Carpiquet airfield from the 3rd Canadian and 59th British Infantry Divisions . 
 The main German defensive line , a 9 @-@ kilometre ( 5 @.@ 6 mi ) arc of villages from the northeast to the west , was held by the 25th SS Panzergrenadier Regiment and elements of the 12th SS Panzer Regiment . Troops from the 26th SS Panzergrenadier Regiment were holding the western flank , concentrating their strength , which included mortar batteries and a few tanks , in the area around Carpiquet airfield . The 1st SS Panzergrenadier Regiment was occupying a line from <unk> to the western end of <unk> ; the villages formed mutually @-@ supporting strongpoints with dug @-@ in tanks and assault guns , and the defensive line was 2 – 3 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 – 4 @.@ 8 km ) in depth , supplemented by anti @-@ tank ditches , weapons pits , minefields and other obstacles . The rest of the division , with 35 tanks of the 12th SS Panzer Regiment , were held in reserve , with elements located north , west and south of the city . Most of the division 's artillery had been moved back across the Orne , and the divisional command centre had been relocated from the Ardenne Abbey to Abbaye @-@ aux @-@ Dames in the centre of Caen . 
 The 16th Luftwaffe Field Division was an inexperienced infantry division that had only recently arrived in Normandy to relieve the 21st Panzer Division of its defence of Caen and its positions east of the Caen canal . The division was under @-@ trained and lacked sufficient anti @-@ tank weapons ; to remedy the latter it was reinforced with a tank battalion from 21st Panzer . The Luftwaffe division was deployed on both sides of the Orne , with three battalions holding the villages to the immediate north of the city . The 1st SS Panzer Division was roughly 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) south of Caen with a regiment of dual purpose 88 mm guns from the III Flak Corps . The II SS Panzer Corps was to the west , with the 10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg around 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) southwest of the city . 
 = = = Air attack , 7 July = = = 
 On the night of 7 July , 467 Lancaster and Halifax heavy bombers of the Royal Air Force — half of Bomber Command 's strength — attacked Caen , dropping over 2 @,@ 000 long tons ( 2 @,@ 000 t ) of bombs on the city . Although intended mainly to facilitate the Anglo @-@ Canadian advance and to prevent German reinforcements from reaching the battle or retreating through Caen , a secondary consideration was the suppression of the German defences . In this the bombing largely failed ; the main German armour and infantry positions to the north of Caen remained intact . Several tanks were hit and temporarily disabled but only two Panzer IV of the 12th SS Panzer Division were destroyed . General Miles Dempsey , in command of the British Second Army , was more concerned with the morale @-@ boosting effect of the bombing on his troops , than any material losses it might inflict on the Germans . 
 The pathfinders of No. 625 Squadron RAF , dropping the target markers for the bombers , were instructed not to allow the target zone to " drift back " towards the Allied lines as had been the tendency in earlier operations . Together with the cautious shifting of the target zone during the planning stage , the effect was that in many cases the markers were dropped too far forward , pushing the bombed zone well into Caen itself and further away from the German defences . By 22 : 00 on 7 July , the bombers had departed , leaving 80 percent of the north of Caen destroyed . Caen University was particularly hard hit , starting chemical fires that soon spread . At 22 : 50 , six squadrons of de Havilland Mosquito bombers attacked individual targets and ten minutes later the 636 guns of the assaulting divisions opened fire , with the battleship Rodney and other ships adding their support . The bombardment was intensified by the artillery of VIII Corps , against the villages north of Caen , to eliminate German strong points before the infantry assault began . 
 = = Battle = = 
 = = = 8 July = = = 
 At 04 : 30 on 8 July , the artillery of I and VIII Corps shifted their fire deeper into the German defensive belt , along the axes of advance of the 3rd Canadian Division and the 59th ( Staffordshire ) Infantry Division . As the infantry and armour moved off their start @-@ lines , the barrage slowly crept forward , concentrating its fire on positions in front of the Anglo @-@ Canadian troops ; four battalions and two armoured regiments advancing on a two brigade front . At 07 : 00 , 192 B @-@ 26 Marauder medium bombers arrived over the battlefield but finding it obscured by cloud only 87 aircraft were able to drop their bombs , totalling 133 long tons ( 135 t ) . Some bombs landed on the 12th SS Headquarters at Abbaye @-@ aux @-@ Dames . 
 Crocker launched the second phase of Operation Charnwood at 07 : 30 , although neither division had yet reached its objectives . The 26th SS Panzergrenadier Regiment was still in control of high ground around the Carpiquet airfield on the right flank of the advance . On the left , facing the relatively weak defences of the 16th Luftwaffe Field Division , the 3rd Infantry Division made good progress . They attacked <unk> and rapidly pushed through the village , although fighting intensified as the division reached <unk> . Concerned about the state of the Luftwaffe division , General Heinrich Eberbach , in command of Panzer Group West ordered the 21st Panzer Division to redeploy north @-@ east of Caen in support . The manoeuvre was spotted and when 21st Panzer attempted to cross the Caen Canal , a naval bombardment was directed against them . Facing the possibility of heavy losses , the move was abandoned . In the centre , the 176th Brigade of the 59th Division was encountering much stiffer resistance from the 12th SS Panzer Regiment in <unk> and la <unk> . The 197th Brigade bypassed <unk> and by noon had reached St @-@ Contest . 
 Further to the west , the 9th Infantry Brigade of the 3rd Canadian Division had been involved in heavy fighting in Buron , which was defended by 200 men from the 12th SS . With support from the 10th Armoured Regiment ( The Fort Garry Horse ) , by noon Buron had been taken , although the Canadian assault companies suffered 60 % casualties . South of Buron , a counter @-@ attack by Panzer IV and Panther tanks of the 12th SS Panzer Regiment was defeated by <unk> SP Achilles self @-@ propelled anti @-@ tank guns and 17 @-@ pounder anti tank guns of the 245th Battery , 62nd Antitank Regiment . Thirteen German tanks were destroyed in one of the most successful antitank engagements of the campaign , for the loss of four tank destroyers and a further four damaged . <unk> was captured with relatively less difficulty , with the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade encountering only mortar and artillery fire in their drive to Authie . The capture of Authie facilitated the 59th Infantry Division assault on St @-@ Contest and that village fell too , clearing the way for an advance on Caen . In Phase 3 of the operation , the 7th Brigade pushed towards the former headquarters of the 12th SS Panzer Division at Ardenne Abbey , securing the position before midnight . 
 The British 3rd Division brushed aside 16th Luftwaffe and approached the outskirts of Caen from the north @-@ east . At 19 : 15 , Meyer and Eberbach authorised the withdrawal of the 12th SS Panzer Division heavy weapons and the remnants of the Luftwaffe division across the Orne to the southern side of Caen . In the early evening , the 12th SS fought a rearguard action against elements of the 59th and 3rd Canadian divisions , as it pulled back from positions no longer considered tenable . Reports of this withdrawal came into the Anglo @-@ Canadian command but patrols probing German positions , created a false perception that no withdrawal was taking place . 
 = = = 9 July = = = 
 British and Canadian patrols began to infiltrate the city at dawn on 9 July . The airfield at Carpiquet finally fell into Allied hands during the early morning , when the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division discovered that the 26th SS Panzergrenadier Regiment had withdrawn during the night . With the German situation north of the river becoming increasingly precarious , 21st Panzer Division battle groups and the remaining regiments of the 12th SS Panzer Division conducted a slow withdrawal across the Orne , making for the Verrières and Bourguébus Ridges . By noon the 3rd British Infantry Division had reached the Orne 's north bank , virtually destroying the elements of the 16th Luftwaffe Field Division , positioned west of the Orne , in the process . A few hours later the British and Canadians met in the centre of the city and by 18 : 00 the northern half of Caen was firmly under Allied control ; all I Corps 's objectives had been achieved . A few of Caen 's bridges were intact but these were either blocked by rubble or defended by German troops on the south bank and the 1st SS Panzer Division had by now positioned itself to oppose any further advance . 
 The 12th SS Panzer Division ( by the end of the battle the division 's infantry strength had been reduced to that of a battalion ) — claimed over the course of two days to have destroyed 103 British and Canadian tanks for the loss of 20 . On entering Caen the Anglo @-@ Canadian troops found it in ruins , with four @-@ fifths of the Old City reduced to rubble by the 7 July bombings . The debris that choked the streets made it almost impossible for British armour to manoeuvre through the northern half of the city , preventing Second Army from exploiting I Corps 's success . Without possession of the terrain flanking the south of the city , no further gains could be made within Caen so by mid @-@ afternoon on 9 July , Operation Charnwood was over .

 The German were forced to withdraw from the north of the Orne but Allied forces were unable to push beyond the Orne . German forces were dug @-@ in on the opposite bank in position to block a move south . Montgomery called off an advance beyond the Orne as further attacks would be too costly for the gains made , which had inflicted much attrition on the defenders . For French public opinion the operation was a coup ; civilians now believed the liberation of France was under way 
 Antony Beevor called Operation Charnwood a partial success , because although much of Caen was taken , the British and Canadians failed to secure enough ground to expand the Allied build @-@ up ; the bulk of the First Canadian Army was still waiting in the United Kingdom for transfer to Normandy . Carlo D 'Este wrote that Charnwood did improve the Second Army 's position but without the high ground to the south , Caen was useless , the capture of the city was too little too late a hollow victory . Chester Wilmot wrote that for Montgomery to maintain a threat to German @-@ occupied Paris , Caen 's southern suburbs with their factories and communications network would have been a more significant prize . Buckley and Copp note that by the time the city was captured , the Germans — weakened by the battles of late June and early July — had already established defensive positions on the high ground to the south of the Orne , which blocked the route to the Falaise plain 
 Copp also wrote that the British Second Army won an important operational victory during Charnwood and the Society for Army Historical Research recorded that the attacks were a tactical and operational success . In the aftermath , the Supreme Allied Commander , General Dwight D. Eisenhower expressed his concern that a breakout was unlikely . Montgomery differed ; the tenacity of the German defence was no barometer of its longevity . Field Marshal Erwin Rommel mentioned to Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Caesar von <unk> that the front @-@ line in France could only be held for another three weeks . <unk> was a member of the German resistance and linked with the Hitler assassination plot and according to Trew , Rommel 's comment led to the plot timetable being decided . 
 The serious losses sustained in maintaining a static defence during June led to fractures in the German high command . On 1 July , Panzer Group West commander Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg had been replaced by Heinrich Eberbach , following disagreements with Hitler over how the campaign should be conducted . Gerd von Rundstedt , soon followed , that evening , in a telephone conversation with Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel , head of OKW , von Rundstedt said " Make peace , you fools . " Taken to task over his endorsement of von Schweppenburg 's recommendation for a withdrawal , he replied " If you doubt what we 're doing , get up here and take over this shambles yourself " . The following morning , informed that perhaps his health was " no longer up to the task " , von Rundstedt resigned and was succeeded as OB West by Günther von Kluge . The costly battles in and around Caen and Saint @-@ Lô convinced both Eberbach and von Kluge that their predecessors had been correct . The Germans had suffered heavily , leading Hitler to order Army Group B to temporarily abandon big counter @-@ attacks and go over to the defensive until more reinforcements could arrive to bolster the front . 
 Trew contends that the capture of northern Caen had a psychological impact on the French population , convincing them the Allies were there to stay and that the liberation of France could not be far off . By Operation Charnwood 's conclusion , Allied losses since 6 June had amounted to over 30 @,@ 000 men , excluding those who had been evacuated due to sickness and those suffering from battle exhaustion . Buckley believes Charnwood to have been a good idea but one that proved better in concept than in execution , influenced as it was by the mounting political pressure on 21st Army Group to produce results . Copp wrote that the broad @-@ based assault plan across the entire front worked , preventing the Germans bringing to bear superior firepower on any one formation . 
 Copp wrote that Charnwood should have produced a rapid breakthrough but concedes that the battle was one of the most difficult of the campaign . Buckley singles out poor cooperation between armoured and infantry units as one of the reasons for such high Allied losses ; he is critical of the habit of tanks standing off from German positions and firing the infantry onto the objective like artillery , instead of moving forward to give close support . He further notes that from the German perspective , the Anglo @-@ Canadian forces apparently lacked the desire or ability to press home their advantages , citing Kurt Meyer 's opinion that during the battle the Allies allowed the opportunity of destroying his 12th SS Panzer Division to elude them . Buckley comments on the defensive power of the British and Canadian formations . The German practice of conducting immediate local counter @-@ attacks to retake lost ground cost them many of their best troops , losses they could ill @-@ afford . He illustrates this with a typical action during which the Germans lost 13 tanks to British self @-@ propelled anti @-@ tank guns . 
 With Caen north of the River Orne in Allied hands , mine @-@ clearance operations were launched , bulldozers were set to work to clear the streets and a convoy of trucks carrying supplies for the civilian population was brought in . On 10 July the French flag was raised over the city and three days later a parade was held in the Place Saint @-@ Martin during which a second flag was raised to the strains of Scottish <unk> playing La Marseillaise . 
 Rommel and Eberbach consolidated defensive positions in and around southern Caen , the 12th , 1st and 9th SS Panzer Divisions turning the Bourguébus and Verrières Ridges into formidable barriers . Having committed all of his armoured reserves , Rommel transferred the remainder of his infantry divisions — the <unk> , <unk> , 277th and 272nd — to the Anglo @-@ Canadian front . On 8 July he released the remnants of the Panzer Lehr Division and the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich to the American sector . At the start of the campaign , Panzer @-@ Lehr was one of the most powerful armoured formations in the German army , by this stage it had been reduced to a number of battlegroups and was no longer operational as a division . On 17 July , Rommel 's staff car was strafed by British fighters , severely injuring the Field Marshal and confining him to hospital . Two days later he was replaced as Army Group B commander by Field Marshal Günther von Kluge . Rommel never returned to Normandy ; implicated in the 20 July plot against Hitler , on 14 October he was forced to commit suicide . 
 Caen 's partial capture allowed General Omar Bradley , commander of the United States First Army , to accelerate his plans for a breakout . Shortly after Charnwood the US VII Corps attacked German positions in Saint @-@ Lô , which the 2nd SS Panzer Division had been ordered to " hold at all costs " . On 18 July , after eight days of fighting during which 95 percent of the town was destroyed and VII Corps had more than 5 @,@ 000 casualties , Saint @-@ Lô fell to the Americans . 
 The same day , Miles Dempsey 's Second Army launched Operation Goodwood with from 1 @,@ 100 – 1 @,@ 300 tanks in the largest armoured battle in British military history . Lieutenant @-@ General Richard O 'Connor 's VIII Corps spearheaded the drive towards the Bourguébus Ridge with three armoured divisions , supported by Crocker 's I Corps . After a preliminary attack by 1 @,@ 056 heavy bombers , elements of the 11th , Guards and 7th Armoured Division assaulted the positions of LXXXVI Corps north of Bourguébus but despite early gains of around 12 @,@ 000 yards ( 11 km ) , strong resistance prevented VIII Corps taking the ridge . Simultaneously , Lieutenant General Guy Simonds 's newly activated II Canadian Corps launched an offensive on the Verrières Ridge , codenamed Operation Atlantic . II Corps ran into fierce opposition ; during the seven @-@ day battle that followed the Canadians sustained 2 @,@ 800 casualties . Verrières Ridge would remain in German hands until 8 August . 
 = = = Battle honours = = = 
 The British and Commonwealth system of battle honours recognises the battle by the award to 55 units of the honour Caen , for participation in the capture of Caen between 4 – 18 July 1944 . Awarded from 1956 to 1959 , the recognition was accompanied by honours for taking part in Operation Charnwood . For participating in the capture of Caen between 8 – 9 July three units were awarded the honour Orne , nine the honour The Orne , and two the honour The Orne ( Buron ) . 
 = = = Bombing = = = 
 Hastings wrote that the bombing came to be seen by many as " one of the most futile air attacks of the war " and Beevor called the attack a " disaster " . Reynolds judged the results of the bombing as " pathetic " and D 'Este wrote that the bombing hindered the Allied push into the city . Air Commodore E. J. Kingston @-@ McCloughry and Solly Zuckerman conducted a survey and concluded that no targets of military value had been attacked , nor were there any gun positions , tanks or German dead in the target zone . They interviewed men of the 3rd Infantry Division , who were reportedly bewildered as to why the bombers had been employed . The 3rd Division historian , wrote that in the wake of the air @-@ raid the men 
 ... for the first time for weeks breathed freely . The full support of the Air Force gave them full hearts ... and the men were encourage . 
 The Canadian Official Historian , C. P. Stacey wrote that several Canadian formations reported an increase in morale . Wilmot wrote that the bombing was essential because it raised the morale of the Second Army and depressed that of the German defenders . 
 A 21st Army Group intelligence report , based on the interrogation of German prisoners recorded that the raid was " decisive " and had apparently destroyed the headquarters of the Luftwaffe infantry regiment based north of Caen and deprived the German troops north of the city of ammunition and rations the following morning . Gray wrote that the bombing had an effect on the morale of both sides but that this was temporary . L. F. Ellis , the British Official Historian , Trew and Badsey all wrote that the raid was intended to cut off German reinforcements from the battlefield and hinder an attempt to withdraw south of the Orne river . Stacey wrote that it was " obvious and desirable " that for maximum advantage , the Allied ground forces should have advanced on the heels of the attack . Gray concluded that no @-@ one " can [ not ] satisfactorily answer the question ' why ' " the city was bombed . 
 Analysis by Operational Research Section Number 2 ( <unk> ) concluded that the bombing of the first aiming point north @-@ west of Caen was accurate , finding that the centre of the 90 percent zone ( the area where 90 percent of the bombs fell ) was 200 – 300 yards ( 180 – 270 m ) east of the aiming point , with some spillage to the south and west . Examination of the area after its capture , indicated some destruction of German equipment , including the wreckage of ten of the forty trucks believed to be in the area at the time of the raid . The 48 hours that elapsed between the bombing and the Allied occupation of the area , allowed the Germans time to recover from any shock and disorientation and to salvage some damaged equipment . Examination of the second aiming point , " Northern Caen " , failed to reveal a 90 percent zone but it was noted that the obstructive effect of bombing a suburb was significant and had caused substantial delays to vehicles of both sides , by cratering and blocking roads . <unk> concluded that the success of Charnwood owed little to the bombing and made recommendations including changing to instantly fused bombs , dropping larger numbers of smaller anti @-@ personnel bombs and rapidly following @-@ up a bombardment with ground forces to take advantage of its main effect , which was the temporary suppression of German will to resist . In Operation Goodwood , Operation Bluecoat , Operation Cobra , Operation Totalize and Operation Tractable the 21st Army Group exploited better the effect of preparatory attacks by strategic bombers by following @-@ up the attacks immediately . 
 The British initially announced that around 6 @,@ 000 civilians had been killed during the air @-@ raid and a Soviet war correspondent attached to the 21st Army Group , Lieutenant @-@ Colonel <unk> , put the figure as high as 22 @,@ 000 , a claim that was used by French communists in post @-@ war anti @-@ British propaganda . It was later found that 300 – 400 civilians were killed in the raid . Caen citizens were relieved and provided their liberators with a welcome that the troops found very moving ; French accounts of the time claim that " All [ of ] Caen was in the streets to greet them " . Although Ellis called the French welcome " pathetic " , no Allied unit recorded any complaints about the reception they were given . Stacey wrote that the populace were " particularly delighted to find their city freed in part by men from Canada " . Beevor wrote that most of the population were numb from the shock and quoted a British soldier who recalled that " most ... women were crying , grief @-@ stricken and anguished " . As early as 12 June , the French Resistance had sent messengers to the British , informing them that refugees were gathering in the areas around the Abbaye @-@ aux @-@ Hommes and the Hôpital du Bon Sauveur and requested that these locations not to be bombed ; British assurances were given and these locations were nearly untouched . Gray wrote that after the war , the city population regarded itself as being martyred , which could be seen on the war memorial .

 = = = Operation Jupiter = = = 
 On 10 July , the 43rd ( Wessex ) Infantry Division attacked the positions of the 10th SS Panzer Division to the southwest of Caen on Hill 112 . Preceded by a two @-@ day bombardment that included support from naval vessels and Hawker Typhoons , the assault was designed to threaten Caen from the west and push back the 10th SS Panzer Division . This would secure the British Second Army an avenue for future offensives . The 43rd Wessex began their assault at dawn on 10 July , supported by two armoured brigades . By 08 : 00 British tanks and infantry were engaged with 10th SS Panzer and " well up " the slopes of Hill 112 . <unk> was taken around mid @-@ morning ; as the 4th Armoured Brigade and 43rd Wessex pressed their attack , Panzer Group West commander General Eberbach insisted that " Hill 112 is the pivotal point of the whole position West of Caen , and must therefore be held " . 
 The 102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion and the 1st SS Panzer Division were committed to its defence . The 4th Armoured Brigade reached the summit but in the evening were counter @-@ attacked by remnants of the 1st and 12th SS Panzer Divisions . The British offensive resumed the following day with the support of antitank regiments from the Second Army ; these had heavy losses in a counter @-@ attack by the 102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion . Hill 112 was briefly taken by a battalion of the Duke of Cornwall 's Light Infantry , only to be lost to further German counter @-@ attacks in the late afternoon . By the evening of 11 July , with both sides exhausted and having suffered heavily the offensive had reached a stalemate . The 43rd ( Wessex ) Infantry Division and its supporting armour had sustained two thousand casualties in the two days of fighting . 
 = 2005 Qeshm earthquake = 
 The 2005 Qeshm earthquake occurred on November 27 at 13 : 52 IRST ( 10 : 22 UTC ) on the sparsely populated Qeshm Island off Southern Iran , killing 13 people and devastating 13 villages . It was Iran 's second major earthquake of 2005 , following that at <unk> in February . The epicenter was about 1 @,@ 500 kilometers ( 930 mi ) south of Tehran , close to Iran 's southern borders . Initial measurements showed that the earthquake registered about 6 @.@ 0 on the moment magnitude scale , although that was reduced to 5 @.@ 8 after further analysis . More than 400 minor aftershocks followed the main quake , 36 of which were greater than magnitude 2 @.@ 5 . The earthquake occurred in a remote area during the middle of the day , limiting the number of fatalities . Iranian relief efforts were effective and largely adequate , leading the country to decline offers of support from other nations and UNICEF . 
 Qeshm Island is part of the Simply Folded Belt , the most seismically active part of the Zagros fold and thrust belt . Similar to most earthquakes in the area , the 2005 event resulted from reverse slip faulting . Since it lies in such a seismically active area , there is a high risk of destructive earthquakes in Iran ; 1 in 3 @,@ 000 deaths are attributable to earthquakes . One geophysicist has cited the lack of strict building codes as a serious concern . 
 = = Background = = 
 Iran experiences at least one minor earthquake per day on average , and the Zagros region is particularly prone to seismic activity . During the last 100 years , Iran has been hit by more than 130 events stronger than magnitude 5 , with damaging earthquakes near Qeshm recorded in 1360 , 1703 , 1884 , 1897 , 1902 , and 1905 . The majority of Iranian quakes occur in the upper crust , close to the surface , which means that they are potentially more destructive . 
 In terms of earthquake protection , Iran was named the " worst offender " in 2004 by Professor Roger Bilham of the University of Colorado at Boulder . Bilham , a geophysicist who specializes in earthquake @-@ related deformation and hazards , blames construction practices for many of the deaths in Iranian earthquakes . Since the start of the 20th century 1 in 3 @,@ 000 Iranians have died in earthquake @-@ related incidents . The United Nations ' Common Country Assessment for Iran states that the greatest damage occurs in rural areas , for which no building code exists . Large cities have a building code that takes account of the seismic hazard , but it is not rigorously followed , despite the susceptibility of three quarters of Iranian major cities to damaging earthquakes . The risk posed by poor engineering is of significant concern to the populace and an impediment to economic development . The 1990 Manjil – Rudbar earthquake , with at least 42 @,@ 000 fatalities , cost Iran roughly 7 @.@ 2 percent of its Gross National Product ( GNP ) for that year , and wiped out two years of economic growth . 
 = = Geological setting = = 
 Iran lies within the complex zone of collision between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate ; near Qeshm the rate of convergence is about 25 millimeters annually . Part of this convergence is accommodated by crustal shortening and thickening within the Zagros fold and thrust belt , with the remainder occurring to the north of the Iranian Plateau . The most active part of the Zagros is the Simply Folded Belt , which is characterised by large folds formed above a layer of late Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian Hormuz salt , which locally reaches the surface in the crests of some anticlines as salt diapirs . The sequence of sedimentary rocks above the salt layer comprises a basal Cambrian conglomerate beneath a thick sequence of limestones of Palaeozoic to late Cretaceous age , known together as the " Competent Group " owing to their relatively high mechanical strength , overlain by a sequence of weaker marls and interbedded limestones of latest Cretaceous to early Miocene age , topped by Neogene sandstones and conglomerates . There is evidence of intermediate level detachment at some of the weaker layers , which means that folds at different stratigraphic levels may have different locations , orientations , or wavelengths . Measurements of earthquake focal mechanisms and hypocentral depths show that shortening is accommodated by a mixture of high @-@ angle and low @-@ angle reverse faulting , within either the lowest part of the sedimentary cover or in the basement beneath the Hormuz salt . 
 The island of Qeshm is elongated WSW – ENE , parallel to the coastline and the regional trend of the main fold axes . Neogene sedimentary rocks outcrop at the surface over the whole island , apart from a <unk> of older Hormuz salt that pierces through to the surface at its western end . The sediments are affected by a series of large , mainly anticlinal folds that show a variety of trends in the central part of the island . The axis of the <unk> anticline runs mainly NW – SE , while the <unk> anticline trends roughly W – E and the <unk> anticline and <unk> syncline trend SW – NE . The island shows clear evidence of recent uplift in the form of marine terraces , with the highest terrace identified at 220 meters ( 720 ft ) above sea level . An uplift rate of 0 @.@ 2 millimeters annually has been estimated from uranium series dating ( 230Th / 234U ) of aragonite from corals on the terraces . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 The earthquake was initially measured at 6 @.@ 0 on the moment magnitude scale , although later analysis suggests a slightly lower value of 5 @.@ 8 . The epicenter was near the village of <unk> in central Qeshm , and a hypocentral depth of 10 kilometers ( 6 mi ) was estimated . The focal mechanism derived for the earthquake indicates that it was the result of reverse faulting on a fault plane dipping either to the north at 50 ° or to the south – southeast at 40 ° . No evidence has been found of surface faulting , but a 3 @-@ kilometer @-@ long ( 2 mi ) set of bedding @-@ parallel cracks was observed on the northwestern flank of the <unk> syncline , interpreted as representing probable slip along bedding planes , possibly due to further tightening of this fold . Other NW – SE trending tensional cracks observed further southwest along the syncline are more likely to be due to salt movement at depth . 
 Surface displacement during the earthquake was measured using SAR interferometry . The computed area of uplift is elongated W @-@ E , with a maximum value of about 20 centimeters ( 8 in ) centered over the eastern end of the Latif anticline . A smaller area of subsidence was observed to the south of the uplifted area , and the lack of a sharp boundary between the two suggests that the fault does not come to the surface . The pattern of displacement is consistent with a north @-@ dipping fault rupturing between about 8 kilometers ( 5 mi ) and 4 kilometers ( 2 mi ) in depth , which also provides a good match to the results of seismic modeling using body waves , although a SSE @-@ dipping plane remains possible . This depth range strongly suggests that the fault affected the lower part of the sedimentary cover , while not ruling out some basement involvement . The mismatch between the orientation of the fault planes that caused the earthquake and the observed surface folds suggests that deformation at these two levels is decoupled by the presence of a detachment , possibly within marl layers . 
 Most aftershocks occurred at significantly greater depths than the mainshock and are dominated by strike @-@ slip focal mechanisms . This suggests that the mainshock triggered later movement on a complex set of right and left lateral strike @-@ slip faults within the basement , together accommodating north @-@ south shortening beneath the Hormuz salt layer . 
 On September 10 , 2008 , there was another major earthquake on Qeshm , with a magnitude of 5 @.@ 9 and hypocentral depth of 8 kilometers ( 5 mi ) . The pattern of uplift observed for this earthquake is also consistent with rupturing within the lower sedimentary sequence , but on a fault with two segments , dipping overall to the southeast . The earthquakes of 2005 and 2008 may have ruptured adjacent segments of the same southeast @-@ dipping reverse fault . Seven deaths were reported as a result of the 2008 earthquake . 
 = = Damage and casualties = = 
 The earthquake hit at 13 : 52 : 19 IRST , or 1 : 52 pm ( 10 : 22 : 19 UTC ) , and lasted between 10 and 30 seconds . It killed 13 people and injured 100 on Qeshm Island . In <unk> ( <unk> ) , a village on Qeshm , 80 percent of the buildings were demolished . Seven villages experienced extensive damage , and 13 villages were destroyed : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Karavan , <unk> , Tom <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . There were reports of intensity III effects on the Mercalli scale from Bandar Abbas , Abu Dhabi , Ajman , Dubai , Fujairah and Ras al @-@ Khaimah ; Intensity IV ( Light ) effects occurred at Sharjah . Shaking from the earthquake was also noted in Oman . No major damage occurred directly at the epicenter ; residents of Qeshm reported that the shaking smashed windows , leading citizens to evacuate their homes fearing collapse . In total more than 2 @,@ 000 people were affected . 
 One major hospital damaged by the earthquake was inundated with the injured and lacked medical supplies for treatment . An airport on the epicentral island sustained damage , and power lines on the island were severed . The director of Tehran 's seismological building dismissed fears of a tsunami , saying that the Persian Gulf was not deep enough to allow for one . In one school , some people suffered broken legs when the building collapsed , but there were no fatalities . Buildings in Dubai , including the Emirates Towers , were evacuated because of concerns that the structures might collapse , but no such incidents occurred . One woman described the locals as " panicked " . Television stations throughout Iran released footage of quake damage and of injured residents being taken to hospitals . 
 A landslide and 36 major aftershocks of more than magnitude 2 @.@ 5 ( in total , 400 aftershocks ) followed the earthquake . A former Portuguese fortress , built by Admiral Afonso de Albuquerque in 1507 , sustained heavy damage to its eastern wall but otherwise remained intact . 
 If the earthquake had occurred during the early morning while residents were asleep , rather than mid @-@ afternoon ( 1 : 52 pm local time ) , it could have been deadlier as housing in the epicentral area consisted chiefly of mud and brick . 
 = = Relief efforts and aftermath = = 
 Aid workers from the domestic region began delivering supplies such as food , blankets , and tents . A dispatch of 101 relief helpers , 40 <unk> staff , and four people from the public relations department at <unk> also assisted survivors . Three ambulances , 46 trucks , three helicopters , 12 vans , nine cars , two minibuses , and two sniffer dogs were also dispatched to help citizens of quake @-@ struck areas . 
 Injured residents were transported to Bandar Abbas by helicopter . An Iranian police official , citing concerns about possible looting , said all movement into and out of damaged houses would require prior approval from the governor 's office , the police , and the Unexpected Events Committee on the island . UNICEF offered assistance to Iran , and the official in charge of response stated : " we are preparing to respond if needed " . They elaborated that the Iranian authorities " appeared to have things under control " . 
 In 2007 , the Asian Centre on Seismic Risk Reduction was formed in response to the regular earthquakes experienced in south , west , and central Asia , to " encourage regional and inter @-@ regional networking and partnerships to reduce seismic damage " . Earthquakes account for 73 percent of natural disaster deaths in these locations .

 " White Rabbit " is the fifth episode of the first season of Lost . The episode was directed by Kevin Hooks and written by Christian Taylor . It first aired on October 20 , 2004 , on ABC . 
 The episode is centered on the character of Jack Shephard ( Matthew Fox ) , with flashbacks revealing his past , including his childhood and his trip to Australia looking for his missing father Christian Shephard . In present @-@ day events , the plane crash survivors begin to struggle as they realize they are running out of fresh water . While Jack tries to solve the conflicts , he starts seeing Christian in the jungle , and chases the hallucination of his dead father . 
 The episode attracted an estimated 16 @.@ 82 million live viewers . It received mostly positive reviews , and was listed as # 49 on IGN 's ranking of every episode of Lost .

 A young Jack Shephard ( John O 'Hara ) and a friend are being beaten up . One bully gives Jack the chance to leave , but he decides to help his friend , causing Jack to be further assaulted . When Jack 's father , Christian Shephard ( John Terry ) sees his son 's beaten face , he tells Jack he should not be a hero because he " doesn 't have what it takes . " 
 Many years later , Jack ( Matthew Fox ) visits his mother , ( Veronica Hamel ) who tells him that Christian has left for Australia , and asks Jack to bring his father back . Jack reluctantly agrees , and after arriving in Sydney searches the hotel at which his father was staying . The manager informs Jack that his father has not slept at the hotel for several days following an incident at a bar , and Jack finds bottles of alcohol , pills , and his father 's wallet in Christian 's room . 
 Jack is shown identifying his father 's corpse in a morgue , where the coroner ( Geoff Heise ) tells Jack that the death was possibly caused by an alcohol @-@ induced heart attack . Jack later argues with Oceanic Airlines ticket agent Chrissy ( <unk> <unk> ) , who says the documentation to board Christian 's coffin aboard Flight 815 is incomplete . Jack , frustrated , explains that all the arrangements are set for the funeral once he arrives at LAX , and he needs to bury his father , because he needs it " to be over " . 
 = = = On the Island = = = 
 Jack Shephard ( Matthew Fox ) rescues Boone Carlyle ( Ian Somerhalder ) in the ocean as Boone fails to swim out to save a drowning woman , Joanna . Later , as Jack is approached by Hugo " Hurley " Reyes ( Jorge Garcia ) and Charlie Pace ( Dominic Monaghan ) as they question how to deal with the diminishing water supplies of the survivors , Boone confronts Jack regarding how he saved him and not Joanna , asking who made Jack their leader . Jack again sees the man who he saw in the previous episode , " Walkabout " , and runs off after him . Once Jack catches up , he recognizes the man as his father , and the man runs away again . While chasing him , Jack trips and rolls down a mountain , just barely grabbing on to the edge of a cliff . 
 Back at the beach , Claire Littleton ( Emilie de Ravin ) faints due to dehydration , and Charlie is unable to find the remaining water . John Locke ( Terry O 'Quinn ) volunteers to search for water in the jungle , and , while searching , discovers Jack hanging on the precipice . After rescuing him , the two talk , with Jack saying he does not want to be a leader because he " doesn 't have what it takes " , while Locke advises him to pursue his " hallucination " of his father , comparing it to the White Rabbit from Alice in Wonderland and explaining his belief that everything on the Island happens for a reason . At nightfall , Jack follows a sound he heard in the jungle , leading him to stumble upon a cave containing a spring of fresh water , where he finds some debris from the plane , including his father 's coffin . Jack opens it and finds the coffin empty , leading him to tear it apart in frustration . 
 Back on the beach , Boone gives water to an unconscious Claire . After being caught by Charlie , Boone admits that it is he who stole the water , in an attempt to take responsibility for its rationing . A fight between him and some of the other survivors begins , but Jack returns and interrupts with a speech , saying that he has found fresh water and that they must all band together if they are to survive , because " if we can 't live together , we 're going to die alone .

 " White Rabbit " aired on October 20 , 2004 . The episode was directed by Kevin Hooks and written by Christian Taylor . Taylor declared the underlying message was of " a man 's journey to find out who he really is " , in how solving Jack 's conflicted relationship with his father gave him an excuse to reinvent himself and was " integrated into what Jack becomes in the context of the series " . Showrunner Damon Lindelof was <unk> in working with the episode , even if " it did not end with a big shocking twist or surprise " like predecessor " Walkabout " . Lindelof was particularly positive about " this great scene between Jack and Locke in the woods , " which still influenced the characters ' later discussions about faith , such as in the fourth season finale " There 's No Place Like Home " . 
 In the scene when Jack is dangling from the cliff , Matthew Fox performs the stunt himself , as he considered that relying on stunt doubles " always sort of inhibits the director 's ability to shoot it in cool ways . " Fox dangled from a thirty foot high cliff in front of a blue screen , that through digital extensions appeared to be hundreds of feet high . However , Fox 's long time stunt actor , Steve Blalock , performed Jack 's rolling down the mountain before grabbing the edge of the cliff , given Fox considered that " there are some things that I 'm not gonna be able to do " . 
 The episode is named after the White Rabbit from the tale Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland , who leads the story 's title character , Alice , deeper and deeper down a hole to a whimsical world called Wonderland , while meeting different characters . Just as Alice followed the White Rabbit deeper and deeper down the hole to Wonderland , Jack follows his father deeper and deeper into the jungle . Geoff Heise , who shows Jack his dead father at the morgue , is also in the Pilot episode as a survivor . It is unclear why this is so , and whether or not his portrayal of two seemingly unrelated characters has any symbolism . The episode marks the first appearance of actor John Terry , who plays Jack 's father , Christian Shephard ( the mysterious man who Jack chases in the jungle ) . In the previous episode , " Walkabout " , Christian was played by a stand @-@ in actor , as the character hadn 't been cast yet ; thus , only the back of his head was shown .

An estimated 16 @.@ 82 million viewers in America watched the episode on its first broadcast , and it finished second in its timeslot behind the 2004 Major League Baseball season playoffs . Among adults aged 18 to 49 , the episode earned a ratings share of 6 @.@ 3 / 16 , finishing in fourteenth place for the week . Based upon the series ' success , ABC picked up Lost for the full season soon after the broadcast of " White Rabbit " , ordering another nine episodes beyond the thirteen it had already agreed upon . 
 The episode received mostly positive reviews . Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A- , writing that " The structure of ' White Rabbit ' is kind of half @-@ formed , in a way that strikes me as very similar to the structure of ' Tabula Rasa ' , but I think that feeling of everything having been tossed together at the last minute suits the episode in a way it didn ’ t the earlier one . " VanDerWerff also writes , " the more I think about this episode , the more I admire it for taking away Jack ’ s agency .

 = The Colour Out of Space = 
 " The Colour Out of Space " is a short story written by American horror author H. P. Lovecraft in March 1927 . In the tale , an unnamed narrator pieces together the story of an area known by the locals as the " blasted heath " in the wild hills west of Arkham , Massachusetts . The narrator discovers that many years ago a meteorite crashed there , poisoning every living being nearby ; vegetation grows large but foul tasting , animals are driven mad and deformed into grotesque shapes , and the people go insane or die one by one . 
 Lovecraft began writing " The Colour Out of Space " immediately after finishing his previous short novel , The Case of Charles Dexter Ward , and in the midst of final revision on his horror fiction essay " Supernatural Horror in Literature " . Seeking to create a truly alien life form , he drew inspiration from numerous fiction and nonfiction sources . First appearing in the September 1927 edition of Hugo Gernsback 's science fiction magazine Amazing Stories , " The Colour Out of Space " became one of Lovecraft 's most popular works , and remained his personal favorite short story . It was adapted into feature film versions in 1965 , 1987 , and 2010 . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 An unnamed surveyor from Boston telling the story in the first @-@ person perspective attempts to uncover the secrets behind a shunned place referred to by the locals of Arkham as the " blasted heath . " Unable to garner any information from the townspeople , the protagonist seeks out an old and allegedly crazy man by the name of Ammi Pierce , who relates his personal experiences with a farmer who used to live on the cursed property , Nahum Gardner . Pierce claims that the troubles began when a meteorite crashed into Gardner 's lands in June 1882 . 
 The meteorite never cools , but begins shrinking , and local scientists cannot discern its origins . As the stone shrinks , it leaves behind globules of colour that are referred to as such only by analogy , as they fall outside the range of anything known in the visible spectrum . These remains eventually disappear but , the following season , Gardner 's crops come in unnaturally large and abundantly . When he discovers that , despite their appearance , they are inedible , he becomes convinced the meteorite has poisoned the soil . Over the following year , the problem spreads to surrounding vegetation and local animals , altering them in unusual ways . Plant life around the farmhouse becomes " slightly luminous in the dark , " and Gardner 's wife eventually goes mad , forcing him to lock her in the attic . During this time , Gardner begins to isolate his family from the rest of the town and Pierce slowly becomes his only contact with the outside world . 
 Soon after Gardner 's wife becomes mad , the vegetation begins eroding into a grey powder and the water from the well becomes tainted . One of Gardner 's sons , Thaddeus , goes insane like his mother and is similarly locked in a different room in the attic . The livestock begins turning grey and dying and , like the crops , their meat is tasteless and inedible . Thaddeus eventually dies and Merwin , another of Gardner 's sons , goes missing during an excursion to retrieve water from the well . After two weeks of silence from Gardner , Pierce visits the farmstead and witnesses the tale 's eponymous horror for the first time in the attic . Gardner 's final son , Zenas , has disappeared and the " colour " has infected Nahum 's wife , whom Pierce puts out of her misery . He then flees the decaying house as the horror destroys the last surviving resident , Nahum . 
 Pierce returns to the farmstead shortly after with six other men , including a doctor , who begin examining Nahum 's remains . They discover Merwin and Zenas ' eroding skeletons at the bottom of the well , as well as remnants of several other creatures . As they reflect upon their discoveries in the house , a light begins to emit from the well that eventually transforms into the " colour " and begins pouring out , spreading over everything nearby . The men flee the house just as the horror blights the land and then shoots toward the sky . Pierce alone turns back after the " colour " has gone and witnesses a small part of it try to follow the rest , only to fail and return to the well . The knowledge that part of the alien still resides on earth is sufficient to alter his mental state . When some of the men return the following day , there is nothing remaining but a dead horse and acres of grey dust , and the surrounding area is quickly abandoned by all of its remaining residents .

 Lovecraft began writing " The Colour Out of Space " in March 1927 , immediately after completing The Case of Charles Dexter Ward . As he wrote the tale , however , he was also typing the final draft of his horror fiction essay " Supernatural Horror in Literature " . Although the author himself claimed that his inspiration was the newly constructed Scituate Reservoir in Rhode Island , Lovecraft scholar S. T. Joshi believes that the planned <unk> Reservoir in Massachusetts must have influenced him as well . American writer and pulp fiction enthusiast Will Murray cites paranormal investigator Charles Fort , and the " <unk> " ( lightning @-@ drawing rocks that may have fallen from the sky ) he describes in The Book of the Damned , as possible inspirations for the behavior of the meteorite . 
 Lovecraft was dismayed at the all @-@ too human depiction of aliens in other works of fiction , and his goal for " Colour " was to create an entity that was truly alien . In doing so , he drew inspiration from a number of sources describing colors outside of the visible spectrum . Most notably , Joshi points to Hugh Elliott 's Modern Science and Materialism , a 1919 nonfiction book that mentions the " extremely limited " senses of humans , such that of the many " <unk> waves " striking the eyes , " The majority cannot be perceived by the retina at all . " Lovecraft had used this concept previously , in his 1920 short story , " From Beyond " . Completed by the end of March , " The Colour Out of Space " first appeared in Hugo Gernsback 's science fiction magazine , Amazing Stories in September 1927 . The story was illustrated by J. M. de Aragón , an artist who produced occasional artwork for the magazine . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 " The Colour Out of Space " became the only work from Amazing Stories to make Edward O 'Brien 's anthology of The Best American Short Stories , appearing in the 1928 " Roll of Honor " . Gernsback paid Lovecraft only $ 25 ( approximately $ 341 in present @-@ day terms ) and was late in doing so , leading Lovecraft to refer to the publisher as " Hugo the Rat " . He never again submitted anything to the publication . Lovecraft did not write another major short story until the following year , when he crafted " The Dunwich Horror " , although he did pen " History of the Necronomicon " and " <unk> " as minor works in @-@ between , as well as an account of a Halloween night 's dream that he called " The Very Old Folk " . 
 In addition to being Lovecraft 's personal favourite of his short stories , critics generally consider " The Colour Out of Space " one of his best works , and the first with his trademark blending of science fiction and horror . Lovecraft scholar Donald R. Burleson referred to the tale as " one of his stylistically and conceptually finest short stories . " Joshi praises the work as one of Lovecraft 's best and most frightening , particularly for the vagueness of the description of the story 's eponymous horror . He also lauded the work as Lovecraft 's most successful attempt to create something entirely outside of the human experience , as the creature 's motive ( if any ) is unknown and it is impossible to discern whether or not the " colour " is emotional , moral , or even conscious . His only criticism is that it is " just a little too long " . The text of " The Colour Out of Space " , like many of Lovecraft 's works , has fallen into public domain and can be accessed in several compilations of the author 's work , as well as on the Internet . It also had a strong influence on Brian Aldiss 's The Saliva Tree , which has been seen as a rewriting of Lovecraft 's tale . In 1984 , the novel The Color Out of Time by Michael Shea was published as a sequel to the original novelette .

 The 1965 film Die , Monster , Die ! , directed by Daniel Haller , is based on " The Colour Out of Space " . Nick Adams plays a scientist named Stephen Reinhart who travels to England to visit his fiancee ( played by Suzan Farmer ) at the home of her parents Nahum ( Boris Karloff ) and Letitia ( Freda Jackson ) . There he discovers that Nahum is keeping a space rock in his basement and using it to grow giant vegetation and mutated animals . The rock has driven Nahum and Letitia insane and , in the film 's climax , it transforms Nahum into a glowing monster . Lovecraft scholar Don G. Smith claims that , of the scenes that are derived from Lovecraft 's work , the " blasted heath doesn 't live up to Lovecraft 's description " and asserts that , overall , the film does not capture Lovecraft 's intent to " ... play ... with the idea of an alien life form completely different from anything humans can imagine . " Smith considers Haller 's work an imitation of Roger Corman 's Edgar Allan Poe films , rather than a serious attempt to adapt Lovecraft 's tale . 
 Another adaptation , 1987 's The Curse , was directed by David Keith and more closely follows the plot of Lovecraft 's work . A meteorite lands on the property of Nathan Hayes ( Claude Akins ) and local physician Alan Forbes ( Cooper Huckabee ) is unable to explain why the rock keeps shrinking . He is dissuaded from contacting the authorities by Charlie Davidson ( Steve Carlisle ) , a realtor who does not want the new arrival to discourage the Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA ) from establishing a new reservoir in the area . As the rock disappears , a glowing colour seeps out and into the ground . Within a few weeks , the farm 's crops bloom but soon turn out to be inedible . Shortly after , local animals , as well as Nathan 's wife , begin to go mad , and a previously unknown element is discovered in the property 's well . Soon Nathan and his son Cyrus ( Malcolm <unk> ) also go insane , and begin terrorizing those who come to the farm , including the other children Zack ( Wil Wheaton ) and Alice ( Amy Wheaton ) . In the film 's conclusion , they are saved by TVA representative Carl Willis ( John Schneider ) and the house collapses . Lovecraft scholar Charles P. Mitchell referred to the film as faithful to the author 's original work , but claimed that " [ t ] he last twenty minutes of the film are so disjointed that they virtually ruin the entire film " . 
 The 2010 film Die <unk> , directed by Huan Vu , is an adaptation set in Germany instead of in Massachusetts . It is shot mainly in black and white , the exception being the " Colour " itself . S. T. Joshi described it as " the best Lovecraft film adaptation ever made " . 
 = Downtown Triangle ( Jerusalem ) = 
 The Downtown Triangle ( Hebrew : <unk> , Ha @-@ <unk> , lit . " The Triangle " ) is a central commercial and entertainment district in Jerusalem , Israel . Measuring 29 @,@ 000 square metres ( 310 @,@ 000 sq ft ) , the area is bounded by Jaffa Road on the north , King George Street on the west , and Ben Yehuda Street on the southeast . Its vertices are the intersections of Jaffa Road and King George Street , King George and Ben Yehuda Streets , and Ben Yehuda Street and Jaffa Road ( the latter known as Zion Square ) . 
 From the mid @-@ 1940s through the 1960s , the Triangle was the commercial and cultural heart of Jerusalem , with many upscale shops and restaurants operated by German @-@ Jewish immigrant businessmen that appealed to an affluent clientele . Following the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967 and the expansion of the city away from the downtown core , the commercial viability of the Triangle declined . The area was revitalized by the conversion of Ben Yehuda Street and the interior streets of the Triangle to an open @-@ air pedestrian mall in 1982 . Over the next two decades , outdoor cafes and souvenir shops moved in , cementing the reputation of the Triangle as a popular shopping and entertainment venue for tourists and young Israelis . 
 = = History = = 
 Before the British Mandatory government took over in 1917 , the main commercial district in Jerusalem was in the Old City . With an eye to the continuing development of new neighborhoods outside the Old City Walls , the British drew up a master town plan that called for the establishment of two commercial hubs in the New City . The first commercial district to be built was the Downtown Triangle , although it was intended to play a secondary role to the other planned commercial district in the Mamilla area , which was closer to the Old City . However , the Mamilla development did not garner as much interest as the Triangle . 
 The land used for the Downtown Triangle had been purchased by the Jewish Colonization Association from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate , which began selling off some of its holdings in Jerusalem after World War I. The British developed the field into a triangular district ( hence its appellation , " The Triangle " ) demarcated by Jaffa Road , Ben Yehuda Street ( constructed by the British in 1922 ) and King George Street ( constructed by the British in 1924 ) . Lots were sold to large companies and cooperatives as well as private businesses . Other streets adjacent to the Triangle – <unk> <unk> , Mamilla , Agron , and King David Streets – were zoned for commercial and residential use . 
 = = = European ambience = = = 
 According to Jerusalem architectural historian David Kroyanker , the heyday of the Downtown Triangle lasted from the early 1930s to the 1970s . Many stores and restaurants were opened by German Jewish immigrants who sought to recreate a European ambience in the city center . Their upscale boutiques , coffeehouses , delicatessens , and exclusive restaurants were frequented by senior Mandate officials and wealthy , English @-@ speaking tourists . Unlike Israeli stores that sold all kinds of unrelated products under one roof , the Europeans introduced boutiques that featured only one item , such as gloves or ties . Some shops offered unique extras , such as coffeehouses that included an orchestra and dance floor , and a bookstore with a second @-@ floor library . 
 The European immigrant @-@ owned bookstores fueled the demand for detective fiction , historical reading , and periodicals from Germany and England . Steimatzky , which opened its first bookstore on Jaffa Road in the Triangle in 1925 , identified the growing taste for imported newspapers and magazines and bought the franchises for many of them . The European immigrants also created a market for cold cuts and cheeses , with three competing delicatessens on King George and Ben Yehuda Streets . For many years , the Triangle was also the only place where Jerusalem residents could purchase clothing , shoes , furniture , and household goods . 
 At its peak , the district was home to 14 cinemas screening the newest Hollywood fare . Located in close proximity to one another , the cinemas would attract both adults and youth , who would afterwards patronize the coffeehouses and restaurants . The Downtown Triangle was the cultural heart of the city and the place " to see and be seen " . 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 The cosmopolitan flavor of the Triangle extended to its buildings . The <unk> building , for example , has an " eclectic " design that combines " neo @-@ Renaissance and classicist elements " . Approximately 15 buildings in the Triangle were designed by architect Reuven Avraham Rabinowitz , who often added a row of roughly dressed stone to the facade to demarcate each story . 
 = = Decline and rebirth = = 
 Following the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967 , the city embarked on significant expansion . Large commercial centers were opened in the new , outlying neighborhoods of Talpiot , Givat Shaul , and Malha , drawing customers away from the city center . Government offices began moving out as well , precipitating the economic decline of the Downtown Triangle in the 1970s . The clientele of the upscale European boutiques had also aged , and the neighborhoods adjacent to downtown became occupied by poor and Haredi Jews who did not patronize the Triangle . The elegant shops gave way to hummus restaurants , dollar stores , and money changers . The advent of television precipitated the closure of most of the Triangle 's cinemas . 
 In 1982 , the city attempted to revitalize the downtown district by closing Ben Yehuda Street and the Triangle 's interior streets ( <unk> , Dorot Rishonim , <unk> , Ben Hillel , and <unk> Streets ) to traffic , and converting the entire area to an open @-@ air pedestrian mall . Though taxi companies demonstrated against the renovation and merchants claimed it would fail , the idea proved successful . Outdoor cafes , pizzerias , and fast @-@ food restaurants moved into the Triangle , together with shops selling souvenirs , Judaica , and jewelry to tourists . Street musicians , street artists , political promoters , and tables manned by Chabad and Breslov Hasidim add to the lively nature of the mall . The pedestrian mall restored the Triangle 's reputation as the " heart " of the city , although the formerly upscale , European tone was replaced by a more populist image . The introduction of the Jerusalem Light Rail in December 2011 further increased local and visitor traffic : estimates show that 36 @,@ 000 pedestrians per day visited the Triangle in April 2012 , up from 16 @,@ 000 per day in April 2004 . The mall is especially busy on Saturday nights , as eateries that have closed for Shabbat reopen and the streets are crowded with young Israelis from Jerusalem and Tel Aviv . 
 Beginning in the late 1990s , the pedestrian mall became noted for hosting a growing presence of at @-@ risk and homeless youth . Three youth centers – <unk> , <unk> 's Squat , and The Zone – operate in the vicinity of Zion Square . 
 = = = Bombing attacks = = = 
 Due to its centrality and large concentration of visitors and entertainment venues , the Downtown Triangle has been the target of numerous bombing attacks and attempted attacks . On 22 February 1948 , three British Army trucks led by an armored car driven by Arab irregulars and British deserters exploded on Ben Yehuda Street , killing 58 Jewish civilians and injuring 140 . On 4 July 1975 , a refrigerator containing 5 kilograms ( 11 lb ) of explosives detonated in Zion Square , killing 15 and wounding 77 . On 24 March 1979 , a bomb exploded in a trash can in Zion Square , killing one and wounding 13 . 
 During the suicide bomber era in the late 1990s , three suicide bombers stationed at different points on Ben Yehuda Street exploded themselves almost simultaneously , causing eight deaths and 277 injuries . A similar " relay " bombing attack took place on 1 December 2001 : Police and emergency medical personnel were rushing to the scene of a double suicide bombing attack in the Triangle when a car bomb exploded ; 20 died and 150 were wounded . Earlier , in August , a Sbarro restaurant at the corner of Jaffa Road and King George Street , packed with lunchtime customers , was bombed ; 15 people died and 90 were wounded . 
 In February 2014 , in response to lobbying by terror victims groups , the Jerusalem municipality held a ceremony and mounted a memorial plaque at the site of the 1948 bombing on Ben Yehuda Street . 
 = = Landmarks = = 
 The tallest building in the Triangle is the seven @-@ story , 5 @,@ 000 square metres ( 54 @,@ 000 sq ft ) Hamashbir <unk> department store , which opened on the eastern side of Zion Square in 2011 . It is the largest department store in Israel and the flagship store of the 38 @-@ store chain . Hamashbir is intimately associated with the Downtown Triangle , as the first Hamashbir store was established across the street from its current location in 1947 , and moved to another vertex of the Triangle , at King George and Ben Yehuda Streets , from 1970 to 2010 . 
 Freimann and Bein ( 50 Jaffa Road ) was the first luxury shoe store in Israel . Founded by German @-@ Jewish immigrants , it imported quality leather shoes from Europe and attracted a clientele of British officers and Arab sheikhs . The store originally opened in the <unk> Building further east on Jaffa Road in 1935 and moved to 50 Jaffa Road in 1947 . It closed in 2014 . Khalifa Shoes ( 44 Jaffa Road ) , founded in 1954 , is a Jewish family @-@ owned business specializing in Israeli @-@ made shoes and sandals . 
 The longest @-@ lasting dining establishments in the Triangle were Atara Cafe and Fink 's Bar . Atara Cafe operated at 7 Ben Yehuda Street from 1938 to 1996 . The European @-@ style coffeehouse was a favorite of Mandate officers , pre @-@ state paramilitary groups , and Israeli politicians , journalists , and bohemians . Fink 's Bar , at the corner of King George and <unk> Streets , was open from 1936 to 2006 . The intimate , exclusive restaurant was one of the most prestigious dining addresses in Jerusalem . Specializing in European cuisine , the restaurant / bar made its kitchen kosher in 2003 in order to overcome several years of declining business and broaden its customer base beyond " politicians , journalists and diplomats " . 
 The Downtown Triangle includes two hotels . Kikar Zion Hotel ( Zion Square Hotel ) , which faces Zion Square from the south , occupies the site of the former Zion Cinema that gave the square its name . The cinema was demolished in 1972 and a high @-@ rise building containing the Kikar Zion Hotel ( on the upper floors ) and a branch of Bank <unk> ( on the lower floors ) was erected . As of 2016 , the hotel is being renovated for reopening as the Herbert Samuel Hotel . On the northern side of Zion Square stands the Jerusalem Hostel . This lodging opened as the Tel Aviv Hotel in 1926 and later became known as the Ron Hotel . Menachem Begin stood on one of the hotel 's balconies on 3 August 1948 , to announce the dissolution of the Irgun and the sign @-@ up of his soldiers with the Israel Defense Forces . 
 = Song of Innocence = 
 Song of Innocence is the debut album of American composer and producer David Axelrod , released in October 1968 by Capitol Records . Axelrod sought to capitalize on the experimental climate of popular music at the time and composed the album as a suite @-@ like tone poem based on Songs of Innocence , a 1789 illustrated collection of poems by William Blake . It was recorded at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles with an orchestra and a variety of studio musicians , including keyboardist and conductor Don Randi , guitarist Al Casey , bassist Carol Kaye , and drummer Earl Palmer . 
 Song of Innocence is an instrumental jazz fusion record that incorporates elements of classical , rock , funk , pop , and theatre music . It is arranged for bass , drums , and string instruments , written in the rock idiom with tempos centered on rock @-@ based patterns by Palmer . Axelrod used contrast in his orchestral compositions and interspersed the album 's euphoric psychedelic R & B form with dramatic , harrowing arrangements to reflect the supernatural themes found in Blake 's poems . The music 's reverent , psychedelic overtones evoke their themes of innocence and spirituality . 
 Although Song of Innocence was innovative for its application of rock and jazz techniques , it was not commercially successful and confounded contemporary critics , who viewed it as an ambitious curiosity piece . In the 1990s , critics reassessed the album as a classic , while leading disc jockeys in hip hop and electronica rediscovered and sampled the album 's music . " Holy Thursday " , the record 's best @-@ known song , was frequently sampled by hip hop producers . The renewed interest in Axelrod 's work prompted Stateside Records to reissue Song of Innocence in 2000 . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1968 , David Axelrod gained national fame for his controversial mass composition Mass in F Minor , which he wrote in a contemporary rock vein for the Electric Prunes . Axelrod , who was challenged by what he described as a " new breed of record buyer ... more sophisticated in his thinking " , was one of several Los Angeles @-@ based musical eccentrics during the late 1960s who expanded on the mid @-@ 1960s studio experiments of Brian Wilson and George Martin . After his success with the Electric Prunes , he was asked to record a similar album by Capitol Records , for whom he worked as a staff producer and songwriter . Axelrod wanted to further capitalize on the experimental climate of popular music at the time and chose to adapt works by English poet William Blake on an album . 
 At the time , Blake musical settings were at the height of their popularity among musicians and composers . Numerous serious music composers had set his poems to music since the 1870s , and the practice was eventually adapted in other musical fields during the 20th century , including popular music , musical theatre , and the 1960s folk idiom . Axelrod , a self @-@ professed " Blake freak " , had been fascinated by Blake 's painting and poetry since his late teens and frequently read the poems as an adult . He conceived Song of Innocence after he had bought an edition of Blake 's complete poetry while working in Capitol 's art department and considered the concept for a few years before Mass in F Minor . Axelrod was not sociable with colleagues , such as record executives who could have helped him professionally , and felt that he could identify with Blake ; he considered the poet " very bad at making new friends " . 
 Axelrod composed Song of Innocence in one week and began recording in mid @-@ 1968 . He recorded the album at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles and enlisted his close @-@ knit group of veteran studio musicians , including keyboardist and conductor Don Randi , guitarist Al Casey , bassist Carol Kaye , and drummer Earl Palmer . He had worked with them when producing sessions for other recording artists . Axelrod did not play any instruments on Song of Innocence ; he instead wrote arrangements for his orchestra and utilized 33 players to perform his notated charts . He had learned how to read and orchestrate complex music charts from jazz musicians during the 1950s . Randi conducted the orchestra and played both piano and organ on the record . Axelrod preferred listening to a session from a recording booth like his contemporary Igor Stravinsky . " That way the sounds don 't seem to go all over the place " , he later said . " Music seems so small in a studio . " Axelrod originally wanted some of the album 's compositions to feature a large @-@ scale choir but was uncertain if he could find the appropriate ensemble , so he recorded an entirely instrumental album and included one Blake setting for each section of the score . 
 = = Composition = = 
 A jazz fusion album , Song of Innocence combines jazz elements with impressionistic musical figures and hard rock guitar solos . Its music also incorporates funk , rock , theatre , and pop styles . Music journalists categorized the record as jazz @-@ rock , baroque pop , and psychedelic R & B. John Murph of JazzTimes magazine said the music could be better characterized as art pop than jazz . Axelrod , who had produced bebop albums before working for Capitol , asserted that jazz played a crucial role in the music : " For years , all I did was jazz . When I first got in the record business , I was so into jazz that I had never heard Elvis Presley . I still probably listen to jazz more than anything else . " 
 Axelrod composed the album as a tone poem suite based on Blake 's illustrated 1789 collection of poems Songs of Innocence . His compositions borrowed titles from Blake 's poems , which dealt with themes such as visions , religious iniquity , rite of passage , and life experience after a person 's birth and innocence . Mary Campbell of The Baltimore Sun said the classical and Christian church music elements made the record sound " reverent , as if describing a biblical story " . Les Inrockuptibles described it as a " psyche @-@ liturgical " work dedicated to Blake . According to AllMusic 's Thom Jurek , psychedelia was implicit in the record 's musical form and feeling , which impelled Axelrod to " celebrate the wildness and folly of youth with celebration and verve " . 
 The album 's music was written in the rock idiom and arranged for bass , drums , and strings . As a composer , Axelrod abandoned the conventional unison approach to orchestral writing in favor of more contrasts while centering his tempos around rock @-@ based drum patterns played mostly in common time by Palmer . He utilized his instrumental ensemble as a rock orchestra , playing melodramatic strings and pronounced , echo @-@ laden breakbeats . The music was also embellished with electric piano , intricate basslines , Echoplex effects , and elements of suspense Axelrod used to reflect the supernatural themes found in Blake 's poems . According to David N. Howard , the album 's " euphorically " upbeat psychedelic R & B form was interspersed by " dramatically sparse " and " harrowing " arrangements . 
 Axelrod and his musicians used key musical phrases that are expanded upon throughout Song of Innocence . He was interested in György Ligeti 's 1961 piece Atmosphères and Lukas Foss ' idea of starting a piece with a sustained chord , having musicians improvise over 100 bars , and ending with another chord as they finish . " Urizen " opened with long sustained chords , sound effects , reverbed guitar stabs , and a supple bassline . On " Holy Thursday " , the rhythm section played a slow , jazzed @-@ out groove and bluesy bop piano lines , as a big band vamp was played by a large @-@ scale string section . In response to their swing style , the brass section and guitarists played dramatic , high @-@ pitched overtones built around a complex melody . The middle of the album featured more traditional jazz passages and the presence of a psychedelic harpsichord . " The Smile " was recorded with a rhythmic drum beat , offbeat bass , and a progressive string part . For the songs near the end , the musicians steadily transitioned to heady psychedelia featuring gritty guitars and disorienting organ licks . On " The Mental Traveler " , Axelrod said he tried to experiment with atonality but " chickened out " .

 Song of Innocence was released in October 1968 by Capitol Records . It received radio exposure on both AM and FM stations with songs such as the title track and " Holy Thursday " , which became the album 's best @-@ known recording . The album was not a commercial success and only sold 75 @,@ 000 copies by October 1969 . Billboard magazine called it " an aesthetic mix of music and philosophy ... chock full of mysticism , creativity , and change " , believing that Axelrod 's idyllic music was interesting enough to impact the record charts . In a review for Gramophone , Alasdair <unk> said Axelrod 's impressions of Blake " reveal a depth of imagination and skill warranting attention beyond the confines of pop music " , proving he could compose innovatively for a large orchestra , which <unk> felt comprised the best of California 's studio musicians on the album . He questioned whether the " occasional guitar gobbling " reflected Axelrod 's genuine ideas or " an obligatory concession to contemporary sound " on an otherwise compelling record . The magazine 's Nigel Hunter found the record 's songs to be " of absorbing power and depth " , but complained of the electric guitar parts . Nat Freedland from Entertainment World was more critical , accusing Axelrod of " indulging himself here to little avail " . Stereo Review magazine 's Paul <unk> panned Song of Innocence as a pretentious , inadequate album dependent on movie music tricks and outdated techniques such as forced climaxes and gaudy orchestration . He said it fell severely short of the concept Axelrod aspired to and that " only the most uneducated will be taken in by the mountains of misterioso claptrap that surround these squeaking musical mice " . 
 Song of Innocence was one of many concept albums recorded as rock music was developing in various directions during the late 1960s , following in the wake of the Beatles ' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . It was innovative for its original application of both rock and jazz techniques . According to music journalist Zaid <unk> , the term " jazz fusion " was coined in a review of the record when it was released . Axelrod followed the album up in 1969 with the similarly Blake @-@ inspired Songs of Experience , which adapted Gunther Schuller 's third stream concept to baroque orchestrations and rock , pop , and R & B rhythms and melodies . Both albums established Axelrod as an unpredictable , challenging conceptual artist . His instrumental interpretations of Blake were the first in jazz , followed in 1971 by Rafał <unk> 's <unk> and Adrian Mitchell 's musical Tyger : A Celebration of William Blake with composer Mike Westbrook ; Westbrook later composed more Blake @-@ inspired works , including The Westbrook Blake : " Bright as Fire " ( 1980 ) . 
 During the late 1990s , Axelrod 's records were reassessed and considered innovative by critics , including Song of Innocence , which was regarded as a classic . Mojo cited it as " the heart of Axelrod 's legacy " , while NME called it " sky @-@ <unk> high and divine " , finding Axelrod versatile enough to " soar above his own pretensions " , Writing for AllMusic , John Bush said the album " sounded like nothing else from its era " , while Thom Jurek argued that it continued to sound new upon each listen due to a lack of " cynicism and hipper @-@ than @-@ thou posturing " in the music . In a four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half star retrospective review , Jurek said it was innovative in 1968 and still " withstands the test of time better than the Beatles Sgt.

Giving it a five @-@ out @-@ of @-@ five score , Tiny Mix Tapes said it sounded engagingly magnificent and diverse , citing it as one of the most dynamic musical fusions and " one of the most unique and thought provoking musical efforts of the last several decades " . 
 Axelrod 's music was also rediscovered and sampled by leading disc jockeys in the 1990s including hip hop producers . When sampling in hip hop peaked during the early and mid @-@ 1990s , they searched for archived records with atmospheric beats and strings to sample . Los Angeles @-@ based disc jockey B + recalled finding a copy of Song of Innocence at a Goodwill in Culver City and said it appealed to him because of its dissonant quality , musical dynamics , and string sound : " This big sound . It was like somehow [ Axelrod ] was summoning the future , that you can project this environment , this moment into the future . " Electronica pioneers such as DJ Cam and DJ Shadow also sampled Song of Innocence . The latter producer sampled the record 's choral themes and piano motifs on his influential debut album Endtroducing ..... ( 1996 ) . " The Smile " was sampled by Pete Rock on his 1998 song " Strange Fruit " and by DJ Premier on Royce da 5 ' 9 " ' s 2009 song " Shake This " . " Holy Thursday " was frequently sampled by producers , including The <unk> on their 1994 song " Hit Me with That " , UNKLE on their 1998 song " Rabbit in Your Headlights " , and Swizz Beatz on Lil Wayne 's 2008 song " Dr. Carter " . 
 The renewed interest in Axelrod 's work prompted Stateside Records to reissue Song of Innocence in 2000 . Now wrote that after sounding odd during the 1960s , the songs had become " a sampler 's dream come true – who knew ? " David Keenan of The Wire attributed Axelrod 's sampling legacy with producers such as DJ Premier and DJ Shadow to Palmer , " the original badass drummer [ who ] played on all of these tracks " . He facetiously critiqued that the album 's songs " may reek of stale joss sticks and patchouli @-@ scented self @-@ <unk> , but in their very datedness they somehow sound very modern . " Pitchfork journalist Sean Fennessey felt Axelrod 's first two records were " essential if only as a tour guide through early 90s hip @-@ hop " , having " literally been a rap producer 's delight for years " . In a 2013 list for Complex , DJ and production duo Kon and Amir named " Holy Thursday " the greatest hip hop sample of all time .

 The Game Gear ( <unk> , <unk> Gia ) is an 8 @-@ bit handheld game console released by Sega on October 6 , 1990 in Japan , 1991 in North America and Europe , and Australia in 1992 . The Game Gear primarily competed with Nintendo 's Game Boy , the Atari Lynx and NEC 's TurboExpress . The handheld shares much of its hardware with the Master System and is able to play its own titles as well as those of the Master System , the latter being made possible by the use of an adapter . Containing a full @-@ color backlit screen with a landscape format , Sega positioned the Game Gear as a technologically superior handheld to the Game Boy . 
 Though the Game Gear was rushed to market , its unique game library and price point gave it an edge over the Atari Lynx and TurboExpress . However , due to issues with its short battery life , lack of original titles , and weak support from Sega , the Game Gear was unable to surpass the Game Boy , selling 10 @.@ 62 million units by March 1996 . The Game Gear was succeeded by the Genesis Nomad in 1995 and discontinued in 1997 . It was re @-@ released as a budget system by Majesco in 2000 , under license by Sega . 
 Reception of the Game Gear was mixed , with praise for its full @-@ color backlit screen and processing power for its time , criticisms over its large size and battery life , and uneven reception over the quality of its game library . 
 = = History = = 
 Developed under the name " Project Mercury " , the Game Gear was first released in Japan on October 6 , 1990 , in North America and Europe in 1991 , and in Australia in 1992 . Originally retailing at JP ¥ 19 @,@ 800 in Japan , US $ 149 @.@ 99 in North America , and GB £ 99 @.@ 99 in Europe , the Game Gear was designed to compete with the Game Boy , which Nintendo had released in 1989 . The console had been designed as a portable version of the Master System , and featured more powerful systems than the Game Boy , including a full @-@ color screen , in contrast to the monochromatic screen of its rival . In order to improve upon the design of their competition , Sega designed the Game Gear with a similar shape to a Genesis controller , with the idea being that the curved surfaces and longer length would make the Game Gear more comfortable to hold than the Game Boy . Despite the similarities the Game Gear shared with the Master System , the games of the latter were not directly playable on the Game Gear , and were only able to be played on the handheld by the use of an accessory called the Master Gear Converter . The original Game Gear pack @-@ in title was Columns , which was similar to the Tetris cartridge that Nintendo had included when it launched the Game Boy . 
 With a late start into the handheld gaming market , Sega rushed to get the Game Gear into stores quickly , having lagged behind Nintendo in sales without a handheld on the market . As one method of doing so , Sega based the hardware of the Game Gear on the Master System , albeit with a much larger color palette than its predecessor : the Game Gear supported 4096 colors , compared to the 64 colors supported by the Master System . Part of the intention of this move was to make Master System games easy to port to the Game Gear . Though the Game Gear was designed to be technologically superior to the Game Boy , its design came at a cost of battery life : whereas the Game Boy could run for more than 30 hours on four AA batteries , the Game Gear required six AA batteries and could only run for three to five hours . With its quick launch in Japan , the handheld sold 40 @,@ 000 units in its first two days , 90 @,@ 000 within a month , and the number of back orders for the system was over 600 @,@ 000 . According to Sega of America marketing director Robert <unk> , " there is clearly a need for a quality portable system that provides features other systems have failed to deliver . This means easy @-@ to @-@ view , full @-@ colour graphics and exciting quality games that appeal to all ages . " 
 = = = Release and marketing = = = 
 Before the Game Gear 's launch in 1990 , Sega had had success marketing its 16 @-@ bit home console , the Genesis , by advertising it as a " more mature " option for gamers . In keeping with this approach , Sega positioned the Game Gear as a " grown @-@ up " option compared to the Game Boy . While Sega 's marketing in Japan did not take this perspective , instead opting for advertisements with Japanese women featuring the handheld , Sega 's worldwide advertising prominently positioned the Game Gear as the " cooler " console than the Game Boy . 
 In North America , marketing for the Game Gear included side @-@ by @-@ side comparisons of Sega 's new handheld with the Game Boy , and likened Game Boy players to the obese and uneducated . One Sega advertisement featured the quote , " If you were color blind and had an IQ of less than 12 , then you wouldn 't mind which portable you had . " Such advertising drew fire from Nintendo , who sought to have protests organized against Sega for insulting disabled persons . Sega responded with a statement from Sega of America president Tom Kalinske saying that Nintendo " should spend more time improving their products and marketing rather than working on behind @-@ the @-@ scenes coercive activities . " Ultimately , this debate would have little impact on sales for the Game Gear . 
 Europe and Australia were the last regions to receive the Game Gear . Due to the delays in receiving the new handheld , some importers paid as much as £ 200 in order to have the new system . Upon the Game Gear 's release in Europe , video game distributor Virgin Mastertronic unveiled the price of the Game Gear as £ 99 @.@ 99 , positioning it as being more expensive than the Game Boy , but less expensive than the Atari Lynx , which was also a full @-@ color system . Marketing in the United Kingdom included the use of the slogan , " To be this good takes Sega " , and also included advertisements with a biker with a Game Gear .

 Support for the Game Gear by Sega was drastically hurt by its focus on its home console systems . In addition to the success of the Genesis , Sega was also supporting two peripherals for its home system , the Sega CD and the 32X , as well as developing its new 32 @-@ bit system , the Sega Saturn . Despite selling 10 @.@ 62 million units by March 1996 , the Game Gear was never able to match the success of its main rival , the Game Boy , which sold over ten times that number . The system 's late sales were further hurt by Nintendo 's release of the Game Boy Pocket , a smaller version of the Game Boy which could run on two AAA batteries . 
 Plans for a 16 @-@ bit successor to the Game Gear were made to bring Sega 's handheld gaming into the fifth generation of video games , but a new handheld system never materialized for Sega , leaving only the Genesis Nomad , a portable version of the Genesis , to take its place . Though the Nomad had been released in 1995 , Sega did not officially end support for the Game Gear until 1996 in Japan , and 1997 worldwide . 
 Though the system was no longer supported by Sega in 2000 , third @-@ party developer Majesco released a version of the Game Gear at US $ 30 , with games retailing at US $ 15 . New games were released , such as a port of Super <unk> . This version was also compatible with all previous Game Gear games , but was incompatible with the TV Tuner and some Master System converters . Over ten years later , on March 2 , 2011 , Nintendo announced that their 3DS Virtual Console service on the Nintendo eShop would feature games from Game Gear . 
 = = Technical specifications = = 
 A handheld game console , the Game Gear was designed to be played while being held horizontally . The console contains an 8 @-@ bit <unk> Zilog Z80 chip for a central processing unit , the same as the Master System . Its screen was 3 @.@ 2 square inches in size , and is able to display up to 32 colors at a time from a total palette of 4096 colors , at a display resolution of 160 x 144 pixels , . The screen is backlit in order to allow gamers to play in low @-@ lighting situations . Powered by 6 AA batteries , the Game Gear has an approximate battery life of 3 to 5 hours . In order to lengthen this duration and to save money for consumers , Sega also released two types of external rechargeable battery packs for the Game Gear . The system contains <unk> of RAM and an additional <unk> of video RAM . Audio is supplied by the Texas Instruments SN76489 PSG , which was also used in the Master System . However , unlike the Master System , stereo sound is able to be supplied through an output for headphones . Physically , the Game Gear measures <unk> across , <unk> high , and 37mm deep . 
 Several accessories were created for the Game Gear during its lifespan . A TV Tuner accessory plugged into the system 's cartridge slot , and allowed one to watch TV on the Game Gear 's screen . Released at $ 105 @.@ 88 ( $ 186 in 2016 ) , the add @-@ on was expensive but unique for collectors and contributed to the system 's popularity . Another accessory , the " Super Wide Gear " , was an accessory that magnified the Game Gear screen to compensate for its relatively small size . Also released was an adaptor ( known as the Game Gear Car Adaptor ) that plugged into cars or cigarette lighters to power the system while traveling , and the " Gear @-@ to @-@ Gear Cable " , an accessory that established a data connection between two Game Gear systems using the same multiplayer game and let users play against each other . 
 Over the course of its lifespan , the Game Gear also received a number of variations . Later releases included several different colors for the console , including a blue " sports " variation released in North America bundled with World Series Baseball ' 95 or The Lion King . A white version was also released , sold in a bundle with a TV tuner . Other versions included a red Coca @-@ Cola themed unit , bundled with the game Coca @-@ Cola Kid , and the Kids Gear , a Japan @-@ only variation targeted toward children . 
 = = Game library = = 
 Over 300 games were released for the Game Gear , although at the time of the console 's launch , there were only six software titles available . Prices for game cartridges initially ranged from $ 24 @.@ 99 to $ 29 @.@ 99 each . The casings were molded black plastic with a rounded front to aid in removal . Some titles for the system included Sonic the Hedgehog , The GG Shinobi , Space Harrier , and Land of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse , which was considered the best game for the system by GamesRadar . Later titles took advantage of the success of the Genesis , Sega 's 16 @-@ bit video game console , with games released from franchises originally released on the Genesis . A large part of the Game Gear 's library consists of Master System ports . Because of the landscape orientation of the Game Gear 's screen and the similarities in hardware between the handheld console and the Master System , it was easy for developers to port Master System games to the Game Gear . 
 Due to Nintendo 's licensing practices during the lifespan of the Game Gear , few third @-@ party developers were available to create games for Sega 's system . This was a contributing factor to the large number of Master System ports for the Game Gear . Likewise , because of this , the Game Gear library contained many games that were not available on other handhelds , pulling sales away from the Atari Lynx and NEC TurboExpress and helping to establish the Game Gear 's position in the market . While the Game Gear 's library consisted of over 300 titles , however , the Game Boy 's library contained over 1000 individual games . 
 Several Game Gear titles were released on the Nintendo 3DS 's Virtual Console service on the Nintendo eShop . The emulator for the Virtual Console releases was handled by M2 .

 Game Gear surpassed the Atari Lynx and NEC TurboExpress , but lagged far behind the Game Boy in the handheld marketplace . Retrospective reception to the Game Gear is mixed . In 2008 , GamePro listed the Game Gear as 10th on their list of the " 10 Worst @-@ Selling Handhelds of All Time " and criticized aspects of the implementation of its technology , but also stated that the Game Gear could be considered a success for having nearly 11 million units sold . According to GamePro reviewer Blake Snow , " Unlike the Game Boy , the Game Gear rocked the landscape holding position , making it less cramped for human beings with two hands to hold . And even though the Game Gear could be considered a success , its bulky frame , relative high price , constant consumption of AA batteries , and a lack of appealing games ultimately kept Sega from releasing a true successor . " 
 GamesRadar offered some praise for the system and its library , stating , " With its 8 @-@ bit processor and bright color screen , it was basically the Sega Master System in your hands . How many batteries did we suck dry playing Sonic , Madden and Road Rash on the bus or in the car , or in the dark when we were supposed to be sleeping ? You couldn 't do that on a Game Boy ! " By contrast , IGN reviewer Levi Buchanan noted the Game Gear 's biggest fault was its game library when compared to the Game Boy , stating that " the software was completely lacking compared to its chief rival , which was bathed in quality games . It didn 't matter that the Game Gear was more powerful . The color screen did not reverse any fortunes . Content and innovation beat out technology , a formula that Nintendo is using right now with the continued ascendance of the DS and Wii . " Buchanan later went on to praise some parts of the Game Gear 's library , however , stating " Some of those Master System tweaks were very good games , and fun is resilient against time . " Retro Gamer praised Sega 's accomplishment in surviving against the competition of Nintendo in the handheld console market with the Game Gear , noting that " for all the handhelds that have gone up against the might of Nintendo and ultimately lost out , Sega 's Game Gear managed to last the longest , only outdone in sales by the Sony PSP . For its fans , it will remain a piece of classic gaming hardware whose legacy lives on forever . " 
 = British Cypriots = 
 The British Cypriot community in the United Kingdom consists of British people born on , or with ancestors from , the Eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus . British Cypriot people may be of Greek- , <unk> , <unk> , or Armenian @-@ Cypriot descent . 
 Migration from Cyprus to the UK has occurred in part due to the colonial links between the countries and the internal conflict that followed Cyprus ' independence from the British Empire in 1960 . Migration peaked at the time of independence but has continued on a smaller scale . The number of Cypriot @-@ born people in the UK fell between the 1991 and 2001 censuses , but the community , including people of Cypriot ancestry , remains sizeable , and the Cypriot @-@ born population grew slightly between the 2001 and 2011 censuses . A number of famous British people are of Cypriot ancestry , including musicians George Michael and Cat Stevens , footballer Leon Osman , artist Panayiotis <unk> , visual artist Tracey Emin , and politician Lord Adonis . Migration between the UK and Cyprus is currently open and free , as both countries are members of the European Union at this point in time . 
 = = History = = 
 Before the First World War , very few Cypriots migrated to the UK and the British Cypriot population at this time was around 150 , according to historian Stavros <unk> . Only a handful of marriages involving Cypriots are recorded at London 's Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sophia in the years before 1918 . During the First World War many Cypriots joined the allied forces . When the British annexed Cyprus in 1914 , Cypriots ' political status changed and they found it easier to travel . 
 The 1931 British Census recorded more than 1 @,@ 000 Cypriot @-@ born people , but many of these were the children of British military personnel serving in the Mediterranean . However , some Greek Cypriots did migrate to the UK in the 1920s and 1930s , often finding jobs in the catering industry in Soho . By the start of the Second World War , there were around 8 @,@ 000 Cypriots in London . More Cypriot immigrants arrived during the National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters ( EOKA ) ' s campaign for Cypriot independence from Britain and union with Greece , which started in 1955 . In the four years of conflict , an average of 4 @,@ 000 Cypriots left the island per year for the UK , because of violence on the island and the fear felt by both Greek and Turkish Cypriots in mixed villages where they formed minorities . Migration peaked following independence in 1960 , with around 25 @,@ 000 Cypriots migrating in the year that followed . Many migrants joined family already living in Britain . Further migration accompanied the Turkish invasion of the island in 1974 . Home Office figures show that roughly 10 @,@ 000 Cypriots fled to the UK , the majority of them refugees , but many of them subsequently returned to the island . 
 In the 1960s , Greek Cypriots in London outnumbered Turkish Cypriots by four to one . The increase in post @-@ war rents in central London had forced many Cypriot immigrants to move north within the city . The Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities tended to be geographically segregated , with Greeks settling mainly in Camden and Turks in Stoke Newington . This was due to the migrants ' reliance on social networks to find housing on their arrival . Robert Winder reports that " Haringey became the second biggest Cypriot town in the world " . Many Cypriots set up restaurants , filling a gap left by Italians , many of whom had been interned during the Second World War . 
 Much of the Turkish Cypriot migration to the UK occurred as a consequence of intercommunal violence in Cyprus during the 1950s and 1960s . Many Turkish Cypriots viewed the EOKA insurgency as an attempt on the part of Greek Cypriots to establish hegemony on the island with the aim of achieving union with Greece . By 1958 , there were around 8 @,@ 500 Turkish Cypriots in Britain . Between 1960 and 1962 , the inflow increased substantially because of a fear that Britain would impose immigration controls , and indeed the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 did reduce migration flows from Cyprus to Britain . Although the expansion of Britain 's Turkish Cypriot community took place primarily between the late 1940s and the mid @-@ 1960s , there was a further influx of around 3 @,@ 000 immigrants after partition in 1974 . Migration continued because of the political and economic situation in the 1970s and 1980s , and Turkish Cypriots have continued to migrate to the UK due to high unemployment rates in northern Cyprus . In the early 1980s , it was estimated that 160 @,@ 000 Cypriots were resident in the UK , 20 to 25 per cent of them being Turkish Cypriots . Since Cyprus joined the European Union in May 2004 , holders of Republic of Cyprus passports have been able to migrate freely to the UK under EU law . 
 According to the BBC , while divisions and resentment exist between Greek and Turkish Cypriots in the UK , particularly amongst those old enough to remember atrocities committed in Cyprus , " if differences of opinion exist , both sides have learnt to live together regardless " . Community relations are generally good , with Turkish Cypriot community centres welcoming Greek Cypriots and vice versa . In oral history interviews conducted by academic <unk> Canefe in the late 1990s , Turkish Cypriots in London tended to define themselves as Anglo @-@ Cypriot , particularly if they were born in the UK . Canefe notes that her interviewees were proud to be Cypriot , but also of being British and not Turkish . They had Turkish friends , but also close Greek and Greek Cypriot friends . The neighbourhoods they inhabited tended to be ethnically mixed , and often shared with Greeks and Greek Cypriots .

 = Battle of Bathys Ryax = 
 The Battle of Bathys Ryax was fought in 872 or 878 between the Byzantine Empire and the Paulicians . The Paulicians were a Christian sect which — persecuted by the Byzantine state — had established a separate principality at Tephrike on Byzantium 's eastern border and collaborated with the Muslim emirates of the Thughur , the Abbasid Caliphate 's borderlands , against the Empire . The battle was a decisive Byzantine victory , resulting in the rout of the Paulician army and the death of its leader , Chrysocheir . This event destroyed the power of the Paulician state and removed a major threat to Byzantium , heralding the fall of Tephrike itself and the annexation of the Paulician principality shortly after . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Paulicians were a Christian sect whose precise origins and beliefs are somewhat obscure : Byzantine sources portray them as dualists , while Armenian sources maintain that they were an <unk> sect . The Paulicians were fiercely iconoclastic , adhered to a very distinct Christology and rejected the authority and practices of the official Byzantine Church , following their own leaders . Consequently , they were persecuted by the Byzantine state as early as 813 , despite the emperors ' official support for iconoclasm . After the definitive end of Byzantine Iconoclasm in 843 , that persecution was intensified : in an attempt , unique in Byzantine history , to eradicate an entire " heretical " sect , orders were sent out to kill anyone who would not recant . According to the chroniclers , up to 100 @,@ 000 Paulicians were massacred , while the remnants fled from their strongholds in east @-@ central Anatolia , and found refuge among the Empire 's Muslim enemies , the Arab emirates of the Thughur , the Arab – Byzantine frontier zone along the Taurus – Antitaurus mountain ranges . With support from the emir of Melitene , Umar al @-@ Aqta , the Paulician leader Karbeas founded a separate principality at Tephrike , and for the next decades , the Paulicians campaigned alongside the Arabs against Byzantium . 
 The Arabs and Paulicians suffered a critical blow in 863 with the defeat and death of Umar at the Battle of Lalakaon and the death of Karbeas in the same year , but under their new leader , Chrysocheir , the Paulicians resumed their raids deep into Byzantine Anatolia , raiding as far as Nicaea and sacking Ephesus in 869 / 970 . The new Byzantine emperor , Basil I the Macedonian ( r . 867 – 886 ) , sent an embassy for negotiations to Tephrike . After the talks failed , Basil led a campaign against the Paulician state in the spring of 871 , but was defeated and only narrowly managed to escape himself . 
 = = Battle = = 
 Encouraged by this success , Chrysocheir then staged another deep raid into Anatolia , reaching Ancyra and ravaging southern Galatia . Basil reacted by sending his relative , the Domestic of the Schools Christopher , against them . The Paulicians managed to avoid a clash , and as the campaigning season drew to a close , they began retiring towards their own territory . They encamped at <unk> ( modern <unk> <unk> ) in the theme of Charsianon , with the shadowing Byzantine army making their camp at nearby <unk> ( <unk> , modern <unk> ) to the west . From there , the Paulicians marched northeast to the pass of Bathys Ryax or <unk> ( <unk> , " Deep Stream " , modern <unk> pass west of Sivas in Turkey ) , a location of strategic importance , as indicated by the fact that it served as a fortified assembly point ( <unk> ) for Byzantine expeditions to the East . Christopher sent the strategoi of the themes of <unk> and Charsianon ahead with some four to five thousand men , to make contact with the Paulician army , shadow it as far as the pass and report on its intentions , i.e. whether it intended to double back westwards to resume raiding Byzantine territory or whether it headed back to Tephrike , in which case they would have to rejoin the Domestic 's forces . 
 When the two generals with their men reached the pass , night had fallen , and the Paulicians , apparently unaware that they were being followed , had made camp in the valley of the pass . The Byzantines took up position in a wooded hill called <unk> that overlooked the Paulician encampment , which further concealed them from their enemy . At this point , the sources record that a dispute broke out between the men of the two thematic corps as to who was the bravest ; the two generals decided to take advantage of their troops ' high morale and impetuousness to attack , despite their orders . A picked detachment of 600 men from both divisions launched a surprise attack at dawn , while the rest of the army remained behind and made loud clamour with trumpets and drums , so as to suggest the imminent arrival of the entire Byzantine field army under Christopher . The ruse worked perfectly : the Paulicians , taken by surprise , panicked and dispersed without offering any serious resistance . The Paulician rout was completed as they fell upon the main Byzantine army while fleeing . Their remnants were pursued by the victorious Byzantines up to a distance of 50 km . Chrysocheir himself managed to escape with a small detachment of bodyguards , but he was brought at bay at <unk> <unk> ( probably modern <unk> <unk> ) . In the ensuing engagement , he was wounded by <unk> , a Byzantine soldier who had been formerly a captive of the Paulicians , and fell from his horse . He was then captured and beheaded by the advancing Byzantines , and his head was sent to Emperor Basil in Constantinople . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The defeat at Bathys Ryax signalled the end of the Paulicians as a military power and a threat to Byzantium . Basil followed this success by a series of campaigns in the East against the Paulician strongholds and the Arab emirates . Tephrike itself was taken in 878 and razed to the ground . The remaining Paulicians were resettled in the Balkans , while a large contingent was shipped off to Southern Italy to fight for the Empire under Nikephoros Phokas the Elder . 
 = = Questions of chronology = = 
 The chronology and sequence of events regarding the battle and the fall of the Paulician state is unclear , since the Byzantine sources are contradictory : a number of scholars place the battle in 872 , others in 878 , in both cases either before or after the capture and razing of Tephrike itself by the Byzantines . Thus Alexander Vasiliev proposed a first victorious battle for the Byzantines , followed by the sack of Tephrike and the final Paulician defeat at Bathys Ryax , all in 872 . Most recent historians place the battle before the sack of the city , but disagree in the dates of the two events . Some , like Nina <unk> or John Haldon , place both events in 878 ; the French Byzantinist Paul Lemerle , followed by other scholars like Mark Whittow and Warren Treadgold , placed the battle in 872 and the final subjugation of Tephrike years later , in 878 ( Treadgold in 879 ) .

 Alan Partridge was created for the 1991 BBC Radio 4 comedy programme On The Hour , a spoof of British current affairs broadcasting , as the show 's hapless sports presenter , portrayed by Steve Coogan . The show 's writers Armando Iannucci , Patrick Marber , Richard Herring and Stewart Lee wrote much of Partridge 's original material , although Herring credits the creation to Coogan and Iannucci . Iannucci asked Coogan to do a voice for a generic sports reporter ; according to Iannucci , " Someone said , ' He 's an Alan ! ' and someone else said , ' He 's a Partridge ! ' Within minutes we knew where he lived , we 'd worked out his back story , what his aspirations were . " Coogan said Partridge was originally a " one @-@ note , sketchy character " and " freak show " , but became " more and more refined as sort of a dysfunctional alter ego " over the years . He had performed a similar character for a BBC college radio station at university . 
 Following On the Hour , Partridge presented six episodes of a spoof Radio 4 chat show , Knowing Me , Knowing You with Alan Partridge , first broadcast on 1 December 1992 . The series saw Partridge annoy and offend his guests , and coined the character 's catchphrase , " Aha ! " In 1993 , On the Hour transferred to television as The Day Today , in which Partridge reprised his role as sports reporter . In 1994 , Knowing Me , Knowing You transferred to television ; the series ends with Partridge accidentally shooting a guest and attacking a BBC commissioning editor , ending his television career . It was nominated for the 1995 BAFTA for Light Entertainment Performance . A Christmas special , Knowing Me , Knowing Yule , was broadcast in December 1995 .

 In 1997 , Coogan starred in a sitcom , I 'm Alan Partridge , written by Coogan , Iannucci and Peter Baynham . The sitcom follows Partridge after he has been left by his wife and dropped from the BBC ; he lives in a roadside hotel , presents a graveyard slot on local Norwich radio , and desperately pitches ideas for new television shows . Iannucci said the writers used the sitcom as " a kind of social X @-@ ray of male middle @-@ aged Middle England . " It won the 1998 BAFTA awards for Comedy Performance and Comedy Programme or Series . 
 In 1999 , Partridge appeared on the BBC telethon Children in Need , performing a medley of Kate Bush songs . The BBC broadcast a second series of I 'm Alan Partridge in 2002 , following Partridge 's life in a static caravan with his new Ukrainian girlfriend after recovering from a mental breakdown . In March 2003 , the BBC broadcast a mockumentary , Anglian Lives : Alan Partridge , about Partridge 's life and career . In 2008 , Coogan performed a tour titled " Steve Coogan as Alan Partridge and other Less Successful Characters " , featuring Partridge as a life coach .

 After a hiatus , Partridge returned in 2010 in a series of YouTube shorts , Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge , as the host of a digital radio show with co @-@ presenter Sidekick Simon ( Tim Key ) . Coogan co @-@ wrote the shorts with brothers Neil and Rob Gibbons , who submitted scripts to his company Baby Cow Productions ; the brothers have co @-@ written every Partridge project since . According to Neil , Coogan " invited us in , our sensibilities chimed , and before we knew it , Mid Morning Matters was up and running . We wrote it as if it was our baby , and though there was a sense that we were standing on the shoulders of giants , I think we were like two pairs of fresh eyes , and Steve seemed to fall in love with the character all over again . " Coogan said they chose the web format because " it was a bit underground , a low @-@ key environment in which to test the character out again . And the response was so good , we realised there was more fuel in the tank . " The shorts were later broadcast by Sky Atlantic . 
 In 2011 , a spoof autobiography , I , Partridge : We Need to Talk About Alan , written by Coogan , Iannucci and the Gibbons brothers , was published in the UK . An audiobook version recorded by Coogan as Partridge was released on CD and downloadable audio formats .

 On 25 June 2012 , Partridge presented a one @-@ hour Sky special , Alan Partridge : Welcome to the Places of My Life , taking the viewer on a tour of Partridge 's home county Norfolk , for which Coogan won the 2013 BAFTA for Best Male Performance in a Comedy Programme . It was followed the next week by Open Books with Martin Bryce , a mock literary programme discussing Partridge 's autobiography . 
 On 7 August 2013 , a feature film , Alan Partridge : Alpha Papa , written by Coogan , Iannucci , Baynham and the Gibbons brothers , was released in the UK .

 Alan Partridge is an incompetent and tactless television and radio presenter from Norwich , England . He is socially inept , often offending his guests , and has an inflated sense of importance and celebrity . According to the Telegraph , Partridge is " utterly convinced of his own superiority , and bewildered by the world 's inability to recognise it – qualities that placed him in the line of comedy lineage that runs directly from Hancock , Captain Mainwaring , and Basil Fawlty . " His need for public attention drives him to deceit , treachery and shameless self @-@ promotion , and sometimes violence ; in the Knowing Me , Knowing Yule Christmas special , for example , he assaults a BBC boss and a paralysed former golfer . 
 Partridge holds right @-@ wing views ; Coogan described him as a Little Englander , with a " myopic , slightly philistine mentality " . Earlier versions of the character were more bigoted , but the writers later found there was more humour in having him attempt to be liberal . Coogan said : " He 's aware of political correctness but he 's playing catch @-@ up . In the same way that the Daily Mail is a bit PC – it wouldn 't be openly homophobic now – Alan is the same . He tries to be modern . " 
 According to Forbes , Partridge has " parochial bad taste " , and Coogan described him as " on the wrong side of cool " . He is a fan of the Daily Mail newspaper , James Bond films and Lexus cars . His music taste includes Wings and Abba , naming his son Fernando and his talk show Knowing Me , Knowing You after Abba songs ; Partridge 's catchphrase , " Aha ! " , also comes from Abba . In earlier incarnations , Partridge 's wardrobe includes a blazer , badge and tie , driving gloves , and " too @-@ short " shorts , styles he describes as " sports casual " and " imperial leisure " . According to Iannucci , by the time of Alpha Papa his wardrobe had " evolved to the Top Gear Presenter Circa 2005 stage " , with sports jackets and a " borderline @-@ foppish " fringe . As Coogan aged , the ageing make @-@ up he wore in earlier performances became unnecessary . 
 Guardian critic Alexis Petridis wrote that " one of the reasons audiences find [ Partridge ] funny is that they recognise at least a bit of themselves in him . " Baynham told the Guardian that " despite the fact that people say he 's awful , a lot of the time we were trying to build empathy : you 're watching a man suffer but also at some level identifying with his pain . " Felicity Montagu , who plays Partridge 's assistant Lynn , felt he was a good person " deep down " and actually " vulnerable and lovable " . Iannucci said that Partridge stays optimistic because he never sees himself as others see him , and that despite his failings was " the perfect broadcaster for these times , when there are 24 hours to fill and dead time is a crime – he has a unique capacity to fill any vacuum with his own verbal vacuum . " Rob and Neil Gibbons felt that by the time of Mid Morning Matters , when Partridge is working for an even smaller radio station , he was more at peace with himself and that his lack of self @-@ awareness saved him from misery .

 Vanity Fair described Alan Partridge as " a national treasure ... a part of British comedy heritage as John Cleese 's Basil Fawlty and Rowan Atkinson 's Mr. Bean . " According to Variety , in Britain " Alan Partridge is a full @-@ on phenomenon , a multiplatform fictional celebrity whose catchphrases , mangled metaphors and social ineptitude are the stuff of legend and good ratings . " The character is less well known outside the UK , but according to Anchorman director Adam McKay , " every American comic knows who Steve is , whether it 's Stiller or Ferrell or Jack Black or me ... and everyone watching those [ Partridge ] DVDs had the same reaction . How did I not know about this guy ? " Indiewire wrote that " few Americans may know , but Partridge is a something of a comic icon across the pond ... Before there was Ron Burgundy for the Yanks , there was Alan Partridge for the Brits . " 
 Brian Logan wrote in the Guardian that though Partridge was created as a satire of the " asinine fluency of broadcaster @-@ speak " of the time , his study of character traits gave the character a timeless quality . Guardian writer John Crace wrote : " By rights , Alan Partridge should have been dead as a character years ago , the last drops of humour long since wrung out ... but Steve Coogan keeps finding ways to make him feel fresh . " Reviewing Alpha Papa in 2013 , the Independent wrote that Partridge is a " disarming creation " and that despite his flaws " we always root for him . " 
 The entertainment news site Mandatory said Partridge was " a fascinatingly layered and fully realized creation of years of storytelling and a fundamentally contemptible prick — he feels like a living , breathing person , but a living , breathing person that you want to strangle . " The Telegraph credited Partridge with influencing " awkward " sitcoms such as The Inbetweeners , <unk> Night and Peep Show , and wrote : " Never has one actor so completely inhabited a sitcom character . We believe Partridge is real , from his side @-@ parted hair down to his <unk> sports @-@ casual loafers . " In 2014 , Guardian writer Stuart Heritage described Partridge as " one of the greatest and most beloved comic creations of the last few decades . " 
 According to Den of Geek , Alan Partridge has so influenced British culture that " <unk> " have become part of everyday vernacular . " Monkey Tennis " , one of Partridge 's desperate television proposals , has become shorthand for absurd television concepts . Another , " Youth <unk> with Chris Eubank " , was used by the hostel booking site <unk> as the basis of a 2015 television advert with boxer Chris Eubank . " Accidental Partridge " , an unofficial Twitter account which collects quotes reminiscent of Partridge 's speech from real media figures , had attracted 144 @,@ 000 followers by May 2014 . In July 2015 , an art exhibition inspired by the character opened in Norwich .

 = Allemand 's expedition of 1805 = 
 Allemand 's expedition of 1805 , often referred to as the Escadre invisible ( invisible squadron ) in French sources , was an important French naval expedition during the Napoleonic Wars , which formed a major diversion to the ongoing Trafalgar Campaign in the Atlantic Ocean . With the French Mediterranean Fleet at sea , Emperor Napoleon I hoped to unite it with the French Atlantic Fleet and together form a force powerful enough to temporarily displace the British Royal Navy Channel Fleet for long enough to allow an invasion force to cross the English Channel and land in Britain . In support of this plan , the French squadron based at Rochefort put to sea in July 1805 , initially with the intention that they would join the Atlantic Fleet from Brest . When this fleet failed to put to sea , the Rochefort squadron , under Contre @-@ Admiral Zacharie Allemand , went on an extended raiding cruise across the Atlantic , both to intercept British trade left lightly defended by the concentration of British forces in European waters and with the intention of eventually combining with the French Mediterranean Fleet then blockaded in Spanish harbours . 
 On 25 September , Allemand achieved a major success when his squadron , while waiting for a convoy from the Leeward Islands , encountered a seven ship convoy from the island of Saint Helena . The convoy 's commander , Captain Daniel Woodriff in the fourth rate HMS Calcutta , sought to interpose his ship between the French squadron and his convoy and was captured after a fierce battle . All except one of convoy escaped , and by deliberately drawing the French away from his own convoy 's direction , he had saved the <unk> Islands convoy from attack as well . After the battle , Allemand was forced to conduct repairs at Tenerife , sailing again on 17 October , four days before the French Mediterranean Fleet was destroyed at the Battle of Trafalgar . With the planned invasion impossible , Allemand began commerce raiding in the Eastern Atlantic , capturing 43 merchant ships during his cruise and successfully disrupting the British blockade of Cadiz . This had an unintended but significant effect on the Atlantic campaign of 1806 , resulting eventually in the Battle of San Domingo in February 1806 . Allemand returned to Rochefort on 23 December , having not lost a single ship during the expedition . 
 = = Trafalgar campaign = = 
 In March 1805 , the French Mediterranean Fleet sailed from Toulon under Vice @-@ Admiral Pierre @-@ Charles Villeneuve for an extended cruise to the West Indies , ultimately under orders to link with the French Atlantic Fleet based at Brest . Together these fleets would stage a major operation in the English Channel , driving off the Royal Navy Channel Fleet and allowing a fleet of landing barges to land on the southern coast of England as the first move in an invasion of Britain . Arriving at Martinique on 14 May , Villeneuve waited for reinforcements from the Atlantic fleet , only to be informed on 2 June that they had failed to leave port . Despite repeated orders issued to the Atlantic fleet instructing them to sail to Martinique , Vice @-@ Admiral Honoré Ganteaume had failed in his one effort to break out of Brest during March and then given up . His entire fleet ultimately remained in port throughout the campaign . On 7 June Villeneuve learned of the arrival in the Caribbean of the British Mediterranean Fleet under Vice @-@ Admiral Lord Nelson and hastily sailed back to Europe , eventually sheltering in the Spanish harbour of Vigo after an encounter on 22 July with a British fleet under Sir Robert Calder at the Battle of Cape Finisterre , in which two of his ships were captured . In the aftermath of the spring campaign , both Nelson and Calder returned to Britain , leaving only relatively small squadrons off the French and Spanish coasts . 
 Despite delays to his plan , Napoleon had pressed ahead with preparations for the Channel campaign : an army of 200 @,@ 000 men was assembling at Boulogne for the invasion , and orders continued to insist that the fleets under Villeneuve and Ganteaume put to sea . Also ordered to sail was the squadron based at the Atlantic port of Rochefort , led by Contre @-@ Admiral Zacharie Allemand . Allemand 's squadron consisted of the powerful 120 @-@ gun ship <unk> , three other ships of the line and several frigates and brigs , forming a significant force in its own right and a valuable addition to any battle fleet . Allemand was ordered to cruise off the southern coast of Cornwall , awaiting the combined fleets of Villeneuve and Ganteaume and their descent into the Channel . If this force did not materialise , Allemand was subsequently ordered to the Bay of Biscay to join up with Villeneuve on his route northwards and should this too fail then he was to conduct an extended commerce raiding operation in the Atlantic to take advantage of the concentration of British forces off Europe and the consequent exposure of British trade . 
 = = = Bay of Biscay = = = 
 Allemand sailed from Rochefort on 16 July while the blockade squadron under Rear @-@ Admiral Charles Stirling was out of position , rapidly escaping the coast into the Atlantic . On 17 July , the squadron outran and captured the British brig HMS Ranger , rated as 18 guns but actually carrying 24 . Ranger 's crew had observed the approaching French squadron from some distance , and Commander Charles Coote had ordered that once their capture was inevitable , the crew were to cause as much damage as possible to their vessel to deny its use to the French . So successful were these efforts that Allemand was forced to burn Ranger once her crew had been removed as prisoners of war . Allemand subsequently reached his first station , off The Lizard , the day after capturing Ranger . There he waited in vain for the fleet under Ganteaume , which had never departed Brest . Following his instructions , Allemand then sailed for the Bay of Biscay , where he was to meet the fleet under Villeneuve that had been ordered north to join with Ganteaume . He passed southwards during July and was in the region of Cape Finisterre on 22 July : later records show that he was close enough to the site of the Battle of Cape Finisterre to have participated in the engagement if he had been aware that it was underway . News of Allemand 's presence reached Villeneuve early in August and on 5 August he despatched the frigate HMS Didon in search of the Rochefort squadron . Didon was followed on 9 August by the main fleet , including 29 ships of the line and associated frigates and corvettes . Villeneuve passed up the Spanish coast , anchoring off the village of <unk> , near Ferrol , on 10 August and departing the following day in a west by northwest direction . On 13 August the fleet was spotted by the frigates HMS Iris under Captain Edward Brace and HMS Naiad under Captain Thomas Dundas , who were forced to flee a French detachment sent in pursuit , losing sight of the enemy on 14 August as Villeneuve 's main force continued to the northwest . 
 While Villeneuve was searching for Allemand , the Rochefort squadron was passing south along the Spanish coast in search of Villeneuve , anchoring at Vigo on 16 August without having seen any sign of the combined fleet . Villeneuve had not left instructions at Vigo for the Rochefort squadron and Allemand was uncertain where his superior was intending to sail to . One of Villeneuve 's scouting frigates meanwhile had spoken with a Danish ship that reported a fleet of 25 British ships of the line actively searching the region for the combined fleet . When on the evening of 14 August Villeneuve 's scouts sighted the ship of the line HMS Dragon under Captain Edward Griffiths , the frigate HMS Phoenix and the captured Didon to the west , the French admiral assumed they were an advance guard of this British fleet and turned away to the south , the impression encouraged by frantic signals raised by Dragon . In fact , these ships were the only British forces in the region . The Danish ship had been boarded by Dragon earlier in the day and her crew deliberately fed misinformation about British strength . When the French scouts sighted Dragon , the presence of the captured Didon and Captain Griffiths ' signals , that were made to an expanse of empty sea beyond the visible horizon on the French ship , successfully misled the French admiral into fleeing a non @-@ existent fleet . 
 Bypassing Vigo on his flight southwards , Villeneuve put into the Southern Spanish fleet base of Cadiz on 20 August . By abandoning his efforts to reach the English Channel , Villeneuve was in effect abandoning the entire invasion strategy and , when news of Villeneuve 's retreat reached him , Napoleon decided to formally abandon the campaign , marching the army at Boulogne south to the Austrian border . Without instructions from his superior , and with no idea where the main French fleet was , Allemand spent much of August off the Spanish coast before deciding to turn to the third aspect of his orders , the disruption of British trade . 
 = = The Calcutta convoy = = 
 The threat posed by the fleets in Brest and Cadiz was stretching the Royal Navy , and convoy escorts were weaker than usual as so many vessels had been diverted to the blockade fleets needed to watch French and Spanish movements . As a result , there were a number of independently sailing merchant ships in the Bay of Biscay and Allemand encountered and captured three on his journey north into the area later known as the Western Approaches . From the prisoners taken out of these ships , the French admiral learned that a large convoy was due from the West Indies , protected only by a single ship of the line , HMS Illustrious . This rich prize would be a major success for Allemand and his squadron cruised the Western Approaches in anticipation of its arrival during September 1805 . 
 At 12 : 00 on 25 September at 49 ° 30 ′ N 09 ° 00 ′ W , Armide , an outlying frigate from Allemand 's squadron , spotted sails to the southeast . Closing to investigate , these sails were identified as a small British convoy , not the expected force under Illustrious but another convoy from Saint Helena , consisting of the East Indiaman Indus , two whalers , three small merchant ships , the slow merchant vessel Brothers and the 50 @-@ gun fourth rate ship HMS Calcutta . The convoy had departed Saint Helena with seven ships on 3 August , and made fast time northwards until 14 September when it was joined by Brothers , which had been blown out of the Illustrious convoy by Atlantic gales several days earlier . Brothers was a heavily laden ship that sailed poorly , and as a result the entire Saint Helens convoy was severely delayed . When lookouts on Calcutta sighted the sails to the northwest , Captain Daniel Woodriff was not immediately alarmed . He was expecting the Illustrious convoy from that direction , and knew that a number of British squadrons were at sea . Throughout the afternoon and the following night the sails closed with his squadron until at 11 : 00 on 26 September they were close enough for Woodriff to make the Royal Navy secret recognition signals . 
 By 12 : 00 , Woodriff had realised that the approaching ships did not know the recognition signals and therefore must be enemies . With his first priority to protect his convoy , Woodriff sent an urgent message to Indus , the largest and strongest of the merchant ships , to lead the main body of the convoy ahead eastwards at all speed . With his most valuable charges now making distance away from the French , Woodriff persuaded the captain of Brothers to sail northwards while he intended to engage the French directly and draw them southwards , away from the Saint Helena convoy and also away from the projected track of the Illustrious convoy . Once the merchant ships were gone beyond the horizon , Woodriff turned Calcutta about and sailed directly for the nearest French ship , the frigate Armide , which was gaining on his vessel . Armide was far more nimble than the lumbering Calcutta , and rapidly passed her out of range of her broadside , the frigate turning about and opening fire with her stern chasers , cannon mounted in the rear of the ship , at 15 : 00 . Calcutta replied ineffectually with her bow chasers , until Armide allowed the British ship to draw alongside . The two ships then opened a heavy fire on one another which continued for an hour until Armide , with her rigging badly damaged , drew back towards the rapidly approaching French squadron . 
 At 17 : 00 , the leading French ship of the line , Magnanime , came within range with her bow chasers . Calcutta continued sailing southwards , remaining ahead of the squadron but not at a sufficient distance to avoid Magnanime 's fire . Realising that unless he took drastic measures his ship would be caught , Woodriff turned Calcutta back towards Magnanime , hoping to disable her before the next ship in line , the frigate Thétis , could join the battle . Captain Pierre @-@ François Violette on Magnanime prepared to meet Calcutta and the engagement rapidly became furious , Calcutta and Magnanime exchanging full broadsides at close range . Within 45 minutes , it was clear that Woodriff 's gamble had failed . The larger and more powerful Magnanime inflicted severe damage to the British ship 's rigging , rendering her unable to manoeuvre or escape , with the remainder of the French squadron bearing down . With defeat inevitable , Woodriff spared the lives of his men by striking his colours and surrendering to Violette . Although Calcutta was badly damaged among her rigging and sails , her hull had suffered little from the engagement and she had only lost six killed and six wounded . French casualties were negligible , although Armide was forced to undergo extensive temporary repairs on her own sails and rigging before she was able to operate as a scout once more . Brothers had also been captured : the corvette Sylphe had separated during the chase and rapidly overhauled the lumbering merchant ship , which had surrendered without a fight . 
 = = Raiding operations = = 
 Woodriff 's resistance had an important indirect effect on Allemand 's cruise . In drawing the squadron southwards , Woodriff had pulled them out of the line travelled by the Illustrious convoy . In the aftermath of the engagement , it took two days to repair the battered Calcutta and in that time the convoy had safely passed Allemand 's former position without sighting the French force . With his object frustrated , Allemand completed the repairs to Calcutta and crewed her with men drawn from the rest of the squadron , adding the ship to his force . Aware that news of his presence would rapidly spread , Allemand subsequently turned southwards , sailing from the North Atlantic to the coast of North Africa to avoid pursuing British forces . There Allemand anchored for a time at the Spanish island of Tenerife , where he was able to repair and resupply his squadron before embarking on a lengthy cruise against the British convoys that regularly crossed the region . 
 Elsewhere , the Trafalgar campaign reached its climax on 21 October 1805 , when Villeneuve 's fleet was intercepted at sea off Cadiz by Nelson 's fleet and destroyed at the Battle of Trafalgar , the French and Spanish losing 17 out of 30 ships of the line . The British fleet did not lose a single ship , but the cost of the victory was severe : Lord Nelson , victor of four major battles in the previous eight years , had been killed at the height of the combat by a musket ball . The survivors of the combined fleet scattered , most making their way back to Cadiz . However , the four ships of the French vanguard , which had rapidly outdistanced the battle and not returned , escaped towards the Bay of Biscay under Contre @-@ Admiral Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley . Allemand 's cruise was to have unforeseen consequences for Dumanoir 's squadron : among the British forces mustered to hunt for the ships from Rochefort was a squadron under Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Richard Strachan in HMS Caesar , consisting of five ships of the line and two frigates . On 2 November , the frigate HMS Phoenix , which had also been ordered to search for signs of Allemand , discovered four French ships near Cape Finisterre . Unaware of the events of Trafalgar and assuming these ships to be a part of Allemand 's force , Captain Dundas sought to lure them towards Strachan 's squadron , which he knew to be in the area . Dundas was successful in provoking Dumanoir to chase his frigate , and two days later , on 4 February , Strachan was able to bring the French squadron to battle , capturing all four ships at the Battle of Cape Ortegal . 
 As these events unfolded Allemand was many hundreds of miles to the south , preying successfully on the trade that passed along the African coast without any serious opposition from major British forces , which were still largely confined to European waters . There was particular fear in Britain that Allemand might intercept two convoys of vital strategic importance : one extremely valuable convoy from India to Britain that also carried Major @-@ General Sir Arthur Wellesley as a passenger , and an expeditionary force under Admiral Sir Home Riggs Popham for a planned invasion of South Africa . In the event however , both these convoys managed to successfully avoid Allemand 's force . On 20 November , with his supplies running low , Allemand attacked a convoy of seven ships sailing from Britain to Gorée , passing close to the Savage Islands . Although his attack was successful , Allemand was unable to prevent the escape of the convoy 's escort , the 18 gun brig HMS Lark under Commander Frederick Langford . Making all sail northwards in search of reinforcements , Langford encountered his target on 26 November , meeting HMS Agamemnon , one of the ships that made up the squadron under Vice @-@ Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth . Duckworth had , with his subordinate Rear @-@ Admiral Thomas Louis , been ordered to keep a close blockade on Cadiz in case the remainder of the combined fleet that still sat at anchor there should try to escape . The work was tedious , and Duckworth immediately abandoned his post when news of attack by Allemand 's squadron reached him . He cast southwards in search of the French , leaving Cadiz guarded by just two frigates . 
 Allemand was aware of the risk involved in allowing Lark to escape , and was already many miles to the north when Duckworth headed southwards . There was no benefit to be had in a battle with Duckworth or any other British squadron and he did not delay on his journey home , reaching Rochefort without further incident on 23 December . His actions off the Savage Islands were to have far reaching consequences however . Duckworth continued southwards for much of December 1805 , only turning back north once he had reached the Cape Verde Islands , a point far too far south for Allemand to have been operating in . Accepting that his enemy had escaped him , Duckworth turned back north but soon afterwards ran into the frigate HMS Arethusa under Captain Charles Brisbane , whose large convoy had been broken up by an unidentified French battle squadron in the Bay of Biscay . Assuming this force to be Allemand , Duckworth set a course to intercept them based on their last known heading . Duckworth 's reckoning was good , and on 26 December he encountered a large squadron and immediately gave chase . It was not until sometime later that he realised the force he was chasing was too large to be Allemand 's : in fact Duckworth had stumbled into a squadron under Contre @-@ Admiral Jean @-@ Baptiste Willaumez , sent from Brest with another force under Contre @-@ Admiral Corentin Urbain Leissègues on 15 December at the start of the Atlantic campaign of 1806 , an operation largely inspired by the success of Allemand 's expedition . Although Willaumez was eventually able to outrun Duckworth , the chase continued for so long that Duckworth 's squadron was forced to take on fresh supplies at St Kitts in the West Indies . There news reached him that Leissègues had been sighted off Santo Domingo and he sailed to investigate , annihilating the French squadron at the Battle of San Domingo in February 1806 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The French naval authorities considered Allemand 's cruise a major success in a year that had cost them huge numbers of ships and men . In addition to Ranger and Calcutta , Allemand had captured the hired naval cutter Dove and 43 merchant ships , including the lumbering Brothers . With the exception of Calcutta , all of these prizes had been burnt and their prisoners had been transferred to the French squadron , 1 @,@ 200 in total . For minimal casualties , Allemand had inflicted a blow against British Atlantic trade and tied up substantial Royal Navy resources during a complicated and strategically vital campaign . Calcutta was bought into the French Navy and became an armed storeship , still carrying the designated 50 @-@ guns . She served for three years before her destruction at the Battle of the Basque Roads in April 1809 . Her British officers were later exchanged and honourably acquitted at the court @-@ martial that investigated her loss . 
 In France , Allemand was highly commended for the success of his operation , especially as both Leissègues and Willaumez met with disaster during the 1806 campaign . He remained with the Atlantic fleet for the next two years and in 1808 commanded a second successful operation in the Atlantic , carrying reinforcements to the Mediterranean Fleet at Toulon . In 1809 he returned to the Brest fleet as its commander , his ships trapped near the Île @-@ d 'Aix . He subsequently commanded the fleet at the defeat of the Battle of Basque Roads . His captains on the expedition were also praised and two later led their own campaigns , although both ended in defeat : Captain <unk> @-@ Jean @-@ Nicolas Soleil was in command of the frigate squadron destined for the West Indies that was destroyed in the Bay of Biscay at the Action of 25 September 1806 , while Captain Amable @-@ Gilles Troude led a larger squadron to the West Indies in early 1809 , suffering defeat in a battle off the Îles des Saintes .

 Nokian Tyres plc ( Finnish : Nokian <unk> <unk> ) , headquartered in Nokia , Finland , produces tyres for cars , trucks , buses , and heavy @-@ duty equipment . Known for its winter tyres , Nokian operates the only permanent winter tyre testing facility in the world . The company 's Hakkapeliitta brand name is recognised in Finland as a reputable trademark . 
 Nokian Tyres concentrates on the consumer car and vehicle tyre replacement and premium snow tyre markets ; they do not supply automobile manufacturers tyres for new car production . The greater prices consistently found in those markets result in higher profitability compared to the rest of the tyre industry . The company also produces retreading materials and tyre pressure monitors . It also previously manufactured bicycle tyres but currently licenses the Nokian name on bicycles tyres to another Finnish company . The Vianor retail tyre store chain , which services cars in addition to selling tyres , is owned by Nokian Tyres PLC . 
 The company traces its history to a <unk> pulp mill established in 1865 . Car tyre production began in 1932 by Suomen Gummitehdas Oy ( Finnish Rubber Works Ltd ) . A three @-@ company merger formed the Nokia Corporation in 1967 ; Nokian Tyres Limited was established in 1988 as a joint venture company split from the conglomerate as Nokia Corporation started focusing entirely on the mobile communications business . Nokian is " Nokia " in the genitive , thus Nokian <unk> meaning " Tyres of Nokia " . The European subsidiary of Japanese tyre company Bridgestone is currently the largest minority shareholder . 
 = = History = = 
 Early corporate predecessors of Nokian Tyres are the Nokia Aktiebolag ( Nokia Company ) and Suomen <unk> Oy ( Finnish Rubber Works Ltd . ) . In 1865 , mining engineer Fredrik Idestam established a <unk> pulp mill on the banks of the <unk> rapids in the town of Tampere , in southwestern Finland . In 1868 , Idestam built a second mill near the town of Nokia , 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) west of Tampere by the <unk> River , which had better resources for hydroelectric production . In 1871 , with the help of his close friend , the statesman Leo <unk> , Idestam renamed and transformed his mills into a share company , founding the Nokia Company . 
 Suomen Gummitehdas Oy was founded in 1898 and began manufacturing car tyres in 1932 . The Hakkapeliitta tyre name was introduced in 1936 , and some tyres sold under the Nokian tyre name still use the Hakkapeliitta brand name . Hakkapeliitta is a ( Finnish ) historical term used for a Finnish light cavalryman in the service of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden during the Thirty Years ' War ( 1618 – 48 ) . In 1967 , Suomen <unk> Oy ( originally called Suomen Gummitehdas Oy ) merged with Suomen <unk> ( Finnish Cable Works ) and the forest and power industry company Nokia Aktiebolag to create Nokia Corporation . 
 Nokian Tyres ( which had manufactured tyres under the Nokia brand ; Nokian is the genitive ) was split from the Nokia Corporation when Nokian Tyres Limited was created in 1988 as a joint venture company . Nokian Tyres PLC shares were floated on the Helsinki Stock Exchange ( OMX Helsinki ) in 1995 . Nokia , which became the largest mobile telephone manufacturer in 1998 , ended its ownership interest in Nokian Tyres in 2003 , selling its holding of 2 million shares to Bridgestone Europe NV / SA , a subsidiary of the Japanese tyre manufacturer Bridgestone , for U.S. $ 73 @.@ 2 million . This made Bridgestone the largest shareholder , with an 18 @.@ 9 % stake , later diluted to 16 @.@ 8 % . Bridgestone announced that Nokian Tyres would be operated independently , but it would consider complementing the company 's product development , testing , and distribution . 
 Production of bicycle tyres and inner tubes started in 1974 in Lieksa , Finland . In 2004 , Nokian Tyres sold its bicycle tyre business to Suomen <unk> Oy for € 3 @.@ 6 million . This successor company remains one of the few manufacturers of tungsten carbide @-@ studded snow tyres for bicycles . Suomen <unk> continues to produce bicycle tyres , including all Nokian @-@ branded bicycle tyres . 
 Nokian Tyres set up a joint venture , <unk> – Nokian Tyres JSC , with <unk> Corporation JSC , a multi @-@ industry Kazakh company , to manufacture passenger car tyres at a planned new factory in Kazakhstan . The venture started in 2007 , but the manufacturing project was put on hold in early 2009 . Nokian Tyres was to provide technical expertise in tyre manufacturing , and the products were to be sold in Kazakhstan , Central Asia , Russia , and Eastern Europe . In 2009 , the Nokian Hakkapeliitta tyre model line received the " List of trademarks with a reputation " status by the National Board of Patents and Registration of Finland . 
 = = Financial information = = 
 Nokian Tyres ' three principal activities are the manufacture of passenger car tyres , heavy commercial tyres , and retail tyre sales . As of 2008 , the Company is the most profitable tyre manufacturer in the world , at up to 18 % earnings ( before taxes and interest ) relative to sales , compared to 14 % at Bridgestone , 8 % at Michelin , and 9 @.@ 6 % at Continental . 
 In 2010 , Nokian Tyres profits were € 167 @.@ 9 million on sales of € 1 @.@ 058 billion , an increase in revenues of 32 @.@ 5 % on the previous year . The company had revenue growth of 18 % annually in the 2003 – 2007 period . Nokian Tyres is also publicly traded on the Berlin Stock Exchange . Kim Gran has been the President and Chief Executive Officer since 1 September 2000 , having previously served as a Vice President for five years .

 Nokian Tyres produces tyres for passenger cars , SUVs , and vans . Nokian branded tyres are sold in over 60 countries . Nokian Tyres designed the first winter tyres in 1934 and has more winter tyre patents than any other manufacturer . Nokian Tyres is known for its winter tyres , not to be confused with all @-@ season tyres . Nokian winter tyres have been described as a favourite of critics and have been well received in winter test results by several publications . Nokian also has designed some winter tyre models with low rolling resistance , offering lower fuel consumption . Nokian was the first company to produce a tyre that allowed for year @-@ round use by having different tread patterns on the lateral and medial aspect of the tread . One pattern is optimised for winter and another pattern is designed as an all @-@ season pattern . 
 Nokian Tyres was the first tyre manufacturer in the world to fully eliminate high @-@ aromatic oils from its production process . Used as <unk> agents in tread production and to facilitate the compounding of rubber , they contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) , a carcinogen , and have been replaced by low @-@ aromatic oils . In 2006 , Nokian Tyres received a commendation in the Finnish round of the European Business Awards for the Environment . 
 The demand for Nokian tyres is seasonal , as a high percentage of the company 's sales are of winter tyres , but it has reduced seasonal fluctuations by its development of summer and all weather tyres . According to the company , more than 80 % of its passenger car and van tyre sales are winter tyres . Winter tyre sales have a strong seasonal characteristic with 30 % of retail sales occurring in the ten days after the first snowfall , thus presenting challenges in production and delivery . 
 Nokian Tyres does not sell to automobile manufacturers , but instead concentrates on the more profitable consumer tyre replacement and premium snow tyre markets . Nokian Tyres has the highest market share of the Finnish passenger car tyre market . The Finnish , Swedish , and Norwegian markets contributed over 40 % of Nokian Tyres ' corporate net sales in 2008 . 
 The Russian market , Nokian Tyres ' largest , contributed 34 % of the net sales and captured 26 % of the Russian winter tyre market . CEO Kim Gran describes the Russian consumer as having a " love affair " with the Nokian brand citing that it stems from tyres which fits the local weather conditions and a genuine need in the market . The use of winter tyres , which has softer rubber compounds than all @-@ season tyres , results in improved starting , stopping , and steering performance . The Hakkapeliitta brand was , at one time , the only Western tyre brand in Russia having entered the market during the Soviet era in 1964 . In contrast to having a Russian tyre factory to benefit from lower tariffs , another tyre company , Continental AG , abandoned Russian tyre production and hopes for Russian membership in the World Trade Organisation will result in lower import tariffs . 
 In 2009 , the North American market accounted for over 10 % of the company 's net sales . Nokian Tyres has a tyre subsidiary based in <unk> , Tennessee ( USA ) . In that market , Nokian Tyres sell only to independent dealers , some of whom use the tyre products to fill in gaps in their product lines instead of an exclusive or majority share . This results in some dealers being knowledgeable about specific tyres but not Nokian Tyre 's full tyre product range .

 Nokian Tyres manufactures truck and bus tyres sold under the Nokian Hakkapeliitta brand . Steer , traction , and trailer tyres are marketed . Nokian Heavy Tyres Ltd is a manufacturer of special tyres for forestry , industrial machinery , and agriculture . Its products are sold as original equipment as well on the replacement tyre market . Nokian Tyres produces a number of product lines , including the Tractor Industrial 2 and Country King . Nokian Tyres is a world market leader in forestry tyres , which are a key product of the Nokian Heavy Tyres subsidiary . Nokian forestry tyres include the <unk> and Cut @-@ To @-@ Length model lines . The <unk> tyres have a 25 degree bar angle and the Cut @-@ To @-@ Length tyres have a 35 degree bar angle . Bar angle is a tyre tread measurement . Smaller bar angles are associated with higher traction at the expense of increased mud accumulation .

 Nokian Tyres owns 100 % of Vianor Holding Oy , which administers Vianor , a tyre chain of company owned and franchised stores . The Vianor name is derived from the Latin phrase " northern way " or " northern road " , and reflects the tyre chain 's image as a tyre specialist for winter conditions . 
 Vianor is the largest and most extensive tyre franchise in the Nordic countries with approximately 170 company @-@ owned retail outlets and around 800 outlets in total including franchises . Company @-@ owned outlets are located in the Switzerland , Russia , Norway , Finland , Sweden , and the United States .

 Nokian Tyres produces 23 @,@ 000 tyres per day at a factory in Nokia , Finland , and 200 @,@ 000 tyres a year under the Bridgestone brand name . The original factory was built in 1904 , the current one in 1945 ; it has expanded several times since then . Nokian Tyres has 27 assembly lines at its Finnish plant . The plant uses radio frequency devices to monitor the inventory of materials used to manufacture tyres , such as the 100 @-@ metre long strips of rubber tread . Shortages of rubber tread can halt production and so keeping an adequate supply of materials increases efficiency . Despite trade journals discussing this technique , Nokian declines to confirm its production methods . 
 The company has a 30 @-@ hectare ( 74 @-@ acre ) testing facility in Nokia , where it road tests tyres between April and November . From November to May , tests are carried out at its Ivalo Proving Grounds in Arctic Lapland . The Ivalo Proving Ground is the only permanent winter tyre testing facility in the world . Because of the short summer in Finland , Nokian tests summer tyres at other locations . During the winter , the testing of summer tyres takes place in South Africa . Nokian also tests tyres at the <unk> + <unk> facilities in El Vendrell , Spain , and the ATP facilities in <unk> , Germany .

 Nokian Tyres licenses production of its tyres to companies in the United States ( Bridgestone , <unk> , Tennessee plant ) , Slovakia ( Matador , <unk> plant ) , Indonesia ( PT Gajah Tunggal <unk> company ) , and the People 's Republic of China ( Giti Tire ) , as well as contracts manufacture of agriculture and industrial tyres in Spain and India . In the past , some United States contract manufacturing was done by Cooper Tire 's Findley , Ohio plant . Contract manufacture by Giti Tire includes production of up to 500 @,@ 000 Nokian summer tyres with expansion up to 1 @.@ 5 million tyres per year . Some Nokian agricultural and industrial tyres were made under contract by the <unk> <unk> in Romania for two years until December 1999 , when Nokian Tyres withdrew , citing quality standards .

With an increase in tyre demand as a result of improving economies , Nokian is considering increasing production as well as <unk> additional tyre manufacture in Asia . 
 = Edward Porter Alexander = 
 Edward Porter Alexander ( May 26 , 1835 – April 28 , 1910 ) was a military engineer , railroad executive , planter , and author . He served first as an officer in the United States Army and later , during the American Civil War ( 1861 – 1865 ) , in the Confederate Army , rising to the rank of brigadier general . 
 Alexander was the officer in charge of the massive artillery bombardment preceding Pickett 's Charge , on the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg , and is also noted for his early use of signals and observation balloons during combat . After the Civil War , he taught mathematics at the University of South Carolina in Columbia , spent time in Nicaragua , and wrote extensive memoirs and analyses of the war , which have received much praise for their insight and objectivity . His Military Memoirs of a Confederate were published in 1907 . An extensive personal account of his military training and his participation in the Civil War was rediscovered long after his death and published in 1989 as Fighting for the Confederacy . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Alexander , known to his friends as Porter , was born in Washington , Georgia into a wealthy and distinguished family of planters of the Old South . He was the sixth of ten children of Adam Leopold Alexander and Sarah Hillhouse Gilbert Alexander . He became the brother @-@ in @-@ law of Alexander R. Lawton and Jeremy F. Gilmer . He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1857 , third in his class of 38 cadets , and was brevetted a second lieutenant of engineers . He briefly taught engineering and fencing at the academy before he was ordered to report to Brig. Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston for the Utah War expedition . That mission ended before he could reach Johnston , and Alexander returned to West Point . He participated in a number of weapon experiments and worked as an assistant to Major Albert J. Myer , the first officer assigned to the Signal Corps and the inventor of the code for " wig @-@ wag " signal flags , or " aerial telegraphy " . Alexander was promoted to second lieutenant on October 10 , 1858 . 
 Alexander met Bettie Mason of Virginia in 1859 and married her on April 3 , 1860 . They would eventually have six children : Bessie Mason ( born 1861 ) , Edward Porter II and Lucy Roy ( twins , born 1863 ) , an unnamed girl ( 1865 , died in infancy prior to naming ) , Adam Leopold ( 1867 ) , and William Mason ( 1868 ) . Lt. Alexander 's final assignments for the U.S. Army were at Fort Steilacoom , in the Washington Territory , and at Alcatraz Island , near San Francisco , California . 
 = = Civil War service = = 
 After learning of the secession of his home state of Georgia , Alexander resigned his U.S. Army commission on May 1 , 1861 , to join the Confederate Army as a captain of engineers . While organizing and training new recruits to form a Confederate signal service , he was ordered to report to Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard at Manassas Junction , Virginia . He became the chief engineer and signal officer of the Confederate Army of the Potomac on June 3 . 
 At the First Battle of Bull Run , Alexander made history by being the first to use signal flags to transmit a message during combat over a long distance . Stationed atop " Signal Hill " in Manassas , Alexander saw Union troop movements and signaled to the brigade under Col. Nathan " Shanks " Evans , " Look out for your left , your position is turned " . Upon receiving a similar message , Beauregard and Gen. Joseph E. Johnston sent timely reinforcements that turned the tide of battle in the Confederates ' favor . 
 Alexander was promoted to major on July 1 and lieutenant colonel on December 31 , 1861 . During much of this period he was chief of ordnance , under Johnston 's command , managing supplies and ammunition in what later became the Army of Northern Virginia . He was also active in signal work and intelligence gathering , dealing extensively with spies operating around Washington , D.C. 
 During the early days of the Peninsula Campaign of 1862 , Alexander continued as chief of ordnance under Johnston , but he also fought at the Battle of Williamsburg , under Maj. Gen. James Longstreet . When Gen. Robert E. Lee assumed command of the army , Alexander was in charge of pre @-@ positioned ordnance for Lee 's offensive in the Seven Days Battles . Alexander continued his intelligence gathering by volunteering to go up in an observation balloon at Gaines ' Mill on June 27 , ascending several times and returning with valuable intelligence regarding the position of the Union Army . 
 Alexander continued in charge of ordnance for the Northern Virginia Campaign ( Second Bull Run ) and the Maryland Campaign ( Antietam ) . He barely missed capture by Federal cavalry , under Col. Benjamin F. " Grimes " Davis , that had escaped from Harpers Ferry during the Maryland Campaign ; over 40 of Longstreet 's 80 ammunition wagons were captured . 
 Porter Alexander is best known as an artilleryman who played a prominent role in many of the important battles of the war . He served in different artillery capacities for Longstreet 's First Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia , starting that role on November 7 , 1862 , after leaving Lee 's staff to command the battalion that was the corps ' artillery reserve . He was promoted to colonel on December 5 . He was instrumental in arranging the artillery in defense of Marye 's Heights at the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862 , which proved to be the decisive factor in the Confederate victory . While the rest of Longstreet 's corps was located around Suffolk , Virginia , Alexander accompanied Stonewall Jackson on his flanking march at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863 , and his artillery placements in Hazel Grove at Chancellorsville proved decisive . 
 = = = Gettysburg cannonade = = = 
 Alexander 's most famous engagement was on July 3 , 1863 , at the Battle of Gettysburg , during which he was in command of the artillery for Longstreet 's corps . On that day , he was effectively in control of the artillery for the full army ( despite Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton 's formal role as chief of artillery under Lee ) . He conducted a massive two @-@ hour bombardment , arguably the largest in the war , using between 150 and 170 guns against the Union position on Cemetery Ridge . Unfortunately , the poor quality of the Confederate fuses delayed the planned detonation of many of the shells , and a number of the guns were not properly ranged , so that the rear areas sustained more damage than the front lines . General Longstreet effectively put Alexander in charge of launching Maj. Gen. George Pickett on his famous charge , placing the young colonel under enormous pressure to determine whether the Union artillery defenses had been suppressed . Alexander would blame Lee for the defeat at Gettysburg , writing in 1901 : " Never , never , never did Gen. Lee himself <unk> [ sic ] a fight as he did this . " 
 = = = Longstreet 's Chief of Artillery = = = 
 Alexander accompanied the First Corps to northern Georgia in the fall of 1863 to reinforce Gen. Braxton Bragg for the Battle of Chickamauga . He personally arrived too late to participate in the battle , but served as Longstreet 's chief of artillery in the subsequent Knoxville Campaign and in the Department of East Tennessee in early 1864 . He returned with the corps to Virginia for the remainder of the war , now with the rank of brigadier general ( as of February 26 , 1864 ) . He served in all the battles of the Overland Campaign , and when Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant slipped around Lee 's army to cross the James River and assault Petersburg , Alexander was able to move his guns quickly through the lines , emplacing them to repel the main attack . 
 During the Siege of Petersburg , Alexander had to adapt his artillery tactics to trench warfare , including experimentation with various types of mortars . He became convinced that the Union forces were attempting to tunnel under the Confederate lines , but before he was able to act on this , on June 30 , 1864 , he was wounded in the shoulder by a sharpshooter . As he departed on medical leave to Georgia , he informed Lee of his suspicion . After unsuccessful attempts were made to locate the tunneling activity , the Battle of the Crater caught the Confederates by surprise , although it ended in a significant Union defeat . Alexander returned to the Army in February 1865 and supervised the defenses of Richmond along the James River . He retreated along with Lee 's army in the Appomattox Campaign . 
 At Appomattox Court House , it was Alexander who made the famous proposal to Robert E. Lee that the army disperse , rather than surrendering . Lee rebuked him , and Alexander later wrote about regretting his suggestion . Although this incident is sometimes described as a proposal for " guerrilla war " , Alexander describes his proposal in his memoir , Fighting for the Confederacy , as one in which " the army may be ordered to scatter in the woods & bushes & either to rally upon Gen. Johnston in North Carolina , or to make their way , each man to his own state , with his arms , & to report to his governor . " 
 = = Later life = = 
 After the surrender , Alexander briefly toyed with joining the Brazilian Army . Finding that he no longer desired the Georgia plantation life of his youth , he taught mathematics at the University of South Carolina in Columbia , and then served in executive positions with the Charlotte , Columbia , and Augusta Railroad ( executive superintendent ) , the Savannah and Memphis Railroad ( president ) , the Louisville and Nashville Railroad ( president ) , and in the late 1880s the Central Rail Road and Banking Company of Georgia until 1891 . 
 Alexander became friends with Grover Cleveland and the two spent many hours hunting for ducks on Alexander 's estate . In May 1897 , President Cleveland appointed Alexander as the arbiter of the commission tasked with fixing and demarcating the boundary between the Republics of Nicaragua and Costa Rica , with a view towards the possible construction of an <unk> canal to be dug across Central America . Alexander spent two years at the head of that commission , headquartered in the coastal village of Greytown ( now San Juan de Nicaragua ) . He completed the work to the satisfaction of the two governments and returned to the U.S. in October 1899 . His wife Bettie became ill while he was in Nicaragua and she died shortly after his return , on November 20 , 1899 . In October 1901 , Alexander married Mary Mason , his first wife 's niece . 
 Alexander was selected to give the Confederate veteran 's speech on Alumni Day during the centennial celebration at the United States Military Academy on June 9 , 1902 . The speech was so well received that it was reprinted in the NY Times in its entirety in the 15 June 1902 edition . The NY Times referred to the speech as " decidedly the feature of Alumni Day . " The audience included President Theodore Roosevelt as well as Alexander 's former commander , General Longstreet . 
 After the war , Alexander became a well @-@ respected author . He wrote many magazine articles and published his Military Memoirs of a Confederate : A Critical Narrative ( 1907 ) , praised by Douglas Southall Freeman as " altogether the best critique of the operations of the Army of Northern Virginia . " Long after his death , it was realized that Alexander had produced the Military Memoirs , which sought to be a professional work of military history and analysis , after a long effort of editing a collection of much more personal memoirs that he had started compiling during his time in Greytown , Nicaragua , at the behest of his family . Those earlier memoirs were edited and published posthumously in 1989 as Fighting for the Confederacy : The Personal Recollections of General Edward Porter Alexander . 
 Unlike such Confederate officers as Jubal Early and William Pendleton , Alexander eschewed the bitter Lost Cause theories of why the South was doomed to fail , given the overwhelming superiority of the North . He was willing to express in writing his criticisms of prominent Confederate officers , including General Lee himself . Many historians regard Alexander 's memoirs as among the most objective and sharpest sources produced by a Civil War combatant . David Eicher called Fighting for the Confederacy " a superb personal narrative with a good deal of analysis of Lee 's operations ... Dramatic and revealing , an important source on the general , his fellow officers , and the Army of Northern Virginia . " Alexander 's other books include Railway Practice ( 1887 ) and <unk> , <unk> ( <unk> ) ( 1888 ) . Alexander died in Savannah , Georgia and is buried in Magnolia Cemetery , Augusta , Georgia . 
 = = In Popular Culture = = 
 Alexander was portrayed by James Patrick Stuart in the 1993 film Gettysburg and its 2003 prequel Gods and Generals . 
 In the alternate history novel How Few Remain , Alexander continues his career as a brigadier general long after the Confederate States of America wins the civil war and was instrumental in defending Confederate Kentucky and fending off another Union invasion while under Stonewall Jackson during a second war with the United States in the 1880 's .

 A Saucerful of Secrets is the second studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd , released on 29 June 1968 by EMI Columbia in the United Kingdom and released on 27 July 1968 in the United States by Tower Records . The album was recorded before and after Syd Barrett 's departure from the group . Owing to Barrett 's behaviour becoming increasingly unpredictable , Barrett was forced to leave the band and David Gilmour was recruited in January 1968 . 
 As a result , A Saucerful of Secrets became the only non @-@ compilation Pink Floyd album on which all five band members appeared , the first for Gilmour , with him appearing on five songs ( " Let There Be More Light " , " Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun " , " Corporal Clegg " , " A Saucerful of Secrets " and " See @-@ Saw " ) , and the last for Barrett , with him on three ( " Remember a Day " , " Jugband Blues " and " Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun " ) . " Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun " was the only song all five members appeared on together . The band 's drummer Nick Mason has declared A Saucerful of Secrets to be his favourite Pink Floyd album .

 From mid to late 1967 , Syd Barrett 's erratic behaviour became more apparent , and at one performance of the band 's first US tour , he slowly detuned his guitar while on stage . The audience , used to the band 's experimental performances , seemed to enjoy such antics , and were unaware of the rest of the band 's increasing consternation . Interviewed on Pat Boone 's show during this tour , Barrett 's reply to Boone 's questions was a " blank and totally mute stare " , and kept his lips closed during the mimed performance . Barrett exhibited behaviour in a similar style during the band 's first appearance on Dick Clark 's popular TV show American Bandstand . Barrett mimed fairly well for the performance of " Apples and Oranges " , but responded to Clark 's questions with no interest or enthusiasm .

 The album was recorded at EMI Studios in London . The first songs recorded for the album were Roger Waters ' " Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun " and an unreleased Barrett track , " Scream Thy Last Scream " ; both recorded on 7 – 8 August 1967 . The two tracks were arranged to be released as a single on 8 September , before it was vetoed by the band 's record company , EMI . The band recorded " Vegetable Man " at De Lane Lea Studios on 9 – 11 October , and returned later in the month , on 19 October , to record " Jugband Blues " , with producer Norman Smith booking a Salvation Army band , at Barrett 's request . Overdubbing " Remember a Day " at the sessions ; the song , which was an outtake from The Piper at the Gates of Dawn sessions , features Barrett on slide guitar , the band took a break from the album sessions to record what became their third single , " Apples and Oranges " , on 26 and 27 October . A few days later , the band recorded the B @-@ side , " Paint Box " , before leaving for a US tour . 
 In November , " Apples and Oranges " was released as a single but failed to chart at all . The band eventually went back to De Lane Lea and recorded the unreleased track " Vegetable Man " . Sometime around Christmas , David Gilmour ( Barrett 's old school friend ) was asked to join the band as a second lead guitarist to cover for Barrett when his erratic behaviour prevented him from performing . As Barrett had , up until then , written ( or co @-@ written ) most of the songs on the band 's debut album , The Piper at the Gates of Dawn , as well as the band 's three singles up to this point , the initial plan was to keep him in the group as a non @-@ touring member – in similar style to Brian Wilson 's recent status in The Beach Boys – but this meant that Barrett and the group were essentially separated . For two days from 10 January 1968 , Pink Floyd reconvened at EMI Studios , attempting to work on older tracks : Waters ' vocals and Wright 's organ were overdubbed onto " Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun " , while Mason added vocals to " Scream Thy Last Scream " . Upon leaving Pink Floyd , Barrett said to Melody Maker : " I suppose it was really just a matter of being a little offhand about things " .

 When Gilmour joined the band , Pink Floyd performed briefly as a five @-@ man piece , from 12 January till the 20th . For a handful of shows Gilmour played and sang while Barrett wandered around on stage , occasionally joining in with the playing . In between these five @-@ piece gigs , the group rehearsed a few Waters @-@ penned songs on 15 and 16 January . During the next session on 18 January , the band , joined by Smith , jammed on rhythm tracks ; Barrett didn 't attend this session . On 24 and 25 January , the band recorded a song , logged as " The Most Boring Song I 've Ever Heard Bar 2 " at Abbey Road . The band recorded " Let There Be More Light " , " Corporal Clegg " ( which features lead vocals by Nick Mason ) and " See @-@ Saw " all without Barrett , despite manager Andrew King claiming Barrett performed the slide solo at the end of " Let There Be More Light " . The other band members soon grew tired of Barrett 's antics and , on 26 January 1968 , when Waters was driving on the way to a show at Southampton University , picking the members up on the way , one person in the car said , " Shall we pick Syd up ? " and another said , " Let 's not bother . " Barrett was finally ousted from the band in late January 1968 , leaving the new incarnation of Pink Floyd to finish the album ; " Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun " is the only song on which all five band members appeared . 
 The four @-@ piece band struggled to come up with new material for an album , but in February 1968 recorded Wright 's " It Would Be So Nice " and Waters ' " Julia Dream " . In early February it was announced that the Waters @-@ penned track , " Corporal Clegg " would be the band 's next single , however , due to pressure from the label , the song was earmarked for the album , and " It Would Be So Nice " was released in April as a single , with " Julia Dream " on the B @-@ side . Throughout April , the band was taking stock of the songs recorded up to that point . Waters blocked the release of the two tracks , " Vegetable Man " and " Scream Thy Last Scream " , on the album , though the band retained " Jugband Blues " , and the Waters @-@ written " Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun " on which Barrett played . With not enough material to fill the album 's last 12 minutes , the band started piecing together several pieces of material that was to become the title track of the album , " A Saucerful of Secrets " . Mason and Waters planned the track out as if it were an architectural design , including peaks and troughs . Producer Smith didn 't like the song , stating to them that they " just can 't do this , it 's too long . You have to write three @-@ minute songs . " On 25 June , the band recorded another session for BBC Radio 's Top Gear ; the session featured two tracks from Saucerful : " Let There Be More Light " and a shortened retitled version of the title track , titled here as " The Massed Gadgets of Hercules " .

 Like The Piper at the Gates of Dawn before it , the album contains space rock and psychedelic rock songs . However , unlike Piper , which was dominated by Barrett 's compositions , A Saucerful of Secrets contains only one Barrett original : " Jugband Blues " . AllMusic described that with A Saucerful of Secrets , " the band begin to map out the dark and repetitive pulses that would characterize their next few records . " Wright sings or shares lead vocals on four of the album 's seven songs , and contributes vocals on the eleven @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ minute instrumental opus " A Saucerful of Secrets " , making this the only Pink Floyd album where his vocal contributions outnumber those of the rest of the band . 
 With Barrett seemingly detached from proceedings , it came down to Waters and Wright to provide adequate material . The opening , " Let There Be More Light " , penned by Waters , continues the space rock approach established by Barrett . " Let There Be More Light " evolved from a bass riff that was part of " Interstellar Overdrive " . Both " Remember a Day " and " See @-@ Saw " use the childlike approach that was established on their debut . Wright remained critical of his early contributions to the band . " Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun " was first performed with Barrett in 1967 . The success of the track was such that it remained in their live setlist until 1973 where it appeared in a greatly extended form . Waters later performed the track during solo concerts from 1984 and later . Waters borrowed the lyrics from a book of Chinese poetry from the Tang Dynasty , like Barrett had used in " Chapter 24 " . " Corporal Clegg " , is the first Pink Floyd song to address issues of war , a theme which would endure throughout the career of Waters as a songwriter for the band , culminating on the 1983 album The Final Cut . " A Saucerful of Secrets " was originally written as a new version of " Nick 's Boogie " . The track is titled as four parts , on Ummagumma . A staple in the band 's live set until summer 1972 , a live version of the song was recorded on 27 April 1969 at the Mothers Club in Birmingham for inclusion on Ummagumma . " Jugband Blues " refers to Barrett 's departure from the group ( " It 's awfully considerate of you to think of me here / And I 'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I 'm not here " ) . A promotional video was recorded for the track . The band 's management wanted to release the song as a single , before being vetoed by both the band and producer Norman Smith . 
 = = = Unreleased songs = = = 
 As well as " Jugband Blues " , the album was to include " Vegetable Man " , another Barrett composition . The song was to appear on a single as the B @-@ side to " Scream Thy Last Scream " . The band performed " Jugband Blues " , " Vegetable Man " and " Scream Thy Last Scream " for a Top Gear session , recorded on 20 December , and broadcast on 31st . Two additional Barrett songs , " In the <unk> " , and " No Title " ( frequently referred to on bootlegs as " Sunshine " ) , were recorded early in the album sessions . At least one other song , " John Latham " , was recorded during these sessions , and remains unreleased .

 This is the first of several Pink Floyd album covers that were designed by Hipgnosis , and was only the second time that an EMI group ( The Beatles were the first ) was permitted to hire outside designers for an album jacket . The album was released in the UK on 29 June 1968 on EMI 's Columbia label as both mono and stereo LPs , reaching number 9 in the UK charts . It was released in the US by the Tower Records division of Capitol , where it remains the only Pink Floyd album not to chart . However , when reissued as A Nice Pair with the original version of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn after the success of The Dark Side of the Moon , the album did chart at number 36 on the Billboard 200 . " Let There Be More Light " was released as a single , backed with " Remember a Day " , in the US on 19 August 1969 . 
 The CD stereo mix of the album was first released in 1988 , and in 1992 was digitally remastered and reissued as part of the Shine On box set . The remastered stereo CD was released on its own in 1994 in the UK and the US . The mono mix version of the album has never been officially released on CD . This album will be re @-@ issued on the Pink Floyd Records label on 3 June 2016 . 
 Upon its release , Rolling Stone magazine 's review was unfavourable , writing that it is " not as interesting as their first " and " rather mediocre " , highlighting the near @-@ departure of Syd Barrett as one of its detractions . 
 In a retrospective review for AllMusic , Richie Unterberger draws attention to the album 's " gentle , fairy @-@ tale ambience " , with songs that move from " concise and vivid " to " spacy , ethereal material with lengthy instrumental passages " . In a review for BBC Music , Daryl Easlea said Saucerful was " not without filler " , adding that " Jugband Blues " was " the most chilling " song on the album . 
 While promoting 2014 's The Endless River , Nick Mason named A Saucerful of Secrets as his favourite of Pink Floyd 's studio albums . “ I think there are ideas contained there that we have continued to use all the way through our career , ” he says . “ I think [ it ] was a quite good way of marking Syd [ Barrett ] ’ s departure and Dave [ Gilmour ] ’ s arrival . It ’ s rather nice to have it on one record , where you get both things . It ’ s a cross @-@ fade rather than a cut . ”

 " The Inner Light " is a song by the English rock group the Beatles , written by George Harrison . It was released on a non @-@ album single in March 1968 , as the B @-@ side to " Lady Madonna " . The song was the first Harrison composition to be featured on a Beatles single and reflects the band 's embrace of Transcendental Meditation and his continued interest in Indian classical music . It is the last of three Indian @-@ style tracks he wrote for the Beatles , after " Love You To " and " Within You Without You " . The lyrics are a rendering of a poem from the Taoist Tao Te Ching , which Harrison set to music on the recommendation of Juan Mascaró , a Sanskrit scholar who had translated the passage in his 1958 book Lamps of Fire . The song became a comparative rarity among the Beatles ' recordings in the decade following its release ; it has subsequently appeared on compilation albums such as Rarities , Past Masters , Volume Two and Mono Masters . 
 Harrison recorded the instrumental track for " The Inner Light " in India in January 1968 , during the sessions for his Wonderwall Music soundtrack album . The only Beatles studio recording to be made outside Europe , the song introduced instruments such as sarod , shehnai and pakhavaj to the band 's sound and features contributions from Indian classical musicians including Aashish Khan , Hanuman Jadev and Hariprasad Chaurasia . Aside from Harrison 's lead vocal , recorded in London , the Beatles ' only contribution came in the form of group backing vocals at the end of the song . 
 Among music critics , " The Inner Light " has received praise for its melodic qualities and for its evocation of the meditation experience . Jeff Lynne and Anoushka Shankar performed the song at the Concert for George tribute in November 2002 , a year after Harrison 's death . An alternative take of the 1968 instrumental track was released in 2014 on the remastered Wonderwall Music CD . Screenwriter Morgan Gendel named a 1992 episode of the television series Star Trek : The Next Generation as an homage to the song . 
 = = Background and inspiration = = 
 In his autobiography , I , Me , Mine , George Harrison recalls that he was inspired to write " The Inner Light " by Juan Mascaró , a Sanskrit scholar at Cambridge University . Mascaró had taken part in a debate , televised on The Frost Programme on 4 October 1967 , during which Harrison and John Lennon discussed the merits of Transcendental Meditation with an audience of academics and religious leaders . In a subsequent letter to Harrison , dated 16 November , Mascaró expressed the hope that they might meet again before the Beatles departed for India , where the group were to study meditation with their guru , Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . Mascaró enclosed a copy of his book Lamps of Fire , an anthology of religious writings , including from Lao @-@ Tzu 's Tao Te Ching . Having stated his admiration for the spiritual message in Harrison 's composition " Within You Without You " , Mascaró enquired : " might it not be interesting to put into your music a few words of Tao , for example no . 48 , page 66 of Lamps ? " 
 Harrison wrote the song during a period when he had undertaken his first musical project outside the Beatles , composing the soundtrack to the Joe Massot @-@ directed film Wonderwall . When writing " The Inner Light " , he made minimal alterations to the translated Lao @-@ Tzu text and used the same title that Mascaró had used . In I , Me , Mine , Harrison says of the changes required to create his second verse : 
 In the original poem , the verse says " Without going out of my door , I can know the ways of heaven . " And so to prevent any misinterpretations – and also to make the song a bit longer – I did repeat that as a second verse but made it : " Without going out of your door / You can know all things on earth / Without looking out of your window / You can know the ways of heaven " – so that it included everybody . 
 After " Within You Without You " , " The Inner Light " was the second composition to fully reflect Harrison 's immersion in Eastern spiritual concepts , particularly meditation , an interest that had spread to his Beatles bandmates and to the group 's audience . The lyrics espouse meditation as a means to genuine understanding . Theologian Dale Allison describes the song as a " hymn " to quietism and comments that , in their attempt to " <unk> and disparage knowledge of the external world " , the words convey Harrison 's enduring worldview . Author John Winn notes that Harrison had pre @-@ empted the message of " The Inner Light " in an August 1967 interview , when he told New York DJ Murray Kaufman : " The more you learn , the more you know that you don 't know anything at all . " Writing in his study of Harrison 's musical career , Ian Inglis similarly identifies a precedent in the song " It 's All Too Much " , where Harrison sings : " The more I learn , the less I know . " 
 = = Composition and musical structure = = 
 " The Inner Light " was Harrison 's third song in the Indian musical genre , after " Love You To " and " Within You Without You " . While those earlier songs had followed the Hindustani ( North Indian ) system of Indian classical music , as <unk> and tabla @-@ based compositions , " The Inner Light " is closer in style to the Carnatic ( or South Indian ) temple music tradition . Harrison 's progression within the genre reflected his concept for the Wonderwall soundtrack – namely , that the assignment allowed him to create an " anthology " of Indian music and present a diverse range of styles and instrumentation . 
 The composition is structured into three instrumental passages separated by two sections of verse . The buoyant mood of the instrumental sections – set to what author Peter Lavezzoli describes as " a raucous 4 / 4 rhythm " – contrasts with the gentle , meditative portions containing the verses . The contrast is reflected in the lead instruments that Harrison would use on the recording : whereas sarod and shehnai , supported by pakhavaj , are prominent during the musical passages , the softer @-@ sounding bansuri ( flute ) and harmonium accompany the singing over the verses , as the sarod provides a response to each line of the vocal . In the last instrumental section , Harrison incorporates the conclusion of Lao @-@ Tzu 's poem , beginning with the line " Arrive without travelling " . 
 The melody conforms to the pitches of Mixolydian mode , or its Indian equivalent , the Khamaj thaat . Musicologist Dominic Pedler writes that the tune features unusual tritone intervals , which , together with the musical arrangement , ensure that the song is far removed from standard " pop tunes " . In a further departure from Harrison 's previous forays into Indian music , both of which made extensive use of single @-@ chord drone , the melody allows for formal chord changes : over the verses , the dominant E ♭ major alternates with F minor , before a move to A ♭ over the line " The farther one travels the less one knows " . 
 In the opening words ( " Without going out " ) , the melody uses what Pedler terms a " hauntingly modal " G @-@ B ♭ -D ♭ tritone progression as , within the song 's tonic key ( of E ♭ ) , the 3rd note heads towards the flat 7th . Musicologist Walter Everett likens this ascending arpeggiation of the diminished triad to a melodic feature in " Within You Without You " ( over that song 's recurring phrase " We were talking " ) . " The Inner Light " is an example of Harrison creating ambiguity about the tonic key , a technique that Pedler recognises as a characteristic of Harrison 's spiritually oriented songwriting .
