 Lieutenant Aiden Ford is introduced in the series premiere , " Rising " , where he is stationed at the Antarctica outpost . Ford served in the Stargate Command ( SGC ) before and is twenty @-@ five years old at the beginning of the first season . Ford served as John Sheppard 's second @-@ in @-@ command after the events of " Rising " until a Wraith feeds upon Ford during a Wraith attack on Atlantis in season 2 's " The Siege , Part 3 " . An exploding grenade blows them off a building into the ocean , and Ford 's unconscious body and the still attached Wraith are recovered over an hour later . Ford survives after having an overdose of Wraith enzyme and later undergoes mental and physical changes . Ford develops a solid black left eye and becomes more aggressive and paranoid , fleeing Atlantis with a stolen Puddle Jumper . 
 The Atlantis team encounters him again in " Runner " where they learn that Ford began killing <unk> throughout the Pegasus galaxy to harvest their enzyme that gave him abnormal strength . Ford is presumed dead when he deliberately jumps into the culling beam of a Wraith dart , but the Atlantis team encounters him again in the mid @-@ season 2 @-@ parter " The Lost Boys " / " The Hive " . The Wraith @-@ enzyme allowed Ford to awake immediately after <unk> on board a Wraith @-@ hive ship , from where he escaped only to build up a small strike force of young men following his suit by informing them about the benefits of the Wraith @-@ enzyme . Ford asks the Atlantis team for help in destroying an entire Wraith Hive @-@ ship , but the mission fails and forces Sheppard to leave Ford behind on an about @-@ to @-@ explode hive ship . Ford is only seen again in Sheppard 's dream in the season 5 episode " Search and Rescue " .

 Ford reappears in the official novel continuation Stargate Atlantis Legacy : The Third Path . To their surprise , the team finds Ford alive and with a group of nomadic humans known as the Travelers . He explains to Sheppard he managed to escape the hive ship before it was destroyed , but crashed on the planet the battle took place over . With the help of the Travelers , he recovered from his addiction but it took so long that he could no longer find Atlantis afterwards . Ford began leading a guerilla campaign against the Wraith , aided by the Travelers . He also now has a wife and son and regrets his previous actions under the Wraith enzyme . At the end of the novel , Ford is safely returned to Earth with his wife and son and reunites with his cousin and grandparents .

 After the end of season 1 , the series producers , and the actor himself , felt that Ford had not worked as intended and was highly underused as a result . Unwilling to write him out , the writers came up with an idea to make the character more important , but that downgraded him to a recurring character . Producer Joseph Mallozzi said in 2009 that " We can assume [ Ford ] went down [ ... ] with the ship " in " The Hive " . Rainbow Sun Francks was disappointed about the evolution of his character , saying Ford did not evolve a backstory which the other characters did . Although Francks called the situation " tough " , he reacted positively towards the development of character during the second season . 
 After announcing that Ronon Dex would become a main character in the Atlantis series , they followed up with another announcement saying that they had reduced Ford to a recurring character in the series . Many fans were disappointed with this new development because many felt he didn 't have time to " prove " himself in the new series and that the character was never fully developed compared to the other characters in the show . Many campaigns to save the character were created after the announcement , the most notable being the <unk> campaign . Francks said that the change was not a " blow " , since he and Brad Wright had already discussed the change . He was also more positive in the change of story arc for the character , saying he was a " big part " of the second season compared to season one where they hadn 't had enough episodes to broaden the character . When asked about reducing Francks ' role in Atlantis , Wright replied " The change in status means that Francks will not appear in every episode , and will not be listed in the show 's opening credits . "

 Fans of the character set up campaigns to get Ford back as a main character later in season two or season three . They sent various petitions to the producers , cast and crew of Stargate Atlantis to change their minds . Fans of the character even put up a website under the name <unk> , which in turn was also the name for one of the campaigns fighting for the revival of the character . 
 = Mono – Inyo Craters = 
 The Mono – Inyo Craters are a volcanic chain of craters , domes and lava flows in Mono County , Eastern California , United States . The chain stretches 25 miles ( 40 km ) from the northwest shore of Mono Lake to the south of Mammoth Mountain . The Mono Lake Volcanic Field forms the northernmost part of the chain and consists of two volcanic islands in the lake and one cinder cone volcano on its northwest shore . Most of the Mono Craters , which make up the bulk of the northern part of the Mono – Inyo chain , are phreatic ( steam explosion ) volcanoes that have since been either plugged or over @-@ topped by rhyolite domes and lava flows . The Inyo Craters form much of the southern part of the chain and consist of phreatic explosion pits , and rhyolitic lava flows and domes . The southernmost part of the chain consists of fumaroles and explosion pits on Mammoth Mountain and a set of cinder cones south of the mountain ; the latter are called the Red Cones . 
 Eruptions along the narrow fissure system under the chain began in the west moat of Long Valley Caldera 400 @,@ 000 to 60 @,@ 000 years ago . Mammoth Mountain was formed during this period . Multiple eruptions from 40 @,@ 000 to 600 years ago created the Mono Craters and eruptions 5 @,@ 000 to 500 years ago formed the Inyo Craters . Lava flows 5 @,@ 000 years ago built the Red Cones , and explosion pits on Mammoth Mountain were excavated in the last 1 @,@ 000 years . Uplift of Paoha Island in Mono Lake about 250 years ago is the most recent activity . These eruptions most likely originated from small magma bodies rather than from a single , large magma chamber like the one that produced the massive Long Valley Caldera eruption 760 @,@ 000 years ago . During the past 3 @,@ 000 years , eruptions have occurred every 250 to 700 years . In 1980 , a series of earthquakes and uplift within and south of Long Valley Caldera indicated renewed activity in the area . 
 The region has been used by humans for centuries . Obsidian was collected by Mono Paiutes for making sharp tools and arrow points . <unk> rock continues to be removed in modern times for use as commercial scour and yard decoration . Mono Mills processed timber felled on or near the volcanoes for the nearby boomtown Bodie in the late 19th to early 20th centuries . Water diversions into the Los Angeles Aqueduct system from their natural outlets in Mono Lake started in 1941 after a water tunnel was cut under the Mono Craters . Mono Lake Volcanic Field and a large part of the Mono Craters gained some protection under Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area in 1984 . Resource use along all of the chain is managed by the United States Forest Service as part of Inyo National Forest . Various activities are possible along the chain , including hiking , bird watching , canoeing , skiing , and mountain biking .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 The Mono – Inyo Craters form a volcanic chain in Eastern California that sit along a narrow , north – south @-@ trending fissure system that extends from the north shore of Mono Lake , through the western moat of Long Valley Caldera , and south of Mammoth Mountain . The chain is located in Inyo National Forest and Mono County , California , and the nearest incorporated community is Mammoth Lakes , California . The Mono Craters are located in Mono Basin , itself part of the Great Basin . 
 = = = = Mono Craters = = = = 
 The Mono Craters are a 10 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 17 km ) chain of at least 27 volcanic domes , three large glass flows called coulees and various explosion pits and other associated volcanic features . The domes of the chain lie on a roughly north – south @-@ trending arc that is concave to the west and located south of Mono Lake . The highest of the Mono Craters domes is Crater Mountain ( elevation 9 @,@ 172 feet or 2 @,@ 796 m ) , which rises 2 @,@ 400 feet ( 730 m ) above Pumice Valley to the west . Associated volcanic features are located in Mono Lake ( Paoha and Negit Islands ) and on its north shore ( Black Point ) . The coulees cluster north and south of the overlapping chain of domes . Craters exist at the top of most domes and on flat land south of them . 
 = = = = Inyo Craters = = = = 
 The two southernmost Inyo Craters are open pits in a forested area that are about 600 feet ( 180 m ) across and 100 to 200 feet ( 30 to 60 m ) deep , each with small ponds covering their floors . A quarter mile ( half kilometer ) north of these is another Inyo Craters explosion pit on top of Deer Mountain . Farther north of these craters are five lava domes , including Deadman Creek Dome , Glass Creek Dome , Obsidian Dome , and Wilson Butte . These domes are composed of gray rhyolite , frothy pumice , and black obsidian . The Mono – Inyo Craters volcanic chain extends into Long Valley Caldera but is not related to the caldera 's volcanism . 
 = = = = Red Cones = = = = 
 South of the Inyo Craters proper are other features related to the dike system responsible for creating the craters , volcanoes and lava flows . These include a north – south trend of fault scarps up to 20 feet ( 6 m ) high and pull @-@ apart cracks or fissures in the earth . These fissures are not technically faults because little or no vertical or horizontal movement has occurred along them . Most notable among these is " Earthquake Fault " , a fissure up to 10 feet ( 3 m ) wide that cuts 60 to 70 feet ( 18 to 21 m ) into glassy rhyolite lava flows . The fissure was formed by stretching induced by the intrusion of the Inyo dike . Stairs to the bottom of the fissure were removed after being damaged by earthquakes in 1980 . Several Mono – Inyo @-@ related explosion pits are on Mammoth Mountain . The Red Cones , south of Mammoth Mountain , are basaltic cinder cones and are the southernmost part of the Mono – Inyo Craters volcanic chain . 
 = = = Climate and ecology = = = 
 The Mono – Inyo Craters are in the Central Basin and Range ecoregion of the North American Desert . The desert environment of Mono Basin receives about 14 inches ( 36 cm ) of precipitation a year . Annual precipitation around Mammoth Lakes , which is close to the Inyo Craters , is about 23 inches ( 58 cm ) . Moisture travels over the Sierra crest from the Pacific Ocean through the San Joaquin Gap . Temperatures in Mono Basin range from average winter lows of 20 to 28 ° F ( − 7 to − 2 ° C ) to average summer highs of 75 to 84 ° F ( 24 to 29 ° C ) . Temperatures near the Inyo Craters and Mammoth Lakes area range from winter average lows of 16 to 21 ° F ( − 9 to − 6 ° C ) to summer average highs of 70 to 78 ° F ( 21 to 26 ° C ) . 
 Most of the surface of the Mono Craters is barren but its slopes are covered by Jeffrey pine forest and partial greenery . Pumice Valley , directly to the west , is covered by sagebrush scrubland . The soil consists primarily of deep pumice , which does not hold water well . Mycorrhizal fungi in the soil invade the roots of Jeffrey pine trees in a symbiotic relationship that helps the pine absorb water and provides nutrients to the fungi . Jeffrey pine forests also surround the Inyo Craters and Mammoth Mountain . Mule deer , coyotes , black bears , yellow @-@ bellied marmots , raccoons and mountain lions all have ranges that are coincident with forests that cover parts of the Mono – Inyo craters . 
 = = = Typical evolution = = = 
 Panum Crater is the northernmost volcano in the sequence and is a good example of both a tuff ring and a rhyolite dome . Its structure is twofold ; an outer tuff ring ( forming a classic crater ) and an inner plug , or dome of rhyolite , pumice and obsidian created from lavas . In this case , heat from the magma feeding Panum flashed groundwater to steam to create the tuff ring before lava reached the surface . Other Mono Craters also were formed in this manner , but their plug domes grew larger than their tuff ring craters . The domes have steep sides and are flanked by slopes of scree consisting of large angular and glass @-@ rich rocks . Devil 's Punch Bowl , located south of the main dome complex , stopped forming at an earlier stage of development . It is a 1 @,@ 200 @-@ foot ( 370 m ) wide and 140 @-@ foot ( 43 m ) deep explosion pit with a much smaller glass dome on its floor . 
 The large North and South Coulee and the smaller Northwest Coulee consist of obsidian @-@ rich rhyolite . They were formed from slow @-@ moving lava that had a thin and brittle crust . Once the flow stopped , it formed steep sided tongues of sharp and angular rock that are typically 200 to 300 feet ( 60 to 90 m ) thick and have scree piles along their base . South Coulee is 2 @.@ 25 miles ( 3 @.@ 6 km ) long , 0 @.@ 75 miles ( 1 @.@ 2 km ) wide and has a volume of 0 @.@ 1 cubic miles ( 0 @.@ 4 km3 ) ; making it the largest Mono Craters coulee in volume . South Coulee originates from the crest of the Mono Domes , about 3 miles ( 5 km ) from the southern end , flows down its east and west flanks and terminates at its foot . North Coulee is nearly as large , flows mostly to the east and terminates in a divided pair of lobes . Northwest Coulee is located northwest of North Coulee and was intruded by Upper Dome after the coulee solidified . Permanent pockets of ice from snowmelt have been found 75 to 147 feet ( 23 to 45 m ) inside the coulees and domes . 
 = = Geology = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 The Mono – Inyo chain of craters lies in east @-@ central California , roughly parallel to the eastern escarpment of the Sierra Nevada mountain range . Volcanism and seismic activity in eastern California are a result of two major geologic processes : northwest movement of the Pacific Plate with respect to the North American Plate along the San Andreas Fault system near the coast , and east – west extension of the crust that formed the Basin and Range Province . In the Long Valley region , where the craters are located , basin and range extension encroaches onto the thick and stable crust of the Sierra Nevada . 
 Basement rock under the Mono – Inyo chain consists of the same granitic and metamorphic rock that make up the Sierra Nevada . Above that layer are basaltic grading to rhyolitic volcanic rocks that are 3 @.@ 5 million to less than 760 @,@ 000 years old . Volcanism occurred north of the chain , in the Bodie Hills , as far back as 28 million years . Nearly all the rock east of the Sierra Nevada in the Mono Basin area is volcanic in origin . 
 Volcanoes erupted from 3 @.@ 6 to 2 @.@ 3 million years ago near what is now Long Valley . <unk> eruptions occurred in and around Glass Mountain in the same area from 2 @.@ 1 to 0 @.@ 8 million years ago . Volcanic ash from the massive ( 600 cubic kilometres or 140 cubic miles of ejecta ) eruption of Long Valley Caldera some 760 @,@ 000 years ago is preserved in the thick Bishop Tuff that covers much of the region . 
 Eruptions of basalt and andesite 400 @,@ 000 to 60 @,@ 000 years ago in the west moat of Long Valley Caldera were the first activity associated with the Mono – Inyo Craters system . Eruptions around 300 @,@ 000 years ago filled the west moat with 800 feet ( 240 m ) of basaltic lava . Basaltic and andesitic eruptive activity then moved to Mono Basin and lasted from 40 @,@ 000 to 13 @,@ 000 years ago . 
 Seismic data indicate that a magma chamber with an estimated volume of 48 to 144 cubic miles ( 200 to 600 km3 ) exists 5 @.@ 0 to 6 @.@ 2 miles ( 8 to 10 km ) directly below the Mono Craters . About 660 feet ( 200 m ) of subsidence has occurred within a ring fracture system centered on Pumice Valley west of the chamber in the last 700 @,@ 000 years . The Mono Craters sit atop a 7 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 12 km ) -long arc on the eastern side of the 11 @-@ mile ( 18 km ) -wide ring @-@ fracture system . Magma feeding the domes may have exploited arc @-@ shaped fissures around an intrusion of granitic rock deep below the chain . This magma chamber is separate from the magma chamber under Long Valley Caldera . The recent eruptions of the Mono Craters have been similar in volume and nearly identical in composition ( " crystal @-@ poor high @-@ silica rhyolite " ) to those of Glass Mountain that preceded the Long Valley Caldera @-@ forming eruption . It has been suggested that the Mono Craters volcanism may represent an early stage in the development of a future caldera . 
 Repeated eruption of dacite and rhyodacite from vents on the southwest rim of the caldera from 220 @,@ 000 to 50 @,@ 000 years ago formed Mammoth Mountain , a volcano composed of overlapping lava domes . Eruptions of dacite and rhyodacite occurred in Mono Basin from 100 @,@ 000 to 6 @,@ 000 years ago . 
 = = = Mono Craters , Negit Island and Black Point = = = 
 Multiple eruptions of silica @-@ rich rhyolite from 40 @,@ 000 to 600 years ago built the Mono Craters . Black Point , today on the north shore of Mono Lake , is a flattened volcanic cone of basaltic debris that formed under the surface of a much deeper Mono Lake about 13 @,@ 300 years ago , during the most @-@ recent glacial period . Several eruptive episodes from 1 @,@ 600 to 270 years before present in Mono Lake formed Negit Island . The magma reservoir feeding the Mono Lake Volcanic Field is unrelated to the Mono Craters magma reservoir . 
 Basaltic andesite lava built the Red Cones , two small cinder cones 6 @.@ 2 miles ( 10 km ) southwest of Mammoth Lakes , around 8 @,@ 500 before present . The five Mammoth Mountain Craters are a set of explosion pits that trend west @-@ north @-@ west for 1 @.@ 6 miles ( 2 @.@ 5 km ) near the northern flank of Mammoth Mountain . 
 None of the Mono Craters near the lake show the effects of wave erosion , but a hill at the southern end of the field shows what Israel Russell called a " beach line " . The present elevation of this beach line is the level of the Mono Lake high stand before the formation of the northern Mono Craters , plus any surface deformation that has happened since that time . Stream @-@ rounded stones are found on the volcanoes , and were lifted up as the volcanoes grew . Although glaciers were present throughout the Sierra Nevada , they did not reach as far down as the Mono Craters . 
 The most recent eruptive episode on the Mono Craters occurred sometime between the years 1325 and 1365 . A vertical sheet @-@ like mass of magma , called a dike , caused groundwater to explosively flash to steam , creating a line of vents 4 miles ( 6 km ) long . A mix of ash and pulverized rock , called tephra , covered about 3 @,@ 000 square miles ( 8 @,@ 000 km2 ) of the Mono Lake region . The tephra were carried by the wind and deposited in a layer 8 inches ( 20 cm ) deep 20 miles ( 32 km ) from the vents and 2 inches ( 5 cm ) deep 50 miles ( 80 km ) away . 
 Pyroclastic flows of hot clouds of gas , ash and pulverized lava erupted from these vents in narrow tongues that extended up to 5 miles ( 8 km ) away and covered 38 square miles ( 100 km2 ) . Rhyolite lava oozed out of the vents to form several steep @-@ sided domes , including Panum Dome and the much larger North Coulee flow . The youngest domes and coulees are 600 to 700 years old and are , therefore , the youngest mountains in North America . 
 = = = Inyo Craters and Paoha Island = = = 
 Eruptions of silica @-@ poor rhyolite from 5 @,@ 000 to 500 years ago created the Inyo Craters . The most recent activity occurred just a few years after the Mono Crater eruptions , and was caused by a dike of similar composition . The dike eventually became 6 @.@ 8 miles ( 11 km ) long and up to 33 feet ( 10 m ) wide . The ground above the dike was significantly cracked and faulted . 
 Explosive eruptions later emanated from three separate vents . Pieces of molten and solid rock were ejected , small craters were formed , and a tall eruption column rose above the vents . Pumice and ash covered an extensive area downwind , and about 1 inch ( 2 @.@ 5 cm ) of tephra was deposited where the town of Mammoth Lakes , California , now sits . A pyroclastic flow from South Deadman vent traveled about 3 @.@ 7 miles ( 6 km ) . 
 Some of the open pits were filled with thick and slow @-@ moving lava to form the South Deadman Creek , Glass Creek and Obsidian Flow domes . Others , such as the Inyo Crater Lakes near Deer Mountain , remained open and were later partially filled with water . Smaller explosion pits on the north side of Mammoth Mountain were also formed at this time . In the past 6 @,@ 000 years , approximately 0 @.@ 19 cubic miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km3 ) of magma has been erupted from the Inyo part of the chain . 
 The last recorded volcanic activity in the chain was at Mono Lake between the years 1720 and 1850 . An intrusion of magma below the lake pushed lakebed sediments upward to form Paoha Island . Exposed rhyolite is on the north part of the island , and a group of seven dacite cinder cones and a lava flow are on the northeastern corner . Steam rose in columns hundreds of feet high ( tens of meters ) from Hot Spring Cove on the island and the spring water was 150 ° F ( 66 ° C ) when geologist Israel Russell visited the island in the early 1880s .

 People have used resources on and around the Mono – Inyo Craters for centuries . Mono Paiutes gathered obsidian from the Mono – Inyo Craters to make sharp tools and arrow points . <unk> obsidian was carried by the Mono Paiutes over passes in the Sierra Nevada to trade with other Native American groups . Chips of Mono – Inyo obsidian can still be found at many ancient mountain campsites . 
 Gold rush – related boomtowns sprang up near Mono Basin in the 19th century to exploit <unk> . The largest of these , Bodie ( north of Mono Lake ) , was founded in the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill , which was located at Mono Mills , immediately northeast of Mono Domes . Trees directly around the domes and on their slopes were felled to provide timber for the mill . 
 As part of the California Water Wars , the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power purchased large tracts of land in the 1930s within Mono Basin and Owens Valley in order to control water rights . Excavation of an 11 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 18 @.@ 5 km ) water tunnel under the southern part of the Mono Craters dome complex started in 1934 and was completed in 1941 . Tunnel workers had to deal with loose and often water @-@ charged gravels , pockets of carbon dioxide gas and flooding . About one man was lost for each mile excavated . Water diverted from its natural outlet in Mono Lake passes through the tunnel on its way to the Los Angeles Aqueduct system . 
 The United States Pumice Company , based in Chatsworth , California , has mined the area for pumice since 1941 . The company markets the pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring and in large irregular chunks sold as yard decoration . 
 Exploratory drilling for geothermal power occurred near the Mono Craters on the south shore of Mono Lake in 1971 . The wells did not show promising results , so the effort was abandoned .

 The chain of craters has been the subject of several writers and naturalists . Mark Twain visited Mono Basin in the 1860s and wrote about Mono Lake , but did not mention any of the Mono – Inyo Craters except for the lake 's two volcanic islands . He wrote in <unk> It ( 1872 ) that the lake was in a " lifeless , hideous desert ... " that was the " loneliest spot on earth ... little graced with the picturesque . " 
 Naturalist John Muir explored the area in 1869 . He described the " Mono Desert " as a " ... country of wonderful contrasts . Hot deserts bounded by snow @-@ laden mountains , — cinders and ashes scattered on glacier @-@ polished pavements , — frost and fire working together in the making of beauty . In the lake are several volcanic islands , which show that the waters were once mingled with fire . " Muir described the Mono Craters as " ... heaps of loose ashes that have never been blest by either rain or snow ... " 
 In the spring of 1881 and the fall of 1882 , geologist Israel Russell studied the area as a side @-@ trip during his field research of Lake Lahontan , a now dry lake that covered much of nearby Nevada during the last glacial period . His Quaternary History of the Mono Valley ( 1889 ) , which included a topographic survey by Willard D. Johnson , was the first thorough scientific description of Mono Lake and its volcanic features . 
 Russell named the Mono Craters and wrote : " The attention of every one who enters Mono Valley is at once attracted by the soft , pleasing colors of these craters as well as by the symmetry and beauty of their forms . They are exceptional features in the scenery of the region , and are rendered all the more striking by their proximity to the angular peaks and rugged outlines of the High Sierra . " 
 = = = Protection and monitoring = = = 
 The creation of Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area in 1984 stopped any further geothermal prospecting . Mono Basin was the first National Scenic Area in the United States . It offers more protection than other United States Forest Service lands , surrounds Mono Lake and its two volcanic islands , Black Point , Panum Crater and much of the northern half of the Mono Craters . Litigation and outreach by the Mono Lake Committee , the National Audubon Society and other conservation groups has helped to slow water diversions from tributaries feeding Mono Lake . 
 A series of earthquakes inside Long Valley Caldera , coincidentally starting two weeks after the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington , alerted geologists to the possibility of renewed volcanic activity in the region . Four magnitude 6 earthquakes struck the southern margin of Long Valley Caldera in an area that was close to the Mono – Inyo fissure system . The caldera floor had also uplifted by 10 inches ( 30 cm ) in five years . Upward movement of magma under the caldera was thought to be the cause of the earthquakes and uplift . 
 Persistent earthquake swarms in 1982 prompted the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) to issue a " potential volcanic hazard " notice for Long Valley . That same year , permanent monitoring of the area by the Long Valley Observatory started . The hazard notice was lifted in 1984 after USGS scientists concluded that magma had been injected into fissures below Mammoth Mountain but had congealed underground . From 1990 to 1996 , 150 acres ( 60 ha ) of trees were killed on Mammoth Mountain by 20 % to 95 % concentrations of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) in the soil ( less than 1 % is normal ) . Chemical analysis of the CO2 indicated it was derived from magma . 
 = = Volcanic hazards = = 
 The Long Valley to Mono Lake region is one of three areas in California that are in the United States Geological Survey 's volcanic hazards program . These areas are in the program because they have been active in the last 2 @,@ 000 years and have the ability to produce explosive eruptions . 
 About 20 eruptions have occurred on the Mono – Inyo Craters chain at intervals of 250 to 700 years during the past 5 @,@ 000 years . Seismic soundings and lava composition indicate that these eruptions most likely originated from discrete and small magma bodies . The rate of eruption over the last 1 @,@ 000 years has increased , with at least 12 eruptions occurring . 
 All eruptions in the past 5 @,@ 000 years from the Mono – Inyo Craters have expelled less than 0 @.@ 24 cubic miles ( 1 km3 ) of magma . Future eruptions in the area will likely be similar in size to the small to moderate events of the past 5 @,@ 000 years . There is a one in 200 chance ( 0 @.@ 5 % ) per year of an eruption occurring along the chain . An eruption in the foreseeable future is probably more likely along the Mono – Inyo chain than an unrelated eruption inside Long Valley Caldera . 
 = = = Effects = = = 
 A wide range of effects are expected from future eruptions along the Mono – Inyo Craters . Ash and rock fragments ( tephra ) may accumulate to a thickness of 33 feet ( 10 m ) near an erupting Mono – Inyo vent . Downwind accumulations of tephra may exceed 7 @.@ 9 inches ( 20 cm ) at a distance of 22 miles ( 35 km ) and 2 @.@ 0 inches ( 5 cm ) at 53 miles ( 85 km ) . Winds in the area tend to blow toward an east or northeasterly direction more than 50 percent of the time , and toward any easterly direction more than 80 percent of the time . Grain size and thickness of tephra generally decreases gradually with distance from a vent . Volcanic ash will likely contaminate air routes east of the vent . 
 Severe damage from super @-@ heated flows of gas , ash and pulverized rock ( pyroclastic flows and surges ) may occur at least 9 @.@ 3 miles ( 15 km ) from an explosive eruption . The amount of damage depends on vent location , topography , and volume of magma erupted . Pyroclastic flows from vents on Mammoth Mountain or other high vent could travel farther by gaining extra momentum from their descent . Valleys along the route will be more impacted than ridges but flows and surges could overtop some ridges . Eruptions near <unk> may produce lahars of mud and ash that devastate valleys and watersheds . Steam blast eruptions under a lake could form large waves capable of flooding nearby areas and starting mudflows . 
 Basalt lava flows may extend more than 31 miles ( 50 km ) from their vent . Dacite and rhyolite lavas produce short , thick flows that rarely extend more than 3 @.@ 1 miles ( 5 km ) from their vent . Mound @-@ shaped features called lava domes are often created from these flows . Rock fragments thrown from a growing lava dome may reach 3 @.@ 1 to 6 @.@ 2 miles ( 5 to 10 km ) from the dome . A partial collapse of the steep @-@ sided growing dome can send pyroclastic flows outward at least 3 @.@ 1 miles ( 5 km ) . Taller domes tend to form larger pyroclastic flows that travel farther .

 Many recreational activities are available along the chain . The Mono Basin National Scenic Area visitor center is located near Mono Lake just off U.S. Route 395 . A bookstore , an information desk staffed by USDA Forest Service Rangers , and museum exhibits help to orient visitors . The Mono Lake Committee has a staffed office and visitor information center in Lee Vining on the corner of U.S. Route 395 and 3rd Street . Information on camping , hiking , guided and self @-@ guided tours can all be obtained at either location . 
 U.S. 395 is a scenic route that roughly parallels the Mono – Inyo Craters volcanic chain . California State Route 120 provides access to the northern and eastern parts of the Mono Domes , including Panum Crater . Mammoth Scenic Loop ( also called Dry Creek Road ) , provides access to the Inyo Crater lakes and some of the Inyo domes . 
 The town of Mammoth Lakes , located near the southern end of the chain and Mammoth Mountain , is the largest populated area nearby .

 HMS Duke of Edinburgh was the lead ship of the Duke of Edinburgh @-@ class armoured cruisers built for the Royal Navy in the mid @-@ 1900s . She was stationed in the Mediterranean when the First World War began and participated in the pursuit of the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben and light cruiser SMS Breslau . After the German ships reached Ottoman waters , the ship was sent to the Red Sea in mid @-@ August to protect troop convoys arriving from India . Duke of Edinburgh was transferred to the Grand Fleet in December 1914 and participated in the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 . She was not damaged during the battle and was the only ship of her squadron to survive . She was eventually transferred to the Atlantic Ocean in August 1917 for convoy escort duties . 
 The ship was sold for scrap in 1920 .

 Duke of Edinburgh displaced 12 @,@ 590 long tons ( 12 @,@ 790 t ) as built and 13 @,@ 965 long tons ( 14 @,@ 189 t ) fully loaded . The ship had an overall length of 505 feet 6 inches ( 154 @.@ 1 m ) , a beam of 73 feet 6 inches ( 22 @.@ 4 m ) and a draught of 27 feet ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) . She was powered by four @-@ cylinder triple @-@ expansion steam engines , driving two shafts , which produced a total of 23 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 17 @,@ 150 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) . The engines were powered by 20 Babcock & Wilcox water @-@ tube boilers and six cylindrical boilers . The ship carried a maximum of 2 @,@ 150 long tons ( 2 @,@ 180 t ) of coal and an additional 600 long tons ( 610 t ) of fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate . At full capacity , she could steam for 8 @,@ 130 nautical miles ( 15 @,@ 060 km ; 9 @,@ 360 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) .

 = = History = = 
 Duke of Edinburgh was ordered under the 1902 / 1903 naval construction programme as the lead ship of her class . She was laid down on 11 February 1903 at Pembroke Royal Dockyard in Wales . She was launched on 14 June 1904 and completed on 20 January 1906 at a cost of £ <unk> of Edinburgh was named after Alfred , Duke of Edinburgh , one of Queen Victoria 's sons . 
 The ship was assigned to the 5th Cruiser Squadron from 1906 to 1908 and was then transferred to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet . When the Royal Navy 's cruiser squadrons were reorganized in 1909 , Duke of Edinburgh rejoined the 5th Cruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet . She helped to rescue the survivors of the SS Delhi which ran aground off the coast of Morocco in December 1911 . From 1913 to 1914 she served with the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet . 
 When the British began to prepare for war in July 1914 , the ship was refitting at Malta . Her refit was cut short and she joined the rest of her squadron in the southern approaches to the Adriatic . She was involved in the pursuit of the German battlecruiser Goeben and light cruiser Breslau at the outbreak of World War I , but was ordered not to engage them . On 10 August Duke of Edinburgh and her sister ship HMS Black Prince were ordered to the Red Sea to protect troop convoys arriving from India . While on that duty the ship captured the German merchantman Altair of 3 @,@ 200 tons GRT on 15 August . While escorting a troop convoy from India to France in November 1914 , Duke of Edinburgh provided cover to three battalions of infantry that seized the Turkish fort at Cheikh Saïd at the entrance to the Red Sea . The ship then landed a demolition party , which blew the fort up on 10 November ; she then rejoined the convoy . 
 Duke of Edinburgh rejoined the 1st Cruiser Squadron , which had been transferred to the Grand Fleet in the meantime , in December 1914 . In March 1916 the ship had her main deck 6 @-@ inch guns removed and the openings plated over . Six of the guns were remounted on the upper deck , three on each side , between the wing turrets , protected by gun shields . At the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916 , the 1st Cruiser Squadron was in front of the Grand Fleet , on the right side . At 5 : 47 p.m. The two leading ships of the squadron , the flagship , HMS Defence , and HMS Warrior , spotted the German II Scouting Group and opened fire . Their shells felt short and the two ships turned to port in pursuit , cutting in front of the battlecruiser HMS Lion , which was forced to turn away to avoid a collision . Duke of Edinburgh could not follow the first two ships and turned to port ( northeast ) . The ship spotted the disabled German light cruiser SMS Wiesbaden at 6 : 08 and fired twenty rounds at her . By about 6 : 30 she had steamed to a position off the starboard bow of HMS King George V , the leading ship of the 2nd Battle Squadron , where her funnel smoke obscured the German ships from the foremost dreadnoughts of the 2nd Battle Squadron . A torpedo attack by German destroyers on Admiral Beatty 's battlecruisers , failed , but forced Duke of Edinburgh to evade one torpedo at 6 : 47 . The ship reported a submarine sighting at 7 : 01 , although no German submarines were operating in the area . She fired at another false submarine contact between 7 : 45 and 8 : 15 . 
 After the battle , Duke of Edinburgh was attached to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron and remained at sea until 2 June , searching for disabled ships . She arrived in Scapa Flow on the afternoon of 3 June . On the evening of 18 August 1916 , the Grand Fleet , including Duke of Edinburgh , put to sea in response to a deciphered message that the High Seas Fleet , minus the II Battle Squadron , would be leaving harbour that night . The Germans planned to bombard the port of Sunderland on 19 August , with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines . The Germans broke off their planned attack to pursue a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship , which was in fact the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt . Realising their mistake , the Germans then set course for home . After Jutland the 2nd Cruiser Squadron , now including Duke of Edinburgh , was ordered to reinforce the patrols north of the Shetland Islands against German blockade runners and commerce raiders . The ship 's foremast was converted to a tripod to support the weight of a fire @-@ control director in May 1917 , but when the director was actually fitted is not known . Two more 6 @-@ inch guns were added in embrasures on the forecastle deck during that same refit . She was transferred to the North America and West Indies Station in August 1917 for convoy escort duties , where she remained for the duration of the war . Upon her return , Duke of Edinburgh was stationed in the Humber , before she was sold for scrap on 12 April 1920 and broken up at Blyth in Northumberland .

 " A Single Blade of Grass " is the fifth episode of the second season of the American crime @-@ thriller television series Millennium . It premiered on the Fox network on October 24 , 1997 . The episode was written by Kay Reindl and Erin Maher , and directed by Rodman Flender . " A Single Blade of Grass " featured guest appearances by Floyd Red Crow Westerman and Michael <unk> . 
 Millennium centers on offender profiler Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) , who investigates unusual crimes as part of the private investigative organisation the Millennium Group . In this episode , Black investigates the murder of a Native American man , finding a cult who wish to bring about the end of American civilization . 
 " A Single Blade of Grass " was the first episode of the series to have been penned by Reindl and Maher . It received mixed responses from critics , and was viewed by approximately 6 @.@ 57 million households upon its initial broadcast . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In New York City , a young Native American man is forced by several others to ingest snake venom . The venom causes him to hallucinate , and one of the men , Joe Reynard ( Michael <unk> ) asks him to describe his visions . However , the poisoned man screams in agony and dies . His body is later found when a construction site is being excavated by archaeologists . A mummified body from centuries earlier is also found ; when Millennium Group member Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) arrives to investigate , he notices similarities between both corpses . The archaeologist in charge of the dig , Liz Michaels ( Amy Steel ) is adamant that the site should stay intact for further excavation , but foreman Richard Powell ( Garry Chalk ) and his mostly Native American crew insist building must continue . 
 Black believes the killing took place in a hotel basement ; finding the crime scene , he consults Michaels , who notes that symbols painted on the walls come from several different native cultures but all concern communication with the spirit world . Black visits a bar frequented by the native construction workers and their elderly mentor ( Floyd Red Crow Westerman ) . Reynard is among their number ; Black asks him about one of the symbols , and is told by the old man that the symbol is an ominous warning . After Black leaves , Reynard tells the others that he " is the one " . 
 The dead man is autopsied ; his corpse had been dismembered and reconstructed . Michaels notes that this is a Seneca ritual aimed at reviving the dead to learn of spiritual matters . Later , Black and Michaels are called the construction site , where Powell is attempting to package and remove the ancient remains . Reynard and Powell begin fighting ; the latter soon dies of a heart attack . When Black returns to his car , he finds a native face mask placed inside ; Michaels explains that it represents the ability to cross from the material world into the spirit world . Black believes a secret native tribe is awaiting the downfall and apocalypse of the society of the white settlers ; he theorizes that they believe his abilities are key to their prophecies of the end of the world . 
 That night , Black is kidnapped by the group of natives . He is taken to the sewers and forced to consume snake venom ; he sees visions , but insists they are from his psychic gift rather than from the venom . He predicts that the native tribes will reunite and that the buffalo will return to New York . However , he is soon rescued by Michaels and a group of police , who place Reynard and his tribe under arrest . As the tribe — now reunited in police custody — are led away , a travelling rodeo loses track of four buffalo , which run free through the city streets .

 " A Single Blade of Grass " is the first episode of Millennium to have been written by Kay Reindl and Erin Maher ; the pair would pen two further episodes in the second season , and another in the third season . The episode was the only contribution to the series by director Rodman Flender . 
 The episode featured the return of Black 's near @-@ psychic visions ; a phenomenon which had been used with much less frequency in the second season . Executive producer Glen Morgan begrudgingly allowed Maher and Reindl to show the ability in this episode , saying " I felt last year those visions were a cheat . The camera would go to a coffee cup and Frank would say , ' The murderer used a coffee cup . ' It drove me nuts . What we were trying to do this year was elevate Frank 's visions to a dream @-@ like state , so he would have to interpret what he 's seeing . There would be more mystical , symbolic imagery that might give him more of a sense of what 's going on . I had wanted to strip away the gift for a long time and see if the show really played without it . But we got back into that " .

VanDerWerff felt that although the episode contained several plot holes , it worked with " a kind of dream sense , following its own weird , nightmare logic " . Bill Gibron , writing for DVD Talk , rated the episode 3 @.@ 5 out of 5 . Gibron found that the episode contained several overly @-@ unbelievable moments but was overall " another great episode , even with some rather minor flaws " . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated " A Single Blade of Grass " one star out of five .

 = Primate = 
 A primate ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ <unk> ) is a mammal of the order Primates ( Latin : " prime , first rank " ) . In taxonomy , primates include two distinct lineages , strepsirrhines and haplorhines . Primates arose from ancestors that lived in the trees of tropical forests ; many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challenging three @-@ dimensional environment . Most primate species remain at least partly arboreal . 
 With the exception of humans , who inhabit every continent except for Antarctica , most primates live in tropical or subtropical regions of the Americas , Africa and Asia . They range in size from Madame Berthe 's mouse lemur , which weighs only 30 g ( 1 oz ) , to the eastern gorilla , weighing over 200 kg ( 440 lb ) . Based on fossil evidence , the earliest known true primates , represented by the genus Teilhardina , date to 55 @.@ 8 million years old . An early close primate relative known from abundant remains is the Late Paleocene <unk> , c . 55 – 58 million years old . Molecular clock studies suggest that the primate branch may be even older , originating near the Cretaceous – Paleogene boundary or around 63 – 74 mya . 
 The order Primates was traditionally divided into two main groupings : prosimians and anthropoids ( simians ) . Prosimians have characteristics more like those of the earliest primates , and include the lemurs of Madagascar , lorisoids , and tarsiers . Simians include monkeys , apes and hominins . More recently , taxonomists have preferred to split primates into the suborder Strepsirrhini , or wet @-@ nosed primates , consisting of non @-@ tarsier prosimians , and the suborder Haplorhini , or dry @-@ nosed primates , consisting of tarsiers and the simians . 
 Simians are divided into two groups : catarrhine ( narrow @-@ nosed ) monkeys and apes of Africa and southeastern Asia and <unk> ( " flat @-@ nosed " ) or New World monkeys of South and Middle America . <unk> consist of Old World monkeys ( such as baboons and macaques ) , gibbons and great apes ; New World monkeys include the capuchin , howler and squirrel monkeys . Humans are the only extant catarrhines to have spread successfully outside of Africa , South Asia , and East Asia , although fossil evidence shows many other species were formerly present in Europe . New primate species are still being discovered . More than 25 species were taxonomically described in the decade of the 2000s and eleven have been described since 2010 . 
 Considered generalist mammals , primates exhibit a wide range of characteristics . Some primates ( including some great apes and baboons ) are primarily terrestrial rather than arboreal , but all species possess adaptations for climbing trees . Locomotion techniques used include leaping from tree to tree , walking on two or four limbs , knuckle @-@ walking , and swinging between branches of trees ( brachiation ) . 
 Primates are characterized by large brains relative to other mammals , as well as an increased reliance on stereoscopic vision at the expense of smell , the dominant sensory system in most mammals . These features are more developed in monkeys and apes and noticeably less so in lorises and lemurs . Three @-@ color vision has developed in some primates . Most also have opposable thumbs and some have prehensile tails . Many species are sexually dimorphic ; differences include body mass , canine tooth size , and coloration . Primates have slower rates of development than other similarly sized mammals and reach maturity later , but have longer lifespans . Depending on the species , adults may live in solitude , in mated pairs , or in groups of up to hundreds of members . 
 = = Historical and modern terminology = = 
 The relationships among the different groups of primates were not clearly understood until relatively recently , so the commonly used terms are somewhat confused . For example , " ape " has been used either as an alternative for " monkey " or for any tailless , relatively human @-@ like primate . 
 Sir Wilfrid Le Gros Clark was one of the primatologists who developed the idea of trends in primate evolution and the methodology of arranging the living members of an order into an " ascending series " leading to humans . Commonly used names for groups of primates such as " prosimians " , " monkeys " , " lesser apes " , and " great apes " reflect this methodology . According to our current understanding of the evolutionary history of the primates , several of these groups are paraphyletic : a paraphyletic group is one which does not include all the descendants of the group 's common ancestor . 
 In contrast with Clark 's methodology , modern classifications typically identify ( or name ) only those groupings that are monophyletic ; that is , such a named group includes all the descendants of the group 's common ancestor . 
 The cladogram below shows one possible classification sequence of the living primates , with groups that use common ( traditional ) names are shown on the right . 
 All groups with scientific names are monophyletic ( that is , they are clades ) , and the sequence of scientific classification reflects the evolutionary history of the related lineages . Traditionally named groups are shown on the right ; they form an " ascending series " ( per Clark , see above ) , and several groups are paraphyletic : 
 " prosimians " contain two monophyletic groups ( the suborder Strepsirrhini , or lemurs , lorises and allies , as well as the tarsiers of the suborder Haplorhini ) ; it is a paraphyletic grouping because it excludes the Simiiformes , which also are descendants of the common ancestor Primates . 
 " monkeys " comprise two monophyletic groups , New World monkeys and Old World monkeys , but is paraphyletic because it excludes hominoids , superfamily Hominoidea , also descendants of the common ancestor Simiiformes . 
 " apes " as a whole , and the " great apes " in particular , are paraphyletic because they exclude humans . 
 Thus , the members of the two sets of groups , and hence names , do not match , which causes problems in relating scientific names to common ( usually traditional ) names . Consider the superfamily Hominoidea : In terms of the common names on the right , this group consists of apes and humans and there is no single common name for all the members of the group . One remedy is to create a new common name , in this case " hominoids " . Another possibility is to expand the use of one of the traditional names . For example , in his 2005 book , the vertebrate palaeontologist Benton wrote , " The apes , Hominoidea , today include the gibbons and orang @-@ utan ... the gorilla and chimpanzee ... and humans " ; thereby Benton was using " apes " to mean " hominoids " . In that case , the group heretofore called " apes " must now be identified as the " non @-@ human apes " . 
 As of 2005 , there is no consensus as to which methodology will rule , whether to accept traditional ( that is , common ) , but paraphyletic , names or to use monophyletic names only ; or to use ' new ' common names or adaptations of old ones . Both competing approaches will be found in biological sources , often in the same work , and sometimes by the same author . Thus , Benton defines " apes " to include humans , then he repeatedly uses " ape @-@ like " to mean " like an ape rather than a human " ; and when discussing the reaction of others to a new fossil he writes of " claims that Orrorin ... was an ape rather than a human " . 
 = = Classification of living primates = = 
 A list of the families of the living primates is given below , together with one possible classification into ranks between order and family . Other classifications are also used . For example , an alternative classification of the living Strepsirrhini divides them into two infraorders , Lemuriformes and Lorisiformes .

 Superfamily Hominoidea 
 Family <unk> : gibbons or " lesser apes " ( 17 species ) 
 Family Hominidae : great apes , including humans ( 7 species ) 
 Order Primates was established by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 , in the tenth edition of his book Systema Naturae , for the genera Homo ( humans ) , Simia ( other apes and monkeys ) , Lemur ( prosimians ) and <unk> ( bats ) . In the first edition of the same book ( 1735 ) , he had used the name Anthropomorpha for Homo , Simia and Bradypus ( sloths ) . In 1839 , Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville , following Linnaeus and imitating his nomenclature , established the orders <unk> ( including the suborders <unk> , Insectivora and Carnivora ) , <unk> ( or Glires ) and <unk> ( including <unk> , <unk> and Ruminantia ) , but these new taxa were not accepted . 
 Before Anderson and Jones introduced the classification of Strepsirrhini and Haplorhini in 1984 , ( followed by McKenna and Bell 's 1997 work Classification of Mammals : Above the species level ) , the Primates were divided into two superfamilies : Prosimii and Anthropoidea . Prosimii included all of the prosimians : Strepsirrhini plus the tarsiers . Anthropoidea contained all of the simians . 
 = = Evolutionary history = = 
 Order Primates is part of the clade Euarchontoglires , which is nested within the clade Eutheria of Class Mammalia . Recent molecular genetic research on primates , colugos , and treeshrews has shown that the two species of colugos are more closely related to primates than to treeshrews , even though treeshrews were at one time considered primates . These three orders make up the clade Euarchonta . The combination of this clade with the clade Glires ( composed of Rodentia and Lagomorpha ) forms the clade Euarchontoglires . Variously , both Euarchonta and Euarchontoglires are ranked as superorders . Some scientists consider <unk> to be a suborder of Primates and use the suborder <unk> for the " true " primates . 
 = = = Evolution = = = 
 The primate lineage is thought to go back at least 65 million years ago ( mya ) , even though the oldest known primates from the fossil record date to the Late Paleocene of Africa ( Altiatlasius ) or the Paleocene @-@ Eocene transition in the northern continents , c . 55 mya ( Cantius , Donrussellia , <unk> , and Teilhardina ) . Other studies , including molecular clock studies , have estimated the origin of the primate branch to have been in the mid @-@ Cretaceous period , around 85 mya . 
 By modern cladistic reckoning , the order Primates is monophyletic . The suborder Strepsirrhini , the " wet @-@ nosed " primates , is generally thought to have split off from the primitive primate line about 63 mya , although earlier dates are also supported . The seven strepsirrhine families are the five related lemur families and the two remaining families that include the lorisids and the galagos . Older classification schemes wrap Lepilemuridae into Lemuridae and Galagidae into Lorisidae , yielding a four @-@ one family distribution instead of five @-@ two as presented here . During the Eocene , most of the northern continents were dominated by two groups , the adapiforms and the omomyids . The former are considered members of Strepsirrhini , but did not have a toothcomb like modern lemurs ; recent analysis has demonstrated that Darwinius masillae fits into this grouping . The latter was closely related to tarsiers , monkeys , and apes . How these two groups relate to extant primates is unclear . <unk> perished about 30 mya , while adapiforms survived until about 10 mya . 
 According to genetic studies , the lemurs of Madagascar diverged from the lorisoids approximately 75 mya . These studies , as well as chromosomal and molecular evidence , also show that lemurs are more closely related to each other than to other strepsirrhine primates . However , Madagascar split from Africa 160 mya and from India 90 mya . To account for these facts , a founding lemur population of a few individuals is thought to have reached Madagascar from Africa via a single rafting event between 50 and 80 mya . Other colonization options have been examined , such as multiple colonizations from Africa and India , but none are supported by the genetic and molecular evidence . 
 Until recently , the aye @-@ aye has been difficult to place within Strepsirrhini . Theories had been proposed that its family , Daubentoniidae , was either a lemuriform primate ( meaning its ancestors split from the lemur line more recently than lemurs and lorises split ) or a sister group to all the other strepsirrhines . In 2008 , the aye @-@ aye family was confirmed to be most closely related to the other Malagasy lemurs , likely having descended from the same ancestral population that colonized the island . 
 Suborder Haplorhini , the simple @-@ nosed or " dry @-@ nosed " primates , is composed of two sister clades . <unk> tarsiers in the family Tarsiidae ( monotypic in its own infraorder Tarsiiformes ) , represent the most basal division , originating about 58 mya . The earliest known haplorhine skeleton , that of 55 MA old tarsier @-@ like <unk> , was found in central China , supporting an already suspected Asian origin for the group . The infraorder Simiiformes ( simian primates , consisting of monkeys and apes ) emerged about 40 mya , possibly also in Asia ; if so , they dispersed across the Tethys Sea from Asia to Africa soon afterwards . There are two simian clades , both parvorders : Catarrhini , which developed in Africa , consisting of Old World monkeys , humans and the other apes , and Platyrrhini , which developed in South America , consisting of New World monkeys . A third clade , which included the eosimiids , developed in Asia , but became extinct millions of years ago . 
 As in the case of lemurs , the origin of New World monkeys is unclear . Molecular studies of concatenated nuclear sequences have yielded a widely varying estimated date of divergence between platyrrhines and catarrhines , ranging from 33 to 70 mya , while studies based on mitochondrial sequences produce a narrower range of 35 to 43 mya . The anthropoid primates possibly traversed the Atlantic Ocean from Africa to South America during the Eocene by island hopping , facilitated by Atlantic Ocean ridges and a lowered sea level . Alternatively , a single rafting event may explain this transoceanic colonization . Due to continental drift , the Atlantic Ocean was not nearly as wide at the time as it is today . Research suggests that a small 1 kg ( 2 @.@ 2 lb ) primate could have survived 13 days on a raft of vegetation . Given estimated current and wind speeds , this would have provided enough time to make the voyage between the continents . 
 Apes and monkeys spread from Africa into Europe and Asia starting in the Miocene . Soon after , the lorises and tarsiers made the same journey . The first hominin fossils were discovered in northern Africa and date back 5 – 8 mya . Old World monkeys disappeared from Europe about 1 @.@ 8 mya . Molecular and fossil studies generally show that modern humans originated in Africa 100 @,@ 000 – 200 @,@ 000 years ago . 
 Although primates are well studied in comparison to other animal groups , several new species have been discovered recently , and genetic tests have revealed previously unrecognised species in known populations . Primate Taxonomy listed about 350 species of primates in 2001 ; the author , Colin Groves , increased that number to 376 for his contribution to the third edition of Mammal Species of the World ( MSW3 ) . However , publications since the taxonomy in MSW3 was compiled in 2003 have pushed the number to 424 species , or 658 including subspecies . 
 = = = Hybrids = = = 
 Primate hybrids usually arise in captivity , but there have also been examples in the wild . Hybridization occurs where two species ' range overlap to form hybrid zones ; hybrids may be created by humans when animals are placed in zoos or due to environmental pressures such as predation . <unk> hybridizations , hybrids of different genera , have also been found in the wild . Although they belong to genera that have been distinct for several million years , interbreeding still occurs between the gelada and the hamadryas baboon . 
 = = Anatomy , physiology , and morphology = = 
 Primates have forward @-@ facing eyes on the front of the skull ; binocular vision allows accurate distance perception , useful for the <unk> ancestors of all great apes . A bony ridge above the eye sockets reinforces weaker bones in the face , which are put under strain during chewing . Strepsirrhines have a postorbital bar , a bone around the eye socket , to protect their eyes ; in contrast , the higher primates , haplorhines , have evolved fully enclosed sockets . 
 The primate skull has a large , domed cranium , which is particularly prominent in anthropoids . The cranium protects the large brain , a distinguishing characteristic of this group . The endocranial volume ( the volume within the skull ) is three times greater in humans than in the greatest nonhuman primate , reflecting a larger brain size . The mean endocranial volume is 1 @,@ 201 cubic centimeters in humans , 469 cm3 in gorillas , 400 cm3 in chimpanzees and 397 cm3 in orangutans . The primary evolutionary trend of primates has been the elaboration of the brain , in particular the neocortex ( a part of the cerebral cortex ) , which is involved with sensory perception , generation of motor commands , spatial reasoning , conscious thought and , in humans , language . While other mammals rely heavily on their sense of smell , the arboreal life of primates has led to a tactile , visually dominant sensory system , a reduction in the olfactory region of the brain and increasingly complex social behavior . 
 Primates generally have five digits on each limb ( <unk> ) , with keratin nails on the end of each finger and toe . The bottom sides of the hands and feet have sensitive pads on the fingertips . Most have opposable thumbs , a characteristic primate feature , though not limited to this order , ( opossums and koalas , for example , also have them ) . Thumbs allow some species to use tools . In primates , the combination of opposing thumbs , short fingernails ( rather than claws ) and long , inward @-@ closing fingers is a relict of the ancestral practice of gripping branches , and has , in part , allowed some species to develop brachiation ( swinging by the arms from tree limb to tree limb ) as a significant means of locomotion . Prosimians have <unk> nails on the second toe of each foot , called toilet @-@ claws , which they use for grooming . 
 The primate collar bone is retained as prominent element of the pectoral girdle ; this allows the shoulder joint broad mobility . Apes have more mobile shoulder joints and arms due to the dorsal position of the scapula , broad <unk> that are flatter front @-@ to @-@ back , and a shorter , less mobile spine compared to Old World monkeys ( with lower vertebrae greatly reduced , resulting in tail loss in some species ) . Old World monkeys are unlike apes in that most have tails . New World <unk> , including the howler , spider , woolly spider and woolly monkeys , and New World capuchins have prehensile tails . Male primates typically have a pendulous penis and scrotal testes . 
 Primates show an evolutionary trend towards a reduced snout . Technically , Old World monkeys are distinguished from New World monkeys by the structure of the nose , and from apes by the arrangement of their teeth . In New World monkeys , the nostrils face sideways ; in Old World monkeys , they face downwards . Dental pattern in primates vary considerably ; although some have lost most of their incisors , all retain at least one lower incisor . In most strepsirrhines , the lower incisors and canines form a toothcomb , which is used in grooming and sometimes foraging , and the first lower premolar is shaped like a canine . Old World monkeys have eight premolars , compared with 12 in New World monkeys . The Old World species are divided into apes and monkeys depending on the number of cusps on their molars ; apes have five , Old World monkeys have four , although humans may have four or five . The main hominid molar cusp ( hypocone ) evolved in early primate history , while the cusp of the corresponding primitive lower molar ( paraconid ) was lost . Prosimians are distinguished by their immobilized upper lips , the moist tip of their noses and forward @-@ facing lower front teeth . 
 The evolution of color vision in primates is unique among most eutherian mammals . While the remote vertebrate ancestors of the primates possessed three color vision ( <unk> ) , the nocturnal , warm @-@ blooded , mammalian ancestors lost one of three cones in the retina during the Mesozoic era . Fish , reptiles and birds are therefore trichromatic or <unk> , while all mammals , with the exception of some primates and marsupials , are dichromats or <unk> ( totally color blind ) . Nocturnal primates , such as the night monkeys and bush babies , are often monochromatic . <unk> are routinely trichromatic due to a gene duplication of the red @-@ green opsin gene at the base of their lineage , 30 to 40 million years ago . <unk> , on the other hand , are trichromatic in a few cases only . Specifically , individual females must be heterozygous for two alleles of the opsin gene ( red and green ) located on the same locus of the X chromosome . Males , therefore , can only be dichromatic , while females can be either dichromatic or trichromatic . Color vision in strepsirrhines is not as well understood ; however , research indicates a range of color vision similar to that found in platyrrhines . 
 Like catarrhines , howler monkeys ( a family of platyrrhines ) show routine <unk> that has been traced to an evolutionarily recent gene duplication . <unk> monkeys are one of the most specialized leaf @-@ eaters of the New World monkeys ; fruits are not a major part of their diets , and the type of leaves they prefer to consume ( young , nutritive , and digestible ) are detectable only by a red @-@ green signal . Field work exploring the dietary preferences of howler monkeys suggests that routine <unk> was selected by environment . 
 = = = Sexual dimorphism = = = 
 Sexual dimorphism is often exhibited in simians , though to a greater degree in Old World species ( apes and some monkeys ) than New World species . Recent studies involve comparing DNA to examine both the variation in the expression of the dimorphism among primates and the fundamental causes of sexual dimorphism . Primates usually have dimorphism in body mass and canine tooth size along with pelage and skin color . The dimorphism can be attributed to and affected by different factors , including mating system , size , habitat and diet . 
 Comparative analyses have generated a more complete understanding of the relationship between sexual selection , natural selection , and mating systems in primates . Studies have shown that dimorphism is the product of changes in both male and female traits . <unk> scaling , where relative extension of a common growth trajectory occurs , may give some insight into the relationship between sexual dimorphism and growth patterns . Some evidence from the fossil record suggests that there was convergent evolution of dimorphism , and some extinct hominids probably had greater dimorphism than any living primate . 
 = = = Locomotion = = = 
 Primate species move by brachiation , bipedalism , leaping , arboreal and terrestrial quadrupedalism , climbing , knuckle @-@ walking or by a combination of these methods . Several prosimians are primarily vertical clingers and leapers . These include many bushbabies , all indriids ( i.e. , sifakas , <unk> and <unk> ) , sportive lemurs , and all tarsiers . Other prosimians are arboreal quadrupeds and climbers . Some are also terrestrial quadrupeds , while some are leapers . Most monkeys are both arboreal and terrestrial quadrupeds and climbers . Gibbons , muriquis and spider monkeys all brachiate extensively , with gibbons sometimes doing so in remarkably acrobatic fashion . Woolly monkeys also brachiate at times . Orangutans use a similar form of locomotion called <unk> climbing , in which they use their arms and legs to carry their heavy bodies through the trees . <unk> and gorillas knuckle walk , and can move bipedally for short distances . Although numerous species , such as australopithecines and early hominids , have exhibited fully bipedal locomotion , humans are the only extant species with this trait . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 = = = Social systems = = = 
 Primates are among the most social of animals , forming pairs or family groups , uni @-@ male harems , and multi @-@ male / multi @-@ female groups . Richard <unk> stated that social systems of non @-@ human primates are best classified by the amount of movement by females occurring between groups . He proposed four categories : 
 Female transfer systems – females move away from the group in which they were born . Females of a group will not be closely related whereas males will have remained with their natal groups , and this close association may be influential in social behavior . The groups formed are generally quite small . This organization can be seen in chimpanzees , where the males , who are typically related , will cooperate in defense of the group 's territory . Among New World Monkeys , spider monkeys and muriquis use this system . 
 Male transfer systems – while the females remain in their natal groups , the males will emigrate as adolescents . Polygynous and multi @-@ male societies are classed in this category . Group sizes are usually larger . This system is common among the ring @-@ tailed lemur , capuchin monkeys and cercopithecine monkeys . 
 Monogamous species – a male – female bond , sometimes accompanied by a juvenile offspring . There is shared responsibility of parental care and territorial defense . The offspring leaves the parents ' territory during adolescence . Gibbons essentially use this system , although " monogamy " in this context does not necessarily mean absolute sexual fidelity . 
 Solitary species – often males who defend territories that include the home ranges of several females . This type of organization is found in the prosimians such as the slow loris . Orangutans do not defend their territory but effectively have this organization . 
 Other systems are known to occur as well . For example , with howler monkeys both the males and females typically transfer from their natal group on reaching sexual maturity , resulting in groups in which neither the males nor females are typically related . Some prosimians , colobine monkeys and <unk> monkeys use this system . 
 The transfer of females or males from their native group is likely an adaptation for avoiding inbreeding . An analysis of breeding records of captive primate colonies representing numerous different species indicates that the infant mortality of inbred young is generally higher than that of non @-@ inbred young . This effect of inbreeding on infant mortality is probably largely a result of increased expression of deleterious recessive alleles ( see Inbreeding depression ) . 
 <unk> Jane Goodall , who studied in the <unk> Stream National Park , noted fission @-@ fusion societies in chimpanzees . There is fission when the main group splits up to forage during the day , then fusion when the group returns at night to sleep as a group . This social structure can also be observed in the hamadryas baboon , spider monkeys and the bonobo . The gelada has a similar social structure in which many smaller groups come together to form temporary herds of up to 600 monkeys . 
 These social systems are affected by three main ecological factors : distribution of resources , group size , and predation . Within a social group there is a balance between cooperation and competition . Cooperative behaviors include social grooming ( removing skin parasites and cleaning wounds ) , food sharing , and collective defense against predators or of a territory . Aggressive behaviors often signal competition for food , sleeping sites or mates . Aggression is also used in establishing dominance hierarchies . 
 = = = Interspecific associations = = = 
 Several species of primates are known to associate in the wild . Some of these associations have been extensively studied . In the Tai Forest of Africa several species coordinate anti @-@ predator behavior . These include the Diana monkey , Campbell 's mona monkey , lesser spot @-@ nosed monkey , western red colobus , king colobus and sooty mangabey , which coordinate anti @-@ predator alarm calls . Among the predators of these monkeys is the common chimpanzee . 
 The red @-@ tailed monkey associates with several species , including the western red colobus , blue monkey , Wolf 's mona monkey , mantled guereza , black crested mangabey and Allen 's swamp monkey . Several of these species are preyed upon by the common chimpanzee . 
 In South America , squirrel monkeys associate with capuchin monkeys . This may have more to do with foraging benefits to the squirrel monkeys than anti @-@ predation benefits . 
 = = = Cognition and communication = = = 
 Primates have advanced cognitive abilities : some make tools and use them to acquire food and for social displays ; some have sophisticated hunting strategies requiring cooperation , influence and rank ; they are status conscious , manipulative and capable of deception ; they can recognise kin and conspecifics ; and they can learn to use symbols and understand aspects of human language including some relational syntax and concepts of number and numerical sequence . Research in primate cognition explores problem solving , memory , social interaction , a theory of mind , and numerical , spatial , and abstract concepts . Comparative studies show a trend towards higher intelligence going from prosimians to New World monkeys to Old World monkeys , and significantly higher average cognitive abilities in the great apes . However , there is a great deal of variation in each group ( e.g. , among New World monkeys , both spider and capuchin monkeys have scored highly by some measures ) , as well as in the results of different studies . 
 Lemurs , lorises , tarsiers , and New World monkeys rely on olfactory signals for many aspects of social and reproductive behavior . Specialized glands are used to mark territories with pheromones , which are detected by the vomeronasal organ ; this process forms a large part of the communication behavior of these primates . In Old World monkeys and apes this ability is mostly vestigial , having regressed as trichromatic eyes evolved to become the main sensory organ . Primates also use vocalizations , gestures , and facial expressions to convey psychological state . The Philippine tarsier , has a high @-@ frequency limit of auditory sensitivity of approximately 91 kHz with a dominant frequency of 70 kHz . Such values are among the highest recorded for any terrestrial mammal , and a relatively extreme example of ultrasonic communication . For Philippine tarsiers , ultrasonic vocalizations might represent a private channel of communication that subverts detection by predators , prey and competitors , enhances energetic efficiency , or improves detection against low @-@ frequency background noise . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 Primates have slower rates of development than other mammals . All primate infants are <unk> by their mothers ( with the exception of some human cultures and various zoo raised primates which are fed formula ) and rely on them for grooming and transportation . In some species , infants are protected and transported by males in the group , particularly males who may be their fathers . Other relatives of the infant , such as siblings and aunts , may participate in its care as well . Most primate mothers cease ovulation while breastfeeding an infant ; once the infant is weaned the mother can reproduce again . This often leads to weaning conflict with infants who attempt to continue breastfeeding . 
 Infanticide is common in polygynous species such as gray langurs and gorillas . Adult males may kill dependent offspring that are not theirs so the female will return to estrus and thus they can sire offspring of their own . Social monogamy in some species may have evolved to combat this behavior . Promiscuity may also lessen the risk of infanticide since paternity becomes uncertain . 
 Primates have a longer juvenile period between weaning and sexual maturity than other mammals of similar size . Some primates such as galagos and new world monkeys use tree @-@ holes for nesting , and park juveniles in leafy patches while foraging . Other primates follow a strategy of " riding " , i , e. carrying individuals on the body while feeding . Adults may construct and / or use nesting sites , sometimes accompanied by juveniles , for the purpose of resting , a behavior which has developed secondarily in the great apes . During the juvenile period , primates are more susceptible than adults to predation and starvation ; they gain experience in feeding and avoiding predators during this time . They learn social and fighting skills , often through playing . Primates , especially females , have longer lifespans than other similarly sized mammals , this may be partially due to their slower metabolisms . Late in life , female catarrhine primates appear to undergo a cessation of reproductive function known as menopause ; other groups are less studied . 
 = = = Diet , feeding and hunting = = = 
 Primates exploit a variety of food sources . It has been said that many characteristics of modern primates , including humans , derive from an early ancestor 's practice of taking most of its food from the tropical canopy . Most primates include fruit in their diets to obtain easily digested carbohydrates and lipids for energy . However , they require other foods , such as leaves or insects , for amino acids , vitamins and minerals . Primates in the suborder Strepsirrhini ( non @-@ tarsier prosimians ) are able to synthesize vitamin C , like most other mammals , while primates of the suborder Haplorrhini ( tarsiers , monkeys and apes ) have lost this ability , and require the vitamin in their diet . 
 Many primates have anatomical specializations that enable them to exploit particular foods , such as fruit , leaves , gum or insects . For example , leaf eaters such as howler monkeys , black @-@ and @-@ white <unk> and sportive lemurs have extended digestive tracts which enable them to absorb nutrients from leaves that can be difficult to digest . <unk> , which are gum eaters , have strong incisor teeth , enabling them to open tree bark to get to the gum , and claws rather than nails , enabling them to cling to trees while feeding . The aye @-@ aye combines rodent @-@ like teeth with a long , thin middle finger to fill the same ecological niche as a woodpecker . It taps on trees to find insect larvae , then gnaws holes in the wood and inserts its elongated middle finger to pull the larvae out . Some species have additional specializations . For example , the grey @-@ cheeked mangabey has thick enamel on its teeth , enabling it to open hard fruits and seeds that other monkeys cannot . The gelada is the only primate species that feeds primarily on grass . 
 = = = = Hunting = = = = 
 Tarsiers are the only extant obligate carnivorous primates , exclusively eating insects , crustaceans , small vertebrates and snakes ( including venomous species ) . Capuchin monkeys can exploit many different types of plant matter , including fruit , leaves , flowers , buds , nectar and seeds , but also eat insects and other invertebrates , bird eggs , and small vertebrates such as birds , lizards , squirrels and bats . 
 The common chimpanzee has a varied diet that includes predation on other primate species , such as the western red colobus monkey . This sometimes involves tool use . Common chimpanzees sharpen sticks to use as weapons when hunting mammals . This is considered the first evidence of systematic use of weapons in a species other than humans . Researchers documented 22 occasions where wild chimpanzees fashioned sticks into " spears " to hunt lesser bush babies ( <unk> senegalensis ) . In each case , a chimpanzee modified a branch by breaking off one or both ends and , frequently using its teeth , sharpened the stick . The tools , on average , were about 60 cm ( 24 in ) long and 1 @.@ 1 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 in ) in circumference . The chimpanzees then jabbed their spears into hollows in tree trunks where bush babies slept . There was a single case in which a chimpanzee successfully extracted a bush baby with the tool . The bonobo is an omnivorous <unk> – the majority of its diet is fruit , but it supplements this with leaves , meat from small vertebrates , such as <unk> , flying squirrels and duikers , and invertebrates . In some instances , bonobos have been shown to consume lower @-@ order primates . 
 = = = As prey = = = 
 Predators of primates include various species of carnivorans , birds of prey , reptiles and other primates . Even gorillas have been recorded as prey . Predators of primates have diverse hunting strategies and as such , primates have evolved several different antipredator adaptations including crypsis , alarm calls and mobbing . Several species have separate alarm calls for different predators such as air @-@ borne or ground @-@ dwelling predators . Predation may have shaped group size in primates as species exposed to higher predation pressures appear to live in larger groups . With their technology and increased intelligence , modern humans are nearly free of threats from predators and are themselves apex predators . 
 = = = Tool use and manufacture = = = 
 = = = = Tool use = = = = 
 There are many reports of non @-@ human primates using tools , both in the wild or when captive . The use of tools by primates is varied and includes hunting ( mammals , invertebrates , fish ) , collecting honey , processing food ( nuts , fruits , vegetables and seeds ) , collecting water , weapons and shelter . 
 In 1960 , Jane Goodall observed a chimpanzee poking pieces of grass into a termite mound and then raising the grass to his mouth . After he left , Goodall approached the mound and repeated the behaviour because she was unsure what the chimpanzee was doing . She found that the termites bit onto the grass with their jaws . The chimpanzee had been using the grass as a tool to “ fish ” or " dip " for termites . There are more limited reports of the closely related bonobo using tools in the wild ; it has been claimed they rarely use tools in the wild although they use tools as readily as chimpanzees when in captivity , It has been reported that both female chimpanzees and bonobos use tools more avidly than males . Orangutans in Borneo scoop catfish out of small ponds . Anthropologist Anne <unk> saw several animals on these forested islands learn on their own to jab at catfish with sticks , so that the panicked prey would flop out of ponds and into the orangutan 's waiting hands There are few reports of gorillas using tools in the wild . An adult female Western lowland gorilla used a branch as a walking stick apparently to test water depth and to aid her in crossing a pool of water . Another adult female used a detached trunk from a small shrub as a stabilizer during food gathering , and another used a log as a bridge . 
 The black @-@ striped capuchin was the first non @-@ ape primate for which tool use was documented in the wild ; individuals were observed cracking nuts by placing them on a stone anvil and hitting them with another large stone . In Thailand and Myanmar , crab @-@ eating macaques use stone tools to open nuts , oysters and other bivalves , and various types of sea snails . Chacma baboons use stones as weapons ; stoning by these baboons is done from the rocky walls of the canyon where they sleep and retreat to when they are threatened . Stones are lifted with one hand and dropped over the side whereupon they tumble down the side of the cliff or fall directly to the canyon floor . 
 Although they have not been observed to use tools in the wild , lemurs in controlled settings have been shown to be capable of understanding the functional properties of the objects they had been trained to use as tools , performing as well as tool @-@ using haplorhines . 
 = = = = Tool manufacture = = = = 
 Tool manufacture is much rarer than simple tool use and probably represents higher cognitive functioning . Soon after her initial discovery of tool use , Goodall observed other chimpanzees picking up leafy twigs , stripping off the leaves and using the stems to fish for insects . This change of a leafy twig into a tool was a major discovery . Prior to this , scientists thought that only humans manufactured and used tools , and that this ability was what separated humans from other animals . Both bonobos and chimpanzees have also been observed making " sponges " out of leaves and moss that suck up water and are used as grooming tools . Sumatran orangutans have been observed making and using tools . They will break off a tree branch that is about 30 cm long , snap off the twigs , fray one end and then use the stick to dig in tree holes for termites . In the wild , <unk> have been observed to clean their ears with modified tools . Scientists filmed a large male mandrill at Chester Zoo ( UK ) stripping down a twig , apparently to make it narrower , and then using the modified stick to scrape dirt from underneath its toenails . Captive gorillas have made a variety of tools . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Primates evolved from arboreal animals , and many species live most of their lives in trees . Most primate species live in tropical rain forests . The number of primate species within tropical areas has been shown to be positively correlated to the amount of rainfall and the amount of rain forest area . Accounting for 25 % to 40 % of the fruit @-@ eating animals ( by weight ) within tropical rainforests , primates play an important ecological role by dispersing seeds of many tree species . 
 Some species are partially terrestrial , such as baboons and <unk> monkeys , and a few species are fully terrestrial , such as geladas and humans . Non @-@ human primates live in a diverse number of forested habitats in the tropical latitudes of Africa , India , Southeast Asia , and South America , including rainforests , mangrove forests , and montane forests . There are some examples of non @-@ human primates that live outside of the tropics ; the mountain @-@ dwelling Japanese macaque lives in the north of Honshū where there is snow @-@ cover eight months of the year ; the Barbary macaque lives in the Atlas Mountains of Algeria and Morocco . Primate habitats span a range of altitudes : the black snub @-@ nosed monkey has been found living in the Hengduan Mountains at altitudes of 4 @,@ 700 meters ( 15 @,@ 400 ft ) , the mountain gorilla can be found at 4 @,@ 200 meters ( 13 @,@ 200 ft ) crossing the Virunga Mountains , and the gelada has been found at elevations of up to 5 @,@ 000 m ( 16 @,@ 000 ft ) in the Ethiopian Highlands . Although most species are generally shy of water , a few are good swimmers and are comfortable in swamps and watery areas , including the proboscis monkey , De Brazza 's monkey and Allen 's swamp monkey , which has developed small webbing between its fingers . Some primates , such as the rhesus macaque and gray langurs , can exploit human @-@ modified environments and even live in cities . 
 = = Interactions between humans and other primates = = 
 Close interactions between humans and non @-@ human primates ( NHPs ) can create pathways for the transmission of zoonotic diseases . Viruses such as Herpesviridae ( most notably Herpes B Virus ) , <unk> , measles , <unk> , rabies , the Marburg virus and viral hepatitis can be transmitted to humans ; in some cases the viruses produce potentially fatal diseases in both humans and non @-@ human primates . 
 = = = Legal and social status = = = 
 Only humans are recognized as persons and protected in law by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights . The legal status of NHPs , on the other hand , is the subject of much debate , with organizations such as the Great Ape Project ( GAP ) campaigning to award at least some of them legal rights . In June 2008 , Spain became the first country in the world to recognize the rights of some NHPs , when its parliament 's cross @-@ party environmental committee urged the country to comply with GAP 's recommendations , which are that chimpanzees , bonobos , orangutans , and gorillas are not be used for animal experiments . 
 Many species of NHP are kept as pets by humans , the Allied Effort to Save Other Primates ( <unk> ) estimates that around 15 @,@ 000 NHPs live as exotic pets in the United States . The expanding Chinese middle class has increased demand for NHPs as exotic pets in recent years . Although NHP import for the pet trade was banned in the U.S. in 1975 , smuggling still occurs along the United States – Mexico border , with prices ranging from US $ 3000 for monkeys to $ 30 @,@ 000 for apes . 
 Primates are used as model organisms in laboratories and have been used in space missions . They serve as service animals for disabled humans . Capuchin monkeys can be trained to assist quadriplegic humans ; their intelligence , memory , and manual dexterity make them ideal helpers . 
 NHPs are kept in zoos around the globe . Historically , zoos were primarily a form of entertainment , but more recently have shifted their focus towards conservation , education and research . GAP does not insist that all NHPs should be released from zoos , primarily because captive @-@ born primates lack the knowledge and experience to survive in the wild if released . 
 = = = Role in scientific research = = = 
 Thousands of non @-@ human primates are used around the world in research because of their psychological and physiological similarity to humans . In particular , the brains and eyes of NHPs more closely parallel human anatomy than those of any other animals . NHPs are commonly used in preclinical trials , neuroscience , ophthalmology studies , and toxicity studies . Rhesus macaques are often used , as are other macaques , African green monkeys , chimpanzees , baboons , squirrel monkeys , and marmosets , both wild @-@ caught and purpose @-@ bred . In 2005 , GAP reported that 1 @,@ 280 of the 3 @,@ 100 NHPs living in captivity in the United States were used for experiments . In 2004 , the European Union used around 10 @,@ 000 NHPs in such experiments ; in 2005 in Great Britain , 4 @,@ 652 experiments were conducted on 3 @,@ 115 NHPs . Governments of many nations have strict care requirements of NHPs kept in captivity . In the US , federal guidelines extensively regulate aspects of NHP housing , feeding , enrichment , and breeding . European groups such as the European Coalition to End Animal Experiments are seeking a ban on all NHP use in experiments as part of the European Union 's review of animal testing legislation . 
 = = = Conservation = = = 
 The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) lists more than a third of primates as critically endangered or vulnerable . Trade is regulated , as all species are listed by CITES in Appendix II , except 50 species and subspecies listed in Appendix I , which gain full protection from trade . Common threats to primate species include deforestation , forest fragmentation , monkey drives ( resulting from primate crop raiding ) , and primate hunting for use in medicines , as pets , and for food . Large @-@ scale tropical forest clearing is widely regarded as the process that most threatens primates . More than 90 % of primate species occur in tropical forests . The main cause of forest loss is clearing for agriculture , although commercial logging , subsistence harvesting of timber , mining , and dam construction also contribute to tropical forest destruction . In Indonesia large areas of lowland forest have been cleared to increase palm oil production , and one analysis of satellite imagery concluded that during 1998 and 1999 there was a loss of 1 @,@ 000 Sumatran orangutans per year in the Leuser Ecosystem alone . 
 Primates with a large body size ( over 5 kg ) are at increased extinction risk due to their greater profitability to poachers compared to smaller primates . They reach sexual maturity later and have a longer period between births . Populations therefore recover more slowly after being depleted by poaching or the pet trade . Data for some African cities show that half of all protein consumed in urban areas comes from the bushmeat trade . Endangered primates such as <unk> and the drill are hunted at levels that far exceed sustainable levels . This is due to their large body size , ease of transport and profitability per animal . As farming encroaches on forest habitats , primates feed on the crops , causing the farmers large economic losses . Primate crop raiding gives locals a negative impression of primates , hindering conservation efforts . 
 Madagascar , home to five endemic primate families , has experienced the greatest extinction of the recent past ; since human settlement 1 @,@ 500 years ago , at least eight classes and fifteen of the larger species have become extinct due to hunting and habitat destruction . Among the primates wiped out were Archaeoindris ( a lemur larger than a silverback gorilla ) and the families Palaeopropithecidae and Archaeolemuridae . 
 In Asia , Hinduism , Buddhism , and Islam prohibit eating primate meat ; however , primates are still hunted for food . Some smaller traditional religions allow the consumption of primate meat . The pet trade and traditional medicine also increase demand for illegal hunting . The rhesus macaque , a model organism , was protected after excessive trapping threatened its numbers in the 1960s ; the program was so effective that they are now viewed as a pest throughout their range . 
 In Central and South America forest fragmentation and hunting are the two main problems for primates . Large tracts of forest are now rare in Central America . This increases the amount of forest vulnerable to edge effects such as farmland encroachment , lower levels of humidity and a change in plant life . Movement restriction results in a greater amount of inbreeding , which can cause deleterious effects leading to a population bottleneck , whereby a significant percentage of the population is lost . 
 There are 21 critically endangered primates , 7 of which have remained on the IUCN 's " The World 's 25 Most Endangered Primates " list since the year 2000 : the silky sifaka , Delacour 's langur , the white @-@ headed langur , the gray @-@ <unk> <unk> , the Tonkin snub @-@ nosed monkey , the Cross River gorilla and the Sumatran orangutan . Miss Waldron 's red colobus was recently declared extinct when no trace of the subspecies could be found from 1993 to 1999 . A few hunters have found and killed individuals since then , but the subspecies ' prospects remain bleak . 
 = Battle of Ratsua = 
 The Battle of Ratsua occurred during the Second World War and involved Australian and Japanese forces . Part of the wider Bougainville Campaign of the Pacific theatre , the battle took place in the northern sector of Bougainville between June and August 1945 . The main forces that took part in the fighting were the Australian 23rd Brigade and the Japanese 87th Naval Garrison Force . 
 The fighting occurred following a failed landing by Australian forces at Porton Plantation in early June , which was part of an attempt to outflank a series of strong points that the Japanese had built across the base of the Bonis Peninsula . After this , the fighting in the northern sector around Ratsua essentially became a containment action for the Australians as they concentrated their efforts and resources upon driving south towards Buin , which was the main centre of Japanese resistance on the island at the time . As a result , the situation around Ratsua remained largely static until the end of hostilities in mid @-@ August 1945 . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Strategic situation = = = 
 Japanese forces had landed on Bougainville in early 1942 , capturing it from the small force of Australians garrisoning the island . They had subsequently developed several airbases on the island , using it to conduct operations in the northern Solomon Islands and to attack the Allied lines of communication between the United States , Australia and the Southwest Pacific Area . These bases also helped protect Rabaul , the major Japanese garrison and naval base in Papua New Guinea , and throughout 1943 , Allied planners determined that Bougainville was vital for neutralising the Japanese base around Rabaul . US Marines conducted an amphibious landing at Cape Torokina , on the western coast of the island , north of Empress Augusta Bay , in November 1943 . After an initial counter @-@ attack , the US Marines had been replaced by a garrison of US Army troops who began consolidating their position around Torokina , establishing a strong perimeter . In March 1944 , the Japanese launched a heavy counter @-@ attack , which was turned back with heavy casualties . After this , the situation on Bougainville became largely static , as the Japanese focused primarily on subsistence , and the US forces chose to adopt a mainly defensive posture focused on maintaining the perimeter around Torokina . 
 In late 1944 , the Australian Army had assumed responsibility for Allied operations on Bougainville , replacing US troops who were subsequently redeployed to the Philippines . At the time , the Australians believed that there were only 17 @,@ 500 Japanese on the island , although in reality it was actually more than 40 @,@ 000 . Against this , the Australians deployed Lieutenant General Stanley Savige 's II Corps , consisting of the 3rd Division and the 11th Brigade in November 1944 . The troops were Militiamen , part of Australia 's reserve military , consisting of volunteers and conscripts . Although their ranks included some Second Australian Imperial Force soldiers and officers who were veterans of earlier campaigns in the Middle East and New Guinea , they were largely inexperienced having served primarily in a garrison role in Australia and New Guinea prior to their commitment to Bougainville . In December , after a period of reconnaissance and information gathering , it was decided that the Australians would pursue an aggressive campaign to clear the Japanese from Bougainville . 
 The campaign subsequently developed into three separate drives by the Australians , who fanned out from the main Allied base at Torokina : in the north , centre and southern parts of the island . The first actions were fought around the seizure of Pearl Ridge in late December 1944 to secure control of the east – west avenues of approach across the island , and to prevent any possible Japanese counter @-@ attacks against Torokina . This was followed by actions in the north , where it was planned that Japanese forces would be forced into the narrow Bonis Peninsula and contained , while the main drive took place in the south , where the main Japanese forces were concentrated , with an initial drive towards Mosigetta , followed by an advance towards Buin on the coast . The drive south subsequently resulted in several actions around Slater 's Knoll and around the Hongorai River .

 In the northern sector of the island , in February 1945 , Major General <unk> Kijima — commander of the Japanese 38th Independent Mixed Brigade — had ordered a withdrawal to Numa Numa , following the fighting around Tsimba Ridge . He subsequently left a force of 1 @,@ 400 sailors drawn from the 87th Naval Garrison Force and 2 @,@ 000 civilians to hold the Bonis Peninsula . Of these civilians , about 600 were armed , although only half were trained to undertake a combat role . As their supplies dwindled , in May – June the Japanese sailors — under the command of Captain Eikichi Kato , the senior naval officer in Buka — began to raid the Australian supply lines between Ruri Bay and Ratsua as they attempted to hold a position between Porton Plantation and <unk> . 
 Meanwhile , Australian troops from the 11th Brigade had continued their advance north from Tsimba Ridge in April – May , clearing up to the Soraken Peninsula , which was captured by the middle of the month by the 26th Infantry Battalion . Throughout May , the 26th had also carried out an amphibious landing on Torokori Island . Meanwhile , throughout the same time the 55th / 53rd Infantry Battalion had advanced north @-@ east " through mangrove swamps ... and rugged foothills " from the Soraken Plantation towards <unk> <unk> ; this was occupied by early May and from there the Australians ranged north to Ruri Bay , establishing a line across the Bonis Peninsula over a distance of 8 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) . By the end of May , the Japanese fell back behind a series of fortified positions along the base of the Bonis Peninsula . The 26th Infantry Battalion subsequently replaced the 55th / 53rd , but the Australian advance came to a halt . 
 In an effort to break this resistance and allow the northwards advance to continue , the Australians attempted to outflank the Japanese defensive line by launching an amphibious landing at Porton Plantation on 8 June . The plan called for a reinforced company from the 31st / 51st Infantry Battalion to land behind the Japanese positions and attack from the west , while the main force consisting of the remainder of the 31st / 51st Infantry Battalion and the 26th Infantry Battalion attempted to break through from the south . Due to poor planning , inadequate resources and strong Japanese defence , the landing failed at considerable cost to Australians , and as their efforts turned towards effecting a withdrawal from the beachhead and rescuing the stranded men , the attempt by the main force to break through from Ratsua also failed as tired troops came up against strong Japanese defensive positions . 
 = = Battle = = 
 Following the failed landing by the Australians at Porton Plantation , the commander of the Australian II Corps , Savige , decided to focus the main effort of the Australian campaign upon driving south towards the Japanese garrison at Buin , where the bulk of the Japanese forces were holding out . In order to concentrate enough forces for the next phase of the operation , Savige decided that the 11th Brigade , which had been carrying the advance north , should be relieved so that it could be transferred to the south following a period of rest and reorganisation . 
 Nevertheless , there was still a need to maintain the pressure upon the Japanese in the north , and so the 23rd Brigade — which had been previously operating in the central sector after being transferred from garrison duty in the Outer Islands — was also given responsibility for the northern sector as well , relieving the 11th Brigade on 20 June . The brigade 's commander — Brigadier Arnold Potts — was charged with keeping the Japanese force bottled up on the Bonis Peninsula and to send out patrols towards the Buka Passage . Initially , Potts was only allowed to allocate one of his three battalions — the 27th , under Lieutenant Colonel Alex Pope — for the task , as the other two — Lieutenant Colonel Harry Dunkley 's 7th Infantry Battalion and Lieutenant Colonel Lew Loughran 's 8th Infantry Battalion — were to remain in the central sector ; however , after intelligence reports indicated that the Japanese forces in the northern sector were stronger than the Australians initially thought , he requested permission to transfer the 8th Infantry Battalion , along with a battery of artillery from the 4th Field Regiment that was to be based on the Soraken Peninsula . Due to the requirements of the advance to the south , however , no engineer or armoured support was initially available . 
 This request was approved , and by 28 June the two battalions and their supporting artillery — approximately 1 @,@ 600 troops — were assembled , with the 8th on the left , or western side of the peninsula , the 27th on the right , and the artillery based on the Soraken Peninsula . The two battalions sent fighting patrols forward , but because of the dense terrain , the Australian line of communication was quite long and the infantry spread out over a very wide area . With each battalion occupying a 4 @,@ 000 @-@ yard ( 3 @,@ 700 m ) front , which was twice the normal standard , security of their rear areas became difficult as the Japanese took the opportunity to disrupt the Australian logistic efforts , conducting ambushes , cutting communications and planting mines along the tracks . As the ambushes increased and casualties mounted , forward movement came to a halt , and by 21 July , the 27th Infantry Battalion reported having lost 10 men killed and 36 wounded without having gained any ground . 
 In light of this failure , the Australian brigade commander requested further resources to undertake a full @-@ scale offensive aimed at clearing the Japanese from the peninsula . This request was passed up to corps @-@ level , but it was denied as Savige could not afford to release assets that were being used in the drive south . Under pressure to keep casualties to a minimum following criticism in the Australian media and in Parliament regarding the necessity of the campaign , Potts formulated a plan to withdraw the 27th Infantry Battalion from the right flank around Ruri Bay , and concentrate his forces on the left flank along a 3 @,@ 000 @-@ yard ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) front around the plantation at Buoi , to the north of Ratsua . Savige agreed to this on 22 July and the following day the 8th Infantry Battalion launched an attack against a feature known to the Australians as " Como Ridge " , which ran roughly northwest to southwest in the centre of the peninsula between Ruri Bay and Buoi Plantation . There it was believed that the Japanese were attempting to set up a forward position . The attack went in after a preliminary attack from the air , with one company attacking with two Matilda tanks from the 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment in support . Although the airstrike had been largely ineffective and both of the tanks struggled to cross the " swampy ground " , the direct fire support provided by the tanks proved decisive and the Australians took the position within 20 minutes , killing 12 Japanese . 
 On 24 July , the 8th Infantry Battalion launched another attack with two platoons assaulting the Japanese position known as " Base 5 " . Prior to the assault , over 900 artillery shells and mortar bombs were brought down on the Japanese positions to prepare the position for the attack , but this proved ineffective against well @-@ entrenched positions . The Australians reached their first objective , which was a small ridge in front of the main Japanese position ; however , shortly after they began receiving effective fire from concealed positions , which killed two men and wounded another in the forward section , pinning it in place . 
 Attempts to outflank the bunkers were answered with heavy fire from a Japanese medium machine gun and another man was killed and three more wounded . As the attack began to falter , one of the wounded , 20 @-@ year @-@ old Private Frank Partridge , who had been injured in the arm and thigh , braved the heavy fire that was being put down towards him and gathered the Bren light machine gun from the gunner who had been killed . After pouring suppressing fire onto the bunker , he discarded the Bren and regathered his rifle , before rushing towards the bunker with a grenade and killing its occupants . Partridge 's actions reinvigorated the attack and allowed the Australians to temporarily take the second Japanese position . After the wounded were recovered , the Australians withdrew having lost three men killed and five wounded . Against this eight Japanese were confirmed to have been killed . For his actions during the attack on 24 July , Partridge was awarded the Victoria Cross , the British Commonwealth 's highest military decoration . He was the last Australian to be awarded the medal during the Second World War , and was also the youngest . 
 Elsewhere , the Australians continued to mount patrols and ambushes . On 29 July , a platoon from the Papuan Infantry Battalion ( PIB ) clashed with a similar sized force of Japanese around the junction of the Ratsua Road – Umum Track . Two days later , after the PIB had assumed a flank security role on the eastern side of the peninsula , another patrol clashed with a party of Japanese who had been attempting to set up an ambush near Ruri Bay . In the ensuing fight , 14 Japanese were killed ; a further 20 were killed in a firefight around the same area of <unk> . Meanwhile , on 2 August , a patrol from the 27th Infantry Battalion was sent out along the Ruri Bay Road in company with two tanks that were to act as their direct fire support . The Japanese were still active in the area , and had mined the road with a 500 lb ( 230 kg ) bomb that they had rigged to be detonated remotely . The Australian patrol accidentally triggered the device and the resulting explosion killed three men in one of the tanks and wounded eight infantrymen following behind . On 5 August , the Australians reoccupied the position at Base 5 after encountering only slight resistance and subsequently named it " Part Ridge " . After exploiting the position , it was discovered that the Japanese had built between 43 and 60 bunkers in the area . The majority of these had been destroyed by artillery , though , and after the area had been thoroughly searched for Japanese stragglers , the Australian patrol was withdrawn from the ridge . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The fighting around Base 5 was the final action of the fighting in the northern sector of the island , which essentially ended in stalemate . The Australians , under pressure to limit casualties to their largely inexperienced troops , had pursued a cautious campaign and had been slow to regain the initiative in the area following the defeat at Porton Plantation . In contrast , the Japanese commander — Kato — had been skillful and aggressive . On 11 August , in anticipation of the capitulation of Japan following the dropping of two atomic bombs on Japanese cities , the order to cease offensive combat operations on Bougainville was passed to all Australian units by their commanders . 
 Three days later , on 15 August , the Japanese Emperor Hirohito publicly announced Japan 's unconditional surrender , effectively bringing about an end to the war . On 18 August , in the southern sector of the island the Japanese commander , General <unk> Kanda , dispatched an envoy across the flood swollen Mivo River to begin negotiations with the Australians for the surrender of the over 23 @,@ 000 Japanese soldiers left on the island , bringing about an end to the campaign . Throughout the course of the fighting on Bougainville from November 1944 to August 1945 , 526 Australians were killed , while a further 1 @,@ 572 were wounded . Approximately 8 @,@ 500 Japanese were killed in action and a further 9 @,@ 800 died from disease during this same period . 
 = Thief : The Dark Project = 
 Thief : The Dark Project , also known simply as Thief , is a 1998 first @-@ person stealth video game developed by Looking Glass Studios and published by Eidos Interactive . Set in a medieval steampunk metropolis called the City , the game follows Garrett , a master thief trained by a secret society . An expanded edition of the game , Thief Gold , was released in 1999 . 
 Thief was the first PC stealth game to use light and sound as game mechanics . Its use of first @-@ person perspective for non @-@ confrontational gameplay challenged the first @-@ person shooter market , which led the developers to call it a " first @-@ person sneaker " . The game combines complex artificial intelligence with simulation systems to allow for emergent gameplay . Thief 's influence has been traced to later stealth games such as Tom Clancy 's Splinter Cell and Hitman . 
 The game received critical acclaim and has been placed on numerous hall @-@ of @-@ fame lists . With sales of half a million units by the year 2000 , it is Looking Glass ' most commercially successful game . Thief was followed by a series of three sequels : Thief II : The Metal Age ( 2000 ) , Thief : Deadly Shadows ( 2004 ) and the reboot Thief ( 2014 ) . Looking Glass closed after Thief II 's release , and so the latter two games were developed by Ion Storm and Eidos Montreal respectively . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Thief takes place from a first @-@ person perspective in a 3D environment . As a stealth game , it emphasizes evasion over confrontation , and the player character has limited combat proficiency and damage resistance . Shadows may be used to avoid notice ; a monitor on the heads @-@ up display ( HUD ) indicates the player character 's visibility level . The player character may lean , crouch , climb , swim and run , among other actions . Surfaces cause varying amounts of noise ; for example , carpet is quiet and ceramic tiles are very loud . The player receives information about non @-@ player characters ( NPCs ) through sound , such as the surface on which they are walking , their proximity and suspicion level . The player may use sound , such as a thrown object , to distract NPCs . Each of the game 's 12 levels has objectives , such as the theft of a specific item , that must be completed before another level is reached . The game 's three difficulty settings alter objectives , paths through the level , and other aspects . Levels are largely unscripted , and allow for emergent gameplay . 
 The game 's NPCs feature artificial intelligence ( AI ) systems that detect unscripted visual and aural cues ; if a NPC sees or hears the player character , it becomes suspicious . Depending on its level of suspicion , a NPC might ignore the cue or begin to actively seek the player . NPCs detect clashing swords , other NPCs ' voices , and changes to their environment , such as blood stains , opened doors and fallen bodies . The game contains both " guard " and " servant " NPCs , who vary in their reactions to the player character : guards call out an alert and attack , while servants will run for help . If a guard is significantly injured , it will try to escape . The game features non @-@ human characters , such as zombies , and certain levels contain survival horror elements . 
 The player character possesses a blackjack and a sword , which incapacitate and kill NPCs , respectively . The game features a sword @-@ combat system for direct confrontations ; it contains three directional attacks and the ability to parry . Fallen bodies may be picked up and hidden . The game 's bow may be used for ranged attacks or as a tool ; for example , " water arrows " extinguish torches while " rope arrows " lower a climbable rope . Other tools include <unk> , " <unk> " and speed potions , among other things . Weapon and item inventories are displayed in the bottom corners of the screen ; the player cycles through them to select objects . Equipment may be purchased between levels . 
 = = Plot = = 
 = = = Setting = = = 
 Thief takes place in a metropolis called " the City " , which has been noted to contain elements of the Middle Ages @-@ like dark fantasy and the Industrial Revolution . Project director Greg LoPiccolo said in an early preview : " In essence [ ... it 's ] this undefined medieval age , sort of medieval [ Europe ] meets Brazil meets City of Lost Children . There 's some electricity , some magic , and some 19th century machinery kind of stuff . " The setting has been described as steampunk , a fantastical setting where steam engine technology is prominently used . During levels , the player may learn about the setting by finding notes and overhearing conversations ; it has been noted that the player participates in the revelation of Thief 's setting . 
 The City contains three factions : the Keepers , and two opposing religious orders known as the Pagans and the Order of the Hammer , or " Hammerites " . The latter two have been cited as representations of chaos and order , respectively ; the neutral , secretive Keepers strive to maintain balance within the City . The Hammerites worship a deity called " The Builder " , and believe in progress , craftsmanship and righteousness ; the Pagans , who have been described as " primitive , almost animalistic " , worship the dangerous " Trickster " god and value the natural world . It has been assessed that the design of each group 's architecture reflects their beliefs . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 The game 's prologue sees Garrett , the protagonist , describing his youth as a homeless orphan on the City 's streets . He is caught while attempting to pickpocket a suspicious man who reveals himself to be a Keeper . Impressed by Garrett 's ability to see him , he offers him the chance to join his order . Garrett accepts , but later leaves the order to pursue a life of thievery . Years later , Garrett works as a thief , and is under pressure to join a crime ring . As punishment for his failure to pay a protection fee , he is targeted for assassination by the crime lord Ramirez . Garrett evades the assassins , and robs Ramirez 's mansion in retaliation . Following this , he is approached by a woman named Viktoria — the representative of an anonymous client who was impressed by Garrett 's theft from Ramirez . He is contracted to steal a sword from Constantine , an eccentric nobleman who recently arrived in the City . After Garrett completes the mission , Viktoria takes him to Constantine , who explains that he hired Garrett to steal his own sword as a test . Constantine offers him a fortune to steal The Eye — a gem kept within a sealed and deserted Hammerite cathedral . 
 To reach the cathedral , Garrett ventures through Old Quarter , a haunted , abandoned district of the City . Through an opening in the cathedral , The Eye informs Garrett of a nearby Keeper sanctuary , where he may learn how to unseal the cathedral . There , Garrett discovers that the cathedral was sealed to prevent the City 's destruction by the Trickster . He learns that there are four talismans needed to remove the seal : two hidden in ancient ruins beneath the City , and two inside a Hammerite temple ( in Thief Gold , one talisman is in possession of the mages and another was found at an opera house after it was taken from the caves below , while the other two are in the Lost City and the Hammerite Temple as in the original game ) . Garrett recovers the talismans and returns to the cathedral . After unsealing the cathedral , he learns that its inhabitants had been killed and made undead by The Eye . He returns The Eye to Constantine , who reveals himself to be the Trickster . Viktoria says that The Eye requires a flesh eye to function ; she binds Garrett with vines and removes his right eye . The Trickster places it on the gemstone , and the two disappear through a portal . Garrett , left for dead , is found and freed by two Keepers . During his escape from the Trickster 's mansion , he learns that the Trickster plans to use The Eye to revert the world to a wild state . 
 After Garrett escapes the mansion , he seeks help from the Order of the Hammer . However , he finds that the Trickster has attacked the Hammerite temple . In a refuge beneath the temple , he finds Hammerite survivors who provide him with a booby @-@ trapped replica of The Eye . Garrett descends into the Trickster 's domain , where he finds the Trickster performing a ritual with The Eye to complete his plan . Garrett stealthily substitutes The Eye with its copy , which kills the Trickster . Later , Garrett has acquired a mechanical replacement for his lost eye . On the streets of the City , a Keeper approaches Garrett and claims that he will soon require the Keepers ' help . Garrett dismisses him , and as he walks away , the Keeper warns of the encroaching " metal age " . 
 = = Development = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 Thief began development in April 1996 . For the game 's original designer and writer Ken Levine , credited by The Telegraph as " a key figure in the creation " of Thief , inspirations came from two of his favourite games , Castle Wolfenstein and Diablo . The initial concept was to make an action role @-@ playing game and Levine was given the job of designing the game 's world and story . Levine said the initial ideas and projects that have later morphed into Dark Camelot , before eventually evolving into The Dark Project , included School of Wizards and Better Red Than Undead , the latter of which was " a campy story " about communist zombies . The game was supposed to be a first @-@ person sword fighting simulator , but " the marketing [ department ] killed the idea , " to his disappointment . According to programmer Marc LeBlanc , " The first proposal was Better Red Than Undead , a ' 50s Cold War game where the Soviet Union is overrun with zombies and you have to go hack them to pieces as the loner from the CIA because bullets don 't work on the undead . " Doug Church said the game 's design was built around the idea " of having factions who you could ally with or oppose yourself with or do things for or not . " 
 = = = Dark Camelot = = = 
 The next concept , Dark Camelot , still focused on sword combat . Its plot — an inversion of Arthurian legend — featured Mordred as a misunderstood hero , King Arthur as a tyrannical villain and Merlin as a psychopath . According to Church , the game featured Morgan le Fay as Mordred 's " sort of good " advisor and Guinevere as a lesbian who would betray Lancelot and help Mordred to break into Camelot and steal the Holy Grail . The game 's design combined a first @-@ person perspective with action , role @-@ playing and adventure elements . Warren Spector , who had recently left Origin Systems to found Looking Glass Studios Austin , became Dark Camelot 's producer after his predecessor departed . Artist Dan Thron said : " For a good long time , we had no idea what the game was about , until somebody stumbled upon the whole thief game play where you 're not just running out trying to chop people up . " Church recalled that " the basic stealth model was [ ... ] having the guard looking the other way and you going past pretty quickly . So Paul [ <unk> ] had been pushing for a while that the thief side of it was the really interesting part and why not you just do a thief game . " A previously unreleased trailer for Dark Camelot and its Stargate Engine was uploaded to YouTube in 2013 . 
 = = = Production = = = 
 In early 1997 , Dark Camelot 's name was tentatively changed to The Dark Project and its design altered to focus on thievery and stealth . Nevertheless , some levels originally designed for Dark Camelot ended up in the final product . In March , project director Greg LoPiccolo described the game 's design : " Essentially we 're building a type of simulator [ ... ] where object interactions are correct and physics are tied in correctly . " Then @-@ lead designer Jeff <unk> reiterated : " The goal is for everything to behave as it should . For example , things that burn will burn , and then it 's up to the player to decide to burn things , whether or not we 've anticipated it . " The first draft of stealth design was presented by Levine and Dorian Hart on April 4 . Levine said inspiration for the idea of being powerful when undetected but very vulnerable when exposed came from the concept of submarine warfare and in particular from the 1985 simulation video game Silent Service . Multiplayer support was planned , including the " <unk> " mode ( a pun on deathmatch ) " where small teams of thieves compete under time pressure to steal the greatest value of swag from the territory of wealthy NPC 's and their guard " . Full @-@ scale development on The Dark Project began in May 1997 , with a frantic work on a demo level and trailer for E3 1997 . Originally announced to come out in Summer 1997 , the game was delayed to Winter 1997 @-@ 98 . 
 However , Looking Glass Studios experienced serious financial trouble as development progressed into mid @-@ 1997 . The company 's Austin branch closed , costing Spector and several game engine programmers ; this team relocated to ION Storm , and released Deus Ex in 2000 . Spector later called his impact on Thief , " at best , minimal " . Levine too had left the The Dark Project project before the Keepers factions was added to the game . By April 18 , Looking Glass Studios laid off half of its entire staff in six months , which damaged morale of The Dark Project team , which at this point was vastly different from the one with which the development began . " Few emotions can compare to the stress of heading to work not knowing who might be laid off , including yourself , or whether the doors would be locked when you got there , " lead programmer Tom Leonard later said . This stress caused several team members to voluntarily quit , including the lead programmer ( Briscoe Rogers ) who had designed the game 's AI system , which suffered from software bugs and problems with complexity . 
 When Leonard took over the position of lead programmer , he believed that the AI system was fixable ; over several months , he learned that the pathfinding database — code that helps AI navigate a map — was unsalvageable . He completed the design — but not implementation — of a new system by November 1997 , using an estimated one @-@ fifth of the original code . Several features were removed during development , among them multiplayer support , a complex inventory interface , and branching mission structures . Leonard said they " focused in on creating a single @-@ player , linear , mission @-@ based game centered exclusively around stealth . " He believed that the removal of multiplayer support and the game 's renaming — from The Dark Project to Thief : The Dark Project — solidified this in the minds of the team . The game was renamed on April 3 , 1998 , the new title being much more descriptive and inspired by that of the role @-@ playing game Vampire : The Masquerade . Several features have been brainstormed and rejected , including " Spider @-@ Man @-@ esque " ability to climb on walls and ceilings and the shrinking and invisibility potions . By summer 1998 , the team was challenged by exhaustion and the game 's numerous simulation and AI glitches . These problems resulted in what Leonard later described as " a game [ that ] could not be called fun . " Implementation of Leonard 's new AI system was halted so the team could quickly assemble proof @-@ of @-@ concept demos ; publisher Eidos Interactive had grown skeptical over the team 's vision . Work on the AI did not resume until March 1998 , and after 12 more weeks of constant work , it was ready for what Leonard called , " real testing " . 
 Three months before the game 's scheduled ship date , most problems had been resolved . The team began to believe , as Leonard described , that Thief " did not stink , [ and ] might actually be fun . " Further , the release of games like Commandos : Behind Enemy Lines , Half @-@ Life and Metal Gear Solid eased worries that experimental gameplay styles were unmarketable . According to Leonard , " A new energy revitalized the team . Long hours driven by passion and measured confidence marked the closing months of the project . " The game went gold in November 1998 , following an estimated 2 @.@ 5 year development cycle and a $ 3 million budget . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 The design of Thief focused on stealth and evasion from a first @-@ person perspective . Leonard said this idea challenged the standard first @-@ person shooter concept : " It is a game style that many observers were concerned might not appeal to players [ ... ] and even those intimately involved with the game had doubts at times . " In response to the sentiment that their previous games " [ required ] a fair amount of investment from the player to get maximal enjoyment " , the team specifically designed Thief to allow players to " pick [ it ] up and start playing " . While the team 's goal was to " push the envelope " with the game 's design , Church said that it shared its core design with previous Looking Glass Studios games . He explained : " [ We try to ] provide a range of player capability in [ a ] world [ where ] the player can choose their own goals , and their own approaches to an obstacle [ ... so that ] when they reach the goal it is far more satisfying " , and that " flexible simulation of game elements is a powerful way to enable the player to make their own way in the world " . 
 Thief was designed to be largely unscripted ; events , instead of being pre @-@ defined by designers , occur naturally . The intent was to further increase the amount of " player interaction and improvisation " over their previous games . According to Leonard , Thief 's central gameplay mechanic was the player 's relationship with NPCs , who are the primary obstacle in the game . The game 's goal of emergent events required a sophisticated AI system . Leonard later demonstrated that first @-@ person shooters , like Half @-@ Life , often utilize " look and listen " AI systems , wherein NPCs become aggressive when the player is seen or heard . He explained that the Thief system defined a broader range of " internal states " a NPC could feel , such as suspicion . For example , a NPC who heard a suspicious noise would investigate rather than become immediately hostile . 
 Designer Randy Smith said : " In Thief the safe boundary is often between light and shadow [ ... but ] these boundaries are [ ... ] not stable or secure [ ... . ] The player will eventually have to emerge from the safe zone [ ... ] and embrace risk until another safe boundary can be found " . He explained that players felt unsafe even when hidden , but learned to judge their level of safety as they improved . Certain levels included horror elements , and one such mission , Return to the Cathedral , intentionally removes players ' ability to judge their vulnerability . Believing that " nothing augments the fear associated with boundaries like forcing the player to violate them of their own free will " , Smith said of the mission : " Eventually [ you force ] yourself to do practically every scary thing you noticed the potential to do in the whole level " . Kieron Gillen of PC Gamer UK believed that the level creates " a cycle of relaxation and abhorrence [ ... that results ] in a devastating pummelling of the nerve endings . " 
 The game 's missions were designed to suit the story , rather than the story to fit the missions . Taking inspiration from GoldenEye 007 , the team added a difficulty system that changes mission objectives ; Leonard said " it allowed the designers to create a very different experience at each level of difficulty , without changing the overall geometry and structure of a mission . This gave the game a high degree of replayability at a minimum development cost " . The team extended the concept by decreasing the player 's ability to kill human characters on higher difficulty settings . Writer and voice actress Terri Brosius said : " We took pains to make sure all the missions could be won without killing any humans " . 
 Project director Greg LoPiccolo wanted Thief 's audio to both enrich the environment and enhance gameplay , and the game 's design necessitated an advanced sound system . The designers created a " room database " for every mission ; these provided a realistic representation of sound wave propagation . Audio designer Eric Brosius and the development team gave sound multiple roles . It was used to give the player aural clues about the NPCs ' locations and internal states ; to enhance this , vocals were recorded for NPCs . Conversely , sounds generated by objects gave clues to NPCs about the player 's location , and NPCs used sound to communicate ; a guard 's call for help signals other guards within earshot . Sound was also used to divulge narrative information , so that stealthy players could eavesdrop on NPC conversations and learn more about the game 's backstory . 
 = = = Technology = = = 
 Thief was developed with the Dark Engine , a proprietary game engine . It was written during the game 's development , rather than as a separately budgeted project , which led to time constraint issues . An emphasis was placed on simulating real life physics ; arrows would arc through the air rather than fly straight . The engine features alpha blending , texture filtering and lighting techniques . Motion capture technology was integrated to allow for realistic character animation . The engine 's renderer — which draws the graphics — was largely written by Looking Glass Studios programmer Sean Barrett in fall 1995 . While the renderer was expected to be finished before the game 's release date , Barrett left the company in 1996 . He later performed contract work for the company , and assisted in writing features like hardware support . However , the renderer was never fully addressed , and was less advanced than others of the time . 
 The Dark Engine was designed to be reusable , and to give programmers the ability to easily integrate their work . LeBlanc wrote the " Dark Object System " , which became the center of this concept . According to Leonard , the object system was a " general database for managing the individual objects in a simulation " . Designers were able to alter the game 's behavior by manipulating objects — the content that composes the game — without writing additional code . The system also managed source data , the game 's tangible content such as textures , maps , models and sounds . An unfinished build of the Dark Engine was used to develop System Shock 2 , a collaboration between Looking Glass and Irrational Games . The object system worked so well that Thief and System Shock 2 used the same executable for most of their development .

 Kieron Gillen of PC Gamer UK wrote : " The freedom Thief offers you is at first terrifying , then absolutely intoxicating . " Aaron Curtiss of Los Angeles Times noted that the game " demands thought " . T. Liam McDonald of PC Gamer US called Thief , " a challenging , riveting game that defies easy categorization " , and praised the game for its focus on the player 's cunning . Jason Cross of Computer Games Strategy Plus noted that " It 's quite amazing how much fun it can be to avoid action " . Chan Chun of New Straits Times described the game as being " incredibly immersive and suspenseful , " and " a highly @-@ recommended game for those yearning to be a night rogue .

" Wagner James Au of Salon.com noted that the game 's level of suspense was " exquisite " and that its use of detailed aural cues as a gameplay device bordered on virtual reality . 
 Thief 's graphics received a mixed reaction , with several negative comparisons to Half @-@ Life and Unreal . However , Andrew Sanchez of Maximum PC praised the game 's graphics and noted that the Dark Engine went " feature @-@ for @-@ feature with the LithTech , Quake , and Unreal engines " . He also praised the game 's AI , sound and plot . Larka disliked the game 's extremely dark areas , which required him to " max out the gamma correction and set [ his ] monitor to its brightest setting just to see the barest details " but called the graphics " seamless " . Some reviews complained about collision detection issues . 
 The game 's use of supernatural and cave @-@ exploring elements received criticism , and several reviewers opined that more realistic , mansion @-@ robbing missions should have been used instead . Presley believed that the game 's undead enemies caused the game to " degenerate into the standard hack ' n ' slash , sub @-@ Conan sort of thing that Heretic , Hexen and a million others gave us , " and that " it amounts to [ ... ] an erosion of the storytelling skills that Looking Glass once had . " Gillen decried certain levels for " <unk> [ ing ] on Tomb Raider territory , and then [ not ] quite pull [ ing ] it off " . Larka found certain levels too difficult . Next Generation noted that while " sneaking can get repetitive " , Thief is " still a fun game to play " and " a worthy addition to the genre . "

 Thief was the first 3D stealth game for a personal computer , and its stealth gameplay innovations influenced later games in the genre . The game has been cited as the first to use light and shadow as a stealth mechanic , and the first to use audio cues , such as the ability to eavesdrop on conversations and alert guards with loud footsteps . The game 's use of sound wave propagation , which allowed sounds to travel around corners and through rooms , became widely considered by game developers . Thief 's influence has been recognized in other stealth games , such as Assassin 's Creed , Hitman , Splinter Cell , and Tenchu . Marc Laidlaw , writer and designer on Half @-@ Life , said that " Thief is the single most terrifying , immersive , and rewarding game I have played and the one single @-@ player game I continue to replay . [ ... ] There are countless books I wish I had written ; Thief is one of the few games I wish I had worked on . " Laidlaw called Thief his favorite game , an opinion shared by Fallout 3 lead designer Emil Pagliarulo . 
 Thief : The Dark Project has been declared one of the greatest games of all time by several publications . <unk> it into its hall of fame , GameSpy writer Rich Carlson wrote : " With a tactical philosophy contrary to nearly every FPS action game at that time , Thief rewarded stealth and sneaking over brazen frontal assault , " continuing : " While inadvertently undermining the notion that all action games need be shooters , it carved a completely new niche in the same already glutted genre . " GameSpot editor Greg Kasavin argued that , while Metal Gear Solid , Tenchu : Stealth Assassins and Thief all defined the stealth action genre , it was Thief that displayed " the purest depiction of what it might be like to slip from shadow to shadow " and " largely remains an unsurpassed achievement in gaming . " In 2009 , Thief was added to IGN 's hall of fame . Sid Shuman , writing for GamePro , asserted that Thief " pioneered its own genre ... the stealth @-@ action title . " John Walker of Eurogamer wrote in a retrospective review : " Thief is an embarrassment to modern stealth games , each of which produces only a faded parody of this masterful original . " In 2012 , Mike Fahey of Kotaku called Thief " the best stealth game I 've ever played " , superior to modern games in the genre . That same year , Time named it one of the 100 greatest video games of all time . 
 Thief : The Dark Project was followed by two sequels , and a fourth game rebooting the series has also been released . Looking Glass Studios developed Thief II : The Metal Age , which received positive reviews when released in March 2000 . Thief : Deadly Shadows , released for both Windows and the Xbox , was developed by ION Storm Austin due to the 2000 closure of Looking Glass Studios . After a troubled development cycle , the game 's May 2004 release met with positive reviews . In May 2009 , a fourth Thief game was revealed to be in development by Eidos Montreal for Windows , PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 . It received mixed to positive reviews upon release . After Looking Glass Studios closed its doors , Thief has been supported by community modifications ( mods ) . Standalone fan made remake The Dark Mod aims to recreate the ' essence ' of Thief in a modern game engine . Originally released in 2009 as a mod for Doom 3 , in October 2013 it was released as an open source standalone game . In December 2013 , fan made high definition texture mod Thief Gold HD was released . 
 = Aposematism = 
 Aposematism ( from Greek <unk> apo away , σ <unk> <unk> sema sign , coined by Edward Bagnall Poulton ) , perhaps most commonly known in the context of warning coloration , describes a family of antipredator adaptations in which a warning signal is associated with the unprofitability of a prey item to potential predators . Aposematism always involves an advertising signal . The warning signal may take the form of conspicuous animal coloration , sounds , odours or other perceivable characteristics . Aposematic signals are beneficial for both the predator and prey , since both avoid potential harm . 
 Aposematism is exploited in Müllerian mimicry , where species with strong defences evolve to resemble one another . By mimicking similarly coloured species , the warning signal to predators is shared , causing them to learn more quickly at less of a cost to each of the species . 
 Warning signals do not necessarily require that a species actually possesses chemical or physical defences to deter predators . Mimics such as the <unk> California mountain kingsnake ( Lampropeltis zonata ) , which has yellow , red , and black bands similar to those of the highly venomous eastern coral snake ( Micrurus <unk> ) , have essentially <unk> on the successful aposematism of the model . The evolution of a warning signal by a mimicking species that resembles a species that possesses strong defences is known as Batesian mimicry . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The term Aposematism was coined by the English zoologist Edward Bagnall Poulton in his 1890 book The Colours of Animals . He based the term on the Ancient Greek words <unk> apo away , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sign , referring to signs that warn other animals away . 
 = = Defence mechanism = = 
 The function of aposematism is to prevent attack , by warning potential predators that the prey animal has defences such as being unpalatable or poisonous . The easily detected warning is a primary defence mechanism , and the non @-@ visible defences are secondary . Aposematic signals are primarily visual , using bright colours and high @-@ contrast patterns such as stripes . Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey , because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness . Thus , the brighter and more conspicuous the organism , the more toxic it usually is . The most common and effective colours are red , yellow , black and white . These colours provide strong contrast with green foliage , resist changes in shadow and lighting , have strong contrast , are highly chromatic , and provide distance dependent camouflage . Some forms of warning colouration provide this distance dependent camouflage by having an effective pattern and colour combination that do not allow for easy detection by a predator from a distance , but are warning @-@ like from a close proximity , allowing for an advantageous balance between camouflage and aposematism . Warning colouration evolves in response to background , light conditions , and predator vision . Visible signals may be accompanied by odours , sounds or behaviour to provide a multi @-@ modal signal which is more effectively detected by predators . 
 <unk> , broadly understood , can be created in a variety of ways . Some insects such as the ladybird or tiger moth contain bitter @-@ tasting chemicals , while the skunk produces a noxious odour , and the poison glands of the poison dart frog , the sting of a velvet ant or neurotoxin in a black widow spider make them dangerous or painful to attack . Tiger moths advertise their unpalatability by either producing ultrasonic noises which warn bats to avoid them , or by warning postures which expose brightly coloured body parts ( see <unk> ) , or exposing eyespots . Velvet ants ( actually parasitic wasps ) such as <unk> occidentalis both have bright colours and produce audible noises when grabbed ( via stridulation ) , which serve to reinforce the warning . Among mammals , predators can be dissuaded when a smaller animal is aggressive and able to defend itself , as for example in honey badgers . 
 = = Prevalence = = 
 = = = In terrestrial ecosystems = = = 
 Aposematism is widespread in insects , but less so in vertebrates , being mostly confined to a smaller number of reptile , amphibian , and fish species . Perhaps the most numerous aposematic vertebrates are the poison dart frogs . Some plants are thought to employ aposematism to warn herbivores of unpalatable chemicals or physical defences such as <unk> leaves or thorns . Many insects , such as cinnabar moth caterpillars , acquire toxic chemicals from their host plants . Among mammals , skunks and <unk> advertise their foul @-@ smelling chemical defences with sharply contrasting black @-@ and @-@ white patterns on their fur . Some brightly coloured birds such as passerines with contrasting patterns may also be aposematic , at least in females ; but since male birds are often brightly coloured through sexual selection , and their colouration is not correlated with edibility , it is unclear whether aposematism is significant . 
 = = = In marine ecosystems = = = 
 The existence of aposematism in marine ecosystems is controversial . Many marine organisms , particularly those on coral reefs , are brightly coloured or patterned , including sponges , corals , molluscs and fishes , with little or no connection to chemical or physical defenses . Caribbean reef sponges are brightly coloured , and many of them are chemically defended , but there is no relationship between the two factors . 
 <unk> molluscs are the most commonly cited examples of aposematism in marine ecosystems , but the evidence for this has been contested , mostly because ( 1 ) there are few examples of mimicry among species , ( 2 ) many species are nocturnal or cryptic , and ( 3 ) bright colours at the red end of the colour spectrum are rapidly attenuated as a function of water depth . For example , the Spanish Dancer <unk> ( genus <unk> ) , among the largest of tropical marine slugs , potently chemically defended , and brilliantly red and white , is nocturnal and has no known mimics . Mimicry is to be expected as Batesian mimics with weak defences can gain a measure of protection from their resemblance to aposematic species . Other studies have concluded that nudibranchs such as the slugs of the family <unk> from Indo @-@ Pacific coral reefs are aposematically coloured . Müllerian mimicry has been implicated in the colouration of some Mediterranean nudibranchs , all of which derive defensive chemicals from their sponge diet . 
 The crown @-@ of @-@ thorns starfish , like other starfish such as <unk> <unk> , has conspicuous coloration and conspicuous long , sharp spines , as well as chemical defences in the form of saponins ; this evidence is argued to be sufficient for such species to be considered aposematic . It has been proposed that aposematism and mimicry is less evident in marine invertebrates than terrestrial insects because predation is a more intense selective force for many insects , which also disperse as adults rather than as larvae and have much shorter generation times . Further , there is evidence that fish predators such as <unk> may adapt to visual cues more rapidly than do birds , making aposematism less effective . 
 Blue @-@ ringed octopuses are venomous . They spend much of their time hiding in crevices whilst displaying effective camouflage patterns with their dermal chromatophore cells . However , if they are provoked , they quickly change colour , becoming bright yellow with each of the 50 @-@ 60 rings flashing bright iridescent blue within a third of a second . It is often stated this is an aposematic warning display , although it is pointed out that such statements are often made without the hypothesis being tested . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 The defence mechanism relies on the memory of the would @-@ be predator ; a bird that has once experienced a foul @-@ tasting grasshopper will endeavour to avoid a repetition of the experience . As a consequence , aposematic species are often gregarious . Before the memory of a bad experience attenuates , the predator may have the experience reinforced through repetition . Aposematic organisms often move in a languid fashion , as they have little need for speed and agility . Instead , their morphology is frequently tough and resistant to injury , thereby allowing them to escape once the predator is warned off . Aposematic species do not need to hide or stay still as cryptic organisms do , so aposematic individuals benefit from more freedom in exposed areas and can spend more time foraging , allowing them to find more and better quality food . Aposematic individuals can similarly make use of conspicuous mating displays . 
 = = Origins of the theory = = 
 = = = Wallace , 1867 = = = 
 Alfred Russel Wallace suggested in a letter to Charles Darwin that the conspicuous colour schemes of some insects might have evolved through natural selection as a warning to predators . Darwin had proposed that conspicuous colouration could be explained in many species by means of sexual selection , but had realised that this could not explain the bright colouration of some caterpillars , since these larvae were not sexually active . Wallace replied that just as the contrasting coloured bands of a hornet warned of its defensive sting , so the bright colours of the caterpillar could warn of its unpalatability . Since Darwin was enthusiastic about the idea , in 1867 Wallace asked the Entomological Society of London to test the hypothesis . In response , the entomologist John Jenner Weir conducted experiments with caterpillars and birds in his aviary , and in 1869 he provided the first experimental evidence for warning colouration in animals . 
 = = = Poulton , 1890 = = = 
 The concept of warning colouration was extended by Edward Bagnall Poulton in The Colours of Animals ( 1890 ) : 
 When an animal possesses an unpleasant attribute , it is often to its advantage to advertise the fact as publicly as possible . In this way it escapes a great deal of experimental ' tasting . ' The conspicuous patterns and strongly contrasted colours which serve as the signal of danger or inedibility are known as Warning Colours ... It is these Warning Colours which are nearly always the objects of Protective Mimicry , and it will therefore be convenient to describe the former before the latter . 
 Poulton introduced the term aposematism in the same book with the words : 
 The second head ( <unk> Colours ) includes Warning Colours and Recognition Markings : the former warn an enemy off , and are therefore called Aposematic [ Greek , apo , from , and sema , sign ] 
 = = Evolution = = 
 Aposematism is paradoxical in evolutionary terms , as it makes individuals conspicuous to predators , so they may be killed and the trait eliminated before predators learn to avoid it . If warning colouration puts the first few individuals at such a strong disadvantage , it would never last in the species long enough to become beneficial . 
 = = = Supported explanations = = = 
 There is evidence for explanations involving dietary conservatism , in which predators avoid new prey because it is an unknown quantity ; this is a long @-@ lasting effect . Dietary conservatism has been demonstrated experimentally in some species of birds . Further , birds recall and avoid objects that are both conspicuous and foul @-@ tasting longer than objects that are equally foul @-@ tasting but cryptically coloured . This suggests that Wallace 's original view , that warning colouration helped to teach predators to avoid prey thus coloured , was correct . However , some birds ( inexperienced starlings and domestic chicks ) also innately avoid conspicuously coloured objects , as demonstrated using mealworms painted yellow and black to resemble wasps , with dull green controls . This implies that warning colouration works at least in part by stimulating the evolution of predators to encode the meaning of the warning signal , rather than by requiring each new generation to learn the signal 's meaning . All of these results contradict the idea that novel , brightly coloured individuals would be more likely to be eaten or attacked by predators . 
 = = = Alternative hypotheses = = = 
 Other explanations are possible . Predators might innately fear unfamiliar forms ( neophobia ) long enough for them to become established , but this is likely to be only temporary . 
 Alternatively , prey animals might be sufficiently gregarious to form clusters tight enough to enhance the warning signal . If the species was already unpalatable , predators might learn to avoid the cluster , protecting gregarious individuals with the new aposematic trait . <unk> would assist predators to learn to avoid unpalatable , gregarious prey . Aposematism could also be favoured in dense populations even if these are not gregarious . 
 Another possibility is that a gene for aposematism might be recessive and located on the X chromosome . If so , predators would learn to associate the colour with unpalatability from males with the trait , while heterozygous females carry the trait until it becomes common and predators understand the signal . Well @-@ fed predators might also ignore aposematic morphs , preferring other prey species . 
 A further explanation is that females might prefer brighter males , so sexual selection could result in aposematic males having higher reproductive success than non @-@ aposematic males if they can survive long enough to mate . Sexual selection is strong enough to allow seemingly maladaptive traits to persist despite other factors working against the trait . 
 Once aposematic individuals reach a certain threshold population , for whatever reason , the predator learning process would be spread out over a larger number of individuals and therefore is less likely to wipe out the trait for warning colouration completely . If the population of aposematic individuals all originated from the same few individuals , the predator learning process would result in a stronger warning signal for surviving kin , resulting in higher inclusive fitness for the dead or injured individuals through kin selection . 
 = = Mimicry = = 
 Aposematism is a sufficiently successful strategy to have had significant effects on the evolution of both aposematic and non @-@ aposematic species . 
 Non @-@ aposematic species have often evolved to mimic the conspicuous markings of their aposematic counterparts . For example , the hornet moth is a mimic of the yellowjacket wasp ; it resembles the wasp , but has no sting . A predator which avoids the wasp will to some degree also avoid the moth . This is known as Batesian mimicry , after Henry Walter Bates , a British naturalist who studied Amazonian butterflies in the second half of the 19th century . Batesian mimicry is frequency dependent : it is most effective when the ratio of mimic to model is low ; otherwise , predators learn to recognise the impostors . 
 A second form of mimicry occurs when two aposematic organisms share the same anti @-@ predator adaptation and mimic each other , to the benefit of both species , since fewer individuals of either species need to be attacked for predators to learn to avoid both of them . This form of mimicry is known as Müllerian mimicry , after Fritz Müller , a German naturalist who studied the phenomenon in the Amazon in the late 19th century . Many species of bee and wasp that occur together are Müllerian mimics ; their similar colouration teaches predators that a striped pattern is associated with being stung . Therefore , a predator which has had a negative experience with any such species will likely avoid any that resemble it in the future . Müllerian mimicry is found in vertebrates such as the mimic poison frog ( <unk> imitator ) which has several morphs throughout its natural geographical range , each of which looks very similar to a different species of poison frog which lives in that area . 
 = Robert of Jumièges = 
 Robert of Jumièges ( sometimes Robert <unk> or Robert <unk> ; died between 1052 and 1055 ) was the first Norman Archbishop of Canterbury . He had previously served as prior of the Abbey of St Ouen at Rouen in Normandy , before becoming abbot of Jumièges Abbey , near Rouen , in 1037 . He was a good friend and adviser to the king of England , Edward the Confessor , who appointed him Bishop of London in 1044 , and then archbishop in 1051 . Robert 's time as archbishop lasted only about eighteen months . He had already come into conflict with the powerful Godwin , Earl of Wessex , and while archbishop made attempts to recover lands lost to Godwin and his family . He also refused to consecrate Spearhafoc , Edward 's choice to succeed Robert as Bishop of London . The rift between Robert and Godwin culminated in Robert 's deposition and exile in 1052 . 
 A Norman medieval chronicler claimed that Robert travelled to Normandy in 1051 or 1052 and told Duke William of Normandy , the future William the Conqueror , that Edward wished for him to become his heir . The exact timing of Robert 's trip , and whether he actually made it , have been the subject of debate among historians . The archbishop died in exile at Jumièges sometime between 1052 and 1055 . Robert commissioned significant building work at Jumièges and was probably involved in the first Romanesque building in England , the church built in Westminster for Edward the Confessor , now known as Westminster Abbey . Robert 's treatment by the English was used by William the Conqueror as one of the justifications for his invasion of England . 
 = = Background and life in Normandy = = 
 Robert was prior of the monastery of St Ouen at Rouen before he became abbot of the important Jumièges Abbey in 1037 . Jumièges had been refounded under William <unk> , Duke of <unk> around 940 , Its ties with the ducal family were close and it played a role in ducal government and church reform . Robert 's alternate surname " <unk> " or " <unk> " probably derived from <unk> , a term for the part of a crop paid as rent to a landlord . Besides evidence that the preceding abbot at Jumièges was a relative , Robert 's origin and family background are otherwise unknown . While abbot , Robert began construction of the abbey church , in the new Romanesque style . 
 Robert became friendly with Edward the Confessor , a claimant to the English throne , while Edward was living in exile in Normandy , probably in the 1030s . Edward was the son of Æthelred the Unready , king of England , who had been replaced by Cnut the Great in 1016 . Cnut subsequently married Æthelred 's widow Emma of Normandy , Edward 's mother , and had a son with her , Harthacanute . For their own safety , Edward and his brother Alfred were sent to Emma 's relatives in Normandy . After Cnut 's death in 1035 , Harold Harefoot , his elder son by his first wife , acceded to the English throne . Following Harald 's death in 1040 , Harthacanute succeeded him for a short time , but as neither Harald nor Harthacanute left offspring , the throne was offered to Edward on Harthacanute 's death in 1042 . There is some evidence that Edward spent some of his time in exile around Jumièges , as after becoming king he gave gifts to the abbey . 
 = = Bishop and Archbishop = = 
 Robert accompanied Edward the Confessor on Edward 's recall to England in 1042 to become king following Harthacanute 's death . It was due to Edward that in August 1044 Robert was appointed Bishop of London , one of the first episcopal vacancies which occurred in Edward 's reign . Robert remained close to the king and was the leader of the party opposed to Earl Godwin , Earl of Wessex . Godwin , for his part , was attempting to expand the influence of his family , which had already acquired much land . His daughter was Edward 's queen , and two of his sons were elevated to earldoms . The Life of Saint Edward , a hagiographical work on King Edward 's life , claimed that Robert " was always the most powerful confidential adviser of the king " . Robert seems to have favoured closer relations with Normandy , and its duke . Edward himself had grown up in the duchy , and spent 25 years in exile there before his return to England . He brought many Normans with him to England , and seems to have spent much time in their company . 
 When Archbishop Eadsige of Canterbury died in October 1050 , the post remained vacant for five months . The cathedral chapter elected Æthelric , a kinsman of Godwin and a monk at Canterbury , but were over @-@ ruled when Edward appointed Robert Archbishop of Canterbury the following year . Godwin was attempting to exercise his power of patronage over the archbishopric , but the king 's appointment signalled that the king was willing to contest with the earl over the traditional royal rights at Canterbury . Although the monks of Canterbury opposed it , the king 's appointment stood . Robert went to Rome to receive his pallium and returned to England where he was ceremonially enthroned at Canterbury on 29 June 1051 . Some Norman chroniclers state that he visited Normandy on this trip and informed Duke William , the future William the Conqueror , that he was the childless King Edward 's heir . According to these chroniclers , the decision to make William the heir had been decided at the same lenten royal council in 1051 that had declared Robert archbishop . 
 After returning from Rome , Robert refused to consecrate Spearhafoc , the Abbot of Abingdon and the king 's goldsmith , as his successor to the bishopric of London , claiming that Pope Leo IX had forbidden the consecration . Almost certainly the grounds were simony , the purchase of ecclesiastical office , as Leo had recently issued proclamations against the practice . In refusing to consecrate Spearhafoc , Robert may have been following his own interests against the wishes of both the king and Godwin , as he had his own candidate , a Norman , in mind . In the end Robert 's favoured candidate , William the Norman , was consecrated instead of Spearhafoc . Robert also discovered that some lands belonging to Canterbury had fallen into Godwin 's hands , but his efforts to recover them through the shire courts were unsuccessful . Canterbury had lost control of some revenues from the shire of Kent to Godwin during Eadsige 's tenure as archbishop , which Robert unsuccessfully attempted to reclaim . These disputes over the estates and revenues of the archbishopric contributed to the friction between Robert and Godwin , which had begun with Robert 's election . Robert 's election had disrupted Godwin 's patronage powers in Canterbury , and now Robert 's efforts to recover lands Godwin had seized from Canterbury challenged the earl 's economic rights . Events came to a head at a council held at Gloucester in September 1051 , when Robert accused Earl Godwin of plotting to kill King Edward . Godwin and his family were exiled ; afterwards Robert claimed the office of sheriff of Kent , probably on the strength of Eadsige , his predecessor as Archbishop , having held the office . 
 Although Robert refused to consecrate Spearhafoc , there is little evidence that he was interested in the growing movement towards Church reform being promulgated by the papacy . Pope Leo IX was beginning a reform movement later known as the Gregorian Reform , initially focused on improving the clergy and prohibiting simony . In 1049 Leo IX declared that he would take more interest in English church matters and would investigate episcopal candidates more strictly before confirming them . It may have been partly to appease Leo that Edward appointed Robert instead of Æthelric , hoping to signal to the papacy that the English crown was not totally opposed to the growing reform movement . It was against this backdrop that Robert refused to consecrate Spearhafoc , although there is no other evidence that Robert embraced the reform position , and his claim that the pope forbade the consecration may have had more to do with finding an easy excuse than any true desire for reform . There are also some indications that Spearhafoc was allied to Godwin , and his appointment was meant as a quid pro quo for the non @-@ appointment of Æthelric . If true , Robert 's refusal to consecrate Spearhafoc would have contributed to the growing rift between the archbishop and the earl . 
 = = Royal adviser = = 
 The Life of Saint Edward claims that while Godwin was in exile Robert tried to persuade King Edward to divorce Edith , Godwin 's daughter , but Edward refused and instead she was sent to a nunnery . However , the Life is a hagiography , written soon after Edward 's death to show Edward as a saint . Thus it stresses that Edward voluntarily remained celibate , something unlikely to have been true and not corroborated by any other source . Modern historians have felt it more likely that Edward , at Robert 's urging , wished to divorce Edith and remarry in order to have children to succeed him on the English throne , although it is possible that he merely wished to be rid of her , without necessarily wanting a divorce . 
 During Godwin 's exile , Robert is said to have been sent by the king on an errand to William , Duke of Normandy . The reason for the embassy is uncertain . William of Jumièges says that Robert went to tell Duke William that Edward wished William to be his heir . The medieval writer William of Poitiers gives the same reason , but also adds that Robert took with him as hostages Godwin 's son Wulfnoth and grandson Hakon ( son of Sweyn ) . The Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle is silent on the visit however , so it is uncertain whether Robert visited Normandy or not , or why he did so . The entire history of the various missions which Robert is alleged to have made is confused , and complicated by propaganda claims made by Norman chroniclers after the Norman Conquest in 1066 , leaving it unclear if Robert visited Normandy on his way to receive his pallium or after Godwin was in exile , or if he went twice or not at all . 
 = = <unk> , death , and legacy = = 
 After Godwin left England , he went to Flanders , and gathered a fleet and mercenaries to force the king to allow his return . In the summer of 1052 , Godwin returned to England and was met by his sons , who had invaded from Ireland . By September , they were advancing on London , where negotiations between the king and the earl were conducted with the help of Stigand , the Bishop of Winchester . When it became apparent that Godwin would be returning , Robert quickly left England with Bishop Ulf of <unk> and Bishop William of London , probably once again taking Wulfnoth and Hakon with him as hostages , whether with the permission of King Edward or not . Robert was declared an outlaw and deposed from his archbishopric on 14 September 1052 at a royal council , mainly because the returning Godwin felt that Robert , along with a number of other Normans , had been the driving force behind his exile . Robert journeyed to Rome to complain to the pope about his own exile , where Leo IX and successive popes condemned Stigand , whom Edward had appointed to Canterbury . Robert 's personal property was divided between Earl Godwin , Harold Godwinson , and the queen , who had returned to court . 
 Robert died at Jumièges , but the date of his death is unclear . Various dates are given , with Ian Walker , the biographer of Harold arguing for between 1053 and 1055 , but H. E. J. Cowdrey , who wrote Robert 's Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry , says on 26 May in either 1052 or 1055 . H. R. <unk> , another modern historian , argues that it is likely that he died in 1053 . 
 Robert 's treatment was used by William the Conqueror as one of the justifications for his invasion of England , the other being that Edward had named William his heir . Ian Walker , author of the most recent scholarly biography of Harold Godwinson , suggests that it was Robert , while in exile after the return of Godwin , who testified that King Edward had nominated Duke William to be Edward 's heir . However , this view is contradicted by David Douglas , a historian and biographer of William the Conqueror , who believes that Robert merely relayed Edward 's decision , probably while Robert was on his way to Rome to receive his pallium . Several medieval chroniclers , including the author of the Life of Saint Edward , felt that the blame for Edward and Godwin 's conflict in 1051 – 1052 lay squarely with Robert ; modern historians tend to see Robert as an ambitious man , with little political skill . 
 = = Artistic patronage = = 
 In notable contrast to his successor Stigand , Robert does not figure among the important benefactors to English churches , but we know of some transfers to Jumièges of important English church treasures , the first trickle of what was to become a flood of treasure taken to Normandy after the Conquest . These included the relic of the head of Saint Valentine only recently given to the monks of Winchester Cathedral by Emma of Normandy . Though the Winchester head remained in place , another one appeared at Jumièges ; he " must have clandestinely removed the head , or at least the greater part of it , and left his monks to venerate the empty or nearly empty <unk> " . Two of the four most important surviving late Anglo @-@ Saxon illuminated manuscripts went the same way , thus probably preventing their destruction in a series of fires that devastated the major English libraries . One is the so @-@ called Missal of Robert of Jumièges , actually a <unk> with thirteen surviving full @-@ page miniatures , which bears an inscription apparently in Robert 's own hand recording its donation to Jumièges when he was Bishop of London , and the other the so @-@ called Benedictional of Archbishop Robert , actually a pontifical with three remaining full @-@ page miniatures and other decoration ( respectively Rouen , Bibliothèque <unk> , Manuscripts <unk> and <unk> ) . The latter may well have been commissioned by Æthelgar , Robert 's predecessor as Archbishop in 988 – 90 , although it is possible the " Archbishop Robert " of the traditional name is Emma 's brother Robert , Archbishop of Rouen from 990 to 1037 . These masterpieces of the Winchester style were the most elaborately decorated Anglo @-@ Saxon manuscripts known to have reached Normandy , either before or after the Conquest , and influenced the much less @-@ developed local style , though this remained very largely restricted to initials . 
 Before he came to England , Robert had begun the construction of a new abbey church at Jumièges , in the new Romanesque style which was then becoming popular , and introduced to Normandy the two @-@ towered western facade from the Rhineland . On his return to Normandy he continued to build there , and the abbey church was not finished until 1067 . Although the choir has been torn down , the towers , nave and transepts have survived . Robert probably influenced Edward the Confessor 's rebuilding of the church at Westminster Abbey , the first known building in the Romanesque style in England , which is so described by William of Malmesbury . Edward 's work began in about 1050 and was completed just before his death in 1065 . The recorded name of one of the senior masons , " <unk> the <unk> " indicates foreign origins , and Robert may have arranged for Norman masons to be brought over , though other names are English . It is possible that Westminster influenced the building at Jumièges , as the arcade there closely resembles Westminster 's arcade , both of them in a style that never became common in Normandy . The Early Romanesque style of both was to be superseded after the Conquest by the Anglo @-@ Norman High Romanesque style pioneered in Canterbury Cathedral and St Étienne , Caen by Lanfranc .

It was first performed in Dublin on 13 April 1742 and received its London premiere nearly a year later . After an initially modest public reception , the oratorio gained in popularity , eventually becoming one of the best @-@ known and most frequently performed choral works in Western music . 
 Handel 's reputation in England , where he had lived since 1712 , had been established through his compositions of Italian opera . He turned to English oratorio in the 1730s in response to changes in public taste ; Messiah was his sixth work in this genre . Although its structure resembles that of opera , it is not in dramatic form ; there are no impersonations of characters and no direct speech . Instead , Jennens 's text is an extended reflection on Jesus Christ as Messiah . The text begins in Part I with prophecies by Isaiah and others , and moves to the annunciation to the shepherds , the only " scene " taken from the Gospels . In Part II , Handel concentrates on the Passion and ends with the " Hallelujah " chorus . In Part III he covers the resurrection of the dead and Christ 's glorification in heaven . 
 Handel wrote Messiah for modest vocal and instrumental forces , with optional settings for many of the individual numbers . In the years after his death , the work was adapted for performance on a much larger scale , with giant orchestras and choirs . In other efforts to update it , its orchestration was revised and amplified by ( among others ) Mozart . In the late 20th and early 21st centuries the trend has been towards reproducing a greater fidelity to Handel 's original intentions , although " big Messiah " productions continue to be mounted . A near @-@ complete version was issued on 78 rpm discs in 1928 ; since then the work has been recorded many times . 
 = = Background = = 
 The composer George Frideric Handel , born in Halle , Germany in 1685 , took up permanent residence in London in 1712 , and became a naturalised British subject in 1727 . By 1741 his pre @-@ eminence in British music was evident from the honours he had accumulated , including a pension from the court of King George II , the office of Composer of Musick for the Chapel Royal , and — most unusually for a living person — a statue erected in his honour in Vauxhall Gardens . Within a large and varied musical output , Handel was a vigorous champion of Italian opera , which he had introduced to London in 1711 with Rinaldo . He subsequently wrote and presented more than 40 such operas in London 's theatres . 
 By the early 1730s public taste for Italian opera was beginning to fade . The popular success of John Gay and Johann Christoph Pepusch 's The Beggar 's Opera ( first performed in 1728 ) had heralded a spate of English @-@ language ballad @-@ operas that mocked the pretensions of Italian opera . With box @-@ office receipts falling , Handel 's productions were increasingly reliant on private subsidies from the nobility . Such funding became harder to obtain after the launch in 1730 of the " Opera of the Nobility " , a rival company to his own . Handel overcame this challenge , but he spent large sums of his own money in doing so . 
 Although prospects for Italian opera were declining , Handel remained committed to the genre , but as alternatives to his staged works he began to introduce English @-@ language oratorios . In Rome in 1707 – 08 he had written two Italian oratorios at a time when opera performances in the city were temporarily forbidden under papal decree . His first venture into English oratorio had been Esther , which was written and performed for a private patron in about 1718 . In 1732 Handel brought a revised and expanded version of Esther to the King 's Theatre , Haymarket , where members of the royal family attended a glittering premiere on 6 May . Its success encouraged Handel to write two more oratorios ( Deborah and <unk> ) . All three oratorios were performed to large and appreciative audiences at the Sheldonian Theatre in Oxford in mid @-@ 1733 . Undergraduates reportedly sold their furniture to raise the money for the five @-@ shilling tickets . 
 In 1735 Handel received the text for a new oratorio named Saul from its librettist Charles Jennens , a wealthy landowner with musical and literary interests . Because Handel 's main creative concern was still with opera , he did not write the music for Saul until 1738 , in preparation for his 1738 – 39 theatrical season . The work , after opening at the King 's Theatre in January 1739 to a warm reception , was quickly followed by the less successful oratorio Israel in Egypt ( which may also have come from Jennens ) . Although Handel continued to write operas , the trend towards English @-@ language productions became irresistible as the decade ended . After three performances of his last Italian opera <unk> in January and February 1741 , he abandoned the genre . In July 1741 Jennens sent him a new libretto for an oratorio ; in a letter dated 10 July to his friend Edward Holdsworth , Jennens wrote : " I hope [ Handel ] will lay out his whole Genius & Skill upon it , that the Composition may <unk> all his former Compositions , as the Subject <unk> every other subject . The Subject is Messiah " . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 In the Christian tradition the figure of the " Messiah " or redeemer is identified with the person of Jesus , known by his followers as the Christ or " Jesus Christ " . Handel 's Messiah has been described by the early @-@ music scholar Richard Luckett as " a commentary on [ Jesus Christ 's ] Nativity , Passion , Resurrection and Ascension " , beginning with God 's promises as spoken by the prophets and ending with Christ 's glorification in heaven . In contrast with most of Handel 's oratorios , the singers in Messiah do not assume dramatic roles ; there is no single , dominant narrative voice ; and very little use is made of quoted speech . In his libretto , Jennens 's intention was not to dramatise the life and teachings of Jesus , but to acclaim the " Mystery of Godliness " , using a compilation of extracts from the Authorized ( King James ) Version of the Bible , and from the Psalms included in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer . 
 The three @-@ part structure of the work approximates to that of Handel 's three @-@ act operas , with the " parts " subdivided by Jennens into " scenes " . Each scene is a collection of individual numbers or " movements " which take the form of recitatives , arias and choruses . There are two instrumental numbers , the opening <unk> in the style of a French overture , and the pastoral <unk> , often called the " pastoral symphony " , at the mid @-@ point of Part I. 
 In Part I , the Messiah 's coming and the virgin birth are predicted by the Old Testament prophets . The annunciation to the shepherds of the birth of the Christ is represented in the words of Luke 's gospel . Part II covers Christ 's passion and his death , his resurrection and ascension , the first spreading of the gospel through the world , and a definitive statement of God 's glory summarised in the " Hallelujah " . Part III begins with the promise of redemption , followed by a prediction of the day of judgment and the " general resurrection " , ending with the final victory over sin and death and the acclamation of Christ . According to the musicologist Donald Burrows , much of the text is so allusive as to be largely incomprehensible to those ignorant of the biblical accounts . For the benefit of his audiences Jennens printed and issued a pamphlet explaining the reasons for his choices of scriptural selections .

 Charles Jennens was born around 1700 , into a prosperous landowning family whose lands and properties in Warwickshire and Leicestershire he eventually inherited . His religious and political views — he opposed the Act of Settlement of 1701 which secured the accession to the British throne for the House of Hanover — prevented him from receiving his degree from Balliol College , Oxford , or from pursuing any form of public career . His family 's wealth enabled him to live a life of leisure while devoting himself to his literary and musical interests . Although the musicologist Watkins Shaw dismisses Jennens as " a conceited figure of no special ability " , Donald Burrows has written : " of Jennens 's musical literacy there can be no doubt " . He was certainly devoted to Handel 's music , having helped to finance the publication of every Handel score since Rodelinda in 1725 . By 1741 , after their collaboration on Saul , a warm friendship had developed between the two , and Handel was a frequent visitor to the Jennens family estate at <unk> . 
 Jennens 's letter to Holdsworth of 10 July 1741 , in which he first mentions Messiah , suggests that the text was a recent work , probably assembled earlier that summer . As a devout Anglican and believer in scriptural authority , part of Jennens 's intention was to challenge advocates of Deism , who rejected the doctrine of divine intervention in human affairs . Shaw describes the text as " a meditation of our Lord as Messiah in Christian thought and belief " , and despite his reservations on Jennens 's character , concedes that the finished <unk> " amounts to little short of a work of genius " . There is no evidence that Handel played any active role in the selection or preparation of the text , such as he did in the case of Saul ; it seems , rather , that he saw no need to make any significant amendment to Jennens 's work . 
 = = = Composition = = = 
 The music for Messiah was completed in 24 days of swift composition . Having received Jennens 's text some time after 10 July 1741 , Handel began work on it on 22 August . His records show that he had completed Part I in outline by 28 August , Part II by 6 September and Part III by 12 September , followed by two days of " filling up " to produce the finished work on 14 September . The autograph score 's 259 pages show some signs of haste such as blots , scratchings @-@ out , unfilled bars and other uncorrected errors , but according to the music scholar Richard Luckett the number of errors is remarkably small in a document of this length . The original manuscript for Messiah is now held in the British Library 's music collection . 
 At the end of his manuscript Handel wrote the letters " SDG " — Soli Deo Gloria , " To God alone the glory " . This inscription , taken with the speed of composition , has encouraged belief in the apocryphal story that Handel wrote the music in a fervour of divine inspiration in which , as he wrote the " Hallelujah " chorus , " he saw all heaven before him " . Burrows points out that many of Handel 's operas , of comparable length and structure to Messiah , were composed within similar timescales between theatrical seasons . The effort of writing so much music in so short a time was not unusual for Handel and his contemporaries ; Handel commenced his next oratorio , Samson , within a week of finishing Messiah , and completed his draft of this new work in a month . In accordance with his frequent practice when writing new works , Handel adapted existing compositions for use in Messiah , in this case drawing on two recently completed Italian duets and one written twenty years previously . Thus , Se tu non <unk> amore from 1722 became the basis of " O Death , where is thy sting ? " ; " His yoke is easy " and " And he shall purify " were drawn from Quel <unk> che alla <unk> ( July 1741 ) , " Unto us a child is born " and " All we like sheep " from <unk> , di voi non vo ' <unk> ( July 1741 ) . Handel 's instrumentation in the score is often imprecise , again in line with contemporary convention , where the use of certain instruments and combinations was assumed and did not need to be written down by the composer ; later copyists would fill in the details . 
 Before the first performance Handel made numerous revisions to his manuscript score , in part to match the forces available for the 1742 Dublin premiere ; it is probable that his work was not performed as originally conceived in his lifetime . Between 1742 and 1754 he continued to revise and recompose individual movements , sometimes to suit the requirements of particular singers . The first published score of Messiah was issued in 1767 , eight years after Handel 's death , though this was based on relatively early manuscripts and included none of Handel 's later revisions .

 = = = Dublin , 1742 = = = 
 Handel 's decision to give a season of concerts in Dublin in the winter of 1741 – 42 arose from an invitation from the Duke of Devonshire , then serving as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland . A violinist friend of Handel 's , Matthew Dubourg , was in Dublin as the Lord Lieutenant 's bandmaster ; he would look after the tour 's orchestral requirements . Whether Handel originally intended to perform Messiah in Dublin is uncertain ; he did not inform Jennens of any such plan , for the latter wrote to Holdsworth on 2 December 1741 : " ... it was some mortification to me to hear that instead of performing Messiah here he has gone into Ireland with it . " After arriving in Dublin on 18 November 1741 , Handel arranged a subscription series of six concerts , to be held between December 1741 and February 1742 at the Great Music Hall , <unk> Street . These concerts were so popular that a second series was quickly arranged ; Messiah figured in neither series . 
 In early March Handel began discussions with the appropriate committees for a charity concert , to be given in April , at which he intended to present Messiah . He sought and was given permission from St Patrick 's and Christ Church cathedrals to use their choirs for this occasion . These forces amounted to 16 men and 16 boy choristers ; several of the men were allocated solo parts . The women soloists were Christina Maria Avoglio , who had sung the main soprano roles in the two subscription series , and Susannah Cibber , an established stage actress and contralto who had sung in the second series . To accommodate Cibber 's vocal range , the recitative " Then shall the eyes of the blind " and the aria " He shall feed his flock " were transposed down to F major . The performance , also in the <unk> Street hall , was originally announced for 12 April , but was deferred for a day " at the request of persons of Distinction " . The orchestra in Dublin comprised strings , two trumpets , and timpani ; the number of players is unknown . Handel had his own organ shipped to Ireland for the performances ; a harpsichord was probably also used . 
 The three charities that were to benefit were prisoners ' debt relief , the Mercer 's Hospital , and the Charitable Infirmary . In its report on a public rehearsal , the Dublin News @-@ Letter described the oratorio as " ... far surpass [ ing ] anything of that Nature which has been performed in this or any other Kingdom " . Seven hundred people attended the premiere on 13 April . So that the largest possible audience could be admitted to the concert , gentlemen were requested to remove their swords , and ladies were asked not to wear hoops in their dresses . The performance earned unanimous praise from the assembled press : " Words are wanting to express the exquisite delight it afforded to the admiring and <unk> Audience " . A Dublin clergyman , Rev. Delaney , was so overcome by Susanna Cibber 's rendering of " He was despised " that reportedly he leapt to his feet and cried : " Woman , for this be all thy sins forgiven thee ! " The takings amounted to around £ 400 , providing about £ 127 to each of the three nominated charities and securing the release of 142 indebted prisoners . 
 Handel remained in Dublin for four months after the premiere . He organised a second performance of Messiah on 3 June , which was announced as " the last Performance of Mr Handel 's during his Stay in this Kingdom " . In this second Messiah , which was for Handel 's private financial benefit , Cibber reprised her role from the first performance , though Avoglio may have been replaced by a Mrs Maclaine ; details of other performers are not recorded . 
 = = = London , 1743 – 59 = = = 
 The warm reception accorded to Messiah in Dublin was not repeated in London when Handel introduced the work at the Covent Garden theatre on 23 March 1743 . Avoglio and Cibber were again the chief soloists ; they were joined by the tenor John Beard , a veteran of Handel 's operas , the bass Thomas <unk> and two other sopranos , Kitty Clive and Miss Edwards . The first performance was overshadowed by views expressed in the press that the work 's subject matter was too exalted to be performed in a theatre , particularly by secular singer @-@ actresses such as Cibber and Clive . In an attempt to deflect such sensibilities , in London Handel had avoided the name Messiah and presented the work as the " New Sacred Oratorio " . As was his custom , Handel rearranged the music to suit his singers . He wrote a new setting of " And lo , the angel of the Lord " for Clive , never used subsequently . He added a tenor song for Beard : " Their sound is gone out " , which had appeared in Jennens 's original libretto but had not been in the Dublin performances . 
 The custom of standing for the " Hallelujah " chorus originates from a belief that , at the London premiere , King George II did so , which would have obliged all to stand . There is no convincing evidence that the king was present , or that he attended any subsequent performance of Messiah ; the first reference to the practice of standing appears in a letter dated 1756 , three years prior to Handel 's death . 
 London 's initially cool reception of Messiah led Handel to reduce the season 's planned six performances to three , and not to present the work at all in 1744 — to the considerable annoyance of Jennens , whose relations with the composer temporarily soured . At Jennens 's request , Handel made several changes in the music for the 1745 revival : " Their sound is gone out " became a choral piece , the soprano song " Rejoice greatly " was recomposed in shortened form , and the transpositions for Cibber 's voice were restored to their original soprano range . Jennens wrote to Holdsworth on 30 August 1745 : " [ Handel ] has made a fine Entertainment of it , though not near so good as he might & ought to have done . I have with great difficulty made him correct some of the grosser faults in the composition ... " Handel directed two performances at Covent Garden in 1745 , on 9 and 11 April , and then set the work aside for four years . 
 The 1749 revival at Covent Garden , under the proper title of Messiah , saw the appearance of two female soloists who were henceforth closely associated with Handel 's music : Giulia <unk> and Caterina Galli . In the following year these were joined by the male alto Gaetano Guadagni , for whom Handel composed new versions of " But who may abide " and " Thou art gone up on high " . The year 1750 also saw the institution of the annual charity performances of Messiah at London 's Foundling Hospital , which continued until Handel 's death and beyond . The 1754 performance at the hospital is the first for which full details of the orchestral and vocal forces survive . The orchestra included fifteen violins , five violas , three cellos , two double @-@ basses , four bassoons , four oboes , two trumpets , two horns and drums . In the chorus of nineteen were six trebles from the Chapel Royal ; the remainder , all men , were altos , tenors and basses . <unk> , Galli and Beard led the five soloists , who were required to assist the chorus . For this performance the transposed Guadagni arias were restored to the soprano voice . By 1754 Handel was severely afflicted by the onset of blindness , and in 1755 he turned over the direction of the Messiah hospital performance to his pupil , J.C. Smith . He apparently resumed his duties in 1757 and may have continued thereafter . The final performance of the work at which Handel was present was at Covent Garden on 6 April 1759 , eight days before his death .

 During the 1750s Messiah was performed increasingly at festivals and cathedrals throughout the country . Individual choruses and arias were occasionally extracted for use as anthems or motets in church services , or as concert pieces , a practice that grew in the 19th century and has continued ever since . After Handel 's death , performances were given in Florence ( 1768 ) , New York ( excerpts , 1770 ) , Hamburg ( 1772 ) , and Mannheim ( 1777 ) , where Mozart first heard it . For the performances in Handel 's lifetime and in the decades following his death , the musical forces used in the Foundling Hospital performance of 1754 are thought by Burrows to be typical . A fashion for large @-@ scale performances began in 1784 , in a series of commemorative concerts of Handel 's music given in Westminster Abbey under the patronage of King George III . A plaque on the Abbey wall records that " The Band consisting of <unk> [ 525 ] vocal & instrumental performers was conducted by Joah Bates <unk> . " In a 1955 article , Sir Malcolm Sargent , a proponent of large @-@ scale performances , wrote , " Mr Bates ... had known Handel well and respected his wishes . The orchestra employed was two hundred and fifty strong , including twelve horns , twelve trumpets , six trombones and three pairs of timpani ( some made especially large ) . " In 1787 further performances were given at the Abbey ; advertisements promised , " The Band will consist of Eight Hundred Performers " . 
 In continental Europe , performances of Messiah were departing from Handel 's practices in a different way : his score was being drastically reorchestrated to suit contemporary tastes . In 1786 , Johann Adam Hiller presented Messiah with updated scoring in Berlin Cathedral . In 1788 Hiller presented a performance of his revision with a choir of 259 and an orchestra of 87 strings , 10 bassoons , 11 oboes , 8 flutes , 8 horns , 4 clarinets , 4 trombones , 7 trumpets , timpani , harpsichord and organ . In 1789 , Mozart was commissioned by Baron Gottfried van Swieten and the Gesellschaft der <unk> to re @-@ orchestrate several works by Handel , including Messiah . Writing for a small @-@ scale performance , he eliminated the organ continuo , added parts for flutes , clarinets , trombones and horns , recomposed some passages and rearranged others . The performance took place on 6 March 1789 in the rooms of Count Johann Esterházy , with four soloists and a choir of 12 . Mozart 's arrangement , with minor amendments from Hiller , was published in 1803 , after his death . The musical scholar Moritz Hauptmann described the Mozart additions as " stucco ornaments on a marble temple " . Mozart himself was reportedly circumspect about his changes , insisting that any alterations to Handel 's score should not be interpreted as an effort to improve the music . Elements of this version later became familiar to British audiences , incorporated into editions of the score by editors including Ebenezer Prout . 
 = = = 19th century = = = 
 In the 19th century , approaches to Handel in German and English @-@ speaking countries diverged further . In Leipzig in 1856 , the musicologist Friedrich Chrysander and the literary historian Georg Gottfried Gervinus founded the Deutsche Händel @-@ Gesellschaft with the aim of publishing authentic editions of all Handel 's works . At the same time , performances in Britain and the United States moved away from Handel 's performance practice with increasingly grandiose renditions . Messiah was presented in New York in 1853 with a chorus of 300 and in Boston in 1865 with more than 600 . In Britain a " Great Handel Festival " was held at the Crystal Palace in 1857 , performing Messiah and other Handel oratorios , with a chorus of 2 @,@ 000 singers and an orchestra of 500 . 
 In the 1860s and 1870s ever larger forces were assembled . Bernard Shaw , in his role as a music critic , commented , " The stale wonderment which the great chorus never fails to elicit has already been exhausted " ; he later wrote , " Why , instead of wasting huge sums on the multitudinous dullness of a Handel Festival does not somebody set up a thoroughly rehearsed and exhaustively studied performance of the Messiah in St James 's Hall with a chorus of twenty capable artists ? Most of us would be glad to hear the work seriously performed once before we die . " The employment of huge forces necessitated considerable augmentation of the orchestral parts . Many admirers of Handel believed that the composer would have made such additions , had the appropriate instruments been available in his day . Shaw argued , largely unheeded , that " the composer may be spared from his friends , and the function of writing or selecting ' additional orchestral accompaniments ' exercised with due discretion . " 
 One reason for the popularity of huge @-@ scale performances was the ubiquity of amateur choral societies . The conductor Sir Thomas Beecham wrote that for 200 years the chorus was " the national medium of musical utterance " in Britain . However , after the heyday of Victorian choral societies , he noted a " rapid and violent reaction against monumental performances ... an appeal from several quarters that Handel should be played and heard as in the days between 1700 and 1750 " . At the end of the century , Sir Frederick Bridge and T. W. Bourne pioneered revivals of Messiah in Handel 's orchestration , and Bourne 's work was the basis for further scholarly versions in the early 20th century . 
 = = = 20th century and beyond = = = 
 Although the huge @-@ scale oratorio tradition was perpetuated by such large ensembles as the Royal Choral Society , the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the Huddersfield Choral Society in the 20th century , there were increasing calls for performances more faithful to Handel 's conception . At the turn of the century , The Musical Times wrote of the " additional accompaniments " of Mozart and others , " Is it not time that some of these ' hangers on ' of Handel 's score were sent about their business ? " In 1902 , the musicologist Ebenezer Prout produced a new edition of the score , working from Handel 's original manuscripts rather than from corrupt printed versions with errors accumulated from one edition to another . However , Prout started from the assumption that a faithful reproduction of Handel 's original score would not be practical : 
 [ T ] he attempts made from time to time by our musical societies to give Handel 's music as he meant it to be given must , however earnest the intention , and however careful the preparation , be foredoomed to failure from the very nature of the case . With our large choral societies , additional accompaniments of some kind are a necessity for an effective performance ; and the question is not so much whether , as how they are to be written . 
 Prout continued the practice of adding flutes , clarinets and trombones to Handel 's orchestration , but he restored Handel 's high trumpet parts , which Mozart had omitted ( evidently because playing them was a lost art by 1789 ) . There was little dissent from Prout 's approach , and when Chrysander 's scholarly edition was published in the same year , it was received respectfully as " a volume for the study " rather than a performing edition , being an edited reproduction of various of Handel 's manuscript versions . An authentic performance was thought impossible : The Musical Times correspondent wrote , " Handel 's orchestral instruments were all ( excepting the trumpet ) of a coarser quality than those at present in use ; his harpsichords are gone for ever ... the places in which he performed the ' Messiah ' were mere drawing @-@ rooms when compared with the Albert Hall , the Queen 's Hall and the Crystal Palace . In Australia , The Register protested at the prospect of performances by " <unk> little church choirs of 20 voices or so " . 
 In Germany , Messiah was not so often performed as in Britain ; when it was given , medium @-@ sized forces were the norm . At the Handel Festival held in 1922 in Handel 's native town , Halle , his choral works were given by a choir of 163 and an orchestra of 64 . In Britain , innovative broadcasting and recording contributed to reconsideration of Handelian performance . For example , in 1928 , Beecham conducted a recording of Messiah with modestly sized forces and controversially brisk tempi , although the orchestration remained far from authentic . In 1934 and 1935 , the BBC broadcast performances of Messiah conducted by Adrian Boult with " a faithful adherence to Handel 's clear scoring . " A performance with authentic scoring was given in Worcester Cathedral as part of the Three Choirs Festival in 1935 . In 1950 John Tobin conducted a performance of Messiah in St Paul 's Cathedral with the orchestral forces specified by the composer , a choir of 60 , a counter @-@ tenor alto soloist , and modest attempts at vocal elaboration of the printed notes , in the manner of Handel 's day . The Prout version sung with many voices remained popular with British choral societies , but at the same time increasingly frequent performances were given by small professional ensembles in suitably sized venues , using authentic scoring . Recordings on LP and CD were preponderantly of the latter type , and the large scale Messiah came to seem old @-@ fashioned . 
 The cause of authentic performance was advanced in 1965 by the publication of a new edition of the score , edited by Watkins Shaw . In the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians , David Scott writes , " the edition at first aroused suspicion on account of its attempts in several directions to break the crust of convention surrounding the work in the British Isles . " By the time of Shaw 's death in 1996 , The Times described his edition as " now in universal use " . 
 Messiah remains Handel 's best @-@ known work , with performances particularly popular during the Advent season ; writing in December 1993 , the music critic Alex Ross refers to that month 's 21 performances in New York alone as " numbing repetition " . Against the general trend towards authenticity , the work has been staged in opera houses , both in London ( 2009 ) and in Paris ( 2011 ) . The Mozart score is revived from time to time , and in Anglophone countries " singalong " performances with many hundreds of performers are popular . Although performances striving for authenticity are now usual , it is generally agreed that there can never be a definitive version of Messiah ; the surviving manuscripts contain radically different settings of many numbers , and vocal and instrumental ornamentation of the written notes is a matter of personal judgment , even for the most historically informed performers . The Handel scholar Winton Dean has written : 
 [ T ] here is still plenty for scholars to fight over , and more than ever for conductors to decide for themselves . Indeed if they are not prepared to grapple with the problems presented by the score they ought not to conduct it . This applies not only to the choice of versions , but to every aspect of baroque practice , and of course there are often no final answers .

 Alexander White ( 1738 – September 19 , 1804 ) was a distinguished early American lawyer and politician in the present @-@ day U.S. states of Virginia and West Virginia . 
 White served as an elected member of the House of Burgesses , representing Hampshire County , and as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates , representing Berkeley and Frederick counties . During the American Revolutionary War , he facilitated the release of Quaker and Hessian civilian prisoners held by patriots . In 1788 , White participated in the Virginia Ratifying Convention , in which Virginia ratified the United States Constitution . He later served as the inaugural member to represent Virginia 's 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 1789 to 1793 . White was appointed by United States President George Washington to serve as a commissioner on a board responsible for the planning and construction of Washington , D.C. ; White served on the board from 1795 to 1802 . 
 White was the son of Virginia pioneer settler and physician Dr. Robert White ( 1688 – 1752 ) ; thus , he was a member of the prominent White political family of Virginia and West Virginia . He was the uncle of Virginia judge Robert White ( 1759 – 1831 ) , the uncle of United States House Representative Francis White ( 1761 – 1826 ) , and the brother @-@ in @-@ law of Virginia Governor James Wood ( 1741 – 1813 ) .

Through his father , White was of Scottish descent and was raised in the Presbyterian faith . White 's father , Dr. Robert White , had served as a surgeon in the Royal Navy of the Kingdom of Great Britain . Dr. White relocated to present @-@ day Frederick County between 1732 and 1735 as a " pioneer settler " , where he was one of two practicing physicians . 
 White was sent by his father to Scotland to receive his education , where he studied jurisprudence at the University of Edinburgh . White continued his law studies in London , England , where he was admitted to the Inner Temple on January 15 , 1762 , and matriculated at Gray 's Inn on January 22 , 1763 .

White was an eloquent public speaker , and due to his Scottish Presbyterian background , he was strongly opposed to the colonial government 's preferential support of the Church of England in Virginia . Because of this stance , White presented a resolution before the House of Burgesses regarding the separation of church and state . According to historians Hu Maxwell and Howard Llewellyn Swisher , White is the first man in what is now the United States to present a resolution to a legislature regarding the freedom of religion . 
 During his tenure in the House of Burgesses , White served alongside James Mercer , who was also representing Hampshire County . Following his term , White was succeeded by Joseph Neville . Upon the convening of the first court of Berkeley County on May 19 , 1772 , White served as the King 's attorney for the county . White served one term in the House of Burgesses ; he was then appointed the deputy King 's attorney for the Colony of Virginia in 1773 .

 While White did not engage in military service during the American Revolutionary War , he remained active in the practice of law in Winchester throughout the war 's duration . According to tradition , White facilitated the release of Quaker and Hessian civilian prisoners held by American Revolutionary patriots in a building in the southern part of Winchester . The Quakers and Hessians were imprisoned under the suspicion of their perceived support of British forces . The prisoners asked White to assist them with their release , and they paid him 100 Virginia pounds . Following the British retreat from the Philadelphia campaign , White traveled to Philadelphia to negotiate with the " executive authority " concerning the prisoners ' release to Pennsylvania , where public sentiment demanded their return . White successfully secured their release upon the condition that they affirm that " they would henceforth live by their creed and be at peace with all men . "

White was the first person residing in West Virginia to occupy a seat in the United States Congress . During his tenure , White 's congressional district spanned from Harpers Ferry to the Ohio River . As he was previously known in the House of Burgesses , White was reportedly one of the more eloquently spoken members in the first Congress and was known for his " remarkable punctuality " . 
 White voted in favor of the Residence Act , the United States federal law that settled the question of locating the capital of the United States along the Potomac River in Maryland and Virginia . Three days after the Residence Act became law , the United States House of Representatives agreed upon the Funding Act as part of the Compromise of 1790 , to address the issue of funding domestic debt . On August 9 , 1790 , the Funding Act became law . White voted in support of the Funding Act ; however , according to Thomas Jefferson , White 's vote was the result of an argument that occurred at a dinner hosted by Jefferson , after which White and Richard Bland Lee changed their votes in favor of the Funding Act . Jefferson stated that White reluctantly supported the bill " with a revulsion of stomach almost convulsive " . The votes of both White and Lee carried the Funding Act measure , making the enactment of the Residence Act possible . 
 White was re @-@ elected to his seat in 1791 after defeating his opponents , William Darke and General James Wood .

 White had a Liberty ship named for him in 1942 during World War II . The SS Alexander White , MC hull 139 , was laid down on October 11 , 1942 and launched on December 7 , 1942 . It was scrapped in 1964 . 
 = State Route 314 ( New York – Vermont ) = 
 New York State Route 314 ( NY 314 ) and Vermont Route 314 ( VT 314 ) are a pair of like @-@ numbered state highways in New York and Vermont in the United States , that are connected by way of the Grand Isle – Plattsburgh Ferry across Lake Champlain . NY 314 extends for 4 @.@ 73 miles ( 7 @.@ 61 km ) through the Clinton County town of Plattsburgh from Interstate 87 ( I @-@ 87 ) exit 39 to the ferry landing on Cumberland Head . Its Vermont counterpart is a 5 @.@ 493 @-@ mile ( 8 @.@ 840 km ) loop route off of U.S. Route 2 ( US 2 ) through the Grand Isle County towns of South Hero and Grand Isle that connects to the ferry near its midpoint . 
 VT 314 was originally designated as Vermont Route F @-@ 3 in the late 1920s . The roadway on the New York side was unnumbered until c . 1962 , when Cumberland Head Road was designated as NY 314 . VT F @-@ 3 was redesignated as VT 314 in 1964 to match the designation present at the New York ferry approach . In 2005 , a new highway connecting US 9 to the ferry landing by way of the interior of Cumberland Head was completed and opened to traffic as the Commodore Thomas MacDonough Highway . NY 314 was realigned to follow the new highway while ownership and maintenance of its old alignment was transferred to the town of Plattsburgh . The designation of NY 314 east of US 9 was consolidated by July 2014 .

 VT 314 begins at an intersection with US 2 just north of Keeler Bay , a village in the town of South Hero . The route heads northwestward as Ferry Road , passing by a small number of homes situated amongst open fields . At the western edge of Grand Isle , VT 314 intersects West Shore Road , a local highway that runs along the western shoreline of the island . The route turns north onto West Shore Road , following the roadway along Lake Champlain and into the town of Grand Isle . Here , the route 's surroundings are mainly the same as it proceeds toward Gordon Landing . 
 In Gordon Landing , VT 314 connects to a ferry landing for the Grand Isle – Plattsburgh Ferry ( which leads to Clinton CR 57 ) by way of an unnamed extension of Bell Hill Road . VT 314 continues northward along West Shore Road to Allen Road , where the route turns to follow Allen Road eastward across the island . While on Allen Road , the route passes through an area of open fields and forests that contains only a couple dozen homes . VT 314 continues eastward to another junction with US 2 , where the route comes to an end .

 = = = Designations = = = 
 All of modern VT 314 was originally designated as VT F @-@ 3 in the late 1920s . At Gordon Landing , VT F @-@ 3 connected to Cumberland Head in New York by way of the Grand Isle – Plattsburgh Ferry across Lake Champlain . The primary highway leading from the New York ferry landing to US 9 near Plattsburgh , then Cumberland Head Road , was initially unnumbered . VT F @-@ 3 was maintained by the towns of South Hero and Grand Isle until June 20 , 1957 , when the state of Vermont assumed ownership and maintenance of the highway . 
 The portion of the Adirondack Northway ( I @-@ 87 ) between exits 36 and 39 was completed and opened to traffic c . 1961 . Moffitt Road was upgraded between the new freeway and US 9 as part of the Northway 's construction . By the following year , the upgraded piece of Moffitt Road and the piece of Cumberland Head Road between US 9 and the ferry landing was designated as NY 314 . From I @-@ 87 to US 9 , NY 314 was maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation ; the remainder of the route was maintained by Clinton County and co @-@ designated as CR 42 . VT F @-@ 3 was renumbered to VT 314 on May 1 , 1964 to match the designation now present at the New York ferry approach . 
 = = = Cumberland Head connector = = = 
 The idea of a building a new highway that would lead directly from US 9 to the ferry landing at the southern tip of Cumberland Head was first proposed in 1964 . At that time , a group of Cumberland Head residents stated that the existing narrow and winding perimeter road ( NY 314 ) jeopardized the safety of residents and motorists alike . As time went on , the problem grew worse as the amount of traffic traveling to and from the ferry increased . The proposal finally gained traction in 2002 when New York State Senator Ronald B. Stafford was able to procure most of the $ 7 @.@ 3 million required to build the highway . Construction on the new route began in March 2005 following three years of studies and planning . 
 The Cumberland Head connector began at the east end of the divided highway portion of NY 314 and would pass through the rural interior of the peninsula on its way to the ferry landing . Part of the road would utilize the preexisting Lighthouse Road . It was built as a super two highway with a 45 @-@ mile @-@ per @-@ hour ( 72 km / h ) speed limit , 10 miles per hour ( 16 km / h ) higher than that of the perimeter road . The project was initially expected to be completed around November 2006 ; however , it was completed nearly a year ahead of schedule . On December 1 , 2005 , the new highway was named the Commodore Thomas MacDonough Highway in honor of Thomas MacDonough , an American naval officer who defeated the British in the Battle of Plattsburgh during the War of 1812 . The road opened to traffic about a week later , co @-@ designated as NY 314 ( which was realigned to follow the length of the highway ) and CR 57 . Following the completion of the project , ownership and maintenance of Cumberland Head Road ( NY 314 's former routing ) was to be transferred from Clinton County to the town of Plattsburgh . The transfer was officially approved on September 13 , 2006 . 
 The new highway has only two intersections , both with Cumberland Head Road . This was by design as no access roads were built off of the route in an effort to improve safety along the highway . One part of the finished highway that drew controversy was a one @-@ way ramp built between the eastbound MacDonough Highway and the west end of Cumberland Head Road . Some residents criticized the layout , stating that it made it difficult to travel to and from MacDonough Highway and Cumberland Head Road . Ironically , the ramp was added as a result of public input ; the initial project designs did not call for a ramp . Instead , all traffic to and from Cumberland Head Road would have had to utilize the junction with MacDonough Highway 0 @.@ 25 miles ( 0 @.@ 40 km ) to the east . The designation of NY 314 east of US 9 was consolidated by July 2014 .

 " G.U.Y. " ( an acronym for " girl under you " ) is a song by American singer Lady Gaga from her third studio album , Artpop ( 2013 ) . The song was written and produced by Gaga and Zedd . It debuted on Italian radio as the album 's third single on March 28 , 2014 . It was developed while Gaga was touring with Born This Way Ball , and was recorded a number of times for the final version . " G.U.Y. " is an EDM track containing elements of industrial , contemporary R & B , and house music whose lyrics address a number of subjects like sexual dominance , submission , and gender roles . 
 " G.U.Y. " received mixed reviews from music critics , who complimented the composition of the track and Gaga 's vocals , but criticized its lyrics and production . The song debuted on the record charts of a few countries , but failed to enter the top ten in most of them . In the United States , " G.U.Y. " became Gaga 's second lowest charting single on the Billboard Hot 100 , peaking at number 76 . It reached the top ten on airplay charts of Bulgaria and Croatia , the Billboard Greek Digital Songs chart , and the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart . 
 The music video for the song was shot at Hearst Castle , located near San Simeon . The video featured reality TV show actors like The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills , and works of artist Nathan Sawaya and YouTube 's Minecraft gamer <unk> . Running for over 11 minutes , the video shows Gaga as a wounded fallen angel who is revived by her followers in a pool . Once rejuvenated , she takes revenge on the men who hunted her and replaces them with clones known as G.U.Y. The video received positive reviews for its visuals and its references to Greek mythology . Gaga has performed " G.U.Y. " on her seven day residency shows at Roseland Ballroom in March 2014 and at ArtRave : The Artpop Ball ; in both places she emulated the choreography from the music video on stage , and received positive critical response . 
 = = Background and development = = 
 Development of Gaga 's third studio album , Artpop , began shortly after the release of her second one , Born This Way ( 2011 ) , and by the following year , the record was already being recorded . " G.U.Y. " was confirmed in an interview with Stylist magazine where Joanna McGarry asked Gaga about her views on feminism . Gaga told McGarry that the song is about new @-@ age feminism which she wanted to explore , where being subordinate to a man is the transfer of strength . 
 I actually wrote a song about it on my album , it 's called ' <unk> ' and it stands for ' Go Under You ' . So wearing make @-@ up , smelling delicious and having <unk> , <unk> , edible things between your limbs is something I find strengthening because I know that when I pick the right guy , I can let him have it . Some women feel oppressed by make @-@ up and clothing , and here ’ s to them , they have every right to feel that way as well . 
 On her social media website <unk> , Gaga later corrected the song title , saying that it is actually " G.U.Y. " , an acronym for " Girl Under You " . She also revealed that the song was written and produced with musician Zedd , who had been touring with Gaga for her Born This Way Ball . Zedd had previously done a remix of her single " Marry the Night " for her remix album , Born This Way : The Remix , and Gaga had contributed vocals on an alternate version of Zedd 's track , " <unk> " . The musician told MTV News that they " both love nothing more than making music , so it was just kind of natural for us to just work on music " . He also confirmed that around ten songs were composed with Gaga and was almost finished , although he was not sure which would be available on the final track list for Artpop . 
 By January 2013 , Zedd clarified that due to their busy schedules it was difficult to complete the project and work progressed mainly during the tour . Talking to Sirius XM Radio in December 2013 , where she gave an in @-@ depth analysis of each song from the album , Gaga further expanded on the concept of new @-@ wave feminism : " The record 's all about being comfortable underneath , because you are strong enough to know that you don 't have to be on top to know you 're worth it , " she concluded . 
 = = Recording and composition = = 
 Initial recording sessions for Artpop coincided with the Born This Way Ball . Zedd was not happy with the initial outcome of the recordings and so he suggested Gaga to re @-@ do the whole process . Gaga 's idea of recording the songs with Zedd was to not limit themselves with the intention of creating a staple radio hit , instead be creative in whichever way they wanted . He explained to Rolling Stone that they did not " try to make an EDM album — but , at the same time , we didn 't try not to make an EDM album . I 've done a lot of stuff that 's really outside of what I usually do . There was one song that started from her just giving me , like , 10 words to describe an emotion , and then I had to make this into music . It 's been a very experimental way of approaching music . " 
 The song was recorded at Record Plant Studios , Hollywood , California , by Dave Russell with assistance from Benjamin Ladder . Zedd did the mixing of the track at <unk> . The instructional voice at the beginning of the song was done by Sonja Durham . Assisting with the whole process was Ryan Shanahan and Jesse Taub . Finally , Rick Pearl did the additional programming and Gene Grimaldi did the audio mastering at Oasis Mastering Studios in Burbank , California . 
 According to Musicnotes.com , " G.U.Y. " is set in the time signature of common time , with a dance @-@ pop tempo of 110 beats per minute . It is composed in the key of C minor with Gaga 's vocals spanning the tonal nodes of D3 to C5 . " G.U.Y. " is an EDM song with industrial , R & B , and house elements . Jason Lipshutz of Billboard described the track as a " shuddering dance siren that makes the distinction between gender equality and willful sexual submission " . Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone called the song a " gothy grinder " . 
 Its composition is reminiscent of the songs on Gaga 's first album , The Fame ( 2008 ) , with MTV News ' John Walker noticing a number of topics being addressed by the lyrics , including sexual preferences , dominance and submission and gender roles . There is also glimpse of baroque music in the composition which Ed Power of Hot Press described as landing " its blows with agreeable fervor " . The song opens with Gaga playing the role of a hostess , which Maura Johnson of Spin found similar to the 1993 erotic album , <unk> .

 Following its release , " G.U.Y. " received mixed reviews from music critics . Positive comment came from Lipshutz , who commended Zedd 's production of the song , noticing that it complimented Gaga 's vocals and the hook was relatable , making " G.U.Y. " the first standout track from Artpop . Robert Copsey from Digital Spy praised the song 's " grinding bass and darting synths " and " hypnotic chorus " . Andy Gill of The Independent felt that Gaga 's " robotic " vocal delivery in the song made the theme of sexual attraction " seem grimly denatured " . Walker praised the track 's lyrical content and gave " <unk> " four out of five rating , but was less pleased with the background music . Owen Myers of Dazed & Confused complimented the entendres present in the song , saying that " this pop wonder " would have worked better as the lead single from Artpop . Harper 's Bazaar magazine 's Justin Miller shared this opinion , and believed that both the dance music composition and the lyrics catered most to the Venus inspiration behind the album . 
 Johnson described the song as " a seriously banging pop EP " , and a welcome departure from the first two tracks of the album , " Aura " and " Venus " . She described the song to be " an ode to taking on the submissive role in a relationship " . Stacy @-@ Ann Ellis from Vibe deemed the song " almost clever " . Brian Tank from The Buffalo News called the track a " catchy and fun " song which made one " feel happy and dance along " . Writing for Fact , William Bennett described the song as incredible . Mikael Wood from Los Angeles Times felt that " G.U.Y. " helped the Artpop album have a " fresh " sound . Annie <unk> of The A.V. Club praised it as one of the album 's highlights . The song was called an " instant hit " by Mike Driver from Clash who found the usage of handclaps and the chorus as addictive . Clare Considine from Time Out found the song to be inspired by the work of Madonna and David Bowie , in its " cosmic pansexual playfulness " . Brad Wheeler from The Globe and Mail noted the erotic elements associated with the track , jokingly adding that " one imagines Gaga 's choreographer is busy at work on the song 's live erotica possibilities as we speak . " 
 Negative reviews came from Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , who criticized the song , saying that it did not portray Gaga as an artist moving forward with her music , and did not contribute anything musically to distinguish itself from other sexual songs . Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast opined that " G.U.Y. " is a " complicated " track where the production is so chaotic that it drowned the commendable hook of the song , making it sound like a " whirring bee 's nest " . Melinda Newman from Hitfix gave the song a " C " rating and criticized its production as " clunky " . Preston Jones from Fort Worth Star @-@ Telegram called the song " blunt " , and believed that it showed Gaga " has been , all along , more or less creatively bankrupt " . Allan Moses Rodricks from The Hindu felt that too much experimenting with the music led to a low quality production on the song . Allison Stewart from The Washington Post criticized the song 's lyrics for including " role playing , bad puns , a killer hook " . Stewart also characterized it as " highly sexualized , which is different from saying it 's sexy , because Gaga 's air of sexual detachment rivals Rihanna 's . " Chris Bosman from Time found the song 's sexual themes to be " very similar " and redundant to those from " Venus " . Lydia Jenkin from The New Zealand Herald was unsure whether the lyrics were interesting or " just confused " .

 A 12 @-@ second preview of " G.U.Y. " was posted online by Gaga in October 2013 as preview of songs from Artpop . The part in the snippet was from the , " Love me , love me , please retweet .

This led to speculation in the media that " Gypsy " would be released as the third single from Artpop . Gaga also announced plans of shooting a new music video , which tied in with the single rumors . In March 2014 , NBC announced that the next Artpop single would be " G.U.Y.

 In February 2014 , it was announced that Gaga had been allowed to shoot for a musical project at Hearst Castle , located near San Simeon , California . The shooting took place from February 11 – 13 , at locations including the 84 @,@ 000 square feet area of the Castle 's main terrace , the Neptune Pool and the indoor Roman Pool . The cast from Bravo channel 's reality show The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills ( RHOBH ) was also seen around the shoot . The news attracted media attention as it was the first time since 1960 that a video project was shot there , the last being for Stanley Kubrick 's epic film Spartacus ; the Deed of gift mandate by the Hearst Corporation prohibited any commercial filming at the location . 
 Among the accessories shown , the wings worn in the video were made by Jim Henson Studios and her own creative team , Haus of Gaga , created the arrows . Gaga told Access Hollywood about the shoot at Hearst Castle and the main idea behind the video : " It was a great experience writing the treatment working with everyone and I was like , ' Don 't touch anything , and if you knock over a sculpture I 'm going to pass out ! ' . The intention of the video was to create something that was a true sort of road map of my journey , being an artist , a pop singer , a creative person ..... It 's interesting because in this video the fashion and the psychotic sort of whimsy is all happening around me and it 's me almost like Alice in Wonderland going through my own rabbit hole in my brain and re @-@ experiencing the past year of my life . Every moment that we were filming together was really joyous and really fun . " 
 The cast from RHOBH featured included Lisa Vanderpump , Yolanda Foster , Carlton <unk> , Kyle Richards , and Kim Richards , who acted as instrument players in the video . Kyle Richards and Vanderpump also accompany Gaga on a different sequence in the video , showing the trio taking revenge against a corporation . Vanderpump explained that they were contacted by Andy Cohen — who himself has a cameo appearance in " G.U.Y. " — from Bravo and were signed for side @-@ roles in the video . Richards noticed that Gaga was a perfectionist on the set , with Vanderpump saying that the singer took charge of every detail of the production . They explained to The Hollywood Reporter that Gaga wanted the housewives to " feel and look beautiful and fierce " and during one of the homicide scenes she explained : " I want you to whip that ponytail even more . Go back and really exaggerate your head @-@ flipping ' . I was like , ' Whatever you say ' . [ Vanderpump ] To get me into a lace bodysuit , there 's not many people I 'd do that for . I 'm 53 years old , for God 's sake . She said , ' This is what you 're wearing ' . " Richards personally wanted to play the guitar since she had been taking lessons . 
 Gaga also utilized the 3D game Minecraft in a sequence and enlisted Minecraft <unk> <unk> in a sequence which <unk> the singer reviving famous men who have been dead . The artist had been a fan of the game since Martyn Littlewood of The Yogscast used it to create a parody of her 2011 single , " Born This Way " , which she appreciated . Minecraft and Lego were also used to create little items like fruits and chairs in the video . The 3D theme also expanded onto using artist Nathan Sawaya 's Lego sculpture Yellow — which showed a man ripping his chest out — in a sequence showing Gaga 's head being transposed on the <unk> . Sawaya recalled that Gaga had contacted him for collaborating on the music video . They mutually agreed on the idea of making art " accessible " and decided on the different sculptures to be created , including a duplicate of Yellow , without the head . Sawaya then traveled to Hearst Castle to install the art pieces for the shoot . Multiple designer dresses were also used in the video namely , a white ensemble with a giant headpiece by Jean Paul Gaultier , jeans by Versace , a red swimsuit by La Perla and a black one by Madrid label POL , jewelry from Lynn Ban , and custom made sandals form Ruthie Davis . The homicide scenes showed designs by Helen <unk> , lace bodysuits by <unk> and <unk> Rios feathered headpiece . Designer Bea <unk> created a dress from paper resembling a teddy bear as well as other couture also . Finally , gold colored latex body suit created by Atsuko Kudo was also work by Gaga , as well as gold garments for her backup dancers .

 On March 14 , 2014 , Gaga revealed during her keynote speech with John Norris at SXSW that she would release the video a week later . She also tweeted a still from the clip with a caption about the release date . A preview of the clip aired on March 21 , during an interview with Savannah Guthrie for Today . The video debuted in full on Dateline NBC a day later . To coincide with the release of the video , The Out NYC hotel changed their name temporarily to The G.U.Y. Hotel and would keep it till April 10 , 2014 . Located in Midtown New York , the hotel also opened a Gaga Gallery which started from March 28 ( Gaga 's birthday ) and show cased the props and dresses included in the music video . 
 Running for nearly twelve minutes , the video features four songs from Artpop and features the central video for " G.U.Y. " The video opens with corporate business men fighting each other over money . Nearby , Gaga depicted as a fallen angel has been shot out of the sky with an arrow . The instrumental of her song " Artpop " plays in the background . The men run off and Gaga crawls to safety , removing the arrow from her chest . Gaga makes it to her feet and travels to a palace , where she collapses at the front door and is scraped up by the guards . " Venus " begins as she is carried down to the pool , where people cover her in flowers and put her into the water in order to heal her . 
 " G.U.Y. " begins as Gaga rises again in a white dress , reborn as a Greek goddess of sorts and the song begins to play . Shots of Gaga in different outfits , including a blue dress and white bikini are shown with dance sequences . Andy Cohen and the stars of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills make cameos in the video . A scene featuring Gaga rolling around on a seashell bed in a red outfit , dancing in a gold leotard with arrows , and floating on a bed in a pool are shown throughout the song . With the help of <unk> <unk> ( also making his cameo appearance ) , Michael Jackson , Mahatma Gandhi , John Lennon , and Jesus are resurrected using the game Minecraft and their blood is used to create clones known as " G.U.Y. " Gaga , Vanderpump , and Richards are seen coming out of a car in black outfits , shooting money cannons , and walking down the hallway to kill corporate executives to replace with G.U.Y. clones . The video ends with thousands of these clones marching out of the castle . The credits section of the video then features " Manicure " playing . 
 = = = Reception and analysis = = = 
 Christina Lee from Idolator called it " extravagant " and found similarity to the release of Jackson 's music video for " Remember the Time " , with Gaga building up anticipation for " G.U.Y. " with teasers and premiere . Marissa G. Muller from MTV News commended the fashion , the choreography , the appearance of RHOBH in the video , and all who worked in it in the credits , saying " While it 's a humbling move to put the spotlight on everyone else 's contributions , it 's also a reminder of how truly epic this production is . It 's gonna be really hard for Gaga to out @-@ Gaga this one . " Adam Markovitz from Entertainment Weekly was impressed by the grandiose of the video calling it " camp @-@ pop delirium " . He compared it with director Jean Cocteau 's films and proposed different theories as to the plot of the video , including ode to old and new Hollywood and a satire of " corporate subservience " . This view was shared by Whitney Phaneuf from HitFix who called it a " heavy dose of camp and pop culture " . 
 MuuMuse 's Bradley Stern described the video as " an eye @-@ popping 7 @-@ minute deep dive into astonishing new levels of self @-@ importance and certifiable insanity . " The video was also noted as Gaga 's most ambitious project since those for her previous singles " Bad Romance " and " Telephone " . Kevin Rutherford from Billboard said that Gaga " has no problem attaching art to music " and that " she 's not showing signs of stopping anytime soon with her new music video . " Isaiah Thomas from El Espectador noted that the video was a response by Gaga against accusations of " selling out " to the corporate world . Especially the ending of the video justified this with Gaga murdering the corporate heads who supposedly destroyed her freedom in the beginning of the video . Dharmic X from Complex described the release as " vibrant " and " leftfield " , as is expected from a release by Gaga . Samantha Grossman from Time expected the video to be full of the strange imagery and the extravagant costumes , making it " bizarre " . 
 Negative reviews came from Slant Magazine 's Sal Cinquemani , who found the plot to be " muffled " , ultimately deducing that the final output was " unsexy " for a song talking about sexual submissiveness . Cinquemani found inspirations from the 1952 musical film Million Dollar Mermaid , in the scenes involving synchronized swimming . Contactmusic.com 's Elinor Cosgrave highlighted the video 's " mix of symbolism " , though criticized the references to Christ and rebirth .

 " G.U.Y. " was included in the setlist of her Manhattan residency show at Roseland Ballroom . Following the performance of " Applause " , Gaga appeared in a white jumpsuit and green colored wig which she had introduced during the Artpop era . She stood in the middle of the Ballroom stage and sang the opening lyrics while purple neon lights flooded the stage . On April 2 , her performance of the song was broadcast on Late Show with David Letterman along with her song " Dope " . Amanda <unk> from The Guardian recalled that the performance of " G.U.Y. " received " as much love as [ Gaga 's ] first big hit ' Just Dance ' " . April Spanos from The Village Voice rendered the performances of " Applause " and " G.U.Y. " as the " power duo " of the night . She added that the latter was " particularly pleasant to hear live ; the Zedd beat was made to be experienced in a club and its crunch was felt all over the dancefloor . " Conversely , Hilary Hughes from USA Today felt that the simplest moments of the performances were the ones featuring toned down versions of her singles like " Born This Way " and " Poker Face " , rather than the " extravagant " choreography during " Bad Romance " and " G.U.Y. " On the final day of the Roseland shows , Gaga took a bow with her dancers after the performance , saying " Roseland , thank you for all the wonderful memories you 've given us ... Thank you for giving us this historic opportunity . " 
 The song was also included in the set list of her ArtRave : The Artpop Ball tour , being the second track performed . The singer wore a bejeweled leotard which had the Jeff Koons blue gazing ball attached in the middle ; the ball was previously used in the album cover art for Artpop . Gaga accessorized the dress with a pair of feathered wings while wearing a blond bob wig reminiscent of her looks from The Fame era . Following the performance of the album title song , " Artpop " , Gaga loosened the wings and was joined by her dancers on the ramp to perform " G.U.Y. " During the intermediate verses Gaga performed a choreographed routine reminiscent of the music video with a dancer . The performance ended with the singer and the dancers reaching the main stage and dancing energetically . It received positive review from Ross Raihala of St. Paul Pioneer Press who said that the song sounded " terrific " in its live rendition . Chuck Yarborough from The Plain Dealer noticed that Gaga sang with a backing track during the performance of " G.U.Y. " , but concluded that " she and a gifted crew of dancers kept up a manic pace that matched the frenzy of the evening " .

 = Artaxerxes III = 
 Artaxerxes III Ochus of Persia / <unk> / c . 425 BC – 338 BC ; ( Old Persian : <unk> ) was the Great King ( Shah ) of Persia and the eleventh king of the Achaemenid Empire , as well as the first Pharaoh of the 31st dynasty of Egypt . He was the son and successor of Artaxerxes II and was succeeded by his son , <unk> of Persia ( also known as Artaxerxes IV ) . His reign coincided with the reign of Philip II in Macedon and Nectanebo II in Egypt . 
 Before ascending the throne Artaxerxes was a satrap and commander of his father 's army . Artaxerxes came to power after one of his brothers was executed , another committed suicide , the last murdered and his father , Artaxerxes II died . Soon after becoming king , Artaxerxes murdered all of the royal family to secure his place as king . He started two major campaigns against Egypt . The first campaign failed , and was followed up by rebellions throughout the western part of his empire . In 343 BC , Artaxerxes defeated Nectanebo II , the Pharaoh of Egypt , driving him from Egypt , stopping a revolt in Phoenicia on the way . 
 In Artaxerxes ' later years , Philip II of Macedon 's power was increasing in Greece , where he tried to convince the Greeks to revolt against Achaemenid Persia . His activities were opposed by Artaxerxes , and with his support , the city of Perinthus resisted a Macedonian siege . 
 There is evidence for a renewed building policy at Persepolis in his later life , where Artaxerxes erected a new palace and built his own tomb , and began long @-@ term projects such as the Unfinished Gate . 
 According to a Greek source , Diodorus of Sicily , Bagoas poisoned Artaxerxes , but a cuneiform tablet ( now in the British Museum ) suggests that the king died from natural causes . 
 = = Name = = 
 Artaxerxes III ( Old Persian : , <unk> , " he whose empire is well @-@ fitted " or " perfected " , or Arta : " honoured " + Xerxes : " a king " ( " the honoured king " ) , according to Herodotus " the great warrior " ) was the throne name adopted by Ochus when he succeeded his father in 358 BC . He is generally referred to as Ochus , but in Iran he is known as Ardeshir III ( <unk> <unk> Modern Persian form of Artaxerxes ) . In Babylonian inscriptions he is called " <unk> , who is called <unk> " . The same form of the name ( probably pronounced <unk> ) occurs in the Syrian version of the Canon of Kings by Elias of Nisibis . 
 = = Early life and accession = = 
 Before ascending the throne Artaxerxes had been a satrap and commander of his father 's army . In 359 BC , just before ascending the throne , he attacked Egypt as a reaction to Egypt 's failed attacks on coastal regions of Phoenicia . In 358 BC his father , Artaxerxes II , died , it was said because of a broken heart caused by his children 's behaviour , and , since his other sons , Darius , <unk> and Tiribazus had already been eliminated by plots , Artaxerxes III succeeded him as king . His first order was the execution of over 80 of his nearest relations to secure his place as king . 
 In 355 BC , Artaxerxes forced Athens to conclude a peace which required the city 's forces to leave Asia Minor and to acknowledge the independence of its rebellious allies . Artaxerxes started a campaign against the rebellious <unk> , but he managed to appease both of the <unk> kings . One individual who successfully emerged from this campaign was Darius <unk> , who later occupied the Persian throne as Darius III . 
 Artaxerxes then ordered the disbanding of all the satrapal armies of Asia Minor , as he felt that they could no longer guarantee peace in the west and was concerned that these armies equipped the western satraps with the means to revolt . The order was however ignored by Artabazus of Lydia , who asked for the help of Athens in a rebellion against the king . Athens sent assistance to Sardis . Orontes of Mysia also supported Artabazus and the combined forces managed to defeat the forces sent by Artaxerxes in 354 BC . However , in 353 BC , they were defeated by Artaxerxes ’ army and were disbanded . Orontes was pardoned by the king , while Artabazus fled to the safety of the court of Philip II of Macedon . 
 = = First Egyptian Campaign = = 
 In around 351 BC , Artaxerxes embarked on a campaign to recover Egypt , which had revolted under his father , Artaxerxes II . At the same time a rebellion had broken out in Asia Minor , which , being supported by Thebes , threatened to become serious . <unk> a vast army , Artaxerxes marched into Egypt , and engaged Nectanebo II . After a year of fighting the Egyptian Pharaoh , Nectanebo inflicted a crushing defeat on the Persians with the support of mercenaries led by the Greek generals Diophantus and <unk> . Artaxerxes was compelled to retreat and postpone his plans to reconquer Egypt . 
 = = Rebellion of Cyprus and Sidon = = 
 Soon after this defeat , Phoenicia , Asia Minor and Cyprus declared their independence from Persian rule . In 343 BC , Artaxerxes committed responsibility for the suppression of the Cyprian rebels to <unk> , prince of Caria , who employed 8 @,@ 000 Greek mercenaries and forty triremes , commanded by Phocion the Athenian , and Evagoras , son of the elder Evagoras , the Cypriot monarch . <unk> succeeded in reducing Cyprus . Artaxerxes initiated a counter @-@ offensive against Sidon by commanding the satrap of Syria and <unk> , and the satrap of Cilicia to invade the city and to keep the Phoenicians in check . Both satraps suffered crushing defeats at the hands of Tennes , the <unk> king , who was aided by 40 @,@ 000 Greek mercenaries sent to him by Nectanebo II and commanded by Mentor of Rhodes . As a result , the Persian forces were driven out of Phoenicia . 
 After this , Artaxerxes personally led an army of 330 @,@ 000 men against Sidon . Artaxerxes ' army comprised 300 @,@ 000 foot soldiers , 30 @,@ 000 cavalry , 300 triremes , and 500 transports or provision ships . After gathering this army , he sought assistance from the Greeks . Though refused aid by Athens and Sparta , he succeeded in obtaining a thousand Theban heavy @-@ armed hoplites under <unk> , three thousand Argives under Nicostratus , and six thousand <unk> , Ionians , and Dorians from the Greek cities of Asia Minor . This Greek support was numerically small , amounting to no more than 10 @,@ 000 men , but it formed , together with the Greek mercenaries from Egypt who went over to him afterwards , the force on which he placed his chief reliance , and to which the ultimate success of his expedition was mainly due . 
 The approach of Artaxerxes sufficiently weakened the resolution of Tennes that he endeavoured to purchase his own pardon by delivering up 100 principal citizens of Sidon into the hands of the Persian king , and then admitting Artaxerxes within the defences of the town . Artaxerxes had the 100 citizens to be transfixed with javelins , and when 500 more came out as supplicants to seek his mercy , Artaxerxes consigned them to the same fate . Sidon was then burnt to the ground , either by Artaxerxes or by the Sidonian citizens . Forty thousand people died in the conflagration . Artaxerxes sold the ruins at a high price to speculators , who calculated on reimbursing themselves by the treasures which they hoped to dig out from among the ashes . Tennes was later put to death by Artaxerxes . Artaxerxes later sent Jews who supported the revolt to Hyrcania the south coast of the Caspian Sea . 
 = = Second Egyptian Campaign = = 
 The reduction of Sidon was followed closely by the invasion of Egypt . In 343 BC , Artaxerxes , in addition to his 330 @,@ 000 Persians , had now a force of 14 @,@ 000 Greeks furnished by the Greek cities of Asia Minor : 4 @,@ 000 under Mentor , consisting of the troops which he had brought to the aid of Tennes from Egypt ; 3 @,@ 000 sent by Argos ; and 1000 from Thebes . He divided these troops into three bodies , and placed at the head of each a Persian and a Greek . The Greek commanders were <unk> of Thebes , Mentor of Rhodes and Nicostratus of Argos while the Persians were led by <unk> , <unk> , and Bagoas , the chief of the eunuchs . Nectanebo II resisted with an army of 100 @,@ 000 of whom 20 @,@ 000 were Greek mercenaries . Nectanebo II occupied the Nile and its various branches with his large navy . The character of the country , intersected by numerous canals , and full of strongly fortified towns , was in his favour and Nectanebo II might have been expected to offer a prolonged , if not even a successful , resistance . But he lacked good generals , and over @-@ confident in his own powers of command , he was able to be out @-@ manoeuvred by the Greek mercenary generals and his forces eventually defeated by the combined Persian armies . 
 After his defeat , Nectanebo hastily fled to Memphis , leaving the fortified towns to be defended by their garrisons . These garrisons consisted of partly Greek and partly Egyptian troops ; between whom jealousies and suspicions were easily sown by the Persian leaders . As a result , the Persians were able to rapidly reduce numerous towns across Lower Egypt and were advancing upon Memphis when Nectanebo decided to quit the country and flee southwards to Ethiopia . The Persian army completely routed the Egyptians and occupied the Lower Delta of the Nile . Following Nectanebo fleeing to Ethiopia , all of Egypt submitted to Artaxerxes . The Jews in Egypt were sent either to Babylon or to the south coast of the Caspian Sea , the same location that the Jews of Phoenicia had earlier been sent . 
 After this victory over the Egyptians , Artaxerxes had the city walls destroyed , started a reign of terror , and set about looting all the temples . Persia gained a significant amount of wealth from this looting . Artaxerxes also raised high taxes and attempted to weaken Egypt enough that it could never revolt against Persia . For the 10 years that Persia controlled Egypt , believers in the native religion were persecuted and sacred books were stolen . Before he returned to Persia , he appointed <unk> as satrap of Egypt . With the wealth gained from his reconquering Egypt , Artaxerxes was able to amply reward his mercenaries . He then returned to his capital having successfully completed his invasion of Egypt . 
 = = Later years = = 
 After his success in Egypt , Artaxerxes returned to Persia and spent the next few years effectively quelling insurrections in various parts of the Empire so that a few years after his conquest of Egypt , the Persian Empire was firmly under his control . Egypt remained a part of the Persian Empire until Alexander the Great 's conquest of Egypt . 
 After the conquest of Egypt , there were no more revolts or rebellions against Artaxerxes . Mentor and Bagoas , the two generals who had most distinguished themselves in the Egyptian campaign , were advanced to posts of the highest importance . Mentor , who was governor of the entire Asiatic seaboard , was successful in reducing to subjection many of the chiefs who during the recent troubles had rebelled against Persian rule . In the course of a few years Mentor and his forces were able to bring the whole Asian Mediterranean coast into complete submission and dependence . 
 Bagoas went back to the Persian capital with Artaxerxes , where he took a leading role in the internal administration of the Empire and maintained tranquillity throughout the rest of the Empire . During the last six years of the reign of Artaxerxes III , the Persian Empire was governed by a vigorous and successful government . 
 The Persian forces in Ionia and Lycia regained control of the Aegean and the Mediterranean Sea and took over much of Athens ’ former island empire . In response , Isocrates of Athens started giving speeches calling for a ‘ crusade against the barbarians ’ but there was not enough strength left in any of the Greek city @-@ states to answer his call . 
 Although there weren 't any rebellions in the Persian Empire itself , the growing power and territory of Philip II of Macedon in Macedon ( against which Demosthenes was in vain warning the Athenians ) attracted the attention of Artaxerxes . In response , he ordered that Persian influence was to be used to check and constrain the rising power and influence of the Macedonian kingdom . In 340 BC , a Persian force was dispatched to assist the Thracian prince , <unk> , to maintain his independence . Sufficient effective aid was given to the city of Perinthus that the numerous and well @-@ appointed army with which Philip had commenced his siege of the city was compelled to give up the attempt . By the last year of Artaxerxes ' rule , Philip II already had plans in place for an invasion of the Persian Empire , which would crown his career . But the Greeks would not unite with him . 
 In 338 BC Artaxerxes was poisoned by Bagoas with the assistance of a physician . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Historically , kings of the Achaemenid Empire were followers of Zoroaster or heavily influenced by Zoroastrian ideology . The reign of Artaxerxes II saw a revival of the cult of Anahita and Mithra , when in his building inscriptions he invoked Ahuramazda , Anahita and Mithra and even set up statues of his gods . Mithra and Anahita had until then been neglected by true Zoroastrians ; because they defied Zoroaster ’ s command that God was to be represented only by the flames of a sacred fire . Artaxerxes III is thought to have rejected Anahita and worshipped only Ahuramazda and Mithra . An ambiguity in the cuneiform script of an inscription of Artaxerxes III at Persepolis suggests that he regarded the father and the son as one person , suggesting that the attributes of Ahuramazda were being transferred to Mithra . Strangely , Artaxerxes had ordered that statues of the goddess <unk> be erected at Babylon , Damascus and Sardis , as well as at Susa , Ecbatana and Persepolis . 
 Artaxerxes name appears on silver coins ( modeled on Athenian ones ) issued while he was in Egypt . The reverse bears an inscription in an Egyptian script , saying " Artaxerxes Pharaoh . Life , Prosperity , Wealth " . 
 = = = In literature = = = 
 It is thought by some that the Book of Judith could have been originally based on Artaxerxes ' campaign in Phoenicia , as Holofernes was the name of the brother of the Cappadocian satrap <unk> , the vassal of Artaxerxes . Bagoas , the general that finds Holofernes dead , was one of the generals of Artaxerxes during his campaign against Phoenicia and Egypt . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 There is evidence for a renewed building policy at Persepolis , but some of the buildings were unfinished at the time of his death . Two of his buildings at Persepolis were the Hall of Thirty @-@ Two Columns , purpose of which is unknown , and the palace of Artaxerxes III . The unfinished Army Road and Unfinished Gate , which connected the Gate of All Nations and the One @-@ hundred Column Hall , gave archaeologists an insight into the construction of Persepolis . In 341 BC , after Artaxerxes returned to Babylon from Egypt , he apparently proceeded to build a great Apadana whose description is present in the works of Diodorus Siculus . 
 The Nebuchadnezzar II palace in Babylon was expanded during the reign of Artaxerxes III . Artaxerxes ' tomb was cut into the mountain behind the Persepolis platform , next to his father 's tomb . 
 = = Family = = 
 Artaxerxes III was the son of Artaxerxes II and <unk> . Artaxerxes II had more than 115 sons by many wives , most of them however were illegitimate .

Artaxerxes married his niece and the daughter of <unk> , brother of the future king Darius III . His children were <unk> , the future king of Persia , <unk> and <unk> , wife of Alexander the Great .

 " Video Phone " was written by Beyoncé Knowles , Shondrae Crawford , Sean Garrett and Lady Gaga in the remixed version . It was produced by Bangladesh , The Pen and Knowles . Initially , " Video Phone " was sent to US urban contemporary radios on September 22 , 2009 . The release was later recalled and in October 2009 , Life & Style reported that Knowles and pop singer Lady Gaga were collaborating for a remixed version of the song . The remixed version featured both Knowles and Lady Gaga trading verses with one another . The remixed version of the song that features Lady Gaga was included on the 2009 deluxe edition of I Am ... Sasha Fierce . 
 Musically , " Video Phone " is a crunk song . According to the sheet music published at Sheetmusicplus.com by Hal Leonard Corporation , the song is set in the time signature of common time , with a moderate groove tempo of 120 beats per minute and in the key of A minor . It consists of simple lyrics , with hidden innuendos , and is backed by thin @-@ spread beats ; Knowles and Gaga uttering gasps and groans while singing the song . Chris Willman from Yahoo ! said that the lyrics are a reference to " celebration of Skype sex and putting on a solo show , on camera , for a guy you just met at the club . " 
 The female protagonist sings how she will dance for a man , while he is filming her with his videophone , this being illustrated in the line , " Press ' record ' and I 'll let you film me " , and " You want me naked ? If you like this position you can tape it " . According to James Reed of The Boston Globe the lines " What ? You want me naked / If you likin ' this position , you can tape it " are sung with an accent which was " part Long Island , part Barbados " . Michaelangelo Matos of The A.V. Club commented that " Video Phone " is very similar to Missy Elliott 's songs . Rolling Stone 's Christian Hoard and The Washington Post 's J. Freedom du Lac found similarities between " Video Phone " and the songs by rock band Nine Inch Nails . San Francisco Chronicle 's Aidin Vaziri noted that the song sounded like it was swiped from Björk .

 The song received mixed reviews . Alexis Petridis from The Guardian compared the song to " Diva " , stating that " Video Phone " is " Almost equally weird , but much better , [ and it ] introduces us to the unlikely figure of Beyoncé Knowles , amateur pornographer : ' You want me naked ? If you like this position you can tape it . ' She doesn 't make for the world 's most believable Reader 's Wife , but it doesn 't matter , because the spare , eerie backdrop of groans and echoing electronics is so thrilling . " A writer of Rolling Stone said that Knowles sings in a " dirty groove on the slippery " song . Colin <unk> from PopMatters wrote that " ' Video Phone ' is sexy enough to the point where it almost becomes uncomfortable to think of her listening back to this with her father in the room . " Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that the song ended the album abruptly . Daniel Brockman of The Phoenix noted that the song was " smutty " for an artist like Knowles . J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post chose the song as a highlight on I Am ... Sasha Fierce saying , " The moaning , groaning ' Video Phone ' positions Beyoncé as the star of a sex tape set to a thrillingly spare soundtrack that sounds like a Nine Inch Nails instrumental . " A negative review for the song was given by Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald who described it as " awful " . 
 For the collaboration , Fraser McAlpine from BBC Radio 1 reviewed the song negatively , writing : " So anyway , this brings me to ' Video Phone ' – and what exactly is the point of Gaga featuring in this song ? I know Beyoncé fans won 't like me saying this , but I can 't help but think that in this instance it 's a case of ' if you can 't beat em , join em ' [ ... ] For someone as naturally brilliant as Beyoncé ( and a better singer than Gaga and Rihanna put together ) , perhaps she should actually stop trying so hard and do what she does best - singing proper songs . " Chris Willman from Yahoo ! compared the song to Gaga 's " Telephone " , where Knowles appears as a featured artist , and wrote that " Maybe it 's because the lack of a video for Gaga 's " Telephone " leaves more to the imagination , but if this were a contest , I 'd have to say her tune trumps Beyoncé 's . [ ... ] [ Her ] greatest promises of unbridled exhibitionism can 't quite make the genre feel fresh . " The New York Times ' Jon Caramanica commented that " Video Phone " and " Telephone " , " promised a new direction , but all Beyoncé did was show up to prove she could out @-@ Gaga Gaga , then return to her comfort zone . " Kyle Anderson of MTV , felt that " Gaga got a bit lost in the mix " of " Video Phone " . David Balls of the website Digital Spy gave a negative review for the remix version , grading it two out of five starts . He further commented , 
 " Needless to say , the pair work their superstar pulling power for all it 's worth . Over sparse and eerie beats , they deliver innuendo @-@ laced lyrics , groan near @-@ <unk> and generally tease us with the prospect of doing all sorts of naughty things on , well , your video phone . While the promo clip offers some of the intended thrill , the track itself - single number eight from I Am ... - lacks the sparkle of previous offerings . It may provide a brief rush of excitement to the loins , but ultimately leaves you feeling fluffed rather than fully @-@ serviced by the twosome . "

In an interview with New York 's Z100 radio station , Gaga further commented on her collaboration with Knowles , for the music video . She said , " When I was doing her video with her , she called me and she said , ' What do you want to do ? ' [ ... ] And I 'm like , ' I don 't want to show up in some frickin ' hair bow and be fashion Gaga in your video . ' I said , ' I want to do you . ' [ ... ] I want to do my version of Beyoncé . So the whole time I was learning the choreography they were calling me Gee @-@ <unk> . " Later , during an interview with MTV News , she explained : 
 " What I was excited about is with B [ eyoncé ] , I had no ego . Neither of us had an ego . It wasn 't about competition . It was about , like , ' Man let 's give the world what they want . Let 's do a real girl @-@ power collaboration where we support one another . ' I said , ' I want to do you in your video , and I want to tribute you . I want to dress up like you ' . And Hype Williams ... was so excited . He was like , ' Gaga I want no makeup on your face . ' It was really stripped down — real Beyoncé hair , and we wore the same outfit in the video , and I [ paid tribute to ] her . [ ... ] I wanted to [ work with her ] because this was an era for her in her career where she defined herself aesthetically . And that should be applauded that a woman did that . She 's so great at what she does . " 
 The video was initially set to premiere on November 5 , 2009 but did not actually premiere until November 17 , 2009 . Two previews of the video were posted online one day before its official release , on November 16 , 2009 .

 James Montgomery from MTV commented that " it 's a little surprising that the just @-@ released clip for Beyoncé 's ' Video Phone ' has nary a flame or fish @-@ eye shot ( there are , of course , plenty of outlandish costumes ) . However , don 't make the mistake of thinking this video is by any means straightforward — it 's plenty WTF ! [ ... ] It 's definitely not the Gaga we 're used to seeing , but her appearance isn 't exactly run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mill , either . And neither is this video , for that matter . Especially not when you 're watching Beyoncé snap her gum and shake her hips and grope an AK @-@ 47 while the screen pops from electric green to Kool @-@ Aid red . " Jocelyn Vena of the same publication noted , " The clip is charged with energy , and the cynics out there might wonder if putting two sizzling divas in a room together created any kind of rivalry . " Jim Farber from New York 's Daily News compared Knowles ' look to that of pin @-@ up model Bettie Page , and said " The clip for ' Video Phone ' [ ... ] doesn 't offer much in the way of chemistry or even interaction between the two divas . [ The ] clip seems about as innovative as a rotary dial up . " Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone commented that the video was an " almost seizure @-@ inducing parade of cinematic homages and wardrobe changes . " He also compared Knowles ' look to Page , as well as Katy Perry and rapper M.I.A. The Daily Mail gave a positive review of the video , calling it avant @-@ garde and naughty . 
 New York magazine 's Amy Odell commented that " The intricacy of her [ Knowles ' ] wardrobe [ in the video ] suggests she 's feeling the Gaga pressure . " She further added : " In a burgeoning phenomenon we might call the Gaga Effect , divas everywhere may feel the pressure to push avant @-@ garde fashion to the max to keep up with the <unk> wonder . Beyoncé 's fashion efforts in ' Video Phone ' — which make her epic diva money fan a mere distant memory — deserve a look @-@ by @-@ look analysis , because she tried really hard . " In another review , she said " Together they play with colored fire @-@ spitting water guns and look like the best of diva friends . " Entertainment Weekly 's Leah Greenblatt commented that the video was " B [ eyoncé ] ' s show — La [ dy ] Gaga 's just guesting in it . " Greenblatt also praised the fashion designs used in the video and the Bettie Page " vibes " . Spin 's Chris <unk> felt that Gaga " does her best Beyonce impression " in the video for the song . However , he said that " Even with Gaga involved , the Hype Williams @-@ produced video doesn 't veer too much into the weird ; it 's certainly not Gaga @-@ setting @-@ men @-@ on @-@ fire weird . " Margaret Wappler of The Arizona Republic praised the video saying that it had " electrifying color schemes and high @-@ shine lighting , resulting in a fantastical pop mirage between Lady Gaga and Beyonce " . She further called it a " kinetic spectacle to behold , with enough guns to make Ted Nugent weep with jealousy and some hot Bettie Page bangs on Beyonce that should prompt plenty of ladies to run to the hairdresser " . Wappler finished her review by concluding that " the whole video has a distinct and not unpleasant 90s vibe . " Francesca Stabile of The Village Voice gave a positive review for the video praising the outfits used in the video and the " oversized sequined sweater that makes an appearance toward the end " .

 The Country Wife is a Restoration comedy written in 1675 by William Wycherley . A product of the tolerant early Restoration period , the play reflects an aristocratic and anti @-@ Puritan ideology , and was controversial for its sexual explicitness even in its own time . The title itself contains a lewd pun . It is based on several plays by Molière , with added features that 1670s London audiences demanded : colloquial prose dialogue in place of Molière 's verse , a complicated , fast @-@ paced plot tangle , and many sex jokes . It turns on two indelicate plot devices : a rake 's trick of pretending impotence to safely have clandestine affairs with married women , and the arrival in London of an inexperienced young " country wife " , with her discovery of the joys of town life , especially the fascinating London men . 
 The scandalous trick and the frank language have for much of the play 's history kept it off the stage and out of print . Between 1753 and 1924 , The Country Wife was considered too outrageous to be performed at all and was replaced on the stage by David Garrick 's cleaned @-@ up and bland version The Country Girl , now a forgotten curiosity . The original play is again a stage favourite today , and is also acclaimed by academic critics , who praise its linguistic energy , sharp social satire , and openness to different interpretations . 
 = = Background = = 
 After the 18 @-@ year Puritan stage ban was lifted at the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 , the theatrical life of London recreated itself quickly and abundantly . During the reign of Charles II ( 1660 – 1685 ) , playwrights such as John Dryden , George <unk> , Aphra Behn , and William Wycherley wrote comedies that triumphantly reassert aristocratic dominance and prestige after the years of middle class power during Oliver Cromwell 's Commonwealth . Reflecting the atmosphere of the Court , these plays celebrate a lifestyle of sensual intrigue and conquest , especially conquest that served to humiliate the husbands of the London middle classes and to avenge , in the sensual arena , the marginalisation and exile suffered by royalists under Cromwell . Charles ' personal interest in the stage nourished Restoration drama , and his most favoured courtiers were poets , playwrights , and men of wit , such as John Wilmot , Earl of Rochester , Charles Sackville , Earl of Dorset , and William Wycherley . Wycherley had no title or wealth , but had by 1675 already recommended himself by two well @-@ received comedies and had been admitted to the inner circle , sharing the conversation and sometimes the mistresses of Charles , who " was extremely fond of him upon account of his wit " . In 1675 , at age 35 , he created a sensation with The Country Wife , greeted as the <unk> and wittiest play yet seen on the English stage . 
 Like Charles II , Wycherley had spent some Commonwealth years in France and become interested in French drama , and throughout his short playwriting career ( 1671 – 1676 ) he would borrow plotlines and techniques from French plays , particularly Molière . However , in contrast to the French , English audiences of the 1670s had no enthusiasm for structurally simple comedies or for the neoclassical unities of time , place , and action , but demanded fast pace , many complications , and above all " variety " . To achieve the much denser texture and more complex plotting that pleased in London , Wycherley would combine several source plays to produce bustling action and clashing moods , ranging from farce through paradox to satire . 
 A Restoration novelty of which Wycherley took advantage was the readiness of public opinion to accept women on stage , for the first time in British history . Audiences were fascinated to see real women reverse the cross @-@ dressing of the Elizabethan boy actors and appear in tight @-@ fitting male outfits in the popular breeches roles , and to hear them match or even outdo the rake heroes in repartee and double entendre . Charles ' choice of actresses as mistresses , notably Nell Gwyn , helped keep the interest fresh , and Wycherley plays on this interest in The Country Wife by having Mr. Pinchwife disguise his wife ( the eponymous ' country wife ' ) in a boy 's outfit . It has also been suggested that he uses the allure of women on display to emphasise in an almost voyeuristic way Margery 's provocative innocence , as well as the immodest knowingness of " town " wives like Lady Fidget . 
 = = Plots = = 
 The Country Wife is more neatly constructed than most Restoration comedies , but is typical of its time and place in having three sources and three plots . The separate plots are interlinked but distinct , each projecting a sharply different mood . They may be <unk> as Horner 's impotence trick , the married life of Pinchwife and Margery , and the courtship of Harcourt and Alithea . 
 1 . Horner 's impotence trick provides the play 's organising principle and the turning @-@ points of the action . The trick , to pretend impotence to be allowed where no complete man may go , is ( distantly ) based on the classic Roman comedy <unk> by Terence . The upper @-@ class town rake Harry Horner begins a campaign for seducing as many respectable ladies as possible and thus cuckolding or " putting horns on " their husbands : Horner 's name serves to alert the audience to what is going on . He spreads a false rumour of his own impotence , to convince married men that he can safely be allowed to socialise with their wives . The rumour is also meant to assist his mass seduction campaign by helping him identify women who are secretly eager for extramarital sex , because those women will react to a supposedly impotent man with tell @-@ tale horror and disgust . This diagnostic trick , which invariably works perfectly , is one of The Country Wife 's many running jokes at the expense of hypocritical upper @-@ class women who are rakes at heart . 
 Horner 's ruse of impotence is a great success , and he has sex with many ladies of virtuous reputation , mostly the wives and daughters of citizens or " <unk> " , i.e. upwardly mobile businessmen and entrepreneurs of the City of London , as opposed to the Town , the aristocratic quarters where Horner and his friends live . Three such ladies appear on stage , usually together : Lady Fidget , her sister @-@ in @-@ law Mrs Dainty Fidget , and her tag @-@ along friend Mrs Squeamish – names that convey both a delicate sensitivity about the jewel of reputation , and a certain fidgety physical unease or tickle – and the dialogue gives an indefinite impression of many more . The play is structured as a farce , driven by Horner 's secret and by a succession of near @-@ discoveries of the truth , from which he <unk> himself by aplomb and good luck . A final hair @-@ raising threat of exposure comes in the last scene , through the well @-@ meaning frankness of the young country wife Margery Pinchwife . Margery is indignant at the accusations of impotence directed at " poor dear Mr. Horner " , which she knows from personal experience to be untrue , and is intent on saying so at the traditional end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ play public gathering of the entire cast . In a final trickster masterpiece , Horner averts the danger , joining forces with his more sophisticated lovers to persuade the jealous Pinchwife to at least pretend to believe Horner impotent and his own wife still innocent . Horner never becomes a reformed character but is assumed to go on reaping the fruits of his planted misinformation , past the last act and beyond . 
 2 . The married life of Pinchwife and Margery is based on Molière 's School For Husbands ( 1661 ) and School For Wives ( 1662 ) . Pinchwife is a middle @-@ aged man who has married a naive country girl in the hope that she will not know to cuckold him . However , Horner teaches her , and Margery cuts a swath through the complexities of London upper @-@ class marriage and seduction without even noticing them . Restoration comedies often contrast town and country for humorous effect , and this is one example of it . Both Molière in the School For Wives and Wycherley in The Country Wife get much comic business out of the meeting between , on the one hand , innocent but inquisitive young girls and , on the other hand , the sophisticated 17th @-@ century culture of sexual relations which they encounter . The difference , which would later make Molière acceptable and Wycherley atrocious to 19th @-@ century critics and theatre producers , is that Molière 's Agnes is naturally pure and virtuous , while Margery is just the opposite : enthusiastic about the virile <unk> of town gallants , rakes , and especially theatre actors , she keeps Pinchwife in a state of continual horror with her plain @-@ spokenness and her interest in sex . A running joke is the way Pinchwife 's pathological jealousy always leads him into supplying Margery with the very type of information he wishes her not to have . 
 3 . The courtship of Harcourt and Alithea is a conventional love story without any direct source . By means of persistence and true love , the witty Harcourt , Horner 's friend , wins the hand of Pinchwife 's sister Alithea , who is , when the play opens , engaged to the shallow fop Sparkish . The delay mechanism of this story is that the upright Alithea holds fast virtuously to her engagement to Sparkish , even while his stupid and cynical character unfolds to her . It is only after Alithea has been caught in a misleadingly compromising situation with Horner , and Sparkish has doubted her virtue while Harcourt has not , that she finally admits her love for Harcourt .
