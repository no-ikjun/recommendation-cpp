 = Eeyore 's Birthday Party = 
 Eeyore 's Birthday Party is a day @-@ long festival taking place annually in Austin , Texas since 1963 . It typically occurs on the last Saturday of April in Austin 's Pease District Park . It includes live music , food and drink vending which benefit local non @-@ profit organizations , attendees in colorful costumes , and very large drum circles . The event is frequented by children and families , with specific events presented for them by the event organizers . The festival is named in honor of Eeyore , a character in A. A. Milne 's Winnie @-@ the @-@ Pooh stories . 
 = = History = = 
 Eeyore 's Birthday Party began in 1963 as a spring party and picnic for Department of English students at the University of Texas at Austin by Lloyd W. Birdwell , Jr. and other UT students . It was named for Eeyore , a chronically depressed donkey in A. A. Milne 's Winnie @-@ the @-@ Pooh stories who , in one story , believes his friends have forgotten his birthday only to discover they have planned a surprise party for him . Despite its name , the event does not fall on the official birthday of the fictional character . The original event featured a trashcan full of lemonade , beer , honey sandwiches , a live , flower @-@ draped donkey , and a may pole ( in keeping with the event 's proximity to May Day ) . For many years the party was a UT tradition , but subsequently the annual Birthday Party became a tradition in Austin 's hippie subculture . 
 When the festival moved from <unk> Park to Pease District Park in 1974 , Austin @-@ area non @-@ profit Friends of the Forest Foundation , an organization which distributes funds to other area charities , began arranging for food and drink vendors at the festival . They continue this task today along with arranging public services ( toilets , buses , security , medics ) and scheduling live music and family @-@ oriented games and contests . The event is still known to most as a festival oriented towards modern hippies . It now boasts an annual attendance in the thousands . 
 Over time , the festival has outgrown its original founders . It is now sponsored by the Friends of the Forest Foundation . 
 = = Contemporary = = 
 Drummers bring a wide variety of instruments from hand drums to kettledrums . What started as a small picnic for University of Texas at Austin students has today swelled to a major annual festival with live bands , non @-@ profit vendors of food , drink and local beers , as well as a children 's area complete with arts and crafts and carnival games , family @-@ oriented games and contests such as costume contests , and an egg toss . Attendance at the Birthday Party is free . Weather @-@ permitting , it occurs on the last Saturday in April in Pease District Park ; a rain date is scheduled for the following weekend . Bright and diverse costumes are common . In keeping with the original traditions of the event , a live donkey and a may pole are always present . The event begins in the late morning and continues until dusk . Food and drinks are sold onsite by local Austin <unk> @-@ 3 non @-@ profit groups . Purified water is available onsite for participants to fill their own containers . Due to the lack of parking in the area and the high attendance , the Friends of the Forest Foundation provides festive shuttle buses between state parking lots just north of the capitol building and Pease Park . Singing of folk and road trip songs is encouraged on the short bus ride . 
 Eeyore 's Birthday Party is attended by people from a wide variety of backgrounds and ages , some of whom may have been attending for decades . Austin 's hippie community still puts in a major appearance at the event , which they celebrate by forming large drum circles which can sometimes contain hundreds of drummers and dancers in the large areas of the park not occupied by other events . Members of the Deaf community like the drum circles because they can feel the vibrations . 
 As of 2008 , the event has also spread to Seattle 's Cal Anderson Park as an annual celebration . 
 = SM U @-@ 28 ( Austria @-@ Hungary ) = 
 SM U @-@ 28 or U @-@ XXVIII was a U @-@ 27 class U @-@ boat or submarine for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . U @-@ 28 , built by the Austrian firm of Cantiere Navale Triestino ( CNT ) at the Pola Navy Yard , was launched in January 1917 and commissioned in June . 
 She had a single hull and was just over 121 feet ( 37 m ) in length . She displaced nearly 265 metric tons ( 261 long tons ) when surfaced and over 300 metric tons ( 295 long tons ) when submerged . Her two diesel engines moved her at up to 9 knots ( 17 km / h ) on the surface , while her twin electric motors propelled her at up to 7 @.@ 5 knots ( 13 @.@ 9 km / h ) while underwater . She was armed with two bow torpedo tubes and could carry a load of up to four torpedoes . She was also equipped with a 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) deck gun and a machine gun . 
 During her service career , U @-@ 28 sank the British Q ship Bradford City and nine other ships , sending a combined tonnage of 47 @,@ 743 GRT to the bottom . U @-@ 28 was surrendered at Venice in 1919 , granted to Italy as a war reparation and broken up the following year . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Austria @-@ Hungary 's U @-@ boat fleet was largely obsolete at the outbreak of World War I. The Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy satisfied its most urgent needs by purchasing five Type UB I submarines that comprised the U @-@ 10 class from Germany , by raising and recommissioning the sunken French submarine Curie as U @-@ 14 , and by building four submarines of the U @-@ 20 class that were based on the 1911 Danish Havmanden class . 
 After these steps alleviated their most urgent needs , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy selected the German Type UB II design for its newest submarines in mid 1915 . The Germans were reluctant to allocate any of their wartime resources to Austro @-@ Hungarian construction , but were willing to sell plans for up to six of the UB II boats to be constructed under license in Austria @-@ Hungary . The Navy agreed to the proposal and purchased the plans from AG Weser of Bremen . 
 U @-@ 28 displaced 264 metric tons ( 260 long tons ) surfaced and 301 metric tons ( 296 long tons ) submerged . She had a single hull with saddle tanks , and was 121 feet 1 inch ( 36 @.@ 91 m ) long with a beam of 14 feet 4 inches ( 4 @.@ 37 m ) and a draft of 12 feet 2 inches ( 3 @.@ 71 m ) . For propulsion , she had two shafts , twin diesel engines of 270 bhp ( 200 kW ) for surface running , and twin electric motors of 280 shp ( 210 kW ) for submerged travel . She was capable of 9 knots ( 16 @.@ 7 km / h ) while surfaced and 7 @.@ 5 knots ( 13 @.@ 9 km / h ) while submerged . Although there is no specific notation of a range for U @-@ 28 in Conway 's All the World 's Fighting Ships , 1906 – 1921 , the German UB II boats , upon which the U @-@ 27 class was based , had a range of over 6 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 000 km ) at 5 knots ( 9 @.@ 3 km / h ) surfaced , and 45 nautical miles ( 83 km ) at 4 knots ( 7 @.@ 4 km / h ) submerged . U @-@ 27 @-@ class boats were designed for a crew of 23 – 24 . 
 U @-@ 28 was armed with two 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) bow torpedo tubes and could carry a complement of four torpedoes . She was also equipped with a 75 mm / 26 ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) deck gun and an 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine gun . 
 After intricate political negotiations to allocate production of the class between Austrian and Hungarian firms , U @-@ 28 was ordered from Cantiere Navale Triestino ( CNT ) on 12 October 1915 . She was laid down by early 1916 at the Pola Navy Yard , and launched on 8 January 1917 . 
 = = Service career = = 
 After her completion , U @-@ 28 was commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy on 26 June 1917 under the command of Linienschiffsleutnant Zdenko Hudeček . Previously in command of U @-@ 17 , Hudeček was a 30 @-@ year @-@ old native of Theresienstadt ( present @-@ day <unk> in the Czech Republic ) . Four days after the U @-@ boat 's commissioning , Hudeček achieved his first kill at the helm of U @-@ 28 . On 30 June , while on patrol about 40 nautical miles ( 74 km ) east of Malta , U @-@ 28 came upon the 4 @,@ 809 @-@ ton British steamer Haigh Hall . The turret hull ship was carrying wheat from Bombay to Naples when torpedoed and sunk by Hudeček . Three days later , the British India passenger ship <unk> met the same fate . Even though escorted by an Italian destroyer and a trawler , <unk> was torpedoed and sunk by U @-@ 28 just 1 @.@ 5 nautical miles ( 2 @.@ 8 km ) from the breakwater at Messina . The 8 @,@ 205 @-@ ton liner — the largest ship sunk by U @-@ 28 — was en route from Sydney to London when she went down , but was spared any loss of life in the attack . In eight days in commission , U @-@ 28 's tally was over 13 @,@ 000 tons , already exceeding the totals of all four U @-@ boats of the U @-@ 20 class . 
 The following month , U @-@ 28 sank the 3 @,@ 881 @-@ ton collier <unk> 35 nautical miles ( 65 km ) from Cape Spartivento , Calabria , on 13 August , killing two men of the British ship 's crew . Three days after <unk> went down , U @-@ 28 sank Bradford City , a 3 @,@ 683 @-@ ton British Q ship in the Straits of Messina , with no loss of life . Bradford City , operating under the pseudonym Saros , had been particularly detached to the Straits to hunt U @-@ 28 and had ignored orders to proceed to port from officers unaware of her naval status . After the torpedo struck , the ship 's " panic party " had taken to the boats in the hope of luring her attacker to the surface , but the arrival of the French naval trawler Hiver drove U @-@ 28 away before the gun crews aboard Bradford City could engage the submarine . Bradford City sank within 30 minutes off San Remo . In October , U @-@ 28 closed out her 1917 list of victims with <unk> , a British steamer sunk 60 nautical miles ( 110 km ) north @-@ northeast of Susa . The 3 @,@ 296 @-@ ton steamer was sailing in ballast from Marseilles for Karachi . 
 In January 1918 , U @-@ 28 sank an additional three ships . <unk> , an Italian steamer of 2 @,@ 723 tons headed for Salonika , was sent to the bottom near Cape Spartivento on 12 January . The following day , U @-@ 28 dispatched the British steamer Rapallo 1 @.@ 5 nautical miles ( 2 @.@ 8 km ) south of Cape <unk> . One sailor aboard the one @-@ year @-@ old ship died in the attack , which occurred while the ship was headed to Messina in ballast . On 21 January , West Wales , a collier headed from Barry to Alexandria , was sunk 140 nautical miles ( 260 km ) from Malta , taking her load of coal and two of her crew to the bottom . 
 On 8 March , U @-@ 28 attacked two ships , sinking one of them . The first ship , Mitra , a 5 @,@ 592 @-@ ton tanker was hit by U @-@ 28 but was able to make port in Malta with her cargo of oil . Later in the month , U @-@ 28 sank Uganda 32 nautical miles ( 59 km ) from <unk> , killing one sailor in the attack . The 1905 British ship was carrying cotton and cottonseed from Alexandria for London when the attack occurred . Three days later , Stolt Nielsen , a 5 @,@ 684 @-@ ton steamship , was sent to the bottom 38 nautical miles ( 70 km ) from Malta . Carrying a general cargo for the Admiralty when she went down , the British ship turned out to be the final ship to be sunk by U @-@ 28 . 
 At the war 's end , U @-@ 28 was surrendered to Italy at Venice in 1919 . Later awarded to Italy as a war reparation , she was scrapped at Venice in 1920 . In her 18 @-@ month career , U @-@ 28 sank ten ships with a combined tonnage of 44 @,@ 743 , and damaged an eleventh .

 " In a Mirror , Darkly " is the eighteenth and nineteenth episodes of the fourth season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : Enterprise , and originally aired on April 22 and 29 , 2005 . This installment was developed to be a sequel to The Original Series episode " The Tholian Web " and a prequel to " Mirror , Mirror " . The decision to set an Enterprise episode in the mirror universe originated with a pitch to enable William Shatner to appear in the series . The teleplays for both parts of the episode were written by Mike Sussman , with Manny Coto contributing the story for the second part . 
 Set in the 22nd century , the series normally follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship Enterprise , registration NX @-@ 01 . However , these installments feature a mirror universe Jonathan Archer and evil counterparts of the normal characters , who serve the cruel and militaristic Terran Empire . In the first part , the ISS Enterprise learns of a Starfleet ship from the future of the main universe which is being stripped for parts by the Tholians , and seeks to take the ship from the aliens . The second part sees the surviving crew operating the USS Defiant and seeking to overthrow the Empire using its advanced weaponry . 
 The episode saw the reuse of footage from Star Trek : First Contact and the creation of an alternative opening credits sequence which included footage from other Paramount properties such as the film The Hunt for Red October . A three @-@ quarters @-@ around bridge from The Original Series era was constructed , as well as other sets from a Constitution class starship . A Gorn and a Tholian were both created using CGI , with the Gorn utilizing motion capture techniques . This installment also saw the return of Vaughn Armstrong after his main universe character was killed on screen earlier in the season in the episode " The Forge " . The critical response to " In a Mirror , Darkly " was initially mixed , but it subsequently appeared in several lists of the best episodes of Star Trek : Enterprise . It was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Hairstyling for a Series in 2005 .

 In 2063 , a Vulcan ship lands on Earth , making first contact with humans ( as seen in Star Trek : First Contact ) . Instead of peacefully greeting them , Zefram Cochrane shoots the lead Vulcan and the humans storm and loot the ship . In <unk> , Doctor Phlox and Major Reed demonstrate a new torture device to Captain Forrest and Commander Archer on the ISS Enterprise . Archer suggests to Forrest they travel into Tholian space , as he has heard rumors of technology they might wish to steal . The two argue , and Forrest returns to his quarters where he is comforted by Lieutenant Sato . When he leaves , he is ambushed by Archer and several MACOs and sent to the brig . 
 Archer travels to the bridge and announces that he has taken command . After torturing a Tholian pilot for coordinates , he orders a change of course to the shipyard , and tells Commander T 'Pol , whom he promotes to first officer , to install a Suliban cloaking device with Commander Tucker . Archer also appoints Sergeant Mayweather as his personal guard , and Sato proposes that she keep her job as Captain 's woman . Archer has Sato send a message to Starfleet about their mission to raid the Tholian technology . Tucker is injured when the cloaking device is sabotaged . Archer questions Forrest , who denies all knowledge , and Reed tortures Tucker expecting him to be the saboteur . 
 T 'Pol leads a team to free Forrest and reclaim the ship , but Archer <unk> navigation control to prevent a course change . Forrest tortures Archer , but orders his release after he receives word that Starfleet agrees with Archer 's plans . Archer shows images of an alternate universe vessel from the future named USS Defiant ( a Constitution @-@ class starship , last seen in " The Tholian Web " ) , that has technology and power that is a century more advanced than ISS Enterprise . On arriving at the shipyard , Archer , T 'Pol , and Tucker transport across , and Tucker begins powering up the vessel . Tholian vessels then attack , creating an energy web around Enterprise . Forrest orders the crew to abandon ship but remains behind as the ship is destroyed . 
 = = = Part II = = = 
 Several Tholian ships then create a web over the opening of the dock to prevent Defiant from leaving . T 'Pol and Tucker restore power to the weapon systems , allowing Defiant to destroy enough enemy vessels to escape the trap . They recover 47 survivors from Enterprise , and Tucker is ordered to restore power to the warp drive . Sato goes to the captain 's quarters and finds Archer perusing the ship 's historical records , which includes parallel universe information about Starfleet , the United Federation of Planets , and their service records . Archer is surprised to learn his counterpart is an acclaimed and distinguished explorer , diplomat and politician . 
 Ensign Kelby is killed trying to repair the warp drive , and the crew discover , from Tholian slaves left on board , that a Gorn named <unk> has sabotaged the ship . Archer , after hearing voices telling him to achieve more fame and honor , decides to lead an assault team himself and kills the Gorn . Tucker is able to repair the warp drive and the ship then leaves to rendezvous with the ISS Avenger — arriving in time to save it from four rebel spacecraft . Avenger 's commanding officer , Admiral Black comes aboard for an inspection accompanied by his first officer , Soval . After Black refuses Archer 's request for captaincy of the new ship , Archer disintegrates him with a phaser pistol . 
 Archer gives a speech to the officers of both ships , saying that they should move against Starfleet and the Empire . Soval and T 'Pol meet , contemplating a future where alien species were respected and treated as equals ; they convince Phlox to join their movement and sabotage Defiant . As the sole alien allowed to remain on board , he succeeds in disabling the ship 's systems . Soval , on Avenger , then attacks , but Tucker disables Phlox and restores power . Defiant destroys its attacker , and when Sato and Archer celebrate in the captain 's quarters , Archer dies after Mayweather defects to Sato . Reaching Earth on the advanced and powerful Defiant , Sato contacts Admiral Gardner demanding his surrender and declaring herself " Empress Sato " .

 The idea of returning to the mirror universe in Enterprise was first suggested by Judith and Garfield Reeves @-@ Stevens . In " Mirror , Mirror " , the <unk> field was used on several occasions and was thought to be a <unk> . The Reeves @-@ Stevens proposed that it could be explained that instead of killing its victims , the field instead transported them back through time to a penal colony in the main universe . The Enterprise would then come across the penal colony , meeting Tiberius , portrayed by William Shatner . 
 Tiberius would seek to use the transporter aboard the Enterprise to return to his own universe , but discovers that it has not yet diverged from the main universe and does not exist . The episode would then have explored the creation of the mirror universe through actions by Tiberius and Captain Archer . The storyline was pitched by Shatner , who had worked with the Reeves @-@ Stevens on the Shatnerverse series of Star Trek novels , to Manny Coto , Brannon Braga and Rick Berman . Berman had already received a pitch by Mike Sussman that would have Shatner portray an ancestor of Captain Kirk , who happened to be the chef on the Enterprise ( NX @-@ 01 ) . The three pitched the idea to Shatner , but negotiations fell through and terms were not agreed for him to appear on the show . 
 Sussman began development on a script that saw the USS Defiant from " The Tholian Web " being brought back in time , instead of Tiberius . It was intended to be a sequel to that episode , as well as a prequel to " Mirror , Mirror " . Sussman developed the teleplays for both parts of the episode , with Coto contributing the story for the second half . It was decided to have the entire installment in the mirror universe in order to maintain the events of " Mirror , Mirror " as being first contact between the two universes . The mirror universe features evil duplicates of the characters from the normal universe . Sussman had previously sought to use the Defiant in the second season episode " Future Tense " , but both costs and issues with the plot resulted in it being replaced with a previously unseen <unk> . 
 The first part of " In a Mirror , Darkly " was the 700th live @-@ action Star Trek episode broadcast . On the sixth day of filming the second part of the episode , news was received that Star Trek : Enterprise had been cancelled by UPN as of the end of the season , which meant that " In a Mirror , Darkly " would be installments 94 and 95 of Enterprise 's 98 episode run . " In a Mirror , Darkly " was Sussman 's final contribution to the show ; he had previously been a staff writer on Star Trek : Voyager and worked in the Star Trek franchise for ten years . He later described it as his favorite episode of Star Trek , saying that " I knew when I was writing them that they would almost certainly be the last episodes I would be writing for this particular incarnation of Star Trek , so I really treasured the experience . " Part of Manny Coto 's plans for season five of Enterprise would have included a return to the mirror universe crew first seen in " In a Mirror , Darkly " . It would have been across four or five installments , which Coto described as a " mini @-@ series within a series " . 
 = = = Visual effects and costuming = = = 
 The opening sequence featured the reuse of footage from Star Trek : First Contact , where Zefram Cochrane makes first contact with the Vulcans , for which both James Cromwell and Cully Fredricksen agreed to accept Screen Actors Guild minimum salaries . Herman Zimmerman had kept the lower portion of the Vulcan vessel from that scene , and made it available to use for reshoots . While Enterprise was normally shot in digital , the mirror @-@ First Contact scenes were shot on film so that they would match the appearance of the original footage . An alternative opening credits sequence was created , which Sussman credited Coto for . It featured footage used in other Paramount Pictures productions , including the Soviet nuclear submarine <unk> firing a torpedo from The Hunt for Red October . Other elements include an atomic explosion , battleships , tanks and fighter jets . 
 Zimmerman led the construction of a full three @-@ quarters around set to represent the bridge of the USS Defiant , which was used from the final day of filming the first part of this episode . It was the first time that a bridge set of that scale from a Constitution @-@ class starship from The Original Series had been used since the final episode " Turnabout Intruder " was aired in 1969 . Senior illustrator Doug Drexler was involved in the design ; he had previously worked on the research that went into re @-@ creating parts of The Original Series era USS Enterprise for the Star Trek : Deep Space Nine episode " Trials and Tribble @-@ ations " , as well as a set which was exhibited in Hyde Park in London . Other designers included in the creation of the set were Anna Packard , Michael Okuda and James Van Over . The actual construction of the set was in the hands of Tom Arp and his team . Sussman said of the set , " I think the bridge set is remarkable . I hope fans will be thrilled to see that set again in all of its glory . I feel that it probably looks better than the original in many respects , if you compare them side by side . " 
 The bridge of the Enterprise had previously been recreated twice in Star Trek series since the end of The Original Series . In the Star Trek : The Next Generation episode " Relics " , only the engineering console was reconstructed , with the Captain 's chair and the navigation consoles rented from a fan and the remaining consoles were edited in digitally using blue screens . Incomplete sets were also recreated for the Deep Space Nine episode " Trials and Tribble @-@ ations " , but these involved digitally inserting the actors into previous footage of The Original Series and so a full bridge set was not recreated . 
 Further sets for the Defiant were created for the second part of the episode , which included designs previously used in " Trials and Tribble @-@ ations " for the Jefferies tube . The other sets included the Rec Room , Captain 's quarters and the briefing room . Classic Original Series style uniforms were worn by some the main cast in the second installment , although as each vessel of that era had a slightly different Starfleet logo , one had to be designed for the Defiant as it hadn 't previously been seen on screen . Bakula wore the wrap @-@ around green uniform previously worn by Shatner in several episodes including " The Trouble With Tribbles " , while Trinneer , Keating and Montgomery donned red shirts . Bakula joked “ Did we run out of material for Jolene 's skirt ? ” as Blalock wore the science @-@ blue miniskirt in the style of that worn by Christine Chapel . The normal Enterprise costumes also underwent changes , with those worn by female members of the crew having a portion removed to reveal their midriffs . 
 Original Series props such as phasers and <unk> were also created for the episode . Despite the mirror @-@ Enterprise being destroyed in the first installment , during the second episode the standing sets were reused to represent the ISS Avenger . Both a Tholian and a Gorn were created in post production using CGI . The Gorn in particular required an actor in a tracking suit to allow the actors to interact with the character and give the animators something to overlay the CGI on . Stunt coordinator Vince Deadrick , Jr. wore the suit for scenes that required movement , while David Anderson wore it for static shots . Sussman also wrote biographies for Archer and Hoshi that would briefly appear on screen . Included in these were references to Archer becoming President of the Federation and that a planet called Archer IV that had previously appeared in Star Trek : The Next Generation was in fact named after him . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 The episode saw the return of Vaughn Armstrong as Captain Maximilian Forest . His main universe character , Rear Admiral Maxwell Forest , had been killed earlier in the season in the episode " The Forge " . Both Bakula and Armstrong joked about the character suffering two deaths during the same season , although Armstrong also said of the relationship between mirror @-@ Forrest and mirror @-@ Hoshi that " In 25 years [ of acting ] , I haven 't gotten the girl , but I come back here and I get the girl ! This is great . " Gary Graham returned as the Vulcan Soval , who was a science officer aboard the Avenger in the mirror universe rather than his normal position of the Vulcan Ambassador . Graham was given a goatee beard in reference to the mirror universe Spock from " Mirror , Mirror " . 
 Other guest stars in " In a Mirror , Darkly " included Gregory Itzin , who had previously appeared as a Vulcan commando in " Shadows of P <unk> " as well as episodes of Star Trek : Voyager and Deep Space Nine . Derek Magyar returned for his third appearance as Kelby after previously appearing in " Affliction " and " Bound " . Writer Mike Sussman also appeared on screen , as one of the dead Defiant crew @-@ members . With this episode , actress Majel Barrett , widow of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry , became the only actor to participate in every Star Trek series , including the Animated Series , as well as both the Original Series @-@ based and Next Generation @-@ based film series . In this episode , she provided the voice of the starship Defiant 's computer . Her voice continued to be used as that of Starfleet computers after the cancellation of Enterprise in the J. J. Abrams led Star Trek films . 
 These installments saw significant changes to the characters of the main cast . Linda Park , who plays Hoshi Sato in the series , later said that they were her favorite episodes of the show . She later explained that " Mirror Hoshi was strong in the way that Medea is strong , in the way that Clytemnestra is strong , in this very archetypal , warrior @-@ woman way . " She credited the role she played in this episode as demonstrating that she could play a tougher character , something which allowed her to gain other roles once the series ended . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The first part of " In a Mirror , Darkly " aired on April 22 , 2005 on UPN in the United States . It received a 2 @.@ 0 / 3 % share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 . This means that it was seen by 2 percent of all households , and 3 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast . This placed UPN fifth out of the major networks during the installment 's hour of broadcast , ahead of The WB . This was the only time during the primetime hours that UPN placed ahead of The WB . The second part aired the following week on April 29 . Ratings were similar to the first episode , with another 2 @.@ 0 / 3 % score recorded , and again placing fifth during the timeslot ahead of The WB .

 David Bianculli at the Daily News thought that " In a Mirror , Darkly " was the best episode of Enterprise so far and enjoyed that the actors could play against type for their characters . He gave the episode a score of three and a half out of four and said that it was so much fun that " had they adopted this attitude from the start , " Enterprise " probably would still be flying missions next season . " When reviewing the first part for TrekNation , Michelle Erica Green said that her favorite part was the modified opening sequence , and described it as " fun and lighthearted in a twisted sort of way " but thought that the closing episodes of the series would have been better if they had concentrated on the real crew and ship . She thought that the second installment saw the series " stretching a clever idea too thin " , and that a " one @-@ hour ' Mirror ' would have made more sense in terms of the pacing and for Enterprise as a whole . " 
 Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website " Jammer 's Reviews " gave the first episode a score of three out of four , and the second part a score of two and a half . He described it as an " evil comic book " , and regarding the first part , " To call this episode over @-@ the @-@ top would be an understatement . This is a go @-@ for @-@ broke hour of lunatic madness . " His view on the second part was that while the re @-@ created sets were impressive , but " it goes so far over the top that it comes back around and kicks itself in its own ass . It 's overplayed , overacted , and over @-@ goofy . " 
 " In a Mirror , Darkly " has been featured in several " Best of " episode lists . In 2009 , it was ranked the best episode of Star Trek : Enterprise by James Hunt at the website Den of Geek . He said that " although the novelty value of seeing the cast playing cartoonishly evil versions of themselves is a good enough reason to watch this 2 @-@ parter , In a Mirror , Darkly manages to include some of Enterprise 's most inventive moments , not least the revised opening credits " . Empire magazine ranked it the second best episode behind " Terra Prime " . Jay Garmon at TechRepublic ranked it as the fifth best episode , saying that the writers managed to include a " gleefully malicious and fatal series of unexpected double @-@ crosses , but also work in some of the most satisfying and coherent mythology gags that Enterprise ever displayed " . In a list of the top 100 episodes of the Star Trek franchise , " In a Mirror , Darkly " was placed in 40th place by Charlie Jane Anders at io9 .

 Taylor is a goalball player , and is a winger and centre . She is classified as a B3 competitor , and has a goalball scholarship with the New South Wales Institute of Sport . 
 When Taylor was ten years old , several years before started the sport , her grandmother made a comment to her after having seen the game that Taylor could play and one day make the Paralympics . Only when she got to high school , in August 2009 , did she start playing the sport . After only a month playing the sport , Taylor was selected for the New South Wales team that competed at the 2009 National Championships , where she was the second leading scorer in what was her first major competition . Playing again for New South Wales , she competed in the 2011 National Championships , and was named the tournament 's MVP . At the 2012 Australian National Championships , her New South Wales team finished second , and she was awarded the Ladies ' MVP and the Kenaghan Medal , which was awarded at the end of the tournament . 
 Taylor made her national team debut in 2010 at the World Championships in Britain . It was the first time the national team had played in three years . The team finished sixth at the 2011 IBSA Goalball World Cup , where she scored her first international goal in a game against the Spain women 's national goalball team . She competed in the 2011 IBSA Africa Oceania Goalball Regional Champions that were hosted in Turkey , which served as the Paralympic qualifying tournament . In her first game against New Zealand , her team won 11 @-@ 4 after leading 7 @-@ 1 at the half time break . She scored one goal in the team 's victory . Australia won the final game against New Zealand by a score of 6 @-@ 2 . She played in the game against New Zealand women 's national goalball team with Taylor scoring a pair of goals in the game . 
 Taylor was named to the Aussie Belles that was going to the 2012 Summer Paralympics . That the team qualified for the Games came as a surprise , as the Australian Paralympic Committee had been working on player development with an idea of the team qualifying for the 2016 Summer Paralympics , and an Australian team had not participated since the 2000 Summer Paralympics , when they earned an automatic selection as hosts , and the team finished last in the competition . Going into the Paralympics , her team was ranked eighth in the world . The Australian Paralympic Committee had chosen to work on her development as a goalball player with the idea that she might be able to qualify for and win a medal at the 2016 Summer Paralympics . Taylor debuted the national team 's Paralympic uniform on 1 May 2012 at the Sydney Overseas Passenger Terminal on day two of the Mercedes @-@ Benz Fashion Week Australia Spring / Summer 2012 / 13 . In the 2012 Summer Paralympics tournament , the Belles played games against Japan , Canada , the United States and Sweden . They lost every game , and did not advance to the finals . 
 = Mona Best = 
 Mona " Mo " Best ( 3 January 1924 – 9 October 1988 ) was born in India , and is best known as the mother of Pete Best ( b . 24 November 1941 ) , who was an early member of The Beatles . Mona also had two other sons , Rory ( b . 1944 ) , and Vincent " Roag " Best ( b . 1962 ) . It was later confirmed that Roag 's father was The Beatles ' associate , Neil Aspinall , although he was not registered as the father on Roag 's birth certificate . 
 After moving to Liverpool from India , the Best family claim that Mona pawned all of her jewellery in 1954 , and used the money to place a 33 – 1 bet on a horse named " Never Say Die " ; using her winnings to buy a house in 1957 . Mona later opened The Casbah Coffee Club in the cellar of the house as a venue for Rock ' n ' Roll music . It was planned as a members @-@ only club for her sons and their friends . The club was often referred to as The Casbah Club , or The Casbah . 
 The Quarrymen : John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison and Ken Brown , frequently played at the Casbah instead of the Cavern Club , which had a jazz @-@ only policy at that time . The Casbah Club cellar — with its original decoration — still exists . In 2006 , the property was accorded a Grade II Heritage listing . Mona died in 1988 , after a heart attack following a long illness . 
 = = India = = 
 Alice Mona Shaw was born on 3 January 1924 , in Delhi , India , to Thomas ( an Irish major ) and Mary Shaw . She was the youngest of four children : Brian , Patrick and Aileen . Her first son , Randolph Peter Scanland ( later surnamed Best ) , was born on 24 November 1941 . Pete 's biological father was marine engineer Donald Peter Scanland , who subsequently died during World War II . Mona was training with the Red Cross when she met Johnny Best , who came from a family of sports promoters in Liverpool that once owned and ran the Liverpool Stadium . At the time of their meeting , Best was a commissioned officer serving as a Physical Training Instructor in India , and was the British Army 's middleweight boxing champion . After their marriage on 7 March 1944 , at St. Thomas 's Cathedral , Bombay , the Bests had one child : Rory Best ( b . January 1945 ) . In late 1945 , the family sailed for four weeks to Liverpool on the Georgic , which was the last troop ship to leave India , carrying single and married ranks who had previously been a part of General Sir William Slim 's forces in southeast Asia . The ship docked in Liverpool on 25 December 1945 . 
 = = = Liverpool = = = 
 Being a part of Best 's family meant Mona was accorded respect on Merseyside , which included meeting well @-@ known sports personalities of the time and receiving preferential treatment when booking a table in a restaurant , or a seat in the theatre . The Bests lived for a short time at the Best family 's large home in West Derby , which was called Ellerslie , but Mona fell out with John Best 's sister , Edna , who resented her brother 's choice of wife . The family then moved to a small flat on Cases Street , Liverpool ( above Ma Edgerton 's public house ) but Mona was always looking for a large house — as she had been used to in India — instead of a smaller semi @-@ detached house , which were prevalent in the area . After moving to a three @-@ bedroom house in Princess Drive , Mona persuaded her parents , Thomas and Mary Shaw , to leave India and live with them in Liverpool . 
 After moving to 17 Queenscourt Road in 1948 — where the Bests lived for nine years — Rory saw a large Victorian house for sale at 8 Hayman 's Green in 1954 , and told his mother about it . The Best family claim that Mona then pawned all her jewellery and placed a bet on a horse that was ridden by Lester Piggott in the 1954 Epsom Derby , called " Never Say Die " , which won at 33 – 1 , and used her winnings to buy the house in 1957 . Note : to place the bet , Mona would have had to travel more than 220 miles from Liverpool to Epsom ( as bets were only allowed at race tracks at the time ) or place the bet with an illegal bookmaker in Liverpool . 8 Hayman 's Green had previously been owned by the West Derby Conservative Club , and was unlike many other family houses in Liverpool , as the house ( built around 1860 ) was set back from the road , had 15 bedrooms and an acre of land . All the rooms were painted dark green or brown , and the garden was totally overgrown . Mona decorated the living room in an Oriental style , which reflected her own upbringing in India . She had previously tried to interest her husband in other houses , including a Formby lighthouse , a windmill in St. Helens and a circular house in Southport , which John disliked and rejected . 
 During 1961 – 1962 , Neil Aspinall became good friends with Pete and subsequently rented a room in the Bests ' home . Aspinall became romantically involved with Mona . During this period , Aspinall fathered a child by Mona : Vincent " Roag " Best . Roag was born on 21 July 1962 , and just three weeks later , on 16 August 1962 , the Beatles dismissed Pete . Roag 's birth certificate was registered on 31 August 1962 , stating his name as " Vincent Rogue [ sic ] Best " and naming John Best as his father . Mona and John Best had separated in the late 1950s or early 1960s . 
 = = The Casbah Coffee Club = = 
 Mona came up with the idea of the club after watching a TV report about The 2i 's Coffee Bar in London 's Soho where several singers had been discovered . She decided to open The Casbah Coffee Club — which was located in her cellar — on 29 August 1959 , for young people to meet and listen to the popular music of the day . Mona charged half a crown annually for membership — to " keep out the rough elements " — and served soft drinks , snacks , cakes , and coffee from an espresso machine , which no other club had at that time . The popular records of the day were played on a small <unk> record player , which amplified them through a speaker of 3 inches ( 76 mm ) . 
 Mona had booked the Les Stewart Quartet to play the opening night with Harrison on guitar , but they cancelled the booking after Stewart and Brown had a quarrel . Stewart was angry that Brown had missed a rehearsal , because Brown was helping Mona to decorate the club . As 300 membership cards had already been sold , Harrison said that he had two friends in a band called The Quarrymen who would play instead . Lennon , McCartney , Stuart Sutcliffe and Harrison went to the club to arrange the booking , to which Mona agreed , but said she needed to finish painting the club first . All four took up brushes and helped Mona to finish painting the walls with spiders , dragons , rainbows , stars , and a beetle , which still survive . John Lennon was short @-@ sighted , mistaking gloss for emulsion paint , which took a long time to dry in the dark , damp cellar . Cynthia Powell , later the wife of Lennon , painted a silhouette of John Lennon on the wall , which is also still intact . 
 The Quarrymen played a series of seven Saturday night concerts in The Casbah for 15 shillings each , starting on 29 August to October 1959 , featuring Brown , Lennon , McCartney and Harrison , but without a drummer , or a PA system . The opening night concert was attended by about 300 local teenagers , but as the cellar had no air @-@ conditioning , and people were dancing , the temperature rose until it became hard to breathe . As there was no amplification , Lennon later persuaded Mona to hire a young amateur guitar player called Harry to play a short set before The Quarrymen , but this was only so they could use his 40 @-@ Watt amplifier . After the success of the first night , Mona gave The Quarrymen a residency , and paid the whole group £ 3 a night . Every Saturday thereafter , queues lengthened onto the street , which was financially good for Mona , as she charged one shilling admission on top of the annual membership fee . 
 Pete was studying at the Collegiate Grammar School when he decided he wanted to be in a music group , so Mona bought him a drum kit from Blackler 's music store and Best formed his own band ; The Black Jacks . Chas Newby joined the group , as did Ken Brown , but only after he had left The Quarrymen . The reason for Brown 's exit from the group was that he turned up on the seventh Saturday night of The Quarrymen residency at The Casbah with the flu , so Mona ordered him upstairs to the Best 's living room to rest . This caused a massive quarrel with the rest of the group when Mona came to pay them , as they wanted Brown 's money to be shared amongst the three of them , as Brown had not played . Mona refused , so The Quarrymen angrily cancelled their residency and stormed out . Colin Manley from The Remo Four was also given a booking to play in the club , which was the only venue that young amateur bands could play at the time . Other groups like The Searchers and Gerry & The Pacemakers later played in the club . The Black Jacks became the resident group at The Casbah , although The Quarrymen occasionally played there again and often visited . It was in The Casbah Club that Lennon and McCartney convinced Sutcliffe to buy a Hofner president bass guitar and join The Quarrymen . 
 Even though the membership list later spiralled to over a thousand , Mona closed the club on 24 June 1962 , with The Beatles as the last group to perform . In 2006 , the Best 's ex @-@ coal cellar was given a " Grade II listed building status " , after being recommended by English Heritage . It has now been opened as a tourist attraction in Liverpool , along with McCartney and Lennon 's previous homes . 
 = = = The Beatles = = = 
 When her son became a member of The Beatles , Mona repeatedly tried to get the group a lunchtime residency at The Cavern Club by talking to the owner , Ray McFall , but was turned down , as The Cavern had a jazz @-@ only policy at the time . Brian Epstein later wanted to manage the group , and Mona was asked for her advice , and although she had her own plans for the group , she concluded that Epstein would be good for them over time . After The Beatles signed a management contract with Epstein , Mona did not relinquish her control over them , as they had been using her telephone to call agents , and frequently slept over in her living room between concerts . She constantly harassed Epstein about the quality of their bookings , and his management of them , which led to Epstein never referring to her by name , but always calling her " that woman " . One musician commented that if Mona said it was a Sunday when it was Tuesday , one would be forced to agree with her . 
 After Best , McCartney and Harrison were deported from Hamburg in November 1960 , Mona made numerous phone calls to Hamburg to recover the group 's equipment , which she eventually managed to do . Mona wrote to Granada Television in 1961 , in an attempt to get the group a television appearance on the programme called " People And Places " , but was sent a letter telling her that they would contact her in the future . After her son had been dismissed from The Beatles on 16 August 1962 , Mona was later quoted by biographer Hunter Davies as saying :

 In 1967 , when The Beatles had to pose for the photograph for the Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band cover , Lennon asked Mona if he could borrow the war medals her father had been given in India to wear for the photo session . Although still upset at the way her son was dismissed from The Beatles , Mona agreed , and the medals were then returned , along with a Cash Box trophy that is in the letter ' L ' of THE <unk> flower @-@ sign on the cover . Mona never opened another club , or engaged in another business venture , although she did have paying guests at her house , which she shared with her bed @-@ ridden mother and her sons after she and Best parted . Mona died of a heart attack on 9 October 1988 , after a long illness . 
 = Old Jeffersonville Historic District = 
 The Old Jeffersonville Historic District is located in Jeffersonville , Indiana , United States . It marks the original boundaries of Jeffersonville , and is the heart of modern @-@ day downtown Jeffersonville . It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 . The area is roughly bounded by Court Avenue at the North , Graham Street on the east , the Ohio River at the south , and Interstate 65 at the west . In total , the district has 203 acres ( 0 @.@ 8 km ² ) , 500 buildings , 6 structures , and 11 objects . Several banks are located in the historic buildings in the district . The now defunct Steamboat Days Festival , held on the second weekend in September , used to be held on Spring Street and the waterfront . Jeffersonville 's largest fire wiped out a block in the historic district on January 11 , 2004 which destroyed the original Horner 's Novelty store . 
 Several important buildings are located in the district . At Warder Park the old Carnegie Library still stands , one of many built throughout Indiana in the early 20th Century . Across Spring Street from Warder Park is the Old Masonic Temple , built in the early 20th Century , with a majestic marble staircase . The local office of the Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana maintains the historic <unk> House , its former office , and the Willey @-@ <unk> House , its current office , which are located beside each other . <unk> 's Confectionery is well known its candies , especially its red @-@ hots and <unk> ( a caramel @-@ covered marshmallow confection ) . Horner 's Novelty , a long @-@ time commercial supplier of party supplies and costumes that was rebuilt after a fire , is also included in the landmark boundaries . 
 = = History = = 
 The first settlement in what later became Jeffersonville was just above the Falls of the Ohio , the only natural barrier along the entire length of the Ohio River . Because of its location above the falls , Jeffersonville has the deepest harbor of any nearby town . The settlement was established in 1786 at Finney , near the present day Big Four Bridge . In June 1802 , Lieutenant Isaac Bowman had 150 acres ( 0 @.@ 61 km2 ) of land , known as Section No. 1 , awarded to him for his service in the American Revolutionary War as part of Clark 's Grant . 
 Jeffersonville started as three streets that paralleled the Ohio River : Water Street ( gone ) , Front Street ( Riverside Drive ) and Market Street . In 1802 John <unk> was appointed to plat the land north of Market Street using a plan devised by Thomas Jefferson . This plan deviated from Jefferson 's original with the use of diagonal streets in the open checkerboard . By 1816 this plan proved to be unworkable and was re @-@ platted by order of the Indiana Legislature ( An Act to Change the Plan of the Town of Jeffersonville ) in 1817 . In 1836 a Cincinnati civil engineer ( H. L. Barnum ) was hired to plot the northern expansion of the town . This plan was again an attempt to use Jefferson 's original . The plan was rejected by the town council and another plan from a local civil engineer ( Edmund F. Lee ) was accepted . At the time Cincinnati was the major town in the area and subsequent map makers used the Barnum map as their primary source . Consequently , most maps of Jeffersonville from 1837 to about 1852 are in error . 
 From its heyday of the 1850s until the Great Depression in the 1930s , Jeffersonville was the leading center of U.S. steamboat production , due largely to its excellent harbor , which remained the deepest in the surrounding area . Many individuals who lived in the district worked at the Howard Shipyards , that became <unk> in the nearby town of Port Fulton , which was eventually annexed into Jeffersonville . The town gained its first railroad in 1852 , connecting to Columbus , Indiana , and with the opening of the Fourteenth Street Bridge in 1870 , became a railroad center . The city became an important distribution center during the Civil War for the Union Army , because three railroads connected to Jeffersonville and because the Ohio River served as a defensive barrier against invasion from Confederate attack , it was deemed a safer location than the more vulnerable city of Louisville , Kentucky located on the southern side of the river . 
 Most of the buildings still standing in the district were built after 1870 . The majority of the commercial buildings along Spring Street are Italianate styles and Gothic Revival churches reflecting the large immigrations from Ireland and Germany that came during the time period . The residential buildings are generally of the American Four Square style , bungalows , and shotgun houses . 
 Until the mid @-@ 1950s , the district was a significant commercial area , including a <unk> department store . However , with the construction of Youngstown Shopping Center 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) northwest of the downtown area on 10th Street / Indiana State Road 62 , the district began its decline . The decline was completed when Green Tree Mall was built in the 1960s , taking Penney 's with it . By the 1980s over twenty store fronts were empty , leaving the bulk of the stores in the district occupied by antique shops , thrift stores , or repair technicians . 
 = = Streets = = 
 The district is served by a northwest / southeast primary road called Spring Street . From Spring Street are five secondary streets going southwest to northeast ; starting from the Ohio River and going the north the secondary streets are Riverside Drive , Market Street , Chestnut Street , Maple Street , and ending with Court Avenue . 
 Spring Street , a typical commercial 19th century corridor , is the primary roadway within the district . Most buildings along Spring Street are Italianate and eclectic Victorian . The structure vary between two and three stories tall , with brick as the most common building material . The 100 block is the closest to the Ohio River and has seen the most demolition . It contains the Old Strauss Hotel at the corner of Riverside Drive , a three @-@ story Italianate hostelry with a corbeled cornice and arched windows . The buildings on the 200 block are mostly Italianate style buildings , the most notable being the old Elk 's Club structure ( a three @-@ story highly decorated glazed brick building ) and the Bensinger 's Building ( a 1920s commercial building of pressed brick and crenelated parapet ) . There is more diverse architecture on the 300 @-@ block , with a 19th @-@ century Masonic Temple , the LaRose Theatre ( a 1920s orange glazed brick structure with terra cotta trim ) , Horner 's Novelty ( which had to be rebuilt after the worst fire in Jeffersonville 's history ) , and <unk> 's Confectionery , a candy store that opened in 1891 that now also features a small candy museum . More Italianate structures are on the 400 block , but its most important structure is the 1907 Citizens National Bank Building , which is stone Classical Revival with large eagles for adornment . The block also holds the regional office for the local Boy Scouts of America council . Warder Park is located on the east side of the 500 block and features a Classical Revival Masonic Temple that used for most of the 20th Century . 
 At the southeast end of Spring Street is Riverside Drive , which provides some of the most scenic views of the Ohio River and the eastern Louisville shoreline because of the limited alterations compared to other sections of the Ohio River in the Louisville area . <unk> are docked along the Ohio River on the south side of Riverside Drive . The north side of Riverside Drive has a variety of architectural styles and is mostly residential . Unlike the other prominent streets , Riverside drive is outside the flood @-@ wall that surrounds most of the city and was built two feet higher than the height the Ohio River flood of 1937 . 
 Market Street is largely residential , its 200 block has many vacant areas , but the 300 – 500 blocks features many shotgun houses . As Market Streets proceeds eastward out of the district , it becomes known as Utica Pike near the Howard Steamboat Museum and connects Jeffersonville with Utica , Indiana . North of Market Street , few buildings remain that date before 1850 , making the character of the district during the early time frame unknowable . 
 Chestnut Street is also largely residential . The 200 block of West Chestnut features old supports for the Big Four Bridge and the 100 block of West Chestnut holds the <unk> House , which was separately placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 . On East Chestnut , the 100 block contains many houses built around 1900 and the 200 block is filled with bungalows . St. Augustine Roman Catholic Church , a Spanish @-@ flavored neo @-@ Baroque structure with a Moorish @-@ styled rectory , is located on the 300 block of East Chestnut . Another church is located on the 400 block including the Gothic Revival style First Presbyterian Church ( with lancet windows and belltower ) , and a typical Works Progress Administration Art Modern school whose cruciform plan has a stuccoed facade and metal casement windows . 
 Maple Street features more commercial enterprises than the previous southwest / northeast streets . The 100 block of West Maple Street is dominated by parking lots and a funeral home . The Olde Towne Grocery , originally built in the 1920s as a Krogers and later an A & P , and a collectibles store named <unk> 's are located across from each other on the 100 block of East Maple . The 200 block of East Maple Street is mostly residential , with four large Victorian homes and a large office building used by the Indiana Bell Telephone Company . The 300 – 800 blocks of East Maple are residential and are mostly American Four @-@ Square in construction . The blocks also contain a few Gothic @-@ Revival churches , 
 The northernmost street is Court Avenue , sections of which are part of the historic district and others , having seen new construction , are not part of the district ; only the 100 West , 100 East , and 700 – 900 East Blocks of Court Avenue are in the district . This allows for Warder Park and eastern residential areas , but not the current Jeffersonville Township Public Library and the Clark County Courthouse . This was the site of the Falls City Area Center , a community college that eventually moved to New Albany and became Indiana University Southeast . Warder Park was also the site of an important Civil War bakery , which furnished hardtack for thousands of Union soldiers .

 = William Monroe Trotter = 
 William Monroe Trotter ( sometimes just Monroe Trotter , April 7 , 1872 – April 7 , 1934 ) was a newspaper editor and real estate businessman based in Boston , Massachusetts , and an activist for African @-@ American civil rights . He was an early opponent of the accommodationist race policies of Booker T. Washington , and in 1901 founded the Boston Guardian , an independent African @-@ American newspaper , as a vehicle to express that opposition . Active in protest movements for civil rights throughout the 1900s and 1910s , he also revealed some of the differences within the African @-@ American community . He contributed to the formation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) . 
 Born into a well @-@ to @-@ do family and raised in Hyde Park , Massachusetts , Trotter earned his undergraduate and graduate degrees at Harvard University , and was the first man of color to earn a Phi Beta Kappa key there . Seeing an increase in segregation in northern facilities , he began to engage in a life of activism , to which he devoted his assets . He joined with W.E.B. DuBois in founding the Niagara Movement in 1905 , a forerunner of the NAACP . Trotter 's style was often divisive , and he ended up leaving that organization and founding the National Equal Rights League . His protest activities were sometimes seen to be at cross purposes to those of the NAACP . 
 In 1914 he had a highly publicized meeting with President Woodrow Wilson , in which he protested Wilson 's introduction of segregation into the federal workplace . In Boston , Trotter succeeded in 1910 in shutting down productions of The Clansman but he was unsuccessful in 1915 with screenings of the movie Birth of a Nation , which also portrayed the Ku Klux Klan in favorable terms . He was not able to influence the peace talks at the end of World War I , and was in later years a marginalized voice of protest . In an alliance with Roman Catholics , in 1921 he did get a revival screening banned of Birth of a Nation . He died on his 62nd birthday after a possibly suicidal fall from his Boston home . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 William was the third child , and first to survive infancy , of James Monroe Trotter and Virginia ( Isaacs ) Trotter . His father James was born into slavery in Mississippi ; James ' mother Letitia was enslaved , and his father was her white master Richard S. Trotter . Letitia , her son and two daughters were freed by their master after his marriage and sent to Cincinnati , Ohio , which had a thriving free black community . After working as a teacher , James Trotter enlisted in the United States Colored Troops during the American Civil War , and was the first man of color to be promoted to lieutenant in the 55th Regiment of the Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry ( Colored ) . 
 Virginia Isaacs , also of mixed race , was born free in 1842 in either Ohio or Virginia . Her mother Ann @-@ Elizabeth Fossett was born into slavery at Monticello , where she was a daughter of Joseph Fossett and Edith Hern Fossett , and granddaughter of Elizabeth Hemings . Virginia 's father Tucker Isaacs was free . Tucker Isaacs , a free person of color , purchased the freedom of Ann @-@ Elizabeth Fossett , Virginia 's mother . The family moved to Chillicothe in the free state of Ohio , where Virginia grew up in its thriving black community . There she met and married James Trotter . 
 Shortly after the Civil War , the Trotters moved from Ohio to settle in Boston , Massachusetts . After their first two children died in infancy , they returned to the Isaacs farm of Virginia 's parents , where their son William Monroe Trotter was born on April 7 , 1872 . When he was seven months old , the family moved back to Boston , where they settled in the South End , far from the predominantly African @-@ American west side of Beacon Hill . The family later moved to suburban Hyde Park , a white neighborhood . The Trotters had two more children , both daughters . 
 Trotter 's father broke through many racial obstacles placed before him , but was often frustrated in his attempts to gain equal treatment or fair consideration . While serving in the Union Army , he protested the inequality of pay between blacks and whites . In Boston he was the first man of color to be employed by the Post Office Department ( now the U.S. Postal Service ) , a job he left after he was repeatedly passed over for promotion because of discriminatory Republican @-@ led federal government policy . Politically active , the elder Trotter was a leading African @-@ American Democrat in New England . He supported Grover Cleveland for President , and was rewarded in 1886 when Cleveland appointed him Recorder of Deeds for the District of Columbia , the highest federal position filled by black men at the time . Two other prominent men of color of that era , Fredrick Douglass and Senator Blanche Kelso Bruce , also held the post . The job was a lucrative one , and the Trotter family prospered . 
 The young Trotter ( who was usually called by his middle name " Monroe " ) grew up in this environment , and was introduced to Archibald Grimké , another politically active African American who also lived in Hyde Park . He excelled in school , graduating from the otherwise all @-@ white Hyde Park High School as valedictorian and president of his high school class . He went on to Harvard University , where he continued to distinguish himself academically . He was awarded merit scholarships after his father died , and was the first man of color to be awarded a Phi Beta Kappa key at Harvard . He earned a bachelor 's degree magna cum laude in 1895 and a Masters in 1896 , working a variety of odd jobs to help pay his tuition . 
 During his years at Harvard , he adopted a number of habits which he maintained for much of his life . He organized and led the Total Abstinence League , a temperance organization ; he was a teetotaler and never drank alcohol . He was active in the Baptist church , in which he had considered becoming a minister .

 Following his graduation , Trotter participated in the upper echelons of Negro society in Boston , a number of whose members had ancestors free before the Civil War . He belonged to an exclusive literary society that met at the home of Cambridge educator Maria Baldwin . On June 27 , 1899 , Trotter married Geraldine Louise ( " <unk> " ) Pindell ( October 3 , 1872 – October 8 , 1918 ) , who was from another activist family . He had known her since childhood . She assisted him throughout his career until her death in the 1918 flu pandemic . The couple had no children . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Trotter 's career began inauspiciously . His initial attempts to get jobs at established banking and real estate firms were unsuccessful , leading him through a succession of lower @-@ paying clerking jobs . He finally landed a job in a white @-@ owned real estate firm in 1898 , but decided the next year to open his own business selling insurance and brokering mortgages . He was not particularly active in agitating for civil rights in these years , although his strong opinions on racial equality were evident in an 1899 paper in which he called on African Americans to seek admission to institutions of higher learning . ( It was a common practice of the time to direct African Americans away from higher education opportunities and into industrial training programs . ) Trotter 's business was relatively successful , and he was able to purchase investment properties . 
 Trotter was increasingly troubled by what he saw as the accommodationist policies of Booker T. Washington , one of the leading African @-@ American figures of the 1890s and founder of the Tuskegee Institute . Washington 's policies were enshrined in the Atlanta Compromise , outlined in an 1895 speech he gave in Atlanta , Georgia . He said that Southern African Americans should not agitate for political rights ( such as the right to vote and equal treatment under the law ) as long as they were provided economic opportunities and basic rights of due process . Washington actively promoted the idea that African Americans , once they had proven themselves as productive members of society , would be granted full political rights . Trotter , Grimké , W. E. B. Du Bois , and other northern radicals disagreed with these ideas , arguing that it was necessary for African Americans to agitate for equal treatment and full constitutional rights , because doing so would bring other benefits . By the turn of the century , African Americans in the South had been effectively disfranchised by violence around elections , and restrictions in voting registration rules , and , finally , constitutional amendments or new constitutions in southern states . 
 Although Boston was comparatively congenial when compared to other parts of the country , Trotter and others felt that Washington 's stance was leading to an increase in more typically Southern racist attitudes in the city . " The conviction grew upon me " , he wrote , that his business successes could be endangered " if race prejudice and persecution and public discrimination from mere color was to spread up from the South and result in a fixed caste of color " .

 Trotter 's racial activism blossomed in 1901 . He helped found the Boston Literary and Historical Association , which became , according to biographer Stephen Fox , " a forum for militant race opinion " . He also joined the Massachusetts Racial Protective Association , another local group that promoted political goals of equality . Under the aegis of the latter group , Trotter in October 1901 gave his first major protest speech , attacking Washington 's accommodationist stance : " In Boston [ Washington ] said that the Negro should wait for the franchise until he had got property , education and character . Washington 's attitude has ever been one of servility . " 
 With George Forbes , another Protective Association member , in 1901 Trotter co @-@ founded the Guardian , a weekly newspaper . At first Forbes , an Amherst College graduate with some experience in publishing , was the driving operational force in its production , while Trotter funded the effort and served as its managing editor . The paper became a forum for a more outspoken and forceful approach to gaining racial equality , and its contributors and editorials ( which were generally written by Trotter ) regularly attacked Washington . The paper 's editorial stance brought a stream of criticism from more mainstream African @-@ American publications : the New York Age , calling it " <unk> " , wrote that " Editor Trotter ... makes himself smelt if not felt " ; another wrote that the Guardian was " carrying its cases too fast and too far " , and that Trotter suffered from a " mental malady " . The Guardian had limited circulation , but was highly influential as one of only 200 African @-@ American publications in the country . It suffered financially due to Trotter 's poor accounting and inattention due to his heavy schedule . Forbes , who principally worked as a librarian in the city library , left the business in 1904 because of Booker T. Washington 's legal assaults on the newspaper and pressure by Washington supporters on his employers . Trotter 's wife , and later his sister , assisted in the paper 's publication . 
 Trotter , in a deliberate move , transferred the Guardian 's offices in 1907 to the same building that had once housed William Lloyd Garrison 's Liberator . Trotter idolized Garrison , a leading abolitionist agitator before the Civil War , and had studied his methods . He was a regular correspondent with Garrison 's sons William , Jr. and Francis Garrison . 
 The Guardian was always unprofitable , a condition that was exacerbated by Trotter 's refusal to take advertising for alcohol and tobacco . He sold off all of his Boston @-@ area properties by 1910 to raise funds for the newspaper , and he was lax in collecting payments from his subscribers . In his later years , the quality of the publication noticeably declined , and its operations were propped up by a local community group 's fund @-@ raising activities . 
 = = Attacking the African @-@ American establishment = = 
 In the early 1900s Trotter noticed that racial segregation was spreading in Boston : the number of hotels , restaurants , and other public establishments refusing service to African Americans was increasing . He came to realize that , in order to effect real change , the radical message needed to be taken out of Boston , and began organizing protest meetings across New England in 1903 . At the suggestion of Trotter , William H. Ferris went to Washington D.C. in January 1903 . Ferris gave a presentation critical to Booker T. Washington in front of the Bethel Literary and Historical Society on January 6 , 1903 . Richard W. Thompson gave spoke in support of Washington as replies at the Second Baptist Lyceum on January 25 and Jesse Lawson did the same on February 3 . In 1999 , Jacqueline M. Moore argued that Thompson 's paper failed to hold his ground against Ferris , who was present at the talk . 
 His long @-@ term objective was to effect policy changes in the National Afro @-@ American Council , then the only national @-@ level organization of African Americans . At the group 's annual meeting in Louisville , Kentucky , Trotter and others introduced resolutions calling for more activism , but Booker T. Washington supporters ( also known as " Bookerites " ) , who controlled the council , saw to their defeat . One commentator wrote that the " Boston idiots " had been treated " in delightful fashion " . The Guardian described the convention as " dominated to death by one man " . The activities of the radicals at the convention did bring them some national press . Trotter continued to criticize Washington in the Guardian ; his attacks were particularly harsh and personal , and brought a bitter tinge to the disagreement . 
 In this period , while the Great Migration of African Americans out of the South to the North was beginning , blacks in the two regions dealt with different conditions . The vast majority of the millions of African Americans still lived in the South , many in rural areas where they were the majority population . But they were effectively disfranchised by new electoral rules and state constitutions , utterly closed out of the political process . This situation would continue , despite some temporarily effective court challenges , through the 1960s . Washington believed he had to help this population within the constraints of their environment . At the same time , he secretly funded legal challenges against the voter registration and electoral restrictions . Trotter and other radicals tended to come from the North , where African Americans exercised more rights in daily life , including the suffrage , were more urbanized , and had achieved more in work and education , but were still subject to discrimination . 
 Following their failure to advance the radical agenda in Louisville , Trotter and the other radicals sought a more sympathetic forum in which to attack Booker T. Washington . An opportunity arrived when Washington was set to speak in Boston in July 1903 . When the Tuskegee Institute leader was introduced to a visibly hostile crowd , a small riot broke out . Trotter , who had arrived prepared with several provocative questions to ask Washington , attempted to read them over the din of the melee . He was among the arrested , and the " Boston riot " received national press coverage . Trotter later claimed that there was no plan to break up the meeting . Bookerites pressed charges against Trotter for disrupting the meeting ; defended by Archibald Grimké , Trotter was convicted and spent thirty days in the Charles Street Jail . Although the Bookerites had hoped to discredit the radicals with the trial , they gained them wider publicity . After the trial , Trotter founded the Boston Suffrage League ( 1903 ) , and when a New England Suffrage League was founded in 1904 , Trotter was elected president . 
 Washington countered Trotter 's attacks with a variety of tactics . He took various legal actions against Trotter , including at least one libel suit and criminal charges . In addition , he used his network to apply pressure to Trotter 's supporters in their workplaces ( in some cases government and academic positions ) . In addition , he had other sympathizers secretly infiltrate and report on activist meetings organized by Trotter and others . Washington also provided financial support and expertise to start other publications in Boston to counter Trotter 's radical voice . As a result of such activities , Trotter 's printer dropped the activist and his newspaper as a client . But Trotter found another printer and continued publishing the Guardian despite the setback . 
 = = Niagara Movement and the NAACP = = 
 In the early months of 1905 , Booker T. Washington sought to create an umbrella organization to represent all the major African @-@ American leaders of the day . Du Bois and Grimké were the two most radical leaders invited to its early organizational meetings , but both eventually refused to ally with Washington , whom they saw as dominating the group . Du Bois , Trotter , and two others organized a meeting of radicals from across the nation in western New York . Meeting in July just across the Canadian border in Fort Erie , Ontario they founded the Niagara Movement . Organized so that no one man could dominate it , the group espoused a radical declaration of principles ( authored by Trotter and Du Bois ) , calling for agitation for equal economic opportunity and exercise of full civil rights for African Americans . The organization was soon divided internally by political and personal disagreements , and Washington worked from outside against its growth . 
 During the early months of 1906 , friction began to develop between Du Bois and Trotter over the admission of women to the organization . Du Bois supported the idea , and Trotter opposed it , but eventually relented . The matter was smoothed over during the 1906 meeting . Their division became more significant when Trotter split with Clement Morgan , a longtime supporter and Movement member , over Massachusetts politics and control of the local Movement chapter . Du Bois sided with Morgan and , when the Movement met in Boston in 1907 , he reappointed Morgan to a leading position in the organization . Attempts to heal the rift failed , and Trotter resigned from the Movement . Because of these difficulties , the organization had effectively collapsed by 1908 . The break between Trotter and Du Bois was permanent , and they never worked directly together again . Du Bois wrote in 1909 that it was " utterly impossible to work with Mr. Trotter . " 
 Despite the Niagara Movement 's failure , its goals had appealed to white supporters of racial equality . They participated in the founding of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) , which drew an inter @-@ racial coalition of support . Trotter and Du Bois were both present at meetings in 1909 in which its foundation was laid . Although some of Trotter 's proposals were accepted ( to address segregated transportation as a grievance ) , others were not ( such as his proposal for a bill to make lynching a federal crime ) . Trotter was not invited to be on the organization 's executive committee ; neither was Booker T. Washington , who boycotted the effort . 
 Trotter never played a significant role in the NAACP , and in its early years actively competed with it . In 1911 Trotter 's group and the NAACP both held rallies in Boston to mark the centennial of abolitionist Charles Sumner 's birth . Trotter was peripherally involved with the NAACP for a few years , but he did not approve of the amount of white involvement in the interracial group . His feud with Du Bois ran deep , so he rarely contributed to the organization at the national level . He was also troubled by the attitudes expressed in the Boston chapter , which he told NAACP leader Joel Spingarn needed more " radical , courageous activity . " He eventually drifted away from the NAACP . 
 = = National Equal Rights League = = 
 After Trotter split from the Niagara Movement , he helped organize a conference of like @-@ minded activists held in Philadelphia in April 1908 , and served as the conference chair . In this capacity , he excluded any attendees whose racial ideology he opposed , as well as those who supported Republican William Howard Taft in the upcoming presidential election . ( Trotter opposed Taft because he had tired of what he considered the Republican Party laissez @-@ faire policies on race . ) This conference led to the formation of the Negro @-@ American Political League , which eventually became known as the National Equal Rights League ( NERL ) . Trotter described this group as " of the colored people and for the colored people and led by the colored people . " 
 NERL , which biographer Fox describes as Trotter 's " personal fief " , was unable to attract high @-@ profile membership as the NAACP did . Trotter did not want white members , and was unable to work effectively with other African @-@ American leaders . NERL and the NAACP , while both working toward similar goals , regularly feuded over matters public and personal . 
 As the NAACP attracted more money and talent , and became the center of anti @-@ <unk> civil rights activity , Trotter and the NERL became increasingly marginalized on the left . Trotter would not have as prominent a role in the civil rights dialogue again . By 1921 the League had been reduced to a handful of Trotter supporters . 
 = = Trotter and Woodrow Wilson = = 
 Trotter 's opposition to Booker T. Washington placed him at odds with Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft , Republican presidents who relied on Washington as an adviser and otherwise enjoyed widespread African @-@ American support . Trotter supported the southern Democrat Woodrow Wilson in the 1912 election . Wilson , in a brief meeting with Trotter and other NERL members , made vague statements about fair treatment of African Americans . But , he succumbed to pressure from Southerners in his cabinet and agreed to segregate federal offices . The NAACP and NERL ( then known as the National Independent Political League , or <unk> ) protested , and Trotter secured a meeting with Wilson at the White House in November 1913 . Wilson said that his policies were not segregationist , but Trotter characterized Wilson 's denial as " preposterous " . 
 Trotter continued his protests , eventually gaining a second invitation to the White House in November 1914 . This meeting with Wilson ended with a heated exchange between the two men . Wilson claimed to be dealing with a " human problem " from which politics should be left out , and suggested to Trotter 's group that they could always vote for someone else in the next election . Trotter continued to argue that the segregationist policy was humiliating to African Americans . Wilson responded , " If you take it as a humiliation , which it is not intended as , and sow the seed of that impression all over the country , why the consequences will be very serious . " After Trotter said this was an insult , Wilson angrily ordered him to leave , saying " If this organization wishes to approach me again , it must choose another spokesman ... your tone , sir , offends me . " 
 Trotter 's second meeting with the President was widely covered in the press , featured on the front page of the New York Times and other leading newspapers . A white Texas newspaper described Trotter as " merely a nigger " and " not a Booker T. Washington type of colored man " , and northern papers also criticized him for his " insolence " to the president . The Boston Evening Transcript , while observing that Wilson 's policy was segregationist and divisive , pointed out that although Trotter was basically correct , he " offends many of his own color by his ... untactful belligerency " . African Americans were divided in their response to the incident : some claimed that he did not represent them , while others , notably Du Bois , grudgingly admired Trotter 's audacity . Du Bois wrote that Wilson was " insulting & condescending " in the meeting . Trotter parlayed the publicity into a series of speaking engagements , in which he denied " that in language , manner , tone , in any respect or to the slightest degree I was impudent , insolent , or insulting to the President . " 
 Trotter continued to protest segregationist policies of the Wilson administration . When the country began large @-@ scale recruiting for the military in World War I , Trotter opposed the establishment of segregated officer training facilities . Through his influence , recruitment of blacks in the Boston area was lower than expected . During World War II , the military integrated the officer corps , and President Harry Truman afterward completed integration of the armed services . 
 When the Great War ended , Trotter sought to use the 1919 Paris Peace Conference as a vehicle to raise international awareness of US government policy toward African Americans . He viewed the reality of segregation as incompatible with Wilson 's war vision to " make the world safe for Democracy . " Trotter organized a meeting in Washington , DC related to the peace conference ; he and ten other African @-@ American delegates were chosen to attend the peace conference . The State Department refused to issue passports to those delegates , or to African Americans planning to attend a Pan @-@ African Congress that Du Bois was organizing to be held concurrently with the peace conference in Paris . Du Bois and other African Americans were supporting African colonies ' desire for independence . 
 To get to Europe , Trotter posed as a seaman seeking work in New York , and got a job as a cook on the SS Yarmouth to gain passage to France . He arrived in Paris alone and with little more than his cook 's clothing , only to find that the principal peace negotiations had already taken place . The powers did not include any statement of racial equality . Trotter attracted the French press in his accounts of racial mistreatment in the United States , but he could not gain access to any of the official delegations to the peace conference . He also missed Du Bois ' Pan @-@ African Congress , which was held in February 1919 while he was still seeking passage . 
 Trotter returned to the United States in July 1919 to learn of ongoing race riots at major cities across the country . Postwar economic and social tensions had erupted , and blacks fought back against white violence in cities such as Chicago and Omaha . Trotter quickly supported active resistance to white @-@ on @-@ black violence , writing , " Unless the white American behaves , he will find that in teaching our boys to fight for him he was starting something that he will not be able to stop . " His writings prompted calls in Congress for the censorship of the Negro press : South Carolina Congressman James F. Byrnes accused Trotter of " doing his utmost to incite riots and bloodshed . " Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge gave Trotter a chance to testify during Senate deliberations on ratification of the Treaty of Versailles , which Lodge opposed on grounds other than Trotter 's . Lodge 's opposition was successful : the Senate never ratified the treaty . 
 = = Other protests and later years = = 
 Trotter mounted a campaign against Thomas Dixon 's play The Clansman when it opened in Boston in 1910 , which portrayed the Ku Klux Klan in heroic terms during Reconstruction . His protests succeeded in closing the production . While on his speaking tour in early 1915 , he learned that D. W. Griffith 's movie , The Birth of a Nation , adapted from The Clansman , would be opening in Boston . He rushed back to lead protests against the film . In April , the Tremont Theatre denied Trotter and a group of African Americans tickets to the showing . When they refused to leave the lobby , plainclothes police moved in , sparking a scuffle . Trotter and ten others were arrested ; other protests took place both inside and outside the theater . Trotter , united with other factions of the African @-@ American community , tried but could not get the film banned in Boston . This united front , along with the death later in 1915 of Booker T. Washington , reduced for a time the internal hostilities in the Boston African @-@ American community . 
 The KKK had a revival for a decade after 1915 , especially in industrial cities and the Midwest . In 1921 , Trotter was successful in shutting down new screenings of Birth of a Nation in Boston ; he allied with Roman Catholic organizations , who objected to the KKK 's anti @-@ Catholic stance of the 20th century , and were strong in the city as a result of extensive Irish and Italian immigration . 
 Trotter 's wife had died in the 1918 influenza pandemic . She had been a partner in all his activities and he missed her greatly . 
 Through the 1920s and 1930s , Trotter subsided into a genteel poverty , using the Guardian as an ongoing voice of protest . He lobbied for anti @-@ lynching bills in Congress , with limited success . Even when the House overwhelmingly passed such a bill in 1922 , the Southern bloc in the Senate filibustered and effectively killed passage of the bill for three years running . ( White Democrats effectively controlled nearly all the Congressional seats apportioned to the total population of the South , after having disfranchised blacks . ) They controlled chairmanships of numerous important committees , which were established by seniority . 
 In 1923 Trotter eventually came to an uneasy truce with the NAACP . His attempts to promote his style of activism , however , were eclipsed by activities of younger leaders , such as Marcus Garvey , a Jamaican immigrant in New York City and leader of the UNIA . 
 Through these years , Trotter routinely wrote in the Guardian about incidents of racial injustice , including the 1931 trials of the Scottsboro boys . They had been accused and were convicted of raping two white women in Alabama . Historians have concluded they were innocent . 
 On the morning of April 7 , 1934 , his 62nd birthday , William Monroe Trotter died after a fall from the roof of his home in Boston . The cause is uncertain , but it is known that he was depressed and troubled at the time . He may have committed suicide .

 Several schools and academic institutions were named for him : the William Monroe Trotter Elementary School in Dorchester , the William Monroe Trotter Institute at the University of Massachusetts Boston ( a research institute for the study of black history and black culture ) , and the William Monroe Trotter Multicultural Center ( aka Trotter House ) at the University of Michigan . 
 Trotter 's first home in Dorchester , the William Monroe Trotter House , was designated a National Historic Landmark in recognition of his significance in the civil rights cause . 
 In 2002 , scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed William Monroe Trotter among his 100 Greatest African Americans . 
 = Three Beauties of the Present Day = 
 Three Beauties of the Present Day ( <unk> , Tōji San Bijin ) is a nishiki @-@ e colour woodblock print from c . 1792 – 93 by Japanese ukiyo @-@ e artist Kitagawa Utamaro ( c . 1753 – 1806 ) . The triangular composition depicts the busts of three celebrity beauties of the time : geisha Tomimoto Toyohina , and teahouse waitresses Naniwa Kita and Takashima Hisa . The print is also known under the titles Three Beauties of the Kansei Era ( <unk> , Kansei San Bijin ) and Three Famous Beauties ( <unk> , Kōmei San Bijin ) . 
 Utamaro was the leading ukiyo @-@ e artist in the 1790s in the bijin @-@ ga genre of pictures of female beauties . He was known for his ōkubi @-@ e , which focus on the heads . The three models in Three Beauties of the Present Day were frequent subjects of Utamaro 's portraiture . Each figure in the work is adorned with an identifying family crest . The portraits are idealized , and at first glance their faces seem similar , but subtle differences in their features and expressions can be detected — a level of realism at the time unusual in ukiyo @-@ e , and a contrast with the stereotyped beauties in earlier masters such as Harunobu and Kiyonaga . The luxurious print was published by Tsutaya Jūzaburō and made with multiple woodblocks — one for each colour — and the background was dusted with muscovite to produce a glimmering effect . It is believed to have been quite popular , and the triangular positioning became a vogue in the 1790s . Utamaro produced several other pictures with the same arrangement of the same three beauties , and all three appeared in numerous other portraits by Utamaro and other artists . 
 = = Background = = 
 Ukiyo @-@ e art flourished in Japan during the Edo period from the 17th to 19th centuries , and took as its primary subjects courtesans , kabuki actors , and others associated with the " floating world " lifestyle of the pleasure districts . Alongside paintings , mass @-@ produced woodblock prints were a major form of the genre . In the mid @-@ 18th century full @-@ colour nishiki @-@ e prints became common , printed using a large number of woodblocks , one for each colour . Towards the close of the 18th century there was a peak in both the quality and quantity of work . A prominent genre was bijin @-@ ga , or " pictures of beauties " , which depicted most often courtesans and geisha at leisure , and promoted the entertainments to be found in the pleasure districts . 
 Katsukawa <unk> introduced the ōkubi @-@ e " large @-@ headed picture " in the 1760s ; he and other members of the Katsukawa school such as <unk> popularized the form for yakusha @-@ e actor prints , as well as the dusting of mica in the backgrounds to produce a glittering effect . Kiyonaga was the pre @-@ eminent portraitist of beauties in the 1780s , and the tall , graceful beauties in his work had a great influence on Kitagawa Utamaro ( c . 1753 – 1806 ) , who was to succeed him in fame . Utamaro studied under Toriyama Sekien ( 1712 – 1788 ) , who had trained in the Kanō school of painting . Around 1782 , Utamaro came to work for the publisher Tsutaya Jūzaburō . 
 In 1791 , Tsutaya published three books by <unk> <unk> in the <unk> genre of humorous tales of adventures in the pleasure quarters ; deeming them too frivolous , the military government punished the author with fifty days in manacles and fined the publisher half his property . His luck was reversed shortly after with a new success : Utamaro began producing the first bijin ōkubi @-@ e , adapting ōkubi @-@ e to the bijin @-@ ga genre of portraits of beauties . Their popularity restored Tsutaya 's fortunes and made Utamaro 's in the 1790s . 
 = = Description and analysis = = 
 Considered one of Utamaro 's representative early works , Three Beauties of the Present Day depicts the busts of three celebrity beauties of 1790s Edo ( modern Tokyo ) . Utamaro 's subjects were not courtesans , as was expected in ukiyo @-@ e , but young women known around Edo for their beauty . These three were frequent subjects of Utamaro 's art , and often appeared together . Each is identified by an associated family crest . 
 In the centre is Tomimoto Toyohina , a famed geisha at the <unk> house in the Yoshiwara pleasure district . She was dubbed " Tomimoto " having made her name playing Tomimoto @-@ <unk> music on the shamisen . Like the other two models , she has her hair up in the fashionable Shimada style that was popular at the time . But contrasted with the <unk> teahouse @-@ girl garments of the other two models , she is dressed in the showier geisha style . On the sleeve of her kimono is a Japanese primrose design that was the Tomimoto crest . Toyohina 's birthdate is unknown . 
 To the right is <unk> Kita , also known as " O @-@ Kita " , well @-@ known daughter of the owner of a teahouse in Asakusa near the temple Sensō @-@ ji . She is said to have been fifteen in the portrait , in which she wears a patterned black kimono and holds an uchiwa hand fan printed with her family emblem , a paulownia crest . 
 At left is Takashima Hisa , or " O @-@ Hisa " , from <unk> in Ryōgoku . She was the eldest daughter of Takashima <unk> , the owner of a roadside teahouse at his home called <unk> in which Hisa worked attracting customers . Tradition places her age at sixteen when the portrait was made , and there is a subtly discernible difference in maturity in the faces of the two teahouse girls . She holds a hand towel over her left shoulder and an identifying three @-@ leaved daimyo oak crest adorns her kimono . 
 Crests of the three beauties 
 Rather than attempting to capture a realistic portrayal of the three , Utamaro idealizes their likenesses . To many viewers , the faces in this and other portraits of the time seem little individuated , or perhaps not at all . Others emphasize the subtle differences that distinguish the three in shapes of the mouths , noses , and eyes : Kita has plump cheeks and an innocent expression ; her eyes are almond @-@ shaped , and the bridge of her nose high ; Hisa has a stiffer , proud expression , and the bridge of Hisa 's nose is lower and her eyes rounder than Kita 's ; Toyohina 's features fall in between , and she has an air of being older and more intellectual . 
 The print is a vertical <unk> of 37 @.@ 9 × 24 @.@ 9 centimetres ( 14 @.@ 9 × 9 @.@ 8 in ) , and is a nishiki @-@ e — a full @-@ colour ukiyo @-@ e print made from multiple woodblocks , one for each colour ; the inked blocks are pressed on Japanese handmade paper . To produce a glittering effect the background is dusted with muscovite , a variety of mica . The image falls under the genres of bijin @-@ ga ( " portraits of beauties " ) and ōkubi @-@ e ( " big @-@ headed pictures " ) , the latter a genre Utamaro pioneered and was strongly associated with . 
 The composition of the three figures is triangular , a traditional arrangement Tadashi Kobayashi compares to The Three Vinegar <unk> , in which Confucius , Gautama Buddha , and Laozi symbolize the unity of Confucianism , Buddhism , and Taoism ; similarly , Kobayashi says , Utamaro demonstrates the unity of the three competing celebrity beauties in the print .

 = = Publication and legacy = = 
 The print was designed by Utamaro and published by Tsutaya Jūzaburō in the fourth or fifth year of the Kansei era of the traditional Japanese era divisions ( c . 1792 – 93 ) . Tsutaya 's publisher 's seal is printed on the left above Hisa 's head , and a round censor 's seal appears above it . Utamaro 's signature is printed in the bottom left . 
 Fumito Kondō considered the print revolutionary ; such expressive , individualized faces are not seen in the stereotyped figures in the works of Utamaro 's predecessors such as Harunobu and Kiyonaga , and it was the first time in ukiyo @-@ e history that the beauties were drawn from the general urban population rather than the pleasure quarters . 
 Records indicate Kita was rated highly in teahouse rankings , and that curious fans flooded her father 's teahouse ; it is said this caused her to become arrogant and cease to serve tea unless called for . Hisa appears to have been less popular and ranked lower , though still quite popular — a wealthy merchant offered 1500 ryō for her , but her parents refused and she continued to work at the teahouse . Utamaro took advantage of this rivalry in his art , going as far as to portray the two tearoom beauties in tug @-@ of @-@ war and other competitions , with deities associated with their neighbourhoods supporting them : Buddhist guardian deity Acala was associated with <unk> , and supported Hisa ; Guanyin , the Goddess of Mercy , was associated with the temple Sensō @-@ ji in Asakusa , and supported Kita . 
 The triangular positioning of three figures became something of a vogue in prints of the mid @-@ 1790s . The " Three Beauties of the Kansei Era " normally refer to the three who appear in this print ; on occasion , Utamaro replaced Toyohina with <unk> O @-@ Han . Utamaro placed the three beauties in the same composition three or four years later in a print called Three Beauties . Hisa holds a teacup saucer in her left hand rather than a handkerchief , and Kita holds her fan in both hands . To Eiji Yoshida , the figures in this print lack the personalities that were the charm of the earlier . Yoshida thought less of the further undifferentiated personalities of a later print , Three Beauties Holding Bags of Snacks , published by <unk> . The three again pose in the same composition , but holding bags of snacks . As testimony to their popularity , the three models often appeared in the works of other artists , and Utamaro continued to use them in other prints , individually or in pairs . 
 There are no records of sales figures of ukiyo @-@ e from the era in which the print was made . Determining the popularity of a print requires indirect means , one of which is to compare the differences in surviving copies . For example , the more copies printed , the more the woodblocks wore down , resulting in loss of line clarity and details . Another example is that publishers often made changes to the blocks in later print runs . Researchers use clues such as these to determine whether prints were frequently reprinted — a sign of the print 's popularity . The original printing of Three Beauties of the Present Day had the title in a bookmark @-@ shape in the top right corner with the names of the three beauties to its left . Only two copies of this state are believed to have survived ; they are in the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston , and the Koishikawa Ukiyo @-@ e Art Museum in Tokyo . Later printings lack the title , the names of the beauties , or both , and the position of the publisher 's and censor 's seals varies slightly . The reasons for the changes are subject to speculation , such as that the beauties may have moved away , or their fame may have fallen . Based on clues such as these changes , researchers believe this print was a popular hit for Utamaro and Tsutaya .

 Oliver Rolf Kahn ( German pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ] ; born 15 June 1969 ) is a former German football goalkeeper . He started his career in the Karlsruher SC Junior team in 1975 . Twelve years later , Kahn made his debut match in the professional squad . In 1994 , he was transferred to Bayern Munich for the fee of <unk> million , where he played until the end of his career in 2008 . His commanding presence in goal and aggressive style earned him nicknames such as Der Titan ( [ <unk> ̯ <unk> ] , English : the Titan ) from the press and Vol @-@ <unk> @-@ o ( " volcano " ) from fans . 
 Kahn is one of the most successful German players in recent history , having won eight Bundesliga titles , six DFB @-@ <unk> , the UEFA Cup in 1996 , the UEFA Champions League and the Intercontinental Cup , both achieved in 2001 . Regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time , his individual contributions have earned him a record four consecutive UEFA Best European Goalkeeper awards , as well as three IFFHS World 's Best Goalkeeper awards , and two German Footballer of the Year trophies . At the 2002 FIFA World Cup , Kahn became the only goalkeeper in the tournament 's history to win the Golden Ball . Kahn placed fifth in both the IFFHS Best Goalkeeper of the 21st Century and Best Goalkeeper of the Past 25 Years elections . 
 From 1994 to 2006 , Kahn was part of the German national team , in which he played as a starter after the retirement of Andreas <unk> ; he was an unused member of the squad that won the 1996 UEFA European Championship . In the 2002 FIFA World Cup , the team reached the final . While Germany was several times derided for their poor performance , Kahn 's prowess proved to be the deciding factor in several games until the final , where Germany lost 0 – 2 to Brazil and Kahn made a mistake on Brazil 's first goal . Nevertheless , he was named the tournament 's best player and received the Golden Ball award .

 At the age of six , Kahn joined Karlsruher SC , where his father Rolf had played from 1962 to 1965 . He started as an outfield player before becoming goalkeeper . Kahn was included in the team 's professional squad in the 1987 – 88 season of the first Bundesliga division , at first being the reserve goalkeeper behind Alexander <unk> . On 27 November 1987 , Kahn made his league debut in a 4 – 0 home victory against 1 . FC Köln . However , not until 1990 did manager Winfried Schäfer decide to start him over <unk> . In the following years , Kahn established himself as the team 's starting goalkeeper . He was considered a key player and a motivator in the Karlsruher squad which reached the semi @-@ finals in the 1993 – 94 UEFA Cup . During the round of sixteen the team accomplished a 7 – 0 rout of Valencia at its home field after losing the first match 1 – 3 at the Mestalla Stadium . The game was nicknamed the " Miracle at <unk> " by the German media . The team was defeated by SV Austria Salzburg in the semi @-@ final .

 Kahn 's performance for Karlsruher SC prompted Bayern Munich to express interest in acquiring him . The team signed him as a replacement for Raimond Aumann at the beginning of the 1994 – 95 season , for the at that time record fee of <unk> million ( € 2 @.@ 385 million ) for his position , and was established as Bayern ’ s starting goalkeeper . Although suffering a rupture of his cruciate ligament , which kept him off the field for almost six months , Kahn made his debut match for the German national team two months after his return . Bayern defeated Bordeaux 3 – 1 in the 1996 UEFA Cup Final . In the 1996 – 97 Bundesliga season , Kahn achieved his first German championship with Bayern Munich , the German League Cup , and was named German Goalkeeper of the Year for the second time in his career ( the first in 1994 ) . 
 In 1999 , Bayern Munich reached the 1999 Champions League Final , facing Manchester United at Camp Nou . Although Bayern Munich player Mario Basler scored an early goal in the sixth minute of the game , two goals by Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær in injury time led to United 's victory . The same year , he was named World Goalkeeper of the Year by the International Federation of Football History and Statistics . 
 Kahn was sent off in an incident against Hansa Rostock on 3 March 2001 . With his Bayern Munich team losing 2 – 3 in the final minutes , he sneaked into the area during a corner kick , jumped up , and punched the ball into the opponent ’ s net . He immediately received a red card , which dismissed him from the game . He was named man of the match when he was part of the squad which played the 2001 Champions League title against Valencia . He played an important role in the penalty shoot @-@ out held after the teams remained tied 1 – 1 after extra time , making three saves . He also received the UEFA Fair Play Award for this match , after he walked up to a disappointed Santiago <unk> , the opposition goalkeeper , after the penalty shoot @-@ out and attempted to comfort him . The same year , Bayern Munich won the International Cup at Tokyo 's National Stadium against the Argentine team Boca Juniors . But the team failed to win the UEFA Super Cup a couple of months earlier . 
 By Kahn 's account , injuries , personal problems and a lack of motivation were responsible for his game going into a rapid decline during the 2002 – 03 season . This culminated with Kahn allowing a seemingly soft shot by Roberto Carlos into the net against Real Madrid in the first knockout @-@ round of the 2003 – 04 Champions League season , contributing to the elimination of his team from the competition . The Daily Mail criticized him for his mistake : " Once again on the big occasion Kahn was undone by a Brazilian , just as he was in the 2002 World Cup Final . Only this time it was a Roberto Carlos free @-@ kick which he let slip , not a Rivaldo shot , for a goal as embarrassing as it is potentially catastrophic for Bayern " . Bayern Munich won the next Bundesliga season with Kahn . 
 Prior to a 2006 match against <unk> Bielefeld in Munich , Michael Rensing peppered Kahn with practice shots . One shot hit Kahn squarely in the eye , causing enough swelling and discoloration to keep him from playing . With Rensing in goal , Bayern Munich won the match 2 – 0 . 
 Kahn announced his intention to honor his contract and play through the 2007 – 08 season . As of 2011 , he is the all time clean sheet leader in the history of the Bundesliga , with 197 . On 2 September 2007 , aged 38 , he played his <unk> Bundesliga match , becoming the league 's all @-@ time leader among goalkeepers in matches played . Kahn made his final European appearance for Bayern in a 4 – 0 defeat to Zenit Saint Petersburg in the UEFA cup semi @-@ final on 1 May 2008 . His last Bundesliga game was the 4 – 1 victory against Hertha Berlin on 17 May . It was his 557th appearance in the German top @-@ flight . 
 After a twenty @-@ year career , of which he played fourteen with Bayern , he had his professional farewell in a testimonial match versus the select Germany XI on 2 September 2008 , which ended 1 – 1 . His last appearance for Bayern Munich was on 27 May 2008 at the Salt Lake Stadium ( <unk> <unk> ) , Kolkata in a friendly against Mohun Bagan of India during Bayern 's Asian tour of 2008 . Around 120 @,@ 000 people turned up for the match . The match ended 0 – 3 in favour of Bayern and Michael Rensing substituted him in the 55th minute .

 Kahn was initially called for the German national team as a late back @-@ up for the 1994 FIFA World Cup ; however he made his first international appearance on 23 June 1995 in a 2 – 1 victory against Switzerland , two months after recovering from his cruciate ligament injury . Along with Oliver Reck , Kahn was a reserve keeper of the squad , which won the 1996 UEFA European Football Championship in England . He spent the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France on the bench , and it was not until Andreas <unk> announced his retirement at the end of the tournament that Kahn became the starting goalkeeper . Two years after the 2000 UEFA European Football Championship , in which defending champions Germany made an embarrassing exit in the group stage , Kahn received the squad 's captaincy , succeeding the striker Oliver <unk> . 
 Kahn experienced one of his worst performances in his international career against England in Munich in 2001 . Germany were favored to win as they had beaten England 1 – 0 in 2000 at the Wembley Stadium . However , they were routed 5 – 1 , including a hat @-@ trick by Michael Owen . Despite the defeat , Germany qualified for the World Cup after winning a playoff against Ukraine , and Kahn remained as Germany 's number one for the upcoming Cup . Kahn was named the best goalkeeper in the world by IFFHS for the second time in his career . 
 Despite Germany 's comparatively low expectations when for the 2002 FIFA World Cup , the team advanced to the finals ; Kahn conceded only three goals in the course of the competition , two of which were in the Final . Playing the final match with torn ligaments in his right ring finger , Kahn conceded the first goal by fumbling a rebounded shot from Rivaldo to the feet of striker Ronaldo in the 67th minute . Once the game was over with Brazil as the new champion , he stood alone and disappointed in his goal ; nevertheless he refused to blame his injury for his mistake . 
 The FIFA Technical Study Group awarded him with the Lev Yashin Award for the best goalkeeper of the tournament , and became the first goalkeeper in history to win the Golden Ball for the best individual performance . He also became the first German goalkeeper to keep five clean sheets in a World Cup tournament . Kahn maintained his number one spot for the 2004 UEFA European Football Championship , but Germany were once again eliminated in the group stage . Oliver Kahn gave up his captaincy to Michael Ballack after the tournament . 
 Germany 's new manager Jürgen Klinsmann , who replaced Rudi <unk> , adopted the strategy of rotating the number one spot between Kahn and his longtime competitor , Jens Lehmann of Arsenal , to stimulate competition between the two . On 7 April 2006 , after two years of dispute for the position Klinsmann announced Lehmann was his first @-@ choice goalkeeper for the 2006 World Cup . Kahn decided to stay on as a backup for the competition ; despite their acrimonious pre @-@ tournament battle for Germany ’ s starting role , Kahn openly accepted Klinsmann ’ s decision . Kahn and Lehmann embraced and shook hands as the former offered words of encouragement before the quarter @-@ final penalty shoot @-@ out against Argentina . In the postgame conference , Kahn publicly praised Lehmann for his two decisive penalty saves . 
 After Germany was eliminated in the semi @-@ finals by Italy , Kahn was given the start for the third place play @-@ off held on 8 July 2006 , which Germany won 3 – 1 against Portugal . In what was his last international appearance for Germany , he also received the captaincy of the team in the absence of the injured Michael Ballack . Although overshadowed by Bastian Schweinsteiger ’ s game @-@ winning performance in the match , Kahn played to a high standard , pulling off several saves . Kahn deflected a shot by Portuguese forward <unk> after he beat the German defence , and later saved Deco 's shot made from just inside the penalty area . Following the match , Oliver Kahn announced his retirement from the German National Team . Throughout his international career he earned 86 caps for Germany , including 49 as team captain . He never won a World Cup , but finished as runner @-@ up in 2002 and third in 2006 .

 = Halloween ( franchise ) = 
 Halloween is an American horror franchise that consists of ten films , novels , comic books , merchandise , and a video game . The franchise predominately focuses on the fictional character of Michael Myers who was committed to a sanitarium as a child for the murder of his older sister , Judith Myers . Fifteen years later , he escapes to stalk and kill the people of Haddonfield , Illinois while being chased by his former psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis . Michael 's killings occur on the holiday of Halloween , on which all of the films primarily take place . The films collectively grossed over $ 366 million at the box @-@ office worldwide . 
 The original Halloween , released in 1978 , was written by John Carpenter and Debra Hill , and directed by Carpenter . The sequels have had various writers and directors attached to them . Michael Myers is the antagonist in all of the films except Halloween III : Season of the Witch , the story of which has no direct connection to any other film in the series . Carpenter , who had a hand in writing the first sequel , has not had any direct involvement with the rest of the films . The film series is ranked fourth at the United States box office — in adjusted 2008 dollars — when compared to other American horror franchises . The first Halloween film is credited with beginning a long line of slasher films inspired by Alfred Hitchcock 's Psycho . The franchise began when the first novel appeared less than a year after the release of the first film , and seven sequels have since followed . In 2007 , director Rob Zombie produced a remake of the 1978 film . A direct sequel to the 2007 remake was released two years later . 
 = = Films = = 
 = = = Overview = = = 
 The original Halloween ( 1978 ) , written and directed by John Carpenter , tells the story of Michael Myers as he stalks and kills teenage babysitters on Halloween night . The film begins with six @-@ year @-@ old Michael ( Will Sandin ) killing his teenage sister Judith ( Sandy Johnson ) on Halloween 1963 in the fictional town of Haddonfield , Illinois . He is subsequently hospitalized at Smith 's Grove Sanitarium . Fifteen years later , Michael ( Nick Castle and Tony Moran ) escapes and returns to his hometown where he stalks Laurie Strode ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) and her friends as they babysit . The film ends with Michael being shot six times by his psychiatrist , Dr. Sam Loomis ( Donald Pleasence ) . Halloween II ( 1981 ) picks up where the events of Halloween left off . Michael 's body is missing from the front lawn , where he fell when Loomis shot him . Michael follows Laurie to the local hospital , killing everyone who gets between him and Laurie . The story reveals that Laurie is actually Michael 's sister : she was given up for adoption as an infant . Michael corners Loomis and Laurie in an operating room , where Loomis causes an explosion as Laurie escapes . Michael , engulfed in flames , stumbles out of the room toward Laurie before finally falling dead . 
 Michael Myers does not appear in Halloween III : Season of the Witch ( 1982 ) . This installment follows the story of Dr. Challis ( Tom Atkins ) as he tries to solve the mysterious murder of a patient in his hospital . He , along with the patient 's daughter Ellie ( Stacey Nelkin ) , travels to the small town of Santa Mira , California . The pair discover that Silver Shamrock Novelties , a company run by <unk> Cochran ( Dan O 'Herlihy ) , is attempting to use the mystic powers of the Stonehenge rocks to resurrect the ancient aspects of the Celtic festival , Samhain , which Cochran connects to witchcraft . Cochran is using his Silver Shamrock Halloween masks to achieve his goal , which will be achieved when all the children wearing his masks watch the Silver Shamrock commercial airing Halloween night . Challis contacts the television stations and convinces all but one of the station managers to remove the commercial . The film ends with Challis screaming for the final station to turn off the commercial . 
 Halloween 4 : The Return of Michael Myers ( 1988 ) , as the title suggests , features the return of Michael Myers ( George P. Wilbur ) to the film series . The film reveals that Michael survived the fire in Halloween II but has been in a coma since that night . While being transferred back to Smith 's Grove , Michael comes out of his coma and overhears that Laurie Strode , who died in a car accident , has a daughter , Jamie Lloyd ( Danielle Harris ) . Michael escapes the transport and heads to Haddonfield in search of Jamie . Fellow survivor Dr. Loomis also goes to Haddonfield after learning that Michael has escaped transfer . Eventually , the police track Michael down and shoot him several times before he falls down a mine shaft . Picking up directly where the previous film ends , Halloween 5 : The Revenge of Michael Myers ( 1989 ) has Michael ( Don Shanks ) surviving the gunshots , and the fall down the mine ; he stumbles upon a hermit who bandages him up . One year later , and showing signs of a metaphysical connection to Jamie , Michael tracks Jamie to a local child mental health clinic . Using Jamie as bait , Loomis manages to capture Michael . The film ends with Michael being taken into police custody , only to be broken out of jail by a mysterious stranger , all dressed in black . Halloween : The Curse of Michael Myers ( 1995 ) picks up the story approximately six years after the events of The Revenge of Michael Myers . The mysterious stranger who broke Michael out of jail kidnaps Jamie Lloyd ( J. C. Brandy ) in an effort to obtain her illegitimate child . Jamie escapes with her newborn , with Michael ( George P. Wilbur ) in pursuit . Michael kills Jamie and continues searching for her baby ; the infant is found by Tommy Doyle ( Paul Stephen Rudd ) — the young boy who was babysat by Laurie Strode in the first film — who brings it home for safety . It is revealed that Michael is driven by the Curse of Thorn , which forces a person to kill their entire family in order to save all of civilization . The mysterious stranger is revealed to be Dr. Loomis ’ s colleague , Dr. Wynn ( Mitchell Ryan ) , who is part of a group of people who protect the chosen individual so that they may complete their task . With the help of Kara Strode ( Marianne Hagan ) , Laurie ’ s adoptive cousin , Tommy keeps the infant from Michael , who slaughters Wynn and his followers . Michael is finally subdued by Tommy , who injects him with large quantities of tranquilizers inside the Smith ’ s Grove Sanitarium . The film ends with Loomis walking back into the sanitarium to find Michael . 
 The events that transpire between Halloween 4 and Halloween 6 are effectively ignored in 1998 ’ s Halloween H20 : 20 Years Later . This film opens twenty years after the events of the second film . Laurie Strode ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) has faked her own death so that she could go into hiding from her brother Michael . Now working as the head mistress of a private school under the name Keri Tate , Laurie continues to live in fear of her brother ’ s return . Her own son , John ( Josh Hartnett ) , attends school where she teaches . Laurie ’ s fear becomes reality when Michael ( Chris Durand ) shows up at the school and begins killing John ’ s friends and eventually he and Laurie come face @-@ to @-@ face . Laurie manages to get John and his girlfriend ( Michelle Williams ) to safety , but decides to return to the school to face Michael once and for all . Laurie succeeds in stopping Michael , but not satisfied until she knows that he is truly dead , Laurie steals his body and decapitates Michael . Halloween : Resurrection ( 2002 ) picks up three years after H20 , and reveals that Michael swapped clothes with a paramedic — crushing the paramedic ’ s larynx so that he could not talk — and that was who Laurie killed . Unable to deal with killing an innocent man , and the fact that Michael was still out there , Laurie is committed to a mental institution . Michael ( Brad Loree ) shows up at the institution , but Laurie captures him . Her fear of making the same mistake twice gets the better of her , and when she attempts to remove Michael ’ s mask he surprises and kills her . Michael travels back to his family home in Haddonfield , but finds a group of college students filming an Internet reality show . Michael proceeds to kill everyone , until he is finally electrocuted by the only surviving student , Sara Moyer ( Bianca <unk> ) , and the show ’ s creator Freddie Harris ( Busta Rhymes ) . 
 A remake of the original Halloween was released in 2007 . This film focuses on the events that led Michael Myers ( Daeg Faerch ) to kill his family . It also identifies Laurie as Michael ’ s sister early on , which was something not done in the original 1978 film . On Halloween , Michael murders a school bully , his older sister and her boyfriend , as well as his mother ’ s boyfriend . Committed to Smith ’ s Grove Sanitarium , Michael closes himself off from everyone . Seventeen years later , Michael ( Tyler Mane ) escapes and heads to Haddonfield to find his younger sister , with his psychiatrist Dr. Loomis ( Malcolm McDowell ) in pursuit . Michael finds his sister living with the Strode family , and going by the name Laurie . After killing all of her friends and family , Michael kidnaps Laurie and attempts to explain to her that he is her brother through the use of a picture that he has kept of himself and her as an infant . Unable to understand , Laurie fights back ; eventually , Laurie uses Loomis 's gun to shoot Michael in the head . In 2009 , a sequel to the remake , titled Halloween II , picks up right where the latter leaves off and then jumps ahead one year . Here , Michael ( Mane ) is presumed dead , but resurfaces after a vision of his deceased mother Deborah ( Sheri Moon Zombie ) informs him that he must track Laurie ( Scout Taylor @-@ Compton ) down so that they can " come home " together . In the film , Michael and Laurie have a mental link , with the two sharing visions of their mother .

 After viewing John Carpenter 's film Assault on Precinct 13 ( 1976 ) at the Milan Film Festival , independent film producer Irwin Yablans and financier Moustapha Akkad sought out Carpenter to direct for them a film about a psychotic killer stalking babysitters . Carpenter and Debra Hill began drafting a story titled The Babysitter Murders , but the title was changed at Yablans ' request , suggesting the setting be changed to Halloween night and naming it Halloween instead . Moustapha Akkad fronted the $ 300 @,@ 000 for the film 's budget , even though he was worried about the tight schedule , low budget , and Carpenter 's limited experience as a filmmaker . He finally decided to finance the film after Carpenter relayed the entire film to Akkad , " in a suspenseful way , almost frame for frame " , and opted not to take any fees for directing the film . The low budget forced wardrobe and props to be crafted from items on hand or that could be purchased inexpensively ; this included the trademark mask worn by Michael Myers throughout the film . Production designer , art director , location scout and co @-@ editor Tommy Lee Wallace created Michael 's mask from a William Shatner Halloween mask , purchased for $ 1 @.@ 98 . The limited budget also dictated the filming location and time schedule . Halloween was filmed in 21 days in the spring of 1978 primarily in South Pasadena , California . An abandoned house owned by a church stood in as the Myers house . Two homes on Orange Grove Avenue in Hollywood were used for the film 's climax . 
 Following the success of Halloween , Yablans and Akkad began working on Halloween II . There was initial discussion about filming Halloween II in 3 @-@ D , but the idea never came to fruition . After Halloween II was released , Carpenter and Hill were approached about creating a third Halloween film , but they were reluctant to pledge commitment . The pair agreed to participate in the new project only if it was not a direct sequel to Halloween II , which meant no Michael Myers . Most of the filming for Halloween III took place on location in the small coastal town of Loleta in Humboldt County , California . Familiar Foods , a milk bottling plant in Loleta , served as the Silver Shamrock Novelties factory , but all special effects involving fire , smoke , and explosions were filmed at Post Studios . 
 After Halloween III was released , Michael Myers was brought back into the franchise with 1988 's The Return of Michael Myers , where he has stayed for the remainder of the series . Four more sequels would follow , between 1988 and 2002 , before the series would take a break for five years . On June 4 , 2006 , Dimension announced that Rob Zombie , director of House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil 's Rejects , would be creating the next installment in the Halloween franchise . Bob Weinstein approached Rob Zombie about making the film , and Zombie , who was a fan of the original Halloween and friend of John Carpenter , jumped at the chance to make a Halloween film for Dimension Films . Before Dimension went public with the news , Zombie felt obligated to inform John Carpenter , out of respect , of the plans to remake his film . Carpenter 's request was for Zombie to " make it his own [ film ] " . Zombie 's film would combine the elements of prequel and remake with the original concept , with considerable original content in the new film . Zombie also wanted to reinvent the character , as he felt Michael , along with Freddy Krueger , Jason Voorhees , and Pinhead , had become too familiar to audiences , and as a result , less scary . Zombie delved deeper into Michael Myers 's mythology . Michael 's mask was even given its own story to provide an explanation as to why he wears it , instead of having the character simply steal a random mask from a hardware store , as in the original film . Zombie wanted to bring Michael closer to what a psychopath really is , and wanted the mask to be a way for Michael to hide . 
 In 2008 , a sequel to the 2007 remake was announced , with French filmmakers Alexandre Bustillo and Julien <unk> in negotiations to direct . Instead , Zombie was resigned to write and direct the sequel , with the film taking place directly after the end of his remake . In an interview , Zombie expressed how the exhaustion of creating the first Halloween made him not want to come back for a sequel , but after a year of cooling down he was more open to the idea . The writer / director explains that with the sequel , he was no longer bound by a sense of needing to retain any " John Carpenter @-@ ness " , as he could now do " whatever [ he ] wants to do " . Instead of focusing on Michael , Zombie chose to look more at the psychological consequences on Laurie after the events of the remake . As Zombie explains , after Michael murdered her friends and family , Laurie became a " wreck " , who continually sinks lower as the film moves forward . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 John Carpenter composed the music to the first three films . For Halloween , Carpenter chose to use a piano melody played in a 5 / 4 time rhythm instead of a symphonic soundtrack . Critic James Berardinelli calls the score " relatively simple and unsophisticated " , but admits that " Halloween 's music is one of its strongest assets . " Carpenter stated in an interview , " I can play just about any keyboard , but I can 't read or write a note . " In the end credits , Carpenter bills himself as the " Bowling Green Orchestra " for performing the film 's score , but he did receive assistance from composer Dan Wyman , a music professor at San Jose State University . 
 The score for Halloween II is a variation of John Carpenter 's compositions from the first film , particularly the main theme 's familiar piano melody played . The score was performed on a synthesizer organ rather than the piano used for Halloween . One reviewer for the BBC described the revised score as having " a more Gothic feel " . The reviewer asserted that it " doesn ’ t sound quite as good as the original piece " , but " it still remains a classic piece of music " . 
 Music remained an important element in establishing the atmosphere of Halloween III . Just as in Halloween and Halloween II , there was no symphonic score . Much of the music was composed to solicit " false startles " from the audience . The soundtrack was composed by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth , who had also worked on the score for Halloween II . The score of Halloween III differed greatly from the familiar main theme of the original and its first sequel . Carpenter replaced the familiar piano melody with a slower , electronic theme played on a synthesizer with beeping tonalities . Howarth explains how he and Carpenter composed the music for the third film : 
 The music style of John Carpenter and myself has further evolved in this film soundtrack by working exclusively with synthesizers to produce our music . This has led to a certain procedural routine . The film is first transferred to a time coded video tape and synchronized to a 24 track master audio recorder ; then while watching the film we compose the music to these visual images . The entire process goes quite rapidly and has ' instant gratification ' , allowing us to evaluate the score in synch to the picture . This is quite an invaluable asset .

 When the original Halloween was released in 1978 , a novelization of the movie followed just a year later . Written by Curtis Richards , the book follows the events of the film , but expands on the festival of Samhain and Michael 's time at Smith 's Grove Sanitarium . Halloween II , Halloween III : Season of the Witch , and Halloween 4 each received novelizations as well . Jack Martin would write Halloween II , which was released alongside its film counterpart . Martin included an additional victim of Michael 's in this novel . Halloween IV , released in October 1988 and written by Nicholas <unk> , also followed the events of the film in which it was adapted from . As of August 2010 , no further films have been novelized . 
 Over a four @-@ month period , Berkley Books published three young adult novels written by Kelly O 'Rourke ; the novels are original stories created by O 'Rourke , with no direct continuity with the films . The first , released on October 1 , 1997 , titled The Scream Factory , follows a group of friends who set up a haunted house attraction in the basement of Haddonfield City Hall , only to be stalked and killed by Michael Myers while they are there . The Old Myers Place is the second novel , released December 1 , 1997 , and focuses on Mary White , who moves into the Myers house with her family . Michael returns home and begins stalking and attacking Mary and her friends . O 'Rourke 's final novel , The Mad House , was released on February 1 , 1998 . The Mad House features a young girl , Christine Ray , who joins a documentary film crew that travels to haunted locations ; they are currently headed to Smith Grove Mental Hospital , where they are confronted by Michael . 
 = = = Comic books = = = 
 The first Halloween comic was published by Brian Pulido 's Chaos ! Comics . Simply titled Halloween , it was intended to be a one @-@ issue special , but eventually two sequels spawned : Halloween II : The Blackest Eyes and Halloween III : The Devil 's Eyes . All of the stories were written by Phil <unk> , with Daniel Farrands — writer for Halloween : The Curse of Michael Myers — assisting on the first issue ; David Brewer and <unk> worked on the illustrations . Tommy Doyle is the main protagonist in each of the issues , focusing on his attempts to kill Michael Myers . The first issue includes back story on Michael 's childhood , while the third picks up after the events of the film Halloween H20 . These comics were based on Daniel Farrand 's concept for Halloween 8 ; he had been approached by the producers to pitch a follow @-@ up to Halloween H20 . His idea was to have Tommy Doyle incarcerated at Smith 's Grove for Michael Myers ' crimes , only to escape and reunite with Lindsay Wallace . Together , they study the journals of Dr. Loomis and find out more about Michael 's childhood . The movie would have explored Michael 's time at Smith 's Grove and relationship with Dr. Loomis , before returning to Tommy and Lindsay , who are attacked by the adult Michael Myers . Upon defeating him and removing his mask , they discover Laurie Strode , who has taken over her brother 's mantle . Farrand 's logic was that , since Jamie Lee Curtis was contracted to cameo in Halloween 8 , they should make that cameo as significant and surprising as possible . Although the studio did not follow up on his pitch , Farrands was able to tell his story in comic book form . 
 One Good Scare was released in 2003 ; it was written by Stefan Hutchinson and illustrated by Peter Fielding . The main character in this comic is Lindsey Wallace , the young girl who first saw Michael Myers alongside Tommy Doyle in the original 1978 film . Hutchinson wanted to bring the character back to his roots , and away from the " lumbering Jason @-@ clone " the film sequels had made him . One Good Scare came about because Hutchinson wanted to produce a comic book to celebrate the series ' twenty @-@ fifth anniversary ; it was to be sold as a collectible at a Halloween convention in South Pasadena . Due to the positive reception to One Good Scare , Hutchinson hoped to use the comic as a " demo " for getting a distribution deal , but was unable due to rights issues . 
 While waiting to acquire the rights to publish more Halloween comics , Stefan Hutchinson worked on the documentary Halloween : 25 Years of Terror with Malek Akkad . Together , they developed ideas for possible Halloween stories that would be " connected into a larger tale , so the idea was that it would use the serial aspect of comic books to create different storylines than would be possible in the films . " On July 25 , 2006 , as an insert inside the DVD release of 25 Years of Terror , Hutchinson released Halloween : Autopsis . Written by Hutchinson , and artwork by Marcus Smith and Nick Dismas , the story is about a photographer assigned to take pictures of Michael Myers . As the photographer , Carter , follows Dr. Loomis he begins to take on Loomis 's obsession himself , until finally meeting Michael Myers in person , which results in his death . 
 Rob Zombie 's reboot of the film series ensured that any Halloween comics would not be contradicted by upcoming films , allowing Hutchinson creative freedom . Malek Akkad was approached by Devil 's Due Publishing with the possibility of producing a line of Halloween comics , and he and Hutchinson worked to make them a reality . Hutchinson was convinced by the strong support of One Good Scare that the comic books would have an audience . In 2008 , Stefan Hutchinson released the first issue of his new comic book , Halloween : Nightdance . This is a four issue mini @-@ series , and it does not contain any characters — other than Michael — from the films . The four issues are titled , " A Shape in the Void " , " The Silent Clown " , " A Rainbow in One Color " , and " When the Stars Came Crashing Down " . The first issue , " A Shape in the Void " , takes place on October 31 , 2000 , so that it falls between Halloween H20 and Halloween Resurrection . Issue one follows Michael as he stalks Lisa , an eighteen @-@ year @-@ old girl with insecurities and " a chronic fear of darkness " . Hutchinson explains that Nightdance was an attempt to escape the dense continuity of the film series and recreate the tone of the 1978 film . Michael becomes inexplicably fixated on Lisa , just as he did with Laurie in the original Halloween , before the sequels established that a sibling bond was actually his motivation for stalking her . The aim was to once again establish Michael Myers as a " credible and dangerous force " . 
 August 2008 saw the release of Devil 's Due 's Halloween : 30 Years of Terror to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the Halloween franchise . This comic book one @-@ shot is a collection of short stories inspired by John Carpenter 's original . " Trick or Treat " features the <unk> , unseen characters from the first film who Tommy and Lindsey run to for help . " <unk> " shows a murder from the point of view of both Michael and his victim , " Visiting Hours " sees Laurie Strode reflecting on how her life could have been had her brother never found her in 1978 , while " Tommy and the Boogeyman " reveals that Tommy Doyle grew up to write comic books featuring Michael Myers . In the final story , " Repetition Compulsion " , Dr. Loomis tries to predict where Michael will strike next on Halloween , 1989 . Writer Hutchinson explains that <unk> came about because , unlike previous decades , there was no Halloween film coming out in 2008 to acknowledge the occasion . 
 Devil 's Due released three @-@ issue mini @-@ series Halloween : The First Death of Laurie Strode in late 2008 . Written by Hutchinson with artwork from Jeff <unk> , the story bridges the gap between Halloween II and Halloween H20 by focusing on Laurie Strode in the aftermath of the 1978 murders . Hutchinson explains that Laurie is " trying to get better and trying to repair , but where do you even start after going through such horror ? How do you even try to resume normality when you don 't know what that is anymore ? " Although Michael appears in the series , it is not clear whether he is real or if the traumatised Laurie is seeing things . Hutchinson is not a fan of the revelation that Laurie and Michael are siblings and took steps to address that problem in the story . He wanted to avoid the " bloodline plot of the middle sequels " , which he felt <unk> the character of the Shape , and approach the story so that " it becomes almost incidental that she 's his sister " . Hutchinson believed that Laurie Strode 's evolution into Keri Tate was fertile ground for a storyline ; he says , " it 's not the faking of the death that 's interesting at all , but it ’ s the fall that leads to that happening . The faked death is just simple mechanics and can be covered in a sentence , but the state of mind and events leading to that are full of rich character and dramatic potential . "

 All of Stefan Hutchinson 's Halloween comic books take place in the Halloween H20 timeline , which retconned Halloween 4 – 6 from continuity . Hutchinson comments that , while the retcon was unpopular with " a lot of fans " for ignoring previous movies , he preferred the " simplicity of this storyline , over the needlessly convoluted mythology that the last two films had created " . However , he admits that one of the downsides of the H20 timeline is that fans do not know exactly what happened to Dr. Sam Loomis after Halloween II . To remedy this , Hutchinson pitched Halloween : Sam as a way of paying tribute to the character . Written by Hutchinson and featuring illustrations from Autopsis 's Marcus Smith , Sam is a prose short story available exclusively for download at the website <unk> It explores the life of Dr. Loomis , including his backstory and relationship with Elizabeth Worthington , a journalist he met during World War II . In 1995 , Michael Myers visits the ailing Dr. Loomis in hospital , and murders Elizabeth in front of him . Loomis attempts to stop him , but dies of a coronary failure .

 In 1983 , Wizard Video , who had also released a video game version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , released a Halloween game for the Atari 2600 . In the game , the player was a babysitter who had to protect her children from Michael Myers , who had managed to get inside the house . Although the game was called Halloween , and featured the film 's theatrical poster as its cover art as well as the movie 's main music theme , the game itself never refers to any characters , including the killer , by their names in the film . 
 The Halloween franchise has also seen profitability through various merchandise like toys , dolls , statues , model kits , bobbleheads , snow globes , movie posters , masks , T @-@ shirts , hats , and more . Michael Myers has made appearances in the form of dolls and toys from McFarlane Toys , Sideshow Collectibles , and NECA . Even Dr. Loomis has been immortalized in plastic alongside Michael Myers in a two @-@ figure set produced by NECA . 
 The Michael Myers mask has been reproduced over the years by Don Post , the mask company responsible for the creation of the masks from several of the Halloween films ( the Silver Shamrock novelty factory seen in Halloween III was actually shot on location in one of Don Post 's factories ) . While Don Post reproductions of the Michael Myers mask are still commonly found in costume stores every Halloween , the license to produce Michael Myers masks has since been given to Cinema Secrets , the company commissioned with the creation of the Michael Myers mask for Halloween : Resurrection . As of 2012 , Universal Pictures has granted license to Trick or Treat Studios to produce two versions of the Michael Myers mask from Halloween II , one " clean " version and one with the famous " blood tears " . 
 The Halloween series also lives on in DVD form . Many versions of the original Halloween ( often including special extras like free merchandise or additional footage missing from previous DVD releases of the film ) as well as several of its sequels have been published by Anchor Bay Entertainment , Universal Studios , and Dimension Films . On October 2 , 2007 , the original Halloween was released on Blu @-@ ray for the first time by Anchor Bay Home Entertainment . In December 2007 there were reports that the Producer 's Cut of Halloween : The Curse of Michael Myers might get a DVD release in the future . 
 Following the first Blu @-@ ray release of the original Halloween , all other films in the series were subsequently released to Blu @-@ ray , as well . Home video distributors Anchor Bay Entertainment and Scream Factory released Halloween : The Complete Collection to Blu @-@ ray on September 23 , 2014 . This box set brings together all ten Halloween films released to date . Two versions of The Complete Collection were released : a standard 10 @-@ disc set featuring the first eight original films of the series and Rob Zombie 's 2007 and 2009 remakes , and a " Limited Edition " 15 @-@ disc set , containing the ten films on ten discs , and five extra discs featuring the television versions of Halloween and Halloween II , the never @-@ before released Halloween 6 : The Producer 's Cut , a bonus disc to Rob Zombie 's Halloween , and a bonus disc containing all @-@ new special features from all ten films . The box set won the 2015 Saturn Award for Best DVD / BD Collection Release . 
 = M @-@ 222 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 222 is the current designation of a state trunkline highway in Allegan County of the US state of Michigan . It runs between the city of Allegan , where it connects with M @-@ 40 / M @-@ 89 , and the US Highway 131 ( US 131 ) freeway near Martin . The highway runs along a series of streets in Allegan and through rural farm fields and woods between the two communities along 116th Avenue . The roadway was a state highway back in 1919 when the system was initially signed . It was assigned as part of M @-@ 89 and M @-@ 40 before being given its own number , M @-@ 118 . That designation was applied to the highway until 1988 when that was retired in favor of the current M @-@ 222 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 222 begins at an intersection with M @-@ 40 / M @-@ 89 in the town of Allegan at the corner of Cutler and Cedar streets . From there , the trunkline runs northward on Cedar Street for a block before turning eastward on Monroe Street . Then the highway proceeds through residential areas along Monroe and turns onto Grand Street to cross over the Kalamazoo River . M @-@ 222 intersects A @-@ 37 ( Main Street ) and runs next to Padgham Field before exiting town . From there , the highway continues on due eastward as 116th Avenue through rural areas and agricultural fields . Further east , the fields are taken over by forested area and residential subdivisions in places near Watson . The trunkline jogs to the south to bisect Wetheral Lake . M @-@ 222 ends north of US 131 Motorsports Park near exit 55 on US 131 east of Martin . 
 Like other state highways in Michigan , M @-@ 222 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) . In 2011 , the department 's traffic surveys showed that on average , 9 @,@ 147 vehicles used the highway daily in Allegan between M @-@ 40 / M @-@ 89 and A @-@ 37 and 5 @,@ 470 vehicles did so each day between near the eastern terminus , the highest and lowest counts along the highway , respectively . No section of M @-@ 222 is listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility .

 When the state highway system was initially signposted in 1919 , the highway between Allegan and Martin was part of M @-@ 89 . In 1926 , when M @-@ 40 was extended from Allegan to Martin , M @-@ 89 was rerouted out of Allegan to the southeast along its present @-@ day alignment to terminate at US 131 in Plainwell . 
 In 1929 , the routing from Allegan to Martin was removed and renumbered M @-@ 118 , and M @-@ 40 was extended to the north out of Allegan along M @-@ 89 and its modern routing to a new terminus in Holland ending at US 31 . By the middle of 1960 , the US 131 was opened as far south as Martin ; the section of M @-@ 118 between the new freeway and the old routing was used as a connector until the next section south to Plainwell opened the next year . After this next freeway segment was opened , M @-@ 118 was truncated to end at the freeway . 
 In 1988 , the M @-@ 118 designation was decommissioned and the highway was renumbered M @-@ 222 to prevent confusion with 118th street which runs parallel to the route about one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to the north for most of the length .

 = The Truth ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " The Truth " is the collective name for the 201st and 202nd episodes of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . The last episodes of the show 's ninth season , " The Truth " originally served as the finale for the entire series , until the return of the series in January 2016 . First aired together on the Fox network on May 19 , 2002 , the episodes were written by series creator Chris Carter and directed by Kim Manners . " The Truth " was the most @-@ watched episode of the ninth season in the United States , receiving a Nielsen rating of 7 @.@ 5 , attracting 7 @.@ 5 percent of the available audience and being viewed by approximately 13 @.@ 25 million viewers upon its initial broadcast . The finale received mixed reviews , with many commentators criticizing the episode 's lack of closure . Others were pleased with the full return of actor David Duchovny to the series , as well as the episode 's conclusion . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents who work on unsolved paranormal cases called X @-@ Files ; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) , Monica Reyes ( Annabeth Gish ) , and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) . In this episode , after not knowing Fox Mulder 's ( Duchovny ) whereabouts for the past year , Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) and Scully learn that Mulder is being held for the murder of a military man he could not possibly have killed : Knowle Rohrer ( Adam Baldwin ) , one of the government 's secret " Super Soldiers " . Mulder breaks out of prison with the help of Skinner , Reyes , Doggett , Scully and Alvin Kersh ( James Pickens , Jr . ) . Mulder and Scully travel to New Mexico where helicopters destroy an Anasazi cliff dwelling ruin along with The Smoking Man ( William B. Davis ) . 
 The episode featured the return of Duchovny — following his departure after the eighth season finale — as well as several other recurring characters . " The Truth " served to conclude many long @-@ time story arcs while creating new ones for a possible film franchise . Shooting took place at various California locales , including a hydroelectric power plant east of Fresno and Anza @-@ Borrego Desert State Park . Carter would return to The X @-@ Files universe with a feature film , The X @-@ Files : I Want to Believe ( 2008 ) , and has publicly discussed the possibility of a third film , which would focus on the impending extraterrestrial invasion revealed in " The Truth " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 At the Mount Weather military base , Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) appears with several government officials . He gains access to highly classified documents on a secure computer system , and is shocked and dismayed to read the documents , which provide details of the final colonization of the planet by alien forces . Before he can continue reading , Mulder hears another person approaching . He hides quickly and observes Knowle Rohrer ( Adam Baldwin ) , a former friend of John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) but who has been irreversibly transformed into an enemy " Super Soldier " , approach the computer system . Rohrer immediately realizes the system has been accessed . Mulder attempts to attack Rohrer , but Rohrer overpowers him . Mulder frantically flees , but Rohrer <unk> him . In a violent altercation , Mulder flips Rohrer off a catwalk onto high @-@ voltage wiring , and Rohrer apparently dies by electrocution . Mulder attempts to escape , but is quickly arrested by several soldiers . 
 News of Mulder 's arrest spreads to the FBI . Upon hearing that he has resurfaced , and in such a dire manner , Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) and Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) visit him in military custody . During his time in captivity , Mulder receives mysterious visits from two phantoms of his past : Alex Krycek ( Nicholas Lea ) and X ( Steven Williams ) . Meanwhile , Scully and Skinner go to great lengths to get him released , but are unsuccessful . Mulder 's fate is ultimately made the subject of a military tribunal with Deputy Director Alvin Kersh ( James Pickens , Jr . ) in charge . At the outset , it appears Mulder will become the hopeless victim of a show trial stacked against him . 
 Skinner takes Mulder 's defense , while Scully , Doggett , Monica Reyes ( Annabeth Gish ) , Marita Covarrubias ( Laurie Holden ) , Gibson Praise ( Jeff Gulka ) and Jeffrey Spender ( Chris Owens ) testify on Mulder 's behalf . The prosecution presents Rohrer 's body as evidence against Mulder . Aware that Rohrer is a seemingly @-@ invincible " Super Soldier " , Scully performs a medical examination and proves that the body is not that of Rohrer . Despite this , the defense is ultimately overruled , and Mulder is sentenced to death for the murder of a military officer . Later , Doggett , Skinner , Reyes , and Scully help Mulder escape , with the unexpected help of Kersh who decided he should have let Mulder go in the first place . Despite being advised to immediately leave the continent via Canada , Mulder instead takes Scully to New Mexico . On their way , Mulder receives a visit by three additional ghosts : The Lone Gunmen , who advise him to flee for his life rather than continue his pursuit of the truth . Mulder politely declines . Meanwhile , Doggett and Reyes find their office emptied , suggesting that the X @-@ Files have been closed down for the third time . 
 Mulder and Scully arrive at Anasazi ruins to find a " wise man " who they believe can make sense of the classified documents Mulder has read . They discover the so @-@ called " wise man " is none other than The Smoking Man ( William B. Davis ) , who is hiding to survive the colonization — an event that will happen on December 22 , 2012 , the predicted end of the world . Outside , Reyes and Doggett arrive and prepare to fight Rohrer , who has been sent to kill Mulder and The Smoking Man . Rohrer is killed when the magnetite in the ruins affects his superhuman body . Switching cars with Mulder and Scully , Doggett and Reyes drive off . Black helicopters destroy the cliff dwellings — and The Smoking Man within — thinking that Mulder is still inside before flying away . Doggett and Reyes are last seen speeding away . 
 In a motel room in Roswell , New Mexico , Mulder and Scully prepare for bed and talk . Mulder explains his belief " that the dead are not lost to us . That they speak to us as part of something greater than us — greater than any alien force . And if you and I are powerless now , I want to believe that if we listen to what 's speaking , it can give us the power to save ourselves . " Despite their slim chance for success , Mulder declares , " Maybe there 's hope . "

 The episode was written by series creator Chris Carter . He noted , " It 's the end — you don 't get another chance . So you 'd better put everything you 've ever wanted to put in into the episode . There were things to distract us from what was really going on . The band was breaking up . " He expounded on the idea , saying that executive producer Frank Spotnitz and he decided " it was probably time to go [ ... ] it was strange to be writing these things knowing it was the last time we 'd see Scully doing certain things or hear Mulder saying certain things . " Spotnitz explained that Carter made the announcement in January so that " we had time to wrap our minds around the end and plan for it and give all of the characters their due . " Gish later said , " I have a great respect for the elegant way in which they 're closing the curtain " . Actor Bruce Harwood , who played John Fitzgerald Byers on the show , called the finale the " passing of a generation " . 
 Several of the episode 's scenes feature elements that reference earlier installments . The final scene in which Mulder and Scully speak in a hotel room is reminiscent of the series ' pilot episode . Furthermore , in " The Truth , " it is revealed to Mulder by The Smoking Man that the aliens plan to colonize the earth on December 22 , 2012 , an event that , according to the show , the Mayans predicted . This is a throw @-@ back to the second season episode " Red Museum , " which featured members of a new religious movement who believed that the year 2012 would bring about the dawning of the New Age . 
 Before the release of the 2008 film The X @-@ Files : I Want to Believe , Carter expressed an intent to make a third X @-@ Files feature film that would focus on the impending alien invasion revealed in this episode , depending on the success of The X @-@ Files : I Want to Believe . Following the release of The X @-@ Files : I Want to Believe , Carter , Spotnitz , Duchovny , and Anderson all expressed their interest in making one . However , on January 17 , 2015 , Fox Television Group chairman and CEO Gary Newman revealed that there was network interest in reviving The X @-@ Files , not as a movie franchise , but as a limited run television event .

 With this episode , Duchovny rejoined the main cast of The X @-@ Files after his departure following the eighth season finale " Existence " . The episode marks the only time that all five principal actors — Duchovny , Anderson , Patrick , Gish , and Pileggi — are credited together in the opening titles . Mulder , Scully , and the The Smoking Man are the only characters to appear in both this episode and the series ' pilot . This episode is the fourth of only four episodes in season nine where Duchovny appeared , the others being " Trust No 1 " , " Jump the Shark " , and " William " . Duchovny appeared in the first two via archival footage and only made a small cameo in the third . The episode marks the return of several characters who had either previously been killed @-@ off or had left the show , including X , who was killed in the season four opener " Herrenvolk " ; Deep Throat , who was murdered in the first season finale " The Erlenmeyer Flask " ; Alex Krycek , who was shot and killed by Skinner in the eighth season finale " Existence " ; The Smoking Man , who was purportedly killed in " Requiem " ; Gibson Praise , who was last seen in the eighth season episode " Without " ; The Lone Gunmen , who were killed @-@ off in the ninth season episode " Jump the Shark " ; Jeffrey Spender , who originally was killed @-@ off in the sixth season episode " One Son " but reappeared in the ninth season episode " William " ; and Marita Covarrubias , who last appeared in the seventh season finale " Requiem " . 
 Originally , this episode was to feature the recurring character Shannon McMahon . However , actress Lucy Lawless became pregnant shortly after filming the two @-@ part episode , " Nothing Important Happened Today " and was not available for subsequent episodes . Actress Julia Vera was called in to play the role of the woman who is helping the Smoking Man live in the Anasazi ruins . Vera had previously appeared in the sixth season two @-@ part episode " Dreamland " . She later called the opportunity " amazing " and declared that " my greatest experience was The X @-@ Files " . The final scene of the episode was originally going to feature the Toothpick Man , the alien leader of the New Syndicate played by Alan Dale , informing U.S. President George W. Bush , played by actor Gary Newton , of Mulder 's escape . The scene was filmed , but was not included in the broadcast version ; executive producer Frank Spotnitz later said that he was " so happy " that the producers cut the scene , noting that — despite " a lot of debate about it , on both sides " — the scene was unable to top the final scene with Mulder and Scully . On the DVD 's audio commentary , the producers mentioned that they had considered filming the shot on the Oval Office set created by The West Wing , a serial drama created by Aaron Sorkin that was originally broadcast on NBC . In addition , they originally wanted to have Martin Sheen appear as his character on The West Wing , Josiah Bartlet , instead of Bush , noting that the cameo would have been " a nice , sort of wink " to the television audience . Despite being cut from the final episode , the shot was featured as a deleted scene on the season nine video release . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The majority of the episode — like the rest of seasons six , seven , eight and nine — was filmed in Los Angeles , California . The first scene , featuring Mulder breaking into a military base , was shot in a hydroelectric power plant east of Fresno , California . The rooms that were featured in the episode were the main rooms for the power plant that The X @-@ Files design team redecorated ; the crew later called the set the " war room " . Most of the decoration and interior scene was done by the visual effect crew ; the only visible part seen in real life was a large generator that pumped water . Bill Roe , the cinematographer for the episode , spent four to five days lighting the set for filming . Kim Manners called his work " a great job " . The scenes that take place in the main computer terminal room were shot on a sound stage at 20th Century Fox ; the crew built the set themselves . The scenes with Mulder being tortured by the military guards were shot at Fort MacArthur , an abandoned military base in San Pedro , California , including The Marine Mammal Care Center located at Fort MacArthur . Filming the court room was one of the " most challenging sequences " Manners had ever done . Carter wanted the courtroom to have no spectators and no jury . This meant that Manners had to shoot each scene with a limited amount of actors and make them look " fresh " . Manners was terrified to film the 40 @-@ page long courtroom scene , pointing out that the show was basically re @-@ telling a nine @-@ year history of The X @-@ Files . Corey Kaplan designed the set . 
 The Anasazi ruins were constructed in Anza @-@ Borrego Desert State Park . Location manager Mac Gordon later noted that , due to the presence of a rare " spiny black horned toad " in the area , he and his crew were forced to hire several biologists to locate any lizards in the area and move them elsewhere . In addition , Gordon had a difficult time persuading the park rangers to build and then blow up faux @-@ ruins . He explained , " we were on a state park property that was an off road park , with motorcycles and [ All @-@ terrain vehicles ] flying all over the place , but they still blanched when I said we have to build Indian ruins and then blow it up . " However , the cameo of The Smoking Man was filmed on a sound stage back at 20th Century Fox . Manners noted that Davis had " a hell of a time " trying to smoke his cigarettes through a hole in his neck , because the hole was fake . The scene featuring The Smoking Man being burnt up by the fire from a missile was done via computer animation . The missiles were created via CGI technology by animator Mat Beck . The helicopter , however , included real smoke bombs . A shot of William B. Davis was overlapped with fire , and eventually a skull to give the effect that The Smoking Man 's flesh was burnt away . Paul Rabwin later called the scene a " great sequence " . 
 The last scene of the episode shot was between Anderson and Duchovny and was called " extremely tough " by Manners , due to it being " very emotional " . He noted that the scene " sums up the series " about a " man who believed and a woman who was skeptical but became a believer " . The scene was filmed at an actual motel , called La <unk> . The location had previously been used in episodes " Sein Und Zeit " and " This is Not Happening " .

 The final scene , featuring a conversation between Mulder and Scully , has been examined by author V. Alan White due to its perceived religious undertones . In the book The Philosophy of The X @-@ Files , he notes that the final scene " undermines Mulder 's seemingly persistent scorn of traditional " religion and his subtle acceptance of theism . In previous episodes — mainly those dealing with Scully 's Catholicism — Mulder shows a lack of approval when it came to the concept of organized religion , often pointing out that " theologians can be just as dogmatic as scientists " when it comes to unexplained phenomena . White proposes that this needling may be intentional on Mulder 's part , as a form of " ironic reversal of [ Scully 's ] skepticism about the paranormal " . However , the final lines of " The Truth " see Mulder talking about a belief in " something greater than us , greater than any alien force " . White also points out the fact that during this scene Mulder grabs Scully 's gold cross , an icon that symbolizes her belief through much of the series . 
 Several of the episode 's scenes and motifs have been compared to popular myths and legends . Michelle Bush , in her book Myth @-@ X , equated Mulder 's overall quest to that of the search for the Holy Grail . She notes that in " The Truth " , Mulder and Scully metaphorically " find their way to the Grail castle " only to discover that the Fisher King — the wounded knight charged with protecting the secret — is actually The Smoking Man . Furthermore , Bush compared the final scene of the episode — featuring Mulder musing about hope regarding an alien invasion — to the myth of Pandora 's Box . According to legend , the ancient Greek gods gave Pandora a box filled with evils and told her not to open it . Due to her curiosity , she disobeyed and unleashed various calamities unto the world . Bush argues that the Syndicate 's tampering with alien technology — such as their alien @-@ human hybrid experiments — are similar to the contents of the box . She notes that , in both cases , " man 's curiosity is his downfall " . In the end , however , both Pandora 's box and the world of The X @-@ Files contain hope , which , in the legend , was the only thing in the box that Pandora did not let go of .

 " The Truth " was originally aired on the Fox network on May 19 , 2002 , and became the most @-@ watched episode of the ninth season , receiving the season 's highest Nielsen ratings . Nielsen ratings are audience measurement system that determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States . " The Truth " earned a household rating of 7 @.@ 5 , meaning that it was seen by 7 @.@ 5 percent of the nation 's estimated households . It was viewed by a total of 13 @.@ 25 million viewers in the United States alone . On the date of its airing , the episode ranked third in its timeslot , behind the season finale of Survivor : Marquesas and the heavily promoted reunion of The Cosby Show . " The Truth " , however , placed ahead of the season finale of The Practice . In the United Kingdom and Ireland , the episode made its first appearance on Sky1 on September 26 , 2002 and received 1 @.@ 03 million viewers , placing The X @-@ Files second in the top ten broadcasts for Sky1 for that week , behind The Simpsons . The episode was included on The X @-@ Files Mythology , Volume 4 – Super Soldiers , a DVD collection that contains installments involved with the alien " Super Soldiers " arc . 
 = = = Reviews = = = 
 The entry received mixed reviews by critics ; the main reason for criticism was that , instead of creating a conclusion , the episode raised new questions for the audience . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , gave the episode a scathing review and awarded it one star out of five . The two , despite calling the opening " promising " , derided the episode 's ending — especially the revelation of alien colonization of December 22 , 2012 — writing , " is this really what the series was about ? " Furthermore , Shearman and Pearson concluded that the problem with the episode was that the show , which he called " brilliant — frequently , truly brilliant " decided " to define itself in the summing up " with the episode , which did not answer very many questions . UGO named the episode the fourteenth " Worst Series Finale " and wrote that the episode — and the show 's eighth and ninth seasons by extension — were negatively affected by the series ' lack of a defining plot line . The article noted that , while the episode claimed to wrap up the story arcs for the series , " the trial of Mulder ultimately resulted in very little satisfying payoff to the series ' overarching mysteries " . Joyce Millman , writing for The New York Times , after the premiere of " The Truth " , said of the show : " The most imaginative show on television has finally reached the limits of its imagination . " M.A. Crang , in his book Denying the Truth : Revisiting The X @-@ Files after 9 / 11 , was critical of the episode 's trial sequences . While he stated that these scenes " do a good job of bringing together the many disparate threads of this arc " , he felt that they were " interminably dull " . 
 Not all reviews were critical . Tom Kessenich , in his book Examinations , wrote a rather positive review of the episode . He noted that , while the episode " told us nothing of significance " regarding the " big picture " mythology story arc , the chance to see Mulder and Scully together one last time resulted in " an exquisite Mulder @-@ Scully moment " . He was particularly pleased with the final scene , noting that it was an appropriate conclusion ; he called it " fitting " , as well as " wonderful " . Kessenich maintained that , were it not for the return of Duchovny , " nobody would have given a damn about the end of this series . " Julie Salamon of The New York Times gave the episode a positive review . Salamon noted that " Until the end , the series maintained its mesmerizing visual gloominess , cleverly punctuated with suggestive plays of color and light " . She claimed the show " also retained its conspiracy @-@ theory heart that has appealed so greatly to viewers " . John C. Snider of <unk> praised the episode , stating " The Truth is a satisfying conclusion to the series , with plenty of twists and turns , a few surprise guest appearances , and an explosive finale complete with requisite black helicopters . The romantics among us will also be pleased with the culmination of the Mulder / Scully relationship " . 
 In 2011 , the finale was ranked number twenty @-@ two on the TV Guide Network special , TV 's Most Unforgettable Finales .

 = Seisho Maru = 
 Seisho Maru ( Japanese : <unk> , <unk> Maru ) was a cargo ship for Mitsui <unk> <unk> in military service that was sunk by an American submarine during World War II . The ship had been built as SS West Caruth , a cargo ship for the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) shortly after the end of World War I. Shortly after completion , the ship was inspected by the United States Navy for possible use as USS West Caruth ( ID @-@ <unk> ) but was neither taken into the Navy nor ever commissioned under that name . Before being sold to Japanese owners in 1928 , she was also known as SS Exmoor and SS Antonio Tripcovich . 
 West Caruth was built in 1918 for the USSB , as a part of the West boats , a series of steel @-@ hulled cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States for the World War I war effort , and was the second ship built at Southwestern Shipbuilding in San Pedro , California . After operating for four years under American registry , she was sold several times and operated under British , Italian , and Japanese registry throughout the remainder of her career . In November 1944 , while serving as Japanese transport Seisho Maru during World War II , she was sunk by U.S. Navy submarine Sunfish . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 The West ships were cargo ships of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the West Coast of the United States for the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) for emergency use during World War I. All were given names that began with the word West , like West Caruth , the second of some 18 West ships built by the Southwestern Shipbuilding of San Pedro , California . West Caruth ( Southwestern Shipbuilding No. 2 ) was launched at 08 : 00 on 31 December 1918 by sponsor Betty Howard , the nine @-@ year @-@ old daughter of company vice president , William F. Howard , and completed in February 1919 . 
 West Caruth was 5 @,@ 632 gross register tons ( GRT ) , and was 410 feet 5 inches ( 125 @.@ 10 m ) long ( between perpendiculars ) and 54 feet 6 inches ( 16 @.@ 61 m ) abeam . The ship had a single triple @-@ expansion steam engine that drove a single screw propeller , and moved the ship at up to 10 @.@ 5 knots ( 19 @.@ 4 km / h ) . 
 = = Career = = 
 West Caruth was inspected by the 12th Naval District of the United States Navy after completion for possible use as a service collier and was assigned the identification number of 3850 . Had she been commissioned , she would have been known as USS West Caruth ( ID @-@ 3850 ) , but the Navy neither took over the ship nor commissioned her . 
 The cargo ship sailed for the USSB under American registry for the first four years of her existence , and sailed to the west African ports of Dakar and Monrovia through 1921 . The Los Angeles Times reported that West Caruth sailed out of Los Angeles in both transpacific and European – Pacific service for two years . 
 In 1923 , West Caruth was sold to the North Devon Steamship Company and operated as tramp steamer Exmoor under the British flag . In 1924 , she was purchased by the Tripcovich Shipping Company of Trieste and sailed under the Italian flag as Antonio Tripcovich . Four years later , she was renamed Seisho Maru as a part of <unk> Shoten <unk> Kaisha of <unk> under Japanese registry . By the early 1930s Seisho Maru had been sold to Mitsui <unk> <unk> . 
 There is scant record of the ship 's movements under any of her later names . The Los Angeles Times reports her arrival at West Coast ports as Seisho Maru at least twice . In March 1930 , the ship arrived at Tacoma , Washington , from Singapore to pick up a load of logs for export . Another notice in November 1933 noted her impending return to Los Angeles , where she was scheduled to take on a load of borax and scrap brass . In early May 1939 , Seisho Maru ran aground in Tokyo Bay , but was refloated after several days . 
 During World War II , Seisho Maru served as an army transport , but sources reporting her movements are incomplete . It is known that she was one of some 20 ships that departed <unk> as part of three combined convoys — <unk> @-@ 17 , TE @-@ 03 , and No. 82 — in mid @-@ April 1944 . 
 Seisho Maru and seven other ships formed convoy MI @-@ 27 which departed Moji for Miri , Borneo , on 15 November that same year . Escorted by a converted minesweeper and three smaller vessels , the convoy hugged the coast of the Korean peninsula to try to avoid American submarines . Nevertheless , a group of three submarines — Peto , <unk> , and Sunfish — found and attacked the convoy on the night of 17 / 18 November . Torpedoes from Sunfish sank Edogawa Maru and damaged Seisho Maru shortly after 22 : 00 , while Peto sank <unk> Maru at 23 : 40 . At 01 : 30 , the damaged Seisho Maru engaged in a gun battle with a surfaced submarine . Then , at 03 : 17 , another spread of torpedoes from Sunfish finished off Seisho Maru , which sank at position 33 ° 36 ′ N 124 ° 18 ′ E in the East China Sea . 
 = Ocellated electric ray = 
 The ocellated electric ray or bullseye electric ray ( Diplobatis <unk> ) is a species of electric ray in the family <unk> , native to the shallow inshore waters of the eastern central Pacific from the Gulf of California to Ecuador . Reaching 25 cm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) in length , this species has a rounded pectoral fin disc and pelvic fins with convex margins . Its short and thick tail bears two dorsal fins and terminates in a triangular caudal fin . The ocellated electric ray is named for the distinctive large eyespot on the middle of its disc , consisting of a black or yellow center surrounded by concentric rings . Its dorsal coloration is otherwise highly variable , ranging from plain to ornately patterned on a light to dark brown background . The front part of its disc is darker brown . 
 Solitary and nocturnal in nature , the ocellated electric ray is a bottom @-@ dweller found in sandy and rocky habitats . It moves along the bottom by " hopping " on its pelvic fins , and feeds on small crustaceans and polychaete worms . For defense , it can generate an electrical discharge from its electric organs . This species probably bears live young that are sustained by yolk and later histotroph ( " uterine milk " ) during gestation . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed the ocellated electric ray as Vulnerable , as it is susceptible to the heavy trawling activity within its limited range . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 American ichthyologists David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert described the ocellated electric ray in an 1890 article for the scientific journal Proceedings of the United States National Museum . Their account was based on a female specimen caught by the United States Fish Commission steamer USS Albatross in 1888 . The female was collected off the Pacific coast of Colombia at a depth of 60 m ( 200 ft ) . Gilbert had previously obtained a specimen from Panama in 1882 , but it had been destroyed in a fire before it could be studied . Jordan and Gilbert named the new species <unk> ( Greek for " eyed " ) in reference to the distinctive spot on its back , and assigned it to the genus <unk> . In 1948 , Henry Bryant Bigelow and William Charles Schroeder created the new genus Diplobatis for this species based on then @-@ unique subdivision of its nostrils . Three other species of Diplobatis have since been described from the Atlantic . The Atlantic species more closely resemble each other in morphology than they do the ocellated electric ray , though as a whole all four Diplobatis species are extremely similar . Another common name for this species is " target ray " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The pectoral fin disc of the ocellated electric ray is <unk> or trowel @-@ shaped and slightly wider than long . A pair of large , kidney @-@ shaped electric organs are visible through the skin on either side of the head . The small eyes are followed by smaller spiracles , which have seven to ten small , rounded projections on their rims . The snout is broadly rounded , with each nostril divided into two openings by a strut . Between the nostrils is a curtain of skin with a smooth to gently wavy posterior margin . The small mouth forms a transverse line ; the edge of the lower jaw is scalloped , and when closed usually conceals the teeth . There are 14 – 16 tooth rows in each jaw . The small and pointed teeth become progressively longer and sharper towards the back , and are arranged in a quincunx pattern . Five pairs of small gill slits are present on the underside of the disc . 
 The large pelvic fins originate beneath the disc and have convex trailing margins . Adult males have very short and thick claspers . The broad and flattened tail is shorter than the disc and bears a fold of skin along either side . There are two small dorsal fins , both with rounded to angular apices ; the first is slightly smaller than the second , and its position varies from over to behind the pelvic fins . The caudal fin is triangular with rounded corners , and is roughly symmetrical above and below . The skin is soft and entirely devoid of dermal denticles . 
 The dorsal coloration of the ocellated electric ray is extremely variable , with the only constant being the large ocellus ( " eyespot " ) in the middle of the back . The center of the ocellus is black or yellow , which is surrounded by concentric , alternating dark and light rings that may be either continuous or broken . The remainder of the upper surface is most commonly a shade of light brown with numerous fine dark dots ; there may also be light dots , larger dark spots or blotches , and / or irregular brown marbling . Some individuals are plain light or dark brown with a black ocellus . The portion of the disc in front of the eyes is brown with up to five darker blotches . The dorsal pattern often extends to the ventral fin margins ; the underside is otherwise white to cream @-@ colored . This species grows up to 25 cm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) long . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The ocellated electric ray is common in the tropical coastal waters of the eastern Pacific . Its range extends as far north as the Gulf of California and Bahía San Juanico in Baja California Sur , and as far south as Ecuador . A bottom @-@ dwelling species , it has been recorded from the intertidal zone to a depth of 94 m ( 308 ft ) . The favored habitat of this ray is sandy bays , though it can also be found over rubble bottoms , rocky terrain , and <unk> beds . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 Like the rest of its family , the ocellated electric ray can defend itself by producing a moderate electric shock . During the day , this solitary ray spends most of its time lying partially buried in sand , often near rocky reefs . It becomes more active at night , using its pelvic fins to " hop " along the sea floor . It feeds on small crustaceans such as amphipods and shrimp , as well as polychaete worms . Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium <unk> , A. <unk> , and A. <unk> , and the fluke Anaporrhutum <unk> . Though reproductive details are unknown , the ocellated electric ray is presumably viviparous , with the developing embryos sustained first by yolk and later by maternally produced histotroph ( " uterine milk " ) , as in other electric rays . Females mature sexually at under 19 cm ( 7 @.@ 5 in ) long ; the maturation size for males is unknown . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 The shock from the ocellated electric ray is not dangerous to humans . It occasionally appears in the home aquarium trade , but is difficult to keep because it requires live invertebrates for food . The ocellated electric ray and other electric rays are used as model organisms in biomedical research because their electric organs are rich in ion channels and acetylcholine receptors , which play important roles in the human nervous system . The protein <unk> , which concentrates acetylcholine receptors during human embryonic development , was first isolated from this species . Though the ocellated electric ray is not utilized economically , it is caught incidentally by shrimp trawlers . Its mortality from fishing has not been quantified but is thought to be high , considering that trawling operations in the Atlantic are known to take Diplobatis species in large numbers . The catch rate is also probably underestimated due to problematic identification . Given the restricted range of this species and the intensity of trawling within its habitat , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed it as Vulnerable . 
 = The Gold @-@ Bug = 
 " The Gold @-@ Bug " is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe published in 1843 . The plot follows William Legrand who was bitten by a gold @-@ colored bug . His servant Jupiter fears that Legrand is going insane and goes to Legrand 's friend , an unnamed narrator , who agrees to visit his old friend . Legrand pulls the other two into an adventure after deciphering a secret message that will lead to a buried treasure . 
 The story , set on Sullivan 's Island , South Carolina , is often compared with Poe 's " tales of ratiocination " as an early form of detective fiction . Poe became aware of the public 's interest in secret writing in 1840 and asked readers to challenge his skills as a code @-@ breaker . He took advantage of the popularity of cryptography as he was writing " The Gold @-@ Bug " , and the success of the story centers on one such cryptogram . The characterization of Legrand 's servant Jupiter has been criticized as racist from a modern perspective , especially because his speech is written in dialect and because of his often comical dialogue . 
 Poe submitted " The Gold @-@ Bug " as an entry to a writing contest sponsored by the Philadelphia Dollar Newspaper . His story won the grand prize and was published in three installments , beginning in June 1843 . The prize also included $ 100 , probably the largest single sum that Poe received for any of his works . " The Gold @-@ Bug " was an instant success and was the most popular and most widely read of Poe 's works during his lifetime . It also helped popularize cryptograms and secret writing . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 William Legrand has relocated from New Orleans to Sullivan 's Island in South Carolina after losing his family fortune , and has brought his African @-@ American servant Jupiter with him . The story 's narrator , a friend of Legrand , visits him one evening to see an unusual scarab @-@ like bug he has found . The bug 's weight and lustrous appearance convince Jupiter that it is made of pure gold . Legrand has lent it to an officer stationed at a nearby fort , but he draws a sketch of it for the narrator , with markings on the carapace that resemble a skull . As they discuss the bug , Legrand becomes particularly focused on the sketch and carefully locks it in his desk for safekeeping . Confused , the narrator takes his leave for the night . 
 One month later , Jupiter visits the narrator and asks him to come immediately , fearing that Legrand has been bitten by the bug and gone insane . Once they arrive on the island , Legrand insists that the bug will be the key to restoring his lost fortune . He leads them on an expedition to a particular tree and has Jupiter climb it until he finds a skull nailed at the end of one branch . At Legrand 's direction , Jupiter drops the bug through one eye socket and Legrand paces out to a spot where the group begins to dig . Finding nothing there , Legrand has Jupiter climb the tree again and drop the bug through the skull 's other eye ; they choose a different spot to dig , this time finding two skeletons and a chest filled with gold coins and jewelry . They estimate the total value at $ 1 @.@ 5 million , but even that figure proves to be below the actual worth when they eventually sell the items . 
 Legrand explains that on the day he found the bug on the mainland coastline , Jupiter had picked up a scrap piece of parchment to wrap it up . Legrand kept the scrap and used it to sketch the bug for the narrator ; in so doing , though , he noticed traces of invisible ink , revealed by the heat of the fire burning on the hearth . The parchment proved to contain a cryptogram , which Legrand deciphered as a set of directions for finding a treasure buried by the infamous pirate " Captain Kidd . " The final step involved dropping a slug or weight through the left eye of the skull in the tree ; their first dig failed because Jupiter mistakenly dropped it through the right eye instead . Legrand muses that the skeletons may be the remains of two members of Kidd 's crew , who buried the chest and were then killed to silence them .

 Legrand determined that the " bishop 's hostel " referred to the site of an ancient manor house , where he found a narrow ledge that roughly resembled a chair ( the " devil 's seat " ) . Using a telescope and sighting at the given bearing , he spotted something white among the branches of a large tree ; this proved to be the skull through which a weight had to be dropped from the left eye in order to find the treasure . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 " The Gold @-@ Bug " includes a cipher that uses a simple substitution cipher . Though he did not invent " secret writing " or cryptography ( he was probably inspired by an interest in Daniel Defoe 's Robinson Crusoe ) , Poe certainly popularized it during his time . To most people in the 19th century , cryptography was mysterious and those able to break the codes were considered gifted with nearly supernatural ability . Poe had drawn attention to it as a novelty over four months in the Philadelphia publication Alexander 's Weekly Messenger in 1840 . He had asked readers to submit their own substitution ciphers , boasting he could solve all of them with little effort . The challenge brought about , as Poe wrote , " a very lively interest among the numerous readers of the journal . Letters poured in upon the editor from all parts of the country . " In July 1841 , Poe published " A Few Words on Secret Writing " and , realizing the interest in the topic , wrote " The Gold @-@ Bug " as one of the few pieces of literature to incorporate ciphers as part of the story . Poe 's character Legrand 's explanation of his ability to solve the cipher is very like Poe 's explanation in " A Few Words on Secret Writing " . 
 The actual " gold @-@ bug " in the story is not a real insect . Instead , Poe combined characteristics of two insects found in the area where the story takes place . The <unk> splendidum , though not technically a scarab but a species of longhorn beetle ( <unk> ) , has a gold head and slightly gold @-@ tinted body . The black spots noted on the back of the fictional bug can be found on the <unk> <unk> , a click beetle also native to Sullivan 's Island . 
 Poe 's depiction of the African servant Jupiter is often considered stereotypical and racist from a modern perspective . Jupiter is depicted as superstitious and so lacking in intelligence that he cannot tell his left from his right . Poe probably included the character after being inspired by a similar character in Sheppard Lee ( 1836 ) by Robert Montgomery Bird , which he had reviewed . Black characters in fiction during this time period were not unusual , but Poe 's choice to give him a speaking role was . Critics and scholars , however , question if Jupiter 's accent was authentic or merely comic relief , suggesting it was not similar to accents used by blacks in Charleston but possibly inspired by Gullah . 
 Though the story is often included amongst the short list of detective stories by Poe , " The Gold @-@ Bug " is not technically detective fiction because Legrand withholds the evidence until after the solution is given . Nevertheless , the Legrand character is often compared to Poe 's fictional detective C. Auguste Dupin due to his use of " ratiocination " . " <unk> " , a term Poe used to describe Dupin 's method , is the process by which Dupin detects what others have not seen or what others have deemed unimportant . 
 = = Publication history and reception = = 
 Poe originally sold " The Gold @-@ Bug " to George Rex Graham for Graham 's Magazine for $ 52 but asked for it back when he heard about a writing contest sponsored by Philadelphia 's Dollar Newspaper . Incidentally , Poe did not return the money to Graham and instead offered to make it up to him with reviews he would write . Poe won the grand prize ; in addition to winning $ 100 , the story was published in two installments on June 21 and June 28 , 1843 , in the newspaper . His $ 100 payment from the newspaper may have been the most he was paid for a single work . Anticipating a positive public response , the Dollar Newspaper took out a copyright on " The Gold @-@ Bug " prior to publication . 
 The story was republished in three installments in the Saturday Courier in Philadelphia on June 24 , July 1 , and July 8 , the last two appeared on the front page and included illustrations by F. O. C. Darley . Further reprintings in United States newspapers made " The Gold @-@ Bug " Poe 's most widely read short story during his lifetime . By May 1844 , Poe reported that it had circulated 300 @,@ 000 copies , though he was probably not paid for these reprints . It also helped increase his popularity as a lecturer . One lecture in Philadelphia after " The Gold @-@ Bug " was published drew such a large crowd that hundreds were turned away . As Poe wrote in a letter in 1848 , it " made a great noise . " He would later compare the public success of " The Gold @-@ Bug " with " The Raven " , though he admitted " the bird beat the bug " . 
 The Public Ledger in Philadelphia called it " a capital story " . George Lippard wrote in the Citizen Soldier that the story was " characterised by thrilling interest and a graphic though sketchy power of description . It is one of the best stories that Poe ever wrote . " Graham 's Magazine printed a review in 1845 which called the story " quite remarkable as an instance of intellectual acuteness and subtlety of reasoning " . Thomas Dunn English wrote in the <unk> in October 1845 that " The Gold @-@ Bug " probably had a greater circulation than any other American story and " perhaps it is the most ingenious story Mr. POE has written ; but ... it is not at all comparable to the ' Tell @-@ tale Heart ' — and more especially to ' Ligeia ' " . Poe 's friend Thomas Holley Chivers said that " The Gold @-@ Bug " ushered in " the Golden Age of Poe 's Literary Life " . 
 The popularity of the story also brought controversy . Within a month of its publication , Poe was accused of conspiring with the prize committee by Philadelphia 's Daily Forum . The publication called " The Gold @-@ Bug " an " abortion " and " unmitigated trash " worth no more than $ 15 . Poe filed for a libel lawsuit against editor Francis Duffee . It was later dropped and Duffee apologized for suggesting Poe did not earn the $ 100 prize . Editor John Du <unk> accused Poe of stealing the idea for " The Gold @-@ Bug " from " <unk> ; or the Pirate 's Treasure " , a story written by a schoolgirl named Miss Sherburne . 
 " The Gold @-@ Bug " was republished as the first story in the Wiley & Putnam collection of Poe 's Tales in June 1845 , followed by " The Black Cat " and ten other stories . The success of this collection inspired the first French translation of " The Gold @-@ Bug " published in November 1845 by Alphonse <unk> in the Revue <unk> under the title , " Le <unk> d 'or " , becoming the first literal translation of a Poe story into a foreign language . In the French version , the enciphered message remained in English , with a parenthesized translation supplied alongside its solution . The story was translated into Russian from that version two years later , marking Poe 's literary debut in that country . In 1856 , Charles Baudelaire published his translation of the tale in the first volume of Histoires <unk> . Baudelaire was very influential in introducing Poe 's work to Europe and his translations became the definitive renditions throughout the continent . 
 = = Influence = = 
 " The Gold @-@ Bug " inspired Robert Louis Stevenson in his novel about treasure @-@ hunting , Treasure Island ( 1883 ) . Stevenson acknowledged this influence : " I broke into the gallery of Mr. Poe ... No doubt the skeleton [ in my novel ] is conveyed from Poe . " 
 Poe played a major role in popularizing cryptograms in newspapers and magazines in his time period and beyond . William F. Friedman , America 's foremost cryptologist , initially became interested in cryptography after reading " The Gold @-@ Bug " as a child — interest that he later put to use in deciphering Japan 's <unk> code during World War II . " The Gold @-@ Bug " also includes the first use of the term " <unk> " ( as opposed to " cryptogram " ) . 
 Poe had been stationed at Fort Moultrie from November 1827 through December 1828 and utilized his personal experience at Sullivan 's Island in recreating the setting for " The Gold @-@ Bug " . It was also here that Poe first heard the stories of pirates like Captain Kidd . The residents of Sullivan 's Island embrace this connection to Poe and have named their public library after him . Local legend in Charleston says that the poem " Annabel Lee " was also inspired by Poe 's time in South Carolina . Poe also set part of " The Balloon @-@ Hoax " and " The Oblong Box " in this vicinity . 
 O. Henry alludes to the stature of " The Gold @-@ Bug " within the buried @-@ treasure genre in his short story " Supply and Demand " . One character learns that the main characters are searching for treasure , and he asks them if they have been reading Edgar Allan Poe . The title of Richard Powers ' 1991 novel The Gold Bug Variations is derived from " The Gold @-@ Bug " and from Bach 's composition Goldberg Variations , and the novel incorporates part of the short story 's plot . 
 Jewish Russian author David <unk> @-@ Petrov published " The House of Edgar Allan Poe " in 2011 Prose , with " The Gold Bug " serving as a major influence . <unk> @-@ Petrov includes a beetle , also tied to a string , which finds treasure in the basement of the house of Sarah Helen Whitman , Poe 's love interest who lived in Providence , Rhode Island .

 The story proved popular enough in its day that a stage version opened on August 8 , 1843 . The production was put together by Silas S. Steele and was performed at the American Theatre in Philadelphia . The editor of the Philadelphia newspaper The Spirit of the Times said that the performance " dragged , and was rather tedious . The frame work was well enough , but wanted filling up " . 
 In film and television , an adaptation of the work appeared on Your Favorite Story on February 1 , 1953 ( Season 1 , Episode 4 ) . It was directed by Robert Florey with the teleplay written by Robert <unk> . A later adaptation of the work appeared on ABC Weekend Special on February 2 , 1980 ( Season 3 , Episode 7 ) .

 = Sarcoscypha coccinea = 
 Sarcoscypha coccinea , commonly known as the scarlet elf cup , scarlet elf cap , or the scarlet cup , is a species of fungus in the family Sarcoscyphaceae of the order Pezizales . The fungus , widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere , has been found in Africa , Asia , Europe , North and South America , and Australia . The type species of the genus Sarcoscypha , S. coccinea has been known by many names since its first appearance in the scientific literature in 1772 . Phylogenetic analysis shows the species to be most closely related to other Sarcoscypha species that contain numerous small oil droplets in their spores , such as the North Atlantic island species S. macaronesica . Due to similar physical appearances and sometimes overlapping distributions , S. coccinea has often been confused with S. occidentalis , S. austriaca , and S. dudleyi . 
 The saprobic fungus grows on decaying sticks and branches in damp spots on forest floors , generally buried under leaf litter or in the soil . The cup @-@ shaped fruit bodies are usually produced during the cooler months of winter and early spring . The brilliant red interior of the cups — from which both the common and scientific names are derived — contrasts with the lighter @-@ colored exterior . The edibility of the fruit bodies is not clearly established , but its small size , tough texture and insubstantial fruitings would dissuade most people from collecting for the table . The fungus has been used medicinally by the Oneida Indians , and also as a colorful component of table decorations in England . Molliardiomyces eucoccinea is the name given to the imperfect form of the fungus that lacks a sexually reproductive stage in its life cycle . 
 = = Taxonomy , naming , and phylogeny = = 
 The species was originally named Helvella coccinea by the Italian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1772 . Other early names include Peziza coccinea ( Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin , 1774 ) and Peziza <unk> ( Theodor Holmskjold , 1799 ) . Although some authors in older literature have applied the generic name Plectania to the taxon following Karl Fuckel 's 1870 name change ( e.g. Seaver , 1928 ; <unk> , 1948 ; Nannfeldt , 1949 ; Le Gal , 1953 ) , that name is now used for a fungus with brownish @-@ black fruit bodies . Sarcoscypha coccinea was given its current name by Jean Baptiste <unk> <unk> in 1889 . 
 Obligate synonyms ( different names for the same species based on one type ) include <unk> coccinea Gillet ( 1880 ) , Macroscyphus coccineus Gray ( 1821 ) , and Peziza <unk> Holmskjold ( 1799 ) . Taxonomic synonyms ( different names for the same species , based on different types ) include Peziza aurantia Schumacher ( 1803 ) , Peziza aurantiaca Persoon ( 1822 ) , Peziza coccinea Jacquin ( 1774 ) , Helvella coccinea Schaeffer ( 1774 ) , <unk> coccinea Phillips ( 1887 ) , Geopyxis coccinea Massee ( 1895 ) , Sarcoscypha coccinea Saccardo ex Durand ( 1900 ) , Plectania coccinea ( Fuckel ex Seaver ) , and Peziza <unk> Batsch ( 1783 ) . 
 Sarcoscypha coccinea is the type species of the genus Sarcoscypha , having been first explicitly designated as such in 1931 by Frederick Clements and Cornelius Lott Shear . A 1990 publication revealed that the genus name Sarcoscypha had been used previously by Carl F. P. von Martius as the name of a tribe in the genus Peziza ; according to the rules of Botanical Nomenclature , this meant that the generic name Peziza had priority over Sarcoscypha . To address the taxonomical dilemma , the genus name Sarcoscypha was conserved against Peziza , with S. coccinea as the type species , to " avoid the creation of a new generic name for the scarlet cups and also to avoid the disadvantageous loss of a generic name widely used in the popular and scientific literature " . The specific epithet coccinea is derived from the Latin word meaning " deep red " . The species is commonly known as the " scarlet elf cup " , the " scarlet elf cap " , or the " scarlet cup fungus " . 
 S. coccinea var. jurana was described by Jean Boudier ( 1903 ) as a variety of the species having a brighter and more orange @-@ colored fruit body , and with flattened or blunt @-@ ended ascospores . Today it is known as the distinct species S. jurana . S. coccinea var. albida , named by George Edward Massee in 1903 ( as Geopyxis coccinea var. albida ) , has a cream @-@ colored rather than red interior surface , but is otherwise identical to the typical variety . 
 Within the large area that includes the temperate to alpine @-@ boreal zone of the Northern Hemisphere ( Europe and North America ) , only S. coccinea had been recognized until the 1980s . However , it had been known since the early 1900s that there existed several macroscopically indistinguishable taxa with various microscopic differences : the distribution and number of oil droplets in fresh spores ; germination behavior ; and spore shape . Detailed analysis and comparison of fresh specimens revealed that what had been collectively called " S. coccinea " actually consisted of four distinct species : S. austriaca , S. coccinea , S. dudleyi , and S. jurana . 
 The phylogenetic relationships in the genus Sarcoscypha were analyzed by Francis Harrington in the late 1990s . Her cladistic analysis combined comparisons of the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer in the non @-@ functional RNA with fifteen traditional morphological characteristics , such as spore features , fruit body shape , and degree of curliness of the " hairs " that form the tomentum . Based on her analysis , S. coccinea is part of a clade that includes the species S. austriaca , S. macaronesica , S. <unk> and S. <unk> . All of these Sarcoscypha species have numerous , small oil droplets in their spores . Its closest relative , S. macaronesica , is found on the Canary Islands and Madeira ; Harrington hypothesized that the most recent common ancestor of the two species originated in Europe and was later dispersed to the Macaronesian islands . 
 = = Description = = 
 Initially spherical , the fruit bodies are later shallowly <unk> or cup @-@ shaped with rolled @-@ in rims , and measure 2 – 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 2 @.@ 0 in ) in diameter . The inner surface of the cup is deep red ( fading to orange when dry ) and smooth , while the outer surface is whitish and covered with a dense matted layer of tiny hairs ( a tomentum ) . The stipe , when present , is stout and up to 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) long ( if deeply buried ) by 0 @.@ 3 – 0 @.@ 7 cm ( 0 @.@ 1 – 0 @.@ 3 in ) thick , and whitish , with a tomentum . Color variants of the fungus exist that have reduced or absent pigmentation ; these forms may be orange , yellow , or even white ( as in the variety albida ) . In the Netherlands , white fruit bodies have been found growing in the polders . 
 Sarcoscypha coccinea is one of several fungi whose fruit bodies have been noted to make a " puffing " sound — an audible manifestation of spore @-@ discharge where thousands of asci simultaneously explode to release a cloud of spores . 
 Spores are 26 – 40 by 10 – 12 µm , elliptical , smooth , hyaline ( translucent ) , and have small lipid droplets concentrated at either end . The droplets are refractive to light and visible with light microscopy . In older , dried specimens ( such as herbarium material ) , the droplets may coalesce and hinder the identification of species . Depending on their geographical origin , the spores may have a delicate mucilaginous sheath or " envelope " ; European specimens are devoid of an envelope while specimens from North America invariably have one . 
 The asci are long and cylindrical , and taper into a short stem @-@ like base ; they measure 300 – 375 by 14 – 16 µm . Although in most Pezizales all of the ascospores are formed simultaneously through delimitation by an inner and outer membrane , in S. coccinea the ascospores located in the basal parts of the ascus develop faster . The paraphyses ( sterile filamentous hyphae present in the hymenium ) are about 3 µm wide ( and only slightly thickened at the apex ) , and contain red pigment granules . 
 = = = Anamorph form = = = 
 Anamorphic or imperfect fungi are those that seem to lack a sexual stage in their life cycle , and typically reproduce by the process of mitosis in structures called conidia . In some cases , the sexual stage — or teleomorph stage — is later identified , and a teleomorph @-@ anamorph relationship is established between the species . The International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants permits the recognition of two ( or more ) names for one and the same organism , one based on the teleomorph , the other ( s ) restricted to the anamorph . The name of the anamorphic state of S. coccinea is Molliardiomyces eucoccinea , first described by Marin Molliard in 1904 . Molliard found the growth of the conidia to resemble those of the genera Coryne and <unk> rather than the Pezizaceae , and he considered that this suggested an affinity between Sarcoscypha and the family Helvellaceae . In 1972 , John W. Paden again described the anamorph , but like Molliard , failed to give a complete description of the species . In 1984 , Paden created a new genus he named Molliardiomyces to contain the anamorphic forms of several Sarcoscypha species , and set Molliardiomyces eucoccinea as the type species . This form produces colorless conidiophores ( specialized stalks that bear conidia ) that are usually irregularly branched , measuring 30 – 110 by 3 @.@ 2 – 4 @.@ 7 µm . The conidia are ellipsoidal to egg @-@ shaped , smooth , translucent ( hyaline ) , and 4 @.@ 8 – 16 @.@ 0 by 2 @.@ 3 – 5 @.@ 8 µm ; they tend to accumulate in " mucilaginous masses " . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Similar species include S. dudleyi and S. austriaca , and in the literature , confusion amongst the three is common . Examination of microscopic features is often required to definitively differentiate between the species . Sarcoscypha occidentalis has smaller cups ( 0 @.@ 5 – 2 @.@ 0 cm wide ) , a more pronounced stalk that is 1 – 3 cm long , and a smooth exterior surface . Unlike S. coccinea , it is only found in the New World and in east and midwest North America , but not in the far west . It also occurs in Central America and the Caribbean . In North America , S. austriaca and S. dudleyi are found in eastern regions of the continent . S. dudleyi has elliptical spores with rounded ends that are 25 – 33 by 12 – 14 µm and completely sheathed when fresh . S. austriaca has elliptical spores that are 29 – 36 by 12 – 15 µm that are not completely sheathed when fresh , but have small polar caps on either end . The Macaronesian species S. macaronesica , frequently misidentified as S. coccinea , has smaller spores , typically measuring 20 @.@ 5 – 28 by 7 @.@ 3 – 11 µm and smaller fruit bodies — up to 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) wide . 
 = = Ecology , habitat and distribution = = 
 A saprobic species , Sarcoscypha coccinea grows on decaying woody material from various plants : the rose family , beech , hazel , willow , elm , and , in the Mediterranean , oak . The fruit bodies of S. coccinea are often found growing singly or clustered in groups on buried or partly buried sticks in deciduous forests . A Hungarian study noted that the fungus was found mainly on twigs of European hornbeam ( Carpinus betulus ) that were typically less than 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) long . Fruit bodies growing on sticks above the ground tend to be smaller than those on buried wood . Mushrooms that are sheltered from wind also grow larger than their more exposed counterparts . The fruit bodies are persistent and may last for several weeks if the weather is cool . The time required for the development of fruit bodies has been estimated to be about 24 weeks , although it was noted that " the maximum life span may well be more than 24 weeks because the decline of the colonies seemed to be associated more with sunny , windy weather rather than with old age . " One field guide calls the fungus " a welcome sight after a long , desperate winter and ... the harbinger of a new year of <unk> . " 
 Common over much of the Northern Hemisphere , S. coccinea occurs in the Midwest , in the valleys between the Pacific coast , the Sierra Nevada , and the Cascade Range . Its North American distribution extends north to various locations in Canada and south to the Mexican state Jalisco . The fungus has also been collected from Chile in South America . It is also found in the Old World — Europe , Africa , Asia , Australia , and India . Specimens collected from the Macaronesian islands that once thought to be S. coccinea were later determined to be the distinct species S. macaronesica . A 1995 study of the occurrence of British Sarcoscypha ( including S. coccinea and S. austriaca ) concluded that S. coccinea was becoming very rare in Great Britain . All species of Sarcoscypha , including S. coccinea , are Red @-@ Listed in Europe . In Turkey , it is considered critically endangered . 
 = = Chemistry = = 
 The red color of the fruit bodies is caused by five types of carotenoid pigments , including <unk> and β @-@ carotene . Carotenoids are lipid @-@ soluble and are stored within granules in the paraphyses . British @-@ Canadian mycologist Arthur Henry Reginald Buller suggested that pigments in fruit bodies exposed to the Sun absorb some of the Sun 's rays , raising the temperature of the hymenium — hastening the development of the ascus and subsequent spore discharge . 
 Lectins are sugar @-@ binding proteins that are used in blood typing , biochemical studies and medical research . A lectin has been purified and characterized from S. coccinea fruit bodies that can bind selectively to several specific carbohydrate molecules , including lactose . 
 = = Uses = = 
 Sarcoscypha coccinea was used as a medicinal fungus by the Oneida Indians , and possibly by other tribes of the Iroquois Six Nations . The fungus , after being dried and ground up into a powder , was applied as a styptic , particularly to the navels of newborn children that were not healing properly after the umbilical cord had been severed . Pulverized fruit bodies were also kept under bandages made of soft @-@ tanned deerskin . In Scarborough , England , the fruit bodies used to be arranged with moss and leaves and sold as a table decoration . 
 The species is said to be edible , inedible , or " not recommended " , depending on the author . Although its insubstantial fruit body and low numbers do not make it particularly suitable for the table , one source claims " children in the Jura are said to eat it raw on bread and butter ; and one French author suggests adding the cups , with a little Kirsch , to a fresh fruit salad . " The fruit bodies have been noted to be a source of food for rodents in the winter , and slugs in the summer .

In a review of Supernatural for Entertainment Weekly , Considine later commended the " throaty emotionalism " with which Des 'ree sang " Kissing You " . Jim Farber from the Daily News noted the song as the standout track from Supernatural and claimed that it " stands as the only track to deepen the mood , bringing out the indigo pleasures of her voice . " The Richmond Times @-@ Dispatch 's Kate Lipper called the record " an excellent slow song that you can play nonstop " . However , Ann Powers from The New York Times wrote that Des 'ree is too melodramatic on " Kissing You " .

Two of the conditions of the proposal were that the song 's title remain the same , and that the song was not published in video form . Beyoncé made no further contact with the Royalty Network , and planned to release " Still in Love ( Kissing You ) " and its video , regardless of the two requested conditions , which the Royalty Network called " completely unacceptable " . The publishing company requested that Sony Music Entertainment ( SME ) — the parent company of Columbia Records — halt distribution of B 'Day with the retitled song . Nevertheless , the album was released on 3 April 2007 ; the Royalty Network considered the action " willful disregard " , and retracted their permission to use the song . The lawsuit , filed on 16 April 2007 in the District Court for the Southern District of New York , sought US $ 150 @,@ 000 in damages and a recall of the infringing material . The same day , SME ceased distribution of both the deluxe edition of B 'Day and the anthology video album , although the editions had sold over 214 @,@ 000 copies before the recall . Later reissues of the albums did not include " Still in Love ( Kissing You ) " and its video , with " If " replacing the track on the B 'Day deluxe edition .

 The guest actors who appeared in " Demons " were joined by Derek Magyar and Eric Pierpoint , who appeared earlier in the season in " Affliction " , while Joel <unk> had previously appeared in episodes of Deep Space Nine and The Next Generation . The script called for a reference to the United States space program and so the Carl Sagan Memorial Station and the Mars Exploration Rover Sojourner were included in a shot added in post production . " Terra Prime " received a Nielsen rating of 2 @.@ 0 / 4 % and it was praised by critics who described it as a " real " episode and there were suggestions that had Enterprise gone into a further season then the story could have acted as an ongoing subplot .

 Judith and Garfield Reeves @-@ Stevens created the story with André Bormanis and developed it into a script with show runner Manny Coto . Because of the nature of the two @-@ part episode , revisions to the scripts for both " Demons " and " Terra Prime " were required as changes occurred in the other script . The Reeves @-@ Stevens felt that a " ticking clock " was required for " Terra Prime " , and so the 24 @-@ hour deadline set by Paxton 's group was written into the end of " Demons " . However , that exact ending was changed on several occasions which resulted in modifications to the " Terra Prime " script . Other changes were made following the filming of " Demons " as the Reeves @-@ Stevens changed some of the dialogue for Paxton after seeing Peter Weller 's performance . Shran , played by Jeffrey Combs , was written out of the episode as the decision was made to have the character appear in the series finale instead . 
 Filming began on " Terra Prime " on the afternoon of February 15 , 2005 and continued until February 25 . It was the second episode to be directed by Marvin Rush , who had previously worked on the second part of " In a Mirror , Darkly " . Rush was normally the director of photography on Enterprise . Whilst the majority of sets created for the Martian array had been created for the previous episode , a set was created to appear as an access tube specially for use in " Terra Prime " . In order to represent the shuttlecraft entering the comet , rather than using camera movement , the set was placed on rollers and physically moved to appear turbulent . The Martian landscape was inserted using a green screen where the away team enter the array , and the actors had make @-@ up applied to represent the red dust of the Martian landscape . 
 Several guest stars who had appeared in " Demons " continued in their roles in " Terra Prime " ; Harry Groener , Peter Mensah , Adam Clark along with Weller and Watts . A reference to Weller 's former show Odyssey 5 is included in the episode , when his character is diagnosed with " Taggart 's Syndrome " , where Taggart was the name of his character on Odyssey 5 . They were joined in this episode by several actors playing recurring roles , including Gary Graham who had played Ambassador Soval since the series pilot and Derek Magyar and Eric Pierpoint , who had played Commander Kelby and Harris respectively earlier in the season in " Affliction " . Joel <unk> also appeared in " Terra Prime " as an Andorian Ambassador , who had previously appeared in the pilot of Star Trek : Deep Space Nine and the The Next Generation episode " Firstborn " as well as performing voice roles for several Star Trek video games . The baby in the episode was played by a pair of twins , whilst the pointed Vulcan ears were applied to the child in post production . 
 The script requested two post production shots to be added as references to the American space program , which would have been shown as the shuttlepod landed on Mars . These included the Mars Exploration Rover Sojourner which appeared in the opening titles of Enterprise , now lying dormant and covered in dust . A further shot showed a plaque which denoted the landing spot of the rover on board the Carl Sagan Memorial Station . Following the cancellation of the series two episodes earlier , Coto stated that he considered " Demons " and " Terra Prime " to be the actual finale of the Enterprise storyline , rather than the final aired episode " These Are the Voyages ... which would be a goodbye to the franchise . " 
 = = Reception and home media release = = 
 " Terra Prime " was first aired in the United States on UPN on May 13 , 2005 . The broadcast saw the episode come in fifth place during the timeslot , with a Nielsen rating of 2 @.@ 0 / 4 . This means that it was seen by 2 percent of all households , and 4 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast . It gained higher ratings than The WB , which aired re @-@ runs of What I Like About You and Reba , but was behind the other four major networks with a CBS special on Elvis Presley receiving ratings of 7 @.@ 8 / 14 . This was the same ratings received by " Demons " , but was less than the final episode , " These Are the Voyages ... " which received ratings of 2 @.@ 4 / 4 when it was aired immediately after " Terra Prime " . 
 Michelle Erica Green reviewed the episode for TrekNation , saying that it felt like a " real Star Trek episode " but wasn 't sure about the characterisation for T 'Pol seen in " Terra Prime " . She would have preferred to see more of Mars , but was pleased with the glimpse of the Carl Sagan Memorial Station . She summed it up by saying that the two episodes were " no means perfect episodes , but they 're reaching very earnestly for what Star Trek was in the beginning " . Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website " Jammer 's Reviews " said that while there were plot holes in the story , and that elements were clumsy such as the showdown towards the end , the overall story was " sound " . He said that the episode was a " much more satisfying as a send @-@ off for the Enterprise crew " than " These Are the Voyages ... " . He gave " Terra Prime " a score of three out of four . 
 The review from IGN said that " In a perfect world , Enterprise would have gotten another year and could have used Terra Prime as a running subplot . " While they thought that the message was heavy @-@ handed , it was the type of stories that Enterprise should have been covering all along . They gave " Demons " and " Terra Prime " a score of four out of five . Jay Garmon , whilst compiling a list of the best episodes of Enterprise , listed " Demons " and " Terra Prime " as the third best . He thought that Peter Weller " stole the show " , and that it created a " solid conclusion " to the show despite the following episode , " These Are the Voyages ... " . Empire magazine ranked " Terra Prime " as the best episode of the series . 
 " Terra Prime " was released on home media in the United States on November 1 , 2005 , as part of the season four DVD box set of Enterprise . The Blu @-@ ray edition was released on April 1 , 2014 . 
 = Castell y Bere = 
 Castell y Bere is a Welsh castle near Llanfihangel @-@ y @-@ pennant in Gwynedd , Wales . Constructed by Llywelyn the Great in the 1220s , the stone castle was intended to maintain his authority over the local people and to defend the south @-@ west part of the princedom of Gwynedd . In 1282 war with Edward I of England resulted in the death of Llywelyn 's grandson , Llywelyn ap Gruffudd , and Castell y Bere fell to English forces . Edward I expanded the castle further and established a small town beside it . In 1294 the Welsh leader Madoc ap Llywelyn mounted a major revolt and the castle was besieged and apparently burnt . Edward did not repair it and it became ruined . Today it is in the hands of Cadw and operated as a tourist attraction . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 1220 @-@ 40 = = = 
 Castell y Bere Castle was built in the 1220s by Llywelyn the Great on a rocky hillock overlooking the Dysynni Valley , near Llanfihangel @-@ y @-@ pennant . Traditionally the Welsh princes had not constructed castles , instead using undefended palaces called <unk> , or courts . From the late 11th century onwards , the Normans had advanced into Wales , taking lands in the north and establishing a band of occupied territory in the south called the Welsh Marches . During the 12th century some timber and earthwork castles began to be built , but in small numbers . 
 Llywelyn the Great initially controlled the princedom of Gwynedd , but grew more powerful over the course of his reign , extending his influence over much of Wales during the early years of the 13th century . Llywelyn was faced by several challenges , including dealing with the threat from the kings of England , and maintaining his authority over the native Welsh . 
 In 1221 Llywelyn took control of neighbouring Meirionnydd from his son , Gruffydd ; Llywelyn had previously placed Gruffydd in power there , but the father and son had fallen out . The prince then began to build the castle of Castell y Bere with the intent of controlling the local population and securing his new south @-@ west border , which included the mountain trade routes between Gwynedd , Powys <unk> and Deheubarth . Castell y Bere was the first of several stone castles built by Llywelyn and the initial castle consisted of several towers positioned around a courtyard , situated on a rocky hillock in the Dysynni Valley near Cadair Idris . 
 = = = 1240 @-@ 1300 = = = 
 Following Llywelyn 's death in 1240 , Gwynedd 's power declined and many of its eastern lands were taken by Henry III of England in 1247 . Llywelyn 's grandson , Llywelyn ap Gruffudd , took power in 1255 and imprisoned his brother Owain ap Gruffudd before extending his power across Wales . Llywelyn extended the castle with an additional tower to the south , similar to that built at <unk> , probably in order to provide additional accommodation . 
 The conflict between the Welsh princes and the English kings continued in the reign Edward I. In 1282 Llywelyn fought a final campaign against Edward , ending in the prince 's death near Builth that December . His brother , Dafydd ap Gruffydd , assumed power but during 1283 was forced south into Snowdonia . Meanwhile , forces under the command of Roger Lestrange and William de Valence marched from south Wales and Shropshire , placing Castell y Bere under siege and taking it on 25 April . Edward deployed 7 @,@ 000 troops to detain Dafydd who was finally captured and executed in October . A team of five masons and five carpenters , under the command of Master Bertram the Engineer , were left at Castell y Bere to conduct unspecified work after the English army had left . 
 Edward continued to invest money and time in Castell y Bere ; he visited three times in 1284 , establishing a small town alongside the castle , possibly just to the east . Walter of <unk> was appointed the constable of the castle by Edward in 1284 and spent £ 47 building a new chamber there , potentially for the king to use during visits . Another £ 262 was spent between 1286 and 1290 , most of this in the year following the revolt of Rhys ap Maredudd . A pair of linking walls to the south tower was probably built around this time , and the external barbican and gate towers may also have been built at this time . 
 In 1294 , however , the Welsh leader Madoc ap Llywelyn mounted a major revolt across Wales . Richard Fitzalan , the Earl of Arundel , was ordered in mid @-@ October to ensure that the castle was secure , but by late October the castle was under siege from Madoc 's forces . Robert FitzWalter , the castle 's constable , was sent to lead a relief expedition . The final fate of Castell y Bere is uncertain , but it was probably taken by Welsh forces in late 1294 and subsequently burnt . 
 = = = 14th @-@ 21st century = = = 
 Following the revolt Castell de Bere and the new English town were both abandoned . While the castle was well situated , unlike the other new coastal castles built by Edward I it could not be provisioned by sea and as a result did not fit well into his plan for controlling North Wales . By the 16th century the castle had lapsed into a state of decay , and the Welsh poet Gruffydd <unk> observed that " on the banks of the river Dysynni is Castell @-@ y @-@ Bere , where stood a large strong building but which is now destroyed and cast to the ground " . 
 After many years , the site was finally cleared of undergrowth in the 1850s , revealing more of the castle 's remains , and William Wynne , the owner of the site , carried out the first archaeological investigations . In 1949 Charles Corbett , the last private owner of the ruins , placed them into the guardianship of the state . In the 21st century the site is in the care of Cadw and is protected as a scheduled monument and maintained as a tourist attraction . In the light of Welsh devolution and other political changes , the history of Castell y Bere and similar Welsh castles has become increasing prominent . In response , Cadw have noted that they intend to give an increased priority to communicating the history of these castles and the Welsh princes . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 Today the ruins of Castell y Bere still stand on a rocky outcrop , with protective ditches cut into the stone on the south and east sides . The entrance to the castle lies on the west side , where the barbican , probably built by Edward I , contains two <unk> , overlooking the stone steps approaching the inner gate . Through the barbican is the castle courtyard , containing a large well and the remains of several internal buildings of uncertain date . 
 The north tower is an apsidal , or " D @-@ shaped " , design that is characteristic of Welsh castles of the early 13th century . Originally it may have contained either a hall or a chapel . What is today the middle tower was originally the southernmost part of the defences , but now leads through the Edwardian ditch yard to the south tower , another apsidal design that once contained spacious accommodation . Both the apsidal towers lacked fireplaces in the main chambers , instead using central heaths to heat the rooms . 
 Unusually for an early Welsh castle , there is evidence of decorative sculpture , including statues of soldiers , having been built into the castle , along with decorative floor tiles . Castell y Bere is the only castle , other than Criccieth , to display such features . Historian Lawrence Butler considers that the castle has delivered some of " some of the finest stone carving from thirteenth @-@ century Wales " .

 = Indigo bunting = 
 The indigo bunting ( Passerina cyanea ) is a small seed @-@ eating bird in the family Cardinalidae . It is migratory , ranging from southern Canada to northern Florida during the breeding season , and from southern Florida to northern South America during the winter . It often migrates by night , using the stars to navigate . Its habitat is farmland , brush areas , and open woodland . The indigo bunting is closely related to the lazuli bunting and interbreeds with the species where their ranges overlap . 
 The indigo bunting is a small bird , with a length of 11 @.@ 5 – 13 cm ( 4 @.@ 5 – 5 @.@ 1 in ) . It displays sexual dimorphism in its coloration ; the male is a vibrant blue in the summer and a brown color during the winter months , while the female is brown year @-@ round . The male displays brightly colored plumage during the breeding season to attract a mate . Nest @-@ building and incubation are done solely by the female . The diet of the indigo bunting consists primarily of insects during the summer months and seeds during the winter months . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The indigo bunting is included in the family Cardinalidae , which is made up of passerine birds found in North and South America , and is one of seven birds in the genus Passerina . It was originally described as Tanagra cyanea by Linnaeus in his 18th @-@ century work , Systema Naturae . The current genus name , Passerina , is derived from the Latin term passer for true sparrows and similar small birds , while the species name , cyanea , is from the Latin word meaning dark or sea blue . 
 The indigo bunting is closely related to the lazuli bunting and interbreeds with the species where their ranges overlap , in the Great Plains . They were declared to form a superspecies by the American Ornithologists ' Union in 1983 . However , according to sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome @-@ b gene of members of the genus Passerina , it was determined that the indigo bunting and lazuli bunting are not , in fact , sister taxa . The indigo bunting is the sister of two sister groups , a “ blue ” ( lazuli bunting and blue grosbeak ) and a “ painted ” ( Rosita 's bunting , orange @-@ breasted bunting , varied bunting , and painted bunting ) clade . This genetic study shows these species diverged between 4 @.@ 1 and 7 @.@ 3 million years ago . This timing , which is consistent with fossil evidence , coincides with a late @-@ Miocene cooling , which caused the evolution of a variety of western grassland habitats . Evolving to reduce size may have allowed buntings to exploit grass seeds as a food source . 
 = = Description = = 
 The indigo bunting is a smallish songbird , around the size of a small sparrow . It measures 11 @.@ 5 – 15 cm ( 4 @.@ 5 – 5 @.@ 9 in ) long , with a wingspan of 18 – 23 cm ( 7 @.@ 1 – 9 @.@ 1 in ) . Body mass averages 14 @.@ 5 g ( 0 @.@ 51 oz ) , with a reported range of 11 @.@ 2 – 21 @.@ 4 g ( 0 @.@ 40 – 0 @.@ 75 oz ) . During the breeding season , the adult male appears mostly a vibrant cerulean blue . Only the head is indigo . The wings and tail are black with cerulean blue edges . In fall and winter plumage , the male has brown edges to the blue body and head feathers , which overlap to make the bird appear mostly brown . The adult female is brown on the upperparts and lighter brown on the underparts . It has indistinct wing bars and is faintly streaked with darker markings underneath . The immature bird resembles the female in coloring , although a male may have hints of blue on the tail and shoulders and have darker streaks on the underside . The beak is short and conical . In the adult female , the beak is light brown tinged with blue , and in the adult male the upper half is brownish @-@ black while the lower is light blue . The feet and legs are black or gray . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The habitat of the indigo bunting is brushy forest edges , open deciduous woods , second growth woodland , and farmland . The breeding range stretches from southern Canada to Maine , south to northern Florida and eastern Texas , and westward to southern Nevada . The winter range begins in southern Florida and central Mexico and stretches south through the West Indies and Central America to northern South America . It has occurred as a vagrant in Antigua and Barbuda , Barbados , Denmark , Ecuador , Germany , Iceland , Ireland , Netherlands , the Netherlands Antilles , Saint Pierre and Miquelon , Serbia and the United Kingdom . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 The indigo bunting communicates through vocalizations and visual cues . A sharp chip ! call is used by both sexes , and is used as an alarm call if a nest or chick is threatened . A high @-@ pitched , buzzed <unk> is used as a contact call when the indigo bunting is in flight . The song of the male bird is a high @-@ pitched buzzed sweet @-@ sweet chew @-@ chew sweet @-@ sweet , lasting two to four seconds , sung to mark his territory to other males and to attract females . Each male has a single complex song , which he sings while perched on elevated objects , such as posts , wires , and bush @-@ tops . In areas where the ranges of the lazuli bunting and the indigo bunting overlap , the males defend territories from each another . Migration takes place in April and May and then again in September and October . The indigo bunting often migrates during the night , using the stars to navigate . In captivity , since it cannot migrate , it experiences disorientation in April and May and in September and October if it cannot see the stars from its enclosure . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 These birds are generally monogamous but not always faithful to their partner . In the western part of their range , they often hybridize with the lazuli bunting . Nesting sites are located in dense shrub or a low tree , generally 0 @.@ 3 – 1 m ( 0 @.@ 98 – 3 @.@ 28 ft ) above the ground , but rarely up to 9 m ( 30 ft ) . The nest itself is constructed of leaves , coarse grasses , stems , and strips of bark , lined with soft grass or deer hair and is bound with spider web . It is constructed by the female , who cares for the eggs alone . The clutch consists of one to four eggs , but usually contains three to four . The eggs are white and usually unmarked , though some may be marked with brownish spots , averaging 18 @.@ 7 mm × 13 @.@ 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 74 in × 0 @.@ 54 in ) in size . The eggs are incubated for 12 to 13 days and the chicks are altricial at hatching . Chicks fledge 10 to 12 days after hatching . Most pairs raise two broods per year , and the male may feed newly fledged young while the females incubate the next clutch of eggs . 
 The brown @-@ headed cowbird may parasitize this species . Indigo buntings abandon their nest if a cowbird egg appears before they lay any of their own eggs , but accept the egg after that point . Pairs with parasitized nests have less reproductive success . The bunting chicks hatch , but have lower survival rates as they must compete with the cowbird chick for food . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The indigo bunting forages for food on the ground or in trees or shrubs . In winter , it often feeds in flocks with other indigo buntings , but is a solitary feeder during the breeding season . During the breeding season , the species eats insects , seeds and berries , including caterpillars , grasshoppers , spiders , beetles , and grass seeds . The seeds of grasses are the mainstay of its diet during the winter , although buds , and insects are eaten when available . The young are fed mainly insects at first , to provide them with protein . The indigo bunting does not drink frequently , generally obtaining sufficient water from its diet . 
 = = Status = = 
 The species is classified as being of least concern according to the IUCN , with an estimated range of 5 @,@ 900 @,@ 000 km2 ( 2 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 sq mi ) and a population of 28 million individuals . Global population trends have not been quantified , but the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for a population decline warranting an upgrade in conservation status . The criteria for a change in conservation status are a decline of more than 30 % in ten years or over three generations . 
 = Lagaan = 
 Lagaan ( English : Taxation ) is a 2001 Indian epic sports @-@ drama film written and directed by Ashutosh Gowariker . Aamir Khan , who was also the producer , stars with Gracy Singh in the lead roles ; British actors Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne play the supporting roles . Made on a then @-@ unprecedented budget of ₹ 250 million ( equivalent to ₹ 700 million or US $ 10 million in 2016 ) , the film was shot in an ancient village near Bhuj , India . 
 The film is set in the Victorian period of India 's colonial British Raj . The story revolves around a small village whose inhabitants , burdened by high taxes , find themselves in an extraordinary situation as an arrogant officer challenges them to a game of cricket as a wager to avoid the taxes . The narrative spins around this situation as the villagers face the arduous task of learning the alien game and playing for a result that will change their village 's destiny . 
 Lagaan received critical acclaim and awards at international film festivals , as well as many Indian film awards . It became the third Indian film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film after Mother India ( 1957 ) and Salaam Bombay ! ( 1988 ) . It was one of the biggest box office hits of 2001 . In 2010 , the film was ranked No. 55 in Empire magazines " The 100 Best Films of World Cinema " . In 2011 , it was listed in Time magazine 's special " The All @-@ TIME 25 Best Sports Movies " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The story is set in the small village of Champaner ( in the state of Gujarat , western India ) during the height of the British Empire in India in 1893 . Captain Andrew Russell ( Paul Blackthorne ) , the commanding officer of the Champaner cantonment , has imposed high taxes ( " <unk> " ) on people from the local villages that they are unable to pay due to a prolonged drought . Led by Bhuvan ( Aamir Khan ) , the villagers beg Raja Puran Singh ( Kulbhushan Kharbanda ) to help them . He tells them that , much to his regret , he is bound by British law . 
 After their visit to the Raja , the villagers first witness a cricket match . Bhuvan mocks the game and gets into a fight with one of the British officers . Taking an instant dislike to Bhuvan , Russell offers to cancel the taxes of the whole province " for three years " if the villagers can beat his men in a game of cricket . If the villagers lose , however , they will have to pay three times their normal taxes . Bhuvan accepts this wager on behalf of the villages in the province , without their consent . When the other villagers learn about the bet , they are furious with Bhuvan . He argues that it is important for everyone to fight against British rule . 
 Bhuvan begins to prepare the villagers for the match . He initially finds only five people willing to join the team . He is aided in his efforts by Russell 's sister Elizabeth ( Rachel Shelley ) who feels that her brother has mistreated the villagers . As she teaches them the rules of the game , she falls in love with Bhuvan , much to the anguish of Gauri ( Gracy Singh ) who is also in love with him . After Bhuvan reassures Gauri of his feelings for her , the woodcutter Lakha ( <unk> Sharma ) becomes enraged as he is in love with Gauri . 
 In an attempt to discredit Bhuvan , Lakha offers himself as a spy for Russell and joins the villagers ' team to destroy it . Eventually , as the villagers realise that winning equals freedom . As a few of them are insulted by the British , they join the team . Short one player , Bhuvan invites an untouchable , Kachra ( Aditya Lakhia ) , who can bowl spinners . The villagers , conditioned by long @-@ term prejudice against Dalits , refuse to play if Kachra joins the team . Bhuvan chastises the villagers , shaming them into accepting Kachra . 
 The second half of the film focuses on the match . On the first day , Russell wins the toss and elects to bat , giving the British officers a strong start . Bhuvan brings Kachra into the match only to find that Kachra has somehow lost his ability to spin the ball — new cricket balls do not spin as well as worn @-@ down ones ( which the team have been practising with ) . In addition , as part of his agreement with Russell , Lakha deliberately drops many catches . Later that evening , Elizabeth sees Lakha meeting with her brother . She races to the village and informs Bhuvan of Lakha 's deception . Rather than allow the villagers to kill him , Bhuvan offers Lakha the chance to redeem himself . 
 The next day as part of his promise to Bhuvan , Lakha takes a diving one @-@ handed catch . However , the British score almost 300 runs , losing only three wickets by the lunch break . Kachra is brought back to bowl and , bowling with a now @-@ worn ball , takes a hat @-@ trick , which sparks the collapse of the British batting side . The villagers soon start their innings . Bhuvan and Deva ( a Sikh , who has played cricket earlier when he was a British sepoy ) give their team a solid start . Deva misses out on his half @-@ century when a straight @-@ drive from Bhuvan ricochets off the bowler 's hand onto the stumps at the non @-@ striker 's end , where Deva is backing up too far . When Lakha comes on to bat , he is hit on the head by a bouncer and falls onto his stumps . Other batsmen get out trying to score a boundary off each delivery . Ismail ( Raj Zutshi ) , a good batsman , retires hurt as he is hit on the leg . The villagers ' team ends the day with four batsmen out of action with barely a third of the required runs on board . 
 On the third and final day , Bhuvan passes his century , while most of the later wickets fall . Ismail returns to bat with the help of a runner and passes his half @-@ century , reducing the required runs to an attainable total . The game comes down to the last over with Kachra on strike . With one ball remaining and the team down five runs , Kachra knocks the ball a short distance , managing a single . However , the umpire signals no ball . Bhuvan returns to bat and swings extremely hard at the next ball . Russell <unk> and catches it , gleefully believing that the British team has won — until he realises that he has caught gone beyond the boundary which gives six runs , and the win , to Bhuvan 's team . Even as they celebrate the victory , the drought ends as a rainstorm erupts . 
 Bhuvan 's defeat of the British team leads to the disbanding of the humiliated cantonment . In addition , Russell is forced to pay the taxes for the whole province and is transferred to Central Africa . After realising that Bhuvan loves Gauri , Elizabeth returns to London . Heartbroken , she remains unmarried for the rest of her life . The narrator ( Amitabh Bachchan ) says that Bhuvan went on to marry Gauri with great pomp and show . He concludes by saying that , despite the historic triumph , Bhuvan 's name was lost in the pages of history . 
 = = Cast = = 
 Aamir Khan as Bhuvan . Ashutosh first thought of having Shahrukh Khan and Abhishek Bachchan for the role of Bhuvan . After Bachchan chose to enter cinema with J. P. Dutta 's Refugee ( 2000 ) , Aamir was approached with the idea . 
 Gracy Singh as Gauri . Several actresses had offered to act in the film , but Aamir needed someone who matched the description of the character given in the script . After considering Sonali Bendre , Nandita Das , Rani Mukerji and Ameesha Patel for the role , Ashutosh selected Gracy Singh for the female lead because he was convinced that she was a good actress and dancer and resembled actress Vyjayanthimala . Singh , a newcomer , devoted all her time to the film . 
 Rachel Shelley as Elizabeth Russell 
 Paul Blackthorne as Captain Andrew Russell . Since the script also demanded a British cast , Ashutosh and Aamir hired Danielle Roffe as one of the casting directors . After Danielle and Ashutosh screen @-@ tested many , Shelley and Blackthorne were chosen for the prime roles . Overall , the film cast 15 foreign actors . 
 Suhasini <unk> as <unk> , Bhuvan 's mother 
 Kulbhushan Kharbanda as Raja Puran Singh 
 Rajendra Gupta as <unk> Ji 
 Raghubir Yadav as <unk> ( seamer ) , the poultry farmer . Yadav played the role of the legendary Haji Nasruddin in the teleplay Mullah Nasiruddin and has given many memorable performances such as <unk> Ke <unk> <unk> . Yadav was selected based on his performance in Earth ( 1998 ) . He had undergone an appendectomy operation in @-@ between the filming schedule and returned to complete some of his scenes .

 Director Ashutosh Gowariker has stated that it was almost impossible to make Lagaan . Gowariker went to Aamir , who agreed to participate after hearing the detailed script . Even after securing Khan , Ashutosh had trouble finding a producer . Producers who showed interest in the script wanted budget cuts as well as script modifications . Eventually , Aamir agreed to Ashutosh 's suggestion that he 'd produce the film . Aamir corroborated this by saying that the faith he had in Ashutosh , the story and script of the film , and the opportunity of starting his own production company inspired him to produce Lagaan . He also said that by being a producer himself , he was able to give greater creative freedom to Ashutosh . He cited an example : 
 " If the director tells the producer that he wants 50 camels , the latter will probably say , ' Why not 25 ? Can 't you manage with 25 camels ? ' Whereas , if he is telling me the same thing ... I will not waste time asking him questions because I am also creatively aware why he needs them . " 
 <unk> <unk> co @-@ produced the film because he liked the emotional and patriotic story .

 One of the first members to join the production team was Nitin Chandrakant Desai , the art director , with whom Ashutosh set out for extensive location hunt throughout India , to find the setting for the fictional town of Champaner , in late 1998 . After searching through Rajasthan , Nasik , UP , they zeroed in on an ancient village near Bhuj , located in Gujarat 's Kutch district , by May 1999 , where the film was primarily shot . 
 The script demanded a dry location : an agricultural village where it had not rained in several years . To depict the 1890s era , the crew also required a village which lacked electricity , communication and automobiles . Kutch faced the same problems at that time and hence the village of <unk> , located a few miles away from Bhuj , was chosen . During the filming of Lagaan , it did not rain at all in the region . However , a week after the shoot finished , it rained heavily bringing relief to Bhuj , which had a lean monsoon the previous year . The typical old Kutch hamlet was built by the local people four months before the arrival of the crew . The 2001 Gujarat earthquake devastated this region and displaced many locals . The crew , including the English , contributed to their cause by donating ₹ 250 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to ₹ 700 @,@ 000 or US $ 10 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) , with further contributions during the year . 
 Avadhi , which is a dialect of Hindi , is primarily from a region in Uttar Pradesh . It was chosen to give the feel of the language spoken during that era . However , the language was diluted , and modern viewers can understand it . The dialogues , which were a combination of three dialects ( Avadhi , Bhojpuri and Braj Bhasha ) were penned by Hindi writer K. P. Saxena . 
 Bhanu <unk> , an Oscar winner for Gandhi , was the costume designer for the film . With a large number of extras , it was difficult for her to make enough costumes . She spent a lot of time researching to lend authenticity to the characters .

 Pre @-@ planning for a year , including ten months for production issues and two months for his character , was tiring for Aamir . As a first @-@ time producer , he obtained a crew of about 300 people for six months . Due to the lack of comfortable hotels in Bhuj , he hired a newly constructed apartment and furnished it completely for the crew . Security was set up and a special housekeeping team was brought to take care of the crew 's needs . Most of the 19th century tools and equipment depicted in the film were lent to the crew by the local villagers . Initially , they did not want to part with their equipment , but after much coaxing , they gave in . They then travelled to different parts of the country to collect the musical instruments used in that day and era . 
 During the shooting , Ashutosh suffered from a slipped disc and had to rest for 30 days . During this period , he had his bed next to the monitor and continued with his work . 
 The filming schedule spanned the winter and summer , commencing in early January and finishing in mid @-@ June . This was physically challenging for many , with the temperatures ranging from 0 to 50 ° C ( 32 to 122 ° F ) . The actors had to drink frequently and sit in the shade . The schedule was strict . The day began at 6 am , changing into costumes and getting onto the actors ' bus , which took them to the sets in <unk> . The actors , including Aamir , all travelled on the same bus . If anyone missed it , it was up to them to reach the sets . One day , Aamir was late and missed the actors ' bus . That day , his wife Reena , the executive producer , reprimanded him for being late . She told him he had to set an example for the rest of the crew . " If he started coming late , how could she tell the others to come on time ? " While on the sets , the actors were given call sheets with the day 's timetable such as breakfast , hair styling , make @-@ up , costumes , etc .

At the same time , it 's a memory of the films we all grew up on , with clearly defined villains and heroes , a romantic triangle , and even a comic character who saves the day . Lagaan is a well @-@ crafted , hugely entertaining epic that has the spice of a foreign culture . " Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described the film as " a lavish epic , a gorgeous love story , and a rollicking adventure yarn . Larger than life and outrageously enjoyable , it 's got a dash of spaghetti western , a hint of Kurosawa , with a bracing shot of Kipling . " <unk> Singh of the BBC stated that " Lagaan is anything but standard Bollywood fodder , and is the first must @-@ see of the Indian summer . A movie that will have you laughing and crying , but leaving with a smile . " Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times argued that the film is " an affectionate homage to a popular genre that raises it to the level of an art film with fully drawn characters , a serious underlying theme , and a sophisticated style and point of view . " Sudish Kamath of The Hindu suggested that " the movie is not just a story . It is an experience . An experience of watching something that puts life into you , that puts a cheer on your face , however depressed you might be . " The Times of India wrote , " Lagaan has all the attractions of big @-@ sounding A. R. Rahman songs , excellent performances by Aamir Khan ... and a successful debut for pretty Gracy Singh . In addition , there is the celebrated David vs Goliath cricket match , which has audiences screaming and clapping . " Perhaps one of the most emphatic recommendations for the movie , coming 10 years later , is by John Nugent of the Trenton Independent , who wrote " a masterpiece ... and what better way to learn a bit about India 's colonial experience ! History and great entertainment , all rolled in to one ( albeit long ) classic film . "
