 Certain problems can be solved using this result . For example , consider two measuring cups of volume a and b . By adding / subtracting u multiples of the first cup and v multiples of the second cup , any volume ua + vb can be measured out . These volumes are all multiples of g = 
 gcd ( a , b ) . 
 = = = Extended Euclidean algorithm = = = 
 The integers s and t of Bézout 's identity can be computed efficiently using the extended Euclidean algorithm . This extension adds two recursive equations to Euclid 's algorithm 
 sk 
 = sk − 2 − <unk> − 1 
 tk = 
 tk − 2 − <unk> − 1 
 with the starting values 
 s − 2 
 = 1 , t − 2 = 
 0 
 s − 1 
 = 0 , t − 1 = 
 1 . 
 Using this recursion , Bézout 's integers s and t are given by s 
 = <unk> and t = 
 <unk> , where N + 1 is the step on which the algorithm terminates with rN + 1 
 = 0 . 
 The validity of this approach can be shown by induction . Assume that the recursion formula is correct up to step k − 1 of the algorithm ; in other words , assume that 
 <unk> = 
 sj a + <unk> b 
 for all j less than k . The kth step of the algorithm gives the equation 
 rk 
 = rk − 2 − <unk> − 1 . 
 Since the recursion formula has been assumed to be correct for rk − 2 and rk − 1 , they may be expressed in terms of the corresponding s and t variables 
 rk = 
 ( sk − 2 a + tk − 2 b ) − qk ( sk − 1 a + tk − 1 b ) . 
 Rearranging this equation yields the recursion formula for step k , as required 
 rk 
 = sk a + tk b = 
 ( sk − 2 − <unk> − 1 ) a + ( tk − 2 − <unk> − 1 ) b . 
 = = = Matrix method = = = 
 The integers s and t can also be found using an equivalent matrix method . The sequence of equations of Euclid 's algorithm 
 a 
 = q0 b + r0 
 b = 
 q1 r0 + r1 
 … 
 rN − 2 
 = qN rN − 1 + 0 
 can be written as a product of 2 @-@ by @-@ 2 quotient matrices multiplying a two @-@ dimensional remainder vector 
 <formula> 
 Let M represent the product of all the quotient matrices 
 <formula> 
 This simplifies the Euclidean algorithm to the form 
 <formula> 
 To express g as a linear sum of a and b , both sides of this equation can be multiplied by the inverse of the matrix M. The determinant of M equals ( − 1 ) N + 1 , since it equals the product of the determinants of the quotient matrices , each of which is negative one . Since the determinant of M is never zero , the vector of the final remainders can be solved using the inverse of M 
 <formula> 
 Since the top equation gives 
 g = 
 ( − 1 ) N + 1 ( <unk> a − <unk> b ) , 
 the two integers of Bézout 's identity are s 
 = ( − 1 ) N + <unk> and t = 
 ( − 1 ) <unk> . The matrix method is as efficient as the equivalent recursion , with two multiplications and two additions per step of the Euclidean algorithm . 
 = = = Euclid 's lemma and unique factorization = = = 
 Bézout 's identity is essential to many applications of Euclid 's algorithm , such as demonstrating the unique factorization of numbers into prime factors . To illustrate this , suppose that a number L can be written as a product of two factors u and v , that is , L 
 = <unk> . If another number w also divides L but is coprime with u , then w must divide v , by the following argument : If the greatest common divisor of u and w is 1 , then integers s and t can be found such that 
 1 = 
 su + tw . 
 by Bézout 's identity . <unk> both sides by v gives the relation 
 v 
 = <unk> + <unk> = 
 <unk> + <unk> . 
 Since w divides both terms on the right @-@ hand side , it must also divide the left @-@ hand side , v. This result is known as Euclid 's lemma . Specifically , if a prime number divides L , then it must divide at least one factor of L. Conversely , if a number w is coprime to each of a series of numbers a1 , a2 , … , an , then w is also coprime to their product , a1 × a2 × … × an . 
 Euclid 's lemma suffices to prove that every number has a unique factorization into prime numbers . To see this , assume the contrary , that there are two independent factorizations of L into m and n prime factors , respectively 
 L 
 = <unk> … pm = 
 <unk> … qn . 
 Since each prime p divides L by assumption , it must also divide one of the q factors ; since each q is prime as well , it must be that p = q . <unk> dividing by the p factors shows that each p has an equal counterpart q ; the two prime factorizations are identical except for their order . The unique factorization of numbers into primes has many applications in mathematical proofs , as shown below . 
 = = = Linear Diophantine equations = = = 
 Diophantine equations are equations in which the solutions are restricted to integers ; they are named after the 3rd @-@ century Alexandrian mathematician Diophantus . A typical linear Diophantine equation seeks integers x and y such that 
 ax + by 
 = c 
 where a , b and c are given integers . This can be written as an equation for x in modular arithmetic : 
 ax ≡ c mod b . 
 Let g be the greatest common divisor of a and b . Both terms in ax + by are divisible by g ; therefore , c must also be divisible by g , or the equation has no solutions . By dividing both sides by c / g , the equation can be reduced to <unk> 's identity 
 sa + tb = 
 g 
 where s and t can be found by the extended Euclidean algorithm . This provides one solution to the Diophantine equation , x1 
 = s ( c / g ) and y1 = 
 t ( c / g ) . 
 In general , a linear Diophantine equation has no solutions , or an infinite number of solutions . To find the latter , consider two solutions , ( x1 , y1 ) and ( x2 , y2 ) , where 
 ax1 + <unk> 
 = c = 
 ax2 + <unk> 
 or equivalently 
 a ( x1 − x2 ) 
 = b ( y2 − y1 ) . 
 Therefore , the smallest difference between two x solutions is b / g , whereas the smallest difference between two y solutions is a / g . Thus , the solutions may be expressed as 
 x = 
 x1 − bu / g 
 y = y1 + au / g . 
 By allowing u to vary over all possible integers , an infinite family of solutions can be generated from a single solution ( x1 , y1 ) . If the solutions are required to be positive integers ( x > 0 , y > 0 ) , only a finite number of solutions may be possible . This restriction on the acceptable solutions allows some systems of Diophantine equations with more unknowns than equations to have a finite number of solutions ; this is impossible for a system of linear equations when the solutions can be any real number ( see <unk> system ) . 
 = = = <unk> inverses and the RSA algorithm = = = 
 A finite field is a set of numbers with four generalized operations . The operations are called addition , subtraction , multiplication and division and have their usual properties , such as commutativity , associativity and distributivity . An example of a finite field is the set of 13 numbers { 0 , 1 , 2 , … , 12 } using modular arithmetic . In this field , the results of any mathematical operation ( addition , subtraction , multiplication , or division ) is reduced modulo 13 ; that is , multiples of 13 are added or subtracted until the result is brought within the range 0 – 12 . For example , the result of 5 × 7 
 = 35 mod 13 = 
 9 . Such finite fields can be defined for any prime p ; using more sophisticated definitions , they can also be defined for any power m of a prime p m . Finite fields are often called Galois fields , and are abbreviated as GF ( p ) or GF ( p m ) . 
 In such a field with m numbers , every nonzero element a has a unique modular multiplicative inverse , a − 1 such that aa − 1 
 = a − 1a ≡ 1 mod m . This inverse can be found by solving the congruence equation ax ≡ 1 mod m , or the equivalent linear Diophantine equation 
 ax + my = 
 1 . 
 This equation can be solved by the Euclidean algorithm , as described above . Finding multiplicative inverses is an essential step in the RSA algorithm , which is widely used in electronic commerce ; specifically , the equation determines the integer used to decrypt the message . Note that although the RSA algorithm uses rings rather than fields , the Euclidean algorithm can still be used to find a multiplicative inverse where one exists . The Euclidean algorithm also has other applications in error @-@ correcting codes ; for example , it can be used as an alternative to the Berlekamp – Massey algorithm for decoding BCH and Reed – Solomon codes , which are based on Galois fields . 
 = = = Chinese remainder theorem = = = 
 Euclid 's algorithm can also be used to solve multiple linear Diophantine equations . Such equations arise in the Chinese remainder theorem , which describes a novel method to represent an integer x . Instead of representing an integer by its digits , it may be represented by its remainders xi modulo a set of N coprime numbers mi : 
 <formula> 
 The goal is to determine x from its N remainders xi . The solution is to combine the multiple equations into a single linear Diophantine equation with a much larger modulus M that is the product of all the individual moduli mi , and define Mi as 
 <formula> 
 Thus , each Mi is the product of all the moduli except mi . The solution depends on finding N new numbers hi such that 
 <formula> 
 With these numbers hi , any integer x can be reconstructed from its remainders xi by the equation 
 <formula> 
 Since these numbers hi are the multiplicative inverses of the Mi , they may be found using Euclid 's algorithm as described in the previous subsection . 
 = = = Stern – <unk> tree = = = 
 The Euclidean algorithm can be used to arrange the set of all positive rational numbers into an infinite binary search tree , called the Stern – <unk> tree . The number 1 ( expressed as a fraction 1 / 1 ) is placed at the root of the tree , and the location of any other number a / b can be found by computing gcd ( a , b ) using the original form of the Euclidean algorithm , in which each step replaces the larger of the two given numbers by its difference with the smaller number ( not its remainder ) , stopping when two equal numbers are reached . A step of the Euclidean algorithm that replaces the first of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from a node to its right child , and a step that replaces the second of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from a node to its left child . The sequence of steps constructed in this way does not depend on whether a / b is given in lowest terms , and forms a path from the root to a node containing the number a / b . This fact can be used to prove that each positive rational number appears exactly once in this tree . 
 For example , 3 / 4 can be found by starting at the root , going to the left once , then to the right twice : 
 <formula> 
 The Euclidean algorithm has almost the same relationship to another binary tree on the rational numbers called the Calkin – Wilf tree . The difference is that the path is reversed : instead of producing a path from the root of the tree to a target , it produces a path from the target to the root . 
 = = = Continued fractions = = = 
 The Euclidean algorithm has a close relationship with continued fractions . The sequence of equations can be written in the form 
 <formula> 
 The last term on the right @-@ hand side always equals the inverse of the left @-@ hand side of the next equation . Thus , the first two equations may be combined to form 
 <formula> 
 The third equation may be used to substitute the denominator term r1 / r0 , yielding 
 <formula> 
 The final ratio of remainders rk / rk − 1 can always be replaced using the next equation in the series , up to the final equation . The result is a continued fraction 
 <formula> 
 In the worked example above , the gcd ( 1071 , 462 ) was calculated , and the quotients qk were 2 , 3 and 7 , respectively . Therefore , the fraction 1071 / 462 may be written 
 <formula> 
 as can be confirmed by calculation . 
 = = = Factorization algorithms = = = 
 Calculating a greatest common divisor is an essential step in several integer factorization algorithms , such as Pollard 's rho algorithm , Shor 's algorithm , Dixon 's factorization method and the Lenstra elliptic curve factorization . The Euclidean algorithm may be used to find this GCD efficiently . Continued fraction factorization uses continued fractions , which are determined using Euclid 's algorithm . 
 = = Algorithmic efficiency = = 
 The computational efficiency of Euclid 's algorithm has been studied thoroughly . This efficiency can be described by the number of division steps the algorithm requires , multiplied by the computational expense of each step . The first known analysis of Euclid 's algorithm is due to <unk> Reynaud in 1811 , who showed that the number of division steps on input ( u , v ) is bounded by v ; later he improved this to v / 2 + 2 . Later , in 1841 , <unk> Finck showed that the number of division steps is at most 2 log2 v + 1 , and hence Euclid 's algorithm runs in time polynomial in the size of the input . Émile Léger , in 1837 , studied the worst case , which is when the inputs are consecutive Fibonacci numbers . Finck 's analysis was refined by Gabriel Lamé in 1844 , who showed that the number of steps required for completion is never more than five times the number h of base @-@ 10 digits of the smaller number b . 
 In the uniform cost model ( suitable for analyzing the complexity of gcd calculation on numbers that fit into a single machine word ) , each step of the algorithm takes constant time , and Lamé 's analysis implies that the total running time is also O ( h ) . However , in a model of computation suitable for computation with larger numbers , the computational expense of a single remainder computation in the algorithm can be as large as O ( h2 ) . In this case the total time for all of the steps of the algorithm can be analyzed using a telescoping series , showing that it is also O ( h2 ) . Modern algorithmic techniques based on the Schönhage – Strassen algorithm for fast integer multiplication can be used to speed this up , leading to quasilinear algorithms for the GCD . 
 = = = Number of steps = = = 
 The number of steps to calculate the GCD of two natural numbers , a and b , may be denoted by T ( a , b ) . If g is the GCD of a and b , then a 
 = mg and b = 
 ng for two coprime numbers m and n . Then 
 T ( a , b ) 
 = T ( m , n ) 
 as may be seen by dividing all the steps in the Euclidean algorithm by g . By the same argument , the number of steps remains the same if a and b are multiplied by a common factor w : T ( a , b ) = 
 T ( wa , <unk> ) . Therefore , the number of steps T may vary dramatically between neighboring pairs of numbers , such as T ( a , b ) and T ( a , b + 1 ) , depending on the size of the two GCDs . 
 The recursive nature of the Euclidean algorithm gives another equation 
 T ( a , b ) 
 = 1 + T ( b , r0 ) = 
 2 + T ( r0 , r1 ) 
 = … = 
 N + T ( rN − 2 , rN − 1 ) 
 = N + 1 
 where T ( x , 0 ) = 
 0 by assumption . 
 = = = = Worst @-@ case = = = = 
 If the Euclidean algorithm requires N steps for a pair of natural numbers a > b > 0 , the smallest values of a and b for which this is true are the Fibonacci numbers FN + 2 and FN + 1 , respectively . This can be shown by induction . If N 
 = 1 , b divides a with no remainder ; the smallest natural numbers for which this is true is b = 
 1 and a 
 = 2 , which are F2 and F3 , respectively . Now assume that the result holds for all values of N up to M − 1 . The first step of the M @-@ step algorithm is a = 
 <unk> + r0 , and the second step is b 
 = <unk> + r1 . Since the algorithm is recursive , it required M − 1 steps to find gcd ( b , r0 ) and their smallest values are FM + 1 and FM . The smallest value of a is therefore when q0 = 
 1 , which gives a 
 = b + r0 = 
 FM + 1 + FM 
 = FM + 2 . This proof , published by Gabriel Lamé in 1844 , represents the beginning of computational complexity theory , and also the first practical application of the Fibonacci numbers . 
 This result suffices to show that the number of steps in Euclid 's algorithm can never be more than five times the number of its digits ( base 10 ) . For if the algorithm requires N steps , then b is greater than or equal to FN + 1 which in turn is greater than or equal to <unk> − 1 , where φ is the golden ratio . Since b ≥ <unk> − 1 , then N − 1 ≤ <unk> . Since <unk> > 1 / 5 , ( N − 1 ) / 5 < <unk> <unk> = 
 <unk> . Thus , N ≤ 5 <unk> . Thus , the Euclidean algorithm always needs less than O ( h ) divisions , where h is the number of digits in the smaller number b . 
 = = = = Average = = = = 
 The average number of steps taken by the Euclidean algorithm has been defined in three different ways . The first definition is the average time T ( a ) required to calculate the GCD of a given number a and a smaller natural number b chosen with equal probability from the integers 0 to a − 1 
 <formula> 
 However , since T ( a , b ) fluctuates dramatically with the GCD of the two numbers , the averaged function T ( a ) is likewise " noisy " . 
 To reduce this noise , a second average τ ( a ) is taken over all numbers coprime with a 
 <formula> 
 There are φ ( a ) coprime integers less than a , where φ is Euler 's totient function . This tau average grows smoothly with a 
 <formula> 
 with the residual error being of order a − ( 1 / 6 ) + ε , where ε is infinitesimal . The constant C ( Porter 's Constant ) in this formula equals 
 <formula> 
 where γ is the Euler – Mascheroni constant and ζ ' is the derivative of the Riemann zeta function . The leading coefficient ( 12 / π2 ) ln 2 was determined by two independent methods . 
 Since the first average can be calculated from the tau average by summing over the divisors d of a 
 <formula> 
 it can be approximated by the formula 
 <formula> 
 where Λ ( d ) is the <unk> function . 
 A third average Y ( n ) is defined as the mean number of steps required when both a and b are chosen randomly ( with uniform distribution ) from 1 to n 
 <formula> 
 Substituting the approximate formula for T ( a ) into this equation yields an estimate for Y ( n ) 
 <formula> 
 = = = Computational expense per step = = = 
 In each step k of the Euclidean algorithm , the quotient qk and remainder rk are computed for a given pair of integers rk − 2 and rk − 1 
 rk − 2 
 = qk rk − 1 + rk . 
 The computational expense per step is associated chiefly with finding qk , since the remainder rk can be calculated quickly from rk − 2 , rk − 1 , and qk 
 rk = 
 rk − 2 − qk rk − 1 . 
 The computational expense of dividing h @-@ bit numbers scales as O ( h ( ℓ + 1 ) ) , where ℓ is the length of the quotient . 
 For comparison , Euclid 's original subtraction @-@ based algorithm can be much slower . A single integer division is equivalent to the quotient q number of subtractions . If the ratio of a and b is very large , the quotient is large and many subtractions will be required . On the other hand , it has been shown that the quotients are very likely to be small integers . The probability of a given quotient q is approximately ln | u / ( u − 1 ) | where u = ( q + 1 ) 2 . For illustration , the probability of a quotient of 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 is roughly 41 @.@ 5 % , 17 @.@ 0 % , 9 @.@ 3 % , and 5 @.@ 9 % , respectively . Since the operation of subtraction is faster than division , particularly for large numbers , the subtraction @-@ based Euclid 's algorithm is competitive with the division @-@ based version . This is exploited in the binary version of Euclid 's algorithm . 
 Combining the estimated number of steps with the estimated computational expense per step shows that the Euclid 's algorithm grows quadratically ( h2 ) with the average number of digits h in the initial two numbers a and b . Let <unk> , h1 , … , <unk> − 1 represent the number of digits in the successive remainders r0 , r1 , … , rN − 1 . Since the number of steps N grows linearly with h , the running time is bounded by 
 <formula> 
 = = = Alternative methods = = = 
 Euclid 's algorithm is widely used in practice , especially for small numbers , due to its simplicity . For comparison , the efficiency of alternatives to Euclid 's algorithm may be determined . 
 One inefficient approach to finding the GCD of two natural numbers a and b is to calculate all their common divisors ; the GCD is then the largest common divisor . The common divisors can be found by dividing both numbers by successive integers from 2 to the smaller number b . The number of steps of this approach grows linearly with b , or exponentially in the number of digits . Another inefficient approach is to find the prime factors of one or both numbers . As noted above , the GCD equals the product of the prime factors shared by the two numbers a and b . Present methods for prime factorization are also inefficient ; many modern cryptography systems even rely on that inefficiency . 
 The binary GCD algorithm is an efficient alternative that substitutes division with faster operations by exploiting the binary representation used by computers . However , this alternative also scales like O ( h ² ) . It is generally faster than the Euclidean algorithm on real computers , even though it scales in the same way . Additional efficiency can be gleaned by examining only the leading digits of the two numbers a and b . The binary algorithm can be extended to other bases ( k @-@ ary algorithms ) , with up to fivefold increases in speed . Lehmer 's GCD algorithm uses the same general principle as the binary algorithm to speed up GCD computations in arbitrary bases . 
 A recursive approach for very large integers ( with more than 25 @,@ 000 digits ) leads to quasilinear integer GCD algorithms , such as those of Schönhage , and <unk> and Zimmermann . These algorithms exploit the 2 × 2 matrix form of the Euclidean algorithm given above . These quasilinear methods generally scale as O ( h ( log h ) 2 ( log log h ) ) . 
 = = Generalizations = = 
 Although the Euclidean algorithm is used to find the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers ( positive integers ) , it may be generalized to the real numbers , and to other mathematical objects , such as polynomials , quadratic integers and Hurwitz quaternions . In the latter cases , the Euclidean algorithm is used to demonstrate the crucial property of unique factorization , i.e. , that such numbers can be factored uniquely into irreducible elements , the counterparts of prime numbers . Unique factorization is essential to many proofs of number theory . 
 = = = Rational and real numbers = = = 
 Euclid 's algorithm can be applied to real numbers , as described by Euclid in Book 10 of his Elements . The goal of the algorithm is to identify a real number g such that two given real numbers , a and b , are integer multiples of it : a 
 = mg and b = 
 ng , where m and n are integers . This identification is equivalent to finding an integer relation among the real numbers a and b ; that is , it determines integers s and t such that sa + tb 
 = 0 . Euclid uses this algorithm to treat the question of incommensurable lengths . 
 The real @-@ number Euclidean algorithm differs from its integer counterpart in two respects . First , the remainders rk are real numbers , although the quotients qk are integers as before . Second , the algorithm is not guaranteed to end in a finite number N of steps . If it does , the fraction a / b is a rational number , i.e. , the ratio of two integers 
 a / b = 
 mg / ng 
 = m / n 
 and can be written as a finite continued fraction [ q0 ; q1 , q2 , … , qN ] . If the algorithm does not stop , the fraction a / b is an irrational number and can be described by an infinite continued fraction [ q0 ; q1 , q2 , … ] . Examples of infinite continued fractions are the golden ratio φ = 
 [ 1 ; 1 , 1 , … ] and the square root of two , √ 2 
 = [ 1 ; 2 , 2 , … ] . The algorithm is unlikely to stop , since almost all ratios a / b of two real numbers are irrational . 
 An infinite continued fraction may be truncated at a step k [ q0 ; q1 , q2 , … , qk ] to yield an approximation to a / b that improves as k is increased . The approximation is described by <unk> mk / nk ; the numerator and denominators are coprime and obey the recurrence relation 
 mk = 
 qk mk − 1 + mk − 2 
 nk 
 = qk nk − 1 + nk − 2 
 where m − 1 = 
 n − 2 
 = 1 and m − 2 = 
 n − 1 = 0 are the initial values of the recursion . The convergent mk / nk is the best rational number approximation to a / b with denominator nk : 
 <formula> 
 = = = Polynomials = = = 
 Polynomials in a single variable x can be added , multiplied and factored into irreducible polynomials , which are the analogs of the prime numbers for integers . The greatest common divisor polynomial g ( x ) of two polynomials a ( x ) and b ( x ) is defined as the product of their shared irreducible polynomials , which can be identified using the Euclidean algorithm . The basic procedure is similar to integers . At each step k , a quotient polynomial qk ( x ) and a remainder polynomial rk ( x ) are identified to satisfy the recursive equation 
 rk − 2 ( x ) 
 = qk ( x ) rk − 1 ( x ) + rk ( x ) 
 where r − 2 ( x ) = 
 a ( x ) and r − 1 ( x ) 
 = b ( x ) . The quotient polynomial is chosen so that the leading term of qk ( x ) rk − 1 ( x ) equals the leading term of rk − 2 ( x ) ; this ensures that the degree of each remainder is smaller than the degree of its predecessor deg [ rk ( x ) ] < deg [ rk − 1 ( x ) ] . Since the degree is a nonnegative integer , and since it decreases with every step , the Euclidean algorithm concludes in a finite number of steps . The final nonzero remainder is the greatest common divisor of the original two polynomials , a ( x ) and b ( x ) . 
 For example , consider the following two quartic polynomials , which each factor into two quadratic polynomials 
 a ( x ) = 
 x4 − 4x3 + 4 x2 − 3x + 14 
 = ( x2 − 5x + 7 ) ( x2 + x + 2 ) 
 and 
 b ( x ) = 
 x4 + <unk> + <unk> + <unk> + 6 
 = ( x2 + 7x + 3 ) ( x2 + x + 2 ) . 
 Dividing a ( x ) by b ( x ) yields a remainder r0 ( x ) = 
 x3 + ( 2 / 3 ) x2 + ( 5 / 3 ) x − ( 2 / 3 ) . In the next step , b ( x ) is divided by r0 ( x ) yielding a remainder r1 ( x ) = x2 + x + 2 . Finally , dividing r0 ( x ) by r1 ( x ) yields a zero remainder , indicating that r1 ( x ) is the greatest common divisor polynomial of a ( x ) and b ( x ) , consistent with their factorization . 
 Many of the applications described above for integers carry over to polynomials . The Euclidean algorithm can be used to solve linear Diophantine equations and Chinese remainder problems for polynomials ; continued fractions of polynomials can also be defined . 
 The polynomial Euclidean algorithm has other applications , such as Sturm chains , a method for counting the zeros of a polynomial that lie inside a given real interval . This in turn has applications in several areas , such as the Routh – Hurwitz stability criterion in control theory . 
 Finally , the coefficients of the polynomials need not be drawn from integers , real numbers or even the complex numbers . For example , the coefficients may be drawn from a general field , such as the finite fields GF ( p ) described above . The corresponding conclusions about the Euclidean algorithm and its applications hold even for such polynomials . 
 = = = Gaussian integers = = = 
 The Gaussian integers are complex numbers of the form α 
 = u + vi , where u and v are ordinary integers and i is the square root of negative one . By defining an analog of the Euclidean algorithm , Gaussian integers can be shown to be uniquely <unk> , by the argument above . This unique factorization is helpful in many applications , such as deriving all Pythagorean triples or proving Fermat 's theorem on sums of two squares . In general , the Euclidean algorithm is convenient in such applications , but not essential ; for example , the theorems can often be proven by other arguments . 
 The Euclidean algorithm developed for two Gaussian integers α and β is nearly the same as that for normal integers , but differs in two respects . As before , the task at each step k is to identify a quotient qk and a remainder rk such that 
 rk = 
 rk − 2 − qk rk − 1 
 where rk − 2 
 = α , rk − 1 = 
 β , and every remainder is strictly smaller than its predecessor , | rk | < | rk − 1 | . The first difference is that the quotients and remainders are themselves Gaussian integers , and thus are complex numbers . The quotients qk are generally found by rounding the real and complex parts of the exact ratio ( such as the complex number α / β ) to the nearest integers . The second difference lies in the necessity of defining how one complex remainder can be " smaller " than another . To do this , a norm function f ( u + vi ) = u2 + v2 is defined , which converts every Gaussian integer u + vi into a normal integer . After each step k of the Euclidean algorithm , the norm of the remainder f ( rk ) is smaller than the norm of the preceding remainder , f ( rk − 1 ) . Since the norm is a nonnegative integer and decreases with every step , the Euclidean algorithm for Gaussian integers ends in a finite number of steps . The final nonzero remainder is the gcd ( α , β ) , the Gaussian integer of largest norm that divides both α and β ; it is unique up to multiplication by a unit , ± 1 or ± i . 
 Many of the other applications of the Euclidean algorithm carry over to Gaussian integers . For example , it can be used to solve linear Diophantine equations and Chinese remainder problems for Gaussian integers ; continued fractions of Gaussian integers can also be defined . 
 = = = Euclidean domains = = = 
 A set of elements under two binary operations , + and − , is called a Euclidean domain if it forms a commutative ring R and , roughly speaking , if a generalized Euclidean algorithm can be performed on them . The two operations of such a ring need not be the addition and multiplication of ordinary arithmetic ; rather , they can be more general , such as the operations of a mathematical group or monoid . Nevertheless , these general operations should respect many of the laws governing ordinary arithmetic , such as commutativity , associativity and distributivity . 
 The generalized Euclidean algorithm requires a Euclidean function , i.e. , a mapping f from R into the set of nonnegative integers such that , for any two nonzero elements a and b in R , there exist q and r in R such that a 
 = <unk> + r and f ( r ) < f ( b ) . An example of this mapping is the norm function used to order the Gaussian integers above . The function f can be the magnitude of the number , or the degree of a polynomial . The basic principle is that each step of the algorithm reduces f inexorably ; hence , if f can be reduced only a finite number of times , the algorithm must stop in a finite number of steps . This principle relies heavily on the natural well @-@ ordering of the non @-@ negative integers ; roughly speaking , this requires that every non @-@ empty set of non @-@ negative integers has a smallest member . 
 The fundamental theorem of arithmetic applies to any Euclidean domain : Any number from a Euclidean domain can be factored uniquely into irreducible elements . Any Euclidean domain is a unique factorization domain ( <unk> ) , although the converse is not true . The Euclidean domains and the <unk> 's are subclasses of the GCD domains , domains in which a greatest common divisor of two numbers always exists . In other words , a greatest common divisor may exist ( for all pairs of elements in a domain ) , although it may not be possible to find it using a Euclidean algorithm . A Euclidean domain is always a principal ideal domain ( PID ) , an integral domain in which every ideal is a principal ideal . Again , the converse is not true : not every PID is a Euclidean domain . 
 The unique factorization of Euclidean domains is useful in many applications . For example , the unique factorization of the Gaussian integers is convenient in deriving formulae for all Pythagorean triples and in proving Fermat 's theorem on sums of two squares . Unique factorization was also a key element in an attempted proof of Fermat 's Last Theorem published in 1847 by Gabriel Lamé , the same mathematician who analyzed the efficiency of Euclid 's algorithm , based on a suggestion of Joseph Liouville . Lamé 's approach required the unique factorization of numbers of the form x + <unk> , where x and y are integers , and ω = 
 <unk> / n is an nth root of 1 , that is , <unk> = 1 . Although this approach succeeds for some values of n ( such as n = 3 , the Eisenstein integers ) , in general such numbers do not factor uniquely . This failure of unique factorization in some cyclotomic fields led Ernst Kummer to the concept of ideal numbers and , later , Richard Dedekind to ideals . 
 = = = = Unique factorization of quadratic integers = = = = 
 The quadratic integer rings are helpful to illustrate Euclidean domains . Quadratic integers are generalizations of the Gaussian integers in which the imaginary unit i is replaced by a number ω . Thus , they have the form u + v ω , where u and v are integers and ω has one of two forms , depending on a parameter D. If D does not equal a multiple of four plus one , then 
 <formula> 
 If , however , D does equal a multiple of four plus one , then 
 <formula> 
 If the function f corresponds to a norm function , such as that used to order the Gaussian integers above , then the domain is known as norm @-@ Euclidean . The norm @-@ Euclidean rings of quadratic integers are exactly those where D 
 = − 11 , − 7 , − 3 , − 2 , − 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 11 , 13 , 17 , 19 , 21 , 29 , 33 , 37 , 41 , 57 or 73 . The quadratic integers with D = 
 − 1 and − 3 are known as the Gaussian integers and Eisenstein integers , respectively . 
 If f is allowed to be any Euclidean function , then the list of possible D values for which the domain is Euclidean is not yet known . The first example of a Euclidean domain that was not norm @-@ Euclidean ( with D = 69 ) was published in 1994 . In 1973 , Weinberger proved that a quadratic integer ring with D > 0 is Euclidean if , and only if , it is a principal ideal domain , provided that the generalized Riemann hypothesis holds . 
 = = = Noncommutative rings = = = 
 The Euclidean algorithm may be applied to noncommutative rings such as the set of Hurwitz quaternions . Let α and β represent two elements from such a ring . They have a common right divisor δ if α 
 = <unk> and β = 
 <unk> for some choice of ξ and η in the ring . Similarly , they have a common left divisor if α 
 = <unk> and β = 
 <unk> for some choice of ξ and η in the ring . Since multiplication is not commutative , there are two versions of the Euclidean algorithm , one for right divisors and one for left divisors . Choosing the right divisors , the first step in finding the gcd ( α , β ) by the Euclidean algorithm can be written 
 ρ0 
 = α − <unk> = 
 ( ξ − <unk> ) δ 
 where <unk> represents the quotient and ρ0 the remainder . This equation shows that any common right divisor of α and β is likewise a common divisor of the remainder ρ0 . The analogous equation for the left divisors would be 
 ρ0 
 = α − <unk> = 
 δ ( ξ − <unk> ) . 
 With either choice , the process is repeated as above until the greatest common right or left divisor is identified . As in the Euclidean domain , the " size " of the remainder ρ0 must be strictly smaller than β , and there must be only a finite number of possible sizes for ρ0 , so that the algorithm is guaranteed to terminate . 
 Most of the results for the GCD carry over to noncommutative numbers . For example , Bézout 's identity states that the right gcd ( α , β ) can be expressed as a linear combination of α and β . In other words , there are numbers σ and τ such that 
 <unk> 
 = <unk> + <unk> 
 The analogous identity for the left GCD is nearly the same : 
 <unk> = 
 <unk> + <unk> . 
 Bézout 's identity can be used to solve Diophantine equations . For instance , one of the standard proofs of Lagrange 's four @-@ square theorem , that every positive integer can be represented as a sum of four squares , is based on <unk> GCDs in this way . 
 = Tropical Storm Leslie ( 2000 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Leslie was a weak , short @-@ lived tropical cyclone that was never well @-@ organized ; however , its precursor was costlier than any other tropical cyclone in the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season . The twelfth named storm of the season , Leslie formed on October 4 over eastern Florida as a subtropical cyclone , out of a trough of low pressure . Strengthening over open waters , it attained enough tropical characteristics to be reclassified as Tropical Storm Leslie on October 5 . The storm reached peak winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) before wind shear weakened it , and on October 7 transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over the open Atlantic Ocean . Leslie lasted three more days before losing its identity . 
 The precursor to Leslie produced torrential rainfall across Florida , peaking at 17 @.@ 5 in ( 440 mm ) . The flooding damaged thousands of houses and caused three indirect deaths . Damage in southern Florida totaled $ 950 million ( 2000 USD ) , around half of which was from agricultural damage . After the flooding , portions of south Florida were declared a disaster area . Because of the limited impact as a tropical cyclone , the name Leslie was not retired in the Spring of 2001 . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On September 27 , a tropical wave entered the eastern Caribbean Sea , believed to be the same that spawned Hurricane Isaac . It moved generally westward , and remained weak with sporadic thunderstorm activity . The wave traversed around the periphery of Hurricane Keith , and by October 2 , the system produced a mid @-@ level circulation just south of western Cuba . It continued to organize , prompting a reconnaissance aircraft to investigate the area . The system lacked a surface circulation center and remained an elongated trough of low pressure . The tropical wave interacted with an approaching frontal trough , while its mid @-@ level center turned to the northeast and made landfall near Sarasota , Florida on October 4 . 
 While over land , a surface circulation developed near Orlando , and the National Hurricane Center designated the system as Subtropical Depression One . The subtropical designation was because the convection was far @-@ removed from the center . Additionally , an upper @-@ level trough provided outflow , instead of an anticyclone as found in tropical cyclones . The subtropical depression moved to the east @-@ northeast , and steadily organized as deep convection developed closer to the center . Initially , the strongest winds were 175 mi ( 280 km ) from the center , but by the morning of October 5 , the distance decreased to 85 mi ( 135 km ) . Based on its organization and winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) , the system was re @-@ designated as Tropical Storm Leslie . 
 The National Hurricane Center initially forecast further intensification to 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) , although the agency also noted that the circulation could dissipate , due its fast forward motion toward the east @-@ northeast . Ultimately , wind shear prohibited significant strengthening , and Leslie attained peak winds of 45 mph ( 70 km / h ) . The storm interacted with an approaching cold front and became extratropical on October 7 , 375 mi ( 600 km ) north of Bermuda . It accelerated to the northeast and passed over Newfoundland on October 8 . The remnants of Leslie turned to the east , then southeast , strengthening to near @-@ hurricane @-@ force winds before losing its identity near Ireland on October 10 . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 The National Hurricane Center predicted the trough of low pressure to drop very heavy rainfall across western Cuba and Florida . The National Weather Service in Miami issued a flood watch for southern Florida , stating that the system could produce flooding on roads and in low @-@ lying areas . In general , however , there was little warning for the flooding in South Florida . While Leslie was moving east @-@ northeastward , it posed a threat to Bermuda , prompting officials to issue a tropical storm watch at 0300 UTC on October 6 . Six hours later , tropical storm watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning . However , the storm passed well to the west , and the warnings were dropped by late on October 6 .

 The precursor disturbance of Leslie dropped heavy rainfall across central and western Cuba , peaking at 8 @.@ 25 in ( 210 mm ) in the province of Havana . Numerous other areas reported over four in ( 100 mm ) , as well . In southern Florida , the disturbance produced torrential rainfall , with a maximum of 17 @.@ 5 in ( 440 mm ) in South Miami . Two areas , one to the south of Lake Okeechobee and the other being the Miami area , received over 10 in ( 255 mm ) of rain . The torrential rainfall was described as similar to Hurricane Irene one year prior . The system produced two weak F0 tornadoes in Miami @-@ Dade County , one of which tore off a roof of a fire station in Hialeah . 
 The torrential rainfall in Florida flooded about 93 @,@ 000 homes , affecting 214 @,@ 000 residents in Miami @-@ Dade County . An incomplete damage survey of Miami @-@ Dade County indicated the flooding destroyed 1 @,@ 005 houses , severely damaged 1 @,@ 358 , and caused minor damage to 3 @,@ 443 . The flood waters , which were four ft ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) deep in places , stranded many in their houses , forcing them to use canoes or inflatable rafts to move to higher grounds . All schools in the Miami area were closed , and all non @-@ essential Miami @-@ Dade County employees were asked to stay home . Numerous flights in Miami International Airport were canceled or delayed , although the airport remained opened . The flooding , which was greatest in Sweetwater , West Miami , Hialeah , Opa @-@ locka , and Pembroke Park , lasted up to a week in areas . The extreme flooding damaged electrical stations , leaving more than 27 @,@ 000 without power . The flooding indirectly killed three people , two from drowning as a result of driving vehicles into deep water , and one when a man fell from a tall building while trying to unclog a roof drain . Property damage totaled $ 450 million . 
 Flood waters in Miami @-@ Dade County covered about 40 @,@ 000 acres ( 160 km ² ) of farmland . The damage was worsened since the flooding occurred at the beginning of the planting period for the winter season . Flooded nurseries and fields resulted in about $ 500 million in agricultural damage , including $ 60 million in tropical fruit and $ 397 million in ornamental crops . The U.S. Department of Agriculture declared 16 Florida counties , including Miami @-@ Dade , Collier , and Palm Beach , as primary disaster areas due to flooding , making farmers and their families there eligible for USDA emergency farm loans . The same agency made 22 other counties , including Broward , eligible for loans due to their proximity to the disaster areas . 
 As an extratropical storm , Leslie produced winds of around 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) while making landfall in Newfoundland . It also caused waves of up to 16 ft ( five m ) in height , and brought up to one in ( 30 mm ) of rain . The overall impact in this region was minor . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 In the immediate aftermath , cleanup workers could not work until the flood waters receded . In addition , abandoned cars blocked the path of utility workers . Following the storm , President Bill Clinton declared Broward , Collier , Miami @-@ Dade , and Monroe Counties as disaster areas , allowing for the use of federal funds for the disaster victims . In addition , Miami @-@ Dade and Broward Counties were declared eligible for Federal Infrastructure Assistance , which provided for 75 % of the debris removal cost and the repairing or replacement of public roads , buildings , parks , and treatment plants . By ten days after the storm , government agencies distributed 105 @,@ 000 meals , 141 @,@ 000 US gal ( 530 @,@ 000 L ) of water , and 357 @,@ 000 lb ( 162 @,@ 000 kg ) of ice . Thousands visited the five Disaster Recovery Centers , where information on disaster @-@ related issues was given . By around two months after the flooding , over 51 @,@ 000 people applied for federal aid , with assistance totaling to more than $ 170 million . 
 = Maya Angelou = 
 Maya Angelou ( / <unk> <unk> / ; born Marguerite Annie Johnson ; April 4 , 1928 – May 28 , 2014 ) was an American poet , memoirist , and civil rights activist . She published seven autobiographies , three books of essays , several books of poetry , and was credited with a list of plays , movies , and television shows spanning over 50 years . She received dozens of awards and more than 50 honorary degrees . Angelou is best known for her series of seven autobiographies , which focus on her childhood and early adult experiences . The first , I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings ( 1969 ) , tells of her life up to the age of 17 and brought her international recognition and acclaim . 
 She became a poet and writer after a series of occupations as a young adult , including fry cook , sex worker , nightclub dancer and performer , cast member of the opera Porgy and Bess , coordinator for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , and journalist in Egypt and Ghana during the decolonization of Africa . She was an actor , writer , director , and producer of plays , movies , and public television programs . In 1982 , she earned the first lifetime Reynolds Professorship of American Studies at Wake Forest University in Winston @-@ Salem , North Carolina . She was active in the Civil Rights movement and worked with Martin Luther King , Jr. and Malcolm X. Beginning in the 1990s , she made around 80 appearances a year on the lecture circuit , something she continued into her eighties . In 1993 , Angelou recited her poem " On the Pulse of Morning " ( 1993 ) at President Bill Clinton 's inauguration , making her the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at President John F. Kennedy 's inauguration in 1961 . 
 With the publication of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings , Angelou publicly discussed aspects of her personal life . She was respected as a spokesperson for black people and women , and her works have been considered a defense of Black culture . Attempts have been made to ban her books from some U.S. libraries , but her works are widely used in schools and universities worldwide . Angelou 's major works have been labeled as autobiographical fiction , but many critics have characterized them as autobiographies . She made a deliberate attempt to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing , changing , and expanding the genre . Her books center on themes such as racism , identity , family , and travel .

 = = = Early years = = = 
 Marguerite Annie Johnson was born in St. Louis , Missouri , on April 4 , 1928 , the second child of Bailey Johnson , a doorman and navy dietitian , and Vivian ( Baxter ) Johnson , a nurse and card dealer . Angelou 's older brother , Bailey Jr . , nicknamed Marguerite " Maya " , derived from " My " or " Mya Sister " . When Angelou was three and her brother four , their parents ' " calamitous marriage " ended , and their father sent them to Stamps , Arkansas , alone by train , to live with their paternal grandmother , Annie Henderson . In " an astonishing exception " to the harsh economics of African Americans of the time , Angelou 's grandmother prospered financially during the Great Depression and World War II because the general store she owned sold needed basic commodities and because " she made wise and honest investments " . 
 Four years later , the children 's father " came to Stamps without warning " and returned them to their mother 's care in St. Louis . At the age of eight , while living with her mother , Angelou was sexually abused and raped by her mother 's boyfriend , a man named Freeman . She told her brother , who told the rest of their family . Freeman was found guilty but was jailed for only one day . Four days after his release , he was murdered , probably by Angelou 's uncles . Angelou became mute for almost five years , believing , as she stated , " I thought , my voice killed him ; I killed that man , because I told his name . And then I thought I would never speak again , because my voice would kill anyone ... " According to Marcia Ann Gillespie and her colleagues , who wrote a biography about Angelou , it was during this period of silence when Angelou developed her extraordinary memory , her love for books and literature , and her ability to listen and observe the world around her . 
 Shortly after Freeman 's murder , Angelou and her brother were sent back to their grandmother . Angelou credits a teacher and friend of her family , Mrs. Bertha Flowers , with helping her speak again . Flowers introduced her to authors such as Charles Dickens , William Shakespeare , Edgar Allan Poe , Douglas Johnson , and James Weldon Johnson , authors who would affect her life and career , as well as black female artists like Frances Harper , Anne Spencer , and Jessie Fauset . 
 When Angelou was 14 , she and her brother moved in with their mother once again , who had since moved to Oakland , California . During World War II , Angelou attended the California Labor School . Before graduating , she worked as the first black female streetcar conductor in San Francisco . Three weeks after completing school , at the age of 17 , she gave birth to her son , Clyde ( who later changed his name to Guy Johnson ) . 
 = = = Adulthood and early career : 1951 – 61 = = = 
 In 1951 , Angelou married Greek electrician , former sailor , and aspiring musician Tosh Angelos , despite the condemnation of interracial relationships at the time and the disapproval of her mother . She took modern dance classes during this time , and met dancers and choreographers Alvin Ailey and Ruth Beckford . Angelou and Ailey formed a dance team , calling themselves " Al and Rita " , and performed modern dance at fraternal black organizations throughout San Francisco , but never became successful . Angelou , her new husband , and her son moved to New York City so she could study African dance with Trinidadian dancer Pearl Primus , but they returned to San Francisco a year later . 
 After Angelou 's marriage ended in 1954 , she danced professionally in clubs around San Francisco , including the nightclub the Purple Onion , where she sang and danced to calypso music . Up to that point she went by the name of " Marguerite Johnson " , or " Rita " , but at the strong suggestion of her managers and supporters at the Purple Onion she changed her professional name to " Maya Angelou " , a " distinctive name " that set her apart and captured the feel of her calypso dance performances . During 1954 and 1955 , Angelou toured Europe with a production of the opera Porgy and Bess . She began her practice of learning the language of every country she visited , and in a few years she gained proficiency in several languages . In 1957 , riding on the popularity of calypso , Angelou recorded her first album , Miss Calypso , which was reissued as a CD in 1996 . She appeared in an off @-@ Broadway review that inspired the 1957 film Calypso Heat Wave , in which Angelou sang and performed her own compositions . 
 Angelou met novelist John Oliver Killens in 1959 and , at his urging , moved to New York to concentrate on her writing career . She joined the Harlem Writers Guild , where she met several major African @-@ American authors , including John Henrik Clarke , Rosa Guy , Paule Marshall , and Julian Mayfield , and was published for the first time . In 1960 , after meeting civil rights leader Martin Luther King , Jr. and hearing him speak , she and Killens organized " the legendary " Cabaret for Freedom to benefit the Southern Christian Leadership Conference ( SCLC ) , and she was named SCLC 's Northern Coordinator . According to scholar Lyman B. Hagen , her contributions to civil rights as a fundraiser and SCLC organizer were successful and " eminently effective " . Angelou also began her pro @-@ Castro and anti @-@ apartheid activism during this time . 
 = = = Africa to Caged Bird : 1961 – 69 = = = 
 In 1961 , Angelou performed in Jean Genet 's play The Blacks , along with Abbey Lincoln , Roscoe Lee Brown , James Earl Jones , Louis Gossett , Godfrey Cambridge , and Cicely Tyson . Also in 1961 , she met South African freedom fighter Vusumzi Make ; they never officially married . She and her son Guy moved with Make to Cairo , where Angelou worked as an associate editor at the weekly English @-@ language newspaper The Arab Observer . In 1962 , her relationship with Make ended , and she and Guy moved to Accra , Ghana , he to attend college , but he was seriously injured in an automobile accident . Angelou remained in Accra for his recovery and ended up staying there until 1965 . She became an administrator at the University of Ghana , and was active in the African @-@ American expatriate community . She was a feature editor for The African Review , a freelance writer for the Ghanaian Times , wrote and broadcast for Radio Ghana , and worked and performed for Ghana 's National Theatre . She performed in a revival of The Blacks in Geneva and Berlin . 
 In Accra , she became close friends with Malcolm X during his visit in the early 1960s . Angelou returned to the U.S. in 1965 to help him build a new civil rights organization , the Organization of Afro @-@ American Unity ; he was assassinated shortly afterward . Devastated and adrift , she joined her brother in Hawaii , where she resumed her singing career , and then moved back to Los Angeles to focus on her writing career . She worked as a market researcher in Watts and witnessed the riots in the summer of 1965 . She acted in and wrote plays , and returned to New York in 1967 . She met her lifelong friend Rosa Guy and renewed her friendship with James Baldwin , whom she had met in Paris in the 1950s and called " my brother " , during this time . Her friend Jerry Purcell provided Angelou with a stipend to support her writing . 
 In 1968 , Martin Luther King , Jr. asked Angelou to organize a march . She agreed , but " postpones again " , and in what Gillespie calls " a macabre twist of fate " , he was assassinated on her 40th birthday ( April 4 ) . Devastated again , she was encouraged out of her depression by her friend James Baldwin . As Gillespie states , " If 1968 was a year of great pain , loss , and sadness , it was also the year when America first witnessed the breadth and depth of Maya Angelou 's spirit and creative genius " . Despite having almost no experience , she wrote , produced , and narrated Blacks , Blues , Black ! , a ten @-@ part series of documentaries about the connection between blues music and black Americans ' African heritage , and what Angelou called the " <unk> still current in the U.S. " for National Educational Television , the precursor of PBS . Also in 1968 , inspired at a dinner party she attended with Baldwin , cartoonist Jules Feiffer , and his wife Judy , and challenged by Random House editor Robert Loomis , she wrote her first autobiography , I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings , published in 1969 , which brought her international recognition and acclaim .

 Angelou 's Georgia , Georgia , produced by a Swedish film company and filmed in Sweden , the first screenplay written by a black woman , was released in 1972 . She also wrote the film 's soundtrack , despite having very little additional input in the filming of the movie . Angelou married Welsh carpenter and ex @-@ husband of Germaine Greer , Paul du Feu , in San Francisco in 1973 . Over the next ten years , as Gillespie has stated , " She [ Angelou ] had accomplished more than many artists hope to achieve in a lifetime " . Angelou worked as a composer , writing for singer Roberta Flack , and composing movie scores . She wrote articles , short stories , TV scripts , documentaries , autobiographies , and poetry , produced plays , and was named visiting professor at several colleges and universities . She was " a reluctant actor " , and was nominated for a Tony Award in 1973 for her role in Look Away . As a theater director , in 1988 she undertook a revival of Errol John 's play Moon on a Rainbow Shawl at the Almeida Theatre in London . 
 In 1977 , Angelou appeared in a supporting role in the television mini @-@ series Roots . She was given a multitude of awards during this period , including over thirty honorary degrees from colleges and universities from all over the world . In the late 1970s , Angelou met Oprah Winfrey when Winfrey was a TV anchor in Baltimore , Maryland ; Angelou would later become Winfrey 's close friend and mentor . In 1981 , Angelou and du Feu divorced . She returned to the southern United States in 1981 because she felt she had to come to terms with her past there , and despite having no bachelor 's degree , accepted the lifetime Reynolds Professorship of American Studies at Wake Forest University in Winston @-@ Salem , North Carolina , where she was one of only a few full @-@ time professors . From that point on , she considered herself " a teacher who writes " . Angelou taught a variety of subjects that reflected her interests , including philosophy , ethics , theology , science , theater , and writing . The Winston @-@ Salem Journal reported that even though she made many friends on campus , " she never quite lived down all of the criticism from people who thought she was more of a celebrity than an intellect ... [ and ] an overpaid figurehead " . The last course she taught at Wake Forest was in 2011 , but she was planning to teach another course in late 2014 . Her final speaking engagement at the university was in late 2013 . Beginning in the 1990s , Angelou actively participated in the lecture circuit in a customized tour bus , something she continued into her eighties . 
 In 1993 , Angelou recited her poem " On the Pulse of Morning " at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton , becoming the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at President John F. Kennedy 's inauguration in 1961 . Her recitation resulted in more fame and recognition for her previous works , and broadened her appeal " across racial , economic , and educational boundaries " . The recording of the poem won a Grammy Award . In June 1995 , she delivered what Richard Long called her " second ' public ' poem " , entitled " A Brave and Startling Truth " , which commemorated the 50th anniversary of the United Nations . 
 Angelou achieved her goal of directing a feature film in 1996 , Down in the Delta , which featured actors such as Alfre Woodard and Wesley Snipes . Also in 1996 , she collaborated with R & B artists Ashford & Simpson on seven of the eleven tracks of their album Been Found . The album was responsible for three of Angelou 's only Billboard chart appearances . In 2000 , she created a successful collection of products for Hallmark , including greeting cards and decorative household items . She responded to critics who charged her with being too commercial by stating that " the enterprise was perfectly in keeping with her role as ' the people 's poet ' " . More than thirty years after Angelou began writing her life story , she completed her sixth autobiography A Song Flung Up to Heaven , in 2002 . 
 Angelou campaigned for the Democratic Party in the 2008 presidential primaries , giving her public support to Senator Hillary Clinton . In the run @-@ up to the January Democratic primary in South Carolina , the Clinton campaign ran ads featuring Angelou 's endorsement . The ads were part of the campaign 's efforts to rally support in the Black community ; but Obama won the South Carolina primary , finishing 29 points ahead of Clinton and taking 80 % of the Black vote . When Clinton 's campaign ended , Angelou put her support behind Senator Barack Obama , who went on to win the election and become the first African @-@ American president of the United States . She stated , " We are growing up beyond the <unk> of racism and sexism . " 
 In late 2010 , Angelou donated her personal papers and career memorabilia to the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem . They consisted of over 340 boxes of documents that featured her handwritten notes on yellow legal pads for I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings , a 1982 telegram from Coretta Scott King , fan mail , and personal and professional correspondence from colleagues such as her editor Robert Loomis . In 2011 , Angelou served as a consultant for the Martin Luther King , Jr . Memorial in Washington , D.C. She spoke out in opposition to a paraphrase of a quotation by King that appeared on the memorial , saying , “ The quote makes Dr. Martin Luther King look like an arrogant twit " , and demanded that it be changed . Eventually , the paraphrase was removed . 
 In 2013 , at the age of 85 , Angelou published the seventh autobiography in her series , titled Mom & Me & Mom , that focuses on her relationship with her mother . 
 = = = Personal life = = = 
 Evidence suggests that Angelou was partially descended from the Mende people of West Africa . A 2008 PBS documentary found that Angelou 's maternal great @-@ grandmother Mary Lee , who had been emancipated after the Civil War , became pregnant by her white former owner , John Savin . Savin forced Lee to sign a false statement accusing another man of being the father of her child . After Savin was indicted for forcing Lee to commit perjury , and despite the discovery that Savin was the father , a jury found him not guilty . Lee was sent to the Clinton County poorhouse in Missouri with her daughter , Marguerite Baxter , who became Angelou 's grandmother . Angelou described Lee as " that poor little Black girl , physically and mentally bruised . " 
 The details of Angelou 's life described in her seven autobiographies and in numerous interviews , speeches , and articles tended to be inconsistent . Critic Mary Jane Lupton has explained that when Angelou spoke about her life , she did so eloquently but informally and " with no time chart in front of her " . For example , she was married at least twice , but never clarified the number of times she had been married , " for fear of sounding frivolous " ; according to her autobiographies and to Gillespie , she married Tosh Angelos in 1951 and Paul du Feu in 1973 , and began her relationship with Vusumzi Make in 1961 , but never formally married him . Angelou had one son Guy , whose birth was described in her first autobiography , one grandson , and two great @-@ grandchildren , and according to Gillespie , a large group of friends and extended family . Angelou 's mother Vivian Baxter died in 1991 and her brother Bailey Johnson , Jr . , died in 2000 after a series of strokes ; both were important figures in her life and her books . In 1981 , the mother of her son Guy 's child disappeared with Angelou 's grandson ; it took four years to find him . 
 In 2009 , the gossip website TMZ erroneously reported that Angelou had been hospitalized in Los Angeles when she was alive and well in St. Louis , which resulted in rumors of her death and according to Angelou , concern among her friends and family worldwide . In 2013 , Angelou told her friend Oprah Winfrey that she had studied courses offered by the Unity Church , which were spiritually significant to her . She did not earn a university degree , but according to Gillespie it was Angelou 's preference that she be called " Dr. Angelou " by people outside of her family and close friends . She owned two homes in Winston @-@ Salem , North Carolina , and a " lordly brownstone " in Harlem , which was purchased in 2004 and was full of her " growing library " of books she collected throughout her life , artwork collected over the span of many decades , and well @-@ stocked kitchens . Younge reported that in her Harlem home resides several African wall hangings and Angelou 's collection of paintings , including ones of several jazz trumpeters , a watercolor of Rosa Parks , and a Faith Ringgold work entitled " Maya 's Quilt Of Life " . 
 According to Gillespie , she hosted several celebrations per year at her main residence in Winston @-@ Salem ; " her skill in the kitchen is the stuff of legend — from haute cuisine to down @-@ home comfort food " . The Winston @-@ Salem Journal stated , " Securing an invitation to one of Angelou ’ s Thanksgiving dinners , Christmas tree decorating parties or birthday parties was among the most coveted invitations in town " . The New York Times , describing Angelou 's residence history in New York City , stated that she regularly hosted elaborate New Year 's Day parties . She combined her cooking and writing skills in her 2004 book Hallelujah ! The Welcome Table , which featured 73 recipes , many of which she learned from her grandmother and mother , accompanied by 28 vignettes . She followed up with her second cookbook , Great Food , All Day Long : Cook <unk> , Eat Smart in 2010 , which focused on weight loss and portion control . 
 Beginning with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings , Angelou used the same " writing ritual " for many years . She would wake early in the morning and check into a hotel room , where the staff was instructed to remove any pictures from the walls . She would write on legal pads while lying on the bed , with only a bottle of sherry , a deck of cards to play solitaire , Roget 's Thesaurus , and the Bible , and would leave by the early afternoon . She would average 10 – 12 pages of written material a day , which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening . Angelou went through this process to " enchant " herself , and as she said in a 1989 interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation , " relive the agony , the anguish , the Sturm und Drang . " She placed herself back in the time she wrote about , even traumatic experiences like her rape in Caged Bird , in order to " tell the human truth " about her life . Angelou stated that she played cards in order to get to that place of enchantment and in order to access her memories more effectively . She stated , " It may take an hour to get into it , but once I 'm in it — ha ! It 's so delicious ! " She did not find the process cathartic ; rather , she found relief in " telling the truth " . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 Angelou died on the morning of May 28 , 2014 . She was found by her nurse . Although Angelou had reportedly been in poor health and had canceled recent scheduled appearances , she was working on another book , an autobiography about her experiences with national and world leaders . During her memorial service at Wake Forest University , her son Guy Johnson stated that despite being in constant pain due to her dancing career and respiratory failure , she wrote four books during the last ten years of her life . He said , " She left this mortal plane with no loss of acuity and no loss in comprehension " . 
 Tributes to Angelou and condolences were paid by artists , entertainers , and world leaders , including President Bill Clinton , and President Barack Obama , whose sister was named after Angelou . Harold Augenbraum , from the National Book Foundation , said that Angelou 's " legacy is one that all writers and readers across the world can admire and aspire to . " The week after Angelou 's death , I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings rose to # 1 on Amazon.com 's bestseller list . 
 On May 29 , 2014 , Mount Zion Baptist Church in Winston @-@ Salem , of which Angelou was a member for 30 years , held a public memorial service to honor Angelou . On June 7 , a private memorial service was held at Wait Chapel on the campus of Wake Forest University in Winston @-@ Salem . The memorial was shown live on local stations in the Winston @-@ Salem / Triad area and streamed live on the university web site with speeches from her son , Oprah Winfrey , Michelle Obama , and Bill Clinton . On June 15 , a memorial was held at Glide Memorial Church in San Francisco , where Angelou was a member for many years . Rev. Cecil Williams , Mayor Ed Lee , and former mayor Willie Brown spoke . 
 In 2015 a United States Postal Service stamp was issued commemorating Maya Angelou with the Joan Walsh Anglund quote " A bird doesn ’ t sing because it has an answer , it sings because it has a song " , though the stamp mistakenly attributes the quote to Angelou . The quote is from Anglund 's book of poems A Cup of Sun ( 1967 ) . 
 = = Works = = 
 Angelou wrote a total of seven autobiographies . According to scholar Mary Jane Lupton , Angelou 's third autobiography Singin ' and Swingin ' and Gettin ' Merry Like Christmas marked the first time a well @-@ known African @-@ American autobiographer had written a third volume about her life . Her books " stretch over time and place " , from Arkansas to Africa and back to the U.S. , and take place from the beginnings of World War II to the assassination of Martin Luther King , Jr . She published her seventh autobiography Mom & Me & Mom in 2013 , at the age of 85 . Critics have tended to judge Angelou 's subsequent autobiographies " in light of the first " , with Caged Bird receiving the highest praise . Angelou wrote five collections of essays , which writer Hilton Als called her " wisdom books " and " homilies strung together with autobiographical texts " . Angelou used the same editor throughout her writing career , Robert Loomis , an executive editor at Random House ; he retired in 2011 and has been called " one of publishing 's hall of fame editors . " Angelou said regarding Loomis : " We have a relationship that 's kind of famous among publishers " . 
 Angelou 's long and extensive career also included poetry , plays , screenplays for television and film , directing , acting , and public speaking . She was a prolific writer of poetry ; her volume Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ' fore I Diiie ( 1971 ) was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize , and she was chosen by President Bill Clinton to recite her poem " On the Pulse of Morning " during his inauguration in 1993 . 
 Angelou 's successful acting career included roles in numerous plays , films , and television programs , including her appearance in the television mini @-@ series Roots in 1977 . Her screenplay , Georgia , Georgia ( 1972 ) , was the first original script by a black woman to be produced and she was the first African @-@ American woman to direct a major motion picture , Down in the Delta , in 1998 .

 = = = Influence = = = 
 When I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings was published in 1969 , Angelou was hailed as a new kind of memoirist , one of the first African @-@ American women who were able to publicly discuss their personal lives . According to scholar Hilton Als , up to that point , black female writers were marginalized to the point that they were unable to present themselves as central characters in the literature they wrote . Scholar John McWhorter agreed , seeing Angelou 's works , which he called " tracts " , as " apologetic writing " . He placed Angelou in the tradition of African @-@ American literature as a defense of black culture , which he called " a literary manifestation of the imperative that reigned in the black scholarship of the period " . Writer Julian Mayfield , who called Caged Bird " a work of art that eludes description " , argued that Angelou 's autobiographies set a precedent for not only other black women writers , but also African @-@ American autobiography as a whole . Als said that Caged Bird marked one of the first times that a black autobiographer could , as he put it , " write about blackness from the inside , without apology or defense " . Through the writing of her autobiography , Angelou became recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for blacks and women . It made her " without a doubt , ... America 's most visible black woman autobiographer " , and " a major autobiographical voice of the time " . As writer Gary Younge said , " Probably more than almost any other writer alive , Angelou 's life literally is her work . " 
 Als said that Caged Bird helped increase black feminist writings in the 1970s , less through its originality than " its resonance in the prevailing Zeitgeist " , or the time in which it was written , at the end of the American Civil Rights movement . Als also claimed that Angelou 's writings , more interested in self @-@ revelation than in politics or feminism , have freed other female writers to " open themselves up without shame to the eyes of the world " . Angelou critic Joanne M. Braxton stated that Caged Bird was " perhaps the most aesthetically pleasing " autobiography written by an African @-@ American woman in its era . Angelou 's poetry has influenced the modern hip @-@ hop music community , including artists such as Kanye West , Common , Tupac Shakur , and Nicki Minaj . 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 Reviewer Elsie B. Washington , most likely due to President Clinton 's choice of Angelou to recite her poem " On the Pulse of Morning " at his 1993 inauguration , called her " the black woman 's poet laureate " . Sales of the paperback version of her books and poetry rose by 300 – 600 % the week after Angelou 's recitation . Random House , which published the poem later that year , had to reprint 400 @,@ 000 copies of all her books to keep up with the demand . They sold more of her books in January 1993 than they did in all of 1992 , accounting for a 1200 % increase . Angelou famously said , in response to criticism regarding using the details of her life in her work , " I agree with Balzac and 19th @-@ century writers , black and white , who say , ' I write for money ' " . Younge , speaking after the publication of Angelou 's third book of essays , Letter to My Daughter ( 2008 ) , has said , " For the last couple of decades she has merged her various talents into a kind of performance art — issuing a message of personal and social uplift by blending poetry , song and conversation " . 
 Angelou 's books , especially I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings , have been criticized by many parents , causing their removal from school curricula and library shelves . According to the National Coalition Against Censorship , parents and schools have objected to Caged Bird 's depictions of lesbianism , premarital cohabitation , pornography , and violence . Some have been critical of the book 's sexually explicit scenes , use of language , and irreverent depictions of religion . Caged Bird appeared third on the American Library Association ( ALA ) list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990 – 2000 and sixth on the ALA 's 2000 – 2009 list .

 Angelou was honored by universities , literary organizations , government agencies , and special interest groups . Her honors included a Pulitzer Prize nomination for her book of poetry , Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ' fore I Diiie , a Tony Award nomination for her role in the 1973 play Look Away , and three Grammys for her spoken word albums . She served on two presidential committees , and was awarded the Spingarn Medal in 1994 , the National Medal of Arts in 2000 , and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011 . Angelou was awarded over fifty honorary degrees . 
 = = = Uses in education = = = 
 Angelou 's autobiographies have been used in narrative and multicultural approaches in teacher education . Jocelyn A. Glazier , a professor at George Washington University , has trained teachers how to " talk about race " in their classrooms with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings and Gather Together in My Name . According to Glazier , Angelou 's use of understatement , self @-@ mockery , humor , and irony have left readers of Angelou 's autobiographies unsure of what she left out and how they should respond to the events she described . Angelou 's depictions of her experiences of racism have forced white readers to explore their feelings about race and their own " privileged status " . Glazier found that critics have focused on where Angelou fits within the genre of African @-@ American autobiography and on her literary techniques , but readers have tended to react to her storytelling with " surprise , particularly when [ they ] enter the text with certain expectations about the genre of autobiography " . 
 Educator Daniel Challener , in his 1997 book Stories of Resilience in Childhood , analyzed the events in Caged Bird to illustrate resiliency in children . Challener argued that Angelou 's book has provided a " useful framework " for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya have faced and how their communities have helped them succeed . Psychologist Chris <unk> has reported using Caged Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self @-@ concept and self @-@ esteem , ego resilience , industry versus inferiority , effects of abuse , parenting styles , sibling and friendship relations , gender issues , cognitive development , puberty , and identity formation in adolescence . He found Caged Bird a " highly effective " tool for providing real @-@ life examples of these psychological concepts . 
 = = Poetry = = 
 Angelou is best known for her seven autobiographies , but she was also a prolific and successful poet . She was called " the black woman 's poet laureate " , and her poems have been called the anthems of African Americans . Angelou studied and began writing poetry at a young age , and used poetry and other great literature to cope with her rape as a young girl , as described in Caged Bird . According to scholar Yasmin Y. DeGout , literature also affected Angelou 's sensibilities as the poet and writer she became , especially the " liberating discourse that would evolve in her own poetic canon " . 
 Many critics consider Angelou 's autobiographies more important than her poetry . Although all her books have been best @-@ sellers , her poetry has not been perceived to be as serious as her prose and has been understudied . Her poems were more interesting when she recited and performed them , and many critics emphasized the public aspect of her poetry . Angelou 's lack of critical acclaim has been attributed to both the public nature of many of her poems and to Angelou 's popular success , and to critics ' preferences for poetry as a written form rather than a verbal , performed one . Zofia Burr has countered Angelou 's critics by condemning them for not taking into account Angelou 's larger purposes in her writing : " to be representative rather than individual , authoritative rather than confessional " . 
 = = Style and genre in autobiographies = = 
 Angelou 's use of fiction @-@ writing techniques such as dialogue , characterization , and development of theme , setting , plot , and language has often resulted in the placement of her books into the genre of autobiographical fiction . Angelou made a deliberate attempt in her books to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing , changing , and expanding the genre . Scholar Mary Jane Lupton argues that all of Angelou 's autobiographies conform to the genre 's standard structure : they are written by a single author , they are chronological , and they contain elements of character , technique , and theme . Angelou recognizes that there are fictional aspects to her books ; Lupton agrees , stating that Angelou tended to " diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth " , which parallels the conventions of much of African @-@ American autobiography written during the abolitionist period of U.S. history , when as both Lupton and African @-@ American scholar Crispin <unk> put it , the truth was censored out of the need for self @-@ protection . Scholar Lyman B. Hagen places Angelou in the long tradition of African @-@ American autobiography , but claims that Angelou created a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form . 
 According to African @-@ American literature scholar Pierre A. Walker , the challenge for much of the history of African @-@ American literature was that its authors have had to confirm its status as literature before they could accomplish their political goals , which was why Angelou 's editor Robert Loomis was able to dare her into writing Caged Bird by challenging her to write an autobiography that could be considered " high art " . Angelou acknowledged that she followed the slave narrative tradition of " speaking in the first @-@ person singular talking about the first @-@ person plural , always saying I meaning ' we ' " . Scholar John McWhorter calls Angelou 's books " tracts " that defend African @-@ American culture and fight negative stereotypes . According to McWhorter , Angelou structured her books , which to him seem to be written more for children than for adults , to support her defense of black culture . McWhorter sees Angelou as she depicts herself in her autobiographies " as a kind of stand @-@ in figure for the black American in Troubled Times " . McWhorter views Angelou 's works as dated , but recognizes that " she has helped to pave the way for contemporary black writers who are able to enjoy the luxury of being merely individuals , no longer representatives of the race , only themselves " . Scholar Lynn Z. Bloom compares Angelou 's works to the writings of Frederick Douglass , stating that both fulfilled the same purpose : to describe black culture and to interpret it for their wider , white audiences . 
 According to scholar Sondra O 'Neale , Angelou 's poetry can be placed within the African @-@ American oral tradition , and her prose " follows classic technique in <unk> Western forms " . O 'Neale states that Angelou avoided using a " monolithic black language " , and accomplished , through direct dialogue , what O 'Neale calls a " more expected ghetto expressiveness " . McWhorter finds both the language Angelou used in her autobiographies and the people she depicted unrealistic , resulting in a separation between her and her audience . As McWhorter states , " I have never read autobiographical writing where I had such a hard time summoning a sense of how the subject talks , or a sense of who the subject really is " . McWhorter asserts , for example , that key figures in Angelou 's books , like herself , her son Guy , and mother Vivian do not speak as one would expect , and that their speech is " cleaned up " for her readers . Guy , for example , represents the young black male , while Vivian represents the idealized mother figure , and the stiff language they use , as well as the language in Angelou 's text , is intended to prove that blacks can use standard English competently . 
 McWhorter recognizes that much of the reason for Angelou 's style was the " apologetic " nature of her writing . When Angelou wrote Caged Bird at the end of the 1960s , one of the necessary and accepted features of literature at the time was " organic unity " , and one of her goals was to create a book that satisfied that criterion . The events in her books were episodic and crafted like a series of short stories , but their arrangements did not follow a strict chronology . Instead , they were placed to emphasize the themes of her books , which include racism , identity , family , and travel . English literature scholar Valerie Sayers has asserted that " Angelou 's poetry and prose are similar " . They both rely on her " direct voice " , which alternates steady rhythms with syncopated patterns and uses similes and metaphors ( e.g. , the caged bird ) . According to Hagen , Angelou 's works were influenced by both conventional literary and the oral traditions of the African @-@ American community . For example , she referenced over 100 literary characters throughout her books and poetry . In addition , she used the elements of blues music , including the act of testimony when speaking of one 's life and struggles , ironic understatement , and the use of natural metaphors , rhythms , and intonations . Angelou , instead of depending upon plot , used personal and historical events to shape her books .

 = Hurricane Karen ( 2007 ) = 
 Hurricane Karen was the eleventh named storm and fourth hurricane of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season . Karen was a Cape Verde @-@ type hurricane that developed in the eastern tropical Atlantic out of a large tropical wave . The storm briefly reached Category 1 hurricane intensity before slowly weakening due to increased wind shear . As the storm remained away from land , no damages or fatalities were reported in association with Karen . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The system began as a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa on September 21 . The wave was not well @-@ organized with only scattered thunderstorm activity and large area of low pressure . As the system tracked westward south of Cape Verde , deep convection gradually increased , curved banding features became defined , and a poorly defined circulation became evident . Early on September 23 , Dvorak classification estimates were introduced . Little change in organization took place until the evening of September 24 . That evening , the low @-@ level circulation and banding features became better defined as the system tracked west @-@ northwest . Late that evening , the system was declared Tropical Depression Twelve while west @-@ southwest of the Cape Verde islands . 
 The tropical depression quickly intensified into early on September 25 as the system continued to organize , and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Karen that morning . The strengthening trend was temporarily halted , and Karen remained a weak tropical storm with relatively shallow convection . Late that evening , new bursts of deep convection developed with the storm . Early on September 26 , Karen intensified significantly and an inner core began to develop . That morning , a ragged eye developed and the system strengthened into a hurricane with 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) winds . The intensification trend was short @-@ lived , and the storm leveled off that afternoon as upper @-@ level wind shear increased substantially due to the presence of a nearby tropical upper tropospheric trough . The storm became less organized that evening . Hurricane Karen weakened to a tropical storm as flight data from NOAA Hurricane Hunters confirmed surface winds of 72 mph ( 115 km / h ) and a very large wind field late that evening . Operationally , Karen was classified as a strong tropical storm , but was reclassified as a Category 1 hurricane based on data from the reconnaissance flight late on September 26 and the less organized structure of the storm at that time . 
 A slow weakening trend began early on September 27 due to the increased shear while remaining on a west @-@ northwest track . At the same time , the center of circulation became exposed at times due to the southwesterly wind shear . As a result , an unusual wind field was observed in that the strongest winds were recorded well to the east and to the northwest of the center . The weakening trend remained fairly slow that evening as the storm continued to produce persistent deep convection . The weakening trend accelerated on September 28 as the convection weakened and the circulation became more disorganized in the high @-@ shear environment . By that morning , Karen weakened to a minimal tropical storm with 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) winds . Karen also turned abruptly to the north for a short while , as convection interacted with the low @-@ level center and southerly winds increased in the low @-@ level environment . The weakening trend slowed that afternoon as deep convection returned to the disorganized storm . Early on September 29 , the high wind shear continued and Karen weakened to a tropical depression with a very poorly defined center . That afternoon , the circulation dissipated while east of the Lesser Antilles . Remnant squalls continued across the area east of the Lesser Antilles for a few days after dissipation . 
 = = Impact = = 
 The National Hurricane Center briefly assessed a minimal threat to the Lesser Antilles , with one forecaster noting a 5 % probability for the cyclone to produce tropical storm winds on Barbuda . However , Karen stayed in the open Atlantic Ocean and never affected any land area . No incidents of damage or casualties were reported . No ship reports of tropical storm @-@ force or stronger were received . Some of the vorticity from Karen 's remnants may have been responsible for the development of the short @-@ lived Tropical Depression Fifteen on October 11 . 
 = Hurricane Ioke = 
 Hurricane Ioke , also referred to as Typhoon Ioke , was the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Central Pacific . The first storm to form in the Central Pacific in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season , Ioke was a record breaking , long @-@ lived and extremely powerful storm that traversed the Pacific for 17 days , reaching the equivalent of Category 5 status on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale three times . 
 The cyclone developed from the Intertropical Convergence Zone on August 20 far to the south of Hawaii . Encountering warm waters , little wind shear , and well @-@ defined outflow , Ioke intensified from a tropical depression to Category 4 status within 48 hours . Late on August 22 it rapidly weakened to Category 2 status before crossing over Johnston Atoll . Two days later favorable conditions again allowed for rapid strengthening , and Ioke attained Category 5 status on August 25 before crossing the International Date Line . As it continued westward its intensity fluctuated , and on August 31 it passed near Wake Island with winds of 155 mph ( 249 km / h ) . Ioke gradually weakened as it turned northwestward and northward , and by September 6 it had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone . The remnants of Ioke accelerated northeastward and ultimately crossed into Alaska . 
 Ioke did not affect any permanently populated areas in the Central Pacific or Western Pacific basins as a hurricane or a typhoon . A crew of 12 people rode out the hurricane in a hurricane @-@ proof bunker on Johnston Atoll ; the crew estimated winds reached over 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) , which damaged trees on the island but did not impact the island 's bird population . The typhoon left moderate damage on Wake Island totaling $ 88 million ( 2006 USD ) , including blown off roofs and damaged buildings , though the infrastructure of the island was left intact ; all military personnel were evacuated from the island . Later , the extratropical remnants of Ioke produced a severe storm surge along the Alaskan coastline , causing beach erosion . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The Intertropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) spawned a tropical disturbance with a low @-@ level circulation far to the southeast of Hawaiʻi in the middle of August 2006 . Under the influence of a strong westward @-@ moving subtropical ridge to its north , the disturbance tracked nearly due westward , with deep convection in the region increasing and decreasing on a daily basis . It slowly became better organized , and early on August 20 the disturbance developed into Tropical Depression One @-@ C while located about 775 mi ( 1 @,@ 247 km ) south of Honolulu , Hawaii . At the time , there was no convection associated with the ITCZ within 10 ° Longitude . With wind shear practically non @-@ existent and sea surface temperatures of around 82 ° F ( 28 ° C ) , conditions favored strengthening , and operationally the cyclone was forecast to reach minimal hurricane status within four days before beginning to weaken . The depression attained tropical storm status within six hours of developing . The Central Pacific Hurricane Center designated the system with the name Ioke / <unk> / , Hawaiian for the name Joyce . Subsequently , Ioke quickly strengthened , and by late on August 20 the storm developed a central dense overcast and the beginnings of an eyewall ; early on August 21 the storm intensified into a hurricane , just 24 hours after first developing . 
 Hurricane Ioke steadily deepened as it continued west @-@ northwestward , with better definition of the eye and deepening of the eyewall convection . Near the International Date Line a frontal trough turned the hurricane to the northwest , and after a period of rapid deepening Ioke attained winds of 135 mph ( 217 km / h ) early on August 22 while located about 280 mi ( 450 km ) southeast of Johnston Atoll . After maintaining Category 4 status on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale for about 18 hours , southwesterly wind shear slightly disrupted the inner core of the hurricane , and Ioke quickly weakened to winds of about 105 mph ( 169 km / h ) . Late on August 22 , the hurricane passed about 30 mi ( 48 km ) south of Johnston Atoll , with the northeastern portion of the eyewall crossing the atoll early on August 23 . After turning westward later in the day , wind shear began to decrease , allowing a second period of rapid deepening . By August 24 the hurricane maintained a 23 mi ( 37 km ) closed eyewall , and on August 25 Ioke attained Category 5 status on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale while located about 970 mi ( 1 @,@ 560 km ) west @-@ southwest of the Hawaiian Island of Kauaʻi . 
 After maintaining Category 5 status for about 18 hours , Hurricane Ioke weakened slightly due to an eyewall replacement cycle . Completing the cycle on August 26 , the hurricane restrengthened to Category 5 status . The trough to its west tracked further away from the hurricane , allowing the subtropical ridge to build ahead of the hurricane which turned Ioke to the southwest . The overall environment remained very favorable for sustainment of the powerful cyclone . Strong upper @-@ level cyclones far to its northwest provided outflow channels and light wind shear , with warm water temperatures along its path . With the conditions , the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory hurricane model predicted Ioke to reach winds of 220 mph ( 350 km / h ) , with a predicted minimum pressure of 860 mbar ( hPa ) . Early on August 27 , the pressure dropped to 915 mbar ( hPa ) , and shortly thereafter Ioke crossed the International Date Line , becoming a 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) typhoon . 
 Unofficially referred as a super typhoon by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) , Ioke remained at the equivalence of a Category 5 hurricane for about 12 hours after crossing the Date Line . It then began a slight weakening trend on August 28 , due to increased inflow from the ridge to its north . On August 29 , the cyclone turned to the west and west @-@ northwest while tracking around the periphery of the subtropical ridge , and Ioke again reached the equivalence of Category 5 status . The Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) assessed Ioke as attaining peak 10 ‑ minute sustained winds of 120 mph ( 190 km / h ) on August 30 . Later that day , the typhoon weakened to the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane for the final time , and on August 31 Ioke passed very near Wake Island with winds of about 155 mph ( 249 km / h ) . 
 By September 1 , increased wind shear and drier air caused the eye of Ioke to become cloud @-@ filled and elongated , and by September 2 Ioke was undergoing another eyewall replacement cycle . On September 2 , Ioke passed about 50 mi ( 80 km ) north of Minami @-@ Tori @-@ shima with winds of about 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) . Gradual weakening continued , and the typhoon steadily shifted its track to the northwest around the subtropical ridge . A deepening trough turned Ioke to the north @-@ northwest and north , and the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm a few hundred miles east of Japan . After accelerating northeastward , the cyclone began losing tropical characteristics , and the JTWC declared Ioke as an extratropical cyclone on September 5 . The JMA maintained Ioke as a typhoon until a day later , and maintained Ioke as a tropical cyclone until it was declared extratropical midday on September 6 . The extratropical remnants of Ioke were tracked by the JMA until September 7 when it was located near the Aleutian Islands of Alaska . The storm deepened as it approached the Aleutians , and re @-@ developed winds of hurricane @-@ force . It entered the Bering Sea on September 8 , and after turning eastward crossed the Aleutian Islands and entered the Gulf of Alaska . The extratropical remnants of Ioke dissipated near southeastern Alaska on September 12 .

 Late on August 21 , about 24 hours prior to its closest approach , the Central Pacific Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for uninhabited territory of Johnston Island , due to the uncertainty of whether anyone was on the island . A United States Air Force vessel and a 12 person crew were on the island , and after securing their ship the crew took shelter in a hurricane @-@ proof concrete bunker . There were no meteorological observations on the island , but the crew estimated tropical storm force winds lasted for about 27 hours with hurricane @-@ force winds lasting six to eight hours ; peak wind gusts were estimated at 110 to 130 mph ( 180 to 210 km / h ) . The crew sustained no injuries , and their ship received only minor damage . Hurricane Ioke , with a portion of its eye crossing the atoll , left an estimated 15 % of the palm trees on the island with their tops blown off , with some ironwood trees blown over ; the island bird population was unaffected . The hurricane produced rough surf which washed away a portion of a sea wall and an adjacent road .

 Under the threat of the typhoon for several days , two C @-@ 17 Globemaster III airlifters evacuated between 188 – 200 military personnel from Wake Island to Hawaii , the first full @-@ scale evacuation of the island since Typhoon Sarah in 1967 . A buoy just east of the island recorded a pressure of 921 @.@ 5 mbar as Ioke crossed directly over it . Before the typhoon passed just north of the island , an anemometer recorded hurricane @-@ force winds with a peak wind gust of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) before the instrument stopped reporting . Sustained winds were estimated to have reached 155 mph ( 249 km / h ) , with gusts to 190 mph ( 310 km / h ) . The minimum central pressure recorded on the island was 934 mbar at <unk> UTC on August 31 . The typhoon was expected to produce a storm surge of 18 ft ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) and wave heights of 40 ft ( 12 m ) along Wake Island , where the highest point is 20 ft ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) . Additionally , heavy rainfall from the typhoon left buildings flooded , with 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) of standing water found several days after its passage . 
 The powerful winds of Typhoon Ioke caused extensive damage to the island 's power grid , leaving most power lines to buildings and backup generators damaged . The combination of the winds and storm surge flooding damaged 70 % of the buildings in the territory , many of which with moderate roof damage . All low @-@ lying areas were described as being covered with sea water or sand , and the territory was left without running water . Communications were downed on the island , with satellite dishes and cables destroyed . Damage to the infrastructure was extensive , though repairable and less than expected . Damage on the island was estimated at $ 88 million ( 2006 USD , $ 90 million 2007 USD ) . 
 = = = Japan and Alaska = = = 
 On September 1 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ordered the temporary evacuation of its staff on Minami @-@ Tori @-@ shima , under threat of the typhoon . The agency expected high waves and winds on the island . Facilities on the island were damaged , although it was repaired and fully operational within three weeks after the storm . 
 The extratropical remnant of Ioke produced a storm surge and high surf in excess of 30 ft ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) along the southwestern coastline of Alaska , which coincided with the astronomical high tide ; the combination led to minor flooding along Bristol Bay and Yukon @-@ <unk> Delta . Wind gusts peaked at 84 mph ( 135 km / h ) in Unalaska . The system produced moderate to heavy rainfall across the western portion of Alaska , including daily rainfall records of 1 @.@ 15 inches ( 29 mm ) at Bethel and 0 @.@ 67 inches ( 17 mm ) at Kotzebue .

 Hurricane Ioke became one of five hurricanes to reach Category 5 status on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale in the Central North Pacific Ocean , and the only one originating in the basin . With an estimated minimum central pressure of 915 mbar ( 27 @.@ 019 inHg ) , the cyclone attained the lowest estimated surface pressure for any hurricane within the basin , surpassing the previous minimum set by Hurricane Gilma in 1994 . Ioke maintained at least Category 4 status , or wind speeds greater than 131 mph ( 211 km / h ) , for 198 consecutive hours , which was the longest continuous time period at that intensity ever observed for any tropical cyclone anywhere on Earth . Additionally , the cyclone remained at the equivalence of a super typhoon for 174 consecutive hours , which was also a record . As a result of its extended duration and intensity , Hurricane / Typhoon Ioke accrued an Accumulated cyclone energy index of 82 which set a new worldwide record . 
 The United States Coast Guard first performed an aerial assessment of damage on Wake Island on September 2 , three days after the typhoon struck . The flight indicated an overall damage smaller than expected , and reported a lack of oil spill or hazardous material leak . The U.S. Coast Guard arrived by boat with a team on September 7 , with a preliminary damage assessment completed four days later ; the team repaired a generator to provide power . United States Navy USNS San Jose T @-@ AFS @-@ 7 and Sixteen members United States Airforce 36th Contingency Response Group arrived September 8 and analyzed the stability of the airfield along with assisting in clean @-@ up efforts , and after core tests workers cleared the runway to allow flights onto the territory . On September 13 , a group of engineers restored power on the island . About two weeks after the cyclone , several buildings were operational . 
 The Central Pacific Hurricane Center requested the retirement of the name , and in April 2007 , the name Ioke was retired , and replaced with <unk> .

 Bad Girls Club ( abbreviated BGC ) is an American reality television series created by Jonathan Murray for the Oxygen network in the United States . The show focuses on the altercations and physical confrontations of seven highly aggressive , quarrelsome , and unruly women . Each of the women tend to have psychological and behavioral problems . <unk> sexual and rascally moments are also captured among the women . All seven women have different backgrounds and personalities . They are introduced to the show based on their capacity to be a " charismatic , tough chick . " The cast , deemed " bad girls " , enjoy a luxurious lifestyle in a fine mansion for three months , during which they must obey specified rules . Their lives inside and outside of the house are chronicled and recorded by the production team . 
 Bad Girls Club airs in three nations besides the United States ; MTV Australia , RTL 5 in The Netherlands , and <unk> in Sweden . Bunim @-@ Murray has never licensed the show 's format to a broadcaster in another nation for a local version of the series . The format of the show has changed from earlier seasons . If a cast member violates production rules , she is evicted from the show and , if it is early in the season , replaced by a new cast member . The fourth season is considered the series ' " breakthrough season " , becoming Oxygen 's first series ever to average over one million viewers per episode . 
 There have been four spin @-@ offs including Bad Girls Road Trip , Tanisha Gets Married , Love Games : Bad Girls Need Love Too – where past cast members seek true love , and Bad Girls All @-@ Star Battle . Of all the contestants , Kerry Harvick ( of season one ) was a successful country singer before the show . Tanisha Thomas ( of season two ) later hosted Oxygen 's OxygenLive ! and the subsequent seasons of Love Games : Bad Girls Need Love Too . Thomas , who has been dubbed the " godmother " to all contestants , had her own series entitled Tanisha Gets Married . 
 Bad Girls Club : Social Disruption will premiere on September 20 , 2016 .

 Lasting until the final day without ever being kicked out or leaving for another reason is treated as an impressive feat on the series due to the level of violence and hostility . If the cast members engage in violence towards each other or break other rules , they may or may not be evicted under the show 's policy , which is enforced by the producers . Security guards apparently live in the house behind the scenes as they jump into camera shot to break up the many violent altercations that break out on the series . Beyond the common occurrence of violence and combat , other reasons for the premature exits of cast members have been from bullying , ostracism and alienation from the rest of the housemates , problems at home , court proceedings , or their own narcissism . On some occasions , multiple " bad girls " may wish to leave the show ; this has happened in all seasons . If a " bad girl " departs early in the season , a " replacement Bad Girl " is introduced within one or two episodes . The replacement housemate is commonly hazed , <unk> at , and treated with prejudice . 
 All or most of the girls typically form cliques between each other ; create havoc and antagonize each other ; book parties in night clubs ; and engage in sexual antics and other mischief , all awhile attempting to maintain their personal lives . Bullying and outnumbering abuse ( where multiple cast members intimidate one cast member or some other fewer number of cast members ) are among regular occurrences on the program . The girls , deemed " bad girls " , come from different backgrounds and all different walks of life . Earlier on in the series , they 'd often try to cope with one another and change their rebellious behavior to become role models for young women . Some cast members try to accomplish specific goals . 
 Throughout the show , the " Bad Girls " must adapt to the frequent mood and behavior changes of their housemates . The girls must undergo interviews in reality TV confessionals . They are allowed to contact their families and friends using landline telephones and a computer connected to a large @-@ screen television ; however , the cast is prohibited from watching nationally and locally televised programming and using mobile phones .

 = = = Seasons 1 and 2 = = = 
 The format for the first season of Bad Girls Club was different from that of subsequent seasons . The age range for season one was from 21 to 31 . The use of nicknames was not introduced until the third season . Season one was the first in which multiple " replacement Bad Girls " entered the show . 
 Although there were differences in season one , the current rules have applied in all subsequent seasons . One feature continued from season one was the way the show opened : viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation of the season , and the program then went back to a time before it happened . This fight usually gives you an idea of who is going to be the baddest , or one of the baddest , girls in the house . This altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering what will happen next . 
 In the second season , the format of the show changed drastically . The maximum age dropped from 31 to 28 . The cast of season two were given mandatory non @-@ profit jobs to help them build a work ethic and to experience the stabilizing effect of being interdependent with others , for example in teamwork and commitment , to equip them for success in later life . Quitting the job or failure to attend resulted in mandatory removal from the show . The girls were given the jobs of planning , decision making , and building cooperation . Season two was the first and only season of the Bad Girls Club to do this , and was also the last to air 30 @-@ minute episodes .

 In January 2011 , Oxygen released OxygenLive ! , an online talk show hosted by Tanisha Thomas , one of the " bad girls " of season two . It was broadcast after season six debuted on Oxygen , and focused on the cast of season six , occasionally bringing in " Bad Girls " from earlier seasons . Thomas asked the girls several questions to prompt rumors and confessions .

 Many homophobic slurs have caught the attention of media outlets . Mary Mitchell of Sun Times stated that the show was " hazardous to the female psyche " and wrote , " Just like some teens try to emulate rappers in their dress and behavior , the same is true for ' bad girls . ' " She also commented that the show gives a " distorted picture " of how to live the good life , calling the cast " wannabes " who are " sleeping in a mansion they can 't pay for " . Mitchell believes that most people know the cast are living " a bogus lifestyle " , and assesses the message of the Bad Girls Club as " disturbing " . 
 Many adolescents have emulated The Bad Girls Club . The show has also received negative criticism from African @-@ American viewers , believing that it is " not what being a black woman is all about . " Mary Chase Breedlove of Reflector objected that " there are several TV programs devoted to acting as trashy and mean as possible ( ' Bad Girls ' Club , ' ... ) " . The New York Daily News suggested that Bad Girls Club was the equivalent of professional wrestling . Kris De Leon of BuddyTV described the show as " crude , rude and pointless , but sort of addictive to some people . " 
 Brian Lowry of Variety thought that the producers made the " wrong decision " when they created the show . He believed that the cast of Bad Girls Club auditioned for the show for their " 15 minutes of fame " . He said that Bad Girls Club " arrived a little late in this game , on a channel lacking the kind of exposure or public footprint to qualify the show even as the stuff guilty pleasures are made of " . Lowry believed that the show " loses " and that Oxygen attracts viewers who generally get drunk at bars and make a scene . He also suggested that " maybe it 's time to " <unk> " these bad @-@ attitude girls and beat a hasty retreat back to the real world " . 
 Anita Gates of The New York Times referred to Bad Girls Club as " a great argument for bringing back programming with actors " . She believed that the " average emotional age " appeared to be 15 , in contrast to the girls ' real ages . She stated that the " unpleasant villains cancel one another out and actually make badness uninteresting " , commenting that their behavior might not be " bad enough " . Gates concluded by suggesting that Bad Girls Club is the on @-@ location equivalent of The Jerry Springer Show . Kelly West of Cinemablend stated that Bad Girls Club is " so much fun to watch " .

 The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time ( Japanese : ゼルダの伝説 時のオカリナ , Hepburn : Zeruda no Densetsu : Toki no Okarina ) is an action @-@ adventure video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 . It was released in Japan and North America in November 1998 , and in Europe and Australia in December 1998 . Originally developed for the 64DD peripheral , the game was instead released on a 256 @-@ megabit ( 32 @-@ megabyte ) cartridge , the largest @-@ capacity cartridge Nintendo produced at that time . Ocarina of Time is the fifth game in the The Legend of Zelda series , and the first with 3D graphics . It was followed by a direct sequel , The Legend of Zelda : Majora 's Mask , in 2000 . 
 In Ocarina of Time , the player controls Link in the land of Hyrule . Link sets out on a quest to stop Ganondorf , king of the Gerudo tribe , from obtaining the Triforce , a sacred relic that grants the wishes of its holder . He travels through time and navigates various dungeons to awaken the sages , who have the power to seal Ganondorf away forever . Music plays an important role : To progress , the player must learn to play several songs on an ocarina . The game was responsible for increased interest in and rise in sales of the instrument . 
 Ocarina of Time 's gameplay introduced features such as a target @-@ lock system and context @-@ sensitive buttons that have since become common in 3D adventure games . In Japan , more than 820 @,@ 000 copies were sold in 1998 , making it the tenth best @-@ selling game of that year . During its lifetime , 1 @.@ 14 million copies of Ocarina of Time were sold in Japan , and over 7 @.@ 6 million copies were sold worldwide . The game won the Grand Prize in the Interactive Art division at the Japan Media Arts Festival , and won six honors at the 2nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards . As of 2016 , it is the highest @-@ rated game on review @-@ aggregating site Metacritic , with a score of 99 / 100 ; in 2008 and 2010 , Guinness World Records listed Ocarina of Time as the highest @-@ rated game ever reviewed . It is considered by many critics and gamers to be one of the greatest video games of all time . 
 Ocarina of Time has had four major rereleases . It was originally ported to the GameCube alongside Ocarina of Time Master Quest , which featured reworked dungeons with new puzzles , and was included in The Legend of Zelda : Collector 's Edition . It was also ported to the iQue Player in 2003 , and was made available via the Virtual Console service for the Wii and Wii U in 2007 and 2015 respectively . The rereleases were well received ; although some critics considered the game outdated even during the initial rerelease , other reviewers believed it had aged well . A remake for the Nintendo 3DS , Ocarina of Time 3D , was released in 2011 with updated graphics and new autostereoscopic 3D effects ; it includes Master Quest 's rearranged dungeons , which are absent from the Wii , Wii U , and iQue versions . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time is an action @-@ adventure game with role @-@ playing and puzzle elements set in a large open @-@ world environment . The player controls series protagonist Link from a third @-@ person perspective , in a three @-@ dimensional world . Link primarily fights with a sword and shield , but he can also use other weapons such as projectiles , bombs , and magic spells . The control scheme introduced techniques such as context @-@ sensitive actions and a targeting system called " Z @-@ targeting " . In combat , Z @-@ targeting allows the player to have Link focus and latch onto an enemy or other objects . When using this technique , the camera follows the target and Link constantly faces it . Projectile attacks are automatically directed at the target and do not require manual aiming . Context @-@ sensitive actions allow multiple tasks to be assigned to one button , simplifying the control scheme . The on @-@ screen display shows what will happen when the button is pushed and changes depending on what the character is doing . For example , the same button that causes Link to push a box if he is standing next to it will have him climb on the box if the analog stick is pushed toward it . Much of the game is spent in battle , but some parts require the use of stealth . Exploration is another important aspect of gameplay ; the player may notice inaccessible areas and return later to find them explorable after obtaining a new item , such as the bomb , to blast through walls , or the <unk> , to reach distant places . In addition , the player can plant magic plants throughout the world , and later return to find the plant full @-@ grown and able transport Link to secret places with valuable items . When playing certain songs , Link is able to travel over vast distances in a short amount of time . 
 Link collects items and weapons throughout the game , whose abilities allow him to access , navigate and complete dungeons to advance the story . Each dungeon is a dense , self @-@ contained area in which Link solves puzzles and defeats enemies , and ends in a battle with the dungeon 's boss , a powerful unique enemy . Each dungeon and its boss share a major item and common theme ; for example Link must use the Fairy Bow to complete the Forest Temple and defeat its boss , Phantom Ganon , both of which involve trickery and misdirection . Defeat of a dungeon 's boss grants Link a special item and advances the main quest . 
 Ocarina of Time has several optional side @-@ quests , or minor objectives , that the player can choose to complete or ignore . Completing the side @-@ quests usually results in rewards , normally in the form of weapons or abilities . In one side @-@ quest , Link trades items he cannot use himself among non @-@ player characters . This trading sequence features ten items that must be delivered within their individual time limits , and ends with Link receiving an item he can use , the two @-@ handed <unk> Sword , the largest and strongest sword in the game . In another side @-@ quest , Link can acquire a horse named Epona . This allows him to travel faster and jump over fences , but attacking while riding is restricted to arrows . In order to get Epona , Link must learn her song while he is a child . However , he is only able to ride her seven years later when he and Epona are both adults . 
 Link can travel between two points in time . Part way through the main quest , Link claims the Master Sword in the Temple of Time ; when Link takes the sword , he is sealed for seven years , until he becomes an adult , and therefore strong enough to wield the Master Sword . Young Link and adult Link have different abilities , and are restricted to certain items and weapons . For example , only adult Link can use the Fairy Bow and only young Link can fit through certain small passages . After completing the Forest Temple , Link can travel freely between the two time periods by replacing or taking the sword . 
 Link is given the Fairy Ocarina near the beginning of the game , which is later replaced by the Ocarina of Time , given to him by Princess Zelda . Throughout the game , Link learns twelve melodies that allow him to solve various puzzles and teleport to previously visited locations in the game . The melodies and notes are played with the C and A buttons on the Nintendo 64 controller or the C analog stick on the GameCube controller . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The events of Ocarina of Time are set in the fictional kingdom of Hyrule , the setting of most The Legend of Zelda games . Hyrule Field serves as the central hub connected to several outlying areas with diverse topography . Most of these areas are populated by the races of Hyrule : <unk> , <unk> , Gorons , Zoras , Gerudo , and <unk> . 
 The fairy Navi awakens Link from a nightmare in which he witnesses a man in black armor pursuing a young girl on horseback . Navi brings Link to the Great Deku Tree , who is cursed and near death . The Deku Tree tells Link a " wicked man of the desert " cursed him and seeks to conquer the world , and that Link must stop him . Before dying , the Great Deku Tree gives Link the Spiritual Stone of the Forest and sends him to Hyrule Castle to speak with Hyrule 's princess . 
 At the Hyrule Castle garden , Link meets Princess Zelda , who believes Ganondorf , king of the Gerudo , is seeking the Triforce , a holy relic that gives its holder godlike power . Zelda asks Link to obtain the three Spiritual Stones so he can enter the Sacred Realm and claim the Triforce before Ganondorf reaches it . Link collects the other two stones : the first from Darunia , leader of the Gorons , and the second from Ruto , princess of the Zoras . Link returns to Hyrule Castle , where he sees Ganondorf chase Zelda and her caretaker Impa on horseback , and unsuccessfully attempts to stop him . Inside the Temple of Time , he uses the Ocarina of Time , a gift from Zelda , and the Spiritual Stones to open the door to the Sacred Realm . There he finds the Master Sword , but as he pulls it from its pedestal , Ganondorf appears and claims the Triforce . 
 Seven years later , an older Link awakens in an area of the Sacred Realm known as the Chamber of Sages and is met by Rauru , one of the seven sages who protect the entrance to the Sacred Realm . Rauru explains that Link 's spirit was sealed for seven years until he was old enough to wield the Master Sword and defeat Ganondorf , who has now taken over Hyrule . The seven sages can imprison Ganondorf in the Sacred Realm , but five are unaware of their identities as sages . Link is returned to the Temple of Time ; there he meets the mysterious Sheik , who guides him to free five temples from Ganondorf 's control , allowing each temple 's sage to awaken . Link befriended all five sages as a child : <unk> , the Sage of the Forest Temple ; Darunia , the Sage of the Fire Temple ; Ruto , the Sage of the Water Temple ; Impa , the Sage of the Shadow Temple ; and <unk> , the Sage of the Spirit Temple . After the five sages awaken , Sheik reveals herself to be Zelda in disguise , and the seventh sage . She tells Link that Ganondorf 's heart was unbalanced , causing the Triforce to split into three pieces . Ganondorf acquired only the Triforce of Power , while Zelda received the Triforce of Wisdom and Link the Triforce of Courage . 
 Ganondorf kidnaps Zelda and imprisons her in his castle . The other six sages help Link infiltrate the stronghold , where he frees Zelda after nearly defeating Ganondorf , who destroys the castle in an attempt to kill Link and Zelda . After they escape the collapsing castle , Ganondorf emerges from the rubble and , using the Triforce of Power , transforms into a boar @-@ like monster named Ganon and knocks the Master Sword from Link 's hand . With Zelda 's aid , Link retrieves the Master Sword and defeats Ganon . The seven sages seal Ganondorf in the Dark Realm ; still holding the Triforce of Power , he vows to take revenge on their descendants . Zelda uses the Ocarina of Time to send Link back to his childhood . Navi departs and young Link meets Zelda in the castle garden once more . 
 = = Development = = 
 First shown as a technical demo at Nintendo 's Shoshinkai trade show in December 1995 , Ocarina of Time was developed concurrently with Super Mario 64 by Nintendo 's Entertainment Analysis & Development ( EAD ) division . Both were the first free @-@ roaming 3D game in their respective series . Nintendo planned to release Super Mario 64 as a launch game for the Nintendo 64 ( N64 ) and later release Ocarina of Time for the 64DD , a disk drive peripheral for the system . Nintendo eventually migrated the development of Ocarina of Time from disk to cartridge media due to the high data performance requirements imposed by continuously reading 500 motion @-@ captured character animations throughout gameplay , intending to follow its release with a 64DD expansion disk . At its release the 32 @-@ megabyte game was the largest game Nintendo had ever created . Early in the game 's development , concerns over the memory constraints of the N64 cartridge led producer and supervisor Shigeru Miyamoto to imagine a worst @-@ case scenario in which Ocarina of Time would follow a similar structure to Super Mario 64 with Link being restricted to Ganondorf 's castle as a central hub , and using a portal system similar to the paintings that Mario uses to traverse the realm . An idea that arose from this stage of development , a battle with a doppelganger of Ganondorf that rides through paintings , ultimately made its way into the finished game as the boss of the Forest Temple dungeon . 
 While Shigeru Miyamoto had been the principal director of Super Mario 64 , he was now in charge of several directors as a producer and supervisor of Ocarina of Time . During its development , individual parts of Ocarina of Time were handled by multiple directors — a new strategy for Nintendo EAD . However , when things were progressing slower than expected , Miyamoto returned to the development team with a more hands @-@ on directorial role . Although the development team was new to 3D games , assistant director Makoto Miyanaga recalls a sense of " passion for creating something new and unprecedented " . A " medieval tale of sword and sorcery , " Miyamoto intended the game to be in the <unk> genre of Japanese sword fighting . The development crew involved more than 120 people , including stunt performers used to capture the effects of sword fighting and Link 's movement . Some of Miyamoto 's ideas for the new Zelda title were instead used in Super Mario 64 , since it was to be released first . Other ideas were not used due to time constraints . 
 Miyamoto initially intended Ocarina of Time to be played in a first @-@ person perspective to enable players to take in the vast terrain of Hyrule Field better , as well as to be able to focus more on developing enemies and environments . However , the development team did not go through with it once the idea of having a child Link was introduced , and Miyamoto believed it necessary for Link to be visible on screen . Ocarina of Time originally ran on the same engine as Super Mario 64 , but was so heavily modified that designer Shigeru Miyamoto considers the final products entirely different engines . One major difference between the two is camera control ; the player has a lot of control over the camera in Super Mario 64 , but the camera in Ocarina of Time is largely controlled by the game 's AI . Miyamoto says the camera controls for Ocarina of Time are intended to reflect a focus on the game 's world , whereas those of Super Mario 64 are centered on the character of Mario . Miyamoto wanted to make a game that was cinematic , but still distinguished from actual films . Takumi <unk> , who creates cutscenes for Nintendo , says that his top priority is to have the player feel in control of the action . To promote this feeling , cut scenes in Ocarina of Time are completely generated with real @-@ time computing and do not use pre @-@ recorded or full @-@ motion video . Toru Osawa created the scenario for the game , based on a story idea by Miyamoto and Yoshiaki Koizumi . He was given support by A Link to the Past and Link 's Awakening script writer Kensuke Tanabe . The dungeons were designed by Eiji Aonuma . 
 In 1997 and 1998 , the Nintendo 64 was said to be critically lacking in first party hit releases . Next Generation magazine stated that " Nintendo absolutely can 't afford another holiday season without a real marquee title " and that Zelda was " one of the most anticipated games of the decade " , upon which the Nintendo 64 's fate depends . Chairman Howard Lincoln insisted at E3 1998 that Zelda would be shipped on time and would instantly become the company 's reinvigorating blockbuster akin to a major Hollywood hit movie . 
 Customers in North America who pre @-@ ordered the game received a limited edition box with a golden plastic card affixed , reading " Collector 's Edition " . This edition contained a gold @-@ colored cartridge , a tradition for the Zelda series that began with the original game for the Nintendo Entertainment System . Demand was so great that Electronics Boutique stopped pre @-@ selling the title on November 3 , 1998 . Several versions of Ocarina of Time were produced , with later revisions featuring minor changes such as glitch repairs , the recoloring of Ganondorf 's blood from crimson to green , and the alteration of the music heard in the Fire Temple dungeon to remove a sample of an Islamic prayer chant . The sample was taken from a commercially available sound library , but the developers did not realise it contained Islamic references . Although popularly believed to have been changed due to public outcry , the chanting was in fact removed after the company discovered it violated their own policy to avoid religious material in games , and the altered versions of Ocarina of Time were made prior to the game 's original release . 
 = = = Ports and rereleases = = = 
 Ocarina of Time was rereleased for the GameCube as a port of the Nintendo 64 ROM image in conjunction with The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time Master Quest and as a part of The Legend of Zelda : Collector 's Edition . The former was released as Zeruda no Densetsu : Toki no Okarina GC in Japan , with the Master Quest side named Zeruda no Densetsu : Toki no Okarina GC Ura ( ゼルダの伝説 時のオカリナ <unk> ) . The " Ura " name stems from Master Quest 's origins , as an expansion to the Ocarina of Time cartridge in the form of a 64DD disk , under the working title Ura Zelda . The Master Quest compilation was given as a premium for pre @-@ ordering The Wind Waker in Japan and North America , as well as in a special GameCube bundle at Walmart wherein the disc came in the same case . In Europe and Australia , the disc came in the same case as the initial pressings of The Wind Waker . In Europe , it was available for a limited time through a special offer on the Nintendo website . The Ocarina of Time Master Quest box contains a single disc that includes the original game ; the Master Quest version ; six video demos for various GameCube games , including one for The Wind Waker ; and a video demo for the Game Boy Advance games A Link to the Past and Four Swords . Master Quest uses the same engine and plot of Ocarina of Time , but dungeons have been altered . Collector 's Edition was available in GameCube bundles in Europe , Australia , and North America , as well as by registering hardware and software , or by subscribing to official magazines or clubs . In addition to Ocarina of Time , the disc also contains the original The Legend of Zelda , The Adventure of Link , Majora 's Mask , a demo of The Wind Waker , and a Zelda retrospective featurette . The original game is displayed on the Nintendo 64 with a resolution of 320 × 240 , but the GameCube ports run at 640 × 480 and support progressive scan . 
 The game was released for the Wii 's Virtual Console service for 1000 Wii Points in Europe and Australia on February 23 , 2007 ; in North America on February 26 ; and in Japan on February 27 . This particular release is an emulation of the Nintendo 64 version , true to the original except for the elimination of support for controller vibrations . Thus , an item called the " Stone of Agony " , which employs physical vibrations via the Nintendo 64 's Rumble Pak controller accessory during certain in @-@ game events , has been made useless . The Wii can play the GameCube compilation versions with this feature intact . A five @-@ minute demo of the game is included as an unlockable item in Super Smash Bros. Brawl . The game was rereleased on the Wii U Virtual Console worldwide on July 2 , 2015 , this time including the Nintendo 64 's original Rumble Pak feature . 
 = = = = Ura Zelda = = = = 
 After the completion of Ocarina of Time , an expansion disk for the yet unreleased 64DD peripheral was developed with the working title Ura Zelda , commonly translated as " Another Zelda " . Described as " Ocarina 's second version with rearranged dungeon gameplay " , it contains some new content and some which had been cut from Ocarina due to constraints on development time and on cartridge storage size . 
 We will make [ Ura Zelda ] once the system has been switched over to the 64DD . Fundamentally , once the cartridge version of Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time has been out for awhile , I 'd like to bring the 64DD version out . It 's too early to release just yet , and I don 't want to have the 64DD and the cartridge sold at the same time . It 's troubling . After we release the cartridge version of F @-@ ZERO X , we 'll release the 64DD expansion disc . 
 However , Ura Zelda was delayed indefinitely since 1998 due to the uncertain and protracted development status of the requisite 64DD device , and then was never released in its originally planned form due to the 64DD 's ultimate commercial failure . 
 A fairly intact equivalent to Ura Zelda , as confirmed by designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Eiji Aonuma , was released for the GameCube in 2002 in Japan as Zeruda no Densetsu : Toki no Okarina GC Ura ( ゼルダの伝説 時のオカリナ <unk> ) and in 2003 in North America and Europe as The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time Master Quest . Miyamoto explained in 2002 , " [ Ura ] didn 't use many of the special [ 64DD ] features . So it was very easy to port over to the GameCube without cutting any features . Ura Zelda isn 't very different from the Ocarina of Time ; it 's more of a second quest ... it will not unlock anything special . " Aonuma concluded in 2004 , " It was finally bundled in the GameCube version of Ocarina and released as Master Quest . " 
 In 2003 , IGN 's Peer Schneider gave Master Quest positive reviews , with caveats . Based upon Ocarina which has " aged extremely well " , he likened the Ura concept to the second quest of the original Zelda game for NES . The game is " far more difficult than the original " , though the integrity of some areas suffer as if " ' second quest ' most likely meant ' second choice ' during the Nintendo design process " . He found the GameCube port to be somewhat visually improved though " lazy " , with a clumsy translation to the new controller and no substantial improvement in the original game 's low frame rate . Summarizing it as " a sweet , sweet surprise for any Zelda fan " , he recommended this complimentary compilation release even if it had been at full price . 
 = = = = Nintendo 3DS version = = = = 
 Shigeru Miyamoto originally maintained that a version of the game for the Nintendo 3DS was merely a technical demo with the possibility of being developed into a full game , but Nintendo of America announced the game in June 2010 . Ocarina of Time 3D was developed by Nintendo EAD in partnership with Grezzo , an independent Japanese studio headed by Koichi Ishii . The game was released in Japan on June 16 , 2011 ; Europe on June 17 , 2011 ; the United States on June 19 , 2011 ; and Australia on June 30 , 2011 ( June 24 , 2011 , at some stores ) . 
 New features include the ability to quickly equip items using the touchscreen and to use the handheld 's built in gyroscope to aim precisely in first @-@ person point of view while using items such as the slingshot . The fixed 3D is no longer present , and is made with a full 3D rendering of previously fixed 3D areas . In addition to the original game , the Master Quest is included , as well as a new " Boss Challenge " mode that allows players to fight all of the bosses one at a time , or in sequential order . However , this version of Master Quest differs in the fact that the entire map is mirrored , similar to what Nintendo did for the Wii port of The Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess . Instructional videos are built into the 3DS version to guide the players who are lost or stuck in certain puzzles . The original Water Temple was noted for its difficulty , being described as " arguably the greatest challenge of spatial awareness in a 3D adventure game " . The 3DS version contains new elements to reduce this difficulty . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Ocarina of Time 's music was written by Koji Kondo , the composer in charge of music for most of the games in the The Legend of Zelda series . In addition to characters having musical themes , areas of Hyrule are also associated with pieces of music . This has been called leitmotif in reverse — instead of music announcing an entering character , it now introduces a stationary environment as the player approaches . In some locations , the music is a variation of an ocarina tune the player learns , related to that area . 
 Beyond providing a backdrop for the setting , music plays an integral role in gameplay . The button layout of the Nintendo 64 controller resembles the holes of the <unk> in the game , and players must learn to play several songs to complete the game . All songs are played using the five notes available on an ocarina , although by bending pitches via the analog stick , players can play additional tones . Kondo said that creating distinct themes on the limited scale was a " major challenge " , but feels that the end result is very natural . The popularity of Ocarina of Time led to an increase in ocarina sales . 
 The official soundtrack of Ocarina of Time was published by Pony Canyon and released in Japan on December 18 , 1998 . It comprises one compact disc with 82 tracks . A US version was also released , although with fewer tracks and different packaging artwork . Many critics praised the music in Ocarina of Time , although IGN was disappointed that the traditional Zelda overworld theme was not included . In 2001 , three years after the initial release of Ocarina of Time , GameSpot labeled it as one of the top ten video game soundtracks . The soundtrack , at the time , was not released in Europe or Australia . In 2011 , however , a 51 @-@ track limited edition soundtrack for the 3DS version was available in a free mail out through a Club Nintendo offer to owners of the 3DS edition , as an incentive to register the product . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 Ocarina of Time was released to widespread critical acclaim and strong commercial success worldwide . In the United States , over 500 @,@ 000 preorders were placed , more than tripling the number of preorders for any previous video game , and more than 1 million copies were sold there in less than a week . In 1998 , 2 @.@ 5 million copies were sold , although it was released only 39 days before the end of the year ; it earned $ 150 million in US revenues , higher than any Hollywood film in the last six weeks of 1998 . In Japan , 820 @,@ 000 copies were sold in 1998 , becoming the tenth best @-@ selling game of that year ; a reported 386 @,@ 234 copies were sold in its first week there , surpassing the 316 @,@ 000 first @-@ week sales of Metal Gear Solid . In the United Kingdom , 61 @,@ 232 copies were sold during its first weekend . During its lifetime , Ocarina of Time saw 1 @.@ 14 million copies sold in Japan , and 7 @.@ 6 million copies worldwide . 
 On its initial Nintendo 64 release , Ocarina of Time received perfect review scores from the majority of gaming publications that reviewed it , including Famitsu , Edge , Electronic Gaming Monthly , GameSpot , and IGN . As of January 2013 , the review aggregator websites Metacritic and GameRankings respectively rank the original Nintendo 64 version as the highest and second highest reviewed game of all time , with average scores of 99 / 100 from Metacritic and 97 @.@ 54 % from GameRankings ; it held the highest score on GameRankings for 10 years , when it was succeeded by Super Mario Galaxy . The reviews praised multiple aspects of the game , particularly its level design , gameplay mechanics and sound . GameSpot reviewer Jeff Gerstmann wrote that Ocarina of Time is " a game that can 't be called anything other than flawless " , and IGN called it " the new benchmark for interactive entertainment " that could " shape the action RPG genre for years to come " . GameTrailers ' editors called it a " walking patent office " due to the number of features that became " industry standard " . Rockstar Games vice president of creativity Dan Houser stated in 2012 , " Anyone who makes 3 @-@ D games who says they 've not borrowed something from Mario or Zelda [ on the Nintendo 64 ] is lying . " 
 After publication , Ocarina of Time was featured on a number of compiled lists of best or most influential games , including those of Electronic Gaming Monthly , IGN , and Nintendo Power . Ocarina of Time has consistently been placed at number one in Edge magazine 's " top 100 games " lists : a staff @-@ voted list in January 2000 , a <unk> and reader @-@ voted list in July 2007 , a list of " The 100 Best Games to Play Today " in March 2009 , and a 2013 readers ' poll selecting the 20 best games released since the magazine 's launch in 1993 . Game Informer ranked it as its 11th favorite game of all time and described it as " untouchable " . In May 2011 , IGN held a tournament @-@ style competition celebrating the 25th anniversary of the original The Legend of Zelda 's release in which fans voted Ocarina of Time the greatest Zelda game ; it beat Majora 's Mask in the final round . 
 The graphics were praised for their depth and detail , although reviewers noted they were not always the best the console had to offer . Game Revolution noted the characters ' faces , the " toughest graphical challenge on 3D characters " , saying that the characters ' expressions and animation featured " surprising grace " . IGN believed that Ocarina of Time improved on the graphics of Super Mario 64 , giving a larger sense of scale . Impressive draw distances and large boss characters were also mentioned as graphical highlights . Although excelling in the use of color and the visibility and detail of the environment , reviewers noted that some graphical elements of Ocarina of Time did not perform as well as Banjo @-@ Kazooie , a game released for the same platform earlier that year . IGN said that the frame rate and textures of Ocarina of Time were not as good as those of Banjo @-@ Kazooie , particularly in the marketplace of Hyrule Castle , which was called " blurry " . 
 Gameplay was generally praised as detailed , with many side quests to occupy players ' time . IGN said players would be " amazed at the detail " of the environment and the " amount of thought that went into designing it " . EGM enjoyed that Nintendo was able to take the elements of the older , 2D Zelda games and " translate it all into 3D flawlessly " . Nintendo Power cited Ocarina of Time , along with Super Mario 64 , as two games that " blazed trails " into the 3D era . The context @-@ sensitive control system was seen as one of the strongest elements of the gameplay . Reviewers noted that it allowed for simpler control using fewer buttons , but that it occasionally caused the player to perform unintended actions . The camera control was quoted as making combat " second nature " , although the new system took time for the player to get used to . 
 The game 's audio was generally well received , with IGN comparing some of Koji Kondo 's pieces to the work of Philip Glass . Many atmospheric sounds and surround sound were designed to effectively immerse the player in the game world . Some reviewers complained that the audio samples used in the game sounded dated ; others considered this a benefit , calling them " retro " . Game Revolution called the sound " good for the Nintendo , but not great in the larger scheme of things " and noted that the cartridge format necessitated " MIDI tunes that range from fair to terrible " . 
 In 1998 , Ocarina of Time won the Grand Prize in the Interactive Art division at the Japan Media Arts Festival . It also won six honors at the 2nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards , including " Game of the Year " , " Outstanding Achievement in Interactive Design " , " Outstanding Achievement in Software Engineering " , " Console Game of the Year " , " Console Adventure Game of the Year " and " Console RPG of the Year " . Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it both the editors ' choice and readers ' choice awards for " Game of the Year for All Systems " , " Nintendo 64 Game of the Year " and " Action RPG of the Year " as well as the readers ' choice awards for " Best Music " and " Best Graphics " , and it was runner @-@ up for the reader 's choice " Best Sound Effects " award . Edge gave it the awards for " Game of the Year " and " Gameplay Innovation " and placed it 2nd place for " Graphical Achievement " ( behind Virtua Fighter <unk> ) . The game was placed second in Official Nintendo Magazine 's " 100 greatest Nintendo games of all time " , behind only Super Mario Bros. 
 Reception for the Master Quest and Virtual Console rereleases was positive ; while some considered aspects of the graphics and audio to be outdated , most thought that the game has aged well . The Master Quest version holds an average score of 89 @.@ 50 % on GameRankings and 91 / 100 on Metacritic . IGN said in their review , " Ocarina of Time has aged extremely well " , and noted in regard to the game 's graphics , " While the textures and models look dated , the game 's wonderful visual presentation stood the test of time . " Game Revolution said that although the game has " noticeably aged compared to brand new RPGs [ ... ] it 's still a terrific game " , awarding 91 out of 100 . Former GameSpot editor Jeff Gerstmann gave the Virtual Console port 8 @.@ 9 out of 10 , writing , " Even after nine years , Ocarina of Time holds up surprisingly well , offering a lengthy and often @-@ amazing adventure " . Edge magazine commented in its 2007 " The 100 Best Games " special issue , " [ Ocarina of Time ] was an astonishing achievement in 1998 and , almost a decade later , still serves as the landmark for its successors and 3D adventure games in general ... In a series composed of awfully big adventures , Ocarina may no longer be the prettiest , or even the biggest , but it 's still the best of all . " 
 = U.S. Route 220 in Maryland = 
 U.S. Route 220 ( US 220 ) is a part of the U.S. Highway System that runs from Rockingham , North Carolina to Waverly , New York . In Maryland , the federal highway runs 27 @.@ 30 miles ( 43 @.@ 94 km ) from the West Virginia state line at the Potomac River in McCoole north to the Pennsylvania state line in Dickens . Known as McMullen Highway for much of its length in Maryland , US 220 is the primary north – south route in central Allegany County , connecting Cumberland with its southern suburbs and Keyser , West Virginia to the south and Bedford , Pennsylvania to the north . The federal highway is part of the National Highway System between the West Virginia state line and Maryland Route 53 ( MD 53 ) in Cresaptown and between Interstate 68 ( I @-@ 68 ) , with which it is concurrent through Cumberland , and the Pennsylvania state line . 
 The road to Bedford was paved within the city of Cumberland by 1910 and constructed north to Pennsylvania in the 1910s . This highway comprised the southernmost portion of US 220 when the U.S. Highway System was established in 1927 . McMullen Highway was constructed starting from Cumberland and finishing in McCoole in the 1920s . When that highway was completed around 1930 , US 220 was extended south into West Virginia . Both the northern and southern portions of the federal highway were reconstructed in the 1940s and 1950s , including a new bridge over the Potomac River . US 220 was rerouted within Cumberland multiple times before being placed on I @-@ 68 in the early 1980s to bypass downtown Cumberland . The bypass of Bedford Road between I @-@ 68 and the Pennsylvania state line opened in 2000 . A new bridge over the Potomac River is currently under construction . In addition , relocation of the highway from I @-@ 68 south into West Virginia is under consideration . 
 = = Route description = = 
 US 220 enters Maryland in southwestern Allegany County , crossing the Potomac River and its own old alignment on a bridge from Keyser to McCoole . The highway meets the eastern terminus of MD 135 ( Paxton Street ) before gaining a climbing lane and ascending a hill . US 220 crosses over its old alignment again , then meets the old alignment , unsigned MD 135A , at the top of the hill . The federal highway turns northeast as McMullen Highway , a two @-@ lane road paralleling the Potomac River north to Cumberland . The highway passes through the hamlet of Dawson , where it passes a curve of its old alignment designated MD <unk> and closely parallels CSX 's Mountain Subdivision . US 220 splits away from the railroad tracks to follow the valley of Deep Hollow Creek between Fort Hill immediately to the east and Dans Mountain further to the west . After passing through the hamlet of Danville , the federal highway passes into the valley of Mill Run . After passing another curve of old alignment designated MD <unk> , US 220 leaves Fort Hill and Mill Run behind . 
 US 220 passes through the villages of Rawlings and Bier before intersecting the western end of MD 956 ( Patriot Parkway ) near Pinto . Beyond MD 956 , US 220 enters a more densely populated area , passing through the community of Bel Air . The federal highway enters Cresaptown , where US 220 intersects MD 53 ( Winchester Road ) , which is also the southern terminus of US 220 Truck . Access to northbound MD 53 is provided by unsigned MD 636 ( Warrior Drive ) shortly after . 
 After crossing Warrior Run , Haystack Mountain flanks US 220 to the west as the federal highway passes through <unk> , the former site of the Celanese chemical plant that is now the location of the North Branch Correctional Institution . The federal highway curves through Potomac Park , home of the Allegany County Fairgrounds . After passing the Upper Potomac Industrial Park , US 220 parallels CSX 's Mountain Subdivision again before entering the city of Cumberland , where the highway is municipally @-@ maintained . Shortly after , US 220 meets I @-@ 68 and US 40 ( National Freeway ) at Exit 42 . Trucks and buses are prohibited from using the ramp in the diamond interchange from eastbound I @-@ 68 to southbound US 220 ; those vehicles must follow US 220 Truck instead . Greene Street , the old alignment of US 220 , continues north from the interchange as a municipal street toward downtown Cumberland . 
 US 220 becomes concurrent with eastbound I @-@ 68 and US 40 , passing through downtown Cumberland on a narrow , curvaceous viaduct where the highway meets the northern end of MD 51 and the east end of US 40 ALT . After passing through the eastern part of the city , US 220 exits the freeway at Exit 46 onto MD 144 ( Ali Ghan Road ) , which it follows east a short distance before turning north over I @-@ 68 onto a two @-@ lane limited access highway with a speed limit of 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) . MD 144 , the old alignment of US 40 , continues east toward Rocky Gap State Park . The southbound direction of US 220 joins westbound I @-@ 68 via a long ramp on a sweeping curve . After crossing Evitts Creek , Mason Road , and <unk> Mill Road , the federal highway reaches the intersection with MD 807 ( Bedford Road ) and MD <unk> ( <unk> Mill Road ) in Dickens , the former being the old alignment of US 220 . US 220 turns northeast , passing MD <unk> ( Pine Ridge Road ) and MD <unk> before crossing the Pennsylvania state line , where the route continues north as Bedford Valley Road toward Bedford . 
 = = History = = 
 Bedford Street was paved in the city of Cumberland from downtown to Naves Cross Road by 1910 . Bedford Road was paved between Naves Cross Road and roughly the present intersection of US 220 and Bedford Road by 1915 , with the final segment to the Pennsylvania state line completed shortly thereafter . When the U.S. Highway System was organized in 1926 , Bedford Road and Bedford Street were designated the southernmost portion of US 220 . The first section of McMullen Highway — named for Hugh A. McMullen , an Allegany County miner , merchant , and banker who was Comptroller of Maryland from 1916 to 1920 — was completed between Cumberland and Cresaptown in 1920 . The highway was extended to Rawlings by 1927 and to Dawson in 1928 . McMullen Highway was completed to McCoole by 1930 . The US 220 designation was extended south of Cumberland into West Virginia at the same time . Within Cumberland , US 220 followed Greene Street north and east to Wills Creek . The federal highway crossed Wills Creek via Baltimore Street , which the highway followed east to Henderson Avenue . US 220 was concurrent with US 40 on Henderson Avenue before turning northeast onto Bedford Street . In McCoole , US 220 followed a twisty route down to the Potomac River . The federal highway followed what is today MD 135A to MD 135 , then turned east on the present MD 135 and past the present bridge to Parkland Drive , where the highway crossed the river on a bridge in line with Main Street in Keyser . 
 The first round of improvements to US 220 began around 1936 when the highway was widened from McMullen to <unk> . The widened highway was extended south through Cresaptown by 1938 and to McCoole by 1942 , making all of McMullen Highway at least 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) wide . A second round of widening occurred during World War II as a military access project ; the highway was expanded to at least 24 feet ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) in width from Cumberland to Pinto to improve access to the many wartime manufacturing centers along the highway , including the Allegany Ordnance Plant in West Virginia across the Potomac River from Pinto . 
 Improvements to US 220 continued after the war . Bedford Road was rebuilt between 1946 and 1950 . McMullen Highway from Cumberland to Cresaptown was widened a third time in a project completed in 1950 . The present bridge between McCoole and Keyser was completed in 1951 , with the approach road on the Maryland side completed in 1952 . Reconstruction of US 220 between Cresaptown and Rawlings occurred between 1952 and 1954 . The final segment of McMullen Highway to be rebuilt , from Rawlings to McCoole , was completed in 1956 . 
 The first rerouting of US 220 within Cumberland occurred in 1956 , when Frederick Street was reconstructed and became the northbound direction of a one @-@ way pair in conjunction with Bedford Street . By 1964 , the federal highway followed Mechanic Street north to the Frederick / Bedford pair instead of Henderson Avenue . In 1977 , a viaduct was completed to carry US 220 over the railroad tracks and US 40 ALT . US 220 was moved off of surface streets in downtown Cumberland when the highway was placed on the Cumberland Thruway ( now I @-@ 68 ) between McMullen Highway and Naves Cross Road in 1982 . The highway used Naves Cross Road to reconnect with Bedford Road , which was designated MD 807 between Naves Cross Road and the Cumberland city line . In 2000 , the two @-@ lane , limited @-@ access bypass of Bedford Road was completed northeast of Cumberland ; MD 807 was extended north along the bypassed part of Bedford Road . The portion of US 220 between the southern city limit of Cumberland and I @-@ 68 was transferred from municipal maintenance to state maintenance in 2010 .

 The 1951 bridge over the Potomac River between McCoole and Keyser is presently being replaced . Construction on the new bridge , which will be located immediately to the east of the present bridge , began in 2010 and is expected to conclude in 2013 . A study is underway concerning upgrading or relocating US 220 between I @-@ 68 and the Potomac River . The proposed routing would involve MD 53 between I @-@ 68 and Cresaptown , and is part of a larger study of a highway to connect Cumberland with Corridor H near Scherr , West Virginia .

 = American paddlefish = 
 The American paddlefish ( Polyodon spathula ) is a species of basal ray @-@ finned fish closely related to sturgeons in the order Acipenseriformes . Fossil records of paddlefish date back over 300 million years , nearly 50 million years before dinosaurs first appeared . American paddlefish are smooth @-@ skinned freshwater fish commonly called paddlefish , but are also referred to as Mississippi paddlefish , spoon @-@ billed cats , or spoonbills . They are one of only two extant species in the paddlefish family , Polyodontidae . The other is the critically endangered Chinese paddlefish ( <unk> gladius ) endemic to the Yangtze River basin in China . American paddlefish are often referred to as primitive fish , or relict species because they retain some morphological characteristics of their early ancestors , including a skeleton that is almost entirely cartilaginous , a paddle @-@ shaped rostrum ( snout ) that extends nearly one @-@ third their body length , and a heterocercal tail or caudal fin , much like that of sharks . American paddlefish are a highly derived fish because they have evolved with adaptations such as filter feeding . Their rostrum and cranium are covered with tens of thousands of sensory receptors for locating swarms of zooplankton , which is their primary food source . 
 American paddlefish are native to the Mississippi River basin and once moved freely under the relatively natural , unaltered conditions that existed prior to the early 1900s . They commonly inhabited large , free @-@ flowing rivers , braided channels , backwaters , and oxbow lakes throughout the Mississippi River drainage basin , and adjacent Gulf drainages . Their peripheral range extended into the Great Lakes , with occurrences in Lake Huron and Lake Helen in Canada until about 90 years ago . American paddlefish populations have declined dramatically primarily because of overfishing , habitat destruction , and pollution . Poaching has also been a contributing factor to their decline and will continue to be as long as the demand for caviar remains strong . Naturally occurring American paddlefish populations have been extirpated from most of their peripheral range , as well as from New York , Maryland , Virginia , and Pennsylvania . The current range of American paddlefish has been reduced to the Mississippi and Missouri River tributaries and Mobile Bay drainage basin . They are currently found in twenty @-@ two states in the U.S. , and those populations are protected under state , federal and international laws .

 American paddlefish are closely related to sturgeons in the order Acipenseriformes , an order of basal ray @-@ finned fishes that includes sturgeon and paddlefish , several species of which are now extinct . <unk> are among the oldest of fishes as evidenced in the fossil record which dates their first appearance approximately 300 to 400 million years ago , almost 50 million years before the dinosaurs . Fossils of a second extinct species , P. tuberculata , which date back approximately 60 million years ago , were found in the Lower Paleocene <unk> Formation in Montana . 
 In 1797 , French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède established the genus Polyodon for paddlefish , which today includes a single extant species , Polyodon spathula . Lacépède disagreed with Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre 's description in Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique ( 1788 ) , which suggested paddlefish were a species of shark . Lacépède noted , " The country and habits of this fish are still unknown . " When Lacépède established the binomial , <unk> feuille , he was unaware the species had already been named in 1772 by taxonomist , Johann Julius Walbaum , who described paddlefish as Squalus spathula . As a result of Lacépède 's inadvertent double naming , Polyodon spathula became the preferred scientific name of American paddlefish , and Squalus spathula became the synonym as one of two names applied to the group . <unk> , 1792 , is recognized and cited as the authority . 
 The family Polyodontidae comprises five known taxa ; three extinct taxa from western North America , and two extant taxa including the American paddlefish ( Polyodon spathula ) native to the Mississippi River Basin in the United States , and the critically endangered Chinese paddlefish ( <unk> glades ) endemic to the Yangtze River Basin in China . American paddlefish are the only living species in the genus Polyodon . They are often referred to as primitive fish , or relict species , because of morphological characteristics they retain from some of their early ancestors as evidenced in the fossil record which dates them back to the Late Cretaceous , 70 to 75 million years ago . Some of their primitive characteristics include a skeleton composed primarily of cartilage , and a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks , although they are not closely related . 
 Fossil <unk> with recognizable rostrums date from the Upper Cretaceous and Paleocene periods 65 million years ago . An elongated rostrum is a morphological characteristic of Polyodontidae , but only the genus Polyodon ( P. spathula and the extinct P. tuberculata ) have characteristics adapted specifically for filter feeding , including the jaw , gill arches , and cranium . The gill rakers of American paddlefish are composed of extensive comb @-@ like filaments believed to have inspired the etymology of the genus name , Polyodon , a Greek compound word meaning " many toothed " . Adult American paddlefish are actually toothless , although numerous small teeth less than 1 mm ( 0 @.@ 039 in ) were found in a juvenile paddlefish measuring 630 mm ( 25 in ) . <unk> references the elongated , paddle shaped snout or rostrum . Compared to Chinese paddlefish and fossil genera , American paddlefish ( and by extension , a fossil relative , P. tuberculata ) are considered to be a highly derived species because of their novel adaptations . 
 Chinese paddlefish are the closest extant relative of American paddlefish . They are currently listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List . Several reports have suggested that Chinese paddlefish may now be extinct . The primary reasons for their decline are similar to those of American paddlefish and include overfishing , the construction of dams , and destruction of habitat . Unlike the <unk> American paddlefish , Chinese paddlefish are strong swimmers , grow larger , and are opportunistic piscivores that feed on small fishes and crustaceans . Some distinct morphological differences of Chinese paddlefish include a narrower , sword @-@ like rostrum , and a protrusible mouth . They also have fewer , thicker gill rakers than American paddlefish . The last confirmed sighting of a live Chinese paddlefish was made on the <unk> River on January 24 , 2003 . From 2006 to 2008 , scientists conducted surveys in an effort to locate the fish . They used several boats , deployed <unk> setlines , 111 anchored setlines and 950 drift nets covering 488 @.@ 5 km ( 303 @.@ 5 mi ) on the upper Yangtze River , most of which lies within the protected area of the Upper Yangtze National Nature Reserve . They did not catch a single fish . They also used <unk> equipment to monitor active sound in water ( sonar ) , but were unable to confirm the presence of paddlefish . 
 = = Description = = 
 American paddlefish are among the largest and longest lived freshwater fishes in North America . They have a shark @-@ like body , average 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) in length , weigh 27 kilograms ( 60 lb ) , and can live in excess of thirty years . For most populations the median age is five to eight years and the maximum age is fourteen to eighteen years . The age of American paddlefish is best determined by dentary studies , a process which usually occurs on fish harvested during snagging season , a popular sport fishing activity in certain parts of the U.S. The dentary is removed from the lower jawbone , cleaned of any remaining soft tissue , and cross @-@ sectioned to expose the annual rings . The dentary rings are counted in much the same way a tree is aged . <unk> studies suggest that some individuals can live 60 years or longer , and that females typically live longer and grow larger than males . 
 American paddlefish are smooth @-@ skinned and almost entirely cartilaginous . Their eyes are small and directed laterally . They have a large , tapering operculum flap , a large mouth , and a flat , paddle @-@ shaped rostrum that measures approximately one @-@ third of their body length . During the initial stages of development from embryo to hatchling , American paddlefish have no rostrum . It begins to form shortly after hatching . The rostrum is an extension of the cranium , not of the upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as with the long snouts of other fishes . Other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration , often with mottling , ranging from bluish @-@ gray to black dorsally grading to a whitish underbelly . 
 = = Feeding ecology and physiology = = 
 Scientists began to debate the function of the American paddlefish 's rostrum when the species was described in the late 1700s . They had once believed it was used to excavate bottom substrate or functioned as a balancing mechanism and navigational aid . However , laboratory experiments in 1993 that utilized advanced technology in the field of electron microscopy have established conclusively that the rostrum of American paddlefish is covered with tens of thousands of sensory receptors . These receptors are morphologically similar to the ampullae of Lorenzini of sharks and rays , and are indeed passive <unk> @-@ type electroreceptors used by American paddlefish to detect plankton . Clusters of electroreceptors also cover the head and operculum flaps . The American paddlefish 's diet consists primarily of zooplankton . Their electroreceptors can detect weak electrical fields , which signal not only the presence of zooplankton , but also the individual feeding and swimming movements of zooplankton appendages . When a swarm of zooplankton is detected , the paddlefish swims forward continuously with their mouth wide open , forcing water over the gill rakers to filter out prey . Such feeding behavior is considered ram suspension @-@ feeding . Further research has indicated that their electroreceptors may also serve as a navigational aid for obstacle avoidance . 
 American paddlefish have small undeveloped eyes that are directed laterally . Unlike most fishes , American paddlefish hardly respond to overhead shadows or changes in illumination . Electroreception appears to have largely replaced vision as a primary sensory modality , which indicates a reliance on electroreceptors for detecting prey . However , the rostrum is not their only means of food detection . Some reports suggest a damaged rostrum would render American paddlefish less capable of foraging efficiently to maintain good health , but laboratory experiments and field research indicate otherwise . As well as electroreceptors on the rostrum , American paddlefish have sensory pores covering nearly half of the skin surface extending from the rostrum to the top of the head down to the tips of the operculum flaps . Studies have indicated that American paddlefish with damaged or abbreviated rostrums are still able to forage and maintain good health . 
 = = Reproduction and life cycle = = 
 American paddlefish are long @-@ lived , sexually late maturing pelagic fish . Females do not begin spawning until they are seven to ten years old , some as late as sixteen to eighteen years old . Females do not spawn every year , rather they spawn every second or third year . Males spawn more frequently , usually every year or every other year beginning around age seven , some as late as nine or ten years of age . 
 American paddlefish begin their upstream spawning migration sometime during early spring ; some begin in late fall . They spawn on silt @-@ free gravel bars that would otherwise be exposed to air or covered by very shallow water were it not for the rises in the river from snow melt and annual spring rains that cause flooding . Although availability of preferred spawning habitat is essential , there are three precise environmental events that must occur before American paddlefish will spawn . The water temperature must be from 55 to 60 ° F ( 13 to 16 ° C ) ; the lengthened photoperiod which occurs in spring triggers biological and behavioral processes that are dependent on increasing day length ; and there must be a proper rise and flow in the river before a successful spawn can occur . Historically , American paddlefish did not spawn every year because the precise environmental events only occurred once every 4 or 5 years . 
 American paddlefish are broadcast spawners , also referred to as mass spawners or synchronous spawners . <unk> females release their eggs into the water over bare rocks or gravel at the same time males release their sperm . Fertilization occurs externally . The eggs become sticky after they are released into the water and will attach to the bottom substrate . Incubation varies depending on water temperature , but in 60 ° F ( 16 ° C ) water the eggs will hatch into larval fish in about seven days . After hatching , the larval fish drift downstream into areas of low flow velocity where they forage on zooplankton . 
 Young American paddlefish are poor swimmers which makes them susceptible to predation . Therefore , rapid first @-@ year growth is important to their survival . Fry can grow about 1 in ( 2 @.@ 5 cm ) per week , and by late July the fingerlings are around 5 – 6 in ( 13 – 15 cm ) long . Their rate of growth is variable and highly dependent on food abundance . Higher growth rates occur in areas where food is not limited . The feeding behavior of fingerlings is quite different from that of older juveniles and adults . They capture individual plankton one by one , which requires detection and location of individual Daphnia on approach , followed by an intercept maneuver to capture the selected prey . By late September fingerlings have developed into juveniles , and are around 10 – 12 in ( 25 – 30 cm ) long . After the 1st year their growth rate slows and is highly variable . Studies indicate that by age 5 their growth rate averages around 2 in ( 5 @.@ 1 cm ) per year depending on the abundance of food and other environmental influences . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 American paddlefish are highly mobile and well adapted to living in rivers . They inhabit many types of riverine habitats throughout much of the Mississippi Valley and adjacent Gulf slope drainages . They occur most frequently in deeper , low current areas such as side channels , <unk> , backwater lakes , bayous , and <unk> below dams . They have been observed to move more than 2 @,@ 000 mi ( 3 @,@ 200 km ) in a river system . 
 American paddlefish are endemic to the Mississippi River Basin , historically occurring from the Missouri and Yellowstone rivers in the northwest to the Ohio and Allegheny rivers of the northeast ; the headwaters of the Mississippi River south to its mouth , from the San Jacinto River in the southwest to the Tombigbee and Alabama rivers of the southeast . They were extirpated from New York , Maryland and Pennsylvania , as well as from much of their peripheral range in the Great Lakes region , including Lake Huron and Lake Helen in Canada . In 1991 , Pennsylvania implemented a reintroduction program utilizing hatchery @-@ reared American paddlefish in an effort to establish self @-@ sustaining populations in the upper Ohio and lower Allegheny rivers . In 1998 , New York initiated a stocking program upstream in the Allegheny Reservoir above Kinzua Dam , and a second stocking in 2006 in Conewango Creek , a relatively unaltered section of their historic range . Reports of free ranging adults captured by gill nets have since been documented in Pennsylvania and New York , but there is no evidence of natural reproduction . They are currently found in 22 states in the US , and are protected under state and federal laws . There are 13 states that allow commercial or sport fishing for American paddlefish . 
 = = Human interaction = = 
 = = = Propagation and culture = = = 
 The artificial propagation of American paddlefish began with the efforts of the Missouri Department of Conservation during the early 1960s , and focused primarily on maintenance of the sport fishery . However , it was the growing importance of American paddlefish for their meat and roe that became the catalyst for further development of culture techniques for aquaculture in the United States . Artificial propagation requires broodstock which , because of the late sexual maturation of American paddlefish , are initially obtained from the wild and brought into a hatchery environment . The fish are injected with LH @-@ RH hormone to stimulate spawning . The number of eggs a female may produce depends on the size of the fish and can range anywhere from 70 @,@ 000 – 300 @,@ 000 eggs . Unlike most teleosts , the oviduct branches of American paddlefish and sturgeons are not directly attached to the ovaries ; rather , they open dorsally into the body cavity . To determine the status of progression toward maturation , ova staging is performed . The process begins with a minor procedure that involves a small abdominal incision from which to extract a few sample oocytes . The oocytes are boiled in water for a few minutes until the yolk is hardened , and then they are cut in half to expose the nucleus . The exposed nucleus is examined under a microscope to determine stage of maturity . 
 Once maturation is confirmed , one of three procedures is used to extract the eggs from a female paddlefish . The three procedures are ( 1 ) the traditional hand @-@ stripping method , considered to be time consuming and laborious ; ( 2 ) Caesarean section , a relatively quick surgical method of extracting eggs through a 4 in ( 10 cm ) abdominal incision ; considered faster than hand stripping , suturing can be time consuming and the incision may result in muscular stress and poor suture retention which lowers survival rate ; and ( 3 ) MIST , ( minimally invasive surgical technique ) which is the fastest of the three procedures because it requires less handling of the fish and eliminates the need for suturing . A small internal incision is made in the dorsal area of the oviduct , which allows direct stripping of eggs from the body cavity through the gonopore bypassing the <unk> funnels . 
 A <unk> male indicates successful production of mature spermatozoa which results in the release of large volumes of milt over the course of three to four days . Milt is collected by inserting a short plastic tube with syringe attached into the urogenital opening of the male and applying light suction with the syringe to draw the milt . The collected milt is diluted in water just prior to adding it to the eggs and the combination is gently stirred for about a minute to achieve fertilization . <unk> eggs are adhesive and demersal , therefore if incubation is to take place in a flow @-@ through hatching jar , the eggs must be treated to prevent clumping . Incubation usually takes anywhere from five to twelve days . 
 = = = Global commercial market = = = 
 Advancements in biotechnology have created a global commercial market for the <unk> of American paddlefish . In 1970 , American paddlefish were stocked in several rivers in Europe and Asia . Introduction began when five thousand hatched larvae from Missouri hatcheries in the United States were exported to the former USSR for <unk> utilization . Reproduction was successful in 1988 and 1989 , and resulted in the exportation of juveniles to Romania and Hungary . American paddlefish are now being raised in Ukraine , Germany , Austria , the Czech Republic , and the Plovdiv and Vidin regions in Bulgaria . In May 2006 , specimens of different sizes and weights were caught by professional fisherman near <unk> in the Serbian part of the Danube River . 
 In 1988 , fertilized American paddlefish eggs and larvae from Missouri hatcheries were first introduced into China . Since that time , China imports approximately 4 @.@ 5 million fertilized eggs and larvae every year from hatcheries in Russia and the United States . Some American paddlefish are <unk> in carp ponds and sold to restaurants while others are cultured for brood stock and caviar production . China has also exported American paddlefish to Cuba , where they are farmed for caviar production . 
 = = = Sport fishing = = = 
 American paddlefish are a popular sport fish where their populations are sufficient to allow such activity . Areas where there are no self @-@ sustaining populations rely on state and federal restocking programs to maintain a viable fishery . A 2009 report includes the following states as allowing American paddlefish sport fishing per their respective state and federal regulations : Arkansas , Illinois , Indiana , Iowa , Kansas , Kentucky , Mississippi , Missouri , Montana , Nebraska , North Dakota , Nebraska , Oklahoma , Montana , South Dakota and Tennessee . Since American paddlefish are filter @-@ feeders , they will not take bait or lures , and must be caught by snagging . The official state record in Kansas is a 144 lb ( 65 kg ) American paddlefish snagged in 2004 ; Montana , a 142 @.@ 5 lb ( 64 @.@ 6 kg ) American paddlefish snagged in 1973 ; and in North Dakota , a 130 lb ( 59 kg ) American paddlefish snagged in 2010 . The largest American paddlefish on record was captured in West <unk> Lake , Iowa in 1916 by a spear fisherman , and measured 85 in ( 2 @.@ 2 m ) long , and weighed an estimated 198 lb ( 90 kg ) . 
 = = Population declines = = 
 = = = Overfishing and habitat destruction = = = 
 American paddlefish populations have declined dramatically , primarily as a result of overfishing and habitat destruction . In 2004 they were listed as Vulnerable ( VU <unk> ver 3 @.@ 1 ) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species . They are currently proposed for listing as VU <unk> throughout their range as the result of a U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service assessment . The assessment concluded that " an overall population size reduction of at least 30 % may occur within the next 10 years or three generations due to actual or potential levels of exploitation and the effects of introduced taxa , pollutants , competitors or parasites . " American paddlefish are filter feeding pelagic fish that require large , free @-@ flowing rivers with braided channels , backwater areas , oxbow lakes that are rich in zooplankton , and gravel bars for spawning . Series of dams on rivers such as those constructed on the Missouri River have impounded large populations of American paddlefish , and blocked their upstream migration to spawning shoals . Channelization and groynes or wing dykes have caused the narrowing of rivers and altered flow , destroying crucial spawning and nursery habitat . As a result , most impounded populations are not self @-@ sustaining and must be stocked to maintain a viable sport fishery . 
 = = = Zebra mussels = = = 
 Zebra mussel infestations in the Mississippi River , Great Lakes and other Midwest rivers are also negatively affecting American paddlefish populations . Zebra mussels are an invasive species well adapted for explosive population growth as a result of high rates of fecundity and recruitment . As filter feeders , zebra mussels rely on plankton and can filter significant amounts of phytoplankton and zooplankton from the water , altering the availability of an important food source for paddlefish and native <unk> . A few days after the fertilization of zebra mussel eggs , a microscopic larva emerges called a veliger . During this initial stage of development , which usually lasts a few weeks , <unk> are able to swim freely in the water column with other microscopic animals comprising zooplankton . <unk> are poor swimmers , making them susceptible to predation by any animal that feeds on zooplankton . However , natural predation of zebra mussels at any stage of development has not made a significant contribution to the long @-@ term reduction of zebra mussel populations . 
 = = = Poaching = = = 
 Poaching is also a contributing factor to declining populations of American paddlefish in the states where they are commercially exploited , particularly while the demand for caviar remains strong . Since the 1980s , a trade embargo on Iran restricted imports of the highly sought after and most expensive beluga caviar from the Caspian Sea , limiting U.S. sources of caviar . The most sought after caviar is produced by sturgeons in the Northern Caspian Sea , but overfishing and poaching have exhausted the supply . American sturgeon and paddlefish populations were targeted as likely substitutes . 
 The roe of American paddlefish can be processed into caviar similar in taste , color , size and texture to <unk> sturgeon caviar from the Caspian Sea . Several cases of mislabeled American paddlefish roe sold as Caspian Sea caviar have been prosecuted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ( USFWS ) . State and federal regulations restricting the harvest of American paddlefish populations in the wild , and the illegal trafficking of their roe are strictly enforced . Related violations such as the illegal transport of American paddlefish roe have resulted in convictions with substantial fines and prison sentences . <unk> are also protected under CITES , ( Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora ) . 
 = Battle of Orbetello = 
 The Battle of Orbetello , also known as the Battle of Isola del Giglio , was a major naval engagement of the Franco @-@ Spanish War of 1635 . It was fought on 14 June 1646 off the Spanish @-@ ruled town of Orbetello , on the coast of Tuscany , Italy , between a French fleet led by Admiral Armand de <unk> , Marquis of Brézé , and a Spanish fleet commanded by Miguel de Noronha , 4th Count of Linhares sent to break the blockade of Orbetello and relieve the town , besieged since 12 May by a French army under the command of Prince Thomas of Savoy . The Battle of Orbetello was tactically very unusual , since it was fought by sailing ships towed by galleys in a light breeze . 
 After a hard but inconclusive fight during which Admiral Brézé was killed , the French fleet withdrew to Toulon leaving the sea to the Spanish , who decided not to pursue them to relieve Orbetello . The land forces disembarked by Count of Linhares a few days later , however , failed to dislodge the French lines , and the siege could be undertaken until 24 July , when another Spanish army led by the Marquis of <unk> and the Duke of Arcos , which had come from the Kingdom of Naples across the Papal States , defeated the besieging French troops , forcing them to retreat with heavy losses . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1646 , after several naval successes against Spain along the Mediterranean , Cardinal Mazarin planned a naval expedition to conquer the Spanish @-@ held State of <unk> with the aim of interrupting Spanish communications with the Kingdom of Naples , threatening the initial stage of the Spanish military corridor , the so @-@ called Spanish Road , and also to frighten pope Innocent X , whose Spanish sympathies displeased him . For this purpose , a fleet commanded by young Admiral Marquis of Brézé was assembled at Toulon . Made of 36 galleons , 20 galleys and a large complement of minor vessels , it had on board an army of some 8 @,@ 000 infantry and 800 cavalry with baggage under the command of Thomas Francis of Savoy , who had previously been at the employ of the Spanish Crown . 
 Orbetello was erected in a spit between two inner bays of a big lagoon . Various fortified positions made it a strong defensive position : Porto Ercole at the east , San Stefano at the west , and the fort San Filippo on the Monte <unk> island , linked to the mainland by a narrow isthmus . In the end , the French army landed at Talamone , where Brézé left to the Prince a half @-@ dozen of vessels and galleys to bombard the forts of the town . Meanwhile , he went to Porto San Stefano with 5 sailing ships and 4 galleys and bombarded the fort until it surrendered . After the loss of those positions , Don Carlo de la Gatta , the <unk> of Orbetello , retreated to the hermitage of Cristo . The isthmus was occupied thanks to a battery mounted aboard the French galleys , and soon the lagoon was filled with armed boats gathered by Jean @-@ Paul de <unk> , Chevalier Paul . Don Carlo de la Gatta , supported by just 200 Spanish and Italian soldiers , had very few opportunities to resist without help . An early relief force of 35 boats and 5 escort galleys sent from Naples with munitions and supplies was beaten , so a major fleet action was expected . 
 When news of the siege reached Spain , Philip IV gave orders to assemble a relief fleet . Second @-@ hand goods were purchased in the Netherlands and extraordinary levies were carried out across the country . The command of the expedition was entrusted to the Portuguese loyalist Miguel de Noronha , Count of Linhares , who was Captain General of the Galleys of the Mediterranean , and therefore supreme commander of the Spanish naval forces of this sea . He received orders to sail to Orbetello in command of 22 men @-@ of @-@ war of the Silver fleet and the Dunkirk squadron ; the later providing 8 frigates . At least 3 @,@ 300 soldiers were brought aboard these ships for the relief . Linhares ' second in command was Admiral General Francisco Díaz de Pimienta , who displeased by his always secondary role , had recently resigned , claiming ill health . While Pimienta would be in charge of the sailing ships , Linhares would do so with the galleys . Once at sea , the Spanish fleet was joined off the Sardinian Cape Carbonara by 18 galleys from the squadrons of Naples , Sardinia , Genoa , and Sicily , which drove up its strength to 22 galleons and frigates and 30 galleys . Grand Admiral Jean Armand de <unk> @-@ Brézé , Admiral de <unk> Brézé , in the meantime , could be reinforced by the divisions of <unk> and Saint @-@ Tropez , and was able to oppose Linhares and Pimienta with 24 sailing ships and 20 galleys . 
 = = Battle = = 
 At dawn on June 14 the Spanish fleet bore down off the Giglio Island in a line astern with the galleons and the galleys at the forefront and 8 lagging vessels closing the formation . Admiral Brézé formed his fleet in a line shortly after , alternating galleons and galleys , and sailed westward in a gentle breeze , closed with Linhares ' ships . At 9 : 00 PM . Brézé had approached four miles to the Spanish , when , due to the lightness of the wind , the galleons of the two fleets had to be towed by the galleys while awaiting to be at windward . Brézé , aboard his flagship Grand Saint @-@ Louis , stood in front of the line flanked by Vice @-@ admiral Louis de Foucault de Saint @-@ Germain Beaupré , comte du Daugnon 's la Lune and Rear @-@ admiral Jules de Montigny 's le Soleil . His ship was in tow of Lieutenant @-@ General <unk> 's <unk> galley . Fifteen other vessels composed the French line of battle , each one towed by a galley . <unk> 's six @-@ ship division was left in reserve . Both fleets sailed along each other until Linhares , thanks to the superior number of galleys that he had , gained the windward and was able to move towards the French line , attempting to overrun its line to catch it between two fires . Linhares had in tow Pimienta 's flag galleon Santiago ; don Álvaro de Bazán del Viso , general of the Neapolitan galleys , the galleon Trinidad , flagship of Admiral Pablo de Contreras ; and Enrique de Benavides , general of the Sicilian galleys , other large Spanish galleons . 
 Brézé , unable to dispatch his fireships over the Spanish vessels , as he had done in his victories at Cádiz , Barcelona and Cartagena , lunged over Pimienta 's galleon Santiago and riddled the ship with his artillery Santiago lost its main @-@ mast and had to be succored by Linhares and Pablo de Contreras . Fearing the attack of the French fireships or the boarding of Brézé 's galleys , Contreras covered the damaged galleon at the head of six vessels , while Linhares flag galley towed it out of danger . The remaining ships engaged Brézé in an inconclusive action which lasted until both fleets separated at dusk . The Spanish lost the frigate Santa Catalina , burnt by its own crew to avoid capture when she was surrounded by the French la <unk> and three other vessels . The foremost Spanish galleons Testa de Oro , León Rojo and Caballo <unk> received heavy damage , while a French fireship blew up . Two French galleons were also badly damaged . The human loss aboard the Spanish fleet is unknown . Forty men were killed or wounded aboard the French fleet One of them was Admiral Brézé , cut in half by a cannonball which hit the stern of his flagship Grand Saint Louis . 
 The following morning the Spanish and French fleets were 12 miles apart . Comte du Daugnon , Brézé 's successor , decided set sail to Porto Ercole to make repairs instead of pursuing the Spanish fleet , which had sought refuge behind the Giglio island . Linhares chased him during all the 15th and part of the 16th . 4 French storeships , unaware of the main fleet 's departure , fell amidst the Spanish fleet the first night , but managed to escape by following Linhares maneuvers . The Spanish admiral finally abandoned the pursuit to relieve Orbetello . This proved to be impossible because a storm dispersed most of the ships during the night . Some of them took refuge in Sardinia ; others at Giglio and Montecristo . The galley Santa Bárbara sank off Giglio , causing the death of 46 rowers . The French also suffered from the storm . One of their galleys , la Grimaldi , sank off Piombino , although its crew and artillery was taken aboard the Spanish fleet . Another ship , Saint @-@ Dominique , lagged behind along with a fireship and was captured by Pimienta off Cape Corse . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 On 23 June the Spanish fleet anchored off Porto Longone , where it was decided during a war council to relieve Orbetello after the most essential repairs had been made . Two days later several <unk> were dispatched to force the Talamone 's port mouth , and 8 ships arrived from Naples at Porto Santo Stefano , destroying or capturing about 70 tartanes and barges which contained the supplies of Thomas of Savoy 's army during the operation . Du Daugnon , meanwhile , returned to Toulon . Despite his failure , reinforcements could later be carried to Talamone aboard five ships , and Linhares ' attempts to dislodge the French siege lines were unsuccessful . Linhares disembarked 3 @.@ 300 soldiers led by Pimienta , who divided them in two corps and advanced upon the French lines . The first one managed to occupy a hill on which a French cavalry attack was repulsed , but the second corps was dislodged after a 6 @-@ hour battle and forced to <unk> . 400 wounded men were evacuated ; the killed were left on the battlefield . The siege was not lifted until an army under the Duke of Arcos and the Marquis of <unk> stormed the besieger camp a month later , killing or capturing over 7 @,@ 000 men and taking all the artillery and the baggage , which turned the whole French campaign into a failure . 
 Dissatisfied with the outcome of the naval battle , Philip IV , who expected that the French fleet would have been destroyed , and the honour of his navy restored , dismissed and imprisoned Count of Linhares and Admiral Pimienta , among other officers , accusing them of mismanagement and <unk> of their forces . Linhares was replaced by Luis Fernández de Córdoba , Pimienta by Jerónimo Gómez de Sandoval , and Bazán del Viso by <unk> Doria . Philip IV also appointed his 17 years old illegitimate son John of Austria as Príncipe de la mar , commander of all the Hispanic maritime forces , giving them widespread orders and powers in order to end with the misrule of the Spanish Navy . The French failure at Orbetello , nevertheless , contributed greatly to the reduction the French pressure in Italy . 6 @,@ 000 soldiers from Naples could be consequently carried to Valencia to fight against the French armies in Catalonia . On September , a French expedition led by Charles de la Porte de la <unk> , with Portuguese help , succeeded in capturing both the <unk> of Piombino and Porto Longone , which encouraged the Francesco I d 'Este , Duke of Modena , to change his allegiance from the Spanish monarchy to France .

 The novel Drive by James Sallis was published in 2005 . Producers Marc Platt and Adam Siegel of Marc Platt Productions optioned the novel after Siegel read a review in Publishers Weekly . The driver intrigued Siegel because he was " the kind of character you rarely see anymore – he was a man with a purpose ; he was very good at one thing and made no apologies for it . " The character interested Platt , because he reminded him of movie heroes he looked up to as a child , characters typically portrayed by Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood . 
 Academy Award @-@ nominated screenwriter Hossein Amini adapted the novel for the screen . He felt it was a rare book to receive from a studio because it was short , gloomy , and like a poem . Because the novel does not present a linear story but has many flashbacks and jumps around in time , Amini found the adaptation challenging . He felt the non @-@ linear structure made it " a very tricky structure " for a feature film . 
 A film adaptation of Drive was first announced in early 2008 , with Neil Marshall set to direct what was then being described as " an <unk> action mystery " that would be a starring vehicle for Hugh Jackman . Universal Studios , who had been trying to make a film version for some time , was also on board . By February 2010 , Marshall and Jackman were no longer attached to the project . When Ryan Gosling signed on as the leading role , he was allowed to choose the director . A fan of his work , the actor chose the Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn . When Refn read the first screenplay for Drive , he was more intrigued by the concept of a man having a split personality , being a stuntman by day and a getaway driver at night , than the story itself .

 Producer Marc E. Platt contacted actor Ryan Gosling regarding Drive early on . Platt explained : “ I have this list that I ’ ve created of very talented individuals whose work inspire me – writers , directors , actors whom I have to work with before I go onto another career or do something else with my life . " Near the top of Platt 's list was Gosling , who , despite having starred in several films of diverse genres , had never starred in anything like Drive . He had always been interested in doing an action @-@ oriented project ; Gosling claimed that he was simply put off from the genre , believing that the action films of today put more focus on stunts instead of characters . Despite this , Platt heard back from the actor around 48 hours later . Gosling has stated that his strong attraction to the plot led him to take on the leading role of the unnamed driver , saying that he was drawn to the " very strong character " at its core , as well as the " powerful " romance . 
 In an interview with Rotten Tomatoes , Gosling was asked , " What was it about the film ? Had you read the script when Hugh Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to make it ? " He replied : 
 " I think that might be the original one I read . I read a few drafts . I read one as well where he wasn 't a stunt driver at all , which was a newer draft – maybe that 's the one Hugh Jackman had ; I 'm not sure exactly . Basically when I read it , in trying to figure out who would do something like this , the only way to make sense of this is that this is a guy that 's seen too many movies , and he 's started to confuse his life for a film . He 's lost in the mythology of Hollywood and he 's become an amalgamation of all the characters that he admires . " 
 Gosling was given the opportunity to choose the film 's director , a first in his career : " And I thought , ' It had to be Nicolas [ Winding Refn ] . ' There was no other choice . " Believing that the director might be intimidated by the script as it was unlike anything he had done before , Gosling had concerns about Refn 's desire to participate . Refn took on the project without hesitation . 
 When casting roles in his movies , Refn doesn 't watch casting tapes or have his actors audition for him . He meets with them and casts them on the spot if he feels they 're right . Drive was the first film Carey Mulligan signed on to after being nominated for an Academy Award for her role in An Education , which was directed by another Danish filmmaker , Lone Scherfig . Scherfig is a good friend of Refn and she used to babysit him when he was a child . At the time of Mulligan ’ s casting , Refn hadn ’ t seen An Education , but his wife was big fan of the film and Mulligan ’ s performance , and she urged him to cast her . In the original script , the character was a Hispanic woman name Irina . The character was changed to Irene after Mulligan was cast . While working on the film , Mulligan moved in with Refn , his wife and two daughters in their home in Los Angeles . Hossein Amini , the film ’ s screenwriter , also lived with Refn ’ s family during the duration of the film ’ s shoot . Refn and Amini made significant changes to the original script during this time . 
 Bryan Cranston plays the role of Shannon . Cranston was one of the first actors Winding Refn looked to cast , as he was a fan of the TV series Breaking Bad . Knowing Cranston had other opportunities , Winding Refn tried to interest him by asking how he would like to develop the role . After not hearing back , Winding Refn called him , at the very same time that Cranston was writing on a piece of paper the pros and cons of doing Drive . Moved by Winding Refn 's interest , he accepted the part . Christina Hendricks plays the small role of Blanche . " Trying to work in a more reality arena for a character like that , " Winding Refn originally auditioned porn stars for Blanche . He was unable to find anyone with the necessary acting talent . After meeting with Hendricks , he decided to cast her , feeling her " powerhouse " persona would click with the character . 
 Albert Brooks plays the foul @-@ mouthed , morose Bernie Rose . When Winding Refn suggested him , Gosling agreed but thought the actor would not be up for playing a character who is violent and sullen , or for appearing in a film that he did not work on himself . Brooks accepted the role to go against type and because he loved that Bernie was not a cliché . " There are six people you could always get to play this kind of part , and I like that the director was thinking outside of the box . For me , it was an opportunity to act outside the box . I liked that this mobster had real style . Also , he doesn ’ t get up in the morning thinking about killing people . He ’ s sad about it . Upset about it . It ’ s a case of , ' Look what you made me do . ' " 
 Nino , a key villain , is portrayed by Ron Perlman , one of the last actors to join the cast . Regarding the casting of Perlman , Winding Refn said , " The character of Nino was originally not particularly interesting , so I asked Ron why he wanted to be in my movie when he 's done so many great films . When Ron said , ' I always wanted to play a Jewish man who wants to be an Italian gangster ' , and I asked why , and he said , ' because that 's what I am – a Jewish boy from New York ' , well , that automatically cemented it for me . " Oscar Isaac portrays a Latino convict named Standard who is married to Irene and is just released from prison a week after Irene meets The driver . He found the role to be a bit unappealing and chose to turn the archetypal character into something more . He said of the role , 
 " As soon as I sat down with Nicolas , he explained this universe and world of the story , so we made the character into someone interested in owning a restaurant , someone who made some wrong decisions in his life , ending up in a bad place . By making ‘ Standard ’ more specific and more interesting , we found that it made the story that more compelling . "

 The film was made on a production budget of about $ 15 million and shot in various parts of Los Angeles , California , beginning on September 25 , 2010 . Locations were picked by Winding Refn while Gosling drove him around the city at night . Under the director 's request , Los Angeles was picked as the shooting site due to budget concerns . Winding Refn moved into a plush Los Angeles home and insisted that the cast members and screenwriter Amini move in with him . They would work on the script and film all day , then watch films , edit or drive at night . Refn requested that the editing suite be placed in his home as well . With a shooting script of 81 pages , Winding Refn and Gosling continued to trim down dialog during filming . 
 Its opening chase scene involving Gosling 's character was primarily filmed by Winding Refn within the car 's interior . In an interview , Winding Refn revealed the idea for this scene was to emulate the feeling of a " diver in an ocean of sharks " , never leaving the vehicle during a car chase so that the audience can see what 's happening from the character 's point of view . Tight on money and time , he shot the scene in two days . With two different set @-@ ups prepared in the car , the director found it difficult to have mobility with the camera , so he would then switch the camera to two additional set @-@ ups nearby . As downtown Los Angeles had changed for the better , Refn avoided certain areas to preserve the gloomy atmosphere . Additionally , the scene was shot at low @-@ angles with minimal light . 
 One scene in the film that has no dialog is the elevator sequence , " a series of stunning visuals and graphic imagery that ’ s a prime example of how the film conveys so many ideas and emotions through images rather than words . " For this , he spoke to Gaspar Noé and asked him how he did the head @-@ smashing scene in Noé 's Irréversible ( 2002 ) . Crossing the line from romance to violence , the scene starts off with the driver and Irene tenderly kissing . What they share is really a goodbye kiss , as he then becomes a " werewolf , " violently stomping the hit @-@ man 's head in . Subsequently , Irene sees the driver in a new light . " Every movie has to have a heart — a place where it defines itself — and in every movie I 've made there 's always a scene that does that . On Drive , it was hard for me to wrap my head around it . I realized I needed to show in one situation that driver is the hopelessly romantic knight , but he 's also completely psychotic and is willing to use any kind of violence to protect innocence . But that scene was never written . As I was going along , it just kind of popped up , " Refn said . In March 2012 , Interiors , an online journal that is concerned with the relationship between architecture and film , released an issue that discussed how space is used in this scene . The issue highlights Nicolas Winding Refn 's use of constricted space and his way of creating a balance between romance and violence . 
 Car scenes were filmed with a " biscuit rig " , a camera car rig developed for the film Seabiscuit ( 2003 ) , which allowed stunt driver Robert Nagle to steer the car , freeing Gosling to concentrate on acting . Consistent with Winding Refn 's usual visual style , wide @-@ angle lenses were heavily used by cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel . Handheld camerawork was avoided . Preferring to keep the film more " grounded " and authentic , he also avoided use of computer @-@ generated imagery ( CGI ) . Inability to afford CGI due to budgeting restrictions also played a factor in this decision . Although many stunt drivers are credited , Gosling did a number of stunts himself , after completing a stunt driving car crash course . During production , Gosling re @-@ built the 1973 Chevrolet Malibu used in the film , taking it apart and putting it back together . Filming concluded on November 12 , 2010 . 
 Beth Mickle was hired as Drive 's production designer on Gosling 's recommendation ; they had worked together on 2006 's Half Nelson . Prior to filming , Mickle supervised a crew of 40 , routinely working 16- to 18 @-@ hour days . This was her most expensive film to date , and Mickle felt freer since , compared to Half Nelson , " there was another zero added to the budget . " The crew built the driver 's apartment building , which included a hallway and elevator that linked his unit to Irene 's . Mickle also built a strip club set and Bernie Rose 's apartment in an abandoned building . Turning a " run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mill " Los Angeles auto body shop into a grandiose dealership was one of the most challenging . Painting the walls an electric blue color , she brought in a showroom full of vintage cars . 
 Using an Arri Alexa camera , the film was shot digitally . According to executive producer David Lancaster , the film contains abundant , evocative , intense images of Los Angeles that are not often seen . " From the little seen back streets of downtown LA to the dry arid outposts on the peaks of the desert landscape surrounding it , Siegel has re @-@ imagined an LA all the way down to the rocky cliffs by the sea . " 
 While Drive is set in the present day , it carries a heavy 1980s atmosphere that is cautiously set from beginning to end and is underlined not only by the vehicles or music and clothes , but also by its architecture . The parts of the city seen in the Valley and by downtown Los Angeles are cheap stucco and mirrored glass , often leaving out more contemporary buildings . Drab background settings include the Southern California commercial strip . As the Los Angeles Times pointed out , whenever gleaming buildings are shown , it is because they are being seen from a distance . Refn shot those scenes from a helicopter at night in Bunker Hill , Los Angeles . 
 = = = Style and inspiration = = = 
 Journalists and reviewers have called Drive a " classic Los Angeles heist @-@ gone @-@ wrong story " , a " tribute to the genre of car films " in the vein of movies like Bullitt ( 1968 ) . As a character study , Drive examines themes of " loyalty , loneliness and the dark impulses that rise up even when we try our hardest to suppress them . " It combines comic gore , film noir and B @-@ movie style and Hollywood spectacle , resulting in " a bizarre concoction ... reminiscent of David Lynch 's Mulholland Drive ... Quentin Tarantino 's Pulp Fiction , and [ with ] angst @-@ laden love scenes that would not be out of place in a Scandinavian drama " . Other comparisons have been to the works of Walter Hill , John Carpenter , Michael Mann , Nathanael West , J.G. Ballard , and Mike Davis . According to Refn , Drive is dedicated to filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky and includes some of Jodorowsky 's existentialism . 
 Drive has been called a tough , hard @-@ edged neo @-@ noir art house feature , extremely violent and very stylish , with European art and grindhouse influences . According to Refn , Drive turns into a superhero film during the elevator scene when The Driver kills the villain . Drive also references 1970s and 1980s cult hits such as The Day of the Locust ( 1975 ) and To Live and Die in L.A. ( 1985 ) . Other influences can be seen in the neon @-@ bright opening credits and the retro song picks – " a mix of tension @-@ ratcheting synthesizer tones and catchy club anthems that collectively give the film its consistent tone . " Drive 's title sequence is hot @-@ pink , which was inspired by 1983 's Risky Business ' editing table . Refn has also indicated that the film 's romance was partially inspired by the films of John Hughes . 
 Winding Refn 's inspiration for Drive came partly from reading Grimm 's Fairy Tales , and his goal was to make " a fairy tale that takes Los Angeles as the background , " with The Driver as the hero . To play with the common theme of fairy tales , The Driver protects what is good while at the same time killing degenerate people in violent ways . Refn was also inspired by films such as Point Blank ( 1967 ) , Two @-@ Lane <unk> ( 1971 ) , The Driver ( 1978 ) and Thief ( 1981 ) . Jean @-@ Pierre Melville ’ s crime productions influenced the cinematography . Amini 's script propensity imposes " a kind of sideways moral code , " where even those who comply with it are almost never rewarded for their efforts , as seen when The Driver helps Standard with Irene and her son 's best interests in mind . Within their vehicles , the characters not only make escapes or commit murder , but try to obtain peace and search for romance . 
 The film 's main character , The Driver , has been compared to the Man With No Name , a character Clint Eastwood portrayed in the Sergio Leone Westerns , because he almost never speaks , communicating mostly non @-@ verbally . The Driver 's meagre dialogue is not designed to present him as tough , but to soften him . Winding Refn chose to give the Driver very little dialogue and instead have him drive around listening to synthpop music , taking control when it counts . One reviewer noted that what The Driver lacks in psychology , he makes up through action and stylish costuming . The Driver 's wardrobe , in particular the satin jacket with the logo of a golden scorpion on the back , was inspired by the band KISS and Kenneth Anger 's 1964 experimental film Scorpio Rising . Refn sees the former as the character 's armor and the logo a sign of protection . According to reviewer Peter <unk> , the jacket is a reference to the fable of the scorpion and the frog , mentioned in the movie , which in turn evokes the use of the fable in the Orson Welles film Mr. Arkadin . 
 It 's also mainly inspired by Grand theft Auto <unk> series . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Most of its ethereal electronic @-@ pop score was composed by Cliff Martinez . Refn was a particular fan of his ambient work on the Sex , Lies , and Videotape soundtrack . The score contains tracks with vintage keyboards and bluntly descriptive titles . Refn wanted electronic music for the film and to have the music occasionally be abstract so viewers can see things from the driver 's perspective . He gave composer Martinez a sampling of songs he liked and asked Martinez to emulate the sound , resulting in " a kind of retro , <unk> , synthesizer europop " . Editor Matt Newman suggested Drive 's opening credits song – " <unk> " by French electronic musician <unk> . 
 Winding Refn wanted a score by Johnny Jewel of Desire and <unk> , whose music was used in the film , but the studio had other plans . They instead hired Martinez at the last minute to imitate the style and feel of Jewel 's bands <unk> and Glass Candy . 
 As Winding Refn was going through mixer Johnny Jewel 's catalog , he picked out " Under Your Spell " and " Tick of the Clock " because he thought of Drive being a fairytale . During Drive 's climax , " A Real Hero " ' s keynote melody , about becoming " a real human being , and a real hero " , refrains because that is when the driver changes into both those statuses ' . At first , Jewel worried that " Under Your Spell " might be too literal but soon realized it is used in Drive " in the exact same way that I was feeling it when I wrote it . He definitely got the nuance of the song , and understood what it was supposed to mean , and he wanted to give that emotion to the viewer , that same feeling . " 
 Thinking of music in terms of basic elements , Jewel would tell the director that for certain scenes , it should not have bass since , as an earth tone , it usually is used for a more emotional or ominous part . Jewel thought the music should be upper register and relaxing for the " dreamlike " scene . To help himself with the writing process and conjure up melodies , the producer would perform a procedure where he highlighted many phrases from the novel , then printed those words in large font and hung them on his walls or drew pictures during viewings of Drive . 
 The soundtrack from Drive was listed on Spin magazine 's list of " 40 Movie Soundtracks That Changed Alternative Music " . 
 A re @-@ scored soundtrack for the film was produced for the BBC by Zane Lowe for its television broadcast in October 2014 . The soundtrack included original music from Chvrches , Banks , Bastille , Eric Prydz , SBTRKT , Bring Me the Horizon , The 1975 and Laura Mvula .

 Prior to principal photography , Refn went to the 2010 Cannes Film Festival in an effort to sell the rights to Drive and released promotional posters for the film . In November 2010 , <unk> acquired North American distribution rights . The owners were so eager to get their hands on Drive , they started negotiating to buy it before seeing any footage , believing it could appeal to people who enjoy a genre movie , as well as the arthouse crowd . The film had a release date of September 16 , 2011 , in the United States . 
 The film premiered on May 20 , in competition at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival . At its first showing to the media , it received abundant praise and received " some of the best responses of the festival " , but one positive review said it " can 't win , won 't win " Cannes 's top prize . It was greeted with hoots and howls of joy from the media , with viewers cheering on some of the scenes featuring extreme violence . Drive also received a 15 @-@ minute standing ovation from the crowd . Xan Brooks of The Guardian called the film his guilty pleasure of the 2011 competition , labeling it an enjoyable affair . " Over the past 10 days we 've witnessed great art and potent social commentary ; the birth of the cosmos and the end of the world . Turns out what we really wanted all along was a scene in which a man gets his head stomped in a lift . They welcome it in like a long @-@ lost relation , " he wrote . The festival named Refn best director for Drive . 
 Drive was also screened at the Los Angeles Time 's Los Angeles Film Festival ( <unk> ) on June 20 at its gala screenings program . It was among more than 200 feature films , short projects , and music videos , from more than 30 countries , to be shown at the festival . After Red Dog 's release date was pushed up by several days , Drive replaced it as the Melbourne International Film Festival 's closing night film . Additionally , the movie was screened during <unk> 's studio panel presentation at the San Diego Comic @-@ Con function . A secret screening for Drive was held at London 's Empire Big Screen during the middle of August . In September , Drive screened as a special presentation during the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival , alongside another movie starring Gosling , The Ides of March .

 Drive received critical acclaim upon its release in 2011 . Critics lauded Refn 's direction , the cast ( especially Gosling and Brooks ) , Martinez 's score , the visual style and action sequences , though some critics found the violence off @-@ putting . The film has an approval score of 92 % on Rotten Tomatoes based on 238 reviews and an average rating of 8 @.@ 3 out of 10 . The critical consensus states : " With its hyper @-@ stylized blend of violence , music , and striking imagery , Drive represents a fully realized vision of arthouse action . " The film also has a score of 78 out of 100 on Metacritic , based on 43 reviews indicating " generally favorable reviews " . 
 It was one of the highest @-@ ranked and most @-@ featured films on critics ’ year @-@ end top 10 lists . It ranked as fourth best film of the year , behind The Tree of Life , The Artist , and Melancholia on Metacritic 's tally of top 10 lists . On Movie City News ’ tally it ranked third , behind The Tree of Life and The Descendants . 
 The writers for the film magazine Empire listed Drive as their number one film of 2011 . Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film 4 out of 4 stars , declaring that Drive was “ a brilliant piece of nasty business , ” and that “ Refn is a virtuoso , blending tough and tender with such uncanny skill that he deservedly won the Best Director prize at Cannes . " It was his top film of 2011 . Richard Roeper said that " Drive is an adrenalin shot to the senses . I love this movie and as soon as it was over , I wanted to see it again . ” James Rocchi , writing for The Playlist , gave the film an A letter grade and said , " Drive works as a great demonstration of how , when there ’ s true talent behind the camera , entertainment and art are not enemies but allies . ” Both Roeper and Rocchi also placed Drive as their number one film of 2011 . 
 Stephanie Zacharek of Movieline complimented the film 's action and wrote that it “ defies all the current trends in mainstream action filmmaking . The driving sequences are shot and edited with a surgeon ’ s clarity and precision . Refn doesn ’ t chop up the action to fool us into thinking it ’ s more exciting than it is . ” She also admired Refn ’ s skill in handling the film ’ s violence and the understated romance between Gosling and Mulligan . Her score for the film was 9 @.@ 5 / 10 Drive was Roger Ebert 's seventh best film of 2011 . In praising the film , he wrote , “ Here is a movie with respect for writing , acting , and craft . It has respect for knowledgeable moviegoers . ” Like Zacharek , Ebert admired Drive ’ s action sequences , which were practically made and didn ’ t rely on CGI . 
 The Wall Street Journal ’ s Joe Morgenstern called Albert Brooks ' villainous performance " sensational " . " Prepare to be blown away by Albert Brooks , " said Peter Travers , " Brooks ' performance , veined with dark humor and chilling menace ( watch him with a blade ) , deserves to have Oscar calling . " Albert Brooks won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor . He was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Supporting Actor – Motion Picture . 
 Joshua Rothkopf , writing for Time Out ( New York ) , stated , " Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn ( Bronson ) has taken the opportunity to work in America and pushed it to delirious limits ; his effort , a foreigner 's impassioned take on ’ 80s @-@ synth @-@ scored romance and highway mayhem , plays like the work of a student graduating with highest honors . ” Drive was Rothkopf ’ s choice for film of the year . Salon.com 's Andrew O 'Hehir lauded Albert Brooks against @-@ type performance as the film 's villain and called it " unforgettable " . On the elevator sequence in the film , which juxtaposes romance with violence , O <unk> commended it and proclaimed that it is a sequence that " film students will be deconstructing , shot by shot , for years to come . " 
 The violence of the film was off @-@ putting for some reviewers . In a negative review by Anthony Lane in The New Yorker , he wrote that Drive 's violence was far too graphic , and it ultimately was a detriment to the film . Referring to the violence , he said , " In grabbing our attention , he diverts it from what matters . The horror lingers and seeps ; the feelings are sponged away . " The Chicago Tribune 's Michael Philips felt similarly , and while he enjoyed the film early on , Drive became " one garishly sadistic set piece after another . " Additionally , Phillips thought the film relied too much on " stylistic preening " and did not have enough substance . In 2014 , The Huffington Post included Drive on its " 8 Movies From The Last 15 Years That Are Super Overrated " list . 
 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a score of C − ; this was attributed to audiences feeling tricked , having expected more driving and more action based on the marketing .

The Drive soundtrack is such an integral part of the experience of the film , once you see it , you can 't imagine the film without it . " AllMusic reviewer James Christopher Monger selected opening track " <unk> " , " I Drive " , " Hammer " and " Bride of Deluxe " as highlights on it . Digital Spy 's Mayer Nissim gave it a four out of five star rating , finding it to be as important as the film itself . She stated the album beginning with non @-@ Martinez songs instead of mixing it up for a more enjoyable listening experience cost it a star .

 = Elliott Smith = 
 Steven Paul " Elliott " Smith ( August 6 , 1969 – October 21 , 2003 ) was an American singer , songwriter , and musician . Smith was born in Omaha , Nebraska , raised primarily in Texas , and lived for much of his life in Portland , Oregon , where he first gained popularity . Smith 's primary instrument was the guitar , though he was also proficient with piano , clarinet , bass guitar , drums , and harmonica . Smith had a distinctive vocal style , characterized by his " whispery , spiderweb @-@ thin delivery " , and used multi @-@ tracking to create vocal layers , textures , and harmonies . 
 After playing in the rock band Heatmiser for several years , Smith began his solo career in 1994 , with releases on the independent record labels Cavity Search and Kill Rock Stars ( KRS ) . In 1997 , he signed a contract with DreamWorks Records , for which he recorded two albums . Smith rose to mainstream prominence when his song " Miss Misery " — included in the soundtrack for the film Good Will Hunting ( 1997 ) — was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Original Song category in 1998 . 
 Smith suffered from depression , alcoholism , and drug dependence , and these topics often appear in his lyrics . In 2003 , aged 34 , he died in Los Angeles , California from two stab wounds to the chest . The autopsy evidence was inconclusive as to whether the wounds were self @-@ inflicted . At the time of his death , Smith was working on his sixth studio album , From a Basement on the Hill , which was posthumously completed and released in 2004 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Steven Paul Smith was born at the Clarkson Hospital in Omaha , Nebraska , the only child to Gary Smith , a student at the University of Nebraska Medical Center , and Bunny Kay Berryman , an elementary school music teacher . His parents divorced when he was six months old , and Smith moved with his mother to Duncanville , Texas . Smith later had a tattoo of a map of Texas drawn on his upper arm and said : " I didn 't get it because I like Texas , kind of the opposite . But I won 't forget about it , although I 'm tempted to because I don 't like it there . " 
 Smith endured a difficult childhood and a troubled relationship with his stepfather Charlie Welch . Smith stated he may have been sexually abused by Welch at a young age , an allegation which Welch has denied . He wrote about this part of his life in " Some Song " : " How they beat you up week after week , and when you grow up you 're going to be a freak . " The name " Charlie " also appears in songs " Flowers for Charlie " and " No Confidence Man . " In a 2004 interview , Jennifer Chiba , Smith 's partner at the time of his death , said that Smith 's difficult childhood was partly why he needed to sedate himself with drugs as an adult : " He was remembering traumatic things from his childhood – parts of things . It 's not my place to say what . " 
 For much of his childhood , Smith 's family was a part of the Community of Christ but began attending services at a local Methodist Church . Smith felt that going to church did little for him , except make him " really scared of Hell " . In 2001 , he said : " I don 't necessarily buy into any officially structured version of spirituality . But I have my own version of it . " 
 Smith began playing piano at age nine , and at ten began learning guitar on a small acoustic guitar bought for him by his father . At this age he composed an original piano piece , " Fantasy " , which won him a prize at an arts festival . Many of the people on his mother 's side of the family were non @-@ professional musicians ; his grandfather was a Dixieland drummer , and his grandmother sang in a glee club . 
 At fourteen , Smith left his mother 's home in Texas and moved to Portland , Oregon to live with his father , then working as a psychiatrist . It was around this time that Smith began using drugs , including alcohol , with friends . He also began experimenting with recording for the first time after borrowing a four @-@ track recorder . At high school , Smith played clarinet in the school band and played guitar and piano ; he also sang in the bands Stranger Than Fiction and A Murder of Crows , billed as either Steven Smith or " Johnny Panic " . He graduated from Lincoln High School as a National Merit Scholar . 
 After graduation , Smith began calling himself " Elliott " , saying that he thought " Steve " sounded too much like a " jock " name , and that " Steven " sounded " too bookish " . According to friends , he had also used the pseudonym " Elliott Stillwater @-@ Rotter " during his time in the band A Murder of Crows . Biographer S. R. Shutt speculates that the name was either inspired by Elliott Avenue , a street that Smith had lived on in Portland , or that it was suggested by his then @-@ girlfriend . A junior high acquaintance of Smith speculates Smith changed his name so as not to be confused with Steve Smith , the drummer of Journey . 
 = = Career = = 
 = = = 1991 – 93 : Heatmiser = = = 
 Smith graduated from Hampshire College in Amherst , Massachusetts in 1991 with a degree in philosophy and political science . " Went straight through in four years " , he explained to Under the Radar in 2003 . " I guess it proved to myself that I could do something I really didn 't want to for four years . Except I did like what I was studying . At the time it seemed like , ' This is your one and only chance to go to college and you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did . ' Plus , the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend , and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day . " After he graduated , he " worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor 's degree in philosophy and legal theory " . 
 While at Hampshire , Smith formed the band Heatmiser with classmate Neil Gust . After Smith graduated from Hampshire , the band added drummer Tony Lash and bassist Brandt Peterson and began performing around Portland in 1992 . The group released the albums Dead Air ( 1993 ) and Cop and Speeder ( 1994 ) as well as the Yellow No. 5 EP ( 1994 ) on Frontier Records . They were then signed to Virgin Records to release what became their final album , Mic City Sons ( 1996 ) . 
 Around this time , Smith and Gust worked a number of odd jobs around Portland , including installing drywall , spreading gravel , transplanting bamboo trees , and painting the roof of a warehouse with heat reflective paint . The pair were also on unemployment benefits for some time , which they considered an " artist grant " . 
 Smith had begun his solo career while still in Heatmiser , and the success of his first two releases created distance and tension with his band . Heatmiser disbanded prior to the release of Mic City Sons , prompting Virgin to put the album out inauspiciously through its independent arm , Caroline Records . A clause in Heatmiser 's record contract with Virgin meant that Smith was still bound to it as an individual . The contract was later bought out by DreamWorks prior to the recording of his fourth album , XO . 
 = = = 1994 : Roman Candle = = = 
 His first release , Roman Candle ( 1994 ) , came about when Smith 's girlfriend at the time convinced him to send a tape of " the most recent eight songs that [ he 'd ] recorded on borrowed four @-@ tracks and borrowed guitar " to Cavity Search Records . Owner Christopher Cooper immediately requested to release the entire album of songs , which surprised Smith , as he was expecting only a deal for a seven @-@ inch record . Regarding the record , Smith said : " I thought my head would be chopped off immediately when it came out because at the time it was so opposite to the grunge thing that was popular ... The thing is that album was really well received , which was a total shock , and it immediately eclipsed [ Heatmiser ] , unfortunately . " 
 Smith felt his solo songs were not representative of the music Heatmiser was making : " The idea of playing [ my music ] for people didn 't occur to me ... because at the time it was the Northwest — Mudhoney and Nirvana — and going out to play an acoustic show was like crawling out on a limb and begging for it to be sawed off . " 
 The instrumentation of the recordings was primarily acoustic guitar , occasionally accompanied by brief electric guitar riffs or a small drum set played with brushes . Only the final track , an instrumental titled " Kiwi <unk> 20 / 20 " ( a reference to the low @-@ end fortified wine ) , had full band instrumentation . 
 One of Smith 's first solo performances was at the now @-@ defunct Umbra Penumbra on September 17 , 1994 . Only three songs from Roman Candle were performed , with the majority of the ten @-@ song set being B @-@ sides , Heatmiser tunes and unreleased tracks . Soon after this performance , Smith was asked to open for Mary Lou Lord on a week @-@ long U.S. tour . She later recorded one of his songs , " I <unk> You Out " , which he had discarded for sounding " too much like the Eagles " . 
 The same year , Smith released a split 7 " single with Pete Krebs , contributing the track " No Confidence Man " as the single 's B @-@ side . 
 = = = 1995 – 96 : Elliott Smith and Either / Or = = = 
 In 1995 , Smith 's self @-@ titled album was released on Kill Rock Stars ; the record featured a style of recording similar to Roman Candle , but with hints of growth and experimentation . Though the majority of the album was recorded by Smith alone , friend and The <unk> vocalist Rebecca Gates sang harmony vocals on " St. Ides Heaven " , and Heatmiser guitarist Neil Gust played guitar on " Single File " . Several songs made reference to drugs , but Smith explained that he used the theme of drugs as a vehicle for conveying dependence rather than the songs being about drugs specifically . Looking back , Smith felt that the album 's pervasive mood gave him " a reputation for being a really dark , depressed person " and said that he later made a conscious move toward more diverse moods in his music . 
 In 1996 , filmmaker Jem Cohen recorded Smith playing acoustic songs for the short film Lucky Three : An Elliott Smith Portrait . Two of these songs would appear on his next album , Either / Or , which was another Kill Rock Stars release . Either / Or came out in 1997 to favorable reviews . The album found Smith venturing further into full instrumentation , with several songs containing bass guitar , drums , keyboards , and electric guitars , all played by Smith . The album title was derived from the two @-@ volume book of the same name by Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard , whose works generally deal with themes such as existential despair , angst , death , and God . 
 By this time , Smith 's already @-@ heavy drinking was being compounded with use of anti @-@ depressants . At the end of the Either / Or tour , some of his close friends staged an intervention in Chicago , but it proved ineffective . Shortly after , Smith relocated from Portland to Brooklyn , New York . 
 = = = 1997 – 98 : " Miss Misery " and the Oscars = = = 
 In 1996 , Smith was selected by director and fellow Portland resident Gus Van Sant to be a part of the soundtrack to his film , Good Will Hunting . Smith recorded an orchestral version of " Between the Bars " with composer Danny Elfman for the movie . Smith also contributed a new song , " Miss Misery " , and three previously released tracks ( " No Name # 3 " , from Roman Candle , and " Angeles " and " Say Yes " , from Either / Or ) . The film was a commercial and critical success , and Smith was nominated for an Academy Award for " Miss Misery " . Not eager to step into the limelight , he agreed to perform the song at the ceremony only after the producers informed him that his song would be played live that night — either by him or another musician of their choosing . 
 On March 5 , 1998 , Smith made his network television debut on Late Night with Conan O 'Brien performing " Miss Misery " solo on acoustic guitar . A few days later , wearing a white suit , he played an abridged version of the song at the Oscars , accompanied by the house orchestra . James Horner and Will Jennings won the award that night for best song with " My Heart Will Go On " ( sung by Celine Dion ) from the film Titanic . Smith did not voice disappointment about not winning the award . 
 Smith commented on the surrealism of the Oscars experience : " That 's exactly what it was , surreal ... I enjoy performing almost as much as I enjoy making up songs in the first place . But the Oscars was a very strange show , where the set was only one song cut down to less than two minutes , and the audience was a lot of people who didn 't come to hear me play . I wouldn 't want to live in that world , but it was fun to walk around on the moon for a day . " 
 = = = 1998 – 2000 : XO and Figure 8 = = = 
 In 1998 , after the success of Either / Or and " Miss Misery " , Smith signed to a bigger record label , DreamWorks Records . Around the same time , Smith fell into depression , speaking openly of considering suicide , and on at least one occasion made a serious attempt at ending his own life . While in North Carolina , he became severely intoxicated and ran off a cliff . He landed on a tree , which badly impaled him but broke his fall . When questioned about his suicide attempt , he told an interviewer , " Yeah , I jumped off a cliff , but let 's talk about something else . " 
 Christopher Cooper , head of Cavity Search Records ( which released Roman Candle ) , said about this time in Smith 's life , " I talked him out of thinking that he wanted to kill himself numerous times when he was in Portland . I kept telling him that he was a brilliant man , and that life was worth living , and that people loved him . " Pete Krebs also agreed : " In Portland we got the brunt of Elliott 's initial depression ... Lots of people have stories of their own experiences of staying up with Elliott ' til five in the morning , holding his hand , telling him not to kill himself . " 
 Smith 's first release for DreamWorks was later that year . Titled XO , it was conceived and developed while Smith wrote it out over the winter of 1997 / 1998 , night after night seated at the bar in Luna Lounge . It was produced by the team of Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock . XO also contained some instrumentation from Los Angeles musicians Joey Waronker and Jon Brion . It contained a more full @-@ sounding , baroque pop sound than any of his previous efforts , with songs featuring a horn section , Chamberlins , elaborate string arrangements , and even a drum loop on the song " Independence Day " . His familiar double @-@ tracked vocal and acoustic guitar style were still apparent while his somewhat personal lyrical style survived . The album went on to peak at number 104 on the Billboard 200 and number 123 on the UK Album Charts , while selling 400 @,@ 000 copies ( more than double that of each of his two Kill Rock Stars releases ) , becoming the best @-@ selling release of his career . Smith 's backing band during most of this period was the Portland @-@ based group Quasi , consisting of former bandmate Sam Coomes on bass guitar and Coomes 's ex @-@ wife Janet Weiss on drums . Quasi also performed as the opening act at many shows on the tour , with Smith sometimes contributing bass guitar , guitar , or backing vocals . On October 17 , 1998 , Smith appeared on Saturday Night Live and performed " Waltz # 2 ( XO ) " . His backing band for this appearance was John Moen , Jon Brion , Rob Schnapf , and Sam Coomes . 
 In response to whether the change to a bigger record label would influence his creative control , Smith said , " I think despite the fact that sometimes people look at major labels as simply money @-@ making machines , they 're actually composed of individuals who are real people , and there 's a part of them that needs to feel that part of their job is to put out good music . " Smith also claimed in another interview that he never read his reviews for fear that they would interfere with his songwriting . It was during this period that Smith appeared on Dutch television in 1998 and provided a candid interview in which he spoke of his assessment of his music career until that point : 
 Yeah , I don 't know . I mean , I mostly only know things are different because people ask me different questions , but I don 't feel like things are very changed . I mean , I still , I do the same things that I did before … I think about the same things , so … I 'm the wrong kind of person to be really big and famous . 
 As part of the Dutch television special , Smith played live versions of " Waltz # 2 ( XO ) " , " Miss Misery " , and " I Didn 't Understand " — the latter two songs were performed solely on piano , while the first song was cut short by Smith , as he explained : " I had to stop it because it 's … you know , what 's the point of playing a song badly ? It 'd be better to play it and mean it , than to just walk through it . " 
 Smith relocated from Brooklyn to Los Angeles in 1999 , taking up residence at a cabin in the Silver Lake section of town . That fall , his cover of The Beatles ' " Because " was featured in the end credits of DreamWorks ' Oscar @-@ winning drama American Beauty , and also appeared on the film 's soundtrack album .
