 Aviation in Indonesia serves as a critical means of connecting the thousands of islands throughout the archipelago . Indonesia is the largest archipelagic country in the world , extending 5 @,@ 120 kilometres ( 3 @,@ 181 mi ) from east to west and 1 @,@ 760 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 094 mi ) from north to south , comprising 13 @,@ 466 islands , with 922 of those permanently inhabited . With an estimated population of over 255 million people — making it the world 's fourth @-@ most @-@ populous country — and also due to the growth of the middle @-@ class and the advent of low @-@ cost carriers in the recent decade , Indonesia is widely regarded as an emerging market for air travel in the region . Between 2009 and 2014 , the number of Indonesian air passengers increased from 27 @,@ 421 @,@ 235 to 94 @,@ 504 @,@ 086 , an increase of over threefold . 
 However , safety issues continue to be a persistent problem in Indonesian aviation . Several accidents have given Indonesia 's air transport system the reputation of the least safe in the world . Indonesian aviation faces numerous challenges , including poorly maintained , outdated , and often overwhelmed infrastructure , the factor of human error , bad weather , haze problems caused by plantation fires , and volcanic ash spewed by numerous area volcanoes that disrupts air transportation . 
 In Indonesia , there are 22 commercial scheduled airlines that carry more than 30 passengers , and 32 commercial scheduled airlines that transport 30 or less passengers , as well as chartered airlines . Garuda Indonesia is the flag carrier of Indonesia . 
 The Indonesian Air Force has 34 @,@ 930 personnel equipped with 224 aircraft , among them 110 combat aircraft . The Indonesian Air Force possesses and operates numerous military air bases and military airstrips across the archipelago . 
 The International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) has predicted that Indonesia will become the world 's sixth largest air travel market by 2034 . Around 270 million passengers are predicted to fly from and within Indonesia by 2034 . 
 = = Air transit policy = = 
 As a large country spanning over three <unk> , Indonesia possesses a vast airspace . However , Indonesia is not a participant of the International Air Services Transit Agreement ( <unk> ) , therefore both Indonesian airspace and airports are closed for foreign commercial airlines ' freedoms of the air , unless there were bilateral transit agreements negotiated with other countries . Indonesia and Australia for example , signed a bilateral agreement relating to air service on 7 February 2013 . According to this agreement , each nations grants to the other party the right to fly across its territory without landing , and the right to make stops in its territory for non @-@ traffic purposes ( 1st and 2nd freedom ) , and the rights for designated airlines to operate services . 
 Indonesia is the largest aviation market in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) . However , Indonesia is not yet a full member of the ASEAN open sky agreement , which plans to lift regional flying restrictions throughout Southeast Asia on member country airlines by the end of 2015 or early 2016 . Indonesia is considering opening up only five of its international airports under this policy ; they are Jakarta , Medan , Bali , Surabaya and Makassar . To date , Indonesia has agreed to open access to Jakarta , yet , Indonesia remains opposed to opening up its secondary cities . Currently Indonesia adopt limitations for foreign airlines to operate in Indonesia . This rather protectionist stance was meant to protect Indonesian aviation business against competitors , particularly from Singapore and Malaysia . Basically , this stance is stemmed from a systematic imbalance between ASEAN nations ; as a large nation , Indonesia is able to offer hundreds of access points , while other fellow ASEAN members may offer far less points of access . Singapore for example has only one point of access , while Malaysia may offer two or three access points . This systematic imbalance for exchange of traffic rights has led Indonesian carriers to lobby their government to refrain from entering into multilateral agreement on ASEAN Single Aviation Market . 
 Access to foreign carriers on domestic routes is disallowed , while international flights will be subject to bilateral agreements . To get around this policy , in order to operate within Indonesia , foreign airlines first have to own and operate an Indonesian @-@ based airline . An example of this practice is Indonesia AirAsia , a branch of Malaysian AirAsia ; it previously operated as local airline <unk> in 2004 , before changed to Indonesia AirAsia in 2005 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Colonial era = = = 
 Aviation service was pioneered in the early 20th century in colonial Dutch East Indies . On 1 October 1924 , KLM started its first intercontinental flight , connecting Amsterdam to Batavia ( now Jakarta ) in a Fokker F @-@ VII airplane . By September 1929 KLM had started regularly scheduled service between Amsterdam and Batavia . The route connected Amsterdam to Marseille , Rome , Brindisi , Athens , <unk> Matruh , Cairo , Gaza , Baghdad , Bushire , <unk> , <unk> , Gwadar , Karachi , Jodhpur , Allahabad , Calcutta , Akyab , Rangoon , Bangkok , <unk> Star , Medan , Palembang , and Batavia , and extended to Bandung . Until the outbreak of the Second World War , this was the world 's longest @-@ distance scheduled service . 
 The Koninklijke Nederlandsch @-@ Indische <unk> Maatschappij ( KNILM ) — the airline of the former Dutch East Indies — was established on 16 July 1928 . Its first regular operations were between Batavia – Bandung , and Batavia – Semarang , starting on 1 November 1928 . The inaugural ceremony was held at <unk> airport in Batavia ( now Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport ) . The Batavia @-@ Semarang flight was later extended to Surabaya . Gradually , the services were expanded to include other islands in the archipelago , namely Palembang and Medan in Sumatra , Balikpapan and Tarakan in Kalimantan , and Denpasar in Bali . Immediately before the Pacific War , KNILM also created a network in the east of the East Indies archipelago , serving towns such as Ambon . For this purpose , amphibious aircraft such as the Sikorsky S @-@ 42 and S @-@ 43 and the Grumman G @-@ 21 seaplanes were used , due to the lack of airstrip facilities in the region . 
 As early as 1930 , KNILM began its first international flight to Singapore . In June 1937 , several cities in the Dutch East Indies were visited by Amelia Earhart during her attempted circumnavigation . From Singapore , Earhart flew to Bandung , Surabaya , and Kupang before continuing her journey to Darwin , Australia . On 3 July 1938 , KNILM began operations to Sydney , stopping at Darwin , Cloncurry , and Charleville . KNILM did not fly to the Netherlands , as the Amsterdam @-@ Batavia weekly service was operated by KLM . 
 During the Japanese attack of the Dutch East Indies , KNILM was utilized for evacuation flights and transport of troops . KNILM could not operate in East Indies because of World War II and the ensuing Indonesian war for independence , and disbanded completely on 1 August 1947 . Its remaining assets were transferred to KLM , which created the KLM <unk> Bedrijf ( <unk> Service ) . 
 = = = Republic era = = = 
 The Republic of Indonesia declared its independence on 17 August 1945 and the war of independence ensued . After enduring five years of war and securing recognition of Indonesian Independence in late 1949 , the aviation service reopened for business . The KLM <unk> Bedrijf was nationalized by the Indonesian government in December 1949 as Garuda Indonesia , the national airline of the republic , and began to operate air services in the Indonesian archipelago . 
 In the early years of the Indonesian Republic , Garuda Indonesia dominated the air transport service in the country , connecting major cities in the archipelago . In 1956 , the Garuda Indonesia operated its first hajj flight to Mecca with Convair aircraft , carrying 40 Indonesian pilgrims . In 1963 , the airline launched flights to Hong Kong . By the mid 1960s , the airline took delivery of its first Douglas DC @-@ 8 and grew beyond the Asian market , beginning scheduled flights to Amsterdam and Frankfurt via Colombo , Bombay , and Prague . Rome and Paris became the airline 's third and fourth European destinations , with flights stopping in Bombay and Cairo to refuel . Flights to the People 's Republic of China began that same year , with service to Canton via Phnom Penh . 
 In 1962 , the government @-@ owned Merpati Nusantara Airlines was established to serve <unk> <unk> ( pioneer flights ) with small aircraft to connect remote locations in the archipelago . The airline however , ceased its operations in February 2014 and subsequently filed for bankruptcy . 
 In 1969 , Indonesia 's private aviation service began to grow with the establishment of Mandala Airlines , followed by <unk> in 1970 . These two airlines directly competed against the government @-@ owned Garuda Indonesia and Merpati Nusantara airlines , and survived until the 2000s . The <unk> ceased its operations in 2005 . Mandala was bought by Singapore @-@ based Tigerair Group in 2012 , but Tigerair Mandala ceased its operation in 2014 . 
 In 2000 , the Indonesian government announced the aviation deregulation policy , which makes it easier to acquire a permit to establish a new airline company . The policy was meant to stimulate air transportation investments and increase air @-@ travel business in the country , as well as to serve and stimulate tourism industry in the region . As a result , many new airlines began to spring up in Indonesia , among them Lion Air ( est . 1999 ) , Sriwijaya Air ( est . 2003 ) , Adam Air ( operating from 2002 to 2008 ) , and Batavia Air ( operating from 2002 to 2013 ) . The deregulation also spurred the low @-@ cost carrier service in Indonesia . Previously , air travel service was dominated by well @-@ established airlines such as Garuda Indonesia and Merpati . 
 Due to poor government control and supervision , however , aviation service deregulation provoked price wars among low @-@ cost carriers , resulting in fierce commercial competition at the expense of poor maintenance and service breakdown . Consequently , throughout the 2000s , the number of Indonesian aviation accidents and incidents spiked tremendously . The most notable aviation accidents that occurred during this period were Lion Air Flight 538 in Surakarta ( 30 November 2004 , killing 25 ) and the Adam Air Flight 574 crash into the Makassar Strait ( 1 January 2007 , killing 107 ) . The aviation safety records in Indonesia continued to plummet in a series of flight accidents , including Garuda Indonesia Flight 421 emergency landing on the Bengawan Solo River ( 16 January 2002 , killing 1 stewardess ) , and Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 in Yogyakarta ( 7 March 2007 , killing 21 ) . 
 In June 2007 , the European Union banned Garuda Indonesia , along with all other Indonesian airlines , from flying into any European country due to poor safety records . The ban on Garuda Indonesia was lifted in July 2009 . 
 By the 2010s , the condition of Indonesian aviation began to improve compared to the previous decade . The air travel incident rate in 2010 also dropped by 40 % compared to 2009 . Nevertheless , several accidents occurred in the ensuing period . 
 The most significant current problems in Indonesian aviation are poor development and maintenance of air transportation infrastructure , especially in remote areas . Other significant problems include overcapacity ; the massive surge of air travelers in recent years , prompted by the growth of low @-@ cost carrier passengers , has put intense stress on the aging airport infrastructure in Indonesia . 
 = = Airports = = 
 Indonesia possesses 673 airports in 2013 , ranging from grand international airports to modest unpaved airstrips on remote islands or inland interior areas located throughout the archipelago . In November 2011 , Indonesia had more than 230 conventional airports , most of them operated by Transportation Ministry technical operation units and state @-@ owned PT Angkasa Pura I & II . Major airports are managed by Angkasa Pura ; Angkasa Pura I operates 13 airports in Eastern Indonesia , while Angkasa Pura II operates 13 airports in Western Indonesia . After the 2000 aviation deregulation , Indonesian airports endured a surge of passengers , especially catalyzed by the advent of low @-@ cost carriers . According to the Indonesian Transportation Ministry , 9 of the 13 airports managed by PT Angkasa Pura I have exceeded their passenger capacity . 
 Jakarta 's Soekarno – Hatta International Airport serves as the country 's main air transportation hub as well as the nation 's busiest . Since 2010 , it has become the busiest airport in Southeast Asia , surpassing Suvarnabhumi and Changi airports . In May 2014 , it became the eighth busiest airport in the world with 62 @.@ 1 million passengers . It is also the busiest airport in the Southern Hemisphere . In October 2015 , the airport is named as Asia 's largest <unk> , and ranked the 17th most @-@ connected airport in the world . 
 Next to Soekarno @-@ Hatta , the top five busiest airports in Indonesia which serve as the nation 's regional hubs are Juanda ( Surabaya ) , Ngurah Rai ( Bali ) , Sultan Hasanuddin ( Makassar ) , and Kuala Namu ( Medan ) . 
 The surge of air travellers , catalyzed by low @-@ cost carriers and the rise of air @-@ transport demands among Indonesia 's rising middle class , has put intense stress on Indonesia 's aging airports . Nevertheless , there has been some efforts to improve and upgrade airport facilities , such as the construction of Medan 's brand @-@ new Kuala Namu Airport to replace the overwhelmed , aging , and accident @-@ prone Polonia Airport . Other newly built airports include Lombok Airport , replacing the old <unk> Airport in Lombok ; and Minangkabau Airport , replacing the old <unk> Airport in Padang . Existing airports that have undergone massive expansion and upgrades include Ngurah Rai Airport in Bali , Juanda Airport in Surabaya , and Sultan Hasanuddin Airport in Makassar . There are plans to build a second Bali airport in <unk> <unk> near <unk> , northern Bali , a new larger airport in Kulon Progo near Yogyakarta to replace the crowded and overwhelmed <unk> Airport , and a new airport in <unk> , <unk> , to replace Bandung 's Husein <unk> Airport and also to serve the vicinity of Cirebon . To improve transportation interconnectivity , the government plans to build railways connecting airports all over Indonesia with nearby city centers . Currently , only Kuala Namu and <unk> airports have a railway connection to the city center , while airport railways are currently under construction in Soekarno – Hatta and Minangkabau airports .

 = Ontario Highway 35 = 
 King 's Highway 35 , also known as Highway 35 , is a provincial highway in the Canadian province of Ontario , linking Highway 401 with Peterborough , Kawartha Lakes , and Algonquin Park . The highway travels from west of Newcastle , through Lindsay and the <unk> and into Haliburton before terminating at Highway 60 to the west of Algonquin Park , the province 's largest . The winding course of the highway , combined with the picturesque views offered along its length , have led some to declare it the most scenic highway in Ontario . 
 Most of the highway , including a portion of today 's Highway 60 , was assumed by the Department of Highways by 1940 . In 1961 , Highway 115 was signed concurrently with Highway 35 for 19 kilometres ( 12 mi ) . This was widened to a divided expressway in the late eighties . In the mid @-@ 1950s , several bypasses were constructed to divert Highway 35 away from town centres such as Lindsay , Fenelon Falls and Minden . 
 Highway 35 is patrolled along its entirety by the Ontario Provincial Police . The speed limit for most of the length of the highway is 80 kilometres per hour ( 50 mph ) , slowing to 50 km / h ( 31 mph ) within built @-@ up areas , and increasing to 90 km / h ( 56 mph ) when it connects with Highway 115 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Highway 35 begins at a trumpet interchange with Highway 401 , and is concurrent with Highway 115 for 18 @.@ 9 km ( 11 @.@ 7 mi ) to Enterprise Hill . For the length of this concurrency , it is a divided four lane expressway with no left turns , known as right @-@ in / right @-@ out ( RIRO ) . At Enterprise Hill , Highway 35 exits the divided highway ( which continues as Highway 115 east to Peterborough ) and proceeds north as a two lane road . The highway crosses the Oak Ridges Moraine as it passes into the City of Kawartha Lakes . The terrain flattens approaching Lindsay , which the highway bypasses . Between Lindsay and Coboconk , the route is generally straight and crosses through a mix of agricultural lands and forest . After passing through Coboconk , it descends from the flat limestone plateau into the rocky Canadian Shield south of Norland . The highway hugs the Gull River north of Norland and cuts through granite along its route into the Haliburton Highlands . After passing Minden , the scenic highway begins diving into valleys and along cliffs overlooking several lakes . 
 Highway 35 generally follows the former Bobcaygeon Colonization Road north of Minden , though several realignments over the years have led to its current winding route . At Carnarvon , it meets with Highway 118 . Heading northward into increasingly mountainous terrain , the highway crosses into Muskoka near Dorset , and shortly thereafter reaches its terminus at Highway 60 west of Algonquin Park . 
 Traffic volumes on Highway 35 vary considerably over the length of the highway , as well as over the course of the year due to its use for recreational purposes , including snowmobiling , cottaging and camping . Along the Highway 35 and Highway 115 concurrency , the average daily vehicle count is above 20 @,@ 000 . This drops as Highway 35 splits off at Enterprise Hill to under 10 @,@ 000 . This volume is fairly consistent as far north as Minden , at which point the vehicle count drops below 5 @,@ 000 and tapers off as low as 2 @,@ 000 at Highway 60 . 
 = = History = = 
 Highway 35 , like many highways that begin at Lake Ontario and eventually cross into the Canadian Shield , began as several trails connecting settlements . Most of the southern portion of the highway follows various sidelines and concessions . Between Lindsay and Fenelon Falls , Highway 35 follows the former Fenelon Road , while north of there it follows The Cameron Road , a trail carved in the 1850s between Fenelon and Minden . North of Minden , the highway generally follows The Bobcaygeon Road , a colonization road built as far north as Dwight in the 1850s . 
 The Highway 35 designation was first applied in 1931 to the road between Lindsay and Fenelon Falls . In 1934 it was extended along the road between Fenelon Falls and Rosedale , bringing the length of the highway up to 38 @.@ 9 km ( 24 @.@ 2 mi ) . The Department of Northern Development had meanwhile spent the early 1930s upgrading the trails north of the Trent – Severn Canal that fell under their jurisdiction . A new road was constructed north of Dorset as part of the Ontario Northern Highways Program , avoiding the straight Bobcaygeon Road . The entire route from Rosedale to Huntsville became part of Highway 35 on April 1 , 1937 when the Department of Northern Development merged into the Department of Highways , adding 138 @.@ 4 km ( 86 @.@ 0 mi ) to the route . Finally in 1938 , Highway 35 was extended south to Newcastle . 
 At this point , much of the assumed route was a gravel road . Only the section south of Orono was paved . The Lindsay to Norland section was paved in the 1940s , and north of that point beginning in 1954 . It would take until 1958 for paving to commence south of Lindsay . 
 In 1953 , Highway 115 was built as a two lane road eastward from Highway 35 near Pontypool . It was completed to Peterborough by 1954 , and co @-@ designated with Highway 35 southwards in 1961 . Construction began to widen both to four lanes beginning in 1984 , which was completed in the late 1980s and early 1990s . The concurrency with Highway 60 was removed from Highway 35 after 1961 , but before 1969 . 
 Beginning in 1954 , several bypasses were constructed around the towns and villages along the route . The first of these was in Minden , bypassing the old route along the Bobcaygeon Road and South Water Street . This was followed by the bypassing of Fenelon Falls in 1955 . Highway 35 followed present day Kawartha Lakes Road 121 and Kawartha Lakes Road 8 into and out of the village until the Seventh Concession Line was paved and the highway rerouted onto it . In 1956 , Newcastle was bypassed and Highway 35 connected directly to the then eastern terminus of Highway 401 west of the village . The former route is now Durham Regional Road 19 . By 1958 , construction had begun on several bypasses of Lindsay , including the Lindsay Bypass that Highway 7 and 35 follow today . Prior to the opening of the bypass , Highway 35 followed Lindsay Street to Kent Street and jogged northwest along William Street and Colborne Street . It then followed today 's Kawartha Lakes Road 4 north and west to the current intersection with Highway 35 . This routing became Highway 35B when the bypass opened in 1959 . In the 1960s , the route through Pontypool ( now known as John Street ) was bypassed . 
 Prior to 2007 , the highway was extensively rehabilitated between Kawartha Lakes Road 121 , near Fenelon Falls and Highway 118 in Carnarvon . This included widening the highway for a third passing lane , as well as the resurfacing of several sections . 
 On the day before Remembrance Day , 2009 , the section of Highway 35 between Lindsay and Norland was renamed the Midland Regiment Commemorative Highway , in honour of veterans of World War II . Signs are placed along the highway at regular intervals to acknowledge the designation . On April 25 , 2012 , four bridges along the highway were renamed in memory of police officers killed in the line of duty : The Constable Randall F. Skidmore Bridge over the Trent – Severn Waterway in Rosedale ; the Constable Eric <unk> Bridge over the Gull River in Moore Falls ; and the Corporal James Smith Bridge and Detective Sergeant Lorne J. <unk> Bridge between Miners Bay and Minden .

She had to abandon the project when she was cast as Shosanna Dreyfus , a Parisian theater owner whose family was killed by Nazi Colonel Hans Landa ( Christoph Waltz ) , who seizes the opportunity to lure the S.S. into her theater for murderous revenge in the Quentin Tarantino film Inglourious Basterds alongside Brad Pitt , Diane Kruger and Christoph Waltz . It was a French @-@ language role for which she learned to speak English for a few scenes . The film was a huge commercial and critical success , grossing over $ 321 million in theaters worldwide . Laurent 's performance was praised by several critics . Kyle Buchanan of Movieline wrote : " Mélanie Laurent provides Inglourious Basterds its heart and soul . It falls to the 26 @-@ year @-@ old French actress to anchor some of the World War II film 's most challenging scenes as Shosanna . " 
 Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Laurent should have received the nomination at the 16th Screen Actors Guild Awards saying , " In drawing attention to one performer , in particular , whom they left out of the Best Supporting Actress category , [ ... ] I flat @-@ out adore this performance and I suspect that many others do too , " and further lauding Laurent 's performance added , " [ Laurent ] is radiant and , in a unique Tarantino way , heartbreaking . Sexy and luminous in the heat of her valor . Putting out fire – and setting it . It becomes an anthem of noirish dread and excitement , a sign that Laurent , as Shosanna , has found her destiny . " 
 In an interview , Laurent said that she went into Inglourious Basterds with an adoration for Quentin Tarantino . " [ The French ] don 't see him like an independent director ; we just see him as the best director , ever , [ from the United States ] . " About the process of auditioning , Laurent said that she knew right from the start that this was a film she had to be in as she felt a connection to her role in the film , because the history of her Jewish family . 
 In addition , Laurent won a number of accolades for her portrayal of <unk> including Austin Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress and Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Actress , and nominations at the Detroit Film Critics Society Awards , Empire Award for Best Actress , and Saturn Award for Best Actress among others . The highly anticipated film , which had been in development since 1998 , marked Laurent 's first major role in an American film and Laurent found herself pushed into mainstream success in North America . 
 <unk> 's partner Julien Boisselier , as well as Marie <unk> , Mélanie <unk> , and Louise <unk> were to act in the production while short film clips were to be projected on stage , some of them shot at the nightclub Le Baron , which Laurent used to frequent during the writing period . 
 In 2010 , Laurent starred in The Round Up , a French film directed by <unk> Bosch , and produced by Alain Goldman , alongside Jean Reno , Sylvie Testud , and Gad <unk> . Based on the true story of a young Jewish boy , the film depicts the Vel ' d <unk> Roundup , the mass arrest of Jews by French police who were Nazi accomplices in Paris in July 1942 . The film and the Laurent 's performance was well received by the critics , with Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian deeming it " well acted " . John Anderson of Newsday lauded Laurent saying that she gave an " inspiring performance as a gentile nurse " .

 Laurent had also planned another feature film , <unk> de pluie ! , produced by Alain <unk> 's Productions du Trésor , whose script she co @-@ wrote with Morgan Perez and which she intended to direct . Originally set for filming in the spring of 2009 , it was postponed because of her work on Inglourious Basterds . Knowing that she could speak French , and had already acted in French in one of the short films in Paris , je t 'aime , she offered the first role to Natalie Portman , who declined because of the script 's language . 
 Laurent played the part of the violinist in Radu <unk> 's Le Concert — she called it " a smart movie and a popular movie " , and added that she was , " glad because French people wanted to watch a movie with classical music . " Mick LaSalle of San Francisco Chronicle called it a " role with great technical demands " and praising Laurent wrote , " she 's extremely subtle and reserved [ ... ] " The Concert " constitutes a breakthrough for her , in that it unlocks her emotional floodgates " . 
 Laurent hosted both the opening and closing ceremonies of the 64th Cannes Film Festival . In 2011 , she teamed with Mike Mills , appearing opposite Ewan McGregor and Christopher Plummer in Beginners , a comedy drama that marked Laurent 's second English @-@ speaking role in Hollywood . Laurent plays Anna , an irreverent French actress . Loosely based on Mills ’ own life , the film depicts the story of a father coming out of the closet at the age of 75 after the death of his wife of 45 years . The film opened to critical acclaim and Laurent 's performance was well received , with Calvin Wilson of St. Louis Post @-@ Dispatch remarking that Laurent imbued a " soulful charisma " into the role . 
 Laurent made her singing debut in May 2011 with a studio album En t <unk> , under the label of <unk> . Produced by Joel Shearer , the album contains twelve songs , five of which are co @-@ written and co @-@ produced by Irish folk musician Damien Rice . The album peaked at number 22 and number 35 on the Belgian Albums Charts and French Albums Charts respectively . She recorded the album with Rice , living between Woodstock , New York and his home in Ireland . In an interview , Laurent revealed that spending time at Rice 's home in Ireland inspired her to maintain a compost heap and eat organic food . 
 Laurent then starred opposite Jeremy Irons in Night Train to Lisbon , a 2013 drama film based on the novel of the same name directed by Bille August . Jessica Kiang of Indie Wire noted that Laurent was " given less to do " but lauded her performance writing that she , " makes the most of her truncated screen time " . 
 Laurent appeared in the Louis Leterrier 's 2013 caper film Now You See Me as a French Interpol agent who investigates the bank theft alongside Mark Ruffalo and an ensemble cast . The film was a major commercial success grossing over 351 @.@ 7 million dollars , receiving mixed reviews but praise for the performances of the entire cast . Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave Laurent the highest praise and wrote , " [ Laurent ] is responsible for the only measurable amount of warmth the film exudes . " 
 Laurent 's next release , the Canadian @-@ Spanish psychological thriller film Enemy , directed by Denis Villeneuve , was screened at the Special Presentation section at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival . Loosely adapted by Javier <unk> from José Saramago 's 2002 novel The Double , the film opened to critical acclaim . The film starred Jake Gyllenhaal as two men who are physically identical , but different in terms of personality . Laurent and Sarah <unk> co @-@ star as the romantic partners of the men . 
 In 2014 , Laurent appeared in <unk> , a 2014 drama film written and directed by Claudia Llosa , alongside Jennifer Connelly and Cillian Murphy . The film premiered in competition at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival . Laurent voiced Mary Katherine in Blue Sky Studios ' Epic , and Disgust in Pixar 's Inside Out in the French dubs of the animated films . 
 In 2015 , Laurent starred alongside Laurent Lafitte , in François <unk> 's French drama film <unk> adapted from the bestseller entitled A Secret Kept by Tatiana De <unk> . The film released on 23 September 2013 to positive critical reviews . The Hollywood Reporter wrote , " Boomerang is a solid if somewhat conventionally made whodunit that benefits from a strong cast and a plot that hooks you for most of the running time . " Laurent then starred as Léa in Angelina Jolie 's By the Sea , an American drama film , written and directed by Jolie . The film also stars Jolie and Brad Pitt , and was released on 13 November 2015 , by Universal Pictures .

 Laurent was in a long @-@ term relationship with fellow French actor Julien Boisselier which ended in 2009 . In March 2013 , she revealed that she had married but refused to name her spouse . She told The Independent , " he was a crew member and I was an actress . " Her first child with her husband , a son named Léo , was born in September 2013 . Laurent described recording artist Damien Rice and <unk> Quentin Tarantino as two " masters " in terms of their art . 
 The men 's web portal AskMen ascribed Laurent 's sex appeal to her " pixie @-@ like charm and big , expressive eyes " and added that she " radiates a natural , understated magnetism on screen " . She has established herself as a major young talent in French cinema . In a 2009 interview , Laurent explained that she does not have ambitions to be a crossover actress . She stated that she loved France , her street , her café , and not having to use a car . Rather than go on to work on a big budget American film after Inglourious Basterds , her next role was in a small theater piece in France . 
 Laurent has written and directed several French films and in an interview with Indiewire admitted she loves writing : " [ Writing is ] especially super exciting because you have everything to do and most of your ideas come from that first part … you just imagine things , and you imagine actors . " She described the shooting process as " the fun part " because of : " working with people I love — it ’ s always a great human moment because we ’ re sharing things and it ’ s good to see people who are here for you and your story , to tell your story . It ’ s really beautiful , it ’ s why I love making movies . " 
 Laurent has visited a Climate Defenders Camp in the peatlands of the Indonesian Rainforest with Greenpeace activists . She is one of the Climate Ambassadors for Kofi Annan 's Global Humanitarian Forum " Tck Tck Tck " Campaign . Laurent has also joined the campaign against overfishing at the invitation of the Blue Marine Foundation , and was cast for the voice @-@ over of the documentary The End of the Line . She was one of the leading celebrities in the successful campaign Fish Fight France , which asked for a new European law lowering the level of fish discards in European seas .

 Sir Marcus " Mark " Laurence Elwin Oliphant , AC , KBE , FRS , FAA ( 8 October 1901 – 14 July 2000 ) was an Australian physicist and humanitarian who played an important role in the first experimental demonstration of nuclear fusion and also the development of nuclear weapons . 
 Born and raised in Adelaide , South Australia , Oliphant graduated from the University of Adelaide in 1922 . He was awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship in 1927 on the strength of the research he had done on mercury , and went to England , where he studied under Sir Ernest Rutherford at the University of Cambridge 's Cavendish Laboratory . There , he used a particle accelerator to fire heavy hydrogen nuclei ( deuterons ) at various targets . He discovered the nuclei of helium @-@ 3 ( helions ) and tritium ( tritons ) . He also discovered that when they reacted with each other , the particles that were released had far more energy than they started with . Energy had been liberated from inside the nucleus , and he realised that this was a result of nuclear fusion . 
 Oliphant left the Cavendish Laboratory in 1937 to become the Poynting Professor of Physics at the University of Birmingham . He attempted to build a 60 @-@ inch ( 150 cm ) cyclotron at the university , but its completion was postponed by the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe in 1939 . He became involved with the development of radar , heading a group at the University of Birmingham that included John Randall and Harry Boot . They created a radical new design , the cavity magnetron , that made microwave radar possible . Oliphant also formed part of the MAUD Committee , which reported in July 1941 , that an atomic bomb was not only feasible , but might be produced as early as 1943 . Oliphant was instrumental in spreading the word of this finding in the United States , thereby starting what became the Manhattan Project . Later in the war , he worked on it with his friend Ernest Lawrence at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley , California , developing electromagnetic isotope separation . 
 After the war , Oliphant returned to Australia as the first Director of the Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering at the new Australian National University , where he initiated the design and construction of the world 's largest ( 500 megajoule ) homopolar generator . He retired in 1976 , but was appointed Governor of South Australia on the advice of Premier , Don Dunstan . He assisted in the founding of the Australian Democrats political party , and he was the chairman of the meeting in Melbourne in 1977 at which the party was launched . Late in life he watched his wife , Rosa , suffer before her death in 1987 , and he became an advocate for voluntary euthanasia . He died in Canberra in 2000 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Marcus " Mark " Laurence Elwin Oliphant was born on 8 October 1901 in Kent Town , a suburb of Adelaide . His father was Harold George " Baron " Oliphant , a civil servant with the South Australian Engineering and Water Supply Department and part @-@ time lecturer in Economics with the Workers ' Educational Association . His mother was Beatrice Edith Fanny Oliphant , née Tucker , an artist . He was named after Marcus Clarke , the Australian author , and Laurence Oliphant , the British traveller and mystic . Most people called him Mark ; this became official when he was knighted in 1959 . He had four younger brothers , Roland , Keith , Nigel and Donald . His parents were theosophists , and as such were opposed to eating meat . Marcus became a lifelong vegetarian while a boy , after witnessing the slaughter of pigs on a farm . He was found to be completely deaf in one ear and he needed glasses for severe astigmatism and short @-@ sightedness . 
 Oliphant was first educated at primary schools in Goodwood and <unk> , after the family moved there in 1910 . He attended Unley High School in Adelaide , and , for his final year in 1918 , Adelaide High School . After graduation he failed to obtain a bursary to attend university , and so got a job cleaning floors for a jewellery manufacturer . He then got a cadetship with the State Library of South Australia , which allowed him to take courses at the University of Adelaide at night . 
 In 1919 , Oliphant began studying at the University of Adelaide . At first he was interested in a career in medicine , but later in the year Kerr Grant , the physics professor , offered him a cadetship in the Physics Department . It paid 10 shillings a week ( equivalent to AUD $ 34 in 2010 ) , the same amount that Oliphant received for working at the State Library , but it allowed him to take any university course that did not conflict with his work for the department . He received his Bachelor of Science ( BSc ) degree in 1921 and then did honours the following year , supervised by Kerr Grant . Roy Burdon , who acted as head of the department when Kerr went on sabbatical in 1925 , worked with Oliphant to produce two papers in 1927 on the properties of mercury , " The Problem of the Surface Tension of Mercury and the Action of Aqueous Solutions on a Mercury Surface " and " Absorption of Gases on the Surface of Mercury " . Oliphant later recalled that Burdon taught him " the extraordinary exhilaration there was in even minor discoveries in the field of physics " . 
 Oliphant married Rosa Louise Wilbraham , who was also from Adelaide , on 23 May 1925 . The two had known each other since they were teenagers . He made Rosa 's wedding ring in the laboratory from a gold nugget ( from the Coolgardie Goldfields ) that his father had given him . 
 = = Cavendish Laboratory = = 
 In 1925 , Oliphant heard a speech given by the New Zealand physicist , Sir Ernest Rutherford , and he decided he wanted to work for him – an ambition that he fulfilled by earning a position at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in 1927 . He applied for an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship on the strength of the research he had done on mercury with Burdon . It came with a living allowance of £ 250 per annum ( equivalent to AUD $ 17 @,@ 000 in 2010 ) . When word came through that he had been awarded a fellowship , he wired Rutherford and Trinity College , Cambridge . Both accepted him . 
 Rutherford 's Cavendish Laboratory was carrying out some of the most advanced research into nuclear physics in the world at the time . Oliphant was invited to afternoon tea by Rutherford and Lady Rutherford . He soon got to meet other researchers at the Cavendish Laboratory , including Patrick Blackett , Edward Bullard , James Chadwick , John Cockcroft , Charles Ellis , Peter Kapitza , Philip Moon and Ernest Walton . There were two fellow Australians : Harrie Massey and John Keith Roberts . Oliphant would become especially close friends with Cockcroft . The laboratory had considerable talent but not a lot of money to spare , and tended to use a " string and sealing wax " approach to experimental equipment . Oliphant had to buy his own equipment , at one point spending £ 24 ( equivalent to AUD $ 800 in 2010 ) of his allowance on a vacuum pump . 
 Oliphant submitted his PhD thesis on " The Neutralization of Positive Ions at Metal Surfaces , and the Emission of Secondary Electrons " in December 1929 . For his viva , he was examined by Rutherford and Ellis . Receiving his degree was the attainment of a major life goal , but it also meant the end of his 1851 Exhibition Scholarship . Oliphant secured an 1851 Senior Studentship , of which there were five awarded each year . It came with a living allowance of £ 450 per annum ( equivalent to A $ 30 @,@ 000 in 2010 ) for two years , with the possibility of a one @-@ year extension in exceptional circumstances , which Oliphant was also awarded . 
 A son , Geoffrey Bruce Oliphant , was born 6 October 1930 , but he died of meningitis on 5 September 1933 , and was interred in an unmarked grave in the Ascension Parish Burial Ground in Cambridge alongside Timothy Cockcroft , the infant son of Sir John and Lady Elizabeth Cockcroft , who had died the year before . Unable to have more children , the <unk> adopted a four @-@ month @-@ old boy , Michael John , in 1936 , and a daughter , Vivian , in 1938 . 
 In 1932 and 1933 , the scientists at the Cavendish Laboratory made a series of ground @-@ breaking discoveries . Cockroft and Walton bombarded lithium with high energy protons and succeeded in transmuting it into energetic nuclei of helium . This was one of the earliest experiments to change the atomic nucleus of one element to another by artificial means . Then Chadwick devised an experiment that discovered a new , uncharged particle with roughly the same mass as the proton : the neutron . In 1933 , Blackett discovered tracks in his cloud chamber that confirmed the existence of the positron and revealed the opposing spiral traces of positron – electron pair production . 
 Oliphant followed up the work by constructing a particle accelerator that could fire protons with up to 600 @,@ 000 electronvolts of energy . He soon confirmed the results of Cockroft and Walton on the artificial disintegration of the nucleus and positive ions . He produced a series of six papers over the following two years . In 1933 , the Cavendish Laboratory received a gift from the American physical chemist Gilbert N. Lewis of a few drops of heavy water . The accelerator was used to fire heavy hydrogen nuclei ( deuterons , which Rutherford called <unk> ) at various targets . Working with Rutherford and others , Oliphant thereby discovered the nuclei of Helium @-@ 3 ( helions ) and tritium ( tritons ) . 
 Oliphant used electromagnetic separation to separate the isotopes of lithium . He was the first to experimentally demonstrate nuclear fusion . He found that when deuterons reacted with nuclei of Helium @-@ 3 , tritium or with other deuterons , the particles that were released had far more energy than they started with . Binding energy had been liberated from inside the nucleus . Following Arthur Eddington 's 1920 prediction that energy released by fusing small nuclei together could provide the energy source that powers the stars , Oliphant speculated that nuclear fusion reactions might be what powered the sun . With its higher cross section , the deuterium – tritium nuclear fusion reaction became the basis of a hydrogen bomb . Oliphant had not foreseen this development : 
 ... we had no idea whatever that this would one day be applied to make hydrogen bombs . Our curiosity was just curiosity about the structure of the nucleus of the atom , and the discovery of these reactions was purely , as the Americans would put it , coincidental . 
 In 1934 , Cockcroft arranged for Oliphant become a fellow of St John 's College , Cambridge , which paid about £ 600 . When Chadwick left the Cavendish Laboratory for the University of Liverpool in 1935 , Oliphant and Ellis both replaced him as Rutherford 's Assistant Director for Research . The job came with a salary of £ 600 ( equivalent to AUD $ 49 @,@ 900 in 2010 ) . With the money from St John 's , this gave him a comfortable income . Oliphant soon fitted out a new accelerator laboratory with a 1 @.@ 23 MeV generator at a cost of £ 6 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to AUD $ 499 @,@ 000 in 2010 ) while he designed an even larger 2 MeV generator . He was the first to conceive of the proton synchrotron , a new type of cyclic particle accelerator . In 1937 , he was elected to the Royal Society . When he died he was its longest @-@ serving fellow . 
 = = University of Birmingham = = 
 Samuel Walter Johnson Smith 's imminent mandatory retirement at age 65 prompted a search for a new Poynting Professor of Physics at the University of Birmingham . The University wanted not just a replacement , but a well @-@ known name , and was willing to spend lavishly in order to build up nuclear physics expertise at Birmingham . Neville Moss , its Professor of Mining Engineering and the Dean of its Faculty of Science approached Oliphant , who presented his terms . In addition to his salary of £ 1 @,@ 300 ( equivalent to AUD $ 103 @,@ 000 in 2010 ) , he wanted the University to spend £ 2 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to A $ 158 @,@ 000 in 2010 ) to upgrade the laboratory , and another £ 1 @,@ 000 per annum ( equivalent to A $ 79 @,@ 000 in 2010 ) on it . And he did not wish to start until October 1937 , to enable him to wrap up his work at the Cavendish Laboratory . Moss agreed to Oliphant 's terms . 
 To obtain funding for the 60 @-@ inch ( 150 cm ) cyclotron that he wanted , Oliphant wrote to the prime minister , Neville Chamberlain , who was from Birmingham . Chamberlain took up the matter with his friend Lord Nuffield , who provided £ 60 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to AUD $ 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in 2010 ) for the project , enough for the cyclotron , a brand new building to house it , and a trip to Berkeley , California , so Oliphant could confer with Ernest Lawrence , the inventor of the cyclotron . Lawrence was supportive of the project , sending Oliphant the plans of the 60 @-@ inch cyclotron that he had under construction at Berkeley , and inviting Oliphant to visit him at the Radiation Laboratory . Oliphant sailed for New York on 10 December 1938 , and met Lawrence in Berkeley . The two men got along very well , dining at Trader Vic 's in Oakland . Oliphant was aware of the problems in building cyclotrons encountered by Chadwick at the University of Liverpool and Cockcroft at the Cavendish Laboratory , and intended to avoid these and get his cyclotron built on time and on budget by following Lawrence 's specifications as closely as possible . He hoped that it would be running by Christmas 1939 , but the outbreak of the Second World War quashed his hopes . The Nuffield Cyclotron would not be completed until after the war . 
 = = = Radar = = = 
 In 1938 , Oliphant became involved with the development of radar , then still a secret . While visiting prototype radar stations , he realised that shorter @-@ wavelength radio waves were needed urgently , especially if there was to be any chance of building a radar set small enough to fit into an aircraft . In August 1939 , he took a small group to Ventnor , on the Isle of Wight , to examine the Chain Home system first hand . He obtained a grant from the Admiralty to develop radar systems with wavelengths less than 10 centimetres ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) ; the best available at the time was 150 centimetres ( 59 in ) . 
 Oliphant 's group at Birmingham worked on developing two promising devices , the klystron and the magnetron . Working with James Sayers , Oliphant managed to produce an improved version of the klystron capable of generating 400W . Meanwhile , two more members of his Birmingham team , John Randall and Harry Boot , worked on a radical new design , a cavity magnetron . By February 1940 , they had an output of 400W with a wavelength of 9 @.@ 8 centimetres ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) , just the kind of short wavelengths needed for good airborne radars . The magnetron 's power was soon increased a hundred @-@ fold , and Birmingham concentrated on magnetron development . The first operational magnetrons were delivered in August 1941 . This invention was one of the key scientific breakthroughs during the war and played a major part in defeating the German U @-@ boats , intercepting enemy bombers , and in directing Allied bombers . 
 In 1940 , the Fall of France , and the possibility that Britain might be invaded , prompted Oliphant to send his wife and children to Australia . The Fall of Singapore in February 1942 led him to offer his services to John Madsen , the Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Sydney , and the head of the Radiophysics Laboratory at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research , which was responsible for developing radar . He embarked from Glasgow for Australia on <unk> Dominion Monarch on 20 March . The voyage , part of a 46 @-@ ship convoy , was a slow one , with the convoy frequently zigzagging to avoid U @-@ boats , and the ship did not reach Fremantle until 27 May . 
 The Australians were already preparing to produce radar sets locally . Oliphant persuaded Professor Thomas Laby to release Eric Burhop and Leslie Martin from their work on optical munitions to work on radar , and they succeeded in building a cavity magnetron in their laboratory at the University of Melbourne in May 1942 . Oliphant worked with Martin on the process of moving the magnetrons for the laboratory to the production line . Over 2 @,@ 000 radar sets were produced in Australia during the war .

 At the University of Birmingham in March 1940 , Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls examined the theoretical issues involved in developing , producing and using atomic bombs in a paper that became known as the Frisch – Peierls memorandum . They considered what would happen to a sphere of pure uranium @-@ 235 , and found that not only could a chain reaction occur , but it might require as little as 1 kilogram ( 2 @.@ 2 lb ) of uranium @-@ 235 to unleash the energy of hundreds of tons of TNT . The first person they showed their paper to was Oliphant , and he immediately took it to Sir Henry Tizard , the chairman of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Warfare ( CSSAW ) . As a result , a special subcommittee of the CSSAW known as the MAUD Committee was created to investigate the matter further . It was chaired by Sir George Thomson , and its original membership included Oliphant , Chadwick , Cockcroft and Moon . In its final report in July 1941 , the MAUD Committee concluded that an atomic bomb was not only feasible , but might be produced as early as 1943 . 
 Great Britain was at war and authorities there thought that the development of an atomic bomb was urgent , but there was much less urgency in the United States . Oliphant was one of the people who pushed the American program into motion . Oliphant flew to the United States in late August 1941 in an unheated bomber , ostensibly to discuss the radar @-@ development program , but was assigned to find out why the United States was ignoring the findings of the MAUD Committee . He later recalled : " the minutes and reports had been sent to Lyman Briggs , who was the Director of the Uranium Committee , and we were puzzled to receive virtually no comment . I called on Briggs in Washington [ DC ] , only to find out that this inarticulate and unimpressive man had put the reports in his safe and had not shown them to members of his committee . I was amazed and distressed . " 
 Oliphant then met with the Uranium Committee . Samuel K. Allison , a new member of the Committee , was a talented experimental physicist and a protégé of Arthur Compton at the University of Chicago . Oliphant " came to a meeting " , Allison recalls , " and said ' bomb ' in no uncertain terms . He told us we must concentrate every effort on the bomb , and said we had no right to work on power plants or anything but the bomb . The bomb would cost 25 million dollars , he said , and Britain did not have the money or the manpower , so it was up to us . " Allison was surprised that Briggs had kept the committee in the dark . Oliphant visited his friend Ernest Lawrence , and also spoke with James Conant and Enrico Fermi . He not only managed to convince the Americans that an atomic bomb was feasible , but also inspired Lawrence to convert his 37 @-@ inch ( 94 cm ) cyclotron into a giant mass spectrometer for isotope separation , a technique Oliphant had pioneered in 1934 . Leo Szilard later wrote , " if Congress knew the true history of the atomic energy project , I have no doubt but that it would create a special medal to be given to meddling foreigners for distinguished services , and that Dr Oliphant would be the first to receive one . " 
 On 26 October 1942 , Oliphant embarked from Melbourne , taking Rosa and the children back with him . The wartime sea voyage on the French Desirade was again a slow one , and they did not reach Glasgow until 29 February 1943 . But he had to leave them behind once more in November 1943 after he joined the Manhattan Project in the United States as part of the British Mission . Oliphant was one of the scientists whose services the Americans were most eager to secure , and Robert Oppenheimer , the head of the Los Alamos Laboratory attempted to persuade Oliphant to join . The work on the bomb itself made him uneasy , and he preferred to head the team assisting his friend Lawrence at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley to develop the electromagnetic uranium enrichment – a vital but less overtly military part of the project . 
 Oliphant secured the services of fellow Australian physicist Harrie Massey , who had been working for the Admiralty on magnetic mines , along with James Stayers and Stanley Duke , who had worked with him on the cavity magnetron . This initial group set out for Berkeley in a B @-@ 24 Liberator bomber in November 1943 . Oliphant became Lawrence 's de facto deputy , and was in charge of the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory when Lawrence was absent . Although based in Berkeley , he often visited Oak Ridge , Tennessee , where the separation plant was , and was an occasional visitor to Los Alamos . He made efforts to involve Australian scientists in the project , and had Sir David Rivett , the head of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research , release Eric Burhop to work on the Manhattan Project . He briefed Stanley Bruce , the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom , on the project , and urged the Australian government to secure Australian uranium deposits . 
 Oliphant returned to England in March 1945 , and resumed his post as a professor of physics at the University of Birmingham . He was on holiday in Wales with his family when he first heard of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . He was later to remark that he felt " sort of proud that the bomb had worked , and absolutely appalled at what it had done to human beings " . Oliphant became a harsh critic of nuclear weapons and a member of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs , saying , " I , right from the beginning , have been terribly worried by the existence of nuclear weapons and very much against their use . " His wartime work would have earned him a Presidential Medal of Freedom with Gold Palm , but the Australian government vetoed this honour , as government policy at the time was not to confer honours on civilians . 
 = = Later years in Australia = = 
 In April 1946 , the Prime Minister , Ben Chifley , asked Oliphant if he would be a technical advisor to the Australian delegation to the newly formed United Nations Atomic Energy Commission ( UNAEC ) , which was debating international control of nuclear weapons . Oliphant agreed , and joined the Minister for External Affairs , H. V. Evatt and the Australian Representative at the United Nations , Paul Hasluck , to hear the Baruch Plan . The attempt at international control was unsuccessful , and no agreement was reached . 
 Chifley , and the Minister for Post @-@ War Reconstruction , Dr H. C. " Nugget " Coombs , also discussed with Oliphant a plan to create a new research institute that would attract the world 's best scholars to Australia and lift the standard of university education nationwide . They hoped to start by attracting three of Australia 's most distinguished expatriates : Oliphant , Howard Florey and Keith Hancock . 
 It was academic suicide ; Australia was far from the centres where the latest research was being carried out , and communications were much poorer at that time . But Oliphant accepted , and in 1950 returned to Australia as the first Director of the Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering at the Australian National University . Within the school he created a Department of Particle Physics , which he headed himself , a Department of Nuclear Physics under Ernest Titterton , a Department of Geophysics under John Jaeger , a Department of Astronomy under Bart Bok , a Department of Theoretical Physics under Kevin <unk> and a Department of Mathematics under Bernhard Neumann . 
 Oliphant was an advocate of nuclear weapons research . He served on the post @-@ war Technical Committee that advised the British government on nuclear weapons , and publicly declared that Britain needed to develop its own nuclear weapons independent of the United States to " avoid the danger of becoming a lesser power " . The establishment of a world @-@ class nuclear physics research capability in Australia was intimately linked with the government 's plans to develop nuclear power and weapons . Locating the new research institute in Canberra would place it close to the Snowy Mountains Scheme , which was planned to be the centrepiece of a new nuclear power industry . Oliphant hoped that Britain would assist with the Australian program , and the British were interested in cooperation because Australia had uranium ore and weapons testing sites , and there were concerns that Australia was becoming too closely aligned with the United States . Arrangements were made for Australian scientists to be seconded to the British Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell , but the close cooperation he sought was stymied by security concerns arising from Britain 's commitments to the United States . 
 Oliphant envisaged Canberra one day becoming a university town like Oxford or Cambridge . A threat to the future of the University arose in the wake of the 1949 election , when the Liberal Party of Australia led by Robert Menzies won . Many Liberals were opposed to the University , which they saw as an extravagance . Menzies defended it , but in 1954 he announced that it had entered a period of consolidation , with a funding ceiling , ending the possibility of successful competition with universities in Europe and North America . A further blow came in 1959 , when the Menzies government amalgamated it with the Canberra University College . Henceforth , it would no longer be a research university , but a regular one , with responsibility for teaching undergraduates . Nonetheless , parts of the university stayed committed to the old mission , and the ANU remained a university where research is central to its activities . Despite the setbacks , by 2014 the vision of Canberra as a university town would be well on its way to becoming a reality . 
 In September 1951 , Oliphant applied for a visa to travel to the United States for a nuclear physics conference in Chicago . The visa was not refused , nor was Oliphant accused of subversive activities , but neither was it issued . This was the height of the Red Scare . The American McCarran Act restricted travel to the United States , and in Australia the Menzies government was attempting to ban the Communist Party , and was not inclined to support Oliphant against the American government . A subsequent request to travel to Canada via Hawaii in September 1954 was refused by the United States Department of State . Although Oliphant was granted a special waiver that allowed him to transit the US , he preferred to cancel the trip rather than accept this humiliation . The Menzies government subsequently excluded him from participating in or observing the British nuclear tests at Maralinga , nor was he allowed access to classified nuclear information for fear of antagonising the US . 
 In 1955 , Oliphant initiated the design and construction of a 500 megajoule homopolar generator ( HPG ) , the world 's largest . This massive machine contained three discs 3 @.@ 5 metres ( 11 ft ) in diameter and weighing 38 tonnes ( 37 long tons ) . He obtained £ 40 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to A $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in 2010 ) initial funding from the Australian Atomic Energy Commission . Completed in 1963 , the HPG was intended to be the power source for a synchrotron , but this was not built . Instead , it was used to power the LT @-@ 4 <unk> and a large @-@ scale railgun that was used as a scientific instrument for experiments with plasma physics . It was decommissioned in 1985 . 
 Oliphant founded the Australian Academy of Science in 1954 , teaming up with David Martyn to overcome the obstacles that had frustrated previous attempts . Oliphant was its president until 1956 . Deciding that the Academy of Science should have its own special building , Oliphant raised the required money from donations . As chairman of the Building Design Committee , he selected and oversaw the construction of one of Canberra 's most striking architectural designs . He also delivered the Academy of Science 's 1961 Matthew Flinders Lecture , on the subject of " Faraday in his time and today " . 
 Oliphant retired as Professor of Particle Physics in 1964 , and was appointed Professor of Ionised Gases . In this chair he produced his first research papers since the 1930s . He was appointed Professor Emeritus in 1967 . He was invited by the premier , Don Dunstan , to become the Governor of South Australia , a position he held from 1971 to 1976 . During this period , he caused great concern to Dunstan when he strongly supported the decision of the Governor @-@ General , Sir John Kerr , in the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis . 
 The Age reported in 1981 that " Sir Mark Oliphant warned the Dunstan Government of the ' grave dangers ' of appointing an Australian Aborigine , Sir Douglas Nicholls , to succeed him as South Australia 's Governor " . Oliphant had secretly written , " [ t ] here is something inherent in the personality of the Aborigine which makes it difficult for him to adapt fully to the ways of the white man . " The authors of Oliphant 's biography noted that " that was the prevailing attitude of almost the entire white population of Australia until well after World War II " . 
 Oliphant was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( KBE ) in 1959 , and was made a Companion of the Order of Australia ( AC ) in 1977 " for eminent achievement and merit of the highest degree in the field of public service and in service to the crown " . 
 Late in life he watched his wife , Rosa , suffer before her death in 1987 , and he became an advocate for voluntary euthanasia . On 14 July 2000 , he died in Canberra , at the age of 98 . His body was cremated . He was survived by his daughter Vivian , his son Michael having died from colon cancer in 1971 .

 Clifford " Cliff " Compton ( born November 2 , 1979 ) is an American professional wrestler signed to Global Force Wrestling , better known by his ring name Domino . Best known for his work in World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) , he works for Ring of Honor ( ROH ) as a free agent , while also working on the independent circuit . 
 Before being promoted to the main WWE roster , Compton was assigned to WWE 's developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling ( OVW ) in Louisville , Kentucky in 2005 . While situated at OVW , he wrestled under the name Dice Domino and was placed in tag team competition , alongside Deuce Shade . Together , the pair won the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship on three occasions . It was also during this time that he and Deuce , alongside their manager Cherry , were known as " The Throw @-@ Backs " and later as " The Untouchables " . 
 The team 's name was changed to Deuce ' n Domino for their main roster debut in January 2007 , as part of the SmackDown ! brand . Three months later , Deuce ' n Domino went on to win the WWE Tag Team Championship . The team lost the title in August 2007 . The group disbanded in June 2008 , after a series of losses . After the split , Compton played an enhancement talent on SmackDown ! . Following his release from WWE in August 2008 , he resumed wrestling on the independent circuit .

 Compton began his professional wrestling career after being trained in Larry Sharpe 's Monster Factory . Compton became a regular for World Xtreme Wrestling , where he formed a tag team with Jake Bishop , known as Double Threat . On July 11 , 2003 , the duo won the WXW Tag Team Championship . He also wrestled a dark match for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling .

 On September 26 , 2005 , Compton was defeated by Danny Basham in a dark match prior to WWE Raw and was soon signed by World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) . Upon signing with WWE , Compton was sent to the Ohio Valley Wrestling ( OVW ) developmental territory . After four months at OVW , Compton began working as " Dice Domino " , teaming with Deuce Shade under the management of his storyline sister Cherry Pie , using a 1950s greaser in @-@ ring persona , forming the faction " The Throw @-@ Backs " . 
 During their time together they underwent an image change , including changing the group 's name to " The Untouchables " and dropping Dice , Shade , and Pie from their respective names . On March 19 , the team would become OVW Southern Tag Team Champions after Deuce defeated The Miz in a singles match after Miz 's partner , Chris Cage , left the organization and forced The Miz to defend the title on his own . The Untouchables lost their titles on April 5 , in a three @-@ way match to Roadkill and Kasey James , which also involved Kenny and Mikey of The Spirit Squad . The group soon began a scripted rivalry with the team of CM Punk and Seth Skyfire before later engaging into a long and heated rivalry with Shawn Spears and Cody Runnels , which even saw Cherry leave The Untouchables to side with Spears and Runnels briefly before betraying them . The feud culminated in a street fight between the two teams , with Spears and Runnels winning the match . 
 The Untouchables won the OVW Tag Team Title another two times , as well as the DSW Tag Team Championship once in October 2006 , before being called up to the main WWE roster in January 2007 . 
 = = = = SmackDown ! ( 2007 – 2008 ) = = = = 
 In their first match with WWE , where they debuted on the SmackDown ! brand , the team 's name was changed again , this time to " Deuce ' n Domino " . They debuted on the January 19 , 2007 , episode , where they were placed in a tag team match , in which Deuce ' n Domino won . On the February 2 episode of SmackDown ! , the team defeated the then @-@ WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London and Brian Kendrick in a non @-@ title match . Deuce ' n Domino faced London and Kendrick in a WWE Tag Team Championship match at February 's pay @-@ per @-@ view event , No Way Out . At the event , they lost when Kendrick pinned Deuce via a roll @-@ up . On the April 20 episode of SmackDown ! , they defeated London and Kendrick for the WWE Tag Team Championship when London was , in storyline , injured after missing a moonsault to the outside . Kendrick was left to defend the title by himself , and was pinned after being hit with the West Side Stomp , a finishing move performed by Deuce ' n Domino . Three weeks later , London and Kendrick competed against William Regal and Dave Taylor . Deuce ' n Domino interfered , causing Regal and Taylor to be disqualified . This made both teams number one contenders leading to a triple threat tag team match the following week where Deuce ' n Domino retained the tag title . 
 During a tag team match with Cryme Tyme ( Shad Gaspard and Jayson Paul ) in late June , Domino suffered an injury , which was diagnosed as a broken nose and a possible broken orbital bone socket in his eye . The injury kept him out of the ring for a month . After coming back from his injury , Deuce ' n Domino engaged in short rivalries with Batista and Ric Flair . On the August 31 episode of SmackDown ! , he and Deuce lost their tag team championship to Matt Hardy and the reigning United States Champion Montel Vontavious Porter . During the last few months of 2007 , Deuce ' n Domino had short scripted rivalries with Hardy and MVP , Jimmy Wang Yang and Shannon Moore , Jesse and Festus , and Finlay and Hornswoggle . 
 At the beginning of 2008 , the team suffered a series of losses . At WrestleMania XXIV in March , Deuce and Domino competed as singles competitors in a 24 @-@ man Interpromotional Battle Royal , in which the winner would face then ECW Champion Chavo Guerrero later that night ; however , neither was able to win the match . On the May 23 episode of SmackDown , Deuce ' n Domino parted ways with Cherry ; WWE Diva Maryse would take over as the team 's on @-@ screen manager . 
 On the June 20 , 2008 , episode of SmackDown , following a loss to Jesse and Festus , their second straight loss in two weeks , Deuce and Domino fought after the match , ending with Deuce laying out Domino with the Crack ' em in da Mouth . Deuce then threw his jacket over Domino , dissolving their partnership . The split was then further cemented when Deuce was drafted to the Raw brand as part of the 2008 WWE Supplemental Draft . Following the draft , Domino was predominantly featured as an enhancement talent on SmackDown weekly . 
 Domino 's last television appearance was on the August 1 episode of SmackDown , when he suffered a loss to The Big Show . Compton was then released from his WWE contract on August 8 , 2008 .

 Compton returned to Ohio Valley Wrestling in September 2010 , using the ring name " Mr. Media " Cliff Compton . After a four month undefeated streak , on January 8 , 2011 , Compton defeated then – champion " Low Rider " Matt Barela and Mike Mondo in a three @-@ way match to win the OVW Heavyweight Championship for the first time . Two months later on March 5 , the three faced off for the championship again , this time in a ladder match , which Mondo won . During the match , Compton suffered a broken ankle , torn ligaments , and a strained calf muscle . Compton regained the OVW Heavyweight Championship on May 14 , when he defeated Mondo in a Brass Knuckles on a Pole match for the vacant championship . He lost the title to Elvis <unk> , following interference from Mondo , just eleven days later . On January 25 , Compton 's profile was removed from OVW 's website , signalling his departure from the company . 
 On May 12 , 2012 , Compton returned to OVW in a dark match with Mike Mondo going up against Raphael Constantine and Sean Casey . On May 31 , Compton wrestled a tryout dark match for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ( TNA ) , losing to Crimson . On October 17 , Compton won the OVW Television Championship from Alex Silva .

 = Timothy L. Pflueger = 
 Timothy Ludwig Pflueger ( September 26 , 1892 – November 20 , 1946 ) was a prominent architect , interior designer and architectural lighting designer in the San Francisco Bay Area in the first half of the 20th century . Together with James R. Miller , Pflueger designed some of the leading skyscrapers and movie theaters in San Francisco in the 1920s , and his works featured art by challenging new artists such as Ralph Stackpole and Diego Rivera . Rather than breaking new ground with his designs , Pflueger captured the spirit of the times and refined it , adding a distinct personal flair . His work influenced later architects such as Pietro Belluschi . 
 Pflueger , who started as a working @-@ class draftsman and never went to college , established his imprint on the development of Art Deco in California architecture yet demonstrated facility in many styles including Streamline Moderne , neo @-@ Mayan , Beaux @-@ Arts , Mission Revival , Neoclassical and International . His work as an interior designer resulted in an array of influential interior spaces , including luxurious cocktail lounges such as the Top of the Mark at the Mark Hopkins Hotel , the Patent Leather Bar at the St. Francis Hotel and the Cirque Room at The Fairmont , three of the most successful San Francisco bars in their day . 
 Pflueger 's social and business connections spanned the city , including three private men 's clubs which he joined : the Bohemian Club , the Olympic Club and The Family . He designed buildings and interior architecture for the latter two . Pflueger was highly placed in several important planning organizations : He was the chairman of a committee of consulting architects on the Bay Bridge project and he served on the committee responsible for the design of the Golden Gate International Exposition in 1939 . Pflueger was a board member of the San Francisco Art Association starting in 1930 , and served variously as chair and director . While on the board , Pflueger helped the organization found the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art ( SFMOMA ) . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Pflueger was born the second of seven sons in the Potrero Hill area of San Francisco to German immigrants August Pflueger and <unk> Quandt who had met in Los Angeles and married . Other Quandt relatives lived in the Noe Valley neighborhood , and , in 1904 , the Pflueger family moved closer , to 1015 Guerrero Street in the Mission District , a melting pot neighborhood of blue @-@ collar workers . At age 11 , Pflueger took his first job working for a picture @-@ framing firm near his home . 
 After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake , Pflueger continued his grade @-@ school education , graduating at age 13 in a mass ceremony held in Golden Gate Park for all the city 's devastated public schools . By 1907 , Pflueger was working as a draftsman and soon joined the architectural firm Miller and Colmesnil , under the guidance of James Rupert Miller , senior partner . Young Pflueger sketched ornamental details based on ideas from his bosses , and attended Mission High Evening School to further his education . In 1911 , Pflueger joined the San Francisco Architectural Club ( SFAC ) , an organization that helped budding architects receive training in the informal Atelier Method where older experts taught the practical side of architecture including waterproofing , lighting and structural concerns to students who had no hope or wish to study Beaux @-@ Arts in an established school abroad . Pflueger became thoroughly involved with SFAC 's collegial activities and was chosen director in 1914 . 
 = = Early career = = 
 In 1912 , while Miller and Colmesnil were busy with their entry in the competition to redesign San Francisco City Hall as well as with the design of many new hotels , apartments and private homes , Timothy L. Pflueger was given the opportunity to serve as chief architect on a rural church project funded by The Family , a club to which Miller belonged . Pflueger designed Our Lady of the Wayside Church with a main theme of Spanish Mission Revival based on his childhood familiarity with Mission San Francisco de Asís ( locally known as Mission Dolores ) but added his own personal statement : a striking Georgian main entrance topped by a scrolled pediment . After working with sub @-@ contractor members of The Family on the project , Pflueger joined the club himself . The rural church was declared California Historical Landmark number 909 in 1977 . 
 Colmesnil left the firm some time around 1913 , leaving Miller to conduct business as " J. R. Miller " . Subsequently , Pflueger was assigned by Miller to work closely with the firm 's major client , Metropolitan Life Insurance Company , who engaged in a succession of expansion projects at their San Francisco location at 600 Stockton Street . The first expansion , completed in 1914 , gave the building a roof garden , dining room , kitchen and <unk> . 
 Pflueger volunteered for World War I in 1917 , working for the Quartermaster Corps to design base facilities . He was first stationed in Washington , D.C. and then sent to San Juan , Puerto Rico to take part in base expansion there . Returning to San Francisco in 1919 , Pflueger once again focused on the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company , who now wished for a further doubling in size , extending their Stockton Street frontage 140 feet to California Street , and adding a seventh floor . A massive new entrance incorporating 17 Ionic columns was erected , topped by a pediment displaying a tableau carved by Armenian sculptor Haig <unk> . The Neoclassic @-@ style project was completed in 1920 . In 1984 , the building was designated San Francisco Landmark No. 167 . 
 = = 1920s = = 
 In June 1920 , Pflueger passed his architecture licensing exams to become a certified California architect . He was elected president of the SFAC later that year , taking office in early 1921 . 
 J. R. Miller , relying more and more on Pflueger 's hard @-@ working energy , social conviviality and artistic talent , gave him a wide variety of assignments including designs for an automobile showroom , a firehouse and a number of private homes . Pflueger extended his proposed styles to include Aztec elements and Spanish Colonial Revival themes , the latter favored by several clients for their homes . 
 Miller made Pflueger his junior partner following their completion of the US $ 80 @,@ 000 San Francisco Stock Exchange building at 350 Bush Street in 1923 . The firm conducted business as Miller and Pflueger . The building at 350 Bush , a neoclassic design topped with a pediment displaying a sculpture by Jo Mora and later called the San Francisco Mining Exchange , is currently empty ; it was designated San Francisco Landmark No. 113 in 1980 . 
 = = = Skyscrapers = = = 
 Miller and Pflueger were selected in 1923 to build an expansive new headquarters tower for Pacific Telephone & Telegraph . In June 1924 , Pflueger showed his plans for a $ 3 million skyscraper , 26 stories high , designed with continuous vertical elements and a progression of step @-@ backs narrowing the floors near the top . Arthur Frank Mathews was brought in to paint a mural in the boardroom on the 18th floor . The structure was fully devoted to offices for 2 @,@ 000 employees , mostly female . Pflueger 's vision was strongly influenced by Eliel Saarinen 's second @-@ place entry in the competition to design the Tribune Tower in Chicago . In June , 1925 , the Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company Building was completed for $ 4 million ( $ 54 million in current value ) , becoming the tallest building in San Francisco for the next 40 years , tied by the Russ Building in 1927 . 
 450 Sutter Street was completed on October 15 , 1929 , using a primarily unbroken exterior verticality without step @-@ backs , featuring triangular thrust window bays , the whole decorated with stylized Mayan designs impressed on the terra cotta sheathing and inscribed in metals , marble and glass within the luxurious lobby . In 1983 , Pietro Belluschi said that the vertical triangular faceted lines of 450 Sutter formed part of the inspiration for the similarly faceted exterior of 555 California . 
 As the Telephone Building was being completed in 1925 , a group of Methodist Episcopalians came to Pflueger , asking him to design a new skyscraper containing both a church and a hotel for them at 100 McAllister Street . After a dispute , Miller and Pflueger were fired from the project to be replaced by Lewis P. Hobart . Miller and Pflueger sued for $ 81 @,@ 600 , alleging that Hobart 's design was not significantly changed from Pflueger 's original . Three months after the hotel and church opened in January 1930 , Miller and Pflueger won $ 38 @,@ 000 in court , equivalent to $ 538 @,@ 000 today . 
 = = = Artists = = = 
 By the late 1920s , Pflueger was already working with a number of artists such as Haig <unk> , Jo Mora and Arthur Mathews who provided fine detail and craftsmanship to his larger designs . 
 In March 1928 , Pflueger published his submission for a new building to house the San Francisco Stock Exchange , featuring strong Zigzag Moderne themes with classicist notes . Miller and Pflueger won the competition for the commission . Eight months later , the Exchange committee decided instead to rebuild the Sub @-@ treasury building at 301 Pine Street while keeping its Tuscan columns and entrance steps , requiring a completely new approach . Pflueger 's first response was a sketch with little ornamentation . Construction began in December 1928 . By January 1929 , Pflueger 's plans indicated prominent sculptures , bas @-@ reliefs , inscriptions and carvings , to be detailed by local artists . 
 Also in January , Pflueger booked a flight in a small mail plane heading for New York but a winter storm forced the pilot and his two passengers down in the Sierras . The three men waited 36 hours exposed to the cold before being rescued . Pflueger immediately continued his trip and met with his Metropolitan Life Insurance clients regarding a third expansion project . 
 Early in 1929 , Pflueger met Ralph Stackpole , an art professor at California School of Fine Arts and a former student of Mathews , who agreed to sculpt monumental figures for the stock exchange project as well as recommending and supervising other artists . Stackpole wrote later of his experience that " the artists were in from the first . They were called in conference and assumed responsibility and personal pride in the building . " Pflueger hired nine artists to help decorate the neighboring Stock Exchange Tower at 155 Sansome , and instructed them only to keep their themes light and airy . Diego Rivera was brought with some difficulty from Mexico to paint a two @-@ story mural in the stairwell between the 10th and 11th floors of the Stock Exchange Luncheon Club ( now the City Club ) . Stackpole himself worked with a crew of assistants to direct carve heroic figures in stone above the tall 155 Sansome entrance , as well as carving two large sculpture groups flanking the Tuscan columns of 301 Pine Street . 
 = = = Architectural lighting design = = = 
 Over the Stock Exchange floor , Pflueger mounted a ceiling composed of interconnected sheet metal strips above which he used indirect lighting to soften the edges and reduce shadows made by traders on the floor below . The result was so effective that Pflueger used it on a much larger scale above the audience seating at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland , where it extended from and formed a continuity with the incised art on the proscenium . In Oakland , Pflueger flanked the stage with structures that appeared to be pillars supporting the proscenium but were instead layered , curved sheets of thin metal behind which lighting instruments cast light indirectly to give the columns a suffused glow . In 1931 , he used the same concept to frame the stage at the Bal Tabarin ( now Bimbo 's 365 Club ) , and to bring a changing palette of color to the ceiling above the dance floor . Pflueger filed for and , in 1934 , received two architectural lighting design patents , one for his ceiling grid with indirect lighting and one for the thin metal panels hiding lighting instruments . He used the patented ceiling grid once more in the Patent Leather Bar , in 1939 . 
 Metropolitan Life Insurance expanded their 600 Stockton location yet again in 1929 , with Pflueger designing a new wing on the Pine Street side . 
 = = = Movie palaces = = = 
 The three Nasser brothers , William , Elias and George , specifically requested Pflueger in 1920 after they received financing for a grand movie palace on Castro Street . In a hurry to see the 2 @,@ 000 @-@ seat project completed , the Nasser Brothers gave Pflueger a free hand in its design . The Castro Theatre was finished in June 1922 for $ 300 @,@ 000 ( $ 4 @,@ 241 @,@ 000 in today 's dollars ) in a largely Spanish Baroque style which evoked cathedrals in Spain and Mexico . Churrigueresque elements were used sparingly on the facade , and ornate tile detailing was employed in the vestibule , ticket booth and the lobby . A canopy modeled after ancient Roman silk brocade shelters was fashioned of steel lath and plaster and painted with Asian and Buddha figures to overhang the main theater seating area . The whole was an eclectic assemblage of styles . 
 In 1925 , Michael <unk> and William Nasser turned to Pflueger again for a new neighborhood theater design based on the Alhambra in Grenada , Spain . The Alhambra Theatre opened on November 5 , 1926 with a grand facade flanked by twin minarets that glowed red at night . Pflueger 's vision stayed firmly planted in the Moorish Revival style , complete to the iron scrollwork and amber shade redesign of two municipal <unk> standing outside of the theater . Pflueger worked with muralist Arthur Frank Mathews to achieve a rich palette of color most prominently displayed in a geometric floral pattern on the main ceiling . The Alhambra was named San Francisco Landmark No. 217 in 1996 . 
 The <unk> and <unk> contracted with Pflueger in early 1926 to build three large movie theaters in central California cities . They assigned Pflueger the design of the Tulare Theatre ( 1927 ) in Tulare , the Senator Theatre ( 1928 ) in Chico and the State Theatre ( 1928 ) in Oroville . The $ 250 @,@ 000 Tulare Theatre ( now demolished ) featured motifs based on the Ishtar Gate of Babylon . Pflueger included zigzag patterns in the twin @-@ towered facade trimmed in neon accents , and brought Streamline Moderne stylings to the interior via sweeping curves in steel banister railings as well as Mayan touches in the stepped mirrors . The $ 250 @,@ 000 State Theatre appeared Spanish Colonial with its tiled roof and concrete bas @-@ relief exterior , but turned to Streamline Moderne in a 1 @,@ 529 @-@ seat interior that featured chrome railings , plush carpet and indirect lighting . Aztec elements were incorporated in the proscenium design . The $ 300 @,@ 000 Senator Theatre was delayed in construction by the discovery of running water under the foundation , a condition that required channelization and pumps . The movie palace 's eclectic theme was largely Egyptian with Moorish , Asian and Aztec details dominated by a landmark tower topped by a giant faceted amber glass gem lit from within . 
 Back in San Francisco , Pflueger designed the Nasser Brothers ' 1 @,@ 830 @-@ seat El Rey Theatre ( 1931 ) at 1970 Ocean Avenue in pure Moderne style , including a sleek tower topped by an aircraft warning beacon . A mirrored foyer in black and gold held floral and geometric accents , and twin curved stairways to the balcony flanked the foyer . 
 Shortly before the Wall Street Crash of 1929 , investors including William Henry Crocker bought adjoining parcels of land in Oakland for the purpose of erecting a movie palace to rival the nearby Fox Orpheum , intending that Miller and Pflueger build it . One of the largest studio and theater chains in the country , Paramount Publix , showed great interest , but wanted to use their own East Coast architect instead . Pflueger went to New York and convinced Paramount Publix to use his firm by demonstrating that past projects of his had stayed within budget , a concern of increasing importance in the cautious financial climate of early 1930 . 
 For the 3 @,@ 200 @-@ seat design , Pflueger took his inspiration from Green Mansions , a romantic fantasy novel by William Henry Hudson set in the Guyana jungle of Venezuela . Tropical rain forest motifs were used throughout the theater , including climbing vines , waterfalls , parrots and emerald green lighting . As with his other works , Pflueger mixed together sources from around the world , adding images of Greek and Egyptian gods and goddesses as well as Egyptian lotuses to the primarily jungle theme . Plans were complete in November and in December 1930 ground was broken in a ceremony that called for " prosperity celebration " . 
 The grand opening was held December 16 , 1931 with a crowd which extended out to the street . Live action variety performances alternated with film showings . Unfortunately for the theater , the number of tickets sold in the subsequent months was not enough to keep the theater in the black . It closed in June 1932 , reopening in 1933 as only a movie theater , devoid of the extravagant live pieces . 
 Increasingly tough economic times in the early 1930s caused many theater owners to cancel plans for new construction and concentrate on attracting customers to existing theaters . Only one more cinema , the 2 @,@ 168 @-@ seat Alameda Theatre ( 1932 ) in Alameda , California would ever be built by Pflueger . Commissioned by the Nasser Brothers , the eclectic Alameda 's exterior incorporated deeply incised and intricate Moorish Revival rosettes on cream @-@ colored smoothly curved sides on either side of Art Nouveau flowers in bas relief rising between eight vertical Moderne speed lines . The Art Deco interior design used imitation silver and gold leaf for accents and warm colors for a stylized mezzanine mural with a hint of Cubism . In the interest of economy , the Alameda 's floor plan was nearly identical to that of the El Rey Theatre , including twin curved staircases , and some floral and geometric elements were borrowed from the Paramount . 
 = = 1930s = = 
 During the Great Depression , Pflueger continued to win commissions , but because of the straitened financial climate , the most noteworthy examples were no longer prominent downtown skyscrapers . Pflueger designed a handful of unique schools for San Francisco Unified School District , including two elementary schools , a junior high , two high schools and every major building on the first campus ( Ocean campus ) of San Francisco Junior College , an institution that would later expand to become City College of San Francisco . 
 In 1932 , Pflueger renovated the Nasser brother 's New Mission Theater , bringing Art Deco stylings to the lobby in contrast to the Spanish Mission trimmings in the main auditorium . In 1993 , the theater closed . The theater , now designated San Francisco Landmark No. 245 , was purchased by Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas and completely renovated to its original splendor , opening its doors once again to patrons in December 2015 . Pflueger simultaneously worked on the remodeling of the Nasser 's New Fillmore Theater , a sister design similar in many respects . The New Fillmore closed in 1957 and was demolished to make way for an urban redevelopment project . 
 = = = Cocktail lounges = = = 
 During Prohibition , Pflueger designed bars for private clubs such as the Stock Exchange Luncheon Club where members kept their personal bottles in small lockers behind the bar , and two bars for The Family , one at the Family Farm in Woodside and one at the clubhouse in San Francisco . Pflueger created a cocktail bar and nightclub for Frank Martinelli and Tom <unk> in 1931 , the Bal Tabarin , featuring a stage for live music and colorful indirect lighting from above metal fins in the ceiling and behind curved metal strips upstage . When Prohibition ended in December 1933 , Bal Tabarin received an immediate renovation by Pflueger along with a liquor license from the state . Pflueger was then asked to design cocktail lounges for several hotels , completing the Cirque for the Fairmont Hotel in 1935 , adorned with finely painted murals by Esther Bruton , and in 1939 , both the Patent Leather Bar for the St. Francis Hotel and the Top of the Mark for the Mark Hopkins Hotel . The Patent Leather Bar used a metal @-@ finned ceiling much like that which Pflueger had installed above the audience at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland . A padded , serpentine bar snaked through the room 's mirror , chrome and black leather decor . Ansel Adams was retained by C. Templeton Crocker to show off the new cocktail lounge in photographs . 
 = = = Bay Bridge = = = 
 Pflueger was invited by California governor James " Sunny Jim " Rolph to chair the committee of architects who were given nominal oversight of the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge project . Arriving two years into the design phase of the bridge , Pflueger was stymied at every turn by civil engineers citing the inflexible budget in his attempts to bring a more artistic theme to the bridge . A heroic figure of a giant man standing at the central anchorage between the two main suspension spans was suggested and quickly canceled ; all that remains of the proposal is a 14 @-@ inch study modeled by Ralph Stackpole . The committee of architects succeeded mainly in making the suspension bridge towers more streamlined in appearance by getting rid of the civil engineer 's plans for a greater number of horizontal cross members . Pflueger very likely designed the stepped semicircular tunnel entrance and exit portals and , by mounting a campaign of public pressure , prevented the bridge from being painted black , successfully substituting a silvery aluminum @-@ based paint instead . When the bridge was completed , Pflueger designed the Transbay Terminal , the main transit center for the train lines built on the lower deck of the Bay Bridge . 
 = = = Golden Gate International Exposition = = = 
 For the Golden Gate International Exposition of 1939 – 1940 on Treasure Island , Pflueger joined a committee of well @-@ known Beaux @-@ Arts architects and was frustrated in establishing a more modern design scheme , though his own Federal Building amply demonstrated the new direction he espoused . Pflueger 's contributions were among the few buildings at the Exposition that received positive reviews . When the Exposition 's investors failed to turn a profit in 1939 , they decided to extend the fair another year . For the summer of 1940 , Pflueger put together a large exhibit of Art in Action , showing a number of artists on display , engaged in creating works . Alfred Frankenstein of The New York Times visited in June and wrote " Here the visitor is privileged to observe a kind of twenty @-@ ring circus of art ... On the floor , in a series of little ateliers , sculptors , painters , lithographers , <unk> , <unk> , weavers and whatnot are at work under the direct observation of the public . " Pflueger once again brought Diego Rivera to San Francisco , this time to serve as the main attraction at " Art in Action " . Rivera painted Pan American Unity on ten steel @-@ framed panels spanning 74 feet in width and reaching 22 feet in height . For the second time , Rivera included Pflueger in a mural of his . Some 68 artists had participated by the end of September when the Exposition was closed . Rivera was not finished , however ; he and two assistants labored for two more months in the empty exposition hall . On November 30 and December 2 , 30 @,@ 000 – 35 @,@ 000 visitors came to Treasure Island to view the completed mural . On December 8 , 1940 , Rivera 's 54th birthday , Kahlo and Rivera were married for the second time in a civil ceremony at San Francisco City Hall . 
 = = 1940s = = 
 In 1938 , Pflueger sailed to Paris with Grover Magnin , head of the I. Magnin department store chain , aboard RMS Queen Mary . The two men investigated French shopping ideas that could be brought back and used at American department stores . Pflueger gained ideas from the ship 's famous Art Deco adornments . Magnin and Pflueger went to Venice and Milan as well , but found very little of use to them on their short European trip . The $ 3 million I. Magnin store on Wilshire ( currently the Wilshire Galleria ) opened in Los Angeles on February 10 , 1939 with an interior completely devoted to Pflueger 's concept of luxuriously separate boutique spaces within which individual sales items would receive unique attention . Pflueger 's interior was attuned to women 's fashions : the ground level floor was laid with rose @-@ beige marble from France , pink velvet counter tops held gloves for trying on , rose @-@ beige leather panels covered the walls of the shoe salon and the same leather served as covering for sofas and chairs that were provided by Neel D. Parker , interior designer and Pflueger 's fellow club member from The Family . Grover Magnin continued to work with Pflueger on three more stores into the 1940s . 
 In 1939 , plans for an underground garage at Union Square were given to Pflueger for political reasons . George Applegarth 's 1935 design was actively opposed from several directions and Pflueger 's social contacts and his friendship with mayor Angelo Joseph Rossi were needed to get the project started . Union Square garage opened in 1943 with Pflueger 's touch making it a full @-@ service valet garage complete with a waiting room and rest rooms for shoppers and the option of having shopping packages sent directly from a nearby store to the garage or for the car to be delivered to the store . The concept of an underground garage below a city park was influential : New York builder Robert Moses requested copies of Pflueger 's plans ( little changed from Applegarth 's ) and Pershing Square in Los Angeles was excavated and rebuilt in 1952 along the same lines . 
 In 1942 , while America geared up for front line involvement in World War II , Pflueger received fewer assignments than he had been seeing previously . Grover Magnin kept a flow of work with I. Magnin designs , and Pflueger also helped the Army with a depot building in Ogden , Utah . He began to draw up plans for a 12 @-@ story cross @-@ shaped medical teaching hospital for the University of California , San Francisco ( eventually to be built at 505 Parnassus in 1955 with additional design work performed by his brother Milton Pflueger ) . His firm accepted a commission to excavate below the Mark Hopkins Hotel in order to create a bomb @-@ resistant radio transmission center for AM station KSFO and shortwave programs of the Voice of America . This space became the hotel 's underground parking garage after the war . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Timothy L. Pflueger died suddenly at the age of 54 on November 20 , 1946 of a heart attack on Post Street outside of the Olympic Club after taking his usual evening swim . At his death , Pflueger was not finished with the radical interior and exterior transformation of the I. Magnin flagship store at Union Square , a sleek International design that remained influential for years afterward . 
 All his adult life , Pflueger maintained his residence at his childhood home on Guerrero Street . When entertaining downtown late into the evening , he was known to spend an occasional night at the Olympic Club . Pflueger drove a green Cadillac convertible and was often seen with his steady lady friend on his arm . Pflueger never married and left no children . His brother Milton , fifteen years younger , had been working with the firm since the 1930s and , at Tim 's death , Milton reorganized and headed the company , doing business as Milton T. Pflueger , Architect . 
 In 1990 , a bas @-@ relief of influential San Franciscans was sculpted over the facade of 235 Pine Street , a 26 @-@ story skyscraper . Timothy L. Pflueger was the only architect among those memorialized . In 2008 , the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to change the name of Chelsea Place , a small alley leading to the garage of the 450 Sutter Street building , to Timothy Pflueger Place . 
 = Learned Hand = 
 Billings Learned Hand ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ id ; January 27 , 1872 – August 18 , 1961 ) was a United States judge and judicial philosopher . He served on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and later the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit . Hand has been quoted more often by legal scholars and by the Supreme Court of the United States than any other lower @-@ court judge . 
 Born and raised in Albany , New York , Hand majored in philosophy at Harvard College and graduated with honors from Harvard Law School . After a short career as a lawyer in Albany and New York City , he was appointed at the age of 37 as a Federal District Judge in Manhattan in 1909 . The profession suited his detached and open @-@ minded temperament , and his decisions soon won him a reputation for craftsmanship and authority . Between 1909 and 1914 , under the influence of Herbert Croly 's social theories , Hand supported New Nationalism . He ran unsuccessfully as the Progressive Party 's candidate for Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals in 1913 , but withdrew from active politics shortly afterwards . In 1924 , President Calvin Coolidge promoted Hand to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit , which he went on to lead as the Senior Circuit Judge ( later retitled Chief Judge ) from 1939 until his semi @-@ retirement in 1951 . Scholars have recognized the Second Circuit under Hand as one of the finest appeals courts in the country 's history . Friends and admirers often lobbied for Hand 's promotion to the Supreme Court , but circumstances and his political past conspired against his appointment . 
 Hand possessed a gift for the English language , and his writings are admired as legal literature . He rose to fame outside the legal profession in 1944 during World War II after giving a short address in Central Park that struck a popular chord in its appeal for tolerance . During a period when a hysterical fear of subversion divided the nation , Hand was viewed as a liberal defender of civil liberties . A collection of Hand 's papers and addresses , published in 1952 as The Spirit of Liberty , sold well and won him new admirers . Even after he criticized the civil @-@ rights activism of the 1950s Warren Court , Hand retained his popularity . 
 Hand is also remembered as a pioneer of modern approaches to statutory interpretation . His decisions in specialist fields , such as patents , torts , admiralty law , and antitrust law , set lasting standards for craftsmanship and clarity . On constitutional matters , he was both a political progressive and an advocate of judicial restraint . He believed in the protection of free speech and in bold legislation to address social and economic problems . He argued , however , that the United States Constitution does not empower courts to overrule the legislation of elected bodies , except in extreme circumstances . Instead , he advocated the " combination of toleration and imagination that to me is the epitome of all good government " . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Billings Learned Hand was born on January 27 , 1872 , in Albany , New York , the second and last child of Samuel Hand ( 1833 – 86 ) and Lydia Hand ( née Learned ) . His mother 's family traditionally used surnames as given names ; and Hand was named for a maternal uncle and a grandfather , both named Billings Peck Learned . The Hands were a prominent family with a tradition of activism in the Democratic Party . Hand grew up in comfortable circumstances on Albany 's main residential street . The family had an " almost hereditary " attachment to the legal profession and has been described as " the most distinguished legal family in northern New York " . 
 Samuel Hand was an appellate lawyer , who had risen rapidly through the ranks of an Albany @-@ based law firm in the 1860s and , by age 32 , was the firm 's leading lawyer . In 1878 , he became the leader of the appellate bar and argued cases before the New York Court of Appeals in " greater number and importance than those argued by any other lawyer in New York during the same period " . Samuel Hand was a distant , intimidating figure to his son ; Learned Hand later described his relations with his father as " not really intimate " . Samuel Hand died from cancer when Learned was 14 . Learned 's mother thereafter promoted an idealized memory of her husband 's professional success , intellectual abilities , and parental perfection , placing considerable pressure on her son . 
 Lydia Hand was an involved and protective mother , who had been influenced by a Calvinist aunt as a child ; and she passed on a strong sense of duty and guilt to her only son . Learned Hand eventually came to understand the influences of his parents as formative . After his father 's death , he looked to religion to help him cope , writing to his cousin Augustus Noble Hand : " If you could imagine one half the comfort my religion has given to me in this terrible loss , you would see that Christ never forsakes those who cling to him . " The depth of Hand 's early religious convictions was in sharp contrast to his later agnosticism . 
 Hand was beset by anxieties and self @-@ doubt throughout his life , including night terrors as a child . He later admitted he was " very undecided , always have been — a very insecure person , very fearful ; morbidly fearful " . Especially after his father 's death , he grew up surrounded by doting women — his mother , his aunt , and his sister Lydia ( Lily ) , eight years his elder . Hand struggled with his name during his childhood and adulthood , worried that " Billings " and " Learned " were not sufficiently masculine . While working as a lawyer in 1899 , he ceased using the name " Billings " — calling it " pompous " — and ultimately took on the nickname " B " . 
 Hand spent two years at a small primary school before transferring at the age of seven to The Albany Academy , which he attended for the next 10 years . He never enjoyed the Academy 's uninspired teaching or its narrow curriculum , which focused on Ancient Greek and Latin , with few courses in English , history , science , or modern languages . Socially , he considered himself an outsider , rarely enjoying recesses or the school 's military drills . Vacations , spent in Elizabethtown , New York , were happier times . There , Hand developed a life @-@ long friendship with his cousin and future colleague Augustus Noble Hand , two years his senior . The two were self @-@ confessed " wild boys " , camping and hiking in the woods and hills , where Hand developed a love of nature and the countryside . Many years later , when he was in his 70s , Hand recorded several songs for the Library of Congress that he had learned as a boy from Civil War veterans in Elizabethtown . After his father 's death , he felt more pressure from his mother to excel academically . He finished near the top of his class and was accepted into Harvard College . His classmates — who opted for schools such as Williams and Yale — thought it a " <unk> , snobbish school " . 
 = = Harvard = = 
 Hand started at Harvard College in 1889 , initially focusing on classical studies and mathematics as advised by his late father . At the end of his sophomore year , however , he changed direction . He embarked on courses in philosophy and economics , studying under the eminent and inspirational philosophers William James , Josiah Royce and George Santayana . 
 At first , Hand found Harvard a difficult social environment . He was not selected for any of the social clubs that dominated campus life , and he felt this exclusion keenly . He was equally unsuccessful with the Glee Club and the football team ; for a time he rowed as a substitute for the rowing club . He later described himself as a " serious boy " , a hard worker who did not smoke , drink , or consort with prostitutes . He mixed more in his sophomore and senior years . He became a member of the Hasty Pudding Club and appeared as a blond @-@ wigged chorus girl in the 1892 student musical . He was also elected president of The Harvard Advocate , a student literary magazine . 
 Hand 's studious ways resulted in his election to Phi Beta Kappa , an elite society of scholarly students . He graduated with highest honors , was awarded a master 's as well as a bachelor 's degree , and was chosen by his classmates to deliver the Class Day oration at the 1893 commencement . Family tradition and expectation suggested that he would study law after graduation . For a while , he seriously considered post @-@ graduate work in philosophy , but he received no encouragement from his family or philosophy professors . Doubting himself , he " drifted " toward law . 
 Hand 's three years at Harvard Law School were intellectually and socially stimulating . In his second year , he moved into a boarding house with a group of fellow law students who were to become close friends . They studied hard and enjoyed discussing philosophy and literature and telling bawdy tales . Hand 's intellectual reputation proved less of a hindrance at law school than it had as an undergraduate . He was elected to the Pow @-@ Wow Club , in which law students practiced their skills in moot courts . He was also chosen as an editor of the Harvard Law Review , although he resigned in 1894 because it took too much time from his studies . 
 During the 1890s , Harvard Law School was pioneering the casebook method of teaching introduced by Dean Christopher Langdell . Apart from Langdell , Hand 's professors included Samuel Williston , John Chipman Gray , and James Barr Ames . Hand preferred those teachers who valued common sense and fairness , and ventured beyond casebook study into the philosophy of law . His favorite professor was James Bradley Thayer , who taught him evidence in his second year and constitutional law in his third . A man of broad interests , Thayer became a major influence on Hand 's jurisprudence . He emphasized the law 's historical and human dimensions rather than its certainties and extremes . He stressed the need for courts to exercise judicial restraint in deciding social issues . 
 = = Albany legal practice = = 
 Hand graduated from Harvard Law School in 1896 at the age of 24 . He returned to Albany to live with his mother and aunt , and started work for the law firm in which an uncle , Matthew Hale , was a partner . Hale 's unexpected death a few months later obliged Hand to move to a new firm , but by 1899 , he had become a partner . He had difficulty attracting his own clients , however , and found the work trivial and dull . Much of his time was spent researching and writing briefs , with few opportunities for the appellate work he preferred . His early courtroom appearances , when they came , were frequently difficult , sapping his fragile self @-@ confidence . He began to fear that he lacked the ability to think on his feet in court . 
 For two years , Hand tried to succeed as a lawyer by force of will , giving all his time to the practice . By 1900 , he was deeply dissatisfied with his progress . For intellectual stimulation , he increasingly looked outside his daily work . He wrote scholarly articles , taught part @-@ time at Albany Law School , and joined a lawyers ' discussion group in New York City . He also developed an interest in politics . 
 Hand came from a line of loyal Democrats , but in 1898 he voted for Republican Theodore Roosevelt as governor of New York . Though he deplored Roosevelt 's role in the " militant imperialism " of the Spanish – American War , he approved of the " amorphous mixture of socialism and laisser faire [ sic ] " in Roosevelt 's campaign speeches . Hand caused further family controversy by registering as a Republican for the presidential election of 1900 . Life and work in Albany no longer fulfilled him ; he began applying for jobs in New York City , despite family pressure against moving . 
 = = Marriage and New York = = 
 After reaching the age of 30 without developing a serious interest in a woman , Hand thought he was destined for bachelorhood . But , during a 1901 summer holiday in the Québec resort of La <unk> , he met 25 @-@ year @-@ old Frances Fincke , a graduate of Bryn Mawr College . Though indecisive in most matters , he waited only a few weeks before proposing . The more cautious Fincke postponed her answer for almost a year , while Hand wrote to and occasionally saw her . He also began to look more seriously for work in New York City . The next summer , both Hand and Fincke returned to La <unk> , and at the end of August 1902 , they became engaged and kissed for the first time . They married on December 6 , 1902 , shortly after Hand had accepted a post with the Manhattan law firm of Zabriskie , Burrill & Murray . The couple had three daughters : Mary <unk> ( born 1905 ) , Frances ( born 1907 ) , and Constance ( born 1909 ) . Hand proved an anxious husband and father . He corresponded regularly with his doctor brother @-@ in @-@ law about initial difficulties in conceiving and about his children 's illnesses . He survived pneumonia in February 1905 , taking months to recover . 
 The family at first spent summers in Mount Kisco , with Hand commuting on the weekends . After 1910 , they rented summer homes in Cornish , New Hampshire , a writers ' and artists ' colony with a stimulating social scene . The Hands bought a house there in 1919 , which they called " Low Court " . As Cornish was a nine @-@ hour train journey from New York , the couple were separated for long periods . Hand could join the family only for vacations . The Hands became friends of the noted artist Maxfield Parrish , who lived in nearby Plainfield . The Misses Hand posed for some of his paintings . 
 The Hands also became close friends of Cornish resident Louis Dow , a Dartmouth College professor . Frances Hand spent increasing amounts of time with Dow while her husband was in New York , and tension crept into the marriage . Despite speculation , however , there is no evidence that she and Dow were lovers . Hand regretted Frances ' long absences and urged her to spend more time with him , but he maintained an enduring friendship with Dow . He blamed himself for a lack of insight into his wife 's needs in the early years of the marriage , confessing his " blindness and insensibility to what you wanted and to your right to your own ways when they differed from mine " . Fearing he might otherwise lose her altogether , Hand came to accept Frances ' desire to spend time in the country with another man . 
 While staying in Cornish in 1908 , Hand began a close friendship with the political commentator and philosopher Herbert Croly . At the time , Croly was writing his influential book The Promise of American Life , in which he advocated a program of democratic and egalitarian reform under a national government with increased powers . When the book was published in November 1909 , Hand sent copies to friends and acquaintances , including former president Theodore Roosevelt . Croly 's ideas had a powerful effect on Roosevelt 's politics , influencing his advocacy of New Nationalism and the development of Progressivism . 
 Hand continued to be disappointed in his progress at work . A move to the firm of Gould & Wilkie in January 1904 brought neither the challenges nor the financial rewards for which he had hoped . " I was never any good as a lawyer , " he later admitted . " I didn 't have any success , any at all . " In 1907 , deciding that at the age of 35 success as a Wall Street lawyer was out of reach , he lobbied for a potential new federal judgeship in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York , the federal court headquartered in Manhattan . He became involved briefly in local Republican politics to strengthen his political base . In the event , Congress did not create the new judgeship in 1907 ; but , when the post was finally created in 1909 , Hand renewed his candidacy . With the help of the influential Charles C. Burlingham , a senior New York lawyer and close friend , he gained the backing of Attorney General George W. Wickersham , who urged President William Howard Taft to appoint Hand . One of the youngest federal judges ever appointed , Hand took his judicial oath at age 37 in April 1909 . 
 = = Federal judge = = 
 Hand served as a federal judge in the Southern District of New York from 1909 to 1924 . He dealt with fields of common law , including torts , contracts , and copyright , and admiralty law . His initial unfamiliarity with some of these specialties , along with his limited courtroom experience , caused him anxiety at first . Most of Hand 's early cases concerned bankruptcy issues , which he found tiresome , and patent law , which fascinated him . 
 Hand made some important decisions in the area of free speech . A frequently cited 1913 decision is United States v. Kennerley , an obscenity case concerning Daniel Carson Goodman 's Hagar <unk> , a social @-@ hygiene novel about the " wiles of vice , " which had caught the attention of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice . Hand allowed the case to go forward on the basis of the Hicklin test , which stemmed back to a seminal English decision of 1868 , Regina v. Hicklin . In his opinion , Hand recommended updating the law , arguing that the obscenity rule should not simply protect the most susceptible readers but should reflect community standards : 
 It seems hardly likely that we are even to @-@ day so lukewarm in our interest in letters or serious discussion as to be content to reduce our treatment of sex to the standard of a child 's library in the supposed interest of a salacious few , or that shame will for long prevent us from adequate portrayal of some of the most serious and beautiful sides of human nature . 
 Following his appointment as a judge , Hand became politically active in the cause of New Nationalism . With reservations , in 1911 he supported Theodore Roosevelt 's return to national politics . He approved of the former president 's plans to legislate on behalf of the underprivileged and to control corporations , as well as of his campaign against the abuse of judicial power . Hand sought to influence Roosevelt 's views on these subjects , both in person and in print , and wrote articles for Roosevelt 's magazine , The Outlook . His hopes of swaying Roosevelt were often dashed . Roosevelt 's poor grasp of legal issues particularly exasperated Hand . 
 Despite overwhelming support for Roosevelt in the primaries and polls , the Republicans renominated the incumbent President Taft . A furious Roosevelt bolted from the party to form the Progressive Party , nicknamed the " Bull Moose " movement . Most Republican progressives followed him , including Hand . The splitting of the Republican vote , however , harmed both Roosevelt 's and Taft 's chances of winning the November 1912 presidential election . As Hand expected , Roosevelt lost to the Democratic Party 's Woodrow Wilson , though he polled more votes than Taft . 
 Hand took the defeat in his stride . He considered the election merely as a first step in a reform campaign for " real national democracy " . Though he had limited his public involvement in the election campaign , he now took part in planning a party structure . He also accepted the Progressive nomination for chief judge of New York Court of Appeals , then an elective position , in September 1913 . He refused to campaign , however , and later admitted that " the thought of harassing the electorate was more than I could bear " . His vow of silence affected his showing , and he received only 13 % of the votes . Hand came to regret his candidacy : " I ought to have lain off , as I now view it ; I was a judge and a judge has no business to mess into such things . " 
 By 1916 , Hand realized that the Progressive Party had no future , as the liberal policies of the Democratic government were making much of its program redundant . Roosevelt 's decision not to stand in the 1916 presidential election dealt the party its death blow . Hand had already turned to an alternative political outlet in Herbert Croly 's The New Republic , a liberal magazine which he had helped launch in 1914 . Hand wrote a series of unsigned articles for the magazine on issues of social reform and judicial power ; his only signed article was " The Hope of the Minimum Wage " , published in November 1916 , which called for laws to protect the underprivileged . Often attending staff dinners and meetings , Hand became a close friend of the gifted young editor Walter Lippmann . The outbreak of war in Europe in 1914 had coincided with the founding of the magazine , whose pages often debated the events in Europe . The New Republic adopted a cautiously sympathetic stance towards the Allies , which Hand supported wholeheartedly . After the United States entered the war in 1917 , Hand considered leaving the bench to assist the war effort . Several possible war @-@ related positions were suggested to him . Nothing came of them , aside from his chairing a committee on intellectual property law that suggested treaty amendments for the Paris Peace Conference . 
 Hand made his most memorable decision of the war in 1917 in Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten . After the country joined the war , Congress had enacted an Espionage Act that made it a federal crime to hinder the war effort . The first test of the new law came two weeks later when the postmaster of New York City refused to deliver the August issue of The Masses , a self @-@ described " revolutionary journal " . The edition contained drawings , cartoons , and articles criticizing the government 's decision to go to war . 
 The publishing company sought an injunction to prevent the ban , and the case came before Judge Hand . In July 1917 , he ruled that the journal should not be barred from distribution through the mail . Though The Masses supported those who refused to serve in the forces , its text did not , in Hand 's view , tell readers that they must violate the law . Hand argued that suspect material should be judged on what he called an " incitement test " : only if its language directly urged readers to violate the law was it seditious — otherwise freedom of speech should be protected . This focus on the words themselves , rather than on their effect , was novel and daring ; but Hand 's decision was promptly stayed , and later overturned on appeal . He always maintained that his ruling had been correct . Between 1918 and 1919 , he attempted to convince Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , a man he greatly admired , of his argument . His efforts at first appeared fruitless , but Holmes ' dissenting opinion in Abrams v. United States in November 1919 urged greater protection of political speech . Scholars have credited the critiques of Hand , Ernst Freund , Louis Brandeis , and Zechariah Chafee for the change in Holmes 's views . In the long @-@ term , Hand 's decision proved a landmark in the history of free speech in the country . In Brandenburg v. Ohio ( 1969 ) , the Supreme Court announced a standard for protecting free speech that in effect recognized his Masses opinion as law . 
 Hand had known that ruling against the government might harm his prospects of promotion . By the time of the case , he was already the most senior judge of his district . The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit often summoned him to sit with that court to hear appeals , a task he found stimulating . In 1917 , he lobbied for promotion to the Second Circuit , but the unpopularity of his Masses decision and his reputation as a liberal stood against him . He was passed over in favor of Martin T. Manton . 
 In the final months of the war , Hand increasingly supported President Woodrow Wilson 's post @-@ war foreign policy objectives . He believed the United States should endorse the League of Nations and the Treaty of Versailles , despite their flaws . This position estranged him from Croly and others at The New Republic , who vehemently rejected both . <unk> from his old circle on the magazine and by the reactionary and isolationist mood of the country , Hand found himself politically homeless .

 The next Second Circuit vacancy arose in 1921 , but with the conservative Warren G. Harding administration in power , Hand did not put himself forward . Nonetheless Hand 's reputation was such that by 1923 , Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr. wanted him on the Supreme Court , and in 1924 Harding 's successor , Calvin Coolidge , appointed Hand to the Second Circuit . It was a sign of Hand 's increased stature that figures such as Coolidge and Chief Justice William Howard Taft now endorsed him . Coolidge sought to add new blood to a senior judiciary that was seen as corrupt and inefficient . In 1926 and 1927 , the Second Circuit was strengthened by the appointments of Thomas Walter Swan and Hand 's cousin Augustus Noble Hand . 
 After the demise of the Progressive Party , Hand had withdrawn from party politics . He committed himself to public impartiality , despite his strong views on political issues . He remained , however , a strong supporter of freedom of speech , and any sign of the " merry sport of Red @-@ baiting " troubled him . In 1920 , for example , he wrote in support of New York Governor Al Smith 's veto of the anti @-@ sedition Lusk Bills . The New York Assembly had approved these bills in a move to bar five elected Socialist Party legislators from taking their seats . In 1922 , Hand privately objected to a proposed limit on the number of Jewish students admitted to Harvard College . " If we are to have in this country racial divisions like those in Europe , " he wrote , " let us close up shop now " . 
 In public , Hand discussed issues of democracy , free speech , and toleration only in general terms . This discretion , plus a series of impressive speaking engagements , won him the respect of legal scholars and journalists , and by 1930 he was viewed as a serious candidate for a seat on the Supreme Court . His friend Felix Frankfurter , then a Harvard Law School professor , was among those lobbying hard for Hand 's appointment . President Herbert Hoover chose to bypass him , possibly for political reasons , and appointed Charles Evans Hughes , who had previously served on the Court for six years before resigning to become the Republican candidate for President in 1916 , as Chief Justice . With Hughes and another New Yorker , Harlan Fiske Stone , on the Court , the promotion of a third New Yorker was then seen as impossible . 
 Hand had voted for Hoover in 1928 , and he did so again in 1932 ; but in 1936 , he voted for the Democrats and Franklin D. Roosevelt , as a reaction to the economic and social turmoil that followed the Wall Street Crash of 1929 . With the Great Depression setting in , Hand favored a policy of interventionist central government . He came to accept Frankfurter 's view that redistribution of wealth was essential for economic recovery . Hoover resisted this approach , favoring individualism and free enterprise . Roosevelt , on the other hand , promised the voters a New Deal . They elected him on a platform of strong executive leadership and radical economic reform . Hand voted for Roosevelt again in 1940 and 1944 , but he remained vigilant on the constitutional dangers of big government . Like others , including Walter Lippmann , he sensed the dictatorial potential of New Deal policies . He had no hesitation in condemning Roosevelt 's 1937 bill to expand the Supreme Court and pack it with New Dealers . 
 Hand was increasingly called upon to judge cases arising from the flood of New Deal legislation . The line between central government authority and local legislation particularly tested his powers of judgment . In 1935 , the case of United States v. Schechter came before the Second Circuit . Hand and his two colleagues had to judge whether a New York poultry firm had contravened New Deal legislation on unfair trade practices . They ruled that the National Industrial Recovery Act did not apply to the Schechter Poultry Corporation , which traded solely within the state . " The line is no doubt in the end arbitrary , " Hand wrote in a memorandum , " but we have got to draw it , because without it Congress can take over all the government . " The Supreme Court later affirmed Hand 's decision . 
 Hand became an acknowledged expert on New Deal statutes . He relished the challenge of interpreting such legislation , calling it " an act of creative imagination " . In a 1933 broadcast , he explained the balancing act required of a judge in interpreting statutes : 
 On the one hand he must not enforce whatever he thinks best ; he must leave that to the common will expressed by the government . On the other , he must try as best he can to put into concrete form what that will is , not by slavishly following the words , but by trying honestly to say what was the underlying purpose expressed .

 When war broke out in Europe in 1939 , Learned Hand adopted an anti @-@ isolationist stance . He rarely spoke out publicly , not only because of his position but because he thought <unk> unseemly in an old man . In February 1939 , he became his court 's senior circuit leader ( in effect , chief judge , although the title was not created until 1948 ) . In this post , Hand succeeded Martin Manton , who had resigned after corruption allegations that later led to Manton 's criminal conviction for bribery . Not an admirer of Manton , Hand nonetheless testified at his trial that he had never noticed any corrupt behavior in his predecessor . Having sat in two cases in which Manton accepted bribes , Hand worried for years afterward that he should have detected his colleague 's corruption . 
 Hand still regarded his main job as judging . As circuit leader , he sought to free himself and his judges from too great an administrative burden . He concentrated on maintaining good relations with his fellow judges and on cleansing the court of patronage appointments . Despite the Manton case and constant friction between two of the court 's judges , Charles Edward Clark and Jerome Frank , the Second Circuit under Hand earned a reputation as one of the best appeal courts in the country 's history . 
 In 1942 , Hand 's friends once again lobbied for him to fill a Supreme Court vacancy , but Roosevelt did not appoint him . The president gave age as the reason , but philosophical differences with Hand may also have played a part . Another explanation lies in one of Justice William O. Douglas 's autobiographies , where Douglas states that , despite Roosevelt 's belief that Hand was the best person for the job , Roosevelt had been offended by the pressure Justice Felix Frankfurter placed on the president during a vigorous letter @-@ writing campaign on Hand 's behalf . D.C. Circuit Judge Wiley Blount Rutledge , whom Roosevelt appointed , died in 1949 , while Hand lived until 1961 . In a February 1944 correspondence with Frankfurter , Hand expressed a low opinion of Roosevelt ’ s new appointees , referring to Justice Hugo Black , Justice Douglas , and Justice Frank Murphy as " Hillbilly Hugo , Good Old Bill , and Jesus lover of my Soul " . Deeply disappointed at the time , Hand later regretted his ambition : " It was the importance , the power , the trappings of the God damn thing that really drew me on . " 
 Hand was relieved when the United States entered the war in December 1941 . He felt free to participate in organizations and initiatives connected with the war effort , and was particularly committed to programs in support of Greece and Russia . He backed Roosevelt for the 1944 election , partly because he feared a return to isolationism and the prolonging of the wartime erosion of civil liberties . In 1943 , the House Un @-@ American Activities Committee or " Dies Committee " , for example , had aroused his fears with an investigation into " subversive activities " by government workers . Hand 's contemporary at Harvard College , Robert Morss Lovett , was one of those accused , and Hand spoke out on his behalf . As the end of the war approached , there was much talk of international peace organizations and courts to prevent future conflict , but Hand was skeptical . He also condemned the Nuremberg war @-@ crimes trials , which he saw as motivated by vengeance ; he did not believe that " aggressive war " could be construed as a crime . " The difference between vengeance and justice , " he wrote later , " is that justice must apply to all . " 
 Hand had never been well known to the general public , but a short speech he made in 1944 won him fame and a national reputation for wisdom that lasted until the end of his life . On May 21 , 1944 , he addressed almost one and a half million people in Central Park , New York , at the annual " I Am an American Day " event , where newly naturalized citizens swore the Pledge of Allegiance . He stated that all Americans were immigrants who had come to America in search of liberty . Liberty , he said , was not located in America 's constitutions , laws , and courts , but in the hearts of the people . In what would become the speech 's most quoted passage , Hand asked : 
 What then is the spirit of liberty ? I cannot define it ; I can only tell you my own faith . The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right ; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to understand the minds of other men and women ; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias ; the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded ; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who , near two thousand years ago , taught mankind that lesson it has never learned , but has never quite forgotten ; that there may be a kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest . 
 Extracts of the speech appeared in The New Yorker on June 10 . Several weeks later , The New York Times printed the whole text , quickly followed by Life magazine and Reader 's Digest . Hand 's message that liberty is safeguarded by everyday Americans struck a popular chord , and he suddenly found himself a folk hero . Though he enjoyed the acclaim , he thought it unmerited . His biographer Gerald Gunther , noting the paradox of the agnostic Hand 's use of religious overtones , suggests that the most challenging aspect of the speech was that the spirit of liberty must entertain doubt . 
 = = Postwar years = = 
 Learned Hand 's 75th birthday in 1947 was much celebrated in the press and in legal circles . C. C. Burlingham , Hand 's former sponsor , for example , called him " now unquestionably the first among American judges " . Hand remained modest in the face of such acclaim . He continued to work as before , combining his role as presiding judge of the Second Circuit with his engagement in political issues . In 1947 , he voiced his opposition to a proposed " group libel " statute that would have banned defamation of racial or minority groups . He argued that such a law would imply that intolerance could base itself upon evidence . The effect of the proposed prosecutions , he said , would be " rather to exacerbate than to assuage the feelings which lie behind the defamation of groups " . 
 In the postwar period , Hand shared the dismay of his compatriots about Stalinism and the onset of the Cold War . At the same time , he was sensitive to the domestic problems created by what he saw as a hysterical fear of international Communism . Already in 1947 , he noted that " the frantic witch hunters are given free rein to set up a sort of Inquisition , detecting heresy wherever non @-@ conformity appears " . Hand was distressed by the crusade against domestic subversion that became part of American public life after the war . He particularly despised the anti @-@ Communist campaign of Senator Joseph McCarthy that began in 1950 and which became known as McCarthyism . Though Hand expressed his horror of McCarthyism privately , he hesitated to do so publicly because cases arising from it were likely to come before his court . 
 During this period , Hand took part in three notable cases that posed a particular challenge to his impartiality on Cold War issues : United States v. Coplon , United States v. Dennis , and United States v. Remington . Department of Justice worker Judith Coplon had been sentenced to 15 years in prison for stealing and attempting to pass on defense information . In 1950 , her appeal came before a Second Circuit panel that included Learned Hand . It rested on her claim that her rights under the Fourth Amendment had been infringed by a warrantless search , and that details of illegal wiretaps had not been fully disclosed at her trial . Hand made it clear that Coplon was guilty of the charges . However , he rejected the trial judge 's conclusion that a warrantless arrest had been justified . He ruled therefore that papers seized during the arrest had been inadmissible as evidence . The trial judge 's failure to disclose all the wiretap records , Hand concluded , made a reversal of Coplon 's conviction necessary . In his written opinion , Hand stated that " [ F ] ew weapons in the arsenal of freedom are more useful than the power to compel a government to disclose the evidence on which it seeks to forfeit the liberty of its citizens . " Many followers of the trial sent Hand hate mail for his decision . By contrast , in the 1950 case United States v. Dennis , Hand affirmed the convictions under the 1940 Smith Act of eleven leaders of the Communist Party of the United States for subversion . He ruled that calls for the violent overthrow of the American government posed enough of a " probable danger " to justify the invasion of free speech . After the case , he was attacked from the opposite political direction for appearing to side with McCarthyism . 
 In 1953 , Hand wrote a scathing dissent from a Second Circuit decision to affirm the perjury conviction of William Remington , a government economist accused of Communist sympathies and activities . In 1951 , the same panel had overturned Remington 's previous conviction for perjury , but in the appeal of the later case Hand was outvoted two to one . The prosecution produced stronger evidence against Remington this time , much of it obtained from his wife . Sentenced to three years imprisonment , Remington was murdered in November 1954 by three fellow inmates , who beat him over the head with a brick wrapped in a sock . According to Hand 's biographer Gunther , " The image of Remington being bludgeoned to death in prison haunted Hand for the rest of his life . " 
 Only after stepping down as a full @-@ time judge in 1951 did Hand join the public debate on McCarthyism . Shortly after announcing his semi @-@ retirement , he gave an unscripted speech that was published in The Washington Post , an anti @-@ McCarthy newspaper . 
 [ M ] y friends , will you not agree that any society which begins to be doubtful of itself ; in which one man looks at another and says : " He may be a traitor , " in which that spirit has disappeared which says : " I will not accept that , I will not believe that — I will demand proof . I will not say of my brother that he may be a traitor , " but I will say , " Produce what you have . I will judge it fairly , and if he is , he shall pay the penalties ; but I will not take it on rumor . I will not take it on hearsay . I will remember that what has brought us up from savagery is a loyalty to truth , and truth cannot emerge unless it is subjected to the utmost scrutiny " — will you not agree that a society which has lost sight of that , cannot survive ? 
 Hand followed this up with an address to the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York the next year . Once again , his attack on McCarthyism won approval from many liberals . Asked to send a copy of his views to McCarthy , Hand replied that he had Richard Nixon in mind as well . Despite his concerns about Nixon as vice president , Hand voted for Dwight Eisenhower in the 1952 election , later crediting Eisenhower with bringing about McCarthy 's downfall in 1954 . 
 = = Semi @-@ retirement and death = = 
 In 1951 , Hand retired from " regular active service " as a federal judge . He assumed senior status , a form of semi @-@ retirement , and continued to sit on the bench , with a considerable workload . The following year , he published The Spirit of Liberty , a collection of papers and addresses that neither he nor publisher Alfred A. Knopf expected to make a profit . In fact , the book earned admiring reviews , sold well , and made Hand more widely known . A 1958 paperback edition sold even better , though Hand always refused royalties from material he never intended for publication . 
 Louis Dow had died in 1944 , with Frances Hand at his side . The Hands ' marriage then entered its final , happiest phase , in which they rediscovered their first love . Former law clerks have provided intimate details of Hand 's character during the last decade of his life . Legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin recalls that Hand , scrupulous about public economy , used to turn out the lights in all the offices at the end of each day . For the same reason , he refused Dworkin the customary month 's paid vacation at the end of his service . Shortly afterward , to Dworkin 's surprise , Hand wrote him a personal check for an extra month 's pay as a wedding present . Hand was known for his explosive temper . Gunther remembers him throwing a paperweight in his direction which narrowly missed . Hand had a habit of turning his seat 180 ° on lawyers whose arguments annoyed him , and he could be bitingly sarcastic . In a typical memo , he wrote , " This is the most miserable of cases , but we must dispose of it as though it had been presented by actual lawyers . " Despite such outbursts , Hand was deeply insecure throughout his life , as he fully recognized . In his 80s , he still fretted about his rejection by the elite social clubs at Harvard College . He was convinced that his wife had rescued him from a life as a " melancholic , a failure [ because ] I should have thought myself so , and probably single and hopelessly hypochondriac " . 
 Learned Hand remained in good physical and mental condition for most of the last decade of his life . In 1958 , he gave the Holmes Lectures at Harvard Law School . These lectures proved to be Hand 's last major critique of judicial activism , a position he had first taken up in 1908 with his attack on the Lochner ruling . They included a controversial attack on the Warren Court 's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education , which in Hand 's opinion had exceeded its powers by overruling Jim Crow segregation laws . His views were widely criticized as reactionary and unfortunate , with most deploring the fact that they might encourage segregationists who opposed libertarian judicial rulings . Published as The Bill of Rights , the lectures nevertheless became a national bestseller . 
 By 1958 , Hand was suffering from intense pain in his back and faced difficulty in walking . " I can just manage , with not infrequent pauses , to walk about a third of a mile , " he wrote to Felix Frankfurter . " My feet get very numb and my back painful . The truth is that 86 is too long . " Soon , he was obliged to use crutches , but he remained mentally sharp and continued to hear cases . In 1960 , he worked briefly on President Dwight Eisenhower 's " Commission on National Goals " , but he resigned because " it involved more work than in the present state of my health I care to add to the judicial work that I am still trying to do " . 
 By June 1961 , Hand was in a wheelchair . He joked that he felt idle because he had taken part in no more than about 25 cases that year , and that he would start another job if he could find one . The following month , he suffered a heart attack at Cornish . He was taken to St Luke 's Hospital in New York City , where he died peacefully on August 18 , 1961 . The New York Times ran a front @-@ page obituary . The Times of London wrote : " There are many who will feel that with the death of Learned Hand the golden age of the American judiciary has come to an end . " 
 He was buried next to his wife in the family plot at Albany Rural Cemetery near Menands , New York . 
 = = Philosophy = = 
 Hand 's study of philosophy at Harvard left a lasting imprint on his thought . As a student , he lost his faith in God , and from that point on he became a skeptic . Hand 's view of the world has been identified as relativistic ; in the words of scholar Kathryn Griffith , " [ i ] t was his devotion to a concept of relative values that prompted him to question opinions of the Supreme Court which appeared to place one value absolutely above the others , whether the value was that of individual freedom or equality or the protection of young people from obscene literature . " Hand instead sought objective standards in constitutional law , most famously in obscenity and civil liberties cases . He saw the Constitution and the law as compromises to resolve conflicting interests , possessing no moral force of their own . This denial that any divine or natural rights are embodied in the Constitution led Hand to a <unk> view of the Bill of Rights . In this approach , provisions of the Constitution , such as freedom of press , freedom of speech , and equal protection , should be interpreted through their wording and in the light of historical analysis rather than as " guides on concrete occasions " . For Hand , moral values were a product of their times and a matter of taste . 
 Hand 's civil instincts were at odds with the duty of a judge to stay aloof from politics . As a judge he respected even bad laws ; as a member of society he felt free to question the decisions behind legislation . In his opinion , members of a democratic society should be involved in legislative decision @-@ making . He therefore regarded toleration as a prerequisite of civil liberty . In practice , this even meant that those who wish to promote ideas repugnant to the majority should be free to do so , within broad limits . 
 Hand 's skepticism extended to his political philosophy : he once described himself as " a conservative among liberals , and a liberal among conservatives " . As early as 1898 , he rejected his family 's Jeffersonian Democratic tradition . His thoughts on liberty , collected in The Spirit of Liberty ( 1952 ) , began by recalling the political philosophies of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton . Jefferson believed that each individual has a right to freedom , and that government , though necessary , threatens that freedom . In contrast , Hamilton argued that freedom depends on government : too much freedom leads to anarchy and the tyranny of the mob . Hand , who believed , following Thomas Hobbes , that the rule of law is the only alternative to the rule of brutality , leaned towards Hamilton . Since the freedom granted to the American pioneers was no longer feasible , he accepted that individual liberty should be moderated by society 's norms . He nevertheless saw the liberty to create and to choose as vital to peoples ' humanity and entitled to legal protection . He assumed the goal of human beings to be the " good life " , defined as each individual chooses . 
 Between 1910 and 1916 , Hand tried to translate his political philosophy into political action . Having read Croly 's The Promise of American Life and its anti @-@ Jeffersonian plea for government intervention in economic and social issues , he joined the Progressive Party . However , he discovered that party politicking was incompatible not only with his role as a judge but with his philosophical objectivity . The pragmatic philosophy Hand had imbibed from William James at Harvard required each issue to be individually judged on its merits , without partiality . In contrast , political action required partisanship and a choice between values . After 1916 , Hand preferred to retreat from party politics into a detached skepticism . His belief in central planning resurfaced during the 1930s in his growing approval of Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal , as he once again — though this time as an observer — endorsed a program of government intervention . Hand was also an interventionist on foreign policy , supporting U.S. involvement in both world wars , and disdained isolationism . 
 = = Jurisprudence = = 
 Hand has been called one of the United States ' most significant judicial philosophers . A leading advocate of judicial restraint , he took seriously Alexander Hamilton 's formulation that " the judiciary ... may truly be said to have neither force nor will , but merely judgement . " Any judicial ruling that had the effect of legislating from the bench troubled Hand . In 1908 , in his article " Due Process of Law and the Eight @-@ Hour Day " , he attacked the 1905 Supreme Court ruling in Lochner v. New York , which had struck down a law prohibiting bakery staff from working more than ten hours a day . The Supreme Court went on to strike down a series of similar worker @-@ protective laws on the grounds that they restricted freedom of contract . Hand regarded this principle as undemocratic . " For the state to intervene " , he argued , " to make more just and equal the relative strategic advantages of the two parties to the contract , of whom one is under the pressure of absolute want , while the other is not , is as proper a legislative function as that it should neutralize the relative advantages arising from fraudulent cunning or from superior force . " 
 The issue concerned Hand again during the New Deal period , when the Supreme Court repeatedly overturned or blocked Franklin D. Roosevelt 's legislation . As an instinctive democrat , Hand was appalled that an elected government should have its laws struck down in this way . He viewed it as a judicial " usurpation " for the Supreme Court to assume the role of a third chamber in these cases . As far as he was concerned , the Constitution already provided a full set of checks and balances on legislation . Nevertheless , Hand did not hesitate to condemn Roosevelt 's frustrated attempt to pack the Supreme Court in 1937 , which led commentators to warn of totalitarianism . The answer , for Hand , lay in the separation of powers : courts should be independent and act on the legislation of elected governments . 
 Hand 's democratic respect for legislation meant that he hardly ever struck down a law . Whenever his decisions went against the government , he based them only on the boundaries of law in particular cases . He adhered to the doctrine of presumptive validity , which assumes that legislators know what they are doing when they pass a law . Even when a law was uncongenial to him , or when it seemed contradictory , Hand set himself to interpret the legislative intent . Sometimes , however , he was obliged to draw the line between federal and state laws , as in United States v. Schechter Poultry . In this important case , he ruled that a New Deal law on working conditions did not apply to a New York poultry firm that conducted its business only within the state . Hand wrote in his opinion : " It is always a serious thing to declare any act of Congress unconstitutional , and especially in a case where it is part of a comprehensive plan for the rehabilitation of the nation as a whole . With the wisdom of that plan we have nothing whatever to do ... " Hand also occasionally went against the government in the area of free speech . He believed that courts should protect the right to free speech even against the majority will . In Hand 's view , judges must remain detached at times when public opinion is hostile to minorities and governments issue laws to repress those minorities . Hand was the first judge to rule on a case arising from the Espionage Act of 1917 , which sought to silence opposition to the war effort . In his decision on Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten , he defined his position on political incitement : 
 <unk> of existing policies is easily transformed into forcible resistance of the authority which puts them in execution , and it would be folly to disregard the causal relation between the two . Yet to assimilate agitation , legitimate as such , with direct incitement to violent resistance , is to disregard the tolerance of all methods of political agitation which in normal times is a safeguard for free government . The distinction is not scholastic subterfuge , but a hard @-@ bought acquisition in the fight for freedom . 
 In the case of United States v. Dennis in 1950 , Hand made a ruling that appeared to contradict his Masses decision . By then , a series of precedents had intervened , often based on Oliver Wendell Holmes 's " clear and present danger " test , leaving him less room for maneuver . Hand felt he had " no choice " but to agree that threats against the government by a group of Communists were illegal under the repressive Smith Act of 1940 . In order to do so , he interpreted the " clear and present danger " in a new way . " In each case , " he wrote , " [ courts ] must ask whether the gravity of the ' evil ' , discounted by its improbability , justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid the danger . " This formula allowed more scope for curbing free speech in cases where , as the government believed with Communism , the danger was grave , whether it was immediate or not . Critics and disappointed liberals accused Hand of placing his concern for judicial restraint ahead of freedom of speech . Hand confided to a friend that , if it had been up to him , he would " never have prosecuted those birds " . 
 In the opinion of Kathryn Griffith , " The importance of Learned Hand 's philosophy in terms of practical application to the courts lies generally in his view of the pragmatic origin of all law , but most specifically in his unique interpretation of the Bill of Rights . " Hand proposed that the Bill of Rights was not law at all but a set of " admonitory " principles to ensure the fair exercise of constitutional powers . He therefore opposed the use of its " due process of law " clauses as a pretext for national intervention in state legislation . He even advocated the removal of those clauses from the Constitution . In Hand 's analysis , " due process " is no more than a stock phrase to cover a long tradition of common law procedure . He contended that the term had inflated in scope beyond the meaning intended in the Bill of Rights . The result was the misuse of due process to invade rights that the Constitution was designed to protect . For Hand , a law passed by an elected body should be presumed to meet the test of due process . A court that decides otherwise and strikes down such a law is acting <unk> . Hand maintained this stance even when the Supreme Court struck down anti @-@ liberal laws that he detested . His reasoning has never been widely accepted . Critics of his position included his colleague on the Second Circuit , Jerome Frank , who wrote : " [ I ] t seems to me that here , most uncharacteristically , Judge Hand indulges in a judgement far too sweeping , one which rests on a too @-@ sharp either @-@ or , all or nothing , dichotomy . ... Obviously the courts cannot do the whole job . But just as obviously , they can sometimes help to arrest evil popular trends at their inception . " 
 Richard Posner , an influential appellate judge reviewing a biography of Hand , asserts that Hand " displayed a positive antipathy toward constitutional law . To exaggerate only a little , he didn 't think judges should have anything to do with it . " Posner suggests that although Hand is remembered today as one of the three greatest judges in American history , his status as a truly " great judge " was not based on his " slight " contributions to First Amendment jurisprudence or other fields of constitutional law , but rather on his decisions in other areas such as antitrust , intellectual property , and tort law . 
 = = Influence = = 
 Learned Hand wrote approximately four thousand judicial opinions during his career . Admired for their clarity and analytic precision , they have been quoted more often in Supreme Court opinions and by legal scholars than those of any other lower @-@ court judge . Both Hand 's dissent in United States v. Kennerley and his ruling in United States v. Levine have often been cited in obscenity cases . Hand 's view that literary works should be judged as a whole and in relation to their intended readership is now accepted in American law . His use of historical data to gauge legislative intent has become a widespread practice . According to Archibald Cox : " The opinions of Judge Hand have had significant influence both in breaking down the restrictions imposed by the dry literalism of conservative tradition and in showing how to use with sympathetic understanding the information afforded by the legislative and administrative processes . " Hand 's decision in the 1917 Masses case influenced Zechariah Chafee 's widely read book , Freedom of Speech ( 1920 ) . In his dedication , Chafee wrote , " [ Hand ] during the turmoil of war courageously maintained the traditions of English @-@ speaking freedom and gave it new clearness and strength for the wiser years to come . " 
 Learned Hand played a key role in the interpretation of new federal crime laws in the period following the passing of the U.S. Criminal Code in 1909 . In a series of judicial opinions and speeches , he opposed excessive concern for criminal defendants , and wrote " Our dangers do not lie in too little tenderness to the accused . Our procedure has always been haunted by the ghost of the innocent man convicted . ... What we need to fear is the archaic formalism and watery sentiment that obstructs , delays and defeats the prosecution of crime . " He insisted that harmless trial errors should not automatically lead to a reversal on appeal . Hand balanced these views with important decisions to protect a defendant 's constitutional rights concerning unreasonable searches , forced confessions and cumulative sentences . 
 His opinions have also proved lasting in fields of commercial law . Law students studying torts often encounter Hand 's 1947 decision for United States v. Carroll Towing Co . , which gave a formula for determining liability in cases of negligence . Hand 's interpretations of complex Internal Revenue Codes , which he called " a thicket of verbiage " , have been used as guides in the gray area between individual and corporate taxes . In an opinion sometimes seen as condoning tax avoidance , Hand stated in 1947 that " there is nothing sinister in so arranging one 's affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible " . He was referring to reporting of individual income through corporate tax forms for legitimate business reasons . In tax decisions , as in all statutory cases , Hand studied the intent of the original legislation . His opinions became a valuable guide to tax administrators . Hand 's landmark decision in United States v. Aluminum Company of America in 1945 influenced the development of antitrust law . His decisions in patent , copyright , and admiralty cases have contributed to the development of law in those fields . 
 Hand was also a founding member of the American Law Institute , where he helped develop the influential <unk> of the Law serving as models for refining and improving state codes in various fields . One American Law Institute recommendation was to decriminalize sexual conduct such as adultery and homosexuality , for which reason the July – August 1955 issue of the Mattachine Society Review , the magazine of the country 's first nationwide homosexual organization , published a salute to Judge Hand featuring his photograph on the cover . 
 After Hand 's lectures and publications became widely known , his influence reached courts throughout the country . On the occasion of his 75th birthday on January 27 , 1947 , The Washington Post reported : " He has won recognition as a judges ' judge . His opinions command respect wherever our law extends , not because of his standing in the judicial hierarchy , but because of the clarity of thought and the cogency of reasoning that shape them . " 
 To the wider public , who knew little of his legal work , Hand was by then a folk hero . Social scientist Marvin Schick has pointed out that this mythic status is a paradox . Because Hand never served on the Supreme Court , the majority of his cases were routine and his judgments rooted in precedent . On Hand 's retirement in 1951 , Felix Frankfurter predicted that his " actual decisions will be all <unk> than the Dodo before long , as at least many of them are already " . Working for a lower court , however , saved Hand from the taint of political influence that often hung over the Supreme Court . Hand 's eloquence as a writer played a larger part in the spread of his influence than the substance of his decisions ; and Schick believes that the Hand myth brushes over contradictions in his legal philosophy . Hand 's reputation as a libertarian obscures the fact that he was cautious as a judge . Though a liberal , he argued for judicial restraint in interpreting the Constitution , and regarded the advancement of civil liberties as a task for the legislature , not the courts . In his 1958 Holmes Lectures , for example , he voiced doubts about the constitutionality of the Warren Court 's civil rights rulings . This philosophy of judicial restraint failed to influence the decisions of the Supreme Court during Hand 's lifetime and afterwards . 
 Finally , in an essay called Origin of a Hero discussing his novel the Rector of Justin , author Louis Auchincloss says the main character was not based on a headmaster ; certainly not as was often speculated Groton 's famous Endicott Peabody . " If you want to disguise a real life character , " Auchincloss advised fellow novelists , " just change his profession . " His actual model for the Rector of Justin was " the greatest man it has been my good luck to know " – Judge Learned Hand .

 = <unk> shark = 
 The frilled shark ( Chlamydoselachus anguineus ) is one of two extant species of shark in the family <unk> , with a wide but patchy distribution in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans . This species is found over the outer continental shelf and upper continental slope , generally near the bottom , though there is evidence of substantial upward movements . It has been caught as deep as 1 @,@ 570 m ( 5 @,@ 150 ft ) , although it is uncommon below 1 @,@ 200 m ( 3 @,@ 900 ft ) . In Suruga Bay , Japan , it is most common at depths of 50 – 200 m ( 160 – 660 ft ) . Exhibiting several " primitive " features , the frilled shark has often been termed a " living fossil " . It reaches a length of 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) and has a dark brown , eel @-@ like body with the dorsal , pelvic , and anal fins placed far back . Its common name comes from the frilly or fringed appearance of its six pairs of gill slits , with the first pair meeting across the throat . 
 Seldom observed , the frilled shark may capture prey by bending its body and lunging forward like a snake . The long , extremely flexible jaws enable it to swallow prey whole , while its many rows of small , needle @-@ like teeth make it difficult for the prey to escape . It feeds mainly on cephalopods , leavened by bony fishes and other sharks . This species is aplacental viviparous : the embryos emerge from their egg capsules inside the mother 's uterus , where they survive primarily on yolk . The gestation period may be as long as three and a half years , the longest of any vertebrate . Litter sizes vary from two to fifteen , and there is no distinct breeding season . <unk> sharks are occasional bycatch in commercial fisheries , but have little economic value . The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as Near Threatened , since even incidental catches may deplete its population given its low reproductive rate . This shark , or a supposed giant relative , is a suggested source for reports of sea serpents . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The frilled shark was first scientifically recognized by German ichthyologist Ludwig <unk> , who visited Japan between 1879 and 1881 and brought two specimens to Vienna . However , his manuscript describing the species was lost , so the first description of the frilled shark was authored by American zoologist Samuel Garman , working from a 1 @.@ 5 @-@ metre ( 4 ft 11 in ) -long female caught from Sagami Bay in Japan . His account , " An Extraordinary Shark " , was published in an 1884 volume of Proceedings of the Essex Institute . Garman placed the new species in its own genus and family , and gave it the name Chlamydoselachus anguineus from the Greek <unk> ( " frill " ) and <unk> ( " shark " ) , and the Latin anguineus for " eel @-@ like " . Other common names for this species include frill shark , lizard shark , scaffold shark , and silk shark . 
 Several early authors believed the frilled shark to be a living representative of otherwise long @-@ extinct groups of elasmobranchs ( sharks , rays , and their ancestors ) , based on its multiple @-@ pointed teeth , the articulation of its upper jaw directly to the cranium behind the eyes ( called " <unk> " ) , and its " notochord @-@ like " spinal column with indistinct vertebrae . Garman proposed that it was allied with the " <unk> " , a now @-@ obsolete taxonomic grouping containing forms that thrived during the Palaeozoic era , such as Cladoselache from the Devonian period ( 416 – 359 Mya ) . His contemporaries Theodore Gill and Edward Drinker Cope suggested it was instead related to the <unk> , which were the dominant sharks during the Mesozoic era . Cope went as far as to assign this species to the fossil genus <unk> . 
 More recent investigations have found the similarities between the frilled shark and extinct groups may have been overstated or misinterpreted , and this shark exhibits a number of skeletal and muscular traits that firmly place it with the <unk> ( modern sharks and rays ) , and more specifically with the cow sharks in the order Hexanchiformes ( though <unk> Shigeru Shirai has proposed that it be placed in its own order , <unk> ) . Nevertheless , the frilled shark belongs to one of the oldest still @-@ extant shark lineages , dating back to at least the Late Cretaceous ( about 95 Mya ) and possibly to the Late Jurassic ( 150 Mya ) . Because of their ancient ancestry and " primitive " characteristics , the frilled shark and other members of this lineage have been described as a " living fossil " . However , the frilled shark itself is a relatively recent species , with the earliest known fossil teeth belonging to this species dating to the early Pleistocene epoch . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Rather uncommon , the frilled shark has been recorded from a number of widely scattered locations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans . In the eastern Atlantic , it occurs off northern Norway , northern Scotland , and western Ireland , from France to Morocco including Madeira , and off Mauritania . In the central Atlantic , it has been caught at several locations along the Mid @-@ Atlantic Ridge , from north of the Azores to the Rio Grande Rise off southern Brazil , as well as over the Vavilov Ridge off West Africa . In the western Atlantic , it has been reported from waters off New England , Georgia , and Suriname . In the western Pacific , it is known from southeastern Honshu , Japan , to Taiwan , off New South Wales and Tasmania in Australia , and around New Zealand . In the central and eastern Pacific , it has been found off Hawaii , California , and northern Chile . The frilled sharks off southern Africa were described as a different species , C. africana , in 2009 . 
 The frilled shark inhabits the outer continental shelf and upper to middle continental slope , seeming to favor upwellings and other biologically productive areas . Though it has been caught from a depth of 1 @,@ 570 m ( 5 @,@ 150 ft ) , it usually does not occur deeper than 1 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) . In Suruga Bay , it is most common at a depth of 50 – 200 m ( 160 – 660 ft ) , except from August to November when the temperature at the 100 m ( 330 ft ) water layer exceeds 15 ° C ( 59 ° F ) and the sharks shift into deeper water . On rare occasions , this species has been seen at the surface . The frilled shark is usually found close to the bottom , with one individual observed swimming over an area of small sand dunes . However , its diet suggests that it does make substantial forays upward into open water . This species may make vertical migrations , approaching the surface at night to feed . There is spatial segregation by size and reproductive condition . 
 = = Description = = 
 With its elongated , eel @-@ like body and strange appearance , the frilled shark has long been likened to the mythical sea serpent . The head is broad and flattened with a short , rounded snout . The nostrils are vertical slits , separated into incurrent and excurrent openings by a leading flap of skin . The moderately large eyes are horizontally oval and lack nictitating membranes ( protective third eyelids ) . The very long jaws are positioned terminally ( at the end of the snout ) , as opposed to the underslung jaws of most sharks . The corners of the mouth are devoid of furrows or folds . The tooth rows are rather widely spaced , numbering 19 – 28 in the upper jaw and 21 – 29 in the lower jaw . The teeth number around 300 in all ; each tooth is small , with three slender , needle @-@ like cusps alternating with two cusplets . There are six pairs of long gill slits with a " frilly " appearance created by the extended tips of the gill filaments , giving this shark its name . The first pair of gill slits meet across the throat , forming a " collar " . 
 The pectoral fins are short and rounded . The single , small dorsal fin is positioned far back on the body , about opposite the anal fin , and has a rounded margin . The pelvic and anal fins are large , broad , and rounded , and also positioned well back on the body . The caudal fin is very long and roughly triangular , without a lower lobe or a ventral notch on the upper lobe . There are a pair of thick skin folds of unknown function running along the belly , separated by a groove . The midsection is relatively longer in females than in males , with the pelvic fins pushed closer to the anal fin . The dermal denticles are small and shaped like the tip of a chisel , becoming enlarged and sharp on the dorsal margin of the caudal fin . This species is a uniform dark brown or gray . The frilled shark differs from its southern African relative , C. africana , in having more vertebrae ( 160 – 171 vs 147 ) and more turns in the spiral valve intestine ( 35 – 49 versus 26 – 28 ) , as well as in various proportional measurements such as a longer head and shorter gill slits . The maximum known length is 1 @.@ 7 m ( 5 @.@ 6 ft ) for males and 2 @.@ 0 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) for females . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 Highly specialized for life in the deep sea , the frilled shark has a reduced , poorly calcified skeleton and an enormous liver filled with low @-@ density lipids , allowing it to maintain its position in the water column with little effort . It is one of the few sharks with an " open " lateral line , in which the <unk> hair cells are positioned in grooves that are directly exposed to the surrounding seawater . This configuration is thought to be basal in sharks and may enhance its sensitivity to the minute movements of its prey . Many frilled sharks are found with the tips of their tails missing , probably from predatory attacks by other shark species . Parasites identified from this shark include a tapeworm in the genus <unk> , the fluke Otodistomum <unk> , and the nematode <unk> <unk> . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The long jaws of the frilled shark are highly distensible with an extremely wide gape , allowing it to swallow whole prey over one @-@ half its size . However , the length and articulation of its jaws means that it cannot deliver as strong a bite as more conventionally built sharks . Most captured individuals are found with no or barely identifiable stomach contents , suggesting a fast digestion rate and / or long intervals between feedings . This species preys on cephalopods , bony fishes , and smaller sharks . One 1 @.@ 6 m ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) long individual , caught off Chōshi , was found to have swallowed a 590 g ( 1 @.@ 30 lb ) Japanese catshark ( <unk> japonicus ) . Squid comprise some 60 % of the diet of sharks in Suruga Bay ; this includes not only slow @-@ moving , deep @-@ dwelling types , such as <unk> and Histioteuthis , but also relatively large , powerful swimmers of the open ocean , such as <unk> , <unk> , and Todarodes . 
 How the ostensibly weak @-@ swimming frilled shark captures active , fast @-@ moving squid is a matter of speculation . One possibility is that it takes advantage of injured squid , or those that are exhausted and dying after spawning . Alternatively , it may surprise its prey by curving its body and , bracing itself with its posteriorly positioned fins , launching a quick strike forward in the manner of a snake . It may also be able to close its gill slits and create negative pressure to suck prey into its mouth . The many small , sharp , recurved teeth of the frilled shark are functionally similar to squid jigs and could easily snag the body or tentacles of a squid , particularly as they are rotated outwards when the jaws are protruded . Observations of captive frilled sharks swimming with their mouths open suggest that the small teeth , light against the dark mouth , may even fool squid into attacking and entangling themselves . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 The frilled shark is aplacental viviparous ; the developing embryos are mainly nourished by yolk , though the difference in weight between the egg and the newborn indicates that the mother also provides additional nutrition via unknown means . Adult females have two functional ovaries and one functional uterus , on the right . Unsurprisingly , there is no defined breeding season for either sex , as this shark inhabits depths at which there is little to no seasonal influence . A possible mating aggregation of 15 male and 19 female sharks has been recorded over a seamount on the Mid @-@ Atlantic Ridge . The litter size ranges from two to fifteen , with an average of six . Females ovulate eggs into the uterus about once every two weeks ; vitellogenesis ( yolk formation ) and the growth of new ovarian eggs halt during pregnancy , apparently due to insufficient space inside the body cavity . 
 Newly ovulated eggs and early @-@ stage embryos are enclosed in a thin , ellipsoid , golden @-@ brown capsule . When the embryo is 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) long , the head is pointed when seen from above or below , the jaws are barely developed , the external gills have begun to appear , and all the fins are present . The egg capsule is shed when the embryo grows to 6 – 8 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 – 3 @.@ 1 in ) long , and is expelled from the female 's body ; at this time the embryo 's external gills are fully developed . The size of the yolk sac remains mostly constant until around an embryonic length of 40 cm ( 16 in ) , whereupon it begins to shrink , mostly or completely disappearing by an embryonic length of 50 cm ( 20 in ) . The embryonic growth rate averages 1 @.@ 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 55 in ) per month , and therefore the entire gestation period may last three and a half years , far longer than any other vertebrate . Newborn sharks measure 40 – 60 cm ( 16 – 24 in ) long ; males attain sexual maturity at 1 @.@ 0 – 1 @.@ 2 m ( 3 @.@ 3 – 3 @.@ 9 ft ) long , and females at 1 @.@ 3 – 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 3 – 4 @.@ 9 ft ) long . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 The frilled shark has seldom been encountered alive , and thus poses no danger to humans ( though scientists have accidentally cut themselves examining its teeth ) . On August 27 , 2004 , the first observation of this species in its natural habitat was made by the ROV Johnson Sea Link II , on the Blake Plateau off the southeastern United States . On January 21 , 2007 , a Japanese fisherman discovered a 1 @.@ 6 m ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) long female alive at the surface , perhaps there because of illness or weakness from the warm water . It was brought to <unk> Marine Park in Shizuoka , where it died after a few hours . Garman , and numerous authors since , have advanced the frilled shark as an explanation for sea serpent sightings . Because of the shark 's modest size , some <unk> have posited the existence of a giant relative , particularly as larger Chlamydoselachus species are known from the fossil record . 
 Small numbers of frill sharks are caught incidentally by various deepwater commercial fisheries around the world , using trawls , gillnets , and longlines . In particular , it is regularly taken in Suruga Bay in bottom gillnets meant for sea bream and <unk> , and in midwater trawls meant for the shrimp <unk> <unk> . Japanese fishermen regard it as a nuisance , as it damages the nets . This shark is sometimes sold for meat or processed into fishmeal , but is not economically significant . Because of its very low reproductive rate and the continuing expansion of commercial fisheries into its habitat , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed it as Near Threatened . 
 In December 2014 , trawler skipper David Guillot caught a 1 @.@ 5 metre frilled shark while ' fishing in water more than a kilometre deep near Lakes Entrance ' , in Victoria , Australia . The shark was taken to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation , where its identification was confirmed .

 Mom & Me & Mom ( 2013 ) is the seventh and final book in author Maya Angelou 's series of autobiographies . The book was published shortly before Mother 's Day and Angelou 's 85th birthday . It focuses , for the first time in her books , on Angelou 's relationship with her mother , Vivian Baxter . The book explains Baxter 's behavior , especially Baxter 's abandonment of Angelou and Angelou 's older brother when they were young children , and fills in " what are possibly the final blanks in Angelou 's eventful life " . The book also chronicles Angelou 's reunion and reconciliation with Baxter . Angelou was well @-@ respected as a poet and writer , and was one of the first African @-@ American female writers to openly discuss her life through autobiography . 
 Mom & Me & Mom is an overview of Angelou 's life and revisits many of the same anecdotes she relates in her previous books . The first section , entitled " Mom & Me " , centers on Angelou 's early years , before the age of 17 , and her transition from resentment and distrust of her mother to acceptance , support , and love towards her . After Baxter helps her through the birth of her son , Angelou goes from calling Baxter " Lady " to " Mom " . In the book 's second section , entitled " Me & Mom " , Angelou chronicles the unconditional love , support , and assistance they gave to each other , as Baxter helps her through single motherhood , a failed marriage , and career ups and downs . As she had begun to do in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings , and continued throughout her series , Angelou upheld the long traditions of African @-@ American autobiography . At the same time she made a deliberate attempt to challenge the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing , changing , and expanding the genre . She had become recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women . Angelou was , as scholar Joanne Braxton has stated , " without a doubt , ... America 's most visible black woman autobiographer " . She had also become " a major autobiographical voice of the time " . 
 Like Angelou 's previous autobiographies , Mom & Me & Mom received mostly positive reviews . Most reviewers state that Baxter is presented well in the book . Angelou celebrates the unconditional acceptance and support of her mother , who comes across " as a street @-@ smart , caring woman who shaped the author 's life and legacy by her words and example " . The book has been called " a profoundly moving tale of separation and reunion , and an ultimately optimistic portrait of the maternal bond " . 
 Pictures of Angelou , Baxter , and members of their family appear through the book and enhance the text . An audio version , read by Angelou , was released in CD form and as a digital download . 
 = = Background = = 
 Mom & Me & Mom ( 2013 ) is the seventh of Maya Angelou 's series of autobiographies . It was completed 11 years after the publication of her previous autobiography , A Song Flung Up to Heaven ( 2002 ) , and over thirty years after she wrote her first autobiography , I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings ( 1969 ) . Mom & Me & Mom , in which Angelou relates her relationship with her mother Vivian Baxter , was published shortly before Mother 's Day and Angelou 's 85th birthday . In the time period between the publication of her sixth and seventh autobiographies , Angelou was the first African @-@ American woman and living poet selected by Sterling Publishing , who placed 25 of her poems in a volume of their Poetry for Young People series in 2004 . In 2009 , Angelou wrote " We Had Him " , a poem about Michael Jackson , which was read by Queen Latifah at his funeral , and wrote " His Day is Done " , a poem honoring Nelson Mandela after his death in 2013 . She published a book of essays , Letter to My Daughter , in 2009 , and two cookbooks , Hallelujah ! The Welcome Table in 2004 and Great Food , All Day Long in 2010 . During this period , she was awarded the Lincoln Medal in 2008 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011 . 
 Angelou had become recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women and was , as scholar Joanne Braxton has stated , " without a doubt , ... America 's most visible black woman autobiographer " . She had also become " a major autobiographical voice of the time " . Angelou was one of the first African @-@ American female writers to publicly discuss her personal life , and one of the first to use herself as a central character in her books . Writer Julian Mayfield , who called her first autobiography " a work of art that eludes description " , stated that Angelou 's series set a precedent not only for other Black women writers , but for the genre of autobiography as a whole . Scholar Hilton Als called Angelou one of the " pioneers of self @-@ exposure " , willing to focus honestly on the more negative aspects of her personality and choices . For example , while Angelou was composing her second autobiography , Gather Together in My Name , she was concerned about how her readers would react to her disclosure that she had been a prostitute . Her husband Paul Du Feu talked her into publishing the book by encouraging her to " tell the truth as a writer " and to " be honest about it " . 
 For the first time , Angelou focuses on her relationship with her mother in this book , and fills in what reviewer Fiona Sturges calls " possibly the final blanks in Angelou 's eventful life " . According to Candace Smith , who reviewed the audio version of the book for Booklist , Angelou and Baxter 's relationship was " touched upon but never fully described " in Caged Bird , but Mom & Me & Mom explains Baxter 's actions , especially the reasons she sent Angelou and her older brother Bailey to live with their grandmother in Stamps , Arkansas . The book also chronicles Angelou 's initial uncomfortable reunion and eventual reconciliation with Baxter . Pictures of Baxter , Angelou , and their family and close friends appear throughout the book and enhance the text . An audio version of the book , read by Angelou , was released in CD form and as a digital download . 
 Angelou explains in the book 's prologue why she wrote the book , which was to explain how she became , despite being born poor , Black , and female , a renowned author and poet . The book is divided into two sections : the first 13 chapters are grouped into the first section , called " Mom & Me " , and the remaining chapters make up the second section , called " Me & Mom " . Angelou thanks her mother , " who generously taught me how to be a mother " , which allowed her to dedicate the book to her son , Guy Bailey Johnson , whom she calls " one of the most courageous and generous men I know " . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 Angelou 's mother , Vivian Baxter , was born in St. Louis , Missouri , at the turn of the 20th century , the oldest of six children of her Trinidadian father and her Irish mother . Baxter 's family was violent , yet religious and musical . Baxter , " who was to remain a startling beauty " , met Angelou 's father , Bailey Johnson , a dietitian and cook , in 1924 , upon Johnson 's return from serving in World War I. They married and moved to California , where Angelou and her older brother , Bailey , Jr . , were born . When she was three and Bailey was five , their parents divorced and sent their children , by train with identification tags and no adult supervision , to live with their paternal grandmother , Annie Henderson , in Stamps , Arkansas . 
 Angelou and her brother lived with their grandmother and her son , Uncle Willie , until Angelou was thirteen . They briefly visited their mother in St. Louis , but at the age of eight Angelou was raped , and in retaliation the rapist was killed by members of her family . She felt so guilty for his death that she chose to stop talking to everyone but Bailey for several years . They were sent back to Stamps , but when Bailey turned 14 , they returned to their mother 's care in San Francisco for his protection . At first , Angelou was resistant and angry towards her mother for abandoning her and Bailey , choosing to call her " Lady " , and it took her several years to warm to her . 
 One summer , Bailey and Angelou made separate trips to visit their father in San Diego , in what Kirkus Reviews called " a seriously ugly meeting " . Angelou did not get along with her stepmother . During her visit , her father took Angelou to Mexico ; he became so drunk , she had to drive him back across the border , even though she had never driven a car before . When they returned to San Diego , Angelou 's stepmother cut Angelou with a pair of scissors during an argument . Angelou chose to live on the streets until her wound was healed . When she returned to San Francisco , she decided she wanted a job as a streetcar conductor ; at first , she was not hired because she was Black , but upon her mother 's encouragement , she was persistent with the streetcar company until she became the first Black to work on the railway . Baxter provided security by following Angelou with a pistol . 
 When Angelou was seventeen , she became pregnant after a one @-@ time encounter with a neighbor boy . She told Bailey , who advised her to hide it from their mother and stepfather until she graduated from high school . Three weeks before the birth of her son , she told them . Baxter 's reaction was to run a bath ; as Angelou said , " In our family , for some unknown reason , we consider it an honor to run a bath , to put in bubbles and good scents for another person " . Baxter helped Angelou through the birth ; from then on , Angelou began to call her " Mother " , and later , " Mom " . 
 The rest of the book consists of a series of anecdotes about the ways that Baxter supported and accepted her daughter and continued to win her love and respect , through unwed motherhood , a failed marriage , and career ups and downs . Angelou relates several stories of Baxter , including her support of Angelou as an independent single mother , her life @-@ saving intervention after a jealous ex @-@ boyfriend beat Angelou , and her initial resistance and then acceptance of Angelou 's first marriage to Greek sailor Tosh Angelos . Angelou recounts the beginning of her career as a dancer and entertainer in San Francisco ; Baxter cared for her grandson as Angelou traveled Europe as a member of the Gershwin opera Porgy and Bess . Angelou felt so guilty about leaving her son that she returned and resumed her relationship with her mother and son , eventually moving to New York City and starting a new career as a writer and poet . 
 Angelou relates , with pride , her mother 's social activities , in the Order of the Eastern Star and black women 's charitable organizations in Stockton , California , as well as her career as one of the first black female merchant marines . At one point , Baxter drops everything and comes to her daughter 's aid while Angelou was working on a movie in Stockholm . Baxter supports Angelou 's decision to live in Africa for a while and then , after Angelou returned to the U.S. , to become a teacher at Wake Forest University in Winston @-@ Salem , North Carolina . Angelou describes Baxter 's marriage , late in her life , to Angelou 's fourth stepfather , whom Baxter called her greatest love and who was Angelou 's favorite . There is a difficult scene between Angelou and her brother , who despite his seemingly easy reentry into their mother 's life when they were teenagers ( she calls them " the new lovers " ) , had descended into struggles with drug abuse . 
 Angelou closes Mom & Me & Mom with a description of Vivian Baxter 's death in 1991 , and of Angelou 's final words to her on her deathbed . In 1995 , the city of Stockton honored Baxter for her many years of service by naming a park after her . 
 = = Style and genre = = 
 Starting with Caged Bird , Angelou made a deliberate attempt while writing all her autobiographies , including Mom & Me & Mom , to challenge the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing , changing , and expanding the genre . Her use of fiction @-@ writing techniques such as dialogue , characterization , and thematic development has often led reviewers to categorize her books as autobiographical fiction . Valerie Sayers , in her review of Mom & Me & Mom in The Washington Post , calls Angelou 's books memoirs because of their limited focus , but praises her for describing what it was like to grow up Black in " Jim Crow America " . Sayers states : " She manages to fully reveal that national sore without picking at it , a neat trick that ... requires considerable restraint and her own steely goodwill " . Angelou stated in a 1989 interview that she was the only " serious " writer to choose the genre to express herself . As critic Susan Gilbert stated , Angelou was reporting not one person 's story , but the collective 's . Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe agreed , and viewed Angelou as representative of the convention in African @-@ American autobiography as a public gesture that spoke for an entire group of people . Angelou 's editor Robert Loomis was able to convince her to write Caged Bird by challenging her to write an autobiography that could be considered " high art " , which she continued throughout her series . Although Angelou was successful , she was , as Sayers insisted , smart and gifted enough to write for any audience , but chose not to write for " a highbrow literary audience " , but for " readers as open , playful and straightforward as herself " . 
 Angelou 's autobiographies conform to the genre 's standard structure : they are written by a single author , they are chronological , and they contain elements of character , technique , and theme . In a 1983 interview with African @-@ American literature critic Claudia Tate , Angelou called her books autobiographies . When speaking of her unique use of the genre , she acknowledged that she has followed the slave narrative tradition of " speaking in the first @-@ person singular talking about the first @-@ person plural , always saying I meaning ' we ' " . Angelou recognized that there were fictional aspects to all her books ; she tended to " diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth " . Her approach paralleled the conventions of many African @-@ American autobiographies written during the abolitionist period in the US , when truth was often censored for purposes of self @-@ protection . Author Lyman B. Hagen has placed Angelou in the long tradition of African @-@ American autobiography , but insisted that she has created a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form . 
 In a 1998 interview with journalist George Plimpton , Angelou discussed her writing process , and " the sometimes slippery notion of truth in nonfiction " and memoirs . When asked if she changed the truth to improve her story , she stated , " Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite of three or four people , because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about . " Although Angelou has never admitted to changing the facts in her stories , she has used these facts to make an impact with the reader . As Hagen stated , " One can assume that ' the essence of the data ' is present in Angelou 's work " . Hagen also stated that Angelou " fictionalizes , to enhance interest " . Angelou 's long @-@ time editor , Robert Loomis , states that she could rewrite any of her books by changing the order of her facts to make a different impact on the reader . Like Caged Bird , the events in Mom & Me & Mom and the rest of her autobiographies are episodic and crafted as a series of short stories , yet do not follow a strict chronology , something that Angelou uses to compel her readers forward . Sayers agrees , saying that Angelou pays little attention to chronological order in the book . Sayers also states , " Time races through this narrative " . Major characters , like Angelou 's stepfather Daddy <unk> , disappear after their initial mention . Even though Angelou repeats many anecdotes found in her earlier autobiographies , the focus in Mom & Me & Mom is on her mother ; according to reviewer Stacy Russo , " that focus makes this a distinct addition to Angelou 's autobiographical writings " . Reviewer Pam Kingsbury , who highly recommended the book for all audiences , stated those familiar with Angelou 's previous works " will be rewarded with a more complete picture of her life " , while new readers " will discover a well @-@ crafted and insightful introduction to the author " . 
 Critics have judged Mom & Me & Mom and Angelou 's other autobiographies " in light of the first " , and Caged Bird generally receives the highest praise . Marjorie <unk> of The Christian Science Monitor , considers the book a sequel to Caged Bird . Many of the events described in Angelou 's previous autobiographies are revisited in this one , some with more detail than others , such as her period of homelessness , which was described in Caged Bird , and her serious beating by her jealous boyfriend , which was first disclosed in Letter to My Daughter ( 2008 ) , Angelou 's third book of essays . According to Fiona Sturges , who reviewed Mom & Me & Mom in the British publication The Independent , " As in her previous books , these tales are told with clear @-@ sightedness and an absence of self @-@ pity , and they are no less grim for their familiarity . Angelou has never been one for florid prose , and here she maintains a precise and economical style which makes these bleak moments more vivid , like a film from which you can 't look away " . Sayers states that major dramatic events , such as the incident when Angelou was beaten , " are delivered without much amplification or further reference " . 
 Angelou describes her writing process as regimented . Beginning with Caged Bird , she has used the same " writing ritual " for many years . She gets up at five in the morning and checks into a hotel room , where the staff has been instructed to remove any pictures from the walls . She writes on legal pads while lying on the bed , with a bottle of sherry , a deck of cards to play solitaire , Roget 's Thesaurus , and the Bible , and leaves by the early afternoon . She averages 10 – 12 pages of material a day , which she edits down to three or four pages in the evening . Angelou goes through this process to " enchant " herself , and as she said in a 1989 interview with the BBC , to " relive the agony , the anguish , the Sturm und Drang " . She places herself back in the time she is writing about , even during traumatic experiences like her rape in Caged Bird , to " tell the human truth " about her life . Angelou has stated that she plays cards to reach that place of enchantment , to access her memories more effectively . She has stated , " It may take an hour to get into it , but once I 'm in it — ha ! It 's so delicious ! " She does not find the process cathartic ; rather , she has found relief in " telling the truth " .

 Mom & Me & Mom debuted at number 8 on The New York Times bestseller list the week of its release , April 21 , 2013 . The book , like Angelou 's previous autobiographies , received mostly positive reviews . Fiona Sturges , who reviews the book in the British publication The Independent , and reviewer Stacy Russo of Library Journal both state that Angelou 's readers would recognize many of the passages in Mom & Me & Mom from her earlier autobiographies . Bernardine Evaristo of the British publication The Observer , in one of the few negative reviews of Mom & Me & Mom , calls the book " a slight , anecdotal and badly edited book that rehashes stories from previous memoirs " . Evaristo questions the veracity of Angelou 's anecdotes , and states that some of them contradict earlier versions . Evaristo also believes that Mom & Me & Mom undermines Caged Bird , which she calls " a ground @-@ breaking triumph " . 
 According to reviewer <unk> Erdrich , Mom & Me & Mom does not center on Angelou 's childhood trauma , as described in Caged Bird , but " rather constructs a portrait of self via details of her relationship to the mother who abandoned her and with whom she reunited as a teenager " . Erdrich states that Angelou 's prose is " very simply written " , and calls her tone " mostly light , even sweet , filled with affection for her younger self " . Erdrich states that even though it could have been written for young women experiencing the same difficulties Angelou faced , the book does not preach , but " presents Angelou ’ s life path scattered with enormous obstacles endured and conquered through knowledge of self and a singular brand of mother love " . Publishers Weekly agrees , stating , " The lessons and love presented here will speak to those trying to make their way in the world " . Erdrich also states that Angelou 's narrative of her " hard @-@ won love for her extraordinary mother " is compelling , and that Angelou portrays Baxter " as extraordinarily self @-@ aware , liberated from what others might think , and independent beyond any feminist of her era " and " the stuff of fiction but real and responsible in unexpected ways for the gift of her talented daughter " . 
 Most critics feel that Baxter is presented well in Mom & Me & Mom . Candace Smith , who reviews the audio version of the book , states that Angelou celebrates the unconditional acceptance and support of her mother , who comes across " as a street @-@ smart , caring woman who shaped the author 's life and legacy by her words and example " . Vanessa Bush of Booklist calls the book a " loving recollection of a complicated relationship " and a " remarkable and deeply revealing chronicle of love and healing " . Russo states that the book is " a beautiful tribute to Baxter 's independent , vibrant , and courageous spirit " . Evaristo disagrees , and states that Baxter comes across as " less rounded , less interesting , more sanctified and less credible " than Angelou describes her elsewhere . Sturges calls the book " a profoundly moving tale of separation and reunion , and an ultimately optimistic portrait of the maternal bond " . The most interesting part of the book , according to Sturges , is " Angelou 's casual overturning of the idea of the mother who abandons her children as monstrous and inhumane " . Sturges also says that Baxter is presented as unapologetic , charismatic , independent , and resilient , traits that " have seemingly been passed on to her daughter " . Reviewer Valerie Sayers insists that the scenes that depict Angelou 's " halting steps " towards her forgiveness and acceptance of her mother are among the best in the book . Sayers labels Mom & Me & Mom " an account of forgiveness " , and like Angelou and Baxter , " just revealing enough , and pretty irresistible " . Like her mother expected from her , Angelou expects her readers to move past their resentments and " whatever was unbearable " . Sayers also calls both Baxter and Angelou " a Large Dramatic Presence " , and says that Angelou matches her mother 's spirit . 
 According to Sayers , the book contains Angelou 's " trademark good humor and fierce optimism " . Kirkus Reviews states that true to Angelou 's style , her writing " cuts to the chase with compression and simplicity " , and that it contains a " calypso smoothness , flurries and showers of musicality between the moments of wickedness " . Kirkus also calls the book a " tightly strung , finely tuned memoir " . According to Candace Smith in her review of the book 's audio version , Angelou performs it " in her characteristic slow and thoughtful tones , and with careful enunciation " . Although some of her anecdotes are painful to hear , Angelou is " unquestionably honest " . Smith also states , " Although her voice doesn 't show much outward emotion , her words are so powerful and the stories so fascinating that we remain riveted " . 
 Most critics agreed that the book would be popular with readers familiar with Angelou 's writings and to her new readers . Marjorie <unk> of The Christian Science Monitor , who calls it " a story of redemption " and " a tender read and a lovely tribute " , anticipates that Angelou 's readers would delight in it . Russo predicts that due to Angelou 's popularity and " approachable writing " , the book would have wide appeal for many readers .

 = Stranger in Moscow = 
 " Stranger in Moscow " is a song by American recording artist Michael Jackson from his ninth studio album HIStory : Past , Present and Future , Book I. The song was released worldwide in November 1996 , but was not released in the United States until August 1997 by Epic Records . The track was written by Jackson in September 1993 , at the height of the highly publicized child abuse accusations made against him , while on the Dangerous World Tour stop in Moscow . It was originally written as a poem by Jackson , then adapted into a song . 
 The song 's music video depicts the lives of six individuals , including Jackson , who are left isolated and disconnected from the world around them . This is Jackson 's lowest charting song on the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at 91 . The song was performed on the HIStory World Tour in 1996 – 97 . It was covered a few times by other artists . 
 = = Context , production and music = = 
 In the book The Many Faces of Michael Jackson , author Lee Pinkerton , like many other reviewers , noted that HIStory 's album tracks like " Stranger in Moscow " were Jackson 's response to recent events in his personal life . In 1993 , the relationship between Jackson and the press soured entirely when he was accused of child sexual abuse . Although never charged with a crime , Jackson was subject to intense media scrutiny while the criminal investigation took place . Complaints about the coverage and media included using sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline , accepting stories of Jackson 's alleged criminal activity in return for money , accepting leaked material from the police investigation in return for money paid , deliberately using pictures of Jackson 's appearance at its worst , a lack of objectivity and using headlines that strongly implied Jackson 's guilt . 
 At the time , Jackson said of the media reaction , " I will say I am particularly upset by the handling of the matter by the incredible , terrible mass media . At every opportunity , the media has dissected and manipulated these allegations to reach their own conclusions " . A few months after the allegations became news , Jackson had lost approximately 10 pounds ( 4 @.@ 5 kg ) in weight and had stopped eating . Jackson 's health had deteriorated to the extent that he canceled the remainder of his Dangerous World Tour and went into rehabilitation . Jackson booked the whole fourth floor of the clinic , and was put on a Valium IV to wean him from painkillers . The singer 's spokesperson told reporters that Jackson was " barely able to function adequately on an intellectual level " . While in the clinic , Jackson took part in group and one @-@ on @-@ one therapy sessions . 
 When Jackson left the US to go into rehabilitation , the media showed the singer little sympathy . The Daily Mirror held a " Spot the Jacko " contest , offering readers a trip to Walt Disney World if they could correctly predict where the entertainer would appear next . A Daily Express headline read , " Drug Treatment Star Faces Life on the Run " , while a News of the World headline accused Jackson of being a fugitive . These tabloids also falsely alleged that Jackson had traveled to Europe to have cosmetic surgery that would make him unrecognizable on his return . Geraldo Rivera set up a mock trial , with a jury made up of audience members , even though Jackson had not been charged with a crime . 
 " Stranger in Moscow " is an R & B ballad , penned by Jackson in 1993 during his Dangerous World Tour stop in Moscow . The instrumental portion of the song is based on the end credits theme of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 ( 1994 ) , a video game which Jackson and his tour keyboardist Brad Buxer were brought in to compose music for . Jackson dropped out of the project after scandals involving him arose around this time . The lyrics for the song are based upon a poem written by Jackson . A background guitar was played by Steve Lukather while keyboards , synthesizers and bass are credited to David Paich and Steve Porcaro . Originally , HIStory was planned as a greatest hits release , with a few new tracks . However , Jackson and his collaborators were so pleased with the result of " Stranger in Moscow " that they decided to give HIStory a full studio album as the second disc . Jackson used elements of Russian imagery and symbolism to help promote the concept of fear and alienation in the track , in a similar fashion to Simply Red 's album Love and the Russian Winter several years later . It concludes with a narrative , spoken in Russian , by a KGB interrogator ( Ed <unk> ) . The narrative , translated into English is , " Why have you come from the west ? Confess ! To steal the great achievements of the people , the accomplishments of the workers ... " . 
 = = Music and critical reception = = 
 Stranger in Moscow has a tempo of 66 beats per minute , making it one of Jackson 's slowest songs . The song received praise from music reviewers and producers . James Hunter of Rolling Stone commented " [ Jackson is ] angry , miserable , tortured , inflammatory , furious about what he calls , in ' Stranger in Moscow ' , a ' swift and sudden fall from grace ' ... HIStory feels like the work of someone with a bad case of Thriller nostalgia . Occasionally this backward focus works to Jackson 's advantage : On ' Stranger in Moscow ' he remembers the synth @-@ pop ' 80s while constructing wracked claims of danger and loneliness that rival any Seattle rocker 's pain . " 
 Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated , " The ballads are lavishly melodic . ' Stranger In Moscow ' , with odd lyrics like ' Stalin 's tomb won 't let me be , ' has a gorgeous chorus for the repeated question " How does it feel ? " . Fred Shuster of the Daily News of Los Angeles described it as , " a lush , gorgeous minor @-@ key ballad with one of the album 's catchiest choruses " 
 Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic noted of HIStory , " Jackson produces some well @-@ crafted pop that ranks with his best material ... ' Stranger in Moscow ' is one of his most haunting ballads . Longtime collaborator Bruce Swedien , has described " Stranger in Moscow " as one of the best songs Jackson had ever done . Patrick Macdonald of The Seattle Times described " Stranger in Moscow " as " a pretty ballad interspersed with sounds of rain . " Further praise came in 2005 when it was felt that the song had successfully portrayed " eerie loneliness " and was characterized as beautiful by Josephine <unk> of PopMatters . Tom <unk> of the Associated Press described it as " [ a ] ethereal and stirring description of a man wounded by a ' swift and sudden fall from grace ' walking in the shadow of the Kremlin " . 
 Chris Willman of Los Angeles Times stated " ' Stranger in Moscow ' , is a step removed from the focused paranoia of much of the rest of the album , more akin to the deeper , fuzzier dread of a past perennial like ' Billie Jean ' . Jackson imagines himself alone and adrift in a psychic Russia , pre @-@ glasnost , hunted by an unseen KGB : ' Here abandoned in my fame / Armageddon of the brain ' , he sings in the somber , constricted verses , before a sweeping coda kicks up four minutes in and the <unk> suddenly breaks his cool to wail about a desolate , inconsolable loneliness . Here , in this song , is the real genius — and probably real personhood — of Michael Jackson " . 
 Rod Temperton , one of Jackson 's songwriters from his earlier career , believes that this is his best song . 
 = = Music video plot and influence = = 
 The song 's music video , directed by Nick Brandt , and shot in Los Angeles , is focused around six unrelated people living in a cityscape while the rest of the world moves around them in slow motion . The first half of the video introduces these figures . Five of the figures are a man looking down at the city from his bedroom window , a woman sitting alone in a coffee shop , a homeless man lying on the damp street , a lone figure feeding pigeons , and a boy ostracized from a game of baseball . The sixth figure is Jackson himself , seen walking the city streets while he sings . Special effects are used to show birds and wasps flying , glass breaking and coffee spilling , all in slow motion . 
 In the second half of the scenario , heavy rain descends on the city and the citizens try to flee , all again seen in slow motion . From the safety of shelter , the six " strangers " watch everyone 's futile attempts to avoid the sudden change in weather . Eventually they decide to go outside , where they look up at the sky and allow the rain to soak them . The video ends with Michael whipping his hair . During this scene , you hear a voicing softly in Russian , a reference to Moscow . 
 The music video also appears on Jackson 's video albums HIStory on Film , Volume II and Michael Jackson 's Vision . 
 Jackson 's biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli , has stated that the video is based on Jackson 's real life . He used to walk alone at night looking for new friends , even at the peak of his musical popularity . The 1980s saw him become deeply unhappy ; Jackson explained , " Even at home , I 'm lonely . I sit in my room sometimes and cry . It 's so hard to make friends ... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night , just hoping to find someone to talk to . But I just end up coming home . " 
 = = Live performances = = 
 Jackson first performed the song during the HIStory World Tour , which also turned out to be the last live performance of the song . Jackson always performed the song wearing golden jacket and pants . The song was always <unk> , instead focusing on Jackson 's robotic and gliding dance moves .

 = Zanzibar women 's national football team = 
 The Zanzibar women 's national football team , nicknamed the " Zanzibar Queens " , is the women 's representative team from Zanzibar , a semi @-@ autonomous part of Tanzania . Founded in 1988 , the team has limited recognition as the regional governing body , the Zanzibar Football Association , is a full member of the Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations ( CECAFA ) and Confederation of African Football ( CAF ) , but Zanzibar Football Association is not recognised by Fédération Internationale de Football Association ( FIFA ) as an independent national association . The national team was supposed to have its first international matches in the CECAFA Women 's Challenge Cup in October 2007 , but the event was cancelled . The team plays domestically against men 's sides in Zanzibar . The development of women 's football in Zanzibar faces several challenges specific to Africa and their own islands , including efforts to politicize the game . 
 = = Background and development of women 's football = = 
 Zanzibar is a territory consisting of two main islands , Unguja / Zanzibar and Pemba , and is a semi @-@ autonomous part of Tanzania with its own government . As of the 2002 census , it had a total population of 984 @,@ 625 . Women 's football in Africa has not developed compared to elsewhere because of a variety of factors , including limited access to education , poverty amongst women in the wider society , and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses . Another problem with the development of the game throughout the continent is that higher ability players leave to play in Europe or the United States . According to Kuhn , funding for the game on a regional level is problematic as national associations do not fund the women 's game adequately . 
 Zanzibar has unique problems relating to the development of the women 's game including pressures for female players to wear the hijab while playing and pressure from male family members not to participate as their involvement may bring shame to the family . There is minimal support for the game at schools , with the national federation not responding to requests from the national team coach to work harder to get girls to play the sport in school . A national women 's league was created in 2004 after a 26 @-@ year effort . Five teams competed in the inaugural season : Women Fighters , <unk> FC , <unk> Sisters , <unk> Sisters and <unk> FC . Women Fighters won the first two editions of the league , however , the league has since collapsed . 
 = = Team = = 
 Founded in 1988 by <unk> Juma Mohammed of Tanzania , the Women Fighters was Zanzibar 's first women 's football club , which the national team was built on , and the team was created at a time when there were very few women 's national teams in existence . Prior to 1988 , women had played informally or on men 's only teams ; several of these players , as well as those from other sports , including badminton , made up the inaugural team . The team soon played a game against the touring Swedish women 's club side , <unk> FF in Zanzibar 's largest football stadium , losing the game 0 – 15 at <unk> Stadium . At the time the team was created , there were few opportunities for it to compete against other women 's teams in Zanzibar , but they have played and sometimes beaten men 's teams in Zanzibar while receiving support from the Zanzibar Football Association and Zanzibar 's Ministry of Sport . The players do not wear a hijab or cover up as part of their kit , which has led to criticism from religious leaders for playing in public while wearing shorts and jersey tops , instead of covering their bodies according to Muslim custom . The team trains in Stone Town at the Mao Tse Tung Stadium . Player recruitment and retention has been a problem because some members of the national team have been prohibited from playing by their husbands or family members . Male relatives of the Fighters team have beaten players because they " disgrace them " . National team players are eligible to play for Tanzania in all competitions . Aziza <unk> and Sabai Yusuf are two Zanzibar based players who have participated in a Tanzanian national team training camp . As of 2011 , Mohammed remained the team 's head coach . 
 The national association , founded in 1926 , is recognised by the Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations ( CECAFA ) , but not by Fédération Internationale de Football Association ( FIFA ) despite repeated attempts for such recognition . The federation is a member of CAF and the national team is limited in their ability to compete in sanctioned events by these organisations . 
 Zanzibar were meant to play in the inaugural CECAFA Women 's Challenge Cup in October 2007 , but the tournament was ultimately cancelled because of an inability to attain funding from CECAFA to cover costs connected to the competition . The competition was to have been jointly funded by CAF and CECAFA . The CECAFA secretary , Nicholas Musonye said of the event , " CAF wants to develop women football in this region in recognition of the milestones CECAFA has achieved over the years . CAF appreciates what CECAFA has done despite the hardships the association has gone through , from financial problems to political instability in member states and poor management of associations . Member states in the CECAFA region have not taken women 's football seriously . CAF now wants to sponsor a long @-@ term campaign to attract women from this region into the game . " 
 In 2007 , a movie was made about the team called Zanzibar Soccer Queens . The film was featured at the BFI London Film Festival in 2007 . 
 = Wordless novel = 
 The wordless novel is a narrative genre that uses sequences of captionless pictures to tell a story . As artists have often made such books using woodcut and other relief printing techniques , the terms woodcut novel or novel in woodcuts are also used . The genre flourished primarily in the 1920s and 1930s and was most popular in Germany . 
 The wordless novel has its origin in the German Expressionist movement of the early 20th century . The typically socialist work drew inspiration from mediaeval woodcuts and used the awkward look of that medium to express angst and frustration at social injustice . The first such book was the Belgian Frans Masereel 's 25 Images of a Man 's Passion , published in 1918 . The German Otto Nückel and other artists followed Masereel 's example . Lynd Ward brought the genre to the United States in 1929 when he produced Gods ' Man , which inspired other American wordless novels and a parody in 1930 by cartoonist Milt Gross with He Done Her Wrong . Following an early @-@ 1930s peak in production and popularity , the genre waned in the face of competition from sound films and anti @-@ socialist censorship in Nazi Germany and the US . 
 Following World War II , new examples of wordless novels became increasingly rare , and early works went out of print . Interest began to revive in the 1960s when the American comics fandom subculture came to see wordless novels as prototypical book @-@ length comics . In the 1970s , the example of the wordless novel inspired cartoonists such as Will Eisner and Art Spiegelman to create book @-@ length non @-@ genre comics — " graphic novels " . Cartoonists such as Eric Drooker and Peter Kuper took direct inspiration from wordless novels to create wordless graphic novels . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Wordless novels use sequences of expressive images to tell a story . Socialist themes of struggle against capitalism are common ; scholar Perry Willett calls these themes " a unifying element of the genre 's aesthetic " . In both formal and moral aspects , they draw from Expressionist graphics , theatre , and film . Wordless novelists such as Frans Masereel appropriated the awkward aesthetic of mediaeval woodcuts to express their anguish and revolutionary political ideas and used simple , traditional iconography . Text is restricted to title and chapter pages , except where text is a part of the scene , such as in signs . 
 The storytelling tends to be melodramatic , and the stories tend to focus on struggles against social oppression in which characters are silenced by economic , political , and other social forces . The characters are clearly delineated as good or evil — the good drawn sympathetically and the evil with the contempt of the artist 's moral indignation . 
 Most wordless novelists were not prolific ; few besides Masereel and Lynd Ward produced more than a single book . The books were designed to be mass @-@ produced for a popular audience , in contrast to similar but shorter portfolios by artists such as Otto Dix , George Grosz , and Käthe Kollwitz , which were produced in limited editions for collectors . These portfolios of typically from eight to ten prints also were meant to be viewed in sequence . Wordless novels were longer , had more complex narratives , and were printed in sizes and dimensions comparable to those of novels . A large influence was the most popular silent visual medium of the time : silent films . Panning , zooming , slapstick , and other filmic techniques are found in the books ; Ward said that in creating a wordless novel , he first had to visualize it in his head as a silent film . 
 Typically , wordless novels used relief printing techniques such as woodcuts , wood engraving , <unk> , or linocuts . One of the oldest printing techniques , relief printing has its origins in 8th @-@ century China and was introduced to Europe in the 15th century . It requires an artist to draw or transfer an image to a printing block ; the areas not to be printed ( the white areas ) are cut away , leaving raised areas to which ink is applied to make prints . The monochrome prints were usually in black ink , and occasionally in a different colour such as sienna or orange . Relief printing is an inexpensive but labour @-@ intensive printing technique ; it was accessible to socially conscious artists who wanted to tell wordless stories of the working classes . 
 = = History = = 
 In 15th @-@ century mediaeval Europe , woodcut block books were printed as religious guides ; particularly popular was the Ars moriendi . The early 16th century saw block books disappear in favour of books printed with the movable type of Gutenberg 's presses . Woodcut printing persisted into the 16th century under artists such as Dürer , Holbein , and Amman , after which engraving techniques superseded woodcuts . Pioneered by Thomas Bewick , wood engraving enjoyed popularity beginning in the 18th century , until the method gave way by the 19th century to more advanced printing methods such as lithography . 
 Post @-@ impressionist artist Paul Gauguin revived woodcut printing in the late @-@ 19th century , favouring it for its primitivist effect . Early in the 20th century , woodcut artists such as Käthe Kollwitz ( 1867 – 1945 ) and Max Klinger ( 1857 – 1920 ) published portfolios of woodcuts , thematically linked by themes of social injustice . Expressionist graphic artists such as Max Beckmann ( 1884 – 1950 ) , Otto Dix ( 1891 – 1969 ) , Kollwitz , and Karl Schmidt @-@ Rottluff ( 1884 – 1976 ) were inspired by an early @-@ 20th @-@ century revival of interest in mediaeval graphic arts — in particular Biblical woodcut prints such as the Biblia pauperum . These artists used the awkward look of woodcut images to express feelings of anguish .

 The wordless novel grew out of the Expressionist movement . The Belgian Frans Masereel ( 1889 – 1972 ) created the earliest example , 25 Images of a Man 's Passion , in 1918 . It was a commercial success and was followed by Passionate Journey , which at 167 images was Masereel 's longest book . It was also the most commercially successful , particularly in Germany , where copies of his books sold in the hundreds of thousands throughout the 1920s and had introductions by writers such as Max Brod , Hermann Hesse , and Thomas Mann . Masereel 's books drew strongly on Expressionist theatre and film in their exaggerated but representational artwork with strong contrasts of black and white . 
 Masereel 's commercial success led other artists to try their hands at the genre ; themes of oppression under capitalism were prominent , a pattern set early by Masereel . At age thirteen , Polish @-@ French artist Balthus drew a wordless story about his cat ; it was published in 1921 with an introduction by poet Rainer Maria Rilke . In Destiny ( 1926 ) , Otto Nückel ( 1888 – 1955 ) produced a work with greater nuance and atmosphere than Masereel 's bombastic works ; where Masereel told tales of Man 's struggle against Society , Nückel told of the life of an individual woman . Destiny appeared in a US edition in 1930 and sold well there . 
 Clément Moreau ( 1903 – 1988 ) first tried his hand at the genre with the six @-@ plate Youth Without Means in 1928 . István <unk> @-@ <unk> ( 1892 – 1959 ) , a Hungarian immigrant to England , made a wordless book in brush and ink called My War ( 1931 ) . In simple artwork reminiscent of Japanese brush painting , <unk> @-@ <unk> told of a Hungarian cavalryman disillusioned by his World War I experiences . Helena <unk> @-@ <unk> ( 1894 – 1980 ) was the first woman to produce a wordless novel , Childhood ( 1931 ) , which presented middle @-@ class life , rather than the working @-@ class struggle found in the works of Masereel or Nückel . <unk> described her books as " cycles " rather than novels . Surrealist artist Max Ernst made the silent collage novel Une <unk> de <unk> in 1934 . Following World War II , Werner <unk> ( 1890 – 1968 ) , a member of the German Expressionist group Die Brücke , produced The Tightrope Walker and the Clown ( 1949 ) . 
 = = = In North America = = = 
 In 1926 , the American Lynd Ward ( 1905 – 1985 ) moved to Leipzig to study graphic arts ; while there , he discovered the works of Masereel and Otto Nückel . He produced six such works of his own ; he preferred to call them " pictorial narratives " . The first , Gods ' Man ( 1929 ) , was his most popular . Ward used wood engraving rather than woodcutting and varied image sizes from page to page . Gods ' Man sold 20 @,@ 000 copies , and other American artists followed up on this success with their own wordless novels in the 1930s . 
 Cartoonist Milt Gross 's He Done Her Wrong ( 1930 ) was a parody of the genre ; the book uses varying panel designs akin to those of comics : the action sometimes takes place outside the panel borders and " dialogue balloons " show in images what the characters are saying . Cartoonist and illustrator William Gropper 's <unk> @-@ oop ( 1930 ) tells of three entertainers ' disappointed dreams . In Abraham Lincoln : Biography in Woodcuts ( 1933 ) Charles <unk> documented the American president . Animator Myron Waldman ( 1908 – 2006 ) wrote a wordless tale of a plump young woman looking for a glamorous husband . The book , Eve ( 1943 ) , also uses " picture balloons " as He Done Her Wrong does . 
 Inspired by mediaeval religious block books and working in an Art Deco style , American illustrator James Reid ( 1907 – 1989 ) produced one wordless novel , The Life of Christ ( 1930 ) ; due to the book 's religious content , the Soviet Union barred its importation under its policies on religion . 
 In 1938 , Italian @-@ American Giacomo Patri ( 1898 – 1978 ) produced his only wordless novel , the linocut White Collar . It chronicles the aftermath of the 1929 stock market crash and was intended to motivate white @-@ collar workers to unionize . It also deals with controversial topics such as abortion , accessibility of health care for the poor , and loss of Christian faith . From 1948 to 1951 , Canadian Laurence Hyde ( 1914 – 1987 ) produced his single wordless novel , the woodcut Southern Cross , in response to the American atomic tests in the Bikini Atoll . The work tells of an American evacuation of an island for nuclear tests , where one family is left behind . Polish @-@ American Si <unk> 's ( 1918 – ) first book , The Parade : A Story in 55 Drawings ( 1957 ) , won praise from Albert Einstein for its anti @-@ war message . Canadian George <unk> 's Aphrodite 's Cup ( 1964 ) is an erotic book drawn in an ancient Greek style . In the early 21st century , Canadian George Walker made wordless woodcut novels , beginning with Book of Hours ( 2010 ) , about the lives of those in the World Trade Center complex just before the September 11 attacks .

 The popularity of wordless novels peaked around 1929 to 1931 , when " talkies " were introduced and began to supersede silent films . In the 1930s the Nazis in Germany suppressed and detained many printmakers and banned Masereel 's works as " degenerate art " . Following World War II , US censors suppressed books with socialist views , including the works of Lynd Ward , on whom the FBI kept files over his socialist sympathies ; this censorship has made early editions of wordless novels scarce collectors ' items in the US . 
 By the 1940s , most artists had given up on the genre . The most devoted practitioners , Masereel and Ward , moved on to other work for which they became better known ; Masereel 's obituary did not even mention his wordless novels . Many wordless novels remained out of print until the rise of the graphic novel revived interest amongst readers and publishers in the early 21st century . 
 = = Relation to comics and graphic novels = = 
 " ... Ward 's roots were not in comics , though his work is part of the same large family tree ... " 
 There have been sporadic examples of textless comics throughout the medium 's history . In the US , there were comic strips such as Otto <unk> 's The Little King , begun in 1931 , and Carl Anderson 's Henry , begun in 1932 . German cartoonist E. O. Plauen 's wordless domestic comic strip Father and Son ( 1934 – 37 ) was popular in Germany , and was collected in three volumes . Antonio <unk> 's textless Mad magazine feature Spy vs. Spy began in 1961 . 
 Cartoonist Will Eisner ( 1917 – 2005 ) first came upon the work of Lynd Ward in 1938 . Eisner was an early pioneer in the American comic book industry and saw in Ward 's work a greater potential for comics . Eisner 's ambitions were rebuffed by his peers , who saw comics as no more than low @-@ status entertainment . Eisner withdrew from the commercial comics industry in the early 1950s to do government and educational work . He returned in the 1970s when the atmosphere had changed and his readers and peers seemed more receptive to his ambitions . In 1978 , he began a career of creating book @-@ length comics , the first of which was A Contract with God ; the book was marketed as a " graphic novel " , a term that became standard towards the end of the 20th century . Eisner called Ward " perhaps the most provocative graphic storyteller " of the 20th century . He wrote that Ward 's Vertigo ( 1937 ) required considerable investment from readers in order to fill in the story between images . 
 Interest in the wordless novel revived with the rise of the graphic novel . Comics fans discussed the works of Masereel and others in fanzines , and the discussions turned to talk of the Great American Novel being made in comics . These discussions inspired cartoonist Art Spiegelman ( b . 1942 ) , who in 1973 made a four @-@ page strip , " Prisoner on the Hell Planet " , in an Expressionist style inspired by Ward 's work . Spiegelman later incorporated the strip into his graphic novel Maus ( 1992 ) . 
 While graphic novels generally use captions and dialogue , cartoonists such as Eric Drooker , Peter Kuper , Thomas Ott , Brian Ralph , Masashi Tanaka , and Lewis Trondheim have made wordless graphic novels . As Gross did in He Done Her Wrong , Hendrik <unk> 's wordless oeuvre uses textless word balloons containing symbols , icons , and other images . The influence of the wordless novel is prominent in Drooker 's Flood ( 1992 ) and Kuper 's The System ( 1997 ) , both metaphorical stories that focus on social themes . Since 2011 , the Pennsylvania State University Libraries and the Pennsylvania Center for the Book have awarded the annual Lynd Ward Prize for Graphic Novel , a cash prize established by Ward 's daughters to highlight their father 's influence on the development of the graphic novel .

 = Midnight Madness ( basketball ) = 
 Midnight Madness is an annual event celebrating the upcoming college basketball season in which a team opens its first official practice to the public , often combining it with a pep rally and other fan friendly activities . The tradition originated from teams holding public practices at midnight on the earliest day that the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) would allow a practice to be held . In 2013 , a new NCAA rule established some <unk> around the opening of a team 's practice sessions . As a result , the dates on which teams celebrate Midnight Madness can vary , but most stick with the traditional date of a Friday night closest to October 15 . 
 = = History = = 
 Prior to the 2013 – 14 NCAA Division I men 's basketball season men 's and women 's basketball teams were not permitted to practice prior to the Friday closest to October 15 . Maryland Terrapins head coach Lefty Driesell began the Midnight Madness tradition at 12 : 03 a.m. on October 15 , 1971 by inviting the public to a 1 @.@ 5 mile team run . The early practice session was attended by 3 @,@ 000 fans at the track surrounding Byrd Stadium on the University of Maryland campus . Driesell continued the annual midnight practice session throughout his tenure at Maryland , and brought the tradition with him when he became head coach at Georgia State University . In 2008 , that school delayed the event until sunrise for the first time since Driesell established the tradition . 
 In 1982 , coach Joe B. Hall and the Kentucky Wildcats men 's basketball team began to officially promote a celebration dubbed " Midnight Madness " as a school event with formal entertainment acts and an invited student audience . This event was held in Memorial Coliseum and held 8 @,@ 500 people in the 12 @,@ 500 seat gym . Big Blue Madness is now televised and hosts celebrities including Drake , who performed in 2014 . Another of the more famous events is " Late Night in the Phog " at Kansas , which was started in 1985 by Larry Brown and is now broadcast in live streaming video via the Internet . The event has caught on on most campuses ; various programs have given away T @-@ shirts and allowed players do stunt dunks and half court shots . Some schools schedule intrasquad scrimmages , three @-@ point shooting contests and / or slam dunk contests . The event is often a co @-@ ed event , in which both the men 's and women 's team participate in the celebration , especially at schools like the University of Connecticut , where the men 's and women 's teams have a combined 13 championships . Scout.com estimated that in 2007 , approximately 160 of the top blue chip high school basketball recruits in the country were attending a Midnight Madness event during the weekend that opens the basketball season . 
 In 2013 , the NCAA ruled that men 's practices could begin two weeks earlier than the traditional date , so long as teams held no more than 30 days of practice in the six weeks prior to the first regular season game . This change was made to provide more flexible scheduling that accommodated off days in the preseason practice schedule . However , the women 's programs rejected moving the date forward so as not to conflict with recruiting . As a result of practices beginning so early , several teams opted to celebrate midnight madness later in the six week practice window . 
 = = Details = = 
 In the 21st century , most basketball programs from large Division I schools have planned a pep rally with MCs , music , dancing and other festivities to encourage support of the program . Celebrity guests and alumni participate in entertaining the students . Often , there is significant publicity surrounding the event , which may include televised broadcasts , published press releases and various new media exposure . 
 Some of the more outlandish occurrences during such events included coach participation , such as Michigan State Spartans men 's basketball coach Tom Izzo riding a Harley @-@ Davidson motorcycle onto the court and Florida Gators men 's basketball coach Billy Donovan rising out of a coffin . Although signing week , when top recruits sign letters of intent that commit them to specific schools , does not occur until November , blue chip high school recruits are sometimes welcomed at these events even in their junior years . Usually a prescribed number of fans ( such as the first 1000 ) receive a gifts such as t @-@ shirts , posters , autographs , road game vacation packages , and other free paraphernalia . At many such events , a student is chosen for a half court shot giveaway . Sometimes the events are televised live by sports networks such as the Big Ten Network , and other times highlights are shown on highlight shows such as ESPN 's SportsCenter . ESPNU has begun extensive yearly coverage of midnight madness events and in 2008 televised events at Davidson College , the University of Kansas , Georgetown University , Gonzaga University and Indiana University . The events have been reported for years in print media such as newspapers , magazines and the internet . Although Midnight Madness has become a prime time event for many premier basketball programs , some schools have continued the tradition of having their first practice at 12 : 00 on the first day regular practice is allowed . 
 As of 2006 , the University of Kentucky held the record for attendance at this type of sports rally with an attendance of 23 @,@ 312 at Rupp Arena . Kentucky has sold out Rupp Arena multiple times for what they call " Big Blue Madness " and in the 2008 – 09 Kentucky Wildcats men 's basketball season fans had to camp out in lines for days in advance to obtain tickets . 
 One celebratory function of the evening is often to raise NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Championship or Final Four banners to the rafters in an official ceremony . In 2008 , both 2008 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament finalists , the Kansas Jayhawks men 's basketball and Memphis Tigers men 's basketball teams , did so during their respective Midnight Madness event . The October 16 , 2009 celebrations occurred on many campuses and a sampling were aired on the ESPN family of networks . Five Big Ten Conference schools celebrated Midnight Madness . 
 = = Exceptions = = 
 In 2008 , some teams attempted to host Midnight Madness in association with special early restricted practices instead of the first day of regular practices . These universities felt that since their football teams had home games the week before the opening date of formal practices , which had become the traditional Midnight Madness date , they would be better off holding Midnight Madness on the weekend before . In 2008 , teams were allowed to practice two hours per week between September 15 and October 17 under what is known as the " Offseason Workout Rule , " and at least four notable public " practice " session ( by Illinois , Kentucky , Marshall and West Virginia ) were held during these weekly practices before daily practices were permitted . At the University of Illinois , the Illinois Fighting Illini men 's basketball and women 's basketball teams hosted scrimmages at Memorial Stadium after an October 11 game between the Illinois Fighting Illini football team and the Minnesota Golden Gophers football team . Since the attendance for the football game was 62 @,@ 870 , this event was described as the " World 's Largest Basketball Practice " . Charlie <unk> reports that the practice session events occurred both at halftime and after the game . 
 Kentucky was one of the schools that held their public practice event a week early in part because they could lure more recruiting prospects during a week when most other programs were not hosting similar events . The National Association of Basketball Coaches asked the Southeastern Conference to force Kentucky to adhere to the traditionally scheduled practice to no avail . They then belatedly petitioned the NCAA to legislate conformity unsuccessfully . Kentucky coach Billy Gillispie had contacted the Kentucky 's compliance office , the SEC and the NCAA to ensure that no rules were being violated . 
 Illinois head coach Bruce Weber , had also received permission for the early practice festivities from the NCAA . He had proposed having a September 13 session in association with a home football game against University of Louisiana at Lafayette . The date with the Louisiana – Lafayette Ragin ' Cajuns would have in all likelihood been a more favorable day in terms of the climate , but this date preceded even the Offseason Workout Rule dates . It is anticipated that in the future , public basketball practices linked to the Offseason Workout Rule will be banned . Illinois claimed that their date change was not intended to give it a recruiting advantage in terms of scheduling conflicts . 
 = Bristol Old Vic = 
 Bristol Old Vic is a British theatre company based at the Theatre Royal , Bristol . The present company was established in 1946 as an offshoot of the Old Vic in London . It is associated with the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School , which became a financially independent organisation in the 1990s . Bristol Old Vic runs a popular , and highly successful Young Company for young people aged 7 – 25 . 
 The Theatre Royal , the oldest continually @-@ operating theatre in the English speaking world , was built during 1764 – 66 on King Street in Bristol . The Coopers ' Hall , built 1743 – 44 , was incorporated as the theatre 's foyer during 1970 – 72 . Together , they are designated a Grade I listed building by Historic England . Daniel Day @-@ Lewis called it " the most beautiful theatre in England . " 
 In 2012 the theatre complex completed the first phase of a £ 19 million refurbishment , increasing seating capacity and providing up to ten flexible performance spaces . Besides the main Theatre Royal auditorium , the complex includes the Studio theatre and the Side Stage , Paint Shop and Basement performance areas . Whilst the theatre was closed , the company continued to present work in the Studio and Basement spaces , as well as at other sites around Bristol . The Theatre Royal re @-@ opened in 2012 with Wild Oats . 
 = = History of the theatre = = 
 The theatre is situated on King Street , a few yards from the Floating Harbour . Since 1972 , the public entrance has been through the Coopers ' Hall , the earliest surviving building on the site . The Coopers ' Hall was built in 1744 for the Coopers ' Company , the guild of coopers in Bristol , by architect William Halfpenny . It has a " debased Palladian " façade with four Corinthian columns . It only remained in the hands of the Coopers until 1785 , subsequently becoming a public assembly room , a wine warehouse , a Baptist chapel and eventually a fruit and vegetable warehouse . 
 The theatre was built between 1764 and 1766 . The design of the auditorium has traditionally been taken to have been based , with some variations , on that of the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane in London . Although Bristol architect Thomas Paty supervised construction , the theatre was built to designs by James Saunders , David Garrick 's carpenter at Drury Lane . Saunders had provided drawings for the theatre in Richmond , Surrey , built in 1765 . A long section ( 1790 , at Harvard University Theatre Collection ) and a survey plan ( 1842 , at the Local Studies Library ) of the Richmond theatre show close similarities with the Bristol theatre in the proportions and in the relationship between the actors on stage and the spectators surrounding them on three sides . The site chosen was Rackhay Yard , a roughly rectangular empty site behind a row of medieval houses and to one side of the Coopers ' Hall . Two ( and possibly three ) new passageways built through the ground floor of the houses fronting King Street gave access to Rackhay Yard and the " New Theatre " inside it . 
 The theatre opened on 30 May 1766 with a performance which including a prologue and epilogue given by David Garrick . As the proprietors were not able to obtain a Royal Licence , productions were announced as " a concert with a specimen of <unk> " to evade the restrictions imposed on theatres by the Licensing Act 1737 . This ruse was soon abandoned , but a production in the neighbouring Coopers ' Hall in 1773 did fall foul of this law . 
 Legal concerns were alleviated when the Royal Letters Patent were eventually granted in 1778 , and the theatre became a patent theatre and took up the name " Theatre Royal " . At this time the theatre also started opening for the winter season , and a joint company was established to perform at both the Bath Theatre Royal and in Bristol , featuring famous names including Sarah Siddons , whose ghost , according to legend , haunts the Bristol theatre . The auditorium was rebuilt with a new sloping ceiling and gallery in 1800 . After the break with Bath in 1819 the theatre was managed by William M <unk> the elder , with little success , but slowly rose again under his widow Sarah M <unk> in the 1850s . Following her death in 1853 the M <unk> ' son @-@ in @-@ law James Chute took over , but he lost interest in the Theatre Royal , which fell into decline when he opened the Prince 's Theatre , originally known as the New Theatre Royal , in 1867 . A new , narrow entrance was constructed through an adjacent building in 1903 . 
 = = Formation of the Bristol Old Vic = = 
 Chute relinquished his lease on the Theatre Royal in 1861 , concentrating his business at the Prince 's Theatre , which was destroyed by bombing during the Second World War . In 1942 the lease owners put the building up for sale . The sale was perceived as a possible loss of the building as a theatre and a public appeal was mounted to preserve its use , and as a result a new Trust was established to buy the building . The Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts ( CEMA ) leased the building from the Trust and in 1946 CEMA 's successor , the Arts Council , arranged for a company from the London Old Vic to staff it , thus forming the Bristol Old Vic . 
 Early members of the company included Peter O 'Toole ( making his first appearance in Major Barbara in 1956 ) , John Neville , Timothy West , Barbara Leigh @-@ Hunt and Dorothy Tutin . The first artistic director was Hugh Hunt . 
 An early triumph for the Bristol Old Vic occurred when the 1954 première production of Salad Days transferred to the West End and became the longest @-@ running musical on the London stage at that time . The Arts Council remained involved until 1963 when their role was taken over by the City Council . In the same year the London Old Vic was disbanded and the Bristol company became fully independent . The Bristol Old Vic also put plays on in the council @-@ owned Little Theatre from then until 1980 . 
 The present theatre complex , designed by Peter Moro , was completed in 1972 . The 1903 entrance building was demolished , as were a number of surrounding buildings and , more controversially , the stage area of the 1766 theatre . A new stage and fly tower were built along with technical facilities and offices . The 150 seat New Vic Studio ( now the Studio ) theatre was built in place of the old entrance , and the Coopers ' Hall provided the theatre with the grand façade and foyer area it had previously lacked . 
 Throughout the 1970s and 80s Bristol Old Vic productions were well received both locally and on tour , but by the late 80s faced chronic underfunding . A revival under the leadership of Andrew ( Andy ) Hay brought an increase in audience numbers ; there followed a new Arts Council funding package , and in 2003 the appointment of joint artistic directors David Farr and Simon Reade . They briefly branded the organisation the " new <unk> old vic " . 
 In 2005 Reade became the sole artistic director . Artistic highlights during these times included the production of A. C. H. Smith ’ s Up The Feeder , Down the Mouth and Back Again during Andy Hay ’ s tenure , and some well @-@ received Shakespeare productions under David Farr and Simon Reade . 
 = = Refurbishment = = 
 In July 2007 , the board of trustees took the controversial decision to close the theatre for refurbishment . Many members of the theatre profession feared for the future of the Old Vic . Following several public meetings in the winter of 2007 / 2008 a newly formed board of trustees appointed Dick Penny , the director of the Watershed Media Centre as executive chairman . 
 In February 2009 the company announced that Tom Morris , at that time an associate director at the Royal National Theatre and formerly artistic director at Battersea Arts Centre , had been appointed as artistic director . Emma <unk> , who had previously worked with Tom Morris at BAC , became executive director . 
 In October 2010 there was a merger of the Old Vic and the Theatre Royal Bristol Trust , into a combined charity to be chaired by Laura Marshall , the managing director of Icon Films . 
 A fundraising campaign for the £ 19 million planned refurbishment was assisted by appearances from , among others , Richard Briers , Stephanie Cole , Judi Dench , Prunella Scales , Patrick Stewart and Timothy West . £ 5 @.@ 3 million was provided by the Arts Council . During the closure the company staged productions in the Studio theatre , the Basement and in other locations around Bristol , including Sally Cookson ’ s Treasure Island on King Street in summer 2011 and Melly Still ’ s revival of Coram Boy at the Colston Hall at Christmas 2011 . 
 The plan was for a flexible theatre complex , where up to ten areas are available for performance . Tom Morris has cited as inspiration the Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord in Paris . The main auditorium gained an optional thrust stage , and an increase in seating to 540 . The Side Stage area was redeveloped , with additional capacity of 250 , creating the option of a separate second auditorium . Other spaces redeveloped as performance areas included the Paint Shop and the rehearsal room . The Theatre Royal re @-@ opened in September 2012 , with Wild Oats . Further work ( mainly in the area of the foyer ) is planned for the refurbishment 's next phase , to be completed in 2016 , to coincide with the 250th anniversary of the theatre opening .

 The Bristol Old Vic has a long history of taking productions on tour both within the United Kingdom and overseas . Notable production toured include Hamlet , Arms and the Man and A Man for all Seasons to Ceylon and Pakistan in 1962 – 63 ; Hamlet and Measure for Measure to America , Holland and Belgium in 1966 – 67 and Man and Superman to the June <unk> Festival in Zurich , 1958 . The company has also made frequent visits to the Edinburgh Festival and productions have toured to the Theatre Royal Bath , Oxford Playhouse , Royal Court Theatre , London and the Young Vic , London amongst others .

 The Bristol Old Vic Theatre School , opened by Laurence Olivier in 1946 , is an affiliate of the Conservatoire for Dance and Drama , an organisation securing the highest standards of training in the performing arts , and is an associate school of the University of the West of England . The School began life in October 1946 , only eight months after the founding of its parent Bristol Old Vic Theatre Company , in a room above a fruit merchant 's warehouse in the Rackhay near the stage door of the Theatre Royal . ( The yard of the derelict St Nicholas School adjacent to the warehouse was still used by the Company for rehearsals of crowd scenes and stage fights as late as the early 1960s , notably for John Hale 's productions of Romeo and Juliet starring the Canadian actor Paul Massie and Annette Crosbie , a former student of the School , and Rostand 's Cyrano de Bergerac with Peter Wyngarde . Students from the Theatre School frequently played in these crowd scenes and fights . ) 
 The School continued in these premises until 1954 when royalties from the musical , Salad Days by Julian Slade and Dorothy Reynolds were given to the School towards the purchase and conversion of two large adjoining Victorian villas in Clifton , which remain their base today . 
 In 1995 , that donation was formally recognised when a new custom @-@ built dance and movement studio in the School 's back garden was named the Slade / Reynolds Studio . The School provides comprehensive training courses for theatre , radio , film , and television professionals and its graduates are to be found in key positions as actors , directors , set designers , costumer designers , lighting designers and stage and company managers throughout the world . 
 Among the most notable of the many distinguished actors on the School 's list of alumni are the Academy Award winners Daniel Day @-@ Lewis and Jeremy Irons .

 = The Post @-@ American World = 
 The Post @-@ American World is a non @-@ fiction book by American journalist Fareed Zakaria . It was published in hardcover and audiobook formats in early May 2008 and became available in paperback in early May 2009 ; the Updated and Expanded Release 2 @.@ 0 followed in 2011 . In the book , Zakaria argues that , thanks to the actions of the United States in spreading liberal democracy across the world , other countries are now competing with the US in terms of economic , industrial , and cultural power . While the US continues to dominate in terms of political @-@ military power , other countries such as China and India are becoming global players in many fields . 
 The book peaked at # 2 on The New York Times non @-@ fiction hardcover best @-@ seller list and at # 47 on the USA Today Top 150 Best @-@ Selling Books list . Reviewers commented that Zakaria 's writing was intelligent and sharp , yet accessible to general audiences . A few reviewers also wrote that the book was similar to an extended essay with journalistic style writing . 
 = = Background = = 
 At the time of publication author Fareed Zakaria was a 48 @-@ year @-@ old married man living in New York and working as an editor for Newsweek International . Zakaria had immigrated to the United States from India during his university career . He graduated from Harvard University with a Ph.D. in political science in 1993 after earning a B.A. from Yale University . He worked as the managing editor of Foreign Affairs magazine before accepting the editor position at Newsweek . Labeled a liberal hawk , Zakaria 's political views have shifted from supporting Reagan 's pro @-@ democracy agenda to Clinton 's pro @-@ market stances and to the point where Zakaria felt that the US was " unstoppable " . In subsequent years , he watched as other countries set records for the world 's tallest building , largest factory , largest refinery , and richest person . Meanwhile , he watched the US get bogged down in war in Iraq . In 2003 , his book The Future of Freedom : <unk> Democracy at Home and Abroad , in which he examines the necessary conditions for liberal democracy to survive , was published . While he initially supported US intervention in Iraq , Zakaria criticized the Bush Administration 's methods of nation @-@ building and for trying to force Iraq into a liberal democracy without the preconditions of economic liberalisation and rule @-@ of @-@ law . Over the next few years , Zakaria developed his theory on shifting global power as he contributed or wrote articles profiling emerging national powers and participating in economic forums and organizations . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 The content is divided into seven chapters . The first chapter introduces the thesis of the book : that a ' post @-@ American ' world order is emerging in which the United States will continue to be the most powerful nation but its relative power will be diminished . He believes that there have been three power shifts in the last 500 years : a shift of power to the West during the Renaissance , a shift of power to the US making it a superpower , and now a shift to several surging countries , especially China and India , and to non @-@ governmental organizations . Zakaria believes that international organizations are not adapting well to emerging challenges and that there is too much focus on problems arising from potential market failures or general crises ( e.g. terrorism ) at the expense of focus on problems stemming from success ( e.g. development causing environmental degradation , or rising demand creating high commodity prices ) . 
 The second and third chapters examine factors that led to the current power balance . Power shifted to the West because it fostered trade with foreign peoples and developed superior labour productivity per capita . Power shifted to the US because of its strong democracy and capitalist market . Zakaria argues that the success of the US in promoting free market capitalism and globalization has led to power being dispersed to several other countries . Economies have been surging for decades , in part due to large new players entering the global market place . He compares this era 's economic growth to the economic surges of the 1890s and the 1950s which also saw new players become global powers . At the same time , Zakaria sees attitudes in the US becoming insular and distrustful of foreigners . 
 The fourth chapter focuses on China . Its strategy of small , gradual reforms have allowed it to quietly modernize . It has become the second most powerful nation , but still unlikely to match the US for decades to come . China 's strengths include a philosophy that reflects Confucian ideals of practicality , ethics and rationalism . Its non @-@ combative foreign policy is more appealing , most notably in Africa , over interventionist Western @-@ style policy that demands reforms in other countries . China 's weakness , though , is a fear of social unrest . 
 The fifth chapter focuses on India . Contrasted to China , India has a bottom @-@ up democratic political system constantly subject to social unrest with only a few politicians losing elections . Its political system is characterized by strong regionalism — often placing high priority on regional interests rather than national . Zakaria lists India 's advantages : independent courts that enforce contracts , private property rights , rule of law , an established private sector , and many business savvy English @-@ speaking people . 
 The sixth chapter compares the American rise to superpower status and its use of power . He draws parallels between the British Empire in the 1890s and starting the Boer War , with the US in the 2000s and starting the Iraq War . The difference between them is that the British had unsurpassed political power but lost its economic dominance , whereas the US , in the 2000s , had huge economic power but faltering political influence . Zakaria defends the US from indicators that suggest American decline but warns that internal partisan politics , domestic ideological attack groups , special interest power , and a sensationalistic media are weakening the federal government 's ability to adapt to new global realities . 
 The final chapter outlines how the US has used its power and provides six guidelines for the US to follow in the ' post @-@ American world ' envisioned by Zakaria . 
 = = Style and comparisons = = 
 The Post @-@ American World , at 292 pages long , was described as " a book @-@ length essay " and a " thin book that reads like one long , thoughtful essay " . Written with an optimistic tone , it features little new research or reporting , but rather contains insights and identification of trends . The reviewer for The Wall Street Journal described the tone as " infectious ( though not naive ) <unk> ... but without Panglossian simplicity " . The American Spectator reviewer noted that the prose had a journalistic style while the reviewer for The Guardian noticed the writing sometimes displayed " news magazine mannerisms " . 
 Zakaria 's view on globalization was said to be similar to journalist and author Thomas Friedman . Friedman reviewed The Post @-@ American World and called it " compelling " . The review in American Conservative compared this book with Rudyard Kipling 's poems " <unk> " and " The White Man 's Burden " , both written at the height of British power and warning against imperial hubris . The American Spectator review listed it as adding to similar themed books , comparing it to Oswald Spengler 's The Decline of the West ( 1918 ) , Arnold Toynbee 's A Study of History , Paul Kennedy 's The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers ( 1987 ) , and Robert Kagan 's The Return of History and the End of Dreams ( 2008 ) . Kagan labeled The Post @-@ American World as " <unk> " ; however , Martin Woollacott of The Guardian labeled Zakaria an <unk> . The Commentary review added the works of Samuel P. Huntington and Francis Fukuyama to the list of comparisons and suggested there is now a subgenre of books that consider the decline or demise of American hegemony .

 The book was published by W. W. Norton & Company and the hardcover released in early May 2008 . Excerpts were published in Newsweek , the National Post , and The New York Times . The book entered The New York Times ' non @-@ fiction best @-@ seller list at # 11 on May 18 , 2008 . It spent 13 weeks within the top thirteen spots , peaking at # 2 on June 1 . It spent 8 weeks on the USA Today Top 150 Best @-@ Selling Books list , peaking at # 47 . An 8 @.@ 5 hour audiobook , narrated by Zakaria , was released at the same time . A review in Publishers Weekly said that Zakaria 's narration , with his light Indian accent and deliberate pacing , creates a sense of ease and allows for listeners to appreciate and understand the content . The paperback was released a year later late @-@ April 2009 . It spent several weeks on The New York Times non @-@ fiction paperback best @-@ seller list peaking at # 11 on May 22 , 2009 .

 Various reviewers called the writing intelligent and sharp . The review in the Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette called it a " succinct , short and comprehensible volume ... full of sharp , almost aphoristic , amusing observations " . John Ikenberry of Foreign Affairs saw Zakaria 's characteristic elegance and insight reflected in the book . The reviewers in Policy and Economic Affairs identified Zakaria 's strengths as being the breadth of evidence used to support the points and his use of personal accounts to summarize the research . The reviewer for USA Today Magazine wrote that " Zakaria analyzes problems brilliantly " . The ability to communicate complex situations clearly in plain language made the book accessible to a wide range of readers . Several media outlets picked up the story of Barack Obama reading this book while campaigning for the 2008 presidential election . 
 Critics commented on Zakaria 's teleological point @-@ of @-@ view . In a review published in The Progressive , Johann Hari called Zakaria 's assertions <unk> referring to the belief that there is no alternative to globalization and free market capitalism . Hari cited examples where policies such as what Zakaria advocated led to disasters , like the 1999 collapse of Argentinian economy , and financial deregulation resulting in the financial crisis of 2007 – 2010 , which had begun just after the book was published . In the book , Zakaria maintains that economic dysfunctions are caused by , and can be solved through , specific government policies . When asked , in February 2009 , about the financial crisis , Zakaria asserted that the financial practices that created the collapse were American practices , and that it contributed to the post @-@ American mentality that the US does not have all of the answers . Hari also disagreed with Zakaria 's view of the economic histories of Britain and America , which in Zakaria portrayal ignores extended periods of protectionism during which their industries were developed to the point where they were capable of competing with other countries . Likewise , academic and author Brendan Simms found that Zakaria too closely co @-@ related national wealth with national power in his argument that dispersal of global prosperity will necessarily affect global balance of power . 
 The Economist review found a disconnection between the book 's arguments and its sources in that the book addresses international and national ( especially analysis of China and India ) , but nearly all the people behind the sources cited are based , or spent most of their careers , in the New York @-@ Washington corridor . Richard Florida in The Globe and Mail and Michael Vlahos in The American Interest commented that Zakaria state @-@ centric framework distorts the real base of power , which , for commentator Florida , is in cities like Shanghai and Hong Kong rather than all of China . Vlahos likened Zakaria to a courtier mirroring back the ruling narrative to meet the global elite 's emotional needs . Regarding the book 's focus , one reviewer criticized it by writing " The Post @-@ American World is missing precisely what its title promises : a discussion of what a world might look like that is not dominated by the United States " . Errors concerning characterization of Buddhism as Indian religion and Buddha 's birthplace as India rather than Lumbini resulted in Nepali politicians demanding an apology from Zakaria or a printed correction . 
 = Gomer Pyle , U.S.M.C. = 
 Gomer Pyle , U.S.M.C. is an American situation comedy that originally aired on CBS from September 25 , 1964 , to May 2 , 1969 . The series was a spin @-@ off of The Andy Griffith Show , and the pilot episode was aired as the season finale of the fourth season of its parent series on May 18 , 1964 . The show ran for five seasons and a total of 150 episodes . In 2006 , CBS Home Entertainment ( distributed by Paramount ) began releasing the series on DVD . The final season was released in November 2008 . 
 Gomer Pyle , U.S.M.C. was a hit , never placing lower than tenth in the Nielsen ratings , and ended its run as the second @-@ highest @-@ rated series in the United States . It has enjoyed continued popularity through reruns and DVD releases . The series was created by Aaron Ruben , who also produced the show with Sheldon Leonard and Ronald Jacobs . Filmed and set in California ( originally set in North Carolina ) , it stars Jim Nabors as Gomer Pyle , a naive but good @-@ natured gas station attendant from the town of Mayberry , North Carolina , who enlists in the United States Marine Corps . Frank Sutton plays Gomer 's high @-@ octane , short @-@ fused Gunnery Sergeant Vince Carter , and Ronnie Schell plays Gomer 's friend Duke Slater . Allan Melvin played in the recurring role of Gunnery Sergeant Carter 's rival , Sergeant Charley Hacker . 
 = = History = = 
 Everett Greenbaum and Jim Fritzell , writers for The Andy Griffith Show , are credited with creating the character of Gomer Pyle . The character was based on an " incompetent " gas station attendant whom Greenbaum met and named after Gomer Cool ( a writer ) and Denver Pyle ( an actor on The Andy Griffith Show ) . Jim Nabors was cast to play Gomer ; he had been performing for a Santa Monica nightclub , The Horn , when Andy Griffith discovered him . Though originally intended to appear only in one episode , Gomer proved popular , and after one year on the show , Nabors was given his own spin @-@ off produced by Aaron Ruben . The pilot episode of Gomer Pyle was filmed in 1963 as part of The Andy Griffith Show , but was not aired until 1964 , as the finale of The Andy Griffith Show 's fourth season . 
 The 1960s had a return to " the more mundane sensibilities of comedy , " due to viewers ' wishes for television programming to be a " cultural antidepressant . " Thus , fantasy and rural @-@ oriented comedies gained popularity and dominated the Nielsen ratings . Like other comedies at the time , Gomer Pyle was a " deep escapist " show ; it avoided political commentary and offered viewers a distraction from the social changes of the 1960s . Despite being a military @-@ themed show and airing during the peak of the Vietnam War , the show never discussed the war . Instead , the show focused on " Gomer 's innocent simplicity [ and ] Sergeant Carter 's frustration and later concern for Gomer 's well @-@ being . " This , compounded with the popularity of rural comedies in the 1960s , made the show popular . Frank Sutton , who played Carter , also ascribed the show 's popularity to its concentration on its two main characters , and the plots being built around their respective personalities . The program remained in the top 10 of the ratings throughout its run — in the top three for all but its third season when CBS moved it from Fridays to Wednesdays . Nabors quit because he desired to move to something else , ' reach for another rung on the ladder , either up or down ' . 
 After Gomer Pyle left the air , Jim Nabors hosted his own variety show , The Jim Nabors Hour , from 1969 to 1971 . As well as showcasing Nabors ' singing and rich baritone voice , the show included comedy sketches that featured Nabors 's Gomer Pyle co @-@ stars Frank Sutton and Ronnie Schell . Though told that he should not leave Gomer Pyle , Nabors felt that the show would still be exciting and noted that every character he portrayed in his sketches " turn [ ed ] out to be Gomer . " 
 Similarly , in 1987 , some 18 years after Gomer Pyle finished its broadcast run , Stanley Kubrick 's film Full Metal Jacket was released . In it , the nickname " Gomer Pyle " is derogatorily given to Private Leonard Lawrence ( played by Vincent D 'Onofrio ) during boot camp , after incurring the drill instructor 's wrath ( Gunnery Sergeant Hartman played by R. Lee Ermey ) for being unable to turn off his idiot 's grin and his perceived incompetence . 
 = = Production = = 
 The show was produced by creator Aaron Ruben , Andy Griffith Show producer Sheldon Leonard ( in partnership with Griffith ) , and Ronald Jacobs ; it was co @-@ produced by Bruce Bayley Johnson and Duke Vincent . Among the writers were Sam <unk> , Harvey Miller , Aaron Ruben , Jack <unk> , and Bill <unk> ; Andy Griffith Show writers Everett Greenbaum and Jim Fritzell also wrote episodes . Coby Ruskin was the primary director in the first four seasons , before John Rich took over the role for the fifth season ; other directors included Gary Nelson , Peter Baldwin , and Alan <unk> . Ruth Burch was in charge of the casting , and John Finger directed the cinematography . The theme song was composed by Earle Hagen , who also composed the themes for shows such as The Andy Griffith Show , The Dick Van Dyke Show , and That Girl . The show was filmed at Camp Pendleton , Desilu Studios 's Desilu @-@ Cahuenga , and RKO Forty Acres backlot , where The Andy Griffith Show was filmed . Though Ruben preferred the use of a multiple @-@ camera setup for comedy programs , Gomer Pyle used a single @-@ camera setup because much of the shooting was conducted outdoors . In his book And The Show Goes On , Sheldon Leonard explained that the armed forces offer levels of " cooperation " with filmmakers . Because the Marines felt that the show would be good for the branch 's image , Gomer Pyle was given " total cooperation , " meaning that the show was allowed unlimited access to military equipment . 
 Nabors and Sutton were the only actors credited in every episode ( however , Sutton did not actually appear in every episode ) . Ronnie Schell ( who played Duke Slater ) left after the third season to star in Good Morning , World , though he returned for the fifth season , promoted to corporal , after graduating from non @-@ commissioned officer training . Roy Stuart , who played Corporal Chuck Boyle , made his debut in the second season and left after the fourth . Andy Griffith , Frances <unk> , Ron Howard , and George Lindsey made guest appearances on the series reprising their respective roles from The Andy Griffith Show . Denver Pyle and Allan Melvin , who both had roles on The Andy Griffith Show , appeared in Gomer Pyle , but did not reprise their original roles . Denver Pyle , who had played Briscoe Darling in six episodes of The Andy Griffith Show , played tomato farmer Titus Purcell in the Gomer Pyle episode " The Price of Tomatoes " . Allan Melvin , who had played Clarence " Doc " Malloy and other antagonists on The Andy Griffith Show , played Sergeant Carter 's rival , Staff Sergeant Hacker , for four seasons . Nabors also carried the Gomer Pyle character to fellow CBS series The Lucy Show , in which he made a cameo appearance in a 1966 episode .

 The premise of Gomer Pyle is similar to and perhaps inspired by Andy Griffith 's movie No Time for Sergeants , which was based on the Mac Hyman novel of the same name . Like Leonard 's other shows , Gomer Pyle was character @-@ driven ; the main characters were " accessible " and " engaging " , and the supporting characters were often eccentric . In the show 's pilot episode , Gomer , a gas @-@ station attendant from Mayberry , joins the Marines . Gomer 's naivete immediately exasperates his drill instructor , Gunnery Sergeant Carter ( Frank Sutton ) . " Sergeant " Carter was referred to as Gunnery Sergeant only in the pilot episode ; for the rest of the series , he was always mistakenly addressed as Sergeant . Originally situated in Camp Wilson in North Carolina , the setting was moved to the fictional Camp Henderson in California . The show was a fish @-@ out @-@ of @-@ water piece , which , like its contemporary The Beverly Hillbillies , featured rural characters out of their normal settings . Like other comedies of the 1960s , the show avoided political commentary ( especially concerning the Vietnam War ) and focused instead on the predicaments that ensued from Gomer 's unintentional breaking of the rules or sticking his foot in his mouth . 
 Among the themes explored were the honesty and " strong family values supposedly inherent in small town life " ; according to author Gerard Jones , Gomer Pyle 's basic message was " far simpler than any corporate suburban sitcoms with their lessons in compromise and role @-@ following [ ... ] It said merely that the oldest , most basic , least sophisticated sort of sweetness could redeem even the toughest modern types " . Author Elizabeth Hirschman noted that Gomer represented a " uniquely American archetype " — a " large , powerful man physically " with the " simple , honest nature of a child or animal " . She also noted that , like stories with characters of such an archetype , Gomer 's trusting nature was often taken advantage of , though in the end he " reaps happiness " because of his innocence . In his book Watching M * A * S * H , Watching America , media and communications scholar James <unk> said that Gomer Pyle illustrated how class differences " supposedly negated or diminished by military training " appeared in military hierarchy .

 Gomer Pyle ( played by Jim Nabors ) , from Mayberry , North Carolina , is a good @-@ natured and innocent private whose naivete constantly annoys his drill instructor , Sergeant Carter . Eventually , however , his " unquestioning love and trust of the world " lead those in his platoon to befriend him . Gomer was created as a stereotype of a rural American ; according to Time , he " wears a gee @-@ whiz expression , spouts homilies out of a lopsided mouth and <unk> around uncertainly like a <unk> stepping through a field of cow dung . He is a walking disaster area . " Though never promoted beyond private first class during the show 's run , Jim Nabors ( who played Gomer ) was given an honorary promotion to lance corporal in 2001 and again to corporal in 2007 by the Marines . 
 Vince Carter ( played by Frank Sutton ) , a gunnery sergeant from Kansas , is Gomer 's irritable drill instructor ( later his platoon sergeant ) who is constantly annoyed by Gomer 's well @-@ intentioned mistakes . Due to the audience 's demand for more family @-@ oriented programming , he eventually revealed his softer side : Carter became a father figure to Gomer as well as his best friend . Sutton stated that his character was created " out of whole cloth for the show " and , as the actor played him " by ear " , Carter greatly changed during the first season . Barbara Stuart played his girlfriend " Miss Bunny " for 3 seasons . 
 Mark Slade appeared in eight episodes in 1964 in the role of " Eddie " though in the first of those appearances he was billed as " Private Swanson . " 
 Duke Slater ( played by Ronnie Schell ) is Gomer 's friend and platoon @-@ mate . Schell left the show in the fourth season to star in the short @-@ lived show Good Morning , World but returned in the final season as the corporal of Gomer 's platoon . 
 Chuck Boyle ( played by Roy Stuart ) is Gomer 's corporal . He often serves as Carter 's conscience and sticks up for Gomer when Sergeant Carter is annoyed over his mistakes . Stuart debuted in the second season and left the show after the fourth season ; Boyle was replaced by Duke Slater as corporal for the final season . 
 Lou @-@ Ann <unk> ( played by Elizabeth MacRae ) is Gomer 's girlfriend . She debuts in the third season as a singer for a nightclub , but leaves the job at Gomer 's urging to return home to Turtle Creek , North Carolina , and marry her beau Monroe <unk> .

 Perfect Dark Zero is a first @-@ person shooter video game developed by Rare and published by Microsoft Game Studios . It was exclusively released as a launch title for the Xbox 360 video game console on November 22 , 2005 in North America and December 2 , 2005 in Europe . The game is part of the Perfect Dark series and a prequel to the original Perfect Dark . The story of the game follows protagonist Joanna Dark as she joins the Carrington Institute agency to prevent rival corporation dataDyne from getting possession of an ancient artefact which endows individuals with superhuman powers . 
 Perfect Dark Zero features a campaign mode consisting of 14 missions that can be played co @-@ operatively , and a multiplayer mode where a maximum of 32 players can compete against each other in numerous types of deathmatch and objective @-@ based games . Both the co @-@ operative and multiplayer modes support split @-@ screen , system link , and the Xbox Live online service . The game was under development for five years and was originally intended to be released for the Nintendo GameCube and later the Xbox . 
 Perfect Dark Zero sold more than one million copies worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics , garnering a score of 81 out of 100 at review aggregate website Metacritic . The game 's numerous multiplayer modes singled out as strong features . However , some critics felt that the game did not meet the expectations , criticizing single @-@ player aspects such as its story and voice acting . Two sequel novels , Perfect Dark : Initial Vector and Perfect Dark : Second Front , as well as a comic series , Perfect Dark : Janus ' Tears , were released to continue the story of the game . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Perfect Dark Zero is a first @-@ person shooter where players control the player character mostly from a first @-@ person perspective . The combat features mechanics such as an evasive dodge roll and a cover system in which the gameplay switches to a third @-@ person perspective , allowing the player to strategically aim without taking damage and be more aware of the surroundings . Players cannot jump but have the ability to automatically climb obstacles as long as they can reasonably reach them . It is also possible to climb ladders . By doing so , the camera shifts into a third @-@ person perspective . The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies . The health can recharge a bit if the player steps out of the line of fire for a few seconds , but it may not necessarily refill completely depending on how much damage the player took . 
 Players can only carry a limited number of weapons since the inventory features a 4 @-@ slot system in which single hand held pistols usually take a weapon slot whereas heavy weapons like sniper rifles or rocket launchers can take up to three weapon slots . The player 's movement speed is also altered by the weight of the weapon the player is currently holding . Besides the primary function , all of the weapons in Perfect Dark Zero have one or two additional function modes that generally grant the player with special abilities . For example , the Shockwave Rifle features an X @-@ ray function which allows the player to see enemies through walls , while the Plasma Rifle has a cloak function that renders the player character invisible to enemies at cost of its batteries . Some weapons also feature more unorthodox secondary functions . For instance , the Laptop Gun can be deployed as a sentry gun , while the <unk> assault rifle can launch bouncing grenades . 
 = = = Campaign = = = 
 The campaign is divided into 14 missions in which the player plays as Joanna Dark . Each mission provides a number of objectives that the player has to complete to progress . To successfully clear a mission , the player must complete all primary objectives , and if Joanna is killed or fails an objective , the player will have to start the level again . The missions also feature optional objectives that are not critical but add to the player 's overall completion score . Some objectives require the player to use numerous high @-@ tech gadgets . For example , a device called <unk> allows the player to hack into electronic devices , while another called <unk> can be used to open locked doors . Stealth is another important element of the gameplay , as the player is often given the freedom to kill enemies without being detected by sneaking up behind them . Unlike the original Perfect Dark , every mission contains a single checkpoint at which the player may restart if Joanna is killed or loses beyond that checkpoint . However , checkpoints are removed as the player plays through a higher difficulty . There are four difficulty settings through which a mission can be played : Agent , Secret Agent , Perfect Agent , and an extra one called Dark Agent , which becomes available once the player completes the entire game on Perfect Agent . As the player plays on higher difficulties , the game adds more objectives and makes enemies tougher to increase the challenge . 
 The game also provides a co @-@ operative mode where two players may play through the game 's campaign together via split @-@ screen , system link , or through the Xbox Live online service . In co @-@ operative , the missions are slightly altered to suit both players . For instance , some doors may require two players to open them . Additionally , in certain missions , the second player can occasionally start far away from the main player and takes over an allied character that was AI @-@ controlled in the single player campaign . The respawn procedure is also altered substantially , as if one player dies , the other has to find and revive the partner 's corpse to bring it back to life . 
 = = = Multiplayer = = = 
 In addition to the campaign mode , Perfect Dark Zero features a multiplayer where a maximum of 32 players may compete in numerous types of deathmatch and objective @-@ based games via split @-@ screen , system link , or Xbox Live . The multiplayer offers two main modes with their own customisable options : DeathMatch and DarkOps . DeathMatch is a standard gametype where players spawn in rooms , collect weapons that are available on the map itself , and continue to the actual map . The overall objective of the game is determined by the scenario being played . Scenarios range from <unk> or Team <unk> , where the goal is to kill as many opposing players as possible , to objective @-@ based games such as Capture the Flag and Territorial Gains . DarkOps , on the other hand , is a slower @-@ paced and team @-@ only gametype where weapons must be purchased from a player 's stock of credits and credits are earned by killing enemies and completing objectives . Scenarios in this mode include Eradication , where the last team with any members left alive wins ; Infection , where players score points by either infecting others or surviving infection ; Sabotage , where the team that causes the most damage to the other team 's property wins ; and Onslaught , where one team must defend a base while the other has to attack it . 
 Players can either choose to play a ranked Deathmatch or DarkOps , where they will be matched with other players using a system called <unk> Matchmaking , or they may choose a player match where they can choose their game from a list of player hosted games . Like the original Perfect Dark , these games can be highly customized and can also include computer game bots . Features such as their difficulty and behavior can be changed to match player preference . For example , the Judge bot always attacks leading players with the highest kills score . Players can also issue commands to them as long as they are on their respective team , such as follow or hold position , and set waypoints for them to walk to . The game includes by default six different maps and each has two variants ; the only change is the placement of the bases . Most of the maps are large ones , ideal for 32 players at once , with small variants for 4 @-@ 16 player games . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Perfect Dark Zero is set in 2020 where a large percentage of the world is controlled by corporations . The most notable of these corporations are dataDyne , headed by Zhang Li , and the Carrington Institute , headed by Daniel Carrington . The player is cast as Joanna Dark , a bounty hunter working with her father Jack Dark and computer hacker Chandra Sekhar . The team is after Nathan Zeigler , an independent researcher who has been captured by a Hong Kong triad gang led by a man named Killian . Joanna and her father successfully rescue Zeigler , but Killian manages to escape . Zeigler explains that Killian was trying to obtain his research , which contains information about a dangerous weapon . As Zeigler refuses to go anywhere without his research , Joanna is sent to retrieve it while her father stays with Zeigler . After Joanna retrieved a case with Zeigler 's research from a nearby safe house , Zeigler takes a device called neurodrive from the case and uses it to implant his research data into Jack 's mind . Afterwards , Zeigler succumbs to his injuries sustained by Killian and dies . Before dying , Zeigler says that they must find a scientist named Dr. Eustace Caroll . 
 While escaping , Jack and Joanna are attacked by a dataDyne assault team assisted by Killian in a dropship . Joanna manages to kill Killian and escape with Sekhar , but Jack is captured by dataDyne . With the help of Sekhar , Joanna learns that her father has been taken to a mansion where Zhang Li lives . Joanna infiltrates the mansion and finds her father in a cell . He has been tortured , and begins speaking gibberish to her , an after effect of the neurodrive . The pair fights their way out of the complex , but their extraction is interrupted by Zhang Li 's daughter , Mai Hem , who kills Jack before Joanna escapes in a hovercraft . Joanna and Sekhar decide to pursue Zeigler 's lead and seek out Dr. Caroll , who works aboard a research platform on the Pacific Ocean . Upon meeting with Joanna , Dr. Caroll uses a neurodrive to extract Zeigler 's data from Joanna 's memory , which she gained when she rescued her father . Soon after , Sekhar betrays Joanna and shoots Dr. Caroll , stating that she decided to join dataDyne because Zhang Li had made her a large offer . A team of Carrington Institute agents arrives and saves Joanna , but Sekhar eventually escapes with the data . Joanna agrees to join the Carrington Institute to stop dataDyne . 
 Daniel Carrington informs Joanna that Zeigler had been working on an algorithm capable of decoding extraterrestrial glyphs at a dig site in South America . Traveling to Peru , Joanna learns that the glyphs are leading dataDyne to search for an ancient artefact which acts as a power @-@ source for the Graal , a device which endows individuals with superhuman powers . Joanna plants a tracking device onto the artefact before sneaking aboard a dataDyne dropship . The dropship takes her to Africa , where Zhang Li has located the Graal buried under the African sands . The Carrington Institute plans an offensive on dataDyne forces with the battle taking place on a large bridge . Joanna rescues several Carrington Institute agents before avenging her father 's death by killing Mei Hem . Joanna infiltrates an arena and faces off against Zhang Li , who dispatches Sekhar after using the Graal . Despite the advantage , Joanna defeats Zhang Li in a final battle . 
 = = Development = = 
 Development of Perfect Dark Zero began on the Nintendo GameCube with a very small team of roughly ten people . At the time , Nintendo had a 49 % stake in Rare , making Rare a Nintendo second @-@ party developer . According to lead designer Chris Tilston , " It was basically prototyping , finding out where we could go and how we could get there . " The multiplayer mode was initially designed to be played offline because the team was told the GameCube would not support online play , even though some modem adapters were produced by <unk> later . In 2002 , Rare was fully purchased by Microsoft . As a result , the project was transferred to the Xbox and the multiplayer was redesigned to support the Xbox Live online gaming service . Tilston revealed that at one point they got to 50 players online simultaneously , but the graphics " just couldn 't handle it . " 
 When the Xbox 360 was conceived , it gave the developers more possibilities to include what they always wanted , since the initial version of the game pushed the original Xbox hardware very hard . Tilston credited the new hardware for allowing them to create the game 's co @-@ operative mode , which was one of the first that could be played via Xbox Live . Designing the co @-@ operative mode over Xbox Live was very challenging for the developers . According to Duncan Botwood , who was responsible for most of the multiplayer , " It was quite an effort to put it in , to be honest . You have to cater for a number of eventualities you just don 't get normally . We think we pulled it off , and because we pulled it off , other people might feel inspired to put the effort in , and we think that 's a good thing . The co @-@ op over Live , yeah , we 're very proud of that ... we 're proud indeed . " 
 Perfect Dark Zero is also one of the first games to use the Havok 's <unk> physics engine , which was specifically designed for multi @-@ core video game systems such as the Xbox 360 . The game 's renderer engine employs more advanced graphic technologies than was possible in the sixth generation of video game consoles , including parallax mapping , ambient occlusion , subsurface scattering , and high dynamic range . Initially , the game had a heavy anime style and Joanna Dark received several alterations throughout the development process . Lead Art Director Wil Overton explained , " We kind of wanted to bring her back in line with the way Rare do things . [ ... ] We sorta wanted to stylize her up a bit and make her more iconic . " However , the designers ultimately decided to tone down the styling of the game a bit . According to Overton , " I think it 's now sort of a hybrid . It 's sort of a hybrid of Japanese and Western comic book look . " 
 The cover mode was designed to enhance the stealth aspect of the game , and the third @-@ person perspective was needed to get into and get out of quickly . It also allowed players to see the character they were playing . The idea of bringing the game into a total third @-@ person perspective was rejected as the shooting " works better " in first @-@ person view , explained Tilston . Like Rare 's earlier first @-@ person shooters GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark , developers decided not to include a jumping function since they felt it goes against the nature of the genre . Botwood pointed out that it can " look damn stupid when you see other players doing it " . For this reason , the team <unk> moves such as climbing obstacles or , more specifically , the combat roll , which makes players harder to hit since it breaks the game 's auto @-@ aim lock . The transition between first and third @-@ person view with some moves took a lot of work so that they did not become disorientating . A first @-@ person roll was implemented at one time , but it was ultimately dropped . 
 The game was intended to be a launch title for the Xbox 360 . As a result , the last stage of development was very challenging and several intended features were canceled so that the game could meet the launch deadline . The number of players in multiplayer matches had to be reduced from 50 to 32 , which was still twice the standard , and a " dataDyne TV " mode that would have allowed players to upload and watch multiplayer matches over Xbox Live was eventually rejected . Final development for the Xbox 360 was very rushed . The order was given to produce the discs five days before the Microsoft certification was complete . Rare later stated they felt very confident they would pass , but it was a significant risk producing 700 @,@ 000 disks if a bug turned up . According to Botwood , " very few people believed we could make launch , but everything came together in time and it was out there for day one . " 
 The actual development of the game took overall five years to complete and spanned three platforms : the Nintendo GameCube , the Microsoft Xbox and the Xbox 360 . Tilston remarked that , throughout the course of development , the team noticed how the video game industry had evolved as computing and graphics power increased , and how earlier games like GoldenEye 007 and Donkey Kong Country where their development costs were minimal could easily be profitable with a few programmers . Tilston also revealed that the team behind Perfect Dark Zero was composed of roughly 25 people for most of the project , which was " ridiculously " small compared to the seventh generation 's standards where there are 100 or 200 people working on a team . Despite this , Perfect Dark Zero , from a development cost , made four times its money back .

 Perfect Dark Zero made its first appearance at Spaceworld 2000 , an annual video game trade show hosted by Nintendo in Tokyo . The demo briefly showed a 3D real @-@ time render of Joanna Dark . Some reports further suggested the development of the game with Rare applying to trademark the names " After Dark " , " Perfect Dark Evolution " and the phrase " Shot in the Dark " . The next year , at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in June 2001 , Nintendo advertised the title " Perfect Dark Zero " on a list of upcoming GameCube releases , but it was quickly removed . In January 2002 , it was allegedly announced that its release was pushed back to 2004 due to internal team problems at Rare . 
 When Rare was purchased by Microsoft in September 2002 , several cartoony images of Joanna Dark were released , but few other official announcements were made in the following years . On May 10 , 2005 , one of the rewards in the <unk> viral marketing campaign for Microsoft 's Xbox 360 console was a new image of Joanna Dark . At the official unveiling of the Xbox 360 , it was revealed that Perfect Dark Zero would be a launch title for the new system in the fall of 2005 . A demo was shown during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2005 shortly afterwards . Prior to its release , Microsoft arranged several deals with different publishers to promote interest in the game . Two novels , Perfect Dark : Initial Vector and Perfect Dark : Second Front , which were written by Greg Rucka , and a comic book , Perfect Dark : Janus ' Tears , which was written by Eric Trautmann and illustrated by Cold <unk> Studios , were released before and after the game . Around the same time , Joanna Dark made an appearance on the cover of FHM magazine . An official soundtrack produced by Nile Rodgers , Perfect Dark Zero Original Soundtrack , was also made available on November 8 , 2005 . 
 The first release of the game came on November 17 , 2005 in North America . The game was subsequently playable at the Xbox 360 Zero Hour Launch event , along with other Xbox 360 launch titles such as Rare 's Kameo : Elements of Power and Activision 's Call of Duty 2 . Other releases followed on December 2 in Europe and on December 10 in Japan . In Europe , Microsoft organized a party by simulating an apartment as Joanna Dark 's home , where several journalists could try out the Xbox 360 and the game . During the Japanese launch weekend , Perfect Dark Zero became the second best @-@ selling 360 game with roughly 15 @,@ 000 units sold , behind Namco 's Ridge Racer 6 . 
 Perfect Dark Zero was released in two forms : the standard version and a " Limited Collector 's Edition " . The collector 's edition features a second disc of content , a black metal game case , images of the staff and most of the in @-@ house testers which gave a glimpse behind the scenes at Rare , a special @-@ edition comic booklet which sets the scene for the game , titled Hong Kong Sunrise , and one of nine holographic collectible cards . The game has reportedly sold in excess of one million units worldwide . As a result , it was one of the first games to be re @-@ released under the " Platinum Hits " list . In 2015 , it was announced that Perfect Dark Zero could be played on the Xbox One via emulation . The game is also included in the Rare Replay video game compilation .

 Shortly after the game 's release , new multiplayer scenarios and a counter @-@ operative mode like the one found in the original Perfect Dark were said to eventually become freely available as downloadable content . Senior game designer Duncan Botwood later clarified that it was unlikely to happen due to technical issues . According to him , " It would have required much groundwork to be laid in the core AI code , which meant that it was unlikely to be available as downloadable content post @-@ release . " He also remarked that the counter @-@ operative mode was planned during the development of the game , but was eventually rejected due to the pressure to cut planned content . 
 In May 2006 , an auto @-@ update was made available on Xbox Live , responsible for fixing some bugs and adding additional multiplayer options to the game . The bug fixes included code to prevent an ongoing problem where players could walk through the air , an issue where some weapons could make use of rapid fire , and a map @-@ exiting glitch , among others . The new multiplayer options provide seven additional new bot types and the ability to use bots in DarkOps matches , since bots had only one AI variant and were only available in DeathMatch scenarios when the game was released . Additionally , a playable demo of the game was made freely available on the Xbox Live Marketplace shortly afterwards . The demo includes one campaign mission that can be played in solo mode or co @-@ operatively , and a new multiplayer map . 
 Rare released a multiplayer map pack , called Perfect Dark Zero Map Pack One , to the Xbox Live Marketplace on June 7 , 2006 . It contains the demo 's new multiplayer map as well as three other new maps to add to the game 's original six . Unlike the game 's default maps , the new maps only have one variant instead of two . On October 31 , 2006 , Rare announced that a special platinum edition of Perfect Dark Zero would be released , and would include the first map pack and two additional maps . The two new maps were later released for free in a pack called Perfect Dark Zero Map Pack Two . These maps are updated versions of two maps from the original Perfect Dark : Felicity and Ruins . The pack was released on November 1 , 2006 for Gold Members and on November 8 , 2006 for Silver Members .

 Critical reception for Perfect Dark Zero was divided but generally positive , garnering a Metacritic aggregated review score of 81 out of 100 respectively . GameSpot 's Greg Kasavin awarded the game a rating of 9 @.@ 0 out of 10 and an Editors Choice , stating that Perfect Dark Zero " champions the Xbox 360 with its excellent assortment of single and multiplayer game types , as well as its incredible good looks and dynamic , intense action . " He also concluded that the game " delivers just about everything you could hope for from a first @-@ person shooter . " Charles Onyett of IGN praised the game 's replay value , but also criticized single @-@ player aspects such as the weak artificial intelligence of enemies , commenting that " they never display any advanced assault tactics . " 
 The graphics were highlighted positively . Kasavin was impressed with the amount of lighting and motion blur effects , and noted that the " excellent character animation helps make the guns feel as powerful as they look . " Bryn Williams of GameSpy considered the graphics as a " stunning look at what the 360 hardware is capable of " , but also admitted that the animation " is a little too slow and sometimes creates an unwelcome sense of cartoonishness " . IGN credited the attractive gun models , explosions , and sprawling vistas , but also felt that some areas such as the South American Ruins can unnecessarily look too shiny . The game 's audio was said to feature " heavy @-@ hitting weapon effects [ and ] fantastic , moody soundtrack that gives each mission its own pulsing rhythms " . 
 The game 's weapons were very well received . Reviewers praised the gun management and the implementation of the guns . GameSpot commented , " It doesn 't stray too far from convention , but it features some interesting twists in weapon and enemy design , making for a much more entertaining experience than the average shooter . " Critics generally agreed that the roll and cover system worked well and that they did not feel overpowered , but some criticized the fact that players need to be in a specific spot to use the cover mode . Reviewers considered the story and voice acting to be weak . IGN said that it is almost impossible not to notice how " laughably bad it is " , and that many plot twists are presented then never resolved , but also admitted that it does not really factor into the gameplay . GameCritics reviewer Mike Bracken commented , " It 's always sad when there 's voice acting in a game and I find myself being embarrassed for the voice actors . " Nevertheless , GameSpot added that the game 's weapon fire and musical score " easily drown this out . " 
 Publications judged the co @-@ op aspect of the game well . Kristan Reed of Eurogamer praised the fact that the missions were " designed with co @-@ op in mind . " He noted that , for example , the third level " has Joanna providing cover fire for her father Jack as he hops from one point of the level to the next . In the single player campaign Jack 's AI controlled , but co @-@ op lets you take direct control of his actions , making the experience a much more engaging affair all @-@ round . " Multiplayer matches of Perfect Dark Zero were widely well received . GameSpot stated that " the excellent weapon selection , flexibility of options , high @-@ quality maps , and smooth online performance ... make for a rock @-@ solid competitive shooter . " IGN stated similar pros , calling it " enormous " . 1UP.com reviewer Che Chou also praised the multiplayer , but observed that " constantly roll @-@ dodging to avoid enemy fire at close range [ ... ] combined with the exceptionally slow movement speed of your character ... can occasionally be highly frustrating for beginners . " 
 Despite solid reviews , numerous publications remarked that Perfect Dark Zero did not meet the expectations . According to GameCritics , " It took Rare a whole console generation to do it ... and the wait wasn 't really worth it " . Game Informer found it to be quite disappointing and gave the game a 7 out of 10 , reviewing it under the tagline " Don 't believe the hype " . In a positive review , GameSpy observed that " Perfect Dark Zero is a lot of fun and does a lot of things very well , but it 's just not the killer @-@ app that we 'd all hoped for " . In 2010 , GameTrailers placed the game 6th in their list of the " Top 10 Disappointments of the Decade " and 10th in their " Top 10 Worst Sequels " list .

 Mountain railways of India are the six or seven odd " <unk> " ( Hindi for small ) lines , out of around 20 similar such narrow or metre gauge remaining in operation around the world . Built during the nineteenth and early twentieth century of British colonial rule ( the Raj ) , these lines have been running since then . Today the Indian Railways runs them , along with the Kashmir Railway , operational since 2005 . While four of these seven : the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway ( 1881 ) , the Kalka – Shimla Railway ( 1898 ) , the Kangra Valley Railway Pathankot ( 1924 ) , and the Kashmir Railway ( 2005 ) , are in the rugged hill regions of the Himalayas of Northern India , two are further down south in the Western Ghats : the Nilgiri Mountain Railway in Tamil Nadu , and the Matheran Hill Railway in Maharashtra ; while the Lumding – Silchar line , built at the turn of the 20th century , lies deep inside Assam , in the Barak river valley of the <unk> Hills . The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway , the Nilgiri Mountain Railway and the Kalka – Shimla Railway have collectively been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . 
 These lines connect important hill resorts with the foot hills , winding their way up through rugged yet scenic mountainous landscape . Given the terrain they were constructed on during the British colonial period , they were considered " outstanding examples of the interchange of values on developments in technology " and engineering marvels . 
 = = History = = 
 The mountain railways in the hills emerged as a result of the delayed interest evinced during the British Raj for establishing control over the Himalayas and other mountain ranges of India . It was in 1844 that Sir John Lawrence , the then Viceroy of India , had mooted the idea of a phased colonization of the hills , particularly as military garrisons . The British , in a proposal termed simply as ‘ Hill Railway ’ , considered establishing geographically and culturally rich , stations across the country . The hill stations chosen for this purpose were Shimla , the then ' summer capital ' of British India ; Darjeeling , known for its tea gardens and scenic views of the eastern Himalayas in the state of West Bengal , the Kangra Valley in Himachal Pradesh , Ootacamund in the Nilgiri mountains of Tamil Nadu and the Matheran hill station in the Western Ghats near Mumbai were considered . 
 The pioneering effort to link the mountainous terrain of enchanting beauty with a hill passenger railway commenced in 1878 with the building of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway line , when Franklin <unk> of the then Eastern Bengal Railway initiated plans for the building of a hill tramway along the alignment of the Hill Cart Road from Siliguri to Darjeeling . Construction subsequently began , and in 1881 the line was commissioned up to Darjeeling . 
 The next project launched was of the Nilgiri Mountain Railway in Tamil Nadu , initially proposed in 1854 . Work started in 1894 , but the railway was not completed until 1908 , as the terrain was very difficult , given the big difference in altitude ranging between 326 meters ( 1 @,@ 070 ft ) and 2 @,@ 203 meters ( 7 @,@ 228 ft ) over a distance of 46 kilometers ( 29 mi ) . The building of the 96 kilometers ( 60 mi ) Kalka – Shimla railway link commenced in 1898 to open up the remote hill regions to the rest of the country and was inaugurated by the then Viceroy , Lord Curzon , in November 1903 . The Matheran – Neral ' toy train ' was commissioned in 1907 ; Matheran is a hill station 108 kilometers ( 67 mi ) away from Mumbai . The Kangra line was built in 1929 in the picturesque Kangra valley . 
 The UNESCO 's ' World Heritage site ' recognition to three of the mountain railways of India has been for " outstanding examples of bold , ingenious engineering solutions for the problem of establishing an effective rail link through a rugged , mountainous terrain . " The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway got it first in 1999 , the Nilgiri Mountain Railway followed suit in 2005 , and the Kalka – Shimla Railway , in 2008 ; the three together have been titled as ' Mountain Railways of India ' under Criteria : ii , iv under the region in the Asia @-@ Pacific . The claims of the Matheran Railway , the fourth hill line , is pending acceptance by the international body .
