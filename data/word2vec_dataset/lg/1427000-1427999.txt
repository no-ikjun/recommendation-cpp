 Most reviewers felt that though the gameplay and storyline had not changed much since the first games , Diamond and Pearl were still engaging . Ryan Davis of GameSpot said , " [ I ] t 's a little surprising how well the formula holds up in Diamond and Pearl , which is a testament to the strong fundamentals of the series as well as the quality of the execution . " The games ' Wi @-@ Fi connectivity also earned largely positive reviews . 1UP.com called the addition of wireless connectivity the games ' " biggest improvements " . GameSpot and GameSpy both listed the addition of online play as one of the positive points of the games and called the system " robust " and " probably the most significant new feature . " ComputerAndVideoGames.com said of the Global Trade Center , " Suddenly , Pokémon feels properly alive for the first time since playgrounds were abuzz with monsters in the late ' 90s – and you 'll instantly forgive Game Freak their technical stubbornness the first time you switch on your DS and find the level 100 <unk> you craved is on your cart . " 
 The graphics generally received positive reviews . GameSpot praised the blend of 2D and 3D graphics , and GameZone said that the graphics were " better than what I had originally imagined " and that " a Pokemon title hasn 't ever looked this good on a handheld . " GameSpy felt that the graphics , though simple , made the game " a pleasure to explore " . ComputerAndVideoGames.com , however , said that " the so @-@ called ' 3D ' isn 't up to much : it 's just a viewpoint shuffle , with DS 's gutsy engine taking a nice long nap between the odd hypnotic windfarm or fog effect . " The audio was not so well @-@ received : IGN felt that the cries made by the Pokémon " still screech with the flair of the original Game Boy " and that the music , while " more advanced " , was " not much beyond [ Game Boy Advance ] quality " . GameZone also felt that the sounds had not been updated , saying " This [ the audio ] is the only area that hasn 't taken one step forward . It remains stagnant and doesn 't show any progression over the GBA titles " . GameSpot cited the games ' " recycled " sounds as one of the negative points .

 = Missamma = 
 Missamma ( English : Miss Madam ) is a 1955 Indian bilingual romantic comedy film directed by L. V. Prasad . Produced by B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani 's Vijaya Vauhini Studios simultaneously in Telugu and Tamil languages , the film 's script was adapted by the latter from two Indian Bengali @-@ language novels — Rabindranath Maitra 's Manmoyee Girls School and <unk> Bandyopadhyay 's Detective . In addition to being a romantic comedy , Missamma also focused on various social issues such as unemployment , corruption , and freedom of worship . 
 Production began in early 1954 as a bilingual with altered casting for the Tamil version , which was titled Missiamma . The film narrates the story of two unemployed graduates of different religions and mentalities , M. T. Rao and Mary . They pretend as a married couple to gain employment in a high school established by Gopalam , the zamindar of Appapuram . As Rao and Mary fall in love with each other , Gopalam 's nephew A. K. Raju , an amateur detective , learns that Mary is Gopalam 's missing elder daughter Mahalakshmi , a truth she too was not aware of . 
 N. T. Rama Rao and Bhanumathi Ramakrishna were chosen as the lead pair , with Gemini Ganesan replacing the former in Missiamma . After a dispute with Bhanumathi , Chakrapani replaced her with Savitri . Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Jamuna were signed as the other lead pair , with K. A. Thangavelu replacing the former in Missiamma . S. V. Ranga Rao , Rushyendramani , Ramana Reddy , and Relangi Venkata Ramaiah played supporting roles ; M. N. Nambiar and K. Sarangkapani replaced the latter two in the Tamil version . C. P. Jambulingam and Kalyanam edited the film ; Marcus Bartley provided the cinematography , and S. Rajeswara Rao composed the music . 
 The principal photography , carried out in and around Madras ( now Chennai ) , was wrapped in December 1954 with a final reel length of 4 @,@ 964 metres ( 16 @,@ 286 ft ) . Missamma was released on 12 January 1955 , two days before Missiamma 's theatrical debut . Both were commercially successful ; the Telugu version completed a 100 day run in 13 centres . The bilingual provided recognition to its principal cast and Vijaya Vauhini Studios . Terms and phrases from Missamma later became a part of Telugu vernacular . AVM Productions remade the film in Hindi as Miss Mary in 1957 which marked Prasad 's directorial debut in Bollywood . Bapu , <unk> Venkata Ramana and Raavi Kondala Rao rewrote and adapted Missamma as Pelli <unk> in 1991 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Gopalam , the zamindar of Appapuram , is the principal of the high school named after his elder daughter Mahalakshmi . When a child , she went missing during a pilgrimage to the Godavari river <unk> in Kakinada . Conditions at the school deteriorate because of poor management by Gopalam 's nephew A. K. Raju , an amateur detective . This is exacerbated by having Panthulu , a doctor who practises ayurvedic medicine , teaching the children . Gopalam decides to replace them and appoint two graduates of opposite gender , preferably a married couple , both skilled in music . They would train Sita , his younger daughter , in addition to their teaching duties at the school . 
 Mahalakshmi was found and adopted by a Christian couple , Mr. and Mrs. Paul , who named her Mary . Having completed her graduation , Mary looks for employment to clear her family 's financial problems . She accepted a loan from I. P. David who proposes that if she marries him , he would preclude the debt . Her ex @-@ colleague M. T. Rao , another graduate , is searching for a solution to his financial problems . They decide that if they were to act as a married couple , they could apply for the jobs offered by Gopalam and intend to clear their debts . Devaiah , a conman and a beggar , befriends them . He is persuaded by Rao to accompany them to Appapuram . They find accommodation in a small house which is behind Gopalam 's bungalow . Mary decides to call herself Mahalakshmi , unaware of her true identity . 
 Gopalam and Ammi , his wife , are instinctively jovial in nature . They treat the couple as if they are own children . Mary finds the Hindu customs weird , but is afraid to express her grievance to the old couple as she needs to keep her job to repay David 's loan . Instead , she vents her frustration on Rao and Devaiah , who bear it with patience . Although Sita wanted Mary to teach her music , the latter 's short @-@ temper makes her lose her self @-@ confidence . Rao is pleased to take over her music lessons . 
 Mary 's dissatisfaction reaches new heights and she decides to reveal the entire truth to Gopalam and Ammi . Anxious to save their jobs , Rao makes up a far @-@ fetched explanation that that Mary is possessed by the soul of a Christian woman who is named after the mother of Jesus . Attempting to fool Mary 's soul , Gopalam lies to her , telling her that he would conduct Sita 's marriage with Rao . Raju , like Gopalam , is unaware that Rao is fooling them and feels insecure . Being in love with Sita , Raju wants to keep Rao away from her and turns to Mary for help in teaching music . This proves to be a disaster . At the end of their first month at the school , Rao and Mary receive their salaries . Mary is able to repay her debt . 
 Raju begins suspecting that Mary is the missing Mahalakshmi . Ammi had told him that Mahalakshmi 's right foot has a mole . Seeking confirmation , and accompanied by his assistant and a torch , Raju plans to make an illicit entry at night into her room . The plan backfires when they disturb Mary 's sleep . In her sleep , she dreams of David forcing her to marry him and Rao coming to her rescue . She starts to develop feelings for Rao . 
 At the end of the following month , Mary wants to visit Madras and stay with the Pauls . At first , Rao requests her to stay . Her reluctance makes Rao change his mind ; he plans to lie later that Mary is dead following an illness . Gopalam and Ammi misunderstand , believing that Mary may be pregnant . They conduct a party in the evening and Mary is confused . On the night before she is due to leave , Rao fakes a leg fracture in an attempt to delay her departure . David arrives in the morning and informs Raju that Mary , a Christian , is pretending as a Hindu for the job . Raju retrieves a necklace stolen by David from Mary 's house in Madras ; Mahalakshmi wore it when she was lost . 
 David insists that Mary should be married to him but she refuses , and announces her love for Rao . The Pauls come to Gopalam 's house . Raju solves the mystery and gets David arrested . Mary learns that Gopalam and Ammi are her biological parents but she does not lose her relationship with her foster family . Learning that Rao and Mahalakshmi are not married yet , Gopalam announces their wedding along with that of Sita with Raju .

 B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani signed L. V. Prasad to direct a bilingual film titled Missamma in Telugu and Missiamma in Tamil under the production banner of Vijaya Vauhini Studios . The film 's script , which was written by Chakrapani himself , was based on both Rabindranath Maitra 's Manmoyee Girls School and <unk> <unk> 's Detective . The story of Manmoyee Girls School revolves around two unemployed young people , pretending to be married , seeking employment and subsequently falling in love with each other . Chakrapani thought it too limiting to be made as a film with a duration of more than 150 minutes . Taking inspiration from the basic storyline of Detective , where an enthusiastic detective takes up the case of finding a missing woman and ultimately marries her , he melded them together . Prasad 's bonding with Khan , a Muslim tailor near <unk> Studios in Bombay ( now Mumbai ) , formed the basis of the concept of friendship between two educated bachelors of varied faiths . 
 Pingali Nagendrarao and Thanjai N. Ramaiah Dass wrote the dialogue for the Telugu and Tamil versions respectively . Marcus Bartley was recruited as the director of photography and the duo C. P. Jambulingam and Kalyanam edited the film . Madhavapeddi Gokhale and Kaladhar were the art directors . The film was processed at Vijaya Laboratory and was recorded on Western Electric . M. S. Chalapathi Rao and Jagannadham were the executive producers .

 Although Pathala Bhairavi ( 1951 ) and Pelli Chesi Choodu ( 1952 ) were <unk> shot simultaneously in Telugu and Tamil , the same actors were retained in both versions in their respective roles ; Missamma , however , became the first bilingual film of Vijaya Vauhini Studios to feature a different set of male actors . The makers chose N. T. Rama Rao and Bhanumathi Ramakrishna as the lead pair in the Telugu version , with Gemini Ganesan replacing Rama Rao in the Tamil version . S. V. Ranga Rao – Rushyendramani and Doraswamy – Meenakshi were cast in the roles of the titular character 's biological parents and foster parents respectively in both versions . Including the leads , all the artistes in both the versions used the same range of costumes . Ranga Rao , however , had to sport a <unk> for the Tamil version adhering to Tamil culture and traditions . 
 Prasad had completed shooting four reels of the film featuring Bhanumathi . In between her shooting schedules , Bhanumathi wrote a letter to the producers informing that she would shoot only in the afternoon because of the Varalakshmi <unk> being conducted at her residence . The letter went unnoticed and Chakrapani , a strict disciplinarian in nature , had a dispute with her for arriving too late to the sets . When Bhanumathi refused to apologise , Chakrapani burnt the four reels in front of her , leaving her insulted and resulting in her opting out of the project . Nagi Reddy came to know about the letter and tried to solve the issues between the two , but both Chakrapani and Bhanumathi refused to work together . Chakrapani immediately ordered Prasad to replace Bhanumathi with Savitri , who was initially selected to play the role of Sita . Jamuna was signed later for Sita 's role , upon Savitri 's recommendation . 
 Casting Savitri benefited the Tamil version as a better on @-@ screen chemistry was observed between Savitri and Ganesan , who secretly married each other back in 1952 before the film 's shoot began . After the release of Devadasu ( 1953 ) , Akkineni Nageswara Rao wanted to shed the tragic @-@ romantic hero image and took up the comic role in Missamma . Nageswara Rao was believed to have accepted the role for higher remuneration , until he opened up to the media and clarified his motive of agreeing to play the role . He went on to add that in his entire career , Missamma was the only film he lobbied to be a part of . K. A. Thangavelu and K. Sarangkapani reprise the roles played by Nageswara Rao and Relangi Venkata Ramaiah from the Telugu version in the Tamil version . M. N. Nambiar and Ramana Reddy were cast as the antagonists of the Tamil and Telugu versions . Balakrishna and A. Karunanidhi were cast as the assistants of Nageswara Rao and Thangavelu respectively . Chakrapani did not make any alterations to this character while adapting it from Detective , but the body languages of the artistes were altered . 
 Gummadi Venkateswara Rao was recommended to Chakrapani by Madhavapeddi <unk> . After auditioning other actors , Chakrapani asked Gummadi to make a cameo appearance as an interviewer . He shot for a day and was paid around ₹ 500 — 1000 , a relatively high salary by the standards of the time ( two thousand rupees were paid for twenty days to actors playing major roles in films ) . Chakrapani stated that Gummadi was paid such a high remuneration so that he can maintain his family including three children who had then shifted to Madras ( now Chennai ) . For the photoshoot , Rama Rao lent Gummadi his coat and applied tilak on his forehead . Allu Ramalingaiah was cast in a comic role of a teacher @-@ cum @-@ ayurveda doctor Panthulu . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Principal photography began in early 1954 , with both versions with different casts being shot simultaneously throughout the process . The sequence where M. T. Rao and Mary lie to each other before boarding a bus to attend an interview after being fired from their current temporary jobs was shot at the Chandamama office building . The high school set was also erected near the same building . A photograph of Nagi Reddy 's younger brother and cinematographer B. N. Konda Reddy 's daughter was used in the film as that of Gopalam 's missing elder daughter . The sequence from Missiamma where Ganesan 's character manages to persuade Savitri 's character to pretend to be his wife was filmed at My Lady 's Garden in Madras . 
 Pasumarthi Krishnamurthy choreographed the film 's songs . For the songs " <unk> Madana " and " Brindavanamadi Andaridi Govindudu Andarivadele " , Sita 's character should practice Kuchipudi dance . Since the former song was a <unk> , Jamuna rehearsed for both the songs for about a month as she was not trained in traditional dancing . She took care of the minute details during the rehearsals . Filming was delayed because of Bhanumathi 's exit and the difficulty in handling different casts at the same time . The process lasted for a year and wrapped by the end of December 1954 . The final reel length of the bilingual was approximately 4 @,@ 964 metres ( 16 @,@ 286 ft ) . After watching the final edited version , Nagi Reddy and Chakrapani gifted Dodge cars to the film 's principal cast . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Chakrapani promoted Missamma as a " film for kids which should also be watched by adults . " He never encouraged sermonising in films serving as a medium of entertainment , and retorted that people interested in doing so can send telegrams to viewers instead of making films . Chakrapani also ensured that his characters bear no influence of Charlie Chaplin 's style of comedy , and opted for regional sensibilities . In his 2015 book Madras Studios : Narrative , Genre , and Ideology in Tamil Cinema , film scholar Swarnavel Eswaran Pillai noted that the film interweaves the genres of romantic comedy and melodrama to narrate Mary 's love story . 
 Apart from the protagonists , the film focuses on the lives of Mary 's biological and foster parents . Four other characters — Mary 's creditor I. P. David , Rao 's friend Devaiah , a school teacher @-@ cum @-@ doctor Panthulu , and Raju 's stoic assistant Govinda — influence the film 's plot . Opining that comedy and suspense cannot be maintained effectively together , Chakrapani revealed Mary 's true identity to the audience in the film 's initial stages . The characters in the film , including Mary , are guarded from her true identity until the climax . Pa . <unk> of Dinamani described Mary an antithesis of Savitri 's role in Devadasu ( 1953 ) . The reception of Mary 's occasional modern dressing and behaviour was utilised by Chakrapani to explain the limitations of the yesteryear orthodox south Indian families . In her 2002 book Cinema of Interruptions : Action Genres in Contemporary Indian Cinema , Lalitha Gopalan noted that the male protagonists in Indian films use the piano to express their desire with no regard to the consequences and cited Gemini Ganesan in Missiamma as an example for the same . The lyrics of the song " Adavari Matalaku <unk> Verule " commented on the complex behaviour of women with their fellow men , with Rao 's character lip syncing them . 
 According to Pillai , Missamma was one of those films which shed light on the subtle and indirect way the Telugu filmmakers dealt with the troublesome environment in Madras surrounding Tamil language and culture during the <unk> Movement . He also added that the Krishna @-@ Godavari river dispute between Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh enabled the viewers to understand the metaphoric illustration of <unk> as something which signifies a strong loss . While the lyrics of the songs " <unk> Chey " addressed the plight of the beggars , " <unk> <unk> " commented on the changing views of the society on various affairs . Another song " Sitaram Sitaram " was considered a satire on corrupt politicians , especially for the line " <unk> Bhale <unk> , <unk> Velu tama <unk> " ( which translates to " Fundraising turns self promotion , as hundreds and thousands are being used for self consumption " ) . 
 In addition to the above , Missamma also dealt with issues such as unemployment and Freedom of Worship . Rama Rao 's character M. T. Rao is often pronounced as " Empty " Rao , which <unk> of <unk> found a reflection of the humiliations faced by unemployed graduates . Prasad 's struggles in the early part of his career influenced the statements of unemployment and the state of being a learned " misfit " . Pillai noted that Chakrapani 's " poignant dialogues " concerning the unemployment of the educated young people undermined his unilateral projection as a mainstream writer . He also pointed out that in the scenes where Mary faces situations challenging her faith as a devout catholic , Chakrapani and Prasad " underscore their imperative to highlight the differences " and " make a plea for peaceful co @-@ existence " . 
 = = Music = = 
 The official soundtracks of Missamma and Missiamma were composed by S. Rajeswara Rao , the lyrics of which were written by Pingali Nagendrarao and Thanjai N. Ramaiah Dass for the Telugu and Tamil versions respectively . The sound mixing process was supervised by A. Krishnan and Siva Ram . It was processed by N. C. Sen Gupta and was orchestrated by A. Krishnamurthy . 
 When Nagi Reddy informed Bhanumathi that P. Leela would be singing for her character , Bhanumathi , herself a playback singer , refused to let anyone else sing for her . After she left the project , Leela was signed on to sing for Savitri . Unlike their previous films , Vijaya Vauhini Studios preferred A. M. Rajah over Ghantasala Venkateswara Rao to sing for Rama Rao in the Telugu version for unknown reasons . Chakrapani chose P. Susheela to sing the remaining two songs featuring Jamuna , after being impressed with her rendition of the song " <unk> <unk> " in the film Kanna <unk> ( 1953 ) . Although she had recorded for Donga Ramudu ( 1955 ) first , Missamma released earlier and gave her a breakthrough as a singer . Despite singing the songs " <unk> Chey " and " Sitaram Sitaram " , Relangi Venkata Ramaiah 's name was not featured in the film 's credits as a playback singer . 
 The soundtrack of the Telugu version was released on 1 December 1955 while that of the Tamil version was released on 31 December 1955 ; both were marketed by HMV . The soundtrack was a huge commercial success , with " Adavari Matalaku <unk> Verule " , in particular , achieving classic status and being considered to be an expression of subtle romance . Songs like " <unk> <unk> " , " <unk> <unk> " , " Ennai <unk> Mary <unk> " and " <unk> <unk> " become popular among the Tamil diaspora .

 The Telugu version of Missamma was released on 12 January 1955 , whereas the Tamil version was released two days later , on the festive occasion of Thai Pongal . Both versions were released with a run time of 179 — 181 minutes . Both versions were commercially successful , with the Telugu version completing a theatrical run of 100 days in 13 centres . According to Pillai , the speculations about Savitri 's real life romance with Ganesan played a key role in the Tamil version 's success . In February 2006 , a postage stamp of Gemini Ganesan was released by <unk> Maran in Chennai ; Missiamma was screened on the occasion . 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 Missamma received positive reviews from critics upon its release . Writing for Swatantra magazine , <unk> " Gora " Sastry praised Missamma for its universal theme and clean , subtle comedy . The February 1955 issue of Kumudam called Missiamma " an interesting film with quality humor " , adding , " In the beginning one is uneasy as to how the love affair of a Christian heroine and a Hindu hero is going to be retooled for a comedy " but stated that the director " has used every difficult situation as an opportunity for boundless humor . " It also praised the " moonlit sequence " and Bartley 's cinematography , while the magazine Gundoosi described <unk> 's acting as " the best so far " . In L.V. Prasad : a monograph ( 1993 ) , film historian K. N. T. Sastry noted , " <unk> cinema was to be considered a tool to forget our worries — here indeed was entertainment : Missiamma answered that definition . " 
 In November 2012 , The Times of India stated that the film 's cast adds a dramatic twist to the story and called its narration a " powerful " one which " will grip the viewer till the end " . In a special article authored post Nageswara Rao 's death in January 2014 , Gautaman Bhaskaran of Hindustan Times called Missiamma a " powerful social document that spoke about the importance of religious tolerance " with the help of its leads . In October 2014 , M. L. Narasimham of The Hindu praised the performances of Missamma 's cast , particularly that of Savitri . He added that Marcus Bartley 's " mesmerising " cinematography and Rajeswara Rao 's music were the film 's highlights apart from Prasad 's direction and Chakrapani 's screenplay . Narasimham added that Nageswara Rao 's performance as Raju " proved that he is equally capable of carrying a comedian ’ s role with aplomb " . In January 2015 , <unk> called Missamma a fine mix of humour and message and praised the screenplay written by Chakrapani for its gripping nature .

 Missamma is one of the popular Telugu films of the 1950s featuring Ramana Reddy and Relangi Venkata Ramaiah , who were considered the Laurel and Hardy of Telugu cinema at the time . According to Film News Anandan , a film historian , the success of Missamma influenced filmmakers to cast different actors for different versions of their films . The phrase " Adavari Matalaku <unk> Verule " became an idiom in Telugu , and the word " <unk> " spelt by Devaiah 's character throughout the film became a synonymous term in the language for cash . On 23 January 1955 , a 19 @-@ year @-@ old woman named <unk> gave birth to a baby girl in Roxy theatre , Madras while watching Missiamma . Both of them were rushed to Egmore Maternity Hospital where the baby was named Missiamma . Missiamma 's success made Ganesan adopt the screen name Gemini Ganesan in order to avoid his name being confused with that of Sivaji Ganesan , another popular actor in Tamil cinema . The film proved to be a major breakthrough in the careers of Savitri and Jamuna as well . 
 P. Leela later went on to sing the songs of Missamma in various concerts of hers and received highly positive response every time . The song " <unk> <unk> " from the Malayalam @-@ language film <unk> ( 1957 ) is loosely based on the song " Brindavanamadi Andaridi Govindudu Andarivadele " . Prasad and Chakrapani later collaborated for Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu ( 1959 ) , which was an above @-@ average grosser until its profitable run during its re @-@ release . In their 2013 book Routledge Handbook of Indian Cinemas , K. Moti Gokulsing and Wimal Dissanayake wrote that Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu , Missamma , Gundamma Katha ( 1962 ) and Ramudu Bheemudu ( 1964 ) " represented the scope comedy had in the 1950s and 60s . " The basic story line of <unk> Oru Malayali ( 1971 ) was noted for its similarity with Missamma as its female lead , a Christian , acts as a Brahmin girl . According to B. Vijayakumar of The Hindu , this prompted Chakrapani to remake the film in Telugu as Sri Rajeswari Vilas Coffee Club in 1976 . 
 The song " Adavari Matalaku <unk> Verule " was remixed by Mani Sharma without any alterations in its tune and lyrics for the Telugu @-@ language film Kushi ( 2001 ) . The song was sung by <unk> <unk> who was referred to as " Kushi " Murali after the success of the remixed version . G. Neelakanta Reddy titled his 2003 comedy film as Missamma which had no other similarity with this film . In September 2006 , a postage stamp commemorating Prasad was issued in Hyderabad . M. L. Narasimham , in an article about the honour , listed Missamma with Shavukaru ( 1950 ) , <unk> ( 1950 ) , Pelli Chesi Choodu , <unk> ( 1954 ) , Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu and others as acclaimed films by the director after the release of Mana Desam ( 1949 ) and his association with Vijaya Vauhini Studios . 
 In late November 2007 , a Hyderabad @-@ based company named Goldstone Technologies acquired the film negative rights of 14 Telugu films produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios , including Mayabazar ( 1957 ) and Missamma , to release their digitally re @-@ mastered versions in colour . Though the digitally remastered and colourised version of Mayabazar released in January 2010 and was commercially successful , Goldstone Technologies decided not to remaster the remaining 14 films including Missamma , saying that most of the producers who sold the rights of the negatives to TV channels lost control over them . Goldstone furthermore added that there were also a lot of legal issues over ownership and copyright issues whenever other producers try to do something on their own . However , the colourised version of the song " Brindavanamadi Andaridi Govindudu Andarivadele " was used in the opening credits of the film Brindavanam ( 2010 ) . 
 In November 2012 , The Times of India listed Missamma along with other unrelated films such as Gundamma Katha , Mayabazar , Narthanasala ( 1963 ) , and Bommarillu ( 2006 ) in the list " Telugu classics to watch along with family this Deepavali " . In commemoration of the Centenary of Indian Cinema , The Hindu listed Missamma along with Pathala Bhairavi , Mayabazar , Gundamma Katha , Maduve Madi Nodu ( 1965 ) , Ram Aur Shyam ( 1967 ) , Julie ( 1975 ) , and Shriman Shrimati ( 1982 ) as the iconic films produced by Nagi Reddy .

 Mega Man Network Transmission , known in Japan as Rockman EXE Transmission ( ロックマン <unk> <unk> , Rokkuman <unk> <unk> ) , is a video game developed by <unk> and published by Capcom and ShoPro Entertainment for the Nintendo GameCube console . The game was first released in Japan on 6 March 2003 , North America the following June , and PAL regions the following July . Network Transmission is part of the Mega Man Battle Network series , which originated on the Game Boy Advance ( GBA ) handheld . 
 Taking place one month after the events of the first Megaman Battle Network game , the plot follows the protagonist Lan Hikari and his online avatar MegaMan.EXE in their fight against the " WWW ( World Three ) " organization and its attempt to unleash and spread the infectious " Zero Virus " into cyberspace . The player controls MegaMan through a set of levels that require actions such as jumping , sliding , and shooting , as well as the use of special " Battle Chips " that grant the player various combat and movement abilities . Network Transmission combines action and platforming gameplay elements from older Mega Man games with the strategy and role @-@ playing elements as defined by the Battle Network series . 
 The development team 's intent was to meld these attributes into a home console title that would appeal to the young gamer audience that they found with the GBA series . Critical reception for Network Transmission has been mostly average reviews . Although it received some positive remarks for its Battle Chip gameplay , many critics have complained that the game features a high or unbalanced difficulty level . The game 's sound and its combination of 2D and 3D cel @-@ shaded graphics have been met with varied opinions . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The storyline of Megaman Network Transmission takes place during the first decade of the 21st century ( " 200X " ) , one month after the original Megaman Battle Network . Following the defeat of the " Life Virus " , the ultimate weapon of Dr. Wily and the " WWW ( World Three ) " organization , Lan Hikari and his network navigator ( NetNavi ) MegaMan.EXE return to a life of ease . However , no sooner does Lan begin to relax when he hears of a mysterious and destructive computer virus called the " Zero Virus " that infects Navis and causes mayhem via his personal information terminal ( PET ) e @-@ mail . Lan has other qualms to deal with however , receiving an e @-@ mail detailing fellow NetNavi <unk> being trapped in the internet . MegaMan goes to save her , finding an infected <unk> as the cause of trouble . Defeating him , the duo talk to <unk> 's operator , Mr. Match , and learn of the vaccine being distributed to amend the Zero Virus is actually doing just the opposite , having caused <unk> to go berserk . 
 Confirming this with Lan 's father , Dr. Yuichiro Hikari , the two set out to search for the cure of the problem , finding many situations of pragmatic Navis infected and causing mayhem . Stopping all of them and returning them to their respective operators , the two eventually discover more clues leading to the remnants of the WWW . It is revealed that a powerful Navi called <unk> has been distributing the virus . After defeating <unk> , MegaMan and Lan engage in a climatic battle against the powerful super virus Zero himself . However , at the conclusion of the battle , just as the finishing blow is about to be delivered to Zero , the heroes discover he is not evil . Lan 's father then transforms him into a full @-@ fledged Navi . However , their happiness is short @-@ lived as a former member of the WWW simply named " Professor " reveals this was all part of his scheme to revive the dreaded Life Virus . Analyzing clues , MegaMan and Lan engage and defeat the second Life Virus and use Zero 's observation powers to eventually bring the Professor to justice . There is dialogue at the end of the game between <unk> and his operator Mr. Dark , leading the plot into the next chronological installment , Mega Man Battle Network 2 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Megaman Network Transmission incorporates aspects of action and platforming games similar to other Mega Man series , while retaining the strategy and role @-@ playing elements of the Battle Network series . The player takes control of the protagonist Lan within the game 's real world and his NetNavi MegaMan.EXE within its internet . Unlike previous games in this series , Lan is restricted from moving location to location . Instead , the player uses a map screen with points of interest to travel to different levels . Levels are opened up as the player progresses through the game , with a slight emphasis on linear progression , although MegaMan can move off @-@ path at times . Levels typically end in a boss battle with another NetNavi . Combat takes place in real @-@ time , with MegaMan given the ability to jump , slide , fire his default arm cannon , and dodge enemy attacks on a two @-@ dimensional plane . 
 Special abilities called " Battle Chips " are provided through a " Custom Bar " that slowly fills at the top of the screen . When the bar is full , the player can select up to five Battle Chips , which are provided from a folder of player @-@ selected chips . Ten random chips are available when the bar is full ; a total of twenty can be used for each level excursion . Battle Chips are used for dealing large amounts of damage to enemies , protecting and restoring the player 's health , summoning other Navi 's to MegaMan 's aid , and for some platforming abilities . Certain chips can even be combined to be more effective . Although Battle Chips are limited in quantity , they can be picked up from deleted enemies or can be purchased at shops when not exploring the internet . As in previous Battle Network games , items that upgrade MegaMan 's maximum health , firing power , and other attributes can also be accessed . 
 = = Development = = 
 Megaman Network Transmission was developed by <unk> , who had previously worked on the Street Fighter EX series , a 3D polygon rendition of publisher Capcom 's traditionally 2D fighting series . Producer Keiji Inafune revealed in an interview with Dengeki that after a string of PlayStation releases , the team chose to focus their development efforts of the Mega Man franchise for Nintendo consoles with the Battle Network series . They felt that children who played the GBA handheld were beginning to show interest in the GameCube , and that the character was more suitable to a console related to the Nintendo Family Computer , where the franchise originated . Inafune stated that the developer wanted to " preserve the core of Rockman " by transcending the traditional action elements ( i.e. running and jumping ) for the current gaming hardware from the perspective of the role @-@ playing series . 
 Network Transmission uses a cel @-@ shaded animation style to match the Mega Man NT Warrior anime series that was airing in Japan during the game 's development . Inafune explained that the team opted for an anime style with " eye @-@ catching effects " in place of a more realistic look because he felt it the former would be more enjoyable . Yuji Ishihara , the primary character artist for the Battle Network series , used many of his previous character designs for Network Transmission . One new contribution was updating his illustration for the revived Life Virus by giving it two fists per arm , among other details . " I thought it would be both an effective look , " Ishihara elaborated , " as well as make for a reasonably mobile character for a polygon @-@ based action game . " The musical score for Network Transmission was co @-@ composed by Shinji Hosoe , Ayako Saso , and Yousuke Yasui . Hosoe 's company Super Sweep Records has recently been given the rights to produce the soundtrack , and it was released as a part of Megaman 's 25th Anniversary on November 2 , 2012 . 
 Network Transmission was announced and on display for the first time at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2002 . The game was showcased at the Mega Man series 15th anniversary celebration event at the Makuhari Messe in Chiba Prefecture that December . A playable version made appearances in January 2003 at the World Hobby Fair in Osaka and at the Capcom Gamer 's Day event in Las Vegas . Finally , the game was on display at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles during the summer between its Japanese and North American releases .

 Media Create sales data for Japan shows that Mega Man Network Transmission sold 23 @,@ 147 copies during its first week on sale , 9 @,@ 041 copies during its second week , 7 @,@ 859 copies during its third week , and 4 @,@ 679 copies during its fifth week . A total of 79 @,@ 360 copies were sold in the country by the end of 2003 . A bargain @-@ priced version of the game was released in Japan on March 18 , 2004 . According to NPD Group , Network Transmission sold 30 @,@ 224 copies in North America , making it the eighth best @-@ selling GameCube game in the region for the month of June 2003 . 
 Network Transmission has been met with mixed critical reception . The game currently holds scores of 67 % on GameRankings and 65 out of 100 on Metacritic . A point of contempt for many critics was the game 's difficulty level . Skyler Miller of G4 summarized , " Network Transmission is painfully difficult not because of any genuine challenge , but because of its cheap enemies , frustrating weapons setup , and unnecessary complications . For example , you can only save after beating a boss , which is common in the Mega Man series . It 's tedious to have to wade your way through the relatively straightforward levels time and time again only to meet instant death against a boss . " GameSpy 's Benjamin Turner felt that the difficulty level was unbalanced rather than too steep , and that once a player gains a foothold on the gameplay and collects enough Battle Chips and power @-@ ups , the challenge subsides . Reviewers for Eurogamer , IGN , and GameSpot all similarly agreed that the greatest difficulty is presented toward the game 's start , particularly with its first few boss battles . 
 Opinions on the visuals and audio in Network Transmission have been decidedly split . Turner found the music perfectly fitting , but stated , " You may also be disappointed that the graphics don 't quite push the GameCube . They 're generally okay , and even pretty a few times , but overall the visuals are a bit spartan . " Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot described the backgrounds and animation as appropriate , that the Japanese voice acting matched the characters , and that the music was upbeat . However , he found the art style lacking in personality , the weapon effects and summons " understated " , and the sound effects " underdeveloped " . IGN 's Matt Casamassina was conversely impressed by the art style , backgrounds , and frame rate , but disliked the graphics as a whole , proclaiming , " It 's a brand new product , but it looks like it could have been released on PlayStation 1 , or perhaps even on Super Nintendo . " Miller found the game 's use of cel @-@ shading useless and the titular protagonist " the weakest link of all , looking undefined , vague , and more than a little awkward " . 
 The game 's integration of Battle Chips into the side @-@ scroller genre was admired by some reviewers . Casamassina was entertained by discovering and capitalizing on which chips are useful against which enemies . Turner was impressed by the random shuffling of chips in one 's inventory and the instances of forced improvisation on the player 's part . Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer expressed satisfaction with having the needed chips at the right times , but admitted frustration with having to disarm oneself to organize them . He asserted , " Even glancing at what you might move to the top of the list involves sending the blue bomber 's current chips back to the ' Folder ' , leaving you with a choice between edging forward with the paltry chargeable beam weapon and standing around waiting for your Custom bar to fill up again .

 Interstate 675 ( I @-@ 675 ) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway in the US state of Michigan . The freeway is a 7 @.@ 73 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 12 @.@ 44 km ) loop route through downtown Saginaw as I @-@ 75 passes on the east side of the city . I @-@ 675 is also a state trunkline highway that provided a bypass of the former drawbridge carrying I @-@ 75 and US Highway 23 ( US 23 ) across the Saginaw River . Construction of I @-@ 675 started in 1969 and the freeway opened in 1971 . Since then , sections near downtown were reconstructed in 2009 through 2011 to update one of the freeway 's interchanges and rebuild the bridge over the Saginaw River . 
 = = Route description = = 
 I @-@ 675 splits from I @-@ 75 on the eastern side of Saginaw , turning west toward downtown . The freeway runs between residential neighborhoods and has an interchange with Veterans Memorial Parkway . West of that interchange , it crosses a line of the Huron and Eastern Railway . From there , it runs on the northern edge of downtown near the Dow Event Center , crossing the Saginaw River on the Henry G. Marsh Bridge . On the west side of the river , the trunkline meets an interchange with M @-@ 58 . From there it turns northward , crossing a line of the Mid @-@ Michigan Railroad . I @-@ 675 continues northward , passing to the east of the <unk> E. Lutz VA Medical Center and through more residential neighborhoods in Saginaw Township North . After the interchange with Tittabawassee Road , which provides access to the Fashion Square Mall , I @-@ 675 turns northeasterly to merge back to I @-@ 75 north of the Zilwaukee Bridge . 
 Like other state highways in Michigan , I @-@ 675 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) . In 2011 , the department 's traffic surveys showed that on average , 20 @,@ 900 vehicles used the freeway daily across the river and 4 @,@ 000 vehicles did so each day north of Tittabawassee Road , the highest and lowest counts along the trunkline , respectively . As an Interstate Highway , all of I @-@ 675 is listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility .

 Initially planned in the mid @-@ 1950s , the I @-@ 675 freeway was under construction starting in 1969 . The freeway was completed in 1971 and opened to traffic that year . 
 For nearly a decade ( 1979 – 88 ) , I @-@ 675 served as an alternate route for traffic during construction of a new bridge across the Saginaw River for I @-@ 75 / US 23 at Zilwaukee . The original span , built in 1960 , was designed as a bascule bridge which could be raised to allow shipping traffic to use the river . Opening the drawbridge would back traffic up on the freeway for upwards of four hours on holiday weekends . I @-@ 675 helped relieve the congestion during such times , including during the major construction accident in August 1982 that delayed completion of the new bridge . Originally to be completed in 1983 , it finally opened on September 19 , 1988 . 
 Starting in May 2009 and ending in November 2011 , sections of I @-@ 675 were closed from exit 2 easterly to begin renovations during the summer construction seasons . These projects included rehabilitation of the Henry Marsh Bridge , the reconstruction of overpasses , and a redesigned exit at Warren Avenue to ease access into downtown Saginaw .

 SL79 is a class of 40 articulated trams operated by the Oslo Tramway of Norway . The trams were a variation of the Duewag trams that had been developed by the German manufacturer since the 1950s . The six @-@ axle vehicles are unidirectional with four doors on the right side . The trams can seat 77 passengers three and four abreast , with an additional 91 people able to stand . Power output is 434 kilowatts ( 582 hp ) , provided by two motors on the two end bogies , that supplement a central unpowered Jacobs bogie located under the articulation . The trams are 23 @.@ 0 metres ( 75 @.@ 5 ft ) long and 2 @.@ 5 metres ( 8 ft 2 in ) wide . They are capable of 80 kilometres per hour ( 50 mph ) and have standard gauge . 
 They were built in two series , the first of 25 units delivered in 1982 – 84 , and the second of 15 units delivered in 1989 – 90 . The first 10 units were built by Duewag , while the last 30 were built in Norway by Strømmen . They were numbered 101 through 140 . The two series vary slightly in specifications . The trams were ordered in 1979 after the 1977 decision to not close the tramway , after the SM53 were finished delivered in 1958 . The SL79 mainly serves on lines 11 , 12 and 19 . Except those with an advertising livery , the trams are painted a light blue . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1960 , the Oslo City Council decided to gradually close the tramway . New trams had been delivered in 1958 , and it was decided that lines would only be closed as trams were naturally retired . At the time Oslo Sporveier had 421 vehicles . By 1974 , the company had 163 vehicles , of which 100 were powered trams , 43 were trailers and 20 were working trailers . Following the energy crisis in the 1970s , the political climate changed , and in 1977 the city council decided to not close the tramway anyway . Between 1978 and 1981 , ten tram vehicles were bought from the Gothenburg Tramway . 
 In the 1950s , Duewag started to develop an articulated variation of its four @-@ axle <unk> , based on articulation technology used by trams in Rome . This design was delivered to many tramways , particularly in Germany . In 1977 and 1978 , Oslo Sporveier tested a Duewag <unk> ( <unk> ) tram from <unk> . In 1979 , Oslo Sporveier ordered ten vehicles from Duewag , with planned delivery in 1982 . In addition , fifteen units would be license @-@ built by Strømmens <unk> , with delivery the following year . All the motors were built by the Norwegian company Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri ( NEBB ) . The trams built in Germany were transported to Oslo by railway . The first vehicle was delivered on 13 April 1982 and put into service on 2 July . The last German @-@ built tram was put into service on 13 September . The German trams were numbered 101 through 110 . Oslo was the third tramway in the world to take into use thyristor controlled motors on the main part of their fleet of trams , after the systems in Helsinki , Finland , and Hanover , Germany . 
 The first Norwegian @-@ built tram was delivered on 16 February 1983 and put into service on 9 March . The last unit was put into service on 10 January 1984 . The Strømmen trams were numbered 111 through 125 . There were few problems in the start , although the pantographs had technical problems and there were occasional power failures in the overhead wires due to out @-@ of @-@ date rectifiers not being able to handle the increase power usage . Trams no . 101 through 113 were put into service on Line 9 on the Lilleaker Line and the Ekeberg Line , replacing the Class E. The remaining trams of the first series were put into service on Line 1 , on the Sinsen Line and the Briskeby Line , as well as Line 7 , on the Ullevål Hageby Line and the Sinsen Line . On Line 9 , that included both the tramway 's light rail sections , only SL79 @-@ trams were used , while lines 1 and 7 used a mix of SL79 and SM53 @-@ trams . 
 Fifteen additional trams were built by Strømmen as series two . The first vehicle was delivered on 4 August 1989 and was taken into service on 11 October , while the last was put into service on 27 August 1990 . These were numbered 126 through 140 . From 7 September 1990 to 1 February 1991 , tram 140 was used on the tramway in Chemnitz , Germany . Following this delivery , all lines of the tramway used SL79 , although there were still many other trams needed to supplement the new trams . During the summer of 1995 , tram no . 137 was used on the Djurgården Line of the heritage tramway in Stockholm , Sweden . Due to a labor dispute about privatizing the operation of the tramway and the Oslo Metro , the ownership of all trams and metro trains , including the SL95 , were transferred to the municipally owned limited company Oslo Vognselskap in 2007 . 
 Suggestions have been made to extend the trams with another center section , adding another axle and articulation , but these plans have been rejected by the company . Such a center section would be low @-@ floor and give much easier access for strollers and wheelchairs , and allow the whole tram network to have step @-@ free access . As of 2008 , it was estimated that the SL79 @-@ series has about ten more years of service before it needs to be replaced . No plans have been made for new trams to be ordered . 
 = = Operations = = 
 The SL79 make up 40 of the 72 trams in the system , supplementing the newer SL95 . Following the delivery of the SL95 low @-@ floor trams in 1999 and 2000 , Oslo Sporveier has a pure articulated fleet . The newer series has a greater turning radius , heavier axle load and is two @-@ directional . The radius and axle load of the SL95 makes it impossible for it to operate around Majorstuen , requiring lines 11 , 12 and 19 to use SL79 @-@ units . With the 1999 @-@ extension of the Ullevål Hageby Line to Rikshospitalet , the tramway received its first terminus without a balloon loop , making it necessary for lines 17 and 18 to be served only by SL95 units . These also serve line 13 , since it is a continuation of the service along the Sinsen Line from Majorstuen . The SL79 operate on the Briskeby , Ekeberg , Frogner , Gamleby , Grünerløkka – Torshov , Kjelsås and Vika Lines . Each service has a ten @-@ minute headway , giving a five @-@ minute interval on section that are served by two lines .

 The SL79 is an articulated tram built exclusively for the Oslo Tramway in two series with different specifications . The trams were designed by Duewag , who also built 10 units in Düsseldorf , Germany . Fifteen additional units plus the fifteen trams in the second series were built Strømmen outside Oslo . The motors for the first series was delivered by Duewag , while the second series was built by Asea Brown Boveri at their Norwegian subsidiary NEBB . The trams have a steel frame and are 22 @,@ 180 millimeters ( 873 in ) long and 2 @,@ 500 millimeters ( 98 in ) wide . Without payload the trams weigh 32 @,@ 800 kilograms ( 72 @,@ 300 lb ) . 
 Each tram has a total capacity of 162 riders , of which 71 can be seated . Seating is at three or four abreast . Series two was delivered with vandal @-@ proof seats that proved uncomfortable and were replaced . The floor is 880 millimeters ( 35 in ) above the tracks . The trams have four doors on the right side . The first series also have a single door on the left side , and the back right door was made single to match this . On series two , there are four double doors on the right side and none on the left side . SL79 was the first tram to be delivered with color @-@ coded destination signs . By 2007 , all the trams had had their rolling signs replaced by LED @-@ type signs . 
 The trams have three standard gauge bogies , each with two axles , of which the front and back bogies are powered . The bogies have air suspension and hollow @-@ axle gear boxes from Thyssen . The wheels have a diameter of 680 millimeters ( 27 in ) . The distance between the bogies is 7 @,@ 700 millimeters ( 300 in ) . Each of the two NEBB <unk> 2054 B thyristor <unk> have a power output of 217 kilowatts ( 291 hp ) , giving the vehicle a power output of 434 kilowatts ( 582 hp ) at 750 V. Maximum speed is 80 km / h ( 50 mph ) . Acceleration in the range 0 to 40 km / h ( 0 to 25 mph ) is limited to 1 @.@ 3 meters per second squared ( 4 @.@ 3 ft / s2 ) . Primary braking is achieved from the dynamic brake , that is capable of 1 @.@ 3 m / s2 ( 4 @.@ 3 ft / s2 ) retardation with regeneration , allowing the braking power to be fed back to the overhead wires . In addition , there are disc brakes capable of 3 @.@ 0 m / s2 ( 9 @.@ 8 ft / s2 ) . 
 Except those with an advertising livery , the trams are painted a light blue . The first series was delivered with a deeper blue color than has been tradition with Oslo Sporveier trams , but all have since been repainted to match the standard livery . Prior to the delivery of the second series , a single tram was painted deep red to match the buses and the T1000 trains used on the Oslo Metro . Due to negative feedback from the riders , the historic color was kept .

Torres then claimed that the song was " the type of track that 's capable of filling dancefloors in seconds , proof that a cavalcade of controversy isn 't nearly enough to squander real talent " .

 = HMS Aboukir ( 1900 ) = 
 HMS Aboukir was a Cressy @-@ class armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy around 1900 . Upon completion she was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet and spent most of her career there . Upon returning home in 1912 , she was placed in reserve . Recommissioned at the start of the First World War , she played a minor role in the Battle of Heligoland Bight a few weeks after the beginning of the war . Aboukir was sunk by the German submarine U @-@ 9 , together with two of her sister ships , on 22 September 1914 ; 527 men of her complement died . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Aboukir was designed to displace 12 @,@ 000 long tons ( 12 @,@ 000 t ) . The ship had an overall length of 472 feet ( 143 @.@ 9 m ) , a beam of 69 feet 9 inches ( 21 @.@ 3 m ) and a deep draught of 26 feet 9 inches ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) . She was powered by two 4 @-@ cylinder triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one shaft , which produced a total of 21 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 16 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) . The engines were powered by 30 Belleville boilers . On their sea trials all of the Cressy @-@ class cruisers , except the lead ship , exceeded their designed speed . She carried a maximum of 1 @,@ 600 long tons ( 1 @,@ 600 t ) of coal and her complement ranged from 725 to 760 officers and enlisted men . 
 Her main armament consisted of two breech @-@ loading ( BL ) 9 @.@ 2 @-@ inch ( 234 mm ) Mk X guns in single gun turrets , one each fore and aft of the superstructure . They fired 380 @-@ pound ( 170 kg ) shells to a range of 15 @,@ 500 yards ( 14 @,@ 200 m ) . Her secondary armament of twelve BL 6 @-@ inch Mk VII guns was arranged in casemates amidships . Eight of these were mounted on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather . They had a maximum range of approximately 12 @,@ 200 yards ( 11 @,@ 200 m ) with their 100 @-@ pound ( 45 kg ) shells . A dozen quick @-@ firing ( QF ) 12 @-@ pounder 12 cwt guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats , eight on casemates on the upper deck and four in the superstructure . The ship also carried three 3 @-@ pounder Hotchkiss guns and two submerged 18 @-@ inch torpedo tubes . 
 The ship 's waterline armour belt ranged in thickness from 2 to 6 inches ( 51 to 152 mm ) and was closed off by 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) transverse bulkheads . The armour of the gun turrets and their barbettes was 6 inches thick while the casemate armour was 5 inches thick . The protective deck armour ranged in thickness from 1 – 3 inches ( 25 – 76 mm ) and the conning tower was protected by 12 inches ( 305 mm ) of armour . 
 = = Construction and service = = 
 Aboukir was laid down by Fairfield Shipbuilding & Engineering at their shipyard in Govan , Scotland on 9 November 1898 and launched on 16 May 1900 . In March 1901 she arrived at Portsmouth Dockyard for fitting out . She was completed early the following year , and commissioned on 3 April 1902 by Captain Charles John Graves @-@ <unk> . The ship was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning , and left Portsmouth in early May , arriving at Malta later that month . She made two deployments to the Mediterranean , 1902 – 05 and 1907 – 12 . She was reduced to reserve when she returned home in 1912 and was assigned to the 7th Cruiser Squadron shortly after the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 . 
 The squadron was tasked with patrolling the Broad Fourteens of the North Sea in support of a force of destroyers and submarines based at Harwich which protected the eastern end of the English Channel from German warships attempting to attack the supply route between England and France . During the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August , the ship was part of Cruiser Force ' C ' , in reserve off the Dutch coast , and saw no action . 
 = = = Fate = = = 
 On the morning of 22 September , Aboukir and her sisters , Cressy and Hogue , were on patrol without any escorting destroyers as they had been forced to seek shelter from bad weather . The three sisters in line abreast , about 2 @,@ 000 yards ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) apart , at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . They were not expecting submarine attack , but they had lookouts posted and had one gun manned on each side to attack any submarines sighted . The weather had moderated earlier that morning and Tyrwhitt was en route to reinforce the cruisers with eight destroyers . 
 U @-@ 9 , commanded by Kapitänleutnant Otto Weddigen , had been ordered to attack British transports at Ostend , but had been forced to dive and take shelter from the storm . On surfacing , she spotted the British ships and moved to attack . She fired one torpedo at 06 : 20 at Aboukir that struck her on the starboard side ; Captain John Drummond thought he had struck a mine and ordered the other two ships to close to transfer his wounded men . Aboukir quickly began listing and capsized around 06 : 55 despite counterflooding compartments on the opposite side to right her . By the time that Drummond ordered " abandon ship " only one boat was available because the others had either been smashed or could not be lowered as no steam was available to power the winches for the boats . 
 As Hogue approached her sinking sister , the ship 's captain , Wilmot Nicholson , realized that it had been a submarine attack and signalled Cressy to look for a periscope although his ship continued to close on Aboukir as her crew threw overboard anything that would float to aid the survivors in the water . Having stopped and lowered all her boats , Hogue was struck by two torpedoes around 06 : 55 . The sudden weight loss of the two torpedoes caused U @-@ 9 to broach the surface and Hogue 's gunners opened fire without effect before the submarine could submerge again . The cruiser capsized about ten minutes after being torpedoed as all of her watertight doors had been open , and she sank at 07 : 15 . 
 Cressy attempted to ram the submarine , but did not hit anything and resumed her rescue efforts until she too was torpedoed at 07 : 20 . She too took on a heavy list and then capsized , before sinking at 07 : 55 . Several Dutch ships began rescuing survivors at 08 : 30 and were joined by British fishing trawlers before Tyrwhitt and his ships arrived at 10 : 45 . The combined total from all three ships was 837 men rescued and 62 officers and 1 @,@ 397 enlisted men lost . Of these , Aboukir lost a total of 527 men . 
 In 1954 the British government sold the salvage rights to all three ships to a German company and they were subsequently sold again to a Dutch company which began salvaging the wrecks ' metal in 2011 . 
 = Angry Birds ( video game ) = 
 Angry Birds is a puzzle video game developed by Finnish computer game developer Rovio Mobile that started the Angry Birds franchise . Inspired primarily by a sketch of stylized wingless birds , the game was first released for iOS and <unk> in December 2009 . Since that time , over 12 million copies of the game have been purchased from the iOS App Store , which has prompted the company to design versions for other touchscreen @-@ based smartphones , most notably those using the Android , Symbian , Windows Phone and BlackBerry 10 operating systems . The series has since expanded to include titles for dedicated video game consoles and for PCs . A sequel named Angry Birds 2 was released on July 30 , 2015 @,@ 
 In the game , players use a slingshot to launch birds at pigs stationed in or around various structures with the goal of destroying all the pigs on the playing field . As players advance through the game new types of birds become available , some with special abilities that can be activated by the player . Rovio Mobile has supported Angry Birds with numerous free updates that add additional game content , and the company has also released stand @-@ alone holiday and promotional versions of the game . 
 Angry Birds has been praised for its success for leveraging a combination of addictive gameplay , comical style , and low price into a viable franchise with long @-@ term potential for profit . The game 's popularity has led to the production of additional versions of Angry Birds for personal computers and gaming consoles , as well as a market for merchandise featuring its characters and even long @-@ term plans for a feature film or television series . With a combined tally of over 2 billion downloads across all platforms as of January 2014 , including both regular and special editions of the software , the game has been called " one of the most mainstream games out right now " , " one of the great runaway hits of 2010 " , and " the largest mobile app success the world has seen so far " . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 In Angry Birds , the player controls a flock of multi @-@ colored birds that are attempting to retrieve their eggs , which have been stolen by a group of hungry green pigs . In each stage of the gameplay , enemy pigs are sheltered by structures made of various materials such as wood , glass , and stone resembling children 's toy building blocks . The objective of the game is to eliminate all the pigs on the level . Using a slingshot , players launch a limited set of birds with the goal of either striking the enemy pigs directly or damaging their surrounding structures , causing the blocks to collapse and squash the pigs . The player must set the angle and force of the bird 's travel by pulling back on the slingshot ( using intuitive touch @-@ controls in the mobile versions ) . The launch process is quick and casual , with no visible trajectory data , and a player simply selects a point in the X @-@ Y field behind the launch post from which the virtual slingshot will be released . In various stages of the game , additional objects such as TNT crates and rocks are incorporated into the structures , and power @-@ ups may be used to enhance the birds to attack hard @-@ to @-@ reach pigs . 
 There are several different types of birds used in the game , distinguished by their color and shape . In the earliest levels only the basic red bird is available . As the player advances through the game additional types of birds become available . Some birds are effective against particular materials , and some have special abilities that may be activated by the player while the bird is airborne . For example , a yellow bird speeds up , a blue bird fragments into three birds , a black bird explodes , a white bird can drop an egg @-@ shaped projectile , a pink bird can trap objects in bubbles , a green bird boomerangs back and an orange bird expands and inflates . The pigs also vary , with hardiness relative to their size . Small pigs are weaker and are easily vanquished by direct hits or by debris from the damaged structures , while larger pigs are able to withstand more damage before succumbing to defeat . In addition , some pigs wear hats or armor , making them even more resistant to damage . 
 Each level starts with the quantity , types , and firing order of birds predetermined . If all of the pigs are eliminated after the last bird is launched , the level is completed and the next level is unlocked . If all of the birds run out and the pigs are not killed , the level is incomplete and must be repeated . Points are scored for each pig killed as well as for damage to , or destruction of , structures , and hefty bonus points are awarded for any unused birds . Upon completing each level , players receive one , two , or three stars depending on the score received . Players may re @-@ attempt unlocked levels as many times as they wish in order to complete them successfully or to earn additional points to get more stars . 
 = = Development = = 
 In early 2009 , Rovio staff began reviewing proposals for potential games . One such proposal came from senior game designer Jaakko <unk> in the form of a simulated screenshot featuring some angry @-@ looking birds with no visible legs or wings . While the picture gave no clue as to what type of game was being played , the staff liked the characters , and the team elected to design a game around them . In early 2009 , physics games , such as Crush the Castle , were popular flash @-@ based web games , so the Rovio team was inspired by these games . During the development of Angry Birds , the staff realized the birds needed an enemy . At the time , the " swine flu " epidemic was in the news , so the staff made the birds ' enemies pigs . Angry Birds was the studio 's 52nd produced game and on its initial release , the game didn 't sell many copies . After Angry Birds was a featured app on the UK App Store in February 2010 and quickly reached No.1 there , it reached the No. 1 spot on the paid apps chart in the US App Store in the middle of 2010 and then stayed there for 275 days . The initial cost to develop Angry Birds was estimated to exceed € 100 @,@ 000 , not including costs for the subsequent updates . For the iOS version , Rovio partnered with distributor <unk> to publish the game to the App Store . <unk> claimed to have participated in final game polishing , such as adding visible trajectory lines , pinch to zoom , pigs ' grunts , birds ' somersaults on landing . Since then Rovio has self @-@ published almost all of the later ports of the game , with the exception of the PSP version , which was produced under license by Abstraction Games . 
 When Rovio began writing new versions of the game for other devices , new issues came to light . As the team began working on a version for Android systems , they observed the large number of configurations of device types and versions of the Android software . The number of combinations of software version , processor speed and even user interfaces was significantly larger than that for the iOS version . Ultimately , the team settled on a minimum set of requirements , even though that left nearly 30 types of Android phones unable to run the game , including some newly released phones . It was released on October 15 , 2010 . One month after the initial release on Android , Rovio Mobile began designing a lite version of the game for these other devices . 
 In early 2010 , Rovio began developing a version of Angry Birds for Facebook . The project became one of the company 's largest , with development taking over a year . The company understood the challenges of transplanting a game concept between social platforms and mobile / gaming systems . In a March 2011 interview , Rovio 's Peter <unk> said , " you can ’ t take an experience that works in one environment and one ecosystem and force @-@ feed it onto another . It 's like Zynga . They can ’ t just take FarmVille and throw it on mobile and see what sticks . The titles that have been successful for them on mobile are the ones they ’ ve built from the ground up for the platform . " The Facebook version incorporate social @-@ gaming concepts and in @-@ game purchases and entered beta @-@ testing in April 2011 ; the game became officially available on Facebook in February 2012 . 
 Improvements for the game include the ability to synchronize the player 's progress across multiple devices ; for example , a player who completes a level on an Android phone can log into their copy of the game on an Android tablet and see the same statistics and level of progress . 
 = = Release = = 
 The initial iOS version of the game included a single episode entitled " Poached Eggs " , which contained three themed chapters , each with 21 levels . From time to time , Rovio has released free upgrades that include additional content , such as new levels , new in @-@ game objects and even new birds . As updates have been released , they have been incorporated into the game 's full version offered for download from each platform 's application store . 
 The first update released on February 11 , 2010 added a new episode called " Mighty Hoax " , containing two new chapters with 21 levels each . Updates released on April 6 , 2010 added the " Golden Eggs " feature , which placed hidden golden eggs throughout the game that would unlock bonus content when found , and a new episode called " Danger Above " , which initially contained a single chapter of 15 levels . Two later updates added two more chapters to " Danger Above " , each with 15 levels . " The Big Setup " episode , released on July 18 , 2010 , added a new chapter with 15 levels and additional Golden Egg levels . " The Big Setup " was later given two more chapters of 15 levels each . 
 A fifth episode , called " Ham ' Em High " , launched on December 23 , 2010 , in celebration of the game 's first year in the iOS App Store . " Ham ' Em High " contained 15 American Old West @-@ themed levels in a single chapter ; updates on February 4 , 2011 and March 18 , 2011 each added one new 15 @-@ level chapter . " Ham ' Em High " also introduced the Mighty Eagle , a new bird that may be used once per hour to clear any uncompleted levels . The Mighty Eagle can also be used in previously completed levels , without the once @-@ per @-@ hour limit , to play a mini @-@ game called " Total Destruction " in which the player attempts to destroy as much of the scenery as possible , both with the standard birds and the Mighty Eagle ; achieving 100 % destruction earns the player a Mighty Eagle feather for the level . 
 The Mighty Eagle is offered as a one @-@ time , in @-@ game purchase , and was initially only available for iOS , as its App Store customers have iTunes accounts with pre @-@ linked credit cards . In late 2011 , Rovio also added the Mighty Eagle to the Chrome App version of the game . Rovio has begun testing an Android update called the " Bad Piggy Bank " with the Elisa wireless service in Finland and T @-@ Mobile , which allows users to charge in @-@ app purchases , such as the Mighty Eagle , to their mobile phone bills . The service went live on Android with the release of version 2 @.@ 2 @.@ 0 in August 2012 , using Google Play 's transaction system , which allows both mobile billing and credit cards , allowing both Android phones and WiFi @-@ only tablets to unlock the features . This version also added the powerups from the Facebook version and added an option to pay to remove ads , allowing Android players to enjoy the game ad @-@ free as iOS players do . 
 The sixth episode , " Mine and Dine " , was released on June 16 , 2011 with 15 new mining @-@ themed levels and a new Golden Egg . An August 24 , 2011 update expanded " Mine and Dine " with two more 15 @-@ level chapters . 
 The seventh update , " Birdday Party " , was released on December 11 , 2011 to commemorate the second anniversary of the first release of the iOS version into the iTunes App Store . It included 15 new birthday cake @-@ theme levels , as well as updated graphics and the addition of elements from the spin @-@ off games , such as the scoring graphic seen in Angry Birds Rio and the introduction of the orange bird that first appeared in Angry Birds Seasons . The update was later released for Android and Microsoft Windows . The eighth update was released initially to iOS on March 20 , 2012 in a lead @-@ up to the release of Angry Birds Space . The new update included an animated tutorial , enhanced gameplay , all new UI graphics , and the first 15 levels of " Surf and Turf , " the Angry Birds Facebook @-@ exclusive episode ( see below ) ; another 15 levels were added later , with the iOS version receiving the power @-@ ups first seen in the Facebook version . 
 On October 9 , 2012 , the final chapter of " Surf and Turf " was released . Along with that , a new episode called " Bad Piggies " was released . This is to advertise the new Rovio game , Bad Piggies . Another update was released on December 11 , 2012 , the 3rd anniversary of the game 's release , with 15 new levels to " Birdday Party " and 15 new levels to " Bad Piggies " . The second set of 15 levels in " Birdday Party " introduced the Pink Bird to the game . 15 more levels were later released for the " Bad Piggies " episode on March 7 , 2013 . On the same day these final 15 levels were released , Angry Birds became " Free App of the Week " on the Apple App Store until March 14 , and became an instant hit on the Top Free App charts on the App Store until March 18 , when the app returned to the normal price of $ 0 @.@ 99 . 
 On June 17 , 2013 , Rovio teased on its Facebook page that Red , the main protagonist of the game , would receive an ability in a new episode . On June 26 , Rovio released a YouTube video , uncovering three new facts : the episode would be called Red 's Mighty Feathers , the update would come in July , and the Angry Birds app icon would receive a new design . On July 3 , 2013 , the update was released , with fifteen levels of all @-@ new gameplay . Instead of knocking over the pigs ' castles , your goal is to keep the pigs from stealing the egg and leaving the playing field with it . The pigs arrive in waves of complicated vehicles , and the only available bird is Red , whose new ability is to target the nearest pig . There is no score , and the three stars are awarded by completing three objectives in one try . The first objective is to finish the level without getting your egg stolen . The second is to pop all the pigs in the level . The third is to use fewer than or equal to a certain amount of birds to clear the level . Because some people were skeptical about the new gameplay , Rovio later announced that they would add levels to the episode based on the original level style . On September 16 , 2013 , Rovio added 15 levels to the episode using the original style and these levels include manual targeting for Red Bird . 
 On November 26 , 2013 , Rovio added a 30 @-@ level episode called Short Fuse that transforms the Bomb 's explosions into highly @-@ destructive electrical pulses , adds a <unk> that transforms any Bird into a Bomb Bird and 3 different potions that can change the pigs . On December 11 , 2013 , Rovio added 15 levels to episode Birdday Party ( cake 4 ) to celebrate its fourth birthday . On March 4 , 2014 , 15 levels were added to Short Fuse and the power @-@ up icons were updated . On July 22 , 2014 , a 15 @-@ level episode called " Flock Favorites " that is inspired by fans ' favorite episodes ( Poached Eggs , Danger Above , Mine and Dine , Bad Piggies , Red 's Mighty Feathers , Short Fuse , Surf and Turf ) was added . 
 On November 23 , 2014 , in partnership with ( RED ) and Apple Inc . , an update to the app were was exclusive to iOS . In this update , there was added special ( RED ) -themed Golden Egg level and Red 's power from the Red 's Mighty Feathers episode as an stand alone power @-@ up , that when purchased , can be used forever ( 1 use per level ) and 100 % of the money went to the Global Fund to end AIDS . This purchase was only available until December 7 . 
 On December 11 , 2014 , in honor of the Angry Birds ' 5th birthday , an episode with 30 user @-@ inspired levels was added . On June 23 , 2015 , Flock Favorites was added with 15 levels inspired by previous episodes . On December 11 , 2015 , in honor of Angry Birds 6th birthday , new 15 levels were added to Birdday Party .

 Since its initial release for the Nokia <unk> multimedia Internet device , and Apple 's iPhone and iPod Touch mobile digital devices , Rovio has released versions of Angry Birds for additional devices . An iPad @-@ exclusive version , Angry Birds HD , released with the iPad mobile digital device in April 2010 . In August 2010 , Angry Birds was made available to the Palm Pre phone running Palm 's <unk> operating system through its App Catalog online store . Symbian ^ 3 phones received a version of the game in October 2010 , which initially includes only the " Poached Eggs " and " Mighty Hoax " episodes . Angry Birds works on Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD . 
 In May 2010 , Rovio announced plans for a version for devices using Google 's Android operating system , with a beta version being released through the Android Market ( now Google Play ) in September 2010 . The full Android version of the game was first released instead on GetJar in October 2010 , though it was subsequently released on Android Market within days . Rovio officials noted that GetJar had a more global reach than Android Market , and GetJar 's availability on other smartphone platforms ( including Symbian ) would make cross @-@ platform promotion of the game easier . Unlike the previous versions , Angry Birds for Android is a free , ad @-@ supported application , as paid applications aren 't available on Android in some nations . An update called " Bad Piggy Bank " enabled players to buy out the in @-@ game ads . 
 In October 2010 , Microsoft suggested on one of its websites that a Windows Phone version of Angry Birds was in development . Rovio complained that Microsoft had not asked permission to make such a statement , noting that at that time it had not committed to design a Windows Phone version . Although Rovio asked Microsoft to revise its site to remove references to the game , a Windows Phone version was ultimately released in June 2011 . 
 Near the end of 2010 , Rovio stated that it was developing new ports of the game , this time for devices outside of the mobile phone market . In January 2011 , three of those ports launched . First , Sony announced the release of Angry Birds for its PlayStation Portable handheld system in the form of a PlayStation mini game that includes nearly 200 levels from the original game ; the version is also playable on the PlayStation 3 . Next , Rovio announced the release of a Windows version of the game on January 4 , 2011 , available for sale exclusively from the Intel <unk> center , which included 195 levels at launch and plans for exclusive features not available on the smartphone versions . One day after the Windows version was released , the Mac App Store launched , with one of the first offerings being its own version of Angry Birds . Ports of Angry Birds have also been proposed for the Wii and Nintendo DS systems , and a 3D @-@ enhanced version of the game was proposed for release on the LG Optimus 3D in October 2011 . 
 The popularity of Angry Birds has helped spread the game to other devices that were not initially designed as gaming machines . Barnes & Noble announced that a future update for its Nook Color e @-@ reader will let the Android @-@ based device run applications , including a port of Angry Birds . In June 2011 , Rovio announced plans to partner with Roku to include a version of Angry Birds on a new model of its Internet @-@ connected set @-@ top box , the Roku 2 XS . 
 In May 2011 , an in @-@ browser HTML5 version of Angry Birds was released in beta form . The game uses <unk> or Canvas and is distributed through the Chrome Web Store for use with Google 's Chrome web browser . It runs on any <unk> or Canvas @-@ enabled browser , and features exclusive content when played on Chrome , such as exclusive levels and the so @-@ called " Chrome Bombs " . The version includes offline playability and features 60 FPS gameplay with a selection of graphics settings to accommodate a variety of hardware capabilities . 
 In October 2011 , during Nokia World 2011 , it was announced that Angry Birds would come preloaded in Nokia 's Asha series of Series 40 touch handsets , aimed at emerging markets such as India , China and South Africa . In December 2011 , Rovio released Angry Birds HD , Angry Birds Seasons HD and Angry Birds Rio HD on the BlackBerry <unk> tablet from Research In Motion . In January 2012 , Angry Birds was released for devices using Bada OS . 
 In February 2012 , Angry Birds made its official debut on Facebook . It is known as Angry Birds Friends since May 23 , 2012 . The version launched with two chapters from the original game , along with then exclusive " Surf and Turf " chapter . The Facebook version adds a number of new power @-@ up items , with a maximum of two in use per level . For example , the Super Seeds power @-@ up will make the launched bird larger and thus more powerful , while the King Sling power @-@ up makes the slingshot stronger and able to launch birds higher and faster . Power @-@ ups can be purchased in @-@ game or given by friends who also play the game . " Surf and Turf " would later be included in the original mobile versions of the game , starting with iOS . The Facebook version features weekly tournaments among your friends , with the top 3 winners earning free in @-@ game " Bird Coins " which can be used to purchase power @-@ ups . There was a unique Green Day themed chapter , however it was removed in December 2012 . 
 At the 2012 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles , California , Rovio and distribution partner Activision announced plans to bring Angry Birds and two of its spin @-@ off games , Angry Birds Seasons and Angry Birds Rio to the PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 and Nintendo 3DS systems . Bundled together as Angry Birds Trilogy , the games will be built specifically for their respective consoles , taking advantage of their unique features , such as support for PlayStation Move , Kinect , high @-@ definition displays and glasses @-@ free 3D visuals . 
 It is also available for Nintendo 3DS , Wii and Wii U as part of Angry Birds Trilogy . 
 A motion controlled version of the game has also been released as a Samsung Smart TV App .

 Reviews for Angry Birds have been mostly positive . Chris Holt of Macworld called the game " an addictive , clever , and challenging puzzler " , and Pocket Gamer 's Keith Andrew said Angry Birds is " a nugget of puzzling purity dished out with relish aplenty " . Jonathan Liu of Wired News wrote that " going for the maximum number of stars certainly adds a lot of replay value to a fairly extensive game " . 
 Reviews for the first versions of the game that did not use a touch @-@ screen , the PlayStation 3 / PSP version and the Windows version , have also been positive , but with some disagreement over the different interfaces . Will Greenwald of PC Magazine , in his review of the PlayStation Network version , said that the control scheme on these platforms is good , " but they 're not nearly as satisfying as the touch @-@ screen controls found on smartphone versions " , and that the PlayStation 3 version appeared " blocky and unpleasant , like a smartphone screen blown up to HDTV size " . Conversely , Greg Miller of IGN preferred the analog control setup of the PSP version , saying it " offered me tiny variances in control that I don 't feel like I get with my fat finger on a screen " . While giving the game a positive review , Miller concluded , " There 's no denying that Angry Birds is fun , but it could use polish – such as sharper visuals , a better price and smoother action . " Damien McFerrin of British website Electric Pig reviewed the PC version , saying " the mouse @-@ driven control method showcases many distinct advantages over its finger @-@ focused counterpart " . 
 Angry Birds has also been described critically as impossible to understand the playing rules criteria by game critic Chris Schiller of Eurogamer.net , which has ' a contemptuous attitude towards its players , keeping them just frustrated enough not to switch off and play something else <unk> 
 Angry Birds became the top @-@ selling paid application on Apple 's UK App Store in February 2010 , and reached the top spot on the US App Store a few weeks later , where it remained until October 2010 . Since release , the free , limited version of Angry Birds has been downloaded more than 11 million times for Apple 's iOS , and the full @-@ featured paid version has been downloaded nearly 7 million times as of September 2010 . The Android version of the game was downloaded more than 1 million times within the first 24 hours of release , even though the site crashed at one point due to the load , and over 2 million downloads in its first weekend . Rovio receives approximately US $ 1 million per month in revenue from the advertising that appears in the free Android version . 
 According to Rovio , players log more than 5 million hours of game time each day across all platforms , along with 200 million monthly active users . In November 2010 , Digital Trends stated that " with 36 million downloads , Angry Birds is one of the most mainstream games out right now " . MSNBC 's video game news blog has written that " [ n ] o other game app comes close " to having such a following .

 = Edward Cronjager = 
 Edward Cronjager ( March 21 , 1904 – June 15 , 1960 ) was an American cinematographer , whose career spanned from the silent era through the 1950s . He came from a family of cinematographers , with his uncles , Henry Cronjager Sr. , Jules and brother , Henry Jr . , all working in the film industry behind the camera . His work covered over 100 films , and included projects on the small screen towards the end of his career . He filmed in both black and white and color mediums , and his work received nominations for seven Academy Awards over the span of three decades , although he never won the statue . 
 He was the preferred director of photography of early film star Richard Dix , and served on several Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ( AMPAS ) committees , as well as being selected by the American Society of Cinematographers ( ASC ) to test new types of film stock . Cronjager pioneered several new techniques and types of cinematography , developing new camera angles in the 1920s , working on one of the earliest film noirs in the 1940s , and using <unk> in underwater photography in the 1950s . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Cronjager was born into a film family in New York City in 1904 . His uncle , Henry and Jules ( respectively ) , were famous cinematographers during the first two decades of the twentieth century . They worked with companies such as Edison , Biograph and Fox Film Corporation . Edward 's brother , Henry Jr . , was also a famous cinematographer , although his filmography is sometimes confused with that of his uncle , Henry Sr. , due to the similarity of names and the fact that the active years of their careers overlapped . Before following in his uncle 's footsteps , Cronjager would work as an assistant machinist .

 = = = The silent film years = = = 
 One of Cronjager 's first efforts behind the lens was at the age of 19 , filming the heavyweight championship bout between Jack Dempsey and Luis Ángel Firpo in 1923 . He began his career in the film industry in 1925 with the Famous Players @-@ Lasky film corporation ( later Paramount Pictures ) , where he remained until 1930 . His first project was the silent film , <unk> , starring Richard Dix , which would be shot at Lasky 's Long Island , New York studio , where Cronjager worked until being transferred to Lasky 's west coast operation in 1927 . The Film Daily called his work on the picture " very good " . During the next four years he photographed fifteen silent films , of which twelve starred Dix , and he shot almost every one of the twenty @-@ nine pictures Dix made between 1927 and 1933 . In addition , in 1927 Cronjager joined the American Society of Cinematographers ( ASC ) . 
 By the end of 1928 he was credited with developing several new camera angles . Cronjager was lauded by industry magazines such as Variety for his inventive camera work in 1928 's Warming Up , which added realism to the efforts of Dix as a baseball pitcher . In September 1928 Cronjager became involved in a minor controversy . The film industry was becoming unionized , and Cronjager was resistant to joining . When Dix insisted Cronjager photograph his next film , Moran of the Marines , the union threatened to strike if the cinematographer was hired without becoming a union member . Cronjager joined the union at the request of the studio , averting the threatened union action . Throughout his career , Dix attempted to have Cronjager as the cinematographer on his films . 
 = = = The sound era and RKO years = = = 
 His first sound film , 1929 's Nothing But the Truth , also starred Dix , and was directed by Victor Schertzinger . His next film in 1929 , again directed by Schertzinger and starring Dix , was Redskin . Filmed in two @-@ strip technicolor , the film has been part of modern exhibitions about early color cinematography . At one such exhibition in 2015 , at the Museum of Modern Art in New York , it was described as " the film ’ s true star is the extraordinary location photography in Arizona 's Canyon de Chelly and New Mexico 's Valley of the Enchanted Mesa . " Kevin Brownlow , a British film historian , noted : 
 The color in the original print is breathtaking ; Redskin leaves an impression of a kaleidoscope of awe @-@ inspiring backgrounds , with such much happening in the foreground that one hardly has time to take in the whole frame . The color is used for emotional impact ; black and white ( toned amber ) represents the world of the white man ; color is reserved for scenes of Indian life . 
 In 1930 both Cronjager and Dix moved from Paramount Pictures to RKO Radio Pictures . The following year , 1931 , he received his first Academy Award nomination , for Cimarron . During production , Cronjager utilized up to 27 cameras at once , especially during the land rush scenes . In addition , he used over two million feet of film during the production , 250 @,@ 000 of them during the land rush scenes alone ; he communicated with his cameramen through army surplus field telephones . The film was nominated for seven Oscars , winning three ( Outstanding Production , Best Screenplay Adaptation , and Best Art Direction ) . Cronjager lost to Floyd Crosby 's work on Tabu . 
 When a new type of film allowing the photographing of faster moving action was introduced in 1931 , Cronjager was one of the cinematographers who participated in the ASC 's field testing of the product . In 1932 Cronjager worked with two other well @-@ known cinematographers , Lucien <unk> and Clyde De <unk> , on King Vidor 's film , Bird of Paradise . The individual results of the three photographers was very high quality , but the integration of their work , all with very different styles , proved less than desirable to critics . Cronjager worked with Dix again in 1933 , on the film The Lost Squadron , which also starred Mary Astor , and was directed by George <unk> . 
 In 1934 he photographed the film Kentucky Kernels , starring the comedy team of Wheeler & Woolsey . More importantly , Edward got to work with his father , Henry Sr. , on the final film of Henry 's career . 1936 saw his tenure at RKO come to an end , when he decided to turn down a new contract and enter the freelance arena ; he shot films at both RKO and Paramount during the remainder of the year . The year also saw Cronjager 's selection to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ( AMPAS ) nominating rules committee for the cinematography Oscar . 
 = = = Tenure at Fox , and his later years = = = 
 In 1937 Cronjager moved to the studio with which he would be most associated , 20th Century Fox . One of the first films he shot for Fox was Sonja Henie 's screen debut , One in a Million , a collaboration which would continue over the next decade . He was selected for the AMPAS cinematography committee once more in 1937 , and again for the third year in a row in 1938 . 
 In January 1940 Cronjager was again named to the rules committee of AMPAS , regarding the Oscar for cinematography . The 1940s saw Cronjager receive five Academy Award nominations . The first was for the 1941 film , Sun Valley Serenade , starring Henie . Cronjager 's work was called excellent by several publications , including American Cinematographer , with " one or two sequences so exceptional that it is worth seeing the picture for them alone . " He lost to Arthur Miller 's work on How Green Was My Valley . In 1941 Cronjager shot one of the earliest film noirs , I Wake Up Screaming , starring Betty Grable and Victor Mature , directed by H. Bruce Humberstone . A recent review by Gary Giddins of the The New York Sun , called I Wake Up Screaming " one of the most beautiful black @-@ and @-@ white movies ever made . " 
 The following year Cronjager left Fox , with him again become a freelance cinematographer . Before going freelance , two of the films he shot at Fox garnered Oscar nominations for him in two different categories : To the Shores of Tripoli for color cinematography , and The Pied Piper for best cinematography in the black and white medium . He won neither , losing to Joseph Ruttenberg in the black and white category for Mrs. Miniver , and to Leon Shamroy for the color cinematography in The Black Swan . Cronjager manned the camera for the classic My Friend Flicka in 1943 , starring Roddy McDowall ; but it was his work on Heaven Can Wait which earned him his fifth Oscar nomination , this one for color film photography . D. W. Griffith called Cronjager 's work in Heaven Can Wait " the best color footage ever made " . He would lose to Hal Mohr and W. Howard Greene for Phantom of the Opera . Cronjager received his fifth nomination in four years for his work on 1944 's Home in Indiana , directed by Henry Hathaway , and starring Walter Brennan ; he lost again , this time to Leon Shamroy for his photography of the film Wilson . 
 Cronjager filmed a dozen pictures during the first half of the 1950s , culminating in another Oscar nomination , his seventh and final , for 1954 's Beneath the 12 @-@ Mile Reef , which featured his underwater photography using the " <unk> " , a French underwater camera , the first use of CinemaScope underwater . He lost again , this time to Loyal Griggs for his <unk> on Shane . His color work on the location shooting for the 1953 film , Treasure of the Golden Condor , was lauded as stunning . In the remaining six years of his career , he would work on only five films , the fifth of which would be released after his death . In the late 1950s and 1960 he also worked on several television series , including Sea Hunt and Sam Peckinpah 's The Westerner . 
 = = Personal life and death = = 
 In January 1931 , Cronjager married Ziegfeld showgirl Muriel Finley . The two divorced at the end of 1932 . He was married a second time , in 1935 , to actress Kay Sutton ; their marriage was announced in September 1935 , and their divorce in September 1937 . His third marriage took place in August 1942 , when he wed Yvette Bentley , a young actress who appeared in a total of three films from 1942 to 1944 . 
 In the early 1950s , Cronjager began to fall ill . While he continued to work for the remainder of the decade , the work became sporadic . The final picture he filmed was The Threat . He died on June 15 , 1960 , three months before the release of his last film , The Devil 's Partner , although he had filmed it two years earlier . Cronjager had been injured several weeks prior to his death while on the set of picture , when he had intervened to stop a fight between two stuntmen , although his death was listed as natural causes .

 = Aksumite currency = 
 Aksumite currency was coinage produced and used within the Kingdom of Aksum ( or Axum ) centered in present @-@ day Ethiopia and Eritrea . It was issued and circulated from the reign of King Endubis around AD 270 until it began its decline in the first half of the 7th century . During the succeeding medieval period , Mogadishu currency , minted by the Sultanate of Mogadishu , was the most widely circulated currency in the Horn of Africa . 
 Aksum 's currency served as a vessel of propaganda demonstrating the kingdom 's wealth and promoting the national religion ( first polytheistic and later Oriental Christianity ) . It also facilitated the Red Sea trade on which it thrived . The coinage has also proved invaluable in providing a reliable chronology of Aksumite kings due to the lack of extensive archaeological work in the area . 
 = = Origins = = 
 = = = Pre @-@ coinage period = = = 
 Though the issuing of minted coins didn 't begin until around 270 , metal coins may have been used in Aksum centuries prior to centralized minting . The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea mentions that the Aksumite state imported brass ( Greek : <unk> ) , " which they use [ d ] for ornaments and for cutting as money " , and they imported " a little money ( <unk> ) for [ use by ] foreigners who live there . " It can be inferred , therefore , that early Aksumite kings , located on the international trading waters of the Red Sea , recognized the utility of a standardized currency for facilitating both domestic and international trade . 
 = = = Influences = = = 
 Though Aksumite coins are indigenous in design and creation , some outside influences encouraging the use of coins is undeniable . By the time coins were first minted in Aksum , there was widespread trade with Romans on the Red Sea ; Kushana or Persian influence also cannot be ruled out . Roman , Himyarite , and Kushana coins have all been found in major Aksumite cities , however , only very small quantities have been attested and the circulation of foreign currency seems to have been limited . Though South Arabian kingdoms had also minted coins , they had already gone out of use by the time of certain Aksumite involvement in South Arabia under GDRT , and only very rarely produced electrum or gold denominations ( silver mainly in Saba ' and Himyar , while bronze in Hadhramaut ) , making influence unlikely . The major impetus , however , was not emulation but economical ; the Red Sea and its coasts had always been an international trade area and coins would greatly facilitate trade and wealth in the now " world power . " Despite these influences , the coins were of genuinely indigenous design , and foreign influences were relatively weak and few in number . 
 = = Pre @-@ Christian period = = 
 Aksumite currency were first minted in the later stages of the growth of the empire , when its Golden Age had already begun . The minting of coins began around 270 , beginning with the reign of Endubis . 
 = = Source of materials = = 
 = = = Gold = = = 
 Gold seems to have been acquired from a number of sources . Gold probably came from <unk> ( southern Sudan ) , as well as more nearby Ethiopian sources , though the latter isn 't well documented for the north . A gold trade from the southern areas of Ethiopia such as the medieval province / kingdom of <unk> has been attested from the 6th century ( i.e. from the writings of Cosmas Indicopleustes ) and continued through James Bruce 's day ( 18th century ) . Gold also came from more northerly sources such as <unk> , Beja lands , and what is now Eritrea , though the latter two are less certain . However , a recent gold exploration assay in Eritrea has found significant gold deposits at <unk> <unk> , and deposits are also attested at Zara in central @-@ western Eritrea . 
 = = = Silver and others = = = 
 While local sources of gold are attested during the Aksumite era , silver seems to have been rarer in Aksum . No mention of silver mines in the region exist until the 15th and 16th centuries . Though silver was imported as attested by the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea , given the preponderance of silver coins , it could not have been the only source of silver in Aksum . Furthermore , a significant number of the silver coins contain gold inlays ( presumably to increase the value ) , which would have been unnecessary if silver were so rare that it had to be mainly imported . Silver may have been obtained from the refinement of gold , which sometimes occurs naturally with silver in an alloy called electrum . Copper and bronze do not seem to have existed locally in the Aksumite empire , though they were noted as imports in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea . 
 = = Value = = 
 Though the gold coins were certainly the most valuable issue , followed by the silver one , the exact relationship between the three issues ( gold , silver , and bronze ) is not known . The supply of gold was closely controlled by the Aksumite state , as noted by Cosmas Indicopleustes , and other precious metals were undoubtedly also closely controlled , allowing the Aksumite state to ensure the usage of its currency . 
 The quality of the Aksumite coins were also closely controlled , usually of high purity . For example , the lowest purity of gold recorded thus far for Aphilas is 90 percent . Early issues were often very close to their theoretical weights , and some were even over . ) However , the weight of the coins tended to decrease over time ( though not continuously or uniformly ) . This may have reflected a desire to conform to the Diocletian monetary reform of 301 , when the aureus was decreased from 1 / 60 of a pound to 1 / 72 . Despite decreases in weight , the purity of the gold was largely maintained , even by later kings . The relative abundance of Aksumite coins as well as the many that have yet to be found indicate that Aksum must have had access to large quantities of gold . 
 = = Design = = 
 The coins were often inscribed in Greek , as much of its trade was with the " <unk> Orient . " Later inscriptions made more use of Ge 'ez , the language of the Aksumites , perhaps indicating a decline in its use for more international trade ( i.e. with Rome and India ) . The obverse of the coins would always feature an image of the king ( almost always in profile ) wearing either a crown or helmet / regnal headcloth . The headcloth had some image perhaps representing pleats , rays , or sunburst in the front , as well as the tied end of a cloth or fillet to hold the helmet or headcloth in place . Most coins also included an inscription ( usually in Greek ) meaning " King of Aksum " or King of the Aksumites " ( Basileus <unk> ) . However , many coins were also minted anonymously ( or even posthumously ) , especially during the 5th century . Inscriptions on the coins could include a bisi name ( " man of , " Ge 'ez : bə <unk> <unk> ) or an epithet ( beginning with <unk> , Ge 'ez : <unk> " he who " ) in addition to the king 's personal name . Bisi names were used more often in <unk> with personal names on earlier coins , while the epithets were more common in later years , being the only inscribed name in a few sources . Greek text was used in conjunction with Ge 'ez script inscriptions , but was the only language used on the gold coins , with the exception of the Ge 'ez language coins of <unk> and <unk> . Over time , the Greek used on the coins ( gold , silver and bronze ) deteriorated , indicative of Aksum 's decline . Moreover , beginning with <unk> for bronze coins and <unk> for silver coins , Ge 'ez gradually replaced Greek on the legends . 
 = = = Mottoes = = = 
 Aksumite coins used a number of mottoes throughout the period in which they were minted , beginning in the early 4th century . Around this time , numerous anonymous bronze coins with simply Βασιλεύς ( Basileus , " King " ) on the obverse were minted by either King Ezana or one of his successors . The coins bore the first example of an Aksumite motto on the reverse , " May this please the people " ( Greek : <unk> ) . It was later written in <unk> Ge 'ez as " <unk> ፡ <unk> " <unk> <unk> and under King Kaleb also " <unk> ፡ <unk> " <unk> <unk> , " may this please the city [ country ] . " Similar mottoes were used by other kings . Coins of the early 7th @-@ century Emperor Armah had inscribed on the back " <unk> ፡ <unk> ፡ <unk> " <unk> <unk> <unk> ( vocalization : <unk> ፡ <unk> ፡ <unk> ፡ <unk> la @-@ <unk> <unk> ' <unk> , " Let the people be glad , " lit . " <unk> let there be to the peoples " ) . 
 = = = Endybis = = = 
 Endubis , the first known Aksumite king to mint coins , focused almost entirely on his image on both the obverse and reverse . The images were of his head and upper half of his chest in profile , wearing a regnal headcloth or helmet and abundant jewelry . In addition to inscribing his regnal name , Endybis also noted his " bisi name , a practice continued by his early successors , but often missing in later coins . The bisi name was a sort of tribal affiliation or " <unk> " ( i.e. a reference to the king 's lineage ) that was different for every king . Endybis also emphasized his religion through the pre @-@ Christian symbol of the disk and crescent as a propaganda method ( a purpose which the coins already served ) . A second motif used by <unk> and continued by following coins was that of two ( though sometimes one in later years ) ears of barley or wheat around the image of his head in profile . Though no inscriptional evidence exists , given its prominent position around the image of the king , the two ears of barley ( or wheat ) may have been representative symbols of the Aksumite state . Though later coins would be smaller , Endybis chose the Roman aureus to standardize Aksumite coin weights against , with gold issues at half @-@ aureus around 2 @.@ 70 grams ( more precisely , the theoretical weight may have been <unk> ) . 
 = = = Aphilas = = = 
 Whereas all of Endubis 's coins feature the king with a headcloth or helmet , Aphilas 's coins show the king wearing an impressive high crown on top of the headcloth . The crown featured colonnades of arches supporting high spikes , on top of which rested large discs of unidentified composition . In addition to the crown and headcloth , Aphilas 's coins included further images of regalia , such as a spear , a branch with berries , the depiction of the arms , the addition of tassels with fringes to the imperial robe , and more jewelry , such as amulets and bracelets . Despite this innovation , Aphilas continued to use the image of himself in the regnal headcloth in some coins , sometimes as the reverse , while his crowned image is only found on the obverse . 
 One of his issues included his frontal image on the obverse , which ended with his reign and was only revived by the late kings . Two other minting features of Aphilas were also abandoned by later rulers . One of these was the use of just the inscription " King Aphilas " as the reverse of a coin , the only purely epigraphical side ever used on an Aksumite coin . The other was his use of a single ear of barley or wheat as a reverse , though his use of two ears circling around the king 's image continued . 
 Aphilas introduced a number of different standards for all three metals , some of which lasted through to the 7th century , while the use of others ended with his reign . His new gold coins ( issued in conjunction with the older ) of a quarter aureus and eighth aureus were soon abandoned ( each are known from only one specimen ) , and 1 / 16 aureus coins have been found , though these are more likely to be deliberate debasements to increase profit ( Aksumite gold was generally very pure , however ) . Aphilas 's silver coin , however , issued at half the weight of the former , became the new Aksumite standard for silver up until the end of coinage . The older coin was presumably more valuable than needed , and the new coin remedied the problem . Aphilas 's bronze issue , however , was instead doubled to 4 @.@ 83 grams . The coin 's rarity may attest to its quick withdrawal from the market , as is assumed with his quarter @-@ aureus . These two issues are the only one of Aphilas 's issues to portray him frontally , rather than in profile . 
 = = = Ezana = = = 
 During Ezana 's reign a major change in both the Aksumite kingdom and its coinage took place as a result of the change of the official religion to Christianity , one of the first states ever to do so . While Ezana 's coins in the first half of his reign are almost identical to those of Aphilas , barring minimal weight reductions , those of his second half employ revolutionary designs . With his conversion to Christianity , Ezana began to feature the Cross on his coins , the first time the Christian cross had ever been featured in coinage in the world . Some of his gold Christian coins are of the weight before Constantine I 's weight reform in 324 , indicating a conversion before this date or perhaps a few years after , as the Aksumite coinage may not have changed weights immediately . Along with the adoption of the Cross on his coins came , of course , the abandonment of the star and crescent symbol on the coins . Later Christian coins reflect the <unk> of the 4 @.@ 54 g standard by Constantine , with theoretical weights in Aksumite coins likewise dropping to 1 @.@ 70 g for the gold coins . 
 Coins of Ezana without any symbol at all have also been found , along with similar <unk> coins of his father , <unk> . These may reflect a transition in the religion in Aksum when <unk> was influencing Ezana 's father and gathering Christians in the country , giving weight to the writings of Rufinus . The lack of symbol altogether may reflect an uncertainty as how best to exhibit the change in religion of the Aksumite state .

 The gold coin weighed on average 2 @.@ 5 @-@ 2 @.@ 8 grams and was 15 – 21 mm in diameter at the start of issue , in 270 @-@ 300 .

 Most bronze and silver coins have mainly been found in Aksum territory , with very few pieces found in Judea , Meroë and Egypt . They are based roughly on the size of older Roman As and <unk> in shape and thickness . The design also developed like Roman coins in first being good but then the pictures turn archaic and non recognisable . The name is unknown so it is referred to as an Æ diameter in mm Unit , like <unk> for a coin of 17 mm . 
 = = Trade = = 
 At the time of Aksum 's minting of currency , the state already had a long trade history with Greece , Rome , the Persian Empire , and India . That coinage began so late is in fact a little surprising . The late use of coinage may be attributed to the lack of a developed economy , required for coinage to be accepted . Most Aksumite coins were found in the large trade centres with very few in remote villages , where trade would be more through barter and not coinage based . In fact , the motivation for Aksum 's initial minting of coins was for foreign trade and markets , as evidenced by the use of Greek on most of its coins . Moreover , gold coins seem to have been intended primarily for external trade , while copper and silver coins probably mainly circulated within the Aksumite empire , as the gold issues generally specified " king of the Aksumites " as title of the Aksumite king , whereas the title of silver and copper issues generally only read " king . " International use of Aksumite coins seems to have begun early on , as coins of King Ezana and even of King Aphilas ( the second Aksumite ruler to issue coins ) have been found in India . 
 = = Decline = = 
 During the 7th century , Aksumite power began to fail , and Ethiopian society began to withdraw further into the highland hinterlands , with the coastal areas becoming peripheral areas ( whereas <unk> on the coast was once the second city of Aksum ) . The coins continued circulation , but were restricted to more local areas such as Nubia , South Arabia and the Horn of Africa . 
 = = Archaeology = = 
 Due to the nature of the coins ( e.g. providing kings ' names ) , they have proved essential in constructing a chronology of the Kings of Aksum . An estimated 98 percent of the city of Aksum remains unexcavated , and other areas even more so . Through analysis of the number of coins produced and the style of coins , archaeologists have been able to construct a rough chronology , generally agreed upon until the late <unk> and 7th @-@ century kings . Of the 20 Aksumite Kings attested by their coins , inscriptions corroborate the existence of only two , who happen to be the most famous kings : Ezana and Kaleb , both of whose reigns were periods of exceptional prosperity during the height of the Aksumite kingdom . 
 Many coins have been found in northern Ethiopia and Eritrea , the central region of Aksum , though Aksumite coins are reported to have been found in <unk> and Lalibela . Many coins have been also found further afield . Numerous hoards of coins ( always gold save one silver coin ) have been found in Southern Arabia , much more than in Aksum itself , attesting perhaps to an Aksumite presence in parts of the region ( perhaps supporting the use of titles claiming control over parts of South Arabia from GDRT 's time ) . The hoards may be the remnants of hoards left in Kaleb 's time ( perhaps used to pay soldiers ) , when it was under an Aksumite governor . Outside of the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula , coins have been found as far as Israel , <unk> , Egypt , and India . Silver and copper coins are mainly found in Aksum , though some can be traced to Palestinian pilgrim centers . 
 In addition to historical evidence , the coins ' use of Ge 'ez provides valuable linguistic information . Though rarely used , the vocalization of Ge 'ez sometimes employed on Aksumite coins allows linguists to analyze vowel changes and shifts that cannot be represented in the older Semitic <unk> such as Hebrew , Arabic , South Arabian , and earlier , <unk> Ge 'ez .

 = The Revolution Will Not Be Televised ( film ) = 
 The Revolution Will Not Be Televised ( Spanish : La revolución no será <unk> ) , also known as Chávez : Inside the Coup , is a 2003 documentary focusing on events in Venezuela leading up to and during the April 2002 coup d 'état attempt , which saw President Hugo Chávez removed from office for two days . With particular emphasis on the role played by Venezuela 's private media , the film examines several key incidents : the protest march and subsequent violence that provided the impetus for Chávez 's ousting ; the opposition 's formation of an interim government headed by business leader Pedro Carmona ; and the Carmona administration 's collapse , which paved the way for Chávez 's return . The Revolution Will Not Be Televised was directed by Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and <unk> Ó Briain . Given direct access to Chávez , the filmmakers intended to make a fly @-@ on @-@ the @-@ wall biography of the president . They spent seven months filming in Venezuela , following Chávez and his staff and interviewing ordinary citizens . As the coup unfolded on 11 April , Bartley and Ó Briain filmed on the streets of the capital , Caracas , capturing footage of protesters and the erupting violence . Later , they filmed many of the political upheavals inside Miraflores , the presidential palace . 
 Bartley and Ó Briain conceived of the film after Bartley returned from documenting the aftermath of the 1999 Vargas mudslides for an Irish charity . Following a visit to Venezuela to determine the feasibility of a film project , the pair formed a production company and applied to Ireland 's film board , Bord <unk> na hÉireann ( BSÉ ) , for a development grant . At BSÉ 's request , the filmmakers partnered with a more experienced producer and shot a short pilot to show to potential investors . Funding for the € 200 @,@ 000 production was provided by BSÉ and several European broadcasters . Bartley and Ó Briain shot more than 200 hours of material ; editing focused on identifying footage that would make the film entertaining and drive the plot . It was at this stage that the film 's coverage narrowed to concentrate more on the coup attempt . 
 The film was positively received by mainstream film critics and won several awards . Reviewers cited the filmmakers ' unprecedented proximity to key events and praised the film for its " riveting narrative " ; criticism focused on its lack of context and pro @-@ Chávez bias . First shown on television in Europe and Venezuela in 2003 , The Revolution Will Not Be Televised later appeared at film festivals and secured a limited theatrical release on the art house circuit . Independent activists held unofficial screenings , and Venezuelan government officials encouraged its circulation to build support for Chávez 's administration . The film is regularly shown on Venezuelan television , and in the capital it is often broadcast during " contentious political <unk> " . The Revolution Will Not Be Televised paints Chávez in a favorable light , which has led to disputes over its neutrality and accuracy ; particular attention is paid to its framing of the violence of 11 – 13 April , the filmmakers ' editing of the timeline , and the alleged omission of incidents and personnel . The film is variously cited as an accurate portrayal or a misrepresentation of the events of April 2002 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Throughout much of the twentieth century , Venezuela was beset by political , civil and military unrest . After Juan Vicente Gómez 's long reign as president ended in 1935 , a series of military rulers followed , concluding with Marcos Pérez Jiménez 's overthrow by general uprising in 1958 . Although the military remained influential , Venezuela 's government has since been chosen by civilians through democratic processes . Until 1998 , the dominant political parties were Acción Democrática and <unk> , who shared seven presidencies between them . In 1989 , during the second term in office for Acción Democrática 's Carlos Andrés Pérez , Venezuela was hit by a severe economic crisis . A wave of protests known as the <unk> engulfed the country and dozens were killed in rioting . 
 Hugo Chávez , then a Lieutenant Colonel in the army , had formed a secret revolutionary group ( MBR @-@ 200 ) in the early 1980s and was planning a " rebellious intervention " . He later felt the <unk> was a missed opportunity for his movement . Three years later , Chávez saw another chance ; in February 1992 , he led an unsuccessful military coup d 'état and was imprisoned . A second coup attempt , without his involvement , also failed . Chávez enjoyed some popular support for his actions . Released from prison in 1994 , he recast his revolutionary group as a legitimate socialist political party , the Fifth Republic Movement . The movement adopted former Venezuelan leader Simón Bolívar as its " iconic hero " and " reference point " ; Bolívar had played a key role in Latin America 's successful struggle for independence from Spain in the 1820s . In the 1998 presidential election , Chávez won 56 @.@ 2 % of the vote , on a promise to " end the corruption of several decades " and institute a new Bolivarian Revolution that he felt would secure Latin America 's true independence from the outside world . 
 Chávez strengthened his support among the poor with a series of social initiatives known as the Bolivarian Missions , and created a network of grass @-@ roots workers ' councils , the Bolivarian Circles . Nevertheless , by early 2002 , Venezuela was " embroiled ... in a severe political crisis " as Chávez sought to bring more of the country 's vast oil wealth under state control . Although the state @-@ owned radio and television stations remained staunch advocates of Chávez 's stated policies — to redistribute the nation 's wealth to the poorest — the private media was more hostile . The crisis reached a head when Chávez attempted to remove the management of the state oil company , Petróleos de Venezuela ( PDVSA ) , provoking a showdown . " Oil managers , business leaders , and large segments of organized labor " called a general strike . The strike was backed by a large segment of the population , " particularly the country 's increasingly impoverished middle class " and army officers upset at the increasing politicization of the military . 
 On 11 April 2002 , hundreds of thousands of people marched in protest against the government . Abandoning their planned route , the marchers advanced towards the palace , a path that took them close to government supporters who had come out in opposition to the protest . Journalist Phil Gunson wrote , " Shooting broke out on all sides . A score of civilians died and more than 150 suffered gunshot wounds . The military high command called for Chávez to resign , and at 3 : 20 the next morning they announced he had agreed to do so . The presidency was assumed by a business leader , Pedro Carmona , but his government collapsed in less than forty @-@ eight hours and Chávez returned to power . " 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 The Revolution Will Not Be Televised opens in 2001 with footage of Chávez as he tours the country . Met with " popular enthusiasm " , he speaks at rallies , decrying neoliberalism and the international community 's attacks on his character . The film outlines Chávez 's rise to power , before covering his day @-@ to @-@ day routine and appearances on his television show , Aló Presidente , which includes a phone @-@ in for citizens to speak with the president . Chávez outlines his aspiration to be seen as a modern @-@ day Bolívar . Clips from Venezuelan and United States news reports demonstrate a " relentless campaign " against the president . 
 Interviews with communities from both sides of the political divide indicate how Chávez is seen by the rich and poor . The latter support his stated aim to redistribute the country 's oil wealth ; the former fear totalitarianism and are worried Chávez will institute communism . In February 2002 , the media war intensifies after Chavez takes control of PDVSA . The film states that the company was previously run as a private interest for the benefit of a minority , despite being state @-@ owned . Business leader Pedro Carmona and union boss Carlos Ortega are the main voices of the opposition . After the pair visit Washington , D.C. , the CIA and the State Department express concern about Chávez 's rule and stress the importance of Venezuela 's oil . A Venezuelan general appears on private television to voice similar disquiet . Carmona appeals for a public protest at the offices of PDVSA . 
 On 11 April , opposition protesters begin their march outside PDVSA 's headquarters in Caracas ; Chávez 's supporters gather outside the presidential palace . The protest route is changed to take it to the palace ; shots ring out and civilians are killed . The private media blames Chávez 's supporters , citing footage that shows them shooting at opposition protesters from a bridge . The narration states , " What the TV stations didn 't broadcast was [ this camera angle ] , which clearly shows that the streets below were empty . The opposition march had never taken that route . " Later , the state television signal is cut ; rumors circulate that the opposition has taken over the studio . At the palace , members of the military high command demand Chávez 's resignation , threatening to bomb the building . The president refuses to resign , but submits to their custody . He is led away , and Carmona announces on television that a transitional government will be established . 
 On 12 April , opposition leaders appear on private television , where they disclose their plan to unseat Chávez . Carmona is sworn in as president while images play of unrest on the streets . Defying media censorship , Chávez 's supporters disseminate the story that the president did not resign . On 13 April , they gather to protest outside Miraflores , while palace guards plot to retake the building . The guards take up key positions and , at a prearranged signal , take members of the new government prisoner . The state television channel is relaunched and urges the army to back Chávez . " Full military control " is returned to the Chávez administration and the president arrives at the palace amid celebratory scenes . Chávez makes an address in which he says it is fine to oppose him , but not the Constitution of Venezuela . The closing titles say Carmona fled to Miami while under house arrest , and that Ortega went into hiding , only reappearing to help lead the opposition after Chávez said there would be no repercussions . Most of the dissident generals , after being expelled from the army , fled to the US . Others remained as part of the opposition .

 In December 1999 , independent Irish filmmaker Kim Bartley visited Venezuela as part of Concern Worldwide 's emergency response team , to document the aftermath of the 1999 Vargas mudslides that had devastated much of Vargas State in the north of the country . Bartley become fascinated with how those affected by the tragedy perceived Chávez , and in late 2000 , she and <unk> Ó Briain — a filmmaker and former colleague who shared her interest in " Latin American politics and issues around globalization " — spent two weeks in Caracas to determine the feasibility of a film project . The pair formed a production company , Runway Films , and in January 2001 applied to Ireland 's film board , Bord <unk> na hÉireann ( BSÉ ) , for a development grant . Bartley and Ó Briain proposed a fly @-@ on @-@ the @-@ wall documentary , a " personal profile and intimate portrait " of Chávez that would be " broadly supportive " of him . During their 2000 visit , the filmmakers had sensed that " something genuinely was happening " in Caracas , and felt an urgency to get the project underway ; even so , it wasn 't until April 2001 that BSÉ approved the £ 6000 ( € 9500 ) grant . 
 The project was at this point named Aló Presidente , a working title taken from Chávez 's weekly television and radio program . BSÉ set about exploring avenues of funding ; the organization persuaded Bartley and Ó Briain to make a short pilot to show to potential investors , but refused the filmmakers ' application for a € 60 @,@ 000 grant towards their € 131 @,@ 000 production budget . BSÉ felt the pair needed to partner with a production company that had experience in the field , and which could help raise the remaining funds . Bartley and Ó Briain approached Power Pictures and , with the addition of David Power as a producer , reapplied for the grant . Even as filming began , the full budget — now at € 200 @,@ 000 — had not been secured . David Power pitched the project at several documentary festivals and markets . At Dublin 's Stranger Than Fiction festival in September 2001 , the BBC , S4C and Channel 4 declined to invest . Raidió Teilifís Éireann ( RTÉ ) expressed interest in providing development funds ; no such deal was made , but RTÉ did offer € 10 @,@ 000 ( subsequently € 20 @,@ 000 ) for the Irish broadcast rights . In October , the Dutch broadcaster Nederlandse <unk> Stichting also committed € 10 @,@ 000 . At a November market in Amsterdam , Power once again approached the BBC and was turned down , as the organization believed the film 's subject was " too far away to be relevant to [ its viewers ' ] lives " . However , RTÉ 's Kevin Dawson pushed the film at a European Broadcasting Union pitching session , securing the interest of German television channel ZDF , which subsequently provided funds . In late 2001 , BSÉ finally approved a production grant of € 63 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 In 2000 , Bartley and Ó Briain had been promised " exclusive access " to Chávez by the government 's Minister of Communications . They arrived in Venezuela in September 2001 . While filming the pilot they met the president , after which they reconsidered their approach . Bartley explained , " We had ... this notion of investigating Chávez — was he a demagogue ? Was the media persona just that ? What makes him tick ? My sense had changed as we got closer ; what we 're seeing here is a guy who is motivated , driven , not the demagogue with another side , drinking , carousing . I began to see him as more transparent — what you see is what you get . " Bartley and Ó Briain began by attempting to build a relationship with Chávez that would allow them the access they required . At first , the president 's staff treated the filmmakers with suspicion and made filming difficult . After numerous delays , Bartley and Ó Briain finally got through to Chávez . They calculated that they needed to " press the right buttons " to gain his support , so they presented him with an old edition of the memoirs of Daniel Florence O 'Leary , who had fought alongside Simón Bolívar . Inside , they had written a quote from the Irish socialist playwright Seán O 'Casey . Slowly , Bartley and Ó Briain gained their subjects ' trust , " dissolving any self @-@ consciousness as a result of their cameras " . 
 Although ensconced with Chávez and his entourage , Bartley and Ó Briain felt a disconnect from the events of the outside world . During a " chaotic " road @-@ trip with Chávez , they " knew something was coming " , and divined that Chávez 's trip was intended to bolster his support and " get people used to being on the streets " . Chávez had recently " upped the ante " with the introduction of the Land Law . Increasing tensions further , in February 2002 , Chávez took control of PDVSA ; the private media stepped up its criticism of Chávez , which for Bartley and Ó Briain " marked the beginning of an exciting phase " . By April 2002 , Bartley and Ó Briain were in Caracas and spent much of their time filming at the presidential palace , following Chávez and his staff . As the 11 April crisis unfolded , Bartley and Ó Briain filmed outside the palace , first capturing footage of the demonstrations and subsequent violence , then events inside the palace during the afternoon , evening and early hours of 12 April . Through their previous contacts at the palace , Bartley and Ó Briain were able to continue filming without interference : " no one paid any attention to us — we just blended in . " Later that day , Bartley and Ó Briain stayed away from the palace through fears for their safety . Unable to leave the country — the international airport was closed — the filmmakers instead took to the streets , " to document the repression [ they ] were witnessing " . At the same time , a press office cameraman was in the palace , " reluctant to lose his job despite the change in government " . He filmed the formation of the interim government . When Bartley and Ó Briain returned to the palace on 13 April , the cameraman let them have his footage . They remained filming in Venezuela until July 2002 , interviewing residents and recording " witness " accounts from those who had been present during the coup — ministers , security guards and journalists . 
 = = = Editing = = = 
 Using two digital video ( DV ) cameras , Bartley and Ó Briain shot over 200 hours of material on 300 DV tapes . They intended that editing take ten weeks ; instead , it took six months . Rod Stoneman , BSÉ 's CEO at the time , described the amount of footage compared to the film 's final length as " exceptional " . The 200 : 1 ratio was far above the norm for most documentaries , which usually have a ratio of 10 : 1 or 15 : 1 . When the filmmakers returned to Ireland , they decided they needed an editor who spoke Spanish . Bartley remembered a documentary she had seen about baseball in Cuba , El juego de Cuba , so they hired its editor , Ángel Hernández Zoido . Zoido approached the film as if it were entertainment , feeling that the primary concern was to ensure the audience did not get bored . He tackled each scene the same way . After watching the rushes with Bartley and Ó Briain , Zoido asked them , " What do we want to tell in this scene ? " He focused on two factors : how much information would be necessary to drive the plot , and provide an emotional core . Preferring to work alone , Zoido would then send the filmmakers from the edit suite . After Zoido completed the scene , the trio discussed whether those aims had been realized . 
 The large amount of footage , and the fact that the filmmakers were " in a sense ... looking at it for the first time " , meant that the film 's concept only became clear during editing . The events of 11 – 13 April gave it " a new dramatic centre " , although Bartley and Ó Briain were keen that the film did not concentrate entirely on the coup . They had intended to include more historical and political context ; it wasn 't until late in post @-@ production that the focus narrowed to include more emphasis on the media 's role in Venezuelan politics . In October 2002 , a two @-@ hour " rough cut " was shown to Stoneman and Brendan McCarthy , BSÉ 's head of Production and Development . This version included the " witness " accounts that Bartley and Ó Briain had captured after April 2002 . Stoneman felt that these sequences reinforced the film 's claims , but " diluted its originality " . He argued that they be cut , and that to compensate , Bartley and Ó Briain should record a voice @-@ over and place themselves more in the frame as witness @-@ protagonists , ideas that the filmmakers initially resisted . 
 As editing progressed , budget shortfalls prevented BSÉ from finalizing contracts . The organization also restricted post @-@ production funds to " limit [ its ] exposure " in the event the project was not completed . Stoneman contacted a former colleague at the BBC , Nick Fraser , who had declined to help finance the film in 2001 . Fraser was commissioning editor for the BBC 's Storyville documentaries series . According to Stoneman , Fraser was " still undecided " , having been told by the head of BBC Two that " we 've done Chávez " . Nevertheless , the BBC pre @-@ purchased the film and in December 2002 received a rough cut . At the BBC 's behest , the opening of the television version was made more dramatic . Fraser was unsure about the voice @-@ over ; he asked for a more " opinionated " narration that , according to Bartley , would " get the boot in " . Although the BBC did not ask outright , Bartley 's impression was that the organization wanted the film to be " against Chávez " . Fraser later said he had asked for the filmmakers to " include [ an interview ] with someone not a Chávez supporter " . He also suggested that a more experienced director be employed to help edit the film . The filmmakers " made a few minor concessions " , but resisted major edits . Ó Briain 's voice @-@ over in the final cut was " polished up but not significantly changed " . 
 The filmmakers created two versions of the film . Chávez : Inside the Coup , intended for television broadcast , lasts 52 minutes . The feature @-@ length The Revolution Will Not Be Televised — which takes its name from the Gil Scott @-@ Heron song of the same name — is 74 minutes long .

 Chávez : Inside the Coup aired on RTÉ One on 18 February 2003 , as an installment of the channel 's True Lives documentary series . The broadcast prompted a passionate public and critical response , and " lively debate " on radio and in newspapers ; RTÉ soon arranged for a repeat broadcast . In the United Kingdom , it aired on BBC Two on 16 October 2003 , as part of the channel 's Storyville documentary strand , and on BBC Four on 18 November 2003 . Chavez : Inside the Coup also aired in Canada , Japan , Germany , France , the Netherlands , Finland and Denmark . The speed of the television broadcasts left a full theatrical run unlikely — a fact the filmmakers later regretted . The film also failed to be picked up by a television company in the US , although HBO was interested at one point . In Venezuela , La revolución no será <unk> premièred on 13 April 2003 , on state television channel Venezolana de Televisión ( VTV ) . It has since been shown regularly on Venezuelan television ; the state @-@ funded community station <unk> <unk> often broadcasts the film during " contentious political <unk> " , such as the 2004 recall referendum , the 2006 presidential election , and in 2007 to " help build support " for the government 's controversial attempt to not renew the license of private television network RCTV .

 The Revolution Will Not Be Televised screened at several film festivals in 2003 , winning numerous awards . Beginning with the South by Southwest festival on 7 March , its festival appearances included the Banff World Television Festival , the Seattle International Film Festival , the Marseille Festival of Documentary Film , the Three Continents Film Festival , the Chicago International Film Festival , the Monaco International Film Festival , the Galway Film <unk> and the Los Angeles Wine & Country Festival . In March 2003 , a VHS copy of the film screened to under 100 people as part of an American Cinematheque Irish film festival in Los Angeles . Among the viewers was the president of Vitagraph Films , David Schultz , who bought the rights for theatrical distribution and paid for the film to be converted from video . Schultz initially struggled to secure the support of exhibitors ; they were skeptical of the film 's commercial prospects , and believed " the environment was not hospitable " for a film critical of the US so close to the start of the 2003 invasion of Iraq . They only became receptive a few months later , when political perceptions shifted and the public became more aware of Venezuela because of its oil wealth . One such exhibitor was the Film Forum in New York City . Mike Maggiore , a programmer at the theater , worked to market the film and raise its profile with film critics . He created press kits and circulated information to appeal to " a particular audience " . 
 The Revolution Will Not Be Televised premièred to the public at the Film Forum in November 2003 . The showing was accompanied by protests outside the theater from supporters and detractors of the film , both of whom " attempted to influence audience reception " . A few weeks previously , the film had been withdrawn from an Amnesty International film festival in Vancouver ; staff at the organization 's Caracas arm said they " feared for their safety if it were shown " . The film 's success at the 2003 Grierson Awards was also overshadowed by a letter to the Grierson jury from London @-@ based Venezuelan filmmakers , who disputed its version of events . Opposition demonstrators at the Film Forum première attempted to throw doubt on the film 's " impartiality , precision , veracity , editorial integrity , and ideological independence " , while supporters " encouraged theatergoers to denounce censorship " and sign a petition . Opposition protests also greeted showings in Canada , Australia and France . The run at the Film Forum earned $ 26 @,@ 495 ( € 22 @,@ 600 ) — several thousand above Maggiore 's expectations . After a limited run in theaters in six cities , the film had earned over $ 200 @,@ 000 ( € 171 @,@ 000 ) , not quite profitable , but still considered " a significant sum for a documentary " .

 Bartley and Ó Briain showed the film to Chávez in February 2003 . They recalled his response as " quite emotional " . BSÉ waived Venezuelan licensing fees for the film ; on 13 April , it was screened simultaneously with the television broadcast at a cinema in Caracas , before which Chávez made a speech saying , " Watch this film and you will see the face of the coup . " Pro @-@ Chávez activists also distributed the film unofficially . The Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador screened the film in New York City , where Bolivarian Circle members " accepted donations " for bootleg copies . El Universal said the Venezuelan government had 10 @,@ 000 copies made , and according to National Review , the Venezuela Information Office ( <unk> ) " encouraged art @-@ house theaters " to screen the film . Government representatives aided the film 's distribution officially and unofficially . Venezuelan filmmaker Wolfgang Schalk said the film counted on the worldwide support of Venezuelan embassies and a public relations effort to show the film free at universities and theaters in cities such as San Francisco , Los Angeles , Chicago and New York . Peace Action New York was given permission for a screening during a fund raiser in the Lincoln Center , where 250 people paid $ 35 ( € 30 ) each to see the film and take part in a " question @-@ and @-@ answer session " with guests such as Leonor Granado , the Venezuelan Consul General . The consulate office made DVDs of the film available to " anyone who wanted a copy " , as Granado said the film was vital to " building support in [ the US ] for the Venezuelan government " . 
 Journalist Michael McCaughan invited a group of people who held anti @-@ Chávez views to a screening of the film . He said some among the audience changed their opinion of Chávez after seeing it , although many remained hostile . McCaughan said the consensus opinion was that the film was " ' excellent ' and reasonably objective " , but that " Chávez remained a dictator leading the country to a totalitarian grave " . As of 2006 , groups such as Global Exchange were arranging tours to Venezuela that included a screening of the film .

 = = = Disputed accuracy = = = 
 In Venezuela , debate about The Revolution Will Not Be Televised is " often acrimonious " . The film has become key to framing people 's understanding of the events of April 2002 . The previously accepted international view was that Chávez 's ousting came from a " spontaneous popular response " to the repression of his regime ; the film " directly contradicts " this position , and since its release it has rapidly become " the prevailing interpretation of [ the crisis ] " . The film 's critics charge that it omits or misrepresents important events . Much of the criticism is centered on the filmmakers ' " use of stock [ documentary ] devices " , such as compositing clips from several events to present them as one incident . Parallel editing also depicts sequences as if they occurred at the same time , when some of the footage was captured on different days . Bartley and Ó Briain justify these methods as standard practice in the construction of documentary realist films . Caracas @-@ based journalist Phil Gunson , writing in Columbia Journalism Review , says that most of the film critics who embraced the film ignored " the complex , messy reality " of the situation . He charges that the filmmakers " omit key facts , invent others , twist the sequence of events to support their case , and replace inconvenient images with others dredged from archives " . Bartley and Ó Briain argue that Gunson 's points are " issues of dispute " that " continue to divide opinion " in Venezuela . Author Brian A. Nelson says that Bartley and Ó Briain — in their initial meeting with Chávez — did more than merely invoke Daniel O 'Leary to gain the president 's support for filming ; Nelson alleges that they offered to portray the president positively in return for open access , with a " you scratch my back if I scratch yours " understanding that he says was ultimately reflected in the film 's " unabashed pro @-@ <unk> . "

 Soon after the film 's October 2003 broadcast on BBC Two , Venezuelan filmmaker Wolfgang Schalk began a campaign against The Revolution Will Not Be Televised , representing El <unk> de Luz ( " The Worm of Light " ) , an organization associated with the Venezuelan opposition . In July , Schalk had complained to RTÉ about its broadcast of the film . On 21 October , El <unk> de Luz published a " detailed critique " as part of an internet petition that attracted 11 @,@ 000 signatories , 85 % of whom self @-@ identified as Venezuelan . Directed at the European broadcasters that financed and aired the film , the petition said in part , " The Revolution Will Not Be Televised is being presented as an author 's film , as an objective journalistic research film , while it is really a very well plotted and accomplished propaganda operation , supported logistically by the Venezuelan government , with the aim of misleading unprepared spectators of countries who do not know the totality of events . " The petition submitted 18 specific points of contention with the film . Venezuelan private television soon aired two programs " dissecting and denouncing " the film , and similar newspaper articles followed . 
 Much of the anger about the film stemmed from its high profile internationally ; that it had been " blessed with the imprimatur of the BBC ... with its connotations of fair and authoritative reporting " only made matters worse . John Burns , writing in The Sunday Times , restated many of Gunson 's arguments , and the BBC received 4 @,@ 000 e @-@ mails demanding that Storyville 's commissioning editor , Nick Fraser , be sacked . Toward the end of 2003 , the weight of criticism forced the BBC to act . The corporation 's complaints unit opened an investigation , and Fraser said the BBC would not show the film again until it had concluded . He wrote to David Power expressing particular concern over an error with the end titles and the use of out @-@ of @-@ chronology footage , saying the latter was " a real problem — particularly ... since it has been used in a film dedicated to exposing the frauds of Venezuelan TV " . The furor came at a difficult time for the corporation , which was under the spotlight of the Hutton Inquiry , the official investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of David Kelly ; the BBC had been criticized for reporting that intelligence dossiers had been " sexed up " by the UK government to justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq . 
 The petition 's claims were also taken up by the UK 's independent telecommunications regulator , Ofcom . The body investigated official protests made by several Caracas residents . The concerns largely focused on footage of the residents ' attending a neighborhood meeting in June 2002 , which was positioned in the film as a prelude to the April coup attempt . The residents said that the filmmakers had used footage of them without consent and that the film had misrepresented their views . In September 2005 , Ofcom provisionally ruled that it had not upheld the complaints , citing the BBC 's internal review and rebuttal as grounds . A subsequent appeal by the residents was unsuccessful . Two weeks after Ofcom 's initial ruling , the BBC announced it had closed the complaint and that no further investigations would take place . Stoneman believed the BBC had overreacted , saying its <unk> was merely a product of being a frequent victim of press attacks on its ethos . Fraser said , " The film was very good in many respects , but also misleading . " He believed the filmmakers considered Chávez honorable , but having written a book on Peronism was more skeptical himself . Fraser concluded , " I still think it 's a good film , because of the coup sequence . It should be seen as a Venezuelan West Wing — biased , of course , but highly entertaining . " 
 = = = Responsibility for violence = = = 
 One of the film 's key contentions is that the private media aired footage selectively to make it look like the violence of 11 April was caused by Chávez 's supporters , portraying them as an " irrational and uncivilized mob " . Private television repeatedly showed Chávez 's supporters on Puente Llaguno bridge as they shot at Baralt Avenue below , an area purportedly full of opposition marchers . The film says this footage was edited to show the gunmen but not the people near them who were ducking to avoid being shot . It follows with images taken from above the bridge showing an empty Baralt Avenue , claiming that " the opposition march had never taken that route " and that Chávez 's supporters were only returning fire . Gunson charges that this edit is itself a misrepresentation , stating that the film does not mention that both sets of marchers were fired upon , and taking issue with the implication that " coup plotters " were the shooters . In response , the filmmakers say , " Nowhere in the film did we say that only [ Chávez 's supporters ] were shot ... Nobody can say with certainty who orchestrated the shootings . " Gunson also asserts that the footage of the empty street was taken earlier that day , citing an " analysis of the shadows " by Schalk , who created a counter @-@ documentary , X @-@ Ray of a Lie , to examine The Revolution Will Not Be Televised " scene by scene to uncover [ its ] narrative strategies and use of artifice " . Brian A. Nelson agreed with the analysis , claiming that Baralt Avenue was not as empty as the film portrays and that the filmmakers " put a black bar at the top of the frame to hide the Metropolitan Police trucks that were still there " . Bartley and Ó Briain reaffirmed their claim that the opposition did not pass below the Puente Llaguno bridge , citing eyewitness statements — including one from Le Monde <unk> 's deputy editor — and an Australian documentary , Anatomy of a Coup , that " came to conclusions similar to our own " . A Venezuelan documentary , Puente Llaguno : <unk> de una <unk> , also supported Bartley and Ó Briain 's view . 
 = = = Timeline and media depictions = = = 
 Other issues of contention include the lack of historical context ; the film does not cover some of the events leading up to Chávez 's ousting , including the long @-@ running political crisis and the general strike . Gunson also criticizes the filmmakers for showing events out of order . In June 2002 , they filmed an opposition community group as its members considered " how to defend themselves against possible ... attacks " from Chávez 's supporters . In the film , this sequence is placed before the march . Bartley justified the action , saying that the residents ' opinions were representative of those held " long before " the events of April 2002 . Responding to the critique , the BBC added a date stamp to the sequence for the film 's repeat broadcast . Gunson also cites footage of Caracas mayor Freddy Bernal as he sings to a happy group of Chávez supporters in front of the palace . Later images of a " differently dressed Bernal " reveal that the footage was from another day . Similarly , Gunson says that until shot at , " The opposition march was entirely peaceful . " The film presents footage of its " violent finale " — including an image from another day — as if it occurred during the protest 's approach to the palace , accompanied by the narrated claim that " some in the vanguard looked ready for a fight " . Bartley and Ó Briain admit that they included a " limited " amount of archive footage , but say it was a " legitimate reconstruction " to build context " before the core narrative of the coup [ took ] off " as they " could not be everywhere filming at all times " . 
 The Revolution Will Not Be Televised claims that state television was " the only channel to which [ Chávez ] had access " , but does not mention that during the violence he requisitioned " all radio and TV frequencies " to broadcast his two @-@ hour address . Private television circumvented the rules allowing this action by splitting the screen , showing Chávez 's address on one side and footage of the violence on the other . Chávez subsequently took television stations RCTV and <unk> off the air . The film 's assertion that VTV was taken over by opposition " plotters " is also disputed ; according to X @-@ Ray of a Lie and Gunson , staff left willingly . Gunson further alleges that footage of VTV 's signal being cut — mid @-@ interview with a government legislator — was fabricated . Bartley and Ó Briain say they witnessed ministers ' being unable to broadcast and that the International Federation of Journalists corroborated their claim that opposition forces took over VTV . The film also presents footage of armored vehicles around the palace , which Gunson says were there at the request of the president , not the opposition . He also challenges the film for presenting Chávez 's supporters as " invariably poor , brown @-@ skinned , and cheerful " and the opposition as " rich , white , racist , and violent " . He says that the opposition protests were multiracial and that armed government supporters " made the center of Caracas a no @-@ go area " . Bartley and Ó Briain cite several commentators who uphold the claim that Chávez 's supporters " were broadly poor and dark @-@ skinned and the opposition broadly white and middle class " , including Gunson himself in an April 2002 article in The Christian Science Monitor . Gunson does agree that the film was right to point out that the private media " behaved disgracefully " by " systematically [ excluding the pro @-@ Chávez ] viewpoint from print , radio , and TV " during the period of the coup . 
 = = = Military involvement = = = 
 Of greater concern , Gunson says , is the " deliberate blurring of responsibility for the coup " . The film presents the idea that the military commanders dispersed , " leaving a total power vacuum " . However , the high command 's senior figure , General Lucas Rincón ( who announced Chávez 's resignation on television ) , was not part of the coup and remained in the government after April 2002 . The petition draws the conclusion , " ( 1 ) either General Rincón stated a truth that was accepted throughout the whole country ... or ( 2 ) General Rincón lied , because he was an accomplice ... that seems not to be the truth because he [ remained in Chávez 's administration ] . " Only one of the high command joined Carmona 's interim administration before contributing to its downfall by withdrawing his support . The military leaders shown withdrawing their support for Chávez were not the high command , and Vice @-@ Admiral Hector Ramirez Perez was not the head of the navy , as the film claims . Gunson says , " With one solitary exception , these generals and admirals had not ' fled abroad ' after the Carmona government collapsed . " Although Bartley and Ó Briain accept that Rincón said Chávez " had agreed to resign " , they reiterate that " elements in the military [ threatened ] force in the effort to make Chávez resign " ; the filmmakers say it is " irrelevant " that the whole military did not join the coup , as this " is the case with most coups " . General Rincón 's announcement was omitted because they felt it was " supplementary to the main , key fact of the story " , that no documentary evidence of the resignation exists .

 Schalk investigated The Revolution Will Not Be Televised for five months .

Schalk said the film " presented a distorted version of events ... to fit a story that appeals to audiences " . Schalk is associated with the Venezuelan opposition ; Bartley and Ó Briain say that it is " not insignificant that Schalk has led the well @-@ resourced campaign , linked to [ the opposition ] , to discredit and suppress [ the film ] " .

 In 2008 , Stoneman published Chavez : The Revolution Will Not Be Televised – A Case Study of Politics and the Media . A book " of film studies rather than politics " , it nevertheless looks in detail at the petition 's arguments . Stoneman " broadly absolves " the filmmakers ; he concludes , " There were some relatively small examples of slippage in the grammar of the piece , but overall the film was made with honesty and integrity . Of the 18 objections made , 15 , if not 17 , were wrong . The filmmakers spent a long time assembling evidence to show why they 'd done what they 'd done in the film and mostly it 's true . " Stoneman conceded that the filmmakers ' cinéma vérité approach meant that for wider historical and political context , viewers should look elsewhere .

 Among mainstream critics in the US and UK , the film received almost exclusively positive reviews . Rotten Tomatoes reported that 98 % of 48 sampled critics gave the film a positive review , with an average score of 7 @.@ 9 out of 10 . At Metacritic , which assigns a weighted average out of 100 to critics ' reviews , the film received a score of 82 based on 24 reviews . Almost all local and national film critics in the United States said the film presented a " riveting narrative " , but conceded that it was a biased account of the events . 
 Frank Scheck , writing in The Hollywood Reporter , said the film presented an enthralling story that " resembles a taut ... political thriller " , and Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun @-@ Times called it a " remarkable documentary " full of " astonishing shots " . Both critics said the film was made so through the filmmakers ' unique inside access to the events at the palace with Ebert calling that aspect " unique in film history " . Although Ebert was generally very praising of the film , he criticised the way in which Chávez 's opponents were portrayed , while <unk> faulted the lack of historical context ; however , he said this was balanced by the film 's " brevity and <unk> " . In Variety , Scott Foundas wrote that the film was a " superior example of fearless filmmakers in exactly the right place at the right time " , and likely the best of a string of documentaries that have shone the light on US involvement in South America . He had praise for the camera work and editing , and said the film was a " startling record " that reached " another level " when events shifted to the presidential palace . He cited these scenes — along with those of the protesters ' clashing — as ones that " spark with a vibrant tension and uncertainty " . 
 J. Hoberman of The Village Voice said the film was a " gripping " account that did " an excellent job in deconstructing the Venezuelan TV news footage of blood , chaos , and rival crowds " , and said it was " nearly a textbook on media manipulation " . Writing for The New York Times , Stephen Holden said the film was " a riveting documentary " that delivered " the suspense of a smaller @-@ scale Seven Days in May " , citing the way in which it examined how television can be used to " deceive and manipulate the public " . He reproached the film 's uncritical depiction of Chávez , and how it hinted at CIA involvement without presenting any proof . Ty Burr in The Boston Globe called the film " our best chance " to find out what really happened on 11 – 13 April , but cautioned that the filmmakers ' " pro @-@ Chávez stance " meant that for wider context audiences should look elsewhere , as it left out too much of Chávez 's record . Burr also said the film 's attempt to make the US into a villain was ineffective . He said , " because [ the filmmakers ] view the chasm that divides Venezuela purely in the context of the Cold War and Latin American political instability , they downplay the class warfare that 's exploding right in front of them . " Nevertheless , Burr concluded that the film 's narrow focus remained engrossing . 
 Desson Thomson of The Washington Post stated that the film successfully reproduced the " panic and fear " at the palace as events unfolded , saying it came across like a " raw , Costa @-@ Gavras @-@ style thriller " that was " worth watching down to the last thrilling minute " . He said that knowing how uncertain Venezuela 's future was made the film even more powerful . Thomson believed the handheld video was put to good use , calling its " news @-@ breaking immediacy ... intoxicating " . He concluded , " The Revolution Will Not Be Televised is an extraordinary piece of electronic history . And a riveting movie . " In the Miami New Times , Brett Sokol agreed that the film was " never less than thrilling " , but said that as history , it was " strictly agitprop " . Similarly , Mark Jenkins wrote in the Washington City Paper that the film was " unapologetically polemical " , but " notable foremost as a gripping you @-@ are @-@ there account " .

 " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " is a song by American recording artist D 'Angelo , released January 1 , 2000 on Virgin Records in the United States . It was issued as a radio single in promotion of his second studio album , Voodoo ( 2000 ) . Written and produced by D 'Angelo and Raphael Saadiq , the song was originally composed as a tribute to musician Prince . " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " contains a vintage style and sound similar to that of Prince 's early musical work . The song 's lyrics concern a man 's plea to his lover for sex . 
 The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics and it earned D 'Angelo a number of awards . " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " also earned notice for its controversial music video . Directed by Paul Hunter and Dominique Trenier , the video consists entirely of one shot featuring a muscular D 'Angelo appearing nude and lip @-@ synching to the track . While initial reaction from viewers was divided with praise for its sexuality and accusations of sexual objectification , the video received considerable airplay on music video networks such as MTV and BET , and it helped increase mainstream notice of D 'Angelo and Voodoo . 
 The music video for " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " had a considerable impact on D 'Angelo 's recording career , as it helped engender an image of him as a sex icon to a younger generation of fans . However , his discontent with this image led to his period of absence from the music scene following the conclusion of the supporting tour for Voodoo . The song won a Grammy Award for Best Male R & B Vocal Performance at the 43rd Grammy Awards in 2001 . Rolling Stone magazine named " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " the fourth best single of 2000 . The magazine later named it the fifty @-@ first best song of the 2000s ( decade ) .

 " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " was originally intended as a tribute to influential musician Prince . The song evokes Prince 's earlier work , in particular his balladry , from his Controversy period , as well as his musical style and falsetto vocal technique . As an homage to the musician , Ahmir " Questlove " Thompson , record producer for Voodoo , described the song as " finding the line between parody and honesty ... In an era of ' the cover song ' , redoing a Prince song was taboo . This is the second best thing " . Production of the song was handled by D 'Angelo and fellow neo soul musician Raphael Saadiq , who also contributed with bass and musical arrangements during recording in 1999 . The session took place at Electric Lady Studios , the recording studio originally built by influential rock musician Jimi Hendrix .

 = = = Musical structure = = = 
 " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " follows a six eight signature , while drum pattern , bass line , guitar and melodic phrasing feature traditional arrangements . Chalmers Alford 's electric guitar interplay throughout the song is reminiscent of the guitar style of Jimi Hendrix , as well as the " Maggot Brain " sound featured on the early work of Funkadelic . The song features a drum pattern with a uniform dynamic , which gives the impression of a live drummer playing in accordance to the sound of a drum machine . Overdubbing of D 'Angelo 's vocals , a contemporary R & B recording technique prominently used on the rest of Voodoo , was implemented a number of times during production in order to provide the sound of a choir singing harmonies during the choruses , all of which are sung by D 'Angelo . 
 The song begins with drummer Questlove 's off @-@ beat , cross @-@ snare clicks on the two and four beat with a messy kick . Music critic Steve McPherson noted that its first two measures sound " like a disaster " , contrasting its solid groove . While most musical compositions rely on tension and release , which can be produced by factors such as soft verses and loud choruses , gradual buildup , <unk> tension within verses or over the course of the bridge , or harmonic tension in chords that provides space for improvisation , D 'Angelo 's arrangements subdivide the tension into each moment of the song . According to McPherson , this results in " no linear way to measure how far off things slide before they pull themselves back ... can 't be measured in beats or fractions of beats in a meaningful way . For lack of a less cliched word , it 's entirely ' feel ' " . Similar to most of the song 's album , Voodoo , " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " has this syncopation style as its center . D 'Angelo 's casual vocal style follows the same concept , applying it to melody , harmony , and phrasing , and is accompanied by falsetto climbs and skittery phrasing similar to Prince 's singing . 
 Prior to the final chorus section , " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " features a song @-@ spanning dynamic after the bridge and guitar break that is accompanied by minor Rhodes piano and guitar chords , while the multi @-@ tracked vocals are implemented as background whispers . Arrangements for the song are stripped back for an emphasis on vocals , leading to an enormous choral climax accompanied by overdriven electric guitar . On the song 's final chorus section , critic Steve McPherson wrote " after it hits a peak , it keeps rising , the chorus of voices fizzing into overdrive and the whole track gradually succumbing to a wash of reverb " . The song is cut off in the middle of its culmination , ending with the line " How does it <unk> " . ( sample )

The song 's lyrics have been described as " generic pop lyrics " . Music critic Andy Peterson described the lyrics as " not – so – subtle " , citing the line " Baby close the door / Listen girl , I have something I wanna show you / I wish you ’ d open up cause I wanna take the walls down with you " as an example . Music journalist Greg Levine cited its lyrics as " the generic pop lyrics " , while also noting the similarity the lyrics have to those of other classic soul ballads , stating " Each line seems to be directly lifted from Marvin Gaye , Prince , or Curtis Mayfield . " Levine elaborated on the lyrical theme of the song :

 As the fourth single issued in promotion of D 'Angelo 's second studio album Voodoo , " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " featured release in the United Kingdom in 1999 through the EMI record label and in the United States on January 1 , 2000 through Virgin Records . In 2000 , a 12 @-@ inch vinyl release of the single was issued in the U.K. with distribution through EMI . The 12 @-@ inch single was released with cover artwork featuring an illustration of musician Jimi Hendrix and an upper caption reading " Electric Lady Studios " , serving as an homage to the musician and the recording studio , which were both influential to D 'Angelo during the production of Voodoo . " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " proved to be the greatest chart success of the album 's five radio singles , as it peaked at number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number 2 on the Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Singles & Tracks chart . The single entered the Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop <unk> & Tracks on January 8 , 2000 at number 65 and spent twenty @-@ two consecutive weeks on the chart .

 The song was well received by music critics . Miles Marshall Lewis of The Village Voice commented on its Prince influence , stating " D 's falsetto plays the " Do Me Baby " -era chocolate @-@ seduction Prince role " , while Mark Anthony Neal of PopMatters described the song as " simply the best Prince song since his Diamonds and Pearls days " . Neal cited " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " as the best track featured on Voodoo , and praised D 'Angelo 's style , stating " arguably Prince has never sounded better channeled through D 'Angelo . " On the song , Andy Peterson of The GW Hatchet wrote that " D ’ Angelo does a great impression of old @-@ school Prince , full of kinky keyboards , grinding guitars and not @-@ so @-@ subtle lyrics . " In citing it one of the Greatest Make @-@ Out Songs of All Time , Blender magazine wrote that D 'Angelo " set the pace for bump ' n ' grind in the Aughts . A high point for <unk> ' it low " . Reveille Magazine 's Steve McPherson called it " the best Prince song Prince never wrote " and cited the song 's climb to its final chorus section as " the finest musical approximation of sexual climax since Serge Gainsbourg 's ' Je T 'Aime , Moi Non Plus ' " .

 The song 's music video was directed and produced in one day at a soundstage in New York City by director Paul Hunter and Dominique Trenier , D 'Angelo 's manager at the time . The project was originally designed as a part of Trenier 's promotional strategy to transform D 'Angelo 's image and public appeal . On the video 's concept , Trenier stated , " the idea was , it would feel like one @-@ on @-@ one with whoever the woman was . " D 'Angelo , who had been under intense physical workout with personal trainer Mark Jenkins , was initially anxious to appear naked in the video upon hearing Trenier 's proposal . In a 2008 interview for Spin , Jenkins discussed D 'Angelo 's reluctance at the time to the idea for the video , stating " You 've got to realize , he 'd never looked like that before in his life . To somebody who was so introverted , and then , in a matter of three or four months , to be so ripped @-@ everything was happening so quickly . " 
 The video features a chiseled and muscular D 'Angelo , wearing a small gold @-@ chained crucifix necklace , lip @-@ synching while filmed on a platform from the waist @-@ up and appearing nude ; he was wearing a pair of pajama bottoms during filming , which were not visible in the video as they were hung low away from the camera 's view . Trenier later explained the idea of D 'Angelo appearing alone , stating " We didn 't want an on @-@ screen love interest . We wanted him to be able to make contact with whoever was watching it one @-@ on @-@ one " . Consisting of entirely one shot , the music video begins with the camera opening on the back of D 'Angelo 's head before rotating to the front and drawing back to a larger view of his upper torso , as he begins to lip @-@ synch to the track , set to an all @-@ black background . It continues with camera close @-@ ups of sweat trickling from his tattooed arms , chiseled chest and abdominal muscles , while also flirting with a peak of his shadowed , muscular hip . The video leads to D 'Angelo making emotional gestures as he lip @-@ synchs to the choral climax and the end of the song . 
 = = = Interpretations = = = 
 Music writers offered various interpretations of the video 's style and concept . David Peisner of Spin wrote of the close @-@ ups featured in the music video , " As the camera sucks him in , it feels intimate and intrusive , revealing and voyeuristic " . Music critic Jim Farber commented that D 'Angelo 's torso " sways in grinding rhythm , <unk> and releasing as his mouth curls in pleasure and his eyebrows narrow to measure an ecstatic contraction " , while claiming that the video has " nothing but close @-@ ups of D 'Angelo 's buff body on the apparent receiving end of one of life 's great payoffs " . In his essay " ' Untitled ' : D 'Angelo and the Visualization of the Black Male Body " for his 1999 Wide Angle journal , journalist Keith M. Harris interprets the video to be a portrayal of D 'Angelo 's " discursive play with masculinity and blackness " . In his review of D 'Angelo 's Voodoo , Mark Anthony Neal of PopMatters wrote of the video in contrast to most music videos in R & B and hip hop at the time , stating " One could call the video for ' Untitled ( How Does it Feel ) ' narcissistic , but in an era when most R & B videos are nothing but ' bling , bling ' and booty , D 'Angelo 's bare naked torso was refreshing " . On the video 's camera range and angle , Stephen Hill , a senior vice president for BET , had stated " It stopped just north of the line where , you know , we would have had issues " . A 2008 press release for D 'Angelo described the music video as " featuring D 'Angelo as a shirtless Adonis that catapulted him into the stratosphere and firmly cemented his place as the reigning King of Soul . "

 The music video gained a significant amount of airplay on the BET and MTV networks , as it increased mainstream notice and appeal of D 'Angelo upon the release of Voodoo in January 2000 . Viewer response to the " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " music video was largely divided along sexual lines , as female viewers generally expressed favor to the video . Additionally , D 'Angelo 's video appearance , including a notable amount of sweating around his abdomen , contributed to rumors of him receiving oral sex in the video . For an April 2000 article for Vibe , Questlove interviewed D 'Angelo and asked him " Are you getting head in that video ? " , after which D 'Angelo responded by laughing . Questlove then asked " So you 're not going to answer that ? " , and D 'Angelo responded , " No " . In her response to the video , television personality Star Jones said that , " D 'Angelo is singing about being intimate with a woman that he loves , and it 's just basic voice and body , and when you 're in an intimate situation with a man , that 's really all that 's there — the voice and the body and the light hitting the body in a way that makes you know that this is your man " . Danyel Smith , editor for Time Inc. at the time , said " It 's so sexy . It 's about time that girls had something luscious to look at while they 're listening to a song . For years , men have been treated to breasts and butts along with their favorite songs , and women have had to just sit there and endure . " In an interview for The New York Times , Smith also said that she had encountered an appreciative reaction among women to the adult sexuality of the music video . She continued , recalling her experience at a salon where the video was viewed , stating : 
 Despite general favor from female viewers ' perspective , reaction from most male viewers was negative . The music video was presented to a crowd during a promotional party at the Chelsea nightclub Centro @-@ Fly , thrown in celebration of Voodoo 's January 2000 release . According to a New York Times correspondent , one female viewer at the party " recalled sitting at home , staring at the video , while her boyfriend snapped , ' Turn the channel — I don 't want to see that gay stuff ' " . D 'Angelo made an appearance at the WQHT Hot 97 studio as the DJ 's Angie Martinez and Funkmaster Flex fielded calls from listeners about the video . Tracy <unk> , program director for the radio station at the time , later commented on the divided reaction to the music video in an interview for The New York Times in 2000 , stating " Of course , most of the women loved it . Some of the men said things like : ' We don 't wanna see that kind of stuff . Why do we have to look at that ? ' Men definitely seem to be threatened by male nudity " . Some viewers and music writers have attributed the male discomfort of the video to fear of male sexual objectification and homophobia . In a 2000 phone interview for The New York Times , D 'Angelo maintained a neutral attitude towards general viewer opinion of the video , stating " With men , if there 's any negative reaction , I 'm not really going to get an honest feedback ... women love it , most definitely . But for me personally , the response I 've got from both men and women has been pretty cool " . 
 = = = Critical response = = = 
 Critical opinion of the music video was generally favorable . Entertainment Weekly 's columnist Jim Farber gave the music video an A rating , and called the close @-@ ups of D 'Angelo 's physique a " measure of the video 's smarm @-@ free joy that even though the camera puts the viewer in the pleasure @-@ giving position , we feel in no way manipulated or debased " . Farber also lauded the video 's depiction of sexuality , stating " it feels like a privilege to be part of such a comfortable act of carnality . Was it good for you , too ? " . A columnist for Billboard magazine shared a similar sentiment about the video , writing that " it 's pure sexuality . D 'Angelo , muscularly cut and glistening , is shot from the hips up , naked , with just enough shown to prompt a slow burning desire in most any woman who sees it . The video alone could make the song one of the biggest of the coming year " . However , David Thigpen of Time magazine criticized the vanity of the video , stating " It 's a good song , but I thought he was preening pretty heavily in the video " . Thigpen also compared it to the music video for singer @-@ songwriter Alanis Morissette 's " Thank U " ( 1998 ) , which features Morissette appearing nude , and stated " Nakedness is usually an expression of vulnerability — that was the point of the Alanis Morissette video . But in this case , it 's really about power , an in @-@ your @-@ face form of masculinity " . Douglas Century of The New York Times called it " the most controversial music video to air in years " , and favored the video 's unconventional concept , writing that " ' Untitled ' breaks a long @-@ established pattern in hip @-@ hop and R & B videos in which male artists are often dressed in roughneck gear — baggy jeans , Timberland boots and baseball caps — surrounded by shimmying women in thong bikinis " . 
 On September 7 , 2000 , the video earned four VMA nominations at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards , which included MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year , Best Male Video , Best R & B Video , and Best Direction . In 2001 , the video was ranked number 44 on VH1 's list of the 100 Greatest Videos . The website UGO later selected it for its list of the Top 50 Sexiest Music Videos . The digital television MTV Base named " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " number 18 on its list of the Top 100 Greatest Music Videos Ever . In selecting the video for its list of the 100 Awesome Music Videos , Pitchfork Media staff reviewer Amy Phillips wrote of the music video , stating " Every time a man that fine gets naked on TV , we 're one step closer to world peace . "

 The success of the video proved to contribute significantly to the album 's commercial performance , as Voodoo had initially struggled to gain single @-@ oriented success prior to the video . The commercial impact of the video and its heavy rotation on music video networks , however , lead to D 'Angelo 's building image as a sex icon to a younger generation of music fans . Despite the publicity surrounding Voodoo being escalated by the video 's appeal , the appeal of the album was almost overshadowed , commercially , by the video . The video 's success also lead to mounting frustrations during the supporting tour for Voodoo , during which female fans and audience members would yell out for D 'Angelo to take his clothes off on stage . Dominique Trenier , who served as D 'Angelo 's manager from 1996 to 2005 , later explained his disappointment of the music video 's effect on D 'Angelo , stating " to this day , in the general populace 's memory , he 's the naked dude " . 
 Many of D 'Angelo 's peers have noted the success of the " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " music video as a contributing factor to his period of absence from the music scene and solo work , as well as his legal controversies and drinking issues following the tour . A columnist for <unk> has cited the video as the " jump @-@ the @-@ shark moment " for D 'Angelo , and stated " It was so provocative and polarizing that no one could recover from it , least of all him " . Ahmir " Questlove " Thompson , who served as producer for Voodoo and musical director for " The Voodoo Tour " , discussed the music video 's impact on D 'Angelo in a 2003 interview with music journalist Touré , stating " he wants is to get fat . He doesn ’ t want his <unk> braiding every nook and cranny of his hair . He doesn ’ t wanna have to have ripples in his stomach . He doesn ’ t want the pressure of being ' Untitled ' the video " . Questlove ended by stating " Had he known what the repercussions of ' Untitled ' would 've been , I don ’ t think he would 've done it " . 
 In February 2016 , singer Jason Derulo released the video for his song " Naked " . It features his naked torso reminiscent of D 'Angelo 's appearance in " Untitled ( How Does It Feel ) " .

 = Wynton Kelly = 
 Wynton Charles Kelly ( December 2 , 1931 – April 12 , 1971 ) was a Jamaican American jazz pianist and composer . He is known for his lively , blues @-@ based playing and as one of the finest accompanists in jazz . He began playing professionally at the age of 12 , and was pianist on a No. 1 R & B hit at the age of 16 . His recording debut as leader occurred three years later , around the time he started to become better known as accompanist to singer Dinah Washington , and as a member of trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie 's band . This progress was interrupted by two years in the army , after which Kelly returned to Washington and Gillespie , and played with other leaders . Over the next few years , these included instrumentalists Julian " Cannonball " Adderley , John Coltrane , Roland Kirk , Wes Montgomery , and Sonny Rollins , and vocalists Betty Carter , Billie Holiday , and Abbey Lincoln . 
 Kelly attracted the most attention as part of Miles Davis ' band from 1959 , including an appearance on the trumpeter 's Kind of Blue , often mentioned as the best @-@ selling jazz album ever . After leaving Davis in 1963 , Kelly played with his own trio , which recorded for several labels and toured the United States and internationally . His career did not develop much further , and he had difficulty finding enough work late in his career . Kelly , who was prone to epilepsy , died in a hotel room in Canada following a seizure , aged 39 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 The son of Jamaican immigrants , Kelly was born in Brooklyn , New York , on December 2 , 1931 . He began playing the piano at the age of four , but did not receive much formal training in music . He attended The High School of Music & Art and the Metropolitan Vocational High School in New York , but " They wouldn 't give us piano , so I fooled around with the bass and studied theory . " 
 Kelly started his professional career in 1943 , initially as a member of R & B groups . Through this , he improved his playing – the bands ' " music had to be accessible , entertaining and easy to dance to " ; this influenced his later playing . Around this time he also played organ in local churches . In his local area , he played with brothers Lee and Ray Abrams , as well as Ahmed Abdul @-@ Malik , Ernie Henry , and Cecil Payne , who went on to have careers in jazz . 
 = = Main career = = 
 = = = 1946 – 58 = = = 
 At the age of 15 , Kelly toured the Caribbean as part of Ray Abrams ' R & B band . Kelly made his recording debut aged 16 , playing on saxophonist Hal Singer 's 1948 " <unk> " , which became a Billboard R & B chart @-@ topping hit . In the following year , Kelly recorded with vocalist Babs Gonzales ; these tracks included his first recorded solos . Other R & B bands that Kelly played with included those led by Hot Lips Page ( 1948 or earlier ) , Eddie " <unk> " Vinson ( 1949 ) , and Eddie " <unk> " Davis ( 1950 ) . Material from sessions on July 25 and August 1 , 1951 formed Piano Interpretations , a trio album that was Kelly 's recording debut as leader , released by Blue Note Records later that year . Critic Scott Yanow indicates that , at this stage of his career , Kelly 's main influence was Bud Powell , but that his playing " displayed some of the joy of Teddy Wilson 's style along with his own chord voicings " . Kelly became better known after joining vocalist Dinah Washington 's band in 1951 . After this , he played in bands led by Lester Young in the spring of 1952 , and Dizzy Gillespie , recording with the latter later in 1952 . In September of that year , just as Kelly was beginning to build a reputation , he was drafted into the army . 
 After a period at Fort McClellan in Alabama , Kelly was part of a Third Army traveling show . He recruited fellow draftee and future jazz pianist Duke Pearson into the show ; together they were able to convince their unit to involve more black musicians , as they were initially the only two out of around two dozen performers . By April 1954 Kelly was " Private First Class Wynton Kelly " , musical director of the show . He ended his military service with a music performance for an audience of 10 @,@ 000 in the Chastain Memorial Park Amphitheater in Atlanta . 
 Kelly was released from the military after two years , following which he worked on and off with Washington and Gillespie again . Kelly was also part of Charles Mingus ' group for a tour of Washington , D.C. , California , and Vancouver in late 1956 to early 1957 . He left Mingus to rejoin Gillespie , who led a big band that toured Canada and the southern United States . Commenting on Kelly 's ability to move from a small group to a big band setting , saxophonist Benny Golson , also from Gillespie 's band , said that " He kept his identity ; yet he was able to add something to the band , not only melodically ( which he was known for ) but rhythmically . He would set up patterns – never interfering with the arrangement , but he was able to get into the cracks and he would always be adding something , giving it impetus , more energy . " In 1956 , Kelly recorded with vocalist Billie Holiday , including for the original version of her song " Lady Sings the Blues " , as well as for the Blue Note debuts of saxophonists Johnny Griffin and Sonny Rollins . After leaving Gillespie again , Kelly formed his own trio . 
 Kelly was much in demand as a sideman for recordings , and appeared on albums by most of the major jazz leaders in the late 1950s and early 1960s . In April 1957 , for instance , he appeared as a guest in an enlarged version of Art Blakey 's Jazz Messengers , for an album later released as Theory of Art ; this band included trumpeter Lee Morgan , with whom Kelly had recorded a few weeks earlier . The recording sessions continued four days later , with Kelly joining Blakey , Morgan and others on Griffin 's A Blowin ' Session ; this was followed by three studio days for Gillespie , and another for trumpeter Clark Terry , before the end of the month . Later that year , Kelly made a rare appearance playing bass , for one track of vocalist Abbey Lincoln 's That 's Him ! , after the regular bassist , Paul Chambers , became drunk and fell asleep in the studio . 
 Early in 1958 , Kelly recorded his second album as leader , the quartet Piano , more than six years after his first . In the same year , he played for recordings led by , among others , vocalist Betty Carter , and made the first of several appearances on albums led by Julian " Cannonball " Adderley , Blue Mitchell , and Hank Mobley . Kelly also played organ on one track of Pepper Adams and Jimmy Knepper 's The Pepper @-@ Knepper Quintet , an unusual departure from his usual instrument . 
 = = = 1959 – 71 = = = 
 In January 1959 , Kelly joined the musician with whom he became most associated – Miles Davis . Adderley , the alto saxophonist in the band , related how Kelly came to replace Red Garland on piano : Davis had admired Kelly 's playing as part of Gillespie 's band , and Garland was invariably late to arrive for their club performances ; " One night , Wynton was there when we started and Miles asked him to sit in . When Red came , Wynton was playing . Miles told Red , ' Wynton 's got the gig . ' Just like that . " Kelly stayed with the trumpeter until March 1963 , appearing on the studio albums Kind of Blue and Someday My Prince Will Come , as well as on numerous concert recordings . On 1959 's Kind of Blue , often mentioned as the best @-@ selling jazz album ever , Kelly replaced Bill Evans on the track " Freddie Freeloader " . Even though Kelly was Davis ' regular pianist , the trumpeter had planned his album with Evans in mind , so this was the only piece that Kelly played . Kelly toured 22 cities in Europe as part of Davis ' quintet in the spring of 1960 . Fellow pianist McCoy Tyner commented on Kelly 's playing with Davis : " His harmonic colorations were very beautiful . But I think above all it was his ability to swing . John [ Coltrane ] used to mention that . Miles used to get off the bandstand and just look at Wynton with admiration , because he really held the group together . " 
 Davis often left considerable time between band engagements , which allowed the musicians to do other work , so Kelly continued to record with other leaders , including with other members of the Davis band . In February 1959 , when in Chicago for performances with Davis , Kelly was pianist on Cannonball Adderley Quintet in Chicago , and bassist Chambers ' Go . Later that year , Kelly made his first album for Vee @-@ Jay Records , in a quintet containing Wayne Shorter ; Kelly returned the favor a few months later by playing on the saxophonist 's debut as leader , Introducing Wayne Shorter . Kelly also recorded with Coltrane , including for one track , " Naima " , from the saxophonist 's Giant Steps . When Adderley left Davis , he attempted to recruit Kelly ; although the pianist declined , he did participate in more recording sessions led by his former bandmate , as well as more with Griffin , Mobley , Morgan , and numerous others . Kelly made his first recording with guitarist Wes Montgomery in 1961 ; they then made Full House the next year ; the pairing was described by The Penguin Guide to Jazz as " an association that promised a lot and delivered more " . 
 When he left Davis , Kelly formed his own trio with two others leaving the trumpeter – Chambers and drummer Jimmy Cobb . They soon embarked on a national tour and had recording dates with Verve Records , Kelly having left Vee @-@ Jay after four albums . In May 1964 , the calypso track " Little Tracy " from Kelly 's Verve album Comin ' in the Back Door reached number 38 on Billboard 's R & B chart . A few months later , the trio toured Japan for George Wein @-@ organized concerts . In the summer of 1965 they joined Montgomery on a tour of the US that included an appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival , and a club recording released as the Kelly co @-@ led Smokin ' at the Half Note . The trio also played together on albums for Joe Henderson and others after leaving Davis . According to Cobb , he took charge of the financial side of the trio , as well as its recruiting of additional members , while Kelly primarily was pianist and responsible for dealing with interviewers . The trio stayed together until 1969 , when Chambers died . 
 Towards the end of his career , Kelly had problems finding work , but played with Ray Nance , and as a soloist in New York . Kelly 's final recording session appears to have been in the autumn of 1970 , accompanying saxophonist Dexter Gordon . 
 = = Death = = 
 Kelly died in Toronto , Canada , following an epileptic seizure , on April 12 , 1971 . He had travelled there from New York to play in a club with drummer George Reed and vocalist Herb Marshall . Kelly had a longstanding epilepsy problem , and had to monitor his condition carefully . An account of his death was given by his friend , Cobb : " Wynton called his girlfriend in New York and said , ' You know , I don 't feel good . ' She said , ' Why don 't you go downstairs to the bar and if something happens somebody could tend to you . ' We don 't know if he did that , because when they found him he was in the room . " Kelly was found in his room in the Westminster Hotel on Jarvis Street by Marshall . He was reported to have had almost no money at the time of his death . A memorial concert was held on June 28 in New York and featured numerous well @-@ known musicians of the period . 
 = = Personal life and personality = = 
 Kelly was survived by a daughter , Tracy . Bassist Marcus Miller is a cousin of Kelly 's , as are rapper Foxy Brown , and pianist Randy Weston . 
 Kelly drank a lot ; saxophonist Jimmy Heath described him as " an alcoholic " who " could control his drinking " and not let his playing be affected by it . Kelly was known " for being a very warm , generous human being " . Bassist Bill Crow reported that Kelly was " full of fun " : " He was often the center of backstage laughing sessions as we told stories on each other . Wynton had a removable upper front denture . While on stage , if he saw some of us standing in the wings listening , he would turn around so the audience couldn 't see , give us a stern look , and drop his upper plate forward onto his lower lip , creating a grotesquely comical effect . Sometimes he heightened it by sticking his tongue out at us over his upper teeth . " 
 = = Playing style = = 
 Kelly played " with a crisp , leaping rhythmic blues approach that generated intense excitement " , wrote The Washington Post 's obituarist . The happiness conveyed in his playing was described by Cobb : " It 's happy sounding all the time . It 's got a West Indian kind of hop to it . Always sparkling " . The Rough Guide to Jazz stated that Kelly " combined <unk> lines and bluesy interpolations , but with a taut sense of timing quite unlike anyone else except his many imitators " , and highlighted the effectiveness of his block chords in contributing to a " dynamic and driving accompanying style " . 
 Kelly was an excellent sight reader , and could remember parts very quickly , as well as play pieces he had heard but not read before . 
 Several commentators have rated Kelly the best accompanist in jazz , including critic Ray Comiskey and music educator Mark Levine . Drummer Philly Joe Jones said that , as an accompanist , Kelly " puts down flowers behind a soloist . He never wanted to steal in . He just put together the right things . " Pianist Bruce Barth pointed out that part of Kelly 's success as an accompanist came from " occasional and compelling use of ' blues licks ' and melodic phrases in place of chords . " 
 = = Legacy and influence = = 
 In critic Gary Giddins ' view , 
 Kelly was never able to exploit his gifts when he went out on his own . His quartet with Wes Montgomery should have developed into a major force , but the same commercial interests that shanghaied Montgomery saddled Kelly with the fashionable soul @-@ funk of the mid- ' 60s . Unlike Montgomery , his career went nowhere , and he didn 't live long enough to find himself again . 
 Writer David Rosenthal commented that " Kelly seemed unable to escape being typecast as a sideman " . 
 Kelly 's style of playing has been an influence on numerous pianists , beginning in the 1960s . Among those to cite him directly as an influence are Monty Alexander , Chick Corea , Brad Mehldau , and Chucho Valdés . Pianists Dan Nimmer and Willie Pickens have recorded tribute albums to Kelly . 
 Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis ( born 1961 ) was named after Kelly .

 In 1927 , the Classical Revival Style building was built by local businessman Frank R. Strong as a B. H. Dyas Company Department Store . The construction , which continued into 1928 , marked the first department store branch outside of the main Downtown Los Angeles central business district and led to similar large @-@ scale commercial developments outside downtown . Due to the Great Depression , B. H. Dyas had to consolidate its operation back to its original store and The Broadway purchased the 30 @-@ year lease for this prime location for $ 2 million ( US $ 31 @.@ 1 million in 2016 dollars ) in 1931 . The Broadway Hollywood Building quickly found its niche by serving the Hollywood 's film and finance industries demand for high end products . 
 With the store 's profits , it was able to expand in 1938 with 52 @,@ 000 square feet ( 4 @,@ 800 m2 ) of retail space .

 = Lech Wałęsa = 
 Lech Wałęsa ( / <unk> <unk> / or / <unk> / ; Polish : [ <unk> <unk> ̃ sa ] ; born 29 September 1943 ) is a retired Polish politician and labor activist . He co @-@ founded and headed Solidarity ( Solidarność ) , the Soviet bloc 's first independent trade union , won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 , and served as President of Poland from 1990 to 1995 . 
 Wałęsa was an electrician by trade . Soon after beginning work at Lenin Shipyard ( now Gdańsk Shipyard ) , he became a trade union activist , for which he was persecuted by the Communist authorities , placed under surveillance , fired in 1976 , and arrested several times . In August 1980 he was instrumental in political negotiations that led to the ground @-@ breaking Gdańsk Agreement between striking workers and the government . He became a co @-@ founder of the Solidarity trade union movement . After martial law was imposed in Poland and Solidarity was outlawed , Wałęsa was arrested again . Upon his release from custody he continued his activism and was prominent in the establishment of the 1989 Round Table Agreement that led to semi @-@ free parliamentary elections in June 1989 , and to a Solidarity @-@ led government . 
 In the Polish general election of 1990 , Wałęsa successfully ran for the newly re @-@ established office of President of Poland . He presided over Poland 's transition from communism to a post @-@ communist state , but his popularity waned and his role in Polish politics diminished after he narrowly lost the 1995 presidential election . As of 2016 , Wałęsa continues to speak and lecture on history and politics in Poland and abroad . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Wałęsa was born in <unk> , German @-@ occupied Poland . His father , Bolesław Wałęsa ( 1908 – 1945 ) , was a carpenter who was rounded up and interned in a forced labor camp at <unk> ( outpost of KL <unk> ) by the German occupying forces before Lech was born . Bolesław returned home after the war but died two months later from exhaustion and illness shortly before his 34th birthday . Lech 's mother , Feliksa Wałęsa ( née <unk> ; 1916 – 1975 ) , has been credited with shaping her son 's beliefs and tenacity . 
 When Lech was nine , Feliksa married her brother @-@ in @-@ law , Stanisław Wałęsa ( 1916 – 1981 ) , a farmer . Lech had three elder full siblings ; Izabela ( 1934 – 2012 ) , Edward ( <unk> ) , and Stanisław ( <unk> ) ; and three younger half @-@ brothers ; Tadeusz ( <unk> ) , Zygmunt ( <unk> ) , and Wojciech ( 1951 – 1988 ) . In 1973 Lech 's mother and stepfather emigrated to the US for economic reasons . They lived in Jersey City , where Feliksa died in a car accident in 1975 and Stanisław died of a heart attack in 1981 . Both of them were buried in Poland . 
 In 1961 Lech graduated from primary and vocational school in nearby <unk> and <unk> as a qualified electrician . He worked as a car mechanic from 1961 to 1965 , and then embarked on his two @-@ year , obligatory military service , attaining the rank of corporal before beginning work on 12 July 1967 as an electrician at Lenin Shipyard ( <unk> <unk> im . <unk> ) , now called Gdańsk Shipyard ( <unk> <unk> ) in Gdańsk . 
 On 8 November 1969 Wałęsa married Danuta <unk> . The couple have eight children ; Bogdan , Sławomir , Przemysław , Jarosław , Magdalena , Anna , Maria @-@ <unk> , and <unk> . As of 2016 , Anna is running her father 's office in Gdańsk and Jarosław is a European MP . 
 In 2008 Wałęsa underwent a coronary artery stent placement and the implantation of a cardiac pacemaker at Houston Methodist Hospital in the US . 
 = = Solidarity movement = = 
 From early in his career , Wałęsa was interested in workers ' concerns ; in 1968 he encouraged shipyard colleagues to boycott official rallies that condemned recent student strikes . He was a charismatic leader , who helped organize the illegal 1970 strikes at the Gdańsk Shipyard when workers protested the government 's decree raising food prices and he was considered for the position of chairman of the strike committee . The strikes ' outcome , which involved the deaths of over 30 workers , galvanized Wałęsa 's views on the need for change . In June 1976 , Wałęsa lost his job at the Gdańsk Shipyard because of his continued involvement in illegal unions , strikes , and a campaign to commemorate the victims of the 1970 protests . Afterwards he worked as an electrician for several other companies but his activism led to him continually being laid off and he was jobless for long periods . Wałęsa and his family were under constant surveillance by the Polish secret police ; his home and workplace were always bugged . Over the next few years , he was arrested several times for participating in dissident activities . 
 Wałęsa worked closely with the Workers ' Defense Committee ( KOR ) , a group that emerged to lend aid to people arrested after the 1976 labor strikes and to their families . In June 1978 he became an activist of the underground Free Trade Unions of the Coast ( Wolne <unk> <unk> <unk> ) . On 14 August 1980 , another rise in food prices led to a strike at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk , of which Wałęsa was one of the instigators . Wałęsa scaled the shipyard fence and quickly became one of the strike leaders . The strike inspired other similar strikes in Gdańsk , which then spread across Poland . Wałęsa headed the Inter @-@ Plant Strike Committee , coordinating the workers at Gdańsk and at 20 other plants in the region . On 31 August the government , represented by Mieczysław Jagielski , signed an accord ( the Gdańsk Agreement ) with the Strike Coordinating Committee . The agreement granted the Lenin Shipyard workers the right to strike and permitted them to form an independent trade union . The Strike Coordinating Committee legalized itself as the National Coordinating Committee of the Solidarność ( Solidarity ) Free Trade Union , and Wałęsa was chosen as chairman of the Committee . The Solidarity trade union quickly grew , ultimately claiming over 10 million members — more than a quarter of Poland 's population . Wałęsa 's role in the strike , in the negotiations , and in the newly formed independent trade union gained him fame on the international stage . 
 Wałęsa held his position until 13 December 1981 , when General Wojciech Jaruzelski declared martial law in Poland . Wałęsa and many other Solidarity leaders and activists were arrested ; he was incarcerated for 11 months until 14 November 1982 at <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ; eastern towns near the Soviet border . On 8 October 1982 Solidarity was outlawed . In 1983 Wałęsa applied to return to the Gdańsk Shipyard as an electrician . The same year , he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . He was unable to accept it himself , fearing Poland 's government would not let him back into the country . His wife Danuta accepted the prize on his behalf . 
 Through the mid @-@ 1980s , Wałęsa continued underground Solidarity @-@ related activities . Every issue of the leading underground weekly publication Tygodnik Mazowsze bore his motto , " Solidarity will not be divided or destroyed " . Following a 1986 amnesty for Solidarity activists , Wałęsa co @-@ founded the Provisional Council of NSZZ Solidarity ( Tymczasowa Rada NSZZ Solidarność ) , the first overt legal Solidarity entity since the declaration of martial law . From 1987 to 1990 , he organized and led the semi @-@ illegal Provisional Executive Committee of the Solidarity Trade Union . In mid @-@ 1988 he instigated work @-@ stoppage strikes at the Gdańsk Shipyard . 
 After months of strikes and political deliberations , at the conclusion of the 10th plenary session of the Polish United Workers ' Party ( PZPR , the Polish communist party ) , the government agreed to enter into Round Table Negotiations that lasted from February to April 1989 . Wałęsa was an informal leader of the non @-@ governmental side in the negotiations . During the talks , he traveled throughout Poland giving speeches in support of the negotiations . At the end of the talks , the government signed an agreement to re @-@ establish the Solidarity Trade Union and to organize semi @-@ free elections to the Polish parliament ; in accordance with the Round Table Agreement , only members of the Communist Party and its allies could stand for 65 percent of the seats in the lower house , the Sejm . 
 In December 1988 Wałęsa co @-@ founded the Solidarity Citizens ' Committee ; this was ostensibly an advisory body but in practice a political party that won the parliamentary elections in June 1989 . Solidarity took all the seats in the Sejm that were subject to free elections , and all but one seat in the newly re @-@ established Senate . Wałęsa was one of Solidarity 's most public figures ; he was an active campaigner , appearing on many campaign posters , but did not run for parliament himself . Solidarity winners in the Sejm elections were referred to as " Wałęsa 's team " or " Lech 's team " because they had all had appeared on their election posters with Wałęsa . 
 While ostensibly only chairman of Solidarity , Wałęsa played a key role in practical politics . In August 1989 he persuaded leaders of parties formerly allied with the Communist Party to form a non @-@ communist coalition government — the first non @-@ Communist government in the Soviet Bloc . The parliament elected Tadeusz Mazowiecki as the first non @-@ communist Prime Minister of Poland in over forty years . 
 = = Presidency = = 
 Following the June 1989 parliamentary elections , Wałęsa was disappointed some of his former fellow campaigners were satisfied to govern alongside former Communists . He decided to run for the newly re @-@ established office of president , using the slogan , " I don 't want to , but I 've got no choice " ( " Nie <unk> , ale <unk> . " ) . On 9 December 1990 Wałęsa won the presidential election , defeating Prime Minister Mazowiecki and other candidates to become the first freely elected president of Poland in 63 years , and the first non @-@ Communist president in 45 years . In 1993 he founded his own political party , the Nonpartisan Bloc for Support of Reforms ( BBWR ) ; the acronym echoed that of Józef Piłsudski 's " Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government , " of 1928 – 35 , likewise an ostensibly non @-@ political organization . 
 During his presidency , Wałęsa saw Poland through privatization and transition to a free @-@ market economy ( the Balcerowicz Plan ) , Poland 's 1991 first completely free parliamentary elections , and a period of redefinition of the country 's foreign relations . He successfully negotiated the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Poland and won a substantial reduction in foreign debts . 
 Wałęsa supported Poland 's entry into NATO and the European Union , both of which occurred after his presidency , in 1999 and 2004 , respectively . In the early 1990s he proposed the creation of a sub @-@ regional security system called NATO bis . The concept was supported by right @-@ wing and populist movements in Poland but garnered little support abroad ; Poland 's neighbors , some of which ( e.g. Lithuania ) , had recently regained independence and tended to see the proposal as Polish neo @-@ imperialism . 
 Wałęsa has been criticized for a confrontational style and for instigating " war at the top " , whereby former Solidarity allies clashed with one another , causing annual changes of government . This increasingly isolated Wałęsa on the political scene . As he lost political allies , he came to be surrounded by people who were viewed by the public as incompetent and disreputable . <unk> during election campaigns tarnished his reputation . Some thought Wałęsa , an ex @-@ electrician with no higher education , was too plain @-@ spoken and too undignified for the post of president . Others thought him too erratic in his views or complained he was too authoritarian and that he sought to strengthen his own power at the expense of the Sejm . Wałęsa 's national security advisor Jacek Merkel credited the shortcomings of Wałęsa 's presidency to his inability to comprehend the office of the president as an institution . He was an effective union leader capable of articulating what the workers felt but as president he had difficulty delegating power or navigating bureaucracy . Wałęsa 's problems were compounded by the difficult transition to a market economy ; in the long run it was seen as highly successful but it lost Wałęsa 's government much popular support . 
 Wałęsa 's BBWR performed poorly in the 1993 parliamentary elections ; at times his popular support dwindled to 10 percent and he narrowly lost the 1995 presidential election , winning 33 @.@ 11 percent of the vote in the first round and 48 @.@ 28 percent in the run @-@ off against Aleksander Kwaśniewski , who represented the resurgent Polish post @-@ Communists the Democratic Left Alliance ( SLD ) . Wałęsa 's fate was sealed by his poor handling of the media ; in televised debates he appeared incoherent and rude ; in response to Kwaśniewski 's extended hand at the end of the first of the two debates , he replied that the post @-@ Communist leader could " shake his leg " . After the election Wałęsa said he was going into " political retirement " and his role in politics became increasingly marginal . 
 = = Post @-@ presidency = = 
 After losing the 1995 election , Wałęsa announced he would return to work as an electrician at the Gdańsk Shipyard . Soon afterwards he changed his mind and chose to travel around the world on a lecture circuit . Wałęsa developed a portfolio of three lectures ( " The Impact of an Expanded NATO on Global Security " , " Democracy : The Never @-@ Ending Battle " and " Solidarity : The New Millennium " ) , and reads them at universities and public events with an appearance fee of around £ 50 @,@ 000 ( $ 70 @,@ 000 ) . 
 In 1995 he founded the Lech Wałęsa Institute , a think tank with a mission " to popularize the achievements of Polish Solidarity , educate young generations , promote democracy , and build civil society in Poland and around the world " . In 1997 he founded a new party , Christian Democracy of the 3rd Polish Republic , hoping it would help him to successfully run in future elections . 
 Wałęsa 's contention for the 2000 presidential election ended with a crushing defeat when he polled 1 @.@ 01 percent of the vote . His humiliation was increased because Aleksander Kwaśniewski , who was re @-@ elected in the first round with 54 percent of the vote , is a former Communist <unk> . Wałęsa polled in seventh place , after which he announced his withdrawal from Polish politics . 
 In 2006 Wałęsa quit Solidarity in protest of the union 's support of the ruling right @-@ wing Law and Justice party , and Lech and Jarosław Kaczyński — twin brothers who had been prominent in Solidarity and were now serving as the country ’ s president and prime minister , respectively . The main point of disagreement was the <unk> ’ focus on rooting out those who had been involved in communist rule and their party 's attempt to make public all the files of the former communist secret police . Until then only members of the government and parliament had to declare any connection with the former security services . Wałęsa and his supporters argued the so @-@ called transparency legislation advocated by the government might turn into a witch hunt and the more than 500 @,@ 000 Poles who had possibly collaborated with the communist secret police could face exposure . 
 Despite waning popularity at home , Wałęsa 's international reputation remained untouched . He continued his lecture circuit around the world , occasionally appearing in headlines . In 2014 in a widely publicized interview , Wałęsa expressed his disappointment in another Nobel laureate , US president Barack Obama : he told CNN , " When he was elected there was great hope in the world . We were hoping that Obama would reclaim moral leadership for America , but that failed ... in terms of politics and morality America no longer leads the world " . Wałęsa also accused Obama of not deserving his Nobel Peace Prize ; during the 2012 US presidential campaign he endorsed Obama 's opponent Mitt Romney . In September 2015 , Wałęsa again hit the headlines after sharing his thoughts on the migrant crisis in Europe with media , saying , " watching the refugees on television , I noticed that ... they are well fed , well dressed and maybe even are richer than we are ... If Europe opens its gates , soon millions will come through and while living among us will start exercising their own customs , including beheading " .

 Since the early 1980s there were accusations that Wałęsa had served as an informant for the communist security services in the 1970s , despite his vehement denials and the ruling of a special court in 2000 that cleared him of the allegations of collaboration . The controversy around those allegations resurfaced in 2008 with the publication of a book that purported to prove Wałęsa , using the code name Bolek , had been an operative for the security services from 1970 to 1976 . The issue resurfaced again in February 2016 when the Institute of National Remembrance seized materials from the widow of Czesław Kiszczak , a former minister of the interior , that were claimed to document Wałęsa ’ s role as a spy for the security services . 
 = = = Court ruling = = = 
 On 12 August 2000 , Wałęsa , who was running a presidential campaign at the time , was cleared by the special <unk> Court of charges that he collaborated with the Communist @-@ era secret services and reported on the activities of his fellow shipyard workers , due to the lack of evidence . Anti @-@ communists Piotr Naimski , one of the first members of the Workers ' Defense Committee that led to the Solidarity trade union , and Antoni Macierewicz , Wałęsa 's former Interior Minister , testified against him in the closed vetting trial . Naimski , who said he testified with a " heavy heart " , expressed his disappointment that Wałęsa " made a mistake by not going openly to the public , and he has missed an important chance " . According to Naimski , the court cleared Wałęsa on " technical grounds " because it did not find certain original documents — many of which had been destroyed since 1989 — offered sufficient proof that Wałęsa was lying . 
 In 1992 , Naimski , as a head of the State Protection Office , started the process of screening people suspected of being Communist collaborators in Poland . In June that year he helped Antoni Macierewicz prepare a list of 64 members of the government and parliament who were named as spies in the police records ; these included Wałęsa , then the Polish president . Wałęsa 's name was included on the list after a wrenching internal debate about the virtues of honesty versus political discretion . In response to the publication of this list , President Wałęsa immediately engineered the fall of prime minister Jan Olszewski and the dismissal of Interior Minister Macierewicz . A parliamentary committee later concluded Wałęsa had not signed an agreement with the secret police . 
 A 1997 Polish law made the vetting a requirement for those seeking high public office . According to the law , it is not a crime to have collaborated , but those who denies it and are found to have lied are banned from political life for ten years . The 2000 presidential election was the first use of this law . 
 Despite helping Wałęsa in 2005 to receive the official status of a " victim of communist regime " from the Institute of National Remembrance ( IPN ) , this court ruling did not convince many Poles . In November 2009 Wałęsa sued the president of Poland , Lech Kaczyński over his repeated collaboration allegations . Five months later , Kaczyński failed to invite Wałęsa to the commemoration service at Katyn , which arguably saved Wałęsa 's life because the presidential plane crashed , killing all on board . In August 2010 , Wałęsa lost a libel case against Krzysztof <unk> , his former fellow activist , who also publicly accused Wałęsa of being a communist agent in 1970s .

 The most comprehensive analysis of Wałęsa 's possible collaboration with secret police was provided in a 2008 book The SB ( Służba Bezpieczeństwa ; secret police ) and Lech Wałęsa : A Biographical Contribution ( SB a Lech Wałęsa . <unk> do <unk> ) . The book was written by two historians from the Institute of National Remembrance , Sławomir <unk> and Piotr <unk> , and included documents from the archives of the secret police that were inherited by the Institute . Among the documents were registration cards , memos , notes from the secret police , and reports from the informant . 
 The book 's authors said Wałęsa , working under the code name Bolek , was a secret police informant from 1970 ( after he was released from the arrest ) till 1976 ( before he was fired from the shipyard ) . According to them , " he wrote reports and informed on more than 20 people and some of them were persecuted by the communist police . He identified people and <unk> on his colleagues at work while they were listening to Radio Free Europe for example " . The book describes the fate of the seven of his alleged victims ; information regarding others was destroyed or stolen from the files . According to them , Wałęsa received over 13 @,@ 000 zlotys as remuneration for his services from the SB , while the monthly salary at the time was about 3 @,@ 500 zlotys . The authors said <unk> activity in Poland in the first half of 1970s was minimal and Wałęsa 's role in it was quite marginal . However , according to the book , despite formally renouncing his ties with SB in 1976 , Wałęsa went on to have contacts with communist officials . 
 The book also said that during his 1990 @-@ 1995 presidency , Wałęsa used his office to destroy the evidence of his collaboration with secret police by removing incriminating documents from the archives . According to the book , historians discovered that with the help of the state intelligence agency , Wałęsa , Interior Minister Andrzej <unk> , and other members of Wałęsa 's administration , had borrowed from the archives the secret police files that had connections to Wałęsa , and returned them with key pages removed . When it was discovered at the turn of 1995 / 96 , the following prosecutorial inquiry was discontinued for political reasons despite the case attracting much public attention . 
 Sławomir <unk> also said that in 1983 , when Wałęsa was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize , the secret police tried to embarrass him and leaked information about Wałęsa 's previous collaboration with the government . By this time though , Wałęsa was already so popular that most Poles did not believe the official media and dismissed the allegations as a manipulation by the Communist authorities . The book 's first print run sold out in Poland within hours . The book received substantial coverage in the media , provoked nationwide debate , and was noted by the international press . Wałęsa vowed to sue the authors but never did . 
 = = = Kiszczak archives = = = 
 On 18 February 2016 the INR in Warsaw announced it had seized a package of original documents that allegedly proved Wałęsa was a paid Communist informant . The documents dated from the period 1970 @-@ 1976 ; they were seized from the home of a recently deceased former interior minister , General Czesław Kiszczak . The documents ' authenticity was confirmed by an archival expert , but the handwriting examination demanded by the prosecutors could take up to six months . 
 The dossier consists of two folders ; a " personal file " containing 90 pages of documents , including a handwritten commitment to cooperate with the secret police dated 21 December 1970 , and signed Lech Wałęsa - Bolek with a pledge he would never admit his collaboration with secret police “ not even to family ” ; the file also contains the confirmations of having received <unk> and a " work file " contains 279 pages of documents , including numerous reports by Bolek on his co @-@ workers at Gdansk Shipyard , and notes by secret police officers from meetings with him . According to one note , Wałęsa agreed to collaborate out of fear of persecution after the workers ’ protest in 1970 . The documents also show that at first Bolek eagerly provided information on opinions and actions by his co @-@ workers and took money for the information , but his enthusiasm diminished and the quality of his information decreased until he was deemed no longer valuable and collaboration with him was terminated in 1976 . 
 The sealed dossier also contained a letter , hand @-@ written by Kiszczak in April 1996 , in which he informs the Director of the Polish Central Archives of Modern Records ( <unk> Akt <unk> ) about the accompanying files documenting the collaboration of Wałęsa with the Communist Security Service and asks him not to publish this information until five years after Wałęsa ’ s death . In his letter Kiszczak said he kept the documents out of reach : before the 1989 revolution , trying to protect Wałęsa ’ s reputation ; and afterwards to make sure they did not disappear or were used for political reasons . This letter and the accompanying documents had never been sent . 
 On 16 February 2016 , about three months after Kiszczak 's death , his widow Maria approached the Institute of National Remembrance and suggested selling it the archives for 90 @,@ 000 zlotys ( $ 23 @,@ 000 ) . However , according to the Polish law , all documents of political police must be handed in to the state . The administration of the institute notified the prosecutor 's office , which conducted a police search of the <unk> ' house and seized all the historic documents . Maria Kiszczak later said she had not read her husband ’ s letter and had " made a mistake " . 
 = = = Wałęsa 's response = = = 
 For years Wałęsa vehemently denied collaborating with the communist secret police and dismissed the incriminating files as forgeries created by the SB to compromise him . Wałęsa also denies that during his presidency he removed documents incriminating him from the archives . Until 2008 he denied having ever seen his secret police file . After the publication of the book SB a Lech Wałęsa in 2008 , he said that while he was president " I did borrow the file , but didn 't remove anything from it . I saw there were some documents there about me and that they were clearly forgeries . I told my secretaries to tape up and seal the file . I wrote ' don 't open ' on it . But someone didn 't obey , removed the papers , now casting suspicion on me . " Wałęsa 's interior minister Andrzej <unk> denied the cover @-@ up and said he " had the full legal right to make those documents available to President Wałęsa " and " no original documents were removed from the file " , which contained only photocopies . 
 Wałęsa has offered conflicting statements regarding the authenticity of the documents . Initially he has appeared to come close to an admission , saying in 1992 , " in December 1970 , I signed three or four documents " to escape from the secret police . In his 1987 autobiography A Way of Hope , Wałęsa said , " It is also the truth that I had not left that clash completely pure . They gave me a condition : signature ! And then I signed . " He denies he acted upon the collaboration agreement . However , in his later years Wałęsa said all the documents are forgeries and told BBC in 2008 , " you will not find any signature of mine agreeing to collaborate anywhere " . 
 In 2009 , after publication of another biography connecting him with the secret police ( Lech Walesa : Idea and History by Pawel <unk> ) , Wałęsa threatened to leave Poland if historians continue to question his past . He said that before revealing such information " a historian must decide whether this serves Poland " . After the accusations against him resurfaced with the discovery of the Kiszczak dossier on 16 February 2016 , Wałęsa called the files " lies , slander and forgeries " , and said he " never took money and never made any spoken or written report on anyone " . He said of the Polish public , which was about to believe in the allegations , " you have betrayed me , not me you " and " it was I who safely led Poland to a complete victory over communism " . On his blog on 20 February 2016 Wałęsa said in the 1970s a secret police officer begged him to sign the financial documents because this officer lost money handed to him to purchase a vehicle . Wałęsa appealed to this officer to step forward now and clear him of the accusations . 
 = = Religious and personal views = = 
 Wałęsa is a devout Roman Catholic Christian . He is a staunch opponent of abortion ; in 1993 during his presidency he signed a law restricting abortions in Poland . This law reversed the virtually free access to abortion that existed since 1956 and limited its use to cases in which the woman 's life is in danger , pregnancy has resulted from rape or incest , or the fetus is irreparably damaged . Doctors who violate the rules now face up to two years in prison . This abortion law is one of the most restrictive in Europe , deeply divided the country , and saw the former Solidarity coalition split between liberals and conservatives . The Polish Catholic Church supported Wałęsa , but public opinion polls indicated most Poles favored retaining a liberal abortion law ; 1 @.@ 3 million Poles signed a petition demanding a plebiscite rather than governmental imposition of the law . In 1994 a group of women legislators tried to ease the criteria for abortion ; Wałęsa vetoed their amendment . 
 Wałęsa is well known for his anti @-@ gay position . In 2013 he said on Polish television that homosexual people have no right to a prominent role in politics , " They have to know that they are a minority and must adjust to smaller things " . He also said homosexual MPs should sit " behind a wall " in a parliament . Despite sharp international criticism and a legal complaint of " propaganda of hate against a sexual minority " , Wałęsa refused to apologize for his comments . At a political rally in 2000 , he described gay people as " sick " and said , " I believe those people need medical treatment " . During the drawing up of a new Polish Constitution in 1995 , President Wałęsa argued against the inclusion of gay rights provisions . In 2014 City authorities of San Francisco renamed Walesa Street because of his " anti @-@ gay remarks " . A deputy speaker of the Polish Parliament said Wałęsa 's anti @-@ gay position could jeopardize his international career as a human rights speaker . 
 = = Honors = = 
 In 1983 Wałęsa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . Since then he has received more than 30 state decorations and more than 50 awards from 30 countries , including Order of the Bath ( UK ) , Order of Merit ( Germany ) , Legion of Honor ( France ) , and European Human Rights Prize ( EU 1989 ) . In 2011 he declined to accept the Lithuanian highest order , citing his displeasure at Lithuania 's policy towards the Polish diaspora . In 2008 he established the Lech Wałęsa Award . 
 In 2004 , Gdańsk International Airport was officially renamed Gdańsk Lech Wałęsa Airport and Wałęsa 's signature was incorporated into the airport 's logo . A college hall in Northeastern Illinois University ( Chicago ) , six streets , and five schools in Canada , France , Sweden and Poland also were named after Lech Wałęsa . 
 Wałęsa was named Man of the Year by Time magazine ( 1981 ) , Financial Times ( 1980 ) , Saudi Gazette ( 1989 ) and 12 other newspapers and magazines . He was awarded with over 45 honorary doctorates by universities around the world , including Harvard University and Sorbonne . He was named an honorary karate black belt by International Traditional Karate Federation . Wałęsa is also an honorary citizen of more than 30 cities , including London , Buffalo and Turin . 
 In the United States , Wałęsa was the first recipient of the Liberty Medal , in 1989 . That year he also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and became the first non @-@ head @-@ of @-@ state to address a joint meeting of the United States Congress . Wałęsa symbolically represented Europe by carrying the Olympic flag at the opening ceremony of the 2002 Winter Olympics . In 2004 , he represented ten newly acceded EU countries during the official accession ceremony in Strasbourg . In 1993 the heraldic authority of the Kingdom of Sweden assigned Wałęsa a personal coat of arms on the occasion of his admittance into the Royal Order of the Seraphim .

 Lech Wałęsa has been portrayed , as himself or a character based on him , in a number of feature films . The two most notable of them are : 
 Walesa . Man of Hope ( 2013 ) is a biographical drama by Oscar @-@ winning filmmaker Andrzej Wajda about the lives of Wałęsa ( Robert <unk> ) and his wife Danuta ( Agnieszka <unk> ) from 1970 to 1989 . It shows Wałęsa 's change from a shipyard worker into a charismatic labor leader . The film was shot in the historical locations of the depicted events , including the former Lenin Shipyard . It won three awards , including Silver Hugo for Robert <unk> at Chicago International Film Festival and a <unk> Award for Maria <unk> <unk> at Venice Film Festival , and was nominated for five more awards . 
 Man of Iron ( 1981 ) is another Andrzej Wajda film about the Solidarity movement . The main character , a young worker Maciej <unk> ( Jerzy Radziwiłowicz ) is involved in the anti @-@ Communist labor movement . <unk> is clearly portrayed as a parallel to Wałęsa , who appears as himself in the movie . The film was made during the brief relaxation of censorship in Poland between the formation of Solidarity in August 1980 and its suppression in December 1981 . <unk> was awarded both the Palme d 'Or and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the Cannes Film Festival for the film . In 1982 it was nominated for Oscar as the Best Foreign Language Film and gained seven other awards and nominations . 
 Both of these films were produced in Poland . In 1990 , Warner Bros intended to produce a " major " movie about Wałęsa in the US , with a $ 20 million budget and Robert De Niro starring as Wałęsa . The company paid Wałęsa a $ 1 million fee for the rights to produce a biopic . Although the movie was never made , this payment sparked controversy in Poland when five years later it emerged that Wałęsa concealed this income to avoid paying taxes on it . The Gdańsk tax office initiated a tax fraud case against Wałęsa but it was later dismissed because the five @-@ year statute of limitations had already run out . 
 In 1982 Bono was inspired by Wałęsa to write U2 's first hit single , " New Year 's Day " . Coincidentally , the Polish authorities lifted martial law on 1 January 1983 , the same day this single was released . Wałęsa also became a hero of a number of Polish pop songs , including a satirical 1991 hit titled Nie <unk> <unk> ( Don 't Trust the Electricians ) from the eponymous album by the punk rock band Big <unk> . 
 Patrick Dailly 's chamber opera Solidarity , starring Kristen Brown as Wałęsa , was premiered by the San Francisco Cabaret Opera in Berkeley , California , in September 2009 .

 = Abismo Negro = 
 Andrés Alejandro Palomeque González ( July 1 , 1971 – March 22 , 2009 ) was a Mexican Luchador ( Spanish for " masked professional wrestler " ) . He is best known for appearing under the stage name Abismo Negro , which is Spanish for " Black Abyss " or " black hole " , in the Asistencia Asesoría y Administración ( AAA ) promotion . Before appearing under the ring name Abismo Negro , Palomeque worked for five years under the alias " [ the ] Winners " and before that also wrestled as the characters " Alex Dinamo " , " <unk> Samurai " , and " Furor " for short periods . Palomeque owned and operated the Gimnasio Abismo Negro , a wrestling school where individuals were trained to become professional wrestlers . 
 In his professional wrestling career , Palomeque worked for the two most prominent professional wrestling promotions in Mexico : Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre ( CMLL ) and AAA . He also worked for the North American – based promotions the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ( TNA ) due to talent exchange programs between AAA and WWF in 1997 and TNA in 2004 , as well as making appearances for the Michinoku Pro and Pro Wrestling Noah promotions in Japan 
 On March 22 , 2009 , Palomeque was found dead in a river near El Rosario , Sinaloa ; the official cause of death was listed as drowning . On the night before , a wrestler using the Abismo Negro outfit worked an AAA show pretending to be Palomeque ; this incident caused the promoter to be barred from promoting shows for two years . Palomeque was inducted into the AAA Hall of Fame in June 2013 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Andrés Alejandro Palomeque González was born July 1 , 1971 in Villahermosa , Tabasco , Mexico . Palomeque started to get interested in professional wrestling at the age of nine when his father , Juan Francisco Palomeque Torres , took him to his first wrestling event . Later the Palomeque Family moved to Poza Rica where a young Palomeque took up Pentathlon ( long jump , high jump , 110 metres hurdles run , shot put , 1500 metres run ) in school . He and his brother , César Palomeque , had an interest in Martial Arts and trained together for years . When Palomeque was thirteen years old he began working in a gymnasium where professional wrestlers were trained , initially he paid for the use of the gymnasium by cleaning it after hours . When the family moved back to the Tabasco region he began training under Don <unk> Soto , who worked under the ring name El Noruego ( the Norwegian ) , and his brother <unk> Soto to become a luchador , or professional wrestler . Professional wrestlers perform in a non @-@ competitive sport based on simulated fighting with storylines written by creative teams and matches with predetermined results . Don Soto later recollects how he and his family took the young man in and made him part of their family , practically adopting him while he was enrolled in Soto 's wrestling school and later as he worked on the local wrestling circuit . Palomeque made his professional wrestling debut in 1987 , at the age of 16 , under the ring name " Alex Dinamo " . 
 = = Professional wrestling career = = 
 Palomeque received further training from famous Mexican wrestling coaches Diablo Velasco and Ray Mendoza before changing his character and ring name to " <unk> Samurai " — a masked persona patterned after the Japanese Samurai tradition . In 1991 , Palomeque began working for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre ( CMLL ; Spanish for " World Wrestling Council " ) , the biggest wrestling promotion in Mexico at that time . In CMLL , he worked as Furor , another masked ring persona . While working as Furor , Palomeque won his first Luchas de <unk> , or " bet match " when he defeated his mentor El Noruego in a match where Noruego 's hair and Palomeque 's mask was at stake . 
 = = = Winners = = = 
 In 1992 CMLL head writer Antonio Peña left the company to create his own wrestling promotion Asistencia Asesoría y Administración ( AAA ; Spanish for " Assistance , Consulting and Administration " ) promotion ; Palomeque was one of the many young wrestlers who left CMLL to work for the newly formed AAA . In AAA , his ring personal was changed and he became " Winners " ( sometimes written Winner 's ) , a fan favorite character ( known as a <unk> in Lucha Libre ) who wore a silver bodysuit and mask . <unk> work as " Winners " earned him a match on the very first Triplemanía where he teamed with Super Caló and El <unk> to defeat the team of May Flowers , Rudy Reyna , and Baby Sharon in a Six Man Tag Team match . The following year at Triplemanía II @-@ A he teamed up with Rey Misterio and Rey Misterio , Jr. to defeat the team known as Los <unk> ( Tony Arce , Vulcano , and Rocco Valente ) . In 1995 , Winners participated in a <unk> <unk> Tag Team match , in which the losing team members have a match of their own , with the loser of that encounter being forced to unmask . Winners team won the match , keeping him from having to defend his mask in a match . Eight days later at Triplemanía III @-@ B , Winners ' mask was on the line in a match against <unk> ; Winners defeated <unk> in a Luchas de Apuestas , Mask vs. Mask match . On June 30 , 1995 at Triplemanía III @-@ C , Winners participated in another " mask vs. mask " match , his third in three weeks . This time , Winners was not successful , as he lost to Super Caló and was forced to unmask . The loss of the mask did not hurt Winners ' popularity , on the contrary it intensified as the <unk> Palomeque became even more popular with the female fans . Despite losing his mask to Super Caló the two continued to work together as a team . On June 15 , 1996 , Winners and Caló teamed up with Rey Misterio , Jr. and Oro , Jr. to defeat the team of Perro Silva , Halloween , Kraken , and Mosco de la Merced at Triplemanía IV @-@ B. A month later , Winners , Caló , La Parka and El Mexicano defeated Jerry Estrada , Fishman , Villano IV , and May Flowers in one of the featured matches of Triplemanía IV @-@ C.

 In January 1997 , Palomeque 's character was changed from that of the quintessential heroic ladies ' man known as " Winners " , to that of a cheating villain ( referred to as a Rudo ) known as " Abismo Negro " . Part of his new routine as Abismo Negro was a flamethrower display , created by using a lighter and an Aerosol spray can . Palomeque would regularly use this during his entrance and on occasion during a match as when he worked as " Abismo Negro " character . As part of his Rudo act Palomeque began using the Marinete — a wrestling move known as a Piledriver where he simulates driving the top of his opponents ' head into the mat — the Marinete is " banned " Mexican wrestling , which means that it can lead to a disqualification if used during the match . The Marinete became such a signature move for the Abismo Negro character that he earned the nickname El Rey del Martinete ( The King of the Piledriver ) . He made his debut as Abismo Negro on January 10 , 1997 in an Eight Man Tag Team match . Shortly after his debut as Abismo Negro , he made his World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) debut on the January 19 , 1997 episode of the WWF Free For All pay @-@ per @-@ view event pre – show before the 1997 Royal Rumble . On the telecast , Negro teamed with Heavy Metal and Histeria in a losing effort against the team of Octagón , Blue Demon , Jr . , and Tinieblas , Jr. in a six @-@ man tag team match . This match was one of the early results of a working relationship between the WWF and AAA that had been created in late 1996 . The relationship saw Negro make an appearance in January against Perro Aguayo , Jr. and two appearances on the WWF 's primary television program Monday Night Raw in March 1997 . During his appearances in March , Negro was announced as being part of Los Vipers , a recently created alliance of wrestlers . After March , Negro did not make any more appearances for the WWF . 
 In AAA , Cibernético formed Los Vipers with Negro along with Psicosis ( II ) , Mosco De La Merced , <unk> and Histeria . Histeria was replaced a few weeks later by Histeria II . In 1998 , Negro acquired a " mascot " : a midget wrestler called Mini Abismo Negro . Abismo , Mini Abismo , and new Vipers member Electroshock were defeated by Octagón , his mascot <unk> , and Pentagón in a six @-@ man tag team match at Triplemanía . Los Vipers engaged in several scripted rivalries with other AAA groups , such as the group of masked wrestlers dressed as clowns known as Los <unk> . They also had a long @-@ running rivalry with Los Vatos Locos — consisting of Espiritu , <unk> , Nygma , May Flowers , and Silver Cat during the rivalry — over the Mexican National <unk> Championship . Los Vipers won the <unk> titles from Los Vatos on several occasions , but Negro was not part of the teams that won . Palomeque wrestling as Abismo Negro did capture a title of his own when he defeated Pentagón on May 19 , 1998 to win the Mexican National Middleweight Championship , a title he held until January 1999 . 
 In 1999 , Los Vipers split into two factions , with Abismo Negro leading a splinter group called Los Vipers Extreme consisting of Electroshock , Pentagón , <unk> , El Cuervo and Mini Abismo Negro while Cibernético created a group called Los Vipers Primera <unk> ( First Class Vipers ) . After less than two months , the angle was dropped and Los Vipers reunited . Not long after Los Vipers reunited , Cibernético formed a group called Lucha Libre Latina ( LLL ) , a group intent on taking over AAA that was inspired by World Championship Wrestling 's New World Order . Los Vipers became a subgroup within LLL , and Negro assumed leadership of Los Vipers . On May 2 , 1999 , Negro and Electroshock teamed up to defeat Perro Aguayo and Perro Aguayo , Jr. to win the Mexican National Tag Team Championship . Los Vipers held the tag team title for four months before losing it to the team of Haytor and the Panther . 
 In 2000 , Palomeque participated in a AAA tour of Japan and competed at Triplemanía VIII , where he was on the losing side of an eight @-@ man tag team match main event ; Negro teamed with Cibernetico , <unk> Nobunaga and Electro Shock against Octagón , Jushin Thunder Liger , Latin Lover and <unk> . While touring with AAA , <unk> also made an appearance at Michinoku Pro 's April 9 Sumo Hall card , where he defeated Oriental . On May 7 , Abismo Negro and Electroshock regained the Mexican National Tag Team title by defeating Haytor and the Panther but only held on to the title for two months before losing it to Héctor Garza and Perro Aguayo , Jr . 
 Negro became one of the driving forces in LLL 's feud with AAA owner Antonio Peña and his AAA loyalists . Over the years , Negro feuded with the top técnicos of AAA such as La Parka , Jr . , Octagón and Latin Lover . Negro 's position as one of AAA 's top workers was cemented on March 5 , 2000 when he competed in AAA 's annual Rey de Reyes tournament . In the opening round , he defeated Dos Caras , Killer and Psicosis II and in the finals , he defeated El Alebrije , Charly Manson and Cibernético to win the 2000 Rey de Reyes tournament . Negro 's status as a main eventer caused storyline problems between LLL 's leader Cibernético and Abismo Negro , leading to a series of matches between the two to see who should lead Los Vipers . On September 29 , 2000 , Negro defeated Cibernético in a one on one match at Verano de Escandalo ( 2000 ) . When the two faced off in a steel cage match at Guerra de Titanes ( 2000 ) , the match ended without a winner , after which the rivalry between the leader and the deputy leader was put on the back burner . In 2001 , Negro almost won Rey de Reyes again , but La Parka , Jr. defeated him in the finals . His string of losses continued at Triplemanía IX , where the LLL team of Abismo Negro , Cibernético , Electroshock and Mascara <unk> lost to Mascara Sagrada , El Alebrije , Octagón and La Parka , Jr. when Negro was forced to submit . 
 In 2000 Abismo Negro won the hair of the Panther in Lucha del reves match , a <unk> where two masked wrestlers put their hair on the line instead of their mask . On September 7 , 2001 Abismo Negro won another Lucha del reves match , defeating El Alebrije . In December 2002 , Negro and Mini Abismo Negro made it to the finals of a tournament to crown the first ever AAA Mascot Tag Team Champions but lost to Mascara Sagrada and Mascarita Sagrada . Negro qualified for the Rey de Reyes ( 2003 ) final , but La Parka , Jr. once again defeated him . In 2004 , LLL was phased out in favor of a new super group known as La Legión Extranjera or the Foreign Legion in English , which meant that Los Vipers now regularly teamed with foreign wrestlers , especially NWA @-@ TNA performers such as Abyss .

 In 2004 , TNA and AAA began a working relationship that saw TNA wrestlers work in Mexico and AAA wrestlers make several appearances on TNA 's weekly pay @-@ per @-@ views . Managed by AAA owner Antonio Peña , Palomeque , working as Abismo Negro , along with Héctor Garza , Juventud Guerrera , Mr. Águila , and later Heavy Metal , worked for TNA as Team AAA in the TNA 2004 America 's X Cup Tournament . The team made their debut on January 28 , 2004 at TNA Weekly pay @-@ per @-@ view event # 78 , defeating the team of Eric Young , Shark Boy , Matt Stryker and Chad Collyer . In the following weeks , Negro and Team AAA won against Elix Skipper , the team of Jerry Lynn and Sonjay Dutt and finally all of Team USA in a 4 on 4 match to claim the Americas X Cup . Four weeks later Team AAA successfully defended the X Cup against Team Canada , as Abismo Negro and Juventud Guerrera defeated the team of Teddy Hart and Jack Evans to tie the score between the two teams , allowing for a final four @-@ on @-@ four elimination match that Team AAA won . 
 Abismo Negro and the rest of Team AAA returned for the 2004 World X Cup Tournament where they now competed as " Team Mexico " . Abismo Negro remained undefeated until April 7 , 2004 when his team lost to James Mason and Jason Allgood in one of the first matches of the World X Cup Tournament . Later in the night , Team Mexico defeated Team UK to even the score . The World Cup saw Team Mexico lose to Team USA , Team Canada ( Eric Young and Bobby Roode ) , and Team Japan ( Ryuji Hijikata and Mitsu Hirai , Jr . ) . Team Mexico tied in points with Team USA and Team Canada , which meant that a representative of each team met in an Ultimate X match to determine the winner of the tournament . Héctor Garza represented Mexico , but in the end Team USA 's Chris Sabin won the match and the tournament . 
 = = = Return to AAA = = = 
 After the World X Cup tournament ended , Negro returned to AAA full @-@ time taking full charge of Los Vipers . In early 2005 , he was once again involved in the final match of that year 's Rey de Reyes , but La Parka , Jr. defeated him for the third time . AAA hinted at a possible técnico turn when Negro , along with Psicosis and Mini Psicosis , attacked Cibernético . The two faced off in a cage match , won by Cibernético , but they eventually reconciled their differences once more . At some point after 2005 Abismo Negro won the hair of Stuka , Jr. in a Lucha del reves match . Despite rumors that he was jumping to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre ( CMLL ) , Negro remained in AAA and was sent on a tour with Pro Wrestling Noah in the spring of 2006 . Later in the year , he finally turned técnico and began a sustained storyline with Cibernético and his group La Secta Cibernetica . The on again , off again storyline with Cibernético was put on hold when Cibernético suffered a severe knee injury in late 2006 . At some point during 2006 , Los Vipers left La Legión due to their " Anti @-@ Mexican " philosophy and began fighting La Legión and La Legión 's imported wrestlers . At Verano de Escandalo ( 2006 ) , Negro , Charly Manson , Electroshock and Histeria lost to Team TNA ( Homicide , Low Ki , Samoa Joe and A.J. Styles ) . 
 = = = Black Abyss = = = 
 In late 2007 , AAA created a ring persona for a new wrestler called Black Abyss ; the gimmick featured the same mask and attire as Negro and used a similar wrestling style to Negro as well . Initially , it was believed that this was done because there were rumors of him jumping to CMLL or to cover several no @-@ shows . In 2008 , Negro 's " almost winning " streak at Rey de Reyes continued as he lost in the final to El Zorro . Black Abyss made sure Negro did not win but interfering on Zorro 's behalf during the match , furthering the storyline between the two . During the fall of 2008 , AAA pushed the storyline further by having Black Abyss " injure " Negro with his own trademark move the " Martinete " . Abismo Negro was scheduled to take part in Triplemanía XVI in a match where he would face Los Vipers ( Psicosis , Histeria , Black Abyss and Mr. Niebla ) in a cage match , but in the weeks leading up to the show Abismo Negro suffered an injury and the match had to be cancelled , AAA used the attack at Rey de Reyes as a storyline explanation of why the match did not take place . At the 2008 Guerra de Titanes , Negro returned to challenge Los Vipers ' Revolution and specifically Black Abyss . Subsequently , the storyline between Negro and Black Abyss seemed to be building to a Luchas de Apuestas fight between the two , with their masks on the line . Both Abismo and Black Abyss were booked in the same four @-@ way elimination match qualifier at the Rey de Reyes ( 2009 ) event . Negro was able to eliminate Black Abyss from the match but was in turn eliminated by Latin Lover . Black Abyss still competed under the Black Abyss name , still as a rudo , but seemingly only a couple times on TV since then . Black Abyss has stated his wishes to continue with the character to honor the memory of Abismo Negro , but AAA didn 't shown a lot of interest in using it on TV . In October 2010 it was reported that Black Abyss had left AAA . 
 = = = Abismo Negro II = = = 
 On September 27 , 2011 , AAA announced the start of a competition to find a new Abismo Negro . In the end no one was chosen to take over the Abismo Negro character . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Palomeque was married to a woman named Martha for 15 years and the couple had four children , two girls and two boys . Palomeque 's wife has been suffering from breast cancer for a number of years . In 2008 , Palomeque had a relationship with Sexy Star after he had problems with his wife . 
 He often appeared on the morning television program Vida TV , in full wrestling gear and persona , billed as Abismo Negro . He usually appeared as a kind of judge for talent contests on the show earning him the nickname Fiscal De Hierro de la Televisión ( the Iron Judge of Television ) . Palomeque owned and operated " Gimnasio Abismo Negro " where he taught both professional wrestling and physical fitness . Graduates of Abismo Negro 's wrestling school include Independent wrestling workers El Intocable , <unk> and Mini Cibernético as well as AAA workers Sexy Star and Aero Star . Abismo Negro is a playable character in AAA 's first ever video game , AAA El <unk> . The Abismo Negro character was one of the first characters used to promote the game and show the quality of the graphic rendering . 
 = = Death = = 
 Palomeque was found dead on March 22 , 2009 . His body was found in a river near the town of El Rosario , Sinaloa . According to a bus driver who was transporting Palomeque and other passengers to Mexico City on Friday night March 20 , Palomeque became agitated , panicked and demanded to be let off the bus despite it being 1 : 30 in the morning . A text message he sent to his wife after leaving the bus confirms that Palomeque found himself lost on the dark hillside . After receiving the text message , his wife contacted local wrestling promoter Vicente Martinez , who organized a search party . On the morning of March 22 , Palomeque was found floating face down in the river . Afterwards , medical expert Jesús Enrique Castro López stated that such an anxiety attack could be steroid related , but Palomeque 's alleged steroid abuse has not been confirmed . An autopsy was carried out on March 23 , which determined that the cause of death was drowning , and no further investigation into the death is planned . A memorial was held in Mexico City on March 24 for friends and family of Palomeque , many of whom showed up without their masks on , to keep the focus of the event on Palomeque . His body was subsequently cremated , with the ashes taken to Villahermosa to be buried . 
 On Saturday March 21 , while Palomeque was either lost in the hills or already dead , someone worked as Abismo Negro on an AAA show in Cancun . In the past , the wrestler known as Black Abyss had worked as Abismo Negro when Palomeque failed to show , but this time Black Abyss was not the man behind the mask , as he was on the opposing team that night . Following the discovery of Palomeque 's body , the deception in Cancun received national coverage in Mexico and the local promoter responsible for the show , <unk> Martínez , was suspended for two years by the Benito <unk> Boxing and Wrestling commission . 
 On May 26 , 2009 AAA held the Torneo Abismo Negro in honor of Palomeque , the tournament was a 7 @-@ man gauntlet @-@ style match and included a mix of five AAA veterans and two Abismo Negro students . The participants were Cuervo , Black Abyss , Gato <unk> , Kemp Dragon , Joe <unk> , Extreme Tiger and <unk> . <unk> , Abismo Negro 's last student to turn professional , won the match after 48 minutes . The event was not televised and did not become an annual event . During Triplemania XVII there was a moment of silence in memory of Abismo Negro , Antonio Peña and <unk> Misawa ( Misawa had died the night before ) .

 = Cheetah = 
 The cheetah ( pronounced / <unk> / ) ( Acinonyx jubatus ) , also known as the hunting leopard , is a big cat that occurs mainly in eastern and southern Africa and a few parts of Iran . The only extant member of the genus Acinonyx , the cheetah was first described by Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1775 . The cheetah is characterised by a slender body , deep chest , spotted coat , a small rounded head , black tear @-@ like streaks on the face , long thin legs and a long spotted tail . Its lightly built , slender form is in sharp contrast with the robust build of the other big cats . The cheetah reaches nearly 70 to 90 cm ( 28 to 35 in ) at the shoulder , and weighs 21 – 72 kg ( 46 – 159 lb ) . Though taller than the leopard , it is notably smaller than the lion . Basically yellowish tan or rufous to greyish white , the coat is uniformly covered with nearly 2 @,@ 000 solid black spots . 
 Cheetah are active mainly during the day , with hunting its major activity . Adult males are sociable despite their territoriality , forming groups called " coalitions " . Females are not territorial ; they may be solitary or live with their offspring in home ranges . Carnivores , cheetah mainly prey upon antelopes and gazelles . They will stalk their prey to within 100 – 300 metres ( 330 – 980 ft ) , charge towards it and kill it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death . The cheetah 's body is specialised for speed ; it is the fastest land animal . The speed of a hunting cheetah averages 64 km / h ( 40 mph ) during a sprint ; the chase is interspersed with a few short bursts of speed , when the animal can clock 112 km / h ( 70 mph ) . Cheetahs are induced ovulators , breeding throughout the year . Gestation is nearly three months long , resulting in a litter of typically three to five cubs ( the number can vary from one to eight ) . Weaning occurs at six months ; siblings tend to stay together for some time . Cheetah cubs face higher mortality than most other mammals , especially in the Serengeti region . Cheetahs inhabit a variety of habitats – dry forests , scrub forests and savannahs . 
 Classified as vulnerable by the IUCN , the cheetah has suffered a substantial decline in its historic range due to rampant hunting in the 20th century . Several African countries have taken steps to improve the standards of cheetah conservation . Thanks to its prowess at hunting , the cheetah was tamed and used to kill game at hunts in the past . The animal has been widely depicted in art , literature , advertising and animation . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The vernacular name " cheetah " ( pronounced / <unk> @-@ tə / ) is derived from the Hindi word <unk> ( <unk> ) , which in turn comes from the Sanskrit word <unk> ् <unk> ( <unk> ) meaning " bright " or " variegated " . The first recorded use of this word was in 1610 . An alternative name for the cheetah is " hunting leopard " . The scientific name of the cheetah is Acinonyx jubatus . The generic name Acinonyx could have originated from the combination of two Greek words : <unk> means motionless , and onyx means claw . A rough translation of the word would be " non @-@ moving claws " , a reference to the limited <unk> ( capability of being drawn inside the paw ) of the claws of the cheetah relative to other cats ' . The specific name jubatus means " maned " in Latin , referring to the dorsal crest of this animal . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The cheetah is the only extant species of the genus Acinonyx . It is classified under the subfamily Felinae and family Felidae , the family that also includes large cats such as the lion , tiger and leopard . The species was first described by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in his 1775 publication Die <unk> in Abbildungen nach der Natur mit Beschreibungen . 
 The cheetah 's closest relatives are the cougar ( Puma concolor ) and the jaguarundi ( P. <unk> ) . These three species together form the Puma lineage , one of the eight lineages of Felidae . The sister group of the Puma lineage is a clade of smaller Old World cats that includes the genera Felis , <unk> and Prionailurus . 
 Although the cheetah is an African cat , molecular evidence indicates that the three species of the Puma lineage evolved in North America two to three million years ago , where they possibly had a common ancestor during the Miocene . They possibly diverged from this ancestor 8 @.@ 25 million years ago . The cheetah diverged from the puma and the jaguarundi around 6 @.@ 7 million years ago . A genome study concluded that cheetahs experienced two genetic bottlenecks in their history , the first about 100 @,@ 000 years ago and the second about 12 @,@ 000 years ago , greatly lowering their genetic variability . These bottlenecks may have been associated with migrations across Asia and into Africa ( with the current African population founded about 12 @,@ 000 years ago ) , and / or with a depletion of prey species at the end of the Pleistocene . 
 Cheetah fossils found in the lower beds of the Olduvai Gorge site in northern Tanzania date back to the Pleistocene . The extinct species of Acinonyx are older than the cheetah , with the oldest known from the late Pliocene ; these fossils are about three million years old . These species include Acinonyx <unk> ( Pliocene epoch ) , notably larger than the modern cheetah , and A. intermedius ( mid @-@ Pleistocene period ) . While the range of A. intermedius stretched from Europe to China , A <unk> spanned over Eurasia as well as eastern and southern Africa . A variety of larger cheetah believed to have existed in Europe fell to extinction around half a million years ago . 
 Extinct North American cats resembling the cheetah had historically been assigned to Felis , Puma or Acinonyx . However , a phylogenetic analysis in 1990 placed these species under the genus Miracinonyx . Miracinonyx exhibited a high degree of similarity with the cheetah . However , in 1998 , a DNA analysis showed that Miracinonyx <unk> , M. <unk> , and M. <unk> ( early to late Pleistocene epoch ) , found in North America , are not true cheetahs ; in fact , they are close relatives of the cougar .

 Asiatic cheetah ( A. j. venaticus ) ( Griffith , 1821 ) : Also called the Iranian or Indian cheetah . Formerly occurred across southwestern Asia and India . According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources ( IUCN ) , it is confined to Iran , and is thus the only surviving cheetah subspecies indigenous to Asia . It has been classified as Critically Endangered . A 2004 study estimated the total population at 50 to 60 . Later , a 2007 study gave the total population in Iran as 60 to 100 ; the majority of individuals were likely to be juveniles . The population has declined sharply since the mid @-@ 1970s . As of 2012 , only two captive individuals are known . 
 Northwest African cheetah ( A. j. hecki ) <unk> , 1913 : Also called the Saharan cheetah . Found in northwestern Africa ; the IUCN confirms its presence in only four countries : Algeria , Benin , Burkina Faso and Niger . Small populations are known to exist in the Ahaggar and Tassili N 'Ajjer National Parks ( Algeria ) ; a 2003 study estimated a population of 20 to 40 individuals in Ahaggar National Park . In Niger , cheetahs have been reported from the <unk> Mountains , Ténéré , Termit Massif , <unk> and <unk> valley . A 1993 study reported a population of 50 from Ténéré . In Benin , the cheetah still survives in Pendjari National Park and W National Park . The status is obscure in Burkina Faso , where individuals may be confined to the southeastern region . With the total world population estimated at less than 250 mature individuals , it is listed as Critically Endangered . 
 South African cheetah ( A. j. jubatus ) ( Schreber , 1775 ) : Also called the Namibian cheetah . Occurs in southern African countries such as Namibia , Botswana , Zimbabwe , South Africa and Zambia . <unk> from the Asiatic cheetah nearly 0 @.@ 32 – 0 @.@ 67 million years ago . In 2007 the population was roughly estimated at less than 5 @,@ 000 to maximum 6 @,@ 500 adult individuals . Not listed by the IUCN . 
 Sudan cheetah ( A. j. <unk> ) ( Fitzinger , 1855 ) : Also called the central or northeast African cheetah . Found in the central and northeastern regions of the continent and the Horn of Africa . This subspecies was considered identical to the South African cheetah until a 2011 genetic analysis demonstrated significant differences between the two . 
 Tanzanian cheetah ( A. j. <unk> syn . A. j. <unk> ) Heller , 1913 : Also called the east African cheetah . Found in Kenya , Somalia , Tanzania , and Uganda . The total population in 2007 was estimated at 2 @,@ 572 adults and independent adolescents . Significant populations occur in the Maasai Mara and the Serengeti ecoregions . 
 = = Genetics = = 
 The diploid number of chromosomes in the cheetah is 38 , the same as in any other felid ( though for the ocelot and the <unk> the number is 36 ) . A remarkable feature of the cheetah is its unusually low genetic variability in comparison to other felids . Consequently , individuals show considerable genetic similarity to one another , as illustrated by skin grafts , electrophoretic evidence and reproductive surveys . A prolonged period of inbreeding , following a genetic bottleneck during the last ice age , is believed to be the reason behind this anomaly . The consequences of such genetic uniformity might include a low sperm count , motility , deformed flagella , difficulty in captive breeding and susceptibility to disease . 
 = = = King cheetah = = = 
 The king cheetah is a variety of cheetah with a rare mutation for cream @-@ coloured fur marked with large , blotchy spots and three dark , wide stripes extending from their neck to the tail . In 1926 Major A. Cooper wrote about an animal he had shot near modern @-@ day Harare . Describing the animal , he noted its remarkable similarity to the cheetah , but the body of this individual was covered with fur as thick as that of a snow leopard and the spots merged to form stripes . He suggested that it could be a cross between a leopard and a cheetah . After further similar animals were discovered , it was established they were similar to the cheetah in having non @-@ retractable claws – a characteristic feature of the cheetah . 
 English zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock described it as a new species by the name of Acinonyx rex ( " rex " being Latin for " king " , the name translated to " king cheetah " ) ; However , he reverted from this in 1939 . English hunter @-@ naturalist Abel Chapman considered it to be a colour morph of the spotted cheetah . Since 1927 the king cheetah has been reported five more times in the wild ; an individual was photographed in 1975 . 
 In May 1981 two spotted sisters gave birth at the De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre ( South Africa ) , and each litter contained one king cheetah . Each sister had mated with a wild male from the Transvaal region ( where king cheetahs had been recorded ) . Further king cheetahs were later born at the Centre . They have been known to exist in Zimbabwe , Botswana and northern Transvaal . In 2012 the cause of this alternative coat pattern was found to be a mutation in the gene for transmembrane <unk> Q ( <unk> ) , the same gene responsible for the striped " mackerel " versus blotchy " classic " patterning seen in tabby cats . Hence , genetically the king cheetah is simply a variety of the common cheetah and not a separate species . This case is similar to that of the black panthers . The mutation is recessive , a reason behind the rareness of the mutation . As a result , if two mating cheetahs have the same gene , then a quarter of their offspring can be expected to be king cheetahs . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 The cheetah is a big cat with several distinctive features – a slender body , deep chest , spotted pelage , a small rounded head , black tear @-@ like streaks on the face , long thin legs and a long spotted tail . Its lightly built , slender form is in sharp contrast with the robust build of the other big cats . The head @-@ and @-@ body length ranges from 112 – 150 centimetres ( 44 – 59 in ) . The cheetah reaches 70 – 90 centimetres ( 28 – 35 in ) at the shoulder , and weighs 21 – 72 kilograms ( 46 – 159 lb ) . Thus , it is clearly taller than the leopard , which stands nearly 55 – 70 centimetres ( 22 – 28 in ) at the shoulder . The weight range of the cheetah overlaps extensively with that of the leopard , which weighs 28 – 65 kilograms ( 62 – 143 lb ) . On the other hand , the cheetah is significantly shorter than the lion , whose average height is nearly 120 centimetres ( 47 in ) . Moreover , it is much lighter than the lion , among which females weigh 126 kilograms ( 278 lb ) and the much heavier males weigh 186 kilograms ( 410 lb ) . Based on measurements , the smallest cheetahs have been reported from the Sahara , northeastern Africa and Iran . A sexually dimorphic species , males are generally larger than females . 
 The head is small and streamlined , adding to the agility of the cheetah . Saharan cheetah have narrow canine faces . Small , short , and rounded , the ears are marked by black patches on the back ; the edges and base of the ears are tawny . The high @-@ set eyes have round pupils . The whiskers , shorter and fewer in number than those of other felids , are fine and inconspicuous . The pronounced tear streaks are unique to the cheetah . These streaks originate from the corner of the eyes and run down the nose to the mouth . Their role is obscure – they may be serving as a shield for the eyes against the sun 's glare , a helpful feature as the cheetah hunts mainly during the day ; another purpose could be to define facial expressions . 
 Basically yellowish tan or rufous to greyish white , the coat of the cheetah is uniformly covered with nearly 2 @,@ 000 solid black spots . The upper parts are in stark contrast to the underbelly , which is completely white . Each spot measures nearly 3 @.@ 2 – 5 @.@ 1 centimetres ( 1 @.@ 3 – 2 @.@ 0 in ) across . Every cheetah has a unique pattern of spots on its coat ; hence , this serves as a distinct identity for each individual . Cheetah fur is short and often coarse . Fluffy fur covers the chest and the ventral side . Several colour morphs of the cheetah have been identified , including melanistic and albino forms . Black cheetah have been observed in Kenya and Zambia . In 1877 – 1878 , English zoologist Philip Sclater described two partially albino specimens from South Africa . A ticked ( tabby ) cheetah was photographed in Kenya in 2012 . Juveniles are typically dark with long , loose , blue to grey hair . A short mane , about 8 centimetres ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) long , on the neck and the shoulders , is all that remains of the cape in adults . The exceptionally long and muscular tail measures 60 – 80 centimetres ( 24 – 31 in ) , and ends in a bushy white tuft . While the first two @-@ thirds of the tail are covered in spots , the final part is marked with four to six dark rings or stripes . The arrangement of the terminal stripes of the tail differs among individuals , but the stripe patterns of siblings are very similar . In fact , the tail of an individual will typically resemble its siblings ' to a greater extent than it resembles its mother 's or any other individual 's . 
 The cheetah is often confused with the leopard and the cougar and can be distinguished by its small round spots in contrast to the leopard 's rosettes and the cougar 's plain coat ; in addition , the leopard lacks the tear streaks of the cheetah . The cougar possesses neither the tear streaks nor the spotted coat pattern of the cheetah . The serval has a form very similar to that of the cheetah but is significantly smaller . Moreover , it has a shorter tail and spots that fuse to form stripes on the back . 
 = = = Anatomy = = = 
 The morphology of the cheetah differs notably from the other big cats . The face and the jaw are unusually shortened and the sagittal crest is poorly developed , possibly to reduce weight and enhance speed . In fact , the skull resembles that of the smaller cats . Another point of similarity to the small cats is the long and flexible spine , in contrast to the stiff and short one of other large felids . A 2001 study of felid morphology stated that the truncation of the development of the middle phalanx bone in the cheetah at a relatively younger age than other felids could be a major reason for the peculiar morphology of the cheetah . Interestingly , the cheetah appears to show convergent evolution with canids in morphology as well as behaviour . For example , the cheetah has a relatively long snout , long legs and deep chest , tough foot pads and blunt , semi @-@ retractable claws ; moreover , its hunting behaviour resembles that of canids . In the 2001 study , it was observed that the claws of cheetah have features intermediate between those of felids and the wolf . In the Puma lineage , the cheetah 's skull morphology is similar to that of the puma – both have short , wide skulls – while that of the jaguarundi is different . 
 The cheetah has a total of 30 teeth ; the dental formula is 3 @.@ 1 @.@ 3 @.@ 13 @.@ 1 @.@ 2 @.@ 1 . The deciduous dentition is 3 @.@ 1 @.@ 23 @.@ 1 @.@ 2 . The sharp , narrow cheek teeth help in tearing flesh , whereas the small and flat canine teeth bite the throat of the prey to suffocate it . Males have slightly bigger heads with wider incisors and longer mandibles than females . The muscles between the skull and jaw are short , and thus do not allow the cheetah to open its mouth as much as other cats . <unk> animals , the cheetah have tough foot pads that make it convenient to run on firm ground . The hind legs are longer than the forelegs . The relatively longer metacarpals , metatarsals ( of the lower leg ) , radius , ulna , tibia , and fibula increase the length of each jump . The straightening of the flexible vertebral column also adds to the length . 
 Cheetahs have a high concentration of nerve cells , arranged in a band in the centre of the eyes . This arrangement , called a " visual streak " , significantly enhances the sharpness of the vision . Among the felids , the visual streak is most concentrated and efficient in the cheetah . The nasal passages are short and large ; the smallness of the canines helps to accommodate the large nostrils . The cheetah is unable to roar due to the presence of a sharp @-@ edged vocal fold within the larynx . 
 The paws of the cheetah are narrower than those of other felids . The slightly curved claws lack a protective sheath and are weakly retractable ( semi @-@ retractable ) . This is a major point of difference between the cheetah and the other big cats , which have fully retractable claws , and a similarity to canids . Additionally , the claws of the cheetah are shorter as well as straighter than those of other cats . Absence of protection makes the claws blunt ; however , the large and strongly curved dewclaw is remarkably sharp . 
 = = Ecology and behaviour = = 
 Cheetahs are diurnal ( active mainly during the day ) , whereas the leopards , tigers , and lions are nocturnal ( active mainly at night ) ; <unk> allows better observation and monitoring of the animal . Hunting is the major activity throughout the day ; peaks are observed during dawn and dusk indicating crepuscular tendencies . Groups rest in grassy clearings after dusk , though males and juveniles often roam around at night . The cheetah is an alert animal ; individuals often inspect their vicinity at observation points such as elevations . Even while resting , they take turns at keeping a lookout .
