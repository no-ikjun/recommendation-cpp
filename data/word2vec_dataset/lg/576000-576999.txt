 There are several distinct neighborhoods in the Point Loma peninsula . Most neighborhoods in Point Loma consist primarily of single family homes . The commercial and retail heart of the peninsula is called Point Loma Village . Its retail establishments serve local residents as well as yachting and sport fishing interests . The streets in Point Loma Village are lined with hundreds of <unk> trees as a result of community beautification efforts . The newest commercial and retail area is found at Liberty Station , site of the former Naval Training Center San Diego , which also has residential and educational sections . The Midway district at the northern end of the peninsula , adjacent to the San Diego River and the I @-@ 5 and I @-@ 8 freeways , is primarily commercial and industrial with a few small residential developments . 
 Connected to Point Loma Village by a causeway is Shelter Island , which is actually not an island but a former sandbank in San Diego Bay . Shelter Island was developed in the 1950s after it was built up into dry land using material dredged from the bay . It is under the control of the Port of San Diego and contains hotels , restaurants , marinas , and public parkland . 
 The bayside residential area called La Playa lies somewhat north of the original La Playa , the beach where commercial and military ships anchored during the early days of the city . La Playa includes some of the most expensive homes in San Diego . Some bayfront homes have private piers for small boats . The hills above La Playa are known as the Wooded Area on the bay side of Catalina Boulevard ( so called because of the many mature trees in the area ) , and the College Area on the ocean side ( because of the proximity of Point Loma Nazarene College ) . The Sunset Cliffs neighborhood is on the west side , above ocean bluffs , and is known for its views of the Pacific Ocean . 
 Roseville , named for San Diego pioneer Louis Rose , encompasses the oldest settled part of the peninsula . Roseville was originally a separate town but later was absorbed into San Diego . Many Portuguese fishermen and fishing boat owners settled there more than 100 years ago . Some people refer to the area as " <unk> " because of its association with the tuna @-@ fishing fleet . The hilly area above Roseville is known as <unk> , named for its developer David Fleet , a son of Reuben H. Fleet . 
 The bayside hills between Rosecrans Street and Chatsworth Boulevard north of Nimitz Boulevard are known as Loma Portal . A distinctive feature of this neighborhood is the location of street lights in the middle of several street intersections instead of on the sidewalk . Loma Portal lies directly in the takeoff pattern for planes from Lindbergh Field , making it the home of the " Point Loma Pause " where all conversation ceases temporarily due to airplane noise . The east @-@ west streets in Roseville and Loma Portal are known as the " alphabetical author streets " . The streets are named for authors in alphabetical order from Addison to Zola , with a second partial cycle from Alcott to Lytton . 
 The northwest corner of the peninsula , where the San Diego River flows into the ocean , is a separate community known as Ocean Beach . The southern one @-@ third of the Point Loma Peninsula is entirely federal land , including Naval Base Point Loma , Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery , and Cabrillo National Monument . 
 = = = Fauna = = = 
 The area contains multiple species of wildlife , both in the federal lands at the southern end of the peninsula ( managed in part as an ecological reserve ) and in the developed suburban areas . Mammals include raccoons , skunks , possums , bats , rabbits , California ground squirrels , gray foxes , and occasional coyotes . More than 300 species of birds have been observed in Point Loma , which lies on the Pacific Flyway migration route . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The main economic engines of Point Loma are military facilities , neighborhood @-@ serving retail , and marine recreation , particularly yachting and deep @-@ sea fishing . 
 = = = Tourism = = = 
 Marine activities are mostly located on the Bay ( eastern ) side of the peninsula , where there are three yacht clubs , including the San Diego Yacht Club , which was home to the America 's Cup from 1988 to 1995 . There are half a dozen small @-@ boat marinas on the Bay side of Point Loma . There is also a commercial dock which services sport fishing cruises as well as seasonal whale watching expeditions . Point Loma hosts the biggest sport fishing fleet in Southern California . The Bay side hosts numerous other businesses related to yachting and fishing , such as marine supply stores , yacht brokerages , boat repair yards , and hotels and motels catering to fishing enthusiasts . Some restaurants and hotels have docks for customers who arrive by boat . 
 Tourists and locals visit the cliffs on the western side of the peninsula for views of the ocean and the sunset - hence the name , Sunset Cliffs . There are surfing spots below the cliffs , such as <unk> 's , Garbage Beach , and New Break . The cliffs are unstable and can be dangerous ; a woman died in a fall from the cliffs in December 2008 , and other falls have resulted in injuries . 
 The Point Loma area has a number of hotels , restaurants , and local businesses . Located in the Voltaire business district , near Ocean Beach , is the Point Loma Youth Hostel , frequented by travelers from around the world . The San Diego Sports Arena and the SOMA concert venue are located in the Midway neighborhood of Point Loma . 
 = = = Military = = = 
 Point Loma is home to several major military installations including the US Navy 's <unk> program , the US Marine Corps ' Recruit Training Depot ( <unk> San Diego ) and Naval Base Point Loma . The Navy controls approximately 1 @,@ 800 acres ( 730 ha ) of Point Loma and provides employment to about 48 @,@ 000 military personnel and civilians . 
 Naval Base Point Loma , at the southern end of Rosecrans Street in the La Playa area , is the home of Submarine Squadron 11 , with several nuclear fast @-@ attack submarines , and the Naval Mine and Anti @-@ Submarine Warfare Command , including eight Avenger class mine countermeasures ships . The naval base also houses extensive electronic and communications operations ( including the former Naval Electronics Laboratory ) serving the Pacific Fleet . At the southern end of the peninsula is historic Fort Rosecrans , site of the U.S. Army 's Coast Artillery Corps during World War I and World War II . Fort Rosecrans also includes the Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery and the USS Bennington Monument . 
 The Naval Training Center San Diego served as a basic training facility for new Navy recruits for more than 70 years , as well as hosting many specialty schools providing advanced career training for sailors . In April 1997 the base was closed and these schools were moved to Recruit Training Command , Great Lakes , Illinois . The former site of the base is now Liberty Station , a 361 @-@ acre ( 1 @.@ 46 km2 ) mixed @-@ use redevelopment project that includes residential , office , retail , educational , and civic , arts and cultural districts . Liberty Station was developed by the City of San Diego and The Corky McMillin companies . It also includes a 9 @-@ hole golf course , a 46 @-@ acre ( 190 @,@ 000 m2 ) waterfront park and a 100 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 40 km2 ) historic district listed with the National Register of Historic Places .

 The Day at the Docks festival each April highlights Point Loma 's sport fishing industry . 
 The Festa do Espirito Santo , or Feast of the Holy Spirit , is a religious festival put on by Point Loma 's large Portuguese community . It has been staged annually since 1910 and is San Diego 's oldest ethnic tradition . 
 The Cabrillo Festival each October is a weekend @-@ long commemoration of the landing of Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo in Point Loma in 1542 . 
 From June through September , nationally known musicians and comedians perform at an outdoor concert venue on Shelter Island . 
 A free outdoor concert series features local musicians on five Friday evenings in a local park each summer . 
 Every year since 1952 , the St. Nicholas Home Tour has been held on the first Saturday in December . The tour typically includes 4 - 6 significant homes decorated for the holidays , and is accompanied by tea , cookies , and caroling . All but one of the tours has been hosted by All Souls ' Episcopal Church . This is said to be the oldest home tour west of the Mississippi River . 
 Point Loma is noted for neighborhood Christmas decorations . Several blocks of Garrison Street near Chatsworth are particularly well known for elaborate decorations . There is also a neighborhood @-@ wide lighting of <unk> on Christmas Eve in the <unk> Park area . On two Sundays in December there is a Parade of Lights , with brightly decorated boats sailing on the Bay to be viewed from the shoreline .

 Point Loma contains a few small neighborhood parks and the Cabrillo Recreation Center . There is large waterfront park at Liberty Station , which also contains a nine @-@ hole golf course . Most of the ocean frontage of the peninsula is a public shoreline park called Sunset Cliffs Natural Park . The Point Loma Native Plant Garden features plants and flowers native to the San Diego area . Cabrillo National Monument is a federal historic park at the southern end of the peninsula . 
 The James Edgar and Jean Jessop Hervey Public Library opened in 2003 , replacing a much smaller public library . The new library , built by Conwell <unk> & Associates , was partly funded by a donation via the San Diego Foundation from the Hervey family , who had close ties to the area . Jean Jessop Hervey in particular used to visit the old Point Loma Library every Tuesday to read with her children . The library , located at <unk> Voltaire Street , is over 25 @,@ 000 square feet and holds over 80 @,@ 000 books . It includes a kitchen area , a community meeting room , and outdoor sitting patios . The lower floor is the largest children 's library in the City of San Diego , featuring a simulated ship , reading desks shaped like surfboards , an art space and a Story Time Zone . In connecting to the place of Point Loma , the library 's architectural style features a nautical theme . There is even an operating periscope , salvaged from a U.S. Navy submarine , through which visitors can see the surrounding neighborhood . The floor in the entry lobby features a terrazzo map of the Point Loma Peninsula . The library holds scheduled events such as story time for children , Thursday after school movies , and arts and crafts demonstrations . 
 = = Government = = 
 The Point Loma community is part of the city of San Diego . On the San Diego City Council it is part of District 2 , currently represented by <unk> <unk> . In the Government of San Diego County , Point Loma is divided between District 1 and District 4 . In the California state legislature it is part of Assembly District 78 , currently represented by <unk> Toni Atkins , and Senate District 39 , represented by Senator Marty Block . At the federal level it is part of the 52nd Congressional District and is represented by Congressman Scott Peters . 
 Some portions of the Point Loma peninsula are not under the jurisdiction of the city , including the federal and military lands as well as the bayside tidelands governed by the Port of San Diego . Approximately 60 % of the Point Loma community is included in the Coastal Zone and is subject to regulation by the California Coastal Commission . 
 The Peninsula Community Planning Board is an advisory board which makes recommendations to the city on planning , land use , and similar matters for the Point Loma area . There are separate planning boards for Ocean Beach and the Midway area . 
 = = Education = = 
 Point Loma has several public , charter , and private schools at the elementary , middle , and high school levels , as well as multiple private preschools , an adult school and a university . Point Loma 's public schools are part of the San Diego Unified School District . Neighborhood public schools include Point Loma High School , two middle schools , and seven elementary schools . There is also a public charter school campus in the Liberty Station area which encompasses three high schools , two middle schools , and one elementary school , collectively known as High Tech High . Point Loma educational facilities also include a K @-@ 12 religious school , a religious elementary / middle school , and a private elementary / middle school . 
 Post @-@ secondary education is offered at Point Loma Nazarene University , a Christian liberal arts college whose ocean @-@ view campus was once the home of the Theosophical Society . The Peninsula also has a branch campus of the San Diego Community College District . 
 = = Infrastructure = = 
 Interstate 8 freeway follows the northern edge of the Point Loma peninsula , paralleling the San Diego River , and terminates a few blocks from the Pacific Ocean . Rosecrans Street is the north / south avenue that serves the bay side of Point Loma , while Sunset Cliffs Boulevard is the north / south avenue on the ocean side ; the two streets run parallel to each other and to Catalina Boulevard on the crest of the hill . The former California State Route 209 followed Rosecrans and Catalina to the southern end of the Point . Sports Arena Boulevard , West Point Loma Boulevard , Harbor Drive and Nimitz Boulevard are other major traffic pipelines in Point Loma . 
 Most streets in the coastal sections , both bay and ocean , are laid out in a rough grid pattern , with the oceanside blocks larger than the bayside . The grid breaks down in the hilly center , particularly west of Chatsworth Boulevard and east of Catalina and Nimitz Boulevard , where streets have more terrain @-@ following , curvy patterns . Some streets are broken into multiple disconnected sections by intervening canyons or hills . The presence of hills and canyons , together with the restraints imposed by a long narrow peninsula , result in " circuitous routing of traffic and a great deal of out @-@ of @-@ direction travel .

 = Hurricane Anita = 
 Hurricane Anita was a powerful Atlantic hurricane during an otherwise quiet 1977 Atlantic hurricane season . The first tropical cyclone of the season , Anita developed from a tropical wave on August 29 in the north @-@ central Gulf of Mexico . It tracked westward into an area with conditions favorable for further development , and quickly intensified into a hurricane by late on August 30 . Initially , Anita was forecast to strike Texas , though a building ridge turned it to the west @-@ southwest . The hurricane rapidly strengthened to attain peak winds of 175 mph ( 280 km / h ) , and on September 2 Anita made landfall in eastern Tamaulipas as a Category 5 hurricane . It quickly weakened as it crossed Mexico , and after briefly redeveloping into a tropical depression in the eastern Pacific Ocean , Anita dissipated on September 4 to the south of the Baja California Peninsula . 
 The hurricane produced light rainfall and high tides along the Gulf Coast of the United States . Some low @-@ level flooding was reported , but damage was slight . In Mexico , the hurricane caused strong winds and moderate rainfall . The winds caused extensive damage to villages in northeastern Mexico , with about 25 @,@ 000 people left homeless . The rainfall , reaching over 17 @.@ 52 inches ( 445 mm ) , caused flooding and mudslides which killed eleven people in Tamaulipas . Overall damage is unknown . 
 = = Storm history = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 16 . The wave axis tracked steadily westward , and on August 23 convection increased after the wave passed beneath a cold @-@ core upper @-@ level low . By August 27 , the wave axis was located over Cuba , with the area of convection located between Florida and the Bahamas after tracking northwestward . The disturbance crossed southern Florida , and after entering the Gulf of Mexico an anticyclone provided favorable conditions for further development . It tracked slowly westward at 5 mph ( 7 km / h ) , and after developing a surface circulation the system developed into a tropical depression on August 29 while located about 230 miles ( 370 km ) south @-@ southwest of New Orleans , Louisiana . 
 With a ridge of high pressure to its north , the depression tracked westward . Favorable conditions persisted for several days prior to the arrival of the depression , and as such the depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Anita . The storm tracked slowly over warm water temperatures , and throughout its duration it was embedded within warm , moist tropical air ; Anita rapidly organized and attained hurricane status late on August 30 ; this is the latest date for the first hurricane since 1967 . Initially it threatened to strike Texas , though building high pressures to the north of the hurricane turned Anita to the west @-@ southwest . The hurricane developed a well @-@ defined eye , and Hurricane Anita began to rapidly intensify late on September 1 after attaining major hurricane status . During a two @-@ day period up to its peak intensity , Anita deepened at a rate of 2 mbar per hour , and on September 2 the hurricane reached peak winds of 175 mph ( 280 km / h ) while located just offshore northeastern Mexico , making Anita a Category 5 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . 
 Hurricane Anita maintained its strength as it approached land , and at 1100 UTC on September 2 it made landfall on Soto la Marina , Tamaulipas , about 145 miles ( 235 km ) south of Brownsville , Texas or 80 miles ( 130 km ) north of Tampico , Mexico . Moving ashore with a pressure of 926 mbar , Anita was the third most intense tropical cyclone to strike the nation , and was the most intense hurricane to hit from the Gulf of Mexico . It rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of Mexico , and on September 3 , about 25 hours after moving ashore , Anita emerged into the eastern Pacific Ocean as a tropical depression . Reclassified as Tropical Depression Eleven , the system continued to the west , and weakened further after encountering cooler water temperatures . The depression gradually lost its deep convection , and on September 4 it dissipated off of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula .

 Shortly after first developing , one oil company evacuated its oil rigs off of Texas and Louisiana by helicopter , with several other companies beginning to evacuate unneeded workers . Ultimately , 7 @,@ 000 oil workers were removed from offshore oil platforms . The threat of the developing disturbance prompted officials to close a state park in southern Louisiana . The National Hurricane Center advised small craft along the northern Gulf Coast to remain at port . Initially , Anita was predicted to continue tracking west @-@ northwestward and make landfall near the Texas / Louisiana border . As a result , schools in Cameron Parish , Louisiana were closed , and on August 30 a hurricane watch was issued for the southwestern Louisiana and northeastern Texas coastlines . After the track shifted further to the south , the watch was replaced with a hurricane warning between Brownsville and just south of Corpus Christi , Texas . An emergency shelter was opened in <unk> , Texas , and Army trucks were prepared to assist in evacuations . An official from the National Weather Service recommended evacuation for all residents east of Galveston , Texas living in an area below 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) above sea level ; about 20 @,@ 000 left Cameron , Louisiana . In all , about 58 @,@ 000 people evacuated coastal locations in Louisiana and Texas . 
 Though the National Hurricane Center did not issue hurricane warnings for Mexico , officials warned the Mexican government of the potential danger of the hurricane . Across the northeastern coastline of the country , 35 @,@ 000 people evacuated prior to the arrival of the hurricane , including all of the residents in the village where the hurricane struck . The Mexican army assisted in evacuations and preparing emergency shelters .

 As the precursor tropical disturbance crossed southern Florida , it dropped light rainfall of over 1 inch ( 25 mm ) in the Miami area . Later , as a developing tropical depression , the system produced gusty winds and heavy rainfall in southern Louisiana ; one station near Galliano reported over 3 inches ( 76 mm ) of precipitation . Hurricane Anita produced a storm tide of 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 6 m ) above normal in Grand Isle , which resulted in hundreds of families being asked to leave their homes . 
 The hurricane produced above @-@ normal tides along the Texas coastline , which closed several highways including Texas State Highway 87 . The northern periphery of Hurricane Anita produced light to moderate rainfall across the southern portion of the state , which peaked at 4 @.@ 97 inches ( 126 mm ) at Rio Grande City . Damage in the state was minor ; on South Padre Island damage was limited to a few broken windows .

 Hurricane Anita made landfall in a sparsely populated portion of Mexico ; as a result , few meteorological statistics exist . A station near where the hurricane moved ashore recorded 17 @.@ 52 inches ( 445 mm ) of precipitation in six hours , which resulted in severe flooding and mudslides . Winds along the eastern Mexico coastline were estimated at over 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . 
 The hurricane caused extensive damage to fishing and farming communities in northeastern Mexico . Strong winds destroyed thousands of homes and left about 25 @,@ 000 people homeless , according to newspaper reports from Mexico City . The winds destroyed the roofs of most buildings near where the hurricane moved ashore , and also caused widespread power outages which disrupted communications . Heavy rainfall destroyed or obstructed roadways across the region , with some flooded avenues in Tampico and reports of flooded highways near Ciudad Victoria . Eleven people were killed in floods and mudslides across Tamaulipas . In all , at least 50 @,@ 000 people were affected by the hurricane in Mexico .

 The name Anita was retired following this storm , and will never be used for an Atlantic hurricane again . Shortly after the hurricane made landfall , the government of Mexico sent two trucks of food to the areas of greatest impact . Additionally , officials permitted full use of the Mexican railway system to facilitate the distribution of aid . Three municipalities were also declared disaster areas following the storm . In Texas , the combination of moderate rainfall and high tides into low @-@ lying marshland led to a mosquito outbreak near Galveston following the storm . 
 = Banksia acanthopoda = 
 Banksia acanthopoda is a species of shrub in the Proteaceae family . It grows as a small spreading shrub to 2 m ( 6 1 ⁄ 2 ft ) high and has prickly leaves and yellow composite flower heads , called inflorescences , composed of 50 to 60 individual yellow flowers . Endemic to Western Australia , it occurs only in a few populations in the vicinities of Woodanilling , Katanning and <unk> . Because of its rarity , it is classed as " Priority Two " conservation flora by Western Australia 's Department of Environment and Conservation . 
 The botanist Alex George first described this species in 1996 , naming it Dryandra acanthopoda . It was renamed to its current name in 2007 , when all Dryandra species were transferred to the genus Banksia . It is little known in cultivation and its sensitivity to dieback is unclear ( although highly likely ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 Banksia acanthopoda grows as a spreading shrub up to 2 m ( 6 1 ⁄ 2 ft ) high . Its stems are matted with short soft hairs when young , but these are soon lost . Leaves are long , thin and curved , with five to ten spines on the petiole , sharply serrated leaf margins , and an acute leaf tip . The leaf blade , or lamina , is dark @-@ green above , but white and hairy beneath . Leaves range from 5 to 13 cm ( 2 to 5 1 ⁄ 8 in ) in length , and 1 to 1 @.@ 5 cm ( 3 ⁄ 8 to 5 ⁄ 8 in ) in width , on a petiole up to 1 @.@ 5 cm ( 5 ⁄ 8 in ) long . 
 Inflorescences occur on short lateral branches , and consist of 50 to 60 yellow flowers packed densely together into a dome @-@ shaped head up to 4 cm ( 1 1 ⁄ 2 in ) in diameter , surrounded by short involucral bracts . As with other Banksia species , each flower comprises a perianth of four united tepals , with a single anther on a short filament attached near the tip ; and a single pistil . In B. acanthopoda both perianth and pistil are yellow in colour ; the perianth is from 2 @.@ 6 to 3 cm ( 1 to 1 1 ⁄ 8 in ) long , and the pistil a few millimetres longer . The fruiting structure is a woody dome firmly embedded with up to six light brown follicles , each containing one or two seeds . 
 Banksia acanthopoda resembles B. hewardiana but has smaller leaves that are sticky when young . Its flower heads are similar to that of B. squarrosa , but its perianths and pistils are straight rather than curved , and longer . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Early collections of B. acanthopoda include a specimen collected by F. W. Humphreys between Katanning and <unk> on 21 December 1964 , a specimen collected by Alex George west of Woodanilling on 26 July 1986 , a specimen collected by Ray <unk> north of Woodanilling on 7 October 1986 , and a specimen collected by Ken <unk> east of Katanning . George 's specimen was recognised as belonging to an undescribed species , and this species was referred to by the phrase name " Dryandra sp . 1 ( A.S. George <unk> ) " , until 1996 , when George formally published it as Dryandra acanthopoda . The specific name comes from the Ancient Greek <unk> ( " thorn " or " prickle " ) and podos ( " foot " ) , in reference to the spines on the petiole . 
 George placed B. acanthopoda in genus Dryandra , subgenus Dryandra , series Armatae , remarking that its closest relative is Dryandra polycephala ( now Banksia polycephala ) . Its placement within George 's taxonomic arrangement of Dryandra , with 1999 and 2005 amendments , is as follows : 
 Dryandra ( now Banksia ser . Dryandra ) 
 D. subg . Dryandra 
 D. ser . Floribundae ( 1 species , 4 varieties ) 
 D. ser . Armatae 
 D. cuneata ( now B. obovata ) 
 D. <unk> ( now B. <unk> ) 
 D. armata ( now B. armata ) ( 2 varieties ) 
 D. prionotes ( now B. <unk> 
 D. arborea ( now B. arborea ) 
 D. hirsuta ( now B. <unk> ) 
 D. pallida ( now B. pallida ) 
 D. <unk> ( now B. <unk> ) 
 D. <unk> ( now B. <unk> ) 
 D. <unk> ( now B. <unk> ) 
 D. acanthopoda ( now B. acanthopoda ) 
 D. squarrosa ( now B. squarrosa ) ( 2 subspecies ) 
 D. hewardiana ( now B. hewardiana ) 
 D. <unk> ( now B. <unk> ) 
 D. <unk> ( now B. <unk> ) 
 D. stricta ( now B. <unk> ) 
 D. echinata ( now B. echinata ) 
 D. polycephala ( now B. polycephala ) 
 D. <unk> ( now B. <unk> ) ( 2 varieties ) 
 D. longifolia ( now B. <unk> ) ( 3 subspecies ) 
 D. borealis ( now B. borealis ) ( 2 subspecies ) 
 This arrangement remained current until 2007 , when botanists Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred Dryandra into Banksia . They also published B. subgenus Spathulatae for the Banksia taxa having spoon @-@ shaped cotyledons , thus redefining the subgenus Banksia as comprising those that do not . They were not ready , however , to tender an infrageneric arrangement encompassing Dryandra , so as an interim measure they transferred Dryandra into Banksia at series rank . This minimised the nomenclatural disruption of the transfer , but also caused George 's rich infrageneric arrangement to be set aside . Thus under the interim arrangements implemented by Mast and Thiele , B. acanthopoda is placed in B. subg . Banksia , ser . Dryandra . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Only a few small populations of B. acanthopoda exist . Until 1999 , it was thought to occur only in the Avon Wheatbelt biogeographic region , in the vicinity of Woodanilling and Katanning ; since then , a population has been found in the Jarrah Forest region , south of <unk> . 
 Banksia acanthopoda grows in tall closed kwongan heath in lateritic soils , sometimes with a sparse <unk> of wandoo ( Eucalyptus wandoo ) or Drummond 's gum ( E. drummondii ) . Other B. ser . Dryandra species that co @-@ occur with it include B. <unk> , B. armata var. <unk> and B. nobilis . The area has a mean temperature range of 9 to 22 ° C ( 48 to 72 ° F ) , with up to 40 days above 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) , and a mean annual rainfall of 400 to 500 mm ( 16 to 20 in ) . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Little has been reported of its ecology . The flowering season is from May to July , and the seed is shed annually . When first published , Banksia acanthopoda was listed as " Priority Three – Poorly Known Taxa " on the Department of Environment and Conservation 's Declared Rare and Priority Flora List . It has since been upgraded to " Priority Two – Poorly Known Taxa " . Threats to the species vary according to the location . In the Avon Wheatbelt , where the land is heavily degraded due to extensive clearing for agriculture , a number of threatening processes have been identified : loss of habitat due to land clearing and the encroachment of salinity results in both direct plant loss and population fragmentation ; fragmentation in turn affects genetic diversity ; grazing pressure affects plant health , as does competition from exotic weeds ; and changes to the fire regime have the potential to eliminate entire generations . Further west , in the Jarrah Forest region , pathogens constitute the only identified threat to the species . 
 Information on the species ' susceptibility to dieback is lacking : the only information available is from the 2006 report Management of Phytophthora cinnamomi for Biodiversity Conservation in Australia , which states that D. acanthopoda is " highly susceptible " ; but this claim is sourced to a 1994 paper that asserts it not for B. acanthopoda but for the species then known as " Dryandra sp . <unk> ( M. <unk> 20 @.@ 9 @.@ 88 ) " , now B. <unk> . 
 Investigations into long @-@ term seed storage have shown B. acanthopoda to store well under standard <unk> storage conditions . After six years of storage in these conditions , 90 % of seeds were successfully germinated , a rate similar to that of fresh seed . 
 = = Cultivation = = 
 Banksia acanthopoda is little known in cultivation , although it has been successfully grown and propagated at The Banksia Farm in Mount Barker , Western Australia , and at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Cranbourne , Melbourne . It is a sprawling and untidy shrub , but its habit can be improved by pruning . Its prominent yellow flower heads appear from July to October in cultivation , and have potential for use in the cut flower industry . It prefers a well @-@ drained soil in full sun or light shade , and will tolerate dry conditions once established . Propagation is by seed ; seeds take three to five weeks to germinate , and have a germination rate of 80 to 90 percent . 
 = Lemmons = 
 Lemmons , also known as Gladsmuir and Gladsmuir House , was the home of novelists Kingsley Amis ( 1922 – 1995 ) and Elizabeth Jane Howard ( 1923 – 2014 ) on Hadley Common , on the border of north London and Hertfordshire . 
 The couple bought the Georgian house and its eight acres of land at auction for £ 48 @,@ 000 in 1968 , and lived there until 1976 . The house had been registered as a Grade II listed building in 1949 under the name Gladsmuir , previously known as Gladsmuir House . Jane Howard restored its previous name , Lemmons ; the next owners changed it back to Gladsmuir . 
 Jane and Kingsley lived at Lemmons with Jane 's mother and brother , two artist friends , and Kingsley 's three children , Philip , Martin and Sally . Several of the family 's novels were written at Lemmons , including Kingsley 's The Green Man ( 1969 ) and The Alteration ( 1976 ) , Jane 's Odd Girl Out ( 1972 ) and Mr. Wrong ( 1975 ) , and Martin 's The Rachel Papers ( 1973 ) and Dead Babies ( 1975 ) . 
 Cecil Day @-@ Lewis , the poet laureate , his wife , Jill Balcon , and their children , Daniel Day @-@ Lewis and Tamasin Day @-@ Lewis , stayed at Lemmons in the spring of 1972 , when Cecil was dying of cancer . He wrote his last poem in the house , " At Lemmons , " and died there shortly afterwards . Ian Sansom writes that , for the brief period that the <unk> , Howards , Day @-@ Lewises and others were in residence , Lemmons became " the most brilliantly creative household in Britain . "

 = = = 16th – 19th century = = = 
 The land and an earlier house were owned by Henry Bellamy in 1584 . The Quilter family owned the land from 1736 to 1909 ( it was an estate of 23 acres in 1778 ) . A Major <unk> appears to have lived in the house in or around 1881 . Captain Thomas Hall Rokeby Plumer , the 2nd Viscount Plumer , lived there in the 1920s . 
 The writer Frances Trollope , mother of novelist Anthony Trollope , rented a house on Hadley Common from January 1836 until the early summer of 1838 , possibly Gladsmuir , shortly after the death of her husband and one of her sons . According to Robert Bradford 's biography of Martin Amis , Jane Howard discovered the Trollope connection from the house 's papers and maintained that Frances Trollope had purchased it , although a purchase seems unlikely given the Trollope family 's finances . 
 Frances Trollope , her daughters , Emily and Cecilia , and two of her sons , Anthony and Tom , moved to Hadley Common from Bruges , Belgium , where they had fled to escape debtors ' prison in England . When Trollope 's husband ( the debtor ) died , the threat of prison receded . Emily had tuberculosis and her doctor advised that winter in England would benefit her . 
 Trollope described the property as a " pleasant house with a good garden on the common at Hadley , near Barnet , " and her " pretty cottage . " R. H. Super writes that she invited eight guests to stay with her one Christmas , in addition to her family , so referring to it as a cottage was somewhat misleading . The move did not , in the end , help Emily , who died in February 1836 . She was buried in the nearby churchyard at the Church of St Mary the Virgin . Anthony Trollope later placed one of his characters in The <unk> ( 1859 ) in a dull country house in Hadley . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 Jane Howard found that the house had previously been called Lemmons , and decided to restore that name . It was known as Gladsmuir when they bought it – from Gladsmuir Heath , the former name of Hadley Common , site of the Battle of Barnet in 1471 during the Wars of the Roses . The house had been registered under that name as a Grade II listed building in 1949 , previously known as Gladsmuir House , with an address in Hadley Wood Road . As of 2014 the address was listed as Hadley Common . 
 Made of red brick with a stucco trim , the house has five @-@ bays , two @-@ storeys , sash windows , and a central Doric porch with fluted columns and entablature with triglyphs . There is a later extension and a detached housekeeper 's cottage , Gladsmuir Cottage . The panelled double doors lead to two internal staircases and over 20 rooms , including eight bedrooms , three reception rooms and a large kitchen ; one room contains late @-@ 18th @-@ century medallions . 
 In the three @-@ acre garden , when Jane and Kingsley lived there , there was an old barn that was itself a listed building , a conservatory and a gravel drive , three descending lawns , a rose garden , cedar trees , a mulberry tree ( where Lucy Snowe , their cat , was buried ) , and a weathervane dating to 1775 . At the end of the garden , through a five @-@ bar gate , there lay a five @-@ acre meadow that also belonged to the property and had been let out to two local women for their horses .

 Kingsley and Jane married in 1965 after meeting two years earlier at the Cheltenham Literary Festival , which she had helped to organize . In 1947 she had left her first husband , Peter Scott , with whom she had a daughter , and in 1963 divorced her second , Jim Douglas @-@ Henry . Kingsley was still married to his first wife , Hilly Bardwell , when he and Jane began an affair . 
 The couple first lived together in an Edwardian house at 108 Maida Vale , London , W2 . They bought Lemmons at auction for £ 48 @,@ 000 in 1968 , and lived there from 28 November that year . Kingsley wrote to the poet Philip Larkin in April 1969 : 
 This is a bloody great mansion , in the depths of the country though only 15 miles from the centre , and with lots of room for you to come and spend the night . " 
 The core household consisted of Jane and Kingsley ; Jane 's mother , Katherine ( " Kit " ) , a former ballerina , who died in the house in 1972 ; one of Jane 's brothers , Colin ( " Monkey " ) ; and artists Sargy Mann and Terry <unk> . The housekeeper , Lily Uniacke , lived in Gladsmuir Cottage . Kingsley 's children , Philip , Martin and Sally lived in the house from time to time , mostly outside term time , or at weekends in the case of Philip and Martin ; the children were 17 , 16 and 12 when Kingsley and Jane married . Sally moved into Lemmons in 1970 when Martin was in his second year at Oxford . 
 It was Jane who encouraged Martin to start reading . When she and Kingsley married , Martin was reading comics and Harold Robbins ; she recommended Jane Austen , Charles Dickens , Scott Fitzgerald , Evelyn Waugh , Graham Greene and William Golding . She also advised him to try for a place at Oxford , for which he said he owed her an " unknowable debt . " After 12 months at Sussex Tutors ( a crammer in Brighton ) in 1967 – 1968 , he passed six O @-@ levels and 3 A @-@ levels , and won an exhibition to Exeter College , Oxford . He graduated in 1971 with a congratulatory first in English . 
 Martin lived at Lemmons until Christmas that year , after which he started work at The Times Literary Supplement and moved to central London , visiting his father and Jane at weekends . He shared a maisonette in or near Pont Street , SW1 , with a friend , Rob Henderson – Henderson was Charles Highway in The Rachel Papers , Gregory Riding in Success ( 1978 ) , and <unk> in The Pregnant Widow ( 2011 ) . When they ran out of money , Martin found himself a " dust @-@ furred bed @-@ sit in Earls Court . " He described Lemmons in Experience ( 2000 ) : 
 The house on Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency – not just at Christmas but every weekend . There was a great sense of in @-@ depth back @-@ up , a cellar , a barrel of malt whisky , a walk @-@ in larder : proof against snowstorm or shutdown . I think it was that Christmas morning [ 1977 ] , that all four <unk> , with breakfast trays on their laps , watched Journey to the Centre of the Earth – then the visit to the pub , then the day @-@ long , the week @-@ long lunch . And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits , like an engine of comedy ... I felt so secure in that house – and , clearly , so insecure elsewhere – that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as I climbed into the car on Sunday night , any Sunday night , and headed back to the motorway and Monday , to the flat or the <unk> , the street , the job , the tramp dread , the outside world . 
 = = = Novels = = = 
 Kingsley wrote ten books at Lemmons , in his wood @-@ panelled study on the ground floor , including The Green Man ( 1969 ) , What Became of Jane Austin ? And Other Questions ( 1970 ) , Girl , 20 ( 1971 ) , The Riverside Villas Murder ( 1973 ) , Ending Up ( 1974 ) , The Alteration ( 1976 ) , and part of Harold 's Years ( 1977 ) . Jane finished Something in Disguise ( 1969 ) , Odd Girl Out ( 1972 ) and Mr. Wrong ( 1975 ) , though she spent most of her time looking after the house . 
 Martin wrote his first two novels , The Rachel Papers ( 1973 ) and Dead Babies ( 1975 ) , in his bedroom above Kingsley 's study . The first draft of The Rachel Papers was started in July 1970 and completed in September 1972 ; it won the Somerset Maugham Award in 1974 , which Kingsley had won in 1955 for Lucky Jim ( 1954 ) . When he heard the prize had gone to Martin , Kingsley said words to the effect that , " Good that it 's back in the family . It should keep the old prig turning in his grave , " a reference to Maugham 's view that Lucky Jim 's characters were illustrative of the country 's moral decline .

 Tamasin Day @-@ Lewis wrote that Lemmons was always full of " impossibly glamorous older people and a core commune of writers , painters and inventors ; even the dogs and cats shared a communal basket , and there were always stray writers and publishers whose marriages were unravelling . " Gully Wells , Martin 's girlfriend and step @-@ daughter of the philosopher A. J. Ayer , said that " a more hospitable household would be impossible to imagine . " 
 House guests included Martin 's close friends Christopher Hitchens , James Fenton , Clive James and Julian Barnes , and his and Kingsley 's literary agents Tom Maschler and Pat Kavanagh ; Pat 's sister , Julie ( Martin 's girlfriend ) ; the Australian psychiatrist James Durham , Pat 's partner at the time . Pat Kavanagh and Julian Barnes married in September 1979 . 
 The Lemmons visitors ' book also listed John Betjeman and Philip Larkin ; writers Tina Brown and Paul Johnson , and Johnson 's wife , Marigold ; Iris Murdoch and her husband , John Bayley ; journalist Bernard Levin and John Gross , editor of the Times Literary Supplement ; the broadcaster Huw Wheldon and his wife , novelist Jacqueline Wheldon ; historians Robert Conquest and Paul Fussell ; and , for one visit , novelist Elizabeth Bowen . 
 The Day @-@ Lewises moved into Lemmons in the spring of 1972 when Tamasin 's father , the poet laureate Cecil Day @-@ Lewis , was dying of cancer . The families were close . Cecil and Jane had been lovers after her first divorce and Jane was Tamasin 's godmother . Tamasin and Martin had also started dating . 
 Tamasin and her brother , Daniel , and their mother , Jill Balcon , stayed at the house for five weeks , until Cecil died on 22 May . Jane wrote : " Nobody was better at getting the utmost pleasure from the simplest things as Cecil : a bunch of flowers , a toasted bun , a gramophone record ... a piece of cherry cake , a new thriller ... " He dedicated his final poem , " At Lemmons , " to " Jane , Kingsley , Colin , Sargy " : " I accept my weakness with my friends ' / Good natures sweetening each day my sick room . "

 Lemmons was featured in Woman 's Journal in June 1976 in an advertisement for wallpaper by Arthur Sanderson & Sons . The company decorated a room and took a photograph of Kingsley and Jane sitting in it , published under the headline " Very Sanderson , Very Amis . " 
 The couple sold Lemmons shortly after this , for £ 105 @,@ 000 . They moved to a smaller house , <unk> House , in Flask Walk , Hampstead , London <unk> . Kingsley was apparently tired of living so far from central London . Jane loved Lemmons , but was exhausted from the effort of running it . Kingsley expected her to do most of the cooking and domestic work , for the family plus assorted guests , as well as drive him around and do the finances and much of the gardening . Women for Kingsley were " for bed and board , " as Jane put it . She ended up on <unk> and Valium . Sargy Mann said that Lemmons was " wonderful for everyone but Jane . " 
 Jane left the marriage in 1980 because she realized that Kingsley did not like her ; her lawyer gave him a letter the day she was expected back from a health farm . Neither of them remarried , and they never spoke to each other again . " [ T ] he big house disappeared , " Martin wrote , " and so did love . " 
 = Blitz @-@ class aviso = 
 The Blitz class was a pair of avisos built by the Imperial German Navy ( Kaiserliche Marine ) in the 1880s . The ships , Blitz and Pfeil , were the first steel @-@ hulled ships of any kind built by the German Navy , and the progenitors of the later light cruisers of the Gazelle type . They were armed with a 12 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 9 in ) gun and one 35 cm ( 14 in ) torpedo tube as their principal armament , and were capable of a top speed in excess of 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . 
 Blitz and Pfeil served extensively in various roles , including as flotilla leaders for torpedo boats . Pfeil was deployed to German East Africa in 1889 to suppress an anti @-@ colonial revolt , and after 1899 , was used for fishery protection . They were both reduced to tenders by 1912 . Blitz was briefly used as a coastal patrol vessel early in World War I before returning to tender duties by 1915 . Both ships survived the war , and were sold for scrap in the early 1920s .

 The Blitz class avisos were the first step toward creating the modern , steel @-@ hulled light cruiser , which would ultimately come to fruition in the Gazelle class , built a decade later . The Blitz @-@ class ships were also the first steel @-@ hulled ships of any type built by the German Navy . At the time of their completion , they were among the earliest torpedo cruisers in the world .

 The Blitz @-@ class ships were 75 @.@ 30 meters ( 247 ft 1 in ) long at the waterline and 78 @.@ 43 m ( 257 ft 4 in ) long overall . They had a beam of 9 @.@ 90 m ( 32 ft 6 in ) and a maximum draft of 4 @.@ 07 m ( 13 @.@ 4 ft ) forward . The ships displaced 1 @,@ 381 metric tons ( 1 @,@ 359 long tons ) as designed and up to 1 @,@ 486 t ( 1 @,@ 463 long tons ) at full combat load . The ships ' hulls were constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames , and contained eleven watertight compartments . A double bottom was located beneath the ships ' engine rooms . 
 Blitz and Pfeil had a crew of 7 officers and 127 enlisted men , though this number was later revised to 6 officers and 135 sailors . When serving as torpedo boat flotilla leaders , the ships had an additional 3 officers and 16 enlisted men . The ships carried several smaller boats , including one picket boat , one yawl , and one dinghy . Later in their careers , a cutter , another yawl , and another dinghy were added .

 The ships ' propulsion system consisted of two horizontal 2 @-@ cylinder double expansion engines in a single engine room . The engines drove a pair of 3 @-@ bladed screws . Steam for the engines was provided by eight coal @-@ fired locomotive boilers . After refits in the early 1890s , the ships ' boilers were replaced with newer , more efficient models ; Blitz received eight transverse cylindrical boilers , while Pfeil had eight cylindrical boilers installed . The ships were supplied with electrical power with a single 10 @-@ kilowatt ( 13 hp ) generator that operated at 67 volts . As built , the ships were fitted with a schooner rig with a sail area of 591 square meters ( 6 @,@ 360 sq ft ) to supplement her steam engines , but this was later reduced to a rig of auxiliary sails with an area of 282 m2 ( 3 @,@ 040 sq ft ) , and the sails were removed entirely by 1900 . 
 The propulsion system was rated at 2 @,@ 700 indicated horsepower ( 2 @,@ 000 kW ) , for a top speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . Neither ship reached this speed on trials ; Blitz managed 15 @.@ 7 knots ( 29 @.@ 1 km / h ; 18 @.@ 1 mph ) , and Pfeil made 15 @.@ 6 knots ( 28 @.@ 9 km / h ; 18 @.@ 0 mph ) . The ships carried up to 220 t ( 220 long tons ; 240 short tons ) of coal , which allowed them to steam for approximately 2 @,@ 440 nautical miles ( 4 @,@ 520 km ; 2 @,@ 810 mi ) at a cruising speed of 9 knots ( 17 km / h ; 10 mph ) .

 Blitz was laid down at the Norddeutscher Schiffbau in Kiel in 1881 . She was launched on 26 August 1882 and commissioned into the German fleet on 28 March 1883 . Pfeil was built by the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Wilhelmshaven . Her keel was laid down in 1881 , she was launched on 16 September 1882 , and commissioned into the German fleet on 25 November 1884 . Both ships served in the fleet following their commissioning . Blitz was assigned as the flagship of the I Torpedo @-@ boat Flotilla , while Pfeil initially served as a tender for the fleet . 
 Blitz participated in extensive training and experimentation in the Torpedo School , under the command of Alfred von Tirpitz , the future architect of the High Seas Fleet . In 1889 , Pfeil was sent to German East Africa to participate in the suppression of a local revolt against German colonial rule . By 1899 , both ships were withdrawn from front line service ; Pfeil was used for fishery protection , and Blitz became a fleet tender . In 1912 , both Blitz and Pfeil were serving as tenders to the I Battle Squadron and the II Battle Squadron , respectively . At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , Blitz was mobilized as a coastal patrol ship , while Pfeil remained a tender . Blitz returned to her tender duties in 1915 . Both ships were sold for scrapping in the early 1920s .

 American Pharoah ( foaled February 2 , 2012 ) is an American Thoroughbred racehorse who won the American Triple Crown and the Breeders ' Cup Classic in 2015 . In winning all four races , he became the first horse to win the " Grand Slam " of American horse racing . He won the 2015 Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year and 2015 Champion three @-@ year @-@ old . He was bred and owned throughout his racing career by Ahmed Zayat of Zayat Stables , trained by Bob Baffert , and ridden in most of his races by Victor Espinoza . He now stands at stud at Ashford Stud in Kentucky . 
 After finishing fifth in his track debut as a two @-@ year @-@ old , American Pharoah won his next races , the Grade I Del Mar Futurity and FrontRunner Stakes , each by several lengths . An injury kept him out of the Breeders ' Cup Juvenile , but the strength of his two wins nonetheless resulted in his being voted American Champion Two @-@ Year @-@ Old Male Horse at the 2014 Eclipse Awards . Before the 2015 season began , Zayat had sold breeding rights to the colt to the Ashford Stud , a division of Ireland 's Coolmore Stud . He retained control over the colt and his racing career , as well as an undisclosed dividend on stud fees . 
 American Pharoah began his 2015 campaign with wins in the Rebel Stakes and Arkansas Derby and went on to win the 2015 Kentucky Derby and 2015 Preakness Stakes . He won the Triple Crown in a wire @-@ to @-@ wire victory at the 2015 Belmont Stakes , becoming the first American Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978 and the 12th in history . His winning time was the second @-@ fastest for a Triple Crown winner , and his closing quarter @-@ mile time of 24 @.@ 32 was faster than Secretariat 's . He next shipped to Monmouth Park and easily won the Haskell Invitational on August 2 , prompting Baffert to say , " He just keeps bringing it ; he 's a great horse . " Three weeks later , he finished a close second in a hard @-@ fought Travers Stakes at Saratoga Race Course on August 29 , 2015 , snapping a winning streak of eight races . After a layoff of two months , he shipped to Keeneland for the 2015 Breeders ' Cup and ran in the Breeders ' Cup Classic , where he challenged older horses for the first time and won by 6 1 ⁄ 2 lengths , breaking the track record . Pursuant to the agreement between Zayat and Ashford , American Pharoah was retired to stud at the conclusion of his 2015 racing year . 
 = = Background = = 
 American Pharoah is a bay colt with a faint star on his forehead and no other white markings . He is from the second crop of foals sired by Pioneerof the Nile , who finished second in the 2009 Kentucky Derby . The stallion 's first crop included Holy Bull Stakes winner Cairo Prince , and Social Inclusion , who finished third in the 2014 Preakness Stakes . American Pharoah 's dam , Littleprincessemma , was purchased by Zayat in 2007 for $ 250 @,@ 000 . She raced but did not win either of her two starts in 2008 . American Pharoah was her second foal , following allowance race winner <unk> . Since his birth , she had produced two more full siblings to American Pharoah : a filly born in 2014 , and a colt , foaled in 2015 after she sold — in foal to Pioneerof the Nile — in November 2014 for $ 2 @.@ 1 million . 
 American Pharoah was bred in Kentucky by his owner , Ahmed Zayat , CEO of Zayat Stables , LLC , and was born at 11 p.m. on Groundhog Day , February 2 , 2012 , at Tom <unk> 's <unk> Farm in Lexington , Kentucky . When he was a few days old , he and Littleprincessemma went to nearby Pretty Run Farm , also owned by <unk> , where they remained for a few months . Later , the mare and foal were moved to <unk> , another Lexington farm where Pioneerof the Nile was stabled . There , American Pharoah was weaned at five months of age , and stood out from the other <unk> due to his conformation and good temperament . 
 In January 2013 as a yearling , he went to Taylor Made Farm near Nicholasville , Kentucky , and began to be prepared for possible sale . In August 2013 , American Pharoah was consigned by the Taylor Made Sales Agency to the Fasig @-@ Tipton Saratoga Yearling sale . A few weeks before the auction , American Pharoah bumped his leg and had a small lump that was visible to potential buyers at the sale , which may have discouraged bidders . He was officially purchased for the posted minimum of $ 300 @,@ 000 by <unk> Bloodstock , acting as an agent for Zayat , who in effect bought back his own horse . Zayat had pledged that he would not sell the promising but untested colt for less than $ 1 million . Zayat similarly bought back Pioneerof the Nile , American Pharoah 's sire , for $ 290 @,@ 000 in a 2007 yearling auction . 
 " We felt that he had brilliance in him , " said Zayat of American Pharoah , " his demeanor , his aura , his conformation , the way he moved . " Following the auction , the horse first went to Florida and was started under saddle at the McKathan Brothers Training Center near Citra , where trainer J.B. McKathan said , " He just did everything right . " Once he was ready to begin race conditioning , he went into training with Hall of Fame inductee Bob Baffert in the spring of 2014 . 
 He was described in 2014 as a <unk> , rather than a colt , meaning that he had an undescended testicle . The 2013 catalogue for his yearling Fasig @-@ Tipton sale listed him as a " colt " , and he was described that way again in 2015 . Zayat maintained the " <unk> " designation was an error : " he was always a colt . " 
 The horse is set apart from other race horses by his smooth and distinctively long stride . Baffert has stated , " I 've never had a horse that moves or travels over the ground like he does . " The most unusual characteristic of American Pharoah during his two- and three @-@ year @-@ old seasons is his short tail — it was apparently chewed off by another horse . It is theorized that Mr. Z , a fellow competitor and Zayat @-@ bred colt , may have been the culprit ; the pair were kept together in Florida as younger horses . Trainer Baffert had a more colorful theory : " I think he was in the pasture one day and there was a mountain lion chasing him — that was the closest he could get ... " 
 American Pharoah 's gentle demeanor is also distinctive , in that he is fond of people and , particularly for a young racehorse , surprisingly calm around them . As Baffert explained , " Horses of his caliber are not that nice and sweet . They 're just sort of tough . If I brought Bayern out here , you can 't get near him , he 's too aggressive . [ American Pharoah ] ' s just so different than any horse I 've ever had . " He was not always so calm , described initially as " a little bit of a <unk> , " but Baffert explained that after his anxiety @-@ ridden first race , people worked with him , schooling him in the track paddock for about two weeks , when " all the sudden he got really sweet and really mellow . " 
 = = = Name = = = 
 American Pharoah 's name is inspired by that of his sire , Pioneerof the Nile , and his dam 's sire , Yankee Gentleman . The horse 's name also acknowledges Zayat 's own Egyptian @-@ American background . The misspelling of " Pharaoh " is permanent , but inadvertent . Zayat originally claimed that the spelling was the result of an error by The Jockey Club , but the organization 's president stated , " The name request for the 2012 colt American Pharoah was submitted electronically on January 25 , 2014 , through The Jockey Club 's interactive registration site . Since the name met all of the criteria for naming and was available , it was granted exactly as it was spelled on the digital name application . " Zayat later retracted his statement . 
 Zayat 's wife , Joanne , offered another explanation for the name 's origins to a local news reporter just before the Preakness . Zayat 's son , Justin , ran a contest on social media in which fans could submit names for the horse . The winning entry had " Pharaoh " misspelled , she said . " Justin cut and pasted the name from [ the winner 's ] email , and sent it to the Jockey Club . " Marsha Baumgartner of Barnett , Missouri , who submitted the winning entry , told The New York Times , " I don 't want to assign blame , " but " I looked up the spelling before I entered . " Nonetheless , Baumgartner minimized the controversy , stating , " Horses can 't spell , anyway . " Ultimately , Justin Zayat accepted responsibility for the error , stating , " I didn 't happen to realize at the time that it was misspelled wrong ... Most English teachers in the world now are unhappy with me , but I 'll live with that . " 
 Due to the winning record of American Pharoah , The Jockey Club has now reserved both spellings so another horse cannot be similarly named . The Triple Crown blanket awarded to American Pharoah after his Belmont win inadvertently used the correct spelling of " pharaoh " , and hence misspelled his name .

 American Pharoah made his track debut in a maiden race over six and a half furlongs on the Polytrack surface at Del Mar Racetrack on August 9 . Ridden by Martin Garcia , he started as the 7 – 5 favorite against eight opponents . He became unsettled before the race and , after running in second place until the stretch , faded to finish fifth behind Om , Iron Fist , One Lucky Dane , and Calculator , more than nine lengths behind the winner . He ran in a blinker hood , which appeared to unnerve him , as did the commotion in the saddling paddock . Baffert addressed his anxiety issues by removing the hood and stuffing cotton in the horse 's ears for subsequent races . 
 Despite his defeat , American Pharoah was moved up to Grade I class for the Del Mar Futurity over seven furlongs on September 3 . He was ridden by Victor Espinoza for the first time and started as the 3 @.@ 2 – 1 second favorite behind Best Pal Stakes winner Skyway , with Calculator and Iron Fist also in the field . American Pharoah took the lead from the start and went clear in the straight to win by four and three quarter lengths from Calculator , with a gap of more than eight lengths back to Iron Fist in third . Commenting on the colt 's improvement , Baffert said , " We took the blinkers off , put cotton in his ears and schooled him a lot . He trained well , we decided he was ready and we put him in there . Today , he behaved himself and showed what he could do . He did what we thought he 'd do the first time . " 
 On September 27 , American Pharoah was made the 1 – 2 favorite for the Grade I FrontRunner Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Santa Anita Park . As in his previous race , he was immediately sent to the front by Espinoza and stayed there , pulling away from his rivals in the straight to win by three and a quarter lengths over Calculator , with Texas Red a length and a half away in third . After the race , Espinoza explained how the colt moved : " All the way he was on a high cruising speed . He has such a long stride . He moves really nice and is light on his feet . " Baffert said , " I can 't believe his demeanor , how he has changed since his first out . He 's so professional . He 's really mentally there . " 
 American Pharoah was scheduled to run in the Breeders ' Cup Juvenile at Santa Anita on November 1 but was scratched from the race after sustaining a " deep bruise " to his left front foot in a workout on October 27 . After this injury , he was fitted with a special horseshoe . His farrier , Wes Champagne , placed a thin sheet of aluminum alloy over a regular racing horseshoe and cut it to match the dimensions of the shoe , leaving the front two @-@ thirds of the hoof sole exposed , but creating a solid plate across the back that covered part of American Pharoah 's heels and part of his frog . Champagne varied the design slightly depending on the tracks and races American Pharoah would run , but used the same basic concept throughout the Triple Crown series . 
 Even though he did not run in the Breeders ' Cup , for the 2014 Eclipse Awards , American Pharoah was voted American Champion Two @-@ Year @-@ Old Male Horse , beating Breeders ' Cup Juvenile winner Texas Red by 126 votes to 111 .

 Five and a half months after his last start , American Pharoah began his second season in the Grade II Rebel Stakes on a sloppy track at Oaklawn Park on March 14 . He carried top weight of 119 pounds and started as the 2 – 5 favorite against six opponents , headed by the Todd Pletcher @-@ trained <unk> . The colt led from the start and drew away in the closing stages to win by six and a quarter lengths . Espinoza called the winner " an amazing horse " , while Baffert was satisfied with the run , especially as the colt returned with a twisted shoe which would have hampered his progress . Four weeks later at the same track , American Pharoah started as the odds @-@ on favorite against seven opponents in the Grade I Arkansas Derby . After racing in second place behind outsider Bridget 's Big <unk> , he took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish and steadily increased his advantage to win by eight lengths from Southwest Stakes winner Far Right . Baffert noted , " He 's matured substantially . He 's a good horse and he keeps moving forward . I don 't want to get ahead of myself , but Dortmund is another one who we don 't yet know how good he is . We 've got a one @-@ two punch and that 's a good position to be in . " After the race , Ron <unk> , the trainer of runner @-@ up Far Right , described American Pharoah as " a <unk> " . 
 = = = = 2015 Kentucky Derby = = = = 
 On May 2 , American Pharoah started as the 2 @.@ 9 – 1 favorite in an eighteen @-@ runner field for the 141st running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs . His opponents included Dortmund , winner of the Santa Anita Derby ; Carpe Diem , who won the Breeders ' Futurity Stakes and Blue Grass Stakes ; Firing Line , winner of the Sunland Derby ; Wood Memorial winner Frosted ; Florida Derby winner Materiality ; international entry Mubtaahij , who earned his way to Kentucky with a win in the UAE Derby ; and Upstart , winner of the Holy Bull Stakes . The crowd surrounding the horse during the walk @-@ over from the barns to the paddock upset American Pharoah , and several grooms were required to keep him under control . He continued to misbehave until he was loaded into the starting gate ; his connections and supporters worried that he was using up energy he needed for the race . 
 Espinoza positioned the colt in third place early in the race as Dortmund took the lead , followed closely by Firing Line . The three remained ahead of the pack throughout the race , and broke clear of their rivals entering the straightaway with American Pharoah making a forward move on the outside . The favorite took the lead entering the final furlong and won by a length from Firing Line and Dortmund in 2 : 03 @.@ 02 , with Frosted finishing strongly in fourth . Espinoza , who won the race for the third time , said , " I feel like the luckiest Mexican on earth . He has been a special horse since the first time I rode him . He has a lot of talent and is an unbelievable horse . Turning for home I started riding a little bit harder . At the eighth pole I just couldn 't put that other horse away , but he got it done . " Espinoza 's performance attracted some scrutiny as he appeared to have struck the winner 32 times with his whip during the race . In post @-@ race analysis , one of the stewards at Churchill Downs said , " we watched [ the race replay ] many , many times prior to making it official , and that wasn 't anything that got our attention . " Baffert said , " He was hitting him on the saddle towel . He doesn 't hit that hard . " Gary Stevens , rider of second @-@ place Firing Line , commented that he had used his whip heavily as well , stating that the race was " as tough a race as I 've been in in 20 years the last eighth of a mile . " The Blood @-@ Horse writer Steve Haskin , while condemning whip overuse in general , offered analysis that Espinoza " did a lot of waving with the whip " and may not have actually hit the horse as many times as it seemed . Reflecting on the race , Baffert said that the colt did not bring his " super A @-@ game " to the Derby and that it was the first time American Pharoah had really been tested by other aggressive horses . 
 = = = = 2015 Preakness Stakes = = = = 
 Two weeks after winning the Kentucky Derby , American Pharoah entered the second leg of the Triple Crown , the 2015 Preakness Stakes , run over nine and a half furlongs at Pimlico Race Course . Despite an unfavorable inside draw of the number one post position , he was installed as the morning line favorite ahead of Firing Line and Dortmund . No horse had won the Preakness starting from the rail since 1994 . Immediately before post time , the weather changed to a heavy downpour with thunder . The last time the Preakness had been run on a sloppy track was in 1983 , and American Pharoah was the only horse in the field to have previously faced similar conditions , having won the Rebel Stakes running in rain and mud . 
 American Pharoah had the lead within the first quarter @-@ mile and was challenged by Mr. Z early on , but held the lead on the inside throughout the race . He was challenged by Dortmund and then Divining Rod , but American Pharoah broke from the pack in the homestretch and won by seven lengths , as Tale of Verve made a strong rally to overtake Divining Rod to place . Firing Line slipped badly at the start and was eased in the stretch . The winning time was 1 : 58 @.@ 45 . Espinoza did not use his whip at all in the Preakness , and stated , " I couldn 't see how far I was in front because there was so much water in my eyes . " The margin of victory was tied for the sixth @-@ largest in Preakness history . The win by American Pharoah set up an attempt for the Triple Crown for the second straight year . It was also the second straight year that Espinoza had won both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes and the jockey 's third time winning both races . For Baffert , it was the fourth time in 19 years that he won the first two Triple Crown races . Of the colt , Baffert said , " He brought his A @-@ game today . " 
 = = = = 2015 Belmont Stakes and Triple Crown = = = = 
 In the week following the Preakness , the Leverage Agency was named as the exclusive marketing , sponsorship and licensing agents for the horse . They had performed similar duties for the 2014 Derby and Preakness winner , California Chrome . The agency secured a deal with Monster Energy for an undisclosed sum , rumored to be the largest single @-@ horse advertising sponsorship to date . The deal allowed the " Monster Girls " to be around the horse , and the product 's logo to be used on the horse 's horse sheets , on Espinoza 's shirt collar , as well as on caps and other gear worn by people around the horse . Ben <unk> of Leverage explained , " The energy and excitement that American Pharoah has generated around the world syncs perfectly with the brand . " 
 Baffert created some controversy prior to the Belmont by choosing to work the horse at Churchill Downs and ship late to Belmont Park without a timed workout at the New York track . While several prominent trainers questioned his decision , Baffert believed that it was more important to keep American Pharoah " happy " on a track he liked , having used a similar strategy with his 2001 Belmont Stakes winner , Point Given . Rival trainers <unk> McLaughlin and D. Wayne Lukas backed Baffert 's strategy , with McLaughlin making the remark , " I don 't think it matters for American Pharoah . He could probably run down a street over broken glass . " Appearing unperturbed but curious about a small crowd of well @-@ wishers , American Pharoah arrived at Long Island MacArthur Airport on June 2 , having traveled from Louisville , Kentucky on a customized Boeing 727 dubbed " Air Horse One " . 
 American Pharoah 's connections drew the number five post position for the Belmont on June 3 . Pundits immediately noted it was the same slot from which Seattle Slew had won the 1977 Belmont and the Triple Crown , and that 14 other Belmont winners had started from the position . American Pharoah was the 3 – 5 morning line favorite in an eight @-@ horse field that included Tale of Verve , as well as five rivals from the Kentucky Derby who had skipped the Preakness , and one horse , <unk> , who had not run either of the previous Triple Crown races , but , like Tonalist the year prior , had instead won the Peter Pan Stakes at Belmont Park . American Pharoah had previously defeated every horse entered , but he was also the only horse to contest all three legs of the Triple Crown and had run four races in the preceding eight weeks . 
 American Pharoah won the Belmont Stakes on June 6 , becoming the 12th Triple Crown winner and the first since 1978 , ending a " drought " of 37 years . The horse was leaning back in the starting gate when it opened and was a touch late at the start , but he soon pulled out to an early lead , which he maintained for a gate @-@ to @-@ wire win . He steadily increased his lead throughout the race . He was challenged by Materiality until the top of the stretch when Materiality faded , ultimately finishing last , and Frosted held second although starting to fade at the sixteenth pole . Keen Ice ran in the middle of the pack until a late rally brought him into third over Mubtaahij , who was fourth . American Pharoah crossed the finish line leading by 5 1 ⁄ 2 lengths , with a winning time of 2 : 26 @.@ 65 for the 1 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ mile ( 2 @,@ 400 m ) race . His margin of victory was the fourth @-@ largest ever for a Triple Crown winner at the Belmont . 
 Of the victory , Baffert said , " this little horse deserves it . There 's something about this horse that he just brought it every time . He 's a joy to be around . " In a post @-@ race interview , Zayat said that the colt 's racing schedule for the remainder of the year would be decided by Baffert , and that the needs of the horse would come first . He also acknowledged the need for horse racing to have " stars " and for them to race as long as they could . Though American Pharoah 's stud rights had been sold with plans to retire the horse at the end of 2015 , Zayat expressed hope that the horse would continue racing as long as he was healthy and " has it in him " . His winning time of 2 : 26 @.@ 65 was the sixth @-@ fastest in Belmont history , the second @-@ fastest for a Triple Crown winner , and his closing quarter @-@ mile was run in 24 @.@ 32 seconds , which was over a half @-@ second faster than Secretariat 's final quarter @-@ mile time of 25 @.@ 00 when the 1973 winner set a world record and won by 31 lengths . 
 The following morning , the colt came out of the race tired but in good shape . When Baffert brought American Pharoah out of the Belmont Park barn , he invited the assembled media to come over and pet the horse . " I wanted to share him with everybody and show everybody how kind and sweet he is , " said Baffert , while the group of about 30 people touched and even kissed the horse . The horse then posed quietly with Baffert and Espinoza to tape a segment for The Today Show , standing between the two men who were seated in folding director 's chairs . 
 An estimated 22 million U.S. television viewers watched the live Belmont race broadcast . Of 94 @,@ 237 winning $ 2 tickets sold at Belmont Park , each with a yield of $ 3 @.@ 50 for American Pharoah 's first @-@ place finish , some 90 @,@ 128 remained unredeemed several days after the race , most likely kept as race @-@ day souvenirs or to be offered for sale at a premium by their purchasers . 
 = = = = The Haskell = = = = 
 Following the Belmont , he was returned to Churchill Downs to rest , beginning to jog on the track the following Friday . On June 13 , the day of the Stephen Foster Handicap , American Pharoah was paraded on the track between races . A crowd of 30 @,@ 000 people showed up to see him as he was hand @-@ walked for about 45 minutes in front of the grandstand and in the paddock . Zayat , Baffert and Espinoza were also given their permanent keepsake Kentucky Derby and Triple Crown trophies in a ceremony that evening . American Pharoah 's popularity was so high that his win made the cover of Sports Illustrated , he was photographed for Vogue , and during the NBA Playoffs , the coach of the Golden State Warriors , Steve Kerr , suggested that American Pharoah was the only athlete better than LeBron James . 
 American Pharoah 's next race was the Haskell Invitational , held August 2 at Monmouth Park , New Jersey . Zayat wanted the horse 's first race back be an " easy " race against other 3 @-@ year @-@ olds , he wanted to race the horse in Zayat 's home state of New Jersey , and he wanted to race on a Sunday to avoid a clash with the Jewish Sabbath . Zayat explained , " He can run anywhere ... as long as he 's happy and healthy ... I told [ Monmouth ] ... ' I want do to it for the sport and not worry about the money and stuff . " Nonetheless , Monmouth Park raised the purse money for the race from $ 1 million to $ 1 @.@ 75 million . Zayat had previously won the Haskell with Paynter in 2012 , and Baffert already held the record for the most Haskell wins , having seven previous victories . Over 60 @,@ 000 people showed up at Monmouth Park , which featured the Bruce Springsteen song " Born to Run " in the post parade . Viewed as being in even better physical condition than in the Belmont , American Pharoah took the lead in the far turn and easily opened up a five @-@ length lead over the six other horses in the race before Espinoza eased him back as second @-@ place finisher Keen Ice made a strong finishing push . He won the race by 2 1 ⁄ 4 lengths with a time of 1 : 47 @.@ 95 for the 9 @-@ furlong distance . Espinoza quipped , " He was having fun , and so was I. " Baffert said , " He just keeps bringing it ; he 's a great horse . " 
 = = = = Defeat at the Travers = = = = 
 The colt 's next start was in the August 29 Travers Stakes at Saratoga . While Zayat wanted to enter the race , Baffert was reluctant . The race marked the second time in under a month that American Pharoah , training with Baffert in California , had flown across the country , raising concerns that the extensive air travel was taking a toll on the horse . The only previous Triple Crown winner to win the Travers was Whirlaway in 1941 , and two others , Gallant Fox and Affirmed , had been defeated there , helping give the track its nickname " Graveyard of Champions " . Baffert had one Travers win ( in 2001 with Point Given ) in five previous attempts . With American Pharoah training well , he stated , " I 've been looking for an excuse not to come ( to the Travers ) and I can 't find one . " 
 American Pharoah faced a field of 10 horses , most of whom , including Keen Ice , he had previously defeated . Espinoza had concerns at the starting gate when he noticed that his mount was already sweating , even though the weather was not particularly hot . While the horse led for much of the race , he was hard @-@ pressed throughout by Frosted , a change from Frosted 's previous stalking style , attributed to a rider change less than an hour before the race , when Jose Lezcano replaced an injured Joel Rosario , altering the " complexion " of the race . The unexpected tactics of Lezcano may have been decisive . Espinoza stated that he " knew he was in trouble " by the half @-@ mile pole because American Pharoah did not pull away from his rival and lacked his usual energy . Frosted challenged American Pharoah for the lead at the far turn , and the horses bumped several times , but American Pharoah dug in and fought back when Frosted took a very brief lead . While American Pharoah fended off the challenge from Frosted , Keen Ice was coming up on the outside , also under a new jockey , Javier Castellano . They overtook American Pharoah at the sixteenth pole , going on to defeat him by three @-@ quarters of a length . Once again the Saratoga track lived up to its reputation . 
 After the race , Espinoza said , " He 's OK ... Maybe it was just a little too much for him those three weeks , flying back and forth . He was running pretty comfortable there , but not like he used to . " Baffert was proud of the horse 's fighting effort , stating " It was just guts . " Though Zayat talked of retiring the horse , Baffert said , " We knew we were doing the impossible , shipping him back and forth . " The following day , Baffert said that American Pharoah was healthy and came out of the race in good shape . He said he had no regrets , stating , " I 'm glad I brought him . Racing needed something like this . He almost pulled it off . " Regarding Zayat 's talk of retiring the horse , Baffert said , " Mr. Zayat is a very emotional man . We were all pretty disappointed ... I know ( Zayat ) will be going back and forth ... He 's a sportsman for bringing him up here . " Five days later , Zayat announced that the horse would be kept in training with the goal to run in the Breeders ' Cup Classic , stating , " I believe there were a combination of factors that prevented American Pharoah from running his absolute best ... I have every confidence that he can run to his best again , and he deserves the chance to do so . " 
 = = = = Grand Slam = = = = 
 On October 31 , 2015 , American Pharoah became the first horse in history to complete the " Grand Slam " of American horse racing — the Triple Crown plus the Breeders ' Cup Classic — after winning the 2015 Breeders ' Cup Classic at Keeneland , setting a track record with a time of 2 : 00 @.@ 07 ; and breaking the old track record by more than five seconds . Challenging older horses such as Tonalist and Honor Code for the first time in his career , as well as previous rivals Keen Ice and Frosted , American Pharoah led from gate @-@ to @-@ wire , challenged only by <unk> , racing at 33 – 1 odds , who placed 6 1 / 2 lengths behind the winner . Although American Pharoah 's decisive victory secured a $ 2 @.@ 75 million check for his win , Zayat had long insisted his horse continued to race only for the benefit of the sport and the pleasure of fans ; " this horse owes us nothing " , his son Justin Zayat said on the eve of the race . Joe Drape of The New York Times described American Pharoah 's Keeneland win as " sealing his legacy as a horse for the ages " . 
 American Pharoah finished 2015 having set a single season record for race earnings , winning $ 8 @,@ 288 @,@ 800 . He broke the previous single season record of $ 7 @,@ 563 @,@ 535 set by Smarty Jones in 2004 , and that record had included a $ 5 million bonus that is no longer awarded . His lifetime career earnings were $ 8 @,@ 650 @,@ 300 . His Racing Post Rating ( RPR ) of 138 was the highest of any American horse since the Racing Post began the system in 1988 , topping that of previous U.S. record @-@ holders Ghostzapper and Cigar . Only two horses worldwide had ever achieved higher ratings , Frankel at 143 , and Dubai Millennium , with 139 , both doing so as more mature four @-@ year @-@ olds . He was rated the number one horse in the world in 2015 by the World 's Best Racehorse Rankings . 
 = = = = Awards = = = = 
 At the conclusion of the season , American Pharoah 's accomplishments were named the top sports story of the year by the Associated Press . He or his connections also swept most of the year @-@ end achievement awards of the horse racing world . At the 2015 Eclipse Awards , he was the unanimous choice for American Horse of the Year and Champion Three @-@ Year @-@ Old Male Horse . His win marked only the second time that an American Horse of the Year had been unanimously selected , the first being John Henry in 1981 . He was named the winner of the Secretariat Vox Populi Award , and his Belmont win was declared the NTRA Moment of the Year . His connections were given the Big Sport of <unk> Award , an honor for people who " enhance coverage of Thoroughbred racing through cooperation with media and racing publicists . " In addition , Baffert won the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Trainer and Zayat Stables took home the Eclipse awards for Outstanding Owner and Outstanding Breeder . Acknowledging owner Ahmed Zayat 's record of philanthropy to Jewish causes , the Jewish Daily Forward in November 2015 named American Pharoah its " plus one " on its annual list of 50 most influential American Jews . The major award that the horse did not win was the Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year . In spite of being the public 's overwhelming favorite , earning 47 % of the vote out of eleven candidates in online voting , topping the Kansas City Royals , Usain Bolt , and Novak Djokovic , the editors of the magazine gave the award to Serena Williams . 
 = = Retirement = = 
 On May 20 , 2015 , The New York Times reported that Zayat had sold breeding rights to the colt to the Ashford Stud , a division of Ireland 's Coolmore Stud , but retained control over the colt and his racing career . Before the announcement , offers for American Pharoah 's breeding rights reportedly exceeded $ 20 million . After the Belmont , Forbes magazine reported that Zayat had actually sold the breeding rights to Ashford in late 2014 , long before he began his Triple Crown run , and that Zayat retained 100 % of the racing rights . Forbes went on to estimate that if American Pharoah stood for a $ 100 @,@ 000 stud fee , he could be worth $ 50 million . More conservative estimates placed his potential stud fee at $ 75 @,@ 000 and his potential value at about $ 25 to $ 36 million . The New York Times said that breeding rights had been sold for $ 13 @.@ 8 million : $ 9 @.@ 8 million with an additional $ 4 million incentive if American Pharoah won the Belmont Stakes . Zayat retained an undisclosed percentage in the colt 's breeding career , and explained that American Pharoah would retire from racing at the end of 2015 . 
 American Pharoah shipped to Ashford Stud on November 2 , 2015 , where he was housed in the stall once occupied by Grand Slam and <unk> each morning next to Thunder Gulch , who , at 23 years old , was chosen as a neighbor due to his calming influence on the young , energetic stallion . Ashford Stud set his initial stud fee for 2016 at $ 200 @,@ 000 , the second @-@ highest stud fee in the United States , behind that of the $ 300 @,@ 000 fee for <unk> . Sire Pioneerof the Nile 's stud fee of $ 60 @,@ 000 in 2015 was raised to $ 125 @,@ 000 for 2016 . 
 American Pharoah officially began breeding mares in the spring of 2016 , and was first bred to Untouched Talent , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old mare owned by Coolmore , dam of Zayat 's Bodemeister ; within the first two months of his breeding career , American Pharoah had " about " 80 mares in foal after approximately 100 breeding sessions . Notably , he has retained his kind disposition even as a breeding stallion . 
 = = Statistics = = 
 = = Pedigree = = 
 American Pharoah 's pedigree includes horses adept at classic race distances on his sire 's side and endowed with speed on his dam 's side . Sire Pioneerof the Nile won the Santa Anita Derby and ran second in the 2009 Kentucky Derby , with all of his wins at distances of 1 1 ⁄ 16 miles or more . Prior to American Pharoah , Pioneerof the Nile had sired five other winners of stakes races of a mile or more in his relatively new career as a stallion . Trainer Bob Baffert observed that Pioneerof the Nile also raced with " a big , long stride " and had " that same springing motion as American Pharoah , whose acceleration is pretty remarkable . " He also praised Pioneerof the Nile 's dam , Star of Goshen : " She was a freaky filly , really , really fast . " To Baffert , American Pharoah 's bloodline is a source of fascination : " Every time I work him , I go back and look at the pedigree , and I go , What is going on here ? " 
 Pioneerof the Nile 's sire is Empire Maker , who won the 2003 Belmont Stakes . This makes American Pharoah a great @-@ grandson of Unbridled , who won the 1990 Kentucky Derby and the Breeders ' Cup Classic . He carries lines to Grade I champions <unk> and <unk> , and to the top @-@ rated European two- and three @-@ year @-@ old colt of 1983 and 1984 , El Gran Senor . He is also descended from Northern Dancer , Buckpasser , and Mr. Prospector — whose descendants have won 43 Triple Crown races , all via Empire Maker . Ultimately , via Unbridled and his ancestors , American Pharoah 's sire line traces to the Darley Arabian . 
 Although Littleprincessemma , American Pharoah 's dam , is the half @-@ sister to graded stakes winner Storm Wolf , and to Misty Rosette , winner of the Old Hat Stakes in 2006 , her own undistinguished racing career , combined with the modest record of her sire , Yankee Gentleman , dampened initial public expectations for her second @-@ born foal . Yet American Pharoah 's maternal bloodline includes Storm Cat , a Grade I winner retired early due to injury , Northern Dancer , a Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner , and <unk> , a celebrated broodmare , through whom he is a fifth @-@ generation descendant of Secretariat . He is also descended through his dam from Flying Paster , a Grade I champion who was 1978 California Horse of the Year , and Exclusive Native ( sire of Affirmed and Genuine Risk ) . Through both sire and dam , American Pharoah is a fifth- and sixth @-@ generation descendant of Bold Ruler , as well as a sixth- and seventh @-@ generation descendant of Tom Fool , one of the top thoroughbreds of the last century . His tail @-@ female line traces back to The Oldfield Mare , foaled circa 1695 . 
 Figuring prominently and repeatedly in American Pharoah 's deep lineage is an earlier generation of champions , including <unk> , Native Dancer , Nearco , Princequillo , War Admiral and Man o ' War . 
 = Branded to Kill = 
 Branded to Kill ( <unk> , <unk> no <unk> ) is a 1967 Japanese yakuza film directed by Seijun Suzuki and starring Joe Shishido , Koji <unk> and Annu Mari . It was a low budget , production line number for the Nikkatsu Company , originally released in a double bill with <unk> Nishimura 's Burning Nature . The story follows Goro Hanada in his life as a contract killer . He falls in love with a woman named Misako , who recruits him for a seemingly impossible mission . When the mission fails , he becomes hunted by the phantom Number One Killer , whose methods threaten his sanity as much as his life . 
 The studio was unhappy with the original script and called in Suzuki to rewrite and direct it at the last minute . Suzuki came up with many of his ideas the night before or on the set while filming , and welcomed ideas from his collaborators . He gave the film a satirical , anarchic and visually eclectic bent which the studio had previously warned him away from . It was a commercial and critical disappointment and Suzuki was ostensibly fired for making " movies that make no sense and no money " . Suzuki successfully sued Nikkatsu with support from student groups , like @-@ minded filmmakers and the general public and caused a major controversy through the Japanese film industry . Suzuki was blacklisted and did not make another feature film for 10 years but became a counterculture hero . 
 The film grew a strong following , which expanded overseas in the 1980s , and has established itself as a cult classic . Film critics and enthusiasts now regard it as an absurdist masterpiece . It has been cited as an influence by filmmakers such as Jim Jarmusch , John Woo , Chan @-@ wook Park and Quentin Tarantino , and composer John Zorn . Thirty @-@ four years after Branded to Kill , Suzuki filmed Pistol Opera ( 2001 ) with Nikkatsu , a loose sequel to the former . The company has also hosted two major retrospectives spotlighting his career .

 Goro Hanada , the Japanese underworld 's third @-@ ranked hitman , and his wife , Mami , fly into Tokyo and are met by Kasuga , a formerly ranked hitman turned taxi driver . Kasuga petitions Hanada to assist him in breaking back into the profession . Hanada agrees and the three go to a club owned by the yakuza boss <unk> Yabuhara . The two men are hired to escort a client from Sagami Beach to Nagano . After the meeting , Yabuhara covertly seduces Hanada 's wife . Hanada and Kasuga pick up a car designated for the job which unexpectedly has a corpse in the back seat . They dispose of the body , then meet the client and proceed towards their destination . En route Hanada spots an ambush . He dispatches a number of gunmen while Kasuga panics and flails about in hysterics . <unk> at the mouth , Kasuga charges an <unk> , Koh , the fourth @-@ ranked hitman , and they kill each other . Hanada leaves the client to secure Koh 's car but hears three gunshots and rushes back to find the client is safe and three additional ambushers have been shot cleanly through the forehead . At a second ambush , Hanada kills more gunmen and sets Sakura , the second @-@ ranked hitman , on fire . Sakura madly rushes towards the client but is shot dead by him . On his way home Hanada 's car breaks down . Misako , a mysterious woman with a <unk> , stops and gives him a ride . At home , he has rough sex with his wife , fueled by his obsession with sniffing boiling rice . 
 Yabuhara hires Hanada to kill four men , the first three being a customs officer , an <unk> and a jewellery dealer . Hanada snipes the first from behind a billboard 's animatronic cigarette lighter , shoots the second from a basement up through a pipe drain when the latter leans over the sink and , ordered to finish quickly , blasts his way into the third 's office and escapes on an advertising balloon . Misako then appears at his door and offers him a nearly impossible contract to kill a foreigner , which he cannot refuse having just been told the plan . During the job a butterfly lands on the barrel of his rifle causing him to miss his target and kill an innocent bystander . Misako tells him that he will now lose his rank and be killed . Hanada makes plans to leave the country but is shot by his wife who then sets fire to their apartment and flees . His belt buckle , however , stopped the bullet and he escapes the building . He finds Misako and they go to her apartment . After alternating failed attempts by him to seduce her and them to kill each other she succumbs to his advances when he promises to kill her . Afterwards , he finds he cannot as he has fallen in love with her . In a state of confusion he wanders the streets and passes out on the side of the road . The next day he finds his wife at Yabuhara 's club . She tries to seduce him , then fakes hysteria and tells him Yabuhara paid her to kill him and that the three men he had killed had stolen from Yabuhara 's diamond smuggling operation and the foreigner was an investigator sent by the supplier . Unmoved , Hanada kills her , gets drunk and waits for Yabuhara to return . Yabuhara arrives already dead with a bullet hole through the centre of his forehead . 
 Hanada returns to Misako 's apartment where a film projector has been set up . It depicts Misako bound and tortured and directs him to a breakwater , where the following day he is to be killed . Hanada submits to the demand but kills the killers instead . The former client arrives and announces himself as the legendary Number One Killer . He says he will kill Hanada but , in thanks for the work he has done , is only giving a warning at present . Hanada holes up in Misako 's apartment and Number One begins an extended siege , taunting Hanada with threatening phone calls and forbidding him to leave the apartment . Eventually , Number One moves in with the now exhausted and inebriated Hanada under the pretext that he is deciding how to kill him . They agree to a temporary truce and set times to eat , sleep and , later , to link arms everywhere they go . Number One suggests they eat out one day and then disappears during the meal . At the apartment , Hanada finds a note and another film from Number One stating he will be waiting at a gymnasium with Misako . Hanada waits at the gymnasium but Number One does not show . As a bedraggled Hanada rises to leave , a tape recorder switches on explaining , " This is the way Number One works " , he exhausts you and then kills you . Hanada puts a headband across his forehead and climbs into a boxing ring . Number One appears and shoots him . The headband stops the bullet and Hanada returns fire . Number One slumps to the ground but manages to shoot him a few times before dying . Hanada leaps and staggers around the ring declaring himself the new Number One . Misako enters the arena and , crazed , he instinctively shoots her dead , then falls from the ring .

 Joe Shishido as Goro Hanada , the Number Three Killer : a hitman with a fetish for the smell of boiling rice . He is gainfully employed by the yakuza until a butterfly lands on the barrel of his rifle during a " Devil 's job " . He misses his target and is marked for death — then descends into a world of alcohol and paranoia . Shishido has been called the face of Suzuki 's films , owing in part to their frequent collaborations , this being among the most prominent . After middling success in Nikkatsu melodramas he underwent plastic surgery , enlarging his cheeks several sizes . He returned to tremendous success as a heavy and , soon thereafter , a star .

 = = Production = = 
 The Nikkatsu Company conceived Branded to Kill as a low @-@ budget hitman film , a subgenre of the studio 's yakuza @-@ oriented movies . Their standard B movie shooting schedule was applied , one week for pre @-@ production , 25 days to shoot and three days for post @-@ production . The budget was set at approximately 20 million yen . Shortly before filming began , with the release date already set , the script was deemed " inappropriate " by the head office and contract director Seijun Suzuki was brought in to do a rewrite . Studio head Kyūsaku Hori told Suzuki he had had to read it twice before he understood it . Suzuki suggested they drop the script but was ordered to proceed . The rewrite was done with his frequent collaborator Takeo Kimura and six assistant directors , including Atsushi Yamatoya ( who also played Killer Number Four ) . The eight men had worked under the joint pen name <unk> <unk> ( " Group of Eight " ) since the mid @-@ 1960s . Nikkatsu was building leading man Joe Shishido into a star and assigned him to the film . They specified that the script was to be written with this aim . The film also marks Shishido 's first nude scene . Suzuki originally wanted <unk> Taichi , a new talent from the famous theatre troupe <unk> , for the female lead but she took a part in another film . Instead , Suzuki selected Annu Mari , another new actress who had been working in Nikkatsu 's music halls . In casting the role of Hanada 's wife , Suzuki selected Mariko Ogawa from outside of the studio as none of the contract actresses would do nude scenes . 
 Suzuki did not use storyboards and disliked pre @-@ planning . He preferred to come up with ideas either the night before or on the set as he felt that the only person who should know what is going to happen is the director . He also felt that it was sudden inspiration that made the picture . An example is the addition of the Number Three Killer 's rice @-@ sniffing habit . Suzuki explained that he wanted to present a quintessentially " Japanese " killer , " If he were Italian , he 'd get turned on by macaroni , right ? " Suzuki has commended Shishido on his similar drive to make the action scenes as physical and interesting as possible . In directing his actors , Suzuki let them play their roles as they saw fit and only intervened when they went " off track " . For nude scenes the actors wore <unk> , or adhesive strips , over their genitals in accordance with censorship practices . The film was edited in one day , a task made easy by Suzuki 's method of shooting only the necessary footage . He had picked up the habit during his years working as an assistant director for Shochiku when film stock remained sparse after the war . Post @-@ production was completed on June 14 , 1967 , the day before the film was released . 
 = = Style = = 
 Like many of its yakuza film contemporaries , Branded to Kill shows the influence of the James Bond films and film noir , though the film 's conventional genre basis was combined with satire , kabuki stylistics and a pop art aesthetic . It was further set apart from its peers , and Seijun Suzuki 's previous films , through its gothic sensibilities , unusual atonal score and what artist and academic Philip Brophy called a " heightened otherness " . The result has been alternately ascribed as a work of surrealism , absurdism , the avant garde and included in the Japanese New Wave movement , though not through any stated intention of its director . Suzuki employed a wide variety of techniques and claimed his singular focus was to make the film as entertaining as possible . 
 Genre conventions are satirized and mocked throughout the film . In American noirs , heroes , or anti @-@ heroes , typically strive to be the best in their field . Here the process was formalized into a rankings system obsessed over by its players . The femme fatale — a noir staple — Misako , does not simply entice the protagonist and bring the threat of death but obsesses him and is obsessed with all things death herself . She tries to kill him , wants to kill herself and surrounds herself with dead things . Hanada 's libido is as present as that of the protagonists of similar films of the period , such as James Bond , though perversely exaggerated . Reviewer Rumsey Taylor likened Hanada 's boiled rice sniffing fetish to Bond 's " shaken , not stirred " martini order . The film also deviates from the opening killer @-@ for @-@ hire scenario to touch on such varied subgenres as psychosexual romance , American Gothic thriller and Odd Couple slapstick . 
 The film industry is a subject of satire as well . For example , Japanese censorship often involved masking prohibited sections of the screen . Here Suzuki preemptively masked his own compositions but animated them and incorporated them into the film 's design . In the story , after Hanada finds he is unable to kill Misako he wanders the streets in a state of confusion . The screen is obscured by animated images with accompanying sounds associated to her . The effects contributed to the eclectic visual and sound design while signifying his obsessive love . Author Stephen Teo proposed that the antagonistic relationship between Hanada and Number One may have been analogous of Suzuki 's relationship with studio president Kyūsaku Hori . He compared Hanada 's <unk> to those who had been pressuring Suzuki to rein in his style over the previous two years . Teo cited Number One 's sleeping with his eyes open and urinating where he sits , which the character explains as techniques one must master to become a " top professional . " 
 The film was shot in black and white <unk> ( synonymous with CinemaScope at a 2 @.@ 35 : 1 aspect ratio ) . Due to the wide frame , moving a character forward did not produce the dynamic effect Suzuki desired . Instead , he relied on spotlighting and chiaroscuro imagery to create excitement and suspense . Conventional framing and film grammar were disregarded in favour of spontaneous inspiration . In editing , Suzuki frequently abandoned continuity , favouring abstract jumps in time and space as he found it made the film more interesting . Critic David Chute suggested that Suzuki 's stylistics had intensified — in seeming congruence with the studio 's demands that he conform : 
 You can see the director reusing specific effects and pointedly cranking them up a notch . In Our Blood Will Not Allow It , the two battling brothers had a heart @-@ to @-@ heart in a car that was enveloped , just for the hell of it , in gorgeous blue moiré patterns of drenching rain . This ' lost at sea ' effect is revived in Branded to Kill but there 's no sound at all in this version of the scene , except for the gangsters ' hushed voices , <unk> , plotting some fresh betrayal in a movie @-@ movie isolation chamber .

 Branded to Kill was released to Japanese theatres on June 15 , 1967 , in a double bill with Nishimura <unk> 's Burning Nature . The films were financially unsuccessful and the former fared likewise among critics . Kinema Junpo magazine reported that the films " resulted in less than 2 @,@ 000 viewers at Asakusa and Shinjuku and about 500 at <unk> on the second day . " Both Joe Shishido and Yamatoya Atsushi later recounted having seen Branded to Kill in practically empty theatres , the latter on its opening night . <unk> Kōichi , a critic for the film journal Eiga <unk> , wrote that " the woman buys a mink coat and thinks only about having sex . The man wants to kill and feels nostalgic about the smell of boiling rice . We cannot help being confused . We do not go to theaters to be puzzled . " Nikkatsu Studios had been criticized for catering to rebellious youth audiences , a specialty of contract director Seijun Suzuki , whose films had grown increasingly anarchic through the 1960s . This had earned him a large following but it had also drawn the ire of studio head Kyūsaku Hori . On April 25 , 1968 , Suzuki received a telephone call from a company secretary informing him that he would not be receiving his salary that month . Two of Suzuki 's friends met with Hori the next day and were told , " Suzuki 's films were incomprehensible , that they did not make any money and that Suzuki might as well give up his career as a director as he would not be making films for any other companies . " 
 A student film society run by Kazuko Kawakita , the <unk> Study Group , was planning to include Branded to Kill in a retrospective honouring Suzuki 's works but Hori refused them and withdrew all of his films from circulation . With support from the <unk> , similar student groups , fellow filmmakers and the general public — which included the picketing of the company 's Hibiya offices and the formation of the Seijun Suzuki Joint Struggle Committee — Suzuki sued Nikkatsu for wrongful dismissal . During the three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half year trial the circumstances under which the film was made and Suzuki was fired came to light . He had been made into a scapegoat for the company 's dire financial straits and was meant to serve as an example on the outset of an attempted company @-@ wide restructuring . A settlement was reached on December 24 , 1971 , in the amount of one million yen , a fraction of his original claim , as well as a public apology from Hori . In a separate agreement Branded to Kill and his previous film , Fighting Elegy , were donated to the Tokyo National Museum of Modern Art 's Film Centre . The events turned Suzuki into a legend and shook the film world . Branded to Kill , along with other of his films , played to " packed audiences who wildly applauded " at all @-@ night revivals in and around Tokyo . However , Suzuki was blacklisted by the major studios and did not make another feature film until A Tale of Sorrow and Sadness ( 1977 ) ten years after Branded to Kill . In the meantime , he subsisted on commercial and television work and writing books of essays . 
 Branded to Kill first reached international audiences in the 1980s , featuring in various film festivals and retrospectives dedicated wholly or partially to Suzuki , which was followed by home video releases in the late 1990s . It garnered a reputation as one of his most unconventional , revered Nikkatsu films and an international cult classic . It has been declared a masterpiece by the likes of film critic Chuck Stephens , writer and musician Chris D. , and composer John Zorn and inspired film director Quentin Tarantino . Writer and critic Tony Rayns noted , " Suzuki mocks everything from the clichés of yakuza fiction to the conventions of Japanese censorship in this extraordinary thriller , which rivals Orson Welles ' Lady from Shanghai in its harsh eroticism , not to mention its visual fireworks . " Modified comparisons to the films of a " gonzo Sam Fuller " , or Jean @-@ Luc Godard , assuming one " factor [ s ] out Godard 's politics and self @-@ consciousness " , are not uncommon . In a 1992 Rolling Stone magazine article , film director Jim Jarmusch affectionately recommended it as , " Probably the strangest and most perverse ' hit man ' story in cinema . " Jasper Sharp of the Midnight Eye wrote , " [ It ] is a bloody marvellous looking film and arguably the pinnacle of the director 's strikingly eclectic style . " 
 However , the workings of the plot remain elusive to most . Sharp digressed , " [ T ] o be honest it isn 't the most accessible of films and for those unfamiliar with Suzuki 's unorthodox and seemingly disjointed style it will probably take a couple of viewings before the bare bones of the plot begin to emerge . " As Zorn has put it , " plot and narrative devices take a back seat to mood , music , and the sensuality of visual images . " Japanese film historian Donald Richie thus encapsulated the film , " An inventive and ultimately anarchic take on gangster thrillers . [ The ] script flounders midway and Suzuki tries on the bizarre for its own sake . " David Chute conceded that in labeling the film incomprehensible , " [ i ] f you consider the movie soberly , it 's hard to deny the bosses had a point " . On a conciliatory note , Rayns commented , " Maybe the break with Nikkatsu was inevitable ; it 's hard to see how Suzuki could have gone further in the genre than this . " 
 After another unrelated 10 @-@ year hiatus , Suzuki and Nikkatsu reunited for the Style to Kill retrospective , held in April , 2001 , at Theatre Shinjuku in Tokyo . It featured 28 films by Suzuki , including Branded to Kill . Suzuki appeared at the gala opening with star Annu Mari . Joe Shishido appeared for a talk session at an all @-@ night , four @-@ film screening . An accompanying Branded to Kill visual directory was published . The following year , the <unk> Company produced a limited edition 1 / 6 scale " Joe the Ace " action figure based on Shishido 's character in the film , complete with a miniature rice cooker . In 2006 , Nikkatsu celebrated the 50th anniversary of Suzuki 's directorial debut by hosting the Seijun Suzuki 48 Film Challenge retrospective at the 19th Tokyo International Film Festival . It showcased all of his films . He and Mari were again in attendance .

 As one of Seijun Suzuki 's most influential films , Branded to Kill has been acknowledged as a source of inspiration by such internationally renowned directors as Hong Kong 's John Woo , South Korea 's Chan @-@ wook Park and America 's Jim Jarmusch and Quentin Tarantino . Jarmusch listed it as his favourite hitman film , alongside Le Samouraï ( also 1967 ) , and thanked Suzuki in the screen credits of his own hitman film Ghost Dog : The Way of the Samurai ( 1999 ) . Most notably , Jarmusch mirrored a scene in which the protagonist kills a target by shooting up from a basement through a sink drain . He went so far as to screen the film for Suzuki when the two met in Tokyo . Critics have noted Branded to Kill 's influence on the films of Wong Kar @-@ wai , such as his hitman film Fallen Angels ( 1995 ) , as well as Johnnie To 's <unk> Killer ( 2001 ) . However , Branded to Kill was most influential in its native Japan . The film 's premise , in which hitmen try to kill each other in competition for the Number One rank , is spoofed in films such as Takeshi Kitano 's Getting Any ? ( 1995 ) and Sabu 's Postman Blues ( 1997 ) , which features a character named Hitman Joe . Branded to Kill played a role in the development of the long @-@ running Lupin III franchise . It also had a profound impact , through Suzuki 's firing and the resulting student uprising , in the beginnings of the movement film , usually underground or anti @-@ establishment films which focused on issues of import to audiences , as opposed to production line genre pictures . 
 Thirty @-@ four years after Branded to Kill , Suzuki directed Pistol Opera ( 2001 ) , a loose sequel co @-@ produced by Shochiku and filmed at Nikkatsu . The character Goro Hanada returns as a mentor figure to the new Number Three , played by Makiko <unk> . However , Joe Shishido was replaced by <unk> Hira in the role of Hanada . Suzuki has said that the original intention was for Shishido to play the character again but that the film 's producer , Satoru Ogura , wanted Hira for the role . Reviews were of a favourable nature on par with its predecessor . Jonathan Rosenbaum supposed , " Can I call a film a masterpiece without being sure that I understand it ? I think so ... " Although some , such as Elvis Mitchell for The Village Voice , felt its zeal fell slightly short of the original .

 Branded to Kill was initially made available in Japan by Nikkatsu in VHS format , first on February 10 , 1987 , then a second version on June 10 , 1994 . Both versions were censored for nudity with a black bar obscuring half of the frame during the relevant scenes . The first uncensored release since the film 's theatrical debut was an October 26 , 2001 , DVD from Nikkatsu . It included an interview with Seijun Suzuki , two with Joe Shishido , an Annu Mari photo gallery and the original film trailers for it and several other Suzuki films . The release was one of three linked to the Style to Kill theatrical retrospective . In conjunction with the 50th anniversary of Suzuki 's directorial debut , the film was included in the first of two six @-@ film DVD box sets which was released October 1 , 2006 . All six titles included audio commentary tracks featuring Suzuki with various collaborators , those being Annu Mari and assistant director Masami <unk> for Branded to Kill . 
 The first North American copy surfaced in the early 1990s at Kim 's Video in New York in a video series titled Dark of the Sun devoted to obscure Asian cinema , assembled by John Zorn , albeit without English subtitles . The Criterion Collection released the film in the United States and Canada on laserdisc in 1998 , followed by a DVD on February 23 , 1999 , both containing a 15 @-@ minute interview with Suzuki , poster gallery of Shishido films and liner notes by Zorn . Home Vision Cinema release a VHS version on June 16 , 2000 . Both companies conjunctively released Tokyo Drifter in all three formats in addition to a VHS collection packaging the two films together . In the United Kingdom , Second Sight Films released a DVD on February 25 , 2002 , and a VHS on March 11 , 2002 . Yume Pictures released a new DVD on February 26 , 2007 , as a part of their Suzuki collection , featuring a 36 @-@ minute interview with the director , trailers and liner notes by Tony Rayns . Madman Entertainment 's Eastern Eye label released the film on DVD in Australia and New Zealand on May 2 , 2007 . It also contained the original trailer , a photo gallery and liner notes .

 = M @-@ 89 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 89 is an east – west state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan that runs from near Ganges to Battle Creek . M @-@ 89 starts at an interchange with Interstate 196 / US Highway 31 ( I @-@ 196 / US 31 ) and passes through Allegan , Kalamazoo County , Michigan , and Calhoun counties . The highway also briefly crosses the southwest corner of Barry County before it terminates an at intersection with Business Loop I @-@ 94 ( BL I @-@ 94 ) on the northwestern side of downtown Battle Creek . In between the trunkline runs parallel to the Kalamazoo River through rural southwestern Michigan farmlands while also running through the middle of several smaller towns in the area . 
 Dating back to 1919 , M @-@ 89 was originally just a segment of the current highway between the Ganges area and Martin . Changes through the 1920s and 1930s moved the eastern end to Calhoun County . The last section was paved in the 1950s before the highway was rerouted in the Allegan , Michigan area . The last extensions into Battle Creek came in the 1960s and 1998 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 89 begins at an interchange with I @-@ 196 / US 31 near Ganges , just a half mile ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) from Lake Michigan . The highway travels east on 124th Street from there through farmlands and small communities like Fennville . The trunkline passes wetlands just north of Swan Creek Marsh and crosses the Kalamazoo River about two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of an intersection with M @-@ 40 . M @-@ 89 and M @-@ 40 run concurrently to the southeast for 6 @.@ 5 miles ( 10 @.@ 5 km ) through more farms and across Lake Allegan on the Kalamazoo River on the way into Allegan . Just two blocks before M @-@ 89 splits from M @-@ 40 , the concurrent highways have a junction with M @-@ 222 . After M @-@ 89 splits from M @-@ 40 , it continues out of Allegan to the southeast , again crossing over the Kalamazoo River . 
 After leaving Allegan , M @-@ 89 runs roughly parallel with the Kalamazoo River for approximately 12 miles ( 19 km ) , passing through mostly rural areas with residences and agricultural fields . The highway curves to the east and crosses the Kalamazoo River again just west of the city of Otsego . The trunkline curves to the south in the city then again runs east to junction with US 131 at exit 49 on the west side of Plainwell . East of US 131 , the highway passes through the city of Plainwell and crosses the Kalamazoo River again before continuing into rural areas again . The route heads the southeast on towards the village of Richland . 
 Just north of Richland , M @-@ 89 meets up with M @-@ 43 , and the two share a brief routing together for a mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) as M @-@ 43 heads southwest out of Richland while M @-@ 89 heads east , passing to the south of Gull Lake . After passing the lake , the highway turns southeast towards Battle Creek . As M @-@ 89 begins to enter the outskirts of Battle Creek it follows Michigan Avenue . It passes through the neighborhoods of Level Park @-@ Oak Park and Urbandale , the first residential areas of the city . As the highway continues towards Battle Creek it has a junction with M @-@ 37 . M @-@ 89 continues on Michigan Avenue until an intersection with Washington Avenue where the route turns to the southwest where it crosses the Kalamazoo River one last time . The trunkline terminates a few blocks later at Dickman Road , otherwise known as the Business Loop I @-@ 94 ( BL I @-@ 94 ) . 
 M @-@ 89 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) like other state highways in Michigan . As a part of these maintenance responsibilities , the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction . These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic , which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway . MDOT 's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M @-@ 89 were the 26 @.@ 470 vehicles daily between Otsego and Plainwell ; the lowest counts were the 2 @,@ 879 vehicles per day between Fennville and the I @-@ 196 / US 31 interchange . No section of M @-@ 89 has been listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . 
 = = History = = 
 The July 1 , 1919 , incarnation of M @-@ 89 was much shorter relative to today 's road . Its western terminus was at a junction with M @-@ 11 ( later US 31 , now A @-@ 2 ) near Ganges . It traveled east to Fennville then turned south to Pearl before turning back to the east towards Allegan on an alignment that is a few miles south of the present day configuration . The highway then left Allegan on present day M @-@ 222 and terminated at M @-@ 13 , which is now A @-@ 45 east of the US 131 freeway . 
 In 1926 , when M @-@ 40 was extended , M @-@ 89 was rerouted out of Allegan to the southeast along its present day alignment to terminate at US 131 in Plainwell . Just a few years later , the road was extended further to the southeast to Richland then east along its present day routing to end at M @-@ 96 in Augusta . In 1931 , the route was realigned to run east , rather than south into Augusta , where it then met up with M @-@ 96 just inside the Calhoun County line . The road remained in this fashion for the next 20 years . 
 In late 1951 or early 1952 , the last section of M @-@ 89 was paved , a segment south and east of Fennville in Allegan County . Just months later , the highways was realigned to run east from Fennville , rather than south to Pearl , to intersect M @-@ 40 . From there it was rerouted to run concurrently into Allegan . 
 In 1963 , when the I @-@ 196 / US 131 freeway opened , the western terminus of M @-@ 89 was extended to meet the new freeway . A few years later , when M @-@ 96 was realigned onto a route that took it into Battle Creek , M @-@ 89 was extended southeasterly along Michigan Avenue ( the old M @-@ 96 ) and terminated at M @-@ 37 . The highway was extended further southeasterly into Battle Creek to replace the old routing of M @-@ 37 along Michigan Avenue ; it then turned south on Washington to the BL I @-@ 94 where it terminated , thus bringing the route to its current alignment .

 = John Bauer ( illustrator ) = 
 John Albert Bauer ( 4 June 1882 – 20 November 1918 ) was a Swedish painter and illustrator . His work is concerned with landscape and mythology , but he also composed portraits . He is best known for his illustrations of early editions of Bland <unk> och troll ( Among Gnomes and Trolls ) , an anthology of Swedish folklore and fairy tales . 
 Bauer was born and raised in Jönköping . At 16 he moved to Stockholm to study at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts . While there he received his first commissions to illustrate stories in books and magazines , and met the artist Ester Ellqvist , whom he married in 1906 . He traveled throughout Lappland , Germany and Italy early in his career , and these cultures deeply informed his work . He painted and illustrated in a romantic nationalistic style , in part influenced by the Italian Renaissance and Sami cultures . Most of his works are watercolors or prints in monochrome or muted colours ; he also produced oil paintings and frescos . His illustrations and paintings broadened the understanding and appreciation of Swedish folklore , fairy tales and landscape . 
 When Bauer was 36 , he , Ester and their son , Bengt , drowned in a shipwreck on Lake Vättern .

 = = = Early life and education = = = 
 John Bauer was born and raised in Jönköping , the son of Josef Bauer , a man of Bavarian origin , and Emma Charlotta Wadell , from a farming family from the town <unk> just outside Jönköping . Josef Bauer came to Sweden in 1863 , penniless . He founded a successful charcuterie business at the Östra <unk> in Jönköping . The family lived in the apartment above the shop until 1881 when the construction of their house in Sjövik was completed . John , born in 1882 , lived at the Villa Sjövik by the shore of Lake <unk> with his parents and two brothers , one older and one younger ; his only sister died at a young age . The family home would remain central to him long after he lived on his own . His initial schooling was at the Jönköpings <unk> <unk> <unk> ( The Jönköping Public School of Higher Education ) , followed by the Jönköpings <unk> <unk> ( The Jönköping Technical School ) from 1892 to 1898 . He spent most of his time drawing caricatures of his teachers and daydreaming , something not appreciated by his teachers . 
 He was given to sketching and drawing from an early age , without encouragement from his family . However , when he turned sixteen and wanted to go to Stockholm to study art , they were enthusiastic for him and backed him financially . In 1898 , he was one of the 40 applicants to study at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts , and although he was deemed well qualified for a place at the academy , he was too young to be accepted . He spent the next two years at the Kaleb <unk> school for painters . During this time he was , like most teenagers , torn between hope and despair , something that is reflected in his artwork . 
 By 1900 , he was old enough to attend the Academy of Arts , and was one of the three students admitted that year ; the two other successful applicants were his friends Ivar <unk> and Pontus Lanner . He studied traditional illustrations and made drawings of plants , medieval costumes and croquis ; all of which served him in his later work . One of his teachers , professor and noted historic painter , Gustaf <unk> praised Bauer : 
 His art is what I would call great art , in his almost miniaturized works he gives an impression of something much more powerful than many monumental artists can accomplice on acres of canvas . It is not size that matters but content . 
 While at the academy , he received his first commissions to illustrate magazines ( including the <unk> @-@ Nisse and <unk> ) and books ( e.g. De <unk> <unk> , <unk> saga and <unk> , <unk> sedan ) . In 1904 he traveled to Lappland to create paintings for a book on the culture of the county and its " exotic wilderness " . At the end of 1905 , he left the academy and put " Artist " on his business card . 
 = = = Journey to Lappland = = = 
 Following the discovery of iron ore deposits in the north of Sweden , Lappland became a frontier for industrial development , instead of an exotic wilderness of the Sami culture and midnight sun . <unk> , Carl Adam Victor Lundholm published a his Lappland , det stora svenska <unk> ( Lappland , the great Swedish land of the future ) . He engaged noted Swedish artists — such as Karl <unk> , Alfred <unk> , Per Daniel Holm and Hjalmar Lindberg — to create the illustrations . Since Bauer was an inexperienced illustrator by comparison , Lundholm tested his abilities by sending him to create some drawings of Sami people at Skansen . 
 Although reluctant to audition for the commission , on 15 July 1904 Bauer left for Lappland and stayed there for a month . Coming from the dense , dark forests of Småland he was overwhelmed by the open vistas and colorful landscapes . His encounters with the Sami people and their culture became important for his later works . He took many photos , sketched and made notes of the tools , costumes and objects he saw , but he had difficulty becoming close to the Sami , due to their shyness . He recorded his experiences in his diary and in letters to his family and friends . After a visit to a Sami <unk> he noted : " All light from above . If the head is tilted forward it is dark . The lit parts of the figure always lighter than the tent canvas . Sharp shadows run like spokes from the middle of the <unk> . " 
 The book on Lappland was published in 1908 , with eleven watercolors by Bauer . They were painted Stockholm , almost 18 months after his visit , using the photos and sketches he had collected during his journey . Many of the photos resulted in other drawings and paintings . Most of these were romanticized versions of the photos , but he succeeded in capturing the nuances and ambiance of the <unk> , and the richness of the Sami garments and crafts . Details from the Sami culture , such as the bent knives , shoes , spears , pots and belts , became important elements in the clothes and ornamentations of Bauer 's trolls . Bauer 's eye for detail and his numerous notes also made the material an ethnographic documentation of the era . 
 = = = Courtship and marriage = = = 
 Bauer met fellow student Ester Ellqvist at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts . Ellqvist studied at the separate department for women , since women were not allowed to attend the same classes as the men and their education was conducted in a different manner . So , while Ellqvist was talented and ambitious , she did not have an equal opportunity as her male colleagues to develop her artistry . 
 Bauer started courting her in 1903 , but since they were apart most of the time , this was done by mail . Their relationship developed as they shared their dreams , aspirations , doubts and insecurities in their correspondence . For Bauer , Ellqvist became his inspiration , muse , and " fairy princess " ; it was as such he painted her for the first time in <unk> ( The Fairy Princess ) . He made sketches for the painting in 1904 , and finalized them in an oil painting in 1905 . Ellqvist is portrayed as a strong , enlightened and unobtainable Valkyrie . The painting was shown at Bauer 's first exhibition at the <unk> Academy in Gothenburg in 1905 ( where he was one of eleven debutants ) and in Norrköping in 1906 , where it was sold to a private collector . It is now in the Jönköpings läns museum . Bauer tried to mold Ellqvist into his vision of a creature of the woods and as the perfect artist 's wife ; he wanted her to make a home for them in a romantic cottage in the woods , while he wandered about the forest seeking inspiration . 
 Ellqvist , on the other hand , had been raised in Stockholm and was a lively person who enjoyed the social life that could only be found in towns or cities . She wanted to settle down in a comfortable place with a husband and have children . Bauer was not sufficiently established an artist to provide for a family ; throughout his entire lifetime he relied on his parents for financial support . When he proposed to Ellqvist , Bauer did so without the approval of his parents , who thought that he should be more established in a career and self @-@ supporting before marriage . 
 On 18 December 1906 , Bauer and Ellqvist were married . Little is known of their first years together since they now lived in the same house , making letters unnecessary . Bauer had jobs illustrating covers for magazines , like Hvar 8 Dag , and began work on Bland <unk> och troll ( Among Gnomes and Trolls ) . In 1908 , John and Ester traveled to Italy together ; on their return they found a house , the " Villa <unk> " , situated on the shores of Lake Bunn just outside <unk> . They bought the house in 1914 , and the following year their son Bengt ( called " Putte " ) was born . The birth of Putte marked a harmonious and joyful time for the couple . Bauer made his final illustrations for Among Gnomes and Trolls , his grand farewell to the series , which freed him to explore playwriting and make frescos . He showed his paintings at exhibitions and experimented with modernism , but all this came at a cost . Bauer was often away , leaving Ellqvist alone at home , and he no longer had the steady income that the illustrations had provided . By 1917 , their marriage was in trouble , and in 1918 , Bauer put his thoughts about a divorce in a letter to his wife . 
 Over time , Bauer used Ellqvist as a model less frequently . With the birth of their son , Bauer started to paint pictures with children as part of the composition . The painting <unk> ( The Root Trolls ) , completed in 1917 , is of Putte sleeping among troll @-@ shaped roots in a forest . 
 = = = Journey to Italy = = = 
 Bauer and his wife could to make the long journey at Josef 's expense in 1909 . They choose to travel through Germany and on to Italy based on his readings of medieval towns during a 1902 visit to Germany with his father . The couple visited Verona , Florence , Siena and spent two months in Volterra . They continued through Naples and Capri , spending the winter in Rome . 
 Throughout their travels they studied art and visited churches and museums , which appealed to Bauer 's eclectic mind . In the evenings they went to small <unk> to enjoy the ambiance ; all of which is recorded in the letters they sent home to Bauer 's family . Bauer 's sketchbooks are full of studies of antique objects and Renaissance art , some of which he used for his illustrations . A portrait of Ghirlandaio by Sandro Botticelli is said to be the basis for <unk> ( The Swan maiden ) , and Piero della Francesca 's work was the inspiration for Den <unk> Martin ( Saint Martin , the Holy ) . He also became intrigued by frescoes . He was exuberant in the study of art , but he also became homesick for the quiet serenity of the Swedish forest which resulted in some of his best winter pictures with white snow , dark woods and the sky glittering with tiny stars . 
 Their journey was abandoned after a murder in their building in Rome . Bauer was interrogated by Italian police due to a misunderstanding . He was never a suspect but the situation became public , leaving a bitter memory of their visit to Rome . 
 = = = Death on Lake Vättern = = = 
 Bauer , Ester and their two @-@ year @-@ old son , Bengt , were on their way to their new home in Stockholm , where Bauer hoped for spiritual renewal and a new life for himself and his family . A recent , well @-@ publicized train accident at <unk> caused Bauer to book their return to Stockholm by boat , the Per Brahe steamer . 
 On the night of 19 November 1918 , when the steamer left <unk> it was loaded with iron stoves , plowshares , sewing machines and barrels of produce . All the cargo did not fit into the hold and a significant portion was stored unsecured on deck , making the ship top @-@ heavy . The weather was bad and by the time the steamer was at sea a full storm was raging ; the wind caused the cargo on deck to shift , some of it falling overboard , further destabilizing the ship . The ship capsized and went down , stern first , just 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 feet ) from the next port , <unk> , killing all 24 people on board , including the Bauers . Most of the passengers had been trapped in their cabins . 
 The wreckage was found on 22 November 1918 at a depth of 32 metres ( 105 feet ) , salvaged on 12 August 1922 . Investigations indicated that just one third of the cargo had been stowed in the hold , the rest unsecured on deck . The salvage operation turned into a bizarre public attraction ; for example , a sewing machine from the steamer was smashed into pieces and sold for one crown each . It is estimated that about 20 @,@ 000 people came to watch the raising of the ship , requiring the addition of trains from Norrköping . Newsreels featuring the raising of the ship were shown in cinemas all over Sweden . In order to finance the salvage operation , the Per Brahe was sent on a macabre tour throughout Sweden . The newspapers fed people 's superstitions that the mythical creatures of the forests had claimed Bauer by sinking the ship . The most common theme was connected to the tale Agneta och <unk> ( Agneta and the Sea King ) from 1910 in which the Sea King lures a maiden into the depths . On 18 August 1922 , the Bauers were buried at the Östra cemetery in Jönköping ( in quarter 04 plot number 06 ) . 
 = = = Bauer , the person = = = 
 Bauer consistently and privately doubted himself . He considered the praise he received for his pictures of trolls and princesses to be " a nice pat on the head for making funny pictures for children " . He wanted to paint in oil and make what he called " real art " , but he needed the money he received for his illustrations . His self @-@ doubts were contrary to his public persona and how he presented himself in self @-@ portraits : strong minded but self @-@ deprecating . 
 = = Career = = 
 = = = Subjects = = = 
 Bauer 's favorite subject was Swedish nature , the dense forests where the light trickled down through the tree canopies . Ever since he was little he had wandered in the dark woods of Småland imagining all the creatures living there . His paintings frequently included detailed depictions of plants , mosses , lichens and mushrooms found in the Swedish woods . He is best known for his illustrations of Among Gnomes and Trolls . 
 In a 1953 article in Allers <unk> @-@ journal ( Allers Family Journal ) , his friend Ove Eklund stated that " although [ Bauer ] only mumbled about and never said clearly " , he believed that all the creatures he drew actually existed . Eklund had on several occasions accompanied Bauer on his walks through the forests by Lake Vättern , and Bauer 's description of all the things he thought existed made Eklund feel he could see them as well . 
 Ove Eklund on Bauer : 
 Yes , there he was , John Bauer , with his brown , eternal pipe glued to the corner of his mouth . Now and then he blew a small cloud of brown troll smoke straight up into the turquoise @-@ bleu , sun @-@ sparkling space . And muttered something far behind his tight , narrow lips — not always so easy to decipher . But I , having had the key for many years , understood most of it . 
 = = = Inspiration = = = 
 Bauer and his friends were part of a generation of Swedish painters who started their careers just before the Modernism movement began to flourish , but at the same time were considerably younger than those dominating the Swedish art scene : artists such as Carl Larsson , Anders Zorn and Bruno Liljefors . Bauer was inspired by these artists , but from his heritage came in contact with Fritz Erler , Max Klinger and other German illustrators . He lived in an era when the Old Norse were romanticized throughout Scandinavia , and borrowed ideas and motifs from artists like Theodor <unk> and Erik <unk> , yet his finished works were in his own style . After his journey to Italy his works clearly showed elements from the 14th century Renaissance . The pictures of princes and princesses had elements from <unk> tapestries , and even the trolls garments were pleated , much like the draped clothing seen in antique Roman sculptures . 
 = = = Style = = = 
 Bauer had a time consuming technique when painting : he would start with a small sketch , no bigger than a stamp , with just the basic shapes . Then he would make another , slightly bigger , sketch with more details . The sketches grew progressively in size and detail until the work reached its final size . Most of the originals for About Gnomes and Trolls are square pictures about 20 to 25 centimetres ( 7 @.@ 9 to 9 @.@ 8 inches ) . He doodled on anything at hand , from used stationary to the back of an envelope . Many of his sketches resemble cartoon strips where the pictures get bigger and more detailed . He would also do several versions of the same finished picture , such as one where the motif is depicted in a summer and winter scene . He did not observe the traditional hierarchy in the mediums or techniques at that time . He could make a complete work in pencil or charcoal just as well as a sketch in oil . 
 From an early age Bauer had to adapt his illustrations to contemporary printing technique . Full @-@ color was expensive , so the illustrations were made in one color plus black . As the process developed and his works became in greater demand , his pictures were eventually printed in full color . 
 = = = Watercolor = = = 
 The most noted of Bauer 's pictures are his watercolors , the technique he used when illustrating for books and magazines ; he alternated between <unk> and gouache . When he created illustrations the two mediums were sometimes mixed , since he needed both the speed of the <unk> and the contrast and impasto that the gouache provided . These water @-@ soluble , and fast drying , media allowed Bauer to work on his pictures until the last minute before deadline , something he was prone to do . 
 = = = Among Gnomes and Trolls = = = 
 In 1907 , Bauer was asked by the <unk> & Åkerlund publishing house ( now Bonnier Group ) to illustrate their new series of books , Among Gnomes and Trolls . The books would be published annually , and contain stories by prominent Swedish authors . The majority of Bauer 's pictures for the book were full @-@ page watercolor illustrations in a muted color scheme ; he also contributed with covers , vignettes and other smaller illustrations . Bauer 's most significant creatures , the trolls , were rendered in shades of gray , green , and brown , the colors of the forests , as if these beings had grown from the landscape itself . Due to the <unk> of the technology available to his printers , the 1907 – 10 editions were produced in just two colors : black and yellow . Some of Bauer 's original paintings for these prints were in full color . 
 In 1911 , when Bauer again was asked to illustrate the book , he made it clear to the publisher that he wanted to retain his pictures along with the copyrights after publication . The publishing house had kept the original illustrations for the previous editions and considered them their property . Bauer was backed up in his request by other artists facing the same problem . The publishers did not budge from their position and without Bauer 's illustrations , book sales dropped . 
 The publisher yielded to Bauer for the 1912 edition ; he was again illustrating his own book . Printing techniques had also been updated and the pictures could be printed in three colors : black , yellow and blue . With this technical improvement , the prints almost resembled Bauer 's original paintings . 
 Bauer illustrated the 1913 – 15 editions , printed in the same three colors as previously . 1913 marked the peak of his performance in these books , and Bauer 's illustrations from that edition are among the most reproduced of his works . In 1914 , his illustrations started to be influenced by the Italian Renaissance . At that time Bauer wanted to stop illustrating the series , but was contractually obligated to illustrate one more edition . 1915 was the last year he worked with trolls and gnomes ; he said he " was done with them and wanted to move on " . The war in Europe had altered Bauer 's vision of the world and he stated that he could no longer imagine it as a fairy tale . 
 = = = Tuvstarr = = = 
 <unk> sitter Tuvstarr <unk> och ser ner i <unk> ( Still , Tuvstarr sits and gazes down into the water ) , painted in 1913 , is one of Bauer 's most noted works . 
 Until the 1980s , the most reproduced and publicized of Bauer 's works were two paintings depicting the princess and the moose from Sagan om <unk> <unk> och <unk> <unk> Tuvstarr ( The Tale of the Moose Hop and the Little Princess Cotton Grass ) , published in 1913 . The first picture is of the princess riding on the moose and the second is of the moose standing guard over the sleeping princess . They were mainly used as pictures on the wall in nurseries . The same tale also contains the picture of Tuvstarr gazing down into the tarn looking for her lost heart , an allegory of innocence lost . Bauer made several studies of this motif . During the 1980s the painting of Tuvstarr and the tarn was used in advertising for a shampoo . This started a debate in Sweden about how works of art , considered part of the national heritage , should be used . In 1999 , the picture again appeared in advertising , this time in a manipulated version in which all the trees had been cut down and Tuvstarr seemed to be lamenting them . The award @-@ winning advertising campaign was made by the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation and helped further the newly awakened environmental movement in Sweden . In his biography on Bauer , Gunnar Lindqvist argues that the picture has become too commercialized . 
 = = = Oil painting = = = 
 Bauer created most of his major works in oil at the beginning of his career , since this was the traditional technique taught at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts . The trip to northern Sweden resulted in many sketches and watercolors for the Lappland book , but also in an oil on canvas entitled , <unk> ( 1904 ) . From 1903 to 1905 , he made several portraits and landscapes influenced by Expressionism . He also made his first oil of Ester , The Fairy Princess , a painting with elements from the Pre @-@ Raphaelites . This work indicates what kind of paintings Bauer wanted to do , but his commissions from illustrating " Among <unk> and trolls " got in the way . He wrote that he " felt like a Jack @-@ of @-@ all @-@ trades " , and made regular outbursts in letters to editors and publishers asking for his help , saying that he " had to work , he wanted a future painting in oil and the rest be damned " . By the time he ceased painting his trolls and gnomes , he was tired and worn out and turned to other venues such as scenography , writing a compendium on drawing to be used in schools , and starting with frescos . He never got to revisit oil painting fully before he drowned . 
 = = = Large works = = = 
 As in his earlier works at the academy , Bauer showed an interest in large frescos and , after his visit to Italy , this interest grew . His first chance to create a major work using this technique was in 1912 , when he completed a 1 @.@ 5 @-@ by @-@ 1 @.@ 5 @-@ metre ( 4 ft 11 in by 4 ft 11 in ) fresco @-@ secco mural , Vill @-@ <unk> , at the home of publisher Erik Åkerlund . In 1913 , he was asked to do a fresco for the Odd Fellows lodge in Nyköping , Den <unk> Martin ( Saint Martin , the Holy ) . At the same time , the new Stockholm Court House was under construction . Contests regarding decorations for the building were held , and most of the noted Swedish artists at that time presented entries and suggestions . Bauer made a number of sketches for these competitions , but his confidence failed and he did not submit any of his drafts . 
 Bauer 's last large work was an oil painting for the auditorium at the Karlskrona <unk> ( The Karlskrona School for Girls ) in 1917 . It depicts <unk> , the old Norse goddess of fertility . Ester posed nude for the painting ; Bauer shows her as strong , sensual and forceful . Their friends teasingly called it the " breast picture of Mrs. Bauer " .

Bauer 's works have influenced <unk> <unk> , Kay Nielsen , Brian Froud , Rebecca <unk> , and other illustrators . In his biography on Bauer , Gunnar Lindqvist states that : " Although Bauer 's work is sometimes credited to have influenced that of Arthur Rackham , and vice versa , these artists did not come in contact with each other 's works until the 1910s when they had already established their own style . Any similarities must therefore be credited to their common inspirations by the romantic Munich art of the late 1800s and the art of Albrecht Dürer . " 
 In Jönköping , a memorial in honour of Bauer stands in the Town park , which was created in 1931 by Swedish sculptor Carl <unk> . <unk> also made a bust in bronze of Bauer , which sits in the National Portrait Gallery at <unk> Castle . 
 Celebrating John Bauer 's centennial birthday in 1982 , the Swedish postal service issued three stamps with motifs from Among Gnomes and Trolls . Four more were issued in 1997 .

 = Dunster = 
 Dunster is a village , civil parish and former manor within the English county of Somerset , today just within the north @-@ eastern boundary of the Exmoor National Park . It lies on the Bristol Channel coast 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 km ) south @-@ southeast of Minehead and 20 miles ( 32 km ) northwest of Taunton . The United Kingdom Census of 2011 recorded a parish population of 817 . 
 Iron Age hillforts testify to occupation of the area for thousands of years . The village grew up around Dunster Castle which was built on the Tor by the Norman warrior William I de Moyon ( d. post 1090 ) shortly after the Norman Conquest of 1066 . The Castle is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 . From that time it was the caput of the Feudal barony of Dunster . The Castle was remodelled on several occasions by the Luttrell family who were lords of the manor from the 14th to 20th centuries . The <unk> Dunster Priory was established in about 1100 . The Priory Church of St George , dovecote and tithe barn are all relics from the Priory . 
 The village became a centre for wool and cloth production and trade , of which the Yarn Market , built by George Luttrell ( <unk> ) , is a relic . There existed formerly a harbour , known as Dunster Haven , at the mouth of the River Avill , yet today the coast having receded is now about 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) from the village and no sign of the harbour can be seen on the low lying marshes between the village and the coast . Dunster has a range of heritage sites and cultural attractions which combine with the castle to make it a popular tourist destination with many visitors arriving on the West Somerset Railway , a heritage railway running from <unk> to Bishops Lydeard . 
 The village lies on the route of the Macmillan Way West , Somerset Way and Celtic Way Exmoor Option . 
 = = Name = = 
 The name Dunster derives from an earlier name Torre ( " tor , rocky hill " ) , recorded in the Domesday Book written twenty years after the Norman conquest . The origin of the prefix is uncertain , although it may well refer to Dunn , a Saxon noble who held land in nearby Elworthy and Willett before the conquest , giving <unk> meaning Dunn 's craggy hill . 
 The historian David Nash Ford proposed Dunster as a possible location of the Cair <unk> listed by the History of the Britons as one of the 28 cities of Britain . 
 = = History = = 
 Within 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) of the village itself are several Iron Age hillforts showing evidence of early human occupation . These include Bat 's Castle and Black Ball Camp on Gallox Hill , Long Wood Enclosure and a similar earthwork on Grabbist Hill . 
 Dunster is mentioned as a manor and Dunster Castle as belonging to William I de Moyon ( alias de <unk> , also de Mohun ) in the 1086 Domesday Book . After the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century , he constructed a timber castle on the site as part of the pacification of Somerset . A stone shell keep was built on the motte by the start of the 12th century , and the castle survived a siege during the early years of the Anarchy . At the end of the 14th century the de Mohuns sold the castle to the Luttrell family , who continued to occupy the property until the late 20th century . During the English Civil War , Dunster was initially held as a garrison for the Royalists . It fell to the Parliamentarians in 1645 and orders were sent out for the castle to be demolished . However , these were not carried out , and the castle remained the garrison for Parliamentarian troops until 1650 . Dunster is regularly home to Taunton Garrison who re @-@ enact plays , battles , and life in the civil war . Major alterations to the castle were undertaken by Henry Fownes Luttrell who had acquired it through marriage to Margaret Fownes @-@ Luttrell in 1747 . Following the death of Alexander Luttrell in 1944 , the family was unable to afford the death duties on his estate . The castle and surrounding lands were sold off to a property firm , the family continuing to live in the castle as tenants . The Luttrells bought back the castle in 1954 , but in 1976 Colonel Walter Luttrell gave Dunster Castle and most of its contents to the National Trust , which operates it as a tourist attraction . It is a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument . 
 Dunster Priory was established as a Benedictine monastery around 1100 . The first church in Dunster was built by William de Mohun who gave the church and the tithes of several manors and two fisheries , to the Benedictine Abbey at Bath . The priory , which was situated just north of the church , became a cell of the abbey . The church was shared for worship by the monks and the parishioners , however this led to several conflicts between them . One outcome was the carved rood screen which divided the church in two with the parish using the west chancel and the monks the east . The priory church is now in parochial use as the Priory Church of St George which still contains 12th and 13th century work , although most of the current building is from the 15th century . It has been designated as a Grade I listed building . In 1332 it became more separated from the Abbey at Bath and became a priory in its own right . In the " Valor Ecclesiasticus " of 1535 the net annual income of the Dunster Tithe Barn is recorded as being £ <unk> ( £ 37 <unk> ) , with £ <unk> ( £ <unk> ) being passed on to the priory in Bath . In 1346 Cleeve Abbey built a nunnery in Dunster , but it was never inhabited by nuns and was used as a guest house . The priory was dissolved as part of the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539 . Dunster was part of the hundred of Carhampton , but St George 's was the seat of the local deanery , overseeing the area 's parish churches . 
 Dunster had become a centre for woollen and clothing production by the 13th century , with the market dating back to at least 1222 , and a particular kind of kersey or broadcloth became known as ' <unk> ' . The prosperity of Dunster was based on the wool trade , with profits helping to pay for the construction of the tower of the Priory Church of St George and provide other amenities . The 15th century Gallox Bridge was one of the main routes over the River Avill on the southern outskirts . The market was held in " The Shambles " however these shops were demolished in 1825 and now only the Yarn Market remains . 
 Dunster Beach , which includes the mouth of the River Avill , is located half a mile from the village , and used to have a significant harbour , known as Dunster Haven , which was used for the export of wool from Saxon times ; however , it was last used in the 17th century and has now disappeared , as new land was laid down among the dykes , meadows and marshes near the shore . During the Second World War , considerable defences were built along the coast as a part of British anti @-@ invasion preparations , though the north coast of Somerset was an unlikely invasion site . Some of the structures remain to this day . Most notable are the pillboxes on the foreshore of Dunster Beach . These are strong buildings made from pebbles taken from the beach and bonded together with concrete . From these , soldiers could have held their ground if the Germans had ever invaded . The beach site has a number of privately owned beach huts ( or chalets as some owners call them ) along with a small shop , a tennis court and a putting green . The chalets , measuring 18 by 14 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 by 4 @.@ 3 m ) , can be let out for holidays ; some owners live in them all the year round . 
 = = Governance = = 
 The parish council has responsibility for local issues , including setting an annual precept to cover the council ’ s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny . The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police , district council officers , and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime , security , and traffic . The parish council 's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities , as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance , repair , and improvement of highways , drainage , footpaths , public transport , and street cleaning . Conservation matters ( including trees and listed buildings ) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council . 
 The village falls within the Non @-@ metropolitan district of West Somerset , which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 ; previously it was part of Williton Rural District . The district council is responsible for local planning and building control , local roads , council housing , environmental health , markets and fairs , refuse collection and recycling , cemeteries and crematoria , leisure services , parks , and tourism . The larger and most expensive local services such as education , social services , libraries , main roads , public transport , policing and fire services , trading standards , waste disposal and strategic planning are the responsibility of Somerset County Council . 
 As Dunster falls within the Exmoor National Park , some functions normally administered by district or county councils have , since 1997 , fallen under the Exmoor National Park Authority , which is known as a ' single @-@ purpose ' authority , whose purpose is to " conserve and enhance the natural beauty , wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks " and " promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the Parks by the public " , including responsibility for the conservation of the historic environment . 
 Dunster is the most populous area of the electoral ward named ' Dunster and <unk> ' . The ward extends North East to the Bristol Channel and South West to Timberscombe . The total population at the 2011 Census was 1 @,@ 219 . 
 It is also part of the Bridgwater and West Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom . It elects one Member of parliament ( MP ) by the first past the post system of election , and is part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament ; the constituency elects seven MEPs using the d 'Hondt method of party @-@ list proportional representation . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Dunster Castle was positioned on a steep , 200 @-@ foot ( 61 m ) high hill . Geologically , the hill is an outcrop of Hangman Grits , a type of red sandstone . During the early medieval period the sea reached the base of the hill , close to the mouth of the River Avill , offering a natural defence and making the village an inland port . 
 Nearby is the Dunster Park and <unk> Site of Special Scientific Interest noted for nationally important lowland dry heath , dry lowland acid grassland , wood @-@ pasture with veteran trees and ancient semi @-@ natural oak woodland habitats . The fauna of the lowland heath includes the Heath fritillary ( <unk> <unk> ) , a nationally rare butterfly . The assemblage of beetles associated with the veteran trees is of national significance because of the variety and abundance of species . 
 Along with the rest of South West England , Dunster has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England . The mean annual temperature in the area is 8 @.@ 3 ° C ( 46 @.@ 9 ° F ) with a seasonal and diurnal variation , but due to the modifying effect of the sea the range is less than in most other parts of the UK . January is the coldest month , with mean minimum temperatures between 1 and 2 ° C ( 34 and 36 ° F ) . July and August are the warmest months in the region , with mean daily maxima around 21 ° C ( 70 ° F ) .

 Dunster was the birthplace of the song " All Things Bright and Beautiful " when Cecil Alexander was staying with Mary Martin , the daughter of one of the owners of Martins Bank . The nearby hill , Grabbist , was originally heather @-@ covered before its reforestation and was described as the " Purple @-@ headed mountain " . 
 On the evening of 1 May each year the Minehead Hobby Horse visits Dunster and is received at the Castle . A local newspaper printed in May 1863 says " The origin professes to be in commemoration of the wreck of a vessel at Minehead in remote times , or the advent of a sort of phantom ship which entered the harbour without Captain or crew . Once the custom was encouraged , but now is much neglected , and perhaps soon will fall into desuetude . " Another conjecture about its origin is that the hobby horse was the ancient King of the May . The Hobby Horse tradition begins with the waking of the inhabitants of Minehead by the beating of a loud drum . The hobby horse dances its way about the town and on to Dunster Castle . 
 Annually on the third Friday in August the village hosts the well known Dunster Show where local businesses and producers come together to showcase the very best that Exmoor and West Somerset has to offer . A major part of the show is the showing of livestock especially horses , cattle and <unk> 2015 show was the 169th show . 
 A more recent tradition ( started in 1987 ) is Dunster by Candlelight which takes place every year on the first Friday and Saturday in December when this remarkably preserved medieval village turns its back on the present and lights its streets with candles . To mark the beginning of the festival on Friday at 5 pm , there is the Lantern Lighting Procession that starts on the Steep and continues through the village until all the lanterns in the streets have been lit . The procession of children and their families is accompanied by colourful stilt walkers in costumes who put up the lanterns . 
 The old English Christmas tradition of burning the Ashen faggot takes place at the Luttrell Arms hotel every Christmas Eve . The pub was formerly a guest house for the Abbots of Cleeve ; its oldest section dates from 1443 . 
 The Priory Church of St George is predominantly 15th century with evidence of 12th- and 13th century work . It has been designated as a Grade I listed building . The church was started by William de Moyon during the 11th century . The tower was built by Jon Marys of <unk> who received a contract from the parish in 1442 . He was paid 13s 4d ( approx . <unk> ) for each foot in height and £ 1 for the pinnacles . The work was completed in three years . <unk> were added in 1504 . 
 The church was shared for worship between the monks of Dunster Priory and the parishioners , however this led to several conflicts between them . One outcome was the carved rood screen which divided the church in two with the parish using the west chancel and the monks the east . It was restored in 1875 – 77 by George Edmund Street . The church has a cruciform plan with a central four @-@ stage tower , built in 1443 with diagonal buttresses , a stair turret and single bell @-@ chamber windows .

 Dunster , in Exmoor National Park , has many listed buildings including 200 Grade II , two Grade I and two Grade II * . 
 The 17th century Yarn Market is a market cross which was probably built in 1609 by the Luttrell family who were the local lords of the manor to maintain the importance of the village as a market , particularly for wool and cloth . The Yarn Market is an octagonal building constructed around a central pier . The tiled roof provides shelter from the rain . The building contains a hole in one of the roof beams , a result of cannon fire in the Civil War . A bell at the top was rung to indicate the start of trading . 
 Nearby was an older cross known as the Butter Cross which was constructed in the late 14th or early 15th century and once stood in the High Street , possibly at the southern end of the high street , and was moved to its current location on the edge of the village possibly in 1825 , however a drawing by J. M. W. Turner made in 1811 suggests it was in its present position by then . The site where the cross now stands was leveled in 1776 by workman , paid by Henry Fownes Luttrell , and it may have been on this occasion that the cross was moved . The cross has an octagonal base and polygonal shaft , however the head of the cross has been lost . It stands on a small area of raised ground on a plinth . The socket stone is 0 @.@ 85 metres ( 2 ft 9 in ) wide and 0 @.@ 5 metres ( 1 ft 8 in ) high . The surviving shaft is 1 @.@ 1 metres ( 3 ft 7 in ) high and changes from square to octagonal as it rises . There is an inscription on the northern face which says " WC , 1871 , WS " recording a restoration . It is in the care of English Heritage for the state and managed by the National Trust . 
 Other notable buildings include the Nunnery , Dunster Watermill , Dovecote and the Priory barn , which belonged to Dunster Priory . Dunster Working Watermill ( also known as Castle Mill ) is a restored 18th century watermill , situated on the River Avill , close to Gallox Bridge , in the grounds of Dunster Castle . It is a Grade II * listed building . The mill stands on a site where a mill was first recorded in the Domesday Book , but the present building was constructed around 1780 . It closed in 1962 but was restored in 1979 and is still used to grind flour . The equipment is powered by two overshot wheels . It is owned by the National Trust but operated as a tourist attraction by a private company . 
 The Dovecote was probably built in the late 16th century . It has been designated as a Grade II * listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument . It is approximately 19 feet ( 5 @.@ 8 m ) high and 19 feet ( 5 @.@ 8 m ) in diameter , with walls around 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) thick . In the 18th century the floor level and door were raised among several major alterations . The lower tiers of nest holes were blocked to protect against brown rats which had arrived in the Britain in 1720 and reached Somerset by 1760 . A revolving ladder , known as a " <unk> " , was installed to allow the pigeon keeper to search the nest holes more easily . In the 19th century two feeding platforms were added to the axis of the revolving ladder . When the ladder was installed in the 16th century the base rests on a pin driven into a beam on the floor . The head of the pin sits in a metal cup in the base of the wooden pillar , which means the mechanism has never had to be oiled . When the Dunster Castle estate was sold the dovecote was bought by the Parochial church council and opened to the public . Extensive repairs were undertaken in 1989 . 
 The Tithe Barn was originally part of a Benedictine Dunster Priory , has been much altered since the 14th century and only a limited amount of the original features survive . In the " Valor Ecclesiasticus " of 1535 the net annual income of the Dunster Tithe Barn is recorded as being £ <unk> ( £ <unk> ) , with £ <unk> ( £ <unk> ) being passed on to the priory in Bath . The Somerset Buildings Preservation Trust ( <unk> ) has co @-@ ordinated a £ 550 @,@ 000 renovation project on behalf of the Dunster Tithe Barn Community Hall Trust ( <unk> ) , into a multi @-@ purpose community hall under a 99 @-@ year lease at a pepper @-@ corn rent , by the Crown Estate Commissioners who own the building . Funding has been obtained from the Heritage Lottery Fund and others to support the work . 
 Conygar Tower is a folly used as a landmark for shipping . It is at the top of Conygar Hill and overlooks the village . It is a circular , 3 storey tower built of red sandstone , situated on a hill overlooking the village . It was commissioned by Henry Luttrell and designed by Richard Phelps and stands about 18 metres ( 59 ft ) high so that it can be seen from Dunster Castle on the opposite hillside . There is no evidence that it ever had floors or a roof . It has no strategic or military significance . The name Conygar comes from two medieval words Coney meaning rabbit and Garth meaning garden , indicating that it was once a warren where rabbits were bred for food . In 1997 a survey carried out by The Crown Estate identified cracks in the walls which were repaired in 2000 . 
 Dunster Doll Museum houses a collection of more than 800 dolls from around the world , based on the collection of the late Mollie Hardwick , who died in 1970 and donated her collection to the village memorial hall committee . Established in 1971 , the collection includes a display of British and foreign dolls in various costumes . Thirty @-@ two of the dolls were stolen during a burglary in 1992 and have never been recovered .

 Dunster railway station is on the West Somerset Heritage Railway , though the station is over a mile from the village . The station was opened on 16 July 1874 by the Minehead Railway . The line was operated by the Bristol and Exeter Railway which was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway ( GWR ) in 1876 . The Minehead Railway was itself absorbed into the GWR in 1897 . A small signal box stood at the Watchet end of the platform , but was demolished in 1926 when this was extended . In 1934 a new signal box at the opposite end of the station , brought second @-@ hand from Maerdy , was put into use when the line from Dunster to Minehead was doubled in 1934 . The GWR was nationalised into British Railways in 1948 and from 1964 , when goods traffic was withdrawn on 6 July , the line was run down until it was eventually closed on 4 January 1971 . The line was reopened as a heritage railway operated by the West Somerset Railway on 28 March 1976 . The signal box was moved to Minehead in 1977 but the goods yard is now home to the railway ’ s civil engineering team . It is a Grade II listed building . 
 Road access is via the A39 and A369 . The nearest international airports would be those at Exeter or Bristol .

 " LoveGame " is a song by American singer Lady Gaga from her debut album , The Fame ( 2008 ) . Produced by RedOne , the track was released as the album 's third single in North America and Europe and the fourth single in Australia , New Zealand , and Sweden after " Eh , Eh ( Nothing Else I Can Say ) " . " LoveGame " was also released as the fourth single in the United Kingdom , after " Paparazzi " . 
 Critics appreciated the song 's rhythm and the " I wanna take a ride on your disco stick " hook . Gaga had explained that the term " disco stick " is a euphemism for a penis and was inspired by her sexual attraction to a stranger at a night club . Musically carrying the vibe of underground New York discos , " LoveGame " talks about love , fame , and sexuality which was the central theme of the album . The song received a number of remixes , one of them featuring rocker Marilyn Manson . " LoveGame " was a commercial success , charting within the top ten in the United States , Australia , New Zealand , Canada , France , Germany , and other European countries . It became Gaga 's third consecutive number @-@ one song on the Billboard Pop Songs chart and achieved double platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America . 
 The New York underground inspired music video for the song was directed by Joseph Kahn , and portrayed Gaga dancing at an underground subway station and in a parking lot . The music video was a tribute from the singer to the New York lifestyle including its glamour , fans and fashion . It was influenced by the music video for Michael Jackson 's " Bad " , which also took place in a subway station . The music video was banned from broadcast at the PG rated time slots in Australian television channels because of its sexual content . " LoveGame " has been performed live a number of times by Gaga , including The Fame Ball and The Monster Ball tours , where she performed it while holding her characteristic disco stick in one hand .

 Towards the end of 2007 , Lady Gaga 's management company introduced her to songwriter and producer RedOne , whom they also managed . By 2008 , Gaga relocated to Los Angeles in order to work extensively with her record label to complete her debut album , The Fame , and set up her own creative team called the Haus of Gaga . " LoveGame " was one of the songs written by Gaga and RedOne who also produced the track . With Rolling Stone , Gaga explained that she was at a nightclub and had a " sexual crush " on somebody . She went up to the person and uttered the line , " I wanna ride on your disco stick " . Thinking it to be a thoughtful metaphor for penis , Gaga went to the recording studio the next day and wrote the song in roughly four minutes . Gaga also had ideas for the live performance of the song where she used " an actual stick — it looks like a giant rock @-@ candy pleasuring tool — that lights up " . 
 While commenting in regards to the lyrical content of the song on Australian talk show , Rove , Gaga said that she was unrepentant about her " disco stick " metaphor , though it led to a banning of the music video on Network Ten in Australia . She added that the metaphor was not meant to be subtle and was clear what the lyrics constituted off . " If anything , I happen to think people are frivolously hard on me " , Gaga generalized . She went on to relegate " lot of youth @-@ oriented pop music " as much racier than hers with their sexually provocative lyrics , but Gaga felt that the whole context of her visuals alongside the music was what made people react . " It 's the music in relation to the visual , in relation to the way I move and the way I articulate the lyrics . But if I wanted to make music to make people sing ' la di da ' that would be very boring , " she concluded . 
 " LoveGame " was released as the album 's third single in North America and Europe and the fourth single in Australia , New Zealand , and Sweden after " Eh , Eh ( Nothing Else I Can Say ) " . In the US it was sent to Contemporary hit radio ( CHR ) formats for airplay from May 12 , 2009 . The track initially had been planned as the third single release in the United Kingdom , but deeming its lyrics and music video potentially controversial , it was decided that " Paparazzi " would be released instead . " LoveGame " has received a number of remix treatments , one of which featured rocker Marilyn Manson in the vocals . Rolling Stone reported that the remix was conceived during Gaga 's photoshoot with the magazine in May 2009 , when Manson arrived at the set . The rocker was impressed by the shoot and wanted to collaborate with Gaga , saying that " she 's a great musician , she 's a great singer , and she 's laughing when she 's doing it , the same way that I am " . In return , Gaga also lent vocals for a remix of a song from Manson 's seventh studio album , The High End of Low . 
 = = Recording and composition = = 
 " LoveGame " was recorded at Record Plant Studios , Hollywood and Chalice Recording Studios , Los Angeles , California . Along with the production work of the track , RedOne also contributed to its background vocals , instrumentation , programming , audio engineering and recording . Other personnel involved in creating the final version of the song included Robert Orton who did the audio mixing , and Gene Grimaldi who mastered the song at Oasis Mastering , Burbank , California . 
 Musically , " LoveGame " is an uptempo electro and R & B song . According to Kerri Mason of Billboard , the composition has a vibe of the New York downtown musical scene , but has a more mainstream appeal to it , making it perfect for radio , " without losing its smut and sass " . The song does not have a massive sound like previous single " Poker Face " , nor has a big melody like subsequent single , " Paparazzi " . Instead the composition of the song is electro @-@ R & B , consisting of big beats and a number of hooks , with Gaga repeating the word " huh ! " from time to time . 
 Gaga explained that the lyrics of " LoveGame " were clear about what the song is all about . She thought that the lyrics portrayed a powerful message about love , fame , and sexuality which was the central theme of The Fame . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony / ATV Music Publishing , " LoveGame " is set in the time signature of common time and is composed in the key of B minor with a moderate tempo of 104 beats per minute . Gaga 's vocal range spans from B3 to G5 . It follows in the chord progression of Am – Dm – C – Am – Dm – C in the first two verse and chorus while progressing as Am – Dm – Am – Dm in the intermediate verse before the final chorus .

 The song received mostly positive reviews from critics . The Phoenix music editor Daniel Brockman said that " Gaga ups the ante in terms of catchy song writing and sheer high @-@ in @-@ the @-@ club @-@ banging @-@ to @-@ the @-@ beat abandon . " He also commented on the lyrics saying that " ' Let 's have some fun , this beat is sick / I wanna take a ride on your disco stick ' might be the trashiest @-@ yet @-@ <unk> refrain I 've heard on a major @-@ label record this year . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine criticized the song for " cheap " lyrics and " painfully <unk> [ ing ] without any resemblance of actual sex appeal " . While reviewing The Fame , BBC said that the song sounded robotic in the line " I wanna take a ride on your disco stick " , though deemed it a brilliant track which " leaves us awarding Gaga the yearbook title of ' pop star most likely to kill ' . " 
 Nick Levine from Digital Spy believed that lines like " I wanna take a ride on your disco stick " was a direct reason of Gaga 's commercial success . Although he felt that the song was " attention @-@ seeking " , he knew that it would provoke reaction from the masses , be it good or bad . Genevieve Koski from The A.V. Club called the song as a " propulsive club anthem " and complimented its synths and drum programming . She described it aurally as " a dizzying sonic trip that approximates the high point of a chemically enhanced night of club @-@ hopping . " Evan Sawdey from PopMatters complimented RedOne 's production of the song , listing it as one of the best tracks on The Fame . 
 Ben Hogwood from musicOMH declared the song as " top notch , diamond @-@ encrusted pop " along with other tracks like " Starstruck " and " Paparazzi " . He found the lyrics to be sometimes odd , especially the statement , " I 'm on a mission , and it involves some heavy <unk> ' . " Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe said that the song " has a gutter level <unk> with sinuous moves " . Priya Elan from The Times was not impressed with the song and called it calculated . Billboard music editor Chris Williams gave the song a positive review , commenting that " It has all the winning ingredients of its predecessors : a radio @-@ friendly , club / electropop feel ; a provocative , yet silly enough catchphrase and hook ; and a dash of ' 80s synth magic , so the adults can play along . On ' LoveGame ' Gaga is in it to win it . " 
 While reviewing The Fame on its fifth year anniversary , Bradley Stern from Idolator noted that " LoveGame " could " easily be erased from Gaga 's back catalog with little consequence " since he felt it to be nothing more than an " electro @-@ dance " track . But Stern believed that " LoveGame " was an important component of Gaga 's career trajectory , since it was the last testament of her image as " that of the disco @-@ stick wielding pop star from out of space " — the image was later deconstructed as the doomed starlet in the music video of " Paparazzi " . He concluded by saying that the song " is a wonderful moment of pop frivolity which served to keep the upstart Lady Gaga machine chugging along at the beginning of her career . "

 The music video of " LoveGame " was directed by Joseph Kahn and premiered on March 23 , 2009 , in Australia , and on August 13 , 2009 , at UK on 4Music channel . The video mainly takes place in a subway station , hence several scenes are reminiscent to Michael Jackson 's " Bad " music video , which was also shot in a similar location . Although the production and shooting of " LoveGame " took place in January 2009 alongside the music video for " Eh , Eh ( Nothing Else I Can Say ) " , it nevertheless has a New York City setting . 
 Gaga spoke to Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly during a " Behind the Scenes " episode of the shoot , about her inspirations for the video . She wanted to have a " giant " dance video with " LoveGame " , describing it as " plastic , beautiful , gorgeous , sweaty , tar on the floor " . There would be scary and dangerous looking men also in the video . Gaga had the idea of portraying herself and her co @-@ actors as New York inhabitants taking on the role of designers , performance artists , dancers etc . She enlisted people from downtown New York as dancers , who normally would not get cast in a video . 
 One of the props developed for the video was a pair of sunglasses made of wire . According to Gaga , she imagined " a downtown , bad @-@ ass kid walking down the street with his buddies , grabbing a pair of pliers , and making a pair of sunglasses out of a fence on the street " . She wore them on the opening shot of the music video along with a chain link hood garment , saying that " they look so hard . It looks like I plied them right out of the fence and put them on my face " .

 The video starts with the heading " Streamline presents " and three men moving through Times Square . They open a man @-@ hole cover on which " Haus of Gaga " is written . Gaga is then shown naked with blue and purple paint and glitter on her body , frolicking with two men who have the words " Love " and " Fame " shaved into their heads . The scene shifts to a subway where Gaga starts singing in a grey @-@ white leotard with a hood . She carries her characteristic disco stick and wears chain @-@ linked glasses . The chorus starts with Gaga and her dancers progressing through the subway and dancing down a staircase . Two harlequin Great Danes , are also shown on top of the staircase . 
 The video shifts to a train where the second verse takes place with choreographed dance routines and Gaga wearing a black jacket . During the intermediate music , Gaga is shown entering a ticket booth with an inspector while kissing and caressing . As the camera pans from right to left the inspector changes from a man to woman in each frame . The final scene shows Gaga doing a choreographed dance routine with her crew of backup dancers . The video comes to an end as Gaga and her dancers hold their groins , gesturing towards the camera . 
 The music video was censored in many countries after its release in 2009 . The video faced censorship troubles in Australia where it was rated <unk> + by Network Ten for the " suggestive video footage involving bondage and sexual acts " . The channel demanded an edited version of the video which would not violate censorship rules . Video Hits refused to air the video in its G and PG rated time slots . They cited " numerous sexual references both visually and lyrically " as the reason they could not create a child @-@ friendly edit without bleeping the repeated hook " I wanna take a ride on your disco stick " . However , Australian programs like Rage and cable networks Channel V and MTV aired the video in its original form . 
 The video also faced a ban from MTV Arabia citing the same reason as Australia . Since it was very rare to ban videos in MTV , head of MTV Arabia Samer al <unk> commented , " We represent the young generation 's mentality and culture so we can 't play something that conflicts with that . If they can 't watch something comfortably with their brother , sisters or friends then we will not play it . " In the United States , VH1 and MTV played an edited version that removed the scenes showing Gaga naked , and blurred the label on a bottle of alcohol held by a dancer , but they did not change the lyrics .

Gaga wore a silver and black short skirt looking like a tutu and shaped like a peplum . She had a triangular piece attached on the dress on her right breast , and completed her look with high heeled ultra spike shoes . Gaga 's hair was made an austere blond bob , and she accessorized with black sunglasses . Her dancers surrounded the stage , holding plates encrusted with crystals , which completely hid them .

The performance incorporated the Chew Fu remix of the song which commenced at the end with Gaga asking the audience to dance along with her . 
 The song was also included on the set list of the 2012 Born This Way Ball tour . The song was shortened and had Gaga performing it in a clear bath tub while wearing a Statue of Liberty styled head piece . Gaga ventured into the crowd during the song , through the extended pathways from the stage and after the performance she invited a fan onstage . Joey Guerra from the Houston Chronicle believed that the appearance of " LoveGame " during the tour proved it to be a far superior track than the ones from Gaga 's second studio album , Born This Way ( 2011 ) .

 = Kepler @-@ 5b = 
 Kepler @-@ 5b is one of the first five planets discovered by NASA 's Kepler spacecraft . It is a Hot Jupiter that orbits a subgiant star that is more massive , larger , and more diffuse than the Sun is . Kepler @-@ 5 was first flagged as the location of a possibly transiting planet , and was reclassified as a Kepler Object of Interest until follow @-@ up observations confirmed the planet 's existence and many of its characteristics . The planet 's discovery was announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society on January 4 , 2010 . The planet has approximately twice the mass of Jupiter , and is about 1 @.@ 5 times larger . It is also fifteen times hotter than Jupiter . Kepler @-@ 5b orbits Kepler @-@ 5 every 3 @.@ 5 days at a distance of approximately 0 @.@ 051 AU ( 7 @.@ 6 Gm ) . 
 = = Observational history = = 
 The Kepler spacecraft 's first days of science activity revealed a series of transit events , in which some body ( such as a planet ) crosses in front of , and therefore dims , its host star . Such objects were taken from the Kepler Input Catalog and reclassified as Kepler Objects of Interest . Kepler @-@ 5 was one of these objects of interest , and was given the designation KOI @-@ 18 . 
 After the stellar parameters were established , the Kepler science team ran models and fits to ensure that Kepler @-@ 5 's transit event was not a false positive , such as an eclipsing binary star . Once the planetary nature of Kepler @-@ 5b was established , the Kepler team searched for the planet 's occultation behind its star , hoping to find the temperature on its day side . They found both , and were able to set the equilibrium temperature of the planet . The use of speckle imaging using adaptive optics at the WIYN Observatory in Arizona and the Palomar Observatory in California isolated the starlight of Kepler @-@ 5 from background stars . 
 Use of the Fibre @-@ fed Echelle Spectrograph ( FIES ) at the Nordic Optical Telescope on the Canary Islands on June 4 , 2009 provided data that was used to determine the star 's stellar classification . The W.M. Keck Observatory 's High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer ( HIRES ) , which was used on June 3 – 6 , 2009 , and July 2 – 4 , 2009 , determined radial velocity measurements for the star , which helped to further define stellar parameters . 
 Kepler @-@ 5 has , as considered by the Kepler team , the potential for use in the study of planets in extreme conditions ; its high temperature , large size , and short orbital period contribute to the aforementioned conditions . The findings of the Kepler team , which also included planets Kepler @-@ 4b , Kepler @-@ 6b , Kepler @-@ 7b , and Kepler @-@ 8b , were announced at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society of January 4 , 2010 .

 Kepler @-@ 5 is a subgiant in the Cygnus constellation that is expected to soon deplete its hydrogen stores in the core and begin fusing hydrogen in the shell region surrounding the core . The star is 1 @.@ 374 times the mass of the Sun ( another model suggests that Kepler @-@ 5 as a mass of 1 @.@ 21 times that of the Sun ) , although it is more diffuse at 1 @.@ 793 times the Sun 's radius .

 = Pretty on the Inside = 
 Pretty on the Inside is the debut studio album by American alternative rock band Hole , released on September 17 , 1991 in the United States on Caroline Records . [ 1 ] Produced by Sonic Youth 's Kim Gordon , and Gumball frontman Don Fleming , the album was Hole 's first major label release after the band 's formation in 1989 by singer @-@ songwriter Courtney Love and lead guitarist Eric Erlandson . 
 The album features distorted and alternating guitar compositions , screaming vocals , " shock value " lyrics , and " sloppy punk ethics " , a style which the band would later distance themselves from , opting for a less abrasive sound on their subsequent releases . Love 's lyrics on the album are often narrative , graphic , and abstract , detailing issues of violence , self @-@ realization , and womanhood . The record was dedicated to Rob Ritter of the Los Angeles punk rock acts Bags and The Gun Club . 
 Pretty on the Inside was well received by alternative music critics , garnering favorable reviews in Spin , NME , and The Village Voice . It received considerable commercial success in the United Kingdom , where the record 's lead single , " Teenage Whore , " entered the UK Indie Chart at number one in September 1991 . It has sold over 200 @,@ 000 copies in the United States and gained a contemporary cult following among punk rock fans , and has been cited as a seminal influence for songwriters and musicians such as Brody Dalle and Scout Niblett . Despite its critical acclaim , frontwoman Courtney Love has , in later years , referred to the album as " unlistenable . " An LP version of the album was reissued in the United States in August 2011 to celebrate its twentieth anniversary . 
 = = Background = = 
 Hole formed in 1989 in Los Angeles , California when frontwoman Courtney Love , after years of fruitless attempts at forming bands , bought her neighbor Lisa Roberts a bass and posted an advertisement in a local paper stating : " I want to start a band . My influences are Big Black , Sonic Youth , and Fleetwood Mac . " Eric Erlandson , along with over a dozen other musicians , answered the ad . Love later said that she knew Eric was " the one " as soon as they met , and that he had a " Thurston Moore quality about him " that she liked . 
 Erlandson said that early in Hole 's career , they were more interested in " making noise " than achieving success and before drummer Caroline Rue joined the band that they used no percussion whatsoever . It was not until Love and Erlandson heard Mudhoney 's " Touch Me , I 'm Sick " that they began to think about taking the band to the next level . Early on , the band was most influenced by the New York No Wave art and music scene of the 1980s , which included visual artists , such as Richard Kern , as well as <unk> rock acts , such as Teenage Jesus and the Jerks , Sonic Youth , and Pussy Galore . The band also featured a third guitarist in its early days , first Mike <unk> and then Errol Stewart . After the band 's first four shows , the original lineup disbanded and Hole recruited bassist Jill Emery in 1990 . 
 In the documentary film Not Bad for a Girl , Love , who had been in the erotic dancing industry for years prior , said that she worked as a stripper to help support the band in its early incarnation . She also cited her work as a dancer as being one of many inspirations for the songs on Pretty on the Inside : " I was blonde , wore makeup , had to support my band by dancing , and had to play this ridiculous archetype at work ... so I took , you know , high heels and white pumps , and I had a <unk> — I just took that and messed with it . " 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 Hole had previously released two singles , " Retard Girl " on Sympathy for the Record Industry and " Dicknail " on Sub Pop . According to Love , she had initially wanted to release the album on Sympathy for the Record Industry , but was " talked into " signing on with Caroline Records . After signing , Love sought Sonic Youth 's Kim Gordon to produce the album . In January 1991 , Love sent her letter , a Hello Kitty <unk> , and copies of the band 's early singles , mentioning that the band greatly admired Gordon 's work and appreciated " the production of the SST record " ( referring to Sonic Youth 's <unk> or Sister ) . Gordon agreed on the condition that her friend , Gumball frontman Don Fleming , assist . 
 The band entered Music Box Studios with Gordon , Fleming and Holly Price in March 1991 and worked on the album for one week ; the songs were recorded over a period of four days , and were mixed over the course of a further three days . During the recording sessions for the album , Love gargled whiskey and smoked cigarettes excessively to " give a raw edge to her vocals . " 
 The sessions were said to be stressful , with an anonymous band member saying that Love was " on a total power trip " the entire time , making sure she had the final say of " everything in terms of album cover design , order of musicians ' credits in the liner notes , and even the spot where the price code went on the back . " Fleming was impressed by Love 's " focus and intensity , " especially while recording vocals for one song when Love " literally ripped her clothes off while she sang . " " Courtney was amazing , " said Fleming . " She was the most gung @-@ ho person I 've ever met . She was going to make the greatest record ever - I like that attitude in the studio . Courtney was like ' Let 's go , fuckers ' , and I loved that . " In a later interview , Fleming said : 
 Courtney was great at the time — it was before she even knew Kurt [ Cobain ] . She gave 180 % . I 've worked with some people that you 've had to coax the performance out of them . With Courtney , there was no attitude . She was gonna give it all . And she did and it was really impressive to me [ ... ] I loved the whole band ; they were a lot of fun . That early lineup of Hole — I felt they were the real deal . They were Hollywood misfits — all of them . I felt it really captured what they were . 
 Gordon said that Love " was either charming and nice or screaming at her band " but that she was " a really good singer and entertainer and front person . " 
 = = Composition = = 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The music of Pretty on the Inside is most often noted for its extreme abrasiveness , and for its sophisticated use of melody buried under arrangements . The album 's sonic elements are heavily influenced by Los Angeles hardcore punk as well as New York 's no wave scene ; many of the tracks are accompanied by overt use of feedback , experimental playing , wah pedals , and use of sampling and interpolation . Rapid sliding techniques and string muting are also heavily present on the album , as well as what Love and Erlandson describe as " Sonic Youth tunings . " Love 's vocals range from whispers to violent screaming , often in succession with the extreme shifts in speed and volume . 
 The album also contains multiple references to other musicians , specifically in its two noise tracks , " Sassy " and " <unk> " : the main riff to " <unk> " is based on Neil Young 's " Cinnamon Girl " and features analog cassette excerpts from " Rhiannon " by Fleetwood Mac and an early recording of " Best Sunday Dress " by Pagan Babies , one of Love 's earlier bands with Kat Bjelland ; " Sassy " includes snippets from an angry message left by Nymphs singer Inger Lorre on Love 's answering machine , accompanied by one chord progression repeated throughout . Love has admitted that the main riff to " Mrs. Jones " was copied verbatim from " Dark Entries " by the goth rock group Bauhaus , one of her favorite bands as a teenager . 
 In a 1991 Canadian television interview , Love commented on the album 's coarse musical structure . She said that since the band was from Los Angeles , the " metal capital of the US " , they thought they were making a " pop record with an edge , " and were surprised by people 's reactions when they were told it was violent and extreme . Love also said , " It was all about the expression of my experience . I was not coming from a black void ; I was trying to create light ... I was trying to heal . " In an interview with Spin magazine several years after its release , Love said that she was " posing in a lot of ways " with the album : " It was the truth , but it was also me catching up with all my hip peers who 'd gone all indie on me , and who made fun of me for liking R.E.M. and The Smiths . I 'd done the whole punk thing , sleeping on floors in piss and beer , and waking up with the guy with the fucking mohawk and the skateboards and the speed and the whole goddamned thing . But I hated it . I 'd grown out of it by the time I was seventeen . " In a 1994 interview with Kurt Loder , Love admitted to having been " consciously self @-@ conscious " when making the record due to her feeling the need to compete with her peers at the time . In a 2011 interview for Hit So Hard ( 2011 ) , a documentary on later Hole drummer Patty Schemel , Love referred to Pretty on the Inside as " unlistenable " . 
 = = = Lyrics and themes = = = 
 Many of the album 's lyrics are narrative and <unk> in nature , and were heavily drawn from Love 's personal life and experiences in her teenage and young adult years . In a press release promoting the album , Love said : " These songs are about my own weaknesses and impurities ; things about myself that I hate ... paranoias , petty concerns , and pithy , pathetic things that are inside of me . " The songs are often lyrically abstract and describe shocking scenes of violence , and , particularly , violence against women . Prominent themes discussed in the lyrics include elitism , beauty and self @-@ image , as well as the more disconcerting themes of abortion , prostitution , suicide , murder , " red lights " , and self @-@ destructiveness . Q Magazine described the lyrics on the record as " confrontational " and " genuinely uninhibited . " 
 The Seattle publication The Stranger analyzed the lyrics to the track " Mrs. Jones " , calling it a " particularly rattling sketch of what appears to be a rape scene , with Love seamlessly handling three perspectives : the ugly attacker ( " Look into the <unk> , you suicide bitch / It takes an hour with you to make me want to live " ) , the vengeful victim ( " The abortion left an abscess / Don 't ever talk to me like that again " ) , and the supportive narrator ( " Just like a pro , she takes off her dress / And she kicks you down in her snow white pumps " ) . " The song also makes direct references to The Ballad of East and West , a poem by Rudyard Kipling , specifically with the line : " East is east and west is west , and mine was you and mine was best , " which is a partial quote from the poem . 
 " <unk> Man " , discusses abandonment and alienation , as well as crisis of spirituality , and is one of the few songs on the album to feature a verse @-@ chorus @-@ verse composition . The album closes with two songs that are bridged together as a single piece : " Pretty on the Inside " , noted for its hostile lyrics and allusions to vanity , and " Clouds " , a dark and raucous cover of Joni Mitchell 's " Both Sides , Now " from her 1969 album Clouds . The cover of the song features altered lyrics that appear to illustrate a suicide scene . 
 The explicitness of the album 's lyrics mandated a Parental Advisory logo in the United States , largely due to the lurid nature of the songs as well as their usage of profanity . Female @-@ aimed curse words such as " bitch " , " slut " , and " whore " are prominent in the songs , though in a presumably subversive manner . " I try to place [ beautiful imagery ] next to fucked up imagery , because that 's how I view things , " said Love in a 1991 interview with Everett True . " I sometimes feel that no one 's taken the time to write about certain things in rock , that there 's a certain female point of view that 's never been given space . " In spite of its graphic lyrics , the underlying pro @-@ feminist slant that is found in many of the songs led some to tag the band as being part of the riot <unk> movement , which Love was not directly associated with . 
 = = Packaging and artwork = = 
 The artwork for Pretty on the Inside is abstract in comparison to Hole 's later album artwork . The front cover of the album features a heavily saturated pink press photo of the band amidst forest underbrush , taken by photographer Vickie Berndt . Berndt said that " Courtney wanted something striking and unusual " and Berndt was experimenting with color infrared film during the shoot , testing exposure settings with Love . The photo is similar to several others taken during the same shoot , one of which was featured in a Spin article in 1991 . 
 The font design featured on the front cover was created by <unk> , a graphic artist from Long Beach , who also designed album cover art for several other indie rock bands . The back side of the album features a painting by bassist Emery , depicting a topless woman looking at herself through a hand mirror . On her chest is a red heart surrounded by arrows , and below , her ribs protrude from her sides , possibly a reference to anorexia and body image issues , a major theme of the album and its successor Live Through This . 
 The interior artwork , presented in a booklet on the CD version of the album and on the record sleeve on vinyl releases , features an assemblage of scribbled and typewritten lyrics , personal " thank you " notes , cutouts of Catholic and Renaissance artwork , as well as childlike drawings and storybook pictures juxtaposed with photos of women in bondage . The collages in the album 's liner notes have been described as looking like " the scrapbook of an incest victim . " In the liner notes , the album is dedicated to Rob Ritter of the LA punk group Bags . 
 = = Release = = 
 Pretty on the Inside was released on September 17 , 1991 in the United States on Caroline Records and on City Slang in Europe . The album 's lead single , " Teenage Whore " , was released in Europe on September 23 , and entered the UK Indie Chart 's Top 10 at number one on September 28 , 1991 , beating out " Heaven Sent An Angel " by Revolver , " Let It Slide " by Mudhoney , and " Love to Hate You " by Erasure , among others . On The Chart Show on Channel 4 , the song 's title was censored with ellipsis in place of the word " whore " . 
 The single 's success in the United Kingdom led the band to perform a twelve @-@ date tour of the country supporting Mudhoney . The subsequent success of both the album , single , and tour saw Hole embark on a further three tours of the United States , Germany and Western Europe in the latter half of 1991 , playing again with Mudhoney , as well as alternative rock acts Daisy Chainsaw and Therapy ? . In spite of the album 's popularity in the United Kingdom , it failed to chart in the United States despite extensive touring , though it was known to be outselling Nirvana 's output before the band 's release of Nevermind the following week . 
 The band played their final show of the tour in San Francisco opening for The Smashing Pumpkins , which ended with Love infamously smashing her guitar headstock onstage at the end of their set after the audience failed to respond well . 
 Los Angeles Times journalist David Cromelin noted in his review of the concert : 
 Smashing Pumpkins ' singer @-@ guitarist Billy Corgan referred to himself as " a frustrated Midwestern youth " at the Whisky on Tuesday [ ... ] Smashing Pumpkins was preceded by smashing guitars , courtesy of Hole . The tortured , transfixing L.A. group 's pairing with the headliners should have made this a bill to remember , but the audience was primed for Pumpkin and didn 't take to Courtney Love 's powerful howls of anguish . Hole ended its set in a tantrum , as Love ordered the band to halt and hurled her guitar to the ground . Guitarist Eric Erlandson finished things off by demolishing his instrument with a few impressive swings . Frustrated Midwestern youth , meet frustrated California youth . 
 After the tour concluded , a music video for the track " <unk> Man " was released , though the album 's only single , " Teenage Whore " , did not receive a music video . The video is fairly abstract and a reflection of Hole 's no wave influence at the time , with shots of Love and other band members in a car interspersed with shots of them performing outside the window . According to Love , she tracked down original rolls of radiographic medical film from Denver , Colorado that had been used in the Vietnam war , which the music video was then shot on , giving the images an X @-@ ray @-@ like appearance . The video was shown on MTV 's 120 Minutes in 1992 during an interview with Love and Kim Gordon , and was broadcast again on the show in 1994 and 1995 but was never as popular as the band 's later videos . For the music video , an alternate mix of the song by Gordon was used to eliminate profanity . 
 The album was released on CD and cassette in the United States , but received a release on vinyl LP throughout Europe by City Slang , based in Berlin , Germany . The first 3 @,@ 000 pressings of the LP featured blue vinyl , while the following pressings were in standard black . In June 2011 , Plain Recordings , an independent American record label specializing in cult album re @-@ issues , announced that a 180 gram vinyl re @-@ release of Pretty on the Inside was being introduced to their catalogue ; it was released on August 2 , 2011 . 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 Pretty on the Inside was received with positive acclaim by many British and American alternative press . In a review by NME , the album was positively compared to Patti Smith 's Horses , as well as the debut albums of The Ramones , Television , and New York Dolls , and was branded as being in " a class of its own , " while Elizabeth Wurtzel wrote in The New Yorker that " Pretty on the Inside is such a cacophony ... very few people are likely to get through it once , let alone give it the repeated listenings it needs for you to discover that it 's probably the most compelling album to have been released in 1991 . " 
 Q called the album " loud , ugly , and deliberately shocking , " awarding it three out of five stars . Spin noted in their review : 
 [ The album ] revolves around a fascination of the repulsive aspects of L.A. — superficiality , sexism , violence , and drugs . Love is the embodiment of what drives the band : the dichotomy of pretty / ugly ... The pretty / ugly dynamic also comes across in Hole 's music ... a song like " Teenage Whore " at first comes across like a ranting noisy rage , but underneath is a surprisingly lush melody . " 
 Melody Maker columnist Sharon O 'Connell said the album was " the very best bit of fucked up rock ' n ' roll [ I 've heard ] all year " , and it was named one of the 20 best albums of the year by Spin in December 1991 . Deborah Frost of The Village Voice , in her review of the album , called it " genre @-@ defying " , taking note of Love 's reputation on the album as " the girl who won 't shut up ... She is all the things that she should not be , and she shoves it , raw , right in your face . " The Seattle publication The Stranger took note of the album 's production work by Gordon and Fleming , stating that " despite Pretty on the Inside 's reputation as an unhinged , raw @-@ sounding debut , a great deal of professional calculation went into putting this record together . " They also applauded Love 's lyrics , and said the album " judiciously toes the line between the <unk> obtuse and overtly obscene . " 
 In 1995 , Alternative Press magazine ranked the album at # 74 in their " Top 99 Of ' <unk> ' 95 " list , noting that " Love works in extremes and wears that scarlet letter when she feels like it , and when she doesn 't she rips it off , never neglecting melody and language as the real medium for her message . " In 2009 PopMatters called it an album with " bold musical splendour on display " that " [ leaves one feeling ] nothing short of gobsmacked . " 
 In a 1994 article , Rolling Stone journalist David Fricke called the album " gloriously assaultive " and " a classic of sex @-@ mad self @-@ laceration , <unk> guitars and full @-@ moon bawling [ ... ] in particular the spectacular <unk> of Joni Mitchell 's " Both Sides , Now " ( aka " Clouds " ) at the end of the record . You don 't really know the solitary despair at the core of that song until you 've heard Love 's embittered delivery of the last two lines — " It 's life 's illusions I recall / I really don 't know life at all " — over guitarist Eric Erlandson 's fading squall . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Pretty on the Inside has had an influence on multiple alternative rock acts , being specifically mentioned by <unk> frontwoman Brody Dalle in an interview as a seminal album in the development of her music . British rock band Nine Black Alps also noted the album as a major influence on their third release , Locked Out from the Inside ( 2009 ) , and indie singer @-@ songwriter Scout Niblett cited it as a major influence on her : " For me , the thing that I loved about them and her [ Courtney Love ] was the anger , and aggressiveness , along with the tender side , " said Niblett . " That was something I hadn ’ t seen before in a woman playing music . That was hugely influential and really inspiring . Women up ’ til then were kind of one @-@ dimensional , twee , sweet , ethereal , and that annoys the shit out of me . " 
 Contemporarily , the album has also gained a cult following among rock and punk music fans . 
 The Trouser Press Guide to ' 90s Rock called the album a " surly milkshake of broken rock shards ... from the artistic misspellings of song titles to the lyric collage on the inner sleeve and the abrasive , abstract guitar noises on the songs , Pretty on the Inside reveals the band 's fascination with the New York no wave art and music scene of the ' 80s . " According to Billboard , the album had sold 27 @,@ 000 copies by 1994 , when the band released their wildly popular follow @-@ up album , Live Through This . 
 In more recent years , frontwoman Love stated that the album contains " nothing melodic " . In a 2011 interview for Hit So Hard ( 2011 ) , a documentary on later Hole drummer Patty Schemel , Love referred to Pretty on the Inside as " unlistenable " , going on to say : " That record was a calling card for rock critics and <unk> , [ saying ] ' This is what I do , and I am not going to back down from it . I am announcing my persona as a cunt . Thank you very much . ' " 
 Nonetheless , the title track of the album was performed regularly at Hole concerts between 1993 and 1999 , and Love opened shows with the song during Hole 's 2010 tour .

 Deepwater Horizon was an ultra @-@ deepwater , dynamically positioned , semi @-@ submersible offshore oil drilling rig owned by Transocean . Built in 2001 in South Korea by Hyundai Heavy Industries , the rig was commissioned by R & B Falcon , which later became part of Transocean , registered in Majuro , Marshall Islands , and leased to BP from 2001 until September 2013 . In September 2009 , the rig drilled the deepest oil well in history at a vertical depth of 35 @,@ 050 ft ( 10 @,@ 683 m ) and measured depth of 35 @,@ 055 ft ( 10 @,@ 685 m ) in the Tiber Oil Field at Keathley Canyon block 102 , approximately 250 miles ( 400 km ) southeast of Houston , in 4 @,@ 132 feet ( 1 @,@ 259 m ) of water . On 20 April 2010 , while drilling at the Macondo Prospect , an explosion on the rig caused by a blowout killed 11 crewmen and ignited a fireball visible from 40 miles ( 64 km ) away . The resulting fire could not be extinguished and , on 22 April 2010 , Deepwater Horizon sank , leaving the well gushing at the seabed and causing the largest oil spill in U.S. waters .

 Deepwater Horizon was a fifth @-@ generation , RBS @-@ 8D design ( i.e. model type ) , deepwater , dynamically positioned , column @-@ stabilized , semi @-@ submersible mobile offshore drilling unit , designed to drill subsea wells for oil exploration and production using an 18 @.@ 75 in ( 476 mm ) , 15 @,@ 000 psi ( 100 @,@ 000 kPa ) blowout preventer , and a 21 in ( 530 mm ) outside diameter marine riser . 
 Deepwater Horizon was the second semi @-@ submersible rig constructed of a class of two , although Deepwater Nautilus , its predecessor , is not dynamically positioned . The rig was 396 by 256 ft ( 121 by 78 m ) and capable of operating in waters up to 8 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 400 m ) deep , to a maximum drill depth of 30 @,@ 000 ft ( 9 @,@ 100 m ) . In 2010 it was one of approximately 200 deepwater offshore rigs capable of drilling in waters deeper than 5 @,@ 000 ft ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) . Its American Bureau of Shipping ( ABS ) class notations were " A1 , Column Stabilized Drilling Unit , AMS , <unk> , DPS @-@ 3 " . 
 In 2002 , the rig was upgraded with " e @-@ drill " , a drill monitoring system whereby technical personnel based in Houston , Texas , received real @-@ time drilling data from the rig and transmitted maintenance and troubleshooting information . 
 Advanced systems played a key role in the rig 's operation , from pressure and drill monitoring technology , to automated shutoff systems and modelling systems for cementing . The <unk> cement modelling system , used by Halliburton in April 2010 , played a crucial part in cement slurry mix and support decisions . These decisions became a focus for investigations into the explosion on the rig that month .

 Deepwater Horizon was built for R & B Falcon ( which later became part of Transocean ) by Hyundai Heavy Industries in Ulsan , South Korea . Construction started in December 1998 , the keel was laid on 21 March 2000 , and the rig was delivered on 23 February 2001 , after the acquisition of R & B Falcon by Transocean . Until 29 December 2004 the rig was registered in the Republic of Panama . 
 Transocean , through its Steinhausen , Switzerland subsidiary Triton Asset Leasing GmbH , operated the rig under the Marshallese flag of convenience . The rig was leased to BP on a 3 @-@ year contract for deployment in the Gulf of Mexico following construction . The lease was renewed in 2004 for a year , 2005 for 5 years , and 2009 for 3 years covering 2010 to 2013 . The last contract was worth $ 544 million , or $ 496 @,@ 800 a day , for a " bare rig " , with crew , gear and support vessels estimated to cost the same . 
 According to R & B Falcon 's filings to SEC in 2001 , the transfer document between R & B Falcon and Transocean was dated 17 August 2001 , and the rig was specified as " official registration number of <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ 1 , IMO number of <unk> , with gross tonnage of 32 @,@ 588 and net tonnage of 9 @,@ 778 " and the transfer value as US $ 340 million .

It was described at times as a " lucky " and " celebrated " rig , and in 2007 was still described as " one of the most powerful rigs in the world " . In 2006 it discovered oil in the Kaskida oil field , and in 2009 the " giant " Tiber field . The well in the Tiber field has a vertical depth of 35 @,@ 050 ft ( 10 @,@ 683 m ) and a measured depth of 35 @,@ 055 ft ( 10 @,@ 685 m ) , below 4 @,@ 132 ft ( 1 @,@ 259 m ) of water . The well was the deepest oil well in the world , and more than 5 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) further below the seabed than the rig 's official drilling specification stated on the company 's fleet list . 
 In February 2010 , Deepwater Horizon commenced drilling an exploratory well at the Macondo Prospect ( Mississippi Canyon Block 252 ) , about 41 miles ( 66 km ) off the southeast coast of Louisiana , at a water depth of approximately 5 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) . The Macondo prospect exploration rights were acquired by BP in 2009 , with the prospect jointly owned by BP ( 65 % ) , Anadarko ( 25 % ) and <unk> Offshore 2007 ( 10 % ) . Deepwater Horizon was still working on the Macondo site on 20 April 2010 , when a violent explosion occurred leading to destruction of the rig and resulting oil spill . The well was in the final stages of completion at the time ; its cement casing was injected and hardening , and the rig was due to move shortly to its next role as a semi @-@ permanent production platform at the Nile site followed by a return to the Kaskida field . The exploratory work was described as " concluded " and permission had already been requested from MMS to terminate operations at the Macondo site . 
 During its operational lifetime , the rig was actively in operation for 93 % of its working life ( 2 @,@ 896 of 3 @,@ 131 days ) . The remainder partly relates to time spent between sites . 
 = = = Regulation , safety , and inspection = = = 
 The Minerals Management Service ( renamed on 18 June 2010 to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement , or Bureau of Ocean Energy ( <unk> ) ) is the regulatory and inspecting body for offshore oil drilling and rigs in the United States of America . According to an Associated Press investigation , certain safety documentation and emergency procedure information , including documentation for the exact incident that later occurred , was absent . The exact number of required monthly inspections performed varied over time ; the inspections were carried out as required for the first 40 months , but after that around 25 % of inspections were omitted , although the investigation notes this is partly expected , since there are circumstances such as weather and movement which preclude an inspection . Reports of the last three inspections for 2010 were provided under Freedom of Information legislation . Each of these inspections had taken two hours or less . 
 During its lifetime the rig received 5 citations for non @-@ compliance , 4 of which were in 2002 ( safety , including the blowout preventer ) and the other in 2003 ( pollution ) . A sixth citation in 2007 related to non @-@ grounded electrical equipment was later withdrawn when the equipment was determined to be compliant with regulations . Overall the Deepwater Horizon 's safety record was " strong " according to a drilling consultant reviewing the information . In 2009 the Minerals Management Service " herald [ ed ] the Deepwater Horizon as an industry model for safety " . According to AP 's investigation " its record was so exemplary , according to MMS officials , that the rig was never on inspectors ' informal ' watch list ' for problem rigs " . 
 = = Explosion and oil spill = = 
 At 9 : 45 P.M. CDT on 20 April 2010 , during the final phases of drilling the exploratory well at Macondo , a geyser of seawater erupted from the marine riser onto the rig , shooting 240 ft ( 73 m ) into the air . This was soon followed by the eruption of a slushy combination of drilling mud , methane gas , and water . The gas component of the slushy material quickly transitioned into a fully gaseous state and then ignited into a series of explosions and then a firestorm . An attempt was made to activate the blowout preventer , but it failed . The final defense to prevent an oil spill , a device known as a blind shear ram , was activated but failed to plug the well . 
 At the time of the explosion , there were 126 crew on board ; seven were employees of BP , 79 of Transocean , there were also employees of various other companies involved in the operation of the rig , including Anadarko , Halliburton and M @-@ I <unk> . Eleven workers were presumed killed in the initial explosion . The rig was evacuated , with injured workers airlifted to medical facilities . After approximately 36 hours , Deepwater Horizon sank on 22 April 2010 . The remains of the rig were located resting on the seafloor approximately 5 @,@ 000 ft ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) deep at that location , and about 1 @,@ 300 ft ( 400 m ) ( quarter of a mile ) northwest of the well . 
 The resultant oil spill continued until 15 July when it was closed by a cap . Relief wells were used to permanently seal the well , which was declared " effectively dead " on 19 September 2010 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Transocean received an early partial insurance settlement for total loss of the Deepwater Horizon of US $ 401 million around 5 May 2010 . Financial analysts noted that the insurance recovery was likely to outweigh the value of the rig ( although not necessarily its replacement value ) and any liabilities – the latter estimated at up to US $ 200 million . 
 Litigation , ultimate roll call of damage , and the scope of final insurance recovery were all unknown as of June 2010 , with analysts reporting that the aftermath was of unprecedented scale and complexity compared to previous disasters which themselves took many years to unfold and resolve . A July 2010 analysis by the Financial Times on the aftermath cited legal sources as saying that " at some point the scale of the litigation becomes so large that it really is novel " , that " the situation is likely to be complicated further because the variety of probable cases means it will be hard to aggregate them into so @-@ called class actions " and that there was " no way to put this in historical context because we have never faced anything like this before " . As with the Exxon Valdez disaster , litigation was being discussed in terms of a 20 @-@ year timescale . 
 In January 2013 , Transocean agreed to pay US $ 1 @.@ 4 billion for violations of the US Clean Water Act . BP had earlier agreed to pay $ 2 @.@ 4 billion but faced additional penalties that could range from $ 5 billion to $ 20 billion . In September 2014 , Halliburton agreed to settle a large percentage of legal claims against them by paying $ 1 @.@ 1 billion into a trust by way of three installments over two years . On 4 September 2014 , U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier ruled BP was guilty of gross negligence and willful misconduct under the Clean Water Act ( CWA ) . He described BP 's actions as " reckless , " while he said Transocean 's and Halliburton 's actions were " negligent . " He apportioned 67 % of the blame for the spill to BP , 30 % to Transocean , and 3 % to Halliburton . BP issued a statement strongly disagreeing with the finding , and saying the court 's decision would be appealed . 
 = American crow = 
 The American crow ( Corvus brachyrhynchos ) is a large passerine bird species of the family Corvidae . It is a common bird found throughout much of North America . American crows are the new world counterpart to the carrion crow and the hooded crow . Although the American crow and the hooded crow are very similar in size , structure and behavior , their calls are different . The American crow nevertheless occupies the same role the hooded crow does in Eurasia . 
 From beak to tail , an American crows measures 40 – 50 cm ( 16 – 20 in ) , almost half of which is tail . Mass varies from about 300 to 600 g ( 10 to 20 oz ) . Males tend to be larger than females . The most usual call is caaw @-@ caaw @-@ caaw . 
 The American crow is all black , with iridescent feathers . It looks much like other all @-@ black corvids . They can be distinguished from the common raven ( C. corax ) because American crows are smaller and from the fish crow ( C. ossifragus ) because American crows do not hunch and fluff their throat feathers when they call . 
 American crows are common , widespread , and susceptible to the West Nile virus , making them useful as a bioindicator to track the virus 's spread . Direct transmission of the virus from American crows to humans is unheard of and unlikely . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The American crow was described by Christian Ludwig Brehm in 1822 . Its scientific name means literally " short @-@ billed crow " , from Ancient Greek <unk> ( <unk> ) " short- " and rhynchos ( <unk> ) " billed " . 
 The northwestern crow ( C. caurinus ) is very closely related to the American crow . Its ancestors became separated by Ice Age glaciation west of the Rocky Mountains . It is endemic to Pacific temperate rain forests where it all but replaces the American crow . Only in the Seattle region do they co @-@ occur to any extent . In form the two species are much alike . There is a marked difference in voice . 
 = = = Subspecies = = = 
 Four subspecies are recognized . They differ in bill proportion and form a rough NE @-@ SW clinal in size across North America . Birds are smallest in the far west and on the south coast . 
 Corvus brachyrhynchos brachyrhynchos – eastern crow : northeastern United States , eastern Canada and surroundings . Largest subspecies . 
 Corvus brachyrhynchos <unk> – western crow : Western North America except arctic north , Pacific Northwest and extreme south . Smaller overall with a proportionally more slender bill and low @-@ pitched voice . 
 Corvus brachyrhynchos <unk> – Florida crow : Florida . Mid @-@ sized , short @-@ winged but decidedly long bill and legs . 
 Corvus brachyrhynchos paulus – southern crow : southern United States . Smaller overall , bill also small . 
 = = Description = = 
 The American crow is a distinctive bird with iridescent black feathers all over . Its legs , feet and bill are also black . They measure 40 – 53 cm ( 16 – 21 in ) in length , of which the tail makes up about 40 % . The wing chord is 24 @.@ 5 to 33 cm ( 9 @.@ 6 to 13 @.@ 0 in ) , with the wingspan ranging from 85 to 100 cm ( 33 to 39 in ) . The bill length can be from 3 to 5 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 to 2 @.@ 2 in ) , varying strongly according to location . The tarsus is 5 @.@ 5 to 6 @.@ 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 2 to 2 @.@ 6 in ) and the tail is 13 @.@ 5 to 19 cm ( 5 @.@ 3 to 7 @.@ 5 in ) . The body mass can vary from 316 to 620 g ( 11 @.@ 1 to 21 @.@ 9 oz ) . Males tend to be larger than females . 
 The most usual call is a loud , short , and rapid caaw @-@ caaw @-@ caaw . Usually , the birds thrust their heads up and down as they utter this call . American crows can also produce a wide variety of sounds and sometimes mimic noises made by other animals , including other birds . 
 Visual differentiation from the fish crow ( C. ossifragus ) is extremely difficult and often inaccurate . Nonetheless , differences apart from size do exist . Fish crows tend to have more slender bills and feet . There may also be a small sharp hook at the end of the upper bill . Fish crows also appear as if they have shorter legs when walking . More dramatically , when calling , fish crows tend to hunch and fluff their throat feathers . 
 If seen flying at a distance from where size estimates are unreliable , the distinctly larger common ravens ( C. corax ) can be distinguished by their almost lozenge @-@ shaped tail and their larger @-@ looking heads . They also fluff their throat feathers when calling like fish crows , only more so . 
 The average life span of the American crow in the wild is 7 – 8 years . Captive birds are known to have lived up to 30 years . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The range of the American crow now extends from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean in Canada , on the French islands of Saint @-@ Pierre and Miquelon , south through the United States , and into northern Mexico . The increase in trees throughout the Great Plains during the past century due to fire suppression and tree planting facilitated range expansions of the American crow as well as range expansions of many other species of birds . Virtually all types of country from wilderness , farmland , parks , open woodland to towns and major cities are inhabited ; it is absent only from Pacific temperate rain forests and tundra habitat where it is replaced by the raven . This crow is a permanent resident in most of the USA , but most Canadian birds migrate some distances southward in winter . Outside of the nesting season these birds often gather in large ( thousands or even millions ) communal roosts at night . 
 The American crow was recorded in Bermuda from 1876 onwards . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The American crow is omnivorous . It will feed on invertebrates of all types , carrion , scraps of human food , seeds , eggs and nestlings , stranded fish on the shore and various grains . American crows are active hunters and will prey on mice , frogs , and other small animals . In winter and autumn , the diet of American crows is more dependent on nuts and acorns . Occasionally , they will visit bird feeders . The American crow is one of only a few species of bird that has been observed modifying and using tools to obtain food . 
 Like most crows , they will scavenge at landfills , scattering garbage in the process . Where available , corn , wheat and other crops are a favorite food . These habits have historically caused the American crow to be considered a nuisance . However , it is suspected that the harm to crops is offset by the service the American crow provides by eating insect pests . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 American crows are socially monogamous cooperative breeding birds . Mated pairs form large families of up to 15 individuals from several breeding seasons that remain together for many years . Offspring from a previous nesting season will usually remain with the family to assist in rearing new nestlings . American crows do not reach breeding age for at least two years . Most do not leave the nest to breed for four to five years . 
 The nesting season starts early , with some birds incubating eggs by early April . American crows build bulky stick nests , nearly always in trees but sometimes also in large bushes and , very rarely , on the ground . They will nest in a wide variety of trees , including large conifers , although oaks are most often used . Three to six eggs are laid and incubated for 18 days . The young are usually fledged by about 36 days after hatching . Predation primarily occurs at the nest site and eggs and nestlings are frequently eaten by snakes , raccoons , ravens and domestic cats . Adults are less frequently predated but face potential attack from great horned owls , red @-@ tailed hawks , peregrine falcons and eagles . They may be attacked by predators such as coyotes or bobcats at carrion when incautious although this is even rarer . 
 = = = West Nile virus = = = 
 American crows succumb easily to West Nile virus infection . This was originally a mosquito @-@ borne African virus causing encephalitis in humans and livestock since about 1000 AD , and was accidentally introduced to North America in 1999 , apparently by an infected air traveller who got bitten by a mosquito after arrival . It is estimated that the American crow population has dropped by up to 45 % since 1999 . Despite this decline , the crow is considered a species of least concern . The disease runs most rampant in the subtropical conditions which encourage reproduction of its mosquito vectors among which Culex <unk> is most significant . Mortality rates appear to be higher than those in other birds , causing local population losses of up to 72 % in a single season . Because of this , American crows are a sentinel species indicating the presence of West Nile virus in an area . Crows cannot transmit the virus to humans directly . 
 = = = Status and conservation = = = 
 Crows have been killed in large numbers by humans , both for recreation and as part of organized campaigns of extermination . 
 American crows are protected internationally by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 . Despite attempts by humans in some areas to drive away or eliminate these birds , they remain widespread and very common . The number of individual American crows is estimated by BirdLife International to be around 31 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . The large population , as well as its vast range , are the reasons why the American crow is considered to be of least concern , meaning that the species is not threatened .

 The fourth installment under the No Surrender name was announced in January 2008 with a September 14 date attached . In July , The Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported that TNA would hold its first PPV held in Canada with No Surrender in September . The reported location for the event was Oshawa , Ontario , Canada at the General Motors Centre . TNA issued a press release in late @-@ July revealing that No Surrender would be held at the General Motors Centre in Oshawa , Ontario on September 14 . Tickets for the show went on @-@ sale on July 25 . Early ticket sales for the event were on par with the early sales of TNA 's Lockdown PPV event . The General Motors Centre was close to being sold out a few days prior to the show , with only 800 tickets remaining . The arena had a maximum capacity of 5 @,@ 000 but was configured to have a maximum capacity of 3 @,@ 500 due to the event layout . Views were positive in TNA towards early ticket sales considering it was TNA 's first PPV in Canada . Before any matches were announced , it was suspected that the event would be headlined by a tag team match or a trios bout to set up for a standard match at TNA 's next PPV event Bound for Glory IV on October 12 . TNA released a poster to promote the show featuring Samoa Joe , while " Soul Crusher " by Operator was the official theme . 
 = = = Storylines = = = 
 No Surrender featured nine professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre @-@ existing scripted feuds and storylines . Wrestlers portrayed villains , heroes , or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches . 
 The main event at No Surrender was a Four Ways to Glory match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship , in which the champion Samoa Joe defended the title against three competitors . This match was announced on the August 14 episode of TNA 's television program TNA Impact ! , with Management Director Jim Cornette stating that three qualification matches would take place to determine the challengers to Joe over the weeks leading to No Surrender . The first qualifying match was on the August 21 episode of Impact ! , when Booker T defeated Rhino to take a spot in the match . Kurt Angle defeated Kevin Nash on the August 28 episode of Impact ! to qualify for the contest . The final qualifier was Christian Cage , who defeated A.J. Styles on the September 4 episode of Impact ! . 
 TNA held a scripted Mixed Martial Arts match at No Surrender between A.J. Styles and Frank Trigg . This match was the result of a feud between Kurt Angle and Styles . The two had competed against each other at TNA 's Slammiversary PPV event on June 8 , Victory Road PPV event on July 13 , Hard Justice PPV event on August 10 , and on several Impact ! episodes with Trigg providing commentary for some of the contests and aiding Angle in the feud as they were depicted as on @-@ screen <unk> . At one point during the rivalry , Styles mistakenly attacked Trigg on the June 19 episode of Impact ! . A couple of months later on the September 4 episode of Impact ! , Trigg attacked Styles during his Four Ways to Glory qualifying match with Christian Cage . Trigg hit Styles with a kendo stick and left the ring , which allowed Cage to pin Styles to win the bout . On the September 11 episode of Impact ! , Styles challenged Trigg to a bout at No Surrender , which Trigg agreed but only if it was contested under Mixed Martial Arts rules . 
 The TNA World Tag Team Championship was defended at No Surrender by Beer Money , Inc . ( James Storm and Robert Roode ) against The Latin American Xchange ( Hernandez and Homicide ; LAX ) . On the June 12 episode of Impact ! , Roode and Storm teamed to face LAX for the World Tag Team Championship . The match was originally won by Roode and Storm before being restarted due to interference . LAX won the restart to retain the championship . After the bout , Roode and Storm assaulted LAX and their manager Héctor Guerrero . Management Director Jim Cornette scheduled a title defense at Victory Road between LAX and Roode and Storm under " Fan 's Revenge " Lumberjack rules on the June 19 episode of Impact ! . At Victory Road , LAX defeated the newly renamed Beer Money Incorporated to retain the World Tag Team Championship . On the July 17 episode of Impact ! , Roode and Storm began assaulting various wrestlers , crew members , and fans in retaliation for their loss at Victory Road . Later in the program , Roode and Storm once again attacked Guerrero , prompting LAX to come to his rescue . On the July 31 episode of Impact ! , Roode and Storm defeated the team of Christian Cage and Rhino for a World Tag Team Championship match at Hard Justice . On the August 7 episode of Impact ! , the team of Cage , Rhino , and LAX fought the team of Roode , Storm , and Team 3D in an Eight Man Tag Team match , which the latter lost . After the contest , Roode and Storm slammed Homicide through a glass table , injuring his right eye in the storyline . At Hard Justice , Beer Money , Inc. defeated LAX to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship by pinning Homicide after Roode hit Homicide in his injured eye with a beer bottle . TNA scheduled a rematch between the two teams for the championship to take place at No Surrender . 
 Another rivalry heading into the show was between Jay Lethal and Sonjay Dutt , who were fighting over the heart of SoCal Val . The storyline behind this rivalry started on the May 15 episode of Impact ! , when Lethal proposed marriage to Val in the storyline . With the two being an on @-@ screen couple , she accepted with the planned wedding segment taking place at Slammiversary . Lethal then asked Dutt to be his <unk> on the May 29 episode of Impact ! , which he accepted despite him being scripted to show feelings for Val . At Slammiversary , Dutt interrupted the wedding proclaiming his love for Val in the storyline and attacked Lethal , which ended with Dutt unconscious as Jake Roberts placed a snake on top of his body . Dutt then defeated Lethal in a bout at Victory Road . Lethal won a rematch in a Black Tie Brawl and Chain match at Hard Justice over Dutt . Leading up to No Surrender , Dutt attacked Lethal after he was defeated by Sheik Abdul Bashir on the August 14 episode of Impact ! . On the September 11 episode of Impact ! , TNA promoted a Ladder of Love match at No Surrender with the winner becoming engaged to Val . 
 The TNA X Division Championship was defended by Petey Williams against Sheik Abdul Bashir and Consequences Creed in a Three Way match at the event . At Hard Justice , Bashir attacked Creed with a steal chair during his bout with Williams , which allowed Williams to force Creed 's head into the mat with his signature Canadian Destroyer maneuver to retain the X Division Championship . Creed was given a rematch on the August 21 episode of Impact ! , with Bashir once again interfering by attacking Creed , resulting in Creed winning by disqualification and Williams retaining the X Division Championship . This match was later advertised on the card for No Surrender .

 The Ladder of Love match for SoCal Val followed between Sonjay Dutt and Jay Lethal , which lasted 13 minutes and 19 seconds . In the bout , the only way to win was to climb a ladder and retrieve an engagement ring that hung above the ring , which symbolized winning SoCal Val 's heart in the storyline . Early in the match , TNA commentator Mike Tenay announced that Salinas had been injured in an assault by Jacqueline and was taken to the hospital in the storyline . The competitors set up two ladders in the ring at one point , with one standing upright and the other positioned between two steps of the first and on the top rope . This led to Dutt placing Lethal on the bridged ladder , ascending a turnbuckle , and delivered an aerial senton splash to Lethal . Later , Dutt bridged a ladder over two chairs at ringside , then followed up by forcing Lethal back @-@ first onto the ladder with a neckbreaker . Close to the end of the encounter , Dutt had Lethal positioned on top of two standing ladders when he climbed on top of Lethal and placed Lethal in a Camel Clutch submission hold . Lethal fought out of it and pushed Dutt off the ladder , causing him to land back @-@ first onto the ring mat . Afterwards , Lethal got his leg stuck in between the ladder rungs , causing Val to enter the ring and help release him from his predicament . Dutt then yelled at Val for helping Lethal before climbing the ladder . Lethal checked on a visibly upset Val in the storyline before also climbing the ladder . Val then hit Lethal in the groin as he climbed , allowing Dutt to retrieve the ring and win the contest . 
 The TNA World Tag Team Championship was defended by Beer Money , Inc . ( James Storm and Robert Roode ) against The Latin American Xchange ( Hernandez and Homicide ; LAX ) in a Tag Team match afterwards .

Roode performed the Payoff afterwards and pinned Homicide to retain the World Tag Team Championship for his team . 
 A Mixed Martial Arts match between A.J. Styles and Frank Trigg was the eighth contest of the show . This match lasted 6 minutes and 7 seconds . This bout was contested under mixed martial arts rules , but had a scripted finish . Half way through Round One , Styles and Trigg tumbled to the ringside area and continued to fight until security broke them up . The round ended with Styles having Trigg in an armbar submission hold , causing Styles to release the hold . The system feed broadcasting the show was interrupted at this time , upon its return it displayed a pornographic film , until the broadcast was fixed , returning to No Surrender . The feed returned to Styles and Trigg fighting in Round Two , with Styles grabbing a kendo stick from under the ring and assaulting Trigg with it . It was later shown that the bout was ruled a no contest by the referee due to Styles hitting Trigg in the groin by accident . 
 The main event was a Three Ways to Glory match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship , in which the champion Samoa Joe defended against Christian Cage and Kurt Angle . Mid @-@ way through the encounter , Angle held Joe in his signature Ankle lock submission hold when Cage tried to break up the hold , only to have Angle place Cage in the hold as well , resulting in Angle having both Joe and Cage in the Ankle Lock simultaneously . Both Cage and Joe broke out of the submission , tossing Angle to the outside area . Later , Joe attempted to perform his signature Muscle Buster maneuver on Angle , with Angle countering the move into his signature Olympic slam maneuver . Cage followed by hitting a frog splash aerial maneuver from the top of a turnbuckle onto Joe . He threw Angle from the ring , performed his signature Unprettier maneuver on Joe , and covered Joe for a pin attempt . Angle pulled the referee Earl Hebner from the ring and threw him into a ringside barricade . Angle grabbed a chair and attacked Cage and Joe with it . He knocked out Cage first then placed Joe in the Ankle lock . Jeff Jarrett then returned to TNA television by smashing a guitar over the head of Angle .

The show was reviewed by two contributors of the Canadian Online Explorer 's SLAM ! Sports , Jason Clevett and Kenai Andrews , with Andrews providing a live attendance review . Clevett rated the entire event a 3 out of 10 , which was lower than the 7 out of 10 given to the 2007 edition by Chris Sokol . 7 out of 10 was also given to the 2009 edition by Bob Kapur . Bound for Glory IV also received a 7 out of 10 by Chris Sokol and Bryan Sokol . Compared to rival World Wrestling Entertainment 's ( WWE ) Unforgiven PPV event on September 7 , Unforgiven performed better as it received a 7 out of 10 from Matt Bishop . Clevett also rated the matches out of 10 , with his highest rating going to the Ladder of Love match , which he gave an 8 out of 10 . The main event received a 6 out of 10 , the Mixed Martial Arts bout was given a 0 out of 10 , the X Division Championship match got a 7 out of 10 , while the World Tag Team match received a 5 out of 10 . 
 Overall , Clevett was disappointed by the event , making several comments regarding the quality of the show . In his closing comments , Clevett wrote that he " once considered himself a huge wrestling fan " but shows " like tonight make him question his dedication anymore , " before revealing that he wanted " his money and three hours back . " When discussing the A.J. Styles versus Frank Trigg encounter , Clevett stated that " the chant “ this is <unk> ” should never , ever be heard during an A.J. Styles match , the man is far too talented to ever have fans react in such a manner . However , that is exactly what the crowd at GM Place in Oshawa , Ontario , chanted during his “ MMA ” bout with Frank Trigg . TNA ’ s pay per view debut in Canada was one of the weakest shows in recent memory , overwhelmed by horrible overbooking by TNA that once again proves that they do not know what their fanbase wants . " For the X Division Championship contest , Clevett discussed various issues such as Bashir 's entrance music and the match quality : " I watched this show with a friend who moved here from the U.S. , and we shared our disgust with Bashir ’ s theme music opening with the sound of a plane crashing . TNA has probably lost a few viewers at that lame attempt to garner heat . " However , he felt the match was a " highlight of the show with some fast paced @-@ solid wrestling " but that it lost a rating point for the " lousy finish . " He also believed the Ladder of Love match was another " highlight of the show " despite the " terrible angle that has surrounded the feud between the two over SoCal Val . " He said the two competitors " busted their asses " but that the match " should have been showcased in New Jersey last month in front of Lethal ’ s hometown crowd " at the Hard Justice PPV event . However , he gave credit to the two involved for " coming up with some incredibly creative spots " that got the crowd to cheer and chant " This is awesome " despite the ladder match genre having " become rather tired and overdone . " Regarding the World Tag Team match , Clevett thought it " should have been held off a month " since " it really doesn ’ t mean much so soon after the title change . " However , he felt the " four men worked hard and it was a decent tag match , but by this point the show wasn ’ t salvageable . " As for the main event , he commented that the " match itself was solid , but felt like all three men were going through the motions " since the " three have wrestled each other so many times in the past year , it doesn ’ t feel fresh or exciting . " He also said he could not " remember many specifics of the match , and considering the talent level that is surprising . " He also expressed his disappointment in the finish , that he tried to remember " the last time a TNA main event ended without some kind of interference , guitar shot , or overbooking " but he could not . 
 Andrews discussed the experience of witnessing the show live along with the crowd reaction during his review . He did not give any event or match ratings , but did provide comments on the quality of the event . Andrews mentioned that the TNA President Dixie Carter was present " earnestly signed autographs " and interacting " with fans in the pre @-@ amble " which he said they " seemed to love mingling with her and her eyes beamed when told SLAM ! Wrestling was present covering the show . " He stated the " crowd anticipation was decent , with many fans looking forward to " Four ways to Glory , " but wondering if Booker T would show , due to Hurricane Ike making landfall in Houston , Texas , Booker 's hometown " with no announcement being " made to the arena crowd about Booker T being there one way or another . " Also that the " energy through most of the show had an ordinary quality , bobbing unevenly between good and bland . Sting ’ s opening promo were greeted warmly and Curry Man ’ s comical segments with Christy Hemme tickled the crowd . They also gushed over Petey Williams and his Maple Leaf Muscle , The <unk> [ sic ] People and Taylor Wilde , and the Jay Lethal versus Sonjay Dutt ladder match . " Andrews said " the crowd came alive and actively participated throughout " those matches with the energy level being " high . " Conversely , he stated that " ODB and Kong ’ s match was a slow @-@ paced affair , and Beer Money Inc . - LAX tag team title match was notable only for James Storm and Jacqueline 's coherent performances given their injuries at the TNA London house show the night before . " The Mixed Martial Arts bout " annoyed the action @-@ hungry fans , not wanting to endure the chess style patience that MMA can be known for . It was probably a harsh reaction , as the extremely small vocal minority thought the MMA chorography was well done , mimicking a good blend of both men trying to impose their style on the other . Ultimately , that opinion was squashed , symbolized by Styles beating Trigg with a kendo stick after the match . " He felt that Booker T 's absence " seemed to dampen any mystique " Four ways to Glory " had going for it " with the main event being " lacklustre [ sic ] " despite Christian Cage ’ s entrance maintaining the " aura of the grand spectacle everyone was hoping the match would be . " He said it still a " solid match put on by the combatants , but one that was very familiar , prompting one fan to coin the bout " 3 the Hard Way . " Even Jeff Jarrett ’ s run @-@ in couldn ’ t get a notable rise out of the crowd . Not bad and not great . " However , he stated that it was " hard to ignore the grumblings about the main event in the tunnels and down Athol St. " He concluded his review by writing that the " card from a ringside experience perspective was hurt by the ordinary main event , turning a possibly good and memorable show into an average one . " 
 Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter rated the matches out of five stars in his review of the show . For the main event , Keller gave it 3 1 / 4 stars and said it was a " good match " and that the " booking made sense within TNA 's style , but it 's yet another example of a match ending only after obvious outside interference . " As for the Styles versus Trigg bout , Keller did not give it a rating and did not comment on the quality of the match , instead focused on the feed interruption , stating that the " brief image of the naked women will be talked about for years as one of the funniest blunders on pro wrestling PPV , and not so funny for parents watching with their kids . " He gave the World Tag Team Championship match 1 1 / 4 stars calling it a " basic match " with " nothing wrong with it " despite the highpoints being late " it felt like a match to cool down the crowd after the ladder match " with another finish that conditioned " viewers to never consider a pinfall attempt a serious potential finish until there 's some sort of interference - such as powder from Jackie this time . " The Ladder of Love match was given 3 3 / 4 stars with Keller saying it was a " really good ladder match " with the competitors managing to " really innovate and not rely on the standard ladder spots we 've seen so often before " but that the finish " made no sense that Val would save Lethal seconds before turning on him . It 's one of those things that 's done for drama that doesn 't seem the least bit realistic . " Lastly , Keller discussed the X Division Championship match , which he gave 2 1 / 2 stars and also commented on Bashir 's entrance music calling it " among the most <unk> promoting tactics in history " believing it was " beyond words how absolutely disgusting it is . " Also saying that it is " the type of thing that should put a risk their deals with Spike TV and <unk> , it 's that bad . Coming three days after the anniversary makes it worse , but it really isn 't acceptable on any day . "
