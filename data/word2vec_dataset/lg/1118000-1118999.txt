 The band Pylon was a long @-@ standing and influential part of the Athens scene , and became critical darlings in the 1980s , but never achieved significant mainstream success . This was partially because they eschewed several record contracts from the major labels due to a lack of trust in their corporate goodwill . Pylon 's dance rock style was not very accessible or commercial , and was accompanied grating , chanting @-@ style vocals , funky guitars and bass @-@ heavy beats . Other 1980s local bands with nationwide alternative followings included Love Tractor , Oh @-@ OK , with Michael Stipe 's sister Lynda Stipe , vocalist Linda Hopper ( later of Magnapop ) and future solo performer Matthew Sweet , Dreams So Real . The members of R.E.M. have remained fixtures in Athens as they have also become international stars , helping out local performers like Vic Chesnutt , the Chickasaw Mudd Puppies and Jack Logan . The Elephant 6 Collective , a group of like @-@ minded indie bands , gained limited nationwide exposure starting in the mid @-@ 1990s with the rise of Neutral Milk Hotel , Elf Power and Olivia Tremor Control . The same period saw the <unk> Records roster find critical acclaim , including the bands Sunshine Fix , Masters of the Hemisphere , <unk> , Love Tractor , Gresham Disco and Of Montreal . Candy , a DJ store owned by Michael <unk> of Pylon , opened in 1998 ; the store became an important part of the burgeoning dance music scene that produced Danger Mouse , <unk> and DJ 43 .

 Athens is near the Blue Ridge Mountains area of North Georgia ; this is an important region in the development of several varieties of folk music , including the Appalachian bluegrass style and the Piedmont blues . North Georgia 's bluegrass heritage can be traced back to the 19th century , when bluegrass was a nascent style throughout Appalachia and North Georgia was home to major fiddling contests , beginning in the 1880s . A 1983 recording expedition by Art and Margo Rosenbaum documented the continued existence of many forms of folk music , including work songs , string bands , African American hymns and spirituals , banjo tunes and unaccompanied ballads ; the collection includes a chapter devoted to Doc and Lucy Barnes of Athens . Athens ' modern contributions to the field of bluegrass include the <unk> Handle Band and <unk> Grit . 
 Athens ' local country scene has never been as significant as the profusion of indie rock bands ; however , modern Athens rock takes many elements from the folk , bluegrass and country traditions , including such bands as the Normaltown Flyers . The band Drive @-@ By Truckers , and the Holman Autry Band , have done much in recent years to make country rock a major part of Athens ' musical identity . The rapper Bubba Sparxxx , originally from South Georgia , has also helped diversify Athens ' country heritage , by adding a rural image and elements of country music to his Dirty South style of hip hop music . 
 Folk artists and singer @-@ songwriters have always flourished in the Athens atmosphere , albeit , as mentioned , not as significantly as Pop and Rock . Some of Athens ' most notable solo singer @-@ songwriter performers are Vic Chesnutt , Nathan Sheppard , Corey Smith , John Berry , Patterson Hood , Ricky Fitzpatrick , along with younger , emerging musicians like Thayer <unk> and T. Hardy Morris . 
 Athens also has an Irish band community representing several Irish folk bands ( e.g. The Green Flag Band , Repent at Leisure ) . 
 Recently , a Latin music scene has emerged with a diverse array of different musical styles that include bossa nova , samba , salsa music , and tango . Notable groups include <unk> , <unk> , Athens Tango Project , and <unk> De <unk> .

 = The FP = 
 The FP is a 2011 American comedy film written and directed by Brandon and Jason Trost . The film focuses on two gangs — the 248 and the 245 — that are fighting for control of Frazier Park ( The FP ) . The gangs settle their disputes by playing Beat @-@ Beat Revelation , a video game similar to Dance Dance Revolution . Gang member JTRO ( Jason Trost ) undergoes training to defeat L Dubba E ( Lee Valmassy ) , the leader of a rival gang . The film also features Caitlyn Folley , Art Hsu , Nick Principe , Dov Tiefenbach , and James DeBello . 
 Jason Trost conceived The FP when he was 16 years old , and developed it into a short film starring himself , Valmassy , Principe , DeBello , Brandon Barrera , Diane Gaeta , Kris Lemche , and Torry Haynes . After seeing the finished film , Barrera suggested that Trost make a feature @-@ length version . In the expanded production , Gaeta , Lemche , and Haynes were replaced with Folley , Hsu , and Bryan Goddard , respectively . Principal photography took place in Frazier Park , California in September 2008 . Ron Trost — Brandon and Jason Trost 's father — served as special effects supervisor and executive producer of the film , and his property was the primary filming location . 
 The full @-@ length version of The FP premiered at South by Southwest on March 13 , 2011 , and received positive reviews . After its screening at the Fantasia Festival on July 30 that year , Drafthouse Films acquired the film for distribution . It had a limited release in 28 American theaters , beginning on March 16 , 2012 , and was released on home media on June 29 , 2012 . The FP received mixed reviews upon its theatrical release and it failed to recoup its production budget of US $ 45 @,@ 000 , grossing $ 40 @,@ 557 in the United States . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In a dystopian future , rival gangs the 245 and the 248 fight for control of Frazier Park ( the FP ) by challenging each other in Beat @-@ Beat Revelation , a dance @-@ fight video game . L Dubba E , the leader of the 245 gang , battles and defeats BTRO , the leader of the 248 gang . BTRO dies as a result . His younger brother JTRO is traumatized and leaves the FP . 
 One year later , BTRO 's best friend KCDC finds JTRO working as a lumberjack . KCDC convinces JTRO that the FP needs him because L Dubba E has taken control of the local alcohol industry and is refusing to sell alcoholic drinks to everyone . The lack of alcohol has led to an increase in methamphetamine addicts , a decrease in homeless people and , consequently , ducks . Reluctantly , JTRO returns with KCDC ; he meets BLT and reunites with Stacy , an old friend . JTRO and Stacy are interrupted by L Dubba E — now Stacy 's boyfriend — who is picking her up to go to a party . JTRO goes to the same party and Stacy drunkenly flirts with him . L Dubba E taunts JTRO then hits him with a baseball bat , rendering him unconscious . JTRO dreams that BTRO tells him to fight back , pushing him to challenge L Dubba E. L Dubba E declines , saying that JTRO lacks sufficient " street cred " . L Dubba E demands that JTRO defeat Triple Decka 1K before he will accept JTRO 's challenge . 
 JTRO begins a grueling training regime with BLT to regain his former level of skill . Before his match with Triple Decka 1K , BLT gives BTRO 's boots to JTRO . At the match venue , JTRO is tricked into drinking alcohol tainted with methamphetamine . Despite his drug @-@ induced visual impairment , JTRO defeats Triple Decka 1K before vomiting and passing out . 
 KCDC wakes JTRO , having taken him to the 248 headquarters . After JTRO 's recovery , BLT takes him and KCDC shooting ; they decide to take guns to JTRO 's match against L Dubba E. Stacy tells JTRO that her relationship with L Dubba E began when he spiked her drink with turpentine and raped her . She continued the relationship so she could supply her father with beer to prevent him from turning to drugs . One day , JTRO hears Stacy 's father assaulting her and intervenes . After a brief fight with him , JTRO persuades Stacy to leave . Immediately after their departure , L Dubba E arrives and says that he has been cheating on Stacy . Stacy decides to stay with him , which angers JTRO and causes him to end their friendship . 
 Later the same day , Stacy , who has been badly beaten , finds JTRO and tells him that she has ended her relationship with L Dubba E. She apologizes , and they kiss . Meanwhile , L Dubba E tells his gang members to also take guns to the final match . At the venue , JTRO wears BTRO 's outfit and L Dubba E taunts him . When the match begins , L Dubba E defeats JTRO in the first round but JTRO perseveres and wins the second and third rounds . L Dubba E tries to kill JTRO , triggering a lengthy gunfight between the 248 and the 245 . 
 L Dubba E escapes the event and kidnaps Stacy . JTRO and KCDC pursue him while BLT remains at the venue . L Dubba E abruptly pulls into a gas station , JTRO follows and a fight ensues . JTRO gains the upper hand , beats L Dubba E into submission and forces him to leave the FP . Freedom to buy alcohol is restored and control of the FP is returned to the 248 . JTRO and Stacy go to the pond together as ducks fly over them .

 Jason Trost as JTRO , a member of the 248 gang who sets out to defeat L Dubba E. Trost wrote JTRO as the straight man and compared him to Rocky Balboa and John Rambo . 
 Lee Valmassy as L Dubba E , the leader of the 245 , a rival gang to the 248 . Jason Trost said the character is similar to Mr. T and that Valmassy was " so embarrassed ... when he first [ played the part ] he almost didn 't want to talk to me again " . Valmassy also appears several times as a background extra . 
 Caitlyn Folley as Stacy , L Dubba E 's girlfriend and JTRO 's old friend . 
 Art Hsu as KCDC , an energetic member of the 248 and BTRO 's best friend who serves as the emcee for the Beat @-@ Beat Revelation matches . The directors said Hsu needed little direction because he played his character well . Hsu described KCDC as " the sidekick " and " the guy who ... guides people through the FP " . The Trosts originally wrote the character to be more bipolar and feminine but they decided to reduce those elements for the final draft . 
 Nick Principe as BLT , an abrasive member of the 248 and JTRO 's trainer . Jason met Principe during the production of Laid to Rest ( 2009 ) , on which he worked as a costume assistant and as Principe 's body double . 
 Dov Tiefenbach as Triple Decka 1K , a Russian Beat @-@ Beat Revelation player who faces JTRO . Tiefenbach engaged in method acting by maintaining his Russian accent on- and off @-@ set throughout filming .

 Jason Trost conceived The FP when he was 16 years old and regularly played Dance Dance Revolution . He noticed people playing the game intensely and thought of treating the gameplay " like some blood sport " . Trost made short films throughout high school before briefly attending film school . After dropping out , he used his tuition money to fund a short film , also titled The FP . The short film was based on the original feature @-@ length script , but only the first ten pages were filmed . The feature film recreated several shots from the short film . Trost said the feature film was inspired by what they imagined a Dance Dance Revolution movie made by producer Jerry Bruckheimer would look like . 
 The Trost brothers asked producer Brandon Barrera to act in the short film . After seeing their work , Barrera suggested that the brothers expand the premise into a feature film . The filmmakers placed an advertisement in the Mountain Enterprise , the Mountain Communities of the Tejon Pass 's online newspaper , encouraging community members to call if they wanted to help with locations , catering , donations , or by serving as extras or crew members on the film . 
 The Trost brothers named The FP after Frazier Park , California , where they grew up . Jason Trost said locals started referring to Frazier Park as " the FP " after The O.C. began airing . He also said the film 's story copies that of Rocky " beat for beat " and that there were " near @-@ plagiarism moments " . All the character names were based on his friends . Over 80 percent of the dialogue was based on phrases frequently spoken by several Frazier Park residents . Much of the profanity in the script was taken from conversations overheard by costume designer Sarah Trost at parties , and what the Trost brothers thought of on set . Further inspiration for the dialogue came from Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas and Def Jam : Fight for NY , both of which Jason Trost played alongside Dance Dance Revolution . 
 The settings in The FP were written using the materials that the Trosts ' father had on his property due to the minimal budget . Jason Trost said he had seen several low @-@ budget films that " try to be something they aren 't " and did not want to feign the production value . When they are defeated in a dance @-@ off , characters in the film die of a " 187 " , which is slang for murder that originated from California Penal Code . The characters ' actual causes of death are unexplained in the film . The Trost brothers found depicting the deaths as ambiguous funnier and believed it would remove doubts about the film being a comedy . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Jason Trost ( JTRO ) , Lee Valmassy ( L Dubba E ) , Brandon Barrera ( BTRO ) , and James DeBello ( Beat Box Busta Bill ) reprised their roles from the original short film , while Diane Gaeta ( Stacy ) , Kris Lemche ( KCDC ) , and Torry Haynes ( Sugga Nigga ) were replaced with Caitlyn Folley , Art Hsu , and Bryan Goddard , respectively . Goddard was cast as a " rite of passage " for being a noteworthy resident of Frazier Park . Mike Sandow , who portrays Jody , originally had a larger part in the film but his scenes were almost entirely edited out for pacing reasons . 
 Most of the cast were friends of the Trosts . James Remar , a friend of the Trosts since childhood , agreed to narrate the film 's opening . The brothers had met Remar on the set of Mortal Kombat : Annihilation , on which their father Ron worked as the special effects supervisor . Brandon Trost knew Hsu and Clifton Collins , Jr. after working with them on Crank : High Voltage ( 2009 ) and invited them to join The FP 's cast . 
 = = = Costume design = = = 
 Sarah Trost was the costume designer for The FP ; she designed the costumes using fashions local to Frazier Park as her first influence . She was also inspired by the fashions of Elvis Presley , and the films Double Dragon , Rocky , Mad Max , The Warriors , 8 Mile , Escape from New York , X @-@ Men , as well as the works of John Carpenter . Trost based the opposing gangs ' outfits on American military uniforms of the American Civil War era . The 245 's outfits were based on the uniforms of the Confederate Army , while the 248 's outfits were based on those of the Union Army . The flags of the gangs were also based on those of the Confederacy and the Union . Trost designed the 245 costumes to look clean and the 248 costume to appear gritty . Most of the costumes were made from materials available to the crew ; L Dubba E 's costumes were made from jumpsuits . The boots worn by JTRO and BTRO were snow expedition boots . Most of the base clothing came from thrift stores , Sarah Trost 's fabric storage , and the Trost 's childhood clothing . 
 Trost designed the costumes to be distinct from one another . JTRO and BTRO wear very similar costumes , the only noticeable difference being a color inversion . Both costumes had American flag @-@ like emblems on the backs of their jackets , further enforcing the identification of the 248 with the Union . At the end of the film , JTRO takes BTRO 's outfit , which required Trost to readjust it for the height difference between Jason Trost and Brandon Barrera , who portray JTRO and BTRO , respectively . As the film progresses , JTRO 's color scheme changes from black and blue to military green to reflect his " becoming one with BLT " . KCDC 's ( Art Hsu ) costume was designed with ducks , referencing a speech in the film in which he notes the lack of ducks in the FP . Stacy ( Caitlyn Folley ) and her father ( Sean Whalen ) are both dressed to be somewhat transsexual , though it is more prominent in her father 's character . Whalen told Trost he would wear anything as long as his nipple was exposed at all times . Stacy also wears an I Love New York shirt , with the words New York covered in duct tape and " The FP " written over it with a marker . CC Jam 's ( Clifton Collins , Jr . ) costume was designed to be as colorful as possible to emulate rave culture .

 Principal photography took place in Frazier Park , California , with a budget of $ 45 @,@ 000 . It began in September 2008 and lasted 20 days , most of which were spent on Ron Trost 's property . Scenes set in BLT 's house were filmed at the Trosts ' childhood home , while the look of his basement was designed using the inside of a shipping container . Many set pieces were taken either from items Ron had collected or from other film sets . The Trost brothers split directorial duties between themselves ; Brandon focused on visuals and Jason focused on the performances and story . Valmassy directed a driving scene featuring himself and Folley when the Trosts were briefly unavailable . 
 Several planned filming locations were abandoned due to budget constraints . For thematic reasons , the film 's penultimate fight scene between JTRO and L Dubba E was originally set at Dawn 's Liquor Mart — a key location in the film . The store 's owners refused permission for filming and the location was changed to a long @-@ abandoned gas station . Bryan Goddard , who portrays Sugga Nigga , acquired permission for the crew to film on the property . 
 The penultimate dance @-@ off was filmed in three eight @-@ minute long takes and edited down . Brandon Trost would " float around with the camera " while Valmassy and Jason Trost performed the dance @-@ off sequence . While filming a tire training scene , Brandon asked Jason to increase the amount of spins he was performing . Jason broke his ankle and relied on his costume 's snow boots as medical boots . 
 Director of photography Brandon Trost shot The FP using digital cinematography with Canon XH @-@ A1 cameras , which he had recently used while filming Crank : High Voltage . Using a single @-@ camera setup , he filmed The FP using 35 mm film to evoke the traditional look of films such as The Warriors and Total Recall . Trost ignored camera and lighting errors to make the film " feel genuine " .

 George Holdcroft composed the score for The FP . He was invited to a screening of the film by producer Christian <unk> , and asked if he could compose the music for it .

To emulate the sound of a choir for one song , Holdcroft sang the same segment more than 200 times using different voices and melodies to achieve the desired result . For another song , he sang in falsetto and altered the pitch of his voice to make himself sound like a woman . 
 Holdcroft had never played Dance Dance Revolution , though he was familiar with video game music — specifically the compositions of Koji Kondo , the score of Final Fantasy , and the music of early Nintendo games . The film 's soundtrack consists of 61 songs .

 = Omen ( Antestor album ) = 
 Omen is the fourth studio album by the Norwegian Christian extreme metal band Antestor , released by Bombworks Records on November 16 , 2012 . Recording began in 2010 , and was mostly conducted at the home of vocalist Ronny Hansen . The album cover is a painting by Polish artist Zdzisław Beksiński , and depicts a deformed , many @-@ fingered humanoid creature playing a trumpet . Antestor met with critical praise for its musicianship and the progressive sound on the recording . Critics described the sound as primarily black metal , though the band prefers the more general term " extreme metal " to describe the sound on Omen . 
 To promote the album , the band went on tour in Brazil in January 2013 , but encountered difficulties . The venue at Belém was cancelled due to a banking error , and while at Belo Horizonte Antestor was stormed by violent protestors antagonistic to the Christian beliefs of the band members , and police had to usher the band to safety . Despite these setbacks , Antestor considered the tour a success , and wished no ill will on its attackers . On February 18 , 2013 , a music video was released for the song " Unchained " . 
 = = Background = = 
 Antestor was founded in 1990 by Lars Stokstad , Kjetil Molnes , Øyvind Hope and Erling Jørgensen , under the name Crush Evil . After recording two demos and undergoing a lineup change which left Stokstad and Molnes as sole founding members , the band renamed itself as Antestor in 1993 . Shunned by the early Norwegian black metal scene due to the band members ' staunch Christian faith , Antestor struggled retaining a record deal . Its first album , Martyrium , was recorded in 1994 and had a few bootleg copies illegally distributed , but did not see legitimate release until 2000 . Antestor 's second album , The Return of the Black Death , was released in 1998 through Cacophonous Records , but the band claims that the label never paid Antestor any royalties for that album . In 2004 and 2005 , respectively , the band released , under Endtime Productions , the EP Det tapte liv and the studio album The Forsaken , both of which featured session drum work by drummer Jan Axel Blomberg , known as Hellhammer , who has played in strongly anti @-@ Christian bands such as Mayhem and Immortal . Despite a positive reception to the album , after 2007 Antestor consisted only of Stokstad and vocalist Ronny Hansen , and the band went into hiatus . 
 Several new members joined the band in 2010 : Thor Georg Buer on bass , Jo Henning Børven on drums , Robert Bordevik on guitar , and Nickolas Main Henriksen on keyboard . Rehearsals began in June , and Antestor performed at Nordic Fest in Oslo on October 28 through October 30 . On November 4 , Antestor announced that it signed a record deal with Bombworks Records . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Except for drums and the folk music instrumental " Tilflukt " , the album was entirely recorded at Hansen 's home in Norway . Drums were recorded by Børven at his home , while " Tilflukt " was recorded and mixed by Erik Normann Aanonsen and James William Makepeace at Salvation Room studios . In an interview with HM , Antestor explained that it had trouble finding a studio that it liked , as well as finding time when all members were available to record . Since Buer and Børven had the necessary equipment to record , the band decided it would take on recording itself . The band stated that Buer " really took the brunt of the workload and singlehandedly made it possible for us to record the album ourselves . " Recording began in 2010 , and Antestor uploaded a video clip from its recording sessions on September 4 . During recording , bassist Thor Georg Buer left Antestor in May 2011 due to commitments to his other band , Grave Declaration , and Aanonsen was recruited as his replacement . A few months later , Buer rejoined , this time on guitar , to replace Robert Bordevik , who had temporarily left the band . On June 23 , the Christian music website Indie Vision Music noted a video uploaded by Antestor that contained footage of the band recording . The recording process finished on July 31 , 2012 . On August 25 , Buer announced that he was leaving Antestor again , this time due to upcoming college studies . In September , Erik Tordsson completed the mixing and mastering for Omen at Solid Mix Studios , <unk> Castle , Växjö , Sweden . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 The album is primarily black metal in sound , though still retains the thrash metal , doom metal , and folk music influences of previous releases by the band . On Omen , Antestor took a more brutal and experimental approach . Most of the vocals are screamed and growled , except Unchained " , which features a passage with sung vocals , which Andy Synn of No Clean Signing described as having a " strong Pink Floyd feel to them " . Synn considered the album as a mixture of the aggressive assault of Dark Funeral with the more technical and atmospheric playing of Dark Fortress . Scott Waters , writing for HM , described the album as " progressive , post @-@ black / extreme metal that paints a dark , sullen landscape with lyrics that offer hope . " <unk> , editor @-@ in @-@ chief for the Czech webzine Echoes , described Omen as black metal with influences from thrash metal . Antestor itself does not consider the album black metal , preferring instead the term " extreme metal " . It explained to HM that 
 Black metal is dead . The progressive development has stalled and has lost its edge in the genre . We don ’ t consider ourselves black metal , but extreme metal . Other people feel that they have a claim on the name and concept of black metal , and we don ’ t want to keep ourselves within any box or confines . We just want to write the music we like . 
 " Treacherous Domain " contains slow , doom @-@ inspired riffing , while " In Solitude , " " The Kindling , " and " Benighted " feature a more progressive , technical style of black metal . " Tilflukt " is a short folk instrumental which segues into the double @-@ bass drumming of " Benighted " . Synn described " Remnants " as developing " a harsh , angular pounding rhythm that would sit well on any Gorgoroth album " ; " Tilflukt " as similar to the output of Windir , and " <unk> 's Grøde " as containing echoes of early Satyricon . 
 Apart from the final track , " <unk> 's Grøde " , and the instrumental " Tilflukt " , all song lyrics are written in English . Zuza Steck of the Polish magazine Musick Magazine noted the " unblack " - Christian - message of the lyrics and how Antestor demonstrates that a band can maintain an extreme atmosphere but take a different lyrical approach . Antestor expounded on the lyrical themes that " at the same time that we are Christians , we are also humans . I think almost everyone can relate to parts of our music and lyrics , for absolutely everyone – Christians and non @-@ believers alike – experience hard and terrible times . The Lord does not say we will not meet hard times as Christians , but that He will be with us and carry us through it , and that is a big part of the Antestor message . " 
 = = = Artwork = = = 
 The album features a painting by Polish surrealist artist Zdzisław Beksiński . The painting depicts a deformed , humanoid creature with many fingers , playing a trumpet . The band explained that it decided on this picture because " Our music represents the more broken and monster @-@ like feelings of our humanity , like the apparition in this picture . It seemed a very fitting cover for our return after seven years of silence . " 
 = = Promotion and touring = = 
 To promote the album , a music video for " Unchained " was released on February 18 , 2013 . Directed by Alexandre <unk> , it was the band 's first music video . Antestor played numerous concerts during and after the recording of Omen . On March 5 , 2011 , the band performed at Elements of Rock in <unk> , Switzerland . Though this performance was plagued by very poor sound , the band considered it a success . Throughout 2011 and 2012 , Antestor performed at several venues in Norway , Netherlands , and Germany . On January 30 , 2013 , after Antestor 's completion of its Brazilian tour , it announced that its keyboardist , Nickolas Main Henriksen , had left the group due to health reasons , but that no replacement would be recruited . On June 15 , 2013 , the band performed in <unk> , Finland .

 In January 2013 , Antestor embarked on a tour of Brazil to promote the album . Seven venues were scheduled - <unk> , São Paulo , Curitiba , Belém , Vitória , Belo Horizonte , and Rio de Janeiro . However , the show at Belém was cancelled due to a banking error which led to the band 's plane ticket being revoked . 
 While Antestor was playing at Belo Horizonte , the venue was mobbed by Satanist black metal fans who protested against the band members ' Christian beliefs . The band had received over three hundred threats , including death threats , since its announcement of the tour in October 2012 . At Belo Horizonte , approximately one hundred protestors gathered outside the venue , holding up banners , shouting " fuck Antestor ! " , and threatening kill both the band members and concert attendees . About thirty guards stood outside the venue , but the situation escalated and the protestors tried to storm the building . <unk> , the guitarist , reported that he and his fellow band members were kicked , beaten , and spat upon by protestors . As the protestors tried to tear down the door , the band waited for police to arrive , and then were escorted outside by two officers who were armed and wearing bulletproof vests . The minibus waiting outside the back door had had its tires punctured , so the band was instead escorted out the main entrance . The police fired warning shots and formed a defensive ring , allowing the band to escape in a waiting taxi . 
 After the incident , <unk> described his and the other band member 's situation as " trapped like rats . " While he said that the band is used to hatred from the extreme metal community toward the Bible and Christianity , nothing like this had ever happened to the band before . Aanonsen , the bassist and a father of three , explained that while he understood that the tour could have ended in death for him and the other band members , when violence finally broke out a Belo Horizonte he remained completely , unexpectedly calm . In retrospect he remarked that while it scared him , the concert in Belo Horizonte was the best he has ever experienced , as all attendees " defied so much " to get to it . He also noted that because of the attack , the band is now " twice as big " in Brazil as it had been before the incident . In a summary of the concert posted on Facebook , Antestor stated that 
 We could write in details about all the drama that happened after the show . But not on this page . We do not hate the angry mob who came to hurt us . In fact , our message in our shows is to love your enemy . So God bless everybody who stood outside chanting : Fuck Antestor ! Hope we can talk like reasonable people someday over a fresh squeezed juice . Extra special hails to our fans who had the balls to come although they knew it could be dangerous . Antestor salutes you and be blessed .

 Released on November 16 , 2012 , Omen was well received by music critics . They highlighted the drumming on the album , remarking on how Børven was able to match the skill and intensity of Blomberg . Steven <unk> of Cross Rhythms praised the drumming , guitar work , and harsh vocals . He concluded that " ' Omen ' is a breath of fresh air in the rather stale and stuffy room that black metal finds itself resting . " Scott Waters of HM wrote that " the musicianship is beyond reproach . To simply play that fast and accurate , even for four @-@ minute spurts , requires more than just talent . It requires skill and endurance . Much of the music on Omen display that skill and endurance and definitely accomplishes what it set out to do . " 
 <unk> , of Echoes , extolled Antestor 's expansive , unorthodox approach . Andy Synn of No Clean Singing , after a lengthy , track @-@ by @-@ track review , concluded that " It 's clear that Antestor have poured their all into this record , physically and emotionally , learning from their past successes and failures , in order to craft an album of impressive depth and detail , with a volcanic core of molten metal passion . " 
 Eric Strother of the website <unk> stated that " this band is as strong as ever . Omen is highly recommended not only to ( un ) black metal fans , but also to anyone with a tolerance for extreme vocals who is a fan of well @-@ crafted , creative metal . " However , Strother did note that he personally felt that the bass guitar was buried in the mix , and that this detracted from an otherwise near @-@ perfect album . Musick Magazine 's Zuza <unk> opined that the album is sure to satisfy the seven @-@ year wait after Antestor 's last release and that the skills in recording the album should not be underestimated . <unk> noted , however , that the guitar solos were not that impressive , and at times sounded as though they were forced , recorded only because the band felt obligated to do so .

 = Glass Swords = 
 Glass Swords is the debut studio album by Scottish producer Russell Whyte under his alias of Rustie , released by Warp in 2011 . The album was produced and recorded between 2008 and 2010 by Whyte , partially in his father 's home in Glasgow , Scotland and partly in his own home in London , England . The album contains vocal work from Whyte as well as London based producer Nightwave . The final six months of the production sessions involved Whyte attempting to choose and edit which tracks he felt were worth releasing on the final version of Glass Swords . 
 Glass Swords is a musically diverse album that critics found hard to classify as anything specific other than electronic music . The track " Ultra Thizz " was released as a single in September 2011 before the album 's release in October of the same year . Re @-@ worked versions of the songs " Surph " and " After Light " were released as singles in 2012 with new vocalists . The album received positive reviews from critics and was listed as one of the best albums of 2011 by The Guardian , The Wire and Mixmag and shortlisted for the Scottish Album of the Year Award in 2012 . 
 = = Production = = 
 Whyte stated that he began working on the album in " 2008 maybe " and worked on it for a two @-@ year period . Glass Swords was recorded in Whyte 's father 's house in Glasgow and in his home in London after Whyte had moved there . The album 's music was developed with Whyte not having a strong idea for it , noting that he was " just making tracks and not really thinking too much of it as being an album " . The album was created using Ableton on a personal computer along with a midi guitar controller , a midi keyboard , keyboard , electric guitar and a microphone . To give the album an analogue sound , Whyte used compressors and tape distortion plugins to get the tracks what he described as a " sort of warmth " . Vocals on the album were done by Whyte on the track " Surph " while his girlfriend Nightwave performed some of the backing vocals . Whyte described his music as trying to channel " good energy , just love and peace and happiness and joy . That 's what I want from my music , and that 's what I want other people to feel . " 
 The last six months of production were spent by Whyte " trying to glue everything together so it made sense as an album . " This involved adding intros to some tracks and other motifs to " make it make more sense " . Whyte created around one hundred tracks for the album and whittled down the album to a final selection of fourteen . These tracks were sent back and forth between himself and Warp which Whyte described as a " long process " as he found it difficult having people critique the music he wanted to release . Prior to the release of Glass Swords and any single , Whyte released the EP Sunburst in 2010 . Several tracks originally planned for the album were described by Whyte as " a lot weirder and more ambient " , but that Warp " didn 't really want that " . 
 = = Style = = 
 Music critics described the album as spanning several subgenres of electronic music . Spin opined that Glass Swords ' music " doesn 't adhere to any strict definition of genre beyond loose electronic " . A reviewer for Fact described the influences of the album as being from video games , progressive rock and " big room dance music " . while the BBC stated the songs on the album are " often jamming five or six recognisable influences into a single four @-@ minute track . " These included " glossy synths " , dirty south hip hop percussion and " fragments of dubstep , UK garage , classic Detroit techno and trance music " . AllMusic shared the multiple genres view , finding that it integrated " the currently hip and terminally <unk> – garish probes of ' 80s synth rock , beaten @-@ to @-@ a @-@ pulp dance @-@ pop , ' 90s rave , and bass music , to name four of several drawing points . " 
 MTV noted the pop culture references in Glass Swords , namely " Hover Traps " samples the video game The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time and the title of " Ultra Thizz " references Bay Area slang for the drug ecstasy . Pitchfork noted that the album 's more traditional dubstep songs " won 't sit still or do what they 're supposed to " . Specifically , " Crystal Echo " contains sped @-@ up voices and melodies with a dubstep @-@ styled bass while " Surph " used the bass drops related to dubstep but also includes what Pitchfork describes as " pop @-@ rave pianos , trance keyboards , and snippets of sugary R & B " 
 = = Release = = 
 A single of " Ultra Thizz " was released by Warp as a 12 " vinyl single and as a digital download on 6 September 2011 . For the Glass Swords album cover , Whyte was shown various designer 's portfolios by Warp . Whyte chose Jonathan Zawada , as he felt it had a " ' 70s sci @-@ fi art feel " . After discussing ideas with Whyte , Zawada gave him the album cover in a few days . When asked about the album cover resembling two erect penises , Whyte responded " Everyone says that ! That 's what I thought when I first saw it and I was like , " Am I okay with that ? " And , yeah , that 's fine . " Glass Swords was released by Warp on vinyl , compact disc and digital download on 10 October 2011 in the United Kingdom and 11 October in the United States . A launch party for Glass Swords was held on 1 October 2011 , which included a performance from Rustie along with DJ sets from <unk> , Nightwave and Spencer . 
 A re @-@ worked version of " Surph " was released as a single featuring Nightwave on vocals in March 2012 . In 2012 , a re @-@ worked version of the song " After Light " was released with Aluna Francis , the singer for United Kingdom @-@ based R & B group <unk> providing the vocals . Whyte 's follow @-@ up album to Glass Swords titled Green Language was released in 2014 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 At Metacritic , which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album has received an average score of 82 , indicating universal acclaim , based on 14 reviews . Pitchfork stated that " One of the best things about Glass Swords is that , for all of its pop @-@ goes @-@ clubbing bluster , it 's also as psychedelic , where the devil 's in the zillion little details zigzagging across the tracks " and that " there 's not a lot here that will redefine your ideas of what dubstep or electronic music in general can do . For all of Rustie 's skill as a sculptor of very 21st @-@ century beats , Glass Swords can feel just as much like a " greatest bits " collage . " Fact gave the album a five out of five rating , stating that " you get the impression that it 's the point Rustie has been building up to for the last five years ; an album made in relative isolation , with zero self @-@ consciousness , shame or thought for trend behind it . " Drowned in Sound gave the album an eight out of ten rating , finding that the album is " equally impressive is the fact that this formula ( or lack thereof ) never grows tired . Thirteen tracks of excess could easily have been a recipe for sighs , but instead it is consistently addictive and grin @-@ inducing . " 
 The BBC described Whyte 's music as " a little difficult to handle " but that the album " shows just the right amount of restraint to prevent total disarray . Even if the album weren 't half as much fun as it is , that feat would be worthy of celebration in itself . " Exclaim ! noted that " songs like " Hover Traps , " " Death Mountain " and " All Nite " are , at their core , extremely primitive . But it 's in the way that Rustie builds , deconstructs and sequences his songs that allows Glass Swords to work its way into your psyche . " and that " After a couple of listens , one may come to the conclusion that Rustie might just be a one @-@ trick @-@ pony . But , man , that one trick is perfect . " Mojo referred to the album as " easy to admire but hard to love " 
 Glass Swords was listed on several critics Best Albums of 2011 lists . <unk> and The Wire placed Glass Swords as the third and second best albums of 2011 respectively . The Guardian placed the album at ninth in their list of Best Albums of 2011 stating that the album was " the sound of uninhibited , unironic hands @-@ in @-@ the @-@ air joy : banger after banger after banger . " 
 In 2012 , The Guardian awarded Rustie with their First Album award , opining that " Rustie 's music first attacks like a day @-@ glo migraine , a couple of spins reveals an album imbued with real emotion . " Glass Swords was shortlisted for the Scottish Album of the Year Award in 2012 . In 2014 , Fact placed the album at number one on their list of " Top 100 Albums of the Decade So Far " , describing the album as " full of exhilarating , ecstatic , thrilling , fun and sometimes downright silly songs " and " It 's the sound of someone changing dance music by utterly disregarding dance music . " 
 Reflecting on the album in 2014 , Whyte stated that he felt that he " “ went kind of quite crazy on Glass Swords " and that he was " taking the piss with kitsch sounds and over @-@ the @-@ top silliness . " Whyte stated that his wanted his next album Green Language to be different and " more serious " .

 = German aircraft carrier I ( 1942 ) = 
 The German aircraft carrier I was a planned conversion of the transport ship Europa during World War II . The loss of the battleship Bismarck and near torpedoing of her sistership Tirpitz in May 1941 and March 1942 , respectively , spurred the Kriegsmarine to acquire aircraft carriers . Europa was one of several vessels selected for conversion into auxiliary aircraft carriers . As designed , the ship would have had an air complement of 24 Bf 109T fighters and 18 Ju 87C Stuka dive @-@ bombers . 
 Conversion planning began in May 1942 , and had the conversion been finished , she would have been the largest German aircraft carrier , longer even than the purpose @-@ built Graf Zeppelin @-@ class aircraft carriers . The work was canceled in November 1942 , however , after design problems , including serious instability and structural weaknesses , proved to be irreconcilable . No work was done on the ship , which was eventually seized by the US Army and used as a troop transport following the end of the war . 
 = = Design = = 
 The carrier I was a conversion proposal for the transport ship Europa . The ship was launched on 16 August 1928 and entered service on 19 March 1930 for the German Norddeutscher Lloyd shipping company . Starting in 1939 , the ship was used as a floating barracks ; the ship was requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine for use in the planned Operation Sea Lion , but the operation was abandoned when the Luftwaffe failed to achieve air superiority in the Battle of Britain . Following the loss of the battleship Bismarck in May 1941 and the near torpedoing of her sistership Tirpitz in March 1942 , the Kriegsmarine was convinced of the need to acquire aircraft carriers . Several vessels were selected for conversion , including the incomplete heavy cruiser Seydlitz and several passenger liners . Planning for the conversion of Europa into an auxiliary aircraft carrier was started in May 1942 . 
 The ship would have been faster and larger than any of the other ships Germany intended to convert into auxiliary carriers . However , a number of design problems emerged as the drawing up of the conversion plan progressed . Her speed and capacity advantages were offset by several serious practical problems . These included structural weakness , caused by the need to recess the hangar deck into the primary structural deck ; instability , normally resolved by adding bulges ; and high fuel consumption . Another significant obstacle was the unwillingness of Hermann Göring , the commander in chief of the Luftwaffe , to provide the Kriegsmarine with sufficient aircraft and pilots . By the time the design was completed in November 1942 , these problems had proved impossible to rectify , and so the project was abandoned . As a result , no construction work began . After the end of the war , Europa was seized by the US Army and commissioned as a troop transport under the name AP 177 before being transferred to France , where she resumed her commercial duties .

 I was 280 meters ( 920 ft ) long at the waterline , and 291 @.@ 5 m ( 956 ft ) long overall , which was approximately 30 m ( 98 ft ) longer than the Graf Zeppelin @-@ class aircraft carriers . The ship initially had a beam of 31 m ( 102 ft ) , but bulges added during the design process to help stability increased the beam to 37 m ( 121 ft ) . The ship had a draft of 8 @.@ 5 m ( 28 ft ) as designed , but the conversion would have increased it to 10 @.@ 3 m ( 34 ft ) . I displaced 44 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 43 @,@ 000 long tons ; 49 @,@ 000 short tons ) at the designed weight , and up to 56 @,@ 500 t ( 55 @,@ 600 long tons ; 62 @,@ 300 short tons ) at maximum displacement . The ship 's hull was divided into 16 watertight compartments and was equipped with a double bottom . The percentage of the length of the hull the double bottom extended is unknown . The ship 's flight deck was 276 m ( 906 ft ) long and 30 m ( 98 ft ) wide . There was a single hangar that was 216 m ( 709 ft ) long , 25 m ( 82 ft ) wide forward , and 30 m ( 98 ft ) wide aft . No armor was to have been added to the ship during the conversion process . 
 The ship was propelled by four sets of Blohm & Voss geared turbines that drove four shafts , each with a four @-@ bladed screw that was 5 m ( 16 ft ) in diameter . The turbines were powered by 24 double @-@ ended narrow water tube boilers that produced up to 21 atmospheres of pressure . The engines were rated for 100 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 75 @,@ 000 kW ) , and provided a top speed of 26 @.@ 5 knots ( 49 @.@ 1 km / h ; 30 @.@ 5 mph ) . At the maximum speed , the ship could steam for 5 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 9 @,@ 300 km ; 5 @,@ 800 mi ) ; at a cruising speed of 19 kn ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) , the cruising range doubled , to 10 @,@ 000 nmi ( 19 @,@ 000 km ; 12 @,@ 000 mi ) . The ship was designed to store up to 6 @,@ 500 t ( 6 @,@ 400 long tons ; 7 @,@ 200 short tons ) of fuel oil , but total fuel bunkerage was 8 @,@ 500 t ( 8 @,@ 400 long tons ; 9 @,@ 400 short tons ) . I had only one rudder . The electrical power plant comprised four diesel generators that provided 520 kilowatts and two emergency generators that provided 100 kW each . The total power output was 2 @,@ 280 kW at 230 volts . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The ship was to have been armed with twelve 10 @.@ 5 @-@ centimeter ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) L / 65 anti @-@ aircraft guns in six twin mounts , three forward and three aft of the island and funnel . These guns had a total of 4 @,@ 800 rounds , or 400 rounds per gun . The 10 @.@ 5 cm guns fired two types of projectiles : a 58 @.@ 4 kg ( 129 lb ) high explosive shell and a 51 @.@ 8 kg ( 114 lb ) incendiary round . Both types of ammunition used a single propellant charge : the 11 @.@ 46 kg ( 25 @.@ 3 lb ) RPC / 32 charge . The guns could elevate to 80 degrees , and could hit targets flying at 12 @,@ 500 m ( 13 @,@ 700 yd ) . When the guns were used to engage surface targets , they could hit targets 17 @,@ 700 m ( 19 @,@ 400 yd ) away , at an elevation of 45 degrees . 
 There were also to have been twenty 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) anti @-@ aircraft guns , also in double mounts . These guns were placed along both sides of the flight deck , and had a total of 40 @,@ 000 shells . The 3 @.@ 7 cm guns fired 0 @.@ 742 kg ( 1 @.@ 64 lb ) high @-@ explosive shells at a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute , and a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 000 m / s ( 3 @,@ 281 ft / s ) . The guns could elevate to 85 degrees and hit targets flying at 6 @,@ 800 m ( 7 @,@ 400 yd ) , although the tracers were limited to 4 @,@ 800 m ( 5 @,@ 200 yd ) . 
 The anti @-@ aircraft battery was rounded out by twenty @-@ eight to thirty @-@ six 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) guns in the usual Flakvierling quadruple mounts , supplied by a store of up to 72 @,@ 000 rounds . These guns fired at a rate of 480 shells per minute cyclic , but were limited in practice to around 200 rounds per minute . The shells were fired at a muzzle velocity of between 800 – 835 m / s ( 2 @,@ 625 – 2 @,@ 740 ft / s ) , depending on the type of shell fired . The effective ceiling of the guns was 3 @,@ 700 m ( 4 @,@ 000 yd ) at 85 degrees elevation . 
 The ship was designed to carry 18 Ju 87 " Stuka " dive @-@ bombers and 24 Bf 109 . The Ju 87s were to have been the " E " variant , which was a navalized version of the Ju 87D , and were modified for catapult launches and were equipped with arresting gear . The Bf 109 fighters were a navalized version of the " E " model , designated as Bf 109T . Their wings were longer than the land @-@ based model to allow for shorter take @-@ off .

 A Bug 's Life is a 1998 American 3D computer @-@ animated comedy adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures . Directed by John Lasseter and co @-@ directed by Andrew Stanton , the film involves a misfit ant , Flik , that is looking for " tough warriors " to save his colony from greedy grasshoppers , only to recruit a group of bugs that turn out to be an inept circus troupe . Randy Newman composed the music for the film , which stars the voices of Dave Foley , Kevin Spacey , Julia Louis @-@ Dreyfus , Hayden Panettiere , Phyllis Diller , Richard Kind , David Hyde Pierce , Joe Ranft , Denis Leary , John Ratzenberger , Jonathan Harris , Madeline Kahn , Bonnie Hunt , Mike McShane and Brad Garrett . 
 The film is inspired by Aesop 's fable The Ant and the Grasshopper . Production began shortly after the release of Toy Story in 1995 . The screenplay was penned by Stanton and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw . The ants in the film were redesigned to be more appealing , and Pixar 's animation unit employed new technical innovations in computer animation . During production , the filmmakers became embroiled in a public feud with DreamWorks Animation due to their similar film , Antz , which was released the same year . 
 The film was released to theaters on November 25 , 1998 , and was a box office success , surpassing competition and grossing $ 363 million in receipts . It received positive reviews from film critics , who commended the storyline and animation , while others criticized it by comparing it to Antz . The film has been released multiple times on home video . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Flik , an individualist and would @-@ be inventor , lives in a colony of ants in the middle of a dried creek . They are led by Princess Atta and her mother , the Queen . The colony is oppressed by a gang of marauding grasshoppers , led by Hopper , that arrive every season demanding food from the ants . One day , when the annual offering is accidentally knocked into a stream by Flik 's latest invention , a grain @-@ harvesting device , the grasshoppers demand twice as much food as compensation . The ants trick Flik into accepting his plan to recruit " warrior bugs " to fight off the grasshoppers . While Flik actually believes in the plan , the other ants see it as an opportunity to get rid of Flik and save themselves trouble . 
 Making his way to the " big city " ( a heap of trash under a trailer ) , Flik mistakes a group of circus bugs that have recently been dismissed by their money @-@ hungry ringmaster , P.T. Flea , for the warrior bugs he seeks . The bugs , in turn , mistake Flik for a talent agent and accept his offer to travel with him back to Ant Island . After they arrive , the circus bugs and Flik both discover their mutual misunderstandings during a welcome performance by the ants . The circus bugs then attempt to leave , but are forced back by a bird that attacks the group . They save Dot , Atta 's younger sister , from the bird as they flee , gaining the ants ' respect in the process . At Flik 's insistence , they continue the ruse of being " warriors " so the troupe can continue to enjoy the attention and hospitality of the ants . The bird encounter inspires Flik into creating a false bird to scare away the grasshoppers . While the bird is being built , Hopper reveals to the other grasshoppers how greatly the ants outnumber them and worries that they will eventually turn on them . 
 The bird is constructed , but during a celebration party , the truth about the circus bugs is revealed when P.T. Flea arrives searching for them . Outraged at Flik 's deception , the ants exile him and desperately gather food for a new offering to the grasshoppers . When the grasshoppers discover the mediocre offering upon their arrival , they take control of the entire colony , demanding the ants ' winter store of food . After overhearing Hopper 's plan to kill the Queen , Dot leaves in search of Flik and the circus bugs and has them use the bird model to save the colony . 
 The bird nearly works , but P.T. Flea , also mistaking it for a real bird , lights it on fire , exposing it as a decoy . Hopper beats Flik in retaliation , and proclaims that the ants are lowly life forms and live to serve the grasshoppers . However , Flik retorts that the ants are actually independent , without helping the grasshoppers . This inspires the entire colony along with the circus bugs to force the grasshoppers out of Ant Island . Hopper , refusing to flee , is taken by the ants to be disposed of , but it suddenly begins to rain . In the ensuing chaos among the ants , Hopper kidnaps Flik and flies off . Atta rescues Flik after the circus bugs fail to save him . As Hopper viciously pursues them , Flik leads him to the nest of the bird he encountered earlier . Mistaking the actual bird for another fake one , Hopper taunts it , before he is picked up by the bird and fed to her chicks . 
 Some time later , Flik 's inventions are finally perfected and appreciated by the ants , and Atta professes her love for Flik . The ants congratulate Flik as a hero and bid a fond farewell to the circus troupe , hoping that they will return for the following year . Atta is crowned the new queen and Dot is crowned the new heir to the throne .

 During the summer of 1994 , Pixar 's story department began turning their thoughts to their next film . The storyline of A Bug 's Life originated in a lunchtime conversation between John Lasseter , Andrew Stanton , Pete Docter , and Joe Ranft , the studio 's head story team . Monsters , Inc. and Finding Nemo were also conceived at this lunch . Lasseter and his story team had already been drawn to the idea of insects as characters . Insects , like toys , were within the reach of computer animation at the time due to their relatively simple surfaces . Stanton and Ranft wondered whether they could find a starting point in Aesop 's fable The Ant and the Grasshopper . Walt Disney had produced his own version with a cheerier ending decades earlier in the 1934 short The Grasshopper and the Ants . In addition , Walt Disney Animation Studios had considered producing a film in the late 1980s entitled Army Ants , that centered around a pacifist ant living in a militaristic colony , but it never fully materialized . 
 As Stanton and Ranft discussed the adaption , they rattled off scenarios and storylines springing from their premise . Lasseter liked the idea and offered suggestions . The concept simmered until early 1995 , when the story team began work on the second film in earnest . At an early test screening for Toy Story in San Rafael in June 1995 , they pitched the film to Disney CEO Michael Eisner . Eisner thought the idea was fine and they submitted a treatment to Disney in early July under the title Bugs . Disney approved the treatment and gave notice on July 7 , 1995 , that it was exercising the option of a second film under the original 1991 agreement between Disney and Pixar . Lasseter assigned Stanton the job of co @-@ director ; the two men worked well together and had similar sensibilities . Lasseter had found that the workday of a sole @-@ director on a computer @-@ animated feature was dangerous while working on Toy Story . In addition , Lasseter felt it would relieve stress and the role would groom Stanton for a lead directing position of his own .

 In The Ant and the Grasshopper , a grasshopper squanders the spring and summer months on singing while the ants put food away for the winter ; when winter comes , the hungry grasshopper begs the ants for food , but the ants turn him away . Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft hit on the notion that the grasshopper could just take the food . After Stanton had completed a draft of the script , he came to doubt one of the story 's main pillars – that the circus bugs that had come to the colony to cheat the ants would instead stay and fight . He felt the circus bugs were unlikable characters as liars and that it was unrealistic for them to undergo a complete personality change . Also no particularly good reason existed for circus bugs to stay with the ant colony during the second act . Although the film was already far along , Stanton concluded that the story needed a different approach . 
 Stanton took one of the early circus bug characters , Red the red ant , and changed him into the character that would become Flik . The circus bugs , no longer out to cheat the colony , would be embroiled in a comic misunderstanding about why Flik was recruiting them . Lasseter agreed with this new approach and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw spent a few months at Pixar working with Stanton on further polishing . The characters of " Tuck and Roll " were inspired by a drawing that Andrew Stanton did of two bugs fighting when he was in second grade . Lasseter had come to envision the film as an epic in the tradition of David Lean 's 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 The voice cast was heavy with television situation @-@ comedy stars of the time : Flik was voiced by Dave Foley ( NewsRadio ) , Princess Atta was voiced by Julia Louis @-@ Dreyfus ( Seinfeld ) , <unk> was voiced by Richard Kind ( Spin City ) , Slim was voiced by David Hyde Pierce ( Frasier ) and Dim was voiced by Brad Garrett ( Everybody Loves Raymond ) . Joe Ranft , member of Pixar 's story team , played Heimlich the caterpillar at the suggestion of Lasseter 's wife , Nancy , who had heard him playing the character on a scratch vocal track . 
 Several of the film 's voice actors would voice characters in later Pixar films : Foley returned for Monsters University , Kind for Cars , Cars 2 , Toy Story 3 and Inside Out ; and Garrett for Finding Nemo and Ratatouille . 
 The casting of Hopper proved problematic . Lasseter 's top choice was Robert De Niro , who repeatedly turned the part down , as did a succession of other actors . Kevin Spacey met John Lasseter at the 1995 Academy Awards and Lasseter asked Spacey if he would be interested in doing the voice of Hopper . Spacey was delighted and signed on immediately . 
 = = = Art design and animation = = = 
 It was more difficult for animators during production of A Bug 's Life than Toy Story , as computers ran sluggishly due to the complexity of the character models . Lasseter and Stanton had two supervising animators to assist with directing and reviewing the animation : Rich Quade and Glenn McQueen . The first sequence to be animated and rendered was the circus sequence that culminated with P.T. Flea 's " Flaming Wall of Death " . Lasseter placed this scene first in the pipeline because he believed it was less likely to change . Lasseter thought it would be useful to look at a view of the world from an insect 's perspective . Two technicians obliged by creating a miniature video camera on Lego wheels , which they dubbed the " <unk> " . <unk> to the end of a stick , the <unk> could roll through grass and other terrain and send back an insect 's @-@ eye outlook . Lasseter was intrigued by the way grass , leaves , and flower petals formed a translucent canopy , as if the insects were living under a stained @-@ glass ceiling . The team also later sought inspiration from <unk> ( 1996 ) , a French documentary on love and violence in the insect world . 
 The transition from treatment to storyboards took on an extra layer of complexity due to the profusion of storylines . Where Toy Story focused heavily on Woody and Buzz , with the other toys serving mostly as sidekicks , A Bug 's Life required in @-@ depth storytelling for several major groups of characters . Character design also presented a new challenge , in that the designers had to make ants appear likable . Although the animators and the art department studied insects more closely , natural realism would give way to the film 's larger needs . The team took out mandibles and designed the ants to stand upright , replacing their normal six legs with two arms and two legs . The grasshoppers , in contrast , received a pair of extra appendages to appear less attractive . The story 's scale also required software engineers to accommodate new demands . Among these was the need to handle shots with crowds of ants . The film would include more than 400 such shots in the ant colony , some with as many as 800 . It was impractical for animators to control them individually , but neither could the ants remain static for even a moment without appearing lifeless , or move identically . Bill Reeves , one of the film 's two supervising technical directors , dealt with the quandary by leading the development of software for autonomous ants . The animators would only animate four or five groups of about eight individual " universal ants " . Each one of these " universal ants " would later be randomly distributed throughout the digital set . The program also allowed each ant to be automatically modified in subtle ways ( e.g. different color of eye or skin , different heights , different weights , etc . ) . This ensured that no two ants were the same . It was partly based on Reeves 's invention of particle systems a decade and a half earlier , which had let animators use masses of self @-@ guided particles to create effects like swirling dust and snow . 
 The animators also employed subsurface scattering — developed by Pixar co @-@ founder Edwin Catmull during his graduate student days at the University of Utah in the 1970s — to render surfaces in a more lifelike way . This would be the first time that subsurface scattering would be used in a Pixar film , and a small team at Pixar worked out the practical problems that kept it from working in animation . Catmull asked for a short film to test and showcase subsurface scattering and the result , Geri 's Game ( 1997 ) , was attached alongside A Bug 's Life in its theatrical release . 
 = = <unk> DreamWorks and Antz = = 
 During the production of A Bug 's Life , a public feud erupted between DreamWorks ' Jeffrey Katzenberg , and Pixar 's Steve Jobs and John Lasseter . Katzenberg , former chairman of Disney 's film division , had left the company in a bitter feud with CEO Michael Eisner . In response , he formed DreamWorks SKG with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen and planned to rival Disney in animation . After DreamWorks ' acquisition of Pacific Data Images ( PDI ) — long Pixar 's contemporary in computer animation — Lasseter and others at Pixar were dismayed to learn from the trade papers that PDI 's first project at DreamWorks would be another ant film , to be called Antz . By this time , Pixar 's project was well @-@ known within the animation community . Both Antz and A Bug 's Life center on a young male , a drone with oddball tendencies that struggles to win a princess 's hand by saving their society . Whereas A Bug 's Life relied chiefly on visual gags , Antz was more verbal and revolved more around satire . The script of Antz was also heavy with adult references , whereas Pixar 's film was more accessible to children . 
 It was clear that Lasseter and Jobs believed that the idea was stolen by Katzenberg . Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney split , often calling to check up . In October 1995 , when Lasseter was overseeing postproduction work on Toy Story at the Universal lot 's Technicolor facility in Universal City , where DreamWorks was also located , he called Katzenberg and dropped by with Stanton . When Katzenberg asked what they were doing next , Lasseter described what would become A Bug 's Life in detail . Lasseter respected Katzenberg 's judgment and felt comfortable using him as a sounding board for creative ideas . Lasseter had high hopes for Toy Story , and he was telling friends throughout the tight @-@ knit computer @-@ animation business to get cracking on their own films . " If this hits , it 's going to be like space movies after Star Wars " for computer @-@ animation companies , he told various friends . " I should have been wary , " Lasseter later recalled . " Jeffrey kept asking questions about when it would be released . " 
 When the trades indicated production on Antz , Lasseter , feeling betrayed , called Katzenberg and asked him bluntly if it were true , who in turn asked him where he had heard the rumor . Lasseter asked again , and Katzenberg admitted it was true . Lasseter raised his voice and would not believe Katzenberg 's story that a development director had pitched him the idea long ago . Katzenberg claimed Antz came from a 1991 story pitch by Tim Johnson that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994 . Another source gives Nina Jacobson , one of Katzenberg 's executives , as the person responsible for the Antz pitch . Lasseter , who normally did not use profane language , cursed at Katzenberg and hung up the phone . Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg began explaining that Disney was " out to get him " and that he realized that he was just cannon fodder in Katzenberg 's fight with Disney . In truth , Katzenberg was the victim of a conspiracy : Eisner had decided not to pay him his contract @-@ required bonus , convincing Disney 's board not to give him anything . Katzenberg was further angered by the fact that Eisner scheduled Bugs to open the same week as The Prince of Egypt , which was then intended to be DreamWorks ' first animated release . Lasseter grimly relayed the news to Pixar employees but kept morale high . Privately , Lasseter told other Pixar executives that he and Stanton felt terribly let down by Katzenberg . 
 Katzenberg moved the opening of Antz from spring 1999 to October 1998 to compete with Pixar 's release . David Price writes in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch that a rumor , " never confirmed " , was that Katzenberg had given PDI " rich financial incentives to induce them to whatever it would take to have Antz ready first , despite Pixar 's head start " . Jobs was furious and called Katzenberg and began yelling . Katzenberg made an offer : He would delay production of Antz if Jobs and Disney would move A Bug ’ s Life so that it did not compete with The Prince of Egypt . Jobs believed it " a blatant extortion attempt " and would not go for it , explaining that there was nothing he could do to convince Disney to change the date . Katzenberg casually responded that Jobs himself had taught him how to conduct similar business long ago , explaining that Jobs had come to Pixar 's rescue by making the deal for Toy Story , as Pixar was near bankruptcy at that time . " I was the one guy there for you back then , and now you ’ re allowing them to use you to screw me , " Katzenberg said . He suggested that if Jobs wanted to , he could simply slow down production on A Bug ’ s Life without telling Disney . If he did , Katzenberg said , he would put Antz on hold . Lasseter also claimed Katzenberg had phoned him with the proposition , but Katzenberg denied these charges later . 
 As the release dates for both films approached , Disney executives concluded that Pixar should keep silent on the DreamWorks battle . Regardless , Lasseter publicly dismissed Antz as a " schlock version " of A Bug 's Life . Lasseter , who claimed to have never seen Antz , told others that if DreamWorks and PDI had made the film about anything other than insects , he would have closed Pixar for the day so the entire company could go see it . Jobs and Katzenberg would not back down and the rivaling ant films provoked a press frenzy . " The bad guys rarely win , " Jobs told the Los Angeles Times . In response , DreamWorks ’ head of marketing Terry Press suggested , “ Steve Jobs should take a pill . " Despite the successful box office performance of both Antz and A Bug 's Life , tensions would remain high between Jobs and Katzenberg for many years . According to Jobs , Katzenberg came to Jobs after the success of Shrek ( 2001 ) and insisted he had never heard the pitch for A Bug 's Life , reasoning that his settlement with Disney would have given him a share of the profits if that were so . Although the contention left all parties estranged , Pixar and PDI employees kept up the old friendships that had arisen from spending a long time together in computer animation .

 Roxette is a Swedish pop rock duo , consisting of Marie Fredriksson ( vocals ) and Per Gessle ( vocals and guitar ) . Formed in 1986 , the duo became an international act in the late 1980s , when they released their breakthrough album Look Sharp ! . Their third album Joyride , which was released in 1991 , became just as successful as its predecessor . Roxette went on to achieve nineteen UK Top 40 hits and several US Hot 100 hits , including four US number @-@ ones with " The Look " , " Listen to Your Heart " , " It Must Have Been Love " , and " Joyride " . Other hits include " Dangerous " , " Fading Like a Flower " , " Dressed for Success " and " The Centre of the Heart " . 
 Before coming together to form the duo , Fredriksson and Gessle were already established artists in Sweden , with Fredriksson releasing a number of solo albums and Gessle being the lead singer and songwriter of Gyllene Tider , which had three No. 1 albums . On the advice of the managing director of their record label , they came together to record " Neverending Love " , which became a hit single in Sweden . 
 After the release of Don 't Bore Us , Get to the Chorus ! , a greatest hits record , the duo took a hiatus from the mid @-@ 1990s before returning with the albums Have a Nice Day ( 1999 ) and Room Service ( 2001 ) . They continued to chart in other territories , mainly in Europe and Latin America , where they earned various Gold and Platinum awards until the beginning of the new millennium . In 2002 , the duo took a break from recording and touring when Fredriksson was diagnosed with a brain tumour . Gessle went on to release solo albums and reunited with Gyllene Tider before Roxette took to the stage together again for the first time in 8 years , in 2009 , during Gessle 's European Party Crasher tour . In 2011 , they released Charm School , their first studio album in ten years . This was followed by Travelling a year later . 
 Their songs " It Must Have Been Love " and " Listen to Your Heart " continue to receive wide radio airplay , with both singles recently receiving awards from BMI for achieving five million radio plays . They have sold an estimated 75 million records worldwide , with over 10 million in certified units from Germany , the US and the UK , achieving gold and platinum certifications for Joyride and Look Sharp ! in all three regions .

 Per Gessle and Marie Fredriksson first met in Halmstad , Sweden , in the late 1970s . Gessle performed in Gyllene Tider , one of Sweden 's most popular bands of the time , and Fredriksson in the less successful <unk> and <unk> Barn ( Mama 's Children ) before both embarked on solo careers . In 1981 , Fredriksson sang for the first time with Gyllene Tider on stage and was featured as a background vocalist for a Swedish @-@ language album the band released in 1982 . Gessle also worked with ex @-@ ABBA singer Frida , for a song that appeared on her 1982 album Something 's Going On , setting music to a Dorothy Parker poem . 
 While working on her first solo album , Het <unk> ( Hot Wind ) , Fredriksson performed more background vocals for Gyllene Tider 's only album in English , The Heartland Café . The 11 @-@ track album was released in February 1984 and sold 45 @,@ 000 copies in Sweden . According to Gessle , the group 's first English @-@ language release was in response to interest expressed by EMI 's American label Capitol Records . Capitol took six of the tracks and released an extended play ( EP ) record in the US with an abridged title , Heartland , but the company insisted on a different name for the band . Gessle and the other members of Gyllene Tider ( Swedish for " Golden Times " or " Golden Age " ) chose the title of a 1975 Dr. Feelgood song , " Roxette " . 
 The newly named Roxette issued one near @-@ invisible release in the US , " Teaser Japanese " , whose video reached MTV 's studio but received no rotation to speak of . It , and subsequent singles , fared better in Sweden , and Gyllene Tider briefly toured the country to support the album . However , " the album died soon enough and the international career died before it even started " , Gessle wrote . " We decided to put Gyllene Tider to rest ... until further notice . " Gessle then turned solo work , recording his second Swedish @-@ language solo album , <unk> , released in 1985 and again featuring Fredriksson on background vocals . While Fredriksson recorded her second solo album , Den <unk> <unk> ( The Seventh Wave ) . 
 It was then that the Managing Director of EMI , Rolf <unk> , suggested that Gessle and Fredriksson should sing together . Gessle translated a song called " <unk> glas " ( " Black glasses " ) into English , which became their first single , " Neverending Love " . It was released in the summer of 1986 under the name " Roxette " and reached the Swedish top 10 , selling 50 @,@ 000 copies .

 After the success of " Neverending Love " in Sweden , Gessle and Fredriksson quickly recorded a full @-@ length album , translating songs Gessle had written originally for his third solo album . With the release of Pearls of Passion in October 1986 , Roxette maintained their commercial momentum in Sweden with their next singles " Goodbye to You " and " Soul Deep " . Some singles from Passion were released in other countries , however these international releases didn 't emulate their Swedish success . The album was followed by a compilation of remixes of the same songs entitled Dance Passion . 
 In 1987 , Fredriksson released her third solo album <unk> <unk> ( After the Storm ) . Meanwhile , Roxette released the single " I Want You " in collaboration with Eva Dahlgren and <unk> . Later in the year , they released " It Must Have Been Love ( Christmas For the Broken Hearted ) " after EMI Germany asked the duo to come up with an intelligent Christmas single . The holiday themed song received some attention in their native country as Roxette prepared their next album , though EMI Germany decided against releasing the single . Pearls of Passion was re @-@ released internationally in 1997 , and included " It Must Have Been Love ( Christmas for the Broken Hearted ) " as a bonus track . 
 = = = 1988 – 1990 : Look Sharp ! = = = 
 In native Sweden , " Dressed for Success " and " Listen to Your Heart " were chosen as the first two singles from their second album Look Sharp ! , as Gessle and EMI Sweden chose to highlight Fredriksson 's singing . Gessle said " I always thought we should promote the songs Marie sang . Me being a lead singer wasn 't part of the plan , not for me anyway . " Both singles reached the top 10 of the Swedish singles chart , while the album , which was released in Sweden in October 1988 , held the No. 1 position for fourteen weeks . Music critic Måns Ivarsson was underwhelmed by the album , " To consist of two such original persons as Marie Fredriksson and Per Gessle , the album sounds unbelievably conventional . Most striking are the lyrics . Gessle 's once so subtle Swedish lyrics have became desolate English nonsense . " The album won Roxette their first Rockbjörnen awards in Sweden and Gessle his first Grammis award in the category Best Composer . 
 When the third single from Look Sharp , " The Look " became another top 10 single in their home country , Roxette were still unknown internationally . It was while studying in Sweden , that an American exchange student from Minneapolis , Dean Cushman , heard " The Look " , and brought a copy of Look Sharp ! home for the 1988 holiday break . He gave the album to a Minneapolis radio station , KDWB 101 @.@ 3 FM . The station started playing " The Look " and based on positive caller feedback , the song became very popular , quickly spreading to other radio stations . The song became a radio hit before any Roxette product had been commercially released or promoted in the US market . The story was covered by radio , newspapers and TV in the US and in Sweden , with Gessle recently telling this as the story which highlighted the beginning of their international success . Fredriksson dismissed rumours that Cushman was paid to take the record to the radio station . 
 EMI had previously rejected Roxette as unsuitable for the American market and they did not have a recording contract there , but after the popularity of " The Look " in the US , EMI officials made the decision to release and market the single worldwide . " The Look " and pressed copies of Look Sharp ! were issued in early 1989 to record stores and radio stations . " The Look " became their first No. 1 in the US on 8 April 1989 , where it remained for one week . The breakthrough for Roxette became international when the song also topped the charts in 25 other countries , and at the end of the year , Billboard named " The Look " one of the 20 biggest Hot 100 singles of the year . 
 " Dressed for Success " , featuring Fredriksson on lead vocals with Gessle singing short parts , was the second international single . The single peaked at No. 14 on the Hot 100 as well as at No. 3 in Australia . " Listen to Your Heart " was released thereafter ; it differed from previous singles and instead resembled the guitar @-@ heavy ballads of Heart . Spending a single week at No. 1 in the US in November 1989 it bore the distinction of being the first US Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 to be not commercially available on 7 @-@ inch vinyl . 
 A fourth single , " Dangerous " , was released at the end of the year , entering the Hot 100 at the end of December . The single , a duet between Gessle and Fredriksson , spent two weeks at No. 2 on the Hot 100 in February 1990 , and again becoming a worldwide success by reaching the top 10 in important music markets such as Germany and Australia . " Dangerous " was released as a double A @-@ sided single in the UK with " Listen to Your Heart " . 
 = = = = " It Must Have Been Love " – Pretty Woman soundtrack = = = = 
 It was around this time that Touchstone Pictures approached EMI and Roxette about contributing a song to the soundtrack of an upcoming film , Pretty Woman , starring Richard Gere and Julia Roberts . Gessle has claimed that " It Must Have Been Love " , by then a 2 @-@ year @-@ old recording , was chosen because Roxette didn 't have time to compose and record a new song . The film 's producers turned it down , asking for another song , but Gessle declined to produce another song . Some weeks later after re @-@ editing the film before release , the producers re @-@ requested " It Must Have Been Love " , but Roxette had to remove the Christmas lyrics . Gessle and producer Clarence <unk> then took the old recording , had Fredriksson replace a single Christmas @-@ referenced line in the song and added some instrumentation and background vocal overlays . 
 Though not the first single released from the soundtrack , " It Must Have Been Love " would prove to be Roxette 's most successful single release . The song spent two weeks at No. 1 on the Hot 100 in June 1990 , three months after the film 's release , and stayed for two additional weeks at No. 2 , spending a total of seventeen weeks in the top 40 . Billboard named the song the No. 2 Hot 100 single of the year behind Wilson Phillips ' " Hold On " . The single also topped the charts in more than 20 other countries ( including Australia ) around the world . In Germany the single spent 9 months in the top 75 , and peaked at No. 3 in the UK , the duo 's highest singles chart position there . The soundtrack went on to be certified three times platinum by the RIAA . 
 = = = 1991 – 1992 : Joyride = = = 
 As 1990 wound down , Roxette completed its tour and returned to Sweden to record its follow @-@ up to Look Sharp ! The 14 @-@ track collection titled Joyride , which was released in March 1991 , became a critical and commercial success . It topped the charts in a number of countries and became Roxette 's best selling album . Their record company EMI invested almost 2 million dollars on promotion for the album , which stayed at No. 1 in Germany for 13 weeks , while staying on the US album chart for over a year . J.D. Considine of Rolling Stone magazine reviewed Joyride : " By emphasizing its sense of personality , Roxette delivers more than just well @-@ constructed hooks ; this music has heart , something that makes even the catchiest melody more appealing . " The album 's success brought the duo two Rockbjörnen awards for Best Swedish Album and Best Swedish Group , the second time they had achieved that feat . 
 " Joyride " the single became Roxette 's first No. 1 in their home country . It also topped the charts in more than 25 countries around the world , including Germany , Australia and the US ; it was their fourth and last US No. 1 . The single also charted well in the UK and achieved success in Canada which resulted in the song being nominated in 1992 for a Juno Award in the category , Best Selling Single by a Foreign Artist . Its follow @-@ up , " Fading Like a Flower ( Every Time You Leave ) " , a power ballad similar to " Listen to Your Heart " , with Fredriksson on lead , spent a week at No. 2 in the US in July and achieved success in other big markets as well . 
 It was then that Roxette embarked on an ambitious worldwide tour . The Join the Joyride ! World Tour 1991 / 92 tour eventually reached more than 1 @.@ 5 million fans in 107 concerts around the world , including a few dates in the US . On reviewing their Universal Amphitheater performance , Dennis Hunt of the Los Angeles Times said , " Fredriksson is squandering her talents in pop 's low @-@ rent district . She 's clearly superior to Roxette 's uncomplicated , hook @-@ crammed material ... " 
 The end of 1991 saw the merger of SBK , Chrysalis and EMI record companies , to form EMI Records Group North America . The resulting merger saw many personnel changes that resulted in a downturn in publicity for Roxette . Though Joyride was certified platinum and made impressive worldwide sales , subsequent singles from the album , the ballad " Spending My Time " and " Church of Your Heart " , failed to reach the heights of previous singles in the US charts . 
 Music tastes in the US were changing , with the emergence of new genres such as new jack swing , grunge , harder @-@ core rap and hip @-@ hop . As William Ruhlmann of AllMusic later wrote , " Americans probably lost interest [ in Roxette ] at about the time that Nirvana came roaring in from the Northwest . " In a 2009 interview with the BBC News , Gessle highlighted Nirvana and grunge music as part of the cause which contributed to Roxette 's downturn of success . Although Roxette 's commercial momentum in America was slowing down dramatically , elsewhere , singles from the Joyride album continued to become hits when " Spending My Time " and " The Big L. " charted in many countries . 
 = = = 1992 – 1993 : Tourism = = = 
 Roxette continued the Join the Joyride tour through into 1992 . It was during this tour that most of the material for Tourism : Songs from Studios , Stages , <unk> & Other Strange Places was recorded . Instead of releasing an album of brand @-@ new material , Gessle and Fredriksson re @-@ mastered older recordings , including several slated for but not included on Look Sharp ! and Joyride . They also recorded some of their live performances , recorded a country music inspired version of " It Must Have Been Love " in a Los Angeles studio , and recorded new material in various locations around the world – an empty dance club , a hotel room – and compiled everything on to the album . Released in October 1992 , Gessle and Fredriksson said Tourism was meant to " capture the energy within the band " . 
 The first single off the album was " How Do You Do ! " followed by the ballad " Queen of Rain " and an electrified version of the song " Fingertips " , originally recorded acoustically for the album and re @-@ titled " Fingertips ' 93 " for single release . Singles from Tourism barely dented the American radio and record charts but in the rest of the world , the first single " How Do You Do ! " , hit the top 5 in most European and South American countries . The album Tourism also charted well outside of the US , reaching No. 1 in Germany and Sweden , No. 2 in the UK as well as peaking at No. 13 in Australia . The duo 's success reflected in an ECHO Award nomination for International Group of the Year . At home , Roxette won a Rockbjörnen Award for Best Swedish Group . It remains the last Rockbjörnen the duo has received . In October 1992 , Fredriksson released her first solo album in Swedish for five years , titled Den <unk> <unk> ( The Eternal Journey ) . 
 In early 1993 , Roxette became the first non @-@ native @-@ English speaking artists to be featured on MTV 's Unplugged series , though the songs from the performance were never released on an official Unplugged album . In the same year , Roxette recorded and released " Almost Unreal " , a song originally slated for the film Hocus Pocus starring Bette Midler . However , the song was moved to the soundtrack of the film based on the Nintendo video game Super Mario Bros. Supported by an expensive video and ultimately receiving respectable airplay , " Almost Unreal " managed to briefly reach the lower end of the Billboard Hot 100 but charted highest in the UK reaching the top 10 , the group 's first time there since " Joyride " two years before . Roxette themselves were dismissive about the song , with Fredriksson saying it was " not one of our most inspired moments . " On the other hand , Gessle stated : " I still like the song in a way ... but if you wanted to make a parody of Roxette , it would probably sound something like this . " To coincide with the UK television premiere of the film Pretty Woman , " It Must Have Been Love " was re @-@ issued in September 1993 and entered the UK and Irish singles charts for the second time . 
 = = = 1994 – 1998 : Crash ! Boom ! Bang ! and Don 't Bore Us , Get to the Chorus ! = = = 
 Roxette changed their musical style with the 1994 release of Crash ! Boom ! Bang ! . Bryan Buss of Allmusic wrote , " They rock harder than on their pop @-@ friendly albums prior to this , and the result shows growth but not the fun that made them so popular in the first place ... Though the two have an edge on this album , they almost seem to have become a bit bored . " 
 Although Crash ! Boom ! Bang ! saw chart success ( No. 1 in Sweden , No. 2 in Germany & Australia , No. 3 in the UK ) , it didn 't sell as many as their previous albums . EMI America were reluctant to release the album , and instead promoted a shortened 10 @-@ track Favorites CD in association with McDonald 's . The Favorites of Crash ! Boom ! Bang ! CD reportedly sold about 1 million copies . It was noted by journalists that the McDonald 's promotion CD and other CDs by Tina Turner , Garth Brooks and Elton John , led to US music retailers of the time being unhappy with the promotion on several fronts , including that it bypassed established music stores and that the price of the CD was way below normal wholesale costs . Some stores refused to sell the albums published by EMI , with one major chain protesting by temporarily pulling all products from CEMA ( EMI 's distribution wing ) out of its sales and ad campaigns . Relations with EMI 's North American subsidiary , never on the best of terms , collapsed after the release of this album . Crash ! Boom ! Bang ! became the last Roxette release EMI would issue in the US , until Greatest Hits was released in 2011 on subsidiary label Capitol Records . 
 The first single release from Crash ! Boom ! Bang ! was " Sleeping in My Car " . The distortion guitar @-@ heavy pop song , born out of anger and frustration of the album 's grown up nature , reached No. 2 in Canada , as well as the top 10 in 7 European countries ( including No. 1 in Sweden ) as well as the top 15 in the UK , Australia and Germany . However , in the US it was less successful , reaching only the Billboard top 50 . Subsequent releases , the title track " Crash ! Boom ! Bang ! " , " Fireworks " , and " Run to You " , were less successful but managed to reach the charts in some countries . 
 Roxette then embarked on another , albeit scaled @-@ down , worldwide tour , skipping North America in the process . It was during this tour that Roxette became the first Western band to be allowed to perform in China ( Workers ' Indoor Arena , Beijing ) since Wham ! in 1985 . The procedure to get permission for this concert had taken over a year , and included self @-@ censoring the lyrics . In 2008 they were ordered to pay 4 @.@ 5 million kronor in unpaid taxes to the Swedish Tax Agency , for money earned during the German part of 94 / 95 tour . 
 In October 1995 , Roxette released their first greatest hits compilation Don 't Bore Us , Get to the Chorus ! , which reached the top 5 in many European countries including the UK , as well as the top 10 in Australia . It featured four new songs , three were released as singles , including the ballad " You Don 't Understand Me " , co @-@ written by Desmond Child . Also that year , a compilation of demos , B @-@ sides and remixes , alongside some of the 1993 MTV Unplugged material , was released in Japan and parts of South America under the title Rarities . 
 Gessle briefly reunited with Gyllene Tider in 1996 , then Roxette took instrumental masters of many of its ballads and recorded translated Spanish lyrics over them . The resulting album , <unk> En Español , sold well in Spanish speaking regions reaching 2 × platinum in Spain and platinum in Argentina . The single " Un día sin ti " ( " Spending My Time " ) accompanied by a video directed by Jonas Åkerlund , became their first Latin Pop Airplay chart entry . The duo then released solo albums , I en tid som <unk> ( In a Time Like Ours ) by Fredriksson and The World According to Gessle by Gessle , with both charting in Sweden . 
 = = = 1999 – 2001 : Have a Nice Day and Room Service = = = 
 Gessle and Fredriksson reunited in 1998 to record material for a new Roxette album , Have a Nice Day , which was released in March 1999 and gave Roxette a comeback in continental Europe . It entered at No. 1 in Sweden and No. 2 in Germany . The first single , " Wish I Could Fly " , became their highest charting UK single since 1993 ( No. 11 ) . In Sweden it charted at No. 4 , their best position since " Sleeping in My Car " . Although the second single , " Anyone " , didn 't chart well in Europe , " Stars " , the third single , charted well in Scandinavian and German speaking countries . NME 's review called Have a Nice Day " ... another clever @-@ clever bastard of an album which defies Doctor Rock " . A review of " I Wish I could Fly " by Håkan Steen of Aftonbladet said " The come @-@ back single is a disappointment . The lyrics which conveys a sense of distance in a relationship , are not particularly engaging . " The album , according to Billboard magazine , was under discussion for release in the US but ultimately it was not released there . 
 In 2000 , Fredriksson released a greatest hits compilation called <unk> ( At Last ) , which went on to be a big seller in Sweden , peaking at No. 1 for three weeks . Meanwhile , Roxette signed a US distribution deal with Edel Music , which re @-@ released Don 't Bore Us , Get to the Chorus ! , replacing some non @-@ US hits with songs from Have a Nice Day . To promote the release the duo did a small tour of America , performing at the Boston <unk> and at the Virgin Megastore in Times Square . The single " Wish I Could Fly " included in the album reached No. 27 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart and No. 40 on the Adult Top 40 tally . 
 Room Service followed in 2001 to a mixed response from critics . " Probably the best Roxette album since Joyride " , wrote Leslie Mathew of Allmusic , " Room Service is an exciting , immediate , high @-@ gloss pop gem that contains very little filler indeed . " Per Bjurman from Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet was critical of the album , " It is not very good . " he wrote . He did praise the three singles , " Real Sugar " , " The Centre of the Heart " and " Milk and Toast and Honey " , but ended the review with " Roxette is not finished . But soon , I suspect . " 
 The album topped the Swedish charts and reached No. 3 in Germany , but received little attention in the UK . A penned US release through Edel America Records did not happen as the label was disbanded due to financial difficulties , though it did peak at No. 2 on CNN 's <unk> album chart . The first single , " The Centre of the Heart " topped the charts in Sweden , made the top 10 in Spain , and the top 15 in Finland . The other singles , " Real Sugar " , the album 's opening track and " Milk and Toast and Honey " were less successful . Roxette again went on tour , this time in Europe only , as concerts planned in South Africa were cancelled after the 11 September 2001 attacks . On reviewing their <unk> Lila Arena concert , Bjurman from Aftonbladet said " Roxette succeed in all cases , to never leave the 80s . " , criticising Roxette 's playlist which consisted of some of their early hits . Johan Lindqvist from Göteborgs @-@ Posten was more positive , scoring their Munich concert four stars out of five . 
 = = = 2002 – 2008 : Compilations , solo albums and hiatus = = = 
 In 2002 , at the Grammis ceremony , Roxette received a Music Export Prize from the Swedish Government . After that came a set of compilations , The Ballad Hits in late 2002 and The Pop Hits in early 2003 . Each set contained a separate CD with material previously available and never heard before tracks . " A Thing About You " was released as the lead single from The Ballad Hits . The album was released in the UK on 14 February 2003 to coincide with Valentine 's Day and entered the charts there at No. 23 before climbing to its peak position of No. 11 a week later . It also peaked in the top 10 in Germany and The Netherlands . The single " Opportunity Nox " was released from The Pop Hits in 2003 . The Ballad Hits which sold over a million copies within a year , helped the duo win a World Music Award as the Best selling Scandinavian artist in October 2003 . In that year , Roxette were also awarded with achievement medals by King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden " for appreciated achievements in Sweden and internationally " . 
 In September 2002 , Fredriksson was hospitalised after she received concussion during a fainting spell at her home . She was then diagnosed with a brain tumour , which was later successfully removed in surgery . Four months later , Swedish newspaper Expressen reported Fredriksson had been diagnosed with a second tumor . This turned out to be false and the newspaper issued an apology saying its report had no basis but dismissed demands from Fredriksson for compensation . During her recovery , she recorded her first @-@ ever English @-@ language solo album , The Change . The album which was inspired by her brush with mortality , entered the Swedish album chart at No. 1 in October 2004 . With Fredriksson 's illness and rehabilitation , the duo took a hiatus , allowing Gessle to release Mazarin ( Cupcake ) in 2003 . It was his first Swedish @-@ language solo album in 18 years and became very successful in his home country , topping the charts and winning numerous awards . One of the tracks , " På <unk> <unk> stan " ( " Strolling Through the Town " ) , featured Fredriksson singing back @-@ up . In 2004 , Gessle and Gyllene Tider reunited for a 25th @-@ anniversary celebration that included the band 's first album in 20 years , Finn 5 fel ! , and another successful tour in Sweden . 
 In 2005 , Belgian dance group <unk> ' s trance @-@ cover of " Listen to Your Heart " became a worldwide club hit . Originally released in Belgium in 2003 , by the mid @-@ 2005 , the song reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 , and was certified gold in October by the RIAA . Also that year , several songs were released as re @-@ mixes and covers . Among them : two prominent versions of " Fading Like a Flower " , one a trance cover by German group Mysterio and one a sampling by Dancing DJs that reached the UK chart . In November 2005 , while Gessle was in the middle of promoting his Son of a Plumber album , he and Fredriksson appeared at the Dorchester Hotel in London for an awards presentation by Broadcast Music Incorporated ( BMI ) . Gessle received two awards , the first for " It Must Have Been Love " , which by that time had been played on US radio more than 4 million times , while he and co @-@ songwriter Mats Persson also received an award for Dance Song of the Year for <unk> ' s cover of " Listen to Your Heart " . The ceremony marked the first time Gessle and Fredriksson had appeared in public together since before the onset of Fredriksson 's brain tumour and subsequent surgery in 2002 . When asked by an Aftonbladet reporter if there would be a Roxette reunion , Gessle replied , " We haven 't decided yet . No doors are closed . We 're still young " . Fredriksson returned in 2006 with an album of Swedish cover songs , titled Min <unk> <unk> ( My Best Friend ) , while Gessle recorded two more solo albums , En <unk> man ( A Handy Man ) ( 2007 ) and Party Crasher ( 2008 ) . 
 In mid @-@ 2006 , Roxette released to radio " The Rox Medley " to promote a forthcoming 20th Anniversary package . The medley included six Roxette hit singles : " The Look " , " Joyride " , " Listen to Your Heart " , " Dangerous " , " It Must Have Been Love " and " Fading Like a Flower ( Everytime You Leave ) " . It was eventually released as b @-@ side to the single " One Wish " and was also available to download . The 20th Anniversary package better known as The Rox Box was released on 18 October 2006 to commemorate Roxette 's 20 years in the music industry . Spanning over 4 CDs and single DVD , it included two new singles , " One Wish " , which was their first new single in four years , and " Reveal " . Both songs were also included on a new greatest hits album , Roxette Hits , which was released at the same time as The Rox Box . <unk> of Expressen was disparaging of Roxette Hits , giving the album two stars and ending the review , " ... the CD subtitle Their Twenty greatest songs is a matter of discussion , I can only count eight hits . " 
 = = = 2009 – 2010 : Night of The Proms and European Tour = = = 
 Rumours started of a Roxette reunion when Gessle was interviewed by the BBC in April 2009 . " Yeah , we 've talked about it . It 's really up to Marie . " Gessle said . Online news sites also picked up on the possibility of a reunion . On 5 May 2009 , an announcement was made that " Roxette would re @-@ unite after 8 years and play for the first time on the Night of the Proms in Belgium , The Netherlands and Germany " . The tour started on Friday , 23 October in the <unk> Antwerp . Roxette were due to play the Night of the Proms back in 2002 , but Fredriksson 's illness meant they had to pull out . 
 Despite the Night of the Proms announcement , the first appearance of Roxette after 8 years was on 6 May 2009 , during Per Gessle 's concert in Amsterdam as part of his Party Crasher tour . Almost at the end of the concert , Gessle said : " I 'd like you all to welcome an old friend of mine : Marie Fredriksson " , then she joined the band to perform " It Must Have Been Love " and " The Look " . Later she also appeared on stage with him in Stockholm , at the last concert of his solo tour , 9 May 2009 . Later in July 2009 , they took part in the New Wave festival in Latvia . 
 In January 2010 , a concert at The Race Legends event in Sweden on 14 August was announced , followed by confirmation of other concerts in Russia , Denmark and Norway which took place during August and September 2010 . On 18 June 2010 , Roxette performed a one off set at Stockholm Concert Hall , performing " The Look " in front of Victoria , Crown Princess of Sweden , during the gala concert on the day before her wedding .

The set also became their first since 1992 's Tourism to reach No. 1 on the German album chart , where it was certified gold for shipments in excess of 100 @,@ 000 units . The album was preceded by the single " She 's Got Nothing On ( But the Radio ) " on 10 January 2011 , which became Roxette 's biggest hit in the German market since " How Do You Do !

 = Alcohol laws of New Jersey = 
 The state laws governing alcoholic beverages in New Jersey are among the most complex in the United States , with many peculiarities not found in other states ' laws . They provide for 29 distinct liquor licenses granted to manufacturers , wholesalers , retailers , and for the public warehousing and transport of alcoholic beverages . General authority for the statutory and regulatory control of alcoholic beverages rests with the state government , particularly the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control overseen by the state 's Attorney General . 
 Under home rule , New Jersey law grants individual municipalities substantial discretion in passing ordinances regulating the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages within their limits . The number of retail licenses available is determined by a municipality 's population , and may be further limited by the town 's governing body . As a result , the availability of alcohol and regulations governing it vary significantly from town to town . A small percentage of municipalities in the state are " dry towns " that do not allow alcoholic beverages to be sold , and do not issue retail licenses for bars or restaurants to serve alcohol to patrons . Other towns permit alcohol sales 24 hours a day . Retail licenses tend to be difficult to obtain , and when available are subject to exorbitant prices and fervent competition . 
 In addition to granting local governments wide latitude over liquor sales , New Jersey law has some other unusual features . Corporations are limited to two retail distribution licenses , making it impractical for chain stores to sell alcoholic beverages ; this restriction , in conjunction with municipal ordinances , severely limits supermarket and convenience store chains from selling beer as they do in many other states . State law treats drunk driving as a traffic offense rather than a crime , and permits individual municipalities to define the scope of underage drinking laws . 
 = = History = = 
 New Jersey 's history of taverns and alcohol production dates to its early colonial period . Colonial winemakers received recognition by the Royal Society of Arts for producing high @-@ quality wine , and a local distillery owner was asked by George Washington for his recipe for " cyder spirits . " Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries , the industry developed with the influx of European immigrants , specifically Germans and Italians , who presented a sizable market for alcoholic beverages and brought with them old world winemaking , brewing , and distilling techniques . With the rise of the temperance movement culminating in Prohibition ( 1919 – 1933 ) , New Jersey 's alcohol industry suffered ; many breweries , wineries , and distilleries either closed or relocated to other states . The legacy of Prohibition restricted and prevented the industry 's recovery until the state legislature began loosening restrictions and repealing Prohibition @-@ era laws starting in 1981 . New Jersey 's alcohol industry is experiencing a renaissance , and recently enacted laws provide new opportunities for the state 's wineries and breweries . 
 = = Controlling authority = = 
 = = = Statewide statutes and enforcement = = = 
 New Jersey 's laws and regulations regarding alcohol are overseen by the Department of Law and Public Safety 's Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control ( ABC ) , which is managed by the state 's Attorney General . The current director of the Alcohol Beverage Control division is Michael I. Halfacre . State and municipal laws , including those that regulate alcoholic beverages , apply in all territorial waters which includes inland rivers , lakes , and bays , and tidal waters up to three nautical miles from the New Jersey shoreline . 
 Starting in 1738 , towns in New Jersey began issuing liquor licenses to tavern keepers . Before federal Prohibition in 1919 , despite many state liquor statutes , the regulation of alcoholic beverages in New Jersey was almost exclusively local , with wide variations among municipalities . In 1933 , after the repeal of Prohibition , the states were again permitted to regulate alcoholic beverages . Immediately upon the end of Prohibition in 1933 , New Jersey instituted the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law , which established and granted rulemaking powers to the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control . The law also established a three @-@ tier alcohol distribution system whereby , with minor exceptions , alcohol manufacturers may only sell to wholesalers , who may only sell to retailers , who may only sell to customers . 
 New Jersey 's alcohol laws and regulations are codified in Title 33 of the New Jersey Statutes , and Title 13 , Chapter 2 of the New Jersey Administrative Code respectively . After New Jersey 's current state constitution was adopted in 1947 and some departments were consolidated , the department was incorporated into the Department of Law and Public Safety under the New Jersey Attorney General 's office . The statutes define an alcoholic beverage as " any fluid or solid capable of being converted into a fluid , suitable for human consumption , and having an alcohol content of more than one @-@ half of one per <unk> ( 1 / 2 of 1 % ) by volume , including alcohol , beer , lager beer , ale , porter , naturally fermented wine , treated wine , blended wine , fortified wine , sparkling wine , distilled liquors , blended distilled liquors and any brewed , fermented or distilled liquors fit for use for beverage purposes or any mixture of the same , and fruit juices . " 
 = = = Municipal control = = = 
 New Jersey has a strong tradition of municipal home rule . Local municipalities thus have considerable authority in the licensing and regulating of alcohol @-@ related businesses . These powers include : 
 limiting the number of licenses to sell alcoholic beverages at retail ( Class C licenses ) , 
 limiting the hours of retail alcohol sales , 
 prohibiting the retail sale of alcoholic beverages on Sunday , 
 regulating the conduct of any retail establishment licensed to sell alcoholic beverages , 
 regulating the nature and condition of the licensed premises 
 limiting persons within the municipality to a single liquor license , 
 limiting a license to cover only the specific licensed premises ; and 
 allowing municipalities with populations of 15 @,@ 000 or more to appoint a municipal alcoholic beverage control board of three persons with terms for three years . 
 Retail licenses for consumption or distribution are allocated proportionally to a municipality 's population . Licenses permitting on @-@ premises retail sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages ( i.e. bars and restaurants ) are allocated at a ratio of one license for 3 @,@ 000 residents . Distribution licenses are available at a ratio of one license per 7 @,@ 500 residents . Small towns with populations less than 1 @,@ 000 can issue at least one consumption and one distribution license . Given the regulatory latitude allowed municipalities , the actual number of licenses extant in a municipality may more or less depend on a variety of factors , including : 
 whether the municipality 's existing licenses were grandfathered by predating the 1948 imposition of statutory limits on the number of retail licenses per town , 
 whether the town has decided to offer fewer licenses , and 
 whether the municipality has decided by ordinance or referendum to become dry , and prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages within its limits . 
 Because the law grants a municipality significant regulatory latitude , 35 of the state 's 565 municipalities are currently dry . Conversely , because of the <unk> of licenses , several municipalities have a substantially higher ratio of licenses . For instance , the resort town of Wildwood has a permanent population of 5 @,@ 300 , but 61 active liquor licenses . 
 = = = Other authorities = = = 
 Casinos in Atlantic City and federal enclaves ( e.g. military bases , national parks ) are not under the jurisdiction of either the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control or municipal alcoholic beverage control boards . The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement and the New Jersey Casino Control Commission are responsible for the regulation of alcoholic beverages at casinos . Per Article I , Section 8 , Clause 17 of the United States Constitution , the federal government may " exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be , for the erection of forts , magazines , arsenals , dockyards , and other needful buildings . " While some state laws do apply in federal enclaves , court decisions have exempted military bases and other federal lands from state and local alcohol laws . 
 = = Liquor licenses and permits = = 
 New Jersey law provides for 29 distinct liquor licenses divided into the following five classes : Class A for manufacturers , Class B for wholesalers , Class C for retailers , Class D for transportation licenses , and Class E for public warehouses . State law allows the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control to create temporary permits " to provide for contingencies where it would be appropriate and consonant with the spirit of this chapter to issue a license , but the contingency has not been expressly provided for . " Special permits are allowed to range in price from $ 10 to $ 2000 , are limited to 25 days per year for a given premises , and currently there are 3 types of permits for non @-@ licensees . Excluding seasonal licenses and special permits , ABC licenses are issued for one year starting on July 1 , and ending on June 30 . 
 = = Municipal issues = = 
 = = = Availability of retail liquor licenses = = = 
 The number of Class C retail licenses for bars , restaurants , and liquor stores is limited by population and often by municipal ordinances . Licenses are typically obtained from existing licensees who choose to sell , or when a new license is offered as a town 's population grows . As a result , the price for a retail license is often prohibitively expensive . The sale of a new license is usually conducted by public auction . The intense competition can benefit a town by generating several hundred thousand dollars of revenue from the highest bidder . A 2006 license auction in Cherry Hill , New Jersey set the state record at $ 1 @.@ 5 million . 
 Supermarkets , convenience stores , and gas stations in New Jersey rarely sell alcoholic beverages because state law prohibits any person or corporation from possessing more than two retail distribution licenses . While licenses for bars , restaurants and liquor stores are limited , other retail licenses are not . Class C licenses can be granted without limit for common carriers ( such as limousines and boats ) , private clubs with a minimum of 60 members , hotels with at least one @-@ hundred rooms , and theatres with at least 1 @,@ 000 seats . 
 Special permits exist to allow for the sale of alcoholic beverages at golf courses , government @-@ owned facilities , and at social events run by non @-@ profit organizations ( for example , church carnivals ) . A restaurant in New Jersey without a liquor license can sell wine from a New Jersey winery by becoming an offsite retail sales outlet of the winery . Since the early 1990s , there have been a handful of unsuccessful proposals to create a separate restaurant license allowing eating establishments to sell beer and wine . Such proposals have been strongly opposed by current retail license holders who believe that it would decrease their income , and thus the value of their liquor license . 
 = = = Dry towns = = = 
 Some municipalities , particularly in South Jersey , are dry towns where no alcohol can be legally served or sold . Some of them are dry because of their origins as Quaker , Methodist , or other Protestant religious communities . For example , the seaside resort town of Ocean City has been dry since it was founded in 1879 by four Methodist clergymen . In recent years , several municipalities have questioned whether they ought to remain dry . Dry towns frequently have public referendums on whether they should remain dry or allow liquor sales in order to attract new businesses and increase property tax revenue . 
 Dry towns in New Jersey cannot forbid the possession , consumption , or transportation of alcohol , but have the option to permit or prohibit BYOB at restaurants and social affair permits for non @-@ profit organizations . In 2012 , Ocean City residents rejected a proposal to allow restaurant patrons to bring their own wine or beer to unlicensed establishments . It is possible for a dry town to have a winery or brewery that offers tastings , since alcohol manufacturing licenses in New Jersey are issued by the state , and are not regulated by municipalities . As of 2013 , there are 35 dry municipalities in New Jersey , down from 44 in 2002 . 
 = = = Hours of operation and other licensing regulations = = = 
 The hours of sale for on @-@ premises consumption are regulated by local ordinance , and closing times vary by town . Atlantic City does not have closing hours , and alcohol can be purchased at its casinos and local bars 24 hours a day . With the exception of Newark and Jersey City , the law forbids hard liquor packaged goods sales before 9 am and after 10 pm any day of the week . This can be restricted further by local ordinance . Liquor stores may sell beer and wine during any hours that on @-@ premises sales are allowed . 
 New Jersey regulations for liquor stores and bars are extensive . Licensed establishments may not offer nudity . It is illegal to sell liquor below cost , charge a flat fee for unlimited drinks ( except for private parties and on New Year 's Eve ) , offer any promotion that is contingent on drinking a certain amount of alcohol , allow patrons to remain after closing time , or sell liquor at a drive @-@ through window . Bars and clubs are prohibited from having a ' ladies ' night ' or any pricing which is regarded as discriminatory . Police officers are prohibited from working for licensed businesses in the same town where they are employed , and some municipalities require fingerprinting for all liquor store and bar employees . 
 Gambling and related paraphernalia , broadly defined by ABC to include claw and crane machines , casino @-@ themed video games , football pools , and door prizes , irrespective of whether any profit is being made by the business , are prohibited at licensed establishments . The only exceptions are for those bars licensed by the state to sell lottery tickets or have off @-@ track betting on horse racing . Charity bingo games or <unk> are also allowed . Card games , darts , billiards and other games are permitted as long as no money is exchanged , and no prizes are given . 
 ABC regulations permit a bar owner or employee to give away a free drink as long as it is not advertised . Businesses may issue free or complimentary drink coupons ( up to one per day per patron ) . Hotel and motel licensees may also give guests complimentary bottles of wine on special occasions . Licensed establishments are permitted to institute dress codes , cover charges , and minimum age restrictions . Liquor stores are allowed to conduct tastings of beer , wine , and spirits . Bars , restaurants , state concessionaires ( e.g. PNC Bank Arts Center ) , and non @-@ profit organizations with a special permit can host both tastings and tasting dinners , the latter of which permits larger sample sizes . 
 = = = BYOB : bring your own bottle = = = 
 Because some restaurants are unable or choose not to get a retail consumption license , the practice of " bring your own bottle " ( BYOB ) is prevalent in establishments statewide . Patrons are permitted to bring their own beer or wine to a restaurant that does not possess a liquor license , as there is no municipal prohibition against it . By law , a BYOB restaurant may not allow consumption of hard liquor or mixed drinks , nor may it allow consumption of beer or wine by those under 21 , visibly intoxicated , or during hours in which the sale of these products is prohibited by licensees in that municipality ( i.e. after closing time ) . Establishments offering BYOB are not allowed to assess a cover charge , charge a <unk> fee , or advertise that patrons may bring beer or wine . A restaurant or other business with a retail consumption license may allow consumers to bring their own beer or wine , though many do not . 
 New Jersey law prohibits strip clubs and " sexually oriented business " , where stripteases and erotic dances are regularly performed , from offering both full nudity and alcohol sales . Establishments that possess a retail license and serve alcohol can only offer partially clothed services such as go @-@ go dancing ( typically in bikinis or lingerie ) . Clubs that are not licensed to serve alcohol will work around the restriction by implementing a bring your own bottle ( BYOB ) policy and operating as a " juice bar " . Juice bars have the appointments of full bars but only serve non @-@ alcoholic beverages such as water , fruit juice , and flavored carbonated beverages . Such a bar could double as a service counter for the storage of BYOB material and offer ice and mixing services to create mixed drinks using the customer @-@ purchased ingredients . Recent court decisions have held that municipalities that allow BYOB policies for restaurants must allow the same practices for strip clubs . 
 = = Alcohol production and distribution = = 
 In 1981 , the state legislature began to reform the laws that governed the production of alcoholic beverages . With the passing of the New Jersey Farm Winery Act in 1981 , and laws providing for licenses for brewpubs and microbreweries in the 1990s , these two industries have grown significantly and the number of wineries and breweries have steadily increased . In February 2013 , New Jersey issued the first new distillery license since before Prohibition , and legislation has been proposed to make it easier to establish craft distilleries in New Jersey . As of 2014 , New Jersey currently has 48 wineries , 28 breweries , and 2 distilleries . 
 = = = Wineries = = = 
 New Jersey winemaking dates to the colonial period . In 1767 , two landowners , Edward Antill and William Alexander , Lord Stirling , were recognized by the Royal Society of Arts in London , which had challenged colonists in British North America to cultivate vinifera grapes and produce " those Sorts of Wines now consumed in Great Britain . " Shortly after , Antill wrote an 80 @-@ page instructional essay on grape cultivation and winemaking that was published in the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society . 
 While the cultivation of grapes and fruit trees supported a flourishing wine industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the effects of Prohibition and a legacy of restrictive laws after its repeal devastated the industry . For 50 years , New Jersey was limited by law to one winery license for every 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 state residents , which by 1980 effectively allowed for only seven wineries . The growth of the state 's winery industry has been bolstered by the 1981 New Jersey Farm Winery Act , which repealed many Prohibition @-@ era laws and allowed many small growers to open new wineries . 
 As of 2014 , New Jersey has 48 licensed and operating wineries which produce wine from more than 90 varieties of grapes , and from over 25 other fruits . Many New Jersey wineries sell their products at festivals that are held annually throughout the state . In 2012 , 1 @.@ 56 million gallons ( approximately 656 @,@ 000 cases ) of wine were produced by New Jersey wineries , making it the ninth @-@ largest wine @-@ producing state . A considerable portion of those are non @-@ grape fruit wine , particularly apple , blueberry , raspberry , and cranberry wines ; fruits produced by many farms in the state . The state 's wineries generate between $ 30 – 40 million of revenue annually . New Jersey law treats hard cider as a type of wine because it is made from fermented fruits . Although there is currently no licensed hard cider production in New Jersey , cider can be produced with a plenary or farm winery license , and several businesses have taken preliminary steps in establishing cider mills . 
 = = = Breweries = = = 
 The first brewery in New Jersey was established in a fledgling Dutch settlement in what is now Hoboken when the state was part of the New Netherland colony . It was soon destroyed by a band of Lenape in 1643 during Governor Kieft 's War ( 1643 – 1645 ) . Large German immigrant populations in Newark and Jersey City led to the establishment of a healthy brewing industry in the 19th and early 20th centuries . Brewing beer became the fourth @-@ largest industry in Newark , with names like Kruger , Hensler , and <unk> among the leading industrial families in Newark . 
 Later , regional ( and later national ) brands Ballantine , and Rheingold , and Pabst , among others , operated large breweries in Newark and surrounding towns . With accusations of German propaganda and persecution of German @-@ Americans during World War I , many of the state 's brewers relocated to the Midwestern United States Prohibition closed many of the remaining breweries in the state . For instance , of Newark 's 27 breweries before Prohibition , none exist today . As the industry reorganized and consolidated in the 1970s and 1980s to compete nationally , the larger producers like Ballantine ( in the 1960s ) Rheingold ( 1977 ) , and Pabst ( 1985 ) closed their doors . 
 Presently , the state is home to one large @-@ production brewery , Anheuser @-@ Busch in Newark , which opened in 1951 and is used for brewing Budweiser and Rolling Rock . New Jersey offers a limited brewery licenses for microbreweries and a restricted brewery license for brewpubs that has allowed the industry to grow in recent years . In 1995 , the Ship Inn Restaurant and Brewery in Milford became the first brewpub in New Jersey . Since then the industry has expanded to 28 breweries , most of which are microbreweries or brewpubs . In 2010 , New Jersey craft brewers produced 32 @,@ 000 barrels ( 992 @,@ 000 gallons ) of craft brew . In 2012 , New Jersey liberalized its licensing laws to allow microbreweries to sell beer by the glass as part of a tour , and sell up to 15 @.@ 5 gallons ( i.e. a keg ) for off @-@ premises consumption . The same legislation permits brewpubs to brew up to 10 @,@ 000 barrels of beer per year , and sell to wholesalers and at festivals . 
 = = = Distilleries = = = 
 New Jersey has had a long distilling history dating to the colonial era when large landowners converted surplus fruit into brandy , sugar into rum , and grain into whiskey . Until recently , New Jersey had only one licensed distillery , Laird & Company in <unk> ( Colts Neck ) . Founded by Robert Laird , it is the oldest licensed distillery in the United States and received License No. 1 from the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 1780 . George Washington , who was acquainted with the distillery 's owner , once asked him for his recipe for " cyder spirits . " By 1834 , New Jersey boasted 388 distilleries . 
 Today , Laird is the nation 's only remaining producer of applejack . Presently none of the company 's distilling takes place in New Jersey . Laird 's obtains all its apples from Virginia 's Shenandoah Valley and distills its products in Virginia . Distilling at its New Jersey facilities ceased in 1972 and Laird 's blends , ages and bottles its products in <unk> . In February 2013 , the state issued the first distillery license since Prohibition to Jersey Artisan Distilling of Fairfield , which currently produces and sells rum . Another prospective distiller , Cooper River Distillers in Camden is on the path to obtaining a license in the near future . Others are expected to follow . In August 2013 , the state passed a law creating a craft distillery license . The license costs substantially less than the plenary distillery license ( $ 938 versus $ 12 @,@ 500 ) , but limits production to 20 @,@ 000 gallons per year , and requires that at least 51 % of the raw materials used for distillation be grown or produced in New Jersey . 
 = = = Direct shipping to consumers = = = 
 Until 2004 , New Jersey permitted in @-@ state wineries to directly ship products to in @-@ state customers . The state did not allow out @-@ of @-@ state producers to ship to New Jersey residents or permit New Jersey wineries to ship to out @-@ of @-@ state customers . This practice was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2005 in a case from Michigan . New Jersey 's statute was subsequently struck down by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in 2010 because such limitations were held to violate the Interstate Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution . 
 On 17 January 2012 , New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed into law a bill that legalized direct shipping from wineries to consumers , and permits New Jersey wineries to open as many as 15 offsite retail sales outlets in the state . The law allows wineries that make less than 250 @,@ 000 gallons of wine annually , which includes all of New Jersey 's wineries , to ship up to 12 cases of wine to per year to any person over 21 in New Jersey or any other state that allows wine shipments . Because this prohibits 90 % of wine made in the United States , but does not affect New Jersey 's small wineries , proponents of the law fear that this section of the law will be struck down as unconstitutional . The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit had struck down a similar limit in Massachusetts in 2008 in light of the United States Supreme Court decision addressing direct shipping laws a few years earlier . 
 Federal law prohibits alcoholic beverages from being shipped through the mail . New Jersey effectively prohibits the shipment of beer and spirits to customers by requiring a liquor license to transport alcohol , but not having any class of liquor license that grants permission to ship beer or spirits . United Parcel Service ( UPS ) and Federal Express will ship wine to a person 's home , but will only deliver beer or hard liquor to a licensed business . Although uncommon , it is legal for a liquor store to deliver alcoholic beverages by car or van to a person 's home . ABC regulations mandate that the alcoholic beverages being delivered are paid for in advance , that they are received by someone 21 or older , and that they take place when the licensed establishment is permitted to be open . 
 = = Legal drinking age = = 
 = = = Underage drinking laws = = = 
 A person must be at least 21 years old in New Jersey to purchase alcoholic beverages in a retail establishment , or to possess or consume alcoholic beverages in a public ( for example , a park or on the street ) or semi @-@ public area ( e.g. restaurant , automobile ) . A person only needs to be 18 to own a liquor license , or to sell or serve alcohol ( for example , a waiter or supermarket cashier ) . State law also prohibits an underage person from misrepresenting their age in a licensed establishment . 
 It is illegal to serve alcohol to anyone under 21 , encourage an underage person to drink , knowingly allow underage drinking on property that one owns or leases , or possess alcoholic beverages on public school property without written consent of the school board or school principal . State law grants an exemption for religious services , and for parents and guardians over 21 who serve alcohol to their own children in a private location ( such as a private home ) . 
 New Jersey and all other U.S. states comport with the requirement of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 , which sought to set a national standard of 21 as the minimum age for purchasing and publicly possessing alcoholic beverages . To make states comply , Congress tied a state 's failure to enact a drinking age at 21 to a punitive decrease in a state 's apportionment of federal highway funding . Federal law requires colleges and universities that accept federal financial aid institute policies to sanction students who violate underage drinking and other alcohol laws , and to track the number of liquor laws violations . The Chronicle of Higher Education has reported that many colleges fail to comply with these laws , and federal enforcement is minimal . 
 There is no state law prohibiting consumption of alcohol by minors while on private property , but many municipalities prohibit underage consumption unless parents or adult relatives are present . Public schools are not permitted to have " 24 / 7 " conduct policies which sanction students for alcohol consumption outside of school . Minors are allowed to enter licensed establishments , and while state law does not prohibit bars and nightclubs from having events such as " teen nights , " or " 18 to party , 21 to drink , " some municipalities impose restrictions . It is legal for a person under 21 to be in a location where underage drinking is occurring , and New Jersey does not have an " internal possession " statute criminalizing underage drinking after the fact . 
 = = = Penalties for underage drinking = = = 
 The state underage drinking statute is a disorderly persons offense ( misdemeanor ) , which upon conviction is punishable by up to 6 months in jail ( rarely imposed ) , a $ 500 – $ 1000 fine , and a mandatory 6 @-@ month suspension of the person 's driver 's license . The penalties are the same for using fake identification . Those who unlawfully serve alcohol to an underage person , entice an underage person to drink , knowingly permit underage drinking on their property , or bring alcohol onto a public school property face similar sanctions , except that their driver 's license will not be suspended . A licensed business which serves alcohol to a person under age 21 , even unintentionally , may be fined or have their liquor license suspended or revoked . 
 Violation of a municipal underage drinking statutes is a non @-@ criminal offense , which has a fine of $ 250 for the first offense , and $ 350 for subsequent offenses . A person 's driver 's license can be suspended for a municipal underage drinking conviction , but usually it just results in a fine without a court appearance being required . There is a " good samaritan " defense to an underage drinking charge – if an underage drinker calls for medical help for another underage drinker who is ill , and cooperates with law enforcement and medical responders , neither may be prosecuted . It is common for a state underage drinking charge to be downgraded to a municipal ordinance violation in order for the defendant to avoid a criminal record and a suspended license . The statute of limitations for both state and municipal underage drinking charges is one year . 
 = = = History of New Jersey 's drinking age = = = 
 The first drinking age law in New Jersey was passed in 1846 . It allowed the parents of a student under 21 to sue for up to $ 10 ( $ 260 in modern dollars ) in damages against a tavern keeper or shopkeeper who supplied alcoholic beverages to their children . In 1880 , a criminal statute was enacted , fining businesses that sold liquor to people under 18 if their parents had told the establishment not to sell to their child . The law was amended in 1888 to eliminate the parental consent provision , thus making it illegal in all cases for a tavern or liquor store to sell alcohol to person under 18 . In 1908 , the penalties were increased so that a tavern keeper who served a minor could be jailed . Upon the start of Prohibition , New Jersey repealed its laws regarding the sale of alcohol to minors since the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited almost all liquor sales . 
 Upon repeal of Prohibition and the passage of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law , the ABC issued regulations that prohibited bars and liquor stores from selling alcohol to a person under 21 , which was considered the age of majority at that time . In 1939 , it became a criminal offense to sell alcohol to a person under 21 , and for a person under 21 to purchase or consume alcohol in a licensed establishment . The state criminalized the underage possession of alcohol in motor vehicles and other public areas in 1957 , possibly in response to young New <unk> traveling to New York , where the drinking age was 18 , and returning home with liquor . For many years laws against underage drinking and the serving of alcohol to minors did not apply on private property , though an adult who supplied a substantial amount of liquor to an underage person could possibly be prosecuted for contributing to the delinquency of a minor Furthermore , arrests and criminal prosecutions for underage drinking in bars or public areas were very uncommon before the 1980s . 
 New Jersey 's drinking age was lowered to 18 in 1973 as part of a broader legal change which reduced New Jersey 's age of majority from 21 to 18 . Much of the impetus for lowering the drinking age to 18 was to grant returning Vietnam veterans the right to purchase alcohol . Possibly because of concerns about 18 @-@ year @-@ old high school students being able to legally purchase liquor , and then illegally consume it school , the state raised the drinking age to 19 in 1980 . Citing statistics that indicated an increase in car deaths among drivers under 21 , the drinking age was raised back to 21 in 1983 . At the same time , the penalties for underage drinking were increased to include a mandatory driver 's license suspension . In 1985 , the state made it illegal for an adult to give alcohol to a person under 21 , with exception for religious services and parents serving alcohol to their own children at home or in a private area . 
 Historically , a few municipalities had ordinances against underage drinking on private property , but a class action lawsuit in 1998 against the town of Avalon nullified these laws . In 2000 , the New Jersey Legislature passed a bill criminalizing underage consumption of alcoholic beverages on private property New Jersey Governor Christine Whitman pocket vetoed the bill over privacy concerns : " While I completely support the intent of the bill , I am concerned that the bill 's prohibitions could be construed to apply to situations in which an underage person consumes even a small amount of alcohol under the watchful eye of an adult family member . " Later that year , Whitman signed a revised bill that allowed municipalities to pass ordinance prohibiting underage drinking on private property . Besides giving municipalities a choice on whether to implement such a policy , the revised bill imposed substantially lighter penalties on underage drinkers , and the new law made an exception for alcohol provided by any relative , not just a parent or guardian .

 = = = DUI laws = = = 
 Like all other US states , New Jersey sets a 0 @.@ 08 percent weight by volume blood alcohol content ( BAC ) as the threshold for intoxication when operating a motor vehicle ( e.g. automobile , boat ) . It is possible to be charged with driving under the influence ( DUI ) with a BAC level below 0 @.@ 08 % , but there is a presumption in that situation that the driver is not intoxicated . State law prohibits those under 21 from driving if their BAC is 0 @.@ 01 % or more , prohibits the operation of a commercial vehicle with a BAC of 0 @.@ 04 % or more , and mandates that drivers submit a breath sample if requested by a police officer . To be convicted of DUI in New Jersey , a person must be operating or attempting to operate a motorized vehicle ; thus activities such as sleeping in a car while intoxicated or bicycling while drunk are not illegal . 
 Drivers are not legally required to take field sobriety tests , although the results are admissible in court . The <unk> has replaced the <unk> as the standard device for determining blood alcohol level . When a driver is arrested for DUI , the police are prohibited from using force to obtain a breath , blood , or urine sample , and must warn the driver of the consequences of refusing a breath sample . In 2010 , the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the breath sample refusal conviction of a non @-@ English speaking driver , ruling that drivers must be notified of the law in a language that they understand . A person can be charged with DUI or breath refusal up to 90 days after the incident , except in cases of serious injury or death , in which case the statute of limitations is 5 years . 
 New Jersey is one of only two states ( along with Wisconsin ) that classify DUI as a traffic violation , and not a criminal offense , except in cases of serious injury or death . Because it is not a criminal offense , those charged in New Jersey with DUI and related offenses are not fingerprinted , do not have the right to a jury trial , DUI arrests and convictions are not submitted to the FBI 's <unk> criminal database , and DUI arrests and convictions cannot be expunged . Statutory criminal defenses ( e.g. duress , entrapment ) are not available for DUI , and in State v. Hammond , the state Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a person who drove after unknowingly having his drink spiked with alcohol . Common @-@ law criminal defenses are available in DUI cases , and a state appellate court reversed the conviction of a person who drove while intoxicated in order to escape assailants , citing the doctrine of necessity . 
 = = = Penalties for DUI = = = 
 Penalties for DUI vary by level of intoxication and number of previous convictions . A first offense DUI with a BAC level of less than 0 @.@ 10 % faces a fine of $ 250 to $ 400 , an automobile insurance surcharge of $ 1000 per year for 3 years , 12 hours of alcohol education , a 3 @-@ month license suspension , and imprisonment for up to 30 days ( rarely imposed ) . If the driver 's BAC level is 0 @.@ 10 % or greater , the fine increases to $ 300 to $ 500 , and the license suspension increase to 7 to 12 months . If the driver 's BAC level is 0 @.@ 15 % or greater , the driver will be required to have an ignition interlock device installed in their car for 6 to 12 months after they have their license restored . New Jersey does not have administrative license revocation , and thus a suspected drunk driver 's license is not suspended until they are convicted . 
 A person under 21 who is convicted of driving with a BAC level of at least 0 @.@ 01 % , but less than 0 @.@ 08 % will have their driver 's license suspended for 1 to 3 months , be required to perform 15 – 30 hours of community service , and take part in an alcohol education program . Penalties for refusal to submit a breath sample are the same as driving with a BAC over 0 @.@ 15 % . The holder of a commercial driver 's license ( CDL ) is subject to a one @-@ year suspension of their CDL for the first offense , and a lifetime CDL suspension for repeat offenses if they drive a commercial vehicle with a BAC of 0 @.@ 04 % or greater , drive an automobile with a BAC of 0 @.@ 08 % or greater , or refuse to submit a breath sample . More severe penalties may be imposed if the DUI took place within 1000 feet of a school , or if there was a juvenile in the vehicle . DUI accidents resulting in serious injury or death are considered indictable crimes . 
 New Jersey prohibits plea bargaining in DUI cases unless the prosecutor believes there is insufficient evidence to prove the case , and New Jersey does not offer hardship ( work ) licenses for people convicted of DUI . Because DUI is not a criminal offense in New Jersey , defendants are ineligible for pretrial intervention ( PTI ) and other diversion programs . A previous DUI conviction , in New Jersey or another state , cannot be used to disqualify a person from such programs , and those charged with an indictable offense stemming from drunk driving ( e.g. cases involving serious injuries or eluding arrest ) are eligible for PTI . A person convicted of DUI is barred from recovering accident @-@ related damages from other drivers , but may be able to sue the business or person who served them alcoholic beverages . 
 For a second DUI conviction in a 10 @-@ year period , irrespective of BAC , there is a fine of $ 500 – $ 1 @,@ 000 , 2 – 90 days imprisonment , a 2 @-@ year license suspension , an automobile insurance surcharge of $ 1 @,@ 000 a year for 3 years , and installation of an ignition interlock device for 1 to 3 years after license restoration . A person who has 3 or more DUI convictions and a gap of less than 10 years since the last conviction incurs a fine of $ 1 @,@ 000 , 6 months imprisonment , a 10 @-@ year license suspension , an automobile insurance surcharge of $ 1 @,@ 500 a year for 3 years , and installation of an ignition interlock device for 1 to 3 years after license restoration . Jail sentences issued in New Jersey for DUI are often served through work release programs ( e.g. weekends in jail ) .

 New Jersey first established drunk driving laws in 1909 , making it a disorderly persons offense ( misdemeanor ) . In 1921 , DUI was converted to a traffic violation with a 1 @-@ year license suspension for the first violation , and a 5 @-@ year suspension for repeat violations . Penalties were increased in 1926 to a 2 @-@ year suspension , and a lifetime suspension and a mandatory 3 months in jail for repeat offenses . In 1951 , out of concerns regarding the evidence needed to prove " intoxication " , the New Jersey Legislature amended the DUI statute to state that a driver with a BAC of 0 @.@ 15 % or greater was presumed to be intoxicated . A driver with a BAC of 0 @.@ 15 % or greater could be acquitted if they could show that they were not physically intoxicated . 
 Because of new ideas about the treatment of alcoholism , the lifetime suspension was downgraded to a 10 @-@ year suspension in 1952 . DUI prosecutions remained difficult in cases when drivers refused to take a <unk> test , and so in 1966 , the state authorized the suspension of a person 's driver 's license for refusing to submit a breath sample . In 1977 , the BAC limit was reduced to 0 @.@ 10 % , but the law was modified to differentiate between the second and third offenses , with lesser penalties for first and second convictions . In 1983 , the state established a per se rule wherein a person over the limit was considered drunk in all cases ( that is , not merely a presumption ) . Nine years later , the 0 @.@ 01 % BAC limit for drivers under 21 was instituted , and in 2003 , the 0 @.@ 10 % BAC limit was reduced to 0 @.@ 08 % to comply with federal highway funding requirements . 
 = = Other alcohol @-@ related legal issues = = 
 = = = Open container and public consumption laws = = = 
 It is illegal in New Jersey to have an open container of alcohol in the passenger portion of a private automobile , but open bottles of alcohol may be transported in the trunk of a car , and consumption of alcohol on a bus , train , taxi , limousine , or boat is permitted . The penalty for having an open container of alcohol in a car is $ 200 fine for the first offense , and a $ 250 fine or 10 days of community service for repeat violations . The state Motor Vehicle Commission does not impose license points for open container convictions , but some automobile insurance companies impose a surcharge . New Jersey 's law on open containers in motor vehicles is compliant with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century ( TEA @-@ 21 ) , a federal act passed in 1998 which reduces the highway funding of states that do not prohibit open containers in passenger areas of automobiles . 
 New Jersey 's state parks and forests prohibit the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages except at pre @-@ approved events . There is no state law against public consumption of alcohol in other locations , but most municipalities have open container laws prohibiting or restricting public consumption . The fine for alcohol possession in a state park is $ 71 , whereas municipal fines for public consumption violations can be as high as $ 2000 , although they are generally much lower . Per the Alcoholism Treatment and Rehabilitation Act ( ATRA ) , public intoxication without accompanying disorderly behavior is not a criminal offense , and municipalities are prohibited from making ordinances against public intoxication . New Jersey law allows a police officer to take people found to be intoxicated in public to their residence or to a medical facility . 
 = = = Purchasing and home production restrictions = = = 
 Unlike many other states , New Jersey imposes no restrictions on the types or quantities of alcoholic beverages that a person of legal age may purchase . Grain alcohol , caffeinated alcoholic beverages , and absinthe can be legally sold , and state law imposes no limitations on the alcohol content of beer or wine . New Jersey does not require kegs to be registered , and state ABC regulations prohibit municipal keg registration laws . A resident can import any amount of alcohol into the state for personal use , but a $ 50 permit is required if more than 3 gallons of beer , 1 gallon of wine , or a half @-@ gallon of spirits are being imported within a 24 @-@ hour period . Any person who is 21 years or older may produce up to 200 gallons of beer or wine per year . No permit is required , but any brewing or winemaking must take place at a private home or non @-@ commercial property , and any beer and wine produced cannot be sold . It is a criminal offense to possess an unregistered still , or distill any amount of hard liquor . 
 = = = Dram shop liability and social host liability = = = 
 Bars and restaurants are considered strictly liable for their patrons ' behavior , and liquor licenses can be suspended or revoked if a customer engages in illegal activity ( e.g. fighting , public urination ) after drinking . New Jersey law recognizes both dram shop liability and social host liability , wherein the server of alcohol to visibly intoxicated persons or minors is liable if that person then causes death or injury to a third party in an alcohol @-@ related automobile collision or other accident . In order to mitigate liability , the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control ( ABC ) grants licensed establishments the right to exclude any patron for any reason , but warns business against violating civil rights laws . 
 While the courts in New Jersey allow actions based on dram shop liability or social host liability , they will instruct a jury to consider the intoxicated person 's negligence under the doctrine of comparative negligence . Licensed establishments and social hosts may be liable for drunk driving accidents , assaults , falls , and other injuries and property damage caused by a customer , but are not liable for behavior which is unforeseeable ( e.g. falling out of a tree ) , nor are they liable if they only served food or non @-@ alcoholic beverages to a drunk patron . Dram shop and social host litigation may involve both compensatory and punitive damages . There is a 2 @-@ year statute of limitations for such lawsuits , but the time limit may be extended if the victim is a juvenile . 
 Social hosts are given more liability protection than licensed businesses in that a private person is generally only liable for the actions of guests over 21 if their blood alcohol content is above 0 @.@ 15 , and the lawsuit involves drunk driving injuries . As long as a guest is not underage , a social host has no liability for assaults , falls , and other non @-@ DUI injuries . Although most alcohol @-@ related lawsuits involve parties injured by drunk drivers , there have been cases in New Jersey where drunk drivers were able to successfully sue the establishment that served them . Recently , in Voss v. <unk> the New Jersey courts held that a drunk driver can sue a bar or restaurant under the " Dram Shop Act " and prevail under the theory that : 
 " [ a ] person who sustains personal injury or property damage as a result of the negligent service of alcoholic beverages by a licensed alcoholic beverage server may recover damages from a licensed alcoholic beverage server if the server was negligent ( i.e. served a visibly intoxicated person ) , the injury was proximately caused by the negligent service of alcoholic beverages , and the injury was a foreseeable consequence of the negligent service . " 
 In 1959 , the New Jersey Supreme Court permitted a lawsuit against several taverns that had served alcohol to an underage person , who then caused a fatal automobile accident . The court stated that its decision was based on the fact that this conduct was already illegal under ABC regulations , stating that , " We are convinced that recognition of the plaintiff 's claim will afford a fairer measure of justice to innocent third parties whose injuries are brought about by the unlawful and negligent sale of alcoholic beverages to minors and intoxicated persons . " New Jersey courts have expanded the dram shop doctrine to include social hosts who serve alcoholic beverages to guests , and automobile owners who allow drunk drivers to operate their cars . 
 Because of complaints from bar owners about their inability to obtain liability insurance , the state passed legislation in 1987 to limit liability to cases where the server could have realistically known that the patron was underage or intoxicated , and to limit lawsuits to types of injuries that are foreseeable . The act also instituted the legal standard of comparative negligence in these cases , wherein the monetary damages against a licensed establishment can be reduced if there are others who are also negligent ( e.g. the patron , other bars ) . Additional legislation passed in 1987 substantially limited the liability of social hosts for adult guests . 
 = = = Intoxication defense , diversion , and treatment = = = 
 New Jersey 's criminal code prohibits voluntary intoxication from being used directly as a defense to a crime , though if a crime requires that the conduct was committed intentionally , intoxication may prevent the person from having the necessary mens rea to be guilty . For example , a person accused of killing a person during a fight while drunk may not be guilty of murder because New Jersey law requires that the actor purposely or knowingly " causes death or serious bodily injury resulting in death . " In such a case , an accused killer could be found guilty of manslaughter , which only requires reckless conduct , including acts committed while intoxicated . 
 Involuntary and pathological intoxication are affirmative defenses to all criminal offenses in New Jersey , but are not defenses to regulatory law and traffic law offenses that are considered strict liability violations ( e.g. environmental regulations , DUI ) . Involuntary intoxication relates to cases where someone did not know that they had consumed alcohol ( e.g. a spiked drink ) . Pathological intoxication is applicable where , for medical reasons , a person had an exaggerated response to alcohol . To be used as a defense , the person being charged must show that " at the time of his conduct did not know the nature and quality of the act he was doing , or if he did know it , that he did not know what he was doing was wrong . " Contracts made with an intoxicated person may be voided by courts if " the defendant was so intoxicated " that he or she " could not realize and appreciate the nature and consequences of what defendant was doing . " 
 In 1976 , the New Jersey legislature passed the Alcoholism Treatment and Rehabilitation Act ( ATRA ) , which declared that the public policy of New Jersey was that " alcoholics and intoxicated persons may not be subjected to criminal prosecution because of their consumption of alcoholic beverages , but rather should be afforded a continuum of treatment in order that they may lead normal lives as productive members of society . " Since the implementation of ATRA , it has been the general policy of New Jersey to treat alcoholism as a disease . Under ATRA , an intoxicated person arrested for a non @-@ indictable criminal offense may be taken to a medical facility , instead of jail , and will be released as soon as they are sober , or at most 48 hours . 
 Likewise a person charged with a non @-@ indictable criminal offense , including those being adjudicated in juvenile court , may request alcohol treatment in lieu of criminal prosecution . If a physician attests that the defendant is an alcoholic , the court may impose inpatient treatment for up to 30 days , outpatient treatment for up to 60 days , or both . If the person successfully completes the treatment program , the criminal charges will be dismissed . A person with alcohol dependency who has been charged with an indictable crime may apply for " special probation " ( also known as drug court ) . Those charged with severe violent crimes ( e.g. murder , kidnapping ) are not eligible , but people charged with offenses with mandatory sentences , or who have extensive non @-@ violent criminal records may be eligible . If admitted to special probation , the defendant will be subject to 18 months to 5 years of intense probation and residential treatment as an alternative to prison . 
 An employer who terminates an employee for being an alcoholic is in violation of the state 's anti @-@ discrimination laws unless they can show that person 's condition affected their job performance or created a substantial safety risk . No general hospitals may refuse a patient treatment for intoxication or alcoholism , and all individual and group health insurance plans which are regulated by the state of New Jersey are required to offer both inpatient and outpatient treatment for alcoholism . Under federal law , all group health insurances plans for private companies with more than 50 employees must offer insurance coverage for alcoholism that is equal to their insurance coverage for other medical conditions .

 = = = Casinos = = = 
 In a 1976 referendum , New Jersey voters approved casino gambling in Atlantic City . Because of concerns about organized crime connections to gambling , New Jersey enacted strict regulations that included licensing of all casino employees and contractors , and a separation of powers between the Division of Gaming Enforcement ( DGE ) and the Casino Control Commission ( CCC ) . The Division of Gaming Enforcement is part of the New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety , and is responsible for investigating casino license applications , monitoring casino operations , and enforcing New Jersey 's casino laws and regulations as defined in Title 5 , Chapter 12 of New Jersey 's statutes , and Title 13 , Chapter <unk> of New Jersey 's Administrative Code . The Casino Control Commission is an independent agency in the state Treasury Department with both quasi @-@ legislative and quasi @-@ judicial powers , and is responsible for creating casino regulations , hearing appeals of DGE penalties , and make decisions on casino licensing . In light of such regulation and the uniqueness of casino gambling , New Jersey 's twelve casinos are not under the jurisdiction of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control ( ABC ) or Atlantic City 's alcoholic beverage control board . 
 Casinos , and vendors serving , selling or storing alcoholic beverages for a casino , are required to obtain a casino hotel alcoholic beverage ( <unk> ) license from the Division of Gaming Enforcement . <unk> licenses must be renewed every five years . New Jersey 's casino alcohol regulations are divided into five different regions of activity : ( a ) the casino floor ( includes simulcasting facilities ) ; ( b ) the hotel ( includes restaurants and meeting rooms ) ; ( c ) package goods ; ( d ) room service ; and ( e ) storage . Alcohol sold or given away on the casino floor and in hotel areas must be in an open container for immediate consumption , whereas alcohol sold in a package goods area must be sealed . Alcoholic beverages brought to a patron as a room service may be open or closed , whereas storage areas must not be accessible to the public . 
 Although casinos are not under the jurisdiction of the ABC , many of the regulations for casinos and casino vendors are similar to those for ABC class C retailer licensees . Casinos may generally only purchase alcoholic beverages from licensed wholesalers ( i.e. ABC Class B licensees ) . A casino may have a brewpub on site , but production is limited to 3 @,@ 000 barrels of beer per year , and the beer may only be distributed in open containers on casino floor and in hotel areas of the casino . Casinos may obtain a permit to have tastings , and tasting dinners . Non @-@ profit organizations may obtain a permit to have a social event at a casino where they charge for alcoholic beverages . Organizations are limited to 12 casino social event permits per year , and a given casino may only host 25 such events per year . 
 Casinos are not allowed to serve alcohol to people who are under 21 or intoxicated , are strictly liable for patron 's behavior , and are subject to dram shop lawsuits for injuries stemming from negligence in serving alcohol . Casinos are permitted to give away " comp " drinks , and many do to reward and encourage gambling . Except on New Year 's Eve , a casino cannot sell an unlimited amount of alcoholic beverages at a set price , nor may they require patrons to purchase alcoholic beverages in order to access an event or service . In 1983 , because of difficulties in preventing underage drinking in casinos , the legal age to gamble at a casino was raised to 21 . In <unk> v. Trump Taj Mahal Associates , a federal appeals court decided that casinos are not legally responsible for gambling losses and debts incurred by intoxicated gamblers , but it is not clear if the decision applies if the intoxicated gambler is also underage . 
 Because they serve alcoholic beverages , casino nightclubs are prohibited from offering full nudity . In 2013 , Trump Taj Mahal opened the nation 's first casino strip club , featuring scantily clad dancers . New Jersey 's casinos initially had closing times like most ABC @-@ licensed establishments , but were allowed to stay open 24 hours per day , 7 days a week starting in 1992 It is legal for a minor to go to a casino , insofar as they do not gamble , consume alcoholic beverages in public areas of the casino , or remain on the gambling floor . Because Atlantic City has ordinances prohibiting underage drinking on private property , it is illegal for a person underage 21 to drink in a casino hotel room unless a family member is present . 
 = = = Federal lands = = = 
 The applicability of state and municipal alcohol laws on federal lands is a complex and partially unresolved legal issue that depends on whether the federal property is considered a federal enclave , what rights the state reserved when it granted the property to the federal government , and whether the law is criminal or civil . If the federal property is not an enclave , the federal government either has concurrent jurisdiction ( shared authority with the state ) or proprietary jurisdiction ( only the rights of a landowner ) , and the state can enforce alcohol laws . 
 If the federal property is an enclave , then the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction , unless the state reserved rights when it ceded the land to the federal government . The Assimilative Crimes Act makes it a federal crime to violate a state law while at a federal enclave in that state . The Assimilative Crimes Act only applies to criminal laws ( not regulatory laws ) , and is not applicable if the conduct is already regulated by federal law . Under federal law , military facilities are required to adopt state traffic laws , but the base commander is permitted to institute additional traffic laws . 
 In New Jersey , older Department of Defense and Department of Interior properties such as Fort Dix and parts of Sandy Hook are federal enclaves , but most other federal properties are not enclaves . Because New Jersey generally did not reserve any right to regulate federal enclaves , state liquor licensing rules and alcohol taxes cannot be enforced . There is no universal policy regarding the sale of alcoholic beverages on federal lands , but almost all military bases , and some national parks allow for alcohol concessions , both for on @-@ premises or off @-@ premises consumption . 
 Unlike the state , federal agencies which allow alcohol sales do not have a system of liquor licenses or alcoholic beverage control boards , but instead simply award contracts to business per federal procurement laws . New Jersey does not consider municipal ordinances to be criminal offenses , and so open container laws cannot be enforced in federal enclaves under the Assimilative Crimes Act . Public consumption of alcohol is allowed on federal lands , except when in an automobile , or when the park superintendent has prohibited open containers in an area . For example , it is legal to consume alcoholic beverages on the beach at Sandy Hook . 
 Because DUI in New Jersey is a non @-@ criminal traffic violation , state DUI laws are not subject to the Assimilative Crimes Act . Members of the Armed Forces can be court martialed for drunk driving , military bases can enforce New Jersey traffic law on civilians , and it is a misdemeanor under federal law to drive while intoxicated on land administered by the National Park Service , the Department of Veterans Affairs , or the Postal Service . Similar to New Jersey , federal DUI statutes prohibit the operation of a motor vehicle while having a BAC of 0 @.@ 08 % or greater , and require a driver to give a breath sample if requested by a law enforcement authority . 
 Federal DUI law differs from New Jersey law in that there are no mandatory minimum jail sentences , irrespective of the number of previous DUI convictions , and plea bargaining is allowed . A federal DUI conviction will result in <unk> criminal record . Federal courts cannot suspend a driver 's license , but may notify the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission of a DUI conviction . In federal enclaves that are under the jurisdiction of other federal departments ( e.g. Fish and Wildlife Service ) , it is unclear if drunk driving could be prosecuted since the Assimilative Crimes Act is inapplicable , and there is no federal law defining DUI on those properties . 
 Under federal law , the drinking age for the Armed Forces is the same as the state or nation where the military base is located , or the drinking age of a state or nation within 50 miles of the base . Effectively , that restricts the purchase of alcohol at New Jersey military bases to those over 21 . Irrespective of state laws on underage consumption , the Army , Navy , Air Force , and Coast Guard prohibit the consumption of alcohol by underage personnel when stationed in the United States . Marines under 21 are permitted to drink alcohol at U.S. bases on special occasions . 
 Federal law states that national parks will have the same underage laws as the state that they are located in , and the Assimilative Crimes Act is applicable to New Jersey 's underage drinking statute . Thus , in a private location , such as a cabin in a federal enclave in New Jersey , a parent can serve alcohol to their child , and an underage person can possess and consume alcohol . Outside of these exceptions , underage drinking and serving alcohol to a minor are federal misdemeanors , punishable by a fine and up to 6 months in jail . There is a 5 @-@ year statute of limitations for DUI , underage drinking , and other alcohol violations that take place in federal enclaves .

 Sinsen is a rapid transit station on the Ring Line of the Oslo Metro . It is located at Sinsen in the Sagene borough of Oslo , Norway . Next to the station is the tram station <unk> , that has been part of the Sinsen Line of the Oslo Tramway since 1939 . The station opened on 20 August 2006 , as part of the first section of the Ring Line . The station is served by line 6 of the metro , as well as several local bus services . Sinsen is a mixed residential and commercial area . 
 = = History = = 
 Storo opened as a tram station as part of the extension of the Sinsen Line to Grefsen in 1939 . The tram station was built adjacent to the Sinsen Interchange , between Ring 3 and National Road 4 . In 1992 , the Sinsen Line was moved redirected to go outside the interchange . 
 The process of establishing a Ring Line to serve the northern parts of Oslo started in the late 1980s . The plans were passed by the city council in 1997 , and financing was secured in 2000 through Oslo Package 2 . Construction started in June 2000 , and the first section to Nydalen and Storo opened on 20 August 2003 . The ring was completed and Sinsen opened on 20 August 2006 . The station is owned by Sporveien . 
 = = Facilities = = 
 The rapid transit station was designed by architects Jensen & <unk> Architects , and is visually and structurally very similar to Storo . It features a center platform , a roof , and incorporates wood , steel and concrete as construction materials . To the south , the station is located just outside the tunnel that connects the Ring Line to the Grorud Line . To the north , the line runs parallel to the mainline Gjøvik Line . Sinsen is located just beside the Sinsen Interchange , in a mixed residential and commercial area . 
 = = Service = = 
 Line 6 of the Oslo Metro operate to Sinsen , with a 15 @-@ minute headway . The line operate clockwise through the eastern part of town into the Common Tunnel towards Sognsvann , while it operates counterclockwise via the western part into the Common Tunnel towards Bergkrystallen . Line 3 , which operates to the other stations on the Ring Line , does not continue to Sinsen . Travel time from Sinsen to Stortinget is 9 minutes clockwise and 16 minutes counterclockwise . The service is operated by Oslo T @-@ banedrift on contract with Ruter . 
 The tram station is served by line 17 of the Oslo Tramway . It operates on a ten @-@ minute headway to the city center . Travel time to Jernbanetorget is 13 minutes . Northwards , the line continues to the final station , Grefsen . While the tram and rapid transit stations are within walking distance of each other , they are not marked as transfer stations on the schedules . The trams are operated by Oslo Sporvognsdrift on contract with Ruter . 
 The station serves several bus routes . Lines 23 and 24 along Ring 3 from Lysaker to Simensbråten , and Brynseng to Fornebu stop at Sinsen . Line 31 runs via Sinsen from Grorud to Snarøya , as does line 33 from Ellingsrudåsen to Filipstad , and line 58 from Helsfyr to Nydalen . 
 = Tropical Depression Ten ( 2007 ) = 
 Tropical Depression Ten was a short @-@ lived tropical cyclone that made landfall on the Florida Panhandle in September 2007 . The system developed as a subtropical depression on September 21 in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico from the interaction of a tropical wave , the tail end of a cold front , and an upper @-@ level low . Initially containing a poorly defined circulation and intermittent thunderstorm activity , the system transitioned into a tropical depression after convection increased over the center . Tracking northwestward , the depression moved ashore near Fort Walton Beach early on September 22 and dissipated over southeastern Alabama shortly thereafter . 
 Initially the depression was forecast to move ashore as a minimal tropical storm , and the threat of the depression prompted state of emergency declarations in Mississippi and Louisiana . It was the first tropical cyclone to threaten the New Orleans area since Hurricane Katrina and the destructive 2005 hurricane season . Overall impact from the cyclone was minor and largely limited to light rainfall . However , the precursor system spawned a damaging tornado in Eustis , Florida , where 20 houses were destroyed and 30 more were damaged . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Tropical Depression Ten formed from the complex interaction between an upper @-@ level low , a tropical wave that produced Tropical Storm Ingrid , and the tail end of a cold front . By September 17 , the system produced widespread thunderstorm activity over The Bahamas and western Atlantic Ocean . The upper @-@ level low over the Florida Panhandle increased convection across the area , and on September 18 the system began crossing Florida . Initially very disorganized , surface pressures gradually decreased across the region , with a weak low @-@ pressure area developing on September 19 . 
 A reconnaissance aircraft flight into the system on September 20 reported a well @-@ defined low and strong wind gusts in squalls as the system tracked into the northeastern Gulf of Mexico , along with limited and disorganized thunderstorm activity . Convection gradually became better organized , with a well @-@ defined band in its eastern semicircle and intermittent thunderstorm activity near the center . Despite an overall disorganized structure , with a poorly defined circulation and an upper @-@ level low aloft , the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories on Subtropical Depression Ten at 1500 UTC on September 21 while it was located about 40 miles ( 60 km ) south of St. Vincent Island , Florida , citing " the potential for additional development right along the coastline . " In post @-@ analysis , it was classified a subtropical cyclone three hours earlier . 
 With a mid @-@ level ridge to its northwest , the subtropical depression was anticipated to parallel the coastline of the Gulf Coast of the United States . As a result , it was forecast to attain winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) and move ashore along southern Mississippi . The circulation became better defined as convection modestly increased over the center , and within six hours of its development the system transitioned into a tropical depression . The cyclone continued tracking northwestward , making landfall around 0000 UTC on September 22 near Fort Walton Beach , Florida , with winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) . The cloud pattern deteriorated as it tracked inland , and 3 hours after it moved ashore the National Hurricane Center issued its last advisory on the depression . As the depression tracked into Alabama , it became increasingly disorganized , and the system dissipated as a tropical cyclone early on September 22 . Its remnant surface low continued west @-@ northwest before dissipating near the Louisiana / Texas border early on September 23 . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 The combination of wind shear and low @-@ level helicity produced moderate convection across central Florida in association with the precursor low pressure system . Late on September 20 , a supercell developed near Lake Apopka , and tracking quickly northward it spawned an EF1 tornado near Eustis ; the tornado tracked for 1 @.@ 83 mi ( 2 @.@ 94 km ) and reached winds of about 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . The tornado destroyed 20 homes , left 30 others severely damaged , injured one person , and caused power outages for about 300 people . Damage totaled $ 6 @.@ 2 million ( 2007 USD ) . Tornadoes were also reported near Marianna and Chipley . The precursor low pressure system also generated lightning that stuck and killed a man in Hendry County , Florida . 
 Outer rainbands began affecting coastal sections of the Florida Panhandle by about 12 hours prior to the formation of the depression . Coinciding with the first advisory on the depression , the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning from Apalachicola , Florida , westward to the mouth of the Mississippi River . Shortly thereafter , an inland tropical storm warning was issued for Pearl River , Walthall , and Pike counties in Mississippi and Washington Parish in Louisiana . Additionally , the New Orleans National Weather Service issued a coastal flood watch for four parishes in southeastern Louisiana . In Mississippi , Governor Haley Barbour declared a state of emergency . Officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for residents in shallow areas and in mobile homes for Jackson , Harrison , and Hancock counties . Officials in New Orleans opened three emergency shelters , citing the potential need of shelter for citizens in about 17 @,@ 000 FEMA trailers after Hurricane Katrina . Due to the threat of the cyclone , Louisiana governor Kathleen Blanco declared a state of emergency and placed the state 's National Guard and other disaster services on reserve . 
 Waves of about 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) and rip currents were reported along the west coast of Florida . However , no beach erosion was reported . Rainfall associated with the system peaked at 7 @.@ 29 inches ( 185 mm ) at Hastings . Elsewhere , rainfall totals reached 1 @.@ 46 inches ( 37 @.@ 1 mm ) in Albany , Georgia , and 0 @.@ 51 inches ( 13 mm ) in Dothan , Alabama . Wind gusts from the storm peaked at 46 mph ( 74 km / h ) in Milton , Florida , which blew down a few trees in Escambia County . Overall damage from the depression was minimal . Storm surge ranged from 2 @.@ 5 to 4 @.@ 1 feet ( 0 @.@ 76 to 1 @.@ 25 m ) along the Panhandle . 
 Prior to the storm 's development , several oil and gas companies removed unneeded workers from offshore oil platforms in the northern Gulf of Mexico ; Shell Oil Company evacuated about 700 employees , while Noble Energy removed its workforce of about 300 people from two oil rigs . ExxonMobil cut its output by about 1 @,@ 000 barrels of oil and 55 @,@ 000 cubic feet ( 1 @,@ 600 m3 ) . With 27 @.@ 7 % of the daily crude oil production halted due to the depression , oil prices rose further after days of increasing levels , and on September 20 reached a record rate of over $ 84 per barrel .

 = Wolverton to Newport Pagnell Line = 
 The Wolverton to Newport Pagnell Line was a railway branch line in Buckinghamshire , United Kingdom running from Wolverton on the London and North Western Railway ( LNWR ) ( today 's West Coast Main Line ) to Newport Pagnell . The line fully opened to passengers in 1867 , with an extension to Olney planned in 1865 , but this scheme was abandoned after partial construction . Earthworks along the route of the extension still exist in Bury field , and plaques exist detailing the history of the failed project . 
 Competition from road traffic starting in the early twentieth century put pressure on the railway , and it was later a victim of the Beeching axe in 1962 . The line was seen as unprofitable , and it closed to passengers in 1964 , and to goods traffic in 1967 . Part of the trackbed today provides a section of the Milton Keynes <unk> system . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Newport Pagnell Canal had opened in 1817 between the Grand Junction Canal at Great Linford and Newport Pagnell . The canal carried a reasonable level of traffic , but in 1845 , the LNWR attempted to buy the canal , using it for a potential railway line . The offer was refused for two decades , until 1862 , when the LNWR was able to purchase the canal for £ 9000 . The canal closed in 1864 . Despite this , the railway when built did not run on the line of the old canal . 
 Two earlier proposals had been made in 1845 and 1846 for a railway serving Newport Pagnell , both schemes failing to attract sufficient capital . 
 = = Construction and operation = = 
 Permission to build the 4 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) long single line branch railway was obtained on 16 June 1863 . The line opened for goods in 1866 , with passenger services commencing on 2 September 1867 . The line was officially absorbed by the LNWR in 1875 . The one engine that worked the single track branch was later nicknamed Newport Nobby . 
 In 1865 , powers were granted to extend the line from Newport Pagnell to Olney and then on to meet the Northampton and Peterborough Railway at Wellingborough . Construction was underway , and a bridge had been completed when the extension was abandoned in 1871 . Olney was later served by a station on the Midland Railway 's Bedford to Northampton Line from 1872 , that line closing in 1962 . 
 In 1900 a spur connecting the branch to the up slow line of the West Coast Main Line was constructed . The water supply for locomotives at Wolverton was insufficient , so a water column was built at the intermediate station in Bradwell . Water came from the town 's own source , with many houses losing their supply . On Mondays , housewives were known to shake their fists at engine drivers when their weekly wash was interrupted . Eventually drivers were forbidden from taking water from Bradwell on Mondays . 
 In 1898 , the first motor bus service in Buckinghamshire began running between Newport Pagnell and Olney , followed by numerous other routes , which took traffic away from the railway line . Despite this , the LNWR considered electrification of the line in 1904 , believing such a scheme would bring about considerable savings , but the idea never materialised . 
 = = Closure = = 
 The branch was included in the Beeching report of 1963 which concluded that , since 30 % of the railway network carried less than 1 % of the total passenger traffic , much of it should be closed . The residents of Newport Pagnell resisted the closure , demanding an enquiry which took place on 7 June 1964 . Despite many objections , it was determined that the line would close . The last passenger service was the 5 : 34 pm train from Newport Pagnell on 5 September 1964 , just under a century after the line opened to passengers . The mourning of the line was so great that a bucket of water was poured over a double dressed as Richard Beeching , the man commonly associated with the closure of over 4 @,@ 000 miles of the British railway network . The crowd cheered as this happened , a mark of the public 's feelings about the closure . 
 The line was finally closed to freight traffic in 1967 , after which the tracks were lifted . Part of the trackbed is now used by the Milton Keynes <unk> system , the network of cycle and pedestrian routes that serves the Milton Keynes urban area .

 Lawrence Eugene Doby ( December 13 , 1923 – June 18 , 2003 ) was an American professional baseball player in the Negro leagues and Major League Baseball ( MLB ) who was the second black player to break baseball 's color barrier . A native of Camden , South Carolina and three @-@ sport all @-@ state athlete while in high school in Paterson , New Jersey , Doby accepted a basketball scholarship from Long Island University . At 17 years of age , he began professionally playing baseball with the Newark Eagles as the team 's second baseman . Doby joined the United States Navy during World War II . His military service complete , Doby returned to baseball in 1946 , and along with teammate Monte Irvin , helped the Eagles win the Negro League World Series . 
 In July 1947 , Doby joined Jackie Robinson in breaking the MLB color barrier . He became the first black player in the American League ( AL ) when he signed a contract to play with Bill Veeck 's Cleveland Indians . Doby was the first player to go directly to the majors from the Negro leagues . A seven @-@ time All @-@ Star center fielder , Doby and teammate Satchel Paige were the first African @-@ American players to win a World Series championship when the Indians won in 1948 . He helped the Indians win a franchise @-@ record 111 games and the AL pennant in 1954 , finished second in the AL Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) award voting and was the AL 's RBI leader and home run champion . He went on to play for the Chicago White Sox , Detroit Tigers , and Chunichi Dragons before his retirement as a player in 1962 . 
 Doby later served as the second black manager in the majors with the Chicago White Sox , and in 1995 was appointed to a position in the AL 's executive office . He also served as a director with the New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . He was selected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1998 by the Hall 's Veterans Committee and died in 2003 at the age of 79 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Doby was born in Camden , South Carolina , to David Doby and Etta Brooks . Doby 's father served in World War I. He worked as a horse groomer and played semi @-@ pro baseball , but drowned in an accident at age 37 in New York state . Doby 's mother , who had divorced David before his death , moved to Paterson , New Jersey ; Doby remained in Camden . He lived with his grandmother before moving to live with his father 's sister and brother @-@ in @-@ law from 1934 to 1938 . He attended Jackson School , which was segregated under South Carolina state law . His first opportunity to play organized baseball came as a student at Browning Home @-@ Mather Academy , a private school affiliated with the Methodist church . Richard Dubose , who had managed Doby 's father and was known locally in African @-@ American circles for his baseball expertise , gave Doby some of his first baseball lessons . Reflecting on his years growing up in South Carolina , including how he and playmates used worn down broom handles for bats , Doby said , " Growing up in Camden , we didn 't have baseball bats . We 'd use a tree here , a tin can there , for bases . " 
 After completing eighth grade , Doby moved north to Paterson at the age of 14 to be reunited with his mother ; she visited him weekly while he lived with one of her friends . At Paterson Eastside High School , Doby was a multi @-@ sport athlete ; as well as playing baseball and basketball , he was a wide receiver in football and lettered in track . After winning a state football championship , the Eastside team was invited to play in Florida , but the promoters would not allow Doby , the only black player on the team , to participate . Consequently , the team voted to forgo the trip as a gesture of support for Doby . 
 During summer vacation Doby played baseball with a black semi @-@ pro team , the Smart Sets , where he played with future Hall of Fame shortstop Monte Irvin . He also had a brief stint with the Harlem Renaissance , a professional basketball team , as an unpaid substitute player . Upon completing high school , he accepted an athletic scholarship to play basketball at Long Island University ( LIU ) . Doby had been dating Eastside classmate Helyn <unk> since his sophomore year and , according to Doby , being able to remain close to Paterson was the " main reason " he selected LIU . 
 In the summer before he enrolled at LIU , Doby accepted an offer to play for the Newark Eagles of the Negro National League ( NNL ) for the remainder of the 1942 season , and he transferred to Virginia Union University as a result . 
 = = Negro leagues and World War II = = 
 A Negro league umpire , Henry Moore , advised Newark Eagles ' owners Abe and <unk> Manley to give Doby a tryout at Hinchliffe Stadium in Paterson , which was successful ; Doby joined the Eagles in 1942 at the age of 17 for $ 300 . The contract stated Doby would play until September when he would start classes at college ; to protect his amateur status he signed using the alias " Larry Walker " and local reporters were told he originated from Los Angeles , California . On May 31 , Doby appeared in his first professional game when the Eagles played against the New York Cubans at Yankee Stadium . In the 26 games where box scores have been found , Doby 's batting average was .391 . Doby recalled a game against catcher Josh Gibson and pitcher Ray Brown of the Homestead Grays : 
 " My first time up , Josh said , ' We 're going to find out if you can hit a fastball . ' I singled . Next time up , Josh said , ' We 're going to find out if you can hit a curveball . ' I singled . Third time up , Josh said , ' We 're going to find out how you do after you 're knocked down . ' I popped up the first time after they knocked me down . The second time , I singled . " 
 Doby 's career in Newark was interrupted for two years for service in the United States Navy . Doby spent 1943 and part of 1944 at Camp Robert Smalls at the Great Lakes Naval Training School near Chicago . He appeared on an all @-@ black baseball squad and maintained a .342 batting average against teams composed of white players , some of which featured major leaguers . He then went to Treasure Island Naval Base in San Francisco Bay , California . Before serving in the Pacific Theater of World War II , Doby spent time at Navy sites in Ogden , Utah and San Diego , California . He was stationed on Ulithi in the Pacific Ocean in 1945 . Doby heard of Jackie Robinson 's minor league contract deal with the Montreal Royals of the International League from his base on Ulithi listening to Armed Forces Radio , and as a result Doby saw real hope in becoming a professional baseball player . While in Hawaii , Doby met fellow Navy man and future teammate Mickey Vernon . Vernon , then with the Washington Senators , was so impressed with Doby 's skills he wrote to Senators owner Clark Griffith , encouraging Griffith to sign Doby should the MLB ever allow integration . During his time in the Navy , Doby was described by his colleagues as quiet . Doby was discharged from the Navy in January 1946 . In the summer of that year , Doby and Helyn <unk> were married . 
 After playing for the San Juan Senators in Puerto Rico , Doby rejoined the Eagles in 1946 . He made the All @-@ Star roster , batted .360 ( fourth in the NNL ) , hit five home runs ( fifth ) and led the NNL in triples ( six ) . Manager Biz Mackey led the Eagles , including Doby , Monte Irvin and Johnny Davis , to the Negro World Series championship over Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Monarchs in seven games to conclude the 1946 season . For the Series , Doby hit .372 with one home run , five RBIs , and three stolen bases . Many in the Negro leagues believed Doby or Irvin would be first to break the MLB color barrier , not Robinson . On considering a career in the MLB , Doby said , " I never dreamed that far ahead . Growing up in a segregated society , you couldn 't have thought that that was the way it was going to be . There was no bright spot as far as looking at baseball until Mr. Robinson got the opportunity to play in Montreal in ' 46 . "

 = = = Integration of American League ( 1947 ) = = = 
 Cleveland Indians owner and team president Bill Veeck proposed integrating baseball in 1942 , which had been informally segregated since the turn of the century , but this was rejected by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis . Veeck had begun the process of finding a young , talented player from the Negro leagues , and told a reporter in Cleveland that he would integrate the Indians ' roster if he could find a black player with the necessary talent level who could withstand the taunts and pressure of being the first black athlete in the AL . The reporter suggested Doby , of whom Veeck had seen at the Great Lakes Naval Training School . Doby 's name was also mentioned when Veeck talked with reporters who covered the Negro leagues . Indians scout Bill Killefer rated Doby favorably and perhaps just as important for Veeck , reported Doby 's off @-@ field behavior was not a concern . The Dodgers rated Doby their top young Negro league prospect . But unlike the Brooklyn Dodgers ' Branch Rickey , who signed Robinson one full season before bringing him to the National League , Veeck used a different strategy , letting Doby remain with the Eagles instead of bringing him through the Indians ' farm system . He told the Pittsburgh Courier , " One afternoon when the team trots out on the field , a Negro player will be out there with it . " 
 While Rickey declined to pay for the purchasing rights of Robinson while he played for the Kansas City Monarchs , Veeck was " determined to buy Doby 's contract from the Eagles " and had no problem paying purchasing rights . <unk> Manley , business manager for the Eagles , believed her club 's close relationship with the New York Yankees might put Doby in a Yankees uniform , but they did not take interest in him . Veeck finalized a contract deal for Doby with Manley on July 3 . Veeck paid her a total of $ 15 @,@ 000 for her second baseman — $ 10 @,@ 000 for taking him from the Eagles and another $ 5 @,@ 000 once it was determined he would stay with the Indians for at least 30 days . After Manley agreed to Veeck 's offer , she stated to him , " If Larry Doby were white and a free agent , you 'd give him $ 100 @,@ 000 to sign as a bonus . " The press were not told that Doby had been signed by the Indians as Veeck wanted to manage how fans in Cleveland would be introduced to Doby . " I moved slowly and carefully , perhaps even timidly " , Veeck said . The Eagles had a doubleheader on July 4 but Doby , who had a .415 batting average and 14 home runs to that point in the season , only played in the first as Veeck sent his assistant and public relations personnel member , Louis Jones , for Doby . The two took a train from Newark to Chicago where the Indians were scheduled to play the Chicago White Sox the next day . 
 On July 5 , with the Indians in Chicago in the midst of a road trip , Doby made his debut as the second black baseball player after Robinson to play in the majors after establishment of the baseball color line . Veeck hired two plainclothes police officers to accompany Doby as he went to Comiskey Park . Player @-@ manager Lou Boudreau initially had a hard time finding a place in the lineup for Doby , who had played second base and shortstop for most of his career . Boudreau himself was the regular shortstop , while Joe Gordon was the second baseman . That day , Doby met his new teammates for the first time . " I walked down that line , stuck out my hand , and very few hands came back in return . Most of the ones that did were cold @-@ fish handshakes , along with a look that said , ' You don 't belong here " , Doby reminisced years later . Four of Doby 's teammates did not shake his hand , and of those , two turned their backs to Doby when he tried to introduce himself . During warm @-@ ups , Doby languished for minutes while his teammates interacted with one another . Not until Joe Gordon asked Doby to play catch with him was Doby given the chance to engage . Gordon befriended Doby and became one of his closest friends on the team . 
 Doby entered the game in the seventh inning as a pinch @-@ hitter for relief pitcher Bryan Stephens and recorded a strikeout . In the 1949 movie The Kid from Cleveland , Veeck tells the story that Gordon struck out on three swings in his immediate at @-@ bat after Doby to save face for his new teammate . However , Doby 's second strike was the result of a foul ball , both the Associated Press and Chicago Tribune stated Doby struck out on five pitches instead of three , and in addition , Gordon was standing on third base during Doby 's at @-@ bat . From Pride and Prejudice : The Biography of Larry Doby : 
 " After the game , Doby quickly showered and dressed without incident in the Cleveland clubhouse . His escort , Louis Jones , then took him not to the Del Prado Hotel downtown , where the Indians players stayed , but to the black DuSable Hotel in Chicago 's predominantly black South Side , near Comiskey Park . The segregated arrangement established a pattern , on Doby 's first day , that he would be compelled to follow , in spring training and during the regular season , in many cities , throughout his playing career . " 
 The Indians had a doubleheader against the White Sox on Sunday , July 6 , for which 31 @,@ 566 were in attendance ; it was estimated that approximately 30 percent of the crowd were black . Some congregations of black churches let out early while others walked immediately from Sunday service to Comiskey Park . Boudreau had Doby pinch @-@ hit in the first game but for the second , listed him a starter at first base , a position Doby was not expected to fill when the Indians brought him up to play at second base . Doby had played the position before with the Eagles but was without a proper mitt for first base and met much resistance when attempts were made to borrow one from teammates , including first baseman Eddie Robinson , for whom Boudreau had asked Doby to replace that day . Doby said only because Gordon asked in the clubhouse to borrow one of the first baseman 's mitts did he have one to use in the second game of the doubleheader as earlier direct requests from Doby were rejected . The mitt was loaned by a White Sox player . Boudreau recounts an incident where Robinson refused the mitt to Doby , but when asked by Indians traveling secretary Spud Goldstein , Robinson obliged . It was the only game Doby started for the remainder of the season . Doby recorded his first major league hit in four at @-@ bats and had an RBI in a 5 – 1 Indians win . 
 A columnist wrote in the Plain Dealer on July 8 : " Cleveland 's man in the street is the right sort of American , as was evidenced right solidly once more by the response to the question : ' How does the signing of Larry Doby by the Indians strike you ? Said the man in the street : Can he hit ? ... That 's all that counts . " Conversely , Doby was criticized from players both active and retired . Noted former player Rogers Hornsby said , after watching Doby play one time in 1947 : 
 " Bill Veeck did the Negro race no favor when he signed Larry Doby to a Cleveland contract . If Veeck wanted to demonstrate that the Negro has no place in major league baseball , he could have used no subtler means to establish the point . If he were white he wouldn 't be considered good enough to play with a semi @-@ pro club . He is fast on his feet but that lets him out . He hasn 't any other quality that could possibly recommend him . " 
 In his rookie year , Doby hit 5 @-@ for @-@ 32 in 29 games . He played four games at second base and one each at first base and shortstop . Throughout the season he talked with Robinson via telephone , the two encouraging each other . " And Jackie and I agreed we shouldn 't challenge anybody or cause trouble — or we 'd both be out of the big leagues , just like that . We figured that if we spoke out , we would ruin things for other black players . " After his rookie season , Doby again pursued time on the basketball court and appeared with the Paterson Crescents of the American Basketball League after signing a contract in January 1948 . He was the first black player to join the league .

 In 1948 , Doby experienced his first spring training with the Indians in Tucson , Arizona . Unlike their white teammates , Doby , along with Satchel Paige and Minnie Miñoso , were not permitted to stay at the nearby Santa Rita hotel but instead stayed with a local black family and used a rental car provided by the Indians for transportation . During spring training , Doby read books concerning outfield play , and received instruction and encouragement from former Indians manager Tris Speaker and Indians ' farm system director Hank Greenberg . Doby also credited Indians coach Bill McKechnie with helping him adjust to the majors and learning the outfield . In an exhibition game in Houston against the New York Giants , Doby hit a home run that " may have traveled 500 feet before landing far beyond the fence in center field . " As Moore wrote in his biography of Doby , " With that home run , all doubts that Doby would make the 1948 Cleveland team vanished . That year , he played in 121 games and hit .301 for the season with 14 home runs and 66 RBIs . Throughout the regular season Doby was racially abused by opposing teams , and Veeck asked AL president Will Harridge for support in getting players to rein in their animosity towards Doby . 
 Doby played a major role in Cleveland 's World Series victory against the Boston Braves . In Game 4 on October 9 , Doby hit the first home run by a black player in World Series history . A picture featuring an embrace between Doby and white teammate Steve Gromek , who had pitched a complete game that day , was on the cover of the next day 's Plain Dealer . Richard Goldstein of The New York Times called the photograph " a signature moment in the integration of Major League Baseball . " Of the picture , Doby said , " The picture was more rewarding and happy for me than actually hitting the home run . The picture finally showed a moment of a man showing his feelings for me . " The Indians defeated the Braves in six games and with it , Cleveland had its first World Series championship since the 1920 season . Doby 's .318 batting average during the Series led the Indians . Nationally syndicated columnist Grantland Rice argued that without Doby and Gene Bearden , who had won 20 games that year , the Indians would have finished in fourth or fifth place . After the Series , Doby received a celebratory parade in Paterson , New Jersey , and during the offseason he , along with other teammates , appeared in the 1949 film The Kid From Cleveland . With additional income available due to the post @-@ season run and Series championship , Doby and his wife attempted to buy a home in Paterson in an all @-@ white neighborhood but were kept out by a petition from members of the community . The <unk> were allowed to purchase their desired home when the Paterson city mayor intervened on their behalf . 
 During the 1949 season , Doby was selected to his first MLB All @-@ Star Game . He was one of five Indians selected by Boudreau and joined Jackie Robinson , Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe as the first black players to be amongst those chosen to participate in the 1949 All @-@ Star Game . Boudreau fined Doby after he attempted to steal home with no outs and bases loaded in a game against the Yankees on July 20 . Of the fine , Boudreau said , " It was not based only on that attempt to steal home . Larry has taken several unnecessary chances lately . This should make him more careful . " His home run ( 24 ) and RBI ( 85 ) totals increased during the 1949 season , and by 1950 , he was considered the best center fielder in the game by The Sporting News . By the first week in July , Doby 's .370 batting average trailed only 1949 AL batting champion George Kell , who had a .375 average . He earned career @-@ bests in batting average ( .326 ) , hits ( 164 ) and on @-@ base percentage ( OBP ) ( .442 ) , while playing in 142 games . Doby hit the 100 @-@ RBI mark ( 102 ) for the first time in his career while his OBP led the AL . He finished eighth in AL MVP voting , highest among outfielders . At the end of the season , Cleveland signed him to a new , more lucrative contract . Doby was named by Cleveland sports writers as the Cleveland Baseball Man of the Year after the season , the first time a black player was chosen . 
 = = = = 1951 – 1955 = = = = 
 Doby hit 20 home runs and 69 RBIs in 1951 , both fewer than last season , and his batting average improved to .295 . His 21 @-@ game hit @-@ streak was the second @-@ longest for the Indians that season , behind Dale Mitchell 's mark of 23 games in a row . Indians general manager Hank Greenberg reduced Doby 's salary due to the lower home run numbers despite Doby , who attributed the lower numbers to tightness in his legs , stating he would not accept a pay cut . Indians manager Al López confirmed that Doby was injury @-@ riddled throughout the season , stating that he " was beset by first one injury and then another " including " a muscle tear in his thigh , a groin pull , an ankle twist . " Doby received blame for the Indians ' failure to win the AL pennant and was labeled a " loner " by some in the press , including Plain Dealer sports editor Gordon Cobbledick who in an article in Sport wrote " Larry 's a mixed @-@ up guy — a badly mixed @-@ up guy " stemming from " the emotional impact of discovering racial prejudice against him . " Cobbledick also took issue with Doby 's assertion that opposing pitchers were knocking him down due to Doby being black . The assertion was confirmed by Sam Lacy , who wrote in the Baltimore Afro @-@ American , " Statistics show that eight colored players in the two major leagues were hit by pitches a total of 68 times during the 1951 campaign , an average of 8 1 ⁄ 2 times per man . No other player was hit as many as eight times in the season . " 
 One month before spring training for the 1952 season , Doby employed former Olympic track and field athlete Harrison Dillard to come to his home in New Jersey to prepare his legs in hopes of eliminating injuries , which had affected him the previous season . Dillard and the Indians ' team doctor prescribed lower @-@ body warm @-@ ups to Doby before the start of each game . Leg injuries continued to bother Doby during the start of the season . On June 4 , 1952 , he hit for the cycle . By the end of the 1952 season , Doby was second in the AL in RBIs to teammate Al Rosen by one , 105 to 104 . His <unk> slugging percentage , runs scored ( 104 ) , strikeout ( 111 ) , and home run ( 32 ) totals were all highest in the AL . 
 Leading up to the 1953 season , Doby asked Greenberg and Indians management for a pay raise after earning $ 22 @,@ 000 the previous season . In early March , the raise was granted , and he was slated to make $ 28 @,@ 000 that year . For 1953 , Doby had a .263 batting average , which was his lowest since joining the league in 1947 . He led the AL in strikeouts for the second and final time in his career , a career @-@ high 121 times , but hit 29 home runs and 102 RBIs on the year . He also had 96 walks , which was third in the AL . 
 For the sixth time in his major league career , Doby was named an All @-@ Star during the 1954 season , one of five Indians named . The game was held at Cleveland 's Municipal Stadium and featured the second @-@ largest crowd to watch an All @-@ Star Game ( the largest was in 1935 at the same stadium ) . In what would prove his final career All @-@ Star at bat , Doby hit a pinch @-@ hit solo home run in the eighth inning to tie the game at 9 – 9 ; the AL squad went on to win , 11 – 9 . His home run was the first hit by a black player in an All @-@ Star Game . The game , which had a record 17 hits by the AL and was the highest @-@ scoring All @-@ Star Game until 1998 , was called the best ever by All @-@ Star Game founder Arch Ward . As the regular season resumed , Doby helped the Indians to win a franchise @-@ record 111 games and the AL pennant . His regular season 32 home runs and career @-@ high 126 RBIs were highest in the AL , which led to him finishing second in AL MVP voting . The Indians were swept in the 1954 World Series by Doby 's former Eagles teammate Monte Irvin and the New York Giants . 
 In his last full season with the Indians in 1955 , Doby was selected for his seventh consecutive and final All @-@ Star Game . Doby 's leg injuries affected him severely at this point in his career and he did not enter the game . He finished the 1955 season with 26 home runs and 75 RBIs while hitting .291 in 131 games , his fewest played since 1948 . Not all in Cleveland were disappointed to see Doby leaving . Wrote one Plain Dealer columnist , Franklin Lewis : " He has been a controversial athlete . Highly gifted , he was frequently morose , sullen , and upon occasion , downright surly to his teammates ... He thought of himself , at the beginning , as the symbol of the Negro in his league . " Doby responded , " I was looked on as a Black man , not as a human being . I did feel a responsibility to the Black players who came after me , but that was a responsibility , basically , to people , not just to Black people . " 
 = = = Latter years ( 1956 – 1960 ) = = = 
 After spending nine seasons with Cleveland , Doby was traded on October 25 , 1955 , to the Chicago White Sox for Chico Carrasquel and Jim Busby . Chicago was looking for a consistent home run hitter after finishing the season with 116 home runs as a team . " The search is over for a long ball hitter . We 've certainly needed a consistent one — and we 've been eying Doby for some time " , said White Sox vice president Chuck Comiskey . White Sox manager Marty Marion believed Doby 's bat would be a welcome addition to his club when he said , " The guy used to murder us when we played Cleveland . He 'll make a big difference in the number of one @-@ run and two @-@ run decisions we might lose . " After winning a doubleheader against the Yankees on June 22 , 1956 , Doby and the White Sox swept New York , the first time since the 1945 season the Yankees had been swept in a four @-@ game series . The White Sox won eight straight games , the longest winning streak in the AL to that point in the season , and had done so with the help of Doby 's six home runs during the eight @-@ game stretch . " You know , when we dealt for Doby , we weren 't worried about Larry . We knew he 'd come through " , Comiskey said . Doby finished the season with a .268 batting average and led the team with 24 home runs and 102 RBIs . Chicago finished 1956 in third place in the AL with an 85 – 69 record . 
 In a game on August 20 , 1957 against the Washington Senators , Doby helped preserve pitcher Bob Keegan 's no @-@ hitter with a backhand catch off a long line drive from Herb Plews , one of " two close calls " for Keegan that game . His 1957 home run total of 14 tied for the team @-@ high , as he managed a .288 average and recorded 79 RBIs , second @-@ highest on the team after former Indians teammate Minnie Miñoso . The White Sox finished second in the AL with a 90 – 64 record . 
 Doby was part of a December 3 , 1957 , multi @-@ player trade between the White Sox and Baltimore Orioles , then was traded again on April 1 to Cleveland along with Don Ferrarese for Gene Woodling , Bud Daley , and Dick Williams . He appeared in 89 games with the Indians that season and had a .289 batting average , 13 home runs , and 45 RBIs . He was sent to the Detroit Tigers on March 21 , 1959 , in exchange for Tito Francona . Tigers general manager Rick Ferrell said , " this gives us some more power and we just hope Doby hits as well in Briggs Stadium this season as he has in other years . " With the Tigers he appeared in 18 games and was the first black player to play for the Tiger franchise . He hit .218 with four RBIs before Detroit sold the 35 @-@ year @-@ old Doby to the White Sox on May 13 for $ 20 @,@ 000 . 
 After 21 games with the White Sox , he was sent to Triple @-@ A affiliate San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League after hitting .241 with no home runs and 9 RBIs . Doby fractured an ankle while sliding into third base after hitting a triple during a road game the Padres played against Sacramento , and was sent to a local hospital in Sacramento before going to Johns Hopkins Hospital for further evaluation . Doby worked out with the White Sox before the 1960 season but , due to nagging injuries , did not earn a roster spot . In late April he joined the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League on a trial basis but was released by the team on May 6 after X @-@ rays showed bone deterioration in his affected ankle . 
 Doby finished his 13 @-@ year major league career with a .283 batting average , accumulated 1 @,@ 515 hits , 253 home runs and 970 RBIs in 1 @,@ 533 games and 5 @,@ 348 at @-@ bats . Of his 1 @,@ 533 career games , 1 @,@ 146 of them were spent with the Indians . " I played against great talent in the Major Leagues and I played against great talent in the Negro Leagues . I didn 't see a lot of difference " , said Doby .

 Doby had participated in baseball clinics in 1962 as a member of a travel delegation from the U.S. Department of State . That year , Doby came out of retirement and became one of the first Americans to play professional baseball in Japan 's Nippon Professional Baseball league when he and Don Newcombe , a former teammate with the Newark Eagles , signed contracts with the Chunichi Dragons . After the season , Doby returned to the U.S. in October and resumed his work as a liquor retailer .

 After retiring as a player , Doby became a scout with the Montreal Expos in 1969 and served as a minor league instructor with the organization in 1970 . He was batting coach under manager Gene Mauch from 1971 to 1973 and again in 1976 . He managed various teams during five seasons of winter league baseball in Venezuela , including Águilas del Zulia during the 1970 – 71 winter season . Doby rejoined the Indians for the 1974 season as first base coach for manager Ken Aspromonte . When Aspromonte was fired after the 1974 season , the Indians named Frank Robinson the club 's player @-@ manager and baseball 's first black manager . 
 After Robinson 's hire as manager , Doby returned to work for the Expos . In 1976 , Bill Veeck purchased the White Sox for a second time and hired Doby to be the team 's batting coach . As a team , the White Sox finished the 1976 season with a .255 batting average , 586 runs scored and 73 home runs . By June 29 , 1977 , the team 's average was .284 , and had recorded 382 runs scored and 87 home runs . They finished the season second in team batting average ( to the Yankees and Red Sox , each with a .281 average ) and had 192 home runs and 844 runs scored as a team . After firing the White Sox 's manager and former Doby teammate Bob Lemon , Veeck replaced him with Doby on June 30 , 1978 . At age 53 , Doby became the second black manager in the majors after Robinson . " It 's so nice to work for a man like Bill Veeck . You just work as hard as you can , and if the opportunity arises , you will certainly get the opportunity to fulfill your dreams " , Doby said after being named White Sox manager . 
 To that point in the season , the White Sox had a 34 – 40 record . On July 1 in his first game as manager , the White Sox suffered a 10 @-@ 0 loss to the Minnesota Twins but Doby won his first game , 8 – 5 , the next day against the same team . The White Sox finished 71 – 90 , including 37 – 50 under Doby , in what would be Doby 's sole managerial role . Veeck hired player @-@ manager Don Kessinger to succeed Doby after deciding not to re @-@ hire Doby , although Kessinger resigned as manager in the second half of the 1979 season . After removing Doby from the manager 's role and reassigning him to batting coach , the position Doby held before being named manager , Veeck said , " Larry will always have a role on this team in some capacity . " He served in that role for one additional season and resigned in October 1979 . 
 After retiring from baseball , Doby was named director of communications for the National Basketball Association 's New Jersey Nets from 1980 to 1989 and also served as the Nets ' director of community affairs until 1990 . Doby was named special assistant to the AL 's last president , Gene <unk> , on April 17 , 1995 .

 The New York Times wrote , " In glorifying those who are first , the second is often forgotten ... Larry Doby integrated all those American League ball parks where Jackie Robinson never appeared . And he did it with class and clout . " During the 1997 season , when the long @-@ departed Jackie Robinson 's number 42 was being retired throughout baseball , and the still @-@ living Doby was being virtually ignored by the media , an editorial in Sports Illustrated pointed out that Doby had to suffer the same indignities that Robinson did , and with nowhere near the media attention and implicit support . Scoop Jackson in 2007 wrote , in response to the tradition of MLB players wearing jerseys in homage of Robinson , " Second place finishers in America are suckers . And so are those who make the story of history less simple than it needs to be . This happens sometimes in America . Those who don 't come first or don 't do things a certain way get lost . They disappear . " " Jackie got all the publicity for putting up with it ( racial slurs ) . But it was the same thing I had to deal with . He was first , but the crap I took was just as bad . Nobody said , ' We 're gonna be nice to the second Black , ' " Doby said . 
 Doby served as one of the pallbearers at Robinson 's funeral . As fellow Hall of Famer Joe Morgan wrote , " Anyone who knew Larry knew that he admired Robinson and was never jealous of the attention Robinson received . " Former teammate Al Rosen said : 
 " Jackie was a college educated man who had been an officer in the service and who played at the Triple @-@ A level . Jackie was brought in by Branch Rickey specifically to be the first black player in major league baseball . Larry Doby came up as a second baseman who didn 't have time to get his full college education , and was forced to play a different position in his first major league season . I think , because of those circumstances , he had a more difficult time than Jackie Robinson . I don 't think he has gotten the credit he deserves . " 
 Doby experienced many prejudices during his time before , during , and after the majors . One incident took place during a game as Doby was sliding into second base when the shortstop from the opposing team spat tobacco juice on him . Doby called it the worst injustice he experienced on the field . He endured many racial slurs , from the stands and elsewhere , during games . He also received death threats . After he had retired as a player , Doby recalled memories of his days as a barrier @-@ breaker . " You know why I hit so well in Washington and St. Louis ? They were major Jim Crow seating parks and when I came to bat , I knew where the noise was coming from and who was making it . I felt like a quarterback with 5 @,@ 000 cheerleaders calling his name . You know most of them couldn 't afford to be there . I never forgot them . " 
 Shortly after the Indians had honored Doby by naming a nearby street after him , The Plain Dealer columnist Bill Livingston wrote , " The Larry Doby way of pioneering was the same as the Jackie Robinson way in the National League , only Doby 's debut occurred six short weeks later and with almost no advance preparation by Doby or the Indians . " Doby threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the 1997 Major League Baseball All @-@ Star Game , played at Jacobs Field . The decision to have the game in Cleveland coincided with the 1997 season marking the fiftieth anniversary of Robinson breaking baseball 's color barrier . It was also 50 years and 3 days since Doby became the first black player in the American League .

 Doby was elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame on March 3 , 1998 , by the Veterans Committee at the age of 74 . " This is just a tremendous feeling . It 's kind of like a bale of cotton has been on your shoulders , and now it 's off " , said Doby . When he received word about his election it was via telephone call from fellow Hall member Ted Williams . Upon hearing of Doby 's election , Gene Mauch , said , " You have to be some kind of special person to go through what Larry and Jackie Robinson went through . They both are . I 'm not too sure there 's a player in the game today who could handle it . " 
 He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum on July 26 , 1998 . Doby became the first member born in South Carolina elected to the Hall . Although he was the first to play in MLB , Doby was the last member elected to the Hall of the four players to ever play in both a Negro league and MLB World Series , the others being Satchel Paige , Monte Irvin , and Willie Mays .

 Doby and his wife , Helyn , had five children , six grandchildren and four great @-@ grandchildren . When the <unk> moved to Montclair , Yogi Berra and his wife became neighborhood friends and children of the two families played baseball and football together . Doby had a kidney removed in 1997 after a cancerous tumour was detected . Helyn , married to Doby for 55 years , died in 2001 after a six @-@ month battle with cancer . 
 Doby died on June 18 , 2003 , at his home in Montclair , New Jersey , at age 79 after suffering cancer . When Doby died , President George W. Bush made the following statement : 
 " Larry Doby was a good and honorable man , and a tremendous athlete and manager . He had a profound influence on the game of baseball , and he will be missed . As the first African American player in the American League , he helped lead the Cleveland Indians to their last World Series title in 1948 , became a nine @-@ time All @-@ Star and was voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1998 . Laura joins me in sending our condolences to Larry 's family during this difficult time . " 
 MLB Commissioner Bud Selig ( 1998 – 2015 ) released a statement a day following Doby 's death : 
 " ... Like Jackie , he endured the pain of being a pioneer with grace , dignity , and determination and eased the way for all who followed . He achieved another historic second 31 years later he became the second African @-@ American to manage a big league club , following Frank Robinson . " 
 Former MLB Commissioner Fay Vincent said : 
 " Larry 's role in history was recognized slowly and belatedly . Jackie Robinson , who broke the color line first but in the same year , quite naturally received most of the attention . Larry played out his career with dignity and then slid gracefully into various front @-@ office positions in basketball and then later in baseball . Only in the 90 's did baseball wake up to the obvious fact that Larry was every bit as deserving of recognition as Jackie . " 
 Long before Doby was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame came induction in the Indians Hall of Fame in August 1966 . Later , in May 1973 , he was inducted into the South Carolina Hall of Fame and in 2010 , the New Jersey Hall of Fame . On August 10 , 2007 , the Indians paid tribute to Doby on Larry Doby Day by collectively using his number ( 14 ) on their uniforms . The franchise again honored him when in 2012 , Eagle Avenue , next to the Indians ' Progressive Field , was renamed " Larry Doby Way " in an on @-@ field postgame ceremony . Among those present at the ceremony were Jim " Mudcat " Grant , Indians president Mark Shapiro , Cleveland mayor Frank Jackson , and various members of Doby 's family . 
 The city of Paterson , New Jersey , renamed the Eastside Park baseball field " Larry Doby Field " on June 1 , 2002 . The Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center has a section named the Larry Doby Wing . Of Berra , Doby said , " Yogi was one of the first opposing players to talk to me . As a catcher , Yogi talked to everybody . I finally had to tell the umpire : ' Please tell him to shut up . He asked me how my family was back in the first inning . ' " In 2011 , the U.S. Postal Service announced that Doby would be one of the four baseball players ( along with Ted Williams , Joe DiMaggio , and Willie Stargell ) to appear on a postage stamp in 2012 , as part of its " Major League Baseball All @-@ Stars " series . The stamp was released July 21 , 2012 . 
 = SMS Prinz Heinrich = 
 SMS Prinz Heinrich was a unique German armored cruiser built at the turn of the 20th century for the Imperial German Navy , named after Kaiser Wilhelm II 's younger brother Prince Henry . Prinz Heinrich was built at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel . She was laid down in 1898 and completed in March 1902 , at the cost of 16 @,@ 588 @,@ 000 Marks . Prinz Heinrich 's design was a modification of the previous armored cruiser , Fürst Bismarck , and traded a smaller main battery for higher speed and more comprehensive armor protection . The ship set a precedent for subsequent German armored cruisers by concentrating her secondary armament amidships , as opposed to Fürst Bismarck , which spread the secondary armament along the length of the ship . 
 Prinz Heinrich served with the German fleet for the majority of her career . After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , the ship participated in the operation against the British coast in December 1914 , after which she was transferred to the Baltic Sea . Here , she operated against the Russian navy and was involved in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915 , where she damaged a Russian destroyer . In 1916 , the ship was withdrawn from active duty and was used in several secondary roles in Kiel , including acting as a floating office for naval staff . Prinz Heinrich was ultimately sold in 1920 and broken up for scrap later that year . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Second Naval Law in Germany , passed in 1900 , envisioned a force of fourteen armored cruisers intended for overseas service in the German colonies . However , the German Navy required cruisers for operations with the fleet as well , and attempted to design ships that could fulfill both roles , primarily due to budget constraints . The first product of the 1900 Naval Law , Prinz Heinrich was an alteration of an earlier vessel , Fürst Bismarck , and was equipped with fewer guns and thinner armor in a trade @-@ off for higher speed and lower cost . The design also set the precedent of concentrating the secondary battery amidships ; Fürst Bismarck secondary guns had been spread along the length of the hull . All subsequent armored cruisers were developments of Prinz Heinrich . Prinz Heinrich was laid down in 1898 at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel . She was launched on 22 March 1900 and completed just under two years later , on 11 March 1902 . The new cruiser cost 16 @,@ 588 @,@ 000 Marks . 
 = = = Dimensions and machinery = = = 
 Prinz Heinrich was 124 @.@ 9 meters ( 410 ft ) long at the waterline and 126 @.@ 5 m ( 415 ft ) overall . She had a beam of 19 @.@ 6 m ( 64 ft ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 65 m ( 25 @.@ 1 ft ) forward and 8 @.@ 07 m ( 26 @.@ 5 ft ) aft . The ship displaced 8 @,@ 887 metric tons ( 8 @,@ 747 long tons ; 9 @,@ 796 short tons ) as built , and 9 @,@ 806 t ( 9 @,@ 651 long tons ; 10 @,@ 809 short tons ) at full combat load . The hull was constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames , and incorporated thirteen watertight compartments and a double bottom that extended for 57 percent of the length of the ship . The German navy considered the ship to be a good sea boat with gentle motion , though she suffered from severe roll . Her transverse metacentric height was <unk> m ( 2 ft 4 @.@ 8 in ) . Prinz Heinrich was manned by a crew of 35 officers and 532 enlisted men . For the duration of her career as the second command flagship of the Cruiser Division , the standard crew was augmented by an additional nine officers and 44 enlisted men . She carried a number of smaller vessels , including two picket boats , a launch , a pinnace , two cutters , two yawls , and two dinghies . 
 The ship was propelled by three vertical 4 @-@ cylinder triple expansion engines ; the center shaft drove a four @-@ bladed screw 4 @.@ 28 m ( 14 @.@ 0 ft ) in diameter while the two outer shafts drove 4 @.@ 65 @-@ meter ( 15 @.@ 3 ft ) wide four @-@ bladed screws . Fourteen Dürr boilers , produced by Düsseldorf @-@ Ratinger Röhrenkesselfabrik , supplied steam to the engines at pressures up to 15 standard atmospheres ( 1 @,@ 500 kPa ) . The propulsion system was rated at 15 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 11 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave the ship a top speed of 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) , though on sea trials , Prinz Heinrich 's engines reached 15 @,@ 694 ihp ( 11 @,@ 703 kW ) but a top speed of only 19 @.@ 9 kn ( 36 @.@ 9 km / h ; 22 @.@ 9 mph ) . She was designed to carry 900 t ( 890 long tons ; 990 short tons ) of coal , though additional storage allowed up to 1 @,@ 590 t ( 1 @,@ 560 long tons ; 1 @,@ 750 short tons ) . This enabled a maximum range of 2 @,@ 290 nautical miles ( 4 @,@ 240 km ; 2 @,@ 640 mi ) at a speed of 18 kn ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) and 4 @,@ 580 nmi ( 8 @,@ 480 km ; 5 @,@ 270 mi ) at a cruising speed of 10 kn ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 Prinz Heinrich was protected by Krupp armor . Her armor belt was 100 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick in the central portion of the ship , which protected the ammunition magazines , machinery spaces , and other vital areas of the cruiser . The belt was reduced to 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) on either end of the main belt , and the bow and stern were unarmored . The entire length of the belt was backed by equal thicknesses of teak planks . The armored deck was 35 to 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 4 to 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick and was connected to the belt by 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick sloped armor on the broadside . 
 The forward conning tower had 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides and a 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick roof . The aft conning tower was much less thoroughly protected ; it was covered by only 12 mm ( 0 @.@ 47 in ) of steel plating . The main battery gun turrets had 150 mm @-@ thick sides and 30 mm @-@ thick roofs . The 15 cm gun turrets had 100 mm @-@ thick armor , while the casemated weapons were protected by 70 mm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) gun shields . The casemates themselves were armored with 100 mm worth of steel plating . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Prinz Heinrich was armed with a variety of weapons . Her primary armament consisted of two 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) SK L / 40 quick @-@ firing guns mounted in single turrets , one on either end of the superstructure . These guns were supplied with 75 rounds each ; they could depress to − 4 ° and elevate to 30 ° , which enabled a maximum range of 16 @,@ 900 m ( 18 @,@ 500 yd ) . The guns fired a 140 kg ( 310 lb ) round at a muzzle velocity of 835 m ( 2 @,@ 740 ft ) per second . A secondary battery of ten 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) SK L / 40 quick @-@ firing guns rounded out her offensive armament . Six of these guns were mounted in amidships casemates on either side of the vessel , and the remaining four were mounted in turrets in the ship 's hull above the casemates . These guns were supplied with 120 rounds each . The shells weighed 40 kg ( 88 lb ) and were fired at a muzzle velocity of 800 m ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) per second . The guns could elevate to 25 ° for a maximum range of 13 @,@ 700 m ( 15 @,@ 000 yd ) . 
 The cruiser carried ten 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) SK L / 30 quick @-@ firing guns for defense against torpedo boats . Each of these guns was supplied with 250 shells . The shells weighed 7 kg ( 15 lb ) and were fired at a muzzle velocity of 670 m ( 2 @,@ 200 ft ) per second . This enabled a maximum range of 7 @,@ 300 m ( 8 @,@ 000 yd ) at an elevation of 20 ° . The ship 's gun armament was rounded out by four autocannons , though these were subsequently removed . The ship was also fitted with four 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes . One was mounted on the stern in a swivel mount , one was mounted submerged in the bow , and one was placed submerged in the hull on either side abreast of the forward gun turret . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Following her commissioning in 1902 , Prinz Heinrich served with the fleet . She was the flagship of the Cruiser Division , along with the protected cruiser Victoria Louise and eight light cruisers . In January 1904 , the cruiser and two passenger ships went to the Norwegian town of Ålesund in the aftermath of a fire that destroyed the town . The ships carried supplies and medical stores to the port and assisted with the relief effort . She was reassigned to the II Subdivision of the Cruiser Division of the Active Fleet in 1905 , after the arrival of the new armored cruiser Friedrich Carl . The II Subdivision also included the light cruisers Arcona , Hamburg , and Amazone , and was attached to the II Squadron of the Active Fleet . A second subdivision , composed of an armored cruiser and three light cruisers was attached to the I Squadron . 
 Prinz Heinrich conducted a series of tests with the Miller apparatus , a device used by the US Navy to resupply warships at sea , in February 1907 . The ship engaged in the experiments with the collier Hermann Sauber ; the first test took place on 17 February , and resulted in the crew being able to transfer 56 short tons ( 51 t ) of coal per hour . On the 22nd , another test was undertaken , under harsh weather conditions , and similar results were reached . In 1914 , Prinz Heinrich went into drydock at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel for modernization . The arrangement of the searchlights was modified , the superstructure deck bulwark was removed , and the masts were modernized . Following the improvements , she returned to the fleet . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 Following the wave of declarations of war between the major European powers at the end of July 1914 , Britain declared war on Germany on 5 August . Prinz Heinrich participated in the second major German offensive in the North Sea , the operation to bombard Hartlepool on 15 – 16 December 1914 . Prinz Heinrich , along with Roon and a flotilla of torpedo boats , was assigned to the van of the High Seas Fleet , commanded by Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl . The main fleet was providing distant cover to Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper 's battlecruisers , which were conducting the bombardment . During the night of the 15th , the German battle fleet of some twelve dreadnoughts and eight pre @-@ dreadnoughts came to within 10 nmi ( 19 km ; 12 mi ) of an isolated squadron of six British battleships . However , skirmishes between the rival destroyer screens in the darkness convinced von Ingenohl that he was faced with the entire Grand Fleet . Under orders from Kaiser Wilhelm II to avoid risking the fleet unnecessarily , von Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battle fleet back toward Germany . After the operation , it was determined that the twelve @-@ year @-@ old Prinz Heinrich had no place in operations against the powerful British Grand Fleet , and she was transferred to the Baltic Sea to operate against the Russian Baltic Fleet . 
 Rear Admiral Hopman , the commander of the reconnaissance forces in the Baltic , conducted a major assault on Libau , in conjunction with an attempt by the German Army to seize the city . The attack took place on 7 May , and consisted of Prinz Heinrich and the armored cruisers Roon and Prinz Adalbert , the elderly coast defense ship Beowulf , and the light cruisers Augsburg , Thetis , and Lübeck . They were escorted by a number of destroyers , torpedo boats , and minesweepers . The IV Scouting Group of the High Seas Fleet was detached from the North Sea to provide cover for the operation . The bombardment went as planned , though the destroyer V107 struck a mine in Libau 's harbor , which blew off her bow and destroyed the ship . German ground forces were successful in their assault however , and took the city . 
 On 1 July , the minelayer SMS Albatross , escorted by the cruisers Roon , Augsburg , and Lübeck and seven destroyers , laid a minefield north of Bogskär . While returning to port , the flotilla separated into two sections ; Augsburg , Albatross , and three destroyers made for Rixhöft while the remainder of the unit went to Libau . Augsburg and Albatross were intercepted by a powerful Russian squadron commanded by Rear Admiral Bakhirev , consisting of three armored and two light cruisers . Commodore Johannes von Karpf , the flotilla commander , ordered the slower Albatross to steam for neutral Swedish waters and recalled Roon and Lübeck . Albatross was grounded off Gotland and Augsburg escaped , and the Russian squadron briefly engaged Roon before both sides broke contact . Upon being informed of the situation , Hopman sortied with Prinz Heinrich and Prinz Adalbert to support von Karpf . While en route , the cruisers encountered the British submarine E9 , which scored a hit on Prinz Adalbert . Hopman broke off the operation and returned to port with the damaged cruiser . 
 German naval forces in the Baltic were reinforced by elements of the High Seas Fleet during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915 . The Germans sought to drive out the Russians in the Gulf of Riga and to lay defensive minefields that would prevent a Russian counterattack . The battleships of the I Battle Squadron were the primary force , though Prinz Heinrich and the rest of the older vessels assigned to the Baltic fleet participated . On 10 August , Prinz Heinrich and Roon bombarded Russian defenses at Zerel , on the southernmost tip of the Sworbe Peninsula on the island of Ösel . Several Russian destroyers were anchored off Zerel , and were caught unawares by the German bombardment . Prinz Heinrich and Roon damaged one of the destroyers during their attack . A combination of tenacious Russian defense and reports of British submarines in the area — proved by the torpedoing of the battlecruiser Moltke on 19 August — caused the German navy to break off the operation . 
 Beginning in 1916 , Prinz Heinrich was removed from front @-@ line service and used as a floating office in Kiel . After she left active duty , the ship had her armament removed . She was subsequently used as a tender , also in Kiel , for the remainder of her service career . She was stricken from the navy list on 25 January 1920 and sold later that year . The ship was ultimately broken up for scrap at Audorf @-@ Rendsburg .

 Malaysia ( / <unk> / mə @-@ LAY @-@ <unk> or / <unk> / mə @-@ LAY @-@ see @-@ ə ; Malaysian pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ) is a federal constitutional monarchy located in Southeast Asia . It consists of thirteen states and three federal territories and has a total landmass of 330 @,@ 803 square kilometres ( 127 @,@ 720 sq mi ) separated by the South China Sea into two similarly sized regions , Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia ( Malaysian Borneo ) . Peninsular Malaysia shares a land and maritime border with Thailand and maritime borders with Singapore , Vietnam , and Indonesia . East Malaysia shares land and maritime borders with Brunei and Indonesia and a maritime border with the Philippines and Vietnam . The capital city is Kuala Lumpur , while Putrajaya is the seat of the federal government . With a population of over 30 million , Malaysia is the 44th most populous country . The southernmost point of continental Eurasia , Tanjung <unk> , is in Malaysia . Located in the tropics , Malaysia is one of 17 megadiverse countries on earth , with large numbers of endemic species . 
 Malaysia has its origins in the Malay kingdoms present in the area which , from the 18th century , became subject to the British Empire . The first British territories were known as the Straits Settlements , whose establishment was followed by the Malay kingdoms becoming British protectorates . The territories on Peninsular Malaysia were first unified as the Malayan Union in 1946 . Malaya was restructured as the Federation of Malaya in 1948 , and achieved independence on 31 August 1957 . Malaya united with North Borneo , Sarawak , and Singapore on 16 September 1963 . Less than two years later in 1965 , Singapore was expelled from the federation . 
 The country is multi @-@ ethnic and multi @-@ cultural , which plays a large role in politics . About half the population is ethnically Malay , with large minorities of Malaysian Chinese , Malaysian Indians , and indigenous peoples . The constitution declares Islam the state religion while allowing freedom of religion for non @-@ Muslims . The government system is closely modelled on the Westminster parliamentary system and the legal system is based on common law . The head of state is the king , known as the Yang di @-@ Pertuan Agong . He is an elected monarch chosen from the hereditary rulers of the nine Malay states every five years . The head of government is the prime minister . 
 Since its independence , Malaysia has had one of the best economic records in Asia , with its GDP growing at an average of 6 @.@ 5 % per annum for almost 50 years . The economy has traditionally been fuelled by its natural resources , but is expanding in the sectors of science , tourism , commerce and medical tourism . Today , Malaysia has a newly industrialised market economy , ranked third largest in Southeast Asia and 29th largest in the world . It is a founding member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations , the East Asia Summit and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , and a member of Asia @-@ Pacific Economic Cooperation , the Commonwealth of Nations , and the Non @-@ Aligned Movement . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name " Malaysia " is a combination of the word " Malay " and the Latin @-@ Greek suffix " <unk> " / <unk> . The word " <unk> " in Malay may derive from the Tamil words " <unk> " and " ur " meaning " mountain " and " city , land " , respectively . " <unk> " was the word used by ancient Indian traders when referring to the Malay Peninsula . Whether or not it originated from these roots , the word " <unk> " or " <unk> " may have been used in early Malay / Javanese to mean to steadily accelerate or run . This term was applied to describe the strong current of the river Melayu in Sumatra . The name was later adopted by the Melayu Kingdom that existed in the seventh century on Sumatra . 
 Before the onset of European colonisation , the Malay Peninsula was known natively as " Tanah Melayu " ( " Malay Land " ) . Under a racial classification created by a German scholar Johann Friedrich Blumenbach , the natives of maritime Southeast Asia were grouped into a single category , the Malay race . Following the expedition of French navigator Jules Dumont d 'Urville to Oceania in 1826 , he later proposed the terms of " Malaysia " , " Micronesia " and " Melanesia " to the Société de Géographie in 1831 , distinguishing these Pacific cultures and island groups from the existing term " Polynesia " . Dumont d 'Urville described Malaysia as " an area commonly known as the East Indies " . In 1850 , the English ethnologist George Samuel Windsor Earl , writing in the Journal of the Indian Archipelago and Eastern Asia , proposed naming the islands of Southeast Asia as " <unk> " or " <unk> " , favouring the former . In modern terminology , " Malay " remains the name of an <unk> group of Austronesian people predominantly inhabiting the Malay Peninsula and portions of the adjacent islands of Southeast Asia , including the east coast of Sumatra , the coast of Borneo , and smaller islands that lie between these areas . 
 The state that gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1957 took the name the " Federation of Malaya " , chosen in preference to other potential names such as " Langkasuka " , after the historic kingdom located at the upper section of the Malay Peninsula in the first millennium CE . The name " Malaysia " was adopted in 1963 when the existing states of the Federation of Malaya , plus Singapore , North Borneo and Sarawak formed a new federation . One theory posits the name was chosen so that " si " represented the inclusion of Singapore , North Borneo , and Sarawak to Malaya in 1963 . Politicians in the Philippines contemplated renaming their state " Malaysia " before the modern country took the name . 
 = = History = = 
 Evidence of modern human habitation in Malaysia dates back 40 @,@ 000 years . In the Malay Peninsular , the first inhabitants are thought to be Negritos . Traders and settlers from India and China arrived as early as the first century AD , establishing trading ports and coastal towns in the second and third centuries . Their presence resulted in strong Indian and Chinese influences on the local cultures , and the people of the Malay Peninsula adopted the religions of Hinduism and Buddhism . Sanskrit inscriptions appear as early as the fourth or fifth century . The Kingdom of Langkasuka arose around the second century in the northern area of the Malay Peninsula , lasting until about the 15th century . Between the 7th and 13th centuries , much of the southern Malay Peninsula was part of the maritime Srivijaya Empire . After the fall of Srivijaya , the Majapahit Empire had influence over most of Peninsular Malaysia and the Malay Archipelago . Islam began to spread among Malays in the 14th century . In the early 15th century , Sultan Iskandar Shah , a runaway king of the former Kingdom of Singapura , founded the Malacca Sultanate , commonly considered the first independent state in the peninsula area . Malacca was an important commercial centre during this time , attracting trade from around the region . 
 In 1511 , Malacca was conquered by Portugal , after which it was taken by the Dutch in 1641 . In 1786 , the British Empire established a presence in Malaya , when the Sultan of Kedah leased Penang Island to the British East India Company . The British obtained the town of Singapore in 1819 , and in 1824 took control of Malacca following the Anglo @-@ Dutch Treaty . By 1826 , the British directly controlled Penang , Malacca , Singapore , and the island of Labuan , which they established as the crown colony of the Straits Settlements . By the 20th century , the states of Pahang , Selangor , Perak , and Negeri Sembilan , known together as the Federated Malay States , had British residents appointed to advise the Malay rulers , to whom the rulers were bound to defer to by treaty . The remaining five states in the peninsula , known as the Unfederated Malay States , while not directly under British rule , also accepted British advisers around the turn of the 20th century . Development on the peninsula and Borneo were generally separate until the 19th century . Under British rule the immigration of Chinese and Indians to serve as labourers was encouraged . The area that is now Sabah came under British control as North Borneo when both the Sultan of Brunei and the Sultan of Sulu transferred their respective territorial rights of ownership , between 1877 and 1878 . In 1842 , Sarawak was ceded by the Sultan of Brunei to James Brooke , whose successors ruled as the White Rajahs over an independent kingdom until 1946 , when it became a crown colony . 
 In the Second World War , the Japanese Army invaded and occupied Malaya , North Borneo , Sarawak , and Singapore for over three years . During this time , ethnic tensions were raised and nationalism grew . Popular support for independence increased after Malaya was reconquered , by Allied forces . Post @-@ war British plans to unite the administration of Malaya under a single crown colony called the " Malayan Union " met with strong opposition from the Malays , who opposed the weakening of the Malay rulers and the granting of citizenship to the ethnic Chinese . The Malayan Union , established in 1946 , and consisting of all the British possessions in the Malay Peninsula with the exception of Singapore , was quickly dissolved and replaced on 1 February 1948 by the Federation of Malaya , which restored the autonomy of the rulers of the Malay states under British protection . During this time , mostly Chinese rebels under the leadership of the Malayan Communist Party launched guerrilla operations designed to force the British out of Malaya . The Malayan Emergency lasted from 1948 to 1960 , and involved a long anti @-@ insurgency campaign by Commonwealth troops in Malaya . On 31 August 1957 Malaya became an independent member of the Commonwealth of Nations . After this a plan was put in place to federate Malaya with the crown colonies of North Borneo ( which joined as Sabah ) , Sarawak , and Singapore . The date of federation was planned to be 31 August 1963 so as to coincide with the anniversary of Malayan independence ; however , federation was delayed until 16 September 1963 in order for a United Nations survey of support for federation in Sabah and Sarawak , called for by parties opposed to federation including Indonesia 's Sukarno and the Sarawak United Peoples ' Party , to be completed . 
 Federation brought heightened tensions including a conflict with Indonesia , Singapore 's eventual exit in 1965 , and racial strife . This strife culminated in the 13 May race riots in 1969 . After the riots , the controversial New Economic Policy was launched by Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak , trying to increase the share of the economy held by the bumiputera . Under Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad there was a period of rapid economic growth and urbanisation beginning in the 1980s . The economy shifted from being agriculturally based to one based on manufacturing and industry . Numerous mega @-@ projects were completed , such as the Petronas Towers , the North @-@ South Expressway , the Multimedia Super Corridor , and the new federal administrative capital of Putrajaya . However , in the late 1990s the Asian financial crisis almost caused the collapse of the currency and the stock and property markets . 
 = = Government and politics = = 
 Malaysia is a federal constitutional elective monarchy , and the only federation in Southeast Asia . The system of government is closely modelled on that of the Westminster parliamentary system , a legacy of British colonial rule . The head of state is the Yang di @-@ Pertuan Agong , commonly referred to as the King . The King is elected to a five @-@ year term by and from among the nine hereditary rulers of the Malay states ; the other four states , which have titular Governors , do not participate in the selection . By informal agreement the position is systematically rotated among the nine , and has been held by Abdul Halim of Kedah since December 2011 . The King 's role has been largely ceremonial since changes to the constitution in 1994 , picking ministers and members of the upper house . 
 Legislative power is divided between federal and state legislatures . The bicameral federal parliament consists of the lower house , the House of Representatives and the upper house , the Senate . The 222 @-@ member House of Representatives is elected for a maximum term of five years from single @-@ member constituencies . All 70 senators sit for three @-@ year terms ; 26 are elected by the 13 state assemblies , and the remaining 44 are appointed by the King upon the Prime Minister 's recommendation . The parliament follows a multi @-@ party system and the government is elected through a first @-@ past @-@ the @-@ post system . Since independence Malaysia has been governed by a 13 @-@ party coalition known as the Barisan Nasional . 
 Each state has a unicameral State Legislative Assembly whose members are elected from single @-@ member constituencies . State governments are led by Chief Ministers , who are state assembly members from the majority party in the assembly . In each of the states with a hereditary ruler , the Chief Minister is normally required to be a Malay , appointed by the ruler upon the recommendation of the Prime Minister . Parliamentary elections are held at least once every five years , the most recent of which took place in May 2013 . Registered voters of age 21 and above may vote for the members of the House of Representatives and , in most of the states , for the state legislative chamber . Voting is not mandatory . Except for state elections in Sarawak , by convention state elections are held concurrently with the federal election . 
 Executive power is vested in the Cabinet , led by the Prime Minister . The prime minister must be a member of the house of representatives , who in the opinion of the King , commands a majority in parliament . The cabinet is chosen from members of both houses of Parliament . The Prime Minister is both the head of cabinet and the head of government . The incumbent , Najib Razak , appointed in 2009 , is the sixth prime minister . 
 Malaysia 's legal system is based on English Common Law . Although the judiciary is theoretically independent , its independence has been called into question and the appointment of judges lacks accountability and transparency . The highest court in the judicial system is the Federal Court , followed by the Court of Appeal and two high courts , one for Peninsular Malaysia and one for East Malaysia . Malaysia also has a special court to hear cases brought by or against royalty . The death penalty is in use for crimes such as murder , terrorism and drug trafficking . Separate from and running parallel to the civil courts are the Syariah Courts , which apply Shariah law to Muslims in the areas of family law and religious observances . 
 Race is a significant force in politics , and many political parties are ethnically based . Affirmative actions such as the New Economic Policy and the National Development Policy which superseded it , were implemented to advance the standing of the bumiputera , consisting of Malays and the indigenous tribes who are considered the original inhabitants of Malaysia , over non @-@ bumiputera such as Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indians . These policies provide preferential treatment to bumiputera in employment , education , scholarships , business , and access to cheaper housing and assisted savings . However , it has generated greater interethnic resentment . There is ongoing debate over whether the laws and society of Malaysia should reflect secular or Islamic principles . Islamic criminal laws passed by the Pan @-@ Malaysian Islamic Party with the support of UMNO state assemblymen in the state legislative assembly of Kelantan have been blocked by the federal government on the basis that criminal laws are the responsibility of the federal government . 
 = = Foreign relations and military = = 
 A founding member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation ( OIC ) , the country participates in many international organisations such as the United Nations , the Asia @-@ Pacific Economic Cooperation , the Developing 8 Countries , and the Non @-@ Aligned Movement ( NAM ) . It has chaired ASEAN , the OIC , and the NAM in the past . A former British colony , it is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations . Kuala Lumpur was the site of the first East Asia Summit in 2005 . 
 Malaysia 's foreign policy is officially based on the principle of neutrality and maintaining peaceful relations with all countries , regardless of their political system . The government attaches a high priority to the security and stability of Southeast Asia , and seeks to further develop relations with other countries in the region . Historically the government has tried to portray Malaysia as a progressive Islamic nation while strengthening relations with other Islamic states . A strong tenet of Malaysia 's policy is national sovereignty and the right of a country to control its domestic affairs . 
 The policy towards territorial disputes by the government is one of pragmatism , with the government solving disputes in a number of ways , such as bringing the case to the International Court of Justice . The Spratly Islands are disputed by many states in the area , and a large portion of the South China Sea is claimed by China . Unlike its neighbours of Vietnam and the Philippines , Malaysia historically avoided conflicts with China . However , after the <unk> of Chinese ships in Malaysian territorial waters , Malaysia has become active in condemning China . Brunei and Malaysia in 2009 announced an end to claims of each other 's land , and committed to resolve issues related to their maritime borders . The Philippines has a dormant claim to the eastern part of Sabah . Singapore 's land reclamation has caused tensions , and minor maritime and land border disputes exist with Indonesia . 
 Malaysia has never recognised Israel and has no diplomatic ties with it , and has called for the International Criminal Court to take action against Israel over their Gaza flotilla raid . Malaysia has stated it will only establish an official relations with Israel once a peace agreement with the State of Palestine been reached and called for both parties to find a quick resolution . Malaysian peacekeeping forces have contributed to many UN peacekeeping missions , such as in Congo , Iran – Iraq , Namibia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Somalia , East Timor and Lebanon . 
 The Malaysian Armed Forces have three branches , the Royal Malaysian Navy , the Malaysian Army , and the Royal Malaysian Air Force . There is no conscription , and the required age for voluntary military service is 18 . The military uses 1 @.@ 5 % of the country 's GDP , and employs 1 @.@ 23 % of Malaysia 's manpower . 
 The Five Power Defence Arrangements is a regional security initiative which has been in place for almost 40 years . It involves joint military exercises held among Malaysia , Singapore , Australia , New Zealand , and the United Kingdom . Joint exercises and war games also been held with Brunei , China , Indonesia and the United States . Malaysia , Philippines , Thailand and Vietnam have agreed to host joint security force exercises to secure their maritime border and tackle issues such as illegal immigration , piracy and smuggling . There are fears that extremist militants activities in the Muslim areas of the southern Philippines and southern Thailand would spill over into Malaysia . 
 = = Subdivisions = = 
 Malaysia is a federation of 13 states and three federal territories . These are divided between two regions , with 11 states and two federal territories on Peninsular Malaysia and the other two states and one federal territory in East Malaysia . Each state is divided into districts , which are then divided into mukim . In Sabah and Sarawak districts are grouped into divisions . 
 Governance of the states is divided between the federal and the state governments , with different powers reserved for each , and the Federal government has direct administration of the federal territories . Lower @-@ level administration is carried out by local authorities , which include city councils , district councils , and municipal councils , although autonomous statutory bodies can be created by the federal and state governments to deal with certain tasks . The federal constitution puts local authorities outside of the federal territories under the exclusive jurisdictions of the state government , although in practice the federal government has intervened in the affairs of state local governments . There are 144 local authorities , consisting of 11 city councils , 33 municipal councils , and 97 district councils . 
 The 13 states are based on historical Malay kingdoms , and 9 of the 11 Peninsular states , known as the Malay states , retain their royal families . The King is elected by and from the nine rulers to serve a five @-@ year term . This King appoints governors serving a four @-@ year term for the states without monarchies , after consultations with the chief minister of that state . Each state has a unicameral legislature known as the State Legislative Assembly , and its own written constitution . Sabah and Sarawak have considerably more autonomy than the other states , most notably having separate immigration policies and controls , and a unique residency status . Federal intervention in state affairs , lack of development , and disputes over oil royalties have occasionally led to statements about secession from leaders in several states such as Johor , Kelantan , Sabah and Sarawak , although these have not been followed up and no serious independence movements exist . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Malaysia is the 66th largest country by total land area , with a land area of 329 @,@ 613 km2 ( 127 @,@ 264 sq mi ) . It has land borders with Thailand in West Malaysia , and Indonesia and Brunei in East Malaysia . It is linked to Singapore by a narrow causeway and a bridge . The country also has maritime boundaries with Vietnam and the Philippines . The land borders are defined in large part by geological features such as the Perlis River , the <unk> River and the <unk> Canal , whilst some of the maritime boundaries are the subject of ongoing contention . Brunei forms what is almost an enclave in Malaysia , with the state of Sarawak dividing it into two parts . Malaysia is the only country with territory on both the Asian mainland and the Malay archipelago . Tanjung <unk> , located in the southern state of Johor , is the southernmost tip of continental Asia . The Strait of Malacca , lying between Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia , is one of the most important thoroughfares in global commerce , carrying 40 per cent of the world 's trade . 
 The two parts of Malaysia , separated from each other by the South China Sea , share a largely similar landscape in that both Peninsular and East Malaysia feature coastal plains rising to hills and mountains . Peninsular Malaysia , containing 40 per cent of Malaysia 's land area , extends 740 km ( 460 mi ) from north to south , and its maximum width is 322 km ( 200 mi ) . It is divided between its east and west coasts by the Titiwangsa Mountains , rising to a peak elevation of 2 @,@ 183 metres ( 7 @,@ 162 ft ) at Mount <unk> , part of a series of mountain ranges running down the centre of the peninsula . These mountains are heavily forested , and mainly composed of granite and other igneous rocks . Much of it has been eroded , creating a karst landscape . The range is the origin of some of Peninsular Malaysia 's river systems . The coastal plains surrounding the peninsula reach a maximum width of 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) , and the peninsula 's coastline is nearly 1 @,@ 931 km ( 1 @,@ 200 mi ) long , although harbours are only available on the western side . 
 East Malaysia , on the island of Borneo , has a coastline of 2 @,@ 607 km ( 1 @,@ 620 mi ) . It is divided between coastal regions , hills and valleys , and a mountainous interior . The Crocker Range extends northwards from Sarawak , dividing the state of Sabah . It is the location of the 4 @,@ 095 m ( 13 @,@ 435 ft ) high Mount Kinabalu , the tallest mountain in Malaysia . Mount Kinabalu is located in the Kinabalu National Park , which is protected as one of the four UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Malaysia . The highest mountain ranges form the border between Malaysia and Indonesia . Sarawak contains the Mulu Caves , the largest cave system in the world , in the Gunung Mulu National Park which is also a World Heritage Site . 
 Around these two halves of Malaysia are numerous islands , the largest of which is <unk> . The local climate is equatorial and characterised by the annual southwest ( April to October ) and northeast ( October to February ) monsoons . The temperature is moderated by the presence of the surrounding oceans . Humidity is usually high , and the average annual rainfall is 250 cm ( 98 in ) . The climates of the Peninsula and the East differ , as the climate on the peninsula is directly affected by wind from the mainland , as opposed to the more maritime weather of the East . Local climates can be divided into three regions , highland , lowland , and coastal . Climate change is likely to affect sea levels and rainfall , increasing flood risks and leading to droughts . 
 = = Biodiversity = = 
 Malaysia signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 12 June 1993 , and became a party to the convention on 24 June 1994 . It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan , which was received by the convention on 16 April 1998 . The country is megadiverse with a high number of species and high levels of endemism . It is estimated to contain 20 per cent of the world 's animal species . High levels of endemism are found on the diverse forests of Borneo 's mountains , as species are isolated from each other by lowland forest . There are about 210 mammal species in the country . Over 620 species of birds have been recorded in Peninsular Malaysia , with many endemic to the mountains there . A high number of endemic bird species are also found in Malaysian Borneo . 250 reptile species have been recorded in the country , with about 150 species of snakes and 80 species of lizards . There are about 150 species of frogs , and thousands of insect species . Malaysia 's exclusive economic zone is 1 @.@ 5 times larger than its land area , and some of its waters are in the Coral Triangle , a biodiversity hotspot . The waters around Sipadan island are the most biodiverse in the world . Bordering East Malaysia , the Sulu Sea is a biodiversity hotspot , with around 600 coral species and 1200 fish species . The unique biodiversity of Malaysian Caves always attracts lovers of ecotourism from all over the world . 
 Nearly 4 @,@ 000 species of fungi , including lichen @-@ forming species have been recorded from Malaysia . Of the two fungal groups with the largest number of species in Malaysia , the Ascomycota and their asexual states have been surveyed in some habitats ( decaying wood , marine and freshwater ecosystems , as parasites of some plants , and as agents of biodegradation ) , but have not been or have been only poorly surveyed in other habitats ( as <unk> , in soils , on dung , as human and animal pathogens ) ; the Basidiomycota are only partly surveyed : bracket fungi , and mushrooms and toadstools have been studied , but Malaysian rust and smut fungi remain very poorly known . Without doubt , many more fungal species in Malaysia have not yet been recorded , and it is likely that many of those , when found , will be new to science . 
 About two thirds of Malaysia is covered in forest , with some forests believed to be 130 million years old . The forests are dominated by <unk> . Lowland forest covers areas below 760 m ( 2 @,@ 490 ft ) , and formerly East Malaysia was covered in such rainforest , which is supported by its hot wet climate . There are around 14 @,@ 500 species of flowering plants and trees . Besides rainforests , there are over 1 @,@ 425 km2 ( 550 sq mi ) of mangroves in Malaysia , and a large amount of peat forest . At higher altitudes , oaks , chestnuts , and rhododendrons replace <unk> . There are an estimated 8 @,@ 500 species of vascular plants in Peninsular Malaysia , with another 15 @,@ 000 in the East . The forests of East Malaysia are estimated to be the habitat of around 2 @,@ 000 tree species , and are one of the most biodiverse areas in the world , with 240 different species of trees every hectare . These forests host many members of the Rafflesia genus , the largest flowers in the world , with a maximum diameter of 1 m ( 3 ft 3 in ) . 
 = = = Conservation issues = = = 
 Logging , along with cultivation practices has devastated tree cover , causing severe environmental degradation in the country . Over 80 per cent of Sarawak 's rainforest has been cleared . Floods in East Malaysia have been worsened by the loss of trees , and over 60 per cent of the Peninsular 's forest have been cleared . With current rates of deforestation , the forests are predicted to be extinct by 2020 . Deforestation is a major problem for animals , fungi and plants , as the forest is cut to make room for plantations . Most remaining forest is found inside national parks . Habitat destruction has proved a threat for marine life . Illegal fishing is another major threat , with fishing methods such as dynamite fishing and poisoning depleting marine ecosystems . Leatherback turtle numbers have dropped 98 per cent since the 1950s . Hunting has also been an issue for some animals , with overconsumption and the use of animal parts for profit endangering many animals , from marine life to tigers . Marine life is also detrimentally affected by uncontrolled tourism . 
 The Malaysian government aims to balance economic growth with environmental protection , but has been accused of favouring big business over the environment . Some state governments are now trying to counter the environmental impact and pollution created by deforestation ; and the federal government is trying to cut logging by 10 per cent each year . 28 national parks have been established ; 23 in East Malaysia and five in the Peninsular . Tourism has been limited in biodiverse areas such as Sipadan island . Animal trafficking is a large issue , and the Malaysian government is holding talks with the governments of Brunei and Indonesia to standardise anti @-@ trafficking laws . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Malaysia is a relatively open state @-@ oriented and newly industrialised market economy . The state plays a significant but declining role in guiding economic activity through macroeconomic plans . Malaysia has had one of the best economic records in Asia , with GDP growing an average 6 @.@ 5 per cent annually from 1957 to 2005 . Malaysia 's economy in 2014 – 2015 was one of the most competitive in Asia , ranking 6th in Asia and 20th in the world , higher than countries like Australia , France and South Korea . In 2014 , Malaysia 's economy grew 6 % , the second highest growth in ASEAN behind Philippines ' growth of 6 @.@ 1 % . The economy of Malaysia ( GDP PPP ) in 2014 was $ 746 @.@ 821 billion , the third largest in ASEAN behind more populous Indonesia and Thailand and the 28th largest in the world . 
 In 1991 , former Prime Minister of Malaysia , Mahathir Mohamad outlined his ideal in Vision 2020 , in which Malaysia would become a self @-@ sufficient industrialised nation by 2020 . Najib Razak has said Malaysia could attain developed country status much earlier from the actual target in 2020 , adding the country has two program concept such as Government Transformation Programme and the Economic Transformation Programme . 
 According to a HSBC report , Malaysia will become the world 's 21st largest economy by 2050 , with a GDP of $ 1 @.@ 2 trillion ( Year 2000 dollars ) and a GDP per capita of $ 29 @,@ 247 ( Year 2000 dollars ) . The report also says " The electronic equipment , petroleum , and liquefied natural gas producer will see a substantial increase in income per capita . Malaysian life expectancy , relatively high level of schooling , and above average fertility rate will help in its rapid expansion " . Viktor Shvets , the managing director of Credit Suisse , has said " Malaysia has all the right ingredients to become a developed nation " . 
 In the 1970s , the predominantly mining and agricultural @-@ based economy began a transition towards a more multi @-@ sector economy . Since the 1980s , the industrial sector , with a high level of investment , has led the country 's growth . The economy recovered from the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis earlier than neighbouring countries did , and has since recovered to the levels of the pre @-@ crisis era with a GDP per capita of $ 14 @,@ 800 . Economic inequalities exist between different ethnic groups . The Chinese make up about one @-@ quarter of the population , but accounts for 70 per cent of the country 's market capitalisation . Chinese businesses in Malaysia are part of the larger bamboo network , a network of overseas Chinese businesses in the Southeast Asian market sharing common family and cultural ties . 
 International trade , facilitated by the shipping route in adjacent Strait of Malacca , and manufacturing are the key sectors . Malaysia is an exporter of natural and agricultural resources , and petroleum is a major export . Malaysia has once been the largest producer of tin , rubber and palm oil in the world . Manufacturing has a large influence in the country 's economy , although Malaysia 's economic structure has been moving away from it . Malaysia remains one of the world 's largest producers of palm oil . 
 In an effort to diversify the economy and make it less dependent on export goods , the government has pushed to increase tourism to Malaysia . As a result , tourism has become Malaysia 's third largest source of foreign exchange , although it is threatened by the negative effects of the growing industrial economy , with large amounts of air and water pollution along with deforestation affecting tourism . The tourism sector came under some pressure in 2014 when the national carrier Malaysia Airlines had one of its planes disappear in March , while another was brought down by a missile over Ukraine in July , resulting in the loss of a total 537 passengers and crew . The state of the airline , which had been unprofitable for 3 years , prompted the government in August 2014 to nationalise the airline by buying up the 30 per cent it did not already own . Between 2013 and 2014 , Malaysia has been listed as one of the best places to retire in the world too , with the country in third position on the Global Retirement Index . This in part was the result of the Malaysia My Second Home programme to allow foreigners to live in the country on a long @-@ stay visa for up to 10 years . In 2015 , Malaysia ranked in fourth position on The World 's Best Retirement Havens while getting in the first place as the best place in Asia to retire . Warm climate with British colonial background made foreigners easy to interact with the locals . 
 The country has developed into a centre of Islamic banking , and is the country with the highest numbers of female workers in that industry . Knowledge @-@ based services are also expanding . To create a self @-@ reliant defensive ability and support national development , Malaysia privatised some of its military facilities in the 1970s . The privatisation has created defence industry , which in 1999 was brought under the Malaysia Defence Industry Council . The government continues to promote this sector and its competitiveness , actively marketing the defence industry . 
 Science policies in Malaysia are regulated by the Ministry of Science , Technology , and Innovation . The country is one of the world 's largest exporters of semiconductor devices , electrical devices , and IT and communication products . Malaysia began developing its own space programme in 2002 , and in 2006 , Russia agreed to transport one Malaysian to the International Space Station as part of a multibillion @-@ dollar purchase of 18 Russian Sukhoi Su @-@ <unk> fighter jets by the Royal Malaysian Air Force . The government has invested in building satellites in through the <unk> programme . 
 = = = Infrastructure = = = 
 The overall infrastructure of Malaysia is one of the most developed in Asia and ranked 8th in Asia and 25th in the world . Malaysia is ranked 19th in the world for its quality roads , quality of port infrastructure and quality of air transport infrastructure but ranked 39th in quality of electricity supply . Its telecommunications network is second only to Singapore 's in Southeast Asia , with 4 @.@ 7 million fixed @-@ line subscribers and more than 30 million cellular subscribers . The country has seven international ports , the major one being the Port Klang . There are 200 industrial parks along with specialised parks such as Technology Park Malaysia and <unk> Hi @-@ Tech Park . Fresh water is available to over 95 per cent of the population . During the colonial period , development was mainly concentrated in economically powerful cities and in areas forming security concerns . Although rural areas have been the focus of great development , they still lag behind areas such as the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia . The telecommunication network , although strong in urban areas , is less available to the rural population . 
 = = = = Energy = = = = 
 Malaysia 's energy infrastructure sector is largely dominated by <unk> Nasional , the largest electric utility company in Southeast Asia , with over <unk> billion of assets . Customers are connected to electricity through the National Grid , with more than 420 transmission substations in the Peninsular linked together by approximately 11 @,@ 000 km of transmission lines operating at 132 , 275 and 500 kilovolts . In 2013 , Malaysia 's total power generation capacity was over 29 @,@ 728 megawatts . Total electricity generation was 140 @,@ 985 @.@ 01 GWh and total electricity consumption was 116 @,@ 087 @.@ 51 GWh . Energy production in Malaysia is largely based on oil and natural gas , owing to Malaysia 's oil reserves and natural gas reserves , which is the fourth largest in Asia @-@ Pacific after China , India and Vietnam . 
 = = = = Transportation = = = = 
 Malaysia 's road network is one of the most comprehensive in Asia and covers a total of 144 @,@ 403 kilometres ( 89 @,@ 728 mi ) . The main national road network is the Malaysian Federal Roads System , which span over 49 @,@ 935 km ( 31 @,@ 028 mi ) . Most of the federal roads in Malaysia are 2 @-@ lane roads . In town areas , federal roads may become 4 @-@ lane roads to increase traffic capacity . Nearly all federal roads are paved with tarmac except parts of the Skudai – Pontian Highway which is paved with concrete , while parts of the Federal Highway linking Klang to Kuala Lumpur , is paved with asphalt . Malaysia has over 1 @,@ 798 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 117 mi ) of highways and the longest highway , the North – South Expressway , extends over 800 kilometres ( 497 mi ) on the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia , connecting major urban centres like Kuala Lumpur , Penang and Johor Bahru . In 2015 , the government announced a <unk> billion ( US $ 8 @.@ 23 billion ) Pan @-@ Borneo Highway project to upgrade all trunk roads to dual carriage expressways , bringing the standard of East Malaysian highways to the same level of quality of Peninsular highways . 
 There is currently 1 @,@ 833 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 139 mi ) of railways in Malaysia , 767 km ( 477 mi ) are double tracked and electrified . Rail transport in Malaysia comprises heavy rail ( KTM ) , light rapid transit and monorail ( Rapid Rail ) , and a funicular railway line ( Penang Hill Railway ) . Heavy rail is mostly used for intercity passenger and freight transport as well as some urban public transport , while <unk> are used for intra @-@ city urban public transport . There two commuter rail services linking Kuala Lumpur with the Kuala Lumpur International Airport . The sole monorail line in the country is also used for public transport in Kuala Lumpur , while the only funicular railway line is in Penang . A rapid transit project , the <unk> , is currently under construction to improve Kuala Lumpur 's public transport system . The railway network covers most of the 11 states in Peninsular Malaysia . In East Malaysia , only the state of Sabah has railways . The network is also connected to the Thai railway 1 @,@ 000 mm ( 3 ft 3 3 ⁄ 8 in ) network in the north . If the Burma Railway is rebuilt , services to Myanmar , India , and China could be initiated . 
 Malaysia has 118 airports , of which 38 are paved . The national airline is Malaysia Airlines , providing international and domestic air services . Major international routes and domestic routes crossing between West Malaysia and East Malaysia are served by Malaysia Airlines , AirAsia and Malindo Air while smaller domestic routes are supplemented by smaller airlines like MASwings , Firefly and Berjaya Air . Major cargo airlines include MASkargo and <unk> Air Services . Kuala Lumpur International Airport is the main and busiest airport of Malaysia . In 2014 , it was the world 's 13th busiest airport by international passenger traffic , recording over 25 @.@ 4 million international passenger traffic . It was also the world 's 20th busiest airport by passenger traffic , recording over 48 @.@ 9 million passengers . Other major airports include Kota Kinabalu International Airport , which is also Malaysia 's second busiest airport and busiest airport in East Malaysia with over 6 @.@ 9 million passengers in 2013 , and Penang International Airport , which serves Malaysia 's second largest urban area , with over 5 @.@ 4 million passengers in 2013 . 
 Malaysia is strategically located on the Strait of Malacca , one of the most important shipping lanes in the world . Malaysia has two ports that are listed in the top 20 busiest ports in the world , Port Klang and Port of Tanjung Pelepas , which are respectively the 2nd and 3rd busiest ports in Southeast Asia after the Port of Singapore . Port Klang is Malaysia 's busiest port , and the 13th busiest port in the world in 2013 , handling over 10 @.@ 3 million TEUs . Port of Tanjung Pelepas is Malaysia 's second busiest port , and the 19th busiest port in the world in 2013 , handling over 7 @.@ 6 million TEUs . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 As of the 2010 census , the population of Malaysia was 28 @,@ 334 @,@ 135 , making it the 42nd most populated country . 91 @.@ 8 per cent of the population are Malaysian citizens . Malaysian citizens are divided along ethnic lines , with 67 @.@ 4 per cent considered bumiputera The largest group of bumiputera are Malays , who are defined in the constitution as Muslims who practice Malay customs and culture . They play a dominant role politically . Bumiputera status is also accorded to certain non @-@ Malay indigenous peoples , including ethnic Thais , Khmers , Chams and the natives of Sabah and Sarawak . Non @-@ Malay bumiputera make up more than half of Sarawak 's population and over two thirds of Sabah 's population . There also exist aboriginal groups in much smaller numbers on the peninsula , where they are collectively known as the Orang Asli . Laws over who gets bumiputera status vary between states . 
 Other minorities lack bumiputera status . 24 @.@ 6 per cent of the population are of Chinese descent , while those of Indian descent comprise 7 @.@ 3 per cent of the population . The Chinese have historically been dominant in the business and commerce community , and form a plurality of the population of Penang . Immigrants from India , the majority of them Tamils , began arriving in Malaysia early in the 19th century . Malaysian citizenship is not automatically granted to those born in Malaysia , but is granted to a child born of two Malaysian parents outside Malaysia . Dual citizenship is not permitted . Citizenship in the states of Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysian Borneo are distinct from citizenship in Peninsular Malaysia for immigration purposes . Every citizen is issued a biometric smart chip identity card known as <unk> at the age of 12 , and must carry the card at all times . 
 The education system features a non @-@ compulsory kindergarten education followed by six years of compulsory primary education , and five years of optional secondary education . Schools in the primary education system are divided into two categories : national primary schools , which teach in Malay , and vernacular schools , which teach in Chinese or Tamil . Secondary education is conducted for five years . In the final year of secondary education , students sit for the Malaysian Certificate of Education examination . Since the introduction of the matriculation programme in 1999 , students who completed the 12 @-@ month programme in matriculation colleges can enroll in local universities .
