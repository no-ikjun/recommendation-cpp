 = Design 1047 battlecruiser = 
 Design 1047 , also known as Project 1047 , was a series of plans for a class of Dutch battlecruisers prior to the Second World War . The ships were intended to counter a perceived threat posed by Imperial Japanese aggression to the Dutch colonies in the East Indies . Dutch intelligence believed that the Imperial Japanese Navy would deploy its capital ships ( aircraft carriers and battleships ) against their counterparts of the United States Navy and the British Royal Navy , leaving heavy and light cruisers , along with seaplane carriers , as the largest ships available for an advance into the East Indies . As such , the 1047s were shaped by the need to be able to fight their way through a fleet composed of these ships and smaller destroyers . It was hoped that this capability would allow the battlecruisers to act as a fleet in being . 
 After a recommendation from high @-@ ranking Dutch naval officers that the Koninklijke Marine ( Royal Netherlands Navy ) be bolstered so any attacker would have to " use such a large part of his military potential that there would be an unacceptable weakening of his capabilities in other theaters " , the Minister of Defense ordered the Navy to prepare designs for a two or three @-@ member class of battlecruisers . As they had not previously designed a modern capital ship , and the only information available on modern designs came from public literature and editions of Jane 's Fighting Ships , the Dutch turned to Germany . This initially bore no results , as the two sides were unable to come to terms . During this time , a preliminary plan was drawn up without foreign assistance ; completed on 11 July 1939 , it was missing many of the post @-@ First World War advances in warship technology . In particular , the armor protection was totally outmoded . 
 Germany and the Netherlands were eventually able to reach an agreement where Germany would release plans and drawings based upon their ideas for a battlecruiser , in return for a guarantee that all needed equipment would be ordered from German firms . With their assistance ( mainly through NV <unk> voor <unk> ) , a rough design was formulated by February 1940 . A visit to Italy prompted a rethink of the internal layout , which led to a set of drawings dated 19 April 1940 . This is the last known design produced prior to Germany 's invasion and occupation of the Netherlands . Final plans for the ships were never completed , and the ships were never constructed . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 marked a period of increasing belligerence from the Japanese Empire , and as the decade progressed the Dutch grew concerned about the security of their East Indies colonies . The islands , which included Java , Sumatra , Borneo and part of New Guinea , were enormously important both politically and strategically to the Dutch , who had lived and traded there for more than three centuries . Over 500 @,@ 000 settlers had moved from the Netherlands to this " second homeland " , and the East Indies possessed abundant valuable resources , the most important of which were the rubber plantations and oilfields ; the islands were the fourth @-@ largest exporters of oil in the world , behind the United States , Iran , and Romania . 
 The Koninklijke Marine had only one seagoing armored ship stationed in the East Indies , the coastal @-@ defense ship HNLMS Soerabaja ( ex @-@ De Zeven <unk> ) . As this ship was considered to be " of little remaining combat value " , three light cruisers ( Java , Sumatra and De Ruyter ) , a few destroyers , and a large submarine fleet were charged with the main naval defense of the islands . 
 The Dutch believed that if war broke out , Japan 's capital ships would be preoccupied with the battleships of the United States Navy and the British Royal Navy , meaning that the defenses of the East Indies would need to cope only with Japan 's cruisers . However , the ships were more powerful than their Dutch equivalents and Japan would also have the advantage of numbers . It was estimated that by 1944 , should no new vessels be ordered , the five light cruisers of the Koninklijke Marine ( two of the Java class , which were laid down prior to the First World War , De Ruyter , and two of the Tromp class ) could be facing 18 heavy and 27 light Japanese cruisers . 
 These factors forced the Koninklijke Marine to bolster this force , and so the construction of three " super cruisers " capable of overpowering cruisers of the Imperial Japanese Navy was contemplated . The Washington Naval Treaty and London Naval Treaty limited new cruisers of their signatory nations to not more than a 10 @,@ 000 @-@ ton displacement and 8 @-@ inch ( 20 cm ) guns , but as a relatively minor naval power the Netherlands had not been party to the treaties and was not bound by their restrictions . According to Dutch naval intelligence , the Japanese cruisers did not participate in exercises with the main fleet of battleships and fleet carriers , instead operating with seaplane carriers , so it was assumed that the battlecruisers would not have to face overwhelming carrier @-@ based air strikes . Moreover , the presence of these powerful ships — whose larger guns could easily out @-@ range any escorting cruisers or destroyers — would give the Dutch a fleet in being in the East Indies that could delay or end plans for an amphibious assault for fear that the invasion would be disrupted or the attacking fleet destroyed . 
 = = Design = = 
 In 1938 , a number of high @-@ ranking naval officers within the Koninklijke Marine gathered to discuss possible improvements to the navy . They concluded that the Dutch should have a navy strong enough to force an enemy to " use such a large part of his military potential that there would be an unacceptable weakening of his capabilities in other theaters " . At this , and a note from the Chief of Naval Staff , the Minister of Defence <unk> van Dijk ordered the navy on 18 February 1939 to begin planning and estimating costs for two or possibly three battlecruisers . 
 Requirements for the new battlecruiser design were laid down by the navy a day before the order from van Dijk was made ; they included the ability to steam for 12 hours at 32 knots , an endurance of 4 @,@ 500 nautical miles at 20 knots , a maximum of fifteen minutes for the ship to go from 20 to 30 knots , protection for the engine room that would allow the ship to take hits in that area without being slowed , a draft not to exceed 9 meters , and capacity for six weeks ' worth of supplies . Desired weaponry was nine 280 mm guns in three triple turrets for the main armament , with each gun capable of firing independently , a dual @-@ purpose secondary armament of 120 mm guns in four twin mounts , and an anti @-@ aircraft battery of fourteen 40 mm guns in pairs with centralized fire control . Aircraft were to be two fighters and two reconnaissance aircraft . Specific values were given for each aspect of the design 's armor , which featured substantial anti @-@ torpedo and mine protection and a defense against 28 cm shells and 300 kg bombs . 
 = = = Preliminary designs = = = 
 With no prior experience in building such large ships — as 1913 plans for 24 @,@ 650 @-@ ton dreadnoughts were never brought to fruition due to the First World War — and no significant source of information on more modern vessels — the only material available being unclassified sources such as Jane 's Fighting Ships — the Dutch turned to foreign sources for technical assistance . 
 Although they hoped that the French would release plans for their Dunkerque class of ' fast battleships ' , they decided to focus their effort on Hitler 's Germany . Informal talks had already been held in Berlin on 24 – 25 April 1939 where the Dutch proposed that , in return for the complete plans for the Scharnhorst @-@ class battleship , they would order all of the necessary equipment for their construction program from Germany . 
 A draft design was completed without foreign assistance by the Construction Department on 11 July 1939 , but it did not reflect the numerous technical developments that had entered capital ship designs after the First World War . In particular , its armor scheme was utterly obsolete , as it lacked any substantial amount of deck armor or good underwater protection ; it came closer to the designs of 20 to 25 years previous than to that of a modern warship . 
 Despite German interest in the battlecruiser project , the two sides could not agree on terms . The German delegation insisted that orders placed in their country be guaranteed , with financial compensation to be paid to German companies if the Dutch did not construct the ships . They also refused to release a complete set of plans for the Scharnhorsts . Further complicating negotiations , the Dutch Cabinet , which would have to approve any deal , did not convene during the summer of 1939 . 
 While awaiting official approval , Dutch planning went ahead . A contract with Ferrostaal A.G. Essen was drawn up , and on 15 May 1939 a list of products for purchase in Germany was submitted . Two months later , talks were held in Bremen and Berlin ( on 13 and 31 July , respectively ) in which the Germans agreed to release plans and drawings that , although not specifically of the Scharnhorst @-@ class , would reveal their ideas on battlecruiser design . Delivered on 21 August of that year , these showed various modern protection schemes that could be used in the new battlecruisers . On 4 October 1939 , a German admiral previously appointed as a liaison between the two navies asserted that while Germany could not guarantee punctual delivery dates , it could assure the Netherlands that it would pressure the companies to meet the contractual dates and that the Kriegsmarine would not interfere with orders from the same companies . A month later , Ferrostaal A.G. Essen was formally appointed as the Dutch proxy in most of their dealings with Germany ; this appointment did not include Krupp Germaniawerft . 
 Work on armament for the new designs was contracted to Krupp Germaniawerft ; the Dutch met with the company on 31 July 1939 and supplied the characteristics for the main and secondary armament . Turret armor , main armament depression and elevation ( 10 – 45 ° , obtained through the use of hydraulics ) , and the muzzle velocity for the guns ( 850 – 900 m / s ( 2 @,@ 800 – 3 @,@ 000 ft / s ) ) were all specified . Requirements for the secondary armament included a maximum depression of 10 ° , a maximum elevation of 80 ° , and approximate armor values for their mounts ( 80 mm front , 150 mm roof , 50 mm sides ) . The fire control arrangement was discussed on 6 November 1939 with the Dutch company NV Hazemeyer <unk> <unk> . 
 By this time the propulsion plant , which was to be built in the Netherlands , was taking shape . Requirements sent out in August 1939 mandated that the ships have eight boiler rooms , four sets of geared turbines , and 180 @,@ 000 shp . After further improvements , <unk> and two German firms ( Krupp Germaniawerft was responsible for the turbines and Deschimag for the boilers ) began sketching preliminary plans . These were then incorporated into two different design studies , one by <unk> and the other by NV <unk> voor <unk> ( IvS ) . IvS was purportedly a Dutch company linking Dutch and German designers , but in reality functioned as a front company for German interests . Their design was probably based upon a set of plans drawn up by the Ship Construction Office of the German Navy and received in the Netherlands on 31 August . It did not give the propulsion machinery enough space , and it was thought that this design did not provide enough room for magazines . Nevertheless , it was taken into discussions with the Dutch , where the 11 July design was merged with it . IvS came out with one further plan on 11 March 1940 , the merits of which were discussed with the Dutch in April of that year . 
 = = = Design studies = = = 
 In December 1939 the two studies produced their design proposals ; both were capable of 180 @,@ 000 shp and both had similar boiler capabilities , but the Dutch design was 199 m2 ( 2 @,@ 140 sq ft ) larger than the German . Although it had the advantage of smaller size , the Dutch were concerned that the German design 's power plant might not be capable of operating without problems ( the Kriegsmarine did indeed face plant problems during the war ) . However , questions about reliability soon became moot ; it was originally believed that around 84 m ( 276 ft ) of the ship 's length would be required for its propulsion plant , but it was discovered that no more than 72 @.@ 8 m ( 239 ft ) could be spared if the ship 's ammunition was to be behind armor — and the German design needed 74 m ( 243 ft ) , while the Dutch design needed 78 m ( 256 ft ) . 
 December also saw real doubts start to creep over the project , as a new Navy Minister had been appointed , and he believed that the Dutch would be better off acquiring a modern version of the old armored cruiser type . Basic characteristics were drawn up for a 29 kn ( 33 mph ; 54 km / h ) , 16 @,@ 000 long tons ( 16 @,@ 257 t ; 17 @,@ 920 short tons ) standard ship that had nine 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns , a 175 mm ( 6 @.@ 9 in ) belt and a 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) deck . Even though these vessels would have been superior to any 20 cm ( 8 in ) <unk> , 10 @,@ 000 long tons ( 10 @,@ 000 t ; 11 @,@ 000 short tons ) treaty cruiser , it was felt that too many compromises would be necessary . The belt and deck armor were judged inadequate , but to achieve the same protection as the battlecruiser design would mean no armament could be fitted . The smaller design also did not feature the speed advantage over opponents that the battlecruisers had . For these reasons the Navy " strongly recommended against the construction of such a ship " , and the proposal was abandoned . 
 The plan for three battlecruisers was authorized in February 1940 ; they , along with two light cruisers of the Eendracht class , would be responsible for the main sea defense of the East Indies . The new light cruisers would replace the older Java class , which would then assume the role of gunnery training ships from grossly obsolete ships such as the protected cruiser De Gelderland , which had been laid down more than forty years prior on 28 September 1898 . The authorization of large battlecruisers meant that a new 40 @,@ 000 @-@ ton floating dock would be built and many improvements to their planned base in the East Indies , the naval yard in <unk> , would begin . To handle the construction of such a ship , a new 250 m ( 820 ft ) building way was begun by the Netherlands Construction Company , Ltd .. 
 Germany 's refusal to give the Dutch access to plans detailing the design of the Scharnhorsts below the waterline was a major problem . Inexperienced in designing an underwater protection scheme for a ship of this size , the Dutch were forced to turn to Italy for assistance , which allowed a delegation of engineers and naval officers to enter the country in February 1940 . Although the Dutch delegation was barred from viewing technical drawings or the battleship Roma , then under construction , possibly to ensure that the details of their Pugliese system remained a secret , they were allowed to visit Vittorio Veneto , toured several shipyards , interviewed the Chief Constructor of the Italian Navy , and received additional information on the Scharnhorsts , the Italians — Germany 's ally — knowing some details of the ships . 
 Although the issues the Dutch designers were having with a propulsion system were discussed , the delegation came away from Italy entirely uninspired by the Italians ' efforts in that area . On the other hand , the visit provoked a drastic reworking of the internal subdivision of the proposed battlecruisers . The designers got rid of the previously required central longitudinal bulkhead and attempted to raise the double bottom to provide greater protection against magnetic torpedoes . However , due to the requirement for a shallow draft , this modification had to be abandoned . 
 = = = Last design = = = 
 When another delegation was sent to Germany to discuss the problems with the battlecruisers , the Dutch took their evolving design with them . Dated 19 April 1940 , this was the final version prior to the invasion of the Netherlands by Germany ; Design 1047 was never fully completed . The normal load displacement was now planned to be around 28 @,@ 482 tonnes ( 28 @,@ 032 long tons ) . Although the propulsion was not yet finalized , the requirements had been re @-@ examined in March 1940 to ascertain if 160 @,@ 000 shp would be enough , taking into account that a plant that would produce 180 @,@ 000 shp in tropical water would in northern regions produce ca . 200 @,@ 000 shp — warmer waters adversely affect a steam turbine 's efficiency . The updated requirements also called for eight Yarrow boilers fitted in four boiler rooms , and four Parsons geared turbines in two engine rooms , to drive four propellers at either 40 @,@ 000 or 45 @,@ 000 shp each ( 40 @,@ 000 in tropic water conditions , 45 @,@ 000 in North Sea conditions ) . Length requirements for the machinery had also been altered , once in early March and again on 20 April 1940 ; a total length of 79 @.@ 5 meters was now called for . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The table of characteristics provided by Lt. <unk> S. Noot for the 19 April 1940 design does not give any armament specifics , as these likely remained unaltered from the earlier 16 February 1940 drawing . This drawing provided the following : a main armament of nine 283 mm guns , a secondary armament of twelve 120 mm dual purpose guns , and an anti @-@ aircraft defense consisting of fourteen Bofors 40 mm guns and eight Oerlikon 20 mm cannons . 
 Work on the main armament was contracted to Krupp Germaniawerft , which based its designs for the turrets , mountings , and guns of the 1047s on the 28 cm SK C / 34 used on the Scharnhorst class . With a 315 kg ( 694 lb ) APC shell , the guns would have had a muzzle velocity of 900 m / s ( 2 @,@ 950 ft / s ) and a maximum range of 42 @,@ 600 meters ( 46 @,@ 600 yards ) ; 120 rounds of ammunition would have been stowed for each gun , and the rate of fire would have been about 2 @.@ 5 rounds per minute . The guns would have been able to be elevated to a maximum angle of 45 ° and trained to 150 ° , while the loading angle would have been about 2 ° . 
 Secondary armament was planned to be twelve Bofors 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) guns in dual mounts . It is unclear whether or not these were an older version of the gun ( which had been mounted as the main armament on Dutch destroyers since the 1920s ) or an entirely new version . However , the debate is academic as the new guns were developed in the 1940s during the chaos of the Second World War and were unavailable for warships until after the war 's end . Detailed specifics such as range or rate of fire are also unknown ; had the older gun been used it would in any case have been updated ( including the use of dual instead of single half @-@ shield mounts ) , and the more modern version did not see service until 1950 , by which time it incorporated improvements from lessons learned during the war . 
 Arguably the best light anti @-@ aircraft gun of the Second World War , the 40 mm Bofors was used for air defense both on land and at sea by many of the countries involved , including the Americans , British , Dutch , Japanese , and Swedish . Produced in the early 1930s , it first entered service with the Royal Netherlands Navy when the cruisers Java and Sumatra were refitted in 1934 – 35 . Before the Second World War , Hazemeyer , a Dutch subsidiary of the German company Siemens & Halske , had devised " a very advanced triaxial mounting together with a <unk> control system " for the 40 mm gun . When the Netherlands fell in 1940 , this was brought to the U.K. aboard the minesweeper Willem van der <unk> , where it was copied and put into service as the British Mark IV twin mount . The description of the proposed fire control mechanism for the 1047s , discussed on 6 November 1939 , mentions that the 40 mm weapons were " to be controlled autonomously from the gun positions " ; this seems to describe Hazemeyer 's system , but no direct link is made in sources . 
 The Dutch Navy had already acquired a quantity of the Hispano Suiza 20mm guns before the war for mounting in torpedo boats and other craft and 6 of these were mounted in the cruiser Jacob van Heemskerck when she made her escape to Britain in 1940 . The Hispano fired similar 20 × 110 ammunition to the Oerlikon but had a higher rate of fire and slightly higher muzzle velocity . The Hispano Suiza however was to prove insufficiently durable for shipboard use and would find its niche as a highly successful aircraft gun . 
 = = = Differences from the Scharnhorst class = = = 
 Despite their superficially similar appearance , there were many differences between the Scharnhorst class and the final incarnation of the Dutch design . The 1047 was inferior in its armor protection , but in other respects was far superior : the main guns could be elevated 5 ° higher , the anti @-@ torpedo system was thicker , the deck protection better accommodated the ship boilers , and the design did not make use of the problematic German power plant . In addition , the 1047s ' anti @-@ aircraft armament was far superior to the Scharnhorst class . The use of twelve 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) dual purpose guns — able to function in both anti @-@ surface and anti @-@ aircraft roles — as opposed to the German division between 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) anti @-@ surface guns and 105 mm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) anti @-@ aircraft guns , was a more effective solution , as it saved needed space and weight on the ships in addition to simplifying logistics by requiring just one size of secondary ammunition . 
 = = Fate = = 
 With the outbreak of the Second World War , almost all design work was halted , although work on turrets and gunnery arrangements by Krupp Germaniawerft 's designers continued until the German invasion of the Netherlands in May . The first 1047 @-@ class ship was scheduled to be completed in 1944 , so would in any case have been too late to stop the Japanese advance into the Dutch East Indies . Due to the war , final plans for the ships were never completed , and the ships were never constructed . 
 = Edward Burne @-@ Jones = 
 Sir Edward Coley Burne @-@ Jones , 1st Baronet ARA ( 28 August 1833 – 17 June 1898 ) was a British artist and designer closely associated with the later phase of the Pre @-@ Raphaelite movement , who worked closely with William Morris on a wide range of decorative arts as a founding partner in Morris , Marshall , Faulkner & Co . Burne @-@ Jones was closely involved in the rejuvenation of the tradition of stained glass art in Britain ; his stained glass works include the windows of St. Philip 's Cathedral , Birmingham , St Martin in the Bull Ring , Birmingham , Holy Trinity Church , Sloane Square , Chelsea , St Martin 's Church in Brampton , Cumbria ( the church designed by Philip Webb ) , St Michael 's Church , Brighton , All Saints , Jesus Lane , Cambridge , Christ Church , Oxford and in St. Anne 's Church , Brown Edge , Staffordshire Moorlands . Burne @-@ Jones 's early paintings show the heavy inspiration of Dante Gabriel Rossetti , but by the 1860s Burne @-@ Jones was discovering his own artistic " voice " . In 1877 , he was persuaded to show eight oil paintings at the Grosvenor Gallery ( a new rival to the Royal Academy ) . These included The Beguiling of Merlin . The timing was right , and he was taken up as a herald and star of the new Aesthetic Movement . 
 In addition to painting and stained glass , Burne @-@ Jones worked in a variety of crafts ; including designing ceramic tiles , jewellery , tapestries , mosaics and book illustration , most famously designing woodcuts for the Kelmscott Press 's Chaucer in 1896 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Edward Coley Burne Jones ( the hyphen came later ) was born in Birmingham , the son of a Welshman , Edward Richard Jones , a frame @-@ maker at Bennetts Hill , where a blue plaque commemorates the painter 's childhood . His mother Elizabeth Coley Jones died within six days of his birth , and he was raised by his grieving father and the family housekeeper , Ann Sampson , an obsessively affectionate but humourless and <unk> local girl . He attended Birmingham 's King Edward VI grammar school from 1844 and the Birmingham School of Art from 1848 to 1852 , before studying theology at Exeter College , Oxford . At Oxford he became a friend of William Morris as a consequence of a mutual interest in poetry . The two Exeter undergraduates , together with a small group of Jones ' friends from Birmingham known as the Birmingham Set , speedily formed a very close and intimate society , which they called " The Brotherhood " . The members of the Brotherhood read John Ruskin and Tennyson , visited churches , and worshipped the Middle Ages . At this time Burne @-@ Jones discovered Thomas Malory 's Le Morte d 'Arthur which was to be so influential in his life . At that time neither Burne @-@ Jones nor Morris knew Rossetti personally , but both were much influenced by his works , and met him by recruiting him as a contributor to their Oxford and Cambridge Magazine which Morris founded in 1856 to promote their ideas . 
 Burne @-@ Jones had intended to become a church minister , but under Rossetti 's influence both he and Morris decided to become artists , and Burne @-@ Jones left college before taking a degree to pursue a career in art . In February 1857 , Rossetti wrote to William Bell Scott 
 Two young men , projectors of the Oxford and Cambridge Magazine , have recently come up to town from Oxford , and are now very intimate friends of mine . Their names are Morris and Jones . They have turned artists instead of taking up any other career to which the university generally leads , and both are men of real genius . Jones 's designs are marvels of finish and imaginative detail , unequalled by anything unless perhaps Albert Dürer 's finest works . 
 = = Marriage and family = = 
 In 1856 Burne @-@ Jones became engaged to Georgiana " Georgie " MacDonald ( 1840 – 1920 ) , one of the MacDonald sisters . She was training to be a painter , and was the sister of Burne @-@ Jones 's old school friend . The couple married in 1860 , after which she made her own work in woodcuts and became a close friend of George Eliot . ( Another MacDonald sister married the artist Sir Edward Poynter , a further sister married the ironmaster Alfred Baldwin and was the mother of the Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin , and yet another sister was the mother of Rudyard Kipling . Kipling and Baldwin were thus Burne @-@ Jones 's nephews by marriage ) . 
 Georgiana bore a son , Philip , in 1861 . A second son , born in the winter of 1864 while Georgiana was gravely ill with scarlet fever , died soon after birth . The family soon moved to 41 Kensington Square , and their daughter Margaret was born there in 1866 . 
 In 1867 Burne @-@ Jones and his family settled at the Grange , an 18th @-@ century house set in a large garden in North End Road , Fulham , London . For much of the 1870s Burne @-@ Jones did not exhibit , following a spate of bitterly hostile attacks in the press , and a passionate affair ( described as the " emotional climax of his life " ) with his Greek model Maria Zambaco , which ended with her trying to commit suicide by throwing herself in Regent 's Canal . During these difficult years Georgiana developed a close friendship with Morris , whose wife Jane had fallen in love with Rossetti . Morris and Georgie may have been in love , but if he asked her to leave her husband , she refused . In the end , the Burne @-@ Joneses remained together , as did the Morrises , but Morris and Georgiana were close for the rest of their lives . 
 In 1880 the Burne @-@ Joneses bought Prospect House in Rottingdean , near Brighton in Sussex , as their holiday home , and soon after the next door Aubrey Cottage to create North End House , reflecting the fact that their Fulham home was in North End Road . ( Years later , in 1923 , Sir Roderick Jones , head of Reuters , and his wife , playwright and novelist Enid Bagnold , were to add the adjacent Gothic House to the property , which became the inspiration and setting for her play The Chalk Garden ) . 
 His troubled son Philip , who became a successful portrait painter , died in 1926 . His adored daughter Margaret ( died 1953 ) married John William Mackail ( 1850 – 1945 ) , the friend and biographer of Morris , and Professor of Poetry at Oxford from 1911 – 1916 . Their children were the novelists Angela <unk> and Denis Mackail . In an edition of the boys ' magazine , Chums ( No. 227 , Vol . V , 13 January 1897 ) , an article on Burne @-@ Jones stated that " .... his pet grandson used to be punished by being sent to stand in a corner with his face to the wall . One day on being sent there he was delighted to find the wall prettily decorated with fairies , flowers , birds , and bunnies . His indulgent grandfather had utilised his talent to alleviate the tedium of his favourite 's period of penance . "

 = = = Early years : Rossetti and Morris = = = 
 Burne @-@ Jones once admitted that after leaving Oxford he " found himself at five @-@ and @-@ twenty what he ought to have been at fifteen " . He had had no regular training as a draughtsman , and lacked the confidence of science . But his extraordinary faculty of invention as a designer was already ripening ; his mind , rich in knowledge of classical story and medieval romance , teemed with pictorial subjects , and he set himself to complete his set of skills by resolute labour , witnessed by innumerable drawings . The works of this first period are all more or less tinged by the influence of Rossetti ; but they are already differentiated from the elder master 's style by their more facile though less intensely felt elaboration of imaginative detail . Many are pen @-@ and @-@ ink drawings on vellum , exquisitely finished , of which his <unk> Image ( 1856 ) is one of the earliest and best examples . Although the subject , medium and manner derive from Rossetti 's inspiration , it is not the hand of a pupil merely , but of a potential master . This was recognized by Rossetti himself , who before long avowed that he had nothing more to teach him . 
 Burne @-@ Jones 's first sketch in oils dates from this same year , 1856 , and during 1857 he made for Bradfield College the first of what was to be an immense series of cartoons for stained glass . In 1858 he decorated a cabinet with the Prioress 's Tale from Geoffrey Chaucer 's Canterbury Tales , his first direct illustration of the work of a poet whom he especially loved and who inspired him with endless subjects . Thus early , therefore , we see the artist busy in all the various fields in which he was to labour . 
 In the autumn of 1857 Burne @-@ Jones joined Morris , Valentine Prinsep , J. R. Spencer Stanhope and others in Rossetti 's ill @-@ fated scheme to decorate the walls of the Oxford Union . None of the painters had mastered the technique of fresco , and their pictures had begun to peel from the walls before they were completed . In 1859 Burne @-@ Jones made his first journey to Italy . He saw Florence , Pisa , Siena , Venice and other places , and appears to have found the gentle and romantic Sienese more attractive than any other school . Rossetti 's influence still persisted , and is visible , more strongly perhaps than ever before , in the two watercolours of 1860 , Sidonia von Bork and Clara von Bork . Both paintings illustrate the 1849 gothic novel Sidonia the Sorceress by Lady Wilde , a translation of Sidonia Von Bork : Die <unk> ( 1847 ) by Johann Wilhelm <unk> . 
 = = = Decorative arts : Morris & Co . = = = 
 In 1861 , William Morris founded the decorative arts firm of Morris , Marshall , Faulkner & Co. with Rossetti , Burne @-@ Jones , Ford Madox Brown and Philip Webb as partners , together with Charles Faulkner and Peter Paul Marshall , the former of whom was a member of the Oxford Brotherhood , and the latter a friend of Brown and Rossetti . The prospectus set forth that the firm would undertake carving , stained glass , metal @-@ work , paper @-@ hangings , <unk> ( printed fabrics ) , and carpets . The decoration of churches was from the first an important part of the business . The work shown by the firm at the 1862 International Exhibition attracted much notice , and within a few years it was flourishing . Two significant secular commissions helped establish the firm 's reputation in the late 1860s : a royal project at St. James 's Palace and the " green dining room " at the South Kensington Museum ( now the Victoria and Albert ) of 1867 which featured stained glass windows and panel figures by Burne @-@ Jones . 
 In 1871 Morris & Co. were responsible for the windows at All Saints , designed by Burne @-@ Jones for Alfred Baldwin , his wife 's brother @-@ in @-@ law . The firm was reorganized as Morris & Co. in 1875 , and Burne @-@ Jones continued to contribute designs for stained glass , and later tapestries until the end of his career . Stained glass windows in the Christ Church cathedral and other buildings in Oxford are by William Morris & Co. with designs by Burne @-@ Jones Stanmore Hall was the last major decorating commission executed by Morris & Co. before Morris 's death in 1896 . It was also the most extensive commission undertaken by the firm , and included a series of tapestries based on the story of the Holy Grail for the dining room , with figures by Burne @-@ Jones . 
 In 1891 Jones was elected a member of the Art Workers Guild .

 Although known primarily as a painter , Burne @-@ Jones was also an illustrator , helping the Pre @-@ Raphaelite aesthetic to enter mainstream awareness .

 The Earthly Paradise by William Morris ( not completed ) 
 The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer by Geoffrey Chaucer ( 1896 ) 
 Bible Gallery by Dalziel ( 1881 )

 In 1864 Burne @-@ Jones was elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water @-@ Colours ( also known as the Old Water @-@ Colour Society ) , and exhibited , among other works , The Merciful Knight , the first picture which fully revealed his ripened personality as an artist . The next six years saw a series of fine watercolours at the same gallery . In 1866 Mrs <unk> commissioned Burne @-@ Jones to paint her daughter , Maria Zambaco , in Cupid finding Psyche , an introduction which led to their tragic affair . In 1870 , Burne @-@ Jones resigned his membership following a controversy over his painting Phyllis and <unk> . The features of Maria Zambaco were clearly recognizable in the barely draped Phyllis ( as they are in several of Burne @-@ Jones 's finest works ) , and the undraped nakedness of <unk> coupled with the suggestion of female sexual assertiveness offended Victorian sensibilities . Burne @-@ Jones was asked to make a slight alteration , but instead " withdrew not only the picture from the walls , but himself from the Society . " 
 During the next seven years , 1870 – 1877 , only two works of the painter 's were exhibited . These were two water @-@ colours , shown at the Dudley Gallery in 1873 , one of them being the beautiful Love among the Ruins , destroyed twenty years later by a cleaner who supposed it to be an oil painting , but afterwards reproduced in oils by the painter . This silent period was , however , one of unremitting production . Hitherto Burne @-@ Jones had worked almost entirely in water @-@ colours . He now began a number of large pictures in oils , working at them in turn , and having always several on hand . The first Briar Rose series , Laus Veneris , the Golden Stairs , the Pygmalion series , and The Mirror of Venus are among the works planned and completed , or carried far towards completion , during these years . These years also mark the beginnings of Burne @-@ Jones 's partnership with the fine @-@ art photographer Frederick <unk> , whose reproductions of paintings and — especially — drawings would expose a wider audience to Burne @-@ Jones 's works in the coming decades . 
 At last , in May 1877 , the day of recognition came , with the opening of the first exhibition of the Grosvenor Gallery , when the Days of Creation , The Beguiling of Merlin , and the Mirror of Venus were all shown . Burne @-@ Jones followed up the signal success of these pictures with Laus Veneris , the Chant d 'Amour , Pan and Psyche , and other works , exhibited in 1878 . Most of these pictures are painted in brilliant colours . A change is noticeable the next year , 1879 , in the Annunciation and in the four pictures making up the second series of Pygmalion and the Image ; the former of these , one of the simplest and most perfect of the artist 's works , is subdued and sober ; in the latter a scheme of soft and delicate tints was attempted , not with entire success . A similar temperance of colours marks The Golden Stairs , first exhibited in 1880 . The almost sombre Wheel of Fortune was shown in 1883 , followed in 1884 by King <unk> and the Beggar Maid , in which Burne @-@ Jones once more indulged his love of gorgeous colour , refined by the period of self @-@ restraint . He next turned to two important sets of pictures , The Briar Rose and The Story of Perseus , though these were not completed for some years . 
 Burne @-@ Jones was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1885 , and the following year he exhibited ( for the only time ) at the Academy , showing The Depths of the Sea , a painting of a mermaid carrying down with her a youth whom she has unconsciously drowned in the impetuosity of her love . This picture adds to the habitual haunting charm a tragic irony of conception and a felicity of execution which give it a place apart among Burne @-@ Jones 's works . He formally resigned his Associateship in 1893 . One of the Perseus series was exhibited in 1887 , two more in 1888 , with The Brazen Tower , inspired by the same legend . In 1890 the second series of The Legend of Briar Rose were exhibited by themselves , and won the widest admiration . The huge watercolor , The Star of Bethlehem , painted for the corporation of Birmingham , was exhibited in 1891 . A long illness for some time checked the painter 's activity , which , when resumed , was much occupied with decorative schemes . An exhibition of his work was held at the New Gallery in the winter of 1892 @-@ 1893 . To this period belong several of his comparatively few portraits . In 1894 Burne @-@ Jones was made a baronet . Ill @-@ health again interrupted the progress of his works , chief among which was the vast Arthur in Avalon . In the winter following his death a second exhibition of his works was held at the New Gallery , and an exhibition of his drawings ( including some of the charmingly humorous sketches made for children ) at the Burlington Fine Arts Club . 
 = = = Design for the theatre = = = 
 In 1894 , theatrical manager and actor Henry Irving commissioned Burne @-@ Jones to design sets and costumes for the Lyceum Theatre production of King Arthur by J. Comyns Carr , who was Burne @-@ Jones 's patron and the director of the New Gallery as well as a playwright . The play starred Irving as King Arthur and Ellen Terry as Guinevere , and toured America following its London run . Burne @-@ Jones accepted the commission with some <unk> , but was disappointed with much of the final result . He wrote confidentially to his friend Helen Mary Gaskell ( known as May ) , " The armour is good — they have taken pains with it ... Perceval looked the one romantic thing in it ... I hate the stage , don 't tell — but I do . " 
 = = = Aesthetics = = = 
 Burne @-@ Jones 's paintings were one strand in the evolving tapestry of Aestheticism from the 1860s through the 1880s , which considered that art should be valued as an object of beauty engendering a sensual response , rather than for the story or moral implicit in the subject matter . In many ways this was antithetical to the ideals of Ruskin and the early Pre @-@ Raphaelites . 
 Burne @-@ Jones 's aim in art is best given in some of his own words , written to a friend : 
 I mean by a picture a beautiful , romantic dream of something that never was , never will be - in a light better than any light that ever shone - in a land no one can define or remember , only desire - and the forms divinely beautiful - and then I wake up , with the waking of Brynhild . 
 No artist was ever more true to his aim . Ideals resolutely pursued are apt to provoke the resentment of the world , and Burne @-@ Jones encountered , endured and conquered an extraordinary amount of angry criticism . Insofar as this was directed against the lack of realism in his pictures , it was beside the point . The earth , the sky , the rocks , the trees , the men and women of Burne @-@ Jones are not those of this world ; but they are themselves a world , consistent with itself , and having therefore its own reality . Charged with the beauty and with the strangeness of dreams , it has nothing of a dream 's incoherence . Yet it is a dreamer always whose nature penetrates these works , a nature out of sympathy with struggle and strenuous action . Burne @-@ Jones 's men and women are dreamers too . It was this which , more than anything else , estranged him from the age into which he was born . But he had an inbred " revolt from fact " which would have estranged him from the actualities of any age . That criticism seems to be more justified which has found in him a lack of such victorious energy and mastery over his materials as would have enabled him to carry out his conceptions in their original intensity . Yet Burne @-@ Jones was singularly strenuous in production . His industry was inexhaustible , and needed to be , if it was to keep pace with the constant pressure of his ideas . Whatever faults his paintings may have , they have always the fundamental virtue of design ; they are always pictures . His designs were informed with a mind of romantic temper , apt in the discovery of beautiful subjects , and impassioned with a delight in pure and variegated colour . 
 = = Honours = = 
 In 1881 Burne @-@ Jones received an honorary degree from Oxford , and was made an Honorary Fellow in 1882 . In 1885 he became the President of the Birmingham Society of Artists . At about that time he began <unk> his name , merely — as he wrote later — to avoid " annihilation " in the mass of Joneses . In November 1893 , he was approached to see if he would accept a Baronetcy on the recommendation of the outgoing Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone , the following February he legally changed his name to Burne @-@ Jones He was formally created a baronet of Rottingdean , in the county of Sussex , and of the Grange , in the parish of Fulham , in the county of London in the <unk> of the United Kingdom on 3 May 1894 , but remained unhappy about accepting the honour , which disgusted his socialist friend Morris and was scorned by his equally socialist wife Georgiana . Only his son Philip , who mixed with the set of the Prince of Wales and would inherit the title , truly wanted it . 
 Morris died in 1896 , and the health of the devastated Burne @-@ Jones declined substantially . In 1898 he suffered an attack of influenza , and had apparently recovered when he was again taken suddenly ill , and died on 17 June 1898 . Six days later , at the intervention of the Prince of Wales , a memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey . It was the first time an artist had been so honoured . Burne @-@ Jones was buried in the churchyard at St Margaret 's Church , Rottingdean , a place he knew through summer family holidays . 
 = = Influence = = 
 Burne @-@ Jones exerted a considerable influence on French painting . He was also highly influential among French symbolist painters , from 1889 . His work inspired poetry by Swinburne – Swinburne 's 1866 Poems & Ballads is dedicated to Burne @-@ Jones . 
 Three of Burne @-@ Jones 's studio assistants , John Melhuish Strudwick , T. M. Rooke and Charles Fairfax Murray , went on to successful painting careers . Murray later became an important collector and respected art dealer . Between 1903 and 1907 he sold a great many works by Burne @-@ Jones and the Pre @-@ Raphaelites to the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery , at far below their market worth . Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery now has the largest collection of works by Burne @-@ Jones in the world , including the massive watercolour Star of Bethlehem , commissioned for the Gallery in 1897 . The paintings are believed by some to have influenced the young J. R. R. Tolkien , then growing up in Birmingham . 
 Burne @-@ Jones was also a very strong influence on the Birmingham Group of artists , from the 1890s onwards . 
 = = Neglect and rediscovery = = 
 On 16 June 1933 , Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin , a nephew of Burne @-@ Jones , officially opened the centenary exhibition featuring Burne @-@ Jones 's drawings and paintings at the Tate Gallery in London . In his opening speech at the exhibition , Mr Baldwin expressed what the art of Burne @-@ Jones stood for : 
 In my view , what he did for us common people was to open , as never had been opened before , magic casements of a land of faery in which he lived throughout his life ... It is in that inner world we can cherish in peace , beauty which he has left us and in which there is peace at least for ourselves . The few of us who knew him and loved him well , always keep him in our hearts , but his work will go on long after we have passed away . It may give its message in one generation to a few or in other to many more , but there it will be for ever for those who seek in their generation , for beauty and for those who can recognise and reverence a great man , and a great artist . 
 But , in fact , long before 1933 , Burne @-@ Jones was hopelessly out @-@ of @-@ fashion in the art world , much of which soon preferred the major trends in Modern art , and the exhibit marking the 100th anniversary of his birth was a sad affair , poorly attended . It was not until the mid @-@ 1970s that his work began to be re @-@ assessed and once again acclaimed . A major exhibit in 1989 at the Barbican Art Gallery , London ( in book form as : John Christian , The Last Romantics , 1989 ) , traced Burne @-@ Jones 's influence on the next generation of artists , and another at Tate Britain in 1997 explored the links between British Aestheticism and Symbolism . 
 A second lavish centenary exhibit – this time marking the 100th anniversary of Burne @-@ Jones 's death – was held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1998 , before traveling to the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery and the Musée d 'Orsay , Paris . 
 Fiona MacCarthy , in a review of Burne @-@ Jones 's legacy , notes that he was " a painter who , while quintessentially Victorian , leads us forward to the psychological and sexual introspection of the early twentieth century " .

 = Amman = 
 Amman ( English pronunciation : / <unk> / ; Arabic : <unk> ) is the capital and most populous city of Jordan , and the country 's economic , political and cultural centre . Situated in north @-@ central Jordan , Amman is the administrative centre of the Amman Governorate . The city has a population of 4 @,@ 007 @,@ 526 and a land area of 1 @,@ 680 square kilometres ( 648 @.@ 7 sq mi ) . Today , Amman is considered to be among the most liberal and westernized Arab cities . It is a major tourist destination in the region , particularly among Arab and European tourists . 
 The earliest evidence of settlement in the area is a Neolithic site known as ' Ain Ghazal . Its successor was known as " Rabbath Ammon " , which was the capital of the Ammonites , then as " Philadelphia " , and finally as Amman . It was initially built on seven hills but now spans over 19 hills combining 27 districts , which are administered by the Greater Amman Municipality headed by its mayor <unk> <unk> . Areas of Amman have either gained their names from the hills ( Jabal ) or valleys ( Wadi ) they lie on , such as Jabal <unk> and Wadi Abdoun . East Amman is predominantly filled with historic sites that frequently host cultural activities , while West Amman is more modern and serves as the economic center of the city . 
 Approximately 2 million visitors arrived in Amman in 2015 , which ranked it as the 93rd most visited city in the world and the 5th most visited Arab city . Amman has a relatively fast growing economy , and it is ranked Beta − on the global city index . Moreover , it was named one of the Middle East and North Africa 's best cities according to economic , labor , environmental , and socio @-@ cultural factors . The city is among the most popular locations in the Arab world for multinational corporations to set up their regional offices , alongside Doha and only behind Dubai . It is expected that in the next 10 years these three cities will capture the largest share of multinational corporation activity in the region . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Amman derives its name from the 13th century BC when the Ammonites named it " Rabbath Ammon " , with the term Rabbath meaning the " Capital " or the " King 's Quarters " . Over time , the term " Rabbath " was no longer used and the city became known as " Ammon " . The influence of new civilizations that conquered the city gradually changed its name to " Amman " . In the Hebrew Bible , it is referred to as " <unk> <unk> " ( Biblical Hebrew : <unk> <unk> , Tiberian Hebrew <unk> <unk> ) . However , Ptolemy II Philadelphus , the Macedonian ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom who reigned from 283 to 246 BC , renamed the city to " Philadelphia " ( Ancient Greek : <unk> ; literally : " brotherly love " ) after occupying it . The name was given as an adulation to his own nickname , Philadelphus . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Ancient period = = = 
 In the outskirts of Amman , one of the largest known ancient settlements in the Near East was discovered . The site , known as ' Ain Ghazal which is situated on a valley @-@ side , dates back to <unk> BC and spans an area of 15 hectares . It was a typical average sized <unk> Neolithic village that accommodated around 3 @,@ 000 inhabitants . Its houses were rectangular mud @-@ bricked buildings that included a main square living room , whose walls were made up of lime plaster . The site was discovered in 1974 as construction workers were working on a road crossing the area . By 1982 when the excavations started , around 600 meters ( 2 @,@ 000 feet ) of road ran through the site . Despite the damage brought by urban expansion , the remains of ' Ain Ghazal provided wealthy information . 
 'Ain Ghazal is well known for a set of small human statues found buried in pits which were discovered in 1983 , when local archaeologists stumbled upon the edge of a large pit 2 @.@ 5 meters ( 8 @.@ 2 feet ) containing plaster statues . These statues are human figures made with white plaster . The figures have painted clothes , hair , and in some cases ornamental tattoos . 32 figures were found in two caches , 15 of them full figures , 15 busts , and two fragmentary heads . Three of the busts were two @-@ headed , the significance of which is not clear . 
 In the 13th century BC Amman was the capital of the Ammonites , and became known as " Rabbath Ammon " . Ammon provided several natural resources to the region , including sandstone and limestone . Along with a productive agricultural sector , which made Ammon a vital location along the King 's Highway , the ancient trade route connecting Egypt with Mesopotamia , Syria and Anatolia . As with the <unk> and <unk> , trade along this route gave the Ammonites considerable revenue . Ammonites worshiped an ancient deity called Moloch . Excavations by archaeologists near Amman Civil Airport uncovered a temple , which included an altar containing many human bone fragments . The bones showed evidence of burning , which led to the assumption that the altar functioned as a pyre . 
 Today , several Ammonite ruins across Amman exist , such as Qasr Al @-@ Abd , Rujm Al @-@ <unk> and some parts of the Amman Citadel . The ruins of Rujm Al @-@ <unk> consist of a surveillance stone tower that was used to ensure protection of their capital and several store rooms east of it . The city was later conquered by the Assyrian Empire , followed by the Persian Empire . 
 = = = Classical period = = = 
 Conquest of the Middle East and Central Asia by Alexander the Great firmly consolidated the influence of Hellenistic culture . The Greeks founded new cities in the area of modern @-@ day Jordan , including Umm Qays , Jerash and Amman . Ptolemy II Philadelphus , the Macedonian ruler of Egypt , who occupied and rebuilt the city , named it " Philadelphia " , which means " brotherly love " in Greek . The name was given as an adulation to his own nickname , Philadelphus . 
 One of the most original monuments in Jordan , and perhaps in the Hellenistic period in the Near East , is the village of Iraq Al @-@ Amir in the valley of Wadi Al @-@ Sir , southwest of Amman , which is home to Qasr Al @-@ Abd ( Castle of the Slave ) . Other nearby ruins include a village , an isolated house and a fountain , all of which are barely visible today due to the damage brought by a major earthquake that hit the region in the year 362 . Qasr Al @-@ Abd is believed to have been built by Hyrcanus of Jerusalem , who was the head of the powerful <unk> family . Shortly after he began the construction of that large building , in 170 BC upon returning from a military campaign in Egypt , Antiochus IV conquered Jerusalem , ransacked a temple where the treasure of Hyrcanus was kept and appeared determined to attack Hyrcanus . Upon hearing this , Hyrcanus committed suicide , leaving his palace in Philadelphia uncompleted . The <unk> fought the Arab Nabateans for twenty years until they lost the city to them . After losing Philadelphia , we no longer hear of the <unk> family in written sources . 
 The Romans conquered much of the Levant in 63 BC , inaugurating a period of Roman rule that lasted for four centuries . In the northern modern @-@ day Jordan , the Greek cities of Philadelphia ( Amman ) , Gerasa , <unk> , Pella and <unk> joined with other cities in Palestine and Syria ; Scythopolis , Hippos , <unk> , <unk> and Damascus to form the Decapolis League , a fabled confederation linked by bonds of economic and cultural interest . Philadelphia became a point along a road stretching from <unk> to Damascus that was built by Emperor Trajan in 106 AD . This provided an economic boost for the city in a short period of time . During the late Byzantine era in the 7th century , several bishops and churches were based in the city . 
 Roman rule in Jordan left several ruins across the country , some of which exist in Amman , such as the Temple of Hercules at the Amman Citadel , the Roman Theatre , the Odeon , and the Nymphaeum . The two theatres and the Nymphaeum fountain were built during the reign of Emperor Antoninus Pius around 161 AD . The theatre was the larger venue of the two and had a capacity for 6 @,@ 000 attendees . It was oriented north and built into the hillside , to protect the audience from the sun . To the northeast of the theatre was a small <unk> . Built at roughly the same time as the theatre , the Odeon had 500 seats and is still in use today for music concerts . Archaeologists speculate that the structure was originally covered with a wooden roof to shield the audience from the weather . The Nymphaeum is situated southwest of the Odeon and served as Philadelphia 's chief fountain . The Nymphaeum is believed to have contained a 600 @-@ square meter pool which was three meters deep and was continuously refilled with water . 
 = = = Islamic era = = = 
 In the 630s , the Rashidun army conquered the region from the Byzantines , beginning the Islamic era in the Levant . Philadelphia was renamed " Amman " by the Muslims and became part of the district of Jund al @-@ Urdunn . A large part of the population already spoke Arabic , which facilitated integration into the caliphate , as well as several conversions to Islam . Under the Umayyad caliphs who began their rule in 661 AD , numerous desert castles were established as a means to govern the desert area of modern @-@ day Jordan , several of which are still well @-@ preserved . Amman had already been functioning as an administrative centre . The Umayyads built a large palace on the Amman Citadel hill , known today as the Umayyad Palace . Amman was later destroyed by several earthquakes and natural disasters , including a particularly severe earthquake in 747 . The Umayyads were overthrown by the Abbasids three years later . 
 Amman 's importance declined by the mid @-@ 8th century after damage caused by several earthquakes rendered it uninhabitable . Excavations among the collapsed layer of the Umayyad Palace have revealed remains of kilns from the time of the Abbasids ( 750 @-@ 696 ) and the Fatimids ( 969 @-@ 1099 ) . In the late 9th century , Amman was noted as the " capital " of the Balqa by geographer al @-@ Yaqubi . Likewise , in 985 , the Jerusalemite historian al @-@ Muqaddasi described Amman as the capital of Balqa , and that it was a town in the desert fringe of Syria surrounded by villages and cornfields and was a regional source of lambs , grain and honey . Furthermore , al @-@ Muqaddasi describes Amman as a " harbor of the desert " where Arab Bedouin would take refuge , and that its citadel , which overlooked the town , contained a small mosque . 
 The occupation of the Citadel Hill by the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem is so far based only on interpretations of Crusader sources . William of Tyre writes in his Historia that in 1161 Philip of Milly received the castle of " <unk> " , which is seen to refer to Amman , as part of the Lordship of Oultrejordain . In 1166 Philip joined the military order of the Knights Templar , passing on to them a significant part of his fief including the castle of <unk> or " Haman " , as it is named in the deed of confirmation issued by King Amalric . The remains of a watch tower on Citadel Hill , first attributed to the Crusaders , now are preferentially dated to the Ayyubid period , after 1187 , leaving it to further research to find the location of the Crusader castle . During the Ayyubid period , the Damascene geographer al @-@ Dimashqi wrote that Amman was part of the province of al @-@ Karak , although " only ruins " remained of the town . 
 During the Mamluk era ( late 13th – early 16th centuries ) , the region of Amman was a part of <unk> Balqa , the southernmost district of Mamlakat Dimashq ( Damascus Province ) . The capital of the district in the first half of the 14th century was the minor administrative post of Hisban , which had a considerably smaller garrison than the other administrative centers in Transjordan , namely Ajlun and al @-@ Karak . In 1321 , the geographer Abu 'l Fida , recorded that Amman was " a very ancient town " with fertile soil and surrounded by agricultural fields . For unclear , though likely financial reasons , in 1356 , the capital of Balqa was transferred from Hisban to Amman , which was considered a <unk> ( city ) . In 1357 , Emir Sirghitmish bought Amman in its entirety , most likely to use revenues from the city to help fund the Madrasa of Sirghitmish , which he built in Cairo that same year . After his purchase of the city , Sirghitmish transferred the courts , administrative bureaucracy , markets and most of the inhabitants of Hisban to Amman . Moreover , he financed new building works in the city . 
 Ownership of Amman following Sirghitmish 's death in 1358 passed to successive generations of his descendants until 1395 , when his descendants sold it to Emir <unk> al @-@ <unk> , the na 'ib as @-@ saltana ( viceroy ) of Damascus . Afterward , part of Amman 's cultivable lands were sold to Emir <unk> al @-@ <unk> ( died 1396 ) , the na 'ib as @-@ saltana of Egypt . The increasingly frequent division and sale of the city and lands of Amman to different owners signaled declining revenues coming from Amman , while at the same time , Hisban was restored as the major city of the Balqa in the 15th century . From the 15th century onward until 1878 , Amman became an abandoned pile of ruins only sporadically used for shelter by seasonal farmers from elsewhere who used the arable land of the area , and by Bedouin tribes who used its pastures and water . 
 The Ottoman Empire annexed the region of Amman in 1516 , but for much of the Ottoman period , al @-@ Salt functioned as the virtual political centre of Transjordan . Amman was only resettled starting from 1878 , when hundreds of Circassians arrived following their exodus from the Caucasus during the rule of Sultan Abdul Hamid II . Between 1872 – 1910 , tens of thousands of Circassians were forcibly relocated to Ottoman Syria from historical <unk> by the Russian Empire during the events of the Russo @-@ Circassian War . English traveller Laurence Oliphant wrote of a visit to the settlement of Amman in 1879 in his The Land of Gilead . 
 = = = Modern era = = = 
 Ottoman records from 1906 show around 5 @,@ 000 Circassians living in Amman and virtually no inhabitants who spoke Arabic . The city 's demographics changed dramatically after the Ottoman government 's decision to construct the Hejaz Railway , which linked Damascus and Medina , and facilitated the annual Hajj pilgrimage and trade . Because of its location along the railway , Amman was transformed from a small village into a major commercial hub in the region . 
 The First and Second Battle of Amman were part of the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I and the Arab Revolt , taking place in 1918 . Amman had a strategic location along the Hejaz Railway ; its capture by British forces and the Hashemite Arab army facilitated the British advance towards Damascus . The second battle was won by the British , resulting in the establishment of the British Mandate . 
 In 1921 , the Hashemite emir and later king , Abdullah I , designated Amman instead of al @-@ Salt to be the capital of the newly created state , the Emirate of Transjordan , which became the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1950 . Its function as the capital of the country attracted immigrants from different Levantine areas , particularly from al @-@ Salt , a nearby city that had been the largest urban settlement east of the Jordan River at the time . The early settlers who came from Palestine were overwhelmingly from Nablus , from which many of al @-@ Salt 's inhabitants had originated . They were joined by other immigrants from Damascus . Amman later attracted people from the southern part of the country , particularly Al Karak and Madaba . The city 's population was around 10 @,@ 000 in the 1930s . 
 Jordan gained its independence in 1946 and Amman was designated the country 's capital . Amman received many refugees during wartime events in nearby countries , beginning with the 1948 Arab – Israeli War . A second wave arrived after the Six @-@ Day War in 1967 , and a third wave of Palestinian and Jordanian refugees arrived in Amman from Kuwait after the 1991 Gulf War . The first wave of Iraqi refugees settled in the city after the 1991 Gulf War , with a second wave occurring in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq . Most recently a wave of Syrian refugees have arrived in the city during the ongoing Syrian Civil War which began in 2011 . Amman was a principal destination for refugees for the security and prosperity it offered . 
 In 1970 , Amman was a battlefield during the conflict between the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) and the Jordanian Army known as Black September . The Jordanian Army defeated the PLO in 1971 , and the latter were expelled to Lebanon . On 9 November 2005 , Al @-@ Qaeda under Abu Musab al @-@ Zarqawi 's leadership launched coordinated explosions in three hotel lobbies in Amman , resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured . The bombings , which targeted civilians , caused widespread outrage among Jordanians . Jordan 's security as a whole was dramatically improved after the attack , and no major terrorist attacks have been reported since then . 
 During the last ten years the city has experienced an economic , cultural and urban boom . The large growth in population has significantly increased the need for new accommodation , and new districts of the city were established at a quick pace . This strained Jordan 's scarce water supply and exposed Amman to the dangers of quick expansion without careful municipal planning . Today , Amman is known as a modern , liberal and westernized Arab city , with major mega projects such as the Abdali Urban Regeneration Project and the Jordan Gate Towers . The city contains several high @-@ end hotel franchises including the Four Seasons Hotel Amman , Sheraton Hotel Amman , Fairmont Amman , St. Regis Hotel Amman , Le Royal Hotel and others . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Amman is situated on the East Bank Plateau , an upland characterized by three major wadis which run through it . Originally , the city had been built on seven hills . Amman 's terrain is typified by its mountains . The most important areas in the city are named after the hills or mountains they lie on . The area 's elevation ranges from 700 to 1 @,@ 100 m ( 2 @,@ 300 to 3 @,@ 600 ft ) . Al @-@ Salt and al @-@ Zarqa are located to the northwest and northeast , respectively , Madaba is located to the west and al @-@ Karak and Ma 'an are to Amman 's southwest and southeast , respectively . One of the only remaining springs in Amman now supplies the Zarqa River with water . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Amman 's position on the mountains near the Mediterranean climate zone places it under the semi @-@ arid climate classification ( Köppen climate : BSk ) . Summers are mildly hot and breezy , however , one or two heat waves may occur during summer . Spring is brief and warm , where highs reach 28 ° C ( 82 ° F ) . Spring usually starts between April and May , and last about a month . Around the end of November is the period in which winter usually starts and continues from early to mid March . Temperatures are usually near or below 17 ° C ( 63 ° F ) , with snow occasionally falling once or twice a year . Rain averages about 300 mm ( 12 in ) a year and periodic droughts are common , where most rain fall between October and April . At least 120 days of heavy fog per year is usual . Difference in elevation plays a major role in the different weather conditions experienced in the city , snow may accumulate in the western and northern parts of Amman ( an average altitude of 1 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) above sea level ) while at the same time it could be raining at the city centre ( elevation of 776 m ( 2 @,@ 546 ft ) ) .

 Amman has extreme examples of microclimate , and almost every district exhibits its own weather . It is known among locals that some boroughs such as the northern suburb of Abu <unk> are among the coldest in the city , and can be experiencing frost while other warmer districts such as Marka can be providing much warmer temperatures to its inhabitants at the same time . 
 The temperatures listed below are taken from the weather station at the centre of the city which is at an elevation of 767 m ( 2 @,@ 516 ft ) above sea level .

 = = Local government = = 
 Amman is governed by a 41 @-@ member city council elected in five @-@ year term direct elections . All Jordanian citizens above 18 years old are eligible to vote in the municipal elections . However , the mayor is appointed by the king and not through elections . In 1909 a city council was established in Amman by Circassian Ismael <unk> who became the first ever Mayor of the capital , and in 1914 Amman 's first city district centre was founded . 
 The Greater Amman Municipality has been investing towards making the city a better place , through a number of initiatives . ' Green Amman 2020 ' was initiated in 2014 , aiming to turn the city to a green metropolis by 2020 . According to official statistics , only 2 @.@ 5 % of Amman is green space . In 2015 , ( GAM ) and Zain Jordan started operating free @-@ of @-@ charge Wi @-@ Fi services at 15 different locations , including <unk> Street , Rainbow Street , The Hashemite Plaza , <unk> Cultural Complex , Zaha Cultural Centre , Al Hussein Cultural Center , Al Hussein Public Parks and others .

 The banking sector is one of the principal foundations of Jordan 's economy . Despite the unrest and economic difficulties in the Arab world resulting from the Arab Spring uprisings , Jordan 's banking sector maintained its growth in 2014 . The sector currently consists of 25 banks , 15 of which are listed on the Amman Stock Exchange . Amman is the base city for the international Arab Bank , one of the largest financial institutions in the Middle East , serving clients in more than 600 branches in 30 countries on five continents . Arab Bank represents 28 % of the Amman Stock Exchange and is the highest @-@ ranked institution by market capitalization on the exchange .

 Amman is the 4th most visited Arab city and the ninth highest recipient of international visitor spending . Roughly 1 @.@ 8 million tourists visited Amman in 2011 and spent over $ 1 @.@ 3 billion in the city . The expansion of Queen Alia International Airport is an example of the Greater Amman Municipality 's heavy investment in the city 's infrastructure . The recent construction of a public transportation system and a national railway , and the expansion of roads , are intended to ease the traffic generated by the millions of annual visitors to the city . 
 Amman , and Jordan in general , is the Middle East 's hub for medical tourism . Jordan receives the most medical tourists in the region and the fifth highest in the world . Amman receives 250 @,@ 000 foreign patients a year and over $ 1 billion annually . 
 = = = Business = = = 
 Amman is introducing itself as a business hub . The city 's skyline is being continuously transformed through the emergence of new projects . A significant portion of business flowed into Amman following the 2003 Iraq War . Jordan 's main airport , Queen Alia International Airport , is located south of Amman and is the hub for the country 's national carrier Royal Jordanian , a major airline in the region . The airline is headquartered in <unk> district . Rubicon Group Holding and <unk> , two major regional information technology companies , are based in Amman , along with major international corporations such as <unk> Pharmaceuticals , one of the Middle East 's largest pharmaceutical companies , and <unk> , the Middle East 's largest logistics and transportation company . 
 In a report by Dunia Frontier Consultants , Amman , along with Doha , Qatar and Dubai , United Arab Emirates , are the favored hubs for multinational corporations operating in the Middle East and North Africa region . In FDI magazine , Amman was chosen as the Middle Eastern city with the most potential to be a leader in foreign direct investment in the region . Furthermore , several of the world 's largest investment banks have offices in Amman including Standard Chartered , Société Générale , and Citibank . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 Population of city reached 4 @,@ 007 @,@ 526 in 2015 , Amman contains about 42 % of Jordan 's entire population . It has a land area of 1 @,@ 680 km2 ( 648 @.@ 7 sq mi ) which yields a population density of about 2 @,@ 380 inhabitants per square kilometre ( 6 @,@ 200 / sq mi ) . The population of Amman has risen exponentially with the successive waves of immigrants and refugees arriving throughout the 20th century . From a population of roughly 1 @,@ 000 in 1890 , Amman grew to around 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 inhabitants in 1990 , primarily as a result of immigration , but also due to the high birthrate in the city . Amman had been abandoned for centuries until hundreds of Circassians settled it in the 19th century . Today , about 40 @,@ 000 Circassians live in Amman and its vicinity . After Amman became a major hub along the Hejaz Railway in 1914 , many Muslim and Christian merchant families from al @-@ Salt immigrated to the city . A large proportion of Amman 's inhabitants have Palestinian roots ( urban or rural origin ) , and the two main demographic groups in the city today are Arabs of Palestinian or Jordanian descent . Circassians comprise about 2 % of the population . There are no official statistics about the proportion of people of Palestinian or Jordanian descent . 
 New arrivals consisting of Jordanians from the north and south of the country and immigrants from Palestine had increased the city 's population from 30 @,@ 000 in 1930 to 60 @,@ 000 in 1947 . About 10 @,@ 000 Palestinians , mostly from Safad , Haifa and Acre , migrated to the city for economic opportunities before the 1948 war . Many of the immigrants from al @-@ Salt from that time were originally from Nablus . The 1948 war caused an exodus of urban Muslim and Christian Palestinian refugees , mostly from Jaffa , Ramla and Lydda , to Amman , whose population swelled to 110 @,@ 000 . With Jordan 's capture of the West Bank during the war , many Palestinians from that area steadily migrated to Amman between 1950 and 1966 , before another mass wave of Palestinian refugees from the West Bank moved to the city during the 1967 War . By 1970 , the population had swelled to an estimated 550 @,@ 000 . A further 200 @,@ 000 Palestinians arrived after their expulsion from Kuwait during the 1991 Gulf War . Several large Palestinian refugee camps exist around the centre of Amman . 
 Because Amman lacks a deep @-@ rooted native population , the city does not have a distinct Arabic dialect , although recently such a dialect utilizing the various Jordanian and Palestinian dialects , has been forming . The children of immigrants in the city are also increasingly referring to themselves as " Ammani " , unlike much of the first @-@ generation inhabitants who identify more with their respective places of origin .

 Amman has a mostly Sunni Muslim population , and the city contains numerous mosques . Among the main mosques is the large King Abdullah I Mosque , built between 1982 and 1989 . It is capped by a blue mosaic dome beneath which 3 @,@ 000 Muslims may offer prayer . The Abu <unk> Mosque , noted for its checkered black @-@ and @-@ white pattern , has an architectural style that is unique to Jordan . The mosque is situated on Jabal <unk> , the highest point in the city . The mosque 's interior is marked by light @-@ coloured walls and Persian carpets . It was built by a Circassian resident of Amman . During the 2004 Amman Message conference , edicts from various clergy @-@ members afforded the following schools of thought as garnering collective recognition : Hanafi , Hanbali , Maliki , Shafi 'i , Ja <unk> , <unk> , Zaydi , <unk> , <unk> @-@ related Sufism , <unk> and <unk> . Amman also has a small Druze community . 
 Large numbers of Christians from throughout Jordan , particularly from al @-@ Salt , have moved to Amman . Nearby <unk> is a predominantly Christian town located to the northwest of the city . A small Armenian Catholic community of around 70 families is present in the city . Ecclesiastical courts for matters of personal status are also located in Amman . A total of 16 historic churches are located in Umm ar @-@ <unk> ruins in Al @-@ <unk> district ; the site is believed to have initially served as Roman fortified military camps which gradually became a town around the 5th century AD .

 = = = Roads = = = 
 Amman has an extensive road network , although the mountainous terrain of the area has prevented the connection of some main roads , which are instead connected by bridges and tunnels . The Abdoun Bridge spans Wadi Abdoun and connects the 4th Circle to Abdoun Circle . It is considered one of Amman 's many landmarks and is the first curved suspended bridge to be built in the country . 
 There are eight circles , or roundabouts , that span and connect west Amman . Successive waves of immigrants to the city has led to the rapid construction of new neighborhoods , but Amman 's capacity for new or widened roads remains limited despite the influx . This has resulted in increasing traffic jams , particularly during summer when there are large numbers of tourists and Jordanian expatriates visiting . The municipality began construction on a bus rapid transit ( BRT ) system as a solution in 2015 . In 2015 , a ring road encompassing the city was constructed , which aims to connect the northern and southern parts of the city in order for traffic to be diverted outside Amman and to improve the environmental conditions in the city .

 = Rise and Fall : Civilizations at War = 
 Rise and Fall : Civilizations at War is a real @-@ time strategy game developed by both Stainless Steel Studios and Midway Games ; it was released on June 12 , 2006 . The game incorporates segments of both third @-@ person and first @-@ person shooter gameplay , by allowing the player to temporarily control a " hero " . Rise and Fall is based in the first millennium BC , and features four playable civilizations : Persia , Greece , Egypt , and Rome . The game includes over eighty civilization @-@ unique military units , as well as eight " hero " units — of which only one may be purchased during a game . In Rise and Fall , there are two campaigns : one follows the conquests of Alexander the Great ; and the other , the fictional liberation of Egypt by Cleopatra . 
 During the game 's development , Stainless Steel Studios closed . They abandoned all their games , including Rise and Fall , which was near finishing . Rick Goodman , founder of Stainless Steel and the lead designer of Rise and Fall , reported that Midway stopped funding the game when its release date was pushed back by several months . Midway then decided to finish the game themselves . Reviews of the game were mixed ; it won two awards , and was commercially successful in the United Kingdom . 
 On October 16 , 2008 , Midway released a free , ad @-@ supported version of the game , supported by the US Air Force . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Featuring mainly RTS , but also third @-@ person and — with a few heroes only — first @-@ person shooter scenarios , the gameplay in Rise and Fall is unique . The goal of the game is to defeat the opponent ( s ) , which is done by first micromanaging a base , and then training an army to destroy the enemy 's position . Both land and sea units are available , allowing for different strategies , including amphibious warfare . As in most RTS games , units fight using a rock , paper , scissors method , meaning some soldiers are more capable of defeating a certain kind of enemy , while being defeated by another ( <unk> cavalry defeat archers , archers defeat spearmen , spearmen defeat cavalry ) . 
 Military units in Rise and Fall are grouped as infantry , cavalry , special , siege , or naval . Infantry , cavalry , and some special units automatically group themselves into formations — groups of soldiers that receive attack and defense bonuses — when at least eight of that kind of unit is present ; the maximum number of units a formation may consist of is sixty @-@ four . The unit 's speed , attack , defensive capabilities , and range vary , depending on several factors ; these include their civilization ; unit type ; the upgrades that have been purchased ; whether or not they are in formation , and , if so , its size . Three resources — wood , gold , and glory — are used to build structures , train units , purchase upgrades ; a fourth resource , stamina , is spent using " hero mode . " Wood and gold are deposited in settlements , or one of their various upgrades , such as town centers . Glory and stamina are both earned : glory by building and fighting , and stamina when the hero unit kills an enemy . In several RTS games , upgrades — sometimes called " Ages " — are available that represent time periods or technological levels ; Rise and Fall uses a similar concept . When upgrades to the hero — called " Levels " in this game — are purchased with glory , new technologies , upgrades , units , and advisors are unlocked . Advisors — paid for with glory as well — provide civilization @-@ specific benefits and bonuses to the player 's army and economy . Outposts , guarded by artificial intelligence soldiers , — soldiers who defend automatically — also play an important part in Rise and Fall . Conquering outposts increases the number of units trained from military buildings or ships , while not augmenting their price . The outpost guardians , however , protect it , and reappear until the outpost is taken by a player ; once captured , they protect the outpost from attacks by the owner 's enemies . 
 Another feature in Rise and Fall is " hero mode , " which allows the player to temporarily take control of a hero , as if in a third @-@ person shooter game ; certain heroes — for instance , Cleopatra — can zoom in further than others with their bow , allowing the player to aim as if in a first @-@ person shooter game . In hero mode , the hero unit becomes much more powerful , often allowing the player to destroy multiple enemy formations . Stamina is required to use this mode , however , and is lost quickly during its duration . The longest a player can spend in hero mode varies with stamina levels , which is increased with upgrades to the hero . To balance the game , hero mode can be used much less than RTS mode . Each civilization has two heroes from which to choose , usually a famous leader in history , — such as Alexander the Great — but sometimes pertaining to mythology — such as Achilles . 
 Rise and Fall may be played in both single @-@ player and multiplayer . In single @-@ player games , only one human player may play , against one through seven computer players . If more than two players will play , they may be grouped into teams , which can be chosen to be either permanent or manageable during the game using diplomacy . Other options available before beginning a game include the " population capacity " ; — the number of units that are trainable — which map of the twenty @-@ four to play on ; the difficulty setting ; the number of resources given at the start ; and the color and civilization of all players . Rise and Fall 's multiplayer component is powered by GameSpy , and may be played by anyone who has updated his or her version of the game . Players may host or join matches through either the internet or LAN . The host of the game chooses the options , while the player ( s ) who join the game either agree to the conditions , or reject them ; the match begins when all players agree with the host 's terms . Each player may select his own civilization and color , and does not require the host to change them . The multiplayer was discussed on the forums of Rise and Fall Heaven , a popular strategy game fansite . It was said that it is not frequented by many players , and that matches are often difficult to begin due to indecisiveness . During a game , the rules previously agreed upon are often broken by one or more players , leading to unruliness . Despite these drawbacks , several players reported that they played multiplayer . 
 = = Campaigns = = 
 Rise and Fall includes two campaigns , which are divided into acts containing from two to four chapters each ; a chapter comprises a battle and a cinematic . The first campaign follows Alexander the Great on his quest to defeat the allegiance of his brother , and the Persian general , Memnon . The second campaign features Cleopatra , and her attempts to repel a Roman invasion by Octavian . 
 The Alexander the Great campaign recounts the young king 's conquest of Asia . The beginning cinematic is of the killing of Philip II of Macedon , Alexander 's father , and introduces Alexander as a naive and unprepared prince , who is challenged by the duties thrust upon him . Alexander decides to follow the advice of his tutor , Aristotle , by quelling rebellions in Greece and its territories , as well as forming an allegiance with Parmenion . He then follows his brother — who had left to Persia — by sea , and faces off against the army and navy of General Memnon . Captured by deceit , Alexander escapes , but only after fighting in an amphitheatre . He then begins to sack Persian cities , and takes a temple containing the Bow of Heracles , a mythical weapon of immense power . Alexander eventually captures his brother , and executes him for treason . Finally , during the Siege of Tyre ( 332 BC ) , Alexander defeats Memnon , and is portrayed as having earned his kingdom . By now , Alexander has matured , and his men hold him in high esteem . 
 The Cleopatra campaign focuses on Cleopatra VII and her efforts to drive out an invasion by Octavian . As the Roman legions take control of much of Egypt , Cleopatra , her lover Mark Antony , and her brother Ptolemy free areas under Roman rule . Antony distrusts Ptolemy however , believing him to be in league with Rome . Meanwhile , Cleopatra defeats several of Octavian 's legions , causing him to send one of his best generals to eliminate her . After an expedition to Nubia , Cleopatra and the Egyptians gain the ability to train war elephants , a gift from the Nubian queen . Ptolemy is found guilty of treason , as Mark Antony suspected , and is arrested . He escapes , killing the guards , but is recaptured . Before being executed , he says he did not kill the guards , and escaped only to save himself ; he blames a priest , Tor , for being allied with Rome and killing his guards . The warrior priest kills two more guards as soon as he hears this , before Mark Antony attacks him . Tor quickly kills Antony , and escapes . Bent on revenge , Cleopatra tracks him down and defeats him , along with many Romans and Egyptian traitors . Octavian 's general soon arrives with his legions , but is defeated multiple times . Octavian , tired of his defeats , kills him before the Roman armies , setting an example for his men . The Emperor himself then leads the attack on Alexandria , and plunders the city until Cleopatra arrives . Then , he and Cleopatra fight ; the Egyptian queen slays Octavian , but is mortally wounded , and dies moments after having freed Egypt . Ptolemy buries his sister in a pyramid , and many Egyptians attend her funeral procession .

 Rise and Fall was mainly developed by Stainless Steel Studios ( SSSI ) from 2005 to early 2006 . Stainless Steel was founded in 1998 , by Rick Goodman and other Age of Empires designers . Before working on Rise and Fall , they had released Empire Earth and Empires : Dawn of the Modern World , two commercially successful titles . In addition , they created two game engines , the Titan , and its upgrade , the Titan 2 @.@ 0 . 
 Rise and Fall uses the Titan 2 @.@ 0 engine to run . It includes many features , such as the game 's scenario editor , graphics , and artificial intelligence . The engine also powers the multiplayer mode , and handles all objects in the game world . 
 The scenario editor for Rise and Fall is similar to that used in Empires : Dawn of the Modern World , though Stainless Steel claims it has been improved . Features from the Empire Earth editor were re @-@ introduced into that of Rise and Fall , and new ones were added as well . The editor handles flora in an advanced way , and has improved its movement . Ranger , a Stainless Steel Studios staff member , announced that all units — including the hero — will be editable using triggers ; in Titan editors , triggers can alter unit statistics and features , allowing for many alterations to the game . The editor also allows the existing maps to be edited , and new ones created . The developers of Rise and Fall created the campaigns using the built in editor , meaning that experienced enthusiasts and modders of the game have the option of creating new missions . 
 The developers , however , did not finish the game due to the sudden closure of Stainless Steel . Goodman blamed Midway Games , the publisher , for not funding the project , which led to the firing of employees . A GameSpot news article on the subject read , " He [ Goodman ] reportedly told <unk> that after the PC strategy game 's release was pushed from October to early 2006 , Midway cut off advances to Stainless Steel , which in turn had to lay off its staff due to lack of funding . " As former AI programmer Daniel Higgins said , " This is true , SSSI is no more . I can 't give details as to why , but I can tell you the product is in excellent shape , the team was in high morale and plowing ahead at full steam , and we were just weeks from gold disk . " To complete the game , Midway , the publisher , shuffled it to their San Diego studios , where it was finished . As The Armchair Empire said in its review , " Overall , Rise & Fall feels like an unfinished product . Besides AI that often lines up to be killed , the engine powering the game stutters often . After doing a bit of research , this can probably be traced back to the financial woes of publisher Midway . Close to going " gold " developer Stainless Steel Studios ceased operation due to insufficient funds , Midway shuffled the project internally . The lack of polish is the result . "

 Rise and Fall was received by critics with both positive and negative scores , with an average rating — according to Game Rankings — of 65 % ( 78th PC game of 2006 ) . PC Gamer UK called it " Pure 24 @-@ carat gaming gold ! " Games Radar said " This RTS has its ups and downs ... " , while Games Radar UK said " The RTS Rubicon has been crossed . " GameSpot remarked that " this game doesn 't quite know what it wants to be . " ; IGN stated that " ... there 's very little reason to recommend this title to fans of the strategy or action genres . " 
 The graphics were examined by the reviewers . Games Radar admired them , having said " Rise & Fall is about pretty units killing each other in a beautifully drawn environment ... " GameSpy reported that they " are way behind the curve " ; GameSpot agreed , saying : " Buildings and units seem boxy and chunky , suffering from a low number of polygons , while the textures themselves look grainy . " 
 The sound in the game fared well in the reviews . GameSpot said of the music " The game sounds better , at least , thanks to some appropriately pompous Gladiator @-@ style music . " IGN reported that " Music is decent , and voice @-@ overs are passable , but sound effects need some serious help . " 
 The campaign was also criticized , and was said to have " poorly rendered , incomprehensible cutscenes filled with bad dialogue and characters that seemed to swagger like they were walking down Main Street in a Western @-@ movie gunfight " by GameSpy ; IGN agreed , reporting that " the cutscenes are also presented as pre @-@ rendered engine movies compressed to questionable quality . " GameSpot said that the hero @-@ only levels required " ... a vast amount of patience , the reflexes of a teenager , and a good deal of luck , " and that the campaigns are " bound to turn off strategy fans " . IGN complained that " these levels take a long damn time to load ... " 
 Naval warfare was thoroughly reviewed as well . GameSpy enjoyed it , saying " The game also puts a new spin on naval combat ... when everything goes just right with ship movement ... this is a blast . " On the other hand , IGN thought it was not well done , and wrote that " One of the features that looked fairly tasty was naval combat and some aspects of it are nice ... Unfortunately it 's another case of execution not coming through . Pro @-@ G agreed , and did not enjoy the naval side of the game at all , complaining that " ... it 's often near impossible to dock on dry land . " , and that " numerous boats in your fleet ... complicate things further , with the path finding AI seemingly unable to navigate around other boats in anything but huge stretches of open water . " 
 Hero mode was also praised by some , and depreciated by others . Games Radar thought , " ... it ’ s cool to pick off enemy soldiers in first person ... " , while Pro @-@ G 's impression was that " Hero mode is a good idea that 's gone badly wrong . " IGN said that " the lack of personality , special combat moves , and the fun factor that most action games focus on really makes hero mode dull . " GameSpot was more forgiving ; they thought that " In small doses , hero command is a nice feature that lets you vent some steam by hacking and slashing mindlessly . But when it 's the basis of an entire level it can be maddening ... " GameSpy had mixed opinions ; they began saying that " the Hero ... is a genuinely fun part of the game as well as a key element of the player 's strategy . " , but then shifted to a more negative view : " Once players get past the visceral thrill of being able to buzzsaw through enemy armies ... they 'll realize that such moments are pretty few and far between . " Finally , they mentioned that " the hero controls are a bit <unk> , and the game 's collision detection in third @-@ person mode is kind of wonky . " 
 Overall , the opinions of reviewers seem to have been summed up by Pro @-@ G : " One day someone is going to combine the RTS with another genre and pull it off really well ; Rise & Fall isn 't that game . The basic RTS elements are sound , but the hero mode verges on awful , boat control is a nightmare , and the campaigns are dull ... There are so many other games out there that offer a better all @-@ round RTS experience , there 's really no reason to bother with Midway 's effort . Some praise must be given for trying something a little different , but Rise & Fall is another idea that falls a long way short of its potential . " 
 = = = Awards and popularity = = = 
 Rise and Fall received two notable awards , and achieved high sales in the United Kingdom . It was one of the winners in the " E3 2005 : Best of Show " , hosted by The Wargamer . They were impressed with the game , and complimented its innovation : " ... real @-@ time strategy games are simply wars between faceless and lifeless armies . Sure , it ’ s nice to put a zillion units on the game screen and watch them run into each other , but too often these games blend together because they lack personality . Stainless Steel Studios seems to have solved that problem in Rise & Fall , their new historical strategy game which allows players to not only control massive armies at war , but also jump into the shoes of the heroes themselves ... " . The other award won by Rise and Fall was in the " Strategy " category at the British Academy Video Games Awards . According to the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association ( <unk> ) , Rise and Fall became one of the best @-@ selling games in the United Kingdom soon after its release , and it remained in the top ten for two months . 
 = Henry Taylor ( swimmer ) = 
 Henry Taylor ( 17 March 1885 – 28 February 1951 ) was an English competitive swimmer who represented Great Britain in four Summer Olympics between 1906 and 1920 . Taylor served in the Royal Navy during the First World War , and continued to swim competitively until 1926 . His fortunes declined after he retired and he died penniless . His record of three gold medals at one Olympic Games – the most by any Briton – stood for 100 years until it was equaled by cyclist Chris Hoy in 2008 . Tying the medal count of American Mel Sheppard , he was the most successful athlete at the 1908 Olympics . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Henry Taylor was born in Hollinwood in Oldham , Lancashire , on 17 March 1885 to James , a coal miner , and Elizabeth Taylor . Henry 's parents died when he was young and he was raised by his older brother , Bill . Taylor learned to swim in the Hollinwood Canal , and practised in any water body he could find – baths , <unk> , canals , lakes , etc . , including the Hollinwood Canal and Alexandra Park 's boating lake . Austin Rawlinson , who was Taylor 's friend and later president of Amateur Swimming Association , recalled that Taylor " loved his swimming more than anything else in life " . At the age of seven Taylor swam in his first race . 
 Bill became his coach and Henry trained in the Oldham Baths , and from 1894 in the Chadderton Baths , often on the " dirty water days " because of cheaper admission . During this time he continued to train in the canal and when he got a job at a cotton mill , he spent his lunch times swimming in the canal . At 5 ' 5 " ( 1 @.@ 65 m ) and weighing 10 stone 6 pounds ( 66 kg ) , he wore a hand @-@ woven silk swimming costume weighing about an ounce . 
 = = Career = = 
 Taylor came to attention after success with Chadderton Swimming Club . He was selected for the 1906 Intercalated Games in Athens . Although he was not expected to win any medals he won gold in the one mile freestyle , a silver in the 400 m freestyle and a bronze in the 4 × 250 m freestyle . Later that year , Taylor broke the world record for 880 yards ( 800 m ) . He was an automatic selection for the 1908 Summer Olympics . 
 During the 1908 Summer Olympics in London , Taylor won gold medals in the three events in which he took part : the 400 m freestyle , the 4 × 200 m freestyle , and the 1500 m freestyle . He finished first in all of the races he took part in during the games bar one . After performing well in the heats of the 400 m freestyle , he finished second in the semi @-@ final to Austrian Otto Scheff , who won the same event in the 1906 Intercalated Games . However , in the final Taylor finished 10 seconds ahead of the Austrian who won the bronze . The British press hailed Taylor as " Britain 's Greatest Amateur Swimmer " . He was the first man to hold the world record for the 1500 metres freestyle , a feat that he completed on 25 July 1908 in a time of 22 : 48 @.@ 4 in London . His haul of three was the most gold medals won by any Briton at the Olympics . This feat was not repeated by any British participant in the Olympic Games for a century until Chris Hoy won three gold medals in cycling events at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing . 
 Four years later , Taylor was selected for the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm . In the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay , he helped his team win bronze . There were no Olympic Games in 1916 because of the First World War . Taylor joined the Royal Navy in 1914 and kept fit by swimming around the ships when his ship was anchored at Scapa Flow . He was present at the Battle of Jutland . A popular story tells that during the course of the battle , his ship , HMS St. Vincent , was sunk and while the survivors waited for two hours to be rescued , Taylor swam around encouraging his crewmates . However , this story is probably a myth as HMS St Vincent was not sunk at the Battle of Jutland . He was transferred to HMS Ramillies where he remained until he was demobilised . 
 After the war , Taylor returned to swimming . He took part in the Morecambe Bay Race , winning eight times over a period of 20 year and at one point held the record . Taylor attempted to emulate Matthew Webb in swimming across the English Channel but failed due to bad weather . He annually took on the French champion , swimming in the River Thames and the River Seine and winning on every occasion . Taylor 's last appearance in the Olympic Games was at Antwerp , Belgium , in 1920 when he again helped the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay team to a bronze medal . 
 = = After swimming = = 
 Taylor continued swimming competitively into his 40s until he retired in 1926 . He also played water polo for England . During his career he won over 35 trophies and 300 medals . He suffered a setback when the public house , the <unk> , he owned in <unk> was closed due to financial difficulties . Taylor became an attendant at Chadderton Baths . To raise money , Taylor was forced to sell most of his prizes . He died in obscurity aged 65 on 28 February 1951 , at lodgings in Brierley Street , Chadderton , he was penniless and unmarried . He was cremated and his remains were scattered at Rochdale Cemetery . 
 The trophies Taylor won were collected and temporarily displayed at Chadderton Baths . In 1969 he was posthumously inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame . In 2002 , a blue plaque was unveiled at Chadderton Baths commemorating his swimming achievements . At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , China , Rebecca Adlington became the first British swimmer to win more than one gold medal at a single Olympic Games since Taylor won three in 1908 . 
 = Gawsworth Old Hall = 
 Gawsworth Old Hall is a Grade I listed country house in the village of Gawsworth , Cheshire , England . It is a timber @-@ framed house in the Cheshire black @-@ and @-@ white style . The present house was built between 1480 and 1600 , replacing an earlier Norman house . It was probably built as a courtyard house enclosing a quadrangle , but much of it has been demolished , leaving the house with a U @-@ shaped plan . The present hall was owned originally by the Fitton family , and later by the Gerards , and then the <unk> . Since the 1930s it has been in the possession of the Richards family . Raymond Richards collected a number of items from other historic buildings and incorporated them into the hall . 
 Notable residents have included Mary Fitton , perhaps the " Dark Lady " of Shakespeare 's sonnets , and Samuel " Maggoty " Johnson , a playwright described as the last professional jester in England , whose grave is nearby in Maggoty Wood , a small National Trust woodland . In 1712 a dispute about the ownership of the Gawsworth estate culminated in a duel , in which both the combatants were killed . 
 The hall is surrounded by formal gardens and parkland , which once comprised an Elizabethan pleasure garden and , possibly , a tilting ground for jousting . The grounds are listed Grade II * , and contain four Grade II listed buildings , including the Gatehouse , gatepiers , and garden walls . The hall and grounds are open to the public at advertised times , and events are organised . During the summer months a series of concerts and other entertainment is arranged in an open @-@ air theatre near the hall . 
 = = History = = 
 The original house on the site dated from the Norman era . The earliest documentary reference is the granting of a licence for the administration of a chapel within the house in 1365 . The house was then owned by Thomas Fitton , who had inherited it by marriage in 1316 , and it remained in the possession of the Fitton family until 1611 . The original house was replaced in the 15th and 16th centuries . Building started in 1480 , and continued in stages until about 1600 . Since then , parts of the house have been demolished , and others have been considerably altered . It is considered by the architectural historians Peter de Figueiredo and Julian Treuherz that the site of the house was originally moated , and that its plan was that of a quadrangle , forming a courtyard house . 
 In 1579 the house was inherited by Sir Edward Fitton III on the death of his father , Sir Edward Fitton II . Sir Edward III was the father of Mary Fitton , a maid of honour to Queen Elizabeth and a candidate for the " Dark Lady " of Shakespeare 's sonnets . Following the death of Sir Edward Fitton , 2nd Baronet in 1643 , the estate passed to Sir Charles Gerard , later the first Earl of Macclesfield . There was a dispute about the legal ownership of the estate between Sir Charles and his cousin Alexander Fitton , which seemed to be settled by 1663 . Demolition of parts of the house took place in about 1700 , and it is thought by de Figueiredo and Treuherz that the west range was removed , possibly including the gatehouse . At the beginning of the 18th century the dispute between the <unk> and the Gerards resurfaced , culminating in a duel in Hyde Park , London , in 1712 between the rival claimants : Lord Mohun , from the Gerard family , and the 4th Duke of Hamilton , from the <unk> . Both of the combatants were killed . The estate remained with the Gerards , until it was bought by William Stanhope , who later became the first Earl of Harrington , and it remained with this family until 1935 . The house was owned by the Cheshire antiquary Raymond Richards until his death in 1978 . Richards collected items from historic buildings that were being demolished in the 1960s , either incorporating them into the house or displaying them in the grounds . The house is still owned and run by the Richards family .

 Gawsworth Old Hall is a timber @-@ framed house in the Cheshire black @-@ and @-@ white tradition , roofed in Kerridge sandstone . It has been estimated that the weight of the roof may be in excess of 300 long tons ( 300 t ) . The house is in mainly in two storeys . In the north range , and on the south front , the timber frame has been encased in brick , with timbering applied to its outer surface . Internally the roof trusses have been retained . Its plan is that of a U @-@ shape with its open side facing the west , towards what was the courtyard . The main entrance is in the north range , leading into the Entrance Hall . To the west of this is the Library , and to the east , the Morning Room . The Entrance Hall leads into the longest range , the eastern range , consisting of the Long Hall , at the north end , and the Dining Room . The Long Hall was originally the Great Hall , and was open to the roof , but is now divided into two floors . To the east of the range extend the kitchen and the chapel . The Dining Room leads into a room now known as the Green Room , which is canted ten degrees to the east . This was also originally open to the roof , but was not a great hall . De Figueiredo and Treuherz are of the opinion that this was originally a larger , separate structure , probably a barn , and incorporated into the main building when the east range was built . Little of the south range remains . It originally contained domestic apartments , which formerly extended to join the now @-@ demolished west range . In the angle between the Dining Room and what remains of the south range is the Drawing Room . The special feature of this room is a canted bay window on the north side , extending upwards for three storeys . The only dated item in the building is the Fitton coat of arms on the north front , which was carved by Richard <unk> in 1570 . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 Many of the original features have been lost as a consequence of the many changes that have taken place over the centuries . Additional features have been added to the interior by Raymond Richards , such as the doorcase around the entrance . The Entrance Hall has retained its medieval shape and low ceiling . It contains the coat of arms of the Richards family and items of weaponry , including a decorative suit of armour dating from the 19th century and moved here from Scarisbrick Hall . To the west of the Entrance Hall is the Library . This is in the shape of a double cube , measuring 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) by 32 feet ( 9 @.@ 8 m ) . Its major item is a richly carved Tudor chimneypiece . The bookcases were designed by A. W. N. Pugin . Both of these items were moved here by Raymond Richards , the bookcases coming from Scarisbrick Hall . The bookcases contain a comprehensive collection of books relating to Cheshire . In a corner cabinet is a flint axe head dating from about 2000 BC . This was discovered in the park nearby in 1912 . To the south of the Entrance Hall is the Long Hall . This has retained the fireplace and ceiling introduced in the Tudor era . The hall contains items of antique furniture , and paintings by David Wilkie , J. M. W. Turner and John Constable . To the south of the Long Hall is the principal staircase , which was remodelled in 1920 . The area around the staircase contains a Waterford glass chandelier dating from about 1780 , and a portrait of the first Earl of Harrington by Allan Ramsay . From this area , a door leads into the chapel . This is the third or fourth chapel in the house , and was dedicated to Thomas More when he was canonised in 1935 . Much of the woodwork in it dates from 1803 . Many of the ornaments in the chapel were brought here by Richards from a redundant church in Ipswich . Two marble plaques in the chapel are by Thomas Thornycroft , a sculptor born in the nearby village . Alongside the chapel is an ambulatory or baptistry which contains a font and items of stained glass , made by Morris & Co. and designed by Edward Burne @-@ Jones . These were obtained by Richards from All Saints Church , Birkenhead . They depict the Crucifixion , and Saints Agnes , George , Stephen and Alban . The south door contains fragments of ancient glass from Plas Newydd , that were originally in a medieval church . Adjacent to the chapel is a conservatory containing marble sculptures by John Warrington Wood . 
 To the south of the Long Hall is the Dining Room , which is little changed since the Tudor era . Its contents include a 16th @-@ century refectory table , an oak <unk> from about 1650 , and items of Wedgwood <unk> ware made in about 1830 . The Dining Room leads to the small Guard Room , which contains two 17th @-@ century chairs and an 18th @-@ century blunderbuss . To the west of this is the Drawing Room , the principal living room of the hall which has been little altered since the middle of the 16th century . To the south of the Drawing Room is a small room known as the Gold Room . This room has retained a frieze dating from the early 16th century , including carvings of Tudor roses , flowers and birds . Also in the room is a bust of Charles Gerard . In the southeast corner of the hall is the Green Room . This contains a painting of Gawsworth Rectory by Charles Tattershall Dodd , and a complete set of a dinner service by Minton , comprising 120 pieces . 
 A staircase from the east of the Guard Room leads to the Gallery on the upper floor , to the south side of which is the Solar , containing a 16th @-@ century four @-@ poster bed known as the Boswell bed . It was formerly in Lympne Castle , Kent . The house 's principal bedroom is the Hall Room , much of which has survived from the early 16th century . It contains a four @-@ poster bed from the era of William and Mary and a portrait by <unk> of members of the Fitton family , which was formerly in Brereton Hall . A room next to the Hall Room has been converted into a modern bathroom , next to which is Mary Fitton 's Bedroom , which contains an old plaster frieze . The other rooms on floor are the French Room , containing an 18th @-@ century French bed , and a small bedroom known as the Griffin Room . Adjacent to this is the Billiard Room , which has exposed roof timbers . As well as the billiard table , the room contains a marble sculpture of Echo by Alfred Gatley and a bust of John Milton .

 Associated with the house is an inner garden of about 30 acres ( 12 ha ) surrounded by a parkland of about 600 acres ( 240 ha ) ; both are enclosed by walls . To the south of the hall the inner garden comprises a modern formal garden occupying the site of the original 16th @-@ century formal garden . Beyond this , in the parkland , are the earthworks of an earlier garden . The parkland is almost square in shape , with a section curving out from the south border . It consists of " one huge grassed area " with " lumps and bumps " . The Cheshire historian George Ormerod , writing in 1819 , considered that this area contained a tilting ground for jousting . That claim is repeated in the hall 's official guidebook , which goes on to suggest that it was created in the hope that Queen Elizabeth I would visit the hall on her royal progress , but she never did so . There is some doubt regarding the dating of the creation of the garden , but it is generally accepted that it comprised an Elizabethan pleasure garden . A raised mound of earth in the southwest corner of the garden would have been used to view the garden from an elevated position . A corresponding mound at the southeast corner was removed during the Second World War . To the west of the hall a wooded area known as the Rookery contains mature lime trees . Limited excavation work carried out in 1989 – 90 discovered , inter alia , a filled @-@ in canal running in a north @-@ south axis down the centre of the garden . The excavations provided " a tremendous insight into the past , although not enough to date it with certainty " . To the north of the hall are four fish ponds . 
 = = = Structures = = = 
 Four structures in the grounds around the hall are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed buildings ; Grade II listing means that a building or structure is considered to be " nationally important and of special interest " . The 17th @-@ century Gatehouse is constructed in brick with ashlar dressings and a stone slate roof , in two storeys and three bays . The gate piers date from the late 17th or early 18th century . They are in painted ashlar surmounted by 20th @-@ century ball finials . The garden walls were built in the 16th century , with later additions and alterations . They are constructed in brick with ashlar dressings . At the southern end is a large rectangular enclosure . In nearby woodland are the grave and memorial to Samuel " Maggoty " Johnson , a playwright said to have been the last professional jester in England , who lived in the hall and died in 1773 aged 82 . A table tomb over the grave consists of an inscribed stone slab on a brick plinth . Adjacent to it is another inscribed stone slab , dating from the 19th century .

 Gawsworth Old Hall is south of the village of Gawsworth , 3 miles ( 5 km ) southeast of Macclesfield . Immediately to the west is the Grade I listed Church of St James , to the north beyond a fish pond is the Grade II * listed Gawsworth New Hall , and nearby is the Grade I listed Gawsworth Old Rectory . The Old Hall was listed Grade I on 25 July 1952 . Grade I listing is granted to buildings of " exceptional interest , sometimes considered to be internationally important " , and encompasses only 2 @.@ 5 percent of all listed buildings . The grounds have been designated Grade II * in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens . Designation as Grade II * means that the site is " particularly important , of more than special interest " . 
 The hall is open to the general public at advertised times . A series of events is held in the grounds and in the hall during the year . There is a licensed tea room in the grounds , and the hall is also licensed for civil weddings . Ceremonies are conducted in the Long Hall , and receptions can be held in a marquee in the grounds . During the summer months plays , concerts and other entertainments take place in the open @-@ air theatre close to the hall . 
 = Hebden , North Yorkshire = 
 Hebden ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ <unk> ) is a village and civil parish in the Craven district of North Yorkshire , England , and one of four villages in the ecclesiastical parish of Linton . It lies near Grimwith Reservoir and Grassington , in Wharfedale in the Yorkshire Dales National Park . In 2011 it had a population of 230 . 
 Hebden has a church , a chapel , a hotel and public house , a tea room , a community hall , a small general store associated with the pub , and is well served by buses . Until 1983 it had a primary school . Hebden straddles a cross roads . The east @-@ west <unk> road connects it with Grassington 1 @.@ 7 miles ( 2 @.@ 7 km ) to the west , and from there south to the market town of Skipton , 11 @.@ 5 miles ( 18 @.@ 5 km ) from Hebden . To the east , the road crosses a bridge over Hebden Gill , built in 1827 , and thence over the watershed to <unk> Bridge in Nidderdale , 8 @.@ 5 miles ( 13 @.@ 7 km ) distant . 
 Main Street , the village high street , continues south as Mill Lane , towards the bank of the River Wharfe and the villages of <unk> and Burnsall , the latter being just over 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) away . The road to the north runs to the small hamlet of Hole Bottom , from there continuing as a track onto Grassington Moor . 
 The layout of the village largely originates from manorial times , but during the 19th century the village grew to become a substantial industrial community with lead mining and a cotton mill as the main sources of employment . Since then it has reverted to a rural community , and is a focal point for walkers and cyclists wishing to enjoy the local countryside . 
 = = History = = 
 The name Hebden may be derived from either <unk> , Old English for a rose @-@ hip or <unk> , Old English for a bramble , and dene , Old English for a valley , or from the Scandinavian <unk> , a topographical description of a ridge forming an elevated site above a small valley . Two Bronze Age stone circles and remnants of huts on the moors above the village show that the area has been settled since earliest times , and a hoard of 33 silver <unk> dating from 30 to 170 AD found in a local field indicates that the Romans had a presence . The hoard is now on display at the Craven Museum & Gallery . An Iron Age or Romano @-@ British settlement has been tentatively identified on the banks of Gate Up Gill on the moors to the north @-@ west of the village . Place names such as Scale Haw indicate the Norse left their influence . There is no documentary record of the area until a mention in the Domesday Book of 1086 , in which the settlement was referred to as <unk> held by Osbern d <unk> , of Thorpe Arch . At the time of the Conquest the land was held by <unk> , which is a Nordic name . 
 During medieval times , an important east @-@ west droving route used to move sheep between winter pastures around Fountains Abbey and summer pastures around <unk> , crossed the Hebden Beck at Hebden . It broadly followed the line of the North Craven Fault avoiding the moorland peat bogs , and became a busy packhorse route for traders . 
 Although no property in the village is older than the early 17th century , its layout reflects its development in medieval times as a planned village . Eight toft compartments are discernible to the west of Main Street , and the outline of the four surrounding common fields , now divided , may be identified from the pattern of dry stone walls . The fields were largely arable , providing the village with most of its food requirements , but are now farmed exclusively for pasture and hay . The village manor house was on land now occupied by Hebden Hall at the south end of Main Street . 
 The last stretch of Hebden Beck before it reaches the River Wharfe was used to power a corn mill in the Middle Ages , and corn milling survived into the middle of the 19th century . In the 14th century Fountains Abbey had a fulling mill in the village . In 1791 a three @-@ storey cotton mill was built alongside the corn mill . It housed 54 spinning frames and was productive until 1870 when it was driven out of business by the more efficient stream @-@ driven machinery of the industrial revolution . At its peak , the mill employed more than 70 men , women , and children . The building was used for other purposes including a roller skating rink until it was demolished in 1967 . 
 Lead mining on Grassington Moor became important in the 18th century , and as a result of the mines ' success , a number of the mine owners promoted the provision of the Grassington to <unk> Bridge turnpike road , which was begun in 1760 and provided an all @-@ weather route across the moors for wagons . From the early 19th century Hebden was a dormitory village for some miners , contributing to the population rising to more than 500 in the 1830s . In the early 1850s profitable mines were established in the parish to the north of the village on veins associated with Grassington Moor , which helped sustain the population . Although activity continued sporadically into the last decade of the century , the accessible ore was largely exhausted by 1865 , and the population declined to a low of 199 in 1901 . 
 As the freeholders shared the mineral royalties , the mines brought prosperity which gave rise to the remodelling and redevelopment of much of the village . Green Terrace , which includes the old post office , was built in the 1870s , and Main Street was transformed from a back lane into the high street . The village school , with working clock and bell tower , was built by the community in 1874 , and the stone @-@ built Ibbotson Institute , now the community hall , was completed in 1903 . 
 The coming of the Yorkshire Dales Railway to <unk> in 1902 opened up Hebden as a destination for day visitors and holiday makers . A purpose @-@ built timber guest house was opened in 1909 at the south end of the village by the Co @-@ operative Holiday Association , founded by Thomas Arthur Leonard . It passed into private hands in 1960 , and continued as a holiday centre until 1990 , mainly catering for school parties . The village stores and post office shut at the end of 2013 after 100 years of trading , and a new store associated with the public house opened at the beginning of 2014 , currently run as a community shop . The gold painted George V Type B wall post box was removed from the outside wall of the post office , and replaced with a modern gold painted lamp box a few metres away ; and the K6 Tudor Crown phone box was decommissioned , and set up at the cross @-@ roads as a street ornament . 
 Although it now has a number of second homes , holiday cottages and commuters , with eight working farms , a fish farm , coach and haulage companies , Hebden remains a working and thriving community .

 Hebden was a township in the parish of Linton , part of the east division of the wapentake of <unk> and <unk> in the historic county of the West Riding of Yorkshire . It became a separate civil parish in Skipton Rural District in 1866 as a result of the enactment of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1866 . In 1974 it was transferred to Craven District in North Yorkshire as the result of the enactment of the Local Government Act 1972 . 
 Hebden lies in the Skipton and Ripon Parliamentary Constituency , a seat held by Julian Smith MP for the Conservative ; and in the Mid @-@ Craven electoral division of North Yorkshire County Council , represented by Conservative party member , Shelagh Marshall . Hebden is in the Grassington ward of Craven District , a non @-@ metropolitan district , which is represented by Richard Foster for the Conservative party . As it is located within the Yorkshire Dales National Park , the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority is the local planning authority for the area . 
 Hebden has a parish council with five independent members supported by a parish clerk . Elections are held every four years , the most recent in 2016 . Council meetings are held every six weeks . The parish council 's activities are largely funded by income from parish lands in the form of rent , grants , and easements . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The south @-@ east boundary of Hebden parish is the River Wharfe , 500 feet ( 150 m ) above sea level , and the north @-@ east boundary runs along the Wharfedale @-@ Nidderdale watershed , reaching a height of 1 @,@ 770 feet ( 540 m ) . The upper section of the eastern boundary is Gate Up Gill , one of the main inflows of Grimwith Reservoir . The parish approximates a parallelogram in shape , averaging under 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) in width and some 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) in length . To the north , the land rises away from Hebden to the 2 @,@ 310 feet ( 700 m ) summit of Great Whernside , some 7 miles ( 11 km ) distant . 
 The habitations and main farming areas are largely confined to the Wharfe valley , and the rest of the parish is mainly rough moorland pasture . The village is on one of several branches of the North Craven Fault where Hebden Beck emerges from the moors through a steep @-@ sided valley into the Wharfe valley , on an ancient east @-@ west route . 
 Hebden Beck rises on Grassington Moor some 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) from the village , but the main valley continues north as a dry valley , until it reaches <unk> Caverns and the upper flanks of Great Whernside . 
 The geology is dominated by rocks Carboniferous in age but , as the parish straddles a complex section of the North Craven Fault , it is varied . To the north @-@ east of the village the rocks are predominantly Bowland sandstones and shales , and to the south @-@ east are largely massive limestones . The River Wharfe runs across the limestone , through an impressive gorge at Loup Scar . The mineral veins of the Bowland series have been exploited for lead ore .

 Hebden is a centre for walking and cycling in Upper Wharfedale . It has an inn , a shop , and a tea room cater for visitors , and within walking distance are the Dales villages of <unk> , Burnsall , Thorpe , Linton and Grassington . A gold post box near the old post office commemorates the 2012 Olympic Games rowing gold medal won by Andrew Triggs Hodge , who grew up in the village . Grimwith Reservoir , used for wind surfing , dinghy sailing , and bird watching , is 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) to the east along the <unk> , and 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) further is Stump Cross Caverns - a show cave . The Dales Cycle Way passes through Hebden on its way from <unk> to Grassington . 
 Because of its proximity to the Craven Fault , the scenery is varied . The Dales Way passes through the parish along the banks of the River Wharfe between Burnsall and Grassington , mainly through limestone pastures but occasionally , as at Loup Scar and Linton Falls , through limestone gorges and past waterfalls . It crosses the Wharfe at Hebden on a wrapped steel @-@ cable suspension bridge , a few yards upstream of the reconstructed course of medieval stepping stones . The bridge was built in 1885 by local blacksmith William Bell , and paid for by public subscription . Made of recycled materials , it originally had a central supporting pier ( the base of which can be seen in low water conditions ) , that was removed when the span was raised in 1937 after being damaged in a heavy flood . The bridge has been conserved and is a landmark on the river @-@ side path . 
 Hebden Beck flows down from Grassington Moor , which is dominated by the long @-@ abandoned remains of the lead mining industry , through a rugged and wooded gill , past the hamlet of Hole Bottom , made famous by William Riley 's novel Jerry and Ben , and then over the 16 feet ( 5 m ) Scala Falls . A popular walk is an 8 miles ( 13 km ) circuit up to Grassington Moor , and thence to Grassington , returning along the River Wharfe . South of Hebden , the edge of the limestone is heralded by a number of text @-@ book examples of reef knolls , including <unk> Hill , <unk> Hill , and Kail Hill , which are the conical remnants of limestone reef structures . Behind the reef knolls is a large expanse of Grassington Grit grouse moor , Thorpe Fell and Burnsall Fell , where walking may be enjoyed - especially around the edges . 
 = = Conservation area = = 
 In 2006 the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority designated Hebden a conservation area . In the proposal it was stated that : 
 " The special character of Hebden is defined by a historic settlement pattern of great significance together with a collection of important listed buildings and a group of unlisted buildings which , although essentially vernacular and humble in architectural terms , combine well together to create a harmonious and generally high quality environment of buildings , open spaces and tree cover . In addition , the setting is very distinctive with natural topography of surrounding hills and adjacent steep sided valley combining with a man made agricultural landscape of some age and significance in its own right . " 
 = = Sport = = 
 Hebden Sports Day is held annually on August Bank Holiday . Dating back to the nineteenth century , Hebden Sports provides a variety of running races , novelty races , and entertainments for all age groups . It has hosted the professional Hebden Fell Race since at least 1922 , which was a regular feature on the British Open Fell Runners Association calendar until 2013 . The village cricket team , the Hebden <unk> plays in the <unk> League , a league with its own set of idiosyncratic rules . Rugby union , football , and crown green bowling facilities are available at Grassington and <unk> .

 Hebden is part of the ecclesiastical parish of Linton in the Skipton deanery of the Diocese of Bradford , and its church was built as a chapel of ease to St Michael and All Angels Church in Linton in 1841 and dedicated to St Peter . Until then , parishioners attended church in Linton a distance of some 1 @.@ 5 mi ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) using the church path across fields to stepping stones crossing the Wharfe . St Peter 's Church was built on land donated by the Rev Henry Bailey , and was designed by the curate , the Rev. John Feron , in the Gothic Revival style . It is a Grade II listed building . Its pipe organ was built by Harrison & Harrison of Durham and was dedicated in 1894 . It was refurbished in 2010 by A. Carter of Wakefield , and has been granted a Grade II Historic Organ Certificate . 
 The Methodist church built in 1812 is part of the Skipton and Grassington Methodist Circuit . Because the congregations are small , Anglicans and Methodists share a single service on Sundays , alternating between the venues .

 Mi Reflejo ( English : My Reflection ) is the second studio album and first Spanish album by American singer Christina Aguilera . It was released on September 12 , 2000 by BMG U.S. Latin . After the commercial success of her debut studio effort , Christina Aguilera ( 1999 ) , Aguilera recorded her follow @-@ up project during 2000 . It includes five Spanish @-@ language versions of tracks from her previous album , in addition to four original compositions and two cover songs . The tracks were adapted and composed by Rudy Pérez who also produced the album . 
 In the United States , Mi Reflejo peaked at number @-@ one on the Billboard Top Latin Albums and Latin Pop Albums charts where it spent 19 weeks at the top of both charts . The album was the best @-@ selling Latin pop album of 2000 and was certified 6 × Platinum ( Latin field ) by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . It reached number two in Argentina and Uruguay , and has sold an estimated three million copies worldwide . 
 Upon its release , Mi Reflejo received generally mixed reviews from music critics , who noted musical similarities to Christina Aguilera . The album led to Aguilera receiving a Latin Grammy award for Best Female Pop Vocal Album , as well as a Grammy nomination , two Billboard Latin Music Awards , and a Lo Nuestro nomination . Three singles were released from the album : " Ven Conmigo ( Solamente Tú ) " , " Pero Me Acuerdo de Ti " and " Falsas Esperanzas " . To promote the album , Aguilera extended her tour , Christina Aguilera in Concert , into 2001 for eight more dates and performed at the 2001 Grammy Awards .

 According to her manager Steve Kurtz , Aguilera expressed interest in recording a Spanish @-@ language album before she recorded her debut studio album Christina Aguilera . At the time , Aguilera was simultaneously touring to promote her debut album and recording a Christmas album My Kind of Christmas , released later in 2000 . Mi Reflejo was intended to be titled Latin Lover Girl ; the title 's origin came from the Spanish version of the song " Reflection " , which Aguilera recorded for the soundtrack to Mulan . 
 = = Composition = = 
 In 1999 , she began recording in Miami with Cuban @-@ American producer Rudy Pérez . He co @-@ wrote the songs " Si No Te Hubiera Conocido " , " Cuando No es Contigo " , and " El Beso Del Final " . He also composed the Spanish versions of " Come On Over Baby ( All I Want Is You ) " ( " Ven Conmigo ( <unk> Tú ) " ) , " Genie in a Bottle " ( " Genio <unk> " ) , " I Turn to You " ( " Por Siempre Tu " ) , " What a Girl Wants " ( " Una Mujer " ) , and " Reflection " ( " Mi Reflejo " ) . Aguilera covers Perez 's song " Pero Me Acuerdo de Ti " , which was originally performed by Puerto Rican singer Lourdes Robles on her album Definitivamente ( 1991 ) . Pérez stated that Aguilera did not know any Spanish while recording ; he remedied the problem by phonetically writing out lyrics and included a system that allowed Aguilera to pronounce the " r 's " in the songs . Mi Reflejo features a cover of César Portillo de la Luz 's bolero " Contigo En La Distancia " . Additionally , Aguilera made a duet with Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi on the ballad " Si No Te Hubiera Conocido " . Aguilera wanted Fonsi to perform a duet with her because she felt that she could relate to him as they " grew up listening to the same things " . " Cuando No es Contigo " is an uptempo salsa song which was arranged by Sergio George . " Falsas Esperanzas " is another uptempo song in the album which features Cuban musician Paquito <unk> performing the piano .

 At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , Mi Reflejo received an average score of 56 , based on seven reviews , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic described the album as a mirror image of her debut album Christina Aguilera . He felt that it was a " little too familiar " although he praised recordings as " well @-@ produced " ; however , he concluded that the album " doesn 't add anything new to her music , since it 's just the old music in new clothing . " An editor for Billboard wrote that Aguilera has yielded a mostly mainstream pop album with Latin inflections . Eliseo Cardona of <unk> gave the album a mixed review . While he enjoyed Aguilera 's vocal performance , which he described as " precisely , gracefully , forcefully " , he criticized the literal Spanish translation of the lyrics from English which he said made a " good laugh and a better yawn " . He commended " Cuando No es Contigo " as making Aguilera a " credible , expressive <unk> " and her cover of " Contigo en la Distancia " as the album 's finest moment . 
 David Browne of Entertainment Weekly , who gave the album a C rating , wrote the review in a parody memo from Aguilera 's point of view . He mocked at Aguilera 's attempt at making Spanish @-@ language album simply because of her Ecuadorian heritage , criticized her " unnecessary " high note " , ballads that " old Latin ladies 'll like " , and the photos used in the album 's booklet . Mike Magnuson of <unk> wrote a critical review of the album admonishing the photos in the record for attempting to make Aguilera look Latino which he insisted was a bad influence for the younger audience . Though he mentions that " you can count on her agreeable voice " and lauded the use of Latin percussion and horns , he asserted that the record was " purely a marketing scam gone too far . " Parry Gettelman from Orlando Sentinel stated that " Mi Reflejo lacks emotional depth , and her decision to record in Spanish seems more a bid to conquer new chart territory than anything else " . 
 <unk> called its production " <unk> " and compared Aguilera 's vocals to that of Mariah Carey , completing that the album " almost guarantees that the diminutive diva will expand her colonial powers south of the border . In other words , she 's planning to do a reverse Ricky Martin on us " . Ernesto Lechner of the Los Angeles Times rated the album two out of four stars comparing her vocals in her debut album and in Mi Reflejo , describing her performance in the latter as " ridiculous " . He complained about Aguilera 's cover of " Contigo en la Distancia " which he described as a " bloated confection " . Kurt B. <unk> from Wall of Sound wrote that the album is " an impressive addition to young Christina 's limited canon " .

 = Bisporella citrina = 
 Bisporella citrina , commonly known as yellow fairy cups or lemon discos , is a species of fungus in the family Helotiaceae . The fungus produces tiny yellow cups up to 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 12 in ) in diameter , often without stalks , that fruit in groups or dense clusters on decaying deciduous wood that has lost its bark . The widely distributed species is found in North Africa , Asia , Europe , North America , and Central and South America . Found in late summer and autumn , the fungus is fairly common , but is easily overlooked owing to its small size . There are several similar species that can in most cases be distinguished by differences in color , morphology , or substrate . Microscopically , B. citrina can be distinguished from these lookalikes by its elliptical spores , which have a central partition , and an oil drop at each end . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was originally described from Europe in 1789 by German naturalist August Batsch as Peziza citrina . Elias Fries sanctioned this name in the second volume of his Systema Mycologicum ( 1821 ) . Jean Louis Émile Boudier transferred the species to Calycella in 1885 . Another historical name for the fungus was derived from Johann Hedwig 's 1789 <unk> citrina . Fries referred Hedwig 's name to Helotium in 1846 , and for several decades the fungus was known as either Calycella citrina or Helotium citrinum , depending on which generic concept an author accepted . In a 1974 publication , Richard Korf noted that the generic name Helotium competes with a basidiomycete genus of the same name , and under the rules of botanical nomenclature , the ascomycete version of the name had to be abandoned because the basidiomycete version was sanctioned by Fries in 1832 , and thus had priority . He also pointed out that the generic name Calycella could not be used , as it is a synonym of an older name <unk> , which contains species that bear no taxonomic relationship to Helotium citrinum . Accordingly , he formally transferred Helotium citrinum to Bisporella , to produce the new combination Bisporella citrina . Korf further noted that since Bisporella was published by Pier Andrea Saccardo in 1884 , it had priority over Boudier 's 1885 Calycella . Calycella has since been folded into Bisporella . 
 The specific epithet citrina is derived from the Latin <unk> , meaning " lemon yellow " . Common names for the fungus include " yellow fairy cups " , and the British Mycological Society @-@ approved " lemon disco " ; the name " disco " is short for Discomycetes , an older term for ascomycete species with disc- and cup @-@ shaped fruit bodies . Samuel Frederick Gray called it the " lemon funnel @-@ stool " in his 1821 work A Natural Arrangement of British Plants . 
 = = Description = = 
 Fruit bodies begin as spherical , closed globules , before expanding . The smooth , bright yellow fruit bodies are small — typically less than 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 12 in ) in diameter and up to 1 mm ( 0 @.@ 04 in ) high — and shallowly cup- or disc @-@ shaped . The inner surface is smooth , and bright yellow , while the outer surface is a paler yellow . In mass , the spore color is white . The stalk is broad , pale yellow in color , and short to nearly absent ; when present it is rarely more than 1 mm . The fruit bodies may be so numerous that their shapes are distorted by overcrowding . Fruit bodies that have dried are wrinkled and have a dull orangish @-@ brown color . The fruit bodies have no distinctive taste nor odor , and are not edible . 
 The smooth spores are roughly elliptical , measuring 8 – 14 by 3 – 5 μm ; in maturity they have one cross @-@ wall , and oil drops at either end . The asci ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) measure 100 – 135 by 7 – 10 μm . The paraphyses are shaped liked narrow cylinders with diameters up to 1 @.@ 5 μm , and have tips that are rounded or somewhat club @-@ <unk> β @-@ <unk> is the predominant pigment responsible for the yellow color of the fruit body . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 There are several small yellow discomycetes with which Bisporella citrina might be confused . Lookalikes include the acorn cup ( <unk> <unk> ) that grows on fallen acorns and hickory nuts . The green stain fungus ( <unk> <unk> ) forms blue @-@ green cups , and stains its wood substrate bluish @-@ green . <unk> <unk> is up to 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 24 in ) in diameter , and has hairs around the edge of its cup , and its outer surface is covered with short brown hairs . Fruit bodies of Bisporella <unk> have a coloration similar to B. citrina , but they are smaller and grow in clusters on old , blackened , fungal stroma on wood . 
 Other lookalikes include <unk> species , including H. <unk> , but these can be distinguished by their distinct stalks , and growth on smaller woody debris like sticks and twigs , rather than logs and stumps . Many other small , yellow discos have fringed or hairy margins to the discs , like Anthracobia <unk> ; this latter species grows on or near moss , rather than wood . <unk> <unk> is another small cup fungus resembling B. citrina . It has a bright yellow outer surface , but the hymenium becomes develops greenish tints in age . The common <unk> fungus ( <unk> <unk> ) is usually smaller but can approach the dimensions of B. citrina . Similar in color , its fruit bodies are usually blob @-@ like rather than cup shaped . Another cup fungus that grows on dead beech wood is <unk> pura , but its fruit bodies are larger , ranging from 2 – 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 6 in ) . 
 = = Ecology and distribution = = 
 Bisporella citrina is saprobic , and so obtains nutrients by breaking down complex organic molecules into simpler ones . Fruit bodies are typically encountered growing in dense clusters on the surface of rotten wood ( especially deciduous trees ) , particularly beech . They have also been found growing on the fruit bodies of the polypore fungus Daedaleopsis confragosa . In a study of the succession of fungi associated with the decay of a 120 @-@ year @-@ old healthy beech tree uprooted by strong winds , B. citrina was found on the wood about three years after the fall . It appeared after early colonizers such as <unk> <unk> , <unk> vulgaris ( the anamorph form of Nectria cinnabarina ) , and Bulgaria <unk> , and was followed by Stereum hirsutum and Nectria cinnabarina . 
 The widespread fungus is known from North Africa , Asia , Europe , North America , Central and South America , Australia , and New Zealand . It is one of the most common of the small discomycetes . 
 = Le Paradis massacre = 
 The Le Paradis massacre was a war crime committed by members of the 14th Company , SS Division Totenkopf , under the command of Hauptsturmführer Fritz Knöchlein . It took place on 27 May 1940 , during the Battle of France , at a time when the British Expeditionary Force ( BEF ) was attempting to retreat through the Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais region during the Battle of Dunkirk . 
 Soldiers of the 2nd Battalion , the Royal Norfolk Regiment , had become isolated from their regiment . They occupied and defended a farmhouse against an attack by Waffen @-@ SS forces in the village of Le Paradis . After running out of ammunition , the defenders surrendered to the German troops . The Germans led them across the road to a wall , and machine @-@ gunned them . Ninety @-@ seven British troops died . Two survived , with injuries , and hid until they were captured by German forces several days later . 
 After the war , Fritz Knöchlein was located , tried and convicted by a war crimes court , with the two survivors acting as witnesses against him . For his part in the massacre , Knöchlein was executed in 1949 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The German invasion of France through the Netherlands and Belgium began on 10 May 1940 . Army Group A fought its way through southern Belgium and north @-@ eastern France . German forces pushed the French Army and the British Expeditionary Force ( BEF ) to the Meuse river on 12 May , crossing it that evening . From there , the German forces rapidly advanced to the English Channel over the course of the next week . BEF units , including detached companies of the Royal Norfolks and Royal Scots , were ordered to try to slow the German advance in northern France to buy time to evacuate troops at Dunkirk . 
 One of the participating German units , the 3rd SS Division Totenkopf , had been strongly indoctrinated with the Nazi Party ideology by its commander Theodor Eicke . Eicke 's men had a fanatical loyalty to him and to Germany . The men of Totenkopf fought recklessly throughout the campaign , suffering higher death rates than other German forces . 
 The Battle of France was SS Division Totenkopf 's first major engagement of World War II . The division , part of the reserves of Army Group A , was called to the front line on 17 May . The unit was engaged in " mopping up " operations against Allied forces to the north and east of Cambrai . In total 16 @,@ 000 prisoners had been taken by the division , but they had refused the surrender of 200 Muslim French @-@ Moroccan troops , who were executed on the spot . 
 By the time the operation had finished in Cambrai , the first German units had reached the English Channel , but the British counter @-@ attacked just west of Arras on 21 May , following on from the counter @-@ attack of the day before ( Battle of Arras ) . The Totenkopf division suffered casualties of just under 100 men in repelling the assault . The Totenkopf was then ordered to the town of Béthune and crossed the La Bassée river under British attack on 24 May . However , the men were ordered to retreat the next day to preserve tanks for the upcoming campaign in Dunkirk and to allow the Luftwaffe to attack Allied positions in the area . The men thus had to make the hazardous crossing again on the night of 26 May . The SS men took Béthune after heavy house @-@ to @-@ house fighting with the British , who withdrew to a line between <unk> and Le Paradis . 
 The 2nd Battalion of the Royal Norfolks , along with the 8th Lancashire Fusiliers , were holding the Allied line at the villages of <unk> du <unk> , Le Cornet Malo and Le Paradis with the battalion headquarters based at Le Paradis . The battalions had been ordered to hold out for as long as possible against the Germans to give time for the BEF to evacuate from Dunkirk . 
 The SS Division Totenkopf emerged from the Bois de <unk> wood and attacked Le Cornet Malo at dawn on 27 May . The British troops defended stubbornly but were eventually overrun . The attack resulted in the deaths of four German officers and 150 men . Another 480 men and 18 officers were wounded . Later the same day , the German troops moved forward to attack Le Paradis . 
 = = = Battle of Le Paradis = = = 
 After the engagement at Le Cornet Malo , C Company and HQ Company of the 2nd Royal Norfolks had fallen back to their headquarters at Cornet Farm , just outside Le Paradis . The company commanders had been informed by radio that their units were isolated and would receive no assistance . They therefore dug in around the farmhouse , which lay on the Rue du Paradis , the boundary between the Royal Norfolk Regiment and the adjacent 1st Royal Scots . The Norfolks ' last contact with Brigade Headquarters at L <unk> was at 11 : 30 but despite no support and heavy opposition , the defenders held out against the 14th Company , 1st Battalion of the 2nd SS Infantry Regiment until 17 : 15 , when they ran out of ammunition . During the battle the Germans attacked the farmhouse with mortars , tanks and artillery shelling , which destroyed the building and forced the defenders to relocate to a cowshed . 
 The 99 surviving defenders of the 2nd Norfolks were eventually ordered by their commander Major Lisle Ryder , the brother of Robert Edward Dudley Ryder , to surrender and they left the cowshed that they had been defending under a white flag . Due to the boundary between the two British regiments being the road , Ryder 's men surrendered not to the company they had been fighting , but rather to SS @-@ Hauptsturmführer Fritz Knöchlein 's unit , which had been fighting the Royal Scots . Mass graves found near Le Paradis in 2007 suggest that around 20 men of the Royal Scots who surrendered to an SS unit may also have been killed in a separate massacre . 
 = = Massacre = = 
 The British captives , a majority of whom were wounded , were disarmed and marched down a road off the Rue du Paradis . While they were waiting , two machine @-@ guns from No.4 Machine @-@ gun Company were prepared and set up by a barn in a paddock of the farm . The British prisoners were marched to the barn , lined up alongside it and fired upon by the two German <unk> , who continued firing until all the British had fallen . Knöchlein then armed his men with bayonets to kill any remaining survivors . Satisfied that they had killed them all , the German soldiers left to rejoin the rest of their regiment . 
 An account by Private Albert Pooley , one of only two survivors : 
 ... we turned off the dusty French road , through a gateway and into a meadow beside the buildings of a farm . I saw with one of the nastiest feelings I have ever had in my life two heavy machine guns inside the meadow ... pointing at the head of our column . The guns began to spit fire ... for a few seconds the cries and shrieks of our stricken men drowned the crackling of the guns . Men fell like grass before a scythe ... I felt a searing pain and pitched forward ... my scream of pain mingled with the cries of my mates , but even before I fell into the heap of dying men , the thought stabbed my brain ' If I ever get out of here , the swine that did this will pay for it.' 
 Ninety @-@ seven British prisoners were killed and the Germans forced French civilians to bury the bodies in a shallow mass grave the next day . Despite the German efforts , Private William O 'Callaghan had survived and pulled Private Albert Pooley alive from among the bodies in the field . The pair then hid in a pig @-@ sty for three days and nights , surviving on raw potatoes and water from puddles before being discovered by the farm 's owner , Madame Duquenne @-@ <unk> , and her son Victor . The French civilians risked their lives caring for the two men , who were later captured by the Wehrmacht 's 251st Infantry Division and transferred to a military hospital . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 On the day after the massacre , 28 May , Gunter d 'Alquen , a journalist in the Waffen @-@ SS , arrived at the scene with Dr Thum , the SS @-@ Totenkopf deputy legal <unk> d 'Alquen made a report of what he saw : 
 It was possible to look into the back yard from the road ... the corpses in British uniform were lying in the yard near the buildings . They were lying in such a position that one can assume they were killed by machine @-@ gun bursts . It struck me at once that the dead soldiers were not wearing helmets , nor did they have any equipment on them ... I took pictures of the dead bodies , and the whole farm . At Thum 's request these were to be placed at the disposal of the division ... I believe I was already sitting there in the vehicle when Thum ... told me that in the field which he had returned the equipment ... the shot British soldiers were lying in a heap , from which he had come to the conclusion that a summary trial had taken place . 
 Major <unk> von <unk> , who was also at the scene of the massacre on that day , reported that " These people had almost all suffered head wounds from shots that must have been fired at close range . Some had their whole skull smashed in , an injury that can almost only be caused by a blow from a gun butt or similar means . " 
 News of the massacre spread to neighbouring German divisions , eventually reaching General Erich Hoepner , commander of the German forces in France . He disliked the SS , especially Eicke , and was determined to have him dismissed if charges of mistreatment or murdering of prisoners could be brought . However , none of these investigations were ever successful . Regardless , many SS officers were appalled by the massacre ; some reportedly challenged Knöchlein to a duel , although none were ever fought . 
 The Allies received no information about the massacre until the summer of 1943 , when Pooley , who had spent the last three years in a German hospital due to the injuries he had suffered in the massacre , was declared medically unfit and repatriated . British authorities did not believe Pooley 's story on his arrival ; it was not thought that the German army were capable of such atrocities against British troops . Private O 'Callaghan did not return to the United Kingdom until 1945 after the liberation of his prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camp . His confirmation of Pooley 's story prompted an official investigation . 
 The bodies of those killed in the massacre were exhumed in 1942 by the French , but only about 50 of the 97 were successfully identified . The bodies were then reburied in Le Paradis churchyard , which now forms part of the Le Paradis War Cemetery administered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission . In 1970 , a memorial plaque was placed on the barn wall where the massacre took place and a large memorial was subsequently erected beside the church . 
 = = Trial of Knöchlein = = 
 After the war , O 'Callaghan 's evidence and the discovery of the SS @-@ run extermination camps prompted the British authorities to look into the reports . The massacre was investigated by the War Crimes Investigation Unit and after Knöchlein 's company was identified as the perpetrators in 1947 , he was traced and arrested in Germany . Knöchlein was arraigned on charges of war crimes in August 1948 ; to which he pleaded not guilty : 
 The accused Fritz Knöchlein , a German national , in the charge of the Hamburg Garrison Unit , pursuant to Regulation 4 of the Regulations for the Trial of War Criminals , is charged with committing a war crime in that he in the vicinity of Paradis , Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais , France , on or about 27 May 1940 , in violation of the laws and usages of war , was concerned in the killing of about ninety prisoners @-@ of @-@ war , members of The Royal Norfolk Regiment and other British Units . 
 He was tried before <unk> war crimes court in <unk> , in Court Number 5 on Monday , 11 October 1948 . Knöchlein 's defence hinged on the claim that he was not present at the massacre , although his lawyers did not deny that the event took place . They also claimed that the British had used <unk> bullets during the battle and misused a flag of truce ; all of which were vigorously denied by the prosecution . Evidence was given by Pooley , O 'Callaghan , Madame Duquenne @-@ <unk> , and a French civilian who testified to recognizing Knöchlein . 
 On the 12th day of the trial , during his summation , the Judge @-@ Advocate said that whether the British had used illegal ammunition or abused a flag of truce was irrelevant ; the German troops still had absolutely no right to execute prisoners of war without a fair and proper trial . On 25 October at 11 : 30 , the President of the court pronounced the verdict that the defendant , Fritz Knöchlein , had been found guilty of war crimes . His lawyer , Dr. <unk> , made the following plea to the court for clemency on account of Knöchlein 's wife and family , who had attended every day of the trial : 
 " All that is left for me to say is that some little doubt may have remained in the minds of the Court which will enable the members not to award the extreme penalty . Spare the life of the accused . He has a wife and four children who are dependent upon him for support . Consider also the fact that he is a soldier , and the Court is composed of members of the British Army . I believe I am entitled to appeal to the Court to pronounce a sentence which will enable my client to come out of prison at an early date . " 
 Despite this plea , at 15 : 00 he was sentenced to death by hanging , which was carried out on 28 January 1949 in Hamburg . No other German soldiers or officers were prosecuted for their roles in the massacre . 
 = Dimitri Marick = 
 Dimitri Marick is a fictional character from the American ABC soap opera All My Children . The role has been most notably portrayed by Michael Nader , previously famed for his role on Dynasty . Former head writers Agnes Nixon and Lorraine Broderick created the character in 1991 , designing him as a brooding and mysterious character based on heroes from gothic literature , such as Maxim de Winter from Daphne du Maurier 's novel Rebecca and Heathcliff from Emily Brontë 's novel Wuthering Heights . The character 's introduction raised All My Children in the Nielsen ratings and was credited as the " saving grace " of the unpopular Natalie and Janet storyline . 
 Soon after his debut on the soap opera , Dimitri became a complex leading man and took part in some of the most notable plots of the 1990s . Those storylines included popular romances with Erica Kane ( Susan Lucci ) and Alexandra Devane ( Finola Hughes ) , as well as a loving yet antagonistic fraternal relationship with Edmund Grey ( John Callahan ) . 
 In July 1999 , Nader was let go from All My Children due to budgetary considerations , however , he later returned in May 2000 . The following year , the actor 's arrest brought him and the character to the center of a large fan campaign organized by a group called the Loyalists , as well as a highly publicized lawsuit catching the attention of People and Entertainment Tonight , among other media outlets . As a result , Nader was let go again by the soap opera , with an official statement saying they would be prepared to consider having him return once he had addressed the lawsuit issues . The role was temporarily recast with actor Anthony Addabbo , who was negatively received by viewers , and let go shortly after his debut . Nader later stated in an interview that ABC had informed him that they had no intention of ever bringing him or the character back due to a lack of storyline . In 2004 , Nader 's suit was subsequently thrown out . In May 2013 , after a twelve @-@ year absence from All My Children , Nader was announced to be reprising the role , with his return airing on June 12 , 2013 . 
 = = Casting = = 
 Casting the role of Dimitri gave All My Children difficulty . The series ' casting director , Judy <unk> Wilson , tested between fifteen and twenty actors , and could not find the right actor for the job . Wilson then learned that the former Dynasty star , Michael Nader was available and suggested the show offer him the part . 
 Before All My Children offered him the role of Dimitri Marick , Nader already planned on working in both Los Angeles and New York . " My fiancee , Beth Windsor , had literally just worked into being bicoastal , " he said . " She had an apartment here and I had been seeking out some theater here in New York and would have been spending time both here and in L.A. So after we made the decision to go ahead with that game plan , this offer ( Dimitri ) came on the table and when we worked out all the figures <unk> it was a great opportunity . " Despite Nader 's prime time success as Dynasty 's Dex Dexter , he did not look down on daytime television . " The fact of the matter is we 're in a different era , " he said . " And if you look at the cutbacks in Hollywood , being on a soap is not of any less or more value than being in any other medium at this time . " Another factor that contributed to his decision to join All My Children was the actors strike . He intended to stay on All My Children for a year . That year turned into more because the actor fell in love with New York . 
 Since finding the right actor to play Dimitri took such a long time , the show had already begun taping around the character for two weeks . Nader spent his first weeks on All My Children working overtime to catch up . " By the time we had resolved some of the terms , " he said , " they were really against the wall in terms of back story .... In retrospect , I should have just slept on the set because it was like sixty or seventy pages a day ! " Nader also taped his scenes out of sequence while dealing with sixteen different scripts from different points in the story . To keep each scene straight he gave them each a name that described the scene 's main action . After those scenes were taped , they were spliced into the otherwise completed episodes . This went on for two weeks until the episodes were all caught up . Another complication Nader dealt with was the wardrobe . He said , " They had devised this sort of ' tapestry ' layered look for Dimitri and it was like doing scenes inside a sauna . " This was eventually rectified , but not before the actor lost around twelve pounds in the two weeks . 
 Michael Nader was fired from All My Children in July 1999 , due to budget considerations , and Dimitri was killed off . This led to a fan outcry from viewers who campaigned for the actor 's return . To partially appease them , the show 's executive producer , Jean <unk> Burke , offered Nader his job back on a recurring basis . He rejected this offer because " after being a major character for so long , it didn 't make any sense to me . So I declined . But if the network was interested in seriously discussing Dimitri 's return on a contract basis I would love to go back . " 
 In May 2000 , he was rehired and brought back into the role with a multi @-@ year contract . The return story scripted for the Dimitri character centered on the romance between his brother Edmund and his wife Alex . Dimitri was revealed to be alive just as his wife , Alex , and brother , Edmund , had sex for the first time . Nader said he wanted to create a deeper layer in the character instead of focusing solely on the love triangle between Dimitri , Alex , and Edmund . " I do hope to pursue some sort of subtle spiritual change , some perception that Dimitri is different , " he said . He questioned the writers ' storyline choice in not exploring the popular Dimitri and Erica romance again . " I found it sort of odd that they 'd move me so far away from Susan [ Lucci , Erica ] , " Nader said . " They 're trying to explore these other themes . " 
 Nader lost the role again in February 2001 as a result of the actor getting arrested for allegedly selling cocaine to an undercover police officer . All My Children released an official statement saying , " If Mr. Nader gets the help that he needs and addresses his problem , and it makes sense for the show , we would be prepared to speak with Michael in the future . " The network put Nader on probation and ordered him to seek help for his problem . 
 Anthony Addabbo temporarily took over the role , first airing on April 6 , 2001 . To prepare for the role , he watched tapes of Nader 's portrayal of Dimitri in order to see the relationships between Dimitri and other characters . Despite the fan protest against the role being recast , Addabbo told Soap Opera Digest he was not worried . " I don 't find it intimidating , " he said . " I know how they can come to love a certain actor portraying a role and how he plays the role and everything , but this happens in daytime so frequently that I didn 't find it intimidating at all . " Soap Opera Digest considered him an odd choice for a Dimitri recast since Addabbo usually portrayed " all @-@ American good guys " such as Generations Jason Craig and Guiding Light 's Jim LeMay . A large number of All My Children fans rejected Addabbo in the role and continued to campaign for Nader 's return . The controversy forced the writers to lessen Dimitri 's role on the show until July 2001 when Addabbo was let go " for storyline reasons " , according to ABC 's official statement . 
 During an interview , Nader told Soap Opera Digest that in late September 2001 , ABC called a meeting with him to inform him that , though he resolved his personal problems , they had no intention of ever bringing him or the character back due to lack of story . Nader argued that other storyline possibilities existed since he and Dimitri received " a tremendous response " from viewers . " For years , Dimitri and Erica were a popular coupling , " he said . " A good friend of mine , Jack Scalia ( Chris ) , is on ... that alone would be a dynamic triangle . " 
 In May 2013 , following a twelve @-@ year absence from All My Children , Nader was announced to be reprising the role of Dimitri , scheduled to begin in June . Initially his first airdate was 3 June , however , due to Prospect Park 's decision to reduce the amount of episodes made available each week , he did not air until 12 June .

 Former head writers Agnes Nixon and Lorraine Broderick created the character Dimitri Marick in 1991 . His original purpose was to rescue Natalie Marlowe from the well her sister , Janet Green , trapped her in . He was also designed as a rival for Natalie 's current love interest , Trevor Dillon . Trevor and Natalie were a popular couple at that point and the writers wanted to create a viable obstacle for <unk> <unk> exciting , romantic , handsome leading man , so that there would be a real impediment ; you know we 'd have a really exciting love story between Trevor and somebody as different from Trevor as we could get ... because Trevor is a wonderful , warm , teddy bear , lovable , down @-@ to @-@ earth , right @-@ out @-@ there <unk> and Dimitri is very much opposite from that . " Broderick characterized the character in an interview with Soap Opera Update , stating : 
 Nixon and Broderick also crafted the character as a darkly brooding and mysterious man in the same vein as gothic literary heroes such as Heathcliff from Wuthering Heights , Edward Rochester from Jane Eyre , and Maxim de Winter from Rebecca . Nixon used these characters as inspiration for Dimitri because , as she told Soap Opera Weekly , " In doing the ' stolen life ' story , I felt that we needed something to follow that was also a little larger than life , very romantic , and gothic . " The characters played a part in shaping Dimitri as well as his environment and storylines . Maxim de Winter 's estate , Manderley , provided the inspiration for Dimitri 's Pine Valley estate , Wildwind . The design was taken from both the description in Du Maurier 's book and the depiction from the film Rebecca , a 1940 adaptation of the novel by Alfred Hitchcock . Like Mr. Rochester , the wife Dimitri falsely claims died years ago is revealed to be alive just before his marriage to another woman . 
 Nixon infused elements of those literatures into the Dimitri and Natalie romance with as well . " There 's a gothic quality to it " , she said , referring to the couple . " It 's Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre . Everybody loves somebody who has a past and a <unk> and certainly Dimitri <unk> which we haven 't divulged yet . That heightens ones interest and suspense . It 's a special situation but what really makes it special is the actor 's talent , personalities , good looks , and chemistry . " Since the writers created Dimitri as a very mysterious character , Michael Nader mostly stayed away from the press in order to help maintain that image . Whenever he did do an interview , he discussed the character in such a way as to add more mystery . Nader compared Dimitri to the Dynasty character he once portrayed , Dex Dexter . On Dynasty , " John James ( Jeff Colby ) played the ' aw , shucks ; ' nice guy , and I played the guy who was on the edge , who would take care of business and not take any bull " , he said . " Dimitri is sort of a darker Dex . Though I don 't know exactly how dark to make him yet . " Nader , as an actor , also provided the writers with more inspiration on the character . " The more we see of him , the more he inspires us " , Broderick said . " It 's just a wonderful marriage of actor and character [ ... ] He 's giving us so many levels and such depth , that it 's a challenge . But it 's exciting . Dimitri is one of the characters that is so much fun to write . "

 To further the mystery element and add an international twist to the story , Nixon scripted Dimitri as having close European roots , though he is an American . He is the son of Hungarian parents , Hugo and Anna . Originally , his wealth comes from all the land around Pine Valley and the One Life to Live city Llanview , which he inherits from his parents . That is also where his fictional estate , Wildwind , is located . Later , during Dimitri 's 1992 story with Erica Kane , he is revealed to also be Hungarian nobility as Count <unk> . He inherited his title and his Hungarian castle , <unk> , from his father 's side . Both of his parents were dead by the time Dimitri first appears on All My Children . He spends his childhood years growing up in Europe and on the Wildwind estate .

 Dimitri became a popular leading man soon after his debut on All My Children in 1991 and " was prominent in some of the show 's most memorable tales of that decade . " The character and his portrayer , Michael Nader , were credited with lifting the Nielsen ratings as well as saving the Natalie , Trevor , and Janet storyline . In that storyline , the character Janet Green imprisons her sister Natalie in a well and masquerades as Natalie to seduce her fiance Trevor . Fans and soap opera press criticized the story . In Soap Opera Weekly , Marlena De Lacroix said , " Dimitri was the saving grace of the storyline I 'd earlier called an artistic disaster : the Janet and Natalie body switch . " She described Dimitri as a " cross between Rudolph Valentino 's Sheik and the gothic Maxim de Winter from Rebecca . " Viewers found the character " irresistible " ; so much so that Soap Opera Digest questioned whether the character was a diversion from the failed storyline . All My Children 's head writer Agnes Nixon denied this . " We expected to get negative mail on Janet / Nat , " she said , " they [ the viewers ] don 't like it but they [ keep ] watching . " 
 The character gained further success with the popular Dimitri and Erica pairing . In 1993 , viewers named them a supercouple , along with One Life to Live 's Bo and Nora and Days of our Lives ' Roman and Marlena . In 2008 , Entertainment Weekly listed them among the top seventeen supercouples . Soap Opera Digest compared them to the real life couple Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton because of their tumultuous nature . 
 The romance between Dimitri and Finola Hughes ' Alexandra Devane Marick also rose in popularity . Soap Opera Update named them the best couple of the year in 1999 for All My Children despite the fact that their love story played out through brief flashbacks . The magazine compared the couple 's relationship to the television series Once and Again . Soap Opera Update also referred to them as the " break out supercouple of the year " . 
 The Dimitri character took a darker turn in 1997 , in what Soap Opera Digest considered an effort to make Erica more sympathetic after her role in the kidnapping of the baby Maddie Grey ( then known as Sonya ) . Soap Opera Digest praised the move in an article naming Nader Performer of the Week , saying , " Nader has been surprisingly effective as a <unk> , and nothing short of brilliant taking an already complex character and making him more compelling . " Soap Opera Weekly 's Gabrielle Winkel expressed similar sentiments , saying , " Michael Nader is far more entertaining and compelling now that Dimitri is out for himself than when he was as Erica 's devoted husband ... AMC was right on target when it developed Dimitri 's dark side . Nader 's brooding looks and raspy voice have always given Dimitri that evil edge . Nader , though , wisely keeps Dimitri 's obsessiveness sufficiently in check to make it believable . " At the conclusion of the storyline Soap Opera Digest again named him Performer of the Week for " unleashing the sort of go @-@ for @-@ broke fury and fray that actors are usually reluctant to release unless they 're certain their character is about to be killed off . " 
 Soap Opera Digest noted the rarity of brothers like Edmund Grey and Dimitri Marick . In the soap opera genre , brothers with a standing rivalry as well as a strong fraternal bond are considered to be a rarity . Sisters on soap operas were usually the ones who shared " men , makeup , and misery . " Dimitri and Edmund 's relationship was scripted as complicated , transitioning between loving and antagonistic . Their relationship gained positive feedback from both viewers and the soap opera media . Soap Opera Digest named them Best Brothers of 1994 , saying , " In Michael Nader ( Dimitri ) and John Callahan ( Edmund ) , AMC has charismatic performers with chemistry , and they 're making the most of it . " Complications in the brothers ' relationship included childhood jealousies , the revelation that they were brothers , Dimitri 's one @-@ night stand with Edmund 's wife Maria and subsequent question of the paternity of Maddie Grey , and the Dimitri , Alex , and Edmund triangle . Along with the conflict , they displayed a loving relationship where they stood by each other . In describing the relationship , Nader said , " The storyline with Edmund and Dimitri , the Marick brothers , there wasn 't a brother duo on television that had the sort of power that John and I could bring to that relationship . " 
 Storylines they featured in met with both praise and negative reactions . With the plot centering on Maddie Grey 's paternity and kidnappings , All My Children " fans revolted en masse . " Yet Soap Opera Digest hailed the plot as " one of the best told , most fascinating storylines of the year . " In the Dimitri , Alex , and Edmund triangle , viewers took two opposing views on which brother should end up with Alex . Soap Opera Weekly proclaimed the triangle a hit , while Soap Opera Update rated it a ten out of ten . In the storyline , Alex and Edmund fall in love while her husband Dimitri is presumed dead . They eventually become engaged . When he returns and witnesses their happy relationship , Dimitri decides not to interfere . " The dilemma for Dimitri is his brother 's happiness , " Nader said . " As much as he loves Alex , he 's made the choice to give her to Edmund . " Alex discovers Dimitri alive first . They reunite and engage in sex . Edmund finds out and feels betrayed by them both . The scenes of the confrontation between all three characters was written to express the views of both the Dimitri and Alex and the Edmund and Alex fans . The viewers who rooted for Edmund argued that Dimitri and Alex betrayed him by having sex immediately after reuniting . Viewers who supported Dimitri argued that the reunion was not a betrayal since Dimitri was Alex 's husband . Alex ends up with Dimitri , which changes " Edmund from a jaded , one @-@ note character into a far more multidimensional and intriguing hero . " Soap Opera Weekly praised All My Children for not dragging the triangle out and instead using it as a catalyst for character development . 
 = = Controversy = = 
 In what Soap Opera Digest named the year 's Dumbest Male <unk> in 1999 , Nader was fired from the role of Dimitri and the character was killed off . The firing " set off a firestorm of protest from devoted fans . " Those fans came together to form a group called the Loyalists and campaigned for the actor 's return . They " bombarded " All My Children with letters centering on three major complaints concerning Nader 's dismissal , as summarized in Soap Opera Digest : " 1 ) They have waited two years for a Dimitri / Erica reunion , which they won 't get now that he 's leaving . 2 ) They adore Nader 's chemistry with on @-@ screen brother John Callahan ( Edmund ) and don 't want to lose it . 3 ) They fear that Nader has been sacrificed to make room in the budget for <unk> and <unk> cast members . " In response to the last complaint , an All My Children spokesperson pointed out the storylines planned for characters over thirty years old such as Tad , Dixie , Erica , David , Edmund , and Alex . 
 Nader thanked the Loyalists for their support and expressed his surprise at the size of the response . " [ T ] he expanse and impact were quite astounding to me , " he said . " In my years of doing this , I never experienced this kind of support . " Susan Lucci commented on the fan response , saying , " So many people stop me on the street and ask me , ' Will Dimitri ever come back and will he and Erica ever get together . ' " 
 At a fan luncheon , the Loyalists confronted All My Children 's executive producer Jean <unk> Burke with a petition asking for Nader 's return . They also organized a tune @-@ out of the show on November 5 , 1999 . To appease them at least in part , Burke offered Nader his job back on a recurring basis , which he refused . In 2000 , All My Children rehired him on a contract basis . His co @-@ star , Hughes was happy about the news , saying his return would " give a huge injection of ' fuel ' " to the Alex and Edmund romance . 
 In 2001 , Nader was arrested for cocaine possession . All My Children suspended him and demanded he get treatment . They cast Addabbo in the role as a temporary replacement . Fans of Nader , the Loyalists in particular , rejected the recast . Though the majority of the viewers did not take to him , Addabbo gained an amount of support from fans who wanted him to continue in the role or portray a different character once Nader returned . Soap Opera Digest criticized the casting of Addabbo because the actor usually portrayed " all @-@ American good guys " , the opposite of the Dimitri Marick role . In July of that year , Addabbo was let go and Dimitri was officially written out . 
 After Nader got help for his drug addiction at Hazelton Clinic in Minnesota , All My Children opted not to bring him back . Nader filed a $ 31 @.@ 7 million lawsuit against ABC for breach of contract under the Americans with Disabilities Act . ABC 's lawyers cited Nader 's violation of the morals clause in his contract as justification for not rehiring him . The firing and lawsuit caught the attention of non @-@ soap opera medias such as TV Guide , Inside Edition , People , Celebrity Justice , Extra , Entertainment Tonight , and Larry King Live . Manhattan Federal Judge Jed S. Rakoff threw out the suit in 2004 .

 Hezbollah ( pronounced / <unk> / ; Arabic : <unk> الله <unk> ' <unk> , literally " Party of Allah " or " Party of God " ) — also transliterated Hizbullah , Hizballah , etc . — is a Shi 'a Islamist militant group and political party based in Lebanon . Hezbollah 's paramilitary wing is the Jihad Council , and its political wing is Loyalty to the Resistance Bloc party in the Lebanese parliament . After the death of Abbas al @-@ <unk> in 1992 , the group has been headed by Hassan Nasrallah , its Secretary @-@ General . 
 After the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 , Israel occupied a strip of south Lebanon , which was controlled by the South Lebanon Army ( SLA ) , a militia supported by Israel . Hezbollah was conceived by Muslim clerics and funded by Iran primarily to harass the Israeli occupation . Its leaders were followers of Ayatollah Khomeini , and its forces were trained and organized by a contingent of 1 @,@ 500 Revolutionary Guards that arrived from Iran with permission from the Syrian government , which was in occupation of Lebanon at the time . Hezbollah waged a guerilla campaign in South Lebanon — SLA collapsed and surrendered , and Israel withdrew from Lebanon on May 24 , 2000 . 
 Hezbollah 's military strength has grown so significantly that its paramilitary wing is considered more powerful than the Lebanese Army . Hezbollah has been described as a " state within a state " , and has grown into an organization with seats in the Lebanese government , a radio and a satellite TV station , social services and large @-@ scale military deployment of fighters beyond Lebanon 's borders . Hezbollah is part of the March 8 Alliance within Lebanon , in opposition to the March 14 Alliance . Hezbollah maintains strong support among Lebanon 's Shi 'a population , while Sunnis have disagreed with the group 's agenda . Hezbollah receives military training , weapons , and financial support from Iran , and political support from Syria . Hezbollah and Israel fought each other in the 2006 Lebanon War . 
 Hezbollah 's 1985 manifesto listed its objectives as the expulsion of " the Americans , the French and their allies definitely from Lebanon , putting an end to any colonialist entity on our land " , submission of the Phalangists to " just power " and bringing them to justice " for the crimes they have perpetrated against Muslims and Christians " , and permitting " all the sons of our people " to choose the form of government they want , while calling on them to " pick the option of Islamic government " . After the 2006 – 08 Lebanese protests and clashes , a national unity government was formed in 2008 , with Hezbollah and its opposition allies obtaining eleven of thirty cabinets seats , which gives them veto power . In August 2008 , Lebanon 's new Cabinet unanimously approved a draft policy statement which recognized Hezbollah 's existence as an armed organization and guarantees its right to " liberate or recover occupied lands " ( such as the Shebaa Farms ) . Since 2012 , Hezbollah has helped the Syrian government during the Syrian civil war in its fight against the Syrian opposition , which Hezbollah has described as a Zionist plot and a " Wahhabi @-@ Zionist conspiracy " to destroy its alliance with Assad against Israel . It has deployed its militia in both Syria and Iraq to fight or train local forces to fight against ISIS . Once seen as a resistance movement throughout much of the Arab world , this image upon which the group 's legitimacy rested has been severely damaged due to the sectarian nature of the Syrian Civil War in which it has become embroiled . 
 Hezbollah 's status as a legitimate political party , a terrorist group , a resistance movement , or some combination thereof is a contentious issue . The Arab League , United States , France , the Gulf Cooperation Council , Australia , Canada , the Netherlands , and Israel have classified Hezbollah as a terrorist organization . The European Union , New Zealand and the United Kingdom have proscribed Hezbollah 's military wing as a terrorist organization , while making a distinction with Hezbollah 's political wing . Russia considers Hezbollah a legitimate sociopolitical organization . China remains neutral , and maintains contacts with Hezbollah . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 1980s = = = 
 Hezbollah emerged in South Lebanon during a consolidation of Shia militias as a rival to the older Amal Movement . Hezbollah played a significant role in the Lebanese civil war , opposing American forces in 1982 – 83 and opposing Amal and Syria during the 1985 – 88 War of the Camps . However , Hezbollah 's early primary focus was ending Israel 's occupation of southern Lebanon following Israel 's 1982 invasion and siege of Beirut . Amal , the main Lebanese Shia political group , initiated guerrilla warfare . In 2006 , former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak stated , " When we entered Lebanon … there was no Hezbollah . We were accepted with perfumed rice and flowers by the Shia in the south . It was our presence there that created Hezbollah " . 
 Hezbollah waged an asymmetric war using suicide attacks against the Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) and Israeli targets outside of Lebanon . Hezbollah is reputed to have been among the first Islamic resistance groups in the Middle East to use the tactics of suicide bombing , assassination , and capturing foreign soldiers , as well as murders and hijackings . Hezbollah also employed more conventional military tactics and weaponry , notably Katyusha rockets and other missiles . At the end of the Lebanese Civil War in 1990 , despite the Taif Agreement asking for the " disbanding of all Lebanese and non @-@ Lebanese militias , " Syria , which controlled Lebanon at that time , allowed Hezbollah to maintain their arsenal and control Shia areas along the border with Israel . 
 = = = After 1990 = = = 
 In the 1990s , Hezbollah transformed from a revolutionary group into a political one , in a process which is described as the <unk> of Hezbollah . Unlike its uncompromising revolutionary stance in the 1980s , Hezbollah conveyed a lenient stance towards the Lebanese state . 
 In 1992 Hezbollah decided to participate in elections , and Ali Khamenei , supreme leader of Iran , endorsed it . Former Hezbollah secretary general , Subhi al @-@ <unk> , contested this decision , which led to a schism in Hezbollah . Hezbollah won all twelve seats which were on its electoral list . At the end of that year , Hezbollah began to engage in dialog with Lebanese Christians . Hezbollah regards cultural , political , and religious freedoms in Lebanon as sanctified , although it does not extend these values to groups who have relations with Israel . 
 In 1997 Hezbollah formed the multi @-@ confessional Lebanese Brigades to Fighting the Israeli Occupation in an attempt to revive national and secular resistance against Israel , thereby marking the " <unk> " of resistance . 
 The Lebanese Daily Star newspaper reported on April 14 , 2014 that three Hezbollah members had been arrested in Thailand . The information was obtained from a specialist Thai intelligence website that identified a Thai citizen , Y. Ayyad , described as a Hezbollah member working out of a unit in East Asia , while the two Lebanese nationals that were arrested , D. Farhat and B. <unk> , were considered " suspects . " 
 = = = Islamic Jihad Organization ( IJO ) = = = 
 Whether the Islamic Jihad Organization ( IJO ) was a nom de guerre used by Hezbollah or a separate organization , is disputed . According to certain sources , IJO was identified as merely a " telephone organization " , and whose name was " used by those involved to disguise their true identity . " Hezbollah reportedly also used another name , " Islamic Resistance " ( al @-@ <unk> al @-@ Islamiyya ) , for attacks against Israel . 
 A 2003 American court decision found IJO was the name used by Hezbollah for its attacks in Lebanon , parts of the Middle East and Europe . The US , Israel and Canada consider the names " Islamic Jihad Organization " , " Organization of the Oppressed on Earth " and the " Revolutionary Justice Organization " to be synonymous with Hezbollah . 
 = = Ideology = = 
 Back in the 1980s , the ideology of Hezbollah was described as radical . It is presented in the 1985 manifesto . The first objective was fighting against American and Israeli imperialism , freedom of the occupied Southern Lebanon and all other occupied territories . The second objective was to gather all Muslims in the concept of <unk> ; then Lebanon would continue the 1979 Revolution of Iran . It also declared it would protect all Lebanese communities except the ones which collaborated with Israel , and supported all national movements — Muslim or non @-@ Muslim — throughout the world . The Ideology has been changed , and today Hezbollah is a left @-@ wing political entity focused on social injustice . 
 The ideology of Hezbollah has been summarized as Shi 'i radicalism ; Hezbollah follows the Islamic Shi 'a theology developed by Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini . Hezbollah was largely formed with the aid of the Ayatollah Khomeini 's followers in the early 1980s in order to spread Islamic revolution and follows a distinct version of Islamic Shi 'a ideology ( <unk> al @-@ <unk> or Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists ) developed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , leader of the " Islamic Revolution " in Iran . Although Hezbollah originally aimed to transform Lebanon into a formal <unk> Islamic republic , this goal has been abandoned in favor of a more inclusive approach .

 On February 16 , 1985 , Sheik Ibrahim al @-@ Amin issued Hezbollah 's manifesto . Translated excerpts from Hezbollah 's original 1985 manifesto read :

 = = = Attitudes , statements , and actions concerning Israel and Zionism = = = 
 From the inception of Hezbollah to the present , the elimination of the State of Israel has been one of Hezbollah 's primary goals . Some translations of Hezbollah 's 1985 Arabic @-@ language manifesto state that " our struggle will end only when this entity [ Israel ] is obliterated " . According to Hezbollah 's Deputy @-@ General , Na 'im Qasim , the struggle against Israel is a core belief of Hezbollah and the central rationale of Hezbollah 's existence . 
 Hezbollah says that its continued hostilities against Israel are justified as reciprocal to Israeli operations against Lebanon and as retaliation for what they claim is Israel 's occupation of Lebanese territory . Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000 , and their withdrawal was verified by the United Nations as being in accordance with resolution 425 of March 19 , 1978 , however Lebanon considers the Shebaa farms — a 26 @-@ km ² ( 10 @-@ mi ² ) piece of land captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967 war and considered by the UN to be Syrian territory occupied by Israel — to be Lebanese territory . Additionally , Hezbollah claims that three Lebanese prisoners are being held in Israel . Finally , Hezbollah consider Israel to be an illegitimate state . For these reasons , they justify their actions as acts of defensive jihad . 
 = = = Attitudes and actions concerning Jews and Judaism = = = 
 Hezbollah officials have said , on rare occasions , that it is only " anti @-@ Zionist " and not anti @-@ Semitic . However , according to scholars , " these words do not hold up upon closer examination " . Among other actions , Hezbollah actively engages in Holocaust denial and spreads anti @-@ Semitic conspiracy theories . 
 Various anti @-@ Semitic statements have been attributed to Hezbollah officials . Amal Saad @-@ <unk> , a Lebanese political analyst , argues that although Zionism has influenced Hezbollah 's anti @-@ Judaism , " it is not contingent upon it " because Hezbollah 's hatred of Jews is more religiously motivated than politically motivated . Robert S. Wistrich , a historian specializing in the study of anti @-@ Semitism , described Hezbollah 's ideology concerning Jews : 
 " The anti @-@ Semitism of Hezbollah leaders and spokesmen combines the image of seemingly invincible Jewish power ... and cunning with the contempt normally reserved for weak and cowardly enemies . Like the Hamas propaganda for holy war , that of Hezbollah has relied on the endless vilification of Jews as ' enemies of mankind , ' ' conspiratorial , obstinate , and conceited ' adversaries full of ' satanic plans ' to enslave the Arabs . It fuses traditional Islamic anti @-@ Judaism with Western conspiracy myths , Third <unk> anti @-@ Zionism , and Iranian Shiite contempt for Jews as ' ritually impure ' and corrupt infidels . Sheikh Fadlallah typically insists ... that Jews wish to undermine or obliterate Islam and Arab cultural identity in order to advance their economic and political domination . " 
 Conflicting reports say Al @-@ Manar , the Hezbollah @-@ owned and operated television station , accused either Israel or Jews of deliberately spreading HIV and other diseases to Arabs throughout the Middle East . Al @-@ Manar was criticized in the West for airing " anti @-@ Semitic propaganda " in the form of a television drama depicting a Jewish world domination conspiracy . The group has been accused by American analysts of engaging in Holocaust denial . In addition , during its 2006 war , it apologized only for killing Israel 's Arabs ( i.e. , non @-@ Jews ) . 
 In November 2009 , Hezbollah pressured a private English @-@ language school to drop reading excerpts from The Diary of Anne Frank , a book of the writings from the diary kept by the Jewish child Anne Frank while she was in hiding with her family during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands . This was after Hezbollah 's Al @-@ Manar television channel complained , asking how long Lebanon would " remain an open arena for the Zionist invasion of education ? " 
 = = Organization = = 
 At the beginning many Hezbollah leaders have maintained that the movement was " not an organization , for its members carry no cards and bear no specific responsibilities , " and that the movement does not have " a clearly defined organizational structure . " Nowadays , as Hezbollah scholar Magnus <unk> reports , Hezbollah does indeed have a formal governing structure , and in keeping with the principle of Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists ( <unk> @-@ e <unk> ) , it " concentrate [ s ] ... all authority and powers " in its religious leaders , whose decisions then " flow from the ulama down the entire community . " 
 The supreme decision @-@ making bodies of the Hezbollah were divided between the Majlis al @-@ Shura ( Consultative Assembly ) which was headed by 12 senior clerical members with responsibility for tactical decisions and supervision of overall Hizballah activity throughout Lebanon , and the Majlis al @-@ Shura al @-@ <unk> ( the Deciding Assembly ) , headed by Sheikh Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah and composed of eleven other clerics with responsibility for all strategic matters . Within the Majlis al @-@ Shura , there existed seven specialized committees dealing with ideological , financial , military and political , judicial , informational and social affairs . In turn , the Majlis al @-@ Shura and these seven committees were replicated in each of Hizballah 's three main operational areas ( the Beqaa , Beirut , and the South ) . 
 Since the Supreme Leader of Iran is the ultimate clerical authority , Hezbollah 's leaders have appealed to him " for guidance and directives in cases when Hezbollah 's collective leadership [ was ] too divided over issues and fail [ ed ] to reach a consensus . " After the death of Iran 's first Supreme Leader , Khomeini , Hezbollah 's governing bodies developed a more " independent role " and appealed to Iran less often . Since the Second Lebanon War , however , Iran has restructured Hezbollah to limit the power of Hassan Nasrallah , and invested billions of dollars " rehabilitating " Hezbollah . 
 Structurally , Hezbollah does not distinguish between its political / social activities within Lebanon and its military / jihad activities against Israel . " Hezbollah has a single leadership , " according to Naim <unk> , Hezbollah 's second in command . " All political , social and jihad work is tied to the decisions of this leadership ... The same leadership that directs the parliamentary and government work also leads jihad actions in the struggle against Israel . " 
 In 2010 , Iran 's parliamentary speaker Ali <unk> said , " Iran takes pride in Lebanon 's Islamic resistance movement for its steadfast Islamic stance . Hezbollah nurtures the original ideas of Islamic Jihad . " He also instead charged the West with having accused Iran with support of terrorism and said , " The real terrorists are those who provide the Zionist regime with military equipment to bomb the people . " 
 = = = Funding = = = 
 Money comes from Lebanese business groups , private persons , businessmen , the Lebanese diaspora involved in African diamond exploration , other Islamic groups and countries , and the taxes paid by the Shia Lebanese . Hezbollah says that the main source of its income comes from its own investment portfolios and donations by Muslims , however , Western sources maintain that Hezbollah actually receives most of its financial , training , weapons , explosives , political , diplomatic , and organizational aid from Iran and Syria . Iran is said to have given $ 400 million between 1983 and 1989 through donation . The situation has been changed due to economic problems , but Iran still funds humanitarian actions carried on by Hezbollah . According to reports released in February 2010 , Hezbollah received $ 400 million from Iran . The US estimates that Iran has been giving Hezbollah about US $ 60 – 100 million per year in financial assistance . Other estimates are as high as $ 200 @-@ million annually . In 2011 Iran earmarked $ 7 million to Hezbollah ’ s activities in the region . Hezbollah has relied also on funding from the Shi 'ite Lebanese Diaspora in West Africa , the United States and , most importantly , the Triple Frontier , or tri @-@ border area , along the junction of Paraguay , Argentina , and Brazil . U.S. law enforcement officials have identified an illegal multimillion @-@ dollar cigarette @-@ smuggling fund raising operation and a drug smuggling operation . However , Nasrallah has repeatedly denied any links between the South American drug trade and Hezbollah , calling such accusations " propaganda " and attempts " to damage the image of Hezbollah " . 
 Members of the Venezuelan government have been accused of providing financial aid to Hezbollah by the United States Department of the Treasury . According to the testimony of a former Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs , Roger Noriega , Hugo Chávez 's government gave " indispensable support " to Iran and Hezbollah in the Western Hemisphere . In an article by the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute , Noriega explained how two witnesses alleged that Ghazi Atef <unk> , a Venezuelan diplomat in Syria , was an operative of Hezbollah who used Venezuelan entities to launder money for Hezbollah with President Nicolas Maduro 's personal approval . 
 = = Social services = = 
 Hezbollah organizes an extensive social development program and runs hospitals , news services , educational facilities , and encouragement of <unk> mut ‘ ah . One of its established institutions , Jihad Al <unk> 's Reconstruction Campaign , is responsible for numerous economic and infrastructure development projects in Lebanon . Hezbollah has set up a Martyr 's Institute ( Al @-@ Shahid Social Association ) , which guarantees to provide living and education expenses " for the families of fighters who die " in battle . An IRIN news report of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs noted : 
 " Hezbollah not only has armed and political wings – it also boasts an extensive social development program . Hezbollah currently operates at least four hospitals , twelve clinics , twelve schools and two agricultural centres that provide farmers with technical assistance and training . It also has an environmental department and an extensive social assistance program . Medical care is also cheaper than in most of the country 's private hospitals and free for Hezbollah members . " 
 According to CNN , " Hezbollah did everything that a government should do , from collecting the garbage to running hospitals and repairing schools . " In July 2006 , during the war with Israel , when there was no running water in Beirut , Hezbollah was arranging supplies around the city . Lebanese Shiites " see Hezbollah as a political movement and a social service provider as much as it is a militia . " Hezbollah also rewards its guerilla members who have been wounded in battle by taking them to Hezbollah @-@ run amusement parks . 
 Hezbollah is , therefore , deeply embedded in the Lebanese society . 
 = = Political activities = = 
 Hezbollah along with Amal is one of two major political parties in Lebanon that represent the Shiite Muslims . Unlike Amal , whose support is predominantly in the South of the country , Hezbollah maintains broad based support in all three areas of Lebanon with a majority Shia Muslim population : in the South , in Beirut and its surrounding area , and in the northern Beqaa valley and <unk> region . It holds 14 of the 128 seats in the Parliament of Lebanon and is a member of the Resistance and Development Bloc . According to Daniel L. <unk> , it 's " the most powerful single political movement in Lebanon . " Hezbollah , along with the Amal Movement , represents most of Lebanese Shi 'a . However , unlike Amal , Hezbollah has not disarmed . Hezbollah participates in the Parliament of Lebanon . 
 Hezbollah has been one of the main parties of March 8 Alliance since March 2005 . Although Hezbollah had joined the new government in 2005 , it remained staunchly opposed to the March 14 Alliance . On December 1 , 2006 , these groups began the 2006 – 2008 Lebanese political protests , a series of protests and sit @-@ ins in opposition to the government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora . 
 On May 7 , 2008 , Lebanon 's 17 @-@ month @-@ long political crisis spiraled out of control . The fighting was sparked by a government move to shut down Hezbollah 's telecommunication network and remove Beirut Airport 's security chief over alleged ties to Hezbollah . Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the government 's decision to declare the group 's military telecommunications network illegal was a " declaration of war " on the organization , and demanded that the government revoke it . Hezbollah @-@ led opposition fighters seized control of several West Beirut neighborhoods from Future Movement militiamen loyal to the backed government , in street battles that left 11 dead and 30 wounded . The opposition @-@ seized areas were then handed over to the Lebanese Army . The army also pledged to resolve the dispute and has reversed the decisions of the government by letting Hezbollah preserve its telecoms network and re @-@ instating the airport 's security chief . At the end , rival Lebanese leaders reached consensus over Doha Agreement on May 21 , 2008 , to end the 18 @-@ month political feud that exploded into fighting and nearly drove the country to a new civil war . On the basis of this agreement , Hezbollah and its opposition allies were effectively granted veto power in Lebanon 's parliament . At the end of the conflicts , National unity government was formed by Fouad Siniora on July 11 , 2008 and Hezbollah has one minister and controls eleven of thirty seats in the cabinet . 
 Hezbollah currently sits in the opposition March 8 alliance . However , they withdrew from the government citing inability to discuss issues over the Special Tribunal for Lebanon . 
 = = = Media operations = = = 
 Hezbollah operates a satellite television station , Al @-@ Manar TV ( " the Lighthouse " ) , and a radio station , al @-@ Nour ( " the Light " ) . Al @-@ Manar broadcasts from Beirut , Lebanon . Hezbollah launched the station in 1991 with the help of Iranian funds . Al @-@ Manar , the self @-@ proclaimed " Station of the Resistance , " ( qanat al @-@ <unk> ) is a key player in what Hezbollah calls its " psychological warfare against the Zionist enemy " and an integral part of Hezbollah 's plan to spread its message to the entire Arab world . In addition , Hezbollah has a weekly publication , Al <unk> , which was established in 1984 . It is the only media outlet which is openly affiliated with the organization . 
 Hezbollah 's television station Al @-@ Manar airs programming designed to inspire suicide attacks in Gaza , the West Bank , and Iraq . Al @-@ Manar 's transmission in France is prohibited due to promotion of Holocaust denial , a criminal offense in France . The United States lists Al @-@ Manar television network as a terrorist organization . Al @-@ Manar was designated as a " Specially Designated Global Terrorist entity , " and banned by the United States in December 2004 . It has also been banned by France , Spain and Germany . Materials aimed at instilling principles of nationalism and Islam in children are an aspect of Hezbollah 's media operations . The Hezbollah Central Internet Bureau released a video game in 2003 entitled Special Force and a sequel in 2007 in which players are rewarded with points and weapons for killing Israelis . In 2012 , Al @-@ Manar aired a television special praising an 8 @-@ year @-@ old boy who raised money for Hezbollah and said : " When I grow up , I will be a communist resistance warrior with Hezbollah , fighting the United States and Israel , I will tear them to pieces and drive them out of Lebanon , the Golan and Palestine , which I love very dearly . " 
 = = Secret services = = 
 Hezbollah 's secret services have been described as " one of the best in the world " , and have even infiltrated the Israeli army . Hezbollah 's secret services collaborate with the Lebanese intelligence agencies . 
 In the summer of 1982 , Hezbollah 's Special Security Apparatus was created by Hussein al @-@ Khalil , now a " top political adviser to Nasrallah , " and while Hezbollah 's counterintelligence was initially managed by Iran 's Quds Force , the organization continued to grow during the 1990s . By 2008 , scholar Carl Anthony Wege writes , " Hizballah had obtained complete dominance over Lebanon ’ s official state counterintelligence apparatus , which now constituted a Hizballah asset for counterintelligence purposes . " This close connection with Lebanese intelligence helped bolster Hezbollah 's financial counterintelligence unit . 
 According to Ahmad <unk> , Hezbollah 's counterintelligence service is divided into Amn al @-@ <unk> , responsible for " external " or " encounter " security ; and Amn al @-@ Hizb , which protects the organization 's integrity and its leaders . According to Wege , Amn al @-@ <unk> " may have received specialized intelligence training in Iran and possibly North Korea " . The organization also includes a military security component , as well as an External Security Organization ( al @-@ Amn al @-@ <unk> or Unit 910 ) that operates covertly outside Lebanon . 
 Successful Hezbollah counterintelligence operations include thwarting the CIA 's attempted kidnapping of foreign operations chief Hassan <unk> in 1994 ; the 1997 manipulation of a double agent that led to the <unk> Ambush ; and the 2000 kidnapping of alleged Mossad agent <unk> Tannenbaum . Hezbollah also collaborated with the Lebanese government in 2006 to detect <unk> al @-@ Alam , a former colonel , as an Israeli spy . Also , the organization recruited IDF Lieutenant Colonel Omar al @-@ <unk> , who was convicted in 2006 of conducting surveillance for Hezbollah . In 2009 , Hezbollah apprehended Marwan Faqih , a garage owner who installed tracking devices in Hezbollah @-@ owned vehicles . 
 Hezbollah 's counterintelligence apparatus also uses electronic surveillance and intercept technologies . By 2011 , Hezbollah counterintelligence began to use software to analyze cellphone data and detect espionage ; suspicious callers were then subjected to conventional surveillance . In the mid @-@ 1990s , Hezbollah was able to " download unencrypted video feeds from Israeli drones , " and Israeli SIGINT efforts intensified after the 2000 withdrawal from Lebanon . With possible help from Iran and the Russian FSB , Hezbollah augmented its electronic counterintelligence capabilities , and succeeded by 2008 in detecting Israeli bugs near Mount <unk> and in the organization 's fiber optic network . 
 = = Armed strength = = 
 Hezbollah does not reveal its armed strength . Mustafa <unk> , security director at the Dubai @-@ based Gulf Research Centre , estimated that Hezbollah 's armed wing comprises 1 @,@ 000 full @-@ time Hezbollah members , along with a further 6 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 volunteers . According to the Iranian Fars News Agency , Hezbollah has up to 65 @,@ 000 fighters . It is often described as more militarily powerful than the Lebanese Army . Israeli commander Gui Zur called Hezbollah " by far the greatest guerrilla group in the world " . 
 Hezbollah possesses the Katyusha @-@ 122 rocket , which has a range of 29 km ( 18 mi ) and carries a 15 @-@ kg ( 33 @-@ lb ) warhead . Hezbollah also possesses about 100 long @-@ range missiles . They include the Iranian @-@ made Fajr @-@ 3 and Fajr @-@ 5 , the latter with a range of 75 km ( 47 mi ) , enabling it to strike the Israeli port of Haifa , and the <unk> @-@ 1 , with an estimated 150 km ( 93 mi ) range , which can reach Tel Aviv . Fajr @-@ 3 missiles have a range of 40 km ( 25 mi ) and a 45 @-@ kg ( 99 @-@ lb ) warhead , and Fajr @-@ 5 missiles , which extend to 72 km ( 45 mi ) , also hold 45 @-@ kg ( 99 @-@ lb ) warheads . It was reported that Hezbollah is in possession of Scud missiles that were provided to them by Syria . Syria denied the reports . According to various reports , Hezbollah is armed with anti @-@ tank guided missiles , namely , the Russian @-@ made AT @-@ 3 Sagger , AT @-@ 4 <unk> , AT @-@ 5 <unk> , AT @-@ 13 <unk> @-@ 2 ' Metis @-@ M ' , <unk> @-@ 14 <unk> ' <unk> ' ; Iranian @-@ made Ra 'ad ( version of AT @-@ 3 Sagger ) , <unk> ( version of AT @-@ 5 <unk> ) , <unk> ( version of BGM @-@ 71 TOW ) ; and European @-@ made MILAN missiles . These weapons have been used against IDF soldiers , causing many of the deaths during the 2006 Lebanon War . A small number of <unk> @-@ 2s ( Iranian @-@ made version of M47 Dragon ) were also used in the war . 
 For air defense , Hezbollah has anti @-@ aircraft weapons that include the ZU @-@ 23 artillery and the man @-@ portable , shoulder @-@ fired SA @-@ 7 and SA @-@ 18 surface @-@ to @-@ air missile ( SAM ) . One of the most effective weapons deployed by Hezbollah has been the C @-@ 802 anti @-@ ship missile . 
 In April 2010 , U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates claimed that the Hezbollah has far more missiles and rockets than the majority of countries , and said that Syria and Iran are providing weapons to the organization . Israel also claims that Syria is providing the organization with these weapons . Syria has denied supplying these weapons and views these claims as an Israeli excuse for an attack . Leaked cables from American diplomats suggest that the United States has been trying unsuccessfully to prevent Syria from " supplying arms to Hezbollah in Lebanon " , and that Hezbollah has " amassed a huge stockpile ( of arms ) since its 2006 war with Israel " ; the arms were described as " increasingly sophisticated . " Gates added that Hezbollah is possibly armed with chemical or biological weapons , as well as 65 @-@ mile ( 105 km ) anti @-@ ship missiles that could threaten U.S. ships . 
 As of 2010 , the Israeli government believed Hezbollah had an arsenal of more than 15 @,@ 000 long @-@ range rockets stationed on its border with Lebanon . Some of these missiles were said to be capable of penetrating cities as far away as Eilat . The IDF has accused Hezbollah of storing these rockets beneath hospitals , schools , and civilian homes . The Israeli Ambassador to United States Michael Oren expressed deep concern with the revelation . 
 The Syrian @-@ Iranian backed Hizbullah poses a very serious threat to Israel ... Hizbullah today now has four times as many rockets as it had during the 2006 Lebanon war . These rockets are longer @-@ range . Every city in Israel is within range right now , including Eilat . 
 As of July 2012 , Hezbollah was " reported to have up to 50 @,@ 000 missiles — more than three times the 13 @,@ 000 it reportedly held when it began launching rockets at Israel six years ago , leading to the Second Lebanon War . " By June 2013 , this figure had risen to 60 – 80 @,@ 000 missiles and rockets . Hezbollah has also used drones against Israel , by penetrating air defense systems , in a report verified by Nasrallah , who added , " This is only part of our capabilities " . 
 Israeli military officials and analysts have also drawn attention to the experience and weaponry the group would have gained from the involvement of thousands of its fighters in the Syrian Civil War . " This kind of experience cannot be bought , " said Gabi <unk> , director of the military and strategic affairs program at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University . " It is an additional factor that we will have to deal with . There is no replacement for experience , and it is not to be scoffed at . "

 Hezbollah has a military branch known as the Jihad Council , one component of which is Al @-@ <unk> al @-@ Islamiyya ( " The Islamic Resistance " ) , and is the possible sponsor of a number of lesser @-@ known militant groups , some of which may be little more than fronts for Hezbollah itself , including the Organization of the Oppressed , the Revolutionary Justice Organization , the Organization of Right Against Wrong , and Followers of the Prophet Muhammad . 
 United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559 called for the disarmament of militia with the Taif agreement at the end of the Lebanese civil war . Hezbollah denounced , and protested against , the resolution . The 2006 military conflict with Israel has increased the controversy . Failure to disarm remains a violation of the resolution and agreement as well as subsequent United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 . Since then both Israel and Hezbollah have asserted that the organization has gained in military strength . A Lebanese public opinion poll taken in August 2006 shows that most of the Shia did not believe that Hezbollah should disarm after the 2006 Lebanon war , while the majority of Sunni , Druze and Christians believed that they should . The Lebanese cabinet , under president Michel Suleiman and Prime Minister Fouad Siniora , guidelines state that Hezbollah enjoys the right to " liberate occupied lands . " In 2009 , a Hezbollah commander ( speaking on condition of anonymity ) said , " [ W ] e have far more rockets and missiles [ now ] than we did in 2006 . "

 The Lebanese Resistance Brigades ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> <unk> Saraya al @-@ <unk> al @-@ <unk> ) , also known as the Lebanese Brigades to Resist the Israeli Occupation , were formed by Hezbollah in 1997 as a <unk> ( Christian , Druze , Sunni and Shia ) volunteer force to combat the Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon . With the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000 , the organization was disbanded . 
 In 2009 , the Resistance Brigades were reactivated , mainly comprising Sunni supporters from the southern city of Sidon . Its strength was reduced in late 2013 from 500 to 200 – 250 due to residents complaints about some fighters of the group exacerbating tensions with the local community .

 Between 1982 and 1986 , there were 36 suicide attacks in Lebanon directed against American , French and Israelis forces by 41 individuals , killing 659 . Hezbollah denies involvement in some of these attacks , though it has been accused of being involved or linked to some or all of these attacks : 
 The 1982 – 1983 Tyre headquarters bombings 
 The April 1983 U.S. Embassy bombing ( by the Islamic Jihad Organization ) ,

 Hezbollah has been involved in several cases of armed conflict with Israel : 
 During the 1982 – 2000 South Lebanon conflict , Hezbollah waged a guerrilla campaign against Israeli forces occupying Southern Lebanon . In 1982 , the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) was based in Southern Lebanon and was firing Katyusha rockets into northern Israel from Lebanon . Israel invaded Lebanon to evict the PLO , and Hezbollah became an armed organization to expel the Israelis . Hezbollah 's strength was enhanced by the dispatching of one thousand to two thousand members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and the financial backing of Iran . Iranian clerics , most notably <unk> <unk> supervised this activity . It became the main politico @-@ military force among the Shia community in Lebanon and the main arm of what became known later as the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon . With the collapse of the SLA , and the rapid advance of Hezbollah forces , Israel withdrew on May 24 , 2000 six weeks before the announced July 7 date . " Hezbollah held a victory parade , and its popularity in Lebanon rose . Israel withdrew in accordance with 1978 's United Nations Security Council Resolution 425 . Hezbollah and many analysts considered this a victory for the movement , and since then its popularity has been boosted in Lebanon . 
 On July 25 , 1993 , following Hezbollah 's killing of seven Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon , Israel launched Operation Accountability ( known in Lebanon as the Seven Day War ) , during which the IDF carried out their heaviest artillery and air attacks on targets in southern Lebanon since 1982 . The aim of the operation was to eradicate the threat posed by Hezbollah and to force the civilian population north to Beirut so as to put pressure on the Lebanese Government to restrain Hezbollah . The fighting ended when an unwritten understanding was agreed to by the warring parties . Apparently , the 1993 understanding provided that Hezbollah combatants would not fire rockets at northern Israel , while Israel would not attack civilians or civilian targets in Lebanon . 
 In April 1996 , after continued Hezbollah rocket attacks on Israeli civilians , the Israeli armed forces launched Operation Grapes of Wrath , which was intended to wipe out Hezbollah 's base in southern Lebanon . Over 100 Lebanese refugees were killed by the shelling of a UN base at Qana , in what the Israeli military said was a mistake . Finally , following several days of negotiations , the two sides signed the Grapes of Wrath Understandings on April 26 , 1996 . A cease @-@ fire was agreed upon between Israel and Hezbollah , which would be effective on April 27 , 1996 . Both sides agreed that civilians should not be targeted , which meant that Hezbollah would be allowed to continue its military activities against IDF forces inside Lebanon .

 The 2006 Lebanon War was a 34 @-@ day military conflict in Lebanon and northern Israel . The principal parties were Hezbollah paramilitary forces and the Israeli military . The conflict was precipitated by a cross @-@ border raid by Hezbollah during which they kidnapped and killed Israeli soldiers . The conflict began on July 12 , 2006 when Hezbollah militants fired rockets at Israeli border towns as a diversion for an anti @-@ tank missile attack on two armored Humvees patrolling the Israeli side of the border fence , killing three , injuring two , and seizing two Israeli soldiers . 
 Israel responded with airstrikes and artillery fire on targets in Lebanon that damaged Lebanese infrastructure , including Beirut 's Rafic Hariri International Airport ( which Israel said that Hezbollah used to import weapons and supplies ) , an air and naval blockade , and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon . Hezbollah then launched more rockets into northern Israel and engaged the Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) in guerrilla warfare from hardened positions . The war continued until August 14 , 2006 . Hezbollah was responsible for thousands of Katyusha rocket attacks against Israeli civilian towns and cities in northern Israel , which Hezbollah said were in retaliation for Israel 's killing of civilians and targeting Lebanese infrastructure . The conflict is believed to have killed 1 @,@ 191 – 1 @,@ 300 Lebanese citizens including combatants and 165 Israelis including soldiers .

Figures in the March 14 Forces stated in response that <unk> was presenting another excuse to hold on to its arms .

The Lebanese man was in possession of photographs of Israeli targets and had information on Israeli airlines flying back and forth from Cyprus , and planned to blow up a plane or tour bus . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Iran assisted the Lebanese man with planning the attacks .

 Following an investigation into the 2012 Burgas bus bombing terrorist attack against Israeli citizens in Bulgaria , the Bulgarian government officially accused the Lebanese @-@ militant movement Hezbollah of committing the attack .

 <unk> <unk> , Bulgaria 's interior minister , reported that the two suspects responsible were members of the militant wing of Hezbollah ; he said the suspected terrorists entered Bulgaria on June 28 and remained until July 18 . Israel had already previously suspected Hezbollah for the attack . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the report " further corroboration of what we have already known , that Hezbollah and its Iranian patrons are orchestrating a worldwide campaign of terror that is spanning countries and continents . " Netanyahu said that the attack in Bulgaria was just one of many that Hezbollah and Iran have planned and carried out , including attacks in Thailand , Kenya , Turkey , India , Azerbaijan , Cyprus and Georgia . 
 John Brennan , Director of the Central Intelligence Agency , has said that " Bulgaria 's investigation exposes Hezbollah for what it is – a terrorist group that is willing to recklessly attack innocent men , women and children , and that poses a real and growing threat not only to Europe , but to the rest of the world . " The result of the Bulgarian investigation comes at a time when Israel has been petitioning the European Union to join the United States in designating Hezbollah as a terrorist organization .

 On February 14 , 2005 , former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri was killed , along with 21 others , when his motorcade was struck by a roadside bomb in Beirut . He had been PM during 1992 – 1998 and 2000 – 2004 . In 2009 , the United Nations special tribunal investigating the murder of Hariri reportedly found evidence linking Hezbollah to the murder . 
 In August 2010 , in response to notification that the UN tribunal would indict some Hezbollah members , Hassan Nasrallah said Israel was looking for a way to assassinate Hariri as early as 1993 in order to create political chaos that would force Syria to withdraw from Lebanon , and to perpetuate an anti @-@ Syrian atmosphere [ in Lebanon ] in the wake of the assassination . He went on to say that in 1996 Hezbollah apprehended an agent working for Israel by the name of Ahmed Nasrallah – no relation to Hassan Nasrallah – who allegedly contacted Hariri 's security detail and told them that he had solid proof that Hezbollah was planning to take his life . Hariri then contacted Hezbollah and advised them of the situation . Saad Hariri responded that the UN should investigate these claims . 
 On June 30 , 2011 , the Special Tribunal for Lebanon , established to investigate the death of Hariri , issued arrest warrants against four senior members of Hezbollah , including Mustafa Badr Al Din . On July 3 , Hassan Nasrallah rejected the indictment and denounced the tribunal as a plot against the party , vowing that the named persons would not be arrested under any circumstances . 
 = = = Involvement in the Syrian Civil War = = = 
 Hezbollah has long been an ally of the Ba 'ath government of Syria , led by the Al @-@ Assad family . Hezbollah has helped the Syrian government during the Syrian civil war in its fight against the Syrian opposition , which Hezbollah has described as a <unk> plot to destroy its alliance with al @-@ Assad against Israel . <unk> <unk> opined that Hezbollah 's support for al @-@ Assad in the Syrian war has " transformed " it from a group with " support among the Sunni for defeating Israel in a battle in 2006 " into a " strictly Shia paramilitary force " . 
 In August 2012 , the United States sanctioned Hezbollah for its alleged role in the war . General Secretary Nasrallah denied Hezbollah had been fighting on behalf of the Syrian government , stating in an October 12 , 2012 , speech that " right from the start the Syrian opposition has been telling the media that Hizbullah sent 3 @,@ 000 fighters to Syria , which we have denied " . However , according to the Lebanese Daily Star newspaper , Nasrallah said in the same speech that Hezbollah fighters helped the Syrian government " retain control of some 23 strategically located villages [ in Syria ] inhabited by Shiites of Lebanese citizenship " . Nasrallah said that Hezbollah fighters have died in Syria doing their " jihadist duties " . 
 In 2012 , Hezbollah fighters crossed the border from Lebanon and took over eight villages in the Al @-@ Qusayr District of Syria . On February 16 – 17 , 2013 , Syrian opposition groups claimed that Hezbollah , backed by the Syrian military , attacked three neighboring Sunni villages controlled by the Free Syrian Army ( FSA ) . An FSA spokesman said , " Hezbollah 's invasion is the first of its kind in terms of organisation , planning and coordination with the Syrian regime 's air force " . Hezbollah said three Lebanese Shiites , " acting in self @-@ defense " , were killed in the clashes with the FSA . Lebanese security sources said that the three were Hezbollah members . In response , the FSA allegedly attacked two Hezbollah positions on February 21 ; one in Syria and one in Lebanon . Five days later , it said it destroyed a convoy carrying Hezbollah fighters and Syrian officers to Lebanon , killing all the passengers . 
 In January 2013 , a weapons convoy carrying SA @-@ 17 anti @-@ aircraft missiles to Hezbollah was destroyed allegedly by the Israeli Air Force . A nearby research center for chemical weapons was also damaged . A similar attack on weapons destined for Hezbollah occurred in May of the same year . 
 The leaders of the March 14 alliance and other prominent Lebanese figures called on Hezbollah to end its involvement in Syria and said it is putting Lebanon at risk . Subhi al @-@ <unk> , Hezbollah 's former leader , said " Hezbollah should not be defending the criminal regime that kills its own people and that has never fired a shot in defense of the Palestinians " . He said " those Hezbollah fighters who are killing children and terrorizing people and destroying houses in Syria will go to hell " . The Consultative Gathering , a group of Shia and Sunni leaders in Baalbek @-@ Hermel , also called on Hezbollah not to " interfere " in Syria . They said , " Opening a front against the Syrian people and dragging Lebanon to war with the Syrian people is very dangerous and will have a negative impact on the relations between the two " . Walid Jumblatt , leader of the Progressive Socialist Party , also called on Hezbollah to end its involvement and claimed that " Hezbollah is fighting inside Syria with orders from Iran " . Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi condemned Hezbollah by saying , " We stand against Hezbollah in its aggression against the Syrian people . There is no space or place for Hezbollah in Syria " . Support for Hezbollah among the Syrian public has weakened since the involvement of Hezbollah and Iran in propping up the Assad regime during the civil war . 
 On May 12 , 2013 , Hezbollah with the Syrian army attempted to retake part of Qusayr . In Lebanon , there has been " a recent increase in the funerals of Hezbollah fighters " and " Syrian rebels have shelled Hezbollah @-@ controlled areas . " 
 On May 25 , 2013 , Nasrallah announced that Hezbollah is fighting in the Syrian Civil War against Islamic extremists and " pledged that his group will not allow Syrian militants to control areas that border Lebanon " . He confirmed that Hezbollah was fighting in the strategic Syrian town of Al @-@ Qusayr on the same side as Assad 's forces . In the televised address , he said , " If Syria falls in the hands of America , Israel and the <unk> , the people of our region will go into a dark period . " 
 On May 26 , 2013 , two rockets hit a Hezbollah area of Beirut injuring five people whilst another two rockets caused property damage to buildings in the al @-@ Hermel district of Beirut . Syrian rebels have been blamed for the attack as they had promised to attack Hezbollah targets in Lebanon in retaliation for their helping the Syrian army particularly in the border town of Al @-@ Qusayr . Syrian rebels have also shelled al @-@ Hermel previously . 
 On May 28 , 2013 , Free Syrian Army General Salim Idris gave Hezbollah " 24 hours to withdraw from Syria " or he may order FSA units to attack Hezbollah targets in Lebanon . 
 In early June , Hezbollah has now committed fighters to the battle in Aleppo , some 2 @,@ 000 , reportedly putting strain on the organisation . This has resulted in Hezbollah introducing a change to its rotation policy for its fighters from 7 days fighting followed by 7 days leave , Hezbollah has increased it to 20 days fighting and followed by 7 days leave for its fighters . 
 According to Israeli military sources up to 2000 Hezbollah fighters were killed in Syria and 5000 wounded .

 Although Hezbollah has denounced certain attacks on civilians , some people accuse the organization of the bombing of an Argentine synagogue in 1994 . Argentine prosecutor Alberto <unk> , Marcelo Martinez Burgos , and their " staff of some 45 people " said that Hezbollah and their contacts in Iran were responsible for the 1994 bombing of a Jewish cultural center in Argentina , in which " [ e ] <unk> @-@ five people were killed and more than 200 others injured . " In June 2002 , shortly after the Israeli government launched Operation Defensive Shield , Nasrallah gave a speech in which he defended and praised suicide bombings of Israeli targets by members of Palestinian groups for " creating a deterrence and equalizing fear . " Nasrallah stated that " in occupied Palestine , there is no difference between a soldier and a civilian , for they are all invaders , occupiers and usurpers of the land . " 
 In August 2012 , the United States State Department 's counter @-@ terrorism coordinator Daniel Benjamin warned that Hezbollah may attack Europe at any time without any warning . Benjamin said , " Hezbollah maintains a presence in Europe and its recent activities demonstrate that it is not constrained by concerns about collateral damage or political fallout that could result from conducting operations there ... We assess that Hezbollah could attack in Europe or elsewhere at any time with little or no warning " and that Hezbollah has " stepped up terrorist campaigns around the world . "

 Hezbollah has close relations with Iran . It also has ties with the leadership in Syria , specifically President Hafez al @-@ Assad ( until his death in 2000 ) supported it . It 's also a close Assad ally , and its leader pledged support to the embattled Syrian leader . Although Hezbollah and Hamas are not organizationally linked , Hezbollah provides military training as well as financial and moral support to the Sunni Palestinian group . Furthermore , Hezbollah is a strong supporter of the ongoing Al @-@ Aqsa Intifada . 
 American and Israeli counter @-@ terrorism officials claim that Hezbollah has ( or had ) links to Al Qaeda , although Hezbollah 's leaders deny these allegations . Also , some al @-@ Qaeda leaders , like Abu Musab al @-@ Zarqawi and Wahhabi clerics , consider Hezbollah to be apostate . But United States intelligence officials speculate that there has been contact between Hezbollah and low @-@ level al @-@ Qaeda figures who fled Afghanistan for Lebanon . However , Michel Samaha , Lebanon 's minister of information , has said that Hezbollah has been an important ally of the government in the war against terrorist groups , and described the " American attempt to link Hezbollah to al @-@ Qaeda " to be " astonishing " .

 According to Michel Samaha , Lebanon 's minister of information , Hezbollah is seen as a legitimate resistance organization that has defended its land against an Israeli occupying force and has consistently stood up to the Israeli army . 
 According to a survey released by the " Beirut Center for Research and Information " on July 26 during the 2006 Lebanon War , 87 percent of Lebanese support Hezbollah 's " retaliatory attacks on northern Israel " , a rise of 29 percentage points from a similar poll conducted in February . More striking , however , was the level of support for Hezbollah 's resistance from non @-@ Shiite communities . Eighty percent of Christians polled supported Hezbollah , along with 80 percent of Druze and 89 percent of Sunnis . 
 In a poll of Lebanese adults taken in 2004 , 6 % of respondents gave unqualified support to the statement " Hezbollah should be disarmed " . 41 % reported unqualified disagreement . A poll of Gaza Strip and West Bank residents indicated that 79 @.@ 6 % had " a very good view " of Hezbollah , and most of the remainder had a " good view " . Polls of Jordanian adults in December 2005 and June 2006 showed that 63 @.@ 9 % and 63 @.@ 3 % , respectively , considered Hezbollah to be a legitimate resistance <unk> the December 2005 poll , only 6 % of Jordanian adults considered Hezbollah to be terrorist . 
 A July 2006 USA Today / Gallup poll found that 83 % of the 1 @,@ 005 Americans polled blamed Hezbollah , at least in part , for the 2006 Lebanon War , compared to 66 % who blamed Israel to some degree . Additionally , 76 % disapproved of the military action Hezbollah took in Israel , compared to 38 % who disapproved of Israel 's military action in Lebanon . A poll in August 2006 by ABC News and the Washington Post found that 68 % of the 1 @,@ 002 Americans polled blamed Hezbollah , at least in part , for the civilian casualties in Lebanon during the 2006 Lebanon War , compared to 31 % who blamed Israel to some degree .

 In 2010 , a survey of Muslims in Lebanon showed that 94 % of Lebanese Shia supported Hezbollah , while 84 % of the Sunni Muslims held an unfavorable opinion of the group . 
 Some public opinion has started to turn against Hezbollah for their support of Syrian President Assad 's attacks on the opposition movement in Syria .

 = = = Designation as a terrorist organization or resistance movement = = = 
 Hezbollah 's status as a legitimate political party , a terrorist group , a resistance movement , or some combination thereof is a contentious issue . 
 There is a " wide difference " between American and Arab perception of Hezbollah . Several Western countries officially classify Hezbollah or its external security wing as a terrorist organization , and some of their violent acts have been described as terrorist attacks . However , throughout most of the Arab and Muslim worlds , Hezbollah is referred to as a resistance movement , engaged in national defense . Even within Lebanon , sometimes Hezbollah 's status as either a " militia " or " national resistance " has been contentious . In Lebanon , although not universally well @-@ liked , Hezbollah is widely seen as a legitimate national resistance organization defending Lebanon , and actually described by Lebanese information minister as an important ally in fighting terrorist groups . In Arab world , Hezbollah is generally seen either as a destabilizing force that functions as Iran 's pawn by rentier states like Egypt and Saudi Arabia , or as a popular sociopolitical guerilla movement that exemplifies strong leadership , meaningful political action , and a commitment to social justice . 
 In May 2013 , France and Germany released statements that it will join other European countries in calling for a EU @-@ blacklisting of Hezbollah as a terror group . 
 Countries and organizations below have officially listed Hezbollah in at least some part as a terrorist organization . 
 Russia considers Hezbollah a legitimate sociopolitical organization . China remains neutral , and maintains contacts with Hezbollah .

 The United States Department of State has designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization since 1995 . The group remains on Foreign Terrorist Organization and Specially Designated Terrorist lists . According to the Congressional Research Service , " The U.S. government holds Hezbollah responsible for a number of attacks and hostage takings targeting Americans in Lebanon during the 1980s , including the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in April 1983 and the bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in October 1983 , which together killed 258 Americans . Hezbollah ’ s operations outside of Lebanon , including its participation in bombings of Israeli and Jewish targets in Argentina during the 1990s and more recent training and liaison activities with Shiite insurgents in Iraq , have cemented the organization ’ s reputation among U.S. policy makers as a capable and deadly adversary with potential global reach . " 
 The United Kingdom was the first government to attempt to make a distinction between Hezbollah 's political and military wings , declaring the latter a terrorist group in July 2008 after Hezbollah confirmed its association with Imad <unk> . In 2012 , British " Foreign Minister William Hague urged the European Union to place Hezbollah 's military wing on its list of terrorist organizations . " The United States also urged the EU to classify Hezbollah as a terrorist organization . In light of findings implicating Hezbollah in the bus bombing in Burgas , Bulgaria in 2012 , there was renewed discussion within the European Union to label Hezbollah 's military wing as a terrorist group . On July 22 , 2013 , the European Union agreed to blacklist Hezbollah 's military wing over concerns about its growing role in the Syrian conflict . 
 In the midst of the 2006 conflict between Hezbollah and Israel , Russia 's government declined to include Hezbollah in a newly released list of terrorist organizations , with Yuri <unk> , the head of anti @-@ terrorism for the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation , saying that they list only organizations which represent " the greatest threat to the security of our country " . Prior to the release of the list , Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov called " on Hezbollah to stop resorting to any terrorist methods , including attacking neighboring states . " 
 The Quartet 's fourth member , the United Nations , does not maintain such a list , however , the United Nations has made repeated calls for Hezbollah to disarm and accused the group of destabilizing the region and causing harm to Lebanese civilians .
