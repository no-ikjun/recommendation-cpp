 In 1881 , a Brulé Lakota Sioux named Crow Dog killed his government @-@ installed chief . Crow Dog was detained and tried for murder . However , he contended that the United States held no jurisdiction on the reservation . The Supreme Court agreed , confirming Crow Dog ’ s assertion that they lacked jurisdiction because the crime occurred in Indian country between two Indians . In the opinion issued by Justice Stanley Matthews for the Supreme Court in Ex parte Crow Dog in 1883 , the Court implied that if Congress intended to exert legislative authority over these tribes they must pass an explicit law granting jurisdiction to the federal courts over Indian @-@ on @-@ Indian crime in Indian country , and then the Court would confirm its constitutionality . 
 In response , Congress debated the need and importance of teaching Indians regard for the rule of law . Further , it was argued , that if an Indian committed a crime he could be tried under the laws of the United States . Congress ultimately passed an addendum to the Indian Appropriations Act of March 3 , 1885 , more commonly known as the Major Crimes Act , claiming exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government to prosecute Indians for seven major crimes anywhere in the nation , if the land is in Indian country , including Indian reservations . The seven original crimes included in the 1885 act ( the list is now 15 crimes ) were murder , manslaughter , rape , assault with intent to kill , arson , burglary , and larceny . 
 = = = Hoopa Valley Reservation = = = 
 The Hoopa Valley Reservation was created by executive order in 1864 . At the time the reservation was formed , three unique bands of Indian tribes lived on different parts of the Klamath River , each with its own language . The Yurok lived on the Lower Klamath , the Karuk occupied the Upper Klamath and the Hupa lived at the confluence of the Trinity and Klamath Rivers in Humboldt County , California . The reservation was supposed to be a home for other tribes within the region . 
 The tribes living along the river had long @-@ established rules for property rights and ownership , including how property was to be passed down from one generation to the next . In some cases , families owned lands that were located a substantial distance from their " home " village . 
 In charge of the reservation was the Indian agent , Major Charles Porter , who by commanding the local military garrison ( Fort Gaston ) on the reservation was charged with the de facto responsibility for the people on the reservation . Without legal authority and against government policy , Porter allotted small parcels of land to the local Indian people , thus upsetting an age @-@ old property rights system among families in the Klamath River Valley . On several occasions , Agent Porter had been called out to Kagama and Iyouse 's homes to mediate their property dispute . Shortly before the murder , Kagama requested title to the land upon which he built his home . 
 = = = The crime and the path to the Supreme Court = = = 
 On June 24 , 1885 , three months after the Major Crimes Act was passed , Kagama and his son Mahawaha went to Iyouse 's house , where an argument ensued that resulted in the stabbing death of Iyouse . Mahawaha reportedly held Iyouse 's wife while Kagama stabbed Iyouse . Agent Porter moved quickly to detain both Kagama and Mahawaha on murder charges . He informed both federal and state authorities . The local district attorney declined to prosecute , citing a policy of not prosecuting crimes between Indians . The U.S. Attorney for Northern California forcefully prosecuted the case . On October 18 , 1885 , both Kagama and Mahawaha were taken to San Francisco for trial , after having been indicted for murder . The indictment charged that the crime occurred on the reservation , even though it was later determined at the trial to have occurred outside of the reservation boundaries to the north . 
 Because the crime supposedly occurred on the Hoopa Valley Reservation , the U.S. Attorney and the Bureau of Indian Affairs ( BIA ) fully supported the jurisdictional shift to the federal government and were immediately prepared to prosecute the case in federal courts . Challenges to the subject matter jurisdiction were heard before the circuit court in early October 1885 . Circuit Judge Lorenzo Sawyer and District Court Judge George Sabin heard the challenge but disagreed on the law . The case received a " certificate of division " resulting in the case being forwarded to the Supreme Court later in October . 
 Since this case challenged the authority of the federal courts to try Indian @-@ on @-@ Indian crime , this case was heard as an interlocutory appeal , meaning that the Supreme Court would have to decide the constitutionality of the claimed jurisdiction before Kagama could be tried for the killing of Iyouse in federal court . 
 = = Supreme Court = = 
 = = = Arguments = = = 
 Kagama was represented by 27 @-@ year @-@ old Joseph D. Redding . The United States was represented by George A. Jenks , who was an Assistant United States Secretary of the Interior . Arguments were heard before the Supreme Court on May 2 , 1886 , only five months after the circuit court delivered a split opinion on the matter of jurisdiction . 
 Jenks urged the court to look to its earlier ruling in Crow Dog , where the Court commented in dicta that Congress possessed the authority to regulate all commerce with Indian tribes , because of the Indian Commerce Clause of the Constitution . In his listing of precedents , he cited numerous laws passed by Congress regulating Indian commerce ; he did not cite any other case law that supported Congress ' authority over internal Indian matters , because there was none . Further , Jenks incorporated aspects of the political debate in Congress when the act was passed citing that the U.S. should be able to enforce its laws within its borders , regardless of treaty rights . The prosecution argued that Congress had the absolute authority to regulate Indians and their affairs . 
 Joseph Redding defended his clients vigorously . His argument was three @-@ fold . First he argued that in one hundred years of Indian policy , Congress had never prosecuted Indian @-@ on @-@ Indian crime . Further , the indictment as stated contained no element of commerce and was therefore outside the purview of Congress to legislate such a law . Finally , he argued that such a profound shift in Indian policy should not be enacted in a law whose heading and body were wholly inconsistent with the intent of the Major Crimes Act . In effect , he argued that such a law governing a people should be debated in full sight of the American public and on its own merits . Redding argued that Congress could not assert power over sovereign people who , when making treaties to cede land , reserved certain rights to themselves . He did not raise the issue that the tribes already did have a system of law that dealt with crimes against another person . 
 = = = Opinion of the Court = = = 
 In a unanimous decision issued at the end of May 1886 , and authored by Justice Samuel Freeman Miller , the Supreme Court ruled that the Major Crimes Act was constitutional , and , therefore , the case was within the jurisdiction of the federal courts . Miller dismissed , however , the argument that the Act was proper under the Indian Commerce Clause , noting that the case did not present a commerce issue . He held instead that it was necessary since Indians were wards of the United States . Justice Miller was well known for writing opinions that supported federal power over state 's rights . This ruling meant that the federal circuit court 's indictment would stand and the case would proceed to trial back in Northern California . 
 The opinion drew heavily on the language of the Solicitor General 's brief , which by today 's standards would be considered by many as racially charged . The language in Miller 's opinion is infamous for its description of Indian tribes as weak , degraded and dependent on the federal government for support . He adopts language from Cherokee Nation v. Georgia describing each tribe as a " ward " and in a state of " pupilage . " 
 Miller , having dismissed the Indian Commerce Clause as a source of authority , did not cite another constitutional source of the power . In effect , this decision contended that the U.S. government had supreme authority to enforce laws within its borders , but did not mention where this power was outlined in the Constitution . From the time the crime occurred to the Supreme Court decision , eleven months had passed .

 = = = Trial of Kagama = = = 
 The trial was held in San Francisco in September 1886 . The prosecution called four witnesses , including Iyouse 's wife and a witness to the murder named " Charlie " . The defense called one witness , John B. Treadwell . Treadwell testified that the murder was outside the boundaries of the reservation . Based on Treadwell 's position within the General Land Office , the judge believed him and ordered a directed verdict of not guilty . 
 Humboldt County Sheriff T. M. Brown stated that he would not arrest Kagama for a crime against another Indian . Brown stated that in his 26 years of law enforcement in the area , the state had never prosecuted an Indian for Indian @-@ on @-@ Indian crime . Brown also said that Kagama was trustworthy and industrious , while the victim was a " treacherous " blackmailer who had already killed several men . The sheriff believed that Kagama did not have any option but to kill the victim . 
 = = = Consequences and criticism of the decision = = = 
 Kagama was the case that articulated Congress ' plenary power over the Native American tribes in the late 19th century . It reaffirmed Congress ' power to pass legislation , including the Dawes Act , that would take away many of the liberties that Native Americans had been able to hold on to up until that point . 19th and early 20th century U.S. lawmakers viewed the American Indians as inferior people who would benefit from being assimilated into the Euro @-@ American culture . The laws that followed the Kagama ruling were attempts to destroy the Native American cultural differences and force these tribes to share the Euro @-@ American culture viewed by these lawmakers to be the superior culture . 
 The decision has been widely criticized by legal scholars . David E. Wilkins noted that if the Indian Commerce Clause or Taxation Clause did not contain the authority , and the tribes had not granted it by treaty or consent , then the Major Crimes Act would be unconstitutional and the Court should have declared it void . Phillip P. <unk> describes the Kagama decision as " a whirlwind of circular reasoning " , with the Court justifying congressional power due to the tribe 's weakness , which it also noted was due to the tribes dealing with the U.S. government . <unk> felt the decision was an embarrassment to constitutional theory , to logic , and to humanity . Robert N. Clinton stated that " [ t ] his remarkable decision obviously invoked rhetoric of colonial expansion , rather than the rhetoric of American constitutional discourse . " Daniel L. <unk> said that Kagama was " one more item on the long litany of injustices to the American Indian . " In addition to the law professors , various other authors in law reviews have also been critical of the decision . Warren Stapleton , in the Arizona State University law journal , has stated that the decision was incorrect and that the Major Crimes Act is in fact unconstitutional . In a Comment , the University of Pennsylvania Law Review noted that " the Court promulgated what can be called the ' it @-@ must @-@ be @-@ somewhere ' doctrine ... " 
 Kagama remains good law , being cited in support of the plenary power doctrine as recently as 2004 in United States v. Lara by the Supreme Court , and cited in 2015 by the 6th Circuit . Although one legal scholar , Matthew L.M. Fletcher , states that the apex of the doctrine was reached in 1955 , in Tee @-@ Hit @-@ Ton Indians v. United States , he also acknowledges that the doctrine is still current law . In 2010 , Pawnee lawyer Walter Echo @-@ Hawk wrote in his book , In the Courts of the Conqueror , that Kagama has been used : 
 " [ T ] o justify excessive government intrusion into the internal affairs of Indian tribes and to exercise unwarranted control over the lives and property of American Indians in a slide towards despotism ... [ T ] he creation of frightening , state @-@ run , Orwellian societies on Indian reservations was perfectly legal in the courts of the conqueror , because it was done in the name of guardianship . " 
 = Hector @-@ class ironclad = 
 The Hector @-@ class ironclads were a pair of armoured frigates built for the Royal Navy ( RN ) in the 1860s . Hector was completed in 1864 and assigned to the Channel Fleet until she began a refit in 1867 . Valiant 's builder went bankrupt and delayed her launching by a year . The ship then had to wait almost another five years to receive her guns and be commissioned . Both ships were assigned to the Reserve Fleet from 1868 until they were paid off in 1885 – 86 . They were mobilized during the Russo @-@ Turkish War of 1877 – 78 , but saw no action . They were hulked in the late 1890s and assigned to shore establishments . Hector was scrapped in 1905 , but Valiant was converted into a floating oil tank in 1926 until she was sold for scrap in 1956 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The Hector @-@ class ironclads , like their immediate predecessors , the Defence class , were designed as smaller and cheaper versions of the Warrior @-@ class armoured frigates . They were modified versions of the Defence class with additional armour and more powerful engines . 
 The ships were 280 feet 2 inches ( 85 @.@ 4 m ) long between perpendiculars , had a beam of 56 feet 5 inches ( 17 @.@ 2 m ) and a draft of 26 feet 2 inches ( 8 @.@ 0 m ) . They were 300 long tons ( 300 t ) overweight and displaced 7 @,@ 000 long tons ( 7 @,@ 100 t ) . The hull was subdivided by watertight transverse bulkheads into 92 compartments and had a double bottom underneath the engine and boiler rooms . The ships were designed with a very low centre of gravity and had a metacentric height of 4 feet 6 inches ( 1 @.@ 4 m ) . While handy in manoeuvring they rolled quite badly . The ships had a crew of 530 officers and enlisted men . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Each of the Hector @-@ class ships had one 2 @-@ cylinder horizontal return connecting @-@ rod steam engine driving a single 18 @-@ foot ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) propeller . Six boilers provided steam to the engine at a working pressure of 22 – 25 psi ( 152 – 172 kPa ; 2 – 2 kgf / cm2 ) . The engine produced a total of 3 @,@ 256 – 3 @,@ 560 indicated horsepower ( 2 @,@ 428 – 2 @,@ 655 kW ) . During her sea trials on 23 February 1864 , Hector had a maximum speed of 12 @.@ 36 knots ( 22 @.@ 89 km / h ; 14 @.@ 22 mph ) and Valiant made 12 @.@ 65 knots ( 23 @.@ 43 km / h ; 14 @.@ 56 mph ) on 18 September 1865 . The ships carried only 450 long tons ( 460 t ) of coal because they were overweight , enough to steam 800 nautical miles ( 1 @,@ 500 km ; 920 mi ) at full speed . 
 The armoured frigates were barque @-@ rigged and had a sail area of 24 @,@ 500 square feet ( 2 @,@ 276 m2 ) . Their funnel was semi @-@ retractable to reduce wind resistance while under sail alone . They was designed to allow their propeller to be hoisted up into the stern of the ship to reduce drag while under sail , but the hoisting gear was never fitted on either ship . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The armament of the Hector @-@ class ships was intended to be 32 smoothbore , muzzle @-@ loading 68 @-@ pounder guns , 15 on each side on the main deck and one each fore and aft as chase guns on the upper deck . This was modified during Hector 's construction to four rifled 110 @-@ pounder breech @-@ loading guns mounted on the upper deck and twenty @-@ four 68 @-@ pounders on the broadside . Valiant , due to the delays in her construction and a shortage of guns , never received any of these guns . The breech @-@ loading guns were a new design from Armstrong and much was hoped for them . To partially alleviate their overweight condition the ships were not fully armed and only received four 110 @-@ pounders on the upper deck and twenty 68 @-@ pounders on the main deck behind armour . Firing tests carried out in September 1861 against an armoured target , however , proved that the 110 @-@ pounder was inferior to the 68 @-@ pounder smoothbore gun in armour penetration and repeated incidents of breech explosions during the Battles for Shimonoseki and the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863 – 64 caused the navy to withdraw the gun from service shortly afterwards . 
 The 7 @.@ 9 @-@ inch ( 201 mm ) solid shot of the 68 @-@ pounder gun weighed approximately 68 pounds ( 30 @.@ 8 kg ) while the gun itself weighed 10 @,@ 640 pounds ( 4 @,@ 826 @.@ 2 kg ) . The gun had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 579 ft / s ( 481 m / s ) and had a range of 3 @,@ 200 yards ( 2 @,@ 900 m ) at an elevation of 12 ° . The 7 @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) shell of the 110 @-@ pounder Armstrong breech @-@ loader weighed 107 – 110 pounds ( 48 @.@ 5 – 49 @.@ 9 kg ) . It had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 150 ft / s ( 350 m / s ) and , at an elevation of 11 @.@ 25 ° , a maximum range of 4 @,@ 000 yards ( 3 @,@ 700 m ) . The 110 @-@ pounder gun weighed 9 @,@ 520 pounds ( 4 @,@ 318 @.@ 2 kg ) . All of the guns could fire both solid shot and explosive shells . 
 Hector was rearmed during her 1867 – 68 refit with sixteen 7 @-@ inch and two 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) rifled muzzle @-@ loading guns . Valiant received these guns as her initial armament . The two 8 @-@ inch guns were mounted on the quarterdeck where they could be fought in all weathers and four 7 @-@ inch guns were also fitted on the upper deck . The remaining twelve 7 @-@ inch guns were carried on the main deck . The shell of the 15 @-@ calibre 8 @-@ inch gun weighed 175 pounds ( 79 @.@ 4 kg ) while the gun itself weighed 9 long tons ( 9 @.@ 1 t ) . It had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 410 ft / s ( 430 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate 9 @.@ 6 inches ( 244 mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle . The 16 @-@ calibre 7 @-@ inch gun weighed 6 @.@ 5 long tons ( 6 @.@ 6 t ) and fired a 112 pounds ( 50 @.@ 8 kg ) shell . It was credited with the nominal ability to penetrate 7 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 196 mm ) armour .

 The Hector @-@ class ships had a wrought iron waterline armour belt , 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 114 mm ) thick , that covered 216 feet ( 65 @.@ 8 m ) amidships and left the bow and stern unprotected . To protect against raking fire the belt was closed off by 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch transverse bulkheads at each end at lower deck level . The armour extended to 5 feet 8 inches ( 1 @.@ 7 m ) below the waterline . The main deck was protected by a strake of armour that ran the full length of the ship .

 Whilst Valiant was under construction , Westwood , Baillie went bankrupt in November 1861 and their shipyard was taken over by the Thames Ironworks . This delayed her launching by about a year and a shortage of muzzle @-@ loading guns delayed her completion by nearly five years . Hector , in contrast , served with the Channel Fleet from commissioning until 1867 , when she was paid off to be re @-@ armed and to refit . She formed part of the Southern Reserve Fleet between 1868 until 1886 much like Valiant 's service as the First Reserve guard ship in Southern Ireland after her commissioning , where she remained until 1885 . Both ships did little of significance until they were assigned to the Particular Service Squadron , commanded by Admiral Geoffrey Hornby , from June to August 1878 during the Russian war scare during the Russo @-@ Turkish War . 
 Hector was assigned as Queen Victoria 's guard ship nearly every summer during this period when the Queen and her family , were in residence in Osborne House on the Isle of Wight . She was paid off at Portsmouth in 1886 and remained there until 1900 when she briefly became part of the HMS Vernon torpedo school as a store hulk . Hector became the first British warship to have wireless telegraphy installed when she conducted the first trials of the new equipment for the Royal Navy . 
 Valiant was paid off in 1885 , and she was assigned to the HMS Indus stoker training establishment in 1897 , briefly losing her name , before being renamed as Indus IV in 1904 . The ship was converted to a kite balloon storeship in 1915 , during World War I , and her name was changed to HMS Valiant III . She was offered for sale in 1922 , but there were no takers so the ship was converted into a floating oil tank in 1926 and towed to Hamoaze . 
 = Student Hidjo = 
 Student Hidjo ( Perfected spelling Student Hijo , both meaning Student Green ) is a 1918 novel by Marco Kartodikromo . Originally published as a serial in Sinar Hindia , it was republished in book form in 1919 by <unk> & <unk> . 
 Written while Kartodikromo was in prison , Student Hidjo tells the story of Hidjo , a Javanese student sent to the Netherlands to study but eventually falls for a Dutchwoman . An intersecting plotline , which unfolds parallel to the main story , follows Dutch administrator Willem Walter in his romantic life . Written in Malay , the novel was one of several by Javanese authors which helped popularise the word " saya " as a first @-@ person personal pronoun . 
 Described by Kartodikromo as an extended simile , Student Hidjo has been noted as depicting a new Indonesian youth culture which has adopted Western cultural and lingual facets . Traditional Javanese and Dutch cultural values are contrasted ; from this contrast , Kartodikromo advocates a view that the two are incompatible . This includes love , which is described in the novel as something only those with a Dutch education would attempt to find ; the traditional view being that marriage is to be used for social mobility . 
 = = Background = = 
 Student Hidjo was written by Marco Kartodikromo , a journalist from Blora who began his career in Bandung and was strongly opposed to the policies of the Dutch East Indies government . For several years he worked as an editor at the Surakarta @-@ based newspaper Doenia Bergerak ; the city later served as the novel 's setting . He spent five months in the Netherlands , from late 1916 to early 1917 ; upon his return , he was arrested by the Dutch governmental authorities for " sowing hatred " and sentenced to a year in prison in <unk> , Batavia ( now <unk> Besar , Jakarta ) . It was while in prison that Kartodikromo wrote Student Hidjo . 
 In the early 20th century , the introduction of Western technology and culture was leading to the fragmentation of the traditional Javanese lifestyle . Meanwhile , the Dutch Ethical Policy , which guaranteed certain rights and freedoms – such as the right to education and some press freedoms – was leading to social unrest . The tighter controls put on the press after 1906 led to Student Hidjo being published with the text " not to be quoted " ( " tak <unk> <unk> " ) on the cover . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Hidjo is a young man from Surakarta , Central Java , who is engaged to Biroe , in accordance with his father 's wishes . His father , a merchant named Raden <unk> , orders Hidjo to go to the Netherlands and attend university ; this is hoped to give the family greater status , as generally only priyayi ( noble ) families send their children abroad for schooling . Meanwhile , Dutch administrator Willem Walter , who views the Javanese positively , is engaged to a Dutch woman named Jet Roos ; Roos is pregnant with his child . 
 In the Netherlands , Hidjo stays with a local family and enjoys the beauty of the Netherlands . The family 's daughter , Betje , finds him intriguing because of his ethnicity . Although Hidjo initially receives her coldly , the two later become romantically and sexually involved . In Surakarta , Walter becomes attracted to Biroe and breaks off his engagement with Roos , who in turn aborts their child . This , and Biroe 's rejection , leads him to return to the Netherlands , where he and Hidjo meet . 
 Hidjo , who has become increasingly distracted from his studies by his relationship with Betje , is recalled to the Indies by his family . He ends his relationship with the Dutchwoman , paying her his savings to make amends for doing so . When Hidjo returns to Surakarta , he marries Woengoe – who originates from a higher @-@ class family than Biroe . Two years later , Hidjo has become district attorney of <unk> . Meanwhile , Walter has married Betje and returned to Surakarta to become assistant resident . Biroe marries Woengoe 's brother <unk> , who has become regent of the area . Roos marries the area 's administrator , <unk> . 
 = = Style = = 
 Student Hidjo was written in Malay . When the novel was written , and indeed for numerous years afterwards , the Dutch colonial government was attempting to standardise Malay ; the standardised form has been described by Hendrik Maier , a lecturer at Leiden University , as stilted . However , Kartodikromo did not attempt to follow these standards . According to Meier , unlike writers who used standardised Malay such as Armijn Pane and Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah in a " sad " manner , the language in Student Hidjo showed only " the enjoyment , the excitement , the thrill " of the writer , who " bubbled with anger " . 
 Tsuyoshi Kato , a Japanese scholar of Indonesian literature , notes that Kartodikromo , like other Javanese authors , preferred to use the term " saya " when writing in the first @-@ person , as opposed to Minangkabau writers who preferred " hamba " . He writes that " saya " was preferred over a Javanese word due to first person pronouns having highly different levels of politeness in that language . He writes that through works such as Student Hidjo and Rasa Merdika ( A Sense of Freedom ; 1924 ; by <unk> ) , Javanese writers popularised the term ; he describes " saya " as more active than " hamba " but more " contemplative and self @-@ reflective " than the Javanese <unk> ( crude ) pronoun " aku " . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Maier writes that the names of the main characters imply Student Hidjo should be read allegorically , with the names Hidjo ( green ) , Woengoe ( violet ) , and Biroe ( blue ) showing an interconnection between the characters . Kartodikromo described it as an extended simile . 
 The novel depicts a younger generation of Indonesians ( <unk> <unk> ) as being " those who understand Dutch " . Maier writes that this understanding is not limited to the language used , but also actions ; this includes holding hands in public and drinking lemonade , activities which traditional Indonesian society does not involve . Student Hidjo also contrasts Dutch and Javanese peoples . Maier finds that , through its alternating events , the novel shows that the Dutch and Javanese are incompatible ; <unk> sums it up as " Javanese do not feel at ease in Holland , [ and ] Dutch do not feel at ease in Java . " According to Maier , the novel views the gap between the two cultures as " unbridgeable " . 
 Maier writes that the novel includes themes of love , with Hidjo 's love for Woengoe , Betje , and Biroe paralleling that of Walter 's love for Roos , Woengoe , and Betje . He also notes that there is a theme of social mobility , where Hidjo 's relationships with noble women are fostered by his merchant father to grant the family a greater social position ; bride prices also feature prominently , showing that one can become a noble through marriage if one has enough money . He notes that , towards the end of the novel , love is described as something only those with a Dutch education would attempt to find , as the social @-@ financial meaning of marriage remains predominant among the traditional Javanese . The characters , despite not all marrying for love , are happy with their eventual partners and have a comfortable life .

 Student Hidjo was first published in 1918 as a serial in the Semarang @-@ based daily Sinar Hindia , which Kartodikromo edited . The story was then collected in a book format and published by <unk> & <unk> , a Semarang @-@ based company , in 1919 . When it was published , politically themed works were limited to smaller publishers . Works published by Balai Pustaka , the state @-@ owned publisher of the Dutch East Indies , tended to be apolitical . 
 Kato writes that the novel is " unremarkable in terms of radical activism " , but unrivaled in its imagination when compared to Sitti Nurbaya ( 1922 ; Marah Rusli ) , Salah Asuhan ( Wrong Upbringing ; 1927 ; Abdoel <unk> ) , and Rasa Merdika . 
 = West Coast ( song ) = 
 " West Coast " is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Lana Del Rey for her third studio album , Ultraviolence ( 2014 ) . Written by Del Rey and Rick Nowels , it is a melancholy love song that depicts a woman torn between love and ambition , while also serving as a dedication to the United States ' West Coast . A psychedelic rock , desert rock and surf rock ballad , " West Coast " was noted to be an evolution and more guitar @-@ orientated in sound for Del Rey and was produced by Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys . Described as a two @-@ in @-@ one song , its shifting tempo transitions downward by nearly 60 beats per minute at the chorus , in a rhythmical shift reminiscent of The Beatles ' " We Can Work It Out " ( 1965 ) , introduced by the guitar lick that begins the Beatles ' " And I Love Her " ( 1964 ) . In the song , Del Rey 's vocal comprises a more sensual and demented tone than in her previous discography , and are often sung in an anxious " breathy " style . 
 Released as the lead single from the album on April 14 , 2014 , " West Coast " received positive reviews from music critics who commended its unconventional composition and Del Rey 's uncharacteristic vocal delivery . Several news media sources went on to list it as one of the best songs of 2014 , including Consequence of Sound , NME and Spin . " West Coast " debuted at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 , making this Del Rey 's highest debut and second highest @-@ charting single of her career , while also being her first single to enter the Rock Airplay chart where it reached number 26 . The song marked Del Rey 's eighth top 40 hit on the UK Singles Chart where it peaked at number 21 . 
 An accompanying black @-@ and @-@ white music video , directed by Vincent Haycock , was released on May 7 , 2014 . Shot at Marina del Rey , California and Venice , Los Angeles , it uses a minimalist and melancholy approach to depict Del Rey torn between two love interests , one of which is portrayed by Hollywood tattoo artist Mark Mahoney . The clip was well received by critics and was nominated for a 2014 MTV Video Music Award for Best Cinematography . Del Rey promoted " West Coast " with live performances at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival , Austin City Limits Music Festival and Glastonbury Festival 2014 . The song has also been covered by James Vincent McMorrow , Royal Blood and Max Jury .

 " West Coast " was written by Del Rey and her frequent collaborator Rick Nowels in California , with Del Rey composing its lyrics and melody , and Nowels its chords . In November 2013 , Del Rey traveled to Electric Lady Studios in New York City , which she occupied for five weeks alone , and produced the track by herself from a guitar before later hiring session drummer Maximilian <unk> , while Nowels would come by " every now and then " . Together , they produced the initial recording of " West Coast " as a classic rock @-@ inspired song . Del Rey developed the track as a dedication to the United States ' West Coast , but with the intention of it being more psychological , which resulted in the track becoming distant from that of the verse – chorus form . She felt the song 's slow , shifting tempo was important because it reflected her mental state during its writing . Del Rey initially completed her third studio album Ultraviolence in December 2013 , but at the time was dissatisfied with a demo she had recorded for " West Coast " . She then met Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys by chance at Electric Lady Studios and then again on a night out in Queens , New York , and realized she needed to re @-@ record the track to incorporate his looser production techniques . That night Del Rey explained to Auerbach her interest to develop a song containing jazz undertones , " West Coast fusion " influenced by The Beach Boys and Eagles , and a 1970s Laurel Canyon @-@ type revival . 
 Subsequently , Del Rey traveled to Nashville , Tennessee to re @-@ record " West Coast " and tracks from its parent album with Auerbach in a 3 @-@ week session at his studio , Easy Eye Sound . She invited him to add a more casual , California vibe to the song by recording in single takes , with a blues @-@ like Shure <unk> microphone . According to Auerbach , the recording of " West Coast " was sung " 99 % live " by Del Rey in a room adjacent to one where a seven @-@ piece band were recording the track 's instrumentation . Auerbach produced the song 's electric guitar , shaker , 12 @-@ string acoustic guitar and synthesizer instrumentation . While Nick Movshon was credited as a bassist and drummer on " West Coast " . The track 's strings were recorded separately from the main recording at a studio in Glendale , California called The Bridge . 
 Del Rey opined that the track 's demo sounded very different to Auerbach 's reproduction . When Del Rey first played " West Coast " to her record label , Interscope Records , they were dissatisfied with its chorus being slower in beats per minute than its verses . They responded to the her , stating , " None of these songs are good for radio and now you 're slowing them down when they should be speeded up " . In an interview with The Guardian , Del Rey explained that she felt " murky " with her life during the song 's writing , and it was that feeling which influenced it to sound disconnected from mainstream pop . 
 = = Composition = = 
 A psychedelic rock , soft rock , and surf rock ballad , " West Coast " also contains elements of reggae , indie rock , Latin rock , 1960s music , 1980s " drive time , " and " <unk> " swing . The track 's subversive sound is the result of its comprising jagged instrumentation and laid @-@ back groove , similar to that of Classics IV 's " Spooky " ( 1967 ) . The opening riff solicits a " wavy " sound reminiscent of The Black Keys ' Turn Blue ( 2014 ) , and is continued throughout the rest of the song . Described as a two @-@ in @-@ one track , its shifting tempo transcends downward during the chorus mark , following into a rhythmical shift reminiscent of The Beatles ' " We Can Work It Out " ( 1965 ) , Being more guitar @-@ orientated than the singer 's previous output , it is based around minimal , country @-@ tinged , surf guitar , and " twangy " drum instrumentation . The track 's slower second section opens with a descending blues riff reminiscent of The Beatles ' " And I Love Her " ( 1964 ) , in which the production switches between a half @-@ mumbled baritone and layered choral symphony , among neo @-@ noir motif . Its chorus scythes across juddering bass and off @-@ kilter percussion instrumentation . Towards the end of the track 's duration , a stray burst of G @-@ funk shrill synth is solicited . 
 Incorporating an ease to her vocal delivery , Del Rey eased her vocal delivery by crooning the hook " Move baby , move baby / Ooh baby , ooh baby " throughout the chorus shift , in a style that recalls Stevie Nicks ' " Edge of Seventeen " ( 1982 ) . Del Rey uses an inexpressive , <unk> tone in the song , with her voice being layered into the track 's production by means of reverberation . In addition , her vocals use a more sensual and sinister tone than in her previous discography , and are often sung in an anxious and " breathy " style , and in an octave just above a whisper . She also sings the track 's backing vocals which in part contribute to the song 's ethereal feel , through distant , faraway moans . MuuMuse 's Bradley Stern observed that Del Rey 's voice skipped between " breathy <unk> and slurred , drugged @-@ out ecstasy " . Throughout the song , she restrains her delivery during its verses , but sings in a sweeping , cinematic style in its chorus . 
 " West Coast " was noted to be a cross between the works of bands Portishead and Beach House . It was also highlighted that the track deviated from Del Rey 's formula in Born to Die and Paradise ( 2012 ) , as an evolution of their sound , though without doing so in its entirety . Harriet Gibsone of The Guardian described it as " side @-@ stepping slowly from the Twin Peaks melodrama of Born to Die , " while Tim Jonze of the same publication said the song " ditched the hip @-@ hop trappings of Born to Die " . Its eeriness , omnipresent in previous Del Rey tracks , takes on a full @-@ on psychedelia sound , recalling The Turtles ' " You Showed Me " ( 1969 ) . " West Coast " is set in the simple time signature of 4 / 4 , with a moderately fast tempo of 123 beats per minute in its verses , and a slow tempo of 65 beats per minute in its chorus . It is composed in the key of F ♯ minor , with Del Rey 's vocals spanning the range from F ♯ 2 to C ♯ 5 . The track has basic a chord progression of F ♯ m @-@ F ♯ m @-@ E @-@ D @-@ F ♯ m @-@ E @-@ D in its first verse , and Bm @-@ D @-@ F ♯ m @-@ F ♯ m @-@ C ♯ m @-@ D @-@ D @-@ E in its chorus . 
 A melancholy love song , its lyrics depict a woman torn between love and ambition . " West Coast " also serves as a dedication to Del Rey 's California hometown , and elicits imagery from its titular location . In the song , she sings about leaving a lover for the Californian promise of fame , and emphasizes on a gulf between a sweetly uncomplicated romance and a <unk> dysfunctional relationship . Similarly to her previous works , the lyrics are both specific and vague , and complement the track 's " dreamlike " sonics . " West Coast " sets up a disunity between form and content , and though a love song , its sound is more reminiscent to that of a breakup song . It was also noted that the lyrics depict a vivid picture of teenage summer memories and forgotten romance . Comparing the track 's lyrical content to that of Sonic Youth 's " Superstar " ( 1994 ) , Grantland 's Molly Lambert analyzed : " While Born to Die – era Lana often displayed a preening ' please notice me , Mr. Producer ! ' energy , the Lana of ' West Coast ' sounds like a starlet struggling not to become disaffected with show business after feeling her way through a few too many casting @-@ couch sessions , still hoping that big break might be on the horizon .

On April 10 , 2014 , Del Rey posted the track 's single art on Twitter with the lyric , " Down on the West Coast , they got a sayin ' ... " , as its caption . The same caption was used in a promotional billboard which was put up in Los Angeles the same day . The heavily yellow artwork , which makes use of an Instagram filter camera lens , features Del Rey donning soft makeup while standing on a Californian coastline afront crashing waves . She has a forlorn facial expression in the cover , and is depicted with a subtle frown with her eyes staring straight into the camera . Del Rey sports a beach @-@ inspired look with a wave @-@ like hair style , denim jacket and white shirt .

In a review of Ultraviolence , Mike Diver of Clash said that in the context of the album , " West Coast " took on greater significance by serving as a fulcrum which balances the record into " leaving a better impression than it otherwise might " .

 The accompanying music video for " West Coast " was directed by Vincent Haycock , and shot at Marina del Rey , California and in Venice , Los Angeles , in early April 2014 . Aside from Del Rey , the clip also features Hollywood tattoo artist Mark Mahoney who plays the singer 's love interest in the clip 's chorus segment , and American model Bradley Soileau who plays the same role in another scene . Del Rey described Mahoney as her confidante , lover and procurer in the video . In an interview with Clash , the singer mentioned , " Like the record , [ the music video is ] atmospheric , and you catch a directional vibe , but it 's not that pointed , and it 's hard to tell what is going on " . She attained inspiration for the clip from the Chet Baker documentary Let 's Get Lost ( 1988 ) , and her love of the red dress effect . The singer also wanted the video to be mood @-@ driven , and for its final scene , to transcend from black @-@ and @-@ white imagery to a " HD color dream scene " . 
 Images from the music video first emerged online on April 7 , 2014 . The audio release of " West Coast " on April 14 , 2014 , was accompanied by a looped , black @-@ and @-@ white snippet from the music video of the singer embracing a leather jacket @-@ clad man at the beach .

 = = = Synopsis = = = 
 The black @-@ and @-@ white music video was noted to have predominantly dark , brooding , hazy , mysterious and sun @-@ stroked imagery , and portrays Del Rey evoking her distinguished personality . Using a minimalist and melancholy approach , it features several artistic shots of California scenery and cameo appearances by two men portrayed as bad boy archetypes . Del Rey engages in 1960s apparition , numerous swaying and twirling actions , and sings with her eyes closed throughout the music video . CBS Corporation writer Courtney E. Smith described the clip as " the yin and yang of youthful hope , the kind Hollywood lives by attracting , and cynical industry , the kind Hollywood thrives on but hides " . 
 The video begins with rolling waves and shots of palm tree @-@ lined roads , and gulls . A posse of skateboarders are also pictured in this scene . At first , the clip appears to function in small , romantic gestures , reminiscent to that of a fashion magazine advertisement . The singer is pictured in two visually different love affairs . In the first , Del Rey is shown clinging to a younger , long @-@ haired blond , leather @-@ clad man on a beach , where she <unk> flits around the Pacific Ocean <unk> , and splashes in its waves with him . At the 1 : 20 mark , the song and its visuals simultaneously switch up , with the singer being pictured donning diamond jewelry , sitting alongside a more mature and <unk> @-@ type man who wears sunglasses , as a chauffeured convertible barrels forward in slow motion . Del Rey 's love interest in this segment recalls age disparity in sexual relationships , producer Robert Evans , and Scott Weiland . In another scene , the two are depicted nuzzling and smoking in the back seat of the car .

 A plot twist then occurs towards the clip 's ending with the use of fire and <unk> imagery , where Del Rey gently brushes her hair off her shoulders in the middle of superimposed flames .

The final scene was noted to symbolize the song 's lyric , " fire in the sands of love " .

 The music video for " West Coast " was noted to share several similarities with Del Rey 's previous videography . Its black @-@ and @-@ white , old @-@ school imagery recall her video for " Blue Jeans " and the introduction to " National Anthem " . While the home @-@ recorded footage scenes were a technique previously used in " Video Games " and " Summertime Sadness " , and its tattooed hand close @-@ ups recall those of " National Anthem " . One of Del Rey 's love interests in the clip , Soileau , previously appeared in the same role in " Blue Jeans " and " Born to Die " , while another shares appearance similarities to her love interest in " Ride " . Del Rey 's characteristic cat eye @-@ make up and swaying actions were also highlighted . Speculation arose that her mature love interest in the visual was inspired by the " old man " character she sung of in " Off to the Races " and her then @-@ fiancé , Barrie @-@ James O 'Neill . The clip also garnered comparisons to dark comedy film Weekend at Bernie 's ( 1989 ) , Pearl Jam 's clip for " Jeremy " ( 1992 ) , and Chris Isaak 's music video for " Wicked Game " ( 1990 ) . 
 The visual was well received by music critics and was nominated for a 2014 MTV Video Music Award for Best Cinematography , but lost to Beyoncé 's music video " Pretty Hurts " . Chad Saville of the Greenspun Media Group called the clip a " mysterious , yet artful celebration of all things California " . Opining that the music video was " Lana Being Lana , " Billboard journalist Jason Lipshutz commented : " Will she burn her past and head towards the west coast in search of stardom ? In many respects , she 's already there . " Lipshutz 's view was echoed by John Boone of E ! who deemed " West Coast " Del Rey 's " most Lana Del Rey @-@ y video yet " and noted that it contained " the most glamorous smoking you 've ever seen " . Refinery29 's Hayden Manders said the clip contained the three elements of a " perfect Del Rey video " ; " cigarettes , a tragic Hollywood starlet and Bradley Soileau " . Manders went on to write that " West Coast " contained " enough melancholy to give ' Summertime Sadness ' a run for its moody money " . Rolling Stone writer Killian Young felt that the clip evoked the style of old @-@ fashioned Hollywood film noir . While HitFix 's Melinda Newman felt the visual was a " time @-@ told tale in Hollywood , " but " so well @-@ realized , [ ... ] It could play out in Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice fashion " . 
 Writing for Slant Magazine , Alexa Camp said the music video faithfully mirrored the song 's lyrics and was understated by Del Rey 's usual standards . Darwin who opined that the clip recalled Del Rey 's short film <unk> ( 2013 ) , deemed it " a total cinematic gem , " and " a gorgeous mashup of retro glamour and modern independence " . The visual was also lauded by Complex writer Lauren Nostro who called it a " stunning , cinematic " and " beautiful " video , and Anna <unk> of Glamour who deemed it " summer @-@ perfect " . <unk> 's Bradley Bershad described the clip as " a slightly bizarre , very dramatic trip through time and space " and said its noir influences matched the track well , adding that its " old school meets new school " feel continued the musical persona Del Rey had crafted for herself . Bershad 's view was shared by Smith who wrote , " It pretty well marries together her continuing play with female sexuality , Hollywood stereotypes and insistence that she is her own creation " . While DeGroot commended the video 's black @-@ and @-@ white photography and flame imagery which he opined were less pretentious than that of " Jeremy " , which " West Coast " was compared to . Matthew Bramlett of TheWrap opined that Del Rey " perfectly encapsulates her ' vintage California rich kid ' look " in the video and described the clip as " very chic , with just a twinge of the old Hollywood flair " the singer had embraced in her previous visuals . In a mixed review , Patrick D. McDermott of The Fader called the visual " classic , kind of sad [ Del Rey ] in romantic black and white " , but felt it was confusing and " on @-@ brand ... a meticulous homage to nothing in particular " . While Nelson wrote that the clip failed to enhance the song , but was understated enough not to detract from the music .

 = Pusher ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " Pusher " is the seventeenth episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It originally aired on the Fox network on February 23 , 1996 , and was written by Vince Gilligan and directed by Rob Bowman . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology , or overarching fictional history of The X @-@ Files . " Pusher " earned a Nielsen household rating of 10 @.@ 8 , being watched by 16 @.@ 2 million viewers in its initial broadcast . " Pusher " received overwhelmingly positive reviews from television critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . In this episode , Mulder and Scully ’ s assistance is requested for a case involving a man , who goes by the pseudonym " Pusher " , seemingly capable of bending people to his will . The suspect uses his mysterious abilities to manipulate Mulder into a dangerous end game . 
 " Pusher " was crafted by Gilligan with the intention to feature a tense cat and mouse game between Mulder and Pusher . The final scene , featuring a game of Russian roulette , was met with some resistance from the network . The standards and practices department argued that , because the game had never been featured on a television series before , it was unsuitable for broadcast . Several actors were considered for the role of Modell , even Lance Henriksen , who went on to play the lead role in Millennium , but Robert Wisden eventually won the role . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Robert Patrick Modell ( Robert Wisden ) walks through a supermarket , buying a large supply of energy drinks . Before he can leave , Modell is surrounded and arrested by FBI agents led by Frank Burst ( Vic Polizos ) . While being escorted away in a police car , he repeatedly talks about the color cerulean blue . Modell 's talking seemingly causes the driver to not see an approaching big rig of that color , causing a collision . Modell escapes after the driver unlocks his handcuffs before dying . 
 Burst , the only surviving agent of the crash , tells Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) about his pursuit of Modell — nicknamed " Pusher " — who has committed a series of contract killings over the past two years , making the acts appear to be suicide . Mulder spots the word " ronin " written at the crime scene , and tracks down Modell 's classified ad in a mercenary magazine . Mulder believes that Modell has the psychic ability to " push " people to do his will . Using the phone number in the ad , the agents track down Modell to a golf course in Falls Church , Virginia , where he makes a SWAT lieutenant douse himself in gasoline and light himself on fire . Mulder finds Modell exhausted in a car nearby , arresting him . 
 During his arraignment , Modell uses his skills to make the judge let him go . The agents look into Modell 's past and find that he failed to enter the FBI after a psychological examination deemed him to be grossly egocentric and sociopathic . Meanwhile , after writing the word " pass " on a piece of paper and putting it in his shirt pocket , Modell is able to pass security and enter FBI headquarters . He " pushes " an agent , Holly ( Julia Arkos ) , into pulling up Mulder 's file for him . When Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) intervenes , Modell convinces Holly that he was a man who mugged her , causing her to spray Skinner with mace and beat him . Scully is unable to explain how Modell has his power , but now agrees with Mulder 's theory that he can push people into doing whatever he wants . 
 Agents raid Modell 's apartment , but find it empty . They find cans of protein drinks in the refrigerator and medicine for epilepsy . Mulder suspects that a brain tumor has given Modell his psychokinetic ability , but that using his power is physically exhausting , forcing him to constantly consume the energy drinks . Mulder believes that he is dying and wants to go out in a blaze of glory . Modell makes a taunting phone call to Agent Burst and causes him to have a fatal heart attack while they try to trace him . The agents track Modell down to a hospital , where he has compelled a guard to shoot an MRI technician and kill himself . Mulder ventures inside the hospital and is captured by Modell . 
 Scully finds the two sitting at a table with the dead guard 's revolver . Modell forces Mulder to play Russian roulette with him . Despite Scully 's pleading , Mulder pulls the trigger first at Modell and then himself , the hammer falling on an empty chamber both times . Modell then makes him aim the gun at Scully . At the last instant , Scully sees a fire alarm in a mirror and pulls it in desperation , breaking Modell 's concentration . Mulder instantly switches his aim to Modell and pulls the trigger ; the bullet is fired and Modell is severely wounded . 
 Later , Mulder and Scully visit Modell in the hospital , where he is lying in a coma that Scully predicts he will not awaken from before his brain tumor kills him . Mulder surprises her by revealing that Modell 's brain tumor was operable at all times , but he refused to have it removed , even as his health deteriorated . Scully asks why , and Mulder repeats her earlier assessment of Modell : that he was always a " little man " , and his psychic ability made him feel big .

 " Pusher " was written by Vince Gilligan and directed by Rob Bowman . Gilligan crafted the episode with the intention to feature a tense cat and mouse game between Mulder and Modell . He later explained , " the only conscious thing I wanted to do from the start was get them together as much as I could " . When Gilligan turned in his script , he told series creator Chris Carter that the episode was " the best work I 'm ever gonna [ sic ] do for you . " Carter retorted that the writers for the show should always " better yourself " by trying to out @-@ do their last scripting effort . The character of Modell would later return in the fifth season episode " Kitsunegari " . 
 The final scene , featuring a Russian roulette game , was met with resistance from the network . The standards and practices department argued that , because the game had never been featured in a television series before , it was unsuitable for broadcast . Furthermore , they argued that the scene could be harmful to impressionable young children . After tense negotiations , the scene was included in the episode largely uncut ; Gilligan later noted that he could not " believe we got away with it " . 
 The episode contains several inside jokes and references to previously established canon in The X @-@ Files universe . The Flukeman , from the episode " The Host " , appears on a tabloid in the opening scene . When Mulder is being fitted for a camera , the script originally had him ask if it received the Discovery Channel . Duchovny , knowing that his character had an interest in pornography , changed the line to " the Playboy Channel " . Several members of the show 's cast and crew make appearances on the various magazine featured in the episode . The tabloid that featured the Flukeman also had a small image of props master Ken Hawryliw and the American Ronin magazine that Mulder flips through contained a " blink @-@ and @-@ you 'll miss @-@ it " shot of production assistant Danielle Faith .

 Several actors were considered for the role of Robert Modell , even Lance Henriksen , who went on to play the lead role in Millennium . Initially , Gilligan considered Harvey Fierstein for the role of Modell , but Robert Wisden read the script and " blew us away " . Rob Bowman was pleased with Wisden 's performance and said , " I thought Robert Wisden was great as Pusher . He is a very energized kind of confident actor with lots of ideas of his own . It took me about a day and a half to get him into it , and then I never had to speak to him again , because he had that look in his eyes . I would walk up to talk to him about the scene and I could see that he was already there . 
 Mitch Pileggi was disappointed in the fact that the episode featured his character , Walter Skinner , getting beat up , something which had occurred in multiple episodes already by this point : " I was feeling a little uncomfortable with him getting his ass kicked so much , and I think the fans were , too . " Dave Grohl , the lead singer and guitarist of the Foo Fighters and former drummer for Nirvana , made a small cameo , along with his then @-@ wife Jennifer Youngblood , in the episode during the scene wherein Modell sneaks into the FBI building . Grohl , who has an active interest in UFO lore , called the episode " his acting debut " .

 Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , wrote that the episode helps to illustrate the idea that " evil [ is ] a mundane and human and somewhat pathetic thing " , a conceit that they note is rooted in many third season episodes of The X @-@ Files . The two reason that , despite Modell 's ability , he is ultimately , " something of a loser " who wishes to " be special " rather than be cured of his brain disease . Furthermore , they argue that Modell 's boasting of being a samurai " is just a fantasy " that he plays up ; he really is a " little man " who yearns " to be big " .

 " Pusher " premiered on the Fox network in the United States on February 23 , 1996 . The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 10 @.@ 8 , with an 18 share , meaning that roughly 10 @.@ 8 percent of all television @-@ equipped households , and 18 percent of households watching television , were tuned in to the episode . The episode was watched by a total of 16 @.@ 2 million viewers . 
 " Pusher " received overwhelmingly positive reviews from television critics . Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave it an A – , describing it as " smart , well @-@ paced , and exciting , and Modell is memorable for being a very human monster who manages to be both well @-@ drawn and unsympathetic " . Though he praised Modell and the climax , he felt that Holly was a stereotype and " the implication that Modell is able to get through to her because of her fear walks that weird line between plausible and not entirely necessary " . Handlen also felt that it was " an excellent starting point " for someone who wanted to get into the series . Entertainment Weekly gave " Pusher " a B + , writing , " Much inscrutable warmth between Mulder and Scully parallels some inscrutable detective work . But the climactic mental tug @-@ of @-@ war between Mulder and Pusher makes up for any lapses in logic " . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson gave the episode a glowing review and rated it five stars out of five . The two called Gilligan 's script " witty and clever " and noted that it was " a triumph " . Furthermore , Shearman and Pearson praised Wisden 's performance as Robert Modell , calling his portrayal " spot on " . Paula Vitaris of Cinefantastique gave the episode a positive review and awarded it a rare four stars out of four . She called it an " intense nail biter " that " ranks with the best of The X @-@ Files " . 
 Since its airing , many reviewers list the episode as one of the best episodes of The X @-@ Files . IGN named it the third best standalone episode of The X @-@ Files , writing " [ t ] hough the episode is loaded with memorable scenes of terror [ ... ] it 's the emotional bond between our two leads that really resonates . " Den of Geek listed " Pusher " as their seventh best episode of the series , and called it " a good game of cat and mouse " . Tom Kessenich , in his book Examination : An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6 – 9 of the X @-@ Files , named the episode the third best episode of The X @-@ Files and called it the " best MOTW [ " monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week " ] in the series history " . Xposé magazine named the Russian roulette scene one of the " 20 Coolest Moments in The X @-@ Files " , ranking it at number eight ; the magazine called the sequence " completely gripping " . 
 = Post @-@ Britpop = 
 Post @-@ Britpop is a subgenre of British alternative rock , made up of bands that emerged from the late 1990s and early 2000s in the aftermath of Britpop , influenced by acts like Pulp , Oasis and Blur , but with less overtly British concerns in their lyrics and making more use of American rock and indie influences , as well as experimental music . Post @-@ Britpop bands that had been established acts , but gained greater prominence after the decline of Britpop , such as Radiohead and The Verve , and new acts such as Travis , Stereophonics , Feeder and particularly Coldplay , achieved much wider international success than most of the Britpop groups that had preceded them , and were some of the most commercially successful acts of the late 1990s and early 2000s .

 Many post @-@ Britpop bands avoided the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it . The music of most bands was guitar based , often mixing elements of British traditional rock ( or British trad rock ) , particularly the Beatles , Rolling Stones and Small Faces with American influences . Post @-@ Britpop bands also utilized specific elements from 1970s British rock and pop music . Drawn from across the United Kingdom , the themes of their music tended to be less parochially centred on British , English and London life , and more introspective than had been the case with Britpop at its height . This , beside a greater willingness to woo the American press and fans , may have helped a number of them in achieving international success . They have been seen as presenting the image of the rock star as an ordinary person , or " boy @-@ next @-@ door " and their increasingly melodic music was criticised for being bland or derivative .

 From about 1997 , as dissatisfaction grew with the concept of Cool Britannia and Britpop as a movement began to dissolve , emerging bands began to avoid the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it . Bands that had enjoyed some success during the mid @-@ 1990s , but were not really part of the Britpop scene , included The Verve and Radiohead . After the decline of Britpop they began to gain more critical and popular attention . The Verve 's album Urban Hymns ( 1997 ) was a worldwide hit and their commercial peak before they broke up in 1999 , while Radiohead achieved critical acclaim with their experimental third album OK Computer ( 1997 ) , and its follow @-@ ups Kid A ( 2000 ) and Amnesiac ( 2001 ) .

 The cultural and musical scene in Scotland , dubbed " Cool Caledonia " by some elements of the press , produced a number of successful alternative acts , including The <unk> from Glasgow , whose re @-@ released single " Smile " ( 1997 ) reached number 25 in the UK charts , and whose album It Doesn 't Matter Anymore ( 1997 ) entered the top ten , but who failed to sustain their success or achieve the anticipated international breakthrough . Travis , also from Glasgow , were one of the first major rock bands to emerge in the post @-@ Britpop era . Utilising the hooks and guitar rock favoured by Oasis in a song @-@ based format , they moved from the personal on Good Feeling ( 1997 ) , through the general on their breakthrough The Man Who ( 1999 ) , to the socially conscious and political on 12 Memories ( 2003 ) and have been credited with a major role in disseminating and even creating the subgenre of post @-@ Britpop . From Edinburgh Idlewild , more influenced by post @-@ grunge , just failed to break into the British top 50 with their second album Hope Is Important ( 1998 ) , but subsequently produced 3 top 20 albums , peaking with The Remote Part ( 2002 ) , and the single " You Held the World in Your Arms " , which both reached number 9 in the respective UK charts . Although garnering some international attention , they did not break through in the US . 
 The first major band to breakthrough from the post @-@ Britpop Welsh rock scene , dubbed " Cool Cymru " , were Catatonia , whose single " Mulder and Scully " ( 1998 ) reached the top ten in the UK , and whose album International Velvet ( 1998 ) reached number one , but they were unable to make much impact in the US and , after personal problems , broke up at the end of the century . Stereophonics , also from Wales , utilised elements of a post @-@ grunge and hardcore on their breakthrough album Performance and Cocktails ( 1999 ) , before moving into more melodic territory with Just Enough Education to Perform ( 2001 ) and subsequent albums . Also from Wales were Feeder , who were initially more influenced by American post @-@ grunge , producing a hard rock sound that led to their breakthrough single " Buck Rogers " and the album Echo Park ( 2001 ) . After the death of their drummer Jon Lee , they moved to a more reflective and introspective mode on Comfort in Sound ( 2002 ) , their most commercially successful album to that point , which spawned a series of hit singles .

 Bands like Coldplay , Starsailor and Elbow , with introspective lyrics and even tempos , began to be criticised at the beginning of the new millennium as bland and sterile and the wave of garage rock or post punk revival bands , like The Hives , The Vines , The Strokes , and The White Stripes , that sprang up in that period were welcomed by the musical press as " the saviours of rock and roll " . However , a number of the bands of this era , particularly Travis , Stereophonics and Coldplay , continued to record and enjoy commercial success into the new millennium . The idea of post @-@ Britpop has been extended to include bands originating in the new millennium , including Razorlight , Kaiser Chiefs , Arctic Monkeys and Bloc Party , seen as a " second wave " of Britpop " .

 = Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide = 
 Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD ) is a coenzyme found in all living cells . The compound is a dinucleotide , because it consists of two nucleotides joined through their phosphate groups . One nucleotide contains an adenine base and the other nicotinamide . Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two forms , an oxidized and reduced form abbreviated as NAD + and NADH respectively . 
 In metabolism , nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is involved in redox reactions , carrying electrons from one reaction to another . The coenzyme is , therefore , found in two forms in cells : NAD + is an oxidizing agent – it accepts electrons from other molecules and becomes reduced . This reaction forms NADH , which can then be used as a reducing agent to donate electrons . These electron transfer reactions are the main function of NAD . However , it is also used in other cellular processes , the most notable one being a substrate of enzymes that add or remove chemical groups from proteins , in posttranslational modifications . Because of the importance of these functions , the enzymes involved in NAD metabolism are targets for drug discovery . 
 In organisms , NAD can be synthesized from simple building @-@ blocks ( de novo ) from the amino acids tryptophan or aspartic acid . In an alternative fashion , more complex components of the coenzymes are taken up from food as the vitamin called niacin . Similar compounds are released by reactions that break down the structure of NAD . These preformed components then pass through a salvage pathway that recycles them back into the active form . Some NAD is also converted into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADP ) ; the chemistry of this related coenzyme is similar to that of NAD , but it has different roles in metabolism . 
 Although NAD + is written with a superscript plus sign because of the formal charge on a particular nitrogen atom , at physiological pH for the most part it is actually a singly charged anion ( charge of minus 1 ) , while NADH is a doubly charged anion . 
 = = Physical and chemical properties = = 
 Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide , like all <unk> , consists of two nucleosides joined by a pair of bridging phosphate groups . The nucleosides each contain a ribose ring , one with adenine attached to the first carbon atom ( the 1 ' position ) and the other with nicotinamide at this position . The nicotinamide moiety can be attached in two orientations to this <unk> carbon atom . Because of these two possible structures , the compound exists as two diastereomers . It is the β @-@ nicotinamide <unk> of NAD + that is found in organisms . These nucleotides are joined together by a bridge of two phosphate groups through the 5 ' carbons . 
 In metabolism , the compound accepts or donates electrons in redox reactions . Such reactions ( summarized in formula below ) involve the removal of two hydrogen atoms from the reactant ( R ) , in the form of a hydride ion ( H − ) , and a proton ( H + ) . The proton is released into solution , while the reductant RH2 is oxidized and NAD + reduced to NADH by transfer of the hydride to the nicotinamide ring . 
 RH2 + NAD + → NADH + H + + R ; 
 From the hydride electron pair , one electron is transferred to the positively charged nitrogen of the nicotinamide ring of NAD + , and the second hydrogen atom transferred to the C4 carbon atom opposite this nitrogen . The midpoint potential of the NAD + / NADH redox pair is − 0 @.@ 32 volts , which makes NADH a strong reducing agent . The reaction is easily reversible , when NADH reduces another molecule and is re @-@ oxidized to NAD + . This means the coenzyme can continuously cycle between the NAD + and NADH forms without being consumed . 
 In appearance , all forms of this coenzyme are white amorphous powders that are hygroscopic and highly water @-@ soluble . The solids are stable if stored dry and in the dark . Solutions of NAD + are colorless and stable for about a week at 4 ° C and neutral pH , but decompose rapidly in acids or alkalis . Upon decomposition , they form products that are enzyme inhibitors . 
 Both NAD + and NADH strongly absorb ultraviolet light because of the adenine . For example , peak absorption of NAD + is at a wavelength of 259 nanometers ( nm ) , with an extinction coefficient of 16 @,@ 900 M − <unk> − 1 . NADH also absorbs at higher wavelengths , with a second peak in UV absorption at 339 nm with an extinction coefficient of 6 @,@ 220 M − <unk> − 1 . This difference in the ultraviolet absorption spectra between the oxidized and reduced forms of the coenzymes at higher wavelengths makes it simple to measure the conversion of one to another in enzyme assays – by measuring the amount of UV absorption at 340 nm using a spectrophotometer . 
 NAD + and NADH also differ in their fluorescence . NADH in solution has an emission peak at 460 nm and a fluorescence lifetime of 0 @.@ 4 nanoseconds , while the oxidized form of the coenzyme does not fluoresce . The properties of the fluorescence signal changes when NADH binds to proteins , so these changes can be used to measure dissociation constants , which are useful in the study of enzyme kinetics . These changes in fluorescence are also used to measure changes in the redox state of living cells , through fluorescence microscopy . 
 = = Concentration and state in cells = = 
 In rat liver , the total amount of NAD + and NADH is approximately 1 <unk> per gram of wet weight , about 10 times the concentration of NADP + and NADPH in the same cells . The actual concentration of NAD + in cell cytosol is harder to measure , with recent estimates in animal cells , ranging around 0 @.@ 3 mM , and approximately 1 @.@ 0 to 2 @.@ 0 mM in yeast . However , more than 80 % of NADH fluorescence in mitochondria is from bound form , so the concentration in solution is much lower . 
 Data for other compartments in the cell are limited , although , in the mitochondrion the concentration of NAD + is similar to that in the cytosol . This NAD + is carried into the mitochondrion by a specific membrane transport protein , since the coenzyme cannot diffuse across membranes . 
 The balance between the oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is called the NAD + / NADH ratio . This ratio is an important component of what is called the redox state of a cell , a measurement that reflects both the metabolic activities and the health of cells . The effects of the NAD + / NADH ratio are complex , controlling the activity of several key enzymes , including glyceraldehyde 3 @-@ phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase . In healthy mammalian tissues , estimates of the ratio between free NAD + and NADH in the cytoplasm typically lie around 700 ; the ratio is thus favourable for oxidative reactions . The ratio of total NAD + / NADH is much lower , with estimates ranging from 3 – 10 in mammals . In contrast , the NADP + / NADPH ratio is normally about 0 @.@ 005 , so NADPH is the dominant form of this coenzyme . These different ratios are key to the different metabolic roles of NADH and NADPH . 
 = = Biosynthesis = = 
 NAD + is synthesized through two metabolic pathways . It is produced either in a de novo pathway from amino acids or in salvage pathways by recycling preformed components such as nicotinamide back to NAD + . 
 = = = De novo production = = = 
 Most organisms synthesize NAD + from simple components . The specific set of reactions differs among organisms , but a common feature is the generation of quinolinic acid ( QA ) from an amino acid — either tryptophan ( Trp ) in animals and some bacteria , or aspartic acid in some bacteria and plants . The quinolinic acid is converted to nicotinic acid <unk> ( <unk> ) by transfer of a <unk> moiety . An adenylate moiety is then transferred to form nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide ( <unk> ) . Finally , the nicotinic acid moiety in <unk> is <unk> to a nicotinamide ( Nam ) moiety , forming nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide . 
 In a further step , some NAD + is converted into NADP + by NAD + kinase , which <unk> NAD + . In most organisms , this enzyme uses ATP as the source of the phosphate group , although several bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus <unk> , use inorganic polyphosphate as an alternative phosphoryl donor . 
 = = = Salvage pathways = = = 
 Besides assembling NAD + de novo from simple amino acid precursors , cells also salvage preformed compounds containing a pyridine base . The three vitamin precursors used in these salvage metabolic pathways are nicotinic acid ( NA ) , nicotinamide ( Nam ) and nicotinamide <unk> ( NR ) . These compounds can be taken up from the diet and are termed vitamin B3 or niacin . However , these compounds are also produced within cells and by digestion of cellular NAD + . Some of the enzymes involved in these salvage pathways appear to be concentrated in the cell nucleus , which may compensate for the high level of reactions that consume NAD + in this organelle . There are some reports that mammalian cells can take up extracellular NAD + from their surroundings . 
 Despite the presence of the de novo pathway , the salvage reactions are essential in humans ; a lack of niacin in the diet causes the vitamin deficiency disease pellagra . This high requirement for NAD + results from the constant consumption of the coenzyme in reactions such as posttranslational modifications , since the cycling of NAD + between oxidized and reduced forms in redox reactions does not change the overall levels of the coenzyme . 
 The salvage pathways used in microorganisms differ from those of mammals . Some pathogens , such as the yeast Candida <unk> and the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae are NAD + <unk> – they cannot synthesize NAD + – but possess salvage pathways and thus are dependent on external sources of NAD + or its precursors . Even more surprising is the intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis , which lacks recognizable candidates for any genes involved in the biosynthesis or salvage of both NAD + and NADP + , and must acquire these coenzymes from its host . 
 = = Functions = = 
 Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide has several essential roles in metabolism . It acts as a coenzyme in redox reactions , as a donor of ADP @-@ ribose moieties in ADP @-@ ribosylation reactions , as a precursor of the second messenger molecule cyclic ADP @-@ ribose , as well as acting as a substrate for bacterial DNA ligases and a group of enzymes called sirtuins that use NAD + to remove acetyl groups from proteins . In addition to these metabolic functions , NAD + emerges as an adenine nucleotide that can be released from cells spontaneously and by regulated mechanisms , and can therefore have important extracellular roles . 
 = = = <unk> binding of NAD = = = 
 The main role of NAD + in metabolism is the transfer of electrons from one molecule to another . Reactions of this type are catalyzed by a large group of enzymes called oxidoreductases . The correct names for these enzymes contain the names of both their substrates : for example NADH @-@ ubiquinone oxidoreductase catalyzes the oxidation of NADH by coenzyme Q. However , these enzymes are also referred to as dehydrogenases or reductases , with NADH @-@ ubiquinone oxidoreductase commonly being called NADH dehydrogenase or sometimes coenzyme Q reductase . 
 When bound to a protein , NAD + and NADH are usually held within a structural motif known as the Rossmann fold . The motif is named after Michael Rossmann who was the first scientist to notice how common this structure is within nucleotide @-@ binding proteins . This fold contains three or more parallel beta strands linked by two alpha helices in the order beta @-@ alpha @-@ beta @-@ alpha @-@ beta . This forms a beta sheet flanked by a layer of alpha helices on each side . Because each Rossmann fold binds one nucleotide , binding domains for NAD + consist of two paired Rossmann folds , with each fold binding one of the two nucleotides of the cofactor . However , this fold is not universal among NAD @-@ dependent enzymes , since a class of bacterial enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism have recently been discovered that bind the coenzyme , but lack this motif . 
 When bound in the active site of an oxidoreductase , the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme is positioned so that it can accept a hydride from the other substrate . Depending on the enzyme , the hydride donor is positioned either " above " or " below " the plane of the planar C4 carbon , as defined in the figure . Class A oxidoreductases transfer the atom from above ; class B enzymes transfer it from below . Since the C4 carbon that accepts the hydrogen is <unk> , this can be exploited in enzyme kinetics to give information about the enzyme 's mechanism . This is done by mixing an enzyme with a substrate that has deuterium atoms substituted for the hydrogens , so the enzyme will reduce NAD + by transferring deuterium rather than hydrogen . In this case , an enzyme can produce one of two stereoisomers of NADH . 
 Despite the similarity in how proteins bind the two coenzymes , enzymes almost always show a high level of specificity for either NAD + or NADP + . This specificity reflects the distinct metabolic roles of the respective coenzymes , and is the result of distinct sets of amino acid residues in the two types of coenzyme @-@ binding pocket . For instance , in the active site of NADP @-@ dependent enzymes , an ionic bond is formed between a basic amino acid side @-@ chain and the acidic phosphate group of NADP + . On the converse , in NAD @-@ dependent enzymes the charge in this pocket is reversed , preventing NADP + from binding . However , there are a few exceptions to this general rule , and enzymes such as <unk> reductase , glucose @-@ 6 @-@ phosphate dehydrogenase , and <unk> reductase can use both coenzymes in some species . 
 = = = Role in redox metabolism = = = 
 The redox reactions catalyzed by oxidoreductases are vital in all parts of metabolism , but one particularly important area where these reactions occur is in the release of energy from nutrients . Here , reduced compounds such as glucose and fatty acids are oxidized , thereby releasing energy . This energy is transferred to NAD + by reduction to NADH , as part of beta oxidation , glycolysis , and the citric acid cycle . In eukaryotes the electrons carried by the NADH that is produced in the cytoplasm are transferred into the mitochondrion ( to reduce mitochondrial NAD + ) by mitochondrial shuttles , such as the malate @-@ aspartate shuttle . The mitochondrial NADH is then oxidized in turn by the electron transport chain , which pumps protons across a membrane and generates ATP through oxidative phosphorylation . These shuttle systems also have the same transport function in chloroplasts . 
 Since both the oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide are used in these linked sets of reactions , the cell maintains significant concentrations of both NAD + and NADH , with the high NAD + / NADH ratio allowing this coenzyme to act as both an oxidizing and a reducing agent . In contrast , the main function of NADPH is as a reducing agent in anabolism , with this coenzyme being involved in pathways such as fatty acid synthesis and photosynthesis . Since NADPH is needed to drive redox reactions as a strong reducing agent , the NADP + / NADPH ratio is kept very low . 
 Although it is important in catabolism , NADH is also used in anabolic reactions , such as gluconeogenesis . This need for NADH in anabolism poses a problem for prokaryotes growing on nutrients that release only a small amount of energy . For example , nitrifying bacteria such as <unk> oxidize nitrite to nitrate , which releases sufficient energy to pump protons and generate ATP , but not enough to produce NADH directly . As NADH is still needed for anabolic reactions , these bacteria use a nitrite oxidoreductase to produce enough proton @-@ motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse , generating NADH . 
 = = = Non @-@ redox roles = = = 
 The coenzyme NAD + is also consumed in ADP @-@ ribose transfer reactions . For example , enzymes called ADP @-@ <unk> add the ADP @-@ ribose moiety of this molecule to proteins , in a posttranslational modification called ADP @-@ ribosylation . ADP @-@ ribosylation involves either the addition of a single ADP @-@ ribose moiety , in mono @-@ ADP @-@ ribosylation , or the transferral of ADP @-@ ribose to proteins in long branched chains , which is called poly ( ADP @-@ ribosyl ) ation . Mono @-@ ADP @-@ ribosylation was first identified as the mechanism of a group of bacterial toxins , notably cholera toxin , but it is also involved in normal cell signaling . Poly ( ADP @-@ ribosyl ) ation is carried out by the poly ( ADP @-@ ribose ) polymerases . The poly ( ADP @-@ ribose ) structure is involved in the regulation of several cellular events and is most important in the cell nucleus , in processes such as DNA repair and telomere maintenance . In addition to these functions within the cell , a group of extracellular ADP @-@ <unk> has recently been discovered , but their functions remain obscure . NAD + may also be added onto cellular RNA as a 5 ' -terminal modification . 
 Another function of this coenzyme in cell signaling is as a precursor of cyclic ADP @-@ ribose , which is produced from NAD + by ADP @-@ ribosyl <unk> , as part of a second messenger system . This molecule acts in calcium signaling by releasing calcium from intracellular stores . It does this by binding to and opening a class of calcium channels called <unk> receptors , which are located in the membranes of organelles , such as the endoplasmic reticulum . 
 NAD + is also consumed by sirtuins , which are NAD @-@ dependent deacetylases , such as <unk> . These enzymes act by transferring an acetyl group from their substrate protein to the ADP @-@ ribose moiety of NAD + ; this cleaves the coenzyme and releases nicotinamide and O @-@ acetyl @-@ ADP @-@ ribose . The sirtuins mainly seem to be involved in regulating transcription through <unk> histones and altering nucleosome structure . However , non @-@ histone proteins can be <unk> by sirtuins as well . These activities of sirtuins are particularly interesting because of their importance in the regulation of aging . 
 Other NAD @-@ dependent enzymes include bacterial DNA ligases , which join two DNA ends by using NAD + as a substrate to donate an adenosine monophosphate ( AMP ) moiety to the 5 ' phosphate of one DNA end . This intermediate is then attacked by the 3 ' hydroxyl group of the other DNA end , forming a new phosphodiester bond . This contrasts with eukaryotic DNA ligases , which use ATP to form the DNA @-@ AMP intermediate .

 In recent years , NAD + has also been recognized as an extracellular signaling molecule involved in cell @-@ to @-@ cell communication . NAD + is released from neurons in blood vessels , urinary bladder , large intestine , from <unk> cells , and from brain <unk> , and is proposed to be a novel neurotransmitter that transmits information from nerves to effector cells in smooth muscle organs . Further studies are needed to determine the underlying mechanisms of its extracellular actions and their importance for human health and diseases . 
 = = Pharmacology and medical uses = = 
 The enzymes that make and use NAD + and NADH are important in both pharmacology and the research into future treatments for disease . Drug design and drug development exploits NAD + in three ways : as a direct target of drugs , by designing enzyme inhibitors or activators based on its structure that change the activity of NAD @-@ dependent enzymes , and by trying to inhibit NAD + biosynthesis . 
 The coenzyme NAD + is not itself currently used as a treatment for any disease . However , it is being studied for its potential use in the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer 's and Parkinson disease . Evidence on the benefit of NAD + in neurodegeneration is mixed ; some studies in mice have produced promising results whereas a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial in humans failed to show any effect . 
 NAD + is also a direct target of the drug isoniazid , which is used in the treatment of tuberculosis , an infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis . <unk> is a prodrug and once it has entered the bacteria , it is activated by a peroxidase enzyme , which oxidizes the compound into a free radical form . This radical then reacts with NADH , to produce adducts that are very potent inhibitors of the enzymes enoyl @-@ acyl carrier protein reductase , and dihydrofolate reductase . In one experiment , mice given NAD for one week had improved nuclear @-@ <unk> communication . 
 Since a large number of oxidoreductases use NAD + and NADH as substrates , and bind them using a highly conserved structural motif , the idea that inhibitors based on NAD + could be specific to one enzyme is surprising . However , this can be possible : for example , inhibitors based on the compounds <unk> acid and <unk> inhibit IMP dehydrogenase at the NAD + binding site . Because of the importance of this enzyme in purine metabolism , these compounds may be useful as anti @-@ cancer , anti @-@ viral , or immunosuppressive drugs . Other drugs are not enzyme inhibitors , but instead activate enzymes involved in NAD + metabolism . <unk> are a particularly interesting target for such drugs , since activation of these NAD @-@ dependent deacetylases extends lifespan . Compounds such as resveratrol increase the activity of these enzymes , which may be important in their ability to delay aging in both vertebrate , and invertebrate model organisms . 
 Because of the differences in the metabolic pathways of NAD + biosynthesis between organisms , such as between bacteria and humans , this area of metabolism is a promising area for the development of new antibiotics . For example , the enzyme <unk> , which converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid , is a target for drug design , as this enzyme is absent in humans but present in yeast and bacteria . 
 In bacteriology , NAD , sometimes referred to factor V , is used a supplement to culture media for some fastidious bacteria . 
 = = History = = 
 The coenzyme NAD + was first discovered by the British biochemists Arthur Harden and William John Young in 1906 . They noticed that adding boiled and filtered yeast extract greatly accelerated alcoholic fermentation in <unk> yeast extracts . They called the unidentified factor responsible for this effect a <unk> . Through a long and difficult purification from yeast extracts , this heat @-@ stable factor was identified as a nucleotide sugar phosphate by Hans von Euler @-@ <unk> . In 1936 , the German scientist Otto Heinrich Warburg showed the function of the nucleotide coenzyme in hydride transfer and identified the nicotinamide portion as the site of redox reactions . 
 Vitamin precursors of NAD + were first identified in 1938 , when Conrad <unk> showed that liver has an " anti @-@ black tongue " activity in the form of nicotinamide . Then , in 1939 , he provided the first strong evidence that niacin is used to synthesize NAD + . In the early 1940s , Arthur Kornberg made another important contribution towards understanding NAD + metabolism , by being the first to detect an enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway . Subsequently , in 1949 , the American biochemists Morris Friedkin and Albert L. Lehninger proved that NADH linked metabolic pathways such as the citric acid cycle with the synthesis of ATP in oxidative phosphorylation . In 1958 , Jack Preiss and Philip Handler discovered the intermediates and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of NAD + ; consequently , salvage synthesis from nicotinic acid is termed the Preiss @-@ Handler pathway . In 2004 , Charles Brenner and co @-@ workers uncovered the nicotinamide <unk> kinase pathway to NAD + . 
 The non @-@ redox roles of NAD ( P ) are a recent discovery . The first of these functions to be identified was the use of NAD + as the ADP @-@ ribose donor in ADP @-@ ribosylation reactions , observed in the early 1960s . Later studies in the 1980s and 1990s revealed the activities of NAD + and NADP + metabolites in cell signaling – such as the action of cyclic ADP @-@ ribose , which was discovered in 1987 . The metabolism of NAD + has remained an area of intense research into the 21st century , with interest being heightened after the discovery of the NAD + -dependent protein deacetylases called sirtuins in 2000 , by Shin @-@ ichiro Imai and coworkers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .

 = Polish Legions ( Napoleonic period ) = 
 The Polish Legions ( also known as the Dąbrowski Legions ) in the Napoleonic period , were several Polish military units that served with the French Army , mainly from 1797 to 1803 , although some units continued to serve until 1815 . 
 After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795 , many Poles believed that Revolutionary France and her allies would come to Poland 's aid . France 's enemies included Poland 's partitioners , Prussia , Austria and Imperial Russia . Many Polish soldiers , officers and volunteers therefore emigrated , especially to Italy ( leading to the expression , " the Polish Legions in Italy " ) and to France , where they joined forces with the local military . The number of Polish recruits soon reached many thousands . With support from Napoleon Bonaparte , Polish military units were formed , bearing Polish military ranks and commanded by Polish officers . They became known as the " Polish Legions " ; a Polish army in exile , under French command . Their best known Polish commanders included Jan Henryk Dąbrowski , Karol Kniaziewicz and Józef Wybicki . 
 The Polish Legions serving alongside the French Army during the Napoleonic Wars saw combat in most of Napoleon 's campaigns , from the West Indies , through Italy and Egypt . When the Duchy of Warsaw was created in 1807 , many of the veterans of the Legions formed a core around which the Duchy 's army was raised under Józef Poniatowski . This force fought a victorious war against Austria in 1809 and would go on to fight alongside the French army in numerous campaigns , culminating in the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812 , which marked the end of the Napoleonic empire , including the Legions , and allied states like the Duchy of Warsaw . 
 = = <unk> and numbers = = 
 Among historians there is a degree of uncertainty about the period in which the Legions existed . <unk> et al. notes that " the heyday of their activity " falls in the years 1797 – 1801 , while <unk> defines the Legions as units that operated between 1797 and 1803 . Similarly , Davies defines the time of their existence as five to six years . The Polish PWN Encyklopedia defines them as units operating in the period of 1797 – 1801 ( in 1801 the Legions were reorganized into demi @-@ brigades ) . The Polish <unk> Encyklopedia notes that the Legions ended with the death of most of their personnel in the Haitian campaign , which concluded in 1803 . When recounting the history of the Polish Legions , some works also describe the operations of Polish units under the French in the period after 1803 ; several smaller formations existed in that time , the most notable of which was the Vistula Legion , which existed between 1808 and 1813 . 
 Estimates of the strength of the Polish Legions also vary and it is believed that between 20 @,@ 000 and 30 @,@ 000 men served in the Legions ' ranks at any one time over the course of their existence . The <unk> Encyklopedia estimate is 21 @,@ 000 for the period up to 1803 . Davies suggests 25 @,@ 000 for the period of up to 1802 – 1803 , as does <unk> et al . <unk> and Jeffries offer an estimate of up to 30 @,@ 000 for the period up to 1801 . Most of the soldiers came from the ranks of the peasantry , with only about 10 percent being drawn from the nobility . 
 = = Origins = = 
 After the Third Partition of Poland ( 1795 ) , many Poles believed that revolutionary France , whose public opinion was very sympathetic to the ideals of the Polish Constitution of 3 May 1791 , would come to Poland 's aid . France 's enemies included Poland 's partitioners , Prussia , Austria and Imperial Russia . Paris was the seat of two Polish organizations laying the claim to be the Polish government @-@ in @-@ exile , the Deputation ( <unk> ) of Franciszek Ksawery <unk> and the Agency ( Agencja ) of Józef Wybicki . Many Polish soldiers , officers and volunteers therefore emigrated , especially to Italy and to France . Eventually , the Agency was successful in convincing the French government ( the Directory ) to organize a Polish military unit . As the French Constitution did not allow for the employment of foreign troops on French soil , the French decided to use the Poles to bolster their allies in Italy , the Cisalpine Republic . 
 Jan Henryk Dąbrowski , a former high @-@ ranking officer in the army of the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth , began his work in 1796 – a year after the total destruction of the Commonwealth . At that time he went to Paris , and later , Milan , where his idea received support from Napoleon Bonaparte , who saw the Poles as a promising source of new recruits , and who superficially appeared receptive to the idea of liberating Poland . Dąbrowski was soon authorized by the French @-@ allied Cisalpine Republic to create the Polish Legions , which would be part of the army of the newly created Republic of Lombardy . This agreement , drafted by Napoleon , was signed on 9 January 1797 , and marked the formal creation of the Legions .

 The Polish soldiers serving in the Dąbrowski Legion were granted <unk> citizenship and were paid the same wage as other troops . They were allowed to use their own unique Polish @-@ style uniforms , with some French and <unk> symbols , and were commanded by other Polish speakers . By early February 1797 the Legion was 1 @,@ 200 strong , having been bolstered by the arrival of many new recruits who had deserted from the Austrian army . 
 The Dąbrowski Legion was first used against Austrians and their allies in Italy . In March 1797 it garrisoned Mantua , and by the end of the month it took part in its first combat during the Ten Days of Brescia . By the end of April the ranks of the Legion had swelled to 5 @,@ 000 . At that time Dąbrowski lobbied for a plan to push through to the Polish territories in Galicia , but that was eventually rejected by Napoleon who instead decided to use those troops on the Italian front . In April , the Legion took part in quelling the uprising in Verona , known as Veronese Easters . The Treaty of Leoben signed that month , which promised peace between Austrians and French , was a blow to Polish morale , but Dąbrowski correctly assumed that it would not last . 
 Sources vary with regards to when the singular Dąbrowski Legion was expanded into multiple Legions . Pivka and Roffe note that in May 1797 the Legion was reorganized into two formations , the first being commanded by Karol Kniaziewicz and the second by Józef Wielhorski , each numbering about 3 @,@ 750 infantry , not counting artillery support . Davies , however , states that the Second Legion was formed in 1798 under Józef Zajączek . In July 1797 the Legions suppressed another insurrection , this time in Reggio Emilia . 
 The Treaty of Campo Formio , signed on 18 October 1797 , resulted in another short period of relative peace . The Legions , hopeful for a renewal of the war , were seen as the most pro @-@ French foreign forces in the <unk> . In May 1798 the Poles helped the French to secure the Papal States , putting down some peasant revolts , and garrisoned Rome , which they entered on 3 May . Dąbrowski obtained a number of trophies from a Roman representative , that the Polish king , Jan III Sobieski , had sent there after his victory over the Ottoman Empire at the siege of Vienna in 1683 ; amongst these was an Ottoman standard which subsequently became part of the Legions ' colors , accompanying them from then on . 
 By the end of 1798 the Legions under Kniaziewicz were fighting against the anti @-@ French forces from the Kingdom of Naples , defeating them at the Battle of Civita Castellana on 4 December . Soon afterward , supplies from the captured Gaeta fortress allowed the creation of a Legion cavalry unit under Andrzej Karwowski . The Poles then fought at <unk> , <unk> , Calvi and Capua before Naples capitulated on 23 January . 
 = = = War of the Second Coalition : Italian front = = = 
 The end of the 1798 and the beginning of 1799 marked the beginning of the War of the Second Coalition . Within about a year of its formation , the Legion had become about 10 @,@ 000 . However , the new series of struggles proved to be much more difficult , as the anti @-@ French coalition advanced upon Italy , now bereft of elite French units which were with Napoleon in Egypt . Overall , 1799 saw the Legions take significant casualties . In mid @-@ 1799 , the First Legion under General Dąbrowski fought against the Russians at Trebbia ( 17 – 19 June 1799 ) , where it suffered heavy casualties ( only two of the five battalions survived the battle , and Dąbrowski was wounded ) . Polish legionaries also fought at the Battle of Novi ( 15 July 1799 ) , and the Second Battle of Zurich ( 26 September ) . 
 The Second Legion also suffered heavily ; particularly in the first battles on the Adige ( 26 March – 5 April 1799 ) where it is estimated that it lost about half to two thirds of its complement of 4 @,@ 000 men . Its commander , General Franciszek <unk> , was killed at the Battle of Magnano on 5 April . The remainder of the Second Legion became part of the garrison at Mantua , which was soon placed under siege by the Austrians . Finally , at the end of the Siege of Mantua ( April – July ) , the French commander François @-@ Philippe de Foissac @-@ Latour decided to release Polish soldiers – then under Wielhorski – into Austrian custody as the Austrians claimed them to be deserters . This marked the end of the Second Legion , as only a small number of Poles were able to evade capture ( the French were allowed to withdraw most of their forces under the condition that they would remain neutral ) . 
 = = = War of the Second Coalition : German front = = = 
 With the end of the Cisalpine Republic , the Legions were reorganized in France , as Napoleon ascended to power as the First Consul and decreed that foreign troops could now serve in the French Army . On 10 February the remnants of the Italian Legions were reorganized near Marseilles into the Italian Legion ( La Legion <unk> ) as a 9 @,@ 000 @-@ strong unit ( although soon reduced to 5 @,@ 000 ) that would become part of the Army of Italy . The Legion fought at the Peschiera and Mantua . 
 In 1800 or 1799 ( sources vary ) , Karol Kniaziewicz organized the 6 @,@ 000 @-@ strong Third Legion ( the Danube Legion , or the Legion du Rhine ) to fight against the Austrians in Bavaria . The Danube Legion , bolstered by Karwowski 's cavalry unit , fought as part of the Army of the Rhine at Berg , <unk> and Offenburg , garrisoning the fortress of <unk> after the armistice of <unk> ( 15 July ) . Polish forces also fought in the Battle of Hohenlinden on 3 December 1800 . According to Davies , the Danube Legion would suffer significant casualties in the short period after the battle and the end of the campaign on 25 December that year . 
 The size of the Legions decreased after the Treaty of <unk> ( 9 February 1801 ) , which to the disappointment of the legionnaires made no mention of Poland . The Legions was transferred to police duties in the Kingdom of Etruria . The Legions ' morale weakened as Poles were not used in any fights that seemed to directly affect the chance of Poland regaining independence . Many legionnaires , including General Kniaziewicz , felt that they had been used by the French and resigned . Dąbrowski remained in command , and reorganized both Legions at Milan into two 6 @,@ 000 @-@ strong units in March 1801 . On 21 December 1801 the Legions were reorganized by the French government into three demi @-@ brigades , with the Italian ( First ) Legion forming the core of the First and Second Foreign Demi @-@ Brigades ( 1er and 2e Demi @-@ Brigade Étrangère ) , and the Danube ( Second ) Legion , the Third Foreign Demi @-@ Brigade ( 3e Demi @-@ Brigade Étrangère ) . 
 = = = The Haitian campaign = = = 
 In 1802 , France sent most of the disgruntled legionnaires ( two demi @-@ brigades , 5 @,@ 280 strong ) to Haiti to put down the Haitian Revolution ( on the Caribbean island of Haiti , known then as Saint Domingue , the French West Indies ) . Napoleon wanted to regain the colony of Saint Domingue , but preferred to save his main French army for more important matters , closer to home . The now inconvenient Polish units were accompanied by contingents of Germans and Swiss French allies , as well as by French units that had fallen out of favour with Napoleon and the French high command . 
 The Haitian campaign proved disastrous for the legionnaires . Combat casualties and tropical diseases , including the yellow fever , reduced the 5 @,@ 280 @-@ strong Polish contingent to a few hundred survivors in the space of less than two years . By the time the French forces retreated from the island in 1803 , about 4 @,@ 000 Poles had died ( either from disease or combat ) . Of the survivors , about 400 remained on the island , a few dozen were dispersed to the nearby islands or to the United States , and about 700 returned to France ( <unk> claims 6 @,@ 000 sent and 330 returned ) . 
 The Poles had little interest or desire to support the French cause in the distant colonies , once again fighting against people who only desired their own independence . In Haiti there still is a popular myth that many Polish soldiers became sympathetic to the former slaves ' cause and deserted the French , supporting Jean @-@ Jacques Dessalines in significant numbers , with entire units changing sides . In fact , the actual desertion rate was much lower ; nonetheless about 150 Polish soldiers joined the Haitian rebels . The loss of that many patriotic military personnel in the Caribbean was a serious blow to the Polish aspirations for regaining independence . The Haitian experience cast further doubts among Poles about France 's and Napoleon 's good intentions toward Poland . 
 = = = Wars of the Third and Fourth Coalition = = = 
 By 1805 , during the War of the Third Coalition , the Polish troops in Italy had been renamed the 1st Polish Legion ( <unk> Legion Polonaise ) and attached to the Kingdom of Italy . In 1806 , all that was left of the old Dąbrowski and Kniaziewicz 's Legions was one demi @-@ brigade , consisting of one infantry regiment and one cavalry regiment , now in the service of the Kingdom of Naples . It fought at Castel Franco , turning the Austrian attack on 24 November 1805 , but on 3 July 1806 it suffered a severe defeat at Sant <unk> a <unk> . Many Polish officers served in French army or allied formations . 
 During the War of the Fourth Coalition , Napoleon decided to encourage Polish defections from the Prussian army , and on 20 September 1806 decreed the creation of a " Northern Legion " under General Zajączek . As the Napoleon did not want to commit himself to the Polish cause , the Legion was however not explicitly Polish , and was , in Napoleon 's words , a gathering of " children of the North " . French armies , including the Legion units , defeated the Prussians in Saxony at the battle of Jena and Poles under Dąbrowski entered former Polish territories ( near the city of Poznań ) , which resulted in the influx of recruits for the legion . A year later , Napoleon , having defeated the Russian armies , met with the Russian Tsar Alexander I at Tilsit and in the ensuing negotiations they agreed that a new , small Polish state under French control ( the Duchy of Warsaw ) would be created . 
 = = = After the creation of the Duchy of Warsaw : the Vistula Legion = = = 
 The main period that the Legions were active was between 1797 and 1803 . Although some chose to remain with the French forces , and fought in Italy under the Kingdom of Naples , in 1807 many veteran legionnaires formed a cadre for the new Army of the Duchy of Warsaw . In February 1807 , the remaining infantry and cavalry regiments who had continued in French service in Italy were reorganized in Silesia , near Breslau , into a Polish @-@ Italian Legion ( <unk> ) , with two new infantry regiments added from the newly liberated Polish lands . On 21 February 1808 , the Legion was relocated to France , reinforced with Poles from other French formations , and incorporated into the French army . On 31 March of that year the legion was officially named the Vistula Legion ( Légion de la <unk> , Legia <unk> ) . By mid @-@ 1808 the Vistula Legion had a strength of 6 @,@ 000 . After the Battle of Wagram ( 5 – 6 July 1809 ) Napoleon attempted to form a second Polish Vistula Legion from Polish prisoners of war , but the new formation could not attract sufficient recruits , and in 1810 it was merged into the original Vistula Legion . 
 During the Peninsular War ( 1809 – 1814 ) in Spain , the Vistula Legion gained fame at the Battle of Zaragoza . In the Battle of <unk> , a small Polish force managed to defeat an Anglo @-@ Spanish expeditionary force outnumbering them 10 @-@ 1 , capturing their commander in the process . Other troops served in Napoleon 's Imperial Guard and the Polish Chevau @-@ léger regiment distinguished itself at the Battle of <unk> in 1808 . Another Polish cavalry regiment – the Vistula uhlans – also fought in Spain . They distinguished themselves many times there , including at the Battle of <unk> in 1811 , where they destroyed a British infantry brigade . Their valour in that conflict inspired the British to create their own lancer units equipped with Polish @-@ style uniforms and weapons . 
 In 1812 , as Napoleon entered Russia , the Poles and Lithuanians rallied to Napoleon 's Grande Armée in the hope of resurrecting the Commonwealth . The Vistula Legion , withdrawn from Spain in early 1812 and reorganized into a division ( with a planned strength of 10 @,@ 500 that was never fully attained ) was part of Napoleon 's invasion forces . Poles formed the largest foreign contingent , 98 @,@ 000 @-@ strong ( the entire French Grande Armée was about 600 @,@ 000 strong ) . Polish Lancers of the Vistula Legion were the first unit to cross the Neman River when the Grand Armee entered Russia and , as part of the Imperial Guard , the first unit to enter Moscow . They distinguished themselves in the Battle of Borodino and , under Prince Józef Poniatowski ( who personally saved Napoleon 's life ) , were one of the units that served as the rear guard during Napoleon 's retreat . This later led to the claim that just as they had been the first to enter it , they were the last to leave Russia . They sustained heavy losses during the campaign : only 26 @,@ 000 of the original 98 @,@ 000 @-@ strong contingent returned . The elite Vistula Legion entering Russia was about 7 @,@ 000 strong ; its strength at the end of the campaign was just 1 @,@ 500 . 
 The definitive end of the Polish Legions came with the conclusion of Napoleon 's career and the abolition of the Duchy of Warsaw . The Duchy was occupied by Prussian and Russian troops following Napoleon 's retreat from Russia . The Polish troops remained loyal to him until the bitter end , with Polish units holding their ground at his last battles at Leipzig ( 15 – 19 October 1813 ) and Hanau ( 30 – 31 October 1813 ) , where they sustained major losses . The Legion was recreated at Sedan in early 1814 , and fought at Soissons , Reims , <unk> @-@ sur @-@ Aube and St @-@ Dizier . After Napoleon 's defeat in the War of the Sixth Coalition , when Napoleon was forced into exile on Elba , the only unit he was allowed to keep as guards were the Polish Lancers . While many Poles returned to the Polish territories , a unit of about 325 men under Colonel <unk> fought in Napoleon 's final 1815 campaign , the " Hundred Days " , participating in the Battle of Waterloo . After Napoleon 's second and final defeat , some are said to have accompanied him to his exile on Saint Helena . 
 = = Assessment and remembrance = = 
 In analyzing the creation of the Polish Legions , many historians have argued that Napoleon used the Poles as a source of recruits and had little desire to invest in the re @-@ creation of the Polish state . Among the most notable of Napoleon 's contemporary Polish detractors was Kościuszko , who refused to join the Legions , arguing that Napoleon would not restore Poland in any durable form . In this regard , Kościuszko also stated that the Duchy of Warsaw was created in 1807 only because it was expedient , rather than because Napoleon supported Polish sovereignty . Nevertheless , the memory of Napoleon 's Polish Legions is strong in Poland , and Napoleon himself is often regarded as a hero and liberator there . About the Polish Legion , Napoleon himself is reputed to have said that 800 Poles would equal 8 @,@ 000 enemy soldiers . 
 Despite their destruction , the Legions became legendary in Poland , helping to spread the civic and democratic ideals of the French Revolution throughout the country . The legionnaires formed a cadre for the Army of the Duchy of Warsaw and also later for the Army of the Congress Kingdom . 
 The Legions are also notable as the source of one of the themes contained in the future Polish national anthem , <unk> <unk> ( Poland Is Not Yet Lost ) . Created by Józef Wybicki , the anthem includes words promising " the return of the Polish army from Italy to Poland " and states that " Poland is not lost as long as we live " in reference to the Polish Legions .

 = Ionian Revolt = 
 The Ionian Revolt , and associated revolts in Aeolis , Doris , Cyprus and Caria , were military rebellions by several Greek regions of Asia Minor against Persian rule , lasting from 499 BC to 493 BC . At the heart of the rebellion was the dissatisfaction of the Greek cities of Asia Minor with the tyrants appointed by Persia to rule them , along with the individual actions of two Milesian tyrants , Histiaeus and Aristagoras . The cities of Ionia had been conquered by Persia around 540 BC , and thereafter were ruled by native tyrants , nominated by the Persian satrap in Sardis . In 499 BC , the then tyrant of Miletus , Aristagoras , launched a joint expedition with the Persian satrap Artaphernes to conquer Naxos , in an attempt to bolster his position . The mission was a debacle , and sensing his imminent removal as tyrant , Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against the Persian king Darius the Great . 
 In 498 BC , supported by troops from Athens and Eretria , the Ionians marched on , captured , and burnt Sardis . However , on their return journey to Ionia , they were followed by Persian troops , and decisively beaten at the Battle of Ephesus . This campaign was the only offensive action by the Ionians , who subsequently went on the defensive . The Persians responded in 497 BC with a three pronged attack aimed at recapturing the outlying areas of the rebellion , but the spread of the revolt to Caria meant that the largest army , under Daurises , relocated there . While initially campaigning successfully in Caria , this army was annihilated in an ambush at the Battle of Pedasus . This resulted in a stalemate for the rest of 496 BC and 495 BC . 
 By 494 BC the Persian army and navy had regrouped , and they made straight for the epicentre of the rebellion at Miletus . The Ionian fleet sought to defend Miletus by sea , but were decisively beaten at the Battle of Lade , after the defection of the Samians . Miletus was then besieged , captured , and its population was brought under Persian rule . This double defeat effectively ended the revolt , and the Carians surrendered to the Persians as a result . The Persians spent 493 BC reducing the cities along the west coast that still held out against them , before finally imposing a peace settlement on Ionia which was generally considered to be both just and fair . 
 The Ionian Revolt constituted the first major conflict between Greece and the Persian Empire , and as such represents the first phase of the Greco @-@ Persian Wars . Although Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold , Darius vowed to punish Athens and Eretria for their support of the revolt . Moreover , seeing that the myriad city states of Greece posed a continued threat to the stability of his Empire , according to Herodotus , Darius decided to conquer the whole of Greece . In 492 BC , the first Persian invasion of Greece , the next phase of the Greco @-@ Persian Wars , would begin as a direct consequence of the Ionian Revolt . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the dark age that followed the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization , significant numbers of Greeks emigrated to Asia Minor and settled there . These settlers were from three tribal groups : the Aeolians , Dorians and Ionians . The Ionians had settled along the coasts of Lydia and Caria , founding the twelve cities which made up Ionia . These cities were Miletus , Myus and Priene in Caria ; Ephesus , Colophon , Lebedos , Teos , Clazomenae , Phocaea and Erythrae in Lydia ; and the islands of Samos and Chios . Although the Ionian cities were independent from each other , they acknowledged their shared heritage , and had a common temple and meeting place , the <unk> . They thus formed a ' cultural league ' , to which they would admit no other cities , or even other tribal Ionians . The cities of Ionia had remained independent until they were conquered by the famous Lydian king Croesus , in around 560 BC . The Ionian cities then remained under Lydian rule until Lydia was in turn conquered by the nascent Achaemenid Empire of Cyrus the Great . 
 While fighting the Lydians , Cyrus had sent messages to the Ionians asking them to revolt against Lydian rule , which the Ionians had refused to do . After Cyrus completed the conquest of Lydia , the Ionian cities now offered to be his subjects under the same terms as they had been subjects of Croesus . Cyrus refused , citing the Ionians ' unwillingness to help him previously . The Ionians thus prepared to defend themselves , and Cyrus sent the Median general Harpagus to conquer Ionia . He first attacked Phocaea ; the <unk> decided to entirely abandon their city and sail into exile in Sicily , rather than become Persian subjects ( although many subsequently returned ) . Some <unk> also chose to emigrate when Harpagus attacked Teos , but the rest of the Ionians remained , and were in turn conquered . 
 The Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule . Elsewhere in the empire , Cyrus was able to identify elite native groups to help him rule his new subjects – such as the priesthood of Judea . No such group existed in Greek cities at this time ; while there was usually an aristocracy , this was inevitably divided into feuding factions . The Persians thus settled for sponsoring a tyrant in each Ionian city , even though this drew them into the Ionians ' internal conflicts . Furthermore , a tyrant might develop an independent streak , and have to be replaced . The tyrants themselves faced a difficult task ; they had to deflect the worst of their fellow citizens ' hatred , while staying in the favour of the Persians . 
 About 40 years after the Persian conquest of Ionia , and in the reign of the fourth Persian king , Darius the Great , the stand @-@ in Milesian tyrant Aristagoras found himself in this familiar predicament . Aristagoras 's uncle Histiaeus had accompanied Darius on campaign in 513 BC , and when offered a reward , had asked for part of the conquered Thracian territory . Although this was granted , Histiaeus 's ambition alarmed Darius 's advisors , and Histiaeus was thus further ' rewarded ' by being compelled to remain in Susa as Darius 's " Royal Table @-@ Companion " . Taking over from Histiaeus , Aristagoras was faced with bubbling discontent in Miletus . In 500 BC , Aristagoras was approached by some exiles from Naxos , who asked him to take control of the island . Seeing an opportunity to strengthen his position in Miletus by conquering Naxos , Aristagoras approached the satrap of Lydia , Artaphernes , with a proposal . If Artaphernes provided an army , Aristagoras would conquer the island , thus extending the boundaries of the empire for Darius , and he would then give Artaphernes a share of the spoils to cover the cost of raising the army . Artaphernes agreed in principle , and asked Darius for permission to launch the expedition . Darius assented to this , and a force of 200 triremes was assembled in order to attack Naxos the following year . 
 = = Naxos campaign ( 499 BC ) = = 
 In the spring of 499 BC , Artaphernes readied the Persian force , and placed his cousin Megabates in command . He then sent ships on to Miletus , where the Ionian troops levied by Aristagoras embarked , and the force then set sail for Naxos . 
 The expedition quickly descended into a debacle . Aristagoras fell out with Megabates on the journey towards Naxos , and Herodotus says that Megabates then sent messengers to Naxos , warning the Naxians of the forces 's intention . It is also possible , however , that this story was spread by Aristagoras after the event , by way of a justification for the subsequent failure of the campaign . At any rate , the Naxians were able to prepare properly for a siege , and the Persians arrived to a well @-@ defended expedition . The Persians laid siege to the Naxians for four months , but eventually they and Aristagoras both ran out of money . The force therefore sailed despondently back to the mainland . 
 = = Start of the Ionian Revolt ( 499 BC ) = = 
 With the failure of his attempt to conquer Naxos , Aristagoras found himself in dire straits ; he was unable to repay Artaphernes , and had , moreover , alienated himself from the Persian royal family . He fully expected to be stripped of his position by Artaphernes . In a desperate attempt to save himself , Aristagoras chose to incite his own subjects , the Milesians , to revolt against their Persian masters , thereby beginning the Ionian Revolt . 
 In autumn 499 BC , Aristagoras held a meeting with the members of his faction in Miletus . He declared that in his opinion the Milesians should revolt , to which all but the historian Hecataeus agreed . At the same time , a messenger sent by Histiaeus arrived in Miletus , imploring Aristagoras to rebel against Darius . Herodotus suggests that this was because Histiaeus was desperate to return to Ionia , and thought he would be sent to Ionia if there was a rebellion . Aristagoras therefore openly declared his revolt against Darius , abdicated from his role as tyrant , and declared Miletus to be a democracy . Herodotus has no doubt that this was only a pretence on Aristagoras 's part of giving up power . Rather it was designed to make the Milesians enthusiastically join the rebellion . The army that had been sent to Naxos was still assembled at Myus and included contingents from other Greek cities of Asia Minor ( i.e. Aeolia and Doris ) as well as men from Mytilene , Mylasa , <unk> and Cyme . Aristagoras sent men to capture all the Greek tyrants present in the army and handed them over to their respective cities in order to gain the cooperation of those cities . Some of the tyrants were executed by their cities , but most were simply banished . It has also been suggested ( Herodotus does not explicitly say so ) that Aristagoras incited the whole army to join his revolt , and also took possession of the ships that the Persians had supplied . If the latter is true , it may explain the length of time it took for the Persians to launch a naval assault on Ionia , since they would have needed to build a new fleet . 
 Although Herodotus presents the revolt as a consequence of Aristagoras and Histiaeus 's personal motives , it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway . The primary grievance was the tyrants installed by the Persians . While Greek states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants , this was a form of government on the decline . Moreover , past tyrants had tended ( and needed ) to be strong and able leaders , whereas the rulers appointed by the Persians were simply the representatives of the Persians . Backed by Persian military might , these tyrants did not need the support of the population , and could thus rule absolutely . Aristagoras 's actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box ; they incited rebellion across Ionia , and tyrannies were everywhere abolished , and democracies established in their place . 
 Aristagoras had brought all of Hellenic Asia Minor into revolt , but evidently realised that the Greeks would need other allies in order to successfully fight the Persians . In the winter of 499 BC , he first sailed to Sparta , the pre @-@ eminent Greek state in matters of war . However , despite Aristagoras 's entreaties , the Spartan king Cleomenes I turned down the offer to lead the Greeks against the Persians . Aristagoras therefore turned instead to Athens . 
 Athens had recently become a democracy , overthrowing its own tyrant Hippias . In their fight to establish the democracy , the Athenians had asked the Persians for aid ( which was not in the end needed ) , in return for submitting to Persian overlordship . Some years later , Hippias had attempted to regain power in Athens , assisted by the Spartans . This attempt failed and Hippias fled to Artaphernes , and tried to persuade him to subjugate Athens . The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to Artaphernes to dissuade him from taking action , but Artaphernes merely instructed the Athenians to take Hippias back as tyrant . Needless to say , the Athenians had baulked at this , and resolved instead to be openly at war with Persia . Since they were already an enemy of Persia , Athens was already in a position to support the Ionian cities in their revolt . The fact that the Ionian democracies were inspired by the example of the Athenian democracy no doubt helped persuade the Athenians to support the Ionian Revolt , especially since the cities of Ionia were ( supposedly ) originally Athenian colonies . 
 Aristagoras was also successful in persuading the city of Eretria to send assistance to the Ionians for reasons that are not completely clear . Possibly commercial reasons were a factor ; Eretria was a mercantile city , whose trade was threatened by Persian dominance of the Aegean . Herodotus suggests that the Eretrians supported the revolt in order to repay the support the Milesians had given Eretria some time previously , possibly referring to the <unk> War . 
 = = Ionian offensive ( 498 BC ) = = 
 Over the winter , Aristagoras continued to foment rebellion . In one incident , he told a group of <unk> ( originally from Thrace ) , who Darius had brought to live in Phrygia , to return to their homeland . Herodotus says that his only purpose in doing this was to vex the Persian high command . 
 = = = Sardis = = = 
 In the spring of 498 BC , an Athenian force of twenty triremes , accompanied by five from Eretria , set sail for Ionia . They joined up with the main Ionian force near Ephesus . Declining to personally lead the force , Aristagoras appointed his brother <unk> and another Milesian , <unk> , as generals . 
 This force was then guided by the Ephesians through the mountains to Sardis , Artaphernes 's satrapal capital . The Greeks caught the Persians unaware , and were able to capture the lower city . However , Artaphernes still held the citadel with a significant force of men . The lower city then caught on fire , Herodotus suggests accidentally , which quickly spread . The Persians in the citadel , being surrounded by a burning city , emerged into the market @-@ place of Sardis , where they fought with the Greeks , forcing them back . The Greeks , demoralised , then retreated from the city , and began to make their way back to Ephesus . 
 Herodotus reports that when Darius heard of the burning of Sardis , he swore vengeance upon the Athenians ( after asking who they indeed were ) , and tasked a servant with reminding him three times each day of his vow : " Master , remember the Athenians " . 
 = = = Battle of Ephesus = = = 
 Herodotus says that when the Persians in Asia Minor heard of the attack on Sardis , they gathered together , and marched to the relief of Artaphernes . When they arrived at Sardis , they found the Greeks recently departed . So they followed their tracks back towards Ephesus . They caught up with the Greeks outside Ephesus and the Greeks were forced to turn and prepare to fight . Holland suggests that the Persians were primarily cavalry ( hence their ability to catch up with the Greeks ) . The typical Persian cavalry of the time were probably missile cavalry , whose tactics were to wear down a static enemy with volley after volley . 
 It is clear that the demoralised and tired Greeks were no match for the Persians , and were completely routed in the battle which ensued at Ephesus . Many were killed , including the Eretrian general , <unk> . The Ionians who escaped the battle made for their own cities , while the remaining Athenians and Eretrians managed to return to their ships and sailed back to Greece . 
 = = = Spread of the revolt = = = 
 The Athenians now ended their alliance with the Ionians , since the Persians had proved to be anything but the easy prey that Aristagoras had described . However , the Ionians remained committed to their rebellion and the Persians did not seem to follow up their victory at Ephesus . Presumably these ad hoc forces were not equipped to lay siege to any of the cities . Despite the defeat at Ephesus , the revolt actually spread further . The Ionians sent men to the Hellespont and Propontis and captured Byzantium and the other nearby cities . They also persuaded the Carians to join the rebellion . Furthermore , seeing the spread of the rebellion , the kingdoms of Cyprus also revolted against Persian rule without any outside persuasion . 
 = = Persian counter @-@ offensive ( 497 – 495 BC ) = = 
 Herodotus 's narrative after the Battle of Ephesus is ambiguous in its exact chronology ; historians generally place Sardis and Ephesus in 498 BC . Herodotus next describes the spread of the revolt ( thus also in 498 BC ) , and says that the Cypriots had one year of freedom , therefore placing the action in Cyprus to 497 BC . He next says that 
 " Daurises , Hymaees , and Otanes , all of them Persian generals and married to daughters of Darius , pursued those Ionians who had marched to Sardis , and drove them to their ships . After this victory they divided the cities among themselves and sacked them . " 
 This passage implies these Persian generals counter @-@ attacked immediately after the Battle of Ephesus . However , the cities that Herodotus describes Daurises as besieging were on the Hellespont , which ( by Herodotus 's own reckoning ) did not become involved in the revolt until after Ephesus . It is therefore easiest to reconcile the account by assuming that Daurises , Hymaees , and Otanes waited until the next campaigning season ( i.e. 497 BC ) , before going on the counter @-@ offensive . The Persian actions that Herodotus describes at the Hellespont and in Caria seem to be in the same year , and most commentators place them in 497 BC . 
 = = = Cyprus = = = 
 In Cyprus , all the kingdoms had revolted except that of Amathus . The leader of the Cypriot revolt was Onesilus , brother of the king of Salamis @-@ in @-@ Cyprus , Gorgus . Gorgus did not want to revolt , so Onesilus locked his brother out of the city and made himself king . Gorgus went over to the Persians , and Onesilus persuaded the other Cypriots , apart from the <unk> , to revolt . He then settled down to besiege Amathus . 
 The following year ( 497 BC ) , Onesilus ( still besieging Amathus ) , heard that a Persian force under <unk> had been dispatched to Cyprus . Onesilus thus sent messengers to Ionia , asking them to send reinforcements , which they did , " in great force " . A Persian army eventually arrived in Cyprus , supported by a Phoenician fleet . The Ionians opted to fight at sea and defeated the Phoenicians . In the simultaneous land battle , the Cypriots gained an initial advantage , killing <unk> . However , the defection of two contingents to the Persians crippled their cause , they were routed and Onesilus was killed . The revolt in Cyprus was thus crushed and the Ionians sailed home . 
 = = = Hellespont and Propontis = = = 
 The Persian forces in Asia Minor seem to have been reorganised in 497 BC , with three of Darius 's sons @-@ in @-@ law , Daurises , Hymaees , and Otanes , taking charge of three armies . Herodotus suggests that these generals divided up the rebellious lands between themselves and then set out to attack their respective areas . 
 Daurises , who seems to have had the largest army , initially took his army to the Hellespont . There , he systematically besieged and took the cities of Dardanus , Abydos , <unk> , Lampsacus and <unk> , each in a single day according to Herodotus . However , when he heard that the Carians were revolting , he moved his army southwards to attempt to crush this new rebellion . This places the timing of the Carian revolt to early 497 BC . 
 Hymaees went to the Propontis and took the city of Cius . After Daurises moves his forces towards Caria , Hymaees marched towards the Hellespont and captured many of the Aeolian cities as well as some of the cities in the Troad . However , he then fell ill and died , ending his campaign . Meanwhile , Otanes , together with Artaphernes , campaigned in Ionia ( see below ) . 
 = = = Caria = = = 
 = = = = Battle of the Marsyas = = = = 
 Hearing that the Carians had rebelled , Daurises led his army south into Caria . The Carians gathered at the " White Pillars " , on the Marsyas River ( the modern <unk> ) , a tributary of the Maeander . <unk> , a relative of the king of Cilicia , suggested that the Carians should cross the river and fight with it at their backs , so as to prevent retreat and thus make them fight more bravely . This idea was rejected and the Carians made the Persians cross the river to fight them . The ensuing battle was , according to Herodotus , a long affair , with the Carians fighting obstinately before eventually succumbing to the weight of Persian numbers . Herodotus suggests that 10 @,@ 000 Carians and 2 @,@ 000 Persians died in the battle . 
 = = = = Battle of Labraunda = = = = 
 The survivors of Marsyas fell back to a sacred grove of Zeus at Labraunda and deliberated whether to surrender to the Persians or to flee Asia altogether . However , while deliberating , they were joined by a Milesian army , and with these reinforcements resolved instead to carry on fighting . The Persians then attacked the army at Labraunda , and inflicted an even heavier defeat , with the Milesians suffering particularly bad casualties . 
 = = = = Battle of Pedasus = = = = 
 After the double victory over the Carians , Daurises began the task of reducing the Carian strongholds . The Carians resolved to fight on , and decided to lay an ambush for Daurises on the road through Pedasus . Herodotus implies that this occurred more or less directly after Labraunda , but it has also been suggested that Pedasus occurred the following year ( 496 BC ) , giving the Carians time to regroup . The Persians arrived at Pedasus during the night , and the ambush was sprung to great effect . The Persian army was annihilated and Daurises and the other Persian commanders were slain . The disaster at Pedasus seems to have created a stalemate in the land campaign , and there was apparently little further campaigning in 496 BC and 495 BC . 
 = = = Ionia = = = 
 The third Persian army , under the command of Otanes and Artaphernes , attacked Ionia and Aeolia . They re @-@ took Clazomenae and Cyme , probably in 497 BC , but then seem to have been less active in 496 BC and 495 BC , probably as a result of the calamity in Caria . 
 At the height of the Persian counter @-@ offensive , Aristagoras , sensing the untenability of his position , decided to abandon his responsibilities as leader of Miletus and of the revolt . He left Miletus with all the members of his faction who would accompany him , and went to the part of Thrace that Darius had granted to Histiaeus after the campaign of 513 BC . Herodotus , who evidently has a rather negative view of him , suggests that Aristagoras simply lost his nerve and fled . Some modern historians have suggested that he went to Thrace to exploit the greater natural resources of the region , and thus support the revolt . Others have suggested that finding himself at the centre of an internal conflict in Miletus , he chose to go into exile rather than exacerbate the situation . 
 In Thrace , he took control of the city that Histiaeus had founded , <unk> ( site of the later Amphipolis ) , and started campaigning against the local Thracian population . However , during one campaign , probably in either 497 BC or 496 BC , he was killed by the Thracians . Aristagoras was the one man who might have been able to provide the revolt with a sense of purpose , but after his death the revolt was left effectively leaderless . 
 Shortly after this , Histiaeus was released from his duties in Susa by Darius and sent to Ionia . He had persuaded Darius to let him travel to Ionia by promising to make the Ionians end their revolt . However , Herodotus leaves us in no doubt that his real aim was simply to escape his quasi @-@ captivity in Persia . When he arrived in Sardis , Artaphernes directly accused him of fomenting the rebellion with Aristagoras : " I will tell you , Histiaeus , the truth of this business : it was you who stitched this shoe , and Aristagoras who put it on . " Histiaeus fled that night to Chios and eventually made his way back to Miletus . However , having just got rid of one tyrant , the Milesians were in no mood to receive Histiaeus back . He therefore went to Mytilene in Lesbos and persuaded the Lesbians to give him eight triremes . He set sail for Byzantium with all those who would follow him . There he established himself , seizing all ships that attempted to sail through the Bosporus , unless they agreed to serve him . 
 = = End of the revolt ( 494 – 493 BC ) = = 
 = = = Battle of Lade = = = 
 By the sixth year of the revolt ( 494 BC ) , the Persian forces had regrouped . The available land forces were gathered into one army , and were accompanied by a fleet supplied by the re @-@ subjugated Cypriots , along with Egyptians , Cilicians and Phoenicians . The Persians headed directly to Miletus , paying little attention to other strongholds , presumably intending to tackle the revolt at its epicentre . The Median general Datis , an expert on Greek affairs , was certainly dispatched to Ionia by Darius at this time . It is therefore possible that he was in overall command of this Persian offensive . 
 Hearing of the approach of this force , the Ionians met at the Panionium , and decided not to attempt to fight on land , leaving the Milesians to defend their walls . Instead , they opted to gather every ship they could and make for the island of Lade , off the coast of Miletus , in order to " fight for Miletus at sea " . The Ionians were joined by the Aeolian islanders from Lesbos , and altogether they had 353 triremes . 
 According to Herodotus , the Persian commanders were concerned that they would not be able to defeat the Ionian fleet and , therefore , would not be able to take Miletus . So they sent the exiled Ionian tyrants to Lade , where each tried to persuade his fellow citizens to desert to the Persians . This approach was initially unsuccessful , but in the week @-@ long delay before the battle , divisions arose in the Ionian camp . These divisions led to the Samians secretly agreeing to the terms offered by the Persians , but remained with the other Ionians for the time being . 
 Soon after , the Persian fleet moved to attack the Ionians , who sailed out to meet them . However , as the two sides neared each other , the Samians sailed away back to Samos , as they had agreed with the Persians . The Lesbians , seeing their neighbours in the battle @-@ line sail away , promptly fled as well , causing the rest of the Ionian line to dissolve . The Chians , together with a small number of ships from other cities , stubbornly remained and fought the Persians , but most of the Ionians fled to their cities . The Chians fought valiantly , at one point breaking the Persian line and capturing many ships , but sustaining many losses of their own ; eventually the remaining Chian ships sailed away , thereby ending the battle . 
 = = = Fall of Miletus = = = 
 With the defeat of the Ionian fleet , the revolt was effectively over . Miletus was closely invested , the Persians " mining the walls and using every device against it , until they utterly captured it " . According to Herodotus , most of the men were killed , and the women and children were enslaved . Archaeological evidence partially substantiates this , showing widespread signs of destruction , and abandonment of much of the city in the aftermath of Lade . However , some Milesians did remain in ( or quickly returned to ) Miletus , though the city would never recapture its former greatness . 
 Miletus was thus notionally " left empty of Milesians " ; the Persians took the city and coastal land for themselves , and gave the rest of the Milesian territory to Carians from Pedasus . The captive Milesians were brought before Darius in Susa , who settled them on the coast of the Persian Gulf , near the mouth of the Tigris . 
 Many Samians were appalled by the actions of their generals at Lade , and resolved to emigrate before their old tyrant , <unk> of Samos , returned to rule them . They accepted an invitation from the people of Zancle to settle on the coast of Sicily , and took with them the Milesians who had managed to escape from the Persians . Samos itself was spared from destruction by the Persians because of the Samian defection at Lade . Most of Caria now surrendered to the Persians , although some strongholds had to be captured through force . 
 = = = Histiaeus 's campaign ( 493 BC ) = = =

 When Histiaeus heard of the fall of Miletus , he seems to have appointed himself as leader of the resistance against Persia . Setting out from Byzantium with his force of Lesbians , he sailed to Chios . The Chians refused to receive him , so he attacked and destroyed the remnants of the Chian fleet . Crippled by the two defeats at sea , the Chians then acquiesced to Histiaeus 's leadership . 
 = = = = Battle of Malene = = = = 
 Histiaeus now gathered a large force of Ionians and Aeolians and went to besiege Thasos . However , he then received the news that the Persian fleet was setting out from Miletus to attack the rest of Ionia , so he quickly returned to Lesbos . In order to feed his army , he led foraging expeditions to the mainland near <unk> and Myus . A large Persian force under Harpagus was in the area and eventually intercepted one foraging expedition near Malene . The ensuing battle was hard fought , but was ended by a successful Persian cavalry charge , routing the Greek line . Histiaeus himself surrendered to the Persians , thinking that he would be able to talk himself into a pardon from Darius . However , he was taken to Artaphernes instead , who , fully aware of Histiaeus 's past treachery , impaled him and then sent his embalmed head to Darius . 
 = = = Final operations ( 493 BC ) = = = 
 The Persian fleet and army wintered at Miletus , before setting out in 493 BC to finally stamp out the last embers of the revolt . They attacked and captured the islands of Chios , Lesbos and Tenedos . On each , they made a ' human @-@ net ' of troops and swept across the whole island to flush out any hiding rebels . They then moved over to the mainland and captured each of the remaining cities of Ionia , similarly seeking out any remaining rebels . Although the cities of Ionia were undoubtedly harrowed in the aftermath , none seems to have suffered quite the fate of Miletus . Herodotus says that the Persians chose the most handsome boys from each city and castrated them , and chose the most beautiful girls and sent them away to the king 's harem , and then burnt the temples of the cities . While this is possibly true , Herodotus also probably exaggerates the scale of devastation . In a few years , the cities had more @-@ or @-@ less returned to normal and they were able to equip a large fleet for the second Persian invasion of Greece , just 13 years later . 
 The Persian army then re @-@ conquered the settlements on the Asian side of the Propontis , while the Persian fleet sailed up the European coast of the Hellespont , taking each settlement in turn . With all of Asia Minor now firmly returned to Persian rule , the revolt was finally over . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Once the inevitable punishment of the rebels had occurred , the Persians were in the mood for conciliation . Since these regions were now Persian territory again , it made no sense to harm their economies further or to drive the people to further rebellions . Artaphernes thus set out to re @-@ establish a workable relationship with his subjects . He summoned representatives from each Ionian city to Sardis , and told them that henceforth , rather than continually quarrelling and fighting between themselves , disputes would be resolved by arbitration , seemingly by a panel of judges . Furthermore , he re @-@ surveyed the land of each city , and set their tribute level in proportion to its size . Artaphernes had also witnessed just how much the Ionians disliked tyrannies , and began to reconsider his position on the local governance of Ionia . The following year , Mardonius , another son @-@ in @-@ law of Darius , would travel to Ionia and abolish the tyrannies , replacing them with democracies . The peace established by Artaphernes would long be remembered as just and fair . Darius actively encouraged the Persian nobility of the area to participate in Greek religious practices , especially those dealing with Apollo . Records from the period indicate that the Persian and Greek nobility began to intermarry , and the children of Persian nobles were given Greek names instead of Persian names . Darius ' conciliatory policies were used as a type of propaganda campaign against the mainland Greeks , so that in 491 BC , when Darius sent heralds throughout Greece demanding submission ( earth and water ) , initially most city @-@ states accepted the offer , Athens and Sparta being the most prominent exceptions . 
 For the Persians , the only unfinished business that remained by the end of 493 BC was to exact punishment on Athens and Eretria for supporting the revolt . The Ionian Revolt had severely threatened the stability of Darius 's empire , and the states of mainland Greece would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with . Darius thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of Greece , beginning with the destruction of Athens and Eretria . 
 Therefore , the first Persian invasion of Greece effectively began in the following year , 492 BC , when Mardonius was dispatched ( via Ionia ) to complete the pacification of the land approaches to Greece and push on to Athens and Eretria if possible . Thrace was re @-@ subjugated , having broken loose from Persian rule during the revolts and Macedon compelled to become a vassal of Persia . However , progress was halted by a naval disaster . A second expedition was launched in 490 BC under Datis and Artaphernes , son of the satrap Artaphernes . This amphibious force sailed across the Aegean , subjugating the Cyclades , before arriving off Euboea . Eretria was besieged , captured and destroyed , and the force then moved onto Attica . Landing at the Bay of Marathon , they were met by an Athenian army and defeated in the famous Battle of Marathon , ending the first Persian attempt to subdue Greece . 
 = = Significance = = 
 The Ionian Revolt was primarily of significance as the opening chapter in , and causative agent of the Greco @-@ Persian Wars , which included the two invasions of Greece and the famous battles of Marathon , Thermopylae and Salamis . For the Ionian cities themselves , the revolt ended in failure , and substantial losses , both material and economic . However , Miletus aside , they recovered relatively quickly and prospered under Persian rule for the next forty years . For the Persians , the revolt was significant in drawing them into an extended conflict with the states of Greece which would last for fifty years , over which time they would sustain considerable losses . 
 Militarily , it is difficult to draw too many conclusions from the Ionian Revolt , save for what the Greeks and Persians may ( or may not ) have learnt about each other . Certainly , the Athenians , and Greeks in general , seem to have been impressed by the power of Persian cavalry , with the Greek armies displaying considerable caution during the following campaigns when confronted by the Persian cavalry . Conversely , the Persians seem not to have realised or noticed the potential of the Greek hoplites as heavy infantry . At the Battle of Marathon , in 490 BC , the Persians took little heed of a primarily <unk> army , resulting in their defeat . Furthermore , despite the possibility of recruiting heavy infantry from their domains , the Persians began the second invasion of Greece without doing so , and again encountered major problems in the face of Greek armies . It is possible that , given the ease of their victories over the Greeks at Ephesus , and similarly armed forces at the battles of the Marsyas River and Labraunda , the Persians simply disregarded the military value of the hoplite phalanx — to their cost .

 = Es ist das Heil uns kommen her , BWV 9 = 
 Es ist das Heil uns kommen her ( It is our salvation come here to us ) , BWV 9 , is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach . He composed the chorale cantata in Leipzig for the sixth Sunday after Trinity between 1732 and 1735 , based on the hymn " Es ist das Heil uns kommen her " by Paul Speratus . Bach composed the cantata to fill a gap in his cycle of chorale cantatas written for performances in Leipzig from 1724 . 
 The cantata is structured in seven movements , framed as the earlier chorale cantatas by a chorale fantasia and a chorale four @-@ part setting of the first and the twelfth stanza in the original words by the reformer Speratus , published in the First Lutheran Hymnal . The theme is salvation from sin by God 's grace alone . An anonymous librettist paraphrased the content of ten inner stanzas to alternating recitatives and arias . Bach scored the cantata for a chamber ensemble of four vocal parts , flauto traverso , oboe d 'amore , strings and continuo . He gave all three recitatives to the bass , like a sermon interrupted in reflection by a tenor aria with solo violin and a duet of soprano and alto with the wind instruments . 
 = = History and words = = 
 Bach composed the cantata for the Sixth Sunday after Trinity between 1732 and 1735 . It filled a gap in his second annual cycle of chorale cantatas written for performance in Leipzig . In 1724 , when he composed the cycle , he had an engagement in Köthen that Sunday , and therefore left the text for later completion . The cantata is based on a hymn " Es ist das Heil uns kommen her " by Paul Speratus , which was published in 1524 in the <unk> , the first Lutheran hymnal . The theme of the chorale is the Lutheran creed of salvation from sin by God 's grace alone ( justification by faith ) , summarized in the first stanza : " Deeds can never help , ... faith beholds Jesus Christ , ... He has become the <unk> " . 
 The prescribed readings for the Sunday are from the Epistle to the Romans , " By Christ 's death we are dead for sin " ( Romans 6 : 3 – 11 ) , and from the Gospel of Matthew a passage from the Sermon on the Mount about better justice than the justice of merely observing laws and rules ( Matthew 5 : 20 – 26 ) . The 14 @-@ stanza hymn matches the topic of the gospel . An unknown poet transformed the first 12 stanzas of the chorale to seven cantata movements . Dropping the last two stanzas , the librettist kept stanza 1 as the first and stanza 12 as the last movement , rephrased stanzas 2 – 4 to a recitative ( 2 ) , stanzas 5 – 7 to a recitative ( 4 ) , stanzas 9 – 11 to a third recitative ( 6 ) . Ideas from stanza 8 were made an aria ( 5 ) , and movement 3 is not derived directly from the chorale , but intensifies the conclusion of the first recitative . The three recitatives can be considered a sermon , according to Julian Mincham , who comments : " All three speak of God 's Laws ; their bestowal , their fulfillment ( or lack of it ) and our attitudes towards them " , and who summarizes : " The three recitatives were clearly planned as a cognate group and encapsulate the fundamental Lutheran creed . The two intervening arias , and finally the chorale , reflect upon and extend their statements . " Christoph Wolff assumes that the text was written for Bach 's 1724 cycle of chorale cantatas by the same librettist . 
 Bach had used selected stanzas of the hymn before , in 1716 stanza 12 to conclude Mein Gott , wie lang , ach lange ? BWV 155 , in 1723 both stanza 12 and 11 to conclude the two parts of <unk> dich , o Seele , nicht , BWV 186 , and in 1724 stanza 11 to conclude Wahrlich , wahrlich , ich sage euch , BWV 86 .

 The opening chorus , " Es ist das Heil uns kommen her " ( It is our salvation come here to us ) , is a chorale fantasia , the vocal part embedded in a concerto of the instruments . The cantus firmus of the chorale melody is in the soprano in unadorned long notes , while the lower voices engage in imitation . The scoring with the obbligato instruments flute and oboe d 'amore in contrast to the strings is unusual , sometimes the first violin takes also part in the concerto .

 " Gott gab uns ein Gesetz " ( God gave us the Law ) , is the first of three recitatives which are sung by the bass as the vox Christi ( voice of Christ ) , almost like one sermon , which is only deepened by the two arias in between . The recitatives are secco with the only exception of the final line of movement 4 , " ... und fest um Jesu <unk> <unk> " ( ... embrace the arms of Jesus ) , which is rendered arioso , in " an enlightening major key , a tender vocal phrase and the late semi @-@ quaver continuo line " .

 = Bombing of Singapore ( 1944 – 45 ) = 
 The Bombing of Singapore ( 1944 – 45 ) was a military campaign conducted by the Allied air forces during World War II . United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) long @-@ range bomber units conducted 11 air raids on Japanese @-@ occupied Singapore between November 1944 and March 1945 . Most of these raids targeted the island 's naval base and dockyard facilities , and minelaying missions were conducted in nearby waters . After the American bombers were redeployed , the British Royal Air Force assumed responsibility for minelaying operations near Singapore and these continued until 24 May 1945 . 
 The raids had mixed results . While significant damage was inflicted on Singapore 's important naval base and commercial port , some raids on these targets were not successful and other attacks on oil storage facilities on islands near Singapore were ineffective . The minelaying campaign disrupted Japanese shipping in the Singapore area and resulted in the loss of three vessels and damage to a further ten , but was not decisive . The Allied air attacks were successful in raising the morale of Singapore 's civilian population , who believed that the raids marked the impending liberation of the city . The overall number of civilian casualties from the bombings was low , though civilian workers were killed during attacks on military facilities ; one attack rendered hundreds of people homeless . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the decades after World War I , Britain expanded Singapore Naval Base at Sembawang on Singapore 's north coast as part of plans to deter Japanese expansionism in the region ( the Singapore strategy ) . The resulting facility was among the most important in the British Empire and included the large King George VI graving dock and Admiralty IX floating dry dock . The Commonwealth forces allocated to Malaya and Singapore were swiftly defeated in the months after the outbreak of the Pacific War , however , and the island was surrendered to the Japanese on 15 February 1942 . Singapore was bombed by Japanese aircraft on a number of occasions during the Battle of Malaya and subsequent fighting on the island itself ; these raids caused many civilian deaths . 
 Singapore Naval Base suffered little damage during the fighting in 1941 and 1942 , and became the most important facility of the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) outside the Japanese home islands . As was the case under British rule , many locally recruited civilians worked in the base , though the Japanese Navy subjected them to harsh discipline which included physical beatings for minor mistakes as well as imprisonment or execution for theft and leaks of information . The Japanese Second Fleet and Third Fleet were transferred from the central Pacific to Singapore and the nearby Lingga Islands between February and April 1944 to be closer to their sources of fuel oil . These two fleets comprised the main body of the IJN , and operated most of its remaining battleships and aircraft carriers . 
 The forces allocated to the defence of Singapore were not strong . In early 1945 , Japanese air defences for the island included only two Army companies equipped with automatic cannon , some IJN anti @-@ aircraft units , and a small number of fighter aircraft . Some of the anti @-@ aircraft guns were crewed by Malay auxiliaries . The effectiveness of what was already an inadequate air defence force was hindered by a lack of coordination between the Army and Navy , shortages of fire control equipment for the guns , and no fire @-@ control radar or barrage balloons being available . Defence against night raids was particularly weak as no night fighters were stationed near Singapore and coordination between the anti @-@ aircraft guns and searchlight units was poor . 
 In June 1944 , the USAAF 's XX Bomber Command began flying combat operations with B @-@ 29 Superfortress heavy bombers from air bases near Kharagpur in northeastern India . Although the Command 's primary role was to attack industrial targets in the Japanese home islands , approximately 50 percent of its missions were undertaken to support other Allied operations in the Pacific . The XX Bomber Command reported to the USAAF 's Twentieth Air Force , which was personally directed from Washington , D.C. , by the commander of the USAAF General Henry H. Arnold , rather than the Allied theatre commanders in India and China . Major General Curtis LeMay assumed command of XX Bomber Command on 29 August after Arnold relieved its first commander . 
 Following the Japanese defeat in the Battle of Leyte Gulf in late October 1944 , the remnants of the IJN were concentrated into two groups of ships . One group returned to bases in the Inland Sea , while the other was stationed at the Lingga Islands . On 27 October , Arnold suggested to LeMay that the Japanese defeat at Leyte might have increased the importance of Singapore 's naval facilities and asked whether XX Bomber Command could attack targets on the island . Little recent intelligence on Singapore was available , and on 30 October a photo @-@ reconnaissance B @-@ 29 overflew Singapore for the first time and took good photos of the island . Despite this success , LeMay 's staff believed that a daylight attack on Singapore — which required a 4 @,@ 000 mi ( 6 @,@ 400 km ) round trip from Kharagpur — could not be successful . Regardless , Arnold ordered that XX Bomber Command attack Singapore . 
 = = Raids = = 
 = = = Initial attack = = = 
 The first raid on Singapore took place on 5 November 1944 . XX Bomber Command dispatched 76 B @-@ 29s from their bases around Kharagpur . Because of the extreme range to the target , the aircraft were each armed with only two 1 @,@ 000 pound bombs ; pilots were also instructed to bomb from the lower @-@ than @-@ normal altitude of 20 @,@ 000 ft ( 6 @,@ 100 m ) , and to maintain a loose formation . The raid 's primary target was the King George VI Graving Dock , and the <unk> refinery in northern Sumatra was assigned as the secondary target . 
 The first B @-@ 29s arrived over Singapore Naval Base at 06 : 44 . Bombing was highly accurate , with the lead aircraft putting a bomb within 50 ft ( 15 m ) of the graving dock 's caisson gate . The third B @-@ 29 's bombs landed nearby and other aircraft also scored direct hits on the graving dock , rendering it unserviceable for three months . The bombs which landed in and near the King George VI Graving Dock also damaged the 465 ft ( 142 m ) freighter that was under repair in it at the time . Many of the civilian workers in and around the dock were unable to escape and were killed . The raiders also inflicted damage on other facilities in the naval base . Overall , 53 Superfortresses bombed Singapore Naval Base while seven attacked <unk> refinery . Few Japanese anti @-@ aircraft guns or aircraft fired on the raiders , but two B @-@ 29s were lost in accidents . This raid was the longest daylight bombing operation to have been conducted up to that time . Following the attack , Japanese soldiers murdered a group of injured Indonesian workers . The damage to the King George VI Graving Dock meant that it could not be used to repair the Japanese battleships damaged at the Battle of Leyte Gulf . 
 = = = Later bombing raids = = = 
 The next raid on Singapore took place in January 1945 . Following reports that Japanese warships damaged during the Philippines Campaign were being repaired at Singapore , a force of 47 Superfortresses was dispatched from India to attack the Admiralty IX Floating Dock as well as the King 's Dock on the island 's south coast . These aircraft took off at about midnight on 10 January and began to arrive over Singapore at 08 : 20 on 11 January . Only 27 of the attackers struck the docks , and due to heavy anti @-@ aircraft fire from Japanese warships in the Straits of Johor the bombers did not cause any damage . The other aircraft bombed Penang in Malaya , Mergui in Burma and several targets of opportunity , generally without success . Two B @-@ 29s were lost during this operation . 
 In January 1945 , XX Bomber Command began preparations to redeploy to the Mariana Islands . The Command ceased its attacks on Japan and East Asia , for which it used bases in China to refuel the B @-@ 29s en route to their targets , and instead focused on targets in Southeast Asia that could be reached from Kharagpur . As there were few industrial targets within range of Kharagpur , the highest priority was given to attacking shipping in major ports such as Rangoon , Bangkok and Singapore as well as smaller harbours . Attacks were conducted through both conventional bombing and laying naval mines . As part of the transition , LeMay departed for the Mariana Islands on 18 January and was replaced by Brigadier General Roger M. Ramsey . 
 XX Bomber Command conducted a major conventional bombing raid on Singapore Naval Base on 1 February . On that day , 112 B @-@ 29s were dispatched , each armed with four 1 @,@ 000 lb ( 450 kg ) bombs . The raid 's primary target , the Admiralty IX Floating Dock , was bombed by 67 of the 88 aircraft that reached Singapore . This attack sank the dry dock and destroyed the 460 ft ( 140 m ) ship berthed inside it . The other 21 aircraft that attacked Singapore bombed the West Wall area of the naval base and destroyed many buildings and some heavy equipment ; this area housed the base 's main offices . Of the remaining aircraft , 20 diverted and attacked targets in Penang and <unk> . A Japanese fighter shot down one of the B @-@ 29s and another Superfortress was destroyed on landing after suffering damage from air attack . 
 Although XX Bomber Command began preparations to attack on Singapore Naval Base again on 6 February , this raid was cancelled on the third of the month by Admiral Louis Mountbatten , the commander of Allied forces in the Southeast Asian theatre . Mountbatten ordered that the naval installations at Singapore and Penang not be targeted as they would be needed by Allied forces following the projected liberation of Malaya and Singapore later in 1945 . After requesting clarification of this order , Ramsey met with Mountbatten at Kandy . In this meeting Mountbatten assigned targets in the Kuala Lumpur area as XX Bomber Command 's first priority , while second priority was given to carefully selected areas of Singapore . These areas excluded the King George VI Graving Dock and several other docks and areas with heavy machinery , but allowed attacks on the West Wall area of Singapore Naval Base , naval oil stores and commercial dock facilities . Saigon was assigned as XX Bomber Command 's third priority and fourth priority was given to oil storage dumps on islands near Singapore . 
 The next bombing raid on Singapore took place on 24 February . On that day , 116 B @-@ 29s were dispatched to bomb the Empire Dock area at Singapore 's southern tip . This was a commercial dock , and was considered by XX Bomber Command planners to be " the only suitable primary target free of stipulations left in this theatre " . The bombers were armed with incendiary bombs , and the 105 B @-@ 29s which reached Singapore succeeded in burning out 39 percent of the warehouse area near the dock . As a result of the target being obscured by smoke , 26 of the B @-@ 29s used blind rather than visual bombing , resulting in poor accuracy and damage to civilian residential and commercial areas near the dock area . The <unk> Shimbun newspaper subsequently reported that 396 people had been made homeless by the raid . USAAF losses from the raid were limited to a single B @-@ 29 which crashed after running out of fuel on its way back to India . 
 XX Bomber Command attacked Singapore again on 2 March . As many of the Command 's service units were en route to the Marianas , only 64 B @-@ 29s could be dispatched . These aircraft targeted the shop and warehouse area in Singapore Naval Base with 500 lb ( 230 kg ) bombs . The 49 B @-@ 29s which reached Singapore bombed this area and added to the damage caused by earlier raids , but the results of the attack were again limited by anti @-@ aircraft fire from Japanese warships . Two B @-@ 29s were shot down by anti @-@ aircraft guns . 
 The final two raids conducted by XX Bomber Command before it deployed to the Marianas targeted oil storage facilities on islands in the Singapore area . On 12 March , three B @-@ 29 groups were dispatched to attack Bukom and <unk> islands just off the south coast of Singapore as well as <unk> Island , which is a few miles south near Batam Island in the Dutch East Indies . Each of the groups was assigned a different island and no Japanese anti @-@ aircraft guns or fighters were encountered . Despite this , poor weather meant that the 44 B @-@ 29s which reached the target area had to use blind bombing techniques and their attacks caused little damage . The command 's final attack before it departed for the Marianas took place on the night of 29 / 30 March when 29 Superfortresses were sent to attack Bukom Island . In order to train the aircrew for the low @-@ level tactics which were being used against the Japanese home islands , the bombers attacked their targets individually from altitudes between 5 @,@ 000 ft ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) and 7 @,@ 000 ft ( 2 @,@ 100 m ) . This raid destroyed seven of the 49 oil tanks in the island , and a further three were damaged . No B @-@ 29s were lost in either attack . 
 = = = Minelaying near Singapore = = = 
 As part of its campaign against shipping , around each full moon from late January 1945 XX Bomber Command conducted minelaying missions . On the night of 25 / 26 January , 41 B @-@ 29s from the 444th and 468th Bombardment Groups laid six minefields in the approaches to Singapore . On the same night other B @-@ 29s laid mines off Saigon and Cam Ranh Bay as part of the largest single aerial minelaying effort in the Pacific up to that time . On the night of 27 / 28 February , twelve B @-@ 29s were dispatched to lay mines in the Straits of Johor near Singapore . Ten of these aircraft successfully deployed 55 mines in the target area , and another aircraft mined Penang . During the next full moon period on the night of 28 / 29 March , 22 B @-@ 29s laid mines near Singapore . No aircraft were lost during these missions . 
 Following the withdrawal of XX Bomber Command , the British Royal Air Force 's No. 222 Group assumed responsibility for minelaying operations in the Singapore area using B @-@ 24 Liberator bombers . Minelaying ceased on 24 May so that unswept mines did not interfere with the planned British @-@ led landings in Malaya which were scheduled for September . The Japanese established observation posts on islands in the Singapore Strait to spot minefields , but these were not effective and generally the fields were not detected until a ship struck a mine . In total , air @-@ dropped mines sank three ships near Singapore and damaged another ten . Moreover , the minefields disrupted Japanese convoy routes and efforts to repair ships . The Allied minelaying campaign was too brief to achieve decisive results , however . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 XX Bomber Command 's attacks on Singapore produced mixed results . The raids on Singapore Naval Base damaged or destroyed many workshops and denied the Japanese the use of the King George VI Graving Dock between late 1944 and early 1945 , and the Admiralty IX Dry Dock from February 1945 . In addition , workers at the Naval Base did not return to work for some time after each raid , and had to be provided with better pay and rations and additional air @-@ raid shelters . Although the damage inflicted on the Empire Docks area impeded Japanese port operations , the poor condition of the port area also hindered British efforts to rehabilitate Singapore following the war . The attacks on the oil storage tanks on islands near Singapore were less successful , and many were found to still be operable after the Japanese surrender . 
 The Japanese military 's efforts to defend Singapore from air attack were unsuccessful . Due to the weak state of the island 's air defences , only nine B @-@ 29s were shot down during the American campaign , all of them during daylight raids . Minesweeping operations were also slow , and it took three weeks to declare the port safe after each Allied minelaying raid . The surviving crew members of the American bombers that were shot down met varying fates ; a small number linked up with resistance movements such as the Malayan Peoples ' Anti @-@ Japanese Army , while others were captured by the Japanese and held in harsh conditions . Those who were captured by the IJN and held at the Naval Base were beheaded . After the war , the Japanese personnel believed responsible for atrocities against these prisoners were tried during the Seletar War Crimes Trials and those found guilty were executed or served long prison sentences . 
 The air raids on Singapore raised the morale of the island 's civilian population . They were seen as heralding Singapore 's liberation from Japan 's oppressive rule , though civilians were generally careful to hide this belief from Japanese occupation personnel . The B @-@ 29s were widely believed to be invulnerable , and civilians were cheered by their apparent ability to attack the Japanese at will . In an attempt to counter this view , the occupation authorities exhibited wreckage from downed B @-@ 29s and surviving crew members as well as film footage of a Superfortress being shot down . This propaganda campaign was not successful . The Japanese also failed in their attempts to rouse Singapore 's Muslim population against the raids by highlighting damage suffered by a mosque on 11 January and 24 February , the latter a raid which coincided with the celebration of Muhammad 's birthday . Another factor which contributed to public support for the raids was that the policy of targeting military installations meant that only a limited number of civilians became casualties , and the American bombing came to be seen as highly accurate . The expectation of further attacks caused the prices of food and other commodities to rise , however , as people stockpiled necessities ; Japanese attempts to stop this hoarding and profiteering were not successful . 
 = Ralph de Luffa = 
 Ralph de Luffa ( or Ralph Luffa , and the first name is sometimes spelled Ralf ; died 1123 ) was an English bishop of Chichester , from 1091 to 1123 . He built extensively on his cathedral as well as being praised by contemporary writers as an exemplary bishop . He took little part in the Investiture Crisis which took place in England during his episcopate . Although at one point he refused to allow his diocese to be taxed by King Henry I of England , Luffa remained on good terms with the two kings of England he served . 
 = = Bishop = = 
 Luffa was consecrated on 6 January 1091 by Thomas , the Archbishop of York . He was consecrated at York as the See of Canterbury was vacant at the time . Luffa had previously been a chaplain for King William II of England , nicknamed " Rufus " , and was also the king 's friend . This information comes from the medieval writer Orderic Vitalis , but there is no other confirmation that he was a royal servant . He also served Rufus as a judge , and the historian Norman Cantor calls him a justiciar for Rufus , but the historian Francis West , who studied the justiciar 's office , notes that his one of appearance as a royal judge concerns his diocese , and that Luffa probably was mentioned only because he was expected to enforce the decision . 
 During the crisis between the king and Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury in 1095 and 1096 , Luffa managed to support Anselm while retaining the king 's respect . Under King Henry I , William 's younger brother and successor , Luffa took little part in the Investiture Crisis in England . In 1106 , Luffa did sign a letter to Anselm written by William Giffard Bishop of Winchester @-@ elect that begged the archbishop to return to England from his exile . 
 Luffa gained King Henry 's respect because Luffa was the lone bishop to resist Henry 's financial extortion from the clergy . As part of this dispute , Luffa ordered that all church services be discontinued and the church doors in his diocese be blocked with thorns . It was during Luffa 's tenure of the see that the first disputes between the bishop and Battle Abbey started , although they were not large . During Luffa 's episcopate , he and the abbey disputed over the right of the bishop to be entertained by the abbey and the requirement that the abbot attend the diocesan councils . The dispute only reached its climax during the episcopate of Hilary of Chichester , who was Bishop of Chichester from 1147 to 1169 . Luffa also supported Anselm 's attempts to assert Canterbury 's primacy over the Archbishop of York in 1108 and 1109 . 
 William of Malmesbury had high praise for Luffa 's actions as bishop , where he is said to have toured his diocese three times a year on preaching tours . He also allowed only freely given gifts from his flock , avoiding all appearance of extorting donations . He was also praised by contemporaries for his diligence is seeking worthy candidates for the priesthood . William of Malmesbury also praised Luffa 's piety . 
 = = Cathedral builder = = 
 Traditionally Luffa is held to have begun the building of Chichester Cathedral , the eastern section of which was dedicated in 1108 . However , this view has been challenged by the art historian R. D. H. Gem , who argues that because of the conservative nature of the architecture it was more probably begun under Luffa 's predecessor , Stigand , who was bishop from 1070 to 1087 , and who oversaw the transfer of the seat of the bishopric from Selsey to Chichester . Most historians still incline to the belief that Luffa began the cathedral construction , however . 
 After his cathedral church was burned down in 1114 , Luffa managed to secure King Henry I 's financial help in rebuilding the church . Besides the rebuilding , Luffa built a Lady Chapel , which still remains . Other work still extant in the cathedral are the arcades , the exteriors of the clerestory and those galleries that are unvaulted . The art historian George Zarnecki has argued that the rood screen in the cathedral also dates from Luffa 's episcopate . Two panels from this work still survive , and depict the meeting of Jesus with Mary and Martha at Bethany as well as the miracle where Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead . The scenes show some resemblance to works in Hildesheim and Cologne , and this resemblance may mean that Luffa was from Germany , or hired sculptors from there . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 On Luffa 's deathbed , he gave away all his belongings , including his sheets and underclothes . He died on 14 December 1123 . Contemporary records report that he had a great awareness of his responsibilities as a bishop . Six documents of Luffa 's survive , besides his profession of obedience . 
 = Elizabeth II 's jewels = 
 The monarch of the Commonwealth realms , Queen Elizabeth II , personally owns a historic collection of jewels . It is separate from the British Crown Jewels which are part of the Royal Collection held in trust by the Queen for her successors and the nation . 
 The origin of a distinct royal jewel collection is vague , though it is believed the jewels have their origin somewhere in the 16th century . Many of the pieces are from overseas and were brought to the United Kingdom as a result of civil war , coups and revolutions , or acquired as gifts to the monarch . Most of the jewellery dates from the 19th and 20th centuries . 
 The Crown Jewels are only worn at coronations ( St Edward 's Crown being used to crown the monarch ) and the annual State Opening of Parliament ( the Imperial State Crown ) . At other formal occasions , such as banquets , the Queen wears the jewellery in her private collection . Elizabeth owns more than 300 items of jewellery , including 98 brooches , 46 necklaces , 37 bracelets , 34 pairs of earrings , 15 rings , 14 watches and 5 pendants , the most notable of which are detailed in this article . 
 = = Value = = 
 It is not possible to say how much the collection is worth because the jewels have a rich and unique history , and they will never be sold on the open market . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = General history = = = 
 Unlike the Crown Jewels — which mainly date from the accession of Charles II — the jewels in the Queen 's personal collection are not official regalia or insignia and do not belong to the Crown . Much of the collection was designed for queens and queen consorts , though some kings have added to the collection . A few diamonds were brought to the United Kingdom from the British colonies and far away lands as the spoils of war . Most of the jewellery was purchased from other European heads of state and members of the aristocracy , or handed down by older generations of the Royal Family , often as birthday and wedding presents . In recent years , Elizabeth has worn them in her capacity as Queen of Australia , Canada and New Zealand , and can be seen wearing jewels from her collection in official portraits made specially for these realms . 
 = = = The House of Hanover dispute = = = 
 In 1714 , with the accession of George I , the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Hanover both came to be ruled in personal union by the House of Hanover . Early Hanoverian monarchs were careful to keep the heirlooms of the two realms separate . George III gave half the British heirlooms to his bride , Charlotte of Mecklenburg @-@ Strelitz , as a wedding present . In her will , Charlotte left the jewels to the ' House of Hanover ' . The Kingdom of Hanover followed the Salic Law , whereby the line of succession went through male heirs . Thus , when Queen Victoria acceded to the throne of the United Kingdom , her uncle Ernest Augustus , Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale became King of Hanover . King Ernest demanded a portion of the jewellery , not only as the monarch of Hanover but also as the son of Queen Charlotte . Victoria flatly declined to hand over any of the jewels , claiming they had been bought with British money . Ernest 's son , George V of Hanover , continued to press the claim . Victoria 's husband , Prince Albert , suggested that she make a financial settlement with the Hanoverian monarch to keep the jewels , but Parliament informed the Queen they would neither purchase the jewels nor loan funds for the purpose . A parliamentary commission was set up to investigate the matter and in 1857 they found in favour of the House of Hanover . On 28 January 1858 , 10 years after Ernest 's death , the jewels were handed to the Hanoverian Ambassador , Count <unk> . Victoria did manage to hang on to one of her favourite pieces of jewellery : a fine rope of pearls .

 = = = Delhi Durbar Tiara = = = 
 The Delhi Durbar Tiara was made by Garrard & Co. for Queen Mary , the wife of George V , to wear at the Delhi Durbar in 1911 . As British law prohibited the removal of the Crown Jewels from the country , George V wore a specially made crown ( the Imperial Crown of India ) to the Durbar , and his consort Queen Mary wore the tiara . It was part of a set of jewellery made for Queen Mary to use at the event which included a necklace , <unk> , brooch and earrings . Made of gold and platinum , the tiara is 8 cm ( 3 in ) tall and has the form of a tall circlet of lyres and S @-@ scrolls linked by festoons of diamonds . It was originally set with 10 of the Cambridge emeralds , acquired by Queen Mary in 1910 and first owned by her grandmother , the Duchess of Cambridge . In 1912 , the tiara was altered to take one or both of the Cullinan III and IV diamonds ; the pear @-@ shaped diamond was held at the top , and the cushion @-@ shaped stone hung in the oval aperture underneath . Mary lent the tiara to Queen Elizabeth ( later the Queen Mother ) for the 1947 royal tour of South Africa , and it remained with her until she died in 2002 , when it passed to Queen Elizabeth II . In 2005 , the Queen lent the tiara to her daughter @-@ in @-@ law , the Duchess of Cornwall . 
 = = = George III Fringe Tiara = = = 
 The George III Fringe Tiara is a circlet incorporating brilliant diamonds that were formerly owned by George III . Originally commissioned in 1830 , the tiara has been worn by many queens consort . Originally , it could be worn as a collar or necklace or mounted on a wire to form the tiara . Queen Victoria wore it as a tiara during a visit to the Royal Opera in 1839 . In Franz Xaver Winterhalter 's painting The First of May , completed in 1851 , Victoria can be seen wearing it as she holds Prince Arthur , the future Duke of Connaught and Strathearn . In a veiled reference to the adoration of the Magi , the Duke of Wellington is seen presenting the young prince with a gift . 
 = = = Queen Mary Fringe Tiara = = = 
 This tiara , which can also be worn as a necklace , was made for Queen Mary in 1919 . It is not , as has sometimes been claimed , made with diamonds that once belonged to George III , but reuses diamonds taken from a necklace / tiara purchased by Queen Victoria from Collingwood & Co. as a wedding present for Princess Mary in 1893 . In August 1936 , Mary gave the tiara to her daughter @-@ in @-@ law , Queen Elizabeth , later the Queen Mother . When the Queen Mother , consort of George VI , first wore the tiara , Sir Henry Channon called it " an ugly spiked tiara " . Later , she lent the piece to her daughter , Elizabeth , as " something borrowed " for her wedding to Prince Philip in 1947 . As Elizabeth was getting dressed at Buckingham Palace before leaving for Westminster Abbey , the tiara snapped . Luckily , the court jeweller was standing by in case of any emergency , and was rushed to his work room by a police escort . The Queen Mother reassured her daughter that it would be fixed in time , and it was . She also lent it to her granddaughter , Princess Anne , for her marriage to Captain Mark Phillips in 1973 . It was put on show at an exhibition with a number of other royal tiaras in 2001 . 
 = = = Grand Duchess Vladimir Tiara = = = 
 The Grand Duchess Vladimir Tiara ( ru : <unk> <unk> ) , sometimes the Diamond and Pearl Tiara , was bought , along with a diamond <unk> , by Queen Mary from Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia , mother of the Duchess of Kent , in 1921 for a price of £ 28 @,@ 000 . The duchess , known after her marriage as Princess Nicholas of Greece , inherited it from her mother , Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna , who received it as a wedding gift from her husband in 1874 . It originally had 15 large drop pearls , and was made by the jeweller Carl Edvard Bolin at a cost of 48 @,@ 200 rubles . 
 During the Russian Revolution in 1917 , the tiara was hidden with other jewels somewhere in Vladimir Palace in Petrograd , and later saved from Soviet Russia by Albert Stopford , a British art dealer and secret agent . In the years to follow , Princess Nicholas sold pieces of jewellery from her collection to support her exiled family and various charities . 
 Queen Mary had the tiara altered to accommodate 15 of the Cambridge cabochon emeralds . The original drop pearls can easily be replaced as an alternative to the emeralds . Queen Elizabeth II inherited the tiara directly from her grandmother in 1953 . It is almost exclusively worn together with the Cambridge and Delhi Durbar <unk> , also containing large emeralds . Elizabeth wore the tiara in her official portrait as Queen of Canada as none of the Commonwealth realms besides the United Kingdom have their own crown jewels . 
 = = = Burmese Ruby Tiara = = = 
 Elizabeth ordered the Burmese Ruby Tiara in 1973 , and it was made by Garrard & Co. using stones from her private collection . It is designed in the form of a wreath of roses , with silver and diamonds making the petals , and clusters of gold and rubies forming the centre of the flowers . A total of 96 rubies are mounted on the tiara ; they were originally part of a necklace given to her in 1947 as a wedding present by the people of Burma ( now Myanmar ) , who credited them with having the ability to protect their owner from sickness and evil . The diamonds were also given to her as a wedding present , by the Nizam of Hyderabad and Berar , who possessed a vast jewellery collection of his own .

 The Queen 's first tiara was a wedding present in 1947 from her grandmother , Queen Mary , who received it as a gift from the Girls of Great Britain and Ireland in 1893 on the occasion of her marriage to the Duke of York , later George V. Made by E. Wolfe & Co . , it was purchased from Garrard & Co. by a committee organised by Lady Eve Greville . In 1914 , Mary adapted the tiara to take 13 diamonds in place of the large oriental pearls surmounting the tiara . Leslie Field , author of The Queen 's Jewels , described it as , " a festoon @-@ and @-@ scroll with nine large oriental pearls on diamond spikes and set on a base of alternate round and lozenge <unk> between two plain bands of diamonds " . At first , Elizabeth wore the tiara without its base and pearls but the base was reattached in 1969 . The Girls of Great Britain and Ireland Tiara is one of Elizabeth 's most recognisable pieces of jewellery due to its widespread use on English banknotes and coinage .

Queen Caroline , on the other hand , had a great deal of valuable jewellery , including no fewer than four pearl necklaces . She wore all the pearl necklaces to her coronation in 1727 , but afterwards had the 50 best pearls selected to make one large necklace . In 1947 , both necklaces were given to Elizabeth by her father as a wedding present . On her wedding day , Elizabeth realised that she had left her pearls at St James 's Palace . Her private secretary , Jock Colville , was asked to go and retrieve them . He commandeered the limousine of King Haakon VII of Norway , but traffic that morning had stopped , so even the king 's car with its royal flag flying could not get anywhere . Colville completed his journey on foot , and when he arrived at St James 's Palace , he had to explain the odd story to the guards who were protecting Elizabeth 's 2 @,@ 660 wedding presents .

 The Brazil <unk> is one of the newest items of jewellery in the collection . In 1953 , the president and people of Brazil presented Elizabeth II with the coronation gift of a necklace and matching pendant earrings of aquamarines and diamonds . It had taken the jewellers Mappin & Webb an entire year to collect the perfectly matched stones . The necklace has nine large oblong aquamarines with an even bigger aquamarine pendant drop . The Queen had the drop set in a more decorative diamond cluster and it is now detachable . She was so delighted with the gift that in 1957 she had a tiara made to match the necklace . The tiara is surmounted by three vertically set aquamarines . Seeing that the Queen had so liked the original Coronation gift that she had a matching tiara made , the Government of Brazil decided to add to its gift , and in 1958 it presented Elizabeth II with a bracelet of oblong aquamarines set in a cluster of diamonds , and a square aquamarine and diamond brooch . 
 = = = George VI Victorian Suite = = = 
 The George VI Victorian Suite was originally a wedding present by George VI to his daughter Elizabeth in 1947 . The suite consists of a long necklace of oblong sapphires and diamonds and a pair of matching square sapphire earrings also bordered with diamonds . The suite was originally made in 1850 . The stones exactly matched the colour of the robes of the Order of the Garter , although this may have been a coincidence on George 's part . Elizabeth had the necklace shortened by removing the biggest sapphire in 1952 , and later had a new pendant made using the removed stone . In 1963 , a new sapphire and diamond tiara and bracelet were made to match the original pieces . The tiara is made out of a necklace that had belonged to Princess Louise of Belgium , daughter of Leopold II . In 1969 , the Queen wore the complete <unk> to a charity concert . 
 = = 1937 coronets = = 
 For the coronation of their parents in 1937 , it was decided that Elizabeth and Margaret should be given small versions of crowns to wear at the ceremony . Ornate coronets of gold lined with crimson and edged with ermine were designed by Garrard & Co. and brought to the royal couple for inspection . However , the king and queen decided they were inappropriately elaborate and too heavy for the young princesses . Queen Mary suggested the coronets be silver @-@ gilt in a medieval style with no decorations . George VI agreed , and the coronets were designed with Maltese crosses and fleurs @-@ de @-@ lis . After the coronation , Mary wrote : " I sat between Maud and Lilibet ( Elizabeth ) , and Margaret came next . They looked too sweet in their lace dresses and robes , especially when they put on their coronets " . Both coronets are thought to be in the Queen 's private collection . 
 = Hurricane Michael ( 2000 ) = 
 Hurricane Michael of the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season caused moderate damage in Atlantic Canada . The seventeenth tropical cyclone , thirteenth named storm , and eighth hurricane of the season , Michael developed from a non @-@ tropical system to the southwest of Bermuda on October 15 . The system was initially subtropical , but rapidly acquired tropical characteristics by October 17 . Michael quickly strengthened into a hurricane later that day . By October 20 , Michael peaked as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane wind scale at a relatively high altitude of 44 ° N. The storm weakened slightly to a Category 1 hurricane and became extratropical shortly before making landfall in Newfoundland on October 20 . 
 As the intensity of Michael was equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane during landfall , high winds were reported throughout Atlantic Canada , especially in Newfoundland . Winds from the storm peaked at 172 km / h ( 107 mph ) in St. Lawrence , Newfoundland ; other locations across the island reported winds of 128 to 150 km / h ( 80 to 93 mph ) . High winds caused minor structure damage across Newfoundland , confined to vinyl siding peeled off , shattered windows , and unroofed houses . In addition , sporadic power outages were also reported from Corner Brook to St. John 's . Michael also dropped rainfall across Atlantic Canada and in Maine . The rainfall was generally light , with much of the region reporting between 25 to 51 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 to 2 @.@ 01 in ) of precipitation . Michael also produced high tides , accompanied by waves reported as high as 16 @.@ 9 m ( 55 ft ) by a buoy well offshore of Newfoundland . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The system originated out of a non @-@ tropical cold @-@ core upper level low that drifted southward into the subtropics . The low interacted with a cold front , which resulted in the development of a stationary front over the Bahamas on October 10 . As the cold low drifted southward , a surface low developed on October 12 . The surface low remained mostly stationary until early on October 15 as it merged with the upper @-@ level low and deepened while north of the Bahamas and east of the coast of Florida . Later that day , the system gained enough tropical characteristics and became organized enough to be classified as a subtropical depression . The storm remained stationary over warm water , with sea surface temperatures around 28 ° C ( 82 ° F ) , while it continued to gain additional tropical characteristics . Around 0000 UTC on October 16 , it strengthened into a subtropical storm after satellite classifications showed a stronger storm . Later that day , the cyclone continued to develop as more thunderstorms formed and persisted near the low @-@ level circulation . 
 By 0000 UTC on October 17 , the transition was completed and Michael was reclassified as a tropical storm as supported by satellite classifications via the Dvorak technique . Shortly thereafter , the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Seventeen ; post @-@ analysis later discovered it was actually a tropical storm . A well @-@ defined eye quickly developed early on October 17 as Michael began to strengthen and continued to organize . That afternoon , Michael rapidly intensified further and was upgraded to a hurricane as Reconnaissance flights found winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . At that point , Michael began to move northward . While Michael was maintaining minimal hurricane status , the eye remained ragged , yet well @-@ defined . Early on October 19 , Michael briefly strengthened to 135 km / h ( 85 mph ) before weakening slightly six hours later . Tracking into cooler water , Michael began its extratropical transition while accelerating to the northeast towards Newfoundland , which prevented significant weakening . The acceleration was caused by a shortwave trough embedded within strong southwesterly mid @-@ level flow . 
 Unexpectedly , Michael began to rapidly intensify on October 19 while in extratropical transition . Later that day , a ship report in the eastern eyewall reported a minimum central pressure of 965 mbar ( 28 @.@ 5 inHg ) and maximum sustained winds of 160 km / h ( 100 mph ) , making Michael a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane scale . The sudden intensification was determined to have been as a result of baroclinic effects as it interacted with an incoming trough , which provided additional energy to counter the general weakening of hurricanes while in the high latitudes over sea @-@ surface temperatures around 16 ° C ( 61 ° F ) . Michael formed a " hybrid " system combining influences of a hurricane with that of a powerful extratropical cyclone . Shortly before 0000 UTC on October 20 , Michael made landfall near Harbour Breton , Newfoundland with winds of 135 km / h ( 85 mph ) . Either simultaneously or shortly thereafter , Michael transitioned into an extratropical storm . The extratropical system gradually weakened as it tracked across Newfoundland on October 20 , and slowed down considerably with the presence of the trough . The storm was absorbed by another extratropical low just north of Newfoundland that afternoon . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Because it was unknown that Michael became extratropical before landfall , it was the initially considered the first tropical cyclone to strike Newfoundland since Hurricane Luis in 1995 . Furthermore , Michael was also considered the first hurricane to make landfall in Canada since Hurricane Hortense in 1996 . When the Meteorological Service of Canada and the National Research Council flew a Convair research flight into Michael on October 19 , it was the first successful research flight made into a tropical cyclone by those agencies . Subsequent flights have been made into Tropical Storm Karen , Hurricane Isabel ( while inland ) , Hurricane Juan , and Hurricane Ophelia . 
 = = = Newfoundland = = = 
 In advance of the storm , the Newfoundland Weather Centre posted wind warnings , gale warnings , storm warnings , and hurricane warnings throughout Newfoundland . Rainfall advisories were also issued in portions of the East Coast , Central Newfoundland , the South Coast , and the West Coast . Offshore , storm force wind warnings were declared on October 19 for Newfoundland waters . Several Special Weather Statements were also posted . 
 Light to moderate damage was reported throughout Newfoundland , primarily as a result of the strong winds . The entire region was affected by Michael , though the majority of the damage was confined to small communities east of where the storm made landfall , including <unk> , Harbour Breton , Hermitage and English Harbour West . These areas reported significant power outages and minor structural damage ; vinyl siding was peeled off , windows were shattered , and roof shingles were torn off in some localized locations . The most severe damage was in <unk> , where several roofs were torn off and trees were uprooted . Wind damage also occurred in the St. John 's Metropolitan Area , where a <unk> store in Conception Bay South had broken windows . Sporadic power outages were reported throughout the island , as far east as St. John ’ s , and as far west as Corner Brook . As the storm struck at low tide , storm surge was insignificant . However , just prior to landfall , waves on the coast of Newfoundland reached heights of 7 – 8 m ( 23 – 26 ft ) . Rainfall near the storm 's track was generally around 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) , though further inland , precipitation reached 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) . Rainfall from the hurricane amounted to 77 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) at <unk> , a small fishing community on the Great Northern Peninsula . Wind gusts peaked at 172 km / h ( 107 mph ) at St. Lawrence , with other reports varying between 128 km / h ( 80 mph ) and 150 km / h ( 93 mph ) . Despite severe winds , damage was relatively light due to high construction standards in Newfoundland , where winter storms routinely result in hurricane @-@ force winds , as well as the sparse population of the area affected . 
 The tug Atlantic Elm lost its tow to the unmanned barge Portland Star on October 19 . The barge was carrying over 18 @,@ 000 tonnes of cement and diesel fuel and was later reported to have sunk in the Fortune Bay . Damage was reported to numerous pleasure craft around the bay due to the waves ; two sailboats were toppled . Also , ferry service between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia was disrupted . Several offshore buoys and ships reported high winds and low barometric pressure , as well as waves of up to 16 @.@ 9 m ( 55 ft ) . 
 = = = Elsewhere = = = 
 On October 14 and October 15 , the frontal boundary associated with the hurricane 's precursor dropped heavy rainfall on Bermuda , amounting to 76 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) . However , as a tropical cyclone , Michael remained far from the island . Impact outside Newfoundland was generally light . However , rainfall was greater in some areas of Nova Scotia than in Newfoundland , where precipitation reached 95 @.@ 7 mm ( 3 @.@ 77 in ) over North Mountain . Light rain was also reported in New Brunswick , Prince Edward Island , and Quebec . Effects from the storm in the United States were minimal , limited to light rainfall in the state of Maine which totaled less than 51 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) . 
 = Sir Thursday = 
 Sir Thursday is a young adult fantasy novel written by Australian author Garth Nix . It is the fourth book in The Keys to the Kingdom series , and was released in March 2006 . Sir Thursday continues from the preceding book , following the adventures of Arthur Penhaligon as he attempts to retrieve the Fourth key of the Kingdom , and claim mastership of The Great Maze . As with the other books in the series , the theme of ' seven ' is prevalent , along with the themes of sin and virtue . The book received generally favourable critical response , but was criticised for a slow pace , among other issues . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 The book begins with Arthur Penhaligon and Leaf attempting to return to Earth after their adventures in the Border Sea . While Leaf is able to pass through the front door and return to Earth , the presence of a Nithling duplicate of Arthur prevents him from doing so , and he is forced to remain in the Lower House . 
 Dame Primus then informs him that Mister Monday and Grim Tuesday have been assassinated . Moments later , he is drafted into the Glorious Army of the Architect – wherein everyone living in the House must serve for 100 years – which is based in the chessboard @-@ like demesne called the Great Maze . The leader of the army is the Fourth Trustee of the Will , Sir Thursday , a Denizen afflicted with the deadly sin of wrath . The army is currently involved in a campaign against the Piper , who is trying to claim the Fourth Key . 
 Within the army , Arthur is soon mistaken for a Piper 's child and has his memory wiped , along with his friend Fred Initials Numbers Gold – a real Piper 's child . One month later and during the first battle against the Piper 's New Nithling army , Arthur begins to recall his identity . The entirety of it is recovered later in the book when an officer mentions his name and title . 
 On Earth , Arthur 's double , known as the Skinless Boy , has thrown a hospital near Arthur 's home into panic by infecting staff and patients with a fungoid , extraterrestrial life @-@ form which allows him to read and eventually control their thoughts and actions . This fungus , nicknamed Grayspot , is mistaken for a biological weapon , and the hospital put under quarantine . Leaf infiltrates the hospital , seeking to obtain and destroy the magical object used to create the Skinless Boy : a pocket torn from one of Arthur 's shirts . She succeeds , but is infected by Grayspot in the process . She then leaves the hospital , only to find that the House has appeared above it and cannot be reached from the ground . With the help of a retired pharmacist named Sylvie , Leaf makes her way to Arthur 's house where she uses a special telephone to contact Arthur 's friends and get help , just as the fungus gains full control of her body . 
 Suzy Turquoise Blue arrives and takes the pocket to the House . There , she finds Arthur and Fred , and joins them in a raid led by Sir Thursday to find and destroy the New <unk> ' weapon , which is preventing the mechanical floor of the Great Maze from shifting . Arthur destroys the weapon by throwing the pocket into it , simultaneously destroying the Skinless Boy . As Arthur escapes from the Piper with Sir Thursday , he distracts Thursday enough for the fourth part of the Will , a snake embodying the virtue of justice , to break free , whereupon it makes Arthur the Bearer of the Fourth Key – a sword or baton depending on whether or not the wielder is in combat – and Commander of the Glorious Army of the Architect . With help from Dame Primus and others from the lower demesnes , Arthur defeats the New Nithling army . 
 On Earth , Leaf wakes up in a hospital a week after the Skinless Boy was defeated . She soon learns from a nurse that the Grayspot has disappeared and that Lady Friday , another Trustee , has become a doctor on Earth .

 The Piper – The Piper , one of the children of the Architect and the Old One , claims to be the Rightful Heir , and lays siege to the Citadel in the Great Maze to wrest the key from Sir Thursday . 
 = = Themes = = 
 As with the previous books in the series , the themes of seven , sin and virtue are prevalent throughout Sir Thursday providing the personality characteristics for many of the main characters . 
 In Sir Thursday , readers are also introduced to the power issues that Arthur begins to struggle with – his natural compassion and desire for fairness and kindness , against the characteristics displayed by other senior denizens and Dame Primus , and the influence of the key . In addition , the idea of Arthur losing his mortality and becoming an immortal Denizen of the House , represented by the silver / gold crocodile ring that was introduced in Drowned Wednesday , is further explored , with Arthur often choosing to refrain from using the key – and the power it represents – to ensure he remains human . 
 The book also loosely explores the dangers of anger , and actions taken in anger . It is only Sir Thursday 's loss of control and subsequent murder of two Piper 's Children that allows Arthur to gain control of the Fourth Key , assisted by Thursday 's Dawn , Noon and Dusk .

The most common complaint was on the speed of the plot – the School Library Journal summarises all the comments , saying that " the events move a little slower than in previous installments ... " – and the difficulty in entering the series without reading all the previous books first : VOYA simply says " readers attempting to enter the series through this volume are likely to be quickly lost . " Children 's Literature also criticised the repetition of previous content , saying there is " .. entirely too much front matter [ which ] sags with the necessity of replaying earlier story lines .

 Symphonic Fantasies : Music from Square Enix was an award @-@ winning symphonic tribute concert held in Cologne , Germany on September 12 , 2009 at the Cologne Philharmonic Hall featuring video game music from Japanese game developer Square Enix . The concert featured symphonic movements based on the Kingdom Hearts series , Secret of Mana , the Chrono series , and the Final Fantasy series . The concert was produced and directed by Thomas Böcker , with arrangements provided by Finnish composer and musician Jonne Valtonen with assistance by Roger Wanamo . Due to overwhelming demand , a second concert was necessitated at the König @-@ Pilsener @-@ Arena in Oberhausen , on September 11 , 2009 . The concert was performed by the WDR Radio Orchestra Cologne and the WDR Radio Choir Cologne under conduction from Arnie Roth , with guest performers Rony Barrak and Benyamin Nuss joining the orchestra . Symphonic Fantasies was broadcast over radio on the <unk> station and streamed live video online . 
 In 2012 , four new performances were scheduled , taking stage in Tokyo , Stockholm , and a reprise in Cologne . These performances featured slightly modified versions of the original arrangements , and like the original concerts , were sold out . The original concert and the Tokyo concert both sparked the release of an album . These albums , along with the concerts themselves , were heavily praised , both for the quality of the performance and for the quality of Valtonen 's arrangements , which overlaid themes from multiple pieces rather than relying on a traditional medley .

 Thomas Böcker and then WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne director Winfried Fechner began collaborating on orchestrated video game concerts in 2007 , after Fechner had attended the Fifth Symphonic Game Music Concert held in Leipzig . As their ideas and plans materialized , three projects were set in motion to determine the interest of a younger audience in classical music performance and the aptitude of the WDR orchestra in focusing on a new source of compositions . The first project was <unk> : That 's Sound , That 's Rhythm , held in early 2008 , featuring a mixture of classical works and video game music , ranging from works by Ralph Vaughan Williams and Morton Gould as well as arrangements of music from video games such as Shenmue and Castlevania previously featured in the Symphonic Game Music Concerts . The second project , held in August 2008 , was a composer specific concert titled Symphonic Shades - Hülsbeck in Concert , focusing entirely on the works of German video game composer Chris Hülsbeck . After the concert , Fechner revealed in an interview the existence of the third project , saying that he and Böcker would be involved in another concert of video game music the following September . The third project was to be a concert of music from one game company , focusing on multiple titles released by the same developer . This company was later confirmed to be Square Enix when Fechner announced Symphonic Fantasies as a video game music concert to take place on September 12 , 2009 . A website was set up for announcements , interviews and other concert information . 
 Böcker later explained that the decision to focus on Square Enix was made due to the large library of games to choose from , all of which he felt had a distinct sound , and many of which were very well known in Germany . An emphasis was put on balancing out the concert program and the arrangements , so that the music would appeal to first @-@ time listeners , classical music fans , and longtime gamers . The titles chosen to be featured in the concert were Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II from the Kingdom Hearts series , Secret of Mana , Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross from the Chrono series , and the Final Fantasy series . In order to select the pieces presented , the original composers were consulted to assemble a list of their personal favorites . The composers were Yoko Shimomura for the music of Kingdom Hearts , Hiroki Kikuta for the music of Secret of Mana , Yasunori Mitsuda for the music of Chrono Trigger and Cross , and Nobuo Uematsu for the music of the Final Fantasy series . 
 For the concert , Jonne Valtonen returned as the lead arranger ; he had previously been the arranger for video game music concerts since 2005 , including Symphonic Shades . He was given complete freedom to arrange the music based on the general outline given to him by Böcker . Valtonen spent six months on the arrangements , during which Valtonen studied each song and referred to the composer 's original intended expression . No Japanese guest arrangers were used for this concert in order to maintain a unique European take on the source material , but Valtonen brought in former classmate and close friend Roger Wanamo to assist on the arrangement of the music from the Chrono games . This was Wanamo 's first time arranging video game music . On March 9 , 2009 It was also announced that Valtonen had additionally been commissioned to compose an original fanfare to be played at the start of the concert , and with a video preview of his composition was released . 
 The arrangements in the concert were structured as suites , dubbed " Fantasies " , with multiple songs from each game series positioned and arranged together to tell melodic stories rather than using the conventional medley structure more commonly heard in video game music arrangements . The fanfare , titled Fanfare Overture , was done in a style of traditional fanfares with some accentuated textures in order to introduce all the elements of the orchestra . The Kingdom Hearts suite featured seven songs from the two titles , and was arranged as a romantic piano concerto . Secret of Mana featured six songs featured in the original game . The arrangement made use of notable unique techniques in order to replicate the atmosphere found in the original game ; for example , the choir was used to create " sound effects " such as floor vibration by foot stomping and simulating distant rain with their voices . The Chrono suite featured ten songs from Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross . The suite featured a " crossing " of melodies , in which multiple melodies would be layered on top of one another , resulting in different well @-@ known themes performed simultaneously in harmony . The Final Fantasy suite contained eight songs from the first seven titles in the series . Unlike the other suites , it featured a simpler structure , focusing more on each individual theme rather than overlapping multiple pieces . This was due to a request by Uematsu that the arrangement remain similar to those of prior Final Fantasy concerts . 
 = = = Original performance = = = 
 The orchestra received about two weeks of rehearsal time prior to their performances , more than any other game concert before . The concert was originally scheduled to be performed on September 12 , 2009 in the Cologne Philharmonic Hall in Cologne , but once the tickets were sold out , a second performance was added for September 11 , 2009 at the König Pilsener Arena in Oberhausen . Ticket sales for the initial concert began on January 17 , and half of them were sold within a week , with the remainder sold by April 2 , 2009 . The concert was preceded by a Meet and Greet session that included the original composers as well as the arrangement team and guest artists for the show . The concerts were performed by the WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne and WDR Radio Choir Cologne , conducted by Arnie Roth . 
 Before each suite , the moderator would introduce the upcoming musical piece , as well as introduce the composer in attendance . Each " Fantasy " lasted for more than 15 minutes each . The Kingdom Hearts suite featured solo pianist Benyamin Nuss . For the Chrono suite , Rony Barrak joined the orchestra and performed on his signature darbuka . A surprise encore was performed after the final suite , which took the form of a medley of the final boss themes from each game . Rony Barrak returned on stage as a soloist for the encore . No video screens or other form of tools were used during the concert , with only minimal lighting effects at certain parts for atmosphere being employed . The event was broadcast live on the <unk> radio station , as well as through an online video stream , enabling a worldwide audience to watch the concert .

 Three years after the original performance , on September 14 , 2011 , during the Tokyo Game Show , Square Enix Japan announced on their website that the Symphonic Fantasies concert would be performed in Tokyo on January 7 and 8 , 2012 . They also announced that Benyamin Nuss , Rony Barrak , Jonne Valtonen , Roger Wanamo and Thomas Böcker would be in attendance . Böcker returned to produce the event , and Nuss and Barrak returned as soloists . 
 The concerts were held at the Tokyo Bunka Kaikan Main Hall , and were performed by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra and the Tokyo Philharmonic Chorus . The concerts were conducted by Eckehard Stier . In addition to the originally announced attendees , in attendance were guest of honors Hiroki Kikuta , Yoko Shimomura , and Yasunori Mitsuda , as well as guests such as video game composers <unk> <unk> , Yuzo Koshiro , Masashi Hamauzu , and Mahito Yokota . The concerts were featured extensively in the February issue of Famitsu as well as on their official website . Symphonic Fantasies Tokyo was the first all @-@ European video game concert production to take place in Japan . More than 4600 fans were in attendance , and the concerts sold out within days . The arrangements and tempo were slightly modified from the original concert , and the encore was changed by Wanamo to add elements from an additional Final Fantasy song . 
 At the conclusion of the Symphonic Odysseys concert in Cologne by Merregnon Studios on July 9 , 2011 , the WDR announced that Symphonic Fantasies would return to Germany in 2012 . The concerts were held on July 6 and 7 , 2012 at the Cologne Philharmonic Hall . The concert was again performed by the WDR Radio Orchestra Cologne and WDR Radio Choir Cologne , conducted by Niklas <unk> . On March 26 , 2012 , Merregnon Studios announced that Symphonic Fantasies would also be performed at the Stockholm Concert Hall on June 9 , 2012 . The concert was performed by Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra and Katarina Choir , conducted by Andreas Hanson . Like the other concerts , the 2012 European concerts were sold out . Four years later , on October 6 , 2016 , the Symphonic Fantasies concert will be performed in London at the Barbican Centre by the London Symphony Orchestra and London Symphony Chorus .

 The September 12 , 2009 concert in Cologne was recorded and released as an album titled Symphonic Fantasies . It was announced to be in production on April 15 , 2010 , and made available for pre @-@ order . In an interview , Fechner stated the album was being mixed and edited at a " prestigious European studio " . This was later revealed to be Abbey Road Studios in London . The album was first released in Japan on September 15 , 2010 , published by Square Enix Japan 's own label under the auspices of Sony Music Distribution . The album was released in Europe on September 17 , 2010 , published by Decca Records . Both album versions feature identical track listings and production , with the only differences being the artwork and provided booklet . The artwork for the European album was designed by the German design house , <unk> , and features a cross between a violin and a game controller , while the Japanese cover has an image of a white book . Böcker produced the European album , and was a consultant for the production of the Japanese release . 
 The album does not contain the encore suite , which was released as a single on iTunes on December 14 , 2010 . The album 's five tracks have a duration of 1 : 12 : 30 , with the encore track bringing it to 1 : 20 : 56 . Upon release , it reach position # 13 on the German classical Media Control Charts for sales in September 2010 . The Japanese release reached position # 102 on the Oricon charts and stayed on the charts for one week . After the concert in Tokyo , a second album was released . Titled Symphonic Fantasies Tokyo , the two @-@ disc album is a recording of that performance , including the encore . The album , produced by Merregnon Studios and mixed by a team of sound engineers from Japan and Germany , was released on June 11 , 2012 . Its cover is a modified version of the original European album with a large red circle , and it includes a twenty @-@ page booklet with comments from the original composers . The album 's six tracks have a length of 1 : 20 : 50 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The initial event received widespread critical acclaim , with much praise given to the focused presentation , deeply developed arrangements and evolution of the concept . Audun Sorlie of Original Sound Version stated that the concert " exceeded all expectations " and further added that the event was " absolutely amazing " . Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online concluded in his report that " Symphonic Fantasies ranks among the greatest musical and social experiences of my life . Each arrangement took listeners on an extended journey through the atmospheres , emotions , and melodies of their respective series . " Polish site <unk> 's Kamil Rojek said in his report that " Symphonic Fantasies is a significant turning point in the history of video game music concerts . It was a remarkable event that made great progress in breaking the boundaries between game music and traditional classical works . " 
 The composers themselves expressed great regard for the concert and the arrangement . Yoko Shimomura noted she was extremely pleased with Valtonen 's arrangement of Kingdom Hearts , feeling it " very colorful and beautiful , just superb really " . Hiroki Kikuta stated that Valtonen 's arrangement " defied the framework of regular orchestra and was a very experimental attempt , " resulting in " free and unbound expression " . Yasunori Mitsuda expressed that he was " really amazed by its fantastic quality " , and Nobuo Uematsu said that it was " an exceptionally well @-@ produced concert compared to most game concerts . " Uematsu was very taken with the unique arrangements of the other sections of the concert , especially the Mana portion , that he asked Böcker to take more liberties with the source material if the opportunity arose in the future ; this led to the creation of the Final Symphony concert in 2013 . The composers also voiced their desire to bring the concert to Japan . 
 The Symphonic Fantasies album garnered universal praise upon its release . Patrick Gann of RPGFan said that it was " the best game music arranged album of 2010 . It may be the best in years , with the only things rivaling it being other recordings from the WDR . " Audun Sorlie of Original Sound Version called it " the best symphonic game arrangement CD you can get your hands on , " and further added " for every game music fan out there , especially the ones with a taste for Square Enix , this is the definitive pick for you . " Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online gave the album the score of 10 out of 10 , and stated that it " offers a definitive tribute to Square Enix " and " certainly deserves a perfect score and an unconditional recommendation . " Benjamin Schmädig of the German site <unk> said of the album " Symphonic Fantasies represents memories of great emotional moments . The orchestra and choir put in all their strength , all their subtlety in these moments . " He further complimented Jonne Valtonen , saying that he " knows exactly how to arrange the known motifs in such an imaginative way that they tell the familiar stories from scratch . " Denis Brown of the German site <unk> said that for Square Enix fans , it is an obligatory purchase . 
 Symphonic Fantasies Tokyo was also praised upon release . Jayson Napolitano of Destructoid said that the " arrangements are brilliant and are some of the best in the business , " and that the addition of the encore was an improvement over the physical version of the original album , though he felt that the sound quality " lacks some of the dynamics of the original release " in the bass regions . Joe Hammond of Square Enix Music Online found the opposite difference in the sound quality , finding that the deep drum sounds had more impact than in the first album . Stephen Meyerink of RPGFan felt that " the production and mastering on the album is stellar " , and was pleased by the modifications to the arrangements between the original concert and the Tokyo concert , especially the slight increase in tempo . Audun Sorlie of Original Sound Version also praised the changes , not only in the tempo but also in the arrangements , noting the more integrated piano in the Kingdom Hearts suite and the more impressive brass section in the opening fanfare . He also noted that , unlike the original performance and album , the recording of live audience did not include any laughter when the chocobo theme interrupted " One Winged Angel " in the Final Fantasy suite . He concluded that the album was worth purchasing even for owners of the first album . 
 = 11th Airborne Division ( United States ) = 
 The 11th Airborne Division ( " Angels " ) was a United States Army airborne formation , first activated on 25 February 1943 , during World War II . Consisting of one parachute and two glider infantry regiments , with supporting troops , the division underwent rigorous training throughout 1943 . It played a vital role in the successful Knollwood Maneuver , which was organized to determine the viability of large @-@ scale American airborne formations after their utility had been called into question following a disappointing performance during the Allied invasion of Sicily . 
 Held in reserve in the United States for the first half of 1944 , in June the division was transferred to the Pacific Theater of Operations . Upon arrival it entered a period of intense training and acclimatization , and by November was judged combat @-@ ready . The 11th Airborne saw its first action on the island of Leyte in the Philippines , but in a traditional infantry role . In January 1945 the division took part in the invasion of Luzon . The two glider infantry regiments again operated as conventional infantry , securing a beachhead before fighting their way inland . The parachute infantry regiment was held in reserve for several days before conducting the division 's first airborne operation , a combat drop on the Tagaytay Ridge . Reunited , the division participated in the Liberation of Manila , and two companies of divisional paratroopers conducted an audacious raid on the Los Baños internment camp , liberating two thousand civilians . The 11th Airborne 's last combat operation of World War II was in the north of Luzon around Aparri , in aid of combined American and Philippine forces who were battling to subdue the remaining Japanese resistance on the island . 
 On 30 August 1945 the division was sent to southern Japan as part of the occupation force . Four years later it was recalled to the United States , where it became a training formation . One parachute infantry regiment was detached for service in the Korean War , but on 30 June 1958 the division was inactivated . It was briefly reactivated on 1 February 1963 as the 11th Air Assault Division ( Test ) to explore the theory and practicality of helicopter assault tactics , and was inactivated on 29 June 1965 . The division 's personnel and equipment were transferred to the newly raised 1st Cavalry Division ( Airmobile ) .

 = = = Formation = = = 
 Inspired by the pioneering German use of large @-@ scale airborne formations during the Battle of France in 1940 and later the invasion of Crete in 1941 , the various Allied powers decided to raise airborne units of their own . One of the resultant five American and two British airborne divisions , the 11th Airborne Division , was officially activated on 25 February 1943 at Camp Mackall in North Carolina , under the command of Major General Joseph Swing . As formed the division consisted of the 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment , the 187th Glider Infantry Regiment and the 188th Glider Infantry Regiment , and with a complement of 8 @,@ 321 men was around half the strength of a regular U.S. infantry division of World War II . 
 The division initially remained in the United States for training , which in common with all airborne units was extremely arduous to befit their elite status . Training included lengthy forced marches , simulated parachute landings from 34 @-@ foot ( 10 m ) and 250 @-@ foot ( 76 m ) towers , and practice jumps from transport aircraft ; hesitancy in the doorway of an aircraft resulted in an automatic failure for the candidate . The washout rate was high , but there was never a shortage of candidates , especially because in American airborne units the rate of pay was much higher than that of an ordinary infantryman . 
 Before training was complete a debate developed in the U.S. Army over whether the best use of airborne forces was en masse or as small , compact units . On 9 July 1943 , the first large @-@ scale Allied airborne operation was carried out by elements of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division and the British 1st Airborne Division in support of the Allied invasion of Sicily , code @-@ named Operation Husky . The 11th Airborne Division 's commanding general , Major General Swing , was temporarily transferred to act as airborne advisor to General Dwight D. Eisenhower for the operation , and observed the airborne assault which went badly . The 82nd Airborne Division had been inserted by parachute and glider and had suffered high casualties , leading to a perception that it had failed to achieve many of its objectives . 
 = = = Swing Board = = = 
 Eisenhower reviewed the airborne role in Operation Husky and concluded that large @-@ scale formations were too difficult to control in combat to be practical . Lieutenant General Leslie J. McNair , the overall commander of Army Ground Forces , had similar misgivings : once an airborne supporter , he had been greatly disappointed by the performance of airborne units in North Africa and more recently Sicily . However , other high @-@ ranking officers , including the Army Chief of Staff George Marshall , believed otherwise . Marshall persuaded Eisenhower to set up a review board and to withhold judgement until the outcome of a large @-@ scale maneuver , planned for December 1943 , could be assessed . 
 When Swing returned to the United States to resume command of the 11th Airborne in mid @-@ September 1943 , he was given the role of preparing the exercise . McNair ordered him to form a committee — the Swing Board — composed of air force , parachute , glider infantry , and artillery officers , whose arrangements for the maneuver would effectively decide the fate of divisional @-@ sized airborne forces . As the 11th Airborne Division was in reserve in the United States and had not yet been earmarked for combat , the Swing Board selected it as the test formation . The maneuver would additionally provide the 11th Airborne and its individual units with further training , as had occurred several months previously in an earlier large @-@ scale exercise conducted by the 101st and the 82nd Airborne Divisions . 
 = = = = Knollwood Maneuver = = = = 
 The 11th Airborne , as the attacking force , was assigned the objective of capturing Knollwood Army Auxiliary Airfield near Fort Bragg in North Carolina . The force defending the airfield and its environs was a combat team composed of elements of the 17th Airborne Division and a battalion from the 541st Parachute Infantry Regiment . The entire operation was observed by Army Ground Forces commander Lt. Gen. McNair , who would ultimately have a significant say in deciding the fate of the parachute infantry divisions . 
 The Knollwood Maneuver took place on the night of 7 December 1943 , with the 11th Airborne Division being airlifted to thirteen separate objectives by 200 C @-@ 47 Skytrain transport aircraft and 234 Waco CG @-@ 4A gliders . The transport aircraft were divided into four groups , two of which carried paratroopers while the other two towed gliders . Each group took off from a different airfield in the Carolinas . The four groups deployed a total of 4 @,@ 800 troops in the first wave . Eighty @-@ five percent were delivered to their targets without navigational error , and the airborne troops seized the Knollwood Army Auxiliary Airfield and secured the landing area for the rest of the division before daylight . With its initial objectives taken , the 11th Airborne Division then launched a coordinated ground attack against a reinforced infantry regiment and conducted several aerial resupply and casualty evacuation missions in coordination with United States Army Air Forces transport aircraft . The exercise was judged by observers to be a great success . McNair , pleased by its results , attributed this success to the great improvements in airborne training that had been implemented in the months following Operation Husky . As a result of the Knollwood Maneuver , division @-@ sized airborne forces were deemed to be feasible , and Eisenhower permitted their retention . 
 = = = Leyte = = = 
 Following the Knollwood Maneuver the 11th Airborne remained in reserve until January 1944 , when it was moved by train from Camp Mackall to Camp Polk in Louisiana . After four weeks of final preparation for its combat role , in April the division was moved to Camp Stoneman , California , and then transferred to Milne Bay , Papua New Guinea , between 25 May and 11 June . From June to September the division underwent acclimatization and continued its airborne training , conducting parachute drops in the New Guinea jungle and around the airfield in Dobodura . During this period , most of the glider troops became parachute @-@ qualified making the division almost fully Airborne . On 11 November the division boarded a convoy of naval transports and was escorted to Leyte in the Philippines , arriving on 18 November . Four days later it was attached to XXIV Corps and committed to combat , but operating as an infantry division rather than in an airborne capacity . The 11th Airborne was ordered to relieve the 7th Infantry Division stationed in the Burauen @-@ La Paz @-@ <unk> area , engage and destroy all Japanese forces in its operational area , and protect XXIV Corps rear @-@ area supply dumps and airfields . 
 Maj. Gen. Swing ordered the 187th Glider Infantry Regiment ( GIR ) to guard the rear installations of XXIV Corps , while the 188th GIR was to secure the division 's rear and conduct aggressive patrols to eliminate any enemy troops in the area . The 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment ( PIR ) was assigned the task of destroying all Japanese formations in the division 's operational area , which it began on 28 November when it relieved the 7th Infantry . The 511th PIR advanced overland with two battalions abreast and the third in reserve , but progress proved slow in the face of fierce Japanese resistance , a lack of mapped trails , and heavy rainfall ( with more than twenty @-@ three inches ( 60 cm ) falling in November alone ) . As the advance continued resupply became progressively more difficult ; the division resorted to using large numbers of Piper Cub aircraft to drop food and ammunition . Several attempts were made to improve the rate of advance , such as dropping platoons of the 187th GIR from Piper Cubs in front of the 511th PIR to reconnoiter , and using C @-@ 47 transport aircraft to drop artillery pieces to the regiment 's location when other forms of transport , such as mule @-@ trains , failed . 
 On 6 December the Japanese tried to disrupt operations on Leyte by conducting two small @-@ scale airborne raids . The first attempted to deploy a small number of Japanese airborne troops to occupy several key American @-@ held airfields at Tacloban and Dulag , but failed when the three aircraft used were either shot @-@ down , crash @-@ landed or destroyed on the ground along with their passengers . The second , larger , raid was carried out by between twenty @-@ nine and thirty @-@ nine transport aircraft supported by fighters ; despite heavy losses , the Japanese managed to drop a number of airborne troops around Burauen airfield , where the headquarters of 11th Airborne Division were located . Five L @-@ 5 Sentinel reconnaissance aircraft and one C @-@ 47 transport were destroyed , but the raiders were eliminated by an ad hoc combat group of artillerymen , engineers and support troops led by Maj. Gen. Swing . 
 The 511th PIR was reinforced by the 2nd Battalion , 187th GIR , and continued its slow but steady progress . On 17 December it broke through the Japanese lines and arrived at the western shoreline of Leyte , linking up with elements of the 32nd Infantry Division . It was during this period that Private Elmer E. <unk> earned a posthumous Medal of Honor when he helped to repel a counterattack , personally killing twenty @-@ seven Japanese soldiers before being mortally wounded by a sniper . The regiment was ordered to set up temporary defensive positions before being relieved on 25 December by the 1st Batt . , 187th GIR , and the 2nd Batt . , 188th GIR , who would themselves incur considerable casualties against a heavily dug @-@ in enemy . The 511th PIR was reassembled at its original base @-@ camp in Leyte on 15 January 1945 . 
 = = = Luzon = = = 
 On 22 January the division was placed on alert for an operation on the island of Luzon , to the north of Leyte . Five days later the 187th and 188th Glider Infantry Regiments were embarked for Luzon by sea , while the 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment flew by C @-@ 46 Commando transport aircraft to Mindoro . At dawn on 31 January the 188th GIR led an amphibious assault near Nasugbu , in southern Luzon . Supported by a short naval barrage , A @-@ 20 Havoc light bombers and P @-@ 38 Lightning fighter aircraft , a beach @-@ head was established in the face of light Japanese resistance . The regiment moved rapidly to secure Nasugbu , after which its 1st Battalion advanced up the island 's arterial Highway 17 to deny the Japanese time to establish defenses further inland . The 2nd Battalion moved south , crossing the River Lian and securing the division 's right flank . By 10 : 30 elements of the 188th had pushed deep into southern Luzon , creating the space for the 187th GIR to come ashore . The 188th 's 2nd Battalion was relieved and the regiment continued its advance , reaching the River <unk> by 14 : 30 and securing a vital bridge before it could be destroyed by Japanese combat engineers . 
 Following Highway 17 to <unk> , the regiment began to encounter heavier Japanese resistance . At midnight the 187th took over the lead and the two glider infantry regiments rested briefly before tackling the main Japanese defensive lines . These consisted of trenches linked to bunkers and fortified caves , and were manned by several hundred infantry with numerous artillery pieces in support . At 09 : 00 on 1 February the glider infantry launched their assault , and by midday had managed to break through the first Japanese position ; they spent the rest of the day conducting mopping up operations . On the morning of 2 February the second line was breached , and by midnight the 188th had broken a third . The divisional reconnaissance platoon was now in the vicinity of Tagaytay Ridge , the intended site of the 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment 's first combat drop . 
 The 511th 's airborne operation had originally been scheduled for 2 February , but with Major General Swing 's insistence that the drop was only to go ahead if his ground forces were in range to offer support , the dogged Japanese resistance encountered delayed the operation . With only forty @-@ eight C @-@ 47 Skytrain transport aircraft available , the 511th was forced to deploy in three waves . The regimental staff , the 2nd Battalion and half of the 3rd Battalion would drop first , the rest of the regiment would arrive in the second lift , and the 457th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion would drop in the third . 
 At 03 : 00 on 3 February the troops of the first lift entered their transport planes , and at 07 : 00 the first transports left Mindoro . Protected by an escort of P @-@ 61 Black Widow night fighters , on arriving over Luzon they followed Highway 17 to Tagaytay Ridge . The ridge itself was an open space some two thousand yards ( 1 @,@ 829 m ) long and four thousand yards ( 3 @,@ 657 m ) wide , plowed in places , and had been largely cleared of Japanese troops by local Filipino soldiers and recognized guerrillas . At 08 : 15 the first echelon of the first lift , approximately 345 men , successfully parachuted into the drop zone . The second echelon , consisting of approximately 570 men , were dropped prematurely and landed about eight thousand yards ( 7 @,@ 315 m ) to the east . The next lift also encountered problems , with 425 men dropping correctly but another 1 @,@ 325 dropping early due to pilot error and poor jump discipline . However , the entire regiment was assembled within five hours of the first landings . After overcoming minor Japanese resistance , by 15 : 00 the 511th had made contact with the 188th and 187th , and the entire division was once again assembled as a single formation . The ridge having been cleared of its remaining defenders , the division began to advance towards Manila , reaching the <unk> River by 21 : 00 . The city was protected by the Genko Line , a major Japanese defensive belt that stretched along Manila 's southern edge . The line consisted of approximately 1 @,@ 200 two- to three @-@ story deep blockhouses , many of which emplaced naval guns or large @-@ caliber mortars . <unk> heavy anti @-@ aircraft weapons , machine @-@ gun nests and booby @-@ traps made of naval bombs completed the defenses , which were manned by around 6 @,@ 000 Japanese soldiers . 
 The 11th Airborne Division was ordered to breach the Genko Line and drive into Manila , where it would link up with other American forces attacking the city from the north . All three regiments were committed to the assault . Spearheading the division 's attack on 5 February , the 511th overcame fierce resistance and broke the crust of the Japanese position , but was soon relieved by the 188th . As the glider regiment took up the push westwards in the face of heavy opposition , the 511th changed their axis of advance and attempted to move into the city from the north . By 11 February , the division had penetrated as far as Nichols Field , an airfield that formed the center of the Genko Line . This was heavily fortified with a number of entrenched naval guns and a series of bunkers ; after a short artillery bombardment on the morning of 12 February , the 187th 's 2nd Battalion attacked the airfield 's north @-@ west corner while the 1st Battalion and the entire 188th regiment moved in from the south and south @-@ eastern corners . This pincer movement succeeded in taking the airfield and , despite a local counter @-@ attack , by nightfall the position was secured . The following day the division thrust towards Fort William McKinley , the headquarters of Rear Admiral Iwabuchi , commander of the Japanese defenders on Luzon . It was during this advance that Private First Class Manuel Perez Jr. neutralized several Japanese bunkers which were impeding the division 's progress , capturing one single @-@ handedly and killing eighteen Japanese soldiers . PFC Perez was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor . 
 On 15 February , the 1st Battalion of the 187th , alongside other American units , launched an attack on <unk> Point . This was an extremely heavily fortified position featuring the same defensive measures as the Genko Line , and it would take six days of hard fighting , multiple airstrikes , and the frequent use of napalm and heavy artillery , before the point was secured . Meanwhile , having taken heavy casualties on its approach to Fort McKinley — particularly when the Japanese detonated a quantity of buried naval depth charges — on 17 February the rest of the 11th Airborne Division assaulted the fort . The 511th led the break @-@ in , and by 18 February the area had been cleared of its defenders . Sporadic fighting continued in Manilla until 3 March , when all organized Japanese resistance ended .
