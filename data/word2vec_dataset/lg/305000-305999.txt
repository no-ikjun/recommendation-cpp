 The music video for " Denial " was directed by Harvey B @-@ Brown . It was his first solo video project , following the discontinuation of his 18 @-@ year partnership with Carolyn Corben . The video was produced by Francesca Barnes , while Tom Gander served as the art director . It was shot in various formats , including 16 mm film , Bolex , Super 8 film and three still cameras . Aman King , a smoke artist from Golden Square , collaborated with Brown to devise treatments of the stills . Multiple film effects were used in the video , including colour correction , <unk> and film grain , with the intention of creating visuals inspired by Vogue . It premiered on the Sugababes ' official website on 7 January 2008 . 
 Brown stated that he wanted to " redefine " the group and conceptualise a new image that would represent his perception of their personas . He described the band as " extremely style @-@ savvy " and motivated them to be bold , uninhibited and experimental . The video takes influences from styles of fashion editorial and features the Sugababes in various costumes and guises . Their outfits were created with many fabrics , in addition to newspapers , plastic bin bags and florist 's cellophane . Overall , there were 13 costume changes . Scenes for the video were shot in a wide range of environments and locations , including a fire escape , loading bay , and storage cupboard . 
 " I shot the video like [ a ] fashion editorial , using every inch of the studio , including the fire escape , the gantry and the loading bay . I even did a couple of shots with the girls in the storage cupboard where the studio lighting stands were kept . And whilst I was shooting one outfit on one girl , I would be getting the next outfit and set ready . " 
 Digital Arts called the video " a sumptuously over @-@ the @-@ top affair " and wrote that the effects created " luxuriant , opulent visuals that capture the buzz , attitude and posing of a high @-@ fashion shoot " . Coleman from the Birmingham Mail described it as " amazing " . The video became one of the Sugababes ' favourites to shoot , and inspired them to wear more daring and dramatic outfits on their Change Tour in 2008 . According to London Evening Standard , the group managed to adopt a more sophisticated and mature style with the assistance from various stylists .

 " Denial " was one of three songs from Change that the Sugababes performed at London 's <unk> on 14 September 2007 . The performance was part of a gig to promote the release of the album 's lead single " About You Now " . They performed " Denial " in March 2008 on the eighth season of the British television show Ant & Dec 's Saturday Night Takeaway . The song was included on the set list for the group 's 2008 Change Tour . Their performance at the Newcastle City Hall attracted a positive response from Kat Keogh of The Journal , who wrote that the song " slotted in neatly " amongst the group 's more well @-@ known songs . The Sugababes performed " Denial " at the 2008 Oxygen Festival as part of a set list , which included their number @-@ one singles such as " Freak like Me " , " Round Round " , " Hole in the Head " and " Push the Button " , in addition to other tracks from Change . Midway through the gig , technical difficulties with their microphones arose and the trio were forced to delay their performance while the issue was fixed . The band performed " Denial " in July 2009 at the Riverside Cricket Ground , County Durham as part of a set list .

 = Film Booking Offices of America = 
 Film Booking Offices of America ( FBO ) ( also known as FBO Pictures Corporation ) was an American film studio of the silent era , a producer and distributor of mostly low @-@ budget films . The business began in 1918 as Robertson @-@ Cole ( U.S. ) , the American division of a British import – export company and Robertson @-@ Cole was formed by the English @-@ born Harry F. Robertson and the American Rufus <unk> Cole . Robertson @-@ Cole bought the Hallmark Exchanges ( formerly the Mutual Exchanges that became known as Exhibitors @-@ Mutual Exchanges ) from Frank J. Hall in 1920 . Exhibitors @-@ Mutual / Hallmark had distributed Robertson @-@ Cole product , and acquiring the exchanges gave them the right to distribute their own films plus Hall 's product , with the exception of Charlie Chaplin reissues he had the rights to . 
 Robertson @-@ Cole initiated movie production in the United States in 1920 . That year , it incorporated Robertson @-@ Cole Studios , Inc. and bought 460 acres in Santa Monica , California to establish a studio . The property , which became known as the " R.C. Ranch " , enabled Robertson @-@ Cole to centralize movie production , which previously had been scattered . The movie company had relied on equipment rentals to produce motion pictures . Two years later , a corporate reorganization led to the company 's new name , with FBO becoming the official name of the distributing operation and Robertson @-@ Cole Pictures Corp. the name of the production operation . In 1923 , the studio contracted with Western actor Fred Thomson , who would soon emerge as one of Hollywood 's most popular stars . Thomson was just one of numerous screen cowboys with whom FBO became identified . 
 The studio , whose core market was America 's small towns , also put out many romantic melodramas , non @-@ Western action pictures , and comedic shorts . In 1926 , financier Joseph P. Kennedy led a group that acquired the company . In June 1928 , using RCA Photophone technology , FBO became only the second Hollywood studio to release a feature @-@ length " talkie . " A few months later , Kennedy and RCA chief David Sarnoff arranged the merger that created RKO , one of the major studios of Hollywood 's Golden Age .

 The company that would become FBO began as the U.S.-based movie subsidiary of the British importer , exporter , and film distributor Robertson @-@ Cole . This organization was similar in structure to the French Pathé Exchange company , a subsidiary of the French Pathé Frères company . From its U.S. headquarters in New York City , R @-@ C Pictures , as it was sometimes known , first entered the American film distribution market . In 1919 , the company forged an alliance with Exhibitors Mutual Distributing , a corporate descendant of the Mutual Film studio . The first of R @-@ C 's own feature productions to be released was The Wonder Man , directed by John G. Adolfi and starring Georges Carpentier , which debuted May 29 , 1920 . With its move into production , Robertson @-@ Cole established a 13 @.@ 5 @-@ acre ( 5 @.@ 5 @-@ hectare ) studio in Los Angeles 's fortuitously named Colegrove district , then adjacent to but soon to be subsumed by Hollywood . In January 1921 , Robertson @-@ Cole absorbed Hallmark Pictures , which had acquired the Exhibitors Mutual interests the previous year . The first official Robertson @-@ Cole production shot at the new studio was a February 1921 release , The Mistress of Shenstone , directed by Henry King and starring beautiful Pauline Frederick , a former Paramount and Goldwyn star . That year , the British owners of the studio entered into a working relationship with Joseph P. Kennedy , father of future U.S. president John F. Kennedy . Joseph Kennedy was then a broker at the New York banking firm of Hayden , Stone , as well as the owner of Maine – New Hampshire Theatres , a small chain of movie houses . Though he failed to arrange the sale R @-@ C 's general partners were looking for , Kennedy 's involvement with the studio was far from over . 
 In 1922 , Robertson @-@ Cole underwent a major reorganization as the company 's founders departed , though the corporation remained under majority British ownership . The flagship U.S. distribution business changed its name to Film Booking Offices of America , a banner under which R @-@ C had released more than a dozen independent productions . The West Coast studio apparently continued to make films under the Robertson @-@ Cole name for some time , but FBO ultimately became the primary identity of the business for production as well as distribution . Between the 1922 reorganization and October 1923 , one of the company 's new American investors , Pat Powers , was effectively in command . Powers had previously led his own filmmaking company , part of the multiple merger that created the large Universal studio in 1912 . Powers apparently changed the name of Robertson @-@ Cole / FBO to the Powers Studio for a brief period , though there is no record of the company ever having produced or released a film under that banner . In 1923 , the studio launched a series of boxing @-@ themed shorts , Fighting Blood , starring George O 'Hara . He would become an FBO mainstay , often paired with Alberta Vaughn , in such comedy series as The Pacemakers ( 1925 ) . Most of O 'Hara 's and Vaughn 's films for the studio were two @-@ reelers — a measure of film length indicating a running time of about twenty minutes . 
 Now a fully independent businessman , Joseph Kennedy joined the FBO board of directors in 1923 , as well . By this time , the studio was owned by Graham 's of London , a banking firm , and Powers was succeeded by <unk> Thomson , a Graham 's operative . Before leaving the board the following year , Kennedy put together a major distribution and production deal between FBO and leading Western star Fred Thomson . B. P. Fineman became the studio 's production chief in 1924 ; Evelyn Brent , his wife , moved over from Fox to become FBO 's top dramatic star . In April 1925 , FBO vice @-@ president Joseph I. Schnitzer signed Thomson to a new contract paying him $ 10 @,@ 000 a week ( equivalent to approximately $ 134 @,@ 934 in 2016 dollars ) . Thomson was now the highest paid of all cowboy actors , surpassing even the renowned Tom Mix . The deal also gave Thomson his own independent production unit at the studio . 
 As a distributor , FBO 's roster of films was about half independent and foreign productions , half its own studio output . At the height of its activity ( 1923 – 28 ) , it released an average of around 110 features and shorts a year , focusing on distribution to small @-@ town exhibitors and independent theater chains ( that is , those not owned by one of the major Hollywood studios ) . As a production company , Film Booking Offices concentrated on low @-@ budget movies , with an emphasis on Westerns , romantic melodramas , and comedy shorts . From its first productions in early 1920 through late 1928 , when it was dissolved in a merger , the company produced approximately 400 films under the brand of either Robertson @-@ Cole Pictures or FBO Pictures . Between 1924 and 1926 , several higher @-@ end productions were made under the rubric of Gothic Pictures . The studio 's top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line movies , aimed at major exhibition venues beyond the reach of most FBO films , were sometimes marketed as FBO " Gold Bond " pictures . Without the backing of large corporate interests , nor the security of its own theater chain , the company faced cash @-@ flow difficulties during its earlier years . Short @-@ term loans at high interest rates posed a significant financial drain .

 While still at Hayden , Stone , Kennedy had boasted to a colleague , " Look at that bunch of pants <unk> in Hollywood making themselves millionaires . I could take the whole business away from them . " In 1925 , he set out to do so , forming his own group of investors led by wealthy Boston lawyer Guy Currier and including Filene 's department store owner Louis Kirstein and Union Stockyards and Armour and Company owner Frederick H. Prince . In August 1925 , Kennedy traveled to England with an offer to buy a controlling stake in Film Booking Offices for $ 1 million . The bid was initially rejected , but in February 1926 , FBO 's owners decided to take the money . In short order , Kennedy moved his family from Massachusetts to New York City to focus on running his new business . He swiftly addressed the company 's perennial cash @-@ flow problems , arranging lines of credit and issuing stock in a business division he established , the Cinema Credit Corporation . By March , he was traveling to Hollywood . The president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association , Will Hays , was delighted by the new face on the scene — in Hays 's eyes , Kennedy signified both a desirable image for the industry and Wall Street 's faith in its prospects . Hays heralded Kennedy as " exceedingly American " ( historian Cari Beauchamp explains the connotation : " not Jewish , " in contrast to most of the studio heads ) , while celebrating Kennedy 's " background of lofty and conservative financial connections , an atmosphere of much home and family life and all those fireside virtues of which the public never hears in the current news from Hollywood . " 
 Fineman and Brent both departed FBO around the time of the purchase . Kennedy appointed Edwin King as the studio 's production chief , but the new owner took a personal hand in guiding the company creatively as well as financially . Kennedy soon brought stability to FBO , making it one of the most reliably profitable outfits in the minor leagues of the Hollywood studio system . Westerns remained the studio 's backbone , along with various action pictures and romantic scenarios ; as Kennedy put it , " Melodrama is our meat . " During this period , the average production cost of FBO features was around $ 50 @,@ 000 , and few were budgeted at anything more than $ 75 @,@ 000 . By comparison , in 1927 – 28 the average cost at Fox was $ 190 @,@ 000 ; at Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer , $ 275 @,@ 000 . One major expense was taken on directly by Kennedy : with several studios competing for Fred Thomson , Kennedy signed him to a personal contract for $ 15 @,@ 000 a week . This was the highest straight salary for any actor in the industry , matched only by Tom Mix 's new arrangement with Fox . Under the contract , Kennedy struck a deal in early 1927 with Paramount Pictures for the major studio to produce and distribute a series of four Thomson " super westerns . " Kennedy participated in the films ' financing ( and profits ) and the actor 's company stayed on the FBO lot . Of the four Thomson features that reached theaters in 1927 , three were FBO releases . 
 = = = Sound enters the picture = = = 
 The advent of sound film would drastically alter the studio 's course : Negotiations that began in late 1927 with the Radio Corporation of America ( RCA ) on a deal for sound conversion led to RCA purchasing a major interest in FBO in January 1928 . Four months later , as part of a strategy conceived with RCA head David Sarnoff , Kennedy acquired control of Keith @-@ Albee @-@ Orpheum ( KAO ) , a vaudeville exhibition chain with approximately one hundred theaters across the United States , and with the Pathé Exchange and Cecil B. De Mille 's Producers Distributing Corporation under its control . 
 On June 17 , 1928 , FBO 's The Perfect Crime , directed by Bert Glennon and starring Clive Brook and Irene Rich , debuted . It was the first feature @-@ length " talkie " to appear from a studio other than Warner Bros. since the epochal premiere of Warners ' The Jazz Singer eight months before . The Perfect Crime , which went into general release on August 4 , had been shot silently . Using the RCA Photophone sound @-@ on @-@ film system , the dialogue was dubbed in afterward — a process then known as " synthetic sound . " On August 22 , Kennedy signed a contract with RCA for live Photophone recording ; more importantly , he also tendered the company an option to buy his governing share of FBO . Two months later , RCA had acquired controlling stock interests in both the studio and KAO . 
 On October 23 , 1928 , RCA announced it was merging Film Booking Offices and Keith @-@ Albee @-@ Orpheum to form the new motion picture business Radio @-@ Keith @-@ Orpheum ( RKO ) , with Sarnoff as chairman . Kennedy , who retained Pathé , was paid $ 150 @,@ 000 for arranging the merger on top of the millions of dollars in profit he made from selling off his stock . Joseph I. Schnitzer , ranking FBO vice @-@ president , was elevated to president of the new company 's production arm , replacing Kennedy . William LeBaron , the last FBO production chief , retained his position after the merger , but the new studio , dedicated to full sound production , cut ties with most of FBO 's roster of silent @-@ screen performers . Movies that Film Booking Offices had either produced or arranged to distribute were released under the FBO banner through the end of 1929 . The last official FBO production to reach American theaters was Pals of the Prairie , directed by Louis King and starring Buzz Barton and Frank Rice , released July 1 , 1929 . 
 = = Cinematic legacy = = 
 = = = <unk> and celebrity casting = = = 
 The vast majority of FBO / Robertson @-@ Cole pictures , produced during either the silent era or the transitional period of the conversion to sound cinema , are considered to be lost films , with no copies now known to exist . Partly in consequence , many of FBO 's star actors are barely remembered today . 
 Pauline Frederick was the major headliner of the early R @-@ C days , and Evelyn Brent was FBO 's most prized non @-@ Western star . Warner Baxter , Joe E. Brown , and young Frankie Darro were among the other prominent FBO players . Anna Q. Nilsson starred in two of the studio 's larger productions , as did Olive Borden and Douglas Fairbanks Jr . FBO 's leading star of action and mystery pictures was Richard Talmadge . He appeared in eighteen FBO releases , more than half of them produced by his own company . Maurice " Lefty " Flynn starred in over a dozen FBO action films , all directed by Harry Garson , who also ran his own production business . From the studio 's pre @-@ Hollywood days in 1920 through 1928 , Ralph Lewis starred in more than ten R @-@ C and FBO pictures of various genres . Former model Reed Howes , renowned as an " Arrow Collar Man " , made his acting debut with FBO after an extensive publicity campaign . 
 In its earlier years , the studio did not hesitate to take advantage of scandal sheet – worthy events . After the death of celebrated Paramount actor Wallace Reid , brought on by morphine addiction , his widow , Dorothy Davenport , signed on as producer and star of a cinematic examination of the sins of substance abuse : Human Wreckage , released by FBO in June 1923 , five months after Reid 's death , featured Davenport ( billed as Mrs. Wallace Reid ) as the wife of a noble attorney turned dope fiend . 
 When the biggest movie star in the world , Rudolph Valentino , split from his wife , Natacha <unk> , she was swiftly enlisted by the studio to costar with Clive Brook in the sensitively titled When Love Grows Cold ( 1925 ) . Under Kennedy 's control , studio production shifted away from provocative fare in an attempt to brand the studio 's films as suitable for the " average American " and the entire family : " We can 't make pictures and label them ' For Children , ' or ' For Women ' or ' For Stout People ' or ' For Thin Ones . ' We must make pictures that have appeal to all . " Though Kennedy ended the scandal @-@ sheet specials , FBO still found occasion for celebrity casting : One Minute to Play ( 1926 ) , directed by Sam Wood , marks the film debut of football great " Red " Grange . 
 = = = Western stars = = = 
 Central to the FBO identity were Westerns and the studio 's major cowboy star , Fred Thomson . In both 1926 and 1927 , he ranked number two in the Exhibitors ' Herald survey of the " Top Stars of the Year , " right behind Tom Mix . With Thomson 's personal contract with Kennedy due to expired in mid @-@ 1927 , Kennedy — sending that Thomson had reached the peak of his popularity and seeing a financial opportunity for FBO — arranged a four @-@ picture deal with Paramount Pictures , one of the major Hollywood studio . The deal essentially ceded Thomson to the rival studio . For FBO 's guarantee of $ 75 @,@ 000 in financing per picture , Thomson would star in Paramount productions . In return , Paramount would return the $ 75 @,@ 000 in financing plus an additional $ 100 @,@ 000 to FBO and pay Thomson 's $ 15 @,@ 000 a week salary . 
 In 1928 , Kennedy replaced Thomson by signing Tom Mix , whose contract with William Fox 's Fox Film Corporation had expired . Mix played hard @-@ to @-@ get , threatening to move to Argentina to make films or joining the circus , but eventually , he signed with FBO but eventually left for Universal due to salary disputes with the studio . He said of Kennedy that he was a " tight @-@ assed , money @-@ crazed son @-@ of @-@ a @-@ bitch " . 
 FBO 's second @-@ biggest long @-@ running Western star was Tom Tyler . According to a June 1927 report in Moving Picture World : 
 With Tom Tyler rapidly taking the place recently vacated by Fred Thomson , <unk> ' s program of western pictures is taking a place second to none in the industry .... Tyler has made rapid strides during his two years with <unk> and with his horse ' Flash ' and dog ' Beans ' has become one of the leading favorites on the screen . 
 In addition to these three big names there was also Harry Carey , still a major star when he made several films for the studio in 1922 – 23 . The other cowboy stars of FBO included Bob Custer , Bob Steele , and teenager Buzz Barton . 
 = = = Canine stars = = = 
 One of the studio 's most reliable Western headliners was a dog : Ranger . The fabled <unk> starred in FBO 's White Fang ( 1925 ) , and Rin Tin Tin had one of his earliest roles in My Dad ( 1922 ) . 
 = = = Short subjects and animation = = = 
 FBO 's many shorts — the popular George O 'Hara and Alberta Vaughn series , and scores of others — are largely forgotten . Of particular historical interest are two independently produced series of slapstick comedies with important performers : FBO put out several shorts in 1924 – 25 made by Joe Rock and starring Stan Laurel , before his famous partnership with Oliver Hardy . In 1926 – 27 , the company distributed more than a dozen shorts by innovative comedian / animator Charles Bowers . 
 In addition to the work of Charles Bowers , FBO was a distributor of other significant animated films . Between 1924 and 1926 , FBO released the work of John Randolph Bray 's cartoon studio , including the " Dinky Doodle " series created by Walter Lantz . From 1925 to 1927 , the studio put out approximately three dozen animated adaptations of George Herriman newspaper comics directed by William Nolan , featuring characters from Herriman 's famed Krazy Kat strip . FBO picked up the Krazy Kat cartoons from the distribution team of Margaret Winkler and her husband , Charles Mintz . In 1926 , FBO struck a deal with the Winkler – Mintz operation for another series , one that , like Bowers ' shorts , involved both animation and a live performer : the " Alice Comedies , " of which FBO would put out over two dozen , were created by two young animators , Ub Iwerks and Walt Disney .

 Kennedy had no illusions about his studio 's place in the realm of cinematic art . A journalist once complimented him on FBO 's recent output : " You have had some good pictures this year . " Kennedy jocularly inquired , " What the hell were they ? " In her history of RKO , author Betty Lasky points to the pre @-@ Kennedy Broken Laws ( 1924 ) , directed by Roy William Neill and starring Dorothy Davenport ( again billed as Mrs. Wallace Reid ) as exemplifying the rare " unforgettable picture of the higher caliber " put out by FBO . 
 Among the studio 's action movies , one standout production was a 1927 Tarzan picture . Author Edgar Rice Burroughs declared , " If you want to see the personification of Tarzan of the Apes as I visualize him , see the film Tarzan and the Golden Lion with Mr. James Pierce . " The Film Daily reviewer wrote that the movie " has a rather new order of thrills and atmosphere that might prove distinctly attractive . " The two @-@ reeler West of Hot Dog ( 1924 ) , according to historian Simon Louvish , contains " one of Stan [ Laurel ] ' s finest gags , " involving a level of cinematic technique that bears comparison to Buster Keaton 's classic Sherlock , Jr . 
 Some of the studio 's most impressive releases were foreign productions . In 1927 , FBO picked up for U.S. distribution a celebrated Austrian biblical spectacular made three years earlier : Die <unk> ( The Slave Queen , aka Moon of Israel ) had already won its director , Michael Kertész , a job with Warner Bros. In Hollywood , he would change his name to Michael Curtiz . Una Nueva y <unk> nación ( 1928 ) , the most successful film in the history of Argentine silent cinema , was shot in Hollywood and distributed in the United States by FBO as The Charge of the Gauchos . 
 One of the two cinematographers of Una Nueva y <unk> nación was Nicholas Musuraca , who established his career at Film Booking Offices . With RKO , Musuraca would become one of Hollywood 's most respected cinematographers . 
 Among FBO 's other offscreen talent , the best known director to work regularly at the studio was Ralph Ince , younger brother of famous filmmaker Thomas H. Ince . Pulling double duty on occasion , Ralph Ince starred in four of the fourteen films he made for FBO . One production in which Ince served in both capacities was particularly well received : Chicago After Midnight ( 1928 ) was described by the New York Times as " [ a ] n unusually well @-@ acted and adroitly directed underworld story . " After The Mistress of Shenstone , Henry King directed two more R @-@ C films with Pauline Frederick , also in 1921 : Salvage and The Sting of the Lash . Tod Browning directed two Gothic Pictures specials in 1924 starring Evelyn Brent : The Dangerous Flirt and Silk Stocking Sal . 
 From 1921 to 1924 , William Seiter directed a half @-@ dozen FBO releases , some produced directly for the studio , others independently . Between 1922 and 1926 , Emory Johnson produced and directed at least eight films for FBO . Historian William K. Everson has pointed to Seiter and Johnson as two of the overlooked directorial talents of the silent era . 
 Screenwriter Frances Marion , who would win two Oscars in the 1930s , penned ten of the FBO pictures starring her husband , Fred Thomson . Editor Pandro S. Berman , son of a major FBO stockholder , cut his first film for the studio at the age of twenty @-@ two ; he would go on to renown as an RKO producer and production chief . Famed RKO costume designer Walter Plunkett was also an FBO graduate .

 The roadway starts at a junction with M @-@ 119 ( Lake Shore Drive ) and C @-@ 77 ( State Road ) in the community of Cross Village near Lake Michigan in Emmet County . C @-@ 66 travels southward for about 300 feet ( 91 m ) concurrently along C @-@ 77 to the intersection with Levering Road . From there , C @-@ 66 turns eastward on Levering Road , leaving town . The landscape outside of town is mostly woodland with scattered fields . Except for a jog near Hill Road in Bliss Township , Levering Road is a straight road running due east . C @-@ 66 intersects C @-@ 81 ( Pleasantview Road ) in a clearing before entering the community of Levering . The county road passes through some residential areas and by a baseball field before meeting US 31 . C @-@ 66 turns south to run concurrently along US 31 for about a quarter mile ( 0 @.@ 4 km ) before turning eastward again . 
 Levering Road continues easterly leaving town south of <unk> Lake . East of the intersection with Ingleside Road , C @-@ 66 crosses into Cheboygan County . The roadway curves to the northeast before returning to a due eastward course north of Munro Lake along the Hebron – Munro township line .. The landscape changes to include more farm fields once road passes the lake . C @-@ 66 intersects I @-@ 75 at exit 326 along the latter . On the east side of the interchange , Levering Road passes Sea Shell City , a tourist trap , and turns northeastward into Hebron Township . C @-@ 66 then turns easterly again before it crosses into Beaugrand Township , taking the additional name Cheboygan Road . The roadway crosses branches of the Little Black River and passes to the south of the Cheboygan County Airport . East of the airport , C @-@ 66 enters the city of Cheboygan and follows State Street into town ; this area is residential in nature .

 = = History = = 
 Roadways along the route of Levering Road in Cheboygan County existed as far back as 1902 in Hebron and Munro townships ; the section south of the township line was not yet built at the time . By 1927 , Levering Road extended across the tip of the Lower Peninsula ; near the Hebron – Beaugrand township line in Cheboygan County , the county road made a jog to follow what is now <unk> and Hill roads . In 1930 , the ECRC paved Levering Road between US 31 and the county line and the CCRC paved the roadway in Beaugrand Township . By mid 1936 , it was paved from a point between Cross Village and the Pleasantview Road intersection to the county line in Emmet County as well as the Beaugrand Township section in Cheboygan County . During World War II , the counties reverted most of Levering Road to a gravel surface ; pavement in Emmet County started east of Pleasantview Road instead of west , and Cheboygan County had no sections paved . At the same time , the new roadway was opened to bypass <unk> and Hill roads . 
 In late 1949 or early 1950 , the ECRC repaved Levering Road westward back to the point between Cross Village and Pleasantview Road that had been paved before the war . In late 1951 or early 1952 , the CCRC paved its section of Levering Road . In late 1954 or early 1955 , the ECRC completed paving all of Levering Road in its jurisdiction .

 = Banquo = 
 Lord Banquo / <unk> / , Thane of Lochaber , is a character in William Shakespeare 's 1606 play Macbeth . In the play , he is at first an ally to Macbeth ( both are generals in the King 's army ) and they are together when they meet the Three Witches . After prophesying that Macbeth will become king , the witches tell Banquo that he will not be king himself , but that his descendants will be . Later , Macbeth in his lust for power sees Banquo as a threat and has him murdered ; Banquo 's son , Fleance , escapes . Banquo 's ghost returns in a later scene , causing Macbeth to react with alarm during a public feast . 
 Shakespeare borrowed the character of Banquo from Holinshed 's Chronicles , a history of Britain published by Raphael Holinshed in 1587 . In Chronicles Banquo is an accomplice to Macbeth in the murder of the king , rather than a loyal subject of the king who is seen as an enemy by Macbeth . Shakespeare may have changed this aspect of his character in order to please King James , who was thought at the time to be a descendant of the real Banquo . Critics often interpret Banquo 's role in the play as being a foil to Macbeth , resisting evil where Macbeth embraces it . Sometimes , however , his motives are unclear , and some critics question his purity . He does nothing to accuse Macbeth of murdering the king , even though he has reason to believe Macbeth is responsible . 
 = = Source = = 
 Shakespeare often used Raphael Holinshed 's Chronicles of England , Scotland , and Ireland — commonly known as Holinshed 's Chronicles — as a source for his plays , and in Macbeth he borrows from several of the tales in that work . Holinshed portrays Banquo as a historical figure : he is an accomplice in Mac Bethad mac Findlaích 's ( Macbeth 's ) murder of Donnchad mac Crínáin ( King Duncan ) and plays an important part in ensuring that Macbeth , not Máel Coluim mac Donnchada ( Malcolm ) , takes the throne in the coup that follows . Holinshed in turn used an earlier work , the Scotorum Historiae ( 1526 – 7 ) by Hector Boece , as his source . Boece 's work is the first known record of Banquo and his son Fleance ; and scholars such as David Bevington generally consider them fictional characters invented by Boece . In Shakespeare 's day , however , they were considered historical figures of great repute , and the king , James I , based his claim to the throne in part on a descent from Banquo . The House of Stuart was descended from Walter fitz Alan , the first High Steward of Scotland , and he was believed to have been the grandson of Fleance and Gruffydd ap Llywelyn 's daughter , Nesta <unk> Gruffydd . In reality Walter fitz Alan was the son of Alan fitz <unk> , a Breton knight . 
 Unlike his sources , Shakespeare gives Banquo no role in the King 's murder , making it a deed committed solely by Macbeth and his wife . Why Shakespeare 's Banquo is so different from the character described by Holinshed and Boece is not known , though critics have proposed several possible explanations . First among them is the risk associated with portraying the king 's ancestor as a murderer and conspirator in the plot to overthrow a rightful king , as well as the author 's desire to flatter a powerful patron . But Shakespeare may also simply have altered Banquo 's character because there was no dramatic need for another accomplice to the murder . There was , however , a need to provide a dramatic contrast to Macbeth ; a role that many scholars argue is filled by Banquo . Similarly , when Jean de <unk> wrote about Banquo in his <unk> in 1611 , he also changed the character by portraying him as a noble and honourable man — the critic D. W. Maskell describes him as “ … <unk> 's paragon of valour and virtue ” — probably for reasons similar to Shakespeare 's . 
 Banquo 's role in the coup that follows the murder is harder to explain . Banquo 's loyalty to Macbeth , rather than Malcolm , after Duncan 's death makes him a passive accomplice in the coup : Malcolm , as Prince of Cumberland , is the rightful heir to the throne and Macbeth a usurper . Daniel <unk> , however , argues that when Ross and Angus bring King Duncan 's praise , and the news that Macbeth has been granted the title of Thane of Cawdor , the " greater honor " he ascribes to Macbeth is actually his title as Prince of Cumberland . If Macbeth , rather than Malcolm , is Prince of Cumberland then Macbeth would be next in line to the throne and no coup would be needed , effectively removing this ambiguity from Banquo 's character . 
 = = Role in the play = = 
 Banquo is in a third of the play 's scenes , as both a human and a ghost . As significant as he is to the plot , he has fewer lines than the relatively insignificant Ross , a Scottish nobleman who survives the play . In the second scene of the play , King Duncan describes the manner in which Macbeth , Thane of Glamis , and Banquo , Thane of Lochaber , bravely led his army against invaders , fighting side by side . In the next scene , Banquo and Macbeth , returning from the battle together , encounter the Three Witches , who predict that Macbeth will become Thane of Cawdor , and then king . Banquo , skeptical of the witches , challenges them to predict his own future , and they foretell that Banquo will never himself take the throne , but will beget a line of kings . Banquo remains skeptical after the encounter , wondering aloud if evil can ever speak the truth . He warns Macbeth that evil will offer men a small , hopeful truth only in order to catch them in a deadly trap . 
 When Macbeth kills the king and takes the throne , Banquo — the only one aware of this encounter with the witches — reserves judgment for God . He is unsure whether Macbeth committed regicide to gain the throne , but muses in a soliloquy that " I fear / Thou play <unk> most <unk> for ' t " . He offers his respects to the new King Macbeth and pledges loyalty . Later , worried that Banquo 's descendants and not his own will rule Scotland , Macbeth sends men to kill Banquo and his son Fleance . During the melee , Banquo holds off the assailants so that Fleance can escape , but is himself killed . The ghost of Banquo later returns to haunt Macbeth at the banquet in act three , scene four . A terrified Macbeth sees him , while the apparition is invisible to his guests . He appears again to Macbeth in a vision granted by the Three Witches , wherein Macbeth sees a long line of kings descended from Banquo . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 = = = Foil to Macbeth = = = 
 Many scholars see Banquo as a foil and a contrast to Macbeth . Macbeth , for example , eagerly accepts the Three Witches ' prophecy as true and seeks to help it along . Banquo , on the other hand , doubts the prophecies and the intentions of these seemingly evil creatures . Whereas Macbeth places his hope in the prediction that he will be king , Banquo argues that evil only offers gifts that lead to destruction . Banquo steadily resists the temptations of evil within the play , praying to heaven for help , while Macbeth seeks darkness , and prays that evil powers will aid him . This is visible in act two ; after Banquo sees Duncan to bed , he says : " There 's husbandry in heaven , / Their candles are all out " . This premonition of the coming darkness in association with Macbeth 's murders is repeated just before Banquo is killed : " it will be rain to @-@ night " , Banquo tells his son Fleance . 
 Banquo 's status as a contrast to Macbeth makes for some tense moments in the play . In act two , scene one , Banquo meets his son Fleance and asks him to take both his sword and his dagger ( " Hold , take my sword ... Take thee that too " ) . He also explains that he has been having trouble sleeping due to " cursed thoughts that nature / gives way to in repose ! " On Macbeth 's approach , he demands the sword returned to him quickly . Scholars have interpreted this to mean that Banquo has been dreaming of murdering the king as Macbeth 's accomplice in order to take the throne for his own family , as the Three Witches prophesied to him . In this reading , his good nature is so revolted by these thoughts that he gives his sword and dagger to Fleance to be sure they do not come true , but is so nervous at Macbeth 's approach that he demands them back . Other scholars have responded that Banquo 's dreams have less to do with killing the king and more to do with Macbeth . They argue that Banquo is merely setting aside his sword for the night . Then , when Macbeth approaches , Banquo , having had dreams about Macbeth 's deeds , takes back his sword as a precaution in this case . 
 Macbeth eventually sees that Banquo can no longer be trusted to aid him in his evil , and considers his friend a threat to his newly acquired throne . Thus he has him murdered . Banquo 's ability to live on in different ways is another oppositional force , in this case to Macbeth 's impending death . His spirit lives on in Fleance , his son , and in his ghostly presence at the banquet . 
 = = = Ghost scenes = = = 
 When Macbeth returns to the witches later in the play , they show him an apparition of the murdered Banquo , along with eight of his descendants . The scene carries deep significance : King James , on the throne when Macbeth was written , was believed to be separated from Banquo by nine generations . What Shakespeare writes here thus amounts to a strong support of James ' right to the throne by lineage , and for audiences of Shakespeare 's day , a very real fulfillment of the witches ' prophecy to Banquo that his sons would take the throne . This apparition is also deeply unsettling to Macbeth , who not only wants the throne for himself , but also desires to father a line of kings . 
 Banquo 's other appearance as a ghost during the banquet scene serves as an indicator of Macbeth 's conscience returning to plague his thoughts . Banquo 's triumph over death appears symbolically , insofar as he literally takes Macbeth 's seat during the feast . Shocked , Macbeth uses words appropriate to the metaphor of usurpation , describing Banquo as " crowned " with wounds . The spirit drains Macbeth 's manhood along with the blood from his cheeks ; as soon as Banquo 's form vanishes , Macbeth announces : " Why , so ; being gone , / I am a man again . " 
 Like the vision of Banquo 's lineage , the banquet scene has also been the subject of criticism . Critics have questioned whether not one , but perhaps two ghosts appear in this scene : Banquo and Duncan . Scholars arguing that Duncan attends the banquet state that Macbeth 's lines to the Ghost could apply equally well to the slain king . " Thou canst not say I did it " , for example , can mean that Macbeth is not the man who actually killed Banquo , or it can mean that Duncan , who was asleep when Macbeth killed him , cannot claim to have seen his killer . To add to the confusion , some lines Macbeth directs to the ghost , such as " Thy bones are <unk> " , cannot rightly be said of Banquo , who has only recently died . 
 Scholars debate whether Macbeth 's vision of Banquo is real or a hallucination . Macbeth had already seen a hallucination before murdering Duncan : a knife hovering in the air . Several performances of the play have even ignored the stage direction to have the Ghost of Banquo enter at all , heightening the sense that Macbeth is growing mad , since the audience cannot see what he claims to see . Scholars opposing this view claim that while the dagger is unusual , ghosts of murdered victims are more believable , having a basis in the audience 's superstitions . Spirits in other Shakespeare plays — notably Hamlet and Midsummer Night 's Dream — exist in ambiguous forms , occasionally even calling into question their own presence . 
 The concept of a character being confronted at a triumphant feast with a reminder of their downfall is not unique to Shakespeare and may originate from the Belshazzar 's feast episode of the Bible . The term ' ghost at the feast ' has entered popular culture , and is often used as a metaphor for a subject a person would rather avoid considering , or ( considering the general plot of Macbeth ) a reminder of a person 's unpleasant past or likely future . 
 = = Performances and interpretations = = 
 Banquo 's role , especially in the banquet ghost scene , has been subject to a variety of interpretations and mediums . Shakespeare 's text states : " Enter Ghost of Banquo , and sits in Macbeth 's place . " Several television versions have altered this slightly , having Banquo appear suddenly in the chair , rather than walking onstage and into it . Special effects and camera tricks also allow producers to make the ghost disappear and reappear , highlighting the fact that only Macbeth can see it . 
 Stage directors , unaided by post @-@ production effects and camera tricks , have used other methods to depict the ghost . In the late 19th century , elaborate productions of the play staged by Henry Irving employed a wide variety of approaches for this task . In 1877 a green silhouette was used to create a ghostlike image ; ten years later a trick chair was used to allow an actor to appear in the middle of the scene , and then again from the midst of the audience . In 1895 a shaft of blue light served to indicate the presence of Banquo 's spirit . In 1933 a Russian director named Theodore Komisarjevsky staged a modern retelling of the play ( Banquo and Macbeth were told of their future through palmistry ) ; he used Macbeth 's shadow as the ghost . In 1936 Orson Welles directed the Federal Theatre Project production of the play , with an African @-@ American cast that included Canada Lee in the role of Banquo . 
 Film adaptations have approached Banquo 's character in a variety of ways . Akira Kurosawa 's 1957 adaptation Throne of Blood makes the character into Capitan Miki ( played by Minoru Chiaki ) , slain by Macbeth 's equivalent ( Captain Washizu ) when his wife explains that she is with child . News of Miki 's death does not reach Washizu until after he has seen the ghost in the banquet scene . In Roman Polanski 's 1971 adaptation , Banquo is played by acclaimed stage actor Martin Shaw , in a style reminiscent of earlier stage performances . Polanski 's version also emphasises Banquo 's objection to Macbeth 's ascendency by showing him remaining silent as the other thanes around him hail Macbeth as <unk> in the 1990 telling of Macbeth in a New York Mafia crime family setting , Men of Respect , the character of Banquo is named " <unk> Como " and played by American actor Dennis Farina .

 The main event scripted into Backlash on the Raw brand was a Fatal Four Way match for the WWE Championship , a standard match involving four wrestlers between John Cena , Edge , Shawn Michaels and Randy Orton . At the Royal Rumble in January , Michaels was one of the final two participants in the Royal Rumble match , a multi @-@ competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared winner before being eliminated by The Undertaker . On the February 5 , 2007 episode of Raw , Michaels earned the right to become the number @-@ one contender to the WWE Championship at WrestleMania after defeating Edge and Orton in a Triple Threat match , a standard match involving three wrestlers . At WrestleMania , Cena defeated Michaels to retain the WWE Championship , after wrapping his arm around the neck of Michaels in a sleeper hold , a submission referred to as an STFU . On the April 9 episode of Raw , a standard match between Michaels and Orton to determine the number @-@ one contender to the WWE Championship ended in a no contest , after both men 's shoulders were on the mat while they were pinning one another . Later that night , during Edge 's talk show , " The Cutting Edge " , Edge claimed that General Manager Jonathan Coachman , a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer had named him the number @-@ one contender to the WWE title . Honorary General Manager Michael Pena , from the Make @-@ a @-@ Wish Foundation , however , announced that Michaels , Orton , and Edge would face Cena for the title at Backlash in a Fatal Four @-@ Way match , a standard match involving four wrestlers . 
 Another rivalry leading up to the event was between The Undertaker and Batista over the World Heavyweight Championship . At the Royal Rumble in January , The Undertaker won the 2007 Royal Rumble match . As a result , he was given the right to a title match at WrestleMania for any of WWE 's three major championships ( ECW World , World Heavyweight , or WWE ) . On the February 5 episode of Raw , Undertaker teased all three World Champions ( Bobby Lashley , Batista , and John Cena ) . Undertaker then chose World Heavyweight Champion Batista as his opponent to face at WrestleMania 23 . At WrestleMania , The Undertaker defeated Batista to win the World Heavyweight Championship to extend his WrestleMania undefeated streak to 15 @-@ 0 . Their rivalry , however , did not end , as General Manager Theodore Long booked a Last Man Standing match — a match where the first person unable to respond to a ten count by the referee lost — between The Undertaker and Batista at Backlash . 
 The main rivalry on the ECW brand was between Bobby Lashley and Team McMahon ( Umaga , Vince and Shane McMahon ) , in which Lashley and Vince were feuding over the ECW World Championship . The rivalry started on the February 26 episode of Raw , when Lashley was selected by Donald Trump to compete at WrestleMania 23 . Lashley was selected to compete against Vince 's representative , Umaga , in Hair vs. Hair match , a match in which the loser or the loser 's representative would have to get his head shaved bald . At WrestleMania , Lashley defeated Umaga , and after the match , Trump and Lashley shaved Vince 's head bald . On the April 9 episode of Raw , Shane challenged Lashley to a Hair vs. Title match for the ECW World Championship . Shane got himself intentionally disqualified , but did not get his head shaved . After the match , Umaga and Vince and Shane attacked Lashley . After the beating , Vince announced that Lashley would have to defend the ECW World Championship against Team McMahon at Backlash in a three @-@ on @-@ one Handicap match , a match consisting of one team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with numerical superiority such as three against two , or three against one .

Lashley , however , kicked out . Vince then tagged in Umaga , who once again executed a diving splash on Lashley . After being tagged in again , Vince pinned Lashley to win the ECW World Championship and the match for his team . 
 The following match was a Last Man Standing Match for the World Heavyweight Championship between The Undertaker and Batista . One spot in the match saw Undertaker perform a leg drop on Batista and through an announce table . Towards the end of the match , the two fought up the entrance ramp , where Batista gave a spear to The Undertaker off the stage . Neither man was able to get to their feet before the referee counted to ten ; as a result , the match was declared a draw . Due to WWE regulations , a title can not change hands in a Last Man Standing match via a draw , so The Undertaker retained his title . 
 Next was the main event , which saw John Cena defend the WWE Championship against Edge , Randy Orton , and Shawn Michaels in a Fatal Four @-@ Way match . During the opening minutes of the match , Michaels performed a moonsault from the top turnbuckle onto Cena , Edge , and Orton outside the ring . Near the end of the match , Orton attempted to RKO Cena . Cena , however , pushed Orton into Edge , which made Edge execute a Spear to Orton . Cena then performed an FU to Edge . When Cena turned around , Michaels superkicked Cena . When Cena fell , he landed on Orton and the referee counted the pinfall . Cena won the match and retained the WWE Championship .

 Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch continued their rivalry with The Hardys until the two teams had a rematch at Judgment Day for the World Tag Team Championship , which The Hardys won . Chris Benoit and Montel Vontavious Porter also continued their rivalry for the WWE United States Championship , which led to a best 2 out of 3 falls match at Judgment Day , which Porter won . 
 On the May 11 episode of SmackDown ! , The Undertaker defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Batista in a Steel cage match , a match fought within a cage formed by placing four sheets of mesh metal around , in , or against the edges of a wrestling ring . Both men escaped the steel cage at the same time , and The Undertaker was therefore declared still the champion . After the match , Mark Henry returned and attacked The Undertaker . Edge , who was scripted to beat Mr. Kennedy on the May 7 episode of Raw to win the Money in the Bank contract , cashed in his opportunity and defeated The Undertaker to win the World Heavyweight Championship . 
 Team McMahon 's feud with Bobby Lashley continued as Mr. McMahon gave Lashley a rematch at Judgment Day , which was another three @-@ on @-@ one Handicap match for the ECW World Championship . At Judgment Day , Lashley won the match , but Vince said that Lashley had not beaten him , as Lashley had pinned Shane instead , so Lashley was not awarded the belt . The rivalry continued until One Night Stand , where Lashley challenged Vince to a match where there is no disqualifications or countouts , dubbed a Street Fight . Lashley won the match and the ECW World Championship , and their rivalry ended .

 The Many @-@ banded krait ( Bungarus multicinctus ) , also known as the Taiwanese krait or the Chinese krait , is a highly venomous species of elapid snake found in throughout much of central and southern China and Southeast Asia . The species was first described by the scientist Edward Blyth in 1861 . This species has two known subspecies , the nominate Bungarus multicinctus multicinctus , and Bungarus multicinctus <unk> . The many @-@ banded krait mostly inhabits marshy areas throughout its geographical distribution , though it does occur in other habitat types . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Since the species ' description by zoologist and pharmacist , Edward Blyth in 1861 , Bungarus multicinctus has been the binomial of the species . The generic name , Bungarus , is a Latinisation of <unk> <unk> , " krait . " The specific name multicinctus is derived from the Latin multi- , combining form of <unk> , " much , many " , and Latin <unk> , past participle of <unk> , " to encircle " - as in a " band " . The full species name ( Bungarus multicinctus ) thus literally means " banded krait " . The common name " krait " is from Hindi ( <unk> <unk> ) , which is perhaps ultimately derived from the Sanskrit word ( <unk> kāla ) , which means " black " . 
 = = Taxonomy and evolution = = 
 The kraits , as they are commonly known , belong to the family Elapidae and the genus Bungarus . The genus is endemic to the continent of Asia . They are morphologically well connected , forming a close @-@ knit and cohesive unit . The genus has 12 @-@ 13 species who are morphologically distinct from the Naja genus and the Afro @-@ elapids according to McDowell ( 1987 ) . McDowell stated " species diversity is greatest in Africa , but the Asiatic Bungarus and Ophiophagus are each so peculiar in anatomy as to suggest an ancient divergence ” . Others , including Slowinski , believed that the kraits ( Bungarus ) , are part of a clade that clusters with a group including the king cobra ( Ophiophagus <unk> ) and oddly enough , with the African mambas ( Dendroaspis ) on the most @-@ parsimonious tree or with <unk> on the maximum @-@ likelihood tree . This result calls into question the monophyly of cobras and underscores the uncertainty of the homology of the hood spreading behavior in cobras and mambas . The relationships of Dendroaspis , Ophiophagus , and Bungarus differed between the parsimony and likelihood analyses , suggesting that more work is necessary to resolve the relationships of these problematic taxa . McDowell 's findings in regard to the sister @-@ group of Bungarus and the sea snakes ( Hydrophiinae ) family , propose that the kraits might just be a per @-@ mutable clade between the <unk> " palatine @-@ erectors " and the <unk> " palatine <unk> " . Two genera within the <unk> family in particular , support McDowell 's hypothesis . The two genera are <unk> and <unk> due to many shared characteristics . Mao et al ( 1983 ) showed that this species , Bungarus multicinctus was slightly distinct from the other members of its genus and was immunologically more similar to Laticauda , terrestrial Australian elapids , and true sea snakes than it is to <unk> sundevalli ( Sundevall 's garter snake ) , Naja <unk> ( <unk> cobra ) or two Micrurus species ( New World or American coral snakes ) . Minton ( 1981 ) , <unk> et al. and <unk> & Gorman ( 1981 ) all suggested similar things to Mao et al . ( 1983 ) based on immunological data . The many @-@ banded krait was more similar to the Australian elapids , Laticauda and true sea snakes than they were to numerous elapids they were compared to .

It may also be found in Thailand . 
 Although it can be found in elevations up to about 1 @,@ 500 m ( 4 @,@ 900 ft ) , they are far more commonly found in humid lowland areas , most often observed in subtropical to marshy regions of its range . They also are frequently found in shrublands , woodlands , agricultural fields , and mangroves , often adjacent to water , such as rivers , streams , rice paddies , and ditches . They may also sometimes be found in villages and suburban areas . It is able to survive in other habitats also .

 The snake is nocturnal , when it may be more defensive . It is , however , a timid and placid species of snake . In the daytime , it hides under stones or in holes . The snake appears from April and retreats into hibernation in November . It is considered to be more defensive than the Banded krait ( Bungarus fasciatus ) , thrashing about as it is handled . 
 Unlike other Bungarus species , who are primarily snake @-@ eaters , the many @-@ banded krait usually feeds on fish , but it is also preys on other species of snakes , including members of its own species . This species also feeds on rodents , eels , frogs , and occasionally lizards .

 = Something to Remember = 
 Something to Remember is a compilation album by American recording artist Madonna , released by Maverick and Warner Bros. on November 3 , 1995 . The record was conceived after a controversial period in Madonna 's career , when many critics had speculated that her career had declined . In response Madonna composed the album , composed of ballads spanning over a decade of her career , including a reworked version of " Love Don 't Live Here Anymore " and three new songs : " You 'll See " , " One More Chance " and a cover of Marvin Gaye 's " I Want You " . The record also features previously released singles that had never been included on a Madonna album , " I 'll Remember " and " This Used to Be My Playground " , and altogether provided a softer image for the singer during a critical period in her career . 
 For producing the new songs for the album , Madonna worked with David Foster and Nellee Hooper , the former known for his work with such artists as Barbra Streisand and Olivia Newton @-@ John . Madonna stated that the concept for the album was to make fans and critics alike remember her music contributions rather than her media controversies . Something to Remember was well received by music critics who were impressed with Madonna 's vocals and the album 's cohesiveness . It was also a commercial success , topping charts in Australia , Austria , Finland , and Italy , and peaking within top ten elsewhere . In the United States , it reached number six on the Billboard 200 and was certified three times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) for shipments of three million units . Worldwide , Something to Remember has sold over ten million copies . 
 Four singles and one promotional single were released to promote the album . Originally intended as the album 's lead single , " I Want You " was released as the promotional single preceding the album , with a music video directed by Earle Sebastian . " You 'll See " was released as the album 's first single on October 23 , 1995 , accompanied by a Spanish version titled " Verás " and a music video directed by Michael Haussman . The song peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 , while reaching the top five in Austria , Canada , Finland , Italy and the United Kingdom . " Oh Father " , " One More Chance " and " Love Don 't Live Here Anymore " were released as the follow up singles , but gained little commercial response ; the latter received a music video directed by Jean @-@ Baptiste Mondino .

 After a controversy @-@ fueled period , Madonna 's personal life had started to dominate over her musical career . " She knew it was time to make a change " as said by one anonymous member of her management team who claimed that she wanted to prove there was more to her than the constant media circus surrounding her . J. Randy Taraborrelli , author of Madonna : An Intimate Biography , documented that Madonna had previously stated that many of her songs have been overlooked in response to current trends , with her long @-@ time friend and producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï stating " she hasn 't shouted about her musical abilities . " Taraborrelli explained " So , whether Madonna released Something to Remember , a collection of previously released love songs , because she had a point to prove or simply to keep a contractual obligation , the fourteen track recording did make a statement . " Described as a " love letter from Madonna to her fans and music lovers alike " the compilation seemed to notify her contemporaries of her musical talent . On the album 's liner note , Madonna further explained : 
 So much controversy has swirled around my career this past decade that very little attention ever gets paid to my music . The songs are all but forgotten . While I have no regrets regarding the choices I 've made artistically , I 've learned to appreciate the idea of doing things in a simpler way . So without a lot of fanfare , without any distractions , I present to you this collection of ballads . Some are old , some are new . All of them are from my heart . 
 The new material for the album saw her collaboration with a well @-@ known producer David Foster , who had worked with the likes of Barbra Streisand , Al Jarreau and Earth , Wind & Fire . Foster recalled the first time Madonna 's publicist Liz Rosenberg contacting him for a dinner with the singer : " When Madonna first called , I was a little surprised — my music isn 't really hip enough for her — but I guess her camp thought we should meet , and I got a call from Liz Rosenberg , the PR maven who has been with Madonna from the beginning . " Not long after the dinner , Madonna and Foster began the recording session in his Malibu studio . During the album conception , Madonna was also asked by her Bedtime Stories producer Nellee Hooper to collaborate with British trip hop group Massive Attack for a Marvin Gaye tribute album . Previously , the band had offered the collaboration to several artists , including Chaka Khan who rejected it . Madonna and Massive Attack covered Gaye 's 1976 hit " I Want You " , which finished among the new material for Something to Remember and was also included on the Inner City Blues : The Music of Marvin Gaye released by Motown Records .

 The first track selected for use on the compilation album was " Love Don 't Live Here Anymore " from Like a Virgin ( 1984 ) . The track was reworked by producer David Reitzas and features a quite different composition from the 1984 version . Madonna also included two soundtrack singles which had never been featured on her own album , " This Used to Be My Playground " from the 1992 film A League of Their Own and " I 'll Remember " from the 1994 film With Honors . Other previously released material selected for the compilation were " Crazy for You " from Vision Quest ( 1985 ) , " Live to Tell " from True Blue ( 1986 ) , " Oh Father " from Like a Prayer ( 1989 ) , " Something to Remember " from I 'm Breathless ( 1990 ) , " Rain " from Erotica ( 1992 ) , as well as " Take a Bow " and " Forbidden Love " , both from Bedtime Stories ( 1994 ) . Two tracks on the compilation , " Crazy for You " and " Live to Tell " , were overlapping with her first greatest hits album , The Immaculate Collection ( 1990 ) . According to Rikky Rooksby , the author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna , the song selection creates a soft atmosphere , the music is downbeat and " emotionally introverted " with mellow vibes throughout . 
 Madonna 's recording session with David Foster resulted two new songs to the final track listing , " You 'll See " and " One More Chance " . Foster commented : " At the end of the day , the songs we did were not particularly impressive , though one of them , " You 'll See " , was really neat . Madonna had written a great lyric ( You think that I can 't live without your love / You 'll see ) and I thought my music was great . " " You 'll See " is a low bass track featuring wind chimes and a Spanish guitar . Throughout the chord changes progression to give Madonna 's vocals dominance in the song , and after a minute the percussion starts with a tremolo guitar added later . Lyrically , the song talks of independence after the end of a love affair stating that Madonna will go onto greater things . Madonna was asked whether the track was about revenge to which she replied " No , it 's about empowering yourself . " The next original song , " One More Chance " features an acoustic guitar introduction with plenty of chord changes . Lyrically , the song features Madonna attempting to win a lost lover back . Madonna later recorded the Spanish version of " You 'll See " in Gloria and Emilio Estefan 's studio in Miami . Titled " Verás " , the song was adapted into Spanish by Paz Martinez . 
 Nellee Hooper produced another new addition to the compilation , the cover version of Marvin Gaye 's " I Want You " . After Madonna accepted Hooper 's suggestion to collaborate with Massive Attack , the band sent Madonna the music of the song first . Robert " 3D " Del Naja , one of the band members , subsequently went to New York with Hooper and worked in the studio for two days . Del Naja said , " I think the really cool thing about it was the fact that [ Madonna ] sang it so beautifully . There was no special effects , no messing around — it was just in there singing it with a lot of passion and soul . " Musically , the song starts with a long introduction featuring a hip @-@ hop drum beat with emphasis on the bass section of the instrumental alongside a semi @-@ tonal string figure . The second verse features a harp and a repeating drum loop accompanied with a telephone style bleeping sound . Madonna 's vocals at times are accompanied by spoken passages with her overall vocals dominating the track , with lyrics discussing a man that no longer wants her , while she is determined to change his mind . The compilation also features the orchestral version of " I Want You " in which the original drum track , bass and percussion are removed . The version starts slower with Madonna 's vocals entering with a low string bass line only , gradually more string arrangements are added with harp and brass featured in the background of the mix . A moment towards the end of the track hears her voice with no accompaniment creating a " dramatic " theme , and overall the version features around 20 seconds less than the original .

 The album 's artwork was shot by fashion photographer Mario Testino . It was originally made for Madonna 's Versace <unk> which appeared on high @-@ fashion magazines . The packaging included with the release showed Madonna looking " deliciously cosmopolitan " as she wore a tight @-@ fit white cocktail attire , while the back cover artwork is predominantly more playful . The front cover artwork presented Madonna leaning against a wall with an expression of " romantic loss or absorption . " Designed as the Madonna album which would appeal to a larger audience in contrast to her previous records , Bedtime Stories and Erotica , the booklet featured red roses inside and a golden yellow flower on the back cover . According to The Guardian writer Caroline Sullivan , the fact that Madonna removed her nose ring for the cover shot indicated she " wants the album to be taken on its own merits . " In 2013 , the artwork was dubbed as one of the " 20 Most Fashionable Album Covers Ever " by the Dutch edition of Elle magazine . The title of the album derives from her 1990 song of the same name since it had received little attention during the release of its original album , I 'm Breathless . 
 Something to Remember was released in some European countries on November 3 , 1995 . In Madonna 's native country , the album was released on November 7 , 1995 . In Japan , the album was released under the title Best of Madonna : Ballad Collection on November 10 , 1995 , containing her 1986 song " La Isla Bonita " as a bonus track . " La Isla Bonita " was re @-@ released three months prior the compilation as a double A @-@ side record with " Human Nature " , the final single from Bedtime Stories . Receiving gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of Japan ( RIAJ ) , the song was added to Something to Remember track listing in the hope of boosting the album sales in the region . In Latin America , the album included the bonus track " Verás " , the Spanish version of " You 'll See " . In 2001 , WEA Records released a box set of Something to Remember and The Immaculate Collection to coincide with the release of Madonna 's second greatest hits package , GHV2 .

 " I Want You " was released as a promotional single from the album on October 2 , 1995 . It was originally intended as the album 's first single , but cancelled due to contract problems between Madonna 's label and Motown Records , the copyright owner of the song . The music video for the song was directed by Earle Sebastian and was nominated for the MTV Amour category at the MTV Europe Music Awards 1996 . " You 'll See " was released as the album 's lead single on October 30 , 1995 . The song reached the top five position in Austria , Canada , Finland , Italy and the United Kingdom . The single managed to peak at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 , making Madonna the third act in history ( after Aretha Franklin and Marvin Gaye ) to have a hit peak at each position from one to ten on the chart . An accompanying music video was directed by Michael Haussman as a sequel to Madonna 's previous music video for " Take a Bow " . 
 " Oh Father " was released as the second single for European market on December 21 , 1995 . It became a top ten hit in Finland and the United Kingdom , but charted weakly in the rest of the continent , resulting a low peak of 62 on the European Hot 100 Singles chart . " One More Chance " received a limited single release in Australia and several European countries on March 7 , 1996 . Despite barely any promotion and no music video , the song still charted as high as number two in Italy and peaked inside the top 40 in Australia , Finland , Sweden and the United Kingdom . " Love Don 't Live Here Anymore " was released as the final single from the album on March 19 , 1996 . The song received poor commercial reception , peaking at number 78 on the Billboard Hot 100 , while reaching the top forty in Australia and Canada . Its accompanying music video was directed in by Jean @-@ Baptiste Mondino at the <unk> El Molino in Buenos Aires , Argentina , during Madonna 's day off from filming Evita . It was shot in a single frame portraying Madonna in an empty suite of an abandoned hotel .

 Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic wrote that " Throughout the album , Madonna proves that she 's a terrific singer whose voice has improved over the years . " He added , " Not one of the tracks is second @-@ rate , and the best songs on Something to Remember rank among the best pop music of the ' 80s and ' 90s " . Neil Strauss of The New York Times felt all the songs on the album " cohere better than a greatest @-@ hits package would " and " they tell a story of their own , of a voice and attitude that have hardened in the dozen years that have elapsed between the bubble @-@ gum @-@ chomping innocence of 1983 's ' Crazy for You ' and the tortured torch singing of the new ' You 'll See ' . " Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly commented : " By placing her greatest @-@ hit ballads ( ' Live to Tell ' , ' Crazy for You ' , ' Take a Bow ' , etc . ) in a new context — that is , separated from her more attention @-@ getting dance music — Madonna reinvigorates them , which is just what a good best @-@ of compilation is supposed to do . The three new songs ' You 'll See ' , ' One More Chance ' , and a wonderfully eerie version of Marvin Gaye 's ' I Want You ' are consumer enticements that just add to the allure . " 
 According to Greg Forman from The Post and Courier , the album shows that " There 's an important difference between having a great voice and being a great singer . Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey can sing circles ( and octaves ) around the most famous woman on the planet , but Madonna , through sheer force of personality sells her slow numbers with a panache few modern singers can match . " John Wirt from The Advocate said that the album shows that Madonna " can craft slow songs as effectively as she knocks out dance numbers " and found " an unaffected simplicity and sincerity " in her ballad singing . Writing for The Baltimore Sun , J. D. Considine believed that with the album " Madonna not only reminds us that there 's more to her music than dance tunes , but also demonstrates that her voice is nowhere near as thin and chirpy as her detractors imagine . " He further explained , " one of the most amazing things about the album is how sultry and assured she sounds ... The Madonna on display here not only has a richer , deeper voice than you imagined , but more interpretive insight as well . " 
 Alwyn W. Turner in the book The Rough Guide to Rock stated that the album features " the best of her slow pieces " displaying that " Madonna had evolved over the years into an excellent ballad singer . " Edna Gundersen from USA Today said that the album " flaunts the less sizzling , though equally galvanizing , highlights of her career . " She was mostly impressed with Madonna 's vocal and emotional power on the track " You 'll See " which became " the clearest proof that the ambitious blonde is more singer than celebrity . " J. Randy Taraborrelli in his book Madonna : An Intimate Biography picked the David Foster produced tracks as standouts , saying " It was interesting that , with all of his [ David Foster ] exciting musical ability from which to draw , he and Madonna would come up with two of the most sombre songs she has ever recorded — but such is the excitement of collaboration ; one never knows what will come of it . " Tirzah Agassi from The Jerusalem Post said the arrangements on the new songs " show a great leap in sophistication " and felt that Madonna " has invested much in improving her vocal technique . " Robert Christgau criticized the album with a " dud " rating , indicating " a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought . "

 = John Hay = 
 John Milton Hay ( October 8 , 1838 – July 1 , 1905 ) was an American statesman and official whose career in government stretched over almost half a century . Beginning as a private secretary and assistant to Abraham Lincoln , Hay 's highest office was United States Secretary of State under Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt . Hay was also an author and biographer , and wrote poetry and other literature throughout much of his life . 
 Born in Indiana to an anti @-@ slavery family that moved to Illinois when he was young , Hay showed great potential , and his family sent him to Brown University . After graduation in 1858 , Hay read law in his uncle 's office in Springfield , Illinois , adjacent to that of Lincoln . Hay worked for Lincoln 's successful presidential campaign , and became one of his private secretaries at the White House . Throughout the American Civil War , Hay was close to Lincoln , and stood by his deathbed after the President was shot at Ford 's Theatre . In addition to his other literary works , Hay co @-@ authored with John George Nicolay a multi @-@ volume biography of Lincoln that helped shape the assassinated president 's historical image . 
 After Lincoln 's death , Hay spent several years at diplomatic posts in Europe , then worked for the New @-@ York Tribune under Horace Greeley and Whitelaw Reid . Yet , Hay remained active in politics , and from 1879 to 1881 served as Assistant Secretary of State . Afterwards , he remained in the private sector , until President McKinley , for whom he had been a major backer , made him Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1897 . Hay became Secretary of State the following year . 
 Hay served for almost seven years as Secretary of State under President McKinley , and after his assassination , under Theodore Roosevelt . Hay was responsible for negotiating the Open Door Policy , which kept China open to trade with all countries on an equal basis , with international powers . By negotiating the Hay – Pauncefote Treaty with the United Kingdom , the ( ultimately unratified ) Hay – Herrán Treaty with Colombia , and finally the Hay – Bunau @-@ Varilla Treaty with the newly @-@ independent Republic of Panama , Hay also cleared the way for the building of the Panama Canal .

 John Milton Hay was born in Salem , Indiana , on October 8 , 1838 . He was the third son of Dr. Charles Hay and the former Helen Leonard . Charles Hay , born in Lexington , Kentucky , hated slavery , and moved to the North in the early 1830s . A doctor , he practiced in Salem and married there in 1831 . Helen 's father , David Leonard , had moved his family west from <unk> , Massachusetts , in 1818 , but died en route to Vincennes , Indiana , and Helen relocated to Salem in 1830 to teach school . Charles was not successful in Salem , and moved , with his wife and children , to Warsaw , Illinois , in 1841 . 
 John attended the local schools , and in 1849 his uncle Milton Hay invited John to live at his home in Pittsfield , Pike County , and attend a well @-@ regarded local school , the John D. Thomson Academy . Milton was a friend of Springfield attorney Abraham Lincoln , and had read law in the firm Stuart and Lincoln . In Pittsfield , John first met John Nicolay , who was at the time a 20 @-@ year @-@ old newspaperman . Once John Hay completed his studies there , the 13 @-@ year @-@ old was sent to live with his grandfather in Springfield , and attend school there . His parents and uncle Milton ( who financed the boy 's education ) sent him to Brown University in Providence , Rhode Island , alma mater of his late maternal grandfather . 
 = = = Student and Lincoln supporter = = = 
 Hay enrolled at Brown in 1855 . Although he enjoyed college life , he did not find it easy : his Western clothing and accent made him stand out ; he was not well prepared academically and was often sick . Hay gained a reputation as a star student , and became a part of Providence 's literary circle that included Sarah Helen Whitman and Nora Perry . He wrote poetry , and experimented with hashish . Hay received his Master of Arts degree in 1858 , and was , like his grandfather before him , Class Poet . He returned to Illinois . Milton Hay had moved his practice to Springfield , and John became a law clerk in his firm , where he could study law . 
 Milton Hay 's firm was one of the most prestigious in Illinois . Lincoln maintained offices next door and was a rising star in the new Republican Party . Hay recalled an early encounter with Lincoln : 
 He came into the law office where I was reading ... with a copy of Harper 's Magazine in hand , containing Senator Douglas 's famous article on Popular Sovereignty . [ whether residents of each territory ] could decide on slavery ] Lincoln seemed greatly roused by what he had read . Entering the office without a salutation , he said : " This will never do . He puts the moral element out of this question . It won 't stay out . " 
 Hay was not a supporter of Lincoln for president until after his nomination in 1860 . Hay then made speeches and wrote newspaper articles boosting Lincoln 's candidacy . When Nicolay , who had been made Lincoln 's private secretary for the campaign , found he needed help with the huge amounts of correspondence , Hay worked full @-@ time for Lincoln for six months . 
 Lincoln was elected . Nicolay , who continued as Lincoln 's private secretary , recommended that Hay be hired to assist him at the White House . Lincoln is reported to have said , " We can 't take all Illinois with us down to Washington " but then " Well , let Hay come " . Kushner and Sherrill were dubious about " the story of Lincoln 's offhand appointment of Hay " as fitting well into Hay 's self @-@ image of never having been an office @-@ seeker , but " poorly into the realities of Springfield politics of the 1860s " — Hay must have expected some reward for handling Lincoln 's correspondence for months . Hay biographer John Taliaferro suggests that Lincoln engaged Nicolay and Hay to assist him , rather than more seasoned men , both " out of loyalty and surely because of the competence and compatibility that his two young aides had demonstrated " . Historian Joshua Zeitz argues that Lincoln was moved to hire Hay when Milton agreed to pay his nephew 's salary for six months .

 = = = Secretary to Lincoln = = = 
 Milton Hay desired that his nephew go to Washington as a qualified attorney , and John Hay was admitted to the bar in Illinois on February 4 , 1861 . On February 11 , he embarked with President @-@ elect Lincoln on a circuitous journey to Washington . By this time , several Southern states had seceded to form the Confederate States of America in reaction to the election of Lincoln , seen as an opponent of slavery . When Lincoln was sworn in on March 4 , Hay and Nicolay moved into the White House , sharing a shabby bedroom . As there was only authority for payment of one presidential secretary ( Nicolay ) , Hay was appointed to a post in the Interior Department at $ 1 @,@ 600 per year , seconded to service at the White House . They were available to Lincoln 24 hours a day . As Lincoln took no vacations as president and worked seven days a week , often until 11 pm ( or later , during crucial battles ) the burden on his secretaries was heavy . 
 Hay and Nicolay divided their responsibilities : Nicolay tending to assist Lincoln in his office and in meetings , while Hay dealt with the correspondence , which was very large . Both men tried to shield Lincoln from office @-@ seekers and others who wanted to meet with the President . Unlike the dour Nicolay , Hay , with his charm , escaped much of the hard feelings from those denied Lincoln 's presence . Abolitionist Thomas Wentworth Higginson described Hay as " a nice young fellow , who unfortunately looks about seventeen and is oppressed with the necessity of behaving like seventy " . Hay continued to write , anonymously , for newspapers , sending in columns calculated to make Lincoln appear a sorrowful man , religious and competent , giving of his life and health to preserve the Union . Similarly , Hay served as what Taliaferro deemed a " White House propagandist " , in his columns explaining away losses such as that at First Manassas in July 1861 . 
 Despite the heavy workload — Hay wrote that he was busy 20 hours a day — he tried to make as normal a life as possible , eating his meals with Nicolay at Willard 's Hotel , going to the theatre with Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln , and reading Les Misérables in French . Hay , still in his early 20s , spent time both in <unk> and at cultured get @-@ togethers in the homes of Washington 's elite . The two secretaries often clashed with Mary Lincoln , who resorted to various stratagems to get the dilapidated White House restored without depleting Lincoln 's salary , which had to cover entertainment and other expenses . Despite the secretaries ' objections , Mrs. Lincoln was generally the victor , and managed to save almost 70 % of her husband 's salary in his four years in office . 
 After the death of Lincoln 's 11 @-@ year @-@ old son Willie in February 1862 ( an event not mentioned in Hay 's diary or correspondence ) , " it was Hay who became , if not a surrogate son , then a young man who stirred a higher form of parental nurturing that Lincoln , despite his best intentions , did not successfully bestow on either of his surviving children " . According to Hay biographer Robert Gale , " Hay came to adore Lincoln for his goodness , patience , understanding , sense of humor , humility , magnanimity , sense of justice , healthy skepticism , resilience and power , love of the common man , and mystical patriotism " . Speaker of the House Galusha Grow stated , " Lincoln was very much attached to him " ; writer Charles G. <unk> , who knew Hay then , later recorded that " Lincoln loved him as a son " . 
 Hay and Nicolay accompanied Lincoln to Gettysburg , Pennsylvania , for the dedication of the cemetery there , where were interred many of those who fell at the Battle of Gettysburg . Although they made much of Lincoln 's brief Gettysburg Address in their 1890 multi @-@ volume biography of Lincoln , Hay 's diary states " the President , in a firm , free way , with more grace than is his wont , said his half @-@ dozen lines of consecration . " 
 = = = Presidential emissary = = = 
 Lincoln sent Hay away from the White House on various missions . In August 1861 , Hay escorted Mary Lincoln and her children to Long Branch , New Jersey , a resort on the Jersey Shore , both as their caretaker and as a means of giving Hay a much @-@ needed break . The following month , Lincoln sent him to Missouri to deliver a letter to Union General John C. Frémont , who had irritated the President with military blunders and by freeing local slaves without authorization , endangering Lincoln 's attempts to keep the border states in the Union . 
 In April 1863 , Lincoln sent Hay to the Union @-@ occupied South Carolina coast to report back on the ironclad vessels being used in an attempt to recapture Charleston Harbor . Hay then went on to the Florida coast . He returned to Florida in January 1864 , after Lincoln had announced his Ten Percent Plan , that if ten percent of the 1860 electorate in a state took oaths of loyalty and to support emancipation , they could form a government with federal protection . Lincoln considered Florida , with its small population , a good test case , and made Hay a major , sending him to see if he could get sufficient men to take the oath . Hay spent a month in the state during February and March 1864 , but Union defeats there reduced the area under federal control . Believing his mission impractical , he sailed back to Washington . 
 In July 1864 , New York publisher Horace Greeley sent word to Lincoln that there were Southern peace emissaries in Canada . Lincoln doubted that they actually spoke for Confederate President Jefferson Davis , but had Hay journey to New York to persuade the publisher to go to Niagara Falls , Ontario , to meet with them and bring them to Washington . Greeley reported to Lincoln that the emissaries lacked accreditation by Davis , but were confident they could bring both sides together . Lincoln sent Hay to Ontario with what became known as the Niagara Manifesto : that if the South laid down its arms , freed the slaves , and reentered the Union , it could expect liberal terms on other points . The Southerners refused to come to Washington to negotiate . 
 = = = Assassination of Lincoln = = = 
 By the end of 1864 , with Lincoln reelected and the victorious war winding down , both Hay and Nicolay let it be known that they desired different jobs . Soon after Lincoln 's second inauguration in March 1865 , the two secretaries were appointed to the US delegation in Paris , Nicolay as consul and Hay as secretary of legation . Hay wrote to his brother Charles that the appointment was " entirely unsolicited and unexpected " , a statement that Kushner and Sherrill found unconvincing given that Hay had spent hundreds of hours during the war with Secretary of State William H. Seward , who had often discussed personal and political matters with him , and the close relationship between the two men was so well known that office @-@ seekers cultivated Hay as a means of getting to Seward . The two men were also motivated to find new jobs by their deteriorating relationship with Mary Lincoln , who sought their ouster , and by Nicolay 's desire to wed his intended — he could not bring a bride to his shared room at the White <unk> remained at the White House pending the arrival and training of replacements . 
 Hay did not accompany the Lincolns to Ford 's Theatre on the night of April 14 , 1865 , but remained at the White House , drinking whiskey with Robert Lincoln . When the two were informed that the President had been shot , they hastened to the Petersen House , a boarding house where the stricken Lincoln had been taken . Hay remained by Lincoln 's deathbed through the night and was present when he died . Hay saw , at the moment of Lincoln 's death , " a look of unspeakable peace came upon his worn features " . He heard War Secretary Edwin Stanton 's declaration , " Now he belongs to the ages . " 
 According to Kushner and Sherrill , " Lincoln 's death was for Hay a personal loss , like the loss of a father ... Lincoln 's assassination erased any remaining doubts Hay had about Lincoln 's greatness . " In 1866 , in a personal letter , Hay deemed Lincoln , " the greatest character since Christ " . Taliaferro noted that " Hay would spend the rest of his life mourning Lincoln ... wherever Hay went and whatever he did , Lincoln would always be watching " .

 Hay sailed for Paris at the end of June 1865 . There , he served under U.S. Minister to France John Bigelow . The workload was not heavy , and Hay found time to enjoy the pleasures of Paris . When Bigelow resigned in mid @-@ 1866 , Hay , as was customary , submitted his resignation , though he was asked to remain until Bigelow 's successor was in place , and stayed until January 1867 . He consulted with Secretary of State William H. Seward , asking him for " anything worth having " . Seward suggested the post of Minister to Sweden , but reckoned without the new president , Andrew Johnson , who had his own candidate . Seward offered Hay a job as his private secretary , but Hay declined , and returned home to Warsaw . 
 Initially happy to be home , Hay quickly grew restive , and he was glad to hear , in early June 1867 , that he had been appointed secretary of legation to act as chargé d 'affaires at Vienna . He sailed for Europe the same month , and while in England visited the House of Commons , where he was greatly impressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer , Benjamin Disraeli . The Vienna post was only temporary , until Johnson could appoint a chargé d 'affaires and have him confirmed by the Senate , and the workload was light , allowing Hay , who was fluent in German , to spend much of his time traveling . It was not until July 1868 that Henry Watts became Hay 's replacement . Hay resigned , spent the remainder of the summer in Europe , then went home to Warsaw . 
 Unemployed again , in December 1868 Hay journeyed to the capital , writing to Nicolay that he " came to Washington in the peaceful pursuit of a fat office . But there is nothing just now available " . Seward promised to " wrestle with Andy for anything that turns up " , but nothing did prior to the departure of both Seward and Johnson from office on March 4 , 1869 . In May , Hay went back to Washington from Warsaw to press his case with the new Grant administration . The next month , due to the influence of his friends , he obtained the post of secretary of legation in Spain . 
 Although the salary was low , Hay was interested in serving in Madrid both because of the political situation there — Queen Isabella II had recently been deposed — and because the U.S. Minister was the swashbuckling former congressman , General Daniel Sickles . Hay hoped to assist Sickles in gaining U.S. control over Cuba , then a Spanish colony . Sickles was unsuccessful and Hay resigned in May 1870 , citing the low salary , but remaining in his post until September . Two legacies of Hay 's time in Madrid were magazine articles he wrote that became the basis of his first book , Castilian Days , and his lifelong friendship with Sickles 's personal secretary , Alvey A. Adee , who would be a close aide to Hay at the State Department .

 = = = Tribune and marriage = = = 
 While still in Spain , Hay had been offered the position of assistant editor at the New @-@ York Tribune — both the editor , Horace Greeley , and his managing editor , Whitelaw Reid , were anxious to hire Hay . He joined the staff in October 1870 . The Tribune was the leading reform newspaper in New York , and through mail subscriptions , the largest @-@ circulating newspaper in the nation . Hay wrote editorials for the Tribune , and Greeley soon proclaimed him the most brilliant writer of " <unk> " ( as they were called ) that he had ever had . 
 With his success as an editorial writer , Hay 's duties expanded . In October 1871 , he journeyed to Chicago after the great fire there , interviewing Mrs. O 'Leary , whose cow was said to have started the blaze , describing her as " a woman with a lamp [ who went ] to the barn behind the house , to milk the cow with the crumpled temper , that kicked the lamp , that spilled the kerosene , that fired the straw that burned Chicago " . His work at the Tribune came as his fame as a poet was reaching its peak , and one colleague described it as " a liberal education in the delights of intellectual life to sit in intimate companionship with John Hay and watch the play of that well @-@ stored and brilliant mind " . In addition to writing , Hay was signed by the prestigious Boston Lyceum Bureau , whose clients included Mark Twain and Susan B. Anthony , to give lectures on the prospects for democracy in Europe , and on his years in the Lincoln White House . 
 By the time President Grant ran for reelection in 1872 , Grant 's administration had been rocked by scandal , and some disaffected members of his party formed the Liberal Republicans , naming Greeley as their candidate for president , a nomination soon joined in by the Democrats . Hay was unenthusiastic about the editor @-@ turned @-@ candidate , and in his editorials mostly took aim at Grant , who , despite the scandals , remained <unk> , and who won a landslide victory in the election . Greeley died only weeks later , a broken man . Hay 's stance endangered his hitherto sterling credentials in the Republican Party . 
 By 1873 , Hay was wooing Clara Stone , daughter of Cleveland multimillionaire railroad and banking mogul Amasa Stone . The success of his suit ( they married in 1874 ) made the salary attached to office a small consideration for the rest of his life . Amasa Stone needed someone to watch over his investments , and wanted Hay to move to Cleveland to fill the post . Although the Hays initially lived in John 's New York apartment and later in a townhouse there , they moved in June 1875 to Stone 's ornate home on Cleveland 's Euclid Avenue , " Millionaire 's Row " , and a mansion was quickly under construction for the Hays next @-@ door . The Hays had four children , Helen Hay Whitney , Adelbert Barnes Hay , Alice Evelyn Hay Wadsworth Boyd , and Clarence Leonard Hay . Their father proved successful as a money manager , though he devoted much of his time to literary and political activities , writing to Adee that " I do nothing but read and yawn " . 
 On December 29 , 1876 , a bridge over Ohio 's Ashtabula River collapsed . The bridge had been built from metal cast at one of Stone 's mills , and was carrying a train owned and operated by Stone 's Lake Shore and Michigan Railway . Ninety @-@ two people died ; it was the worst rail disaster in American history up to that point . Blame fell heavily on Stone , who departed for Europe to recuperate and left Hay in charge of his businesses . The summer of 1877 was marked by labor disputes ; a strike over wage cuts on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad soon spread to the Lake Shore , much to Hay 's outrage . He blamed foreign agitators for the dispute , and vented his anger over the strike in his only novel , The Bread @-@ Winners ( 1883 ) . 
 = = = Return to politics = = = 
 Hay remained disaffected from the Republican Party in the mid @-@ 1870s . Seeking a candidate of either party he could support as a reformer , he watched as his favored Democrat , Samuel Tilden , gained his party 's nomination , but his favored Republican , James G. Blaine , did not , falling to Ohio Governor Rutherford B. Hayes , whom Hay did not support during the campaign . Hayes 's victory in the election left Hay an outsider as he sought a return to politics , and he was initially offered no place in the new administration . Nevertheless , Hay attempted to ingratiate himself with the new President by sending him a gold ring with a strand of George Washington 's hair , a gesture that Hayes deeply appreciated . Hay spent time working with Nicolay on their Lincoln biography , and traveling in Europe . When Reid , who had succeeded Greeley as editor of the Tribune , was offered the post of Minister to Germany in December 1878 , he turned it down and recommended Hay . Secretary of State William M. Evarts indicated that Hay " had not been active enough in political efforts " , to Hay 's regret , who told Reid that he " would like a second @-@ class mission uncommonly well " . 
 From May to October 1879 , Hay set out to reconfirm his credentials as a loyal Republican , giving speeches in support of candidates and attacking the Democrats . In October , President and Mrs. Hayes came to a reception at Hay 's Cleveland home . When Assistant Secretary of State Frederick W. Seward resigned later that month , Hay was offered his place and accepted , after some hesitancy because he was considering running for Congress . 
 In Washington , Hay oversaw a staff of eighty employees , renewed his acquaintance with his friend Henry Adams , and substituted for Evarts at Cabinet meetings when the Secretary was out of town . In 1880 , he campaigned for the Republican nominee for president , his fellow Ohioan , Congressman James A. Garfield . Hay felt that Garfield did not have enough backbone , and hoped that Reid and others would " inoculate him with the gall which I fear he lacks " . Garfield consulted Hay before and after his election as president on appointments and other matters , but offered Hay only the post of private secretary ( though he promised to increase its pay and power ) , and Hay declined . Hay resigned as assistant secretary effective March 31 , 1881 , and spent the next seven months as acting editor of the Tribune during Reid 's extended absence in Europe . Garfield 's death in September and Reid 's return the following month left Hay again on the outside of political power , looking in . He would spend the next fifteen years in that position .

 After 1881 , Hay did not again hold public office until 1897 . Amasa Stone committed suicide in 1883 ; his death left the Hays very wealthy . They spent several months in most years traveling in Europe . The Lincoln biography absorbed some of Hay 's time , the hardest work being done with Nicolay in 1884 and 1885 ; beginning in 1886 , portions began appearing serially , and the ten @-@ volume biography was published in 1890 . 
 In 1884 , Hay and Adams commissioned architect Henry Hobson Richardson to construct houses for them on Washington 's Lafayette Square ; these were completed by 1886 . Hay 's house , facing the White House and fronting on Sixteenth Street , was described even before completion as " the finest house in Washington " . The price for the combined tract , purchased from William Wilson Corcoran , was $ 73 @,@ 800 , of which Adams paid a third for his lot . Hay budgeted the construction cost at $ 50 @,@ 000 ; his ornate , 12 @,@ 000 square feet ( 1 @,@ 100 m2 ) mansion eventually cost over twice that . Despite their possession of two lavish houses , the Hays spent less than half the year in Washington and only a few weeks a year in Cleveland . They also spent time at The Fells , their summer residence in Newbury , New Hampshire . According to Gale , " for a full decade before his appointment in 1897 as ambassador to England , Hay was lazy and uncertain . " 
 Hay continued to devote much of his energy to Republican politics . In 1884 , he supported Blaine for president , donating considerable sums to the senator 's unsuccessful campaign against New York Governor Grover Cleveland . Many of Hay 's friends were unenthusiastic about Blaine 's candidacy , to Hay 's anger , and he wrote to editor Richard Watson Gilder , " I have never been able to appreciate the logic that induces some excellent people every four years because they cannot nominate the candidate they prefer to vote for the party they don 't prefer . " In 1888 , Hay had to follow his own advice as his favored candidate , Ohio Senator John Sherman , was unsuccessful at the Republican convention . After some reluctance , Hay supported the nominee , former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison , who was elected . Though Harrison appointed men whom Hay supported , including Blaine , Reid , and Robert Lincoln , Hay was not asked to serve in the Harrison administration . In 1890 , Hay spoke for Republican congressional candidates , addressing a rally of 10 @,@ 000 people in New York City , but the party was defeated , losing control of Congress . Hay contributed funds to Harrison 's unsuccessful re @-@ election effort , in part because Reid had been made Harrison 's 1892 running mate . 
 = = = = McKinley backer = = = = 
 Hay was an early supporter of Ohio 's William McKinley , and worked closely with McKinley 's political manager , Cleveland industrialist Mark Hanna . In 1889 , Hay supported McKinley in his unsuccessful effort to become Speaker of the House . Four years later , McKinley — by then Governor of Ohio — faced a crisis when a friend whose notes he had imprudently co @-@ signed went bankrupt during the Panic of 1893 . The debts were beyond the governor 's means to pay , and the possibility of insolvency threatened McKinley 's promising political career . Hay was among those Hanna called upon to contribute , buying up $ 3 @,@ 000 of the debt of over $ 100 @,@ 000 . Although others paid more , " Hay 's checks were two of the first , and his touch was more personal , a kindness McKinley never forgot " . The governor wrote , " How can I ever repay you & other dear friends ? " 
 The same panic that nearly ruined McKinley convinced Hay that men like himself must take office to save the country from disaster . By the end of 1894 , he was deeply involved in efforts to lay the groundwork for the governor 's 1896 presidential bid . It was Hay 's job to persuade potential supporters that McKinley was worth backing . Nevertheless , Hay found time for a lengthy stay in New Hampshire — one visitor at The Fells in mid @-@ 1895 was Rudyard Kipling — and later in the year wrote , " The summer wanes and I have done nothing for McKinley . " He atoned with a $ 500 check to Hanna , the first of many that were to follow . During the winter of 1895 – 96 , Hay passed along what he heard from other Republicans influential in Washington , such as Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge . 
 Hay spent part of the spring and early summer of 1896 in the United Kingdom , and elsewhere in Europe . There was a border dispute between Venezuela and British Guiana , and Cleveland 's Secretary of State , Richard Olney , supported the Venezuelan position . Hay told British politicians that McKinley , if elected , would be unlikely to change course . McKinley was nominated in June 1896 ; still , many Britons were minded to support whoever became the Democratic candidate . This changed when the 1896 Democratic National Convention nominated former Nebraska congressman William Jennings Bryan on a " free silver " platform ; he had electrified the delegates with his Cross of Gold speech . Hay reported to McKinley when he returned to Britain after a brief stay on the Continent during which Bryan was nominated in Chicago : " they were all scared out of their wits for fear Bryan would be elected , and very polite in their references to you . " 
 Once Hay returned to the United States in early August , he went to The Fells and watched from afar as Bryan barnstormed the nation in his campaign while McKinley gave speeches from his front porch . Despite an invitation from the candidate , Hay was reluctant to visit McKinley at his home in Canton . " He has asked me to come , but I thought I would not struggle with the millions on his trampled lawn " . In October , after basing himself at his Cleveland home and giving a speech for McKinley , Hay went to Canton at last , writing to Adams , 
 I had been dreading it for a month , thinking it would be like talking in a boiler factory . But he met me at the [ railroad ] station , gave me meat & took me upstairs and talked for two hours as calmly & serenely as if we were summer boarders in Bethlehem , at a loss for means to kill time . I was more struck than ever with his mask . It is a genuine Italian ecclesiastical face of the XVth Century . 
 Hay was disgusted by Bryan 's speeches , writing in language that Taliaferro compares to The Bread @-@ Winners that the Democrat " simply reiterates the unquestioned truths that every man with a clean shirt is a thief and ought to be hanged : that there is no goodness and wisdom except among the illiterate & criminal classes " . Despite Bryan 's strenuous efforts , McKinley won the election easily , with a campaign run by himself and Hanna , and well @-@ financed by supporters like Hay . Henry Adams later wondered , " I would give six @-@ pence to know how much Hay paid for McKinley . His politics must have cost . " 
 = = Ambassador = = 
 = = = Appointment = = = 
 In the post @-@ election speculation as to who would be given office under McKinley , Hay 's name figured prominently , as did that of Whitelaw Reid ; both men sought high office in the State Department , either as secretary or one of the major ambassadorial posts . Reid , in addition to his vice @-@ presidential run , had been Minister to France under Harrison . Reid , an asthmatic , handicapped himself by departing for Arizona Territory for the winter , leading to speculation about his health . 
 Hay was faster than Reid to realize that the race for these posts would be affected by Hanna 's desire to be senator from Ohio , as with one of the state 's places about to be occupied by the newly elected Joseph B. Foraker , the only possible seat for him was that held by Senator Sherman . As the septuagenarian senator had served as Treasury Secretary under Hayes , only the secretaryship of state was likely to attract him and cause a vacancy that Hanna could fill . Hay knew that with only eight cabinet positions , only one could go to an Ohioan , and so Hay had no chance for a cabinet post . Accordingly , Hay encouraged Reid to seek the State position , while firmly ruling himself out as a possible candidate for that post , and quietly seeking the inside track to be ambassador in London . Zeitz states that Hay " aggressively lobbied " for the position . 
 According to Taliaferro , " only after the deed was accomplished and Hay was installed as the ambassador to the Court of St. James 's would it be possible to detect just how subtly and completely he had finessed his ally and friend , Whitelaw Reid " . A telegraph from Hay to McKinley in the latter 's papers , dated December 26 ( most likely 1896 ) reveals the former 's suggestion that McKinley tell Reid that the editor 's friends had insisted that Reid not endanger his health through office , especially in London 's <unk> climes . The following month , in a letter , Hay set forth his own case for the ambassadorship , and urged McKinley to act quickly , as suitable accommodations in London would be difficult to secure . Hay gained his object ( as did Hanna ) , and shifted his focus to appeasing Reid . Taliaferro states that Reid never blamed Hay , but Kushner and Sherrill recorded , " Reid was certain that he had been wronged " by Hay , and the announcement of Hay 's appointment nearly ended their 26 @-@ year friendship . 
 Reaction to Hay 's appointment in Britain was generally positive , with George Smalley of The Times writing to him , " we want a man who is a true American yet not anti @-@ English " . Hay secured a Georgian house on Carlton House Terrace , overlooking Horse Guards Parade , with 11 servants . He brought with him Clara , their own silver , two carriages , and five horses . Hay 's salary of $ 17 @,@ 000 " did not even begin to cover the cost of their extravagant lifestyle " . 
 = = = Service = = = 
 During his service as ambassador , Hay attempted to advance the relationship between the U.S. and Britain . The latter country had long been seen negatively by many Americans , legacy of its colonial role and refreshed by its Civil War neutrality , when British @-@ built raiders such as the Alabama preyed on US @-@ flagged ships . In spite of these past differences , according to Taliaferro , " rapprochement made more sense than at any time in their respective histories " . In his Thanksgiving Day address to the American Society in London in 1897 , Hay echoed these points , " The great body of people in the United States and England are friends ... [ sharing ] that intense respect and reverence for order , liberty , and law which is so profound a sentiment in both countries " . Although Hay was not successful in resolving specific controversies in his year and a third as ambassador , both he and British policymakers regarded his tenure as a success , because of the advancement of good feelings and cooperation between the two nations . 
 An ongoing dispute between the U.S. and Britain was over the practice of pelagic sealing , that is , the capture of seals offshore of Alaska . The U.S. considered them American resources ; the Canadians ( Britain was still responsible for that dominion 's foreign policy ) contended that the mammals were being taken on the high seas , free to all . Soon after Hay 's arrival , McKinley sent former Secretary of State John W. Foster to London to negotiate the issue . Foster quickly issued an accusatory note to the British that was printed in the newspapers . Although Hay was successful in getting Lord Salisbury , then both Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary , to agree to a conference to decide the matter , the British withdrew when the U.S. also invited Russia and Japan , rendering the conference ineffective . Another issue on which no agreement was reached was that of bimetallism : McKinley had promised silver @-@ leaning Republicans to seek an international agreement varying the price ratio between silver and gold to allow for free coinage of silver , and Hay was instructed to seek British participation . The British would only join if the Indian colonial government ( on a silver standard until 1893 ) was willing ; this did not occur , and coupled with an improving economic situation that decreased support for bimetallism in the United States , no agreement was reached . 
 Hay had little involvement in the crisis over Cuba that culminated in the Spanish – American War . He met with Lord Salisbury in October 1897 and gained assurances Britain would not intervene if the U.S. found it necessary to go to war against Spain . Hay 's role was " to make friends and to pass along the English point of view to Washington " . Hay spent much of early 1898 on an extended trip to the Middle East , and did not return to London until the last week of March , by which time the USS Maine had exploded in Havana harbor . During the war , he worked to ensure <unk> amity , and British acceptance of the U.S. occupation of the Philippines — Salisbury and his government preferred that the U.S. have the islands than have them fall into the hands of the Germans . 
 In its early days , Hay described the war " as necessary as it is righteous " . In July , writing to former Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt , who had gained wartime glory by leading the Rough Riders volunteer regiment , Hay made a description of the war for which , according to Zeitz , he " is best remembered by many students of American history " : 
 It has been a splendid little war , begun with the highest motives , carried on with magnificent intelligence and spirit , favored by that Fortune that loves the brave . It is now to be concluded , I hope , with that fine good nature , which is , after all , the distinguishing trait of the American character . 
 Secretary Sherman had resigned on the eve of war , and been replaced by his first assistant , William R. Day . One of McKinley 's Canton cronies , with little experience of statecraft , Day was never intended as more than a temporary wartime replacement . With America about to splash her flag across the Pacific , McKinley needed a secretary with stronger credentials . On August 14 , 1898 , Hay received a telegram from McKinley that Day would head the American delegation to the peace talks with Spain , and that Hay would be the new Secretary of State . After some indecision , Hay , who did not think he could decline and still remain as ambassador , accepted . British response to Hay 's promotion was generally positive , and Queen Victoria , after he took formal leave of her at Osborne House , invited him again the following day , and subsequently pronounced him , " the most interesting of all the Ambassadors I have known . "

 John Hay was sworn in as Secretary of State on September 30 , 1898 . He needed little introduction to Cabinet meetings , and sat at the President 's right hand . Meetings were held in the Cabinet Room of the White House , where he found his old office and bedroom each occupied by several clerks . Now responsible for 1 @,@ 300 federal employees , he leaned heavily for administrative help on his old friend Alvey Adee , the second assistant . 
 By the time Hay took office , the war was effectively over and it had been decided to strip Spain of her overseas empire and transfer at least part of it to the United States . At the time of Hay 's swearing @-@ in , McKinley was still undecided whether to take the Philippines , but in October finally decided to do so , and Hay sent instructions to Day and the other peace commissioners to insist on it . Spain yielded , and the result was the Treaty of Paris , narrowly ratified by the Senate in February 1899 over the objections of anti @-@ imperialists . 
 = = = = Open Door Policy = = = = 
 By the 1890s , China had become a major trading partner for Western nations , and for Japan . China lacked military muscle to resist these countries , and several , including Russia , Britain , and Germany , had carved off bits of China — some known as treaty ports — for use as trading or military bases . Within those jurisdictions , the nation in possession often gave preference to its own citizens in trade or in developing infrastructure such as railroads . Although the United States did not claim any parts of China , a third of the China trade was carried in American ships , and having an outpost near there was a major factor in deciding to retain the former Spanish colony of the Philippines in the Treaty of Paris . 
 Hay had been concerned about the Far East since the 1870s . As Ambassador , he had attempted to forge a common policy with the British , but the United Kingdom was willing to undertake territorial acquisition in China to guard its interests there whereas McKinley was not . In March 1898 , Hay warned that Russia , Germany , and France were seeking to exclude Britain and America from the China trade , but he was disregarded by Sherman , who accepted assurances from Russia and Germany . 
 McKinley was of the view that equality of opportunity for American trade in China was key to success there , rather than colonial acquisitions ; that Hay shared these views was one reason for his appointment as Secretary of State . Many influential Americans , seeing coastal China being divided into spheres of influence , urged McKinley to join in ; still , in his annual message to Congress in December 1898 , he stated that as long as Americans were not discriminated against , he saw no need for the United States to become " an actor in the scene " . 
 As Secretary of State , it was Hay 's responsibility to put together a workable China policy . He was advised by William Rockhill , an old China hand . Also influential was Charles Beresford , a British Member of Parliament who gave a number of speeches to American businessmen , met with McKinley and Hay , and in a letter to the secretary stated that " it is imperative for American interests as well as our own that the policy of the ' open door ' should be maintained " . <unk> that all would play on an even playing field in China would give the foreign powers little incentive to dismember the Chinese Empire through territorial acquisition . 
 In mid @-@ 1899 , the British inspector of Chinese maritime customs , Alfred Hippisley , visited the United States . In a letter to Rockhill , a friend , he urged that the United States and other powers agree to uniform Chinese tariffs , including in the enclaves . Rockhill passed the letter on to Hay , and subsequently summarized the thinking of Hippisley and others , that there should be " an open market through China for our trade on terms of equality with all other foreigners " . Hay was in agreement , but feared Senate and popular opposition , and wanted to avoid Senate ratification of a treaty . Rockhill drafted the first Open Door note , calling for equality of commercial opportunity for foreigners in China . 
 Hay formally issued his Open Door note on September 6 , 1899 . This was not a treaty , and did not require the approval of the Senate . Most of the powers had at least some caveats , and negotiations continued through the remainder of the year . On March 20 , 1900 , Hay announced that all powers had agreed , and he was not contradicted . Former secretary Day wrote to Hay , congratulating him , " moving at the right time and in the right manner , you have secured a diplomatic triumph in the ' open door ' in China of the first importance to your country " . 
 = = = = Boxer Rebellion = = = = 
 Little thought was given to the Chinese reaction to the Open Door note ; the Chinese minister in Washington , Wu Ting @-@ fang , did not learn of it until he read of it in the newspapers . Among those in China who opposed Western influence there was a movement in Shantung Province , in the north , that became known as the Fists of Righteous Harmony , or Boxers , after the martial arts they practiced . The Boxers were especially angered by missionaries and their converts . As late as June 1900 , Rockhill dismissed the Boxers , contending that they would soon disband . By the middle of that month , the Boxers , joined by imperial troops , had cut the railroad between Peking and the coast , killed many missionaries and converts , and besieged the foreign legations . Hay faced a precarious situation ; how to rescue the Americans trapped in Peking , and how to avoid giving the other powers an excuse to partition China , in an election year when there was already Democrat opposition to what they deemed American imperialism . 
 As American troops were sent to China to relieve the nation 's legation , Hay sent a letter to foreign powers ( often called the Second Open Door note ) , stating while the United States wanted to see lives preserved and the guilty punished , it intended that China not be dismembered . Hay issued this on July 3 , 1900 , suspecting that the powers were quietly making private arrangements to divide up China . Communication between the foreign legations and the outside world had been cut off , and the personnel there were falsely presumed slaughtered , but Hay realized that Minister Wu could get a message in , and Hay was able to establish communication . Hay suggested to the Chinese government that it now cooperate for its own good . When the foreign relief force , principally Japanese but including 2 @,@ 000 Americans , relieved the legations and sacked Peking , China was made to pay a huge indemnity but there was no cession of land . 
 = = = = Death of McKinley = = = = 
 McKinley 's vice president , Garret Hobart , had died in November 1899 . Under the laws then in force , this made Hay next in line to the presidency should anything happen to McKinley . There was a presidential election in 1900 , and McKinley was unanimously renominated at the Republican National Convention that year . He allowed the convention to make its own choice of running mate , and it selected Roosevelt , by then Governor of New York . Senator Hanna bitterly opposed that choice , but nevertheless raised millions for the McKinley / Roosevelt ticket , which was elected . 
 Hay accompanied McKinley on his nationwide train tour in mid @-@ 1901 , during which both men visited California and saw the Pacific Ocean for the only times in their lives . The summer of 1901 was tragic for Hay ; his older son Adelbert , who had been consul in Pretoria during the Boer War and was about to become McKinley 's personal secretary , died in a fall from a New Haven hotel window . 
 Secretary Hay was at The Fells when McKinley was shot by Leon Czolgosz , an anarchist , on September 6 in Buffalo . With Vice President Roosevelt and much of the cabinet hastening to the bedside of McKinley , who had been operated on ( it was thought successfully ) soon after the shooting , Hay planned to go to Washington to manage the communication with foreign governments , but presidential secretary George Cortelyou urged him to come to Buffalo . He traveled to Buffalo on September 10 ; hearing on his arrival an account of the President 's recovery , Hay responded that McKinley would die . He was more cheerful after visiting McKinley , giving a statement to the press , and went to Washington , as Roosevelt and other officials also dispersed . Hay was about to return to New Hampshire on the 13th , when word came that McKinley was dying . Hay remained at his office and the next morning , on the way to Buffalo , the former Rough Rider received from Hay his first communication as head of state , officially informing President Roosevelt of McKinley 's death . 
 = = = Theodore Roosevelt administration = = = 
 = = = = Staying on = = = = 
 Hay , again next in line to the presidency , remained in Washington as McKinley 's body was transported to the capital by funeral train , and stayed there as the late president was taken to Canton for interment . He had admired McKinley , describing him as " awfully like Lincoln in many respects " and wrote to a friend , " what a strange and tragic fate it has been of mine — to stand by the bier of three of my dearest friends , Lincoln , Garfield , and McKinley , three of the gentlest of men , all risen to be head of the State , and all done to death by assassins " . 
 By letter , Hay offered his resignation to Roosevelt while the new president was still in Buffalo , amid newspaper speculation that Hay would be replaced — Garfield 's Secretary of State , Blaine , had not remained long under the Arthur administration . When Hay met the funeral train in Washington , Roosevelt greeted him at the station and immediately told him he must stay on as Secretary . According to Zeitz , " Roosevelt 's accidental ascendance to the presidency made John Hay an essential anachronism ... the wise elder statesman and senior member of the cabinet , he was indispensable to TR , who even today remains the youngest president ever " . 
 The deaths of his son and of McKinley were not the only griefs Hay suffered in 1901 — on September 26 , John Nicolay died after a long illness , as did Hay 's close friend Clarence King on Christmas Eve .

 Hay 's involvement in the efforts to have a canal joining the oceans in Central America went back to his time as Assistant Secretary of State under Hayes , when he served as translator for Ferdinand de Lesseps in his efforts to interest the American government in investing in his canal company . President Hayes was only interested in the idea of a canal under American control , which de Lesseps 's project would not be . By the time Hay became Secretary of State , de Lesseps 's project in Panama ( then a Colombian province ) had collapsed , as had an American @-@ run project in Nicaragua . The 1850 Clayton @-@ Bulwer Treaty ( between the United States and Britain ) forbade the United States from building a Central American canal that it exclusively controlled , and Hay , from early in his tenure , sought the removal of this restriction . But the Canadians , for whose foreign policy Britain was still available , saw the canal matter as their greatest leverage to get other disputes resolved in their favor , persuaded Salisbury not to resolve it independently . Shortly before Hay took office , Britain and the U.S. agreed to establish a Joint High Commission to adjudicate unsettled matters , which met in late 1898 but made slow progress , especially on the Canada @-@ Alaska boundary . 
 The Alaska issue became less contentious in August 1899 when the Canadians accepted a provisional boundary pending final settlement . With Congress anxious to begin work on a canal bill , and increasingly likely to ignore the Clayton @-@ Bulwer restriction , Hay and British Ambassador Julian Pauncefote began work on a new treaty in January 1900 . The first Hay @-@ Pauncefote Treaty was sent to the Senate the following month , where it met a cold reception , as the terms forbade the United States from blockading or fortifying the canal , that was to be open to all nations in wartime as in peace . The Senate Foreign Relations Committee added an amendment allowing the U.S. to fortify the canal , then in March postponed further consideration until after the 1900 election . Hay submitted his resignation , which McKinley refused . The treaty , as amended , was ratified by the Senate in December , but the British would not agree to the changes . 
 Despite the lack of agreement , Congress was enthusiastic about a canal , and was inclined to move forward , with or without a treaty . Authorizing legislation was slowed by discussion on whether to take the Nicaraguan or Panamanian route . Much of the negotiation of a revised treaty , allowing the U.S. to fortify the canal , took place between Hay 's replacement in London , Joseph H. Choate , and the British Foreign Secretary , Lord Lansdowne , and the second Hay @-@ Pauncefote Treaty was ratified by the Senate by a large margin on December 6 , 1901 . 
 Seeing that the Americans were likely to build a Nicaragua Canal , the owners of the defunct French company , including Philippe Bunau @-@ Varilla , who still had exclusive rights to the Panama route , lowered their price . Beginning in early 1902 , President Roosevelt became a backer of the latter route , and Congress passed legislation for it , if it could be secured within a reasonable time . In June , Roosevelt told Hay to take personal charge of the negotiations with Colombia . Later that year , Hay began talks with Colombia 's acting minister in Washington , Tomás Herrán . The Hay @-@ Herrán Treaty , granting $ 10 million to Colombia for the right to build a canal , plus $ 250 @,@ 000 annually , was signed on January 22 , 1903 , and ratified by the United States Senate two months later . In August , however , the treaty was rejected by the Colombian Senate . 
 Roosevelt was minded to build the canal anyway , using an earlier treaty with Colombia that gave the U.S. transit rights in regard to the Panama Railroad . Hay predicted " an insurrection on the Isthmus [ of Panama ] against that regime of folly and graft ... at Bogotá " . Bunau @-@ Varilla gained meetings with both men , and assured them that a revolution , and a Panamanian government more friendly to a canal , was coming . In October , Roosevelt ordered Navy ships to be stationed near Panama . The Panamanians duly revolted in early November 1903 , with Colombian interference deterred by the presence of U.S. forces . By prearrangement , Bunau @-@ Varilla was appointed representative of the nascent nation in Washington , and quickly negotiated the Hay – Bunau @-@ Varilla Treaty , signed on November 18 , giving the United States the right to build the canal in a zone 10 miles ( 16 km ) wide , over which the U.S. would exercise full jurisdiction . This was less than satisfactory to the Panamanian diplomats who arrived in Washington shortly after the signing , but they did not dare renounce it . The treaty was approved by the two nations , and work on the Panama Canal began in 1904 . Hay wrote to Secretary of War Elihu Root , praising " the perfectly regular course which the President did follow " as much preferable to armed occupation of the isthmus . 
 = = = = Relationship with Roosevelt , other events = = = = 
 Hay had met the President 's father , Theodore Roosevelt , Sr. , during the Civil War , and during his time at the Tribune came to know the adolescent " Teddy " , twenty years younger than himself . Although before becoming president Roosevelt often wrote fulsome letters of praise to Secretary Hay , his letters to others then and later were less complimentary . Hay felt Roosevelt too impulsive , and privately opposed his inclusion on the ticket in 1900 , though he quickly wrote a congratulatory note after the convention . 
 As President and Secretary of State , the two men took pains to cultivate a cordial relationship . Roosevelt read all ten volumes of the Lincoln biography and in mid @-@ 1903 , wrote to Hay that by then " I have had a chance to know far more fully what a really great Secretary of State you are " . Hay for his part publicly praised Roosevelt as " young , gallant , able , [ and ] brilliant " , words that Roosevelt wrote that he hoped would be engraved on his tombstone . 
 Privately , and in correspondence with others , they were less generous : Hay grumbled that while McKinley would give him his full attention , Roosevelt was always busy with others , and it would be " an hour 's wait for a minute 's talk " . Roosevelt , after Hay 's death in 1905 , wrote to Senator Lodge that Hay had not been " a great Secretary of State ... under me he accomplished little ... his usefulness to me was almost exclusively the usefulness of a fine figurehead " . Nevertheless , when Roosevelt successfully sought election in his own right in 1904 , he persuaded the aging and infirm Hay to campaign for him , and Hay gave a speech linking the administration 's policies with those of Lincoln : " there is not a principle avowed by the Republican party to @-@ day which is out of harmony with his [ Lincoln 's ] teaching or inconsistent with his character . " Kushner and Sherrill suggested that the differences between Hay and Roosevelt were more style than ideological substance . 
 In December 1902 , the German government asked Roosevelt to arbitrate its dispute with Venezuela over unpaid debts . Hay did not think this appropriate , as Venezuela also owed the U.S. money , and quickly arranged for the International Court of Arbitration in The Hague to step in . Hay supposedly said , as final details were being worked out , " I have it all arranged . If Teddy will keep his mouth shut until tomorrow noon ! " Hay and Roosevelt also differed over the composition of the Joint High Commission that was to settle the Alaska boundary dispute . The commission was to be composed of " impartial jurists " and the British and Canadians duly appointed notable judges . Roosevelt appointed politicians , including Secretary Root and Senator Lodge . Although Hay was supportive of the President 's choices in public , in private he protested loudly to Roosevelt , complained by letter to his friends , and offered his resignation . Roosevelt declined it , but the incident confirmed him in his belief that Hay was too much of an Anglophile to be trusted where Britain was concerned . The American position on the boundary dispute was imposed on Canada by a 4 – 2 vote , with the one English judge joining the three Americans . 
 One incident involving Hay that benefitted Roosevelt politically was the kidnapping of Greek @-@ American playboy Ion Perdicaris in Morocco by chieftain Mulai Ahmed er Raisuli , an opponent of Sultan Abdelaziz . Raisuli demanded a ransom , but also wanted political prisoners to be released and control of Tangier in place of the military governor . Raisuli supposed Perdicaris to be a wealthy American , and hoped United States pressure would secure his demands . In fact , Perdicaris , though born in New Jersey , had renounced his citizenship during the Civil War to avoid Confederate confiscation of property in South Carolina , and had accepted Greek naturalization , a fact not generally known until years later , but that decreased Roosevelt 's desire for military action . The sultan was ineffective in dealing with the incident , and Roosevelt considered seizing the Tangier waterfront , source of much of Abdelaziz 's income , as a means of motivating him . With Raisuli 's demands escalating , Hay , with Roosevelt 's approval , finally cabled the consul @-@ general in Tangier , Samuel <unk> : 
 We want Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead . We desire least possible complications with Morocco or other Powers . You will not arrange for landing marines or seizing customs house without specific direction from the [ State ] department . 
 The 1904 Republican National Convention was in session , and the Speaker of the House , Joseph Cannon , its chair , read the first sentence of the cable — and only the first sentence — to the convention , electrifying what had been a humdrum coronation of Roosevelt . " The results were perfect . This was the fighting Teddy that America loved , and his frenzied supporters — and American chauvinists everywhere — roared in delight . " In fact , by then the sultan had already agreed to the demands , and Perdicaris was released . What was seen as tough talk boosted Roosevelt 's election chances . 
 = = = = Final months and death = = = = 
 Hay never fully recovered from the death of his son Adelbert , writing in 1904 to his close friend Lizzie Cameron that " the death of our boy made my wife and me old , at once and for the rest of our lives " . Gale described Hay in his final years as a " saddened , slowly dying old man " . 
 Although Hay gave speeches in support of Roosevelt , he spent much of the fall of 1904 at his New Hampshire house or with his younger brother Charles , who was ill in Boston . After the election , Roosevelt asked Hay to remain another four years . Hay asked for time to consider , but the President did not allow it , announcing to the press two days later that Hay would stay at his post . Early 1905 saw futility for Hay , as a number of treaties he had negotiated were defeated or amended by the Senate — one involving the British dominion of Newfoundland due to Senator Lodge 's fears it would harm his fisherman constituents . Others , promoting arbitration , were voted down or amended because the Senate did not want to be bypassed in the settlement of international disputes . 
 By Roosevelt 's inauguration on March 4 , 1905 , Hay 's health was so bad that both his wife and his friend Henry Adams insisted on his going to Europe , where he could rest and get medical treatment . Presidential doctor Presley Rixey issued a statement that Hay was suffering from overwork , but in letters the secretary hinted his conviction that he did not have long to live . An eminent physician in Italy prescribed medicinal baths for Hay 's heart condition , and he duly journeyed to Bad Nauheim , near Frankfurt , Germany . Kaiser Wilhelm II was among the monarchs who wrote to Hay asking him to visit , though he declined ; Belgian King Leopold II succeeded in seeing him by showing up at his hotel , unannounced . Adams suggested that Hay retire while there was still enough life left in him to do so , and that Roosevelt would be delighted to act as his own Secretary of State . Hay jokingly wrote to sculptor Augustus Saint @-@ Gaudens that " there is nothing the matter with me except old age , the Senate , and one or two other mortal maladies " . 
 After the course of treatment , Hay went to Paris and began to take on his workload again by meeting with the French foreign minister , Théophile <unk> . In London , King Edward VII broke protocol by meeting with Hay in a small drawing room , and Hay lunched with Whitelaw Reid , ambassador in London at last . There was not time to see all who wished to see Hay on what he knew was his final visit . 
 On his return to the United States , despite his family 's desire to take him to New Hampshire , the secretary went to Washington to deal with departmental business and " say Ave Caesar ! to the President " , as Hay put it . He was pleased to learn that Roosevelt was well on his way to settling the Russo @-@ Japanese War , an action for which the President would win the Nobel Peace Prize . Hay left Washington for the last time on June 23 , 1905 , arriving in New Hampshire the following day . He died there on July 1 of his heart ailment and complications . Hay was interred in Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland , near the grave of Garfield , in the presence of Roosevelt and many dignitaries , including Robert Lincoln . 
 = = Literary career = = 
 = = = Early works = = = 
 Hay wrote some poetry while at Brown University , and more during the Civil War . In 1865 , early in his Paris stay , Hay penned " Sunrise in the Place de la Concorde " , a poem attacking Napoleon III for his reinstitution of the monarchy , depicting the Emperor as having been entrusted with the child Democracy by Liberty , and strangling it with his own hands . In " A Triumph of Order " , set in the breakup of the Paris Commune , a boy promises soldiers that he will return from an errand to be executed with his fellow rebels . Much to their surprise , he keeps his word and shouts to them to " blaze away " as " The <unk> tore the stout young heart , / And saved Society . " 
 In poetry , he sought the revolutionary outcome for other nations that he believed had come to a successful conclusion in the United States . His 1871 poem , " The Prayer of the Romans " , recites Italian history up to that time , with the Risorgimento in progress : liberty cannot be truly present until " crosier and crown pass away " , when there will be " One freedom , one faith without fetters , / One republic in Italy free ! " His stay in Vienna yielded " The Curse of Hungary " , in which Hay foresees the end of the Austria @-@ Hungarian Empire . After Hay 's death in 1905 , William Dean Howells suggested that the Europe @-@ themed poems expressed " ( now , perhaps , old @-@ fashioned ) American sympathy for all the oppressed . Castilian Days , souvenir of Hay 's time in Madrid , is a collection of seventeen essays about Spanish history and customs , first published in 1871 , though several of the individual chapters appeared in The Atlantic in 1870 . It went through eight editions in Hay 's lifetime . The Spanish are depicted as afflicted by the " triple curse of crown , crozier , and sabre " — most kings and ecclesiastics are presented as useless — and Hay pins his hope in the republican movement in Spain . Gale deems Castilian Days " a remarkable , if biased , book of essays about Spanish civilization " . 
 Pike County Ballads , a grouping of six poems published ( with other Hay poetry ) as a book in 1871 , brought him great success . Written in the dialect of Pike County , Illinois , where Hay went to school as a child , they are approximately contemporaneous with pioneering poems in similar dialect by Bret Harte and there has been debate as to which came first . The poem that brought the greatest immediate reaction was " Jim <unk> " , about a boatman who is " no saint " with one wife in Mississippi and another in Illinois . Yet , when his steamboat catches fire , " He saw his duty , a dead @-@ sure thing , — / And went for it , thar and then . " Jim holds the burning steamboat against the riverbank until the last passenger gets ashore , at the cost of his life . Hay 's narrator states that , " And Christ ain 't a @-@ going to be too hard / On a man that died for men . " Hay 's poem offended some clergymen , but was widely reprinted and even included in anthologies of verse . 
 = = = The Bread @-@ Winners = = = 
 The Bread @-@ Winners , one of the first novels to take an anti @-@ labor perspective , was published anonymously in 1883 ( published editions did not bear Hay 's name until 1916 ) and he may have tried to disguise his writing style . The book examines two conflicts : between capital and labor , and between the nouveau riche and old money . In writing it , Hay was influenced by the labor unrest of the 1870s , that affected him personally , as corporations belonging to Stone , his father @-@ in @-@ law , were among those struck , at a time when Hay had been left in charge in Stone 's absence . According to historian Scott Dalrymple , " in response , Hay proceeded to write an indictment of organized labor so scathing , so vehement , that he dared not attach his name to it . " 
 The major character is Arthur Farnham , a wealthy Civil War veteran , likely based on Hay . Farnham , who inherited money , is without much influence in municipal politics , as his ticket is defeated in elections , symbolic of the decreasing influence of America 's old @-@ money patricians . The villain is Andrew Jackson Offitt ( true name Ananias Offitt ) , who leads the Bread @-@ winners , a labor organization that begins a violent general strike . Peace is restored by a group of veterans led by Farnham , and , at the end , he appears likely to marry Alice Belding , a woman of his own class . 
 Although unusual among the many books inspired by the labor unrest of the late 1870s in taking the perspective of the wealthy , it was the most successful of them , and was a sensation , gaining many favorable reviews . It was also attacked as an anti @-@ labor polemic with an upper @-@ class bias . There were many guesses as to authorship , with the supposed authors ranging from Hay 's friend Henry Adams to New York Governor Grover Cleveland , and the speculation fueled sales . 
 = = = Lincoln biography = = = 
 Early in his presidency , Hay and Nicolay requested and received permission from Lincoln to write his biography . By 1872 , Hay was " convinced that we ought to be at work on our ' Lincoln . ' I don 't think the time for publication has come , but the time for preparation is slipping away . " Robert Lincoln in 1874 formally agreed to let Hay and Nicolay use his father 's papers ; by 1875 , they were engaged in research . Hay and Nicolay enjoyed exclusive access to Lincoln 's papers , which were not opened to other researchers until 1947 . They gathered documents written by others , as well as many of the Civil War books already being published . They at rare times relied on memory , such as Nicolay 's recollection of the moment at the 1860 Republican convention when Lincoln was nominated , but for much of the rest relied on research . 
 Hay began his part of the writing in 1876 ; the work was interrupted by illnesses of Hay , Nicolay , or family members , or by Hay 's writing of The Bread @-@ Winners . By 1885 , Hay had completed the chapters on Lincoln 's early life , and they were submitted to Robert Lincoln for approval . Sale of the serialization rights to The Century magazine , edited by Hay 's friend Richard Gilder , helped give the pair the impetus to bring what had become a massive project to an end . 
 The published work , Abraham Lincoln : A History , alternates parts in which Lincoln is at center with discussions of contextual matters , such as legislative events or battles . The first serial installment , published in November 1886 , received positive reviews . When the ten @-@ volume set emerged in 1890 , it was not sold in bookstores , but instead door @-@ to @-@ door , then a common practice . Despite a price of $ 50 , and the fact that a good part of the work had been serialized , five thousand copies were quickly sold . The books helped forge the modern view of Lincoln as great war leader , against competing narratives that gave more credit to subordinates such as Seward . According to historian Joshua Zeitz , " it is easy to forget how widely underrated Lincoln the president and Lincoln the man were at the time of his death and how successful Hay and Nicolay were in elevating his place in the nation 's collective historical memory . " 
 = = Assessment and legacy = = 
 In 1902 , Hay wrote that when he died , " I shall not be much missed except by my wife . " Nevertheless , due to his premature death at age 66 , he was survived by most of his friends . These included Adams , who although he blamed the pressures of Hay 's office , where he was badgered by Roosevelt and many senators , for the Secretary of State 's death , admitted that Hay had remained in the position because he feared being bored . He memorialized his friend in the final pages of his autobiography , The Education of Henry Adams : with Hay 's death , his own education had ended . 
 Gale pointed out that Hay " accomplished a great deal in the realm of international statesmanship , and the world may be a better place because of his efforts as secretary of state ... the man was a scintillating ambassador " . Yet , Gale felt , any assessment of Hay must include negatives as well , that after his marriage to the wealthy Clara Stone , Hay " allowed his deep @-@ seated love of ease triumph over his Middle Western devotion to work and a fair shake for all . " Despite his literary accomplishments , Hay " was often lazy . His first poetry was his best . " 
 Taliaferro suggests that " if Hay put any ... indelible stamp on history , perhaps it was that he demonstrated how the United States ought to comport itself . He , not Roosevelt , was the adult in charge when the nation and the State Department attained global maturity . " He quotes John St. Loe Strachey , " All that the world saw was a great gentleman and a great statesman doing his work for the State and for the President with perfect taste , perfect good sense , and perfect good humour " . 
 Hay 's efforts to shape Lincoln 's image increased his own prominence and reputation in making his association ( and that of Nicolay ) with the assassinated president ever more remarkable and noteworthy . According to Zeitz , " the greater Lincoln grew in death , the greater they grew for having known him so well , and so intimately , in life . Everyone wanted to know them , if only to ask what it had been like — what he had been like . " Their answer to that , expressed in ten volumes of biography , Gale wrote , " has been incredibly influential " . In 1974 , Lincoln scholar Roy P. Basler stated that later biographers such as Carl Sandburg , did not " ma [ k ] e revisions of the essential story told by N. [ <unk> ] & H. [ ay ] . Zeitz concurs , " Americans today understand Abraham Lincoln much as Nicolay and Hay hoped that they would . " 
 Hay brought about more than 50 treaties , including the Canal @-@ related treaties , and settlement of the Samoan dispute , as a result of which the United States secured what became known as American Samoa . In 1900 , Hay negotiated of a treaty with Denmark for the cession of the Danish West Indies . That treaty failed in the Danish parliament on a tied vote . 
 Brown University 's John Hay Library is named for that prominent alumnus . Hay 's New Hampshire estate has been conserved by various organizations . Although he and his family never lived there ( Hay died while it was under construction ) , the Hay @-@ McKinney House , home to the Cleveland History Center and thousands of artifacts , serves to remind Clevelanders of John Hay 's lengthy service . 
 According to historian Lewis L. Gould , in his account of McKinley 's presidency , 
 One of the most entertaining and interesting letter writers who ever ran the State Department , the witty , dapper , and bearded Hay left behind an abundance of documentary evidence on his public career . His name is indelibly linked with that verity of the nation 's Asian policy , the Open Door , and he contributed much to the resolution of the longstanding problems with the British . Patient , discreet , and judicious , Hay deserves to stand in the front rank of secretaries of state .

 A Publishers Weekly review refers to Lucky and Squash as almost being " Emma meets Ferris Bueller 's Day Off with wagging tails " and states that Birdsall 's " genial , intimate storytelling instantly establishes a bond with readers " . An article in Kirkus Reviews suggests that Lucky and Squash is similar to a fairy tale in its narrative structure , language , and romantic wedding scene conclusion . This reviewer summarizes Lucky and Squash as a " gentle , entertaining story ... good for dog lovers and romantics alike " . 
 In a School Library Journal article , Anne Beier of the Hendrick Hudson Free Library in Montrose , New York gives the book a positive review , praising Birdsall 's writing and describing the story as funny , sweet , heartwarming , and suspenseful . Beier especially praises the climactic scene of the dogs ' capture by the bear , writing that the repeated story arc of running away is strong as a result of the increased tension . She calls the dog characters endearing and writes , " This title will be a hit at <unk> or in a one @-@ on @-@ one setting " . Connie Fletcher of Booklist also gives the book a positive review , comparing the two eponymous characters to Pyramus and Thisbe , two lovers in Ovid 's poem Metamorphoses . In her review , Fletcher calls the book " a fun canine fantasy with humor , excitement , a happy ending , and , most important of all , two ridiculously adorable dogs that end up getting their way - as dogs tend to do " . 
 The Publishers Weekly reviewer is critical of Dyer 's illustrations , arguing that they do not provide the two dogs with sufficiently differing personalities . The reviewer calls the illustrations " pretty and sweet " , but argues that they are too understated in their depiction of the dogs going on improbable adventures , such as snorkeling at the beach and riding in a hansom cab in Manhattan . 
 Other reviews of the book 's illustrations were positive . Beier writes highly of the illustrations and states that Dyer 's paintings of the dogs ' faces are priceless , particularly in the scenes where they are looking at each other through the fence and those where they are in their owners ' arms . Similarly , the Kirkus reviewer calls the illustrations charming and writes that they " have all the clever details that are Dyer 's signature touch " , noting specifically the lavender frames of Miss Violet 's eyeglasses and the inclusion of the dogs ' names on their collars . Fletcher suggests that , apart from the " ominous grays and greens " in the illustrations of the forest scenes with the bear , the pastel @-@ colored illustrations in the book are evocative of 1940s picture postcards , which she considers " just right for such jolly capers " . 
 = 2011 Canadian Grand Prix = 
 The 2011 Canadian Grand Prix ( formally the Formula 1 Grand Prix du Canada ) was a Formula One motor race held on 12 June 2011 at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve , in Montreal , Canada . It was the seventh race of the 2011 Formula One season and the 48th Canadian Grand Prix . The 70 @-@ lap race was won by McLaren driver Jenson Button after starting from seventh position . Sebastian Vettel , who started from pole position , finished second in a Red Bull with teammate Mark Webber finishing third . 
 The race began behind the safety car , and once it returned to the pits Vettel built a lead over Fernando Alonso . A second safety car deployment caused by the collision of Button and teammate Lewis Hamilton closed the time gaps between cars , but Vettel retained the lead . By lap 26 , increasingly heavy rain led to the race 's suspension , before it was restarted over two hours later . Button was involved in another collision on lap 37 , which led to Alonso 's retirement and Button falling to last place . Over the remainder of the race , he moved from twenty @-@ first place to first , passing Webber and Michael Schumacher , who had started fourth and eighth respectively , for second place on lap 65 , and Vettel on the final lap . 
 The victory was Button 's first of the season , and put him into second place in the World Drivers ' Championship , sixty points behind leader Vettel , who had extended his lead despite finishing second . Webber remained in third , and Hamilton 's retirement meant he slipped to fourth . In the World Constructors ' Championship Red Bull extended their lead to 65 points from McLaren , with Ferrari a further 85 points behind . At over four hours the race set the record as the longest in Formula One history .

 The Grand Prix was contested by twelve teams , each of two drivers . The teams , also known as constructors , were Red Bull , McLaren , Ferrari , Mercedes , Renault , Williams , Force India , Sauber , Toro Rosso , Lotus , HRT and Virgin . Tyre supplier Pirelli brought four different tyre types to the race : two dry compounds , the soft " primes " and the super @-@ soft " options " and two wet @-@ weather compounds , the intermediate and full wet . The drag reduction system ( DRS ) had two activation zones for the race ; one was on the straight between turns 11 and 13 , and the second on the start / finish straight from the final to first corners . 
 Going into the race , Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel led the Drivers ' Championship with 143 points , ahead of Lewis Hamilton on 85 points and Mark Webber on 79 . Jenson Button was fourth with 76 points while Fernando Alonso was fifth on 69 points . In the Constructors ' Championship Red Bull were leading with 222 points , McLaren and Ferrari were second and third with 161 and 93 points respectively , while Renault with 50 and Mercedes with 40 points contended for fourth place . Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel had so far dominated the championship , winning five out of the six previous races , with Lewis Hamilton winning the Chinese Grand Prix . Championship contenders Webber and Button had gained one second @-@ place finish each , and Alonso , Vitaly Petrov and Nick Heidfeld had achieved third place podium finishes . 
 Prior to the event Virgin Racing announced they would end their partnership with Wirth Research , the company responsible for designing and developing the team 's racing cars . In order to cut costs , Wirth Research had designed the cars exclusively using computational fluid dynamics , and unlike their competitors Wirth had not utilised a wind tunnel . The approach was not successful as the team had failed to qualify higher than 20th so far in the season , and Virgin decided to end the partnership . Virgin Racing 's CEO Andy Webb , who had aims to challenge for a podium position at the inaugural Russian Grand Prix , expressed that ending the partnership would mean " that the team will take greater control of its own destiny " . Wirth Research would continue to develop the car until the end of the 2011 season , while Virgin Racing would set up their own technical department under the control of former Renault Director of Engineering Pat Symonds . 
 Several teams made major technical updates to their cars for the Grand Prix . McLaren and Ferrari altered the brake ducts on their cars , improving the cooling to manage the high brake temperatures encountered in Montreal . Ferrari and Mercedes revised their rear suspension layouts , while Red Bull brought a new front wing optimised for a lower downforce level . Renault and Williams brought new rear wings , which were designed specifically for low @-@ downforce circuits such as Circuit Gilles Villeneuve . 
 = = = Practice and qualifying = = = 
 Three practice sessions were held before the race ; two 90 minute sessions on Friday and one lasting an hour on Saturday . Nico Rosberg was the fastest driver in the first practice session , ahead of Alonso and Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher . Vettel caused the session to be suspended after crashing into the circuit 's " Wall of Champions " on the last corner , heavily damaging his car . After the morning session Sergio Pérez , who had suffered from concussion after a crash at the previous race , withdrew from the Grand Prix . Although he had passed the FIA 's medical examination , Perez said that " I only want to drive when I 'm a hundred per cent well . I need some more time to recover " . He was replaced by McLaren 's reserve driver Pedro de la Rosa , who had competed for Sauber in 2010 . Alonso was fastest in the second session , ahead of Vettel , Massa and Hamilton – although the McLaren driver received a puncture mid @-@ way through practice . The session was disrupted by incidents as Kamui Kobayashi and Jérôme d 'Ambrosio struck the barriers – both accidents requiring a suspension as marshals cleared the track of debris – and Adrian Sutil 's Force India broke its suspension in a crash at turn 7 . The third session on Saturday morning saw Vettel fastest , ahead of Alonso , Rosberg and Massa . A KERS failure on Mark Webber 's <unk> prevented him from participating . A crash by de la Rosa in the final minute brought out a red flag , and the session was prematurely ended due to the limited time remaining . 
 The qualifying session on Saturday afternoon was split into three parts . The first part ran for 20 minutes and eliminated the cars from qualifying that finished the session 18th or lower . During this session , the 107 % rule was in effect , which necessitated each driver set a time within 107 % of the quickest lap to qualify for the race . The second part of qualifying lasted 15 minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions 11 to 17 . The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth , and decided pole position . 
 Vettel achieved his sixth pole position of the season , and his first at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve , with a time of 1 : 13 @.@ 014 . He was joined on the front row of the grid by Alonso , with teammate Massa in third , giving Ferrari their best qualifying performance of the season . Webber had not been able to use his car 's KERS and qualified fourth , four @-@ tenths of a second behind Vettel . Hamilton and Button qualified in fifth and seventh respectively and McLaren blamed the slow pace on too high levels of downforce on the high @-@ speed circuit . The Mercedes drivers qualified in sixth and eighth , and Heidfeld and Vitaly Petrov completed the top ten . Paul di Resta was in 11th position , ahead of fellow rookies Pastor Maldonado and Kobayashi . Adrian Sutil struggled with grip throughout the session and was 14th ; following him were Sébastien Buemi , Barrichello and de la Rosa . Jaime Alguersuari qualifying in 18th complained of insufficient grip and brake balance , and at the back of the grid were the Lotus , HRT and Virgin drivers . D 'Ambrosio did not qualify after failing to set a time within 107 % in the first qualifying session . However the stewards allowed him to race , having considered he was using a new chassis after an accident in Friday practice , where he had set faster lap times .

 The track was wet before the race , as rain showers had hit the area throughout the day . The race was due to start at 13 : 00 local time ( UTC @-@ 5 ) , and heavy rain was expected to arrive an hour into the race . The air temperature ranged between 17 – 19 ° C ( 63 – 66 ° F ) , with the track temperature between 18 – 20 ° C ( 64 – 68 ° F ) . Standing water on the track , which was causing heavy spray and impairing visibility , meant that the race would start behind the safety car and all cars would use the full wet tyres . Alguersuari would start the race from the pitlane , as he modified his Toro Rosso 's set @-@ up to optimise the car for the wet conditions . 
 The race began behind the safety car , with no formation lap , and despite the slow speed drivers struggled for grip on the wet surface . The safety car came into the pits after five laps , and the cars were allowed to overtake . Vettel retained first place withstanding Alonso 's attempts to pass , while behind Hamilton and Webber collided at the first corner – dropping the drivers to seventh and fourteenth respectively . Button lost fifth place mid @-@ lap after running wide , losing two places to Schumacher and Hamilton . At the end of the first racing lap , Di Resta had moved up to eighth position , followed by Heidfeld and Kobayashi , who made three places off the grid . Vettel extended his lead over the next lap , while the positions behind continued to change . Kobayashi had improved to eighth and Webber recovered to twelfth , while di Resta fell back to thirteenth . Hamilton lost sixth position running wide on a failed overtaking move on Schumacher , and fell behind Button . He attempted an overtake on the pit straight , but the two drivers collided and Hamilton hit the pit wall . The accident caused Hamilton 's retirement , which prompted a safety car deployment at the end of lap eight . 
 The race was resumed on lap 13 and Button , who had changed to intermediate tyres before the safety car period , was given a drive @-@ through penalty for speeding behind the safety car , emerging in 15th place . Vettel began to enlarge his lead over Alonso and Massa in second and third . Alonso and the Mercedes pitted for intermediate tyres , leaving Massa in second and Kobayashi in third by lap 17 . Barrichello , who switched for intermediates as the safety car came in , began setting times at the same pace as the leaders , and gained 15th position as the drivers in front changed tyres . On lap 19 , a rain storm arrived at the circuit , forcing the drivers on intermediate tyres to switch back to full wets . Alonso and Button , who were in fifth and eighth respectively , fell to ninth and eleventh , while the drivers on the full wet tyres began pitting for fresh wet tyres . The safety car was brought out on lap 20 due to the intensity of the rain , and Vettel , Webber , Massa and Buemi , who had not changed tyres , went to the pitlane for fresh full wets . After six laps under the safety car , the conditions were getting worse , and the race was suspended . 
 Torrential rain prevented the resumption of the Grand Prix for over two hours , until the rain eased at 15 : 50 local time . The race was restarted behind the safety car with the drivers in the positions held before the suspension . Vettel was first , followed by Kobayashi , Massa , Heidfeld , Petrov and di Resta . Webber was in seventh place with Alonso , de la Rosa and Button behind . The safety car remained out for seven laps , during which the circuit began drying enough to be suitable for intermediate tyres , and D 'Ambrosio pitted on lap 33 to change from the full wets . Vettel began to extend the lead over Kobayashi once the safety car came in on lap 35 , as Massa and Heidfeld fought for Kobayashi 's second place . Schumacher led several cars into the pitlane to change to intermediate tyres , while Button , Heidfeld and di Resta were among those who pitted the next lap . Vettel and Karthikeyan were the only drivers not to change tyres by lap 37 , when Button came upon tenth placed Alonso as he exited the pitlane . As Button attempted to pass at turn 3 the two cars touched , and Alonso 's Ferrari spun and beached upon a curb , bringing out the safety car . When the race resumed three laps later , Vettel , Kobayashi and Massa retained their positions , as Heidfeld , di Resta , Webber and Schumacher fought for fourth place . Button had a punctured tyre after the collision and was in twenty @-@ first and last place , but immediately began to make up positions and was 14th by lap 44 . Di Resta damaged his front wing attempting to overtake Heidfeld ; the subsequent pit @-@ stop and drive @-@ through penalty dropped him down to last . Schumacher , having overtaken Webber , passed Heidfeld in fourth place , and set the fastest lap of the race . 
 DRS was enabled on lap 46 , as Barrichello and Rosberg were contesting eighth position . Button had caught Maldonado and Alguersuari , and passed both cars for tenth place . Mark Webber was the first driver to switch to slick tyres , and was followed by Barrichello and Buemi . Kobayashi and Massa , fighting for second place , were both passed by Schumacher on lap 51 ; Massa then passed Kobayashi for third place . As the drivers pitted for slick tyres over the next three laps , Massa damaged his wing forcing him into another pitstop , while damage to Adrian Sutil 's car led to his retirement . Button had risen from ninth after his pit @-@ stop to fourth , and was catching the leading trio of Vettel , Schumacher and Webber . On lap 56 Heidfeld , while battling Kobayashi for fifth place , collided with the rear of the Sauber which damaged his front wing . The wing then detached and folded under the car , and Heidfeld after losing control of his car ran down an escape road on turn 3 . The debris on @-@ track from the accident called the sixth safety car period of the race . 
 Following the pitstops and safety car deployment , Petrov had gained sixth place while Barrichello , Alguersuari , Rosberg and Maldonado were in the remaining point scoring positions . Schumacher and Webber , who had contested second place before the safety car , resumed their fight as the race resumed on lap 61 . Barrichello was passed by Rosberg and Alguersuari before Massa , who had been in eleventh place , overtook both Williams cars for ninth . Kobayashi lost fifth place to Petrov , and Maldonado retired by spinning off on the wet track at turn two . Webber , passing Schumacher using DRS , cut the chicane on lap 64 and ceded the position back to avoid a penalty . Button passed Webber , after he again cut the chicane , and Schumacher on the same lap , and gained second place . As Button began catching race leader Vettel , Webber overtook Schumacher for third place on lap 67 . On the same lap di Resta retired because of a puncture , and Massa gained eighth position from Alguersuari . The fastest lap of the race was set by Button on lap 69 , setting a time of 1 : 16 @.@ 956 as he was closing to Vettel for the race lead . 
 Vettel led by 0 @.@ 9 seconds on the final lap , before he ran wide at turn six . Button passed him to take the lead , and held it to win the race . Vettel recovered from going off @-@ track and finished second , ahead of Webber in third and Schumacher in fourth . Petrov took fifth place , while Massa passed Kobayashi on the finish line for sixth place . Alguersuari , Barrichello and Buemi filled the final point scoring positions , and Rosberg 's car had lost the front wing , dropping him to eleventh . De la Rosa was twelfth , and Liuzzi , d 'Ambrosio , Glock , Trulli and Karthikeyan were the final classified drivers .

 The top three finishers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies , and in the subsequent press conference . Button felt the win was the best of his career so far , and stated that he had to fight hard to win the race : " It was really a fight . I got a drive @-@ through for speeding behind the safety car and I had to fight my way through about three times . Eventually , on the last lap I was chasing down Seb . He ran a little bit wide onto the wet part of the circuit and I was able to take the opportunity and take the win . " Button also praised his team and strategy for helping him take the victory , in particular the moves to intermediate tyres . Vettel expressed his disappointment of making a mistake on the final lap , after driving a faultless race up to that point . Nevertheless , he was happy with second place , as he had increased his championship lead . Webber said he was happy to finish third after his incident at the beginning of the race , putting his recovery from fourteenth place down to correct tyre choices . 
 Martin Whitmarsh , McLaren 's team principal , praised Button 's win , believing that it was one of the finest performances in Formula One : 
 I think it was one of the best wins in the history of F1 , let alone his . There were punctures , he had to change the front wing , and from 21st I don 't know how many times he had to overtake people . He just drove fantastically well . He kept focused . He applied as much pressure as he had to get past and really did a fantastic job . This was 90 per cent him and 10 per cent the car . He did a great , great , great job . 
 The stewards did not impose a penalty on Button for his collisions with Hamilton and Alonso , having judged that no driver was to blame in either incident . Hamilton agreed with the stewards that Button did not intentionally collide with him , and although he felt he was alongside Button at the time , later reflected that " he probably hadn 't spotted me " . He went on to praise his teammate 's race as " an utterly fantastic performance , from a truly great driver . " Alonso also did not place any blame on Button , saying that it was the final incident on a day that " everything went wrong " . 
 Michael Schumacher admitted to having mixed feelings after the race , having been in second position until the race 's last laps . The Mercedes driver stated : " I would obviously have loved to finish there [ in second place ] and be on the podium again . But even if it did not work out in the very end , we can be happy about the result and the big fight we put in . " Kobayashi , placed second at the restart , shared similar feelings to Schumacher about finishing in a lower position : " Originally I qualified 13th so then it is not bad to finish seventh , but on the other hand I started second after the long red flag and looking from there the result is disappointing . " 
 The usage of the safety car came under criticism from figures within the sport . Fernando Alonso disagreed with the decision to start under the safety car as he felt it prevented him from attacking Vettel , while Sauber technical director James Key thought his team was put at a disadvantage when Kobayashi could not defend against the quicker cars after the fifth safety car period . Martin Brundle , who competed in Formula One for twelve years , stated " the fact that the drivers came in almost immediately for intermediate tyres tells me that , on the face of it , the safety car was out too long " , and felt that the safety car " should be a last resort , not a default option . " However , he recognised that FIA race director Charlie Whiting had to consider the driver 's visibility , and inexperience using the Pirelli wet @-@ weather tyres led to caution . Jarno Trulli however agreed with the FIA 's decisions , in particular the length of the red flag delay : " It was right to wait that long ; track conditions had to improve in order to make the cars drivable again . They did everything right . " De la Rosa and di Resta also agreed with the decision to halt the race , and Whiting stating that " when it rained it was quite clear we needed to stop the race . " Whiting went on to say that the opinions of the drivers were taken into account on the decision to halt the race , although he also considered the possibility of a suspension benefiting those drivers . 
 With a total time of four hours , four minutes and 39 seconds ( including the two @-@ hour suspension ) , the race was the longest in Formula One history . Button set records for the lowest average race winning speed , at 74 @.@ 864 km / h ( 46 @.@ 518 mph ) and with six stops the most pit stops by the winner of a world championship race . The race also had the highest number of safety car deployments , with six appearances .

 The South West Coast Path is England 's longest waymarked long @-@ distance footpath ( and one of the longest in the UK ) and a National Trail . It stretches for 630 miles ( 1 @,@ 014 km ) , running from Minehead in Somerset , along the coasts of Devon and Cornwall , to Poole Harbour in Dorset . Since it rises and falls with every river mouth , it is also one of the more challenging trails . The total height climbed has been calculated to be 114 @,@ 931 ft ( 35 @,@ 031 m ) , almost four times the height of Mount Everest . It has been voted ' Britain 's Best Walking route ' twice in a row by readers of the Ramblers Walk magazine , and regularly features in lists of the world 's best walks . 
 The final section of the path was designated as a National Trail in 1978 . Many of the landscapes which the South West Coast Path crosses have special status , either as a National Park or one of the Heritage Coasts . The path passes through two World Heritage Sites : the Dorset and East Devon Coast , known as the Jurassic Coast , was designated in 2001 , and the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape in 2007 . 
 In the 1990s it was thought that the path brought £ 15 million into the area each year , but new research in 2003 indicated that it generated around £ 300 million a year in total , which could support more than 7 @,@ 500 jobs . This research also recorded that 27 @.@ 6 % of visitors to the region came because of the Path , and they spent £ 136 million in a year . Local people took 23 million walks on the Path and spent a further £ 116 million , and other visitors contributed the remainder . A further study in 2005 estimated this figure to have risen to around £ 300 million . Following investment through the Rural Development Programme for England , more detailed research was undertaken in 2012 , and this found the annual spend by walkers to have risen to £ 439 million which sustains <unk> full @-@ time equivalent jobs 
 = = History of the path = = 
 The path originated as a route for the Coastguard to walk from lighthouse to lighthouse patrolling for smugglers . They needed to be able to look down into every bay and cove : as a result , the path closely hugs the coast providing excellent views but rarely the most direct path between two points . The South West Coast Path is no longer used by the Coastguard but it has been transformed from a practical defence system into a resource for recreational walkers . The path is covered by England 's right @-@ of @-@ way laws , as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 , which keep historic footpaths open to the public even when they pass through private property . Sections of the path are maintained by the National Trust , which owns parts of the coast . 
 The path is a designated National Trail , largely funded by Natural England . It was created in stages , with its final section , Somerset and North Devon , opening in 1978 . It is maintained by a dedicated South West Coast Path Team . 
 The South West Coast Path Association , a registered charity , exists to support the interests of users of the path . The Association was formed in 1973 and since then it has campaigned for improvements to the path and undertakes considerable fundraising to help care for and improve the path . Its services include accommodation guides and completion certificates . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The route is described here anticlockwise , from Minehead to Poole . The distance and total ascent between any two points , in either direction , can be obtained from The South West Coast Path Association Distance Reckoner . A survey carried out in 1999 and 2000 found that at that time the path had 2 @,@ 473 signposts or <unk> , and included 302 bridges , 921 stiles , and 26 @,@ 719 steps . In practice , any such calculation is soon out of date because of path diversions due to landslips or access changes . 
 Many walkers take about eight weeks to complete the path , often dividing this into sections walked over several years . In contrast , a team of six Royal Marines , taking turns in pairs to run two @-@ hour sections , completed the path in six days in 2004 and in 2012 a runner ran the entire path in 16 days , 9 hours and 57 minutes . New records for completing the path were set on 11 May 2013 , when two runners completed the trail in 14 days , 14 hours and 45 minutes and 23 April 2015 , when a runner completed the trail in 14 days , 8 hours and 2 minutes . This record was however quickly broken and as of June 2015 , the record is held by Mark Berry , who ran it in 11 days , 8 hours and 15 minutes .

 The South West Coast Path starts from the western side of Minehead , in Somerset , at a marker erected in 2001 and partly paid for by the South West Coast Path Association . The path follows the waterfront past the harbour to Culver Cliff before climbing up on a zigzag path through woodland . Entering the Exmoor National Park , it cuts inland past North Hill , Selworthy Beacon and Bossington Hill before regaining the cliff top at <unk> Point . After passing through Bossington it follows the beach to Porlock Weir and connects with the Coleridge Way . 
 The scenery of rocky headlands , ravines , waterfalls and towering cliffs gained the Exmoor coast recognition as a Heritage Coast in 1991 . The Exmoor Coastal Heaths have been recognised as a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to the diversity of species present . The path passes the smallest parish church in England , Culbone Church , in Culbone . The path crosses the county boundary into Devon , a few hundred yards north of the National Park Centre at County Gate . 
 = = = North Devon = = = 
 The next big headland is Foreland Point , after which the path comes to Lynmouth with the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway linking it with Lynton on the hill above . At Lynmouth the path intersects with the Two Moors Way . The river here suffered a catastrophic flood in the 1950s . Beyond Lynton the path passes through the Valley of the Rocks , known for its herd of goats , then Duty Point and Lee Bay , then Crock Point and Woody Bay . After <unk> Rocks the path crosses the small River Heddon then skirts Trentishoe Down and <unk> Down and climbs Great Hangman . At 1 @,@ 043 feet ( 318 m ) this is the highest point on the path . With a cliff face of 800 feet ( 244 m ) , it is described as the highest cliff on mainland Britain . The path now leaves the Exmoor National Park and enters the village of Combe Martin , which claims to have the longest village street in England ( two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) ) . 
 After rounding <unk> Head , the path passes ' The Coastguard Cottages ' in Hele Bay and enters the seaside resort of Ilfracombe , with its small harbour , surrounded by cliffs . A seasonal foot passenger ferry service runs from the harbour to Lundy Island , and the Balmoral , the Waverley and pleasure boats ply to Porthcawl near Swansea . From Ilfracombe to Bideford the Tarka Trail coincides with the South West Coast Path . 
 The path leaves Ilfracombe through The Torrs and follows the cliff top past several small bays including Lee Bay before passing Bull Point and the Bull Point Lighthouse , into Rackham Bay . It then rounds Morte Point , passing the nearby village of <unk> before turning south to enter the long sandy Morte Bay which includes <unk> and <unk> . Baggy Point divides Morte Bay from <unk> Bay , and the surfing mecca of <unk> and then the much larger Barnstaple or Bideford Bay , which forms part of the North Devon Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty . The wide expanse of Saunton Sands , which takes its name from Saunton , merges into the Braunton Burrows Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) , the largest sand dune system ( <unk> ) in England and a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve . It is particularly important ecologically because it includes the complete successional range of dune plant communities , with over 400 vascular plant species . The short turf communities are very rich in lichens and herbs , and the dune slacks are also rich . The many rare plants and animals include 14 with UK Biodiversity Action Plans . 
 From Braunton Burrows the South West Coast Path turns inland following the Braunton Canal to Braunton and then along north bank of the River Taw , following part of the route of the old Ilfracombe Branch Line , past the perimeter of the Royal Marines Base <unk> towards Barnstaple where the new Barnstaple Western Bypass now forms the closest bridge over the Taw to the sea . After crossing medieval Barnstaple Long Bridge , the path then turns west following the disused Bideford & Instow Railway line along southern bank of the Taw past <unk> Quay and the <unk> Quay Cliffs SSSI to Instow at the joint estuary of the Rivers Taw and Torridge and the Taw @-@ Torridge Estuary ( SSSI ) . The ferry which used to operate at Instow ceased on the retirement of the ferryman in 2007 , but since 2013 a revived ferry again runs in summer . The path goes upstream to cross the river by the 13th @-@ century Long Bridge at Bideford , which is the site of the Bideford Railway Heritage Centre and terminus of the North Devon Railway . 
 The path continues north beside the Torridge Estuary , in places following the route of the Bideford , Westward Ho ! and Appledore Railway , past Northam to Appledore and around the promontory past the Shell middens and a submerged forest , that dates from the Mesolithic period , off the pebble ridge to Westward Ho ! ( this is the only placename in the UK which includes an exclamation mark ) . The path then follows the coast around Clovelly Bay where several small villages including <unk> lie inland , because of the cliffs . The path passes the site of the Iron Age Hill fort at <unk> Castle and the village of Bucks Mills . Clovelly itself is a historic village with a small natural harbour . The path continues past the site of the Iron Age hillfort at <unk> Head to Hartland Point and Hartland Quay . Hartland Point features a lighthouse and radar tower , and marks the western limit ( on the English side ) of the Bristol Channel with the Atlantic Ocean to the west . There is a winter helicopter service from Hartland Point to the island of Lundy , which is visible from many points along the path between <unk> and the Cornish border . 
 = = = North Cornwall = = = 
 The path crosses into Cornwall at Marsland Mouth and continues south @-@ westwards along this rocky coast , past <unk> then Higher and Lower <unk> Points . Beyond Sandy Mouth , the walking becomes easier through Bude , a popular surfing resort , and along <unk> Bay . Returning to the cliffs , the path continues on to <unk> Haven , past <unk> and further south ( over " High Cliff " , Southern Britain 's highest sheer @-@ drop cliff at 735 feet ( 224 m ) ) , and from there to Boscastle , the scene of flooding in 2004 . 
 Tintagel and its castle are associated with the conception of the legendary King Arthur and a 15th @-@ century house that was later used as a post office . The path continues to <unk> Strand , <unk> , then to Port <unk> , Port Isaac , and Port Quin , three small harbours . Overlooking Port Quin is <unk> Castle , a 19th @-@ century folly . 
 The scenery is now less wild , the cliffs less high . Rumps Point has Iron Age defences across its narrow neck but the path heads straight past to <unk> Head then swings eastwards again into <unk> . The estuary of the River Camel forces a detour away from the sea to Rock and the Black Tor Ferry that takes walkers into Padstow . 
 From Stepper Point the path again runs along low sea cliffs to <unk> and <unk> Bay then around Trevose Head . From <unk> — weather <unk> — the coast can be seen from Hartland in Devon to beyond St Ives in the west . The path runs southwards through Constantine Bay to <unk> then passes around Park Head to reach Mawgan Porth . 
 The long , sandy Watergate Bay leads to St <unk> Porth and Newquay . A rail link with through trains to London and the North of England on summer weekends has helped the town prosper as a seaside resort popular with surfers and clubbers . On the far side of the town , beyond <unk> Beach , lies the River <unk> . There are seasonal ferries to <unk> and a footbridge which is passable at low tide , otherwise there is a detour inland to use the road bridge . 
 The path now skirts <unk> Point West and then Kelsey Head to reach Holywell Bay , another surfing beach . After passing round Penhale and crossing Penhale Sands the path enters Perranporth , then climbs out the other side back onto a stretch of cliffs past <unk> Head to the village of St Agnes . Past St Agnes Head , a breeding ground for kittiwakes , lies the ruins of <unk> Mine and the inlet at Chapel Porth . Next are the ruins of Wheal Charlotte mine and then <unk> village . 
 After passing <unk> firing ranges , the path drops into <unk> , once a busy port serving inland tin mines around Redruth . Beyond lies <unk> Downs with <unk> Island just off the coast , and then the <unk> Downs better known locally as the North Cliffs . Beyond the cove at Hell 's Mouth , the path runs northwards to pass around <unk> Point and <unk> Point , offshore from which lies <unk> Island with its lighthouse . 
 = = = West Cornwall = = = 
 Turning into the wide sweep of St Ives Bay , where many walkers drop down onto the sands at low tide , the path follows the line of the sand dunes or Towans as they are known here . This area was used for explosives manufacture for many years , the sand being ideal for absorbing any accidental explosions . The Towans are interrupted by two rivers , the small Red River at the north end , and the larger River Hayle and its estuary towards the south . Although narrow , the estuary is tidal and fast flowing due to the large expanse of mud flats and docks that lie behind the Towans , so the path turns away from St Ives Bay to go round via Hayle . The water is crossed using an old railway bridge and then the old Hayle Railway is followed into the town centre then the A30 road to Griggs Quay where quieter roads bring the Path around to the west side of the tidal mud flats . Views of the birdlife can be had from <unk> Pool at Hayle and from the area around <unk> <unk> railway station , although the official path is slightly inland on the <unk> road through <unk> village , regaining the coast by crossing golf links to reach the last of the Towans above Porth Kidney Sands . 
 Rising back onto low cliffs , the path rounds Carrack Gladden and enters Carbis Bay , it then follows alongside the St Ives Bay railway line into St Ives ; a bustling town favoured by artists since the 19th century , which is home to the Tate St Ives art gallery and the Barbara Hepworth Museum . The path passes the east @-@ facing <unk> Beach and goes around " The Island " , a headland , to the north @-@ facing <unk> Beach . 
 The coast now shows the open and ancient landscape of the Penwith district along a series of wild headlands such as <unk> Point , Hor Point , Pen Enys Point , and Carn <unk> Point . The <unk> lie just offshore , locally known as Seal Island ( and seals can often be seen close to the shore opposite here ) , then there lies Zennor Head and Gurnard 's Head as the Path leads into <unk> , although the village proper lies inland . <unk> Cove is a relief from the many small rocky bays along this coast but the cliffs then continue beyond the iconic , disused Crowns Mine at <unk> . 
 From Cape Cornwall at St Just , the Path heads southwards to sandy Whitesand Bay and the village of <unk> . At the end of the sands the path turns westwards one last time to reach Land 's End . This is the most westerly point of the English mainland . 
 After passing Land 's End the path continues further south past <unk> Point and Mill Bay before turning fully eastward at Gwennap Head . Beyond the tiny village of Porthgwarra lies St Levan . The next bay lies below <unk> . It is overlooked by the open @-@ air Minack Theatre and is where the Eastern Cable Company 's cable came ashore , the first telegraph link with India . Climbing out of the bay the path passes the precarious Logan Rock . 
 The next village is <unk> , then a series of bays are separated by the headlands of <unk> Point , Boscawen Point , and Tater Du with its lighthouse built in 1965 . <unk> Cove is a favourite with artists such as S. J. " <unk> " Birch , who lived there in a small cottage . Then , after rounding Carn Du , the path turns northwards towards Mousehole and Penlee Point . This section of the path follows a road into Newlyn , but a diversion via Paul allows walkers to follow a quieter inland path . Newlyn has a busy fishing harbour and is again favoured by artists , known as the Newlyn School ; it merges into Penzance and the path now follows the promenade through the town , passing Penzance railway station and continuing past the railway engine shed along the shore of Mount 's Bay with its views of St Michael 's Mount . This is an island at high tide but can be reached from Marazion by a causeway at low tide . 
 The path now turns south again , passing the village of <unk> ( or <unk> ) and <unk> Sands , then skirting inland across the neck of <unk> Point to Prussia Cove and Bessy 's Cove . A larger sandy beach is <unk> Sands after which the path climbs up onto a series of cliff tops such as Trewavas Head . This area shows many signs of Cornwall 's mining history with abandoned engine houses such as Wheal Prosper close to the path . 
 After passing through Porthleven the path crosses the shingle bank of Loe Bar with the freshwater Loe Pool behind . At <unk> more cliffs appear , leading to Poldhu Cove overlooked by the radio station on Poldhu Point , then Porth Mellin on <unk> Cove with <unk> Island offshore . Rounding <unk> Head , <unk> Head , and Rill Head ( where the Spanish Armada was first sighted on 29 July 1588 ) , the path leads to <unk> Cove and Lizard Point , the lighthouse of which has been visible for some distance . Lizard Point is the most southerly point of the British mainland . 
 = = = South Cornwall = = = 
 After passing The Lizard the path turns northwards , continuing past <unk> Bay and a building used by Guglielmo Marconi for radio experiments , then Bass Point with its Coastguard Station . The Lizard lifeboat station is a sheltered position in <unk> Cove . Passing through Cadgwith and across <unk> Sands , the path heads towards Black Head then into Coverack . Once around Lowland Point , The <unk> lie a mile offshore , a reef that has wrecked many ships . The path passes through <unk> and <unk> , then around <unk> Point lies Gillan Creek . This can be crossed at very low tide , but most walkers follow the lanes round the head of the creek to reach Dennis Head at the mouth of the Helford River . To cross this wider river means following it inland to Helford where there is a ferry across to Helford Passage on the north bank . Some people take a short cut from Gillan Creek to Helford by a path through <unk> . 
 After following the river back through Durgan to the open waters beyond Toll Point , the path skirts Falmouth Bay along <unk> , <unk> and <unk> beaches before passing around the headland beneath Pendennis Castle to enter bustling Falmouth . The castle was built , along with its twin at St Mawes , to protect the deep water of Carrick Roads from attack . This natural haven is what made Falmouth such an important harbour , it being the last good shelter for ships heading westwards towards the Atlantic Ocean . 
 The path crosses the harbour on the St Mawes Ferry and then passes St Anthony Head and Zone Point and northwards past the village of <unk> and around Gerrans Bay . Beyond <unk> Head is <unk> in <unk> Bay . The next big headland is <unk> Point after which the coast path resumes its northwards course through <unk> Haven and the fishing harbour at <unk> to <unk> where the once busy dock has silted up with sand . The path then climbs up around Black Head to reach <unk> and then Charlestown . This was the first harbour to serve the china clay industry around St Austell and has featured in several films as it is home to a heritage fleet of sailing ships . 
 After passing Carlyon Bay the path comes to the much busier china @-@ clay exporting port of Par , where it goes inland of the dock site . After passing through the village the path regains the coast at Par Sands and links with the Saints ' Way , a coast @-@ to @-@ coast path across Cornwall , at <unk> . It then follows the cliff tops through <unk> and around Gribbin Head . From here to Polperro is designated as a heritage coast . 
 The path now passes <unk> ( pronounced ' <unk> ' ) and <unk> Cove to enter Fowey ( ' Foy ' ) , another busy harbour but this time the deep water quays are situated up river above the town . The River Fowey is crossed on the Polruan ferry , beyond which are some steep cliffs with spectacular views . Beyond <unk> Bay lies <unk> Head then the larger <unk> Bay with further cliffs and small coves leading to Polperro , a fishing village which bans cars during the summer . 
 Beyond Polperro lies <unk> Bay and <unk> Bay , with the bird reserve of Looe Island ( also known as St George 's island ) off shore . The path now enters Looe , passing through <unk> , West Looe then , after crossing the River Looe on a seven @-@ span bridge . The path continues up onto the cliff then heads towards <unk> then along more cliffs , running past a 60 @-@ ft sevenfold labyrinth carved into the turf of the hillside to Seaton , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 The long beach of <unk> Bay has a fast @-@ rising tide and is a military firing range so the path runs inland behind Tregantle Fort to reach <unk> and Rame Head . Beyond this lies Penlee Point and then the path turns northwards into Plymouth Sound , skirting Cawsand Bay and Mount <unk> Country Park to reach the ferry at Cremyll . Beyond here lies the Hamoaze , the combined estuary of the Tamar and other rivers . 
 = = = South Devon = = = 
 The Cremyll Ferry lands in Devon at Stonehouse , one of the Three Towns that make up the modern city of Plymouth . The path follows roads past Stonehouse Barracks and Millbay Docks to Plymouth Hoe with its views across Plymouth Sound . It then crosses Sutton Harbour by the Mayflower Steps then skirts the hill of Cattedown to cross the River Plym by the <unk> Bridge to Plymstock . Passing round the edge of the tidal Hooe Lake , the path regains the countryside above <unk> Bay , part of the Plymouth Sound , Shores and Cliffs ( Site of Special Scientific Interest ) , and follows the cliffs past <unk> to Wembury , Wembury Marine Centre . 
 From Wembury the path travels east into the South Hams district to the Warren Point Ferry , across the River <unk> , near Newton Ferrers . The River <unk> near Kingston must be forded at <unk> Mouth within one hour of low tide . The path then goes past <unk> Point Rock . The view to the southwest is then over <unk> Bay past Burgh Island and Hope Cove to the promontory known as Bolt Tail . The next 6 miles ( 10 km ) of cliff top paths from <unk> Down past Bolt Head and the tidal ria of Kingsbridge Estuary to <unk> Point , belong to the National Trust . The estuary is crossed using the Salcombe Ferry , from Salcombe to East <unk> , close to Salcombe Castle and within the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty ( AONB ) . The path passes through the <unk> Point and Start Point Site of Special Scientific Interest which is recognised as being an important site for solitary bees and wasps , the rare cuckoo bee <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> bunting . 
 The path then continues around <unk> Bay to Start Point and its Lighthouse and then through Start Bay along a 3 @-@ mile ( 5 km ) shingle causeway between Slapton Sands and the Slapton Ley freshwater lake and nature reserve before entering the estuary of the River Dart and historic port of Dartmouth . From Dartmouth , the route uses either the Lower Ferry or Passenger Ferry to cross the river to Kingswear . 
 Kingswear is the terminus of the Paignton and Dartmouth Steam Railway which follows the River Dart , but the coast path climbs out of the village in the opposite direction to reach Torbay , known as " The English Riviera " . It passes the historic harbour of Brixham and the seaside towns of <unk> , Paignton , Torquay , Babbacombe . The coast path then passes along the wooded cliffs above Labrador Bay to reach <unk> and the River <unk> . 
 Crossing the river by ferry or the long <unk> Bridge brings walkers to Teignmouth , beyond which the coast path follows the South Devon Railway sea wall to Hole Head where the Parson and Clerk rocks look out to sea . Passing beneath the railway , the path climbs up to the main road , which it follows for a few yards before turning back towards the cliff top ( in stormy weather the sea wall is too dangerous and this road must be followed most of the way from Teignmouth ) . Entering Dawlish along a now by @-@ passed toll road , the coast path descends back to the level of the railway which it follows to Dawlish Warren , although a slightly more landward route is necessary at high tides . 
 Dawlish Warren is a sand spit and nature reserve that lies at the mouth of the River Exe . The route now turns away from the coast and follows the Exe estuary past <unk> to Starcross where the seasonal Exmouth to Starcross Ferry crosses to Exmouth . The Exe Valley Way continues beyond Starcross towards Exeter , but when the ferry is not running it is possible to catch a train from either Dawlish Warren or Starcross railway stations to Exmouth railway station . 
 On the eastern side of Exmouth , the coast path climbs up onto the High Land of <unk> . This is the start of the Jurassic Coast , a World Heritage Site . The next town is <unk> <unk> , beyond which lies the River Otter . The path then skirts <unk> Bay and <unk> Bay towards Sidmouth which sits at the mouth of the River Sid . Access to the beach is via a wooden staircase known as Jacob 's ladder . Sidmouth is surrounded by the East Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty . Erosion remains a serious concern east of the mouth of the River Sid . The cliffs have been heavily eroded , threatening cliff top homes and the footpath , which passes along the tops of the cliff , around Lyme Bay , avoiding The Undercliff towards Branscombe . The path then follows Seaton Bay past Beer , with Beer Caves a man @-@ made cave complex , resulting from the quarrying of Beer stone and Seaton before going through The Undercliff SSSI and NNR and crossing the border into Dorset shortly before reaching Lyme Regis .

 Across the Dorset border , the Coast Path runs through the town of Lyme Regis where the Cobb breakwater was seen in the film The French Lieutenant 's Woman and features on the film 's poster . Further east , where it shares its route with the Monarch 's Way , the path passes by Golden Cap , the highest point on the south coast , and on through Charmouth and West Bay ( near Bridport ) , to Burton Bradstock at the start of Chesil Beach , an 18 @-@ mile ( 29 km ) long tombolo . At Abbotsbury , the path leaves Chesil beach to follow the shores of the Fleet lagoon , until it reaches the terminus of Chesil beach next to the villages of Fortuneswell and Chiswell on the Isle of Portland . The path circumnavigates the Isle of Portland , passing the lighthouses at Portland Bill and the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy in Chiswell , and returns across Chesil beach to Wyke Regis ( encompassing the Rodwell Trail ) and along the shores of Portland Harbour to the Nothe Fort in the resort of Weymouth . 
 In Weymouth the coast path runs along Weymouth Harbour and the Wey Estuary up to Radipole Lake , through the town centre to the Esplanade on the shore of Weymouth Bay , and on to <unk> Bay , with White Nothe at its eastern end , near the village of <unk> Mills . There is an alternative route around Weymouth and Portland along the South Dorset Downs , which reduces the footpath distance by 19 @.@ 25 miles ( 31 km ) . Just the loop around the Isle of Portland can be omitted , reducing the journey by 13 @.@ 2 miles ( 21 @.@ 2 km ) . 
 The coast path then heads towards the Isle of Purbeck , via Bat 's Head , <unk> Head , Durdle Door — a natural arch which has been described as " one of Dorset 's most recognisable features " — and Lulworth Cove , " the most visited geological locality in Britain " . Further east is the deserted village of <unk> , beside <unk> Bay , and Kimmeridge , next to Kimmeridge Bay , with its rocky shore and wave cut platform . Between Lulworth Cove and Kimmeridge the path passes through the Lulworth Ranges , which are not always open to the public . When the ranges are in use a 12 @-@ mile ( 19 km ) road detour is needed . 
 The coast path then reaches St Alban 's Head , just to the south of the village of Worth Matravers . Between St Alban 's Head and the resort of Swanage is <unk> Country Park nature reserve . North of Swanage is the chalk Ballard Down , the eastern tip of which has been eroded to form Old Harry Rocks – a series of stacks , arches and caves jutting into the sea between Swanage Bay and Studland Bay . This headland marks the end of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site . Behind Studland beach , an extensive system of sand dunes have formed a <unk> , stretching for miles across the Studland peninsula . The peninsula forms one shore of Poole Harbour , one of the largest natural harbours in the world . Part of Studland beach is the National Trust 's only official naturist beach . The South West Coast Path ends at South Haven Point , where there is a commemorative marker . The Sandbanks Ferry links this to the Sandbanks area of Poole on the eastern edge of the harbour .

 From Plymouth to Poole the South West Coast Path forms part of the route of the E9 European Coastal Path which runs for 3 @,@ 125 miles ( 5 @,@ 000 km ) from Cabo de São Vicente in Portugal to Narva @-@ <unk> in Estonia . The route crosses by ferry from Roscoff to Plymouth , and beyond Poole the path follows the Bournemouth Coast Path to Milford on Sea , then the Solent Way ( with an Isle of Wight option ) , South Downs Way , 1066 Country Walk and Saxon Shore Way to Dover , from where it returns to continental Europe . It is also part of the network of routes that form the International Appalachian Trail .

 = = Public transport = = 
 There are regular train services from other parts of the UK to the south west , principal destination stations being Barnstaple , Exeter , Newquay , Penzance and Plymouth . From these places local trains or buses connect to many points of the path . Airports at Exeter and Newquay are served from a range of national and international destinations . 
 Using public transport for at least part of the journey means that walkers can plan walks that start and finish at different places , rather than having to circle back to their start point to collect their cars . 
 More than twenty railway stations give options either for short walks – such as Dawlish to Paignton — or for longer walks over several days . The West Somerset Railway offers steam and diesel services from Taunton to Minehead at the Somerset end of the path ( using a connecting bus from Taunton railway station to Bishops Lydeard ) , and the Paignton and Dartmouth Steam Railway connects Kingswear and Paignton . 
 Long @-@ distance bus services connect some coastal towns with railway stations :

 Poor Folk ( Russian : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) , sometimes translated as Poor People , [ note ] is the first novel by Fyodor Dostoyevsky , written over the span of nine months between 1844 and 1845 . Dostoyevsky was in financial difficulty because of his extravagant living and his developing gambling addiction ; although he had produced some translations of foreign novels , they had little success , and he decided to write a novel of his own to try to raise funds . 
 Inspired by the works of Gogol , Pushkin , and Karamzin , as well as English and French authors , Poor Folk is written in the form of letters between the two main characters , Makar Devushkin and Varvara Dobroselova , who are poor second cousins . The novel showcases the life of poor people , their relationship with rich people , and poverty in general , all common themes of literary naturalism . A deep but odd friendship develops between them until Dobroselova loses her interest in literature , and later in communicating with Devushkin after a rich widower Mr. Bykov proposes to her . Devushkin , a prototype of the clerk found in many works of naturalistic literature at that time , retains his sentimental characteristics ; Dobroselova abandons art , while Devushkin cannot live without literature . 
 Contemporary critics lauded Poor Folk for its humanitarian themes . While Vissarion Belinsky dubbed the novel Russia 's first " social novel " and Alexander Herzen called it a major socialist work , other critics detected parody and satire . The novel uses a complicated polyphony of voices from different perspectives and narrators . Initially offered by Dostoyevsky to the liberal @-@ leaning magazine Fatherland Notes , the novel was published in the almanac , St. Petersburg Collection , on January 15 , 1846 . It became a huge success nationwide . Parts of it were translated into German by Wilhelm <unk> and published in an 1846 / 1847 magazine . The first English translation was provided by Lena Milman in 1894 , with an introduction by George Moore , cover art design by Aubrey Beardsley and publication by London 's Mathews and Lane . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Varvara Dobroselova and Makar Devushkin are second cousins twice @-@ removed and live across from each other on the same street in terrible apartments . Devushkin 's , for example , is merely a portioned @-@ off section of the kitchen , and he lives with several other tenants , such as the <unk> , whose son who groans in agonizing hunger almost the entire story and eventually dies . Devushkin and Dobroselova exchange letters attesting to their terrible living conditions and the former frequently squanders his money on gifts for her . 
 The reader progressively learns their history . Dobroselova originally lived in the country , but moved to St. Petersburg ( which she hates ) when her father lost his job . Her father becomes very violent and her mother severely depressed . Her father dies and they move in with Anna Fyodorovna , a landlady who was previously cruel to them but at least pretends to feel sympathy for their situation . Dobroselova is tutored by a poor student named Pokrovsky , whose drunken father occasionally visits . She eventually falls in love with Pokrovsky . She struggles to save a measly amount of money to purchase the complete works of Pushkin at the market for his birthday present , then allows his father to give the books to him instead , claiming that just knowing he received the books will be enough for her happiness . Pokrovsky falls ill soon after , and his dying wish is to see the sun and the world outside . Dobroselova obliges by opening the blinds to reveal grey clouds and dirty rain . In response Pokrovsky only shakes his head and then passes away . Dobroselova 's mother dies shortly afterwards , and Dobroselova is left in the care of Anna for a time , but the abuse becomes too much and she goes to live with Fedora across the street . 
 Devushkin works as a lowly copyist , frequently belittled and picked on by his colleagues . His clothing is worn and dirty , and his living conditions are perhaps worse than Dobroselova 's . He considers himself a rat in society . He and Dobroselova exchange letters ( and occasional visits that are never detailed ) , and eventually they also begin to exchange books . Devushkin becomes offended when she sends him a copy of " The Overcoat " , because he finds the main character is living a life similar to his own . 
 Dobroselova considers moving to another part of the city where she can work as a governess . Just as he is out of money and risks being evicted , Devushkin has a stroke of luck : his boss takes pity on him and gives him 100 rubles to buy new clothes . Devushkin pays off his debts and sends some to Dobroselova . She sends him 25 rubles back because she does not need it . The future looks bright for both of them because he can now start to save money and it may be possible for them to move in together . 
 The writer <unk> , who jokes about using Devushkin as a character in one of his stories offends him , but genuinely seems to like him . Eventually Devushkin 's pride is assuaged and their friendship is restored . The <unk> come into money because the father 's case is won in court . With the generous settlement they seem to be destined to be perfectly happy , but the father dies , leaving his family in a shambles despite the money . Soon after this , Dobroselova announces that a rich man , Mr. Bykov who had dealings with Anna Fyodorovna and Pokrovsky 's father , has proposed to her . She decides to leave with him , and the last few letters attest to her slowly becoming accustomed to her new money . 
 She asks Devushkin to find linen for her and begins to talk about various luxuries , but leaves him alone in the end despite his improving fortunes . In the last correspondence in the story , on September 29 , Devushkin begs Dobroselova to write to him . Dobroselova responds saying that " all is over " an to not forget her . The last letter is from Devushkin saying that he loves her and that he will die when he leaves her . 
 = = Main characters = = 
 Makar <unk> Devushkin ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) – the protagonist of Poor Folk is a shy , poor and lonely forty @-@ seven @-@ year @-@ old clerk and copyist . He has been compared to other clerks from the " natural school " such as " The Overcoat " ' s Akaka <unk> . Although trying to use literature to understand life , Devushkin does not discuss these topics separately , and falsely believes that Dobroselova 's letters reflect his life , taking short stories as realistic works . He exhibits typical sentimental characteristics ; according to Robert Payne , Dostoyevsky " writes on the edge of sentimentality , but he is a completely credible and rounded figure " . Devushkin 's name derives from <unk> , meaning maiden or girl , possibly symbolizing virginity and innocence , although Joseph Frank remarked it is an incongruent description . 
 Varvara <unk> Dobroselova ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) – lives in similar conditions as Devushkin . Her decision to live with the unscrupulous Mr. Bykov makes her an outsider , not typical of sentimental novels ; unlike the heroine in Samuel Richardson 's 1748 novel Clarissa , she chooses the materialistic path and loses her interest in literature . Her name derives from dobro , meaning good , symbolizing her good @-@ hearted personality . 
 Mr. Bykov ( <unk> ) – an old , rich , brutal widower . Successfully proposes to Dobroselova at the end . His name derives from <unk> , meaning bull , symbolizing sexual power and lust .

 Dostoyevsky showed interest in literature since his childhood . His mother 's subscription to the Library of Reading enabled the family entry into the leading contemporary Russian and non @-@ Russian literature . Gothic tales , such as by Ann Radcliffe , was the first genre Dostoyevsky was introduced to . Other formative influences were the works by the poets Alexander Pushkin and Vasily Zhukovsky , heroic epics usually by Homer and chivalric novels by Cervantes and Walter Scott . 
 Dostoyevsky initially attended the best private school in Moscow , the <unk> boarding school . Founded by a Czech immigrant , who moved to Russia after the Napoleonic Wars , it put strong emphasis on literature . As the school required 800 rubles per year , his father had to do additional work and ask his aristocratic relatives , the <unk> , for money . Although Dostoyevsky settled in well , he had to leave after his mother 's death on 27 September 1837 led to financial problems for his family . He was sent to the Military Engineering @-@ Technical University , he had problems adjusting to life there , but nevertheless managed to graduate on 12 August 1843 as a military engineer . After his graduation , he lived a quite liberal lifestyle , attending many plays and the ballets of composers Ole Bull and Franz Liszt , and renting an expensive apartment , the <unk> House , for 1 @,@ 200 rubles , even though he was only earning 5 @,@ 000 rubles per year . These events and his introduction to casinos were responsible for his deteriorating financial situation . He worked as a translator , but the translations he completed in 1843 , such as Balzac 's Eugénie Grandet and Sand 's La dernière Aldini , were not very successful . His gambling and betting on billiard games were a huge drain on his funds because of his frequent losses . As a consequence , Dostoyevsky was often forced to ask his relatives for money , but he felt uncomfortable doing so and decided to write a novel to raise money . " It 's simply a case " Dostoyevsky wrote to his brother Mikhail , " of my novel covering all . If I fail in this , I 'll hang myself . " 
 Dostoyevsky began working on Poor Folk in early 1844 . He first mentioned the upcoming work in a letter to Mikhail on 30 September 1844 : " I am finishing up a novel of the size of Eugénie Grandet . It 's a rather original work . " Dostoyevsky later wrote to his brother on 23 March 1845 , " I finished the novel in November , then rewrote it in December , and again in February – March . I am seriously satisfied with my novel . It is a serious and elegant work ... " Sometime around April 1845 , his friend Dmitry Grigorovich , with whom he had shared an apartment since the autumn of 1844 , proposed giving the manuscript to poet Nikolay Nekrasov , who was planning to issue an anthology in 1846 . Dostoyevsky took the manuscript to Nekrasov and returned home . Shortly afterwards the doorbell of his house rang , and he opened the door to the excited Nekrasov and Grigorovich , both of whom congratulated him on his debut novel , of which they had only read 10 pages . They finished the full 112 @-@ page work during the night at Dostoyevsky 's apartment . The next morning , the three men went to the critic Vissarion Belinsky ; Nekrasov proclaimed Dostoyevsky " the New Gogol " though Belinsky replied sceptically " You find Gogol 's springing up like mushrooms " . Dostoyevsky himself did not believe his book would receive a positive review from Belinsky , but when Nekrasov visited Belinsky in the evening , the latter wanted to meet Dostoyevsky to congratulate him on his debut . Dostoyevsky proposed to issue Poor Folk in the Fatherland Notes , but it was instead published in the almanac St. Petersburg Collection on January 15 , 1846 . 
 = = Themes and style = = 
 Poor Folk explores poverty and the relationship between the poor and the rich , common themes of literary naturalism . Largely influenced by Nikolai Gogol 's " The Overcoat " , Alexander Pushkin 's " The Stationmaster " and Letters of Abelard and Heloise by Peter Abelard and Héloïse d ’ Argenteuil , it is an epistolary novel composed of letters written by Varvara and her close friend Makar Devushkin . The name of the book and the main female character were adapted from Karamzin 's Poor Liza . Additional elements include the backgrounds of the two protagonists and the tragic ending , both typical characteristics of a middle @-@ class novel . 
 Belinsky and others saw " The Overcoat " as the inspiration for the novel . Later critics stated that the sentimental @-@ humanitarian Poor Folk contained a great deal of parody and satire of Gogol books ; however , there are some dissenters . Karin Jeanette Harmon guesses in " Double Parody Equals Anti @-@ Parody " that Dostoyevsky mixes the parody of the sentimental epistolary novel with the parody of the naturalistic sketch of the clerk . Robert Payne rejects the idea of any satiric content ; he notes that satire began in The Double . A similar view was held by Belinsky , who also stated that " Dostoyevsky 's talent is ... not descriptive , but to the highest degree creative . " Victor Terras thought that Dostoyevsky did not use satire except in a few cases , but instead employed a " humor derived from the eternal conflict between the simple soul of a good man and the complex apparatus of the soulless , institutionalized society run by ' clever ' people . " Joseph Frank , who suggested that the whole work is a " serious parody " , recalled that Poor Folk burlesques the " high @-@ society adventure novel , the <unk> humorous local color @-@ tale " and " the debunking physiological sketch " . Victor Terras dubbed it a " travesty of the sentimental epistolary love story . " The Contemporary stated " In this work comedy is somehow explored and includes an appreciable tone , colour and even the language of Gogol and <unk> " . " Through his tale " , wrote The Northern Bee , " Dostoyevsky wanted to utilize Gogol 's humour with naive simplicity of the undisturbed <unk> . " 
 According to critic Rebecca Epstein Matveyev , Pushkin 's " The Stationmaster " serves as a " thematic subtext , as a basis for Devushkin 's literary experiments , and as a resource for his epistolary relationship . " Both , " The Stationmaster " and " The Overcoat " , are mentioned in the letters between Dobroselova and Devushkin . Dostoyevsky may have chosen the epistolary genre to include his personal critical observations , similar to real @-@ life letters between writer and addressee . According to <unk> , Dostoyevsky uses Poor Folk as his diary . However , as an external narrator is missing the only source for the character 's motivation and personality is available in the letters and Dobroselova 's diary . The numerous different voices , that is Devushkin 's quotations from stories , his commentaries about these books and his own works , is an example of polyphony . These effects confuse the reader and hide the narrator . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Poor Folk received nationwide critical acclaim . Dostoyevsky observed that " the whole of Russia is talking about my Poor Folk " . As soon as he read the manuscript for Poor Folk , Belinsky named it Russia 's first " social novel " . Alexander Herzen praised the book in his essay " About the Progress of Revolutionary Ideas in Russia " , noting the book 's " socialistic tendencies and animations . " The work was classified by critic Pavel <unk> as a work of the so @-@ called " natural school " . The newspaper The Northern Bee recorded : 
 News about a new genius , Mr. Dostoevsky , is circulating across St. Petersburg . We do not know whether it is his real name or a pen @-@ name . The reading audience is praising his new novel , Poor People . I have read this novel and said : ' Poor Russian readers ! ' However , Mr. Dostoevsky is a man of some talent and , if he finds his way in literature , he will be able to write something decent . " 
 Nikolay <unk> in the 1861 essay " <unk> People " , that Dostoyevsky studies poor reality and expresses humanistic ideas . He also praised him for illustrating human nature and taking out " souls in the centre of the depth which are caged after protesting for <unk> against the exterior , violent pressure , and presents it to our verdict . " 
 Apollon Grigoriev wrote in The Finnish Herald : " Dostoevsky starts to play in our literature the same role Hoffmann played in German literature ... He became so deeply immersed in the life of civil servants that the dull and uninteresting everyday life became for him a nightmare close to madness . " Count Vladimir <unk> also liked the novel , stating that " it was written with force and simplicity by a great talent . " Valerian <unk> noted after a number of publications by Dostoyevsky : " Gogol was usually the leading social poet , while Dostoyevsky usually the leading psychological poet . The former is known as the representative of the contemporary society or contemporary circle , for the latter the society itself becomes interesting through its influence on other people . "

 Between the Times and the Tides is the ninth studio album by the American alternative rock musician Lee Ranaldo , released on March 20 , 2012 on Matador Records . His first release on Matador Records and since Sonic Youth 's indefinite hiatus , the album features a more straightforward songwriting approach to his prior material and includes guest musicians such as Nels Cline , John Medeski and Leah Singer . The album was originally intended to be a minimalist acoustic album but its sound was developed by Ranaldo during its recording at Echo Canyon West in Hoboken , New Jersey during a seven @-@ month period in early 2011 . 
 Between the Times and the Tide 's sound was influenced by Joni Mitchell , Neil Young and Leonard Cohen , as well as contemporary artists such as Cat Power . The title of the album comes from a lyric in the song " Xtina as I Knew Her " . Upon its release , Between the Times and the Times received positive critical acclaim and charted in four countries , including Belgium , France , Germany and the United States . Its two singles — " Off the Wall " and " Shouts " — were moderate critical successes but failed to chart . The album 's release was followed by two tours of North America and Oceania from April to October 2012 , which included appearances at various music festivals , including All Tomorrow 's Parties I 'll Be Your Mirror and the Melbourne International Arts Festival .

 During his time as the lead guitarist of Sonic Youth , Lee Ranaldo had considered recording a " simple , acoustic album " of original songs " with just an acoustic guitar and a microphone . " After the release of Maelstrom from Drift — a collection of group improvisations , live recordings and home studio sessions — in 2008 , Ranaldo 's plans developed further . Following Sonic Youth 's indefinite hiatus , he began arranging the material with contributors such as Nels Cline , John Medeski and Bob Bert . All three musicians , except Bert , had recorded renditions of Bob Dylan songs for the soundtrack to his 2007 biopic , I 'm Not There , as The Million Dollar Bashers . Most of the material he began arranging had been written between June and August 2010 when the songs " just kept flowing out behind that one [ " Lost " ] . " 
 = = Recording = = 
 Ranaldo originally recorded acoustic demos for Between the Times and the Tides on his iPhone . He later rerecorded them in @-@ studio with Steve Shelley , the drummer of Sonic Youth . According to Ranaldo , the subsequent demo recording led to the development of the songs , which then became " guitar @-@ and @-@ bass @-@ and @-@ drums demos . " He referred to the recording process of the album as " gradual but really organic . " When he began recording the album in January 2011 at Echo Canyon West in Hoboken , New Jersey , Ranaldo " started laying them down in a little bit more hi – fi fashion " , using studio equipment and effects pedals . 
 Ranaldo used his signature Fender Jazzmaster guitar during the recording sessions of Between the Times and the Times and a custom @-@ built electric guitar by Jarrell Guitars . Several Martin and Gibson acoustic guitars were used , including a Martin D @-@ 35 , Martin <unk> , Gibson J @-@ 50 and Gibson J @-@ 45 .

According to Ranaldo , he did not " deliberately " suppress noise composition but with earlier acoustic versions of the songs he would " often kind of ' Sonic ' them up . " The album 's overall sound has been described as " a set of catchy , poppy tunes that establish a new aspect in [ Ranaldo 's ] career . " Ranaldo further explained that " it wasn 't a conscious choice to write pop songs , they just sprung out of the guitars . " 
 Certain musicians influenced Ranaldo 's songwriting including Joni Mitchell , Neil Young , Leonard Cohen and Cat Power , which he referred to as " a kind of older generation of songwriting . " He also mentioned Bob Dylan 's Blonde on Blonde ( 1966 ) as a particular influence . Ranaldo stated that " these songs were allowed to breathe because they weren 't sent through the fan machine . When Sonic Youth writes music , we write everything in a very communal way . It doesn 't matter who brought something in initially , it all gets transformed by the band . In this case , I was making decisions , and I wanted them to have a certain kind of simplicity . They ended up more personal for that reason . " 
 All of the songs on Between the Times and the Tides are composed in alternate guitar tunings , except " Fire Island " which is composed in standard tuning . Speaking of the use of tunings on the album , Ranaldo said " they 're all brand @-@ new tunings on this album , none of them are from the Sonic Youth period . They 're things that started happening , and you just sort of roll with it . " He further explained that " Fire Island " was the first song he composed in standard tuning since Sonic Youth 's debut EP , released in 1982 . " Waiting on a Dream " , the album 's opening track , contains a guitar riff that , according to Damian Fanelli , resembles The Rolling Stones ' 1966 song " Paint It , Black " and " Tomorrow Never Comes " , the album 's closing track , references The Beatles ' 1966 song " Tomorrow Never Knows . "

 Ranaldo and Matt De Jong designed Between the Times and the Tides ' artwork , which included photographs by Kelly Jeffrey and Ranaldo 's son , Cody . The front cover art features Ranaldo walking past " Walking Men 99 " — an art project in Lower Manhattan , New York , created by artist Maya <unk> . Ranaldo became interested in the project as he passed it daily and contacted <unk> who was " humbled to be approached by Lee . " 
 Speaking of the album cover , Ranaldo said : " in some ways the whole album started with the cover photo , and I kind of built it up from there . A young Canadian photographer took that photo of me in September 2010 during an interview session about legendary Canadian group The Nihilist <unk> Band . When I saw the photo I thought it looked so much like a cool album cover . At that point I only had three or four acoustic demos going , and it remained in the back of my mind that if I ever made enough songs for an album , I ’ d use that pic as the cover . So that helped push me to develop the songs . " 
 = = Release = = 
 On November 10 , 2011 , Between the Times and the Tides was announced for release through an online blog post by Matador Records . The title of the album comes from a lyric in the song " Xtina as I Knew Her " . The album was released worldwide on March 20 , 2012 on Matador . It was released in a number of formats , including CD , LP , FLAC and MP3 . Demo versions of " Stranded " , " Shouts " and " Waiting on a Dream " were included as bonus tracks on the iTunes version of the release . Two singles were released from the album : " Off the Wall " and " Shouts " . " Off the Wall " was released as a 7 " record and digital download package on January 14 and " Shouts " , which featured alternate mixes not found on the album , was released on May 8 . 
 Ranaldo promoted Between the Times and the Tides ' release with a 28 @-@ date tour throughout the United States and Europe , with Wilco , <unk> and M. Ward supporting . The tour began on April 10 , 2010 at The Satellite in Los Angeles , California and concluded on August 3 at the Highland Bowl in Rochester , New York . In October , Ranaldo performed three shows in Australia at the Oxford Art Factory in Sydney on October 20 , The Zoo in Brisbane on October 21 and at The Hi @-@ Fi on October 24 , as part of the Melbourne Festival . Local Australian bands Pony Face and We All Want To supported Ranaldo 's performances in Sydney and Brisbane . 
 Between the Times and the Tides charted in four countries upon its release . It reached number 79 on the Belgian Albums Chart in Flanders , number 149 on the French Albums Chart and number 92 on the German Albums Chart . In the U.S , the album peaked at number 13 on Billboard 's Heatseeker Albums chart and number 24 on the Tastemaker Albums chart . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Between the Times and the Tides received generally positive reviews from critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications , it received an average score of 74 , based on 24 reviews . Writing for MSN Music , Robert Christgau said Ranaldo 's beautifully played guitar work and monophonic compositions complement his good @-@ natured , cogent lyrics , which are " always palpable whether the songs reach out or <unk> his options " . AllMusic reviewer Heather Phares wrote that he " expands on those qualities in his music and reveals new ones " , " displays a strong and surprising classic rock streak " and " gets downright hippie @-@ ish , in a good way . " In a review for The A.V. Club , Elliott Sharp said " Ranaldo 's songs mostly adhere to a guitar @-@ driven melancholic @-@ pop mold , with songs like ' Off The Wall , ' ' Angles , ' and ' Lost ' recalling Sonic Youth ’ s 2006 effort Rather Ripped as well as early R.E.M. " . Spencer Grady from BBC Music compared the music to The Byrds , Neil Young and R.E.M. , and added that " flaws which initially seem awkward begin to make perfect sense after a few listens " . Drowned in Sound 's J.R. Moores said it was " advertised as his first ' rock album ' " and impresses sonically . Filter critic Loren <unk> <unk> wrote " at times sounding like Hendrix operating a theremin , and elsewhere resembling the mournful cries of lonesome satellites " , Ranaldo 's songs " are accomplished and take surprising turns , shot through with a mellow fury that 's endlessly appealing . " 
 In a less enthusiastic review for The Guardian , Killian Fox said Between the Times and the Tides was " more interesting sonically in the tension between questing guitars and straightforward song structures than it is in terms of lyrics , which aim to be down to earth but end up middle of the road . " NME writer John Doran wrote , " sure enough here are a wealth of rock gems that shine with a warm @-@ hearted , Neil Young @-@ like intensity . Those wanting <unk> and dissonance will be disappointed , but everyone else will be pleasantly surprised . " Writing for Pitchfork Media , Grayson Currin deemed it a " motley assortment of Sonic Youth nods , acoustic entreaties , and cloying pop @-@ rockers " but that " Ranaldo 's opportunity to step out of the Sonic Youth shadows and into his own proper spotlight is mostly a miss made of mediocrity . " Ben Graham from The Quietus summarised the album as : " while it may be traditional in structure , Between the Times and the Tides is innovative and inimitable in actual performance . The playing may draw on jazz , country , rock and Ranaldo 's own avant @-@ garde catalogue . " In Rolling Stone , Will Hermes found it " great to hear the third voice in Sonic Youth stretching out . But it 's also a reminder of their irreplaceable magic . "

 = Banksia oblongifolia = 
 Banksia oblongifolia , commonly known as the fern @-@ leaved , dwarf banksia or rusty banksia , is a species in the plant genus Banksia . Found along the eastern coast of Australia from Wollongong , New South Wales in the south to Rockhampton , Queensland in the north , it generally grows in sandy soils in heath , open forest or swamp margins and wet areas . A many @-@ stemmed shrub up to 3 m ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) high , it has leathery serrated leaves and rusty @-@ coloured new growth . The yellow flower spikes , known as inflorescences , most commonly appear in autumn and early winter . Up to 80 follicles , or seed pods , develop on the spikes after flowering . Banksia oblongifolia resprouts from its woody lignotuber after bushfires , and the seed pods open and release seed when burnt , the seed germinating and growing on burnt ground . Some plants grow between fires from seed shed spontaneously . 
 Spanish botanist Antonio José Cavanilles described B. oblongifolia in 1800 , though it was known as Banksia <unk> in New South Wales for many years . However , the latter name , originally coined by Richard Anthony Salisbury , proved invalid , and Banksia oblongifolia has been universally adopted as the correct scientific name since 1981 . Two varieties were recognised in 1987 , but these have not been generally accepted . A wide array of mammals , birds , and invertebrates visit the inflorescences . Though easily grown as a garden plant , it is not commonly seen in horticulture . 
 = = Description = = 
 Banksia oblongifolia is a shrub that can reach 3 m ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) high , though is generally less than 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) high , with several stems growing out of a woody base known as a lignotuber . The smooth bark is marked with horizontal lenticels , and is reddish @-@ brown fading to greyish @-@ brown with age . New leaves and branchlets are covered with a rusty fur . The leaves lose their fur and become smooth with maturity , and are alternately arranged along the stem . Measuring 5 – 11 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 – 4 @.@ 3 in ) in length and 1 @.@ 5 – 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 59 – 0 @.@ 79 in ) in width , the leathery green leaves are oblong to obovate ( egg @-@ shaped ) or truncate with a recessed midvein and mildly recurved margins , which are entire at the base and serrate towards the ends of the leaves . The sinuses ( spaces between the teeth ) are U @-@ shaped and teeth are 1 – 2 mm long . The leaf underside is whitish with a reticulated vein pattern and a raised central midrib . The leaves sit on 2 – 5 mm long petioles . 
 Flowering has been recorded between January and October , with a peak in autumn and early winter ( April to June ) . The inflorescences , or flower spikes , arise from the end of 1 to 5 year old branchlets , and often have a whorl of branchlets arising from the node or base . Measuring 5 – 15 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 – 5 @.@ 9 in ) high and 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) wide , the yellow spikes often have blue @-@ grey tinged limbs in bud , though occasionally pinkish , mauve or mauve @-@ blue limbs are seen . Opening to a pale yellow after anthesis , the spikes lose their flowers with age and swell to up to 17 @.@ 5 cm ( 6 @.@ 9 in ) high and 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) wide , with up to 80 follicles . Covered with fine fur but becoming smooth with age , the oval @-@ shaped follicles measure 1 – 1 @.@ 8 cm ( 0 @.@ 39 – 0 @.@ 71 in ) long by 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 7 cm high ( 0 @.@ 1 – 0 @.@ 3 in ) and 0 @.@ 3 – 0 @.@ 7 cm ( 0 @.@ 12 – 0 @.@ 28 in ) wide . The bare swollen spike , now known as an infructescence , is patterned with short spiky persistent bracts on its surface where follicles have not developed . Each follicle contains one or two obovate dark grey @-@ brown to black seeds sandwiching a woody separator . Measuring 1 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 8 cm ( 0 @.@ 47 – 0 @.@ 71 in ) long , they are made up of an oblong to semi @-@ elliptic smooth or slightly ridged seed body , 0 @.@ 7 – 1 @.@ 1 cm ( 0 @.@ 28 – 0 @.@ 43 in ) long by 0 @.@ 3 – 0 @.@ 7 cm ( 0 @.@ 12 – 0 @.@ 28 in ) wide . The woody separator is the same shape as the seed , with an impression where the seed body lies next to it . Seedlings have bright obovate green cotyledons 1 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 47 – 0 @.@ 59 in ) long and 0 @.@ 5 – 0 @.@ 7 cm wide ( 0 @.@ 2 in ) , which sit on a stalk , or 1 mm diameter finely hairy seedling stem , known as the hypocotyl , which is less than 1 cm high . The first seedling leaves to emerge are paired ( oppositely arranged ) and lanceolate with fine @-@ toothed margins , measuring 2 @.@ 5 – 3 cm long and 0 @.@ 4 – 0 @.@ 5 cm wide . Subsequent leaves are more oblanceolate , elliptic ( oval @-@ shaped ) or linear . Young plants develop a lignotuber in their first year . 
 Banksia oblongifolia can be distinguished from B. robur , which it often co @-@ occurs with , by its smaller leaves and bare fruiting spikes . B. robur has more metallic green flower spikes , and often grows in wetter areas within the same region . B. plagiocarpa has longer leaves with more coarsely serrated margins , and its flower spikes are blue @-@ grey in bud , and later bear wedge @-@ shaped follicles . In the Sydney Basin , B. paludosa also bears a superficial resemblance to B. oblongifolia , but its leaves are more prominently spathulate ( spoon @-@ shaped ) and tend to point up rather than down . The leaf undersides are white and lack the prominent midrib of B. oblongifolia , the new growth is bare and lacks the rusty fur , and the aged flower parts remain on the old spikes . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 First collected by Luis Née between March and April 1793 , the fern @-@ leaved banksia was described by Antonio José Cavanilles in 1800 as two separate species from two collections , first as Banksia oblongifolia from the vicinity of Port Jackson ( Sydney ) , and then as Banksia salicifolia from around Botany Bay . Derived from the Latin words oblongus " oblong " , and folium " leaf " , the species name refers to the shape of the leaves . Richard Anthony Salisbury had published the name Banksia aspleniifolia in 1796 based on leaves of cultivated material . 
 Robert Brown recorded 31 species of Banksia in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen , and used the epithet oblongifolia in his taxonomic arrangement , placing the taxon in the subgenus Banksia verae , the " True Banksias " , because the inflorescence is a typical Banksia flower spike . He recognised B. salicifolia as the same species at this point , but was unsure whether Salisbury 's B. aspleniifolia belonged under the same name . By the time Carl Meissner published his 1856 arrangement of the genus , there were 58 described Banksia species . Meissner divided Brown 's Banksia verae , which had been renamed Eubanksia by Stephan Endlicher in 1847 , into four series based on leaf properties . He followed Brown in using the name B. oblongifolia , and placed it in the series Salicinae . 
 In 1870 , George Bentham published a thorough revision of Banksia in his landmark publication Flora Australiensis . In Bentham 's arrangement , the number of recognised Banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46 . He declared B. oblongifolia referrable to , and a synonym of , B. integrifolia . Bentham defined four sections based on leaf , style and pollen @-@ presenter characters . B. integrifolia was placed in section Eubanksia . 
 Botanists in the 20th century recognised B. oblongifolia as a species in its own right , but disagreed on the name . Those in Queensland felt Salisbury 's name was invalid and used Banksia oblongifolia , while New South Wales authorities used Banksia aspleniifolia as it was the oldest published name for the species . Botanist and banksia authority Alex George ruled that oblongifolia was the correct name in his 1981 revision of the genus . After reviewing Salisbury 's original species description , which is of the leaves alone , he concluded that it does not diagnose the species to the exclusion of others and is hence not a validly published name — the description could have applied to juvenile leaves of B. paludosa , B. integrifolia or even B. marginata . 
 = = = Placement within Banksia = = = 
 The current taxonomic arrangement of the Banksia genus is based on botanist Alex George 's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series . In this arrangement , B. oblongifolia is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia , because its inflorescences take the form of Banksia 's characteristic flower spikes , section Banksia because of its straight styles , and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical . In a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994 , Kevin Thiele placed it in the newly described subseries <unk> along with B. plagiocarpa , B. robur and B. dentata within the series Salicinae . However , this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George . B. oblongifolia 's placement within Banksia may be summarised as follows : 
 Genus Banksia 
 Subgenus Isostylis 
 Subgenus Banksia 
 Section Oncostylis 
 Section Coccinea 
 Section Banksia 
 Series Grandes 
 Series Banksia 
 Series Crocinae 
 Series Prostratae 
 Series Cyrtostylis 
 Series Tetragonae 
 Series Bauerinae 
 Series Quercinae 
 Series Salicinae 
 B. dentata – B. aquilonia – B. integrifolia – B. plagiocarpa – B. oblongifolia – B. robur – B. conferta – B. paludosa – B. marginata – B. canei – B. saxicola 
 Since 1998 , American botanist Austin Mast and co @-@ authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae , which then comprised genera Banksia and Dryandra . Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George 's taxonomic arrangement . Banksia oblongifolia resolves as the closest relative , or " sister " , to B. robur , with B. plagiocarpa as next closest relative . In 2007 , Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus Banksia by merging Dryandra into it , and published B. subg . Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon @-@ shaped cotyledons ; thus B. subg . Banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon @-@ shaped cotyledons . They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete ; in the meantime , if Mast and Thiele 's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement , B. oblongifolia is placed in B. subg . Spathulatae . 
 = = = Variation = = = 
 George noted that Banksia oblongifolia showed considerable variation in habit , and in 1987 Conran and Clifford separated the taxon into two subspecies . In examining populations in southern Queensland , they reported that the two forms were distinct in growth habit and habitat , and that they did not find any intermediate forms . New South Wales botanists Joseph Maiden and Julius Henry Camfield had collected this taller form of B. oblongifolia in Kogarah in 1898 , and given it the name Banksia latifolia variety minor — B. latifolia being a published name by which B. robur was known — before Maiden and Ernst <unk> renamed it Banksia robur variety minor . This name ( confusingly ) thus became the name for the taller variety . They defined variety oblongifolia as a multistemmed shrub 0 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 3 m ( 20 – 51 in ) high , with leaves 3 – 11 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 4 @.@ 3 in ) long and 1 – 2 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 39 – 0 @.@ 98 in ) wide , and flower spikes 4 – 10 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 3 @.@ 9 in ) high . The habitat is swamps and swamp borders , or rarely sandstone ridges . Variety minor is a taller shrub 1 – 3 @.@ 5 m ( 3 @.@ 3 – 11 @.@ 5 ft ) high with leaves up to 16 cm ( 6 @.@ 3 in ) long and spikes 6 to 14 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 to 5 @.@ 5 in ) high . It is an understory plant in sclerophyll forests , associated with Eucalyptus signata and Banksia spinulosa var. collina . Both subspecies occur throughout the range . However , George rejected the varieties , stating the variability was continuous . 
 = = = Hybridization = = = 
 Banksia robur and B. oblongifolia hybrids have been recorded at several locations along the eastern coastline . Field workers for The Banksia Atlas recorded 20 populations between Wollongong and <unk> in central Queensland . Locales include <unk> north of Sydney , Ku @-@ ring @-@ gai Chase National Park , and <unk> Dam near Wollongong . A study of an area of extensive hybridization between the two near <unk> Forest on the Woronora Plateau south of Sydney revealed extensive hybridisation in mixed species stands but almost none in pure stands of either species there . Genetic analysis showed generations of crossing and complex ancestry . Morphology generally correlated with genetic profile , but occasionally plants that resembled one parent had some degree of genetic hybridisation . Furthermore , there were a few plants with morphology suggestive of a third species , B. paludosa , in their parentage , and requiring further investigation . A possible hybrid between B. oblongifolia and B. integrifolia was recorded near Caloundra by Banksia Atlas volunteers . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Banksia oblongifolia occurs along the eastern coast of Australia from Wollongong , New South Wales in the south to Rockhampton , Queensland in the north . There are isolated populations offshore on Fraser Island , and inland at Blackdown Tableland National Park and Crows Nest in Queensland , and also inland incursions at the base of the Glasshouse Mountains in southern Queensland , at Grafton in northern New South Wales , and <unk> and Lawson in the Blue Mountains west of <unk> oblongifolia grows in a range of habitats — in damp areas with poor drainage , along the edges of swamps and flats , as well as wallum shrubland , or coastal plateaux . It is also found in open forest or woodland , where it grows on ridges or slopes , or heath . Soils are predominantly sandy or sandstone @-@ based , though granite @-@ based and clay @-@ loams are sometimes present . 
 Associated species in the Sydney region include heathland species such as heath banksia ( Banksia ericifolia ) , coral heath ( Epacris microphylla ) and mountain devil ( Lambertia formosa ) , and tick bush ( Kunzea ambigua ) and prickly @-@ leaved paperbark ( Melaleuca nodosa ) in taller scrub , and under trees such as scribbly gum ( Eucalyptus sclerophylla ) and narrow @-@ leaved apple ( Angophora bakeri ) in woodland . The Agnes Banks Woodland in western Sydney has been recognised by the New South Wales Government as an Endangered Ecological Community . Here B. oblongifolia is an understory plant in low open woodland , with scribbly gum , narrow @-@ leaved apple and old man banksia ( B. serrata ) as canopy trees , and wallum banksia ( B. aemula ) , variable smoke @-@ bush ( Conospermum <unk> ) , wedding bush ( <unk> pinifolius ) , showy parrot @-@ pea ( Dillwynia sericea ) and nodding geebung ( Persoonia nutans ) as other understory species . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Banksia oblongifolia plants can live for more than 60 years . They respond to bushfire by resprouting from buds located on the large woody lignotuber . Larger lignotubers have the greatest number of buds , although buds are more densely spaced on smaller lignotubers . A 1988 field study in Ku @-@ ring @-@ gai Chase National Park found that shoots grow longer after fire , particularly one within the previous four years , and that new buds grow within six months after a fire . These shoots are able to grow , flower and set seed two to three years after a fire . The woody infructescences also release seeds as their follicles are opened with heat , although a proportion do open spontaneously at other times . One field study in Ku @-@ ring @-@ gai Chase National Park found 10 % opened in the absence of bushfire , and that seeds germinated , and young plants do grow . Older plants are serotinous , that is , they store large numbers of seed in an aerial seed bank in their canopy that are released after fire . Being relatively heavy , the seeds do not disperse far from the parent plant . 
 Bird species that have been observed foraging and feeding at the flowers include the red wattlebird ( Anthochaera carunculata ) , Lewin 's honeyeater ( Meliphaga lewinii ) , brown honeyeater ( Lichmera indistincta ) , tawny @-@ crowned honeyeater ( Gliciphila melanops ) , yellow @-@ faced honeyeater ( Lichenostomus chrysops ) , white @-@ plumed honeyeater ( L. penicillatus ) , white @-@ cheeked honeyeater ( Phylidonyris niger ) , New Holland honeyeater ( P. novaehollandiae ) , noisy friarbird ( Philemon corniculatus ) , noisy miner ( Manorina melanocephala ) and eastern spinebill ( Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris ) . Insects recorded visiting flower spikes include the European honey bee and ants . The swamp wallaby ( <unk> bicolor ) eats new shoots that grow from lignotubers after bushfire . 
 One field study found 30 % of seeds were eaten by insects between bushfires . Insects recovered from inflorescences include the banksia boring moth ( Arotrophora <unk> ) , younger instars of which eat flower and bract parts before tunneling into the woody axis of the spike as they get older and boring into follicles and eating seeds . Other seed predators include unidentified species of moth of the genera <unk> and Xylorycta , as well as <unk> <unk> , Chalarotona <unk> and Chalarotona <unk> and an unidentified weevil species . The fungal species Asterina systema @-@ solare , <unk> banksiae and <unk> banksiae have been recorded on the leaves . 
 Like most other proteaceae , B. oblongifolia has proteoid roots — roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter . These enhance solubilisation of nutrients , allowing nutrient uptake in low @-@ nutrient soils such as the phosphorus @-@ deficient native soils of Australia . A study of coastal heaths on Pleistocene sand dunes around the Myall Lakes found B. oblongifolia on slopes ( wet heath ) and B. aemula grew on ridges ( dry heath ) , and the two species did not overlap . Manipulation of seedlings in the same study area showed that B. oblongifolia can grow longer roots seeking water than other wet heath species and that seedlings can establish in dry heath , but it is as yet unclear why the species does not grow in dry heath as well as wet heath . Unlike similar situations with Banksia species in Western Australia , the two species did not appear to impact negatively on each other . 
 = = Cultivation = = 
 Conrad Loddiges and his sons wrote of Banksia oblongifolia in volume 3 of their work The Botanical Cabinet in 1818 , reporting it had been brought into cultivation in 1792 , though had been initially and incorrectly called Banksia dentata . It flowered in November in the United Kingdom , and was grown in a greenhouse over winter . 
 Not commonly cultivated , it adapts readily to garden conditions and tolerates most soils in part @-@ shade or full sun . The colours of the inflorescences in bud , and timing of flowers into winter give it horticultural value , as does its reddish new growth . Larger plants have taller flower spikes . It is propagated readily from seed , with young plants taking five to seven years to flower from seed . Pruning can improve the shrub 's appearance , and it is a potential bonsai subject .

 Red Dwarf is a British comedy franchise which primarily comprises ten series ( the ninth being a mini @-@ series ) of a television science fiction sitcom that aired on BBC Two between 1988 and 1993 and from 1997 to 1999 , and on Dave in 2009 and 2012 , gaining a cult following . In May 2015 , it was announced that Series XI and XII will film back @-@ to @-@ back later in 2015 and will air exclusively on the Dave channel in 2016 and 2017 . 
 The series was created by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor . In addition to the television episodes , there are four novels , two pilot episodes for an American version of the show , a radio version produced for BBC Radio 7 , tie @-@ in books , magazines and other merchandise . 
 Despite the pastiche of science fiction used as a backdrop , Red Dwarf is primarily a character @-@ driven comedy , with off @-@ the @-@ wall science fiction elements used as complementary plot devices . In the early episodes , a recurring source of comedy was the Odd Couple @-@ style relationship between the two central characters of the show , who have an intense dislike for each other yet are trapped together deep in space . The main characters are Dave Lister , the last known human alive , and Arnold Rimmer , a hologram of Lister 's dead bunkmate . The other regular characters are Cat , a lifeform which evolved from the descendants of Lister 's pregnant pet cat Frankenstein ; Holly , Red Dwarf 's computer ; Kryten , a service mechanoid ; and , as of Series VII to Back to Earth , Kristine Kochanski , an alternative @-@ reality version of Lister 's long @-@ lost love . 
 One of the series ' highest accolades came in 1994 , when an episode from the sixth series , " Gunmen of the Apocalypse " , won an International Emmy Award in the Popular Arts category , and in the same year the series was also awarded " Best BBC Comedy Series " at the British Comedy Awards . The series attracted its highest ratings , of more than eight million viewers , during the eighth series in 1999 . The series was revived after a ten @-@ year break , when digital channel Dave screened a three @-@ episode production , titled Red Dwarf : Back to Earth , in April 2009 during the Easter weekend . This was followed by Series X , consisting of six episodes , which was first broadcast on Dave in October / November 2012 . The show has been critically acclaimed , and has a Metacritic score of 84 / 100 . 
 = = Radio origins = = 
 The show was based on Dave Hollins : Space Cadet , a series of five sketches that aired in the BBC Radio 4 series Son of Cliché , produced by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor in 1984 . 
 The sketches recounted the adventures of Dave Hollins ( voiced by Nick Wilton ) , a hapless space traveller that is marooned in space far from earth . His only steady companion is the computer Hab ( voiced by Chris Barrie ) . 
 Grant and Naylor chose to use the Dave Hollins : Space Cadet sketches as a base for a television show after watching the 1974 film Dark Star . They changed some elements from the sketches : 
 The 7 trillion year figure was first changed to 7 billion years and then to 3 million and the characters of Arnold Rimmer and the Cat were created . The name Dave Hollins was changed to Dave Lister when a football player called Dave Hollins became well @-@ known , and Hab was replaced by Holly . One of the voice actors from Son of Cliché , Chris Barrie went on to portray Arnold Rimmer in the Red Dwarf TV series . 
 Episodes of Dave Hollins can be found on the 2 @-@ disc Red Dwarf DVD sets starting with series 5 and ending with series 8 . 
 = = Setting and plot = = 
 The main setting of the series is the eponymous mining spaceship Red Dwarf , which is 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) long , 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) tall , and 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) wide and is operated by the Jupiter Mining Corporation . In the first episode set sometime in the late 22nd century , an on @-@ board radiation leak of cadmium II kills everyone except for lowest @-@ ranking technician Dave Lister , who is in suspended animation at the time , and his pregnant cat , Frankenstein , who is safely sealed in the cargo hold . Following the accident , the ship 's computer Holly keeps Lister in stasis until the background radiation dies down – a process that takes three million years . Lister therefore emerges as the last human being in the universe – but not alone on @-@ board the ship . His former bunkmate and immediate superior Arnold Judas Rimmer is resurrected by Holly as a hologram to keep Lister sane . At the same time , a creature known only as Cat is the last member on board of Felis sapiens , a race of humanoid felines that evolved in the ship 's hold from Lister 's cat , Frankenstein , and her kittens during the 3 million years that Lister was in stasis . 
 The main dramatic thrust of the early series is Lister 's desire to return home to Earth , although the crew 's ownership of an unlimited time @-@ space travel drive in series seven was to later negate this intention . As their journey begins , the not @-@ so @-@ intrepid crew encounters such phenomena as time distortions , faster @-@ than @-@ light travel , mutant diseases and strange lifeforms that had developed in the intervening millions of years . During the second series , the group encounter the service mechanoid Kryten , rescuing him from a long @-@ since crashed vessel . Initially , Kryten only appeared in one episode of series two , but by the beginning of series three he had become a regular character . At the end of series five , Red Dwarf itself is stolen by persons unknown , forcing the crew to travel in the smaller Starbug craft for two series , with the side @-@ effect that they lose contact with Holly . In series seven , Rimmer departs the crew to take up the role of his alter ego from a parallel universe , Ace Rimmer , whose name has become a long @-@ standing legend and a legacy passed down from dimension to dimension . Shortly afterwards , the crew encounters a parallel version of themselves from a universe in which Kristine Kochanski , Lister 's long @-@ term love interest , had been put into stasis at the time of the leak and so became the last remaining human . A complicated series of events leaves Kochanski stranded in the series ' main universe , where she is forced to join the crew . At the end of series seven , we learn that Kryten 's service nanobots , which had abandoned him years earlier , were behind the theft of the Red Dwarf at the end of series five . 
 At the beginning of the eighth series , Kryten 's nanobots reconstruct the Red Dwarf , which they had broken down into its constituent atoms . In the process , the entire crew of the ship – including a pre @-@ accident Rimmer – are resurrected , but the Starbug crew find themselves sentenced to two years in the ship 's brig ( at first , for crashing a Starbug and bringing onboard Kryten and Cat as stowaways , but later for using information from the confidential files ) . The series ends with a metal @-@ eating virus loose on Red Dwarf . The entire resurrected crew evacuates save the original <unk> . In the cliffhanger ending , Rimmer is left stranded alone to face Death ( and promptly knees him in the groin and flees ) . 
 Nine years later , the four are once more the only beings on the ship . Rimmer is again a hologram , Holly is offline , and Lister is mourning Kochanski , lost to him out of an airlock some time previously . A chance to get back to Earth through a dimension warp presents itself ; although it is not quite what it appears to be , it gives Lister new hope when he learns that Kochanski is still alive after all . 
 The tenth series sees Lister still travelling with Rimmer , Kryten and Cat in Red Dwarf , in hopes of eventually locating Kochanski or returning to Earth , whichever comes first . 
 = = Characters and actors = = 
 Dave Lister , played by Craig Charles , is a genial Liverpudlian and self @-@ described bum . He was the lowest @-@ ranking of the 169 crew members on the ship before the accident . He has a long @-@ standing desire to return to Earth and start a farm and / or diner on Fiji ( which is under three feet of water following a volcanic eruption ) , but is left impossibly far away by the accident , which renders him the last ( known ) surviving member of the human race . He deeply enjoys Indian food , especially chicken vindaloo , which is a recurring theme in the series . 
 Arnold Judas Rimmer <unk> <unk> ( " Bronze swimming certificate " and " Silver swimming certificate " ) , played by Chris Barrie , was the second @-@ lowest ranking member of the crew while they were all alive . He is a fussy , bureaucratic , neurotic coward who , by failing to replace a drive plate properly , is responsible for the Red Dwarf cadmium II accident that kills the entire crew ( including himself ) . Nevertheless , Holly chose him to be the ship 's one available hologram because he considered him the person most likely to keep Lister sane . From the Series III episode " Timeslides " onwards , the timeline of the crew is adjusted and Rimmer 's death is newly attributed to a moment in which he hits a cardboard box filled with explosives . During Series VII , Rimmer leaves the dimension shared by his crewmates to become the new Ace Rimmer . Along with the Red Dwarf ship and its crew , Rimmer is resurrected at the start of Series VIII by nanobots . He comes face to face with Death at the end of the series , whom he kicks in the groin . From the Back to Earth specials onwards , he is once again a hologram . 
 The Cat , played by Danny John @-@ Jules , is a humanoid creature who evolved from the offspring of Lister 's smuggled pet cat Frankenstein . Cat is concerned with little other than sleeping , eating and fawning over his appearance , and tends not to socialise with other members of the crew . He becomes more influenced by his human companions over time , and begins to resemble a stylish , self @-@ centred human . It is later revealed that , unlike his human companions , he has a " cool " sounding pulse , six nipples and colour @-@ coordinated internal organs . 
 Kryten , full name Kryten <unk> @-@ <unk> ( played by Robert Llewellyn from series III onwards , and as a one @-@ off appearance in series II by David Ross ) , was rescued by the crew from the crashed spaceship Nova 5 in series II , upon which he had continued to serve the ship 's crew despite their having been dead for thousands or even millions of years . Kryten is a Service <unk> and when first encountered by the crew , he was bound by his " behavioural protocols " , but Lister gradually encouraged him to break his programming and think for himself . His change in appearance between the two actors is explained away by an accident involving Lister 's <unk> and Lister having to repair him . 
 Holly , the ship 's computer , ( played by Norman Lovett during series I , II , VII and VIII and Hattie Hayridge in series III to V ) . Holly has a functional IQ of 6000 , although this is severely depleted by the three million years of runtime and lack of repairs . Holly is left alone after the radiation accident that kills Rimmer and the rest of the crew except for Lister and the Cat . The computer had developed " computer senility " before the radiation accident , rendering it functionally inert . The change in appearance for series III is explained by Holly having changed his face to resemble that of a computer from a parallel universe " with whom he 'd once fallen madly in love " . 
 Kristine Kochanski ( originally portrayed by Clare Grogan before Chloë Annett took on the role from series VII ) was initially a Red Dwarf navigation officer whom Lister had a crush on ( later retroactively altered to be his ex @-@ girlfriend ) and whose memory he had cherished ever since . In one episode , the crew happens upon an alternative dimension where Kochanski survived the Red Dwarf cadmium II accident . She joins Lister and the crew after the link to her own dimension collapses . By the first episode of the Red Dwarf : Back to Earth specials , Lister believes her dead , but it is later revealed that Kryten ( the sole witness to her " death " ) had lied to Lister . Kochanski had instead fled the ship in a Blue Midget when it became clear Lister 's complete lack of self @-@ respect and indulgence on excesses was slowly killing him , which greatly depressed her . Lister is advised by fans of the television series to find her in " the next series " and to make amends . ( The character does not , however , ultimately appear in the 10th series . ) 
 = = Production = = 
 The first series aired on BBC2 in 1988 . Ten further series have so far been produced , and a film has been in development almost continually since before series VIII in 1999 . 
 = = = Concept and commission = = = 
 The concept for the show was originally developed from the sketch @-@ series Dave Hollins : Space Cadet on the BBC Radio 4 show Son of Cliché in the mid @-@ 1980s , written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor . Their influences came from films and television programmes such as Silent Running ( 1972 ) , Alien ( 1979 ) , Dark Star ( 1974 ) and The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy ( 1981 ) , but also had a large element of British @-@ style comedy and satire thrown into the mix , ultimately moulded into the form of a sitcom . Many visual and character elements bear similarities to the Trident nuclear submarine BBC documentary " Defence of the Realm " . Having first written the pilot script in 1983 , the former Spitting Image writers had hawked their unusual and original script around but it was rejected by everyone at the BBC , as it was believed a science fiction sitcom would not be popular . 
 It was finally accepted by BBC North in 1986 , a result of a spare budget being assigned for a second series of Happy Families that would never arise , and producer Paul Jackson 's insistence that Red Dwarf should be filmed instead . The show was lucky to be remounted after an electricians ' strike partway through rehearsals in early 1987 shut the entire production down ( the title sequence was filmed in January 1987 ) . The filming was rescheduled for September , and the pilot episode finally made it onto television screens on 15 February 1988 . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Alan Rickman and Alfred Molina auditioned for roles in the series , with Molina being cast as Rimmer . However , after Molina had difficulties with the concept of the series , and of his role in particular , the role was recast and filled by Chris Barrie , a professional voice @-@ actor and impressionist who had previously worked with both the writers on Spitting Image , and with the producers on Happy Families and Jasper <unk> productions . Craig Charles , a Liverpudlian " punk poet " , was given the role of Dave Lister . He was approached by the production team for his opinion about the " Cat " character , as they were concerned it may be considered by people as racist . Charles described " Cat " as ' pretty cool ' and after reading the script he decided he wanted to audition for the part of Dave Lister . Laconic stand up comedian Norman Lovett , who had originally tried out for the role of Rimmer , was kept in the show as Holly , the senile computer of the titular ship . A professional dancer and singer , Danny John @-@ Jules , arriving half an hour late for his appointment , stood out as the Cat immediately . This was partly due to his " cool " exterior , dedicated research ( reading Desmond Morris ' book <unk> ) , and his showing up in character , wearing his father 's 1950s @-@ style zoot suit . 
 = = = Writing , producing , and directing = = = 
 Grant and Naylor wrote the first six series together ( using the pseudonym Grant Naylor on the first two novels and later as the name of their production company , although never on the episodes themselves ) . Grant left in 1995 , to pursue other projects , leaving Naylor to write series VII and VIII with a group of new writers , including Paul Alexander and actor Robert Llewellyn who portrayed the character Kryten . 
 For the most part , Ed Bye produced and directed the series . He left before series V due to a scheduling clash ( he ended up directing a show starring his wife , Ruby Wax ) so Juliet May took over as director . May parted ways with the show halfway through the series for personal and professional reasons and Grant and Naylor took over direction of the series , in addition to writing and producing . Series VI was directed by Andy de <unk> , and Ed Bye returned to direct series VII and VIII . Series I , II and III were made by Paul Jackson Productions , with subsequent series produced by the writers ' own company Grant Naylor Productions for BBC North . All eight series were broadcast on BBC Two . At the beginning of series IV , production moved from the BBC North 's New Broadcasting House in Manchester to Shepperton . 
 = = = Theme song and music = = = 
 The theme tune and incidental music were written and performed by Howard Goodall , with the distinctive vocals on the closing theme tune by Jenna Russell . The first two series used a relatively sombre instrumental version of the closing theme for the opening titles ; from series III onwards this switched to a more upbeat version . Goodall also wrote music for the show 's various songs , including " Tongue Tied " , with lyrics written by Grant and Naylor . Danny John @-@ Jules ( credited as ' The Cat ' ) re @-@ orchestrated and released " Tongue Tied " in October 1993 ; it reached number 17 on the UK charts . Goodall himself sang " The Rimmer Song " heard during the series VII episode " Blue " , to which Chris Barrie mimed . 
 = = = Remastered = = = 
 In 1998 , on the tenth anniversary of the show 's first airing ( and between the broadcast of series VII and VIII ) , the first three series of Red Dwarf were remastered and released on VHS . The remastering included replacing model shots with computer graphics , cutting certain dialogue and scenes , re @-@ filming Norman Lovett 's Holly footage , creating a consistent set of opening titles , replacing music and creating ambient sound effects with a digital master . The remastered series were released in a 4 @-@ disc DVD boxset " The Bodysnatcher Collection " in 2007 . 
 = = = Hiatus = = = 
 Three years elapsed between series VI and VII , partly due to the dissolving of the Grant and Naylor partnership , but also due to cast and crew working on other projects . When the series eventually returned , it was <unk> and no longer shot in front of a live audience , allowing for greater use of four @-@ walled sets , location shooting and single @-@ camera techniques . When the show returned for its eighth series two years later , it had dropped use of the filmising process and returned to using a live audience . 
 The show received a setback when the BBC rejected proposals for a series IX . Doug Naylor confirmed that the BBC decided not to renew the series as they preferred to work on other projects . A short animated Christmas special was , however , made available to mobile phone subscribers . Ultimately , however , fans had to wait a decade before the series returned to television . 
 = = = Revival = = = 
 = = = = Red Dwarf : Back to Earth = = = = 
 In 2008 , a three @-@ episode production was commissioned by the digital channel Dave . Red Dwarf : Back to Earth was broadcast over the Easter weekend of 2009 , along with a " making of " documentary . The episode was set nine years after the events of " Only the Good ... " ( with the cliffhanger ending of that episode left unresolved , a situation that would continue with Series X ) . The storyline involves the characters arriving back on Earth , circa 2009 , only to find that they are characters in a TV show called " Red Dwarf " . Kochanski is supposedly dead and Holly is offline due to water damage caused by Lister leaving a tap running . Actress Sophie Winkleman played a character called Katerina , a resurrected hologram of a Red Dwarf science officer intent on replacing Rimmer . 
 To achieve a more cinematic atmosphere , Back to Earth was not filmed in front of a studio audience . Some previous Red Dwarf episodes had been shot in that way ( " <unk> " and all of the seventh series ) , but Back to Earth represented the first time that a laughter track was not added before broadcast . It was also the first episode of Red Dwarf to be filmed in high definition . 
 The specials were televised over three nights starting on Friday , 10 April 2009 . The broadcasts received record ratings for Freeview channel Dave ; the first of the three episodes represented the UK 's highest ever viewing figures for a commissioned programme on a digital network . Back to Earth was released on DVD on 15 June 2009 , and on Blu @-@ ray on 31 August 2009 . Back to Earth was subsequently described on the series ' official website as " for all intents and purposes , the ' ninth series ' of Red Dwarf " . Its placement as Series IX was confirmed when Series X was commissioned and branded as the tenth series . 
 = = = = Red Dwarf X = = = = 
 On 10 April 2011 Dave announced it had commissioned a six @-@ episode Red Dwarf " Series X " to be broadcast on Dave in autumn 2012 . Filming dates for the new series Red Dwarf X were announced on 11 November 2011 , along with confirmation that the series would be shot at Shepperton Studios in front of an audience . Principal filming began on 16 December 2011 and ended on 27 January 2012 , and the cast and crew subsequently returned for six days filming pick ups . Discounting guest stars , only the core cast of Charles , Barrie , Llewellyn and John @-@ Jules returned for Series X , with Annett and Lovett absent , though the scripts include references to Kochanski and Holly . 
 On 20 July 2012 , a 55 @-@ second trailer for series X was released on Facebook , followed by a new teaser every Friday . The new series debuted on Thursday 4 October 2012 . 
 Since series X aired , which produced high ratings , Dave , Doug Naylor and the cast have shown a strong interest in doing another series with Naylor already starting on scripts , but this is dependent on UKTV commissioning the series . During the Dimension Jump fan convention in May 2013 , Doug Naylor stated that discussions were happening with all involved parties but arrangements had not been finalized , but he hoped shooting could begin in February 2014 . In October 2013 , Doug Naylor played down reports of a new series being commissioned ; but in January 2014 Danny John @-@ Jules stated that the eleventh series of Red Dwarf was currently being written . 
 = = = = Red Dwarf XI and XII = = = = 
 In October 2013 , Robert Llewellyn posted on his blog , stating that " an eleventh series would happen " and that it would be " sometime in 2014 " . Llewellyn removed the post from his blog and Doug Naylor issued a statement on Twitter , saying : " Getting tweets claiming Red Dwarf XI is commissioned . Not true . Not yet . " 
 At the April 2014 Sci @-@ Fi Scarborough Festival , during the Red Dwarf cast panel , Danny John @-@ Jules stated that filming of the eleventh series would commence in October 2014 , with an expected release of Autumn 2015 on Dave . 
 On 2 May 2015 , at the Dimension Jump XVIII convention , Naylor announced that an eleventh and a twelfth series had been commissioned . The two series will be shot back @-@ to @-@ back towards the end of 2015 for broadcast on Dave in 2016 and 2017 respectively . The new series will be co @-@ produced by Baby Cow Productions , with company CEO , Henry Normal , executive producing the new episodes . 
 In the 2015 Christmas message , the official Red Dwarf website confirmed that six episodes ( Red Dwarf XI ) had been filmed and the remaining six ( Red Dwarf XII ) would be filmed between January and March 2016 . The message also said that no broadcast date had been set , although the corresponding Facebook post stated that Red Dwarf XI would be shown sometime in 2016 . On 24 June 2016 , along with a brief synopsis of the upcoming season , it was confirmed that Series XI would air in September 2016 . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Red Dwarf was founded on the standard sitcom focus of a disparate and frequently dysfunctional group of individuals living together in a restricted setting . With the main characters routinely displaying their cowardice , incompetence and laziness , while exchanging insulting and sarcastic dialogue , the series provided a humorous antidote to the fearless and morally upright space explorers typically found in science @-@ fiction series , with its main characters acting bravely only when there was no other possible alternative . The increasing science @-@ fiction elements of the series were treated seriously by creators Rob Grant and Doug Naylor . Satire , parody and drama were alternately woven into the episodes , referencing other television series , films and books . These have included references to the likes of 2001 : A Space Odyssey ( 1968 ) , Top Gun ( 1986 ) , RoboCop ( 1987 ) , Star Wars ( 1977 ) , Citizen Kane ( 1942 ) , The Wild One ( 1953 ) , High Noon ( 1952 ) , Rebel Without a Cause ( 1955 ) , Easy Rider ( 1969 ) , The Terminator ( 1984 ) and Pride and Prejudice ( 1813 ) . 
 The writers based the whole theme of some episodes on the plots of feature films . The series III episode " Polymorph " references and parodies key moments from Alien ( 1979 ) ; from series IV , " Camille " echoes key scenes from Casablanca ( 1942 ) , while " Meltdown " borrows the main plot from Westworld ( 1973 ) . For series IX , " Back to Earth " was partially inspired by Blade Runner ( 1982 ) . The series ' themes are not limited to films or television , having also incorporated historical events and figures . Religion also plays a part in the series , as a significant factor in the ultimate fate of the Cat race , and the perception of Lister as their ' God ' , both within the episode " Waiting for God " ( whose title makes a literary reference to the Samuel Beckett play Waiting for Godot ) , as well as the crew meeting a man they believe to be Jesus Christ in series X episode " Lemons " . The series VII episode titled " Ouroboros " derives its name and theme from the ancient mythological snake by the same name . 
 The series explores many science @-@ fiction staples such as time @-@ travel paradoxes ( including the grandfather paradox ) , the question of determinism and free will ( on several episodes ) , the pursuit of happiness in virtual reality and , crucially to the show 's premise of Lister being the last human , the near @-@ certainty of the human species ' extinction some time in the far future . 
 Aliens do not feature in the series , as Grant and Naylor decided very early in the process that they did not want aliens involved . This is usually addressed with Rimmer 's belief in extraterrestrial life being shot down , such as a vessel he believes to be an alien ship turning out to be a garbage pod . However , there are non @-@ human life forms such as evolutions of Earth species ( e.g. the Cat race ) , robotic or holo @-@ life forms created by humans , and a kind of ' Genetically Engineered Life Form ' ( GELF ) , an artificially @-@ created creature . Simulants and <unk> frequently serve as antagonists among the later series of the show . 
 = = Hallmarks = = 
 The series developed its own distinct vocabulary . Words and phrases such as <unk> [ sic ] , <unk> , Felis sapiens , Simulants , GELF , space weevil and Zero Gee Football appear throughout the series , highlighting a development in language , political climate , technology , evolution and culture in the future . The creators also employed a vocabulary of fictional expletives in order to avoid using potentially offensive words in the show , and to give nuance to futuristic colloquial language ; in particular " <unk> " ( and variants such as " <unk> " , " <unk> " , and " <unk> @-@ head " ) features prominently , alongside the terms " <unk> " and " goit " .

 The changes that were made to the series ' cast , setting , creative teams and even production values from series to series have meant that opinions differ greatly between fans and critics alike as to the quality of certain series . In the " Great Red Dwarf Debate " , published in volume 2 issue 3 of the Red Dwarf <unk> , science @-@ fiction writers Steve Lyons and Joe Nazzaro both argued on the pros and cons of the early series against the later series . Lyons stated that what the show " once had was a unique balance of sci @-@ fi comedy , which worked magnificently . " <unk> agreed that " the first two series are very original and very funny " , but went on to say that " it wasn 't until series III that the show hit its stride . " Series VI is regarded as a continuation of the " Monster of the week " philosophy of series V , which was nevertheless considered to be visually impressive . Discussions revolve around the quality of series VI , seen by viewers as just as good as the earlier series ' , but has been criticised as a descent into formulaic comedy with an unwelcome change of setting . 
 The changes seen in series VII were seen by some as a disappointment ; while much slicker and higher @-@ budget in appearance , the shift away from outright sitcom and into something approaching comedy drama was seen as a move in the wrong direction . Furthermore , the attempt to shift back into traditional sitcom format for series VIII was greeted with a response that was similarly lukewarm . There was criticism aimed at the decision to resurrect the entire crew of Red Dwarf , as it was felt this detracted from the series ' central premise of Lister being the last human being alive . There are other critics who feel that series VII and VIII are no weaker than the earlier series , however , and the topic is the subject of constant fervent debate among the show 's fanbase .
