 The commercial and critical success of Devil Summoner prompted the development of a second game in the subseries . Titled Devil Summoner : Soul Hackers , it was released for the Saturn in November 1997 , and served as an indirect sequel . Two prequels for the PlayStation 2 were released , focusing on the adventures of Raidou Kuzunoha in 1920s Japan : Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army and Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon . The third Devil Summoner was the first to be released outside Japan . 
 A live @-@ action TV series adaptation of the first game , titled Shin Megami Tensei : Devil Summoner , was produced and aired in Japan . Originally only scheduled for one thirteen episode season in 1997 , popular demand prompted the production of a second season , which broadcast in 1998 . The first series follows the plot of Devil Summoner , while the second season follows an original story . For their VHS release , the subtitle Bright Demon Advent was added . 
 = Leipzig @-@ class cruiser = 
 The Leipzig class was a class of two light cruisers of the German Reichsmarine and later Kriegsmarine ; the class comprised Leipzig , the lead ship , and Nürnberg , which was built to a slightly modified design . The ships were improvements over the preceding Königsberg @-@ class cruisers , being slightly larger , with a more efficient arrangement of the main battery and improved armor protection . Leipzig was built between 1928 and 1931 , and Nürnberg followed between 1934 and 1935 . 
 Both ships participated in the non @-@ intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and 1937 . After the outbreak of World War II , they were used in a variety of roles , including as minelayers and escort vessels . On 13 December 1939 , both ships were torpedoed by the British submarine HMS Salmon . They were thereafter used in secondary roles , primarily as training ships , for most of the rest of the war . Leipzig provided some gunfire support to German Army troops fighting on the Eastern Front . 
 Both ships survived the war , though Leipzig was in very poor condition following an accidental collision with the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen late in the war . Leipzig was therefore used as a barracks ship before being scuttled in 1946 . Nürnberg , however , emerged from the war largely unscathed , and as a result , was seized by the Soviet Navy as war reparations , and commissioned into the Soviet fleet as Admiral Makarov ; she continued in Soviet service until the late 1950s , and was broken up for scrap by 1960 . 
 = = Design = = 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 The two ships of the Leipzig class were not identical , prompting some naval historians to classify them as separate designs , rather than as a ship class . Of the two , Nürnberg was larger . Leipzig was 165 @.@ 8 meters ( 544 ft ) long at the waterline and 177 m ( 581 ft ) long overall . She had a beam of 16 @.@ 3 m ( 53 ft ) and a maximum draft of 5 @.@ 69 m ( 18 @.@ 7 ft ) forward . She displaced 6 @,@ 820 metric tons ( 6 @,@ 710 long tons ; 7 @,@ 520 short tons ) as designed and 8 @,@ 100 metric tons ( 8 @,@ 000 long tons ; 8 @,@ 900 short tons ) at full combat load . Nürnberg was slightly longer , at 170 m ( 560 ft ) at the waterline and 181 @.@ 3 m ( 595 ft ) overall . Her beam was identical to Leipzig , but her draft was slightly greater , at 5 @.@ 74 m ( 18 @.@ 8 ft ) forward . She displaced 8 @,@ 060 metric tons ( 7 @,@ 930 long tons ; 8 @,@ 880 short tons ) as designed and 9 @,@ 040 metric tons ( 8 @,@ 900 long tons ; 9 @,@ 960 short tons ) at full combat load . 
 The ships ' hulls were divided into fourteen watertight compartments and had double bottoms that ran for 83 percent of the length of their keels . Both vessels had side bulges and bulbous bows . They were constructed with longitudinal steel frames , and were more than 90 percent welded in order to save weight . Nürnberg had a large , blocky forward superstructure , while Leipzig 's superstructure resembled that of the preceding Königsberg class . Nürnberg also had a large searchlight platform fitted on the funnel , while Leipzig did not . 
 Leipzig initially had a crew of 26 officers and 508 enlisted men . Later in her career , the crew grew to 30 officers and 628 sailors and then again to 24 officers and 826 sailors . She could also accommodate an admiral 's staff of 6 officers and 20 enlisted men when she was serving as a flagship . Nürnberg 's crew started as 25 officers and 648 ratings , and over the course of her career swelled to 26 officers and 870 enlisted men . The ships carried two picket boats , two barges , two launches , and two cutters . 
 Both ships carried one aircraft catapult for a pair of Heinkel He 60 biplane reconnaissance float planes . They were equipped with a crane to retrieve the aircraft after landing . The He 60s were later replaced by the monoplane Arado Ar 196 by 1939 . Leipzig 's catapult was located between the funnel and the forward superstructure , while Nürnberg 's was placed aft of the funnel . 
 = = = Machinery and handling = = = 
 The ships ' propulsion system consisted of two steam turbines manufactured by the Deutsche Werke and Germaniawerft shipyards , along with four 7 @-@ cylinder double @-@ acting two @-@ stroke diesel engines built by MAN . Steam for the turbines was provided by six Marine @-@ type double @-@ ended oil @-@ fired boilers . The engines were rated at 60 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 45 @,@ 000 kW ) for the turbines plus 12 @,@ 400 shp ( 9 @,@ 200 kW ) for the central diesel engines . The ship 's propulsion system provided a top speed of 32 kn ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) and a range of approximately 3 @,@ 900 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 200 km ; 4 @,@ 500 mi ) at 10 kn ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) using only the diesel engines . With only the turbines in operation , the ships could steam for 2 @,@ 800 nmi ( 5 @,@ 200 km ; 3 @,@ 200 mi ) at a speed of 16 @.@ 5 kn ( 30 @.@ 6 km / h ; 19 @.@ 0 mph ) . 
 The ships had extensive electrical generator systems . Leipzig had three power plants that each had a 180 kilowatt turbo @-@ generator and a 180 kW diesel generator ; this gave the ship a combined output of 1 @,@ 080 kW at 220 volts . Nürnberg had four generators which comprised two 300 kW turbo @-@ generators and two 350 kW diesel generators , for a total output of 1 @,@ 300 kW , also at 220 volts . 
 Steering was controlled by a single balanced rudder , which gave the ships excellent maneuverability . The rudder was augmented with special steering system on the engine transmissions ; they had gears that could drive half of the engines astern and half forward allowed the screws to assist in turning the ship at sharper angles . The ships tended toward lee helm in general conditions , but in heavy wind , they suffered from weather helm . Both vessels also suffered from severe leeway at low speeds , and the effect was especially pronounced for Nürnberg , owing to her larger superstructure . 
 = = = Armament and armor = = = 
 Leipzig and Nürnberg were armed with nine 15 cm SK C / 25 guns mounted in three triple gun turrets . One was located forward , and two were placed in a superfiring pair aft , all on the centerline . They were supplied with between 1 @,@ 080 and 1 @,@ 500 rounds of ammunition , for between 120 and 166 shells per gun . As built , Leipzig was also equipped with two 8 @.@ 8 cm SK L / 45 anti @-@ aircraft guns in single mounts ; they had 800 rounds of ammunition . Nürnberg meanwhile was built with eight of these weapons with 3 @,@ 200 rounds in total . Nürnberg also carried eight 3 @.@ 7 cm SK C / 30 anti @-@ aircraft guns , and several 2 cm anti @-@ aircraft guns , though the number of the latter changed over her career . The two ships also carried four triple torpedo tube mounts located amidships ; Leipzig had 50 cm ( 20 in ) weapons while Nürnberg was equipped with 53 @.@ 3 cm ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedoes . They were supplied with twenty @-@ four torpedoes . They were also capable of carrying 120 naval mines . 
 Leipzig used Krupp cemented armor , while Nürnberg received the newly developed Wotan Hart steel . The ships were protected by an armored deck that was 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick amidships and an armored belt that was 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick . The belt was inclined to a greater degree than in the preceding <unk> , to increase the effectiveness of the same thickness of armor plate . The sloping armor that connected the deck with the belt was 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) thick . The conning tower had 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides with a 50 mm thick roof . The gun turrets had 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick faces , 35 mm ( 1 @.@ 4 in ) thick sides , and 32 mm ( 1 @.@ 3 in ) thick roofs . They were mounted on barbettes that were protected with 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) of steel plating . 
 = = = Modifications = = = 
 After the outbreak of war , both ships were fitted with a degaussing coil to protect them against magnetic mines . Leipzig had her aircraft equipment removed in 1941 , along with her after torpedo tubes . In 1942 , Nürnberg 's aircraft handling equipment and aft torpedo tubes were also removed . Throughout the war , the ships ' radar suites were upgraded ; in March 1941 , Nürnberg was equipped with FuMO 21 radar and in early 1942 , a FuMO 25 radar set was installed . The latter was a search radar for surface targets and low @-@ flying aircraft at low range . The FuMO 21 set was replaced by the short @-@ range FuMO 63 Hohentwiel 50 @-@ centimeter radar . Nürnberg was also fitted with four Metox radar warning receivers . Leipzig did not receive her FuMO 24 / 25 radar set until 1943 ; this was to be the last modification for Leipzig . 
 Leipzig had her anti @-@ aircraft armament modernized to bring her closer to the standard of weaponry fitted to her sister . After 1934 , two additional 8 @.@ 8 cm guns were added , with another pair later . Starting in 1941 , eight 3 @.@ 7 cm guns were installed , along with fourteen 2 cm guns . After 1944 , she only carried eight of the 2 cm guns . Nürnberg 's anti @-@ aircraft battery was improved over the course of World War II . In late 1942 , a pair of Army @-@ variant 2 cm Flakvierling quadruple mounts were installed , one on the navigating bridge and the other on top of the aft superfiring turret . In May 1944 , the navy proposed installing several Bofors 40 mm guns , but most of these weapons were diverted to other uses , and only two guns were installed . One was mounted on the bridge and the other where the catapult had been located . Two Navy @-@ pattern Flakvierlings were added ; one replaced the Army model atop the aft superfiring turret , and the other was placed in front of the anti @-@ aircraft fire director . The Army @-@ pattern Flakvierlings were moved to the main deck . In December 1944 , another revised anti @-@ aircraft plan was proposed , this time incorporating the new 3 @.@ 7 cm FlaK 43 gun , of which there were to be eight , along with two Flakvierlings and ten 2 cm twin mounts . Germany 's wartime situation by the end of 1944 prevented these changes from being made , however .

 In the 1930s , Leipzig was used as a training cruiser , as well as to make goodwill visits to foreign ports . She participated in non @-@ intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War . In the first year of World War II , she performed escort duties for warships in the Baltic and North seas . Leipzig was torpedoed by the British submarine HMS Salmon on 13 December 1939 while on one of these operations . The cruiser was badly damaged , and the necessary repairs took almost a year to complete . She thereafter resumed her duties as a training ship . She provided gunfire support to the advancing Wehrmacht troops as they invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 . 
 In a heavy fog in October 1944 , Leipzig collided with the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen ; the damage was so severe that the navy decided complete repairs were unfeasible . Instead , they repaired Leipzig enough to keep her afloat , and in that state , provided gunfire support to the defenders of Gotenhafen against the advancing Red Army in March 1945 . As the Germans continued to retreat in the east , Leipzig was then used to transport a group of fleeing German civilians . She reached Denmark by late April . After the end of the war , Leipzig was used as a barracks ship for minesweeping forces and was scuttled in July 1946 .

 Following her commissioning , Nürnberg participated in the non @-@ intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War ; she completed her patrols without major incident and returned to Germany in mid @-@ 1937 . After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 , she was used to lay defensive minefields off the German coast in the North Sea . She was thereafter used to escort offensive mine @-@ layers in the North Sea until she was torpedoed by the British submarine Salmon on 13 December 1939 . After repairs were completed in early 1940 , Nürnberg returned to active duty as a training ship in the Baltic Sea . She performed this role for most of the rest of the war , apart from a short deployment to Norway from November 1942 to April 1943 . In January 1945 , she was assigned to mine @-@ laying duties in the Skaggerak , but severe shortages of fuel permitted only one such operation . 
 After the end of the war , Nürnberg was seized by the Royal Navy and ultimately awarded to the Soviet Union as war reparations . In December 1945 , a Soviet crew took over the ship , and the following month took her to Tallinn , where she was renamed Admiral Makarov . She served in the Soviet Navy , first in the 8th Fleet , then as a training cruiser based in Kronstadt . Her ultimate fate is unclear , but by 1960 , she had been broken up for scrap . Nürnberg was the second @-@ largest warship of the Kriegsmarine to survive the war intact , after the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen , and she was the only vessel to see service after the war , albeit in a foreign navy .

 The 1961 American romantic comedy film Come September , featuring Rock Hudson and Gina Lollobrigida , and directed by Robert Mulligan , was a worldwide box office success , especially in Chennai . The film narrated the tale of Robert ( Hudson ) , an American millionaire , who arrives at his villa for his vacation . His girlfriend , Lisa ( Lollobrigida ) , has given up waiting for him and has decided to marry another man . Robert 's villa manager , Maurice ( Walter Slezak ) , converts the villa into a hotel while Robert is away . The villa is now occupied by a group of young American girls trying to fend off a gang of boys , led by Tony ( Bobby Darin ) . A. C. Tirulokchandar , who was then a screenwriter for AVM Productions , adapted the screenplay of Come September for his film Anbe Vaa . According to The New Indian Express , it was AVM Productions ' 50th film . 
 Tirulokchandar was introduced to AVM Productions by S. A. Ashokan , who he had worked with previously as an assistant director on <unk> Veeran ( 1960 ) . It was Ashokan who helped Tirulokchandar cast M. G. Ramachandran in the film . <unk> Das wrote the film 's dialogues . Director S. P. Muthuraman worked as an assistant director on the film . S. Maruthi Rao , R. G. <unk> and A. K. Shekar were in charge of the cinematography , editing , and art direction , respectively . A. K. Chopra was in charge of the film 's choreography , and Raghuram , who later went on to become a successful choreographer in Indian cinema , worked as an assistant choreographer to him . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Anbe Vaa marked the first time where AVM Productions wrote a script to suit an actor 's image and acting style ; prior to this they had chosen actors to fit an already completed script . AVM Productions ' founder A. V. Meiyappan 's son M. Saravanan , one of the film 's producers , recalled in 2013 that it as a fan of M. G. Ramachandran , it was his wish to see him act under the AVM banner . For several days he hesitated to tell his father about this choice , but when he did , he showed support . While Tirulokchandar was writing the script , Meiyappan made the suggestion to approach Ramachandran for the lead role . Tirulokchandar found this intriguing , as the script 's genre was dissimilar to what Ramachandran was noted for : action @-@ adventure or social and family dramas which portrayed him as a champion for the downtrodden . 
 When approached by Saravanan , Ramachandran showed enthusiasm about working with AVM Productions . He told Saravanan that the film should be " a different picture – a typical director 's picture " , and he would act in it . Ramachandran gave a call sheet of seventy two days for participating in the film . Saravanan states in his 2005 book AVM 60 Cinema that ₹ 3 @,@ 00 @,@ 000 was arranged as the pay for Ramachandran , but the latter demanded an additional 25 @,@ 000 ; his final pay was ₹ 3 @,@ 25 @,@ 000 . The Economic Times stated in 2010 that Ramachandran was paid 10 % of the film 's ₹ 3 million budget . Anbe Vaa remained his only collaboration with both Tirulokchandar and AVM Productions . Ramachandran , who later became the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu , also became the fourth Chief Minister of an Indian state to work with AVM Productions . 
 Ramachandran initially recommended K. A. Thangavelu for the role of Punyakodi , but Saravanan said that his father wanted T. R. Ramachandran in the role . M. G. Ramachandran accepted the decision and told Saravanan not to tell T. R. Ramachandran about his initial choice . M. G. Ramachandran also recommended Jayalalithaa for the role of Geetha , but it eventually went to B. Saroja Devi . She was paid ₹ 90 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to ₹ 3 @.@ 8 million or US $ 56 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) for acting in the film . Ashokan was cast as Geetha 's relative Sekar , P. D. Sambandam was cast as the caretaker , Nagesh was cast as the caretaker ’ s brother @-@ in @-@ law Ramaiah , and Manorama was cast as Kannamma , the caretaker 's daughter . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Anbe Vaa was the first colour film of AVM Productions , being made in Eastmancolor . Principal photography for the film began with a puja ceremony held on 12 August 1965 . Ramachandran received special permission to go by car to shoot the film in exotic locations in Shimla ; a privilege allowed only to the governor of the state . Under the auspices of that permission , the entire unit went to Shimla . The song " Pudhiya Vaanam " was shot in the small hill station of <unk> , located 13 kilometres from Shimla , as well as at Mall Road , Shimla . Portions of the film were also shot at a 200 @-@ year old bungalow covering 15 acres in <unk> . 
 Savi , an editor who worked for the Tamil magazine , Ananda Vikatan , accompanied the production unit and published an article on the making of the film . Although the story is set in Shimla , most of the film was shot in Ooty . Shooting in Shimla took place for only five days . " Naan <unk> " was one of the few songs in the film that was shot outdoors , due to Ramachandran not wanting to attract attention from his large fan following . During shooting in Ooty , Ramachandran personally bought sweaters for the entire cast and crew . The Government Botanical Gardens in Ooty were also used as a shooting location . 
 The production unit , composed of 20 crew members , along with Tirulokchandar , M. G. Ramachandran , Saroja Devi and Savi , initially flew to Delhi . From Delhi , they travelled to Kalka by train , then continued on to Shimla , using three first @-@ generation Chevrolet Impalas . The skating scenes in the film , involving Ramachandran and Saroja Devi , were completed in two days . Both Ramachandran and Saroja Devi were initially hesitant to perform the scene , but went through with it after they received encouragement from the local population . For some scenes in the film , Saroja Devi was made to walk with mincing steps and flutter her eyelashes . She and Ramachandran also performed a twist in the film . For the climactic action sequence in which JB fights a wrestler , <unk> requested Ramachandran to lift the wrestler overhead and hold him in the air for some time before trampling him , and Ramachandran obliged . The final length of the film was 4 @,@ 854 @.@ 70 metres ( 15 @,@ 927 @.@ 5 ft ) .

 Folklorist and writer M. D. <unk> , writing for The Times of India , compared M. G. Ramachandran 's character in Anbe Vaa to the sage Vishvamitra , describing the former as " the archetypal male figure who resists the advances of the beautiful damsels " , similar to Vishvamitra resisting the temptations of the Apsara Menaka . According to Sri Lankan historian and author Sachi Sri Kantha , the song " Pudhiya Vaanam " had " delicately introduced " the symbol for the political party Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam through the lyrics , " Udaya <unk> <unk> – <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " ( " While rising sun shines , the world will become aware , the cool wind from Himalaya will touch the heart " ) in that pre @-@ election year . Although the film is based on Come September , The Times of India stated that it was " structured as a Roman Holiday with a man as the protagonist " . 
 = = Music = = 
 Released under the Saregama label , the film 's soundtrack and score were composed by M. S. Viswanathan , while the lyrics were written by Vaali . Kalyan Subrahmanyam , an anaesthetist and alumnus of Madras Medical College and Stanley Medical College , made his musical debut with this film , singing as part of the <unk> Sampath , a sound engineer who joined AVM Productions in in the mid @-@ 1950s , created the " chick <unk> " ( also spelt " <unk> <unk> " ) sound effect for the title track . " Pudhiya Vaanam " originally had the lyrics " Udaya <unk> <unk> " , but on Meiyappan 's request , Vaali changed the first word in the line to " Puthiya " . The sound effect of the horses ' footfall in " Rajavin Paarvai " was created by <unk> Murugesan . 
 The soundtrack received positive critical reception , and all the songs were successful , especially " Rajavin Parvai " , and " Pudhiya Vaanam " . Film historian Randor Guy of The Hindu called the songs " melodious " , describing the soundtrack as one of the film 's major positives . He said " Pudhiya Vaanam " had " a political touch " , and was " brilliantly photographed by master lens man S. Maruthi Rao . " Karan Bali , writing for <unk> , said , " MS Viswanathan ’ s musical score deserves a special mention . The music is easily one of the highlights of Anbe Vaa . " Music director Ramesh <unk> , writing for The Hindu , commented on Viswanathan : " Setting prose and poetry to tune in ‘ Andha Naal <unk> , ’ ‘ <unk> ’ laughter ( <unk> <unk> ) , and ‘ painting ’ the sky and the earth along with falling rain in ‘ Pudhiya Vaanam ’ are true works of a genius . " 
 Gopal <unk> , writing for Asian Tribune , noted that " Pudhiya Vaanam " was one of several songs written by Vaali for <unk> that " helped the latter galvanize masses " . Uma S. Maheshwari of The Hindu included " Pudhiya Vaanam " in her list of the " Immortal songs of TMS " , and also among lyricist Vaali 's best songs in their collection , " Best of Vaali : From 1964 - 2013 " . " Rajavin Parvai " was performed live by French actor and singer Pascal <unk> ( popularly known as Pascal of Bollywood ) during his visit to India in 2003 . It was also included on MGR Special , a compilation album of songs from films starring Ramachandran , that was released in January 2016 . " Naan <unk> " was performed live by the Chennai @-@ based music group Square Band at the concert " Isai Kaveri " hosted by the Bharathidasan Institute of Management in August 2012 .

 Anbe Vaa was released on 14 January 1966 , during the festive occasion of Thai Pongal . When AVM first discussed with Ramachandran about making the film a Pongal release , he objected as another film of his , Naan <unk> , produced by his then manager R. M. <unk> , was already set for releasing at that time . Ramachandran , however , negotiated a deal with AVM by postponing the release of Naan <unk> , and in the January 1966 slot to release Anbe Vaa . It was Ramachandran 's first of nine films released in that year . The film had a theatrical run of 23 weeks and was a box office success , grossing ₹ 6 million ( equivalent to ₹ 250 million or US $ 3 @.@ 8 million in 2016 ) against a budget of ₹ 3 million according to a 2015 estimate by Dinamalar . It was also dubbed into Telugu as Prema Manasulu . 
 In November 2008 , Anbe Vaa was screened at the 39th International Film Festival of India under the segment " Lifetime Classics " . On 18 April 2010 , it was screened at the South Indian Film Chamber Theatre for the Dignity Film Festival held in Chennai ; other films also screened included Madhumati ( 1958 ) , Kadhalikka Neramillai ( 1964 ) , Server Sundaram ( 1964 ) and Thillana Mohanambal ( 1968 ) . 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 On 6 August 1966 , the review in Ananda Vikatan described Anbe Vaa as an English film in Tamil , and felt that though it did not have any story , one could spend three hours in an entertaining manner with the film . Randor Guy , in his review , wrote , " The screenplay was brilliantly written by ACT . MGR 's performance as the rich man posing as a tenant was impressive . Nagesh was inimitable . Saroja Devi looked glamorous in her glossy make @-@ up and costume . " He went on to conclude that the film would be " Remembered for the impressive performances by MGR , Nagesh and Saroja Devi , melodious music , interesting storyline and screenplay , picturesque cinematography which captured the beautiful landscape of the Himalayan region , and the fabulous sets in true AVM style . " 
 Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff called Saroja Devi , " a style icon " , and rated this as " her best " performance , comparing it with her role in <unk> <unk> Pillai ( 1965 ) . Sify called Nagesh 's on @-@ screen chemistry with M. G. Ramachandran in the film " fantastic " , further elaborating that , " In this film the MGR @-@ Nagesh scenes according to a veteran distributor brought repeat audiences to the theatres . He played the hero 's sidekick and was simply terrific . " They also praised Anbe Vaa for being " one of the rare films of MGR with minimum action scenes and punch dialogues " . In July 2008 , The Times of India said , " If ever one comes out with a list of highly entertaining Tamil movies , this one will top the list " , and gave the film a rating of three stars out of five . Following <unk> 's death in June 2016 , they said , " The director 's gifts of storytelling , intelligent lines , good song positioning , and extracting creditable performances were at play " with this film . Karan Bali stated in 2016 , " The comedy [ ... ] is enjoyably light @-@ hearted fluff and sees MGR ably carry the film through in the role of the Westernised , wealthy urbane romantic hero . The role is different from the MGR prototype – the poor , mother @-@ loving crusading Tamil hero who fights for the oppressed and tames the rich heroine while all along propagating the DMK ’ s ideology and concerns . " Writing for The Hindu , Malathi Rangarajan described it as a " breezy romantic comedy " that had " none of the formulaic ingredients of an MGR film " . Following Manorama 's death in October 2015 , Jayalalithaa – then the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu – described her performance in the film as " superb " .

 According to The Times of India , Anbe Vaa emerged an " uncommon triumph " for M. G. Ramachandran , who had previously acted mainly in " <unk> made cop and robber flicks " . It was one of several films featuring Ramachandran which he used to propagate his ideologies during his election campaigns . Actor and film historian Mohan V. Raman noted that M. G. Ramachandran 's acceptance of the role " that went against the then accepted formula for an MGR film " was a demonstration of the actor 's faith in Tirulokchandar . Likewise , The Times of India noted , " A C <unk> [ ... ] had imbibed the deportment by observing his role model L V Prasad - that film stars looked up to him . So much so that even the usually interfering MGR allowed himself to be moulded under the filmmaker 's baton in the film Anbe Vaa ( 1966 ) . " 
 Anbe Vaa attained cult status in Tamil cinema , and was one of the first South Indian films to be shot in Shimla , inspiring many other films to choose Shimla as a shooting location , notably the Telugu film , Desamuduru ( 2007 ) . Director Mani Ratnam , film producer M. S. Guhan 's daughter Aruna Guhan , choreographer Prabhu Deva and director Sundar C. all ranked Anbe Vaa among their favourite films . The costumes that Ramachandran used in the film , as well as the carriage used for " Rajavin Paarvai " , are preserved at AVM Studios . 
 References to Anbe Vaa are made in various films . The 1988 film Puthiya Vaanam , starring Sivaji Ganesan , was named after the song of the same name . Films like Rajavin <unk> ( 1995 ) , Love Birds ( 1996 ) , and the upcoming Rajavin Paarvai <unk> <unk> were also named after the songs from Anbe Vaa . In Unakkaga Ellam Unakkaga ( 1999 ) , <unk> ( Goundamani ) imagines himself as M. G. Ramachandran in " Pudhiya Vaanam " by dancing with children , the result of which is him being mistaken for a kidnapper by the police . In Kathai <unk> <unk> <unk> ( 2014 ) , Thamizh ( Santhosh <unk> ) is an aspiring filmmaker who reads stories by F. Scott Fitzgerald and <unk> Selvan , but is forced to listen to anecdotes about films such as Anbe Vaa . 
 In Dhool ( 2003 ) , <unk> ( Vikram ) echoes a single line , " Pudhiya Vaanam " , to signal his arrival to his friends . In 2005 , another film called Anbe Vaa , starring actors Thendral , <unk> and Vivek in the lead roles , was released ; its critical response was average . A song with the same title as the film is used in Thotta ( 2008 ) . A clip from the song " Love Birds " is featured in Venkat Prabhu 's Saroja ( 2008 ) . Scenes from the film were interposed in Villu ( 2009 ) . A portion of " Rajavin Paarvai " is used in the song " Vaa Machi " from <unk> Guru ( 2013 ) . 
 In 2002 , a quiz programme called Pudhiya Vaanam Pudhiya <unk> aired on DD National and DD <unk> to help develop tourism in Tamil Nadu . In 2009 , a television series titled Anbe Vaa aired on STAR Vijay every Monday @-@ Thursday at 8 : 00 pm IST .

 Earth ( otherwise known as the world , in Greek : <unk> Gaia , or in Latin : Terra ) is the third planet from the Sun , the densest planet in the Solar System , the largest of the Solar System 's four terrestrial planets , and the only astronomical object known to harbor life . 
 According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence , Earth formed about 4 @.@ 54 billion years ago . Earth gravitationally interacts with other objects in space , especially the Sun and the Moon . During one orbit around the Sun , Earth rotates about its own axis 366 @.@ 26 times , creating 365 @.@ 26 solar days or one sidereal year . Earth 's axis of rotation is tilted 23 @.@ 4 ° away from the perpendicular of its orbital plane , producing seasonal variations on the planet 's surface within a period of one tropical year ( 365 @.@ 24 solar days ) . The Moon , Earth 's only permanent natural satellite , by its gravitational relationship with Earth , causes ocean tides , stabilizes the orientation of Earth 's rotational axis , and gradually slows Earth 's rotational rate . 
 Earth 's lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years . 71 % of Earth 's surface is covered with water . The remaining 29 % is land mass — consisting of continents and islands — that together has many lakes , rivers , and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere . The majority of Earth 's polar regions are covered in ice , including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack . Earth 's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core , a liquid outer core that generates the Earth 's magnetic field , and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics . 
 Within its first billion years , life appeared in Earth 's oceans , and began to affect the atmosphere and surface , leading to the proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic organisms . Since then , the combination of Earth 's distance from the Sun , physical properties , and geological history have allowed life to evolve and today thrive . The earliest undisputed life on Earth arose at least 3 @.@ 5 billion years ago . Earlier physical evidence of life includes biogenic graphite in 3 @.@ 7 billion @-@ year @-@ old metasedimentary rocks discovered in southwestern Greenland , as well as " remains of biotic life " found in 4 @.@ 1 billion @-@ year @-@ old rocks in Western Australia . Except when interrupted by mass extinction events , Earth 's biodiversity has continually expanded . Although scholars estimate that over 99 % of all species of life ( over five billion ) that ever lived on Earth are today extinct , there are an estimated 10 – 14 million species still in existence , of which about 1 @.@ 2 million have been documented and over 86 % have not yet been described . More recently , in May 2016 , scientists reported that 1 trillion species are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one @-@ thousandth of one percent described . In July 2016 , scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the Last Universal Common Ancestor ( LUCA ) of all organisms living on Earth . Over 7 @.@ 3 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and minerals for their survival . Earth 's human population is divided among about 200 sovereign states that interact through diplomacy , conflict , travel , trade , and communication media . 
 = = Name and etymology = = 
 The modern English word Earth developed from a wide variety of Middle English forms , which derived from an Old English noun most often spelled eorðe . It has cognates in every Germanic language , and their proto @-@ Germanic root has been reconstructed as * <unk> . In its earliest appearances , eorðe was already being used to translate the many senses of Latin terra and Greek <unk> ( gē ) : the ground , its soil , dry land , the human world , the surface of the world ( including the sea ) , and the globe itself . As with Terra and Gaia , Earth was a personified goddess in Germanic paganism : the Angles were listed by Tacitus as among the devotees of Nerthus , and later Norse mythology included Jörð , a giantess often given as the mother of Thor . 
 Originally , earth was written in lowercase , and from early Middle English , its definite sense as " the globe " was expressed as the earth . By early Modern English , many nouns were capitalized , and the earth became ( and often remained ) the Earth , particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies . More recently , the name is sometimes simply given as Earth , by analogy with the names of the other planets . House styles now vary : Oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most common , with the capitalized form an acceptable variant . Another convention capitalizes " Earth " when appearing as a name ( e.g. " Earth 's atmosphere " ) but writes it in lowercase when preceded by the ( e.g. " the atmosphere of the earth " ) . It almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as " what on earth are you doing ? " 
 = = Chronology = = 
 = = = Formation = = = 
 The earliest material found in the Solar System is dated to 4 @.@ <unk> ± 0 @.@ 0006 billion years ago ( Gya ) . By 4 @.@ 54 ± 0 @.@ 04 Gya the primordial Earth had formed . The formation and evolution of the Solar System bodies occurred along with those of the Sun . In theory , a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse , which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk , and then the planets grow out of that disk along with the Sun . A nebula contains gas , ice grains , and dust ( including primordial nuclides ) . In nebular theory , planetesimals form by accretion . The assembly of the primordial Earth proceeded for 10 – 20 Ma . 
 The process that led to the formation of the Moon approximately 4 @.@ 53 billion years ago is the subject of ongoing research . The working hypothesis is that it formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars @-@ sized object , named Theia , impacted Earth . In this scenario , the mass of Theia was approximately 10 % of that of Earth , it impacted Earth with a glancing blow , and some of its mass merged with Earth . Between approximately 4 @.@ 1 and 3 @.@ 8 Gya , numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon , and by inference , to that of Earth . 
 = = = Geological history = = = 
 Earth 's atmosphere and oceans formed by volcanic activity and outgassing that included water vapor . The origin of the world 's oceans was condensation augmented by water and ice delivered by asteroids , protoplanets , and comets . In this model , atmospheric " greenhouse gases " kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70 % of its current luminosity . By 3 @.@ 5 Gya , Earth 's magnetic field was established , which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind . 
 A crust formed when the molten outer layer of Earth cooled to form a solid as the accumulated water vapor began to act in the atmosphere . The two models that explain land mass propose either a steady growth to the present @-@ day forms or , more likely , a rapid growth early in Earth history followed by a long @-@ term steady continental area . Continents formed by plate tectonics , a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth 's interior . On time scales lasting hundreds of millions of years , the supercontinents have formed and broken up three times . Roughly 750 mya ( million years ago ) , one of the earliest known supercontinents , Rodinia , began to break apart . The continents later recombined to form <unk> , 600 – 540 mya , then finally Pangaea , which also broke apart 180 mya . 
 The present pattern of ice ages began about 40 mya and then intensified during the Pleistocene about 3 mya . High @-@ latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw , repeating every 40 – 100000 years . The last continental glaciation ended 10 @,@ 000 years ago . 
 = = = Evolution of life = = = 
 Highly energetic chemical reactions are thought to have produced self – replicating molecules around four billion years ago . This was followed a half billion years later by the last common ancestor of all life . The development of photosynthesis allowed the Sun 's energy to be harvested directly by life forms ; the resultant molecular oxygen ( O2 ) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation , formed a protective ozone layer ( O3 ) in the upper atmosphere . The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes . True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized . Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer , life colonized Earth 's surface . The earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3 @.@ 48 billion @-@ year @-@ old sandstone in Western Australia , biogenic graphite found in 3 @.@ 7 billion @-@ year @-@ old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland , as well as , remains of biotic material found in 4 @.@ 1 billion @-@ year @-@ old rocks in Western Australia . 
 Since the 1960s , it has been hypothesized that severe glacial action between 750 and 580 mya , during the Neoproterozoic , covered much of Earth in ice . This hypothesis has been termed " Snowball Earth " , and it is of particular interest because it preceded the Cambrian explosion , when multicellular life forms began to proliferate . Following the Cambrian explosion , about 535 mya , there have been five major mass extinctions . The most recent such event was 66 mya , when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non @-@ avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles , but spared some small animals such as mammals , which then resembled shrews . Over the past 66 Ma , mammalian life has diversified , and several million years ago an African ape @-@ like animal such as Orrorin <unk> gained the ability to stand upright . This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain , which allowed the evolution of the human race . The development of agriculture , and then civilization , led to humans having an influence on Earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms as no other species ever has . 
 = = = Predicted future = = = 
 Estimates on how much longer Earth will be able to continue to support life range from 500 million years ( Myr ) , to as long as 2 @.@ 3 billion years ( Ga ) . Earth 's long @-@ term future is closely tied to that of the Sun . As a result of the steady accumulation of helium at the Sun 's core , the Sun 's total luminosity will slowly increase . The luminosity of the Sun will grow by 10 % over the next 1 @.@ 1 Ga and by 40 % over the next 3 @.@ 5 Ga . Climate models indicate that the rise in radiation reaching Earth is likely to have dire consequences , including the loss of the oceans . 
 Earth 's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic CO2 cycle , reducing its concentration to levels lethally low for plants ( 10 ppm for C4 photosynthesis ) in approximately 500 – 900 Ma . The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere , so animal life will become extinct within several million more years . After another billion years all surface water will have disappeared and the mean global temperature will reach 70 ° C ( 158 ° F ) . Earth is expected to be effectively habitable for about another 500 Ma from that point , although this may be extended up to 2 @.@ 3 Ga if the nitrogen is removed from the atmosphere . Even if the Sun were eternal and stable , 27 % of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle in one billion years , due to reduced steam venting from mid @-@ ocean ridges . 
 The Sun will evolve to become a red giant in about 5 Ga . Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly 1 AU ( 150 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 km ) , which is about 250 times its present radius . Earth 's fate is less clear . As a red giant , the Sun will lose roughly 30 % of its mass , so , without tidal effects , Earth will move to an orbit 1 @.@ 7 AU ( 250 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 km ) from the Sun when it reaches its maximum radius . Earth was , therefore , once expected to escape envelopment by the expanded Sun 's outer atmosphere , though most , if not all , remaining life would have been destroyed by the Sun 's increased luminosity ( peaking at about 5 @,@ 000 times its present level ) . A 2008 simulation indicates that Earth 's orbit will decay due to tidal effects and drag , causing it to enter the red giant Sun 's atmosphere and be vaporized . 
 = = Physical characteristics = = 
 = = = Shape = = = 
 The shape of Earth approximates an oblate spheroid , a sphere flattened along the axis from pole to pole such that there is a bulge around the equator . This bulge results from the rotation of Earth , and causes the diameter at the equator to be 43 kilometres ( 27 mi ) larger than the pole @-@ to @-@ pole diameter . Thus the point on the surface farthest from Earth 's center of mass is the summit of the equatorial Chimborazo volcano in Ecuador . The average diameter of the reference spheroid is about 12 @,@ 742 kilometres ( 7 @,@ 918 mi ) , which is approximately ( 40 @,@ 000 km ) / π , because the meter was originally defined as 1 / 10 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole through Paris , France . 
 Local topography deviates from this idealized spheroid , although on a global scale these deviations are small compared to Earth 's radius : The maximum deviation of only 0 @.@ 17 % is at the Mariana Trench ( 10 @,@ 911 metres ( 35 @,@ 797 ft ) below local sea level ) , whereas Mount Everest ( 8 @,@ 848 metres ( 29 @,@ 029 ft ) above local sea level ) represents a deviation of 0 @.@ 14 % . If Earth were shrunk to the size of a billiard ball , some areas of Earth such as large mountain ranges and oceanic trenches would feel like tiny imperfections , whereas much of the planet , including the Great Plains and the abyssal plains , would feel smoother . 
 = = = Chemical composition = = = 
 Earth 's mass is approximately 5 @.@ 97 × 1024 kg ( 5 @,@ 970 <unk> ) . It is composed mostly of iron ( 32 @.@ 1 % ) , oxygen ( 30 @.@ 1 % ) , silicon ( 15 @.@ 1 % ) , magnesium ( 13 @.@ 9 % ) , sulfur ( 2 @.@ 9 % ) , nickel ( 1 @.@ 8 % ) , calcium ( 1 @.@ 5 % ) , and aluminium ( 1 @.@ 4 % ) , with the remaining 1 @.@ 2 % consisting of trace amounts of other elements . Due to mass segregation , the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron ( 88 @.@ 8 % ) , with smaller amounts of nickel ( 5 @.@ 8 % ) , sulfur ( 4 @.@ 5 % ) , and less than 1 % trace elements . 
 The geochemist F. W. Clarke calculated that a little more than 47 % of Earth 's crust consists of oxygen . The more common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all oxides : chlorine , sulfur and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1 % . The principal oxides are silica , alumina , iron oxides , lime , magnesia , potash and soda . The silica functions principally as an acid , forming silicates , and all the most common minerals of igneous rocks are of this nature . From a computation based on 1 @,@ 672 analyses of all kinds of rocks , Clarke deduced that 99 @.@ 22 % was composed of 11 oxides ( see the table at right ) , with the other constituents occurring in minute quantities . 
 = = = Internal structure = = = 
 Earth 's interior , like that of the other terrestrial planets , is divided into layers by their chemical or physical ( <unk> ) properties , but unlike the other terrestrial planets , it has a distinct outer and inner core . The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust , which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle . The crust is separated from the mantle by the <unk> discontinuity , and the thickness of the crust varies : averaging 6 km ( kilometers ) under the oceans and 30 – 50 km on the continents . The crust and the cold , rigid , top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere , and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are composed . Beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere , a relatively low @-@ viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides . Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at 410 and 660 km below the surface , spanning a transition zone that separates the upper and lower mantle . Beneath the mantle , an extremely low viscosity liquid outer core lies above a solid inner core . The inner core may rotate at a slightly higher angular velocity than the remainder of the planet , advancing by 0 @.@ 1 – 0 @.@ 5 ° per year . The radius of the inner core is about one fifth of that of Earth . 
 = = = Heat = = = 
 Earth 's internal heat comes from a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion ( about 20 % ) and heat produced through radioactive decay ( 80 % ) . The major heat @-@ producing isotopes within Earth are potassium @-@ 40 , uranium @-@ 238 , uranium @-@ 235 , and thorium @-@ 232 . At the center , the temperature may be up to 6 @,@ 000 ° C ( 10 @,@ 830 ° F ) , and the pressure could reach 360 GPa . Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay , scientists postulate that early in Earth 's history , before isotopes with short half @-@ lives had been depleted , Earth 's heat production would have been much higher . This extra heat production , twice present @-@ day at approximately 3 Ga , would have increased temperature gradients with radius , increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics , and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today . 
 The mean heat loss from Earth is 87 mW m − 2 , for a global heat loss of 4 @.@ 42 × 1013 W. A portion of the core 's thermal energy is transported toward the crust by mantle plumes ; a form of convection consisting of upwellings of higher @-@ temperature rock . These plumes can produce hotspots and flood basalts . More of the heat in Earth is lost through plate tectonics , by mantle upwelling associated with mid @-@ ocean ridges . The final major mode of heat loss is through conduction through the lithosphere , the majority of which occurs under the oceans because the crust there is much thinner than that of the continents . 
 = = = Tectonic plates = = = 
 The mechanically rigid outer layer of Earth , the lithosphere , is broken into pieces called tectonic plates . These plates are rigid segments that move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries : convergent boundaries , at which two plates come together , divergent boundaries , at which two plates are pulled apart , and transform boundaries , in which two plates slide past one another laterally . Earthquakes , volcanic activity , mountain @-@ building , and oceanic trench formation can occur along these plate boundaries . The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere , the solid but less @-@ viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates . 
 As the tectonic plates migrate , the ocean floor is subducted under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries . At the same time , the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid @-@ ocean ridges . The combination of these processes continually recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle . Due to this recycling , most of the ocean floor is less than 100 Ma old in age . The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific , and has an estimated age of about 200 Ma . By comparison , the oldest dated continental crust is 4030 Ma . 
 The seven major plates are the Pacific , North American , Eurasian , African , Antarctic , Indo @-@ Australian , and South American . Other notable plates include the Arabian Plate , the Caribbean Plate , the Nazca Plate off the west coast of South America and the Scotia Plate in the southern Atlantic Ocean . The Australian Plate fused with the Indian Plate between 50 and 55 mya . The fastest @-@ moving plates are the oceanic plates , with the Cocos Plate advancing at a rate of 75 mm / year and the Pacific Plate moving 52 – 69 mm / year . At the other extreme , the slowest @-@ moving plate is the Eurasian Plate , progressing at a typical rate of about 21 mm / year . 
 = = = Surface = = = 
 Earth has a total surface area of about 501 million km2 ( 197 million sq mi ) . About 70 @.@ 8 % of the surface is covered by water , with much of the continental shelf below sea level . This equates to 361 @.@ 13 million km2 ( 139 @.@ 43 million sq mi ) . The submerged surface has mountainous features , including a globe @-@ spanning mid @-@ ocean ridge system , as well as undersea volcanoes , oceanic trenches , submarine canyons , oceanic plateaus and abyssal plains . The remaining 29 @.@ 2 % ( 148 @.@ 94 million km2 , or 57 @.@ 51 million sq mi ) not covered by water has terrain that varies greatly from place to place and consists of mountains , deserts , plains , plateaus , and other landforms . 
 Earth 's surface undergoes reshaping over geological time periods due to tectonics and erosion . The surface features built up or deformed through plate tectonics are subject to steady weathering and erosion from precipitation , thermal cycles , and chemical effects . Glaciation , coastal erosion , the build @-@ up of coral reefs , and large meteorite impacts also act to reshape the landscape . 
 The continental crust consists of lower density material such as the igneous rocks granite and andesite . Less common is basalt , a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors . Sedimentary rock is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and compacted together . Nearly 75 % of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks , although they form about 5 % of the crust . The third form of rock material found on Earth is metamorphic rock , which is created from the transformation of pre @-@ existing rock types through high pressures , high temperatures , or both . The most abundant silicate minerals on Earth 's surface include quartz , feldspars , amphibole , mica , pyroxene and olivine . Common carbonate minerals include calcite ( found in limestone ) and dolomite . 
 The <unk> is the outermost layer of Earth 's continental surface and is composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes . The total arable land is 10 @.@ 9 % of the land surface , with 1 @.@ 3 % being permanent cropland . Close to 40 % of Earth 's land surface is used for cropland and pasture , or an estimated 1 @.@ 3 × 107 km2 of cropland and 3 @.@ 4 × 107 km2 of pastureland . 
 The elevation of the land surface varies from the low point of − 418 m at the Dead Sea , to a 2005 @-@ estimated maximum altitude of 8 @,@ 848 m at the top of Mount Everest . The mean height of land above sea level is 840 m . 
 Besides being described in terms of Northern and Southern hemispheres centered on the poles , Earth is also often described in terms of Eastern and Western hemispheres . Earth 's surface is traditionally divided into seven continents and various seas .

 The abundance of water on Earth 's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes the " Blue Planet " from other planets in the Solar System . Earth 's hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans , but technically includes all water surfaces in the world , including inland seas , lakes , rivers , and underground waters down to a depth of 2 @,@ 000 m . The deepest underwater location is Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean with a depth of 10 @,@ 911 @.@ 4 m . 
 The mass of the oceans is approximately 1 @.@ 35 × 1018 metric tons , or about 1 / 4400 of Earth 's total mass . The oceans cover an area of 3 @.@ 618 × 108 km2 with a mean depth of <unk> m , resulting in an estimated volume of 1 @.@ 332 × 109 km3 . If all of Earth 's crustal surface was at the same elevation as a smooth sphere , the depth of the resulting world ocean would be 2 @.@ 7 to 2 @.@ 8 km . 
 About 97 @.@ 5 % of the water is saline ; the remaining 2 @.@ 5 % is fresh water . Most fresh water , about 68 @.@ 7 % , is present as ice in ice caps and glaciers . 
 The average salinity of Earth 's oceans is about 35 grams of salt per kilogram of sea water ( 3 @.@ 5 % salt ) . Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks . The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases , which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms . Sea water has an important influence on the world 's climate , with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir . Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts , such as the El Niño @-@ Southern Oscillation . 
 = = = Atmosphere = = = 
 The atmospheric pressure on Earth 's surface averages 101 @.@ 325 kPa , with a scale height of about 8 @.@ 5 km . It has a composition of 78 % nitrogen and 21 % oxygen , with trace amounts of water vapor , carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules . The height of the troposphere varies with latitude , ranging between 8 km at the poles to 17 km at the equator , with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors . 
 Earth 's biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere . <unk> photosynthesis evolved 2 @.@ 7 Gya , forming the primarily nitrogen – oxygen atmosphere of today . This change enabled the proliferation of aerobic organisms and , indirectly , the formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3 . The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation , permitting life on land . Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor , providing useful gases , causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface , and moderating temperature . This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect : trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground , thereby raising the average temperature . Water vapor , carbon dioxide , methane and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere . Without this heat @-@ retention effect , the average surface temperature would be − 18 ° C , in contrast to the current + 15 ° C , and life would likely not exist . 
 = = = = Weather and climate = = = = 
 Earth 's atmosphere has no definite boundary , slowly becoming thinner and fading into outer space . Three @-@ quarters of the atmosphere 's mass is contained within the first 11 km of the surface . This lowest layer is called the troposphere . Energy from the Sun heats this layer , and the surface below , causing expansion of the air . This lower @-@ density air then rises , and is replaced by cooler , higher @-@ density air . The result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy . 
 The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below 30 ° latitude and the westerlies in the mid @-@ latitudes between 30 ° and 60 ° . Ocean currents are also important factors in determining climate , particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions . 
 Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere . When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm , humid air , this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation . Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes . This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land , and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods . Precipitation patterns vary widely , ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter . Atmospheric circulation , topographic features and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region . 
 The amount of solar energy reaching Earth 's surface decreases with increasing latitude . At higher latitudes the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere . As a result , the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about 0 @.@ 4 ° C ( 0 @.@ 7 ° F ) per degree of latitude from the equator . Earth 's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate . Ranging from the equator to the polar regions , these are the tropical ( or equatorial ) , subtropical , temperate and polar climates . Climate can also be classified based on the temperature and precipitation , with the climate regions characterized by fairly uniform air masses . The commonly used Köppen climate classification system ( as modified by Wladimir Köppen 's student Rudolph Geiger ) has five broad groups ( humid tropics , arid , humid middle latitudes , continental and cold polar ) , which are further divided into more specific subtypes . 
 Climate on Earth has latitudinal anomalies , namely the habitability of the Scandinavian peninsula very far north in sharp contrast to the polar climates of northern Canada as well as the cool summers expected at low latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere ( for example on the west coast of South America ) . Another anomaly is the impact of landmass on temperature , manifested by the fact that Earth is much warmer at aphelion , where the planet is at a more distant position from the Sun . When the Northern hemisphere is turned towards the sunlight even the increased distance to it does not hinder temperatures to be 2 @.@ 3 ° C ( 4 ° F ) warmer than at perihelion — when the marine southern hemisphere is turned towards the Sun . 
 At high latitudes , the western sides of continents tend to be milder than the eastern sides — for example seen in North America and Western Europe where rough continental climates appear on the east coast on parallels with mild climates on the other side of the ocean . 
 The highest air temperature ever measured on Earth was 56 @.@ 7 ° C ( 134 @.@ 1 ° F ) in Furnace Creek , California , in Death Valley , in 1913 . The lowest air temperature ever directly measured on Earth was − 89 @.@ 2 ° C ( − 128 @.@ 6 ° F ) at Vostok Station in 1983 , but satellites have used remote sensing to measure temperatures as low as − 94 @.@ 7 ° C ( − 138 @.@ 5 ° F ) in East Antarctica . These temperature records are only measurements made with modern instruments from the 20th century onwards and likely do not reflect the full range of temperature on Earth . 
 = = = = Upper atmosphere = = = = 
 Above the troposphere , the atmosphere is usually divided into the stratosphere , mesosphere , and thermosphere . Each layer has a different lapse rate , defining the rate of change in temperature with height . Beyond these , the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere , where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind . Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer , a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth . The Kármán line , defined as 100 km above Earth 's surface , is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space . 
 Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth 's gravity . This causes a slow but steady leakage of the atmosphere into space . Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass , it can achieve escape velocity more readily and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases . The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth 's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one . Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen , but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere . Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth . In the current , oxygen @-@ rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape . Instead , most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere . 
 = = = Magnetic field = = = 
 The main part of Earth 's magnetic field is generated in the core , the site of a dynamo process that converts kinetic energy of fluid convective motion into electrical and magnetic field energy . The field extends outwards from the core , through the mantle , and up to Earth 's surface , where it is , to rough approximation , a dipole . The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth 's geographic poles . At the equator of the magnetic field , the magnetic @-@ field strength at the surface is 3 @.@ 05 × 10 − 5 T , with global magnetic dipole moment of 7 @.@ 91 × 1015 T m3 . The convection movements in the core are chaotic ; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment . This causes field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years . The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700 @,@ 000 years ago . 
 = = = Magnetosphere = = = 
 The extent of Earth 's magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere . Ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere ; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere , to about 10 Earth radii , and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail . Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which wave propagate through the solar wind , a supersonic <unk> precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind . Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere ; the <unk> is defined by low @-@ energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates ; the ring current is defined by medium @-@ energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field , but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field , and the Van Allen radiation belt are formed by high @-@ energy particles whose motion is essentially random , but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere . 
 During a magnetic storm , charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere , directed along field lines into Earth 's ionosphere , where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized , causing the aurora . 
 = = Orbit and rotation = = 
 = = = Rotation = = = 
 Earth 's rotation period relative to the Sun — its mean solar day — is 86 @,@ 400 seconds of mean solar time ( 86 @,@ 400 @.@ 0025 SI seconds ) . Because Earth 's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration , each day varies between 0 and 2 SI ms longer . 
 Earth 's rotation period relative to the fixed stars , called its stellar day by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service ( <unk> ) , is 86 @,@ 164 @.@ <unk> seconds of mean solar time ( UT1 ) , or 23h <unk> <unk> Earth 's rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean vernal equinox , misnamed its sidereal day , is 86 @,@ 164 @.@ <unk> seconds of mean solar time ( UT1 ) ( 23h <unk> <unk> ) as of 1982 . Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8 @.@ 4 ms . The length of the mean solar day in SI seconds is available from the <unk> for the periods 1623 – 2005 and 1962 – 2005 . 
 Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low @-@ orbiting satellites , the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth 's sky is to the west at a rate of 15 ° / h = 15 ' / min . For bodies near the celestial equator , this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes ; from Earth 's surface , the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same . 
 = = = Orbit = = = 
 Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 150 million kilometres ( 93 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 mi ) every 365 @.@ 2564 mean solar days , or one sidereal year . This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1 ° / day , which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12 hours . Due to this motion , on average it takes 24 hours — a solar day — for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the meridian . The orbital speed of Earth averages about 29 @.@ 8 km / s ( 107 @,@ 000 km / h ) , which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth 's diameter , about 12 @,@ 742 km ( 7 @,@ 918 mi ) , in seven minutes , and the distance to the Moon , 384 @,@ 000 km ( 239 @,@ 000 mi ) , in about 3 @.@ 5 hours . 
 The Moon and Earth orbit a common barycenter every 27 @.@ 32 days relative to the background stars . When combined with the Earth – Moon system 's common orbit around the Sun , the period of the synodic month , from new moon to new moon , is 29 @.@ 53 days . Viewed from the celestial north pole , the motion of Earth , the Moon , and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise . Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth , Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun . The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned : Earth 's axis is tilted some 23 @.@ 4 degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth – Sun plane ( the ecliptic ) , and the Earth – Moon plane is tilted up to ± 5 @.@ 1 degrees against the Earth – Sun plane . Without this tilt , there would be an eclipse every two weeks , alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses . 
 The Hill sphere , or gravitational sphere of influence , of Earth is about 1 @.@ 5 million kilometres ( 930 @,@ 000 mi ) in radius . This is the maximum distance at which the Earth 's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets . Objects must orbit Earth within this radius , or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun . 
 Earth , along with the Solar System , is situated in the Milky Way and orbits about 28 @,@ 000 light @-@ years from its center . It is about 20 light @-@ years above the galactic plane in the Orion Arm . 
 = = = Axial tilt and seasons = = = 
 The axial tilt of the Earth is approximately 23 @.@ <unk> ° . Due to Earth 's axial tilt , the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year . This causes seasonal change in climate , with summer in the northern hemisphere occurring when the North Pole is pointing toward the Sun , and winter taking place when the pole is pointed away . During the summer , the day lasts longer and the Sun climbs higher in the sky . In winter , the climate becomes generally cooler and the days shorter . In northern temperate latitudes , the Sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice , and sets north of true west , reversing in the winter . The Sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone , and sets south of true west . 
 Above the Arctic Circle , an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year , up to six months at the North Pole itself , a polar night . In the southern hemisphere the situation is exactly reversed , with the South Pole oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole . Six months later , this pole will experience a midnight sun , a day of 24 hours , again reversing with the South Pole . 
 By astronomical convention , the four seasons can be determined by the solstices — the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun — and the equinoxes , when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular . In the northern hemisphere , winter solstice currently occurs around 21 December , summer solstice is near 21 June , spring equinox is around 20 March and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 September . In the southern hemisphere , the situation is reversed , with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped . 
 The angle of Earth 's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time . Its axial tilt does undergo nutation ; a slight , irregular motion with a main period of 18 @.@ 6 years . The orientation ( rather than the angle ) of Earth 's axis also changes over time , precessing around in a complete circle over each 25 @,@ 800 year cycle ; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year . Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth 's equatorial bulge . The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth 's surface . This polar motion has multiple , cyclical components , which collectively are termed <unk> motion . In addition to an annual component to this motion , there is a 14 @-@ month cycle called the Chandler wobble . Earth 's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length @-@ of @-@ day variation . 
 In modern times , Earth 's perihelion occurs around 3 January , and its aphelion around 4 July . These dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors , which follow cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch cycles . The changing Earth – Sun distance causes an increase of about 6 @.@ 9 % in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion . Because the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun , the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year . This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt , and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern hemisphere . 
 = = Habitability = = 
 A planet that can sustain life is termed habitable , even if life did not originate there . Earth provides liquid water — an environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and interact , and sufficient energy to sustain metabolism . The distance of Earth from the Sun , as well as its orbital eccentricity , rate of rotation , axial tilt , geological history , sustaining atmosphere and protective magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface . 
 = = = Biosphere = = = 
 A planet 's life forms inhabit ecosystems , whose total is sometimes said to form a " biosphere " . Earth 's biosphere is thought to have begun evolving about 3 @.@ 5 Gya . The biosphere is divided into a number of biomes , inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals . On land , biomes are separated primarily by differences in latitude , height above sea level and humidity . Terrestrial biomes lying within the Arctic or Antarctic Circles , at high altitudes or in extremely arid areas are relatively barren of plant and animal life ; species diversity reaches a peak in humid lowlands at equatorial latitudes . 
 = = = Natural resources and land use = = = 
 Earth has resources that have been exploited by humans . Those termed non @-@ renewable resources , such as fossil fuels , only renew over geological timescales . 
 Large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from Earth 's crust , consisting of coal , petroleum , and natural gas . These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production . Mineral ore bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of ore genesis , resulting from actions of magmatism , erosion and plate tectonics . These bodies form concentrated sources for many metals and other useful elements . 
 Earth 's biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans , including food , wood , pharmaceuticals , oxygen , and the recycling of many organic wastes . The land @-@ based ecosystem depends upon topsoil and fresh water , and the oceanic ecosystem depends upon dissolved nutrients washed down from the land . In 1980 , 5 @,@ 053 Mha ( 50 @.@ 53 million km2 ) of Earth 's land surface consisted of forest and woodlands , 6 @,@ 788 Mha ( 67 @.@ 88 million km2 ) was grasslands and pasture , and 1 @,@ 501 Mha ( 15 @.@ 01 million km2 ) was cultivated as croplands . The estimated amount of irrigated land in 1993 was 2 @,@ 481 @,@ 250 square kilometres ( 958 @,@ 020 sq mi ) . Humans also live on the land by using building materials to construct shelters . 
 = = = Natural and environmental hazards = = = 
 Large areas of Earth 's surface are subject to extreme weather such as tropical cyclones , hurricanes , or typhoons that dominate life in those areas . From 1980 to 2000 , these events caused an average of 11 @,@ 800 human deaths per year . Many places are subject to earthquakes , landslides , tsunamis , volcanic eruptions , tornadoes , sinkholes , blizzards , floods , droughts , wildfires , and other calamities and disasters . 
 Many localized areas are subject to human @-@ made pollution of the air and water , acid rain and toxic substances , loss of vegetation ( overgrazing , deforestation , desertification ) , loss of wildlife , species extinction , soil degradation , soil depletion and erosion . 
 According to the United Nations , a scientific consensus exists linking human activities to global warming due to industrial carbon dioxide emissions . This is predicted to produce changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets , more extreme temperature ranges , significant changes in weather and a global rise in average sea levels . 
 = = = Human geography = = = 
 Cartography , the study and practice of map @-@ making , and geography , the study of the lands , features , inhabitants and phenomena on Earth , have historically been the disciplines devoted to depicting Earth . Surveying , the determination of locations and distances , and to a lesser extent navigation , the determination of position and direction , have developed alongside cartography and geography , providing and suitably quantifying the requisite information . 
 Earth 's human population reached approximately seven billion on 31 October 2011 . Projections indicate that the world 's human population will reach 9 @.@ 2 billion in 2050 . Most of the growth is expected to take place in developing nations . Human population density varies widely around the world , but a majority live in Asia . By 2020 , 60 % of the world 's population is expected to be living in urban , rather than rural , areas . 
 It is estimated that one @-@ eighth of Earth 's surface is suitable for humans to live on – three @-@ quarters of Earth 's surface is covered by oceans , leaving one quarter as land . Half of that land area is desert ( 14 % ) , high mountains ( 27 % ) , or other unsuitable terrain . The northernmost permanent settlement in the world is Alert , on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut , Canada . ( 82 ° 28 ′ N ) The southernmost is the Amundsen – Scott South Pole Station , in Antarctica , almost exactly at the South Pole . ( 90 ° S ) 
 Independent sovereign nations claim the planet 's entire land surface , except for some parts of Antarctica , a few land parcels along the Danube river 's western bank , and the odd unclaimed area of Bir Tawil between Egypt and Sudan . As of 2015 , there are 193 sovereign states that are member states of the United Nations , plus two observer states and 72 dependent territories and states with limited recognition . Historically , Earth has never had a sovereign government with authority over the entire globe although a number of nation @-@ states have striven for world domination and failed . 
 The United Nations is a worldwide intergovernmental organization that was created with the goal of intervening in the disputes between nations , thereby avoiding armed conflict . The U.N. serves primarily as a forum for international diplomacy and international law . When the consensus of the membership permits , it provides a mechanism for armed intervention . 
 The first human to orbit Earth was Yuri Gagarin on 12 April 1961 . In total , about 487 people have visited outer space and reached orbit as of 30 July 2010 , and , of these , twelve have walked on the Moon . Normally , the only humans in space are those on the International Space Station . The station 's crew , made up of six people , is usually replaced every six months . The farthest that humans have travelled from Earth is 400 @,@ 171 km , achieved during the Apollo 13 mission in 1970 . 
 = = Moon = = 
 The Moon is a relatively large , terrestrial , planet @-@ like natural satellite , with a diameter about one @-@ quarter of Earth 's . It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet , although Charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet Pluto . The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as " moons " , after Earth 's . 
 The gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes tides on Earth . The same effect on the Moon has led to its tidal locking : its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth . As a result , it always presents the same face to the planet . As the Moon orbits Earth , different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun , leading to the lunar phases ; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the solar terminator . 
 Due to their tidal interaction , the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately 38 mm / yr . Over millions of years , these tiny modifications — and the lengthening of Earth 's day by about 23 µs / yr — add up to significant changes . During the Devonian period , for example , ( approximately 410 mya ) there were 400 days in a year , with each day lasting 21 @.@ 8 hours . 
 The Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet 's climate . Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth 's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon . Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the Sun and planets to Earth 's equatorial bulge , the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable , exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years , as appears to be the case for Mars . 
 Viewed from Earth , the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent @-@ sized disk as the Sun . The angular size ( or solid angle ) of these two bodies match because , although the Sun 's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon 's , it is also 400 times more distant . This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth . 
 The most widely accepted theory of the Moon 's origin , the giant impact theory , states that it formed from the collision of a Mars @-@ size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth . This hypothesis explains ( among other things ) the Moon 's relative lack of iron and volatile elements , and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth 's crust . 
 = = Asteroids and artificial satellites = = 
 Earth has at least five co @-@ orbital asteroids , including <unk> Cruithne and 2002 <unk> . A trojan asteroid companion , 2010 <unk> , is <unk> around the leading Lagrange triangular point , L4 , in the Earth 's orbit around the Sun . 
 The tiny near @-@ Earth asteroid 2006 <unk> makes close approaches to the Earth – Moon system roughly every twenty years . During these approaches , it can orbit Earth for brief periods of time . 
 As of September 2015 , there were 1 @,@ 305 operational , human @-@ made satellites orbiting Earth . There are also inoperative satellites , including Vanguard 1 , the oldest satellite currently in orbit , and over 300 @,@ 000 pieces of space debris . Earth 's largest artificial satellite is the International Space Station . 
 = = Cultural and historical viewpoint = = 
 The standard astronomical symbol of Earth consists of a cross circumscribed by a circle , , representing the four quadrants of the world . 
 Human cultures have developed many views of the planet . Earth is sometimes personified as a deity . In many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity , and by the mid @-@ 20th century the Gaia Principle compared Earth 's environments and life as a single self @-@ regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability . Creation myths in many religions involve the creation of Earth by a supernatural deity or deities . 
 Scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in our view of the planet . In the West , belief in a flat Earth was displaced by the idea of spherical Earth , credited to Pythagoras in the 6th century BC . Earth was further believed to be the center of the universe until the 16th century , when scientists first theorized that it was a moving object , comparable to the other planets in the Solar System . Due to the efforts of influential Christian scholars and clerics such as James Ussher , who sought to determine the age of Earth through analysis of genealogies in Scripture , Westerners prior to the 19th century generally believed Earth to be a few thousand years old at most . It was only during the 19th century that geologists realized Earth 's age was at least many millions of years . Lord Kelvin used thermodynamics to estimate the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400 million years in 1864 , sparking a vigorous debate on the subject ; it was only when radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth 's age was established , proving the planet to be billions of years old . The perception of Earth shifted again in the 20th century when humans first viewed it from orbit , and especially with photographs of Earth returned by the Apollo program . 
 = Brandon Marsh = 
 Brandon Marsh is an SSSI ( Site of Special Scientific Interest ) and nature reserve in Warwickshire , England . It is situated adjacent to the River Avon , near the village of Brandon , a few miles east of Coventry . 
 The reserve is also the headquarters of the Warwickshire Wildlife Trust . Formerly used for sand and gravel quarrying , the 92 hectare ( 228 acre ) site is owned by French industrial company <unk> Industries and is leased to the Trust . 
 Today , Brandon Marsh is a mixture of flooded gravel pits , fen , scrubland , reedbeds and woodland , much of which is uncommon habitat for the local area . The site is particularly important for birdlife , with a wide range of breeding and wintering birds — 234 different species had been recorded up to the end of 2014 . The reserve also supports a variety of mammals and insects , over 500 species of plant , and more than 570 species of fungi . The nature reserve and Visitor Centre are open to the public seven days a week . 
 = = History = = 
 Although the landscape features of the site are mainly derived from gravel pits and settling pools alongside the River Avon , the area was originally farmland , and the first pools were created by mining subsidence in the 1940s and 1950s caused by workings at <unk> Colliery . The site was of interest to local naturalists for its range of bird life , especially as by 1959 the area of open water was far larger than it is now , although much was lost when Severn Trent Water dredged it in 1963 . Shortly afterwards the first official attempts at using the site for conservation purposes came when the West Midlands Trust for Nature Conservation , supported by the West Midland Bird Club began moves to secure the site as a Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) . The Brandon Marsh Conservation Group was formed in 1968 , and by 1973 the site had been confirmed as an SSSI . In 1981 , the Warwickshire Wildlife Trust ( the successor to the West Midlands Trust ) came to an agreement with Lafarge whereby the site is leased for a period of 99 years at a peppercorn amount of £ 1 a year , leading to the creation of the nature reserve . 
 The first bird hides were constructed in 1984 , overlooking the East Marsh and Teal Pools . Quarrying ceased in 1989 , and by 1991 the Trust had moved their headquarters to the site and erected a small visitor centre . 
 As improvements to the reserve continued and visitor numbers grew , a requirement for a much improved infrastructure was identified , and in 1998 the new Visitor Centre at Brandon Marsh was opened by Sir David Attenborough . It cost over £ 600 @,@ 000 to build and was mainly funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund , with support from Lafarge through the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme and an appeal to Trust members . The Centre is open to the public every day of the year except Christmas Day , and also houses an Education Centre catering for school visits , a conference centre , and a tearoom and gift shop . 
 = = Nature reserve = = 
 The nature reserve itself is a large expanse of wetland and pools . There are a number of paths and trails for visitors to follow , and seven bird hides from which to observe the wildlife . The flora and fauna is extremely varied due to the numerous types of habitat , and includes many species that are otherwise rare in the area . 
 Large numbers of bird species are resident or passage migrants here , including many ducks , geese and waders . The wide range of species is mainly due to Brandon Marsh being one of the few extensive areas of water in the area ( accounting for such local rarities as osprey and whooper swan ) together with the existence of habitats such as reedbed and woodland in close proximity . 148 different species were recorded during 2009 alone — including one new record , a vagrant woodchat shrike which was the first recorded in Warwickshire — and 66 species bred at the site . These figures have been assisted by a nest box scheme ; in 2008 there were 49 occupied nest boxes which produced 270 fledged young , and by 2009 these numbers had increased to 65 and 352 respectively , including two owl species , barn owl and tawny owl . 
 As well as birds , the reserve also harbours a varied selection of mammals . These are mostly of common species , although otters have been recorded and evidence suggests they were present for the whole of 2009 . An attempt is being made to establish the endangered water vole to the site , although success has been irregular and there were no sightings at all during 2008 or 2009 . The reserve is a haven for dragonfly and damselfly with areas being tailored to their needs — 16 species were recorded in 2008 , along with 24 species of butterfly and 220 species of moth . 
 Plant life varies throughout the reserve depending on the habitat , and notable species are mentioned in the relevant sections . As the reserve develops , new species are being regularly recorded , including four in 2008 and three in 2009 . The large number of fungus species recorded is also due to the diversity of habitat , but even so , species unknown elsewhere in the region have been recorded , such as Taphrina <unk> and <unk> <unk> . 
 = = = Pools = = = 
 There are eight main pools in the reserve , some of which are maintained to support specific flora or fauna . At the centre of the reserve is East Marsh Pool , the largest of the pools , which contains two islands . Tern Island is composed of gravel and pebbles which attracts certain species to breed here , notably common tern and little ringed plover . There are also a number of artificial rafts on the pool , again to induce common tern to breed ; eight pairs did so in 2008 . Willow Island is much larger and more grassy , providing suitable areas for lapwing , common redshank and green sandpiper . The existence of the islands helps to prevent the nests of species such as these being predated by foxes . There are three hides overlooking the pool . An artificial structure alongside the pool is designed to attract sand martins to breed , as they did when the gravel quarry was operational ; this was successful for the first time in 2009 , with eight <unk> occupied and over 40 young fledged . 
 To the south lie Teal Pool and River Pool , created in 1983 when an earth dam was constructed between the two in order that Teal Pool retained water to provide habitat for dabbling duck species , which generally include common teal and mallard . River Pool is a larger expanse of water popular with wading birds , especially redshank and greenshank . 
 Central Marsh and Pool is a diverse area where the main flora is common reed , reed sweetgrass , sedges , bulrushes and teasel . Willow trees are particularly important in this habitat as they have over 250 species of insect associated with them . Alder trees support birds such as redpoll , siskin and various tit species . Beyond Central Marsh lies West Marsh Pool , a small area of water surrounded by reedbed , where a number of dragonfly pools have been dug . Plants which thrive in damp areas , such as marsh marigold and meadowsweet , flourish here . 
 Adjacent to the visitor centre are three further pools . Grebe Pool is named for the great crested grebes which regularly breed there , whereas Goose Pool was used by the aggregate company for water storage , and as such the water level is very variable due to its unstable base . Swallow Pool was so named because it was formerly a favourite roosting area for swallows , although this is no longer the case . 
 = = = Reedbeds = = = 
 The main reedbed on the site is known as Newlands , an extensive area forming the eastern end of the reserve . Together with other areas in the West Marsh , the total area of reedbed is now around 25 hectares ( 61 acres ) . A wind @-@ powered water pump is currently installed to lift water from the flood plain to irrigate a further 9 hectare ( 22 acre ) area near the Visitor Centre . This project is part of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan which has targeted the creation of 1 @,@ 200 hectare ( 3 @,@ 000 acres ) of reedbed nationwide . The reedbeds support a number of <unk> warblers such as the reed warbler , sedge warbler and marsh warbler as well as others such as grasshopper warbler , and it was the first recorded breeding site in the region for Cetti 's warbler . There is a long @-@ term plan to have an endangered species , the Eurasian bittern , breeding here by 2014 and regular sightings of the species have already occurred , with up to three individual birds being sighted during late 2009 . A new hide overlooking Newlands , named after Brandon volunteer Ted Jury who died in 2009 , was opened in 2014 . 
 = = = Other habitats = = = 
 New Hare Covert is woodland , mainly composed of oak , ash , larch and Scots pine . The area is managed for biodiversity purposes and provides habitat for numerous mammals , including muntjac , as well as woodland bird species . Between New Hare Covert and Swallow Pool there is also an area of grassland , which attracts numerous species of butterfly . The area also has a large population of small mammals such as common shrew , field vole and bank vole , which in turn attract birds of prey such as the common kestrel and short @-@ eared owl .

 Brandon Marsh has a very low risk of pollution and as such the main threat from man has been from vandalism ; in 2007 , a fire started by youths destroyed a third of the Newlands reedbed . This was the second time the reed bed had been targeted , the previous attack seven years earlier having occurred shortly after threats were made by animal rights activists protesting against a cull of ruddy duck . 
 Most of the current threats to the biodiversity of the site are natural in origin . A perennial problem is the invasive Japanese knotweed , which shades out local plant species with its dense growth . Removing it is time @-@ consuming as the herbicide used to control it has to be injected straight into the root system , to prevent it reaching other flora . Alder trees are also at risk at the reserve , this time from a fungal disease caused by Phytophthora alni . Being water @-@ borne , this infection could spread to all the alders on the site . Another natural threat is that of the introduced Harlequin ladybird which was first identified at the site in June 2008 and is a severe threat to the native seven @-@ spot ladybird population as it is such an effective aphid predator . Mink are occasional visitors to the reserve , although humane traps are used in an attempt to control them . Mink are a serious threat to ground @-@ nesting birds , and since they are strong swimmers , the nests on the East Marsh islands are vulnerable to them . 
 = Falafel = 
 Falafel ( / <unk> / ; Arabic : <unk> , [ <unk> ] , dialectal : [ <unk> ] ) is a deep @-@ fried ball or patty made from ground chickpeas , fava beans , or both . Falafel is a traditional Middle Eastern food , commonly served in a pita , which acts as a pocket , or wrapped in a flatbread known as taboon ; " falafel " also frequently refers to a wrapped sandwich that is prepared in this way . The falafel balls are topped with salads , pickled vegetables , hot sauce , and drizzled with tahini @-@ based sauces . Falafel balls may also be eaten alone as a snack or served as part of a meze tray ( assortment of appetizers ) . 
 Falafel is a common dish eaten throughout the Middle East . The fritters are now found around the world as a replacement for meat and as a form of street food . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The word <unk> ( Arabic : <unk> ) is the plural of <unk> ( <unk> ) , meaning " pepper " . The word itself spread and is used in other languages such as Persian <unk> ( <unk> ) , from the Sanskrit word <unk> ( <unk> ् <unk> ) , meaning " long pepper " ; or an earlier * <unk> , from Aramaic <unk> , " small round thing , peppercorn , " derived from <unk> , " to be round , roll " . Thus in origin , falafel would be " rollers , little balls . " 
 A Coptic origin has recently been proposed via the unattested phrase * pha la <unk> ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , meaning " of many beans " . 
 The Arabic word <unk> has been globalized into many other languages and spread around the rest of the world as the general name for this food . In English , it is first attested in 1941 . 
 Falafel is known as <unk> ( Egyptian Arabic : <unk> <unk> , IPA : [ <unk> ] ) in Egypt . The word is derived from a diminutive form of the Arabic word <unk> ( <unk> , " food " ) ; the particular form indicates " a unit " of the given root in this case <unk> @-@ ʕ @-@ M ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , having to do with taste and food ) , thus meaning " a little piece of food " or " small tasty thing " . 
 The word falafel can refer to the fritters themselves or to sandwiches filled with them . 
 = = History = = 
 The origin of falafel is unknown and controversial . A common theory is that the dish originated in Egypt , possibly eaten by Copts as a replacement for meat during Lent . As Alexandria is a port city , it was possible to export the dish and name to other areas in the Middle East . The dish later migrated northwards to the Levant , where chickpeas replaced the fava beans . It has been speculated that its history may go back to Pharaonic Egypt . 
 = = = Middle East = = = 
 Falafel grew to become a common form of street food or fast food in the Middle East . The croquettes are regularly eaten as part of meze . During Ramadan , falafel balls are sometimes eaten as part of the iftar , the meal that breaks the daily fast after sunset . Falafel became so popular that McDonald 's for a time served a " <unk> " in some countries . Falafel is still popular with the Copts , who cook large volumes during religious holidays . Debates over the origin of falafel have sometimes devolved into political discussions about the relationship between Arabs and Israelis . In modern times , falafel has been considered a national dish of Egypt , Palestine , and of Israel . Resentment exists amongst many Palestinians for what they see as the appropriation of their dish by Israelis . Additionally , the Lebanese <unk> ' Association has raised assertions of copyright infringement against Israel concerning falafel . 
 Falafel plays an iconic role in Israeli cuisine and is widely considered to be the national dish of the country . While falafel is not a specifically Jewish dish , it was eaten by Mizrahi Jews in their countries of origin . Later , it was adopted by early Jewish immigrants to Palestine . Due to its being entirely plant based , it is considered pareve under Jewish dietary laws and gained acceptance with Jews because it could be eaten with meat or dairy meals . 
 In 2012 , in an attempt to challenge Israeli claims regarding the origins of Falafel , and reassert the Arabic identity of the food , one of the hotels in the capital of Jordan , Amman , prepared the world 's largest Falafel disc weighing about 75 kg – breaking the previous record set at a Jewish food festival in the United States .

In the United States , falafel 's versatility has allowed for the reformulating of recipes for meatloaf , sloppy joes and spaghetti and meatballs into vegetarian dishes . 
 = = Preparation and variations = = 
 Falafel is made from fava beans or chickpeas , or a combination of the two . The use of chickpeas is predominant in most Middle Eastern countries . The dish is usually made with chickpeas in Syria , Lebanon , Jordan , Israel and Palestine . This version is the most popular in the West . The Egyptian variety uses only fava beans . 
 When chickpeas are used , they are not cooked prior to use ( cooking the chickpeas will cause the falafel to fall apart , requiring adding some flour to use as a binder ) . Instead they are soaked ( sometimes with baking soda ) overnight , then ground together with various ingredients such as parsley , scallions , and garlic . Spices such as cumin and coriander are often added to the beans for added flavor . The dried fava beans are soaked in water and then stone ground with leek , parsley , green coriander , cumin and dry coriander . The mixture is shaped into balls or patties . This can be done by hand or with a tool called an <unk> falafel ( falafel mould ) . The mixture is usually deep fried , or it can be oven baked . 
 When not served alone , falafel is often served with flat or unleavened bread when it is wrapped within lafa or stuffed in a hollow pita . Tomatoes , lettuce , cucumbers , and other garnishes can be added . Falafel is commonly accompanied by tahini . 
 Falafel is typically ball @-@ shaped , but is sometimes made in other shapes , particularly donut @-@ shaped . The inside of falafel may be green ( from green herbs such as parsley or green onion ) , or tan .

 = Genetics = 
 Genetics is the study of genes , genetic variation , and heredity in living organisms . It is generally considered a field of biology , but it intersects frequently with many of the life sciences and is strongly linked with the study of information systems . 
 The father of genetics is Gregor Mendel , a late 19th @-@ century scientist and Augustinian friar . Mendel studied ' trait inheritance ' , patterns in the way traits were handed down from parents to offspring . He observed that organisms ( pea plants ) inherit traits by way of discrete " units of inheritance " . This term , still used today , is a somewhat ambiguous definition of what is referred to as a gene . 
 Trait inheritance and molecular inheritance mechanisms of genes are still primary principles of genetics in the 21st century , but modern genetics has expanded beyond inheritance to studying the function and behavior of genes . Gene structure and function , variation , and distribution are studied within the context of the cell , the organism ( e.g. dominance ) and within the context of a population . Genetics has given rise to a number of sub @-@ fields including epigenetics and population genetics . Organisms studied within the broad field span the domain of life , including bacteria , plants , animals , and humans . 
 Genetic processes work in combination with an organism 's environment and experiences to influence development and behavior , often referred to as nature versus nurture . The intra- or extra @-@ cellular environment of a cell or organism may switch gene transcription on or off . A classic example is two seeds of genetically identical corn , one placed in a temperate climate and one in an arid climate . While the average height of the two corn stalks may be genetically determined to be equal , the one in the arid climate only grows to half the height of the one in the temperate climate due to lack of water and nutrients in its environment . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The word genetics stems from the Ancient Greek <unk> <unk> meaning " genitive " / " generative " , which in turn derives from <unk> genesis meaning " origin " . 
 = = The gene = = 
 The modern working definition of a gene is a portion ( or sequence ) of DNA that codes for a known cellular function or process ( e.g. the function " make melanin molecules " ) . A single ' gene ' is most similar to a single ' word ' in the English language . The nucleotides ( molecules ) that make up genes can be seen as ' letters ' in the English language . Nucleotides are named according to which of the four nitrogenous bases they contain . The four bases are cytosine , guanine , adenine , and thymine . A single gene may have a small number of nucleotides or a large number of nucleotides , in the same way that a word may be small or large ( e.g. ' cell ' vs. ' electrophysiology ' ) . A single gene often interacts with neighboring genes to produce a cellular function and can even be ineffectual without those neighboring genes . This can be seen in the same way that a ' word ' may have meaning only in the context of a ' sentence . ' A series of nucleotides can be put together without forming a gene ( non coding regions of DNA ) , like a string of letters can be put together without forming a word ( e.g. <unk> ) . Nonetheless , all words have letters , like all genes must have nucleotides . 
 A quick heuristic that is often used ( but not always true ) is " one gene , one protein " meaning a singular gene codes for a singular protein type in a cell ( enzyme , transcription factor , etc . ) . 
 The sequence of nucleotides in a gene is read and translated by a cell to produce a chain of amino acids which in turn folds into a protein . The order of amino acids in a protein corresponds to the order of nucleotides in the gene . This relationship between nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequence is known as the genetic code . The amino acids in a protein determine how it folds into its unique three @-@ dimensional shape , a structure that is ultimately responsible for the protein 's function . Proteins carry out many of the functions needed for cells to live . A change to the DNA in a gene can alter a protein 's amino acid sequence , thereby changing its shape and function and rendering the protein ineffective or even malignant ( e.g. sickle cell anemia ) . Changes to genes are called mutations . 
 = = History = = 
 The observation that living things inherit traits from their parents has been used since prehistoric times to improve crop plants and animals through selective breeding . The modern science of genetics , seeking to understand this process , began with the work of Gregor Mendel in the mid @-@ 19th century . 
 Prior to Mendel , Imre Festetics , a Hungarian noble , who lived in Kőszeg before Gregor Mendel , was the first who used the word " genetics " . He described several rules of genetic inheritance in his work The genetic law of the Nature ( Die <unk> <unk> der Natur , 1819 ) . His second law is the same as what Mendel published . In his third law , he developed the basic principles of mutation ( he can be considered a forerunner of Hugo de Vries . ) 
 Other theories of inheritance preceded his work . A popular theory during Mendel 's time was the concept of blending inheritance : the idea that individuals inherit a smooth blend of traits from their parents . Mendel 's work provided examples where traits were definitely not blended after hybridization , showing that traits are produced by combinations of distinct genes rather than a continuous blend . Blending of traits in the progeny is now explained by the action of multiple genes with quantitative effects . Another theory that had some support at that time was the inheritance of acquired characteristics : the belief that individuals inherit traits strengthened by their parents . This theory ( commonly associated with Jean @-@ Baptiste Lamarck ) is now known to be wrong — the experiences of individuals do not affect the genes they pass to their children , although evidence in the field of epigenetics has revived some aspects of Lamarck 's theory . Other theories included the pangenesis of Charles Darwin ( which had both acquired and inherited aspects ) and Francis Galton 's reformulation of pangenesis as both particulate and inherited . 
 = = = Mendelian and classical genetics = = = 
 Modern genetics started with Gregor Johann Mendel , a scientist and Augustinian friar who studied the nature of inheritance in plants . In his paper " <unk> über <unk> " ( " Experiments on Plant Hybridization " ) , presented in 1865 to the <unk> Verein ( Society for Research in Nature ) in <unk> , Mendel traced the inheritance patterns of certain traits in pea plants and described them mathematically . Although this pattern of inheritance could only be observed for a few traits , Mendel 's work suggested that heredity was particulate , not acquired , and that the inheritance patterns of many traits could be explained through simple rules and ratios . 
 The importance of Mendel 's work did not gain wide understanding until the 1890s , after his death , when other scientists working on similar problems re @-@ discovered his research . William Bateson , a proponent of Mendel 's work , coined the word genetics in 1905 . ( The adjective genetic , derived from the Greek word genesis — <unk> , " origin " , predates the noun and was first used in a biological sense in 1860 . ) Bateson both acted as a mentor and was aided significantly by the work of women scientists from Newnham College at Cambridge , specifically the work of Becky Saunders , Nora Darwin Barlow , and Muriel Wheldale Onslow . Bateson popularized the usage of the word genetics to describe the study of inheritance in his inaugural address to the Third International Conference on Plant Hybridization in London , England , in 1906 . 
 After the rediscovery of Mendel 's work , scientists tried to determine which molecules in the cell were responsible for inheritance . In 1911 , Thomas Hunt Morgan argued that genes are on chromosomes , based on observations of a sex @-@ linked white eye mutation in fruit flies . In 1913 , his student Alfred Sturtevant used the phenomenon of genetic linkage to show that genes are arranged linearly on the chromosome . 
 = = = Molecular genetics = = = 
 Although genes were known to exist on chromosomes , chromosomes are composed of both protein and DNA , and scientists did not know which of the two is responsible for inheritance . In 1928 , Frederick Griffith discovered the phenomenon of transformation ( see Griffith 's experiment ) : dead bacteria could transfer genetic material to " transform " other still @-@ living bacteria . Sixteen years later , in 1944 , the Avery – MacLeod – McCarty experiment identified DNA as the molecule responsible for transformation . The role of the nucleus as the repository of genetic information in eukaryotes had been established by <unk> in 1943 in his work on the single celled alga <unk> . The Hershey – Chase experiment in 1952 confirmed that DNA ( rather than protein ) is the genetic material of the viruses that infect bacteria , providing further evidence that DNA is the molecule responsible for inheritance . 
 James Watson and Francis Crick determined the structure of DNA in 1953 , using the X @-@ ray crystallography work of Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins that indicated DNA had a helical structure ( i.e. , shaped like a corkscrew ) . Their double @-@ helix model had two strands of DNA with the nucleotides pointing inward , each matching a complementary nucleotide on the other strand to form what looks like rungs on a twisted ladder . This structure showed that genetic information exists in the sequence of nucleotides on each strand of DNA . The structure also suggested a simple method for replication : if the strands are separated , new partner strands can be reconstructed for each based on the sequence of the old strand . This property is what gives DNA its semi @-@ conservative nature where one strand of new DNA is from an original parent strand . 
 Although the structure of DNA showed how inheritance works , it was still not known how DNA influences the behavior of cells . In the following years , scientists tried to understand how DNA controls the process of protein production . It was discovered that the cell uses DNA as a template to create matching messenger RNA , molecules with nucleotides very similar to DNA . The nucleotide sequence of a messenger RNA is used to create an amino acid sequence in protein ; this translation between nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences is known as the genetic code . 
 With the newfound molecular understanding of inheritance came an explosion of research . A notable theory arose from Tomoko Ohta in 1973 with her amendment to the neutral theory of molecular evolution through publishing the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution . In this theory , Ohta stressed the importance of natural selection and the environment to the rate at which genetic evolution occurs . One important development was chain @-@ termination DNA sequencing in 1977 by Frederick Sanger . This technology allows scientists to read the nucleotide sequence of a DNA molecule . In 1983 , Kary Banks Mullis developed the polymerase chain reaction , providing a quick way to isolate and amplify a specific section of DNA from a mixture . The efforts of the Human Genome Project , Department of Energy , NIH , and parallel private efforts by Celera Genomics led to the sequencing of the human genome in 2003 . 
 = = Features of inheritance = = 
 = = = Discrete inheritance and Mendel 's laws = = = 
 At its most fundamental level , inheritance in organisms occurs by passing discrete heritable units , called genes , from parents to progeny . This property was first observed by Gregor Mendel , who studied the segregation of heritable traits in pea plants . In his experiments studying the trait for flower color , Mendel observed that the flowers of each pea plant were either purple or white — but never an intermediate between the two colors . These different , discrete versions of the same gene are called alleles . 
 In the case of the pea , which is a diploid species , each individual plant has two copies of each gene , one copy inherited from each parent . Many species , including humans , have this pattern of inheritance . <unk> organisms with two copies of the same allele of a given gene are called homozygous at that gene locus , while organisms with two different alleles of a given gene are called heterozygous . 
 The set of alleles for a given organism is called its genotype , while the observable traits of the organism are called its phenotype . When organisms are heterozygous at a gene , often one allele is called dominant as its qualities dominate the phenotype of the organism , while the other allele is called recessive as its qualities recede and are not observed . Some alleles do not have complete dominance and instead have incomplete dominance by expressing an intermediate phenotype , or <unk> by expressing both alleles at once . 
 When a pair of organisms reproduce sexually , their offspring randomly inherit one of the two alleles from each parent . These observations of discrete inheritance and the segregation of alleles are collectively known as Mendel 's first law or the Law of Segregation . 
 = = = Notation and diagrams = = = 
 <unk> use diagrams and symbols to describe inheritance . A gene is represented by one or a few letters . Often a " + " symbol is used to mark the usual , non @-@ mutant allele for a gene . 
 In fertilization and breeding experiments ( and especially when discussing Mendel 's laws ) the parents are referred to as the " P " generation and the offspring as the " F1 " ( first filial ) generation . When the F1 offspring mate with each other , the offspring are called the " F2 " ( second filial ) generation . One of the common diagrams used to predict the result of cross @-@ breeding is the Punnett square . 
 When studying human genetic diseases , geneticists often use pedigree charts to represent the inheritance of traits . These charts map the inheritance of a trait in a family tree . 
 = = = Multiple gene interactions = = = 
 Organisms have thousands of genes , and in sexually reproducing organisms these genes generally assort independently of each other . This means that the inheritance of an allele for yellow or green pea color is unrelated to the inheritance of alleles for white or purple flowers . This phenomenon , known as " Mendel 's second law " or the " Law of independent assortment " , means that the alleles of different genes get shuffled between parents to form offspring with many different combinations . ( Some genes do not assort independently , demonstrating genetic linkage , a topic discussed later in this article . ) 
 Often different genes can interact in a way that influences the same trait . In the Blue @-@ eyed Mary ( <unk> verna ) , for example , there exists a gene with alleles that determine the color of flowers : blue or magenta . Another gene , however , controls whether the flowers have color at all or are white . When a plant has two copies of this white allele , its flowers are white — regardless of whether the first gene has blue or magenta alleles . This interaction between genes is called <unk> , with the second gene <unk> to the first . 
 Many traits are not discrete features ( e.g. purple or white flowers ) but are instead continuous features ( e.g. human height and skin color ) . These complex traits are products of many genes . The influence of these genes is mediated , to varying degrees , by the environment an organism has experienced . The degree to which an organism 's genes contribute to a complex trait is called heritability . Measurement of the heritability of a trait is relative — in a more variable environment , the environment has a bigger influence on the total variation of the trait . For example , human height is a trait with complex causes . It has a heritability of 89 % in the United States . In Nigeria , however , where people experience a more variable access to good nutrition and health care , height has a heritability of only 62 % . 
 = = Molecular basis for inheritance = = 
 = = = DNA and chromosomes = = = 
 The molecular basis for genes is deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) . DNA is composed of a chain of nucleotides , of which there are four types : adenine ( A ) , cytosine ( C ) , guanine ( G ) , and thymine ( T ) . Genetic information exists in the sequence of these nucleotides , and genes exist as stretches of sequence along the DNA chain . Viruses are the only exception to this rule — sometimes viruses use the very similar molecule , RNA , instead of DNA as their genetic material . Viruses cannot reproduce without a host and are unaffected by many genetic processes , so tend not to be considered living organisms . 
 DNA normally exists as a double @-@ stranded molecule , coiled into the shape of a double helix . Each nucleotide in DNA preferentially pairs with its partner nucleotide on the opposite strand : A pairs with T , and C pairs with G. Thus , in its two @-@ stranded form , each strand effectively contains all necessary information , redundant with its partner strand . This structure of DNA is the physical basis for inheritance : DNA replication duplicates the genetic information by splitting the strands and using each strand as a template for synthesis of a new partner strand . 
 Genes are arranged linearly along long chains of DNA base @-@ pair sequences . In bacteria , each cell usually contains a single circular <unk> , while eukaryotic organisms ( such as plants and animals ) have their DNA arranged in multiple linear chromosomes . These DNA strands are often extremely long ; the largest human chromosome , for example , is about 247 million base pairs in length . The DNA of a chromosome is associated with structural proteins that organize , compact and control access to the DNA , forming a material called chromatin ; in eukaryotes , chromatin is usually composed of nucleosomes , segments of DNA wound around cores of histone proteins . The full set of hereditary material in an organism ( usually the combined DNA sequences of all chromosomes ) is called the genome . 
 While haploid organisms have only one copy of each chromosome , most animals and many plants are diploid , containing two of each chromosome and thus two copies of every gene . The two alleles for a gene are located on identical loci of the two homologous chromosomes , each allele inherited from a different parent . 
 Many species have so @-@ called sex chromosomes that determine the gender of each organism . In humans and many other animals , the Y chromosome contains the gene that triggers the development of the specifically male characteristics . In evolution , this chromosome has lost most of its content and also most of its genes , while the X chromosome is similar to the other chromosomes and contains many genes . The X and Y chromosomes form a strongly heterogeneous pair . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 When cells divide , their full genome is copied and each daughter cell inherits one copy . This process , called mitosis , is the simplest form of reproduction and is the basis for asexual reproduction . Asexual reproduction can also occur in multicellular organisms , producing offspring that inherit their genome from a single parent . Offspring that are genetically identical to their parents are called clones . 
 Eukaryotic organisms often use sexual reproduction to generate offspring that contain a mixture of genetic material inherited from two different parents . The process of sexual reproduction alternates between forms that contain single copies of the genome ( haploid ) and double copies ( diploid ) . <unk> cells fuse and combine genetic material to create a diploid cell with paired chromosomes . <unk> organisms form <unk> by dividing , without replicating their DNA , to create daughter cells that randomly inherit one of each pair of chromosomes . Most animals and many plants are diploid for most of their lifespan , with the haploid form reduced to single cell gametes such as sperm or eggs . 
 Although they do not use the haploid / diploid method of sexual reproduction , bacteria have many methods of acquiring new genetic information . Some bacteria can undergo conjugation , transferring a small circular piece of DNA to another bacterium . Bacteria can also take up raw DNA fragments found in the environment and integrate them into their genomes , a phenomenon known as transformation . These processes result in horizontal gene transfer , transmitting fragments of genetic information between organisms that would be otherwise unrelated . 
 = = = Recombination and genetic linkage = = = 
 The diploid nature of chromosomes allows for genes on different chromosomes to assort independently or be separated from their homologous pair during sexual reproduction wherein haploid gametes are formed . In this way new combinations of genes can occur in the offspring of a mating pair . Genes on the same chromosome would theoretically never recombine . However , they do via the cellular process of chromosomal crossover . During crossover , chromosomes exchange stretches of DNA , effectively shuffling the gene alleles between the chromosomes . This process of chromosomal crossover generally occurs during meiosis , a series of cell divisions that creates haploid cells . 
 The first cytological demonstration of crossing over was performed by Harriet Creighton and Barbara McClintock in 1931 . Their research and experiments on corn provided cytological evidence for the genetic theory that linked genes on paired chromosomes do in fact exchange places from one homolog to the other . 
 The probability of chromosomal crossover occurring between two given points on the chromosome is related to the distance between the points . For an arbitrarily long distance , the probability of crossover is high enough that the inheritance of the genes is effectively uncorrelated . For genes that are closer together , however , the lower probability of crossover means that the genes demonstrate genetic linkage ; alleles for the two genes tend to be inherited together . The amounts of linkage between a series of genes can be combined to form a linear linkage map that roughly describes the arrangement of the genes along the chromosome . 
 = = Gene expression = = 
 = = = Genetic code = = = 
 Genes generally express their functional effect through the production of proteins , which are complex molecules responsible for most functions in the cell . Proteins are made up of one or more polypeptide chains , each of which is composed of a sequence of amino acids , and the DNA sequence of a gene ( through an RNA intermediate ) is used to produce a specific amino acid sequence . This process begins with the production of an RNA molecule with a sequence matching the gene 's DNA sequence , a process called transcription . 
 This messenger RNA molecule is then used to produce a corresponding amino acid sequence through a process called translation . Each group of three nucleotides in the sequence , called a codon , corresponds either to one of the twenty possible amino acids in a protein or an instruction to end the amino acid sequence ; this correspondence is called the genetic code . The flow of information is unidirectional : information is transferred from nucleotide sequences into the amino acid sequence of proteins , but it never transfers from protein back into the sequence of DNA — a phenomenon Francis Crick called the central dogma of molecular biology . 
 The specific sequence of amino acids results in a unique three @-@ dimensional structure for that protein , and the three @-@ dimensional structures of proteins are related to their functions . Some are simple structural molecules , like the fibers formed by the protein collagen . Proteins can bind to other proteins and simple molecules , sometimes acting as enzymes by facilitating chemical reactions within the bound molecules ( without changing the structure of the protein itself ) . Protein structure is dynamic ; the protein hemoglobin bends into slightly different forms as it facilitates the capture , transport , and release of oxygen molecules within mammalian blood . 
 A single nucleotide difference within DNA can cause a change in the amino acid sequence of a protein . Because protein structures are the result of their amino acid sequences , some changes can dramatically change the properties of a protein by destabilizing the structure or changing the surface of the protein in a way that changes its interaction with other proteins and molecules . For example , sickle @-@ cell anemia is a human genetic disease that results from a single base difference within the coding region for the β @-@ <unk> section of hemoglobin , causing a single amino acid change that changes hemoglobin 's physical properties . Sickle @-@ cell versions of hemoglobin stick to themselves , stacking to form fibers that distort the shape of red blood cells carrying the protein . These sickle @-@ shaped cells no longer flow smoothly through blood vessels , having a tendency to clog or degrade , causing the medical problems associated with this disease . 
 Some DNA sequences are transcribed into RNA but are not translated into protein products — such RNA molecules are called non @-@ coding RNA . In some cases , these products fold into structures which are involved in critical cell functions ( e.g. ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA ) . RNA can also have regulatory effects through hybridization interactions with other RNA molecules ( e.g. microRNA ) . 
 = = = Nature and nurture = = = 
 Although genes contain all the information an organism uses to function , the environment plays an important role in determining the ultimate phenotypes an organism displays . This is the complementary relationship often referred to as " nature and nurture " . The phenotype of an organism depends on the interaction of genes and the environment . An interesting example is the coat coloration of the Siamese cat . In this case , the body temperature of the cat plays the role of the environment . The cat 's genes code for dark hair , thus the hair @-@ producing cells in the cat make cellular proteins resulting in dark hair . But these dark hair @-@ producing proteins are sensitive to temperature ( i.e. have a mutation causing temperature @-@ sensitivity ) and denature in higher @-@ temperature environments , failing to produce dark @-@ hair pigment in areas where the cat has a higher body temperature . In a low @-@ temperature environment , however , the protein 's structure is stable and produces dark @-@ hair pigment normally . The protein remains functional in areas of skin that are colder – such as its legs , ears , tail and face – so the cat has dark @-@ hair at its extremities . 
 Environment plays a major role in effects of the human genetic disease phenylketonuria . The mutation that causes phenylketonuria disrupts the ability of the body to break down the amino acid phenylalanine , causing a toxic build @-@ up of an intermediate molecule that , in turn , causes severe symptoms of progressive mental retardation and seizures . However , if someone with the phenylketonuria mutation follows a strict diet that avoids this amino acid , they remain normal and healthy . 
 A popular method in determining how genes and environment ( " nature and nurture " ) contribute to a phenotype is by studying identical and fraternal twins or siblings of multiple births . Because identical siblings come from the same zygote , they are genetically the same . Fraternal twins are as genetically different from one another as normal siblings . By analyzing statistics on how often a twin of a set has a certain disorder compared to other sets of twins , scientists can determine whether that disorder is caused by genetic or environmental factors ( i.e. whether it has ' nature ' or ' nurture ' causes ) . One famous example is the multiple birth study of the <unk> quadruplets , who were identical quadruplets all diagnosed with schizophrenia . 
 = = = Gene regulation = = = 
 The genome of a given organism contains thousands of genes , but not all these genes need to be active at any given moment . A gene is expressed when it is being transcribed into mRNA and there exist many cellular methods of controlling the expression of genes such that proteins are produced only when needed by the cell . Transcription factors are regulatory proteins that bind to DNA , either promoting or inhibiting the transcription of a gene . Within the genome of Escherichia coli bacteria , for example , there exists a series of genes necessary for the synthesis of the amino acid tryptophan . However , when tryptophan is already available to the cell , these genes for tryptophan synthesis are no longer needed . The presence of tryptophan directly affects the activity of the genes — tryptophan molecules bind to the tryptophan repressor ( a transcription factor ) , changing the repressor 's structure such that the repressor binds to the genes . The tryptophan repressor blocks the transcription and expression of the genes , thereby creating negative feedback regulation of the tryptophan synthesis process . 
 Differences in gene expression are especially clear within multicellular organisms , where cells all contain the same genome but have very different structures and behaviors due to the expression of different sets of genes . All the cells in a multicellular organism derive from a single cell , differentiating into variant cell types in response to external and intercellular signals and gradually establishing different patterns of gene expression to create different behaviors . As no single gene is responsible for the development of structures within multicellular organisms , these patterns arise from the complex interactions between many cells . 
 Within eukaryotes , there exist structural features of chromatin that influence the transcription of genes , often in the form of modifications to DNA and chromatin that are stably inherited by daughter cells . These features are called " epigenetic " because they exist " on top " of the DNA sequence and retain inheritance from one cell generation to the next . Because of epigenetic features , different cell types grown within the same medium can retain very different properties . Although epigenetic features are generally dynamic over the course of development , some , like the phenomenon of <unk> , have multigenerational inheritance and exist as rare exceptions to the general rule of DNA as the basis for inheritance . 
 = = Genetic change = = 
 = = = Mutations = = = 
 During the process of DNA replication , errors occasionally occur in the polymerization of the second strand . These errors , called mutations , can affect the phenotype of an organism , especially if they occur within the protein coding sequence of a gene . Error rates are usually very low — 1 error in every 10 – 100 million bases — due to the " proofreading " ability of DNA polymerases . Processes that increase the rate of changes in DNA are called mutagenic : mutagenic chemicals promote errors in DNA replication , often by interfering with the structure of base @-@ pairing , while UV radiation induces mutations by causing damage to the DNA structure . Chemical damage to DNA occurs naturally as well and cells use DNA repair mechanisms to repair mismatches and breaks . The repair does not , however , always restore the original sequence . 
 In organisms that use chromosomal crossover to exchange DNA and recombine genes , errors in alignment during meiosis can also cause mutations . Errors in crossover are especially likely when similar sequences cause partner chromosomes to adopt a mistaken alignment ; this makes some regions in genomes more prone to mutating in this way . These errors create large structural changes in DNA sequence – duplications , inversions , deletions of entire regions – or the accidental exchange of whole parts of sequences between different chromosomes ( chromosomal translocation ) . 
 = = = Natural selection and evolution = = = 
 Mutations alter an organism 's genotype and occasionally this causes different phenotypes to appear . Most mutations have little effect on an organism 's phenotype , health , or reproductive fitness . Mutations that do have an effect are usually deleterious , but occasionally some can be beneficial . Studies in the fly Drosophila melanogaster suggest that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene , about 70 percent of these mutations will be harmful with the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial . 
 Population genetics studies the distribution of genetic differences within populations and how these distributions change over time . Changes in the frequency of an allele in a population are mainly influenced by natural selection , where a given allele provides a selective or reproductive advantage to the organism , as well as other factors such as mutation , genetic drift , genetic draft , artificial selection and migration . 
 Over many generations , the genomes of organisms can change significantly , resulting in evolution . In the process called adaptation , selection for beneficial mutations can cause a species to evolve into forms better able to survive in their environment . New species are formed through the process of speciation , often caused by geographical separations that prevent populations from exchanging genes with each other . The application of genetic principles to the study of population biology and evolution is known as the " modern synthesis " . 
 By comparing the homology between different species ' genomes , it is possible to calculate the evolutionary distance between them and when they may have diverged . Genetic comparisons are generally considered a more accurate method of characterizing the relatedness between species than the comparison of phenotypic characteristics . The evolutionary distances between species can be used to form evolutionary trees ; these trees represent the common descent and divergence of species over time , although they do not show the transfer of genetic material between unrelated species ( known as horizontal gene transfer and most common in bacteria ) . 
 = = = Model organisms = = = 
 Although geneticists originally studied inheritance in a wide range of organisms , researchers began to specialize in studying the genetics of a particular subset of organisms . The fact that significant research already existed for a given organism would encourage new researchers to choose it for further study , and so eventually a few model organisms became the basis for most genetics research . Common research topics in model organism genetics include the study of gene regulation and the involvement of genes in development and cancer . 
 Organisms were chosen , in part , for convenience — short generation times and easy genetic manipulation made some organisms popular genetics research tools . Widely used model organisms include the gut bacterium Escherichia coli , the plant Arabidopsis thaliana , baker 's yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) , the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , the common fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) , and the common house mouse ( Mus musculus ) . 
 = = = Medicine = = = 
 Medical genetics seeks to understand how genetic variation relates to human health and disease . When searching for an unknown gene that may be involved in a disease , researchers commonly use genetic linkage and genetic pedigree charts to find the location on the genome associated with the disease . At the population level , researchers take advantage of Mendelian randomization to look for locations in the genome that are associated with diseases , a method especially useful for <unk> traits not clearly defined by a single gene . Once a candidate gene is found , further research is often done on the corresponding gene – the orthologous gene – in model organisms . In addition to studying genetic diseases , the increased availability of genotyping methods has led to the field of <unk> : the study of how genotype can affect drug responses . 
 Individuals differ in their inherited tendency to develop cancer , and cancer is a genetic disease . The process of cancer development in the body is a combination of events . Mutations occasionally occur within cells in the body as they divide . Although these mutations will not be inherited by any offspring , they can affect the behavior of cells , sometimes causing them to grow and divide more frequently . There are biological mechanisms that attempt to stop this process ; signals are given to inappropriately dividing cells that should trigger cell death , but sometimes additional mutations occur that cause cells to ignore these messages . An internal process of natural selection occurs within the body and eventually mutations accumulate within cells to promote their own growth , creating a cancerous tumor that grows and invades various tissues of the body . 
 Normally , a cell divides only in response to signals called growth factors and stops growing once in contact with surrounding cells and in response to growth @-@ inhibitory signals . It usually then divides a limited number of times and dies , staying within the epithelium where it is unable to migrate to other organs . To become a cancer cell , a cell has to accumulate mutations in a number of genes ( 3 – 7 ) that allow it to bypass this regulation : it no longer needs growth factors to divide , it continues growing when making contact to neighbor cells , and ignores inhibitory signals , it will keep growing indefinitely and is immortal , it will escape from the epithelium and ultimately may be able to escape from the primary tumor , cross the endothelium of a blood vessel , be transported by the bloodstream and will colonize a new organ , forming deadly metastasis . Although there are some genetic predispositions in a small fraction of cancers , the major fraction is due to a set of new genetic mutations that originally appear and accumulate in one or a small number of cells that will divide to form the tumor and are not transmitted to the progeny ( somatic mutations ) . The most frequent mutations are a loss of function of p53 protein , a tumor suppressor , or in the p53 pathway , and gain of function mutations in the ras proteins , or in other oncogenes . 
 = = = Research methods = = = 
 DNA can be manipulated in the laboratory . Restriction enzymes are commonly used enzymes that cut DNA at specific sequences , producing predictable fragments of DNA . DNA fragments can be visualized through use of gel electrophoresis , which separates fragments according to their length . 
 The use of ligation enzymes allows DNA fragments to be connected . By binding ( " ligating " ) fragments of DNA together from different sources , researchers can create recombinant DNA , the DNA often associated with genetically modified organisms . Recombinant DNA is commonly used in the context of plasmids : short circular DNA molecules with a few genes on them . In the process known as molecular cloning , researchers can amplify the DNA fragments by inserting plasmids into bacteria and then culturing them on plates of agar ( to isolate clones of bacteria cells ) . ( " Cloning " can also refer to the various means of creating cloned ( " clonal " ) organisms . ) 
 DNA can also be amplified using a procedure called the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . By using specific short sequences of DNA , PCR can isolate and exponentially amplify a targeted region of DNA . Because it can amplify from extremely small amounts of DNA , PCR is also often used to detect the presence of specific DNA sequences . 
 = = = DNA sequencing and genomics = = = 
 DNA sequencing , one of the most fundamental technologies developed to study genetics , allows researchers to determine the sequence of nucleotides in DNA fragments . The technique of chain @-@ termination sequencing , developed in 1977 by a team led by Frederick Sanger , is still routinely used to sequence DNA fragments . Using this technology , researchers have been able to study the molecular sequences associated with many human diseases . 
 As sequencing has become less expensive , researchers have sequenced the genomes of many organisms , using a process called genome assembly , which utilizes computational tools to stitch together sequences from many different fragments . These technologies were used to sequence the human genome in the Human Genome Project completed in 2003 . New high @-@ throughput sequencing technologies are dramatically lowering the cost of DNA sequencing , with many researchers hoping to bring the cost of <unk> a human genome down to a thousand dollars . 
 Next generation sequencing ( or high @-@ throughput sequencing ) came about due to the ever @-@ increasing demand for low @-@ cost sequencing . These sequencing technologies allow the production of potentially millions of sequences concurrently . The large amount of sequence data available has created the field of genomics , research that uses computational tools to search for and analyze patterns in the full genomes of organisms . Genomics can also be considered a subfield of bioinformatics , which uses computational approaches to analyze large sets of biological data . A common problem to these fields of research is how to manage and share data that deals with human subject and personally identifiable information . See also genomics data sharing .

 On 19 March 2015 , a leading group of biologists urged a worldwide ban on clinical use of methods , particularly the use of CRISPR and zinc finger , to edit the human genome in a way that can be inherited .

 = 1982 Pacific typhoon season = 
 The 1982 Pacific typhoon season had no official bounds ; it ran year @-@ round in 1982 . On average , most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between May and November . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean . The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean , north of the equator and west of the International Date Line . Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes . 
 Tropical Storms that formed in the entire west Pacific basin were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center . Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA . This can often result in the same storm having two names . 
 During this season , the first tropical cyclone formed on March 16 , and the last one dissipated on December 12 . A total of 29 tropical depressions formed this year in the Western Pacific , of which 25 became tropical storms . 19 storms reached typhoon intensity , of which 2 reached super typhoon strength . Two @-@ thirds of the tropical cyclones formed between July and October . Typhoon Pamela was the longest @-@ lived tropical cyclone of the season . Sixteen of the cyclones struck land during their life cycles , with eight moving through the Philippines . Tropical cyclones accounted for 35 percent of the 1982 rainfall across Hong Kong , their fifth wettest tropical cyclone contribution on record at the time . Nearly half of the deaths during the season were the result of Typhoon Nancy moving through the Philippines and Vietnam in October . 
 = = Seasonal activity = = 
 A total of 28 tropical depressions formed this year in the Western Pacific , of which 26 became tropical storms . 19 storms reached typhoon intensity , of which 2 reached super typhoon strength . Three tropical cyclones formed in March ( most active since 1967 , ) one in May , three in June , four in July , five in August , six in September , four in October , one in November , and one in December . Typhoon Pamela ( Aning ) was the longest @-@ lived tropical cyclone of the season . Sixteen tropical cyclones made landfall , with eight moving through the Philippines , four striking China , three impacting Vietnam , and three crossing Japan . Tropical cyclones accounted for 35 percent of the 1982 rainfall across Hong Kong , their fifth wettest tropical cyclone contribution on record at the time . 
 Tropical Storm Mamie moved across the tropical western Pacific ocean , striking the Philippines and Vietnam during mid to late March . Nelson formed soon after Mamie , becoming the first typhoon of the season which subsequently moved westward through the southern Philippines before dissipating shy of Vietnam in late March . Odessa formed well out to sea , wandering across the western Pacific before dissipating in early April , ending the most active March since 1967 . Pat formed in mid May , approaching the Philippines before becoming an extratropical cyclone offshore Japan late in the month . Ruby wandered around the Marianas in late June , becoming an extratropical cyclone east of Japan . 
 Tess became the first tropical cyclone of the season to form in the South China Sea during late June , weakening before reaching Taiwan in early July . The Japanese Meteorological Agency states that Val was a continuation of Tess , which moved east @-@ northeast from Taiwan to the south of Japan in early July . Skip formed ahead of Tess , moving east @-@ northeast well to the south of Japan in late June and early July . Winona moved west @-@ northwest through the northern Philippines across Hainan Island into southern China before dissipating in mid July . Andy formed south of Guam , moving west @-@ northwest across Taiwan into southern China in late July . Bess formed within the same monsoon trough which spawned Andy , moving generally northwest into Japan early in August . 
 Cecil formed northeast of the Philippines , moving northward offshore Taiwan and eastern China before moving ashore North Korea in mid @-@ August . Dot formed east of Cecil , moving west @-@ northwest into southern Taiwan and southeast China in mid @-@ August . Ellis formed well east of the Philippines in mid @-@ August , recurving northward into southern Japan late in the month . Faye wandered aimlessly between the central Philippines and Taiwan during late August and early September , steered partially by Gordon to its east @-@ northeast . Gordon recurved offshore Japan during late August and early September . 
 Tropical Storm Hope moved through the South China Sea into Vietnam in early September . Irving moved across the central Philippines and Hainan Island before dissipating in southeast China in mid @-@ September . Judy formed in the same monsoon trough which spawned Irving , recurving across central Japan during mid @-@ September . Ken formed northeast of the Philippines in mid @-@ September , recurving across southern Japan in late September . Tropical Storm Lola formed and recurved well east of Asia in mid @-@ September . Tropical Depression 22 was a short lived system which moved northwestward east of the Philippines and south of Japan on September 21 and 22 . Mac was the first super typhoon to form during the season , recurving southeast of Japan in early October . 
 Nancy was a straight @-@ running typhoon which moved steadily westward across the northern Philippines south of Hainan Island into northern Vietnam . Tropical Depression 25 behaved similarly to Tropical Depression 22 , moving northwest well east of the Philippines and south of Japan in mid October . Typhoon Owen meandered well to the southeast of Japan in mid and late October . Pamela moved generally westward across the central Philippines as a typhoon in early December . Roger was the last tropical cyclone of the season , and it moved northward along the northeast side of the Philippines in mid December before dissipating southeast of Taiwan . 
 = = Storms = = 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Mamie ( Akang ) = = = 
 An area of thunderstorms was first spied March 7 near the 150th meridian east and just south of the equator . Over the next several days , the disturbance crossed the equator , moving northward . By March 14 , it was located 190 kilometres ( 120 mi ) east @-@ southeast of Truk . Turning westward , the system became a tropical storm by the afternoon of March 16 . Further intensification was quite slow , and halted upon landfall in Mindanao on March 19 . Extensive property and crop damage , as well as 45 deaths , were attributed to this storm . The cyclone entered the Sulu Sea as a tropical storm , and turned northward as it reached the South China Sea . A turn to the west again occurred , which directed Mamie to a landfall near Nha Trang , Vietnam late on March 24 . Dissipation was complete within a mountainous region on March 25 . 
 = = = Typhoon Nelson ( Bising ) = = = 
 This storm was the second of three early season , low latitude systems to form to the southeast of Guam . Nelson intensified rapidly from a tropical disturbance into a tropical storm . This was due to very strong divergence aloft . Strong low level easterlies and rapid westward movement led to slower development thereafter . After March 22 , forward motion began to slow and intensification resumed . Maximum intensity was reached on March 25 . On March 27 , Nelson moved through the south @-@ central Philippines and rapidly weakened . Fifty @-@ six perished across the Philippines from this typhoon . 
 Slight intensification resumed as the center emerged into the South China Sea . By March 30 , upper level wind shear led to significant weakening , with the low level center becoming exposed and eventually dissipating on April 1 about 445 kilometres ( 277 mi ) east of Nha Trang , Vietnam . 
 = = = Typhoon Odessa = = = 
 An area of disorganized thunderstorms was noted near 2N <unk> on March 26 . Moving northwest due to significant cyclogenesis offshore Japan , a circulation center developed within this convective cluster over the next few days . By the afternoon of March 29 , it had matured into a tropical storm . A mid @-@ level trough extended southwest towards the cyclone . Combined with strong ridging building in north to northwest of the storm , Odessa ceased moving northwest and turned east at around 10 knots ( 19 km / h ) during March 30 and March 31 . As the mid @-@ level trough continued moving east , Odessa turned back to the north , and eventually west @-@ northwest , as ridging built in north of the cyclone . After the change in course to west , intensification resumed , and the system reached typhoon strength in the afternoon of April 2 . As Odessa peaked in strength a weakness in the subtropical ridge lured its convection northeast , shearing the thunderstorms away from the center . Rapid weakening ensued , and the cyclone dissipated on the afternoon of April 4 . 
 The occurrence of this cyclone ended the most active March for tropical cyclone formation in the northwest Pacific ocean since 1967 . Odessa was unique from a climatological standpoint , moving east and west in an area normally known for northward moving tropical cyclones in March . 
 = = = Typhoon Pat ( Klaring ) = = = 
 Pat became the lone tropical cyclone in the western Pacific basin during the two @-@ month interval between Odessa 's dissipation and the formation of Ruby . The disturbance which led to Pat 's formation developed southwest of Guam on May 14 . By May 17 the system had organized sufficiently to become a tropical depression . Moving westward until the afternoon of May 18 , Pat abruptly changed course to the north through a break in the subtropical ridge parallel and close to the Philippines . Rapid intensification ensued , with Pat reaching its maximum intensity late on May 21 . As the cyclone turned to the northeast , vertical wind shear began to weaken the cyclone . Its wind field broadened as it began extratropical transition . By midday on May 23 , Pat had evolved into an extratropical cyclone along a frontal boundary with cool , dry air wrapping into its center . The cyclone became absorbed by a larger system near Japan on May 24 . 
 = = = Typhoon Ruby = = = 
 A blob of thunderstorms was noticed about 600 kilometres ( 370 mi ) southeast of Guam on June 18 . It tracked westward , without significant development until June 20 while passing south of Ulithi Atoll . Steering currents collapsed , and the system drifted between Ulithi and Yap for the next couple of days . By the morning of June 21 , the system had strengthened into a tropical storm . The system drifted north to northwest , then northeast towards Guam . Ruby waited to detach from the monsoon trough before further strengthening was realized on June 23 . Steady intensification ensued , and the cyclone accelerated northward , becoming a typhoon on the afternoon of June 24 . Ruby became an extratropical cyclone on June 27 , occluding and becoming nearly stationary east of Hokkaidō for several days . Two vessels with a collective crew of 42 people became stranded off the coast of Honshu during the typhoon . The 19 crew of the No. 10 Soichi @-@ Maru were rescued while the 23 members on the No. 8 <unk> @-@ Maru remained missing . 
 Heavy rains fell near the path of this cyclone . Yap Island received 594 @.@ 4 millimetres ( 23 @.@ 40 in ) of rainfall . Koror , within Palau , recorded 277 millimetres ( 10 @.@ 9 in ) of rain . Anderson Air Force Base on Guam measured 184 @.@ 2 millimetres ( 7 @.@ 25 in ) of rain . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Tess – Val ( Deling ) = = = 
 The initial disturbance formed in the South China Sea in late June as a monsoon depression . A weak low @-@ level circulation formed on June 27 , but convection remained far from the center . By June 29 , convection had become nearer to the center and it qualified as a tropical depression . No additional development was seen through June 30 as the system moved northward . The cyclone turned east @-@ northeast , paralleling the coast of China . When tropical storm force winds were observed in Hong Kong , the cyclone was upgraded to a tropical storm late on June 30 . Winds gusted to 53 knots ( 98 km / h ) at Tate 's Cairn , and 279 @.@ 2 millimetres ( 10 @.@ 99 in ) of rain fell from the cyclone . Quickly weakening back to a tropical depression early on July 1 , Tess dissipated as it approached the Formosa Strait . 
 The Japanese Meteorological Agency states that Val was a continuation of Tess , which moved east @-@ northeast from Taiwan to the south of Japan in early July . Its circulation center moved along a frontal @-@ like band east of Taiwan on July 1 . Isolated convection was seen near the low pressure center at the time . When deeper convection formed on July 3 , Val was deemed to become a tropical storm . In the Joint Typhoon Warning Center write @-@ up , it was considered a subtropical cyclone after the fact . The cyclone accelerated northeast , and by July 4 whatever central convection it once had was gone and it was considered an extratropical cyclone late that morning . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Skip = = = 
 Skip formed from a tropical disturbance near 20N <unk> on June 26 . A sharp trough connected Ruby with Skip at this time , which was undergoing frontogenesis as Ruby became extratropical . By late morning on June 30 , Skip was of tropical storm strength accelerating up the frontal boundary to its northeast with limited convection near its center , and was considered by the Joint Typhoon Warning center as a subtropical cyclone in its annual report . By July 2 , what limited convection was near the center of Skip disappeared , and it became an extratropical cyclone . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Winona ( Emang ) = = = 
 Moderate to strong northeasterly vertical wind shear hampered the development of this tropical cyclone throughout its life cycle . Between July 10 and July 12 , its predecessor disturbance marched westward with little development . Observations from Yap late on July 12 verified the existence of a developing low @-@ level center , and it was upgraded to a tropical depression at this time . Moving west @-@ northwest along the southern periphery of the subtropical ridge , Winona made landfall on Luzon during the afternoon of July 15 . Rainfall at Clark Air Force Base totaled 81 @.@ 5 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 21 in ) . Damage to Clark Air Force Base totalled US $ 250 @,@ 000 ( 1982 dollars ) . Two died and 5000 were left homeless in the Philippines were left homeless by the ensuing flood . <unk> in the South China Sea , the cyclone reached its peak intensity on the afternoon of July 16 . Thereafter , wind shear took its toll and the cyclone began to weaken . The cyclone revealed an exposed low @-@ level center on July 17 , and the system dissipated before reaching the China / Vietnam coast on July 18 . Winds gusted to 50 knots ( 93 km / h ) at Tate 's Cairn .

 = = = Typhoon Andy ( Iliang ) = = = 
 The system formed on the northern edge of the monsoon trough south of Guam . Prior to its formation , low @-@ level westerlies were firmly in place south of the 10th parallel eastward to the International Date Line . On July 20 , the monsoon trough segmented , with the middle segment becoming Andy ( Bess formed from the eastern segment ) . On July 22 , the area south of Guam showed increasing thunderstorm activity and organization . That morning , it became a tropical storm . Andy 's center briefly became exposed on July 23 before drifting back under the thunderstorm activity . After looping south of Guam , the cyclone moved northwest and strengthened . Andy turned westward near the 18th parallel on July 25 as the ridge to its northeast strengthened . The system became a strong typhoon for a prolonged period on July 28 and July 29 before striking southern Taiwan . 
 Heavy rains fell over Hong Kong , where 205 @.@ 3 millimetres ( 8 @.@ 08 in ) fell at Tate 's Cairn . A deluge fell across eastern Taiwan , where flood @-@ related damage was concentrated . Continuing westward through the Formosa Strait , the storm made its final landfall and dissipated in southeast China on July 30 . Andy led to 13 deaths across Taiwan . 
 = = = Super Typhoon Bess = = = 
 The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression near Kwajalein on July 22 . It headed northwestward , becoming a tropical storm on July 23 and a typhoon on July 24 . A shortwave trough forced Bess southwestward where it remained a 90 knots ( 170 km / h ) typhoon . It looped and stalled until another shortwave trough brought the typhoon to the northwest . Bess rapidly intensified to a 140 knots ( 260 km / h ) super typhoon , and weakened steadily as it turned more northward . Bess crossed the Japanese coast on August 1 as a minimal typhoon , and was absorbed by a low pressure center in the Sea of Japan on August 2 . Bess caused torrential mudslides in Japan , causing extensive damage and 59 casualties . The name Bess was retired after this season . 
 = = = Typhoon Cecil ( Loleng ) = = = 
 A low @-@ level circulation north of Chuuk organized into a tropical depression on August 4 . After moving quickly westward , the depression stalled on August 5 and August 6 , allowing it to strengthen into a tropical storm and mature into a typhoon on August 7 . The typhoon turned northward , rapidly intensifying to maximum sustained winds of 125 knots ( 232 km / h ) on August 8 while east of Taiwan . Cooler water temperatures and vertical wind shear weakened Cecil as it continued northward , and as a 35 knots ( 65 km / h ) tropical storm , it hit North Korea on August 14 . Though significantly weakened , it brought a great deal of precipitation , causing severe flooding killing 54 and leading to millions of dollars in damage . 
 = = = Typhoon Dot ( Miding ) = = = 
 A weak circulation formed near Kwajalein on August 5 . Over the next couple days , the low moved northwest . Slowly developing , it became a tropical depression on the morning of August 9 , and a tropical storm by evening . Becoming a typhoon on August 11 , Dot moved westward under the base of the subtropical ridge . By August 12 , Cecil 's outflow began to impact Dot , and weakening ensued , sending Dot back to the tropical storm stage . As Cecil 's influence began to lessen on August 13 , Dot stopped weakening . As a tropical storm , Dot rapidly passed over Taiwan on August 15 , rapidly weakening over the mountainous island . As a weak tropical storm , Dot dissipated after making landfall in eastern China . As of 2005 , Dot is the eighth wettest known typhoon for Hong Kong . It dropped 491 @.@ 7 millimetres ( 19 @.@ 36 in ) of rainfall upon the region . 
 = = = Typhoon Ellis ( Oyang ) = = = 
 A disturbance appeared in the monsoon trough south of Ponape on August 15 . Modest development ensued as it moved west @-@ northwest , and the system was classified as a tropical depression on the morning of August 19 , and a tropical storm that night . Turning to the northwest , Ellis became a typhoon on the morning of August 21 , and ultimately a major typhoon on August 22 . A mid @-@ level trough moving into the Yellow Sea continued Ellis ' recurvature . Moving east of Okinawa on August 25 , the cyclone headed northward towards Japan . Moving by Kyūshū , Shikoku , and Honshū , the cyclone degenerated into a tropical storm . Heavy rains up to 711 millimetres ( 28 @.@ 0 in ) inundated southwest Japan , bringing life to a standstill for the region . Five perished across Japan . Moving into the Sea of Japan on August 27 , Ellis evolved into an extratropical cyclone which turned back to the northwest , ending up about 220 kilometres ( 140 mi ) west of Vladivostok . 
 = = = Typhoon Faye ( Norming ) = = = 
 On August 16 , a weak tropical disturbance was moving towards the southern Philippines . Its low @-@ level circulation was easily identified , since it was exposed , away from any deep convection . The system organized in the South China Sea , becoming a tropical depression by midday on August 21 , a tropical storm that evening , and a typhoon on the night of August 22 . A small cyclone , Faye moved northward on August 24 due to the weakening of a warm core ridge over China . By that evening , it reached its maximum intensity . On the morning of August 25 , the cyclone strikes Luzon and rapidly weakens . Wallace Air Station reported gusts to 100 knots ( 190 km / h ) during the passage of Faye . Thirty @-@ two perished in the Philippines due to Faye . 
 Recurving to the northeast , Faye continued weakening due to vertical wind shear from Ellis , with dissipation as a tropical cyclone occurring on the afternoon of August 27 . As a tropical depression , Faye moved east @-@ northeast for a while before stalling between a mid @-@ level trough and newly developed Tropical Storm Gordon . As Ellis retreated to the north , Faye began to reorganize with tropical storm status reattained on the morning of August 28 and typhoon status reached that night . Weakening began anew due to outflow from Typhoon Gordon , and the system became a tropical storm once more on the early morning of August 30 . By August 31 , a building ridge to Faye 's north led to a southwest motion as the system continued to weaken . The cyclone became a tropical depression that evening , and drifted west for the next few days as an exposed low level circulation . The depression dissipated in the South China Sea on the afternoon of September 3 . 
 = = = Typhoon Gordon = = = 
 The initial disturbance that led to Gordon 's formation developed within the monsoon trough just west of the International Date Line . A surface circulation developed in associated with this convection on August 25 near 8N <unk> . While upper ridging aloft existed , it was not until the following day that it developed directly over this disturbance . Moving northwest , rapid development began early on August 27 , with tropical depression status achieved that morning and tropical storm intensity reached that afternoon . Gordon became a typhoon on the morning of August 28 . By early on August 30 , the cyclone reached its maximum intensity . A building ridge to its north directed Gordon westward until September 3 , when its motion slowed . A shortwave trough deepened to its northwest , and the cyclone turned northward in response . By September 4 , the cyclone was accelerating east to northeast , passing about 480 kilometres ( 300 mi ) southeast of Tokyo , and the storm became extratropical early on the afternoon of September 5 . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Hope ( Pasing ) = = = 
 A monsoon depression formed over the South China Sea on September 3 . It deepened rapidly , becoming a tropical storm late on September 4 . Moving quickly westward , it struck the coast of Vietnam south of Da Nang , then moved into the mountains of Laos and Vietnam as it rapidly dissipated . Significant flooding caused the evacuation of several thousand people and damaged the rice crop . 
 = = = Typhoon Irving ( <unk> ) = = = 
 An active monsoon trough was south of Guam . By late on September 4 , a surface low was apparent near <unk> 130E . Late the next day , it became a tropical depression while moving generally to the west . By the next morning , it had strengthened into a tropical storm . Late on September 8 , the cyclone struck the southern tip of Luzon as a strong tropical storm . Moving through an inland sea route though the archipelago , Irving slightly weakened before turning northwest into the South China Sea . Irving became a compact typhoon while strengthening over open waters . Weakening back into a tropical storm due to land interaction with Hai @-@ nan and mainland China , the system made landfall about 205 kilometres ( 127 mi ) northeast of Hanoi , then rapidly dissipated as it moved inland . 
 Across the Philippines , Irving battered a dozen provinces in the southern section of Luzon , toppling trees and ripping off rooftops . Moreover , the storm also uprooted trees , downed power and telephone lines , triggered landslides and forced the cancellation of several domestic airline flights on Thursday . Schools were closed . Irving wrecked 7 @,@ 890 houses in Albay and Sorsogon provinces alone . As a result , 23 @,@ 101 families , or about 138 @,@ 500 people were listed as homeless . A total of 37 perished and three others were rendered as missing . Most of the casualties occurred when people were downed by falling trees or falling debris . Two people perished due to a landslide southeast of Manila . Moreover , 15 people died in the Batangas City , where electrical and water supplies was cut for two days . Twenty @-@ three were wounded . However , damage to crops , especially rice , was minor . Damage in the Philippines totaled to $ 13 million . The nations ' president order for the release of $ 294 @,@ 000 in aid . Upon making landfall in China , winds gusted to 53 knots ( 98 km / h ) at Lei Yue Mun in Hong Kong . In all , 49 died due to Irving . 
 = = = Typhoon Judy ( Susang ) = = = 
 Forming in tandem with Irving , Judy formed east of the Philippines as a tropical disturbance on September 4 . In contrast to Irving , Judy 's intensification was more rapid , becoming a tropical depression early on September 6 , a tropical storm later that morning , and a typhoon on September 8 while tracking northwestward . On September 9 , Judy appears to have ingested dry air from a nearly tropical upper tropospheric cyclone , as its central eye feature expanded significantly . A mid @-@ latitude trough south of Korea swept Judy more northward , ultimately accelerating the storm towards Japan on September 11 . When the 70 knots ( 130 km / h ) Typhoon Judy hit southeastern Japan on September 12 , its torrential rains left 25 dead and causing moderate damage . Extratropical transition had begun around that time , and Judy became an extratropical cyclone on September 13 . 
 = = = Typhoon Ken ( Tering ) = = = 
 Forming along the western end of the monsoon trough in the Philippine Sea , the convective disturbance was first noted on September 14 . By the afternoon of September 16 , the system had organized into a tropical depression , and by that night a tropical storm . As a compact system , rapid intensification continued , with Ken becoming a typhoon on the evening of September 17 and a major typhoon on September 18 . The cyclone up to this point had a history of progressing slowly west @-@ northwest , but Ken eventually stalled on September 20 and became a larger cyclone , possibly due to the ingestion of some cooler , drier air from its periphery . As a mid @-@ latitude trough to its north deepened , Ken took off to the northeast towards Okinawa . On September 23 , Ken brought significant rains to the island when 282 millimetres ( 11 @.@ 1 in ) were measured at Kadena . Weakening ensued thereafter due to interaction with the main belt of the Westerlies . Ken made landfall upon Shikoku early on September 25 , and moved onward into the Sea of Japan where it evolved into an extratropical cyclone . The fourth typhoon of the season to strike Japan , Ken brought winds as high as 114 knots ( 211 km / h ) and rainfall of 221 millimetres ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) within a six @-@ hour period to Shikoku . Resultant mudslides damaged thousands of homes , and five people died . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Lola = = = 
 Forming in proximity to the tropical upper tropospheric trough ( TUTT ) , its initial disturbance was first spotted as a weak band of convection near the International Dateline in the subtropics on September 13 . Slowly developing , a low pressure system was spotted with the thunderstorm activity on the morning of September 15 . Becoming a tropical storm the following afternoon , Lola recurved around the western periphery of the subtropical ridge . The cyclone accelerated northeast on September 17 , and by the morning of September 19 , Lola had become an extratropical cyclone along the frontal zone which swept it out of the subtropics . 
 = = = Tropical Depression 22W = = = 
 A short lived system , this cyclone followed in the wake of Ken . In fact , Ken 's outflow kept the thunderstorm activity significantly removed from the depression 's low level center for its entire existence . Moving northwest , numerous ship reports of 30 knots ( 56 km / h ) winds led to the indication of this depression during the afternoon of September 21 . The cyclone could not develop into a deep system due to the persistent wind shear as it began to round the western periphery of the subtropical ridge . By the afternoon of September 22 , the cyclone weakened into a low pressure area . This low developed into a small extratropical cyclone when it linked up with a frontal boundary southeast of Japan on September 24 . 
 = = = Super Typhoon Mac ( Uding ) = = = 
 A persistent surface circulation developed on September 28 east of Ponape . On October 1 , the convection began to organize as the upper level environment improved and the system became a tropical depression that night . Moving west @-@ northwest , Mac passed nearby Guam as a strong tropical storm on the morning of October 3 . Heavy rains and high winds in the southern part of the island led to US $ 1 @.@ 5 million ( 1982 dollars ) in damage . Continuing to intensify rapidly , Mac soon became a typhoon , and by October 5 had become a super typhoon . Recurving northwest , the storm travelled into a weakness in the subtropical ridge , accelerating north @-@ northeast as it passed the ridge axis by October 6 . Acceleration into the main belt of the Westerlies continued while the cyclone slowly weakened , and Mac evolved into a typhoon @-@ strength extratropical cyclone on the afternoon of October 9 . 
 = = = Typhoon Nancy ( Weling ) = = = 
 Typhoon Nancy , which developed on October 10 , hit eastern Luzon on October 14 . Its winds were reduced to tropical storm strength , but Nancy re @-@ intensified to an 80 knots ( 150 km / h ) typhoon over the South China Sea . It hit northern Vietnam on the October 18 , and dissipated shortly thereafter . The heavy rains accompanied by the system caused 309 fatalities and over US $ 46 million in damage ( 1982 dollars ) . 
 = = = Tropical Depression 25W ( Yaning ) = = = 
 A weak circulation formed near 18N <unk> on October 14 . Moving westward , it developed into a tropical depression on the morning of October 15 . Convection near the center soon weakened , and it became an exposed low level swirl on October 16 . Progressing northwest , this low level circulation maintained its identity for another couple days . On October 18 , some convective bands returned to the system . Early on October 19 , the circulation became involved with the developing Typhoon Owen , and was absorbed . 
 = = = Typhoon Owen = = = 
 The last cyclone of an active 14 week period , Owen developed from a disturbance east of Kwajalein on October 13 . Slow development ensued as it moved west @-@ northwest , and by early October 16 it achieved tropical depression status . Northerly vertical wind shear tilted the system to the south with height , and slowed development . By October 19 , Owen became a typhoon as it slowed and turned more to the north . As it picked up forward speed during recurvature , it reached its peak intensity during the afternoon of October 20 . Thereafter , the system began to shear from the south , its wind field expanded , and extratropical transition had begun . Owen became an extratropical cyclone on the morning of October 22 . The system then was blocked from fully recurving into the Westerlies , and turned to the southeast and south . Convection increased south of the center on October 23 , and Owen became a tropical cyclone once more with active central convection on October 24 . The system moved eastward as a tropical storm for the next day . By October 25 , Owen turned back to the north and began to lose its thunderstorm activity once more . Weakening back into a tropical depression , Owen eventually dissipated in the warm sector of an approaching extratropical cyclone late on October 27 after tracking over 6 @,@ 600 kilometres ( 4 @,@ 100 mi ) . 
 = = = Typhoon Pamela ( Aning ) = = = 
 On November 21 , an area of convection west of the International Date Line organized into Tropical Disturbance . It looped , then tracked to the west where it strengthened into Tropical <unk> 27W on November 23 , In the next day it was named Tropical Storm Pamela on November 24 . It continued west @-@ northwestward , reaching typhoon intensity on the 26th . Pamela reached a peak of 100 knots ( 190 km / h ) winds as it crossed the Marshall Islands , and as it continued westward , residents of Guam were afraid of the devastating Super Typhoon Pamela of 1976 . It approached the island as a weakened tropical storm on December 1 , but only brought minor winds and damage . Pamela looped to the southwest on the 4th , strengthened to a typhoon but weakened back to a tropical storm . It restrengthened to a typhoon just before hitting the Philippines on the 7th . The storm dissipated on the 9th , after causing moderate to extensive damage to the islands of the West Pacific . 
 Its unusual path and the time of year was very nearly repeated by Typhoon Manny in the 1993 Pacific typhoon season . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Roger ( Bidang ) = = = 
 Following quickly behind Pamela , this system was slow to initially organize . A large area of thunderstorm activity was spotted on the afternoon of December 3 about 2 @,@ 200 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 400 mi ) southeast of Pamela . The convective system moved west @-@ northwest at 10 knots , shadowing Pamela . Upper level outflow from Pamela was leading to moderate to strong vertical wind shear over the disturbance , explaining its slow development . Early on December 7 , both Pamela 's and Roger 's centers were as close as 1 @,@ 110 kilometres ( 690 mi ) from each other . Vertical wind shear finally lessened as Pamela weakened over the Philippines , allowing Roger to rapidly develop into a tropical storm late on December 8 and a typhoon on the morning of December 10 . Moving northwest along the coast of the Philippines , Roger weakened back into a tropical storm . Vertical wind shear increased again , which combined with land interaction quickly weakened the tropical cyclone . By early afternoon on December 10 , the cyclone became ill @-@ defined and no longer qualified as a tropical cyclone . Moving northeast away from the Philippines , Roger 's remains were absorbed into an approaching frontal zone on December 12 .

 = Batik = 
 Batik ( Javanese pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ; Indonesian : [ <unk> ] ) is a technique of wax @-@ resist dyeing applied to whole cloth , or cloth made using this technique . Batik is made either by drawing dots and lines of the resist with a spouted tool called a canting ( IPA : [ ʈ ͡ <unk> ] , also spelled tjanting ) , or by printing the resist with a copper stamp called a cap ( IPA : [ ʈ ͡ <unk> ] , also spelled <unk> ) . The applied wax resists dyes and therefore allows the artisan to colour selectively by soaking the cloth in one colour , removing the wax with boiling water , and repeating if multiple colours are desired . 
 A tradition of making batik is found in various countries , including Indonesia , Malaysia , Singapore , India , Bangladesh , Sri Lanka , Philippines and Nigeria ; the batik of Indonesia , however , is the best @-@ known . Indonesian batik made in the island of Java has a long history of acculturation , with diverse patterns influenced by a variety of cultures , and is the most developed in terms of pattern , technique , and the quality of workmanship . On October 2009 , UNESCO designated Indonesian batik as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The word batik is Javanese in origin . It may either come from the Javanese word amba ( ' to write ' ) and <unk> ( ' dot ' ) , or may derive from a hypothetical Proto @-@ Austronesian root * <unk> ( ' to tattoo ' ) . The word is first recorded in English in the Encyclopædia Britannica of 1880 , in which it is spelled <unk> . It is attested in the Indonesian Archipelago during the Dutch colonial period in various forms : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and batik . 
 = = History = = 
 Wax resist dyeing of fabric is an ancient art form . It already existed in Egypt in the 4th century BC , where it was used to wrap mummies ; linen was soaked in wax , and scratched using a stylus . In Asia , the technique was practised in China during the Tang Dynasty ( 618 @-@ 907 AD ) , and in India and Japan during the Nara Period ( 645 @-@ 794 AD ) . In Africa it was originally practised by the Yoruba tribe in Nigeria , <unk> and Wolof in Senegal . These African version however , uses cassava starch or rice paste , or mud as a resist instead of beeswax . 
 The art of batik is most highly developed in the island of Java in Indonesia . In Java , all the materials for the process are readily available — cotton and beeswax and plants from which different vegetable dyes are made . Indonesian batik predates written records : G. P. Rouffaer argues that the technique might have been introduced during the 6th or 7th century from India or Sri Lanka . On the other hand , the Dutch archaeologist <unk> Brandes and the Indonesian archaeologist F.A. <unk> believe Indonesian batik is a native tradition , since another regions in Indonesia such as Toraja , Flores , Halmahera , and Papua , which were not directly influenced by Hinduism , have an age @-@ old tradition of batik making . 
 Rouffaer reported that the <unk> pattern was already known by the 12th century in Kediri , East Java . He concluded that this delicate pattern could be created only by using the canting , an etching tool that holds a small reservoir of hot wax , and proposed that the canting was invented in Java around that time . The carving details of clothes worn by East Javanese Prajnaparamita statues from around the 13th century show intricate floral patterns within rounded margins , similar to today 's traditional Javanese <unk> or <unk> batik motif . The motif is thought to represent the lotus , a sacred flower in Hindu @-@ Buddhist beliefs . This evidence suggests that intricate batik fabric patterns applied with the canting existed in 13th @-@ century Java or even earlier . 
 In Europe , the technique was described for the first time in the History of Java , published in London in 1817 by Stamford Raffles , who had been a British governor for the island . In 1873 the Dutch merchant Van Rijckevorsel gave the pieces he collected during a trip to Indonesia to the ethnographic museum in Rotterdam . Today the Tropenmuseum houses the biggest collection of Indonesian batik in the Netherlands . The Dutch and Chinese colonists were active in developing batik , particularly coastal batik , in the late colonial era . They introduced new patterns as well as the use of the cap ( copper block stamps ) to mass @-@ produce batiks . Displayed at the Exposition Universelle at Paris in 1900 , the Indonesian batik impressed the public and artists . 
 In the 1920s , Javanese batik makers migrating to Malaya ( now Malaysia ) introduced the use of wax and copper blocks to its east coast . 
 In Subsaharan Africa , Javanese batik was introduced in the 19th century by Dutch and English traders . The local people there adapted the Javanese batik , making larger motifs with thicker lines and more colours . In the 1970s , batik was introduced to Australia , where aboriginal artists at Erna Bella have developed it as their own craft . 
 = = Technique = = 
 Firstly , a cloth is washed , soaked and beaten with a large mallet . Patterns are drawn with pencil and later redrawn using hot wax , usually made from a mixture of paraffin or bees wax , sometimes mixed with plant resins , which functions as a dye @-@ resist . The wax can be applied with a variety of tools . A pen @-@ like instrument called a canting ( IPA : [ <unk> ] , sometimes spelled with old Dutch orthography tjanting ) is the most common . A tjanting is made from a small copper reservoir with a spout on a wooden handle . The reservoir holds the resist which flows through the spout , creating dots and lines as it moves . For larger patterns , a stiff brush may be used . Alternatively , a copper block stamp called a cap ( IPA : [ <unk> ] ; old spelling <unk> ) is used to cover large areas more efficiently . 
 After the cloth is dry , the resist is removed by boiling or scraping the cloth . The areas treated with resist keep their original colour ; when the resist is removed the contrast between the dyed and undyed areas forms the pattern . This process is repeated as many times as the number of colours desired . 
 The most traditional type of batik , called batik <unk> ( written batik ) , is drawn using only the canting . The cloth need to be drawn on both sides and dipped in a dye bath three to four times . The whole process may take up to a year ; it yields considerably finer patterns than stamped batik . 
 = = Culture = = 
 = = = Indonesia = = = 
 Many Indonesian batik patterns are symbolic . Infants are carried in batik slings decorated with symbols designed to bring the child luck , and certain batik designs are reserved for brides and bridegrooms , as well as their families . Some designs are reserved for royalties , and even banned to be worn by commoners . Consequently , a person 's rank could be determined by the pattern of the batik he or she wore . Further study to the geometry of symbolism in Indonesian batik showed the applicability of fractal geometry in traditional designs . 
 Batik garments play a central role in certain Javanese rituals , such as the ceremonial casting of royal batik into a volcano . In the Javanese <unk> <unk> ceremony , the mother @-@ to @-@ be is wrapped in seven layers of batik , wishing her good things . Batik is also prominent in the <unk> <unk> ceremony when a child touches the earth for the first time . 
 In October 2009 , UNESCO designated Indonesian batik as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity . As part of the acknowledgment , UNESCO insisted that Indonesia preserve its heritage . 
 = = = = Popularity = = = = 
 The popularity of batik in Indonesia has varied . Historically , it was essential for ceremonial costumes and it was worn as part of a <unk> dress , commonly worn every day . The use of batik was already recorded in the 12th century , and the textile has become a strong source of identity for Indonesians crossing religious , racial and cultural boundaries . 
 The batik industry of Java flourished from the late 1800s to early 1900s , but declined during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia . It further declined after the Indonesian independence , as people chose western clothes , decimating the batik industry . However , batik has somewhat revived at the turn of the 21st century , through the efforts of Indonesian fashion designers to innovate batik by incorporating new colours , fabrics , and patterns . Batik has become a fashion item for many Indonesians , and may be seen on shirts , dresses , or scarves for casual wear ; it is a preferred replacement for jacket @-@ and @-@ tie at certain receptions . Traditional batik sarongs are still used in many occasions . 
 After the UNESCO recognition for Indonesian batik on 2 October 2009 , the Indonesian administration asked Indonesians to wear batik on Fridays , and wearing batik every Friday has been encouraged in government offices and private companies ever since . 2 October is also celebrated as National Batik Day in Indonesia . Batik had helped improve the small business local economy , batik sales in Indonesia had reached Rp 3 @.@ 9 trillion ( US $ 436 @.@ 8 million ) in 2010 , an increase from Rp 2 @.@ 5 trillion in 2006 . The value of batik exports , meanwhile , increased from $ 14 @.@ 3 million in 2006 to $ 22 @.@ 3 million in 2010 . 
 Batik is also popular in the neighbouring countries of Singapore and Malaysia . It is produced in Malaysia with similar , but not identical , methods to those used in Indonesia . Prior to UNESCO 's recognition and following the 2009 <unk> controversy , Indonesia and Malaysia disputed the ownership of batik culture . However , Dr Fiona Kerlogue of the Horniman museum argued that the Malaysian printed wax textiles , made for about a century , were quite a different tradition from the " very fine " traditional Indonesian batiks produced for many centuries . 
 Batik is featured in the national airline uniforms of the three countries , represented by batik prints worn by flight attendants of Singapore Airlines , Garuda Indonesia and Malaysian Airlines . The female uniform of Garuda Indonesia flight attendants is a modern interpretation of the Kartini style <unk> with <unk> <unk> motifs . 
 = = = = Terminology = = = = 
 Batik is traditionally sold in 2 @.@ 25 @-@ metre lengths used for kain <unk> or sarong . It is worn by wrapping it around the hip , or made into a hat known as <unk> . The cloth can be filled continuously with a single pattern or divided into several sections . 
 Certain patterns are only used in certain sections of the cloth . For example , a row of isosceles triangles , forming the <unk> motif , as well as diagonal floral motifs called <unk> , are commonly used for the head . However , <unk> and <unk> are occasionally found in the body . Other motifs such as <unk> ( flower bouquet ) and birds are commonly used in either the head or the body . 
 The head is a rectangular section of the cloth which is worn at the front . The head section can be at the middle of the cloth , or placed at one or both ends . The <unk> inside of the head can be used to determine whether the cloth is kain <unk> or sarong . 
 The body is the main part of the cloth , and is filled with a wide variety of patterns . The body can be divided into two alternating patterns and colours called <unk> @-@ sore ( ' dawn @-@ dusk ' ) . Brighter pattern are shown during the day , while darker pattern are shown in the evening . The alternating colours give the impression of two batik sets . 
 Margins are often plain , but floral and lace @-@ like patterns , as well as wavy lines described as a dragon , are common in the area beside <unk> . 
 = = = = Types = = = = 
 As each region has its own traditional pattern , batiks are commonly distinguished by the region they originated in , such as batik Solo , batik Pekalongan , and batik Madura . Batiks from Java can be distinguished by their general pattern and colours into batik <unk> ( inland batik ) or batik <unk> ( coastal batik ) . Batiks which do not fall neatly into one of these two categories are only referred to by their region . A mapping of batik designs from all places in Indonesia depicts the similarities and reflects cultural assimilation within batik designs . 
 = = = = = Javanese Batik = = = = = 
 = = = = = = Inland Batik = = = = = = 
 Inland batik or batik kraton ( Javanese court batik ) is the oldest form of batik tradition known in Java . Inland batik has earthy colour such as black , indigo , brown , and sogan ( brown @-@ yellow colour made from the tree <unk> <unk> ) , sometimes against a white background , with symbolic patterns that are mostly free from outside influence . Certain patterns are reserved for royalty , while other are worn on specific occasions . At a Javanese wedding for example , the bride wears specific patterns at each stage of the ceremony . Noted inland batiks are produced in Solo and <unk> , cities traditionally regarded as the centre of Javanese culture . Batik Solo typically has sogan background and is preserved by the <unk> and Mangkunegaran Court . Batik Jogja typically has white background and is preserved by the Yogyakarta Sultanate and <unk> Court . 
 = = = = = = Coastal Batik = = = = = = 
 Coastal batik is produced in several areas of northern Java and Madura . In contrast to inland batik , coastal batiks have vibrant colours and patterns inspired by a wide range of cultures as a consequence of maritime trading . Recurring motifs include European flower bouquets , Chinese phoenix , and Persian peacocks . Noted coastal batiks are produced in Pekalongan , Cirebon , <unk> , <unk> , and Madura . Pekalongan has the most active batik industry . 
 A notable sub @-@ type of coastal batik called Jawa Hokokai is not attributed to a particular region . During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia in early 1940 , the batik industry greatly declined due to material shortages . The workshops funded by the Japanese however were able to produce extremely fine batiks called Jawa Hokokai . Common motifs of Hokokai includes Japanese cherry blossoms , butterflies , and chrysanthemums . 
 Another coastal batik called tiga <unk> ( batik of three lands ) is attributed to three regions : <unk> , Pekalongan , and Solo , where the batik would be dipped in red , blue , and sogan dyes respectively . As of 1980 , batik tiga <unk> was only produced in one city . 
 = = = = = Sundanese Batik = = = = = 
 Sundanese or Priangan Batik is the term for batik from the Priangan region of West Java and Banten . Although Priangan batiks can use a wide range of colours , a preference for indigo is seen in some of its variants . Natural indigo dye made from Indigofera is among the oldest known dyes in Java , and its local name <unk> has lent its name to the Citarum river and the <unk> kingdom , which suggests that ancient West Java was once a major producer of natural indigo . Noted Priangan batik is produced in <unk> , Garut , and Tasikmalaya . Other traditions include Batik Kuningan influenced by batik Cirebon , batik Banten that developed quite independently , and an older tradition of batik Baduy . 
 Batik Banten employs bright pastel colours and represents a revival of a lost art from the Sultanate of Banten , rediscovered through archaeological work during 2002 – 2004 . Twelve motifs from locations such as <unk> and several other places have been identified . 
 Batik Baduy only employs indigo colour in shades ranged from bluish black to deep blue . It is traditionally worn as <unk> , a type of Sundanese <unk> similar to Balinese <unk> , by Outer Baduy people of <unk> Regency , Banten .

 Trade relations between the Melayu Kingdom in Jambi and Javanese coastal cities have thrived since the 13th century . Therefore , coastal batik from northern Java probably influenced Jambi . In 1875 , Haji <unk> from Central Java revived the declining batik industry in Jambi . The village of <unk> Laut in <unk> district is known for producing batik Jambi . Batik Jambi , as well as Javanese batik , influenced the Malaysian batik . 
 The Minangkabau people also produce batik called <unk> tanah <unk> ( clay batik ) , which use clay as dye for the fabric . The fabric is immersed in clay for more than 1 day and later designed with motifs of animal and flora . The Batik from Bengkulu , a city on west coast of Sumatra , is called Batik <unk> , which literary means " batik with letters " as they draw inspiration from Arabic calligraphy . 
 = = = = = Balinese Batik = = = = = 
 Batik making in the island of Bali is relatively new , but a fast @-@ growing industry . Many patterns are inspired by local designs , which are favoured by the local Balinese and domestic tourists . Objects from nature such as frangipani and hibiscus flowers , birds or fishes , and daily activities such as Balinese dancer and <unk> processions or religious and mythological creatures such as <unk> , kala and winged lion are common . Modern batik artists express themselves freely in a wide range of subjects . 
 Contemporary batik is not limited to traditional or ritual wearing in Bali . Some designers promote batik Bali as elegant fabric that can be used to make casual or formal cloth . Using high class batik , like hand made batik <unk> , can show social status . 
 = = = Malaysia = = = 
 Batik was mentioned in the 17th century Malay Annals . The legend goes when <unk> Hang Nadim was ordered by Malacca King , Sultan Mahmud , to sail to India to buy 140 pieces of <unk> cloth ( batik ) with 40 types of flowers depicted on each . Unable to find any that fulfilled the requirements explained to him , he made up his own . On his return unfortunately his ship sank and he only managed to bring four pieces , earning displeasure from the Sultan . 
 The method of Malaysian batik making is different from those of Indonesian Javanese batik , the pattern being larger and simpler with only occasional use of the canting to create intricate patterns . It relies heavily on brush painting to apply colours to fabrics . The colours also tend to be lighter and more vibrant than deep coloured Javanese batik . The most popular motifs are leaves and flowers . Malaysian batik often displays plants and flowers to avoid the interpretation of human and animal images as idolatry , in accordance with local Islamic doctrine . However , the butterfly theme is a common exception . 
 = = = India = = = 
 Indians are known to use resist method of printing designs on cotton fabrics , which can be traced back 2000 years . Initially , wax and even rice starch were used for printing on fabrics . Until recently batik was made only for dresses and tailored garments , but modern batik is applied in numerous items , such as murals , wall hangings , paintings , household linen , and scarves , with livelier and brighter patterns . Contemporary batik making in India is also done by the Deaf women of Delhi , these women are fluent in Indian Sign Language and also work in other vocational programs . 
 = = = Sri Lanka = = = 
 Over the past century , batik making in Sri Lanka has become firmly established . The Sri Lankan batik industry is a small scale industry which can employ individual design talent and mainly deals with foreign customers for profit . It is now the most visible of the island 's crafts with galleries and factories , large and small , having sprung up in many tourist areas . Rows of small stalls selling batiks can be found all along <unk> 's Galle Road strip . <unk> , on the other hand , is famous for its batik factories . 
 = = = China = = = 
 Batik is done by the ethnic people in the South @-@ West of China . The Miao , <unk> and <unk> people use a dye resist method for their traditional costumes . The traditional costumes are made up of decorative fabrics , which they achieve by pattern weaving and wax resist . Almost all the Miao decorate hemp and cotton by applying hot wax then dipping the cloth in an indigo dye . The cloth is then used for skirts , panels on jackets , aprons and baby carriers . Like the Javanese , their traditional patterns also contain symbolism , the patterns include the dragon , phoenix , and flowers . 
 = = = Africa = = = 
 In Africa , where batik was originally imported by Dutch merchants from Indonesia ( then the Netherlands East Indies ) , paste made from starch or mud is used as a resist instead of wax . The most developed resist @-@ dyeing skills are to be found in Nigeria where the Yoruba make adire cloths . Two methods of resist are used adire <unk> which involves tied and stitched and adire <unk> that uses starch paste . The paste is most often made from cassava starch , rice , and other ingredients boiled together to produce a smooth thick paste . The Yoruba of West Africa use cassava paste as a resist while the <unk> and Wolof people in Senegal uses rice paste . The <unk> people of Mali use mud as a resist .

 = Persuasion ( 1995 film ) = 
 Persuasion is a 1995 period drama film directed by Roger Michell and based on Jane Austen 's 1817 novel of the same name . In her theatrical film debut , the British actress Amanda Root stars as protagonist Anne Elliot , while Ciarán Hinds plays her romantic interest , Captain Frederick Wentworth . The film is set in 19th century England , nine years after Anne was persuaded by others to reject Wentworth 's proposal of marriage . Persuasion follows the two as they become reacquainted with each other , while supporting characters threaten to interfere . 
 The film was adapted by the writer Nick Dear , who considered the story more mature than Austen 's other novels . He characterised it as one of realism and truthfulness , particularly in telling the story of two people separated and then reunited . As Austen 's narrative style conveys Anne 's thoughts internally , Dear and Root felt compelled to express the character 's emotions using comparatively little dialogue . Persuasion was shot in chronological order , allowing the actress to portray Anne 's development from being downtrodden to happy and blossoming . 
 Originally the BBC was the sole producer of Persuasion , until it partnered with the American company WGBH Boston and the French company Millesime . This decision gave the production a larger budget and allowed it to be filmed at locations featured in the novel , including Lyme Regis and Bath . Michell believed this was Austen 's most emotional and poignant novel , as well as her most autobiographical . While directing , he avoided what he felt was the polished , artificial feel of other 19th @-@ century depictions , and discouraged his actors from wearing make @-@ up or appearing too hygienic . Costume designer Alexandra Byrne produced clothing that appeared " lived @-@ in " , winning a BAFTA for her efforts . 
 Persuasion was filmed during a period of popularity for Austen 's works ; it was one of six adaptations of her novels produced during the mid @-@ 1990s . The film originally aired on 16 April 1995 , when it broadcast on the British television channel BBC Two . Sony Pictures Classics released the film in American cinemas on 27 September 1995 , as Austen 's increasing popularity became apparent to Hollywood . Persuasion 's cinematic release attracted the attention of film critics , and it received generally positive reviews , with many praising Root 's performance . Film scholars have since observed significant changes from the source material , as well as class and gender themes . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The film opens by cutting back and forth between scenes of a naval ship carrying Admiral Croft ( John Woodvine ) , and a buggy carrying Mr. Shepherd ( David Collings ) and his daughter Mrs. Clay ( Felicity Dean ) to Kellynch Hall . Shepherd and Clay are accosted by creditors due to the debts owed by the residence 's owner , Sir Walter Elliot ( Corin Redgrave ) , while Croft discusses the end of the Napoleonic Wars with fellow men of the navy . Sir Walter , a vain foppish baronet , is faced with financial ruin unless he <unk> . Though Sir Walter initially opposes the idea , he eventually agrees to temporarily move to Bath while the hall is let ; the idea came from Shepherd , family friend Lady Russell ( Susan Fleetwood ) , and Sir Walter 's second eldest daughter , the intelligent Anne ( Amanda Root ) . 
 Anne is visibly upset upon learning that the new tenant of Kellynch Hall will be Admiral Croft , who is the brother @-@ in @-@ law of Frederick Wentworth ( Ciarán Hinds ) — a naval captain she was persuaded to reject in marriage nine years previously because of his lack of prospects and connections . Wentworth is now wealthy from serving in the Wars , and has returned to England , presumably to find a wife . Later , Anne expresses to Lady Russell her unhappiness at her family 's current financial predicament , and her past decision to reject the captain 's proposal of marriage . Anne visits her other sister Mary ( Sophie Thompson ) , a hypochondriac who has married into a local farming family . Anne patiently listens to the various complaints confided in her by each of the Musgrove family ; this includes Mary 's husband Charles , sisters @-@ in @-@ law Louisa ( Emma Roberts ) and Henrietta ( Victoria Hamilton ) , and parents @-@ in @-@ law Mr and Mrs Musgrove ( Roger Hammond and Judy Cornwell ) . 
 Captain Wentworth comes to dine with the Musgroves , but Anne avoids going when she volunteers to nurse Mary 's injured son . The following morning at breakfast , Anne and Mary are suddenly met briefly by Wentworth , the first time he and Anne have seen each other since she rejected him . Anne later hears that Wentworth thought her so altered that he " would not have known [ her ] again " . Louisa and Henrietta begin to pursue marriage with Wentworth , as the family is unaware of his and Anne 's past relationship . Hurt and rejected by Anne 's refusal years before , Wentworth appears to court Louisa , much to Anne 's chagrin . Later , Wentworth learns Anne also was persuaded by Lady Russell to refuse Charles ' offer of marriage , after which Charles instead proposed to Mary . 
 Anne , Wentworth , and the younger Musgroves go to Lyme and visit two of Wentworth 's old naval friends , Captain Harville ( Robert Glenister ) and Captain Benwick ( Richard McCabe ) . While there , Louisa rashly jumps off a staircase in the hopes Wentworth will catch her , sustaining a head injury . Afterwards , Anne goes to Bath to stay with her father and sister . Sir Walter and Elizabeth reveal they have repaired their relationship with a previously disreputable cousin , Mr. Elliot ( Samuel West ) , the heir to the Elliot baronetcy and estate . Anne is introduced to him , and they realise they briefly saw each other in Lyme . Much to Lady Russell 's pleasure , Mr. Elliot begins to court Anne , but she remains uncertain of his true character . Meanwhile , Louisa has recovered and become engaged to Captain Benwick . Wentworth arrives in Bath and encounters Anne on several occasions , though their conversations are brief . 
 Anne learns from an old friend , Mrs. Smith ( Helen Schlesinger ) , that Mr. Elliot is bankrupt and only interested in marrying Anne to help ensure his inheritance from her father . Anne also is told that Mr. Elliot wishes to keep the baronet from possibly marrying Mrs. Clay to produce a male heir . Soon after , Wentworth overhears Anne talking with Captain Harville about the constancy of a woman 's love , and writes her a letter declaring that he still cares for her . Anne quickly finds him and the two happily walk off down a street , arm in arm . That night at a party , Wentworth announces his intention to marry Anne , much to Mr. Elliot 's consternation . The final scene shows Wentworth and Anne on a naval ship , happy to be together .

 The filming of Persuasion coincided with a sudden resurgence of Jane Austen adaptations , as it was one of six such productions released during the mid @-@ 1990s . The media dubbed the phenomenon " <unk> " . While it was common for a successful adaptation to lead to the production of others , this surge in Austen 's popularity involved many simultaneous projects — Persuasion 's production , for instance , coincided with the TV serial Pride and Prejudice and the feature film Sense and Sensibility . Despite the surge , film scholar Andrew Higson and others argue that there is little evidence that the various producers — who were employed by different companies — communicated when conceiving their adaptations . 
 The idea for a film version of the 1817 Austen novel Persuasion began with the English producer Fiona Finlay , who had wanted to create an adaptation for several years . The novel had last been adapted by ITV in a 1971 serial starring Ann Firbank . Finlay felt that the " very romantic " story was one " everyone can relate to . There 's something very touching about long @-@ lost love " . She approached the writer Nick Dear about adapting it for television ; Finlay had enjoyed his contributions to theatre , particularly his play about William Hogarth , The Art of Success . Dear first suggested they try one of Austen 's other works — either Sense and Sensibility or Pride and Prejudice — but agreed to adapt Persuasion after reading it . Dear considered the novel — the author 's last completed work — a maturer story than the others . 
 Dear later wrote that Persuasion was superficially " a love story in the Cinderella mould " but it was also one of " realism and truthfulness " , particularly in telling the story of two people separated and then reunited . He spent two years working on a script , and found this task difficult for several reasons . First , he needed to find a structure that would be faithful to the novel . Second , his protagonist barely spoke for the first half , and " therefore can 't motor the action along as a central character conventionally does " . Adapting Austen 's wit was another challenge ; much could not be used " because it 's almost all in the author 's voice telling us about characters , with a certain wit or lightness that came from the characters themselves . It 's a craft job , interpreting the novel for oneself and then finding a film language for it " . 
 An experienced theatre and serial director , Roger Michell was chosen to direct Persuasion , in what was to be his first feature film . As a young child , Michell had been an admirer of Austen 's , which set him apart from his male classmates . " I was the only boy in my class who took Austen as a special paper " , he said . His attraction to Persuasion was based on his belief that it was Austen 's most emotional and poignant novel , as well as her most autobiographical . He described the work as an " erotic love story which is full of sexual yearning " . While directing , Michell sought to emphasise contrasts in Austen 's story , seen for instance between " the chilly formality of Kellynch Hall and the warm , wet feel of Uppercross " . The Royal Navy was another point of interest , as officers like Wentworth would often have returned to society wealthy and full of stories . The director wished to depict the integration of cultures , as naval officers came back with " an informality of behaviour and language which was in marked contrast to what was there before " . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Root made her theatrical film debut playing Anne Elliot , the film 's protagonist . According to Root , " every actress in England " read for the part . Having worked with the director previously on the 1993 TV serial The Buddha of Suburbia , Root won the role by writing him a letter to gain an audition . The character was described to Root as " haggard " , which attracted the actress . " I relish a job like this , starting off downtrodden and gradually blossoming " , she said . WGBH Boston , the American company co @-@ producing the film , had wanted a better known actress for the part but agreed to Root 's casting after seeing Root 's screen test . 
 Root came to realise that while the novel 's narrative style allowed Anne 's thoughts to come through , the film adaptation offered comparatively little dialogue . As a result , she " had to cover pages and pages of the story without uttering anything , much of the time . I couldn 't even think about technique , I just had to keep looking at the [ novel ] and then somehow radiate the feelings " . Persuasion was shot in chronological order , which allowed Root to see " what a difference [ her character 's ] sense of unhappiness can create " , as by the end of the film Anne is " happier and looks better " . Root considered the role to be much quieter than her experiences working with the Royal Shakespeare Company , which included her portrayal of Lady Macbeth . The Irish actor Ciarán Hinds , who depicted Frederick Wentworth , commented that Austen " understands a man 's heart and how delicate it can be sometimes " . He also appreciated that , though Wentworth was a " competent leader of men in his profession " , he was " socially inept " in Anne 's presence . Susan Fleetwood , the actress who played Lady Russell , had also worked with Michell on The Buddha of Suburbia . She died soon after filming ; Persuasion was her last film role . 
 = = = Make @-@ up and costume design = = = 
 Michell attempted to be as faithful to the novel as possible , in particular avoiding what he felt was the polished , artificial feel of other period dramas set in the 19th @-@ century . The director explained , " I was desperately trying to make it feel like it could be happening in the next room . I tried to make it something which is absolutely about real people and not about dressing or hairstyles or carpet " . Consequently , because he felt the realistic look of the age would make the film more dramatic , Michell chose to depict the actors without make @-@ up , and disallowed them from looking too hygienic . Root commented about the film 's natural look in an interview , " I basically didn 't wear any makeup [ in the film ] , and my hair was obviously set in a very unflattering way ... I suppose the lighting was quite harsh , as well . None of us looked good " . She said in a separate interview , " I wanted to make Anne Elliot a somewhat plain woman who was not really miserable but had found a way to be content somehow , and yet emotions are buzzing around her all the time " . Root believed the film 's realistic depiction of the age was a key aspect of its appeal . 
 The film 's costume design was overseen by Alexandra Byrne , who created clothing that appeared " lived @-@ in " and " realistic " . Like Fleetwood , Byrne had also worked with Michell on The Buddha of Suburbia . It was her first time designing period costumes for film . During shooting , the crew often had to compete for costumes and props with the BBC production Pride and Prejudice , which was being filmed at the same time . Persuasion 's crew consequently had to send for replacement items from Italy and Australia . For her work in the film , Byrne won a BAFTA for Best Costume Design . 
 Louise Watson , writing for Screenonline , felt the film 's costume and make @-@ up help " convey the full Cinderella transformation of Austen 's heroine . At first the undervalued family martyr , Anne is the wallflower who has lost her ' bloom ' . Her loose @-@ fitting costumes hint at how she has pined away since refusing Wentworth ... As she regains her confidence , she blossoms ; she dresses <unk> , her eyes sparkle and her features become animated " . Paulette Richards argues that the film 's " unreliable " male characters , such as Sir Walter , are identified as such by the flamboyant nature of their clothing . This flamboyance is especially clear to modern viewers , who live in a culture where " real men " are expected to care little for their clothing . Conversely , the film 's Wentworth is typically depicted in naval uniforms , which is a contrast to Bryan Marshall 's version of the character in the 1971 adaptation . This uniform helps set Wentworth apart from many of the other male characters , allowing him to appear romantic but isolated . Gina and Andrew MacDonald had a similar view of the film , writing that it accurately captures Austen 's satire by juxtaposing the upper classes ' extravagance in fashion with the virtuous qualities of the Royal Navy . The naval men 's profession is emphasised by the frequency of wearing their uniforms , in contrast to other adaptations of the novel . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 As a BBC production , Persuasion originally received a budget of £ 750 @,@ 000 . The British broadcaster proposed a collaboration with the American public television station WGBH Boston , a partnership that had also produced the American anthology television series Masterpiece Theatre as well as literary adaptations like the serial Pride and Prejudice . Rebecca Eaton , executive producer of Masterpiece Theatre , approved the co @-@ production as she had a preference for Persuasion out of all Austen 's novels . The decision led to additional funding . Eaton would cite Persuasion as a successful example of WGBH using its small budget to invest in television projects , though she later expressed regret that the adaptation was two hours rather than a " luscious " six @-@ part miniseries . Additionally , the French company Millesime co @-@ produced the film in exchange for airing it on television in France . This decision further increased funding to £ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . Mobil Oil Corporation , a major sponsor of Masterpiece Theatre , co @-@ produced the film . 
 The diverse sources of funding meant that the production team had to field opinions from various sources . Millesime was unhappy with certain aspects of the story , for instance wanting the entire Lyme sequence removed because they considered it " too boring " . WGBH gave the BBC detailed notes , which were then integrated into the script . One change concerned the ending . To display the climax when Anne and Wentworth finally approach each other with their feelings , two different scenes were shot , one in which they kiss and one in which they do not . Dear first wrote a scene closely modelled after Austen 's ending : Anne reunites with Wentworth on the streets of Bath , and the two exchange words and hold hands . Eaton felt that after hours of waiting , audiences " would go nuts with frustration and irritation " if the two did not kiss . Eaton also thought " a kiss would be an emotional pay @-@ off " , and WGBH believed it would give the film a wider appeal . Michell agreed to compromise , opting to shoot one British version and one American version — the latter included the kiss . The American ending is reflected on the international poster , which shows the two protagonists embracing . While the kiss attracted some criticism among fans , actress Amanda Root defended it . " After the great suspense of the story , by the end you 're desperate for Anne and Captain Wentworth to get together , desperate ! Film is a visual medium , after all . You don 't necessarily want to see them in bed together , but you do want to see something like a kiss " , she said . 
 In comparison to its adaptations of the 1970s and 1980s , the BBC provided increased funding for many of its productions in the 1990s . Persuasion consequently benefited , allowing it to frequently film on @-@ location in places including Lyme Regis and Bath , and in the south @-@ eastern English countryside . Both Lyme and Bath are prominent locales in Austen 's novel . Dear desired the opening sequence be on board a Royal Navy ship of the period , but the only authentic vessel available was the HMS Victory . It was dry docked as part of a museum in Portsmouth , and filming was only possible during short periods when the vessel was closed to the public . The final shot , in which Anne and Wentworth gaze into the ocean , was taken from the 1984 historical film The Bounty . The film 's low budget also resulted in one of the opening shots , depicting Admiral Croft 's ship on the ocean , being taken from The Bounty . 
 = = Themes and analysis = = 
 = = = Changes from source material = = = 
 While Dear has received praise for " remarkably ... retain [ ing ] most of the source novel 's complex plot and numerous characters " , literary scholars have noted significant differences between the film and the source material . Sarah R. Morrison observes that the film 's version of Anne articulates thoughts that the character would never say in the novel . Morrison cites Anne 's adamant defence of her visit to Mrs. Smith — where Anne visits a poor old friend rather than go to the party of a titled relative — in the film as an example , as " Austen 's narrator makes it abundantly clear that Anne would never presume to dispute with her father upon such terms of absolute equality " . The film 's Anne also engages in actions not visible in the novel , such as her haste to stop Wentworth from leaving a musical concert when he feels demeaned by disparaging comments about his profession . Morrison attributes these differences to the difficulty in adapting novel to film , particularly as the latter form lacks a narrator to convey Anne 's inner thoughts . 
 The film also expands upon Austen 's subtle characterisation by exaggerating the emotions of characters and certain scenes . For example , in the novel during an early party Anne offers to play the pianoforte like usual ; while doing so , she is slightly tearful but also " extremely glad to be employed " and " unobserved " . Conversely , Dear 's screenplay has Wentworth quickly giving up his seat to Anne and then immediately dancing with the Musgrove sisters , furthering the contrast between Anne and the others . According to David Monaghan , Austen 's novel displays a " relatively radical vision " of societal change , such as the rise of a professional class challenging the old order of landed gentry . Monaghan posits that this vision appealed to Dear and Michell , who used visuals and movement to emphasise this change . However , the two " deviate significantly " from the source material by depicting Anne and Wentworth as " single @-@ mindedly oriented " to the future and thus 20th @-@ century viewers ' sensibilities . 
 Sue Parrill observes that Persuasion 's larger production budget , which allowed the crew to film much content on @-@ location , " enabled the filmmakers to make fuller use of setting for symbolism and for creation of mood " . The weather , for instance , is particularly important to Anne 's state of mind in the novel . Persuasion 's opening scenes establish its historical context , as well as the financial predicament in which the Elliot family finds itself . Indeed , for Rachel Brownstein , by opening the film with a depiction of sailors , the director is confronting a common complaint of Austen 's works — her failure to mention the Napoleonic Wars . The juxtaposition between the navy and the Elliots establishes their differences , with the former group discussing the fall of Napoleon and the latter group discussing the relatively minor inconvenience of overspending . 
 = = = Class and gender = = = 
 In his introduction to the published screenplay , Dear said he was in part attracted to adapt Persuasion because it depicted a " world in transition " . To him , the novel showed " an old order fading away into decadence , and a new tribe , a meritocracy , coming to the fore " . While directing , Roger Michell felt that the story included " the prototype of the postmodern family " — Anne 's mother is dead , her father is bankrupt , and " the old social orders are breaking down " . Root described Anne as a " feminist in a prefeminist period " and a " strong , independent character " , to whom modern viewers can relate despite the story 's period setting . 
 Austen scholars have studied the film 's intersection with class and social change . Carole M. Dole notes that , among the many productions of Austen 's work that appeared in the 1990s , Persuasion was the only one to " insistently draw attention to class issues " , and " provide striking visual testimony to the workings of the British class system " . The film , she adds , accomplishes this in part by focusing on the servants ' faces , gauging their negative reactions to events . Richards , too , finds Michell " visually more aware " of the lower classes , adding that the film 's inclusion of black servants alludes to the " colonial sources of wealth " supporting those superior in class and rank . Anne @-@ Marie Scholz writes that the film and Emma Thompson 's Sense and Sensibility both highlight the theme of class , but in different ways . Unlike Sense and Sensibility , Persuasion depicts general class divisions rather than just how the working class impacts the protagonists — the camera focuses on the faces and expressions of servants and working people , personifying them . 
 In Michell 's opinion , Austen was a " proto @-@ feminist " who possessed a " clear @-@ sighted vision of the ways the world is tilted against women " . As evidence , Michell cites a book scene in which Anne discusses how songs and proverbs about women 's fickleness were all written by men . Scholz argues that Anne 's marginal status as a woman in the film is linked to that of the servants ; the parallel between class and gender is conveyed with Anne 's trip to Uppercross in a cart containing animals . Julianne Pidduck adds that the director " pointedly foregrounds themes of class and gendered social constraint by juxtaposing the stuffy interiors of mannered society with the inviting , open horizons of the sea " . As an example , Pidduck discusses Anne 's stay in a gated residence in Bath , where she gazes out of an upper story window in search for Wentworth on the streets below . To her , Wentworth and the sea represent freedom and possibility .

 Persuasion premiered on 16 April 1995 , Easter Day , on the British television channel BBC Two . An estimated 3 @.@ 8 million viewers watched the production . BBC Two aired it again on 25 December , Christmas Day . It also later aired on the American television channel PBS on 6 April 1997 . 
 Near the end of filming , Rebecca Eaton noticed the growing " buzz " surrounding Austen and costume dramas in Hollywood . WGBH had never made a theatrical film before , but " decided to try its luck on the big screen " . Sony Pictures Classics saw a cut of the adaptation and requested permission to show it in American cinemas , releasing it on 27 September 1995 . There , it was characterised as an " art @-@ house " film , with a small niche audience . It was shown at the Toronto and Chicago International Film Festivals . Persuasion earned $ 56 @,@ 000 in its first week of release in New York , and grossed $ 150 @,@ 000 in Los Angeles . The total US gross was $ 5 @,@ 269 @,@ 757 . It was less financially successful than the popular Sense and Sensibility , which was released in cinemas several months later . The film was released in VHS format on 12 November 1996 ; a DVD version followed on 1 February 2000 . 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 Upon its release , Persuasion at first failed to attract many critical reviews . This changed when Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility were released in late 1995 to great success in the UK . Their reception lifted the earlier film out of obscurity , as Austen 's popularity became apparent among critics . Persuasion garnered highly positive reviews from major film critics , and critical review website Rotten Tomatoes has since calculated a rating of 83 % , which refers to the percentage of positive reviews . Caryn James of The New York Times deemed it a " critic 's pick " , praising " a cast completely in sync with Austen 's warm but piercing style " . Jay Carr of The Boston Globe highlighted Root 's performance , calling it " a heart @-@ stoppingly reticent yet glorious debut " . 
 In a contribution for The Washington Post , Desson Howe said " there 's a wonderful , unhurried delicacy about Persuasion ... as if everyone concerned with the production knows that , if given time and patience , Austen 's genius will emerge . Thanks to assured performances , exacting direction and , of course , inspired writing , it does , in subtle , glorious ways " . Writing for Entertainment Weekly , critic Ken Tucker graded the film with an " A – " , saying it " should enthral even those who haven 't read " the novel . Tucker concluded that the film was " the sort of passionate yet precise comedy that reminds me why Austen remains such a vital writer " . Susan Ostrov Weisser , a professor of nineteenth @-@ century literature , called the film a " faithful parade of Austen 's world " , and praised Root as the film 's " crown jewel " for playing a " fiercely intelligent , regretful , and frustrated Anne Elliot with subtlety and nuance " . In 2008 , James Rampton of The Independent rated it the fourth best Austen adaptation of all time . 
 When reviewing , film critics often compared the respective adaptations of Persuasion and Sense and Sensibility . Thompson 's film received more recognition and accolades from Hollywood , while Michell 's production gained the admiration of up @-@ market critics , who felt it was a more authentic and thoughtful representation of Austen 's world . Janet Maslin of The New York Times , for instance , wrote that Sense and Sensibility " can 't match the brilliant incisiveness of the more spartan Persuasion , still the most thoughtful new Austen adaptation " . The Los Angeles Times characterised Persuasion as " the most authentically British version and the one closest to the spirit of the novels " and Sense and Sensibility as " the audience @-@ friendly Hollywood version of Austen , easygoing and aiming to please " . Time magazine named them both the best films of 1995 , referring to Persuasion as " reserved " and Sense and Sensibility as " more bustling " . Higson , when analysing both productions , felt Persuasion captured a sense of " gritty realism " that would influence such later Austen adaptations as Mansfield Park ( 1999 ) and Becoming Jane ( 2007 ) .

 The Suquamish Museum opened in 1983 as the Suquamish Museum and Cultural Center , then only the second tribal museum in the state of Washington . In 2009 the Suquamish tribe launched a capital campaign to construct a new facility , enlisting Senator Patty Murray and former Washington Secretary of State Ralph Munro to help lead the effort .

 In addition to a large repository of photographs documenting tribal life from the 1860s to the present , the museum 's collection includes 496 archaeological artifacts recovered from the site of the former Old Man House , a massive , 240 meters ( 790 ft ) long longhouse that served as the Suquamish capitol until its destruction in the late nineteenth century . Originally in the custody of the Burke Museum at the University of Washington , the artifacts , which include harpoon points , smoking pipes , and jewelry , were transferred to the Suquamish tribe in 2013 . In 2014 , the Port of Seattle transferred additional artifacts to the museum , including crockery and glass bottles , discovered during archaeological excavations in the 1970s at the Baba <unk> site , a pre @-@ contact village located in what is now Seattle 's Belltown neighborhood .

 = No. 79 Squadron RAAF = 
 No. 79 Squadron is a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) flight training unit that has been formed on four occasions since 1943 . The squadron was established in May 1943 as a fighter unit equipped with Supermarine Spitfires , and subsequently saw combat in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II . Between June 1943 and the end of the war in August 1945 it flew air defence patrols to protect Allied bases and ships , escorted Australian and United States aircraft , and attacked Japanese positions . The squadron was disbanded in November 1945 , but was re @-@ formed between 1962 and 1968 to operate CAC Sabres from Ubon Air Base in Thailand . In this role it contributed to the defence of Thailand against a feared attack from its neighbouring states and exercised with United States Air Force units . No. 79 Squadron was active again at RAAF Base Butterworth in Malaysia between 1986 and 1988 where it operated Mirage III fighters and a single DHC @-@ 4 Caribou transport during the period in which the RAAF 's fighter squadrons were transitioning to new aircraft . 
 The squadron was re @-@ formed in its present incarnation during 1998 and is currently stationed at RAAF Base Pearce , where it has operated Hawk 127 jet training aircraft since 2000 . The unit 's main role is to provide introductory jet aircraft training to RAAF pilots as well as refresher training on the Hawk for experienced pilots . No. 79 Squadron also supports Australian Army and Royal Australian Navy training exercises in Western Australia and the Northern Territory .

 No. 79 Squadron was formed at RAAF Base Laverton in Victoria on 26 April 1943 under the command of flying ace Squadron Leader Alan Rawlinson . The squadron 's intended role was to use Spitfire Vc fighters to provide ' high cover ' escort for the RAAF 's P @-@ 40 Kittyhawk @-@ equipped units which were engaging Japanese forces in the New Guinea Campaign . This requirement was considered urgent , and the Chief of the Air Staff , Air Vice Marshal George Jones , directed that No. 79 Squadron receive priority for the RAAF 's limited stock of Spitfires . The squadron moved to Wooloomanata Aerodrome several days after it was formed , and received its first Spitfires on 3 May . While at Wooloomanata No. 79 Squadron undertook training exercises to prepare for combat . The allocation of 24 Spitfires to the squadron resulted in No. 1 Wing RAAF , which was stationed near Darwin and responsible for protecting the town against air attack , suffering a shortage of these aircraft during June and July . 
 No. 79 Squadron began moving to Goodenough Island in the war zone off the north coast of Papua in mid @-@ May 1943 . Its advance party departed Wooloomanata on 17 May , followed by the pilots on 4 June . The main body of ground crew sailed from Sydney on 7 June . The squadron suffered its first fatality on 13 June , when Flight Lieutenant Virgil Brennan — an experienced fighter pilot who had shot down 10 Axis aircraft over Malta — died from wounds incurred when his Spitfire collided with another while they were landing at Cairns . During the unit 's transit to Goodenough Island , No. 79 Squadron Spitfires were scrambled from Gurney Airfield at Milne Bay on several occasions between 19 and 25 June to intercept Japanese reconnaissance aircraft , but did not damage these intruders . 
 The squadron completed its movement to Goodenough Island on 26 June and began flying air defence sorties from Vivigani Airfield as part of No. 73 Wing . It did not intercept any Japanese aircraft while operating from this base , however . The squadron moved to <unk> Airfield on Kiriwina between 9 and 18 August , from where it operated alongside the P @-@ 40 Kittyhawk @-@ equipped No. 76 Squadron . This was the closest Allied airfield to the major Japanese base at Rabaul and was expected to be regularly attacked . No Japanese raids were made on the airfield during the first weeks of the squadron 's deployment there , however , and its pilots were disappointed to not see combat while conducting patrols in support of United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) raids on Rabaul . The Imperial Japanese Army Air Force ( IJAAF ) began a series of attacks on Goodenough Island and Kiriwina in early October , however , and the squadron claimed its first victory in 31 October when one of its Spitfires shot down a Kawasaki Ki @-@ 61 fighter 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) north of Kiriwina ( this type of aircraft was labelled the " Tony " by the Allies ) . 
 After a period of training , No. 79 Squadron flew its first sweep over Japanese @-@ held territory on 27 November when eight Spitfires were dispatched to Gasmata on New Britain . The next day one of its Spitfires shot down a Mitsubishi Ki @-@ 46 " Dinah " reconnaissance aircraft south of <unk> . As few Japanese attacks were made against <unk> , No. 79 Squadron 's pilots became restive . The offensive patrols over New Britain improved their morale , however . Another Ki @-@ 61 was intercepted and shot down by a Spitfire on 21 December , and an A6M Mitsubishi A6M " Zero " fighter was destroyed on the ground at Gasmata seven days later . A Spitfire was lost during a patrol over New Britain on 31 December , however . During January and February 1944 the squadron conducted offensive sweeps over New Britain , strafed Japanese positions and escorted Allied bombers . On 17 January , eight No. 79 Squadron Spitfires took part in an attack against a Japanese camp near Lindenhafen which involved 73 Australian aircraft ; this was the largest RAAF operation of the war up to that time . Two Spitfires were lost during the operations in January and February . 
 In early 1944 No. 73 Wing was selected to support the US Army 's Admiralty Islands campaign . The 1st Cavalry Division began to land on the islands on 29 February , and the wing moved to Momote Airstrip on Los Negros Island in March 1944 . No. 79 Squadron became operational there with 24 aircraft on the 29th of the month . From Momote , the squadron flew ground attack sorties in support of US troops until Japanese resistance ceased . No Japanese aircraft were encountered throughout this operation . By the end of April , No. 79 Squadron 's main role was to escort Allied shipping , though flying was hampered by a shortage of spare parts . The squadron 's commanding officer , Squadron Leader M.S. Bott , was killed in an accident on 16 April . Shipping escort patrols continued in May , but difficulties maintaining the Spitfires reduced the squadron to just two operational aircraft with another 12 awaiting repair . Due to a shortage of aircraft the squadron 's flying activities were limited to training sorties between August and October , and aircraft availability continued to be a problem until late November . On 9 November , two Spitfires unsuccessfully attempted to intercept three Japanese A6M fighters which had raided Hyane Harbour ; while the Japanese force had been tracked by Allied radar for 25 minutes prior to the attack , the Spitfires were scrambled only after the raiders had left the area . No. 79 Squadron subsequently maintained a three @-@ aircraft patrol over Los Negros during daylight hours until 22 November . Two days later the squadron was released from operations ahead of moving to Darwin in northern Australia to be re @-@ equipped with more modern Mark VIII Spitfires . 
 No. 79 Squadron arrived at Sattler Airfield south of Darwin on 12 January 1945 and received its new aircraft shortly afterwards . It began to move to Morotai in the Netherlands East Indies ( NEI ) on 6 February and became operational there as part of No. 80 Wing at the end of March . The squadron conducted ground attack sorties against Japanese positions on nearby islands until the end of the war and also became responsible for Morotai 's air defence from 28 May . Although no Japanese aircraft were encountered in this area , several Spitfires were shot down by anti @-@ aircraft fire during ground attack sorties . Operations were hindered at times by personnel shortages , and many of the airmen who were posted to the unit were judged by the squadron 's commander to have been inadequately trained . On 30 July No. 80 Wing was disbanded and the squadron became the first flying unit assigned to the newly formed No. 11 Group . This group was responsible for garrison duties in much of Borneo and the eastern NEI . No. 79 Squadron dropped leaflets on Japanese positions after Japan agreed to surrender on 15 August and returned to Australia in October 1945 . It was disbanded at Oakey Airfield on 12 November that year . The unit suffered 13 fatal casualties during the war . In late 2010 the squadron was awarded battle honours for its World War II service in the Pacific , New Britain and Morotai .

 In May 1962 the Australian Government decided to deploy a squadron of CAC Sabre fighters to Thailand to bolster that country 's defences . This action was undertaken as part of Australia 's Southeast Asia Treaty Organization ( SEATO ) commitment to defend Thailand against attack from its Communist neighbours , which was thought likely to occur . The United States , United Kingdom and New Zealand also deployed forces to Thailand in response to this perceived threat , though Malaysia and several other SEATO members chose not to be involved . On 28 May , Minister for Defence Athol Townley announced that Australia 's contribution would be an RAAF squadron equipped with Sabre fighters . The eight aircraft , along with their pilots and ground crew , were drawn from No. 77 Squadron , which formed part of Australia 's Commonwealth Strategic Reserve forces at RAAF Base Butterworth in Malaysia . In order to preserve Malaysia 's neutrality , the Sabres were flown to Thailand via Singapore . This force was designated No. 79 Squadron while at Tengah Air Base in Singapore on 29 May . ( I ) 
 The squadron arrived at Ubon Air Base in the Ubon Ratchathani Province of eastern Thailand on 1 June 1962 and flew its first operational patrol four days later . Facilities at Ubon were initially spartan , and the pilots and ground crew lived in tents . Construction of permanent accommodation began under the supervision of No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron in September 1962 , however , and facilities were later further improved . Despite Malaysia 's policy of neutrality in regards the conflict in Southeast Asia , No. 79 Squadron operated as a detachment of the RAAF force ( No. 78 Wing ) based at Butterworth throughout its time in Thailand . Aircraft and personnel were regularly transferred between Butterworth and Ubon , and most pilots ' nominally six @-@ month @-@ long tours of duty in Thailand were broken into several shorter periods during which they and their aircraft were illegally rotated between the two bases . In March 1963 the Defence Committee , which was the highest decision @-@ making body of the Department of Defence , recommended to Cabinet that No. 79 Squadron be withdrawn from Thailand on the grounds that the British and New Zealand contingents had left the country . The Cabinet 's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee decided against this on 28 March as it was believed that maintaining the squadron at Ubon helped maintain good relationships with Thailand and the United States . The Thai Government was discreetly asked if it would prefer a different form of assistance , however . 
 Throughout its period at Ubon , No. 79 Squadron formed part of an international force tasked with defending Thailand 's air space against intruders . At the start of the deployment , tensions in Thailand were such that the squadron 's personnel believed that they were at war . While the situation became more stable from late July 1962 , No. 79 Squadron maintained armed aircraft on alert at all times and scrambled Sabres when unidentified aircraft were detected . No air attacks were conducted against Thailand , however , and the unidentified aircraft that were intercepted almost always proved to be from the Central Intelligence Agency @-@ controlled Air America . In January 1965 two Sabres accidentally overflew North Vietnam after becoming lost during a training sortie but returned safely to Ubon . 
 From early April 1965 , Ubon became an important base for United States Air Force ( USAF ) attacks on North Vietnam during the Vietnam War , and No. 79 Squadron became part of an integrated air defence system controlled by the USAF on 25 June . This changed the status of the squadron 's presence in Thailand , and RAAF Headquarters assessed that the North Vietnamese would be justified in regarding it as forming part of the air campaign against their country . Due to the threat of counter @-@ attacks on Ubon , the base 's ground defences were upgraded during 1966 ; this included the construction of defensive positions for No. 79 Squadron 's aircraft and personnel as well as the deployment of a detachment of RAAF airfield defence guards . While the squadron did not play an active role in the war , it supported the US effort by providing air defence for Ubon and taking part in exercises with USAF aircraft in which the Sabres adopted tactics used by North Vietnamese MiG @-@ 17 fighters . In December 1965 the commander of the United States Pacific Air Forces , General Hunter Harris , Jr . , wrote to the chief of the RAAF , Air Marshal Alister Murdoch , to suggest that No. 79 Squadron join the USAF operations against the Ho Chi Minh trail in southern Laos which were being covertly conducted by Ubon @-@ based aircraft . The Thai Government indicated that it would allow the squadron to be used for this purpose as long as the Australian operations were conducted without a formal agreement or any public announcement . On 2 March 1966 the Australian Cabinet decided to reinforce the Army and RAAF force in South Vietnam , but rejected the option of expanding the scope of RAAF operations in Thailand . This decision was made on the grounds that the expanded force in South Vietnam and existing deployments to Thailand , Malaysia and Singapore represented the maximum forces Australia could commit to the region . 
 By mid @-@ 1968 , No. 79 Squadron no longer had a clear role at Ubon . The USAF had sufficient fighters based in Thailand to defend the country and was reluctant to use the Australian fighters — which were now regarded as obsolete — to intercept potentially hostile aircraft , as the squadron 's rules of engagement did not allow it to pursue contacts that left Thai airspace . As a result , the Australian military 's chiefs of staff determined that the RAAF presence in Thailand had outlived its political and military usefulness and decided to withdraw the squadron without replacement . No. 79 Squadron was taken off alert status on 26 July and disbanded at the end of the month . On 31 March 2011 it received a battle honour for its deployment to Ubon between May 1962 and August 1968 . ( II )

 On 31 March 1986 , No. 79 Squadron was re @-@ formed at RAAF Base Butterworth as a temporary measure to cover part of the period while the RAAF 's three fighter squadrons were transitioning from Mirage IIIs to F / A @-@ 18 Hornets . The squadron inherited all of No. 3 Squadron 's twelve Mirage IIIs fighters and most of its personnel ; the remainder of No. 3 Squadron returned to Australia to be re @-@ equipped with Hornets . As well as the Mirage IIIs , the squadron operated a single DHC @-@ 4 Caribou transport that was also based at Butterworth . 
 In its new incarnation , No. 79 Squadron continued the air defence and training duties for which No. 3 Squadron had been responsible at Butterworth . It participated in routine training exercises in Southeast Asia , which included making regular deployments to Paya Lebar Air Base in Singapore to train with the Republic of Singapore Air Force . In May 1987 the squadron deployed to Clarke Air Force Base in the Philippines to participate in the annual Cope Thunder exercise with USAF units . It also exercised with No. 77 Squadron 's new F / A @-@ 18 Hornets in April 1988 when that unit visited Butterworth . The Caribou transport was used to support Australian Army units in Malaysia and also flew training sorties to neighbouring countries . 
 By early 1988 both No. 3 and No. 77 Squadrons had successfully converted to the F / A @-@ 18 , and No. 79 Squadron was no longer required . Preparations to return the unit 's Mirages to Australia took place during the first months of 1988 , and on 3 May they departed Butterworth . As the RAAF 's F / A @-@ 18 Hornet squadrons were to be based in Australia , this marked the end of the permanent deployment of RAAF fighters to Butterworth that had begun in mid @-@ 1958 . No. 79 Squadron 's aircraft commemorated the occasion by conducting a spectacular low @-@ altitude flypast of the base , the first leg of which commenced at transonic speed . The aircraft were flown to Woomera in central Australia to be placed in storage via Paya Lebar , Bali , Darwin and RAAF Base Tindal . Most of No. 79 Squadron 's ground crew returned to Australia in late May , and the squadron was formally disbanded at Butterworth on 30 June 1988 .

 No. 79 Squadron was re @-@ formed a third time on 1 July 1998 as a training unit located at RAAF Base Pearce near Perth in Western Australia . The squadron was re @-@ established by separating No. 25 Squadron 's Permanent Air Force ( full @-@ time ) component from its Air Force Reserve ( part @-@ time reservist ) personnel and responsibilities . The squadron initially operated <unk> MB @-@ 326 aircraft before being re @-@ equipped with Hawk 127 aircraft between 7 December 2000 and 4 March 2001 . In 2000 No. 78 Wing was re @-@ formed and assumed command of No. 76 and No. 79 Squadrons . The Hawks experienced serviceability problems during their first 18 months with the squadron , but these were eventually rectified . During October 2003 two No. 79 Squadron Hawks conducted a tour of Australia to belatedly commemorate the unit 's 60th anniversary . During this tour the aircrew visited Alan Rawlinson at his home at Naracoorte , South Australia , and later conducted a flyover of the town in his honour . The squadron made its first overseas deployment in almost twenty years during April 2006 when six Hawks and 52 personnel were dispatched to RMAF Base Butterworth to take part in Exercise Bersama Shield . This was also the first time RAAF Hawks had operated overseas . As of May 2010 , No. 79 Squadron was equipped with 15 of the RAAF 's 33 Hawks . In 2011 , the squadron was organised into a Training Flight , Operations Flight , and Maintenance Flight . A program to modernise all of the RAAF 's Hawks to a similar standard to the Royal Air Force 's Hawk T.2 aircraft began in 2014 , and No. 79 Squadron is scheduled to begin operations with these aircraft in mid @-@ 2017 . The unit 's Maintenance Flight was disbanded in July 2016 when responsibility for support services for the Hawks was transferred to BAE Systems . 
 In its current role No. 79 Squadron 's main responsibility is to provide introductory fast jet training to pilots who have recently graduated from No. 2 Flying Training School . During this training , new pilots who have been selected to fly jet aircraft are taught to operate Hawks and provided with initial instruction on jet aircraft combat tactics . In 2004 , each of No. 79 Squadron 's training courses lasted for twelve weeks . After completing their initial jet aircraft training , pilots transfer to No. 76 Squadron at RAAF Base Williamtown for advanced instruction before being posted to one of the RAAF 's operational conversion units . No. 79 Squadron also provides introductory training on fast jets for RAAF air combat officers who have been selected to serve on board F / A @-@ 18F Super Hornets . The squadron trained RAAF personnel selected to serve as navigators on board F @-@ 111 strike aircraft until these aircraft were replaced with Super Hornets in 2010 . No. 79 Squadron also provides refresher training on the Hawk aircraft for experienced fighter pilots . 
 In addition to its pilot training responsibilities , No. 79 Squadron 's Operations Flight provides aircraft to support Navy and Army training exercises . These duties are undertaken by experienced pilots who did not successfully complete operational conversion training , and also by new pilots who have completed training with No. 76 Squadron and been posted back to No. 79 Squadron until a place becomes available in an operational conversion course . No. 76 Squadron has a similar Operations Flight . Most of No. 79 Squadron 's exercises with the Navy take place off the coast of Western Australia , but aircraft are occasionally deployed to Darwin for this task .

 James Morris III ( ( 1752 @-@ 01 @-@ 19 ) January 19 , 1752 – April 20 , 1820 ( 1820 @-@ 04 @-@ 20 ) ) was a Continental Army officer from Connecticut during the American Revolutionary War and founder of the Morris Academy , a pioneer in coeducation . 
 Born in Litchfield County , Connecticut , James Morris spent his early life hoping and training to be a minister . However , after graduating from Yale College , Morris accepted a commission of First Lieutenant from the Continental Army and joined the fight for American Independence . Morris was captured during the Battle of Germantown and spent most of the remaining war in captivity . Upon his release , Morris was promoted to the rank of Captain and supported Alexander Hamilton in the Siege of Yorktown . When he returned from the war , Morris began and ran an academy that trained both boys and girls together , a rarity at the time . 
 James Morris died in 1820 . In 1859 , Morris 's hometown of South Farms , Connecticut was renamed Morris in his honor . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 James Morris was born to Deacon James Morris Jr. and Phebe Barns Morris in South Farms , Connecticut on January 19 , 1752 . 
 Even as a young man , Morris displayed a disposition for education , borrowing often from the library in nearby Bethlehem , where his father was a member . Through these studies , Morris hoped to eventually become a minister . When Morris was eighteen , his father sent him to live full @-@ time in Bethlehem and study under Dr. Joseph Bellamy . Morris continued with Bellamy until the spring of 1770 , when he spent the season studying under the South Farms minister Dr. Salmon Hurlburt . That fall Morris found yet another instructor in Mr. Nathan Hale , saying of him , " Mr. Hale was an accurate scholar and an able instructor . " 
 In September 1771 , Morris began more formal studies at Yale College . For his tutor at Yale , Morris was assigned future Yale president Timothy Dwight IV , who would be an influential force in coeducation in his own right . Morris was awarded his degree in July , 1775 , noting in his memoirs , " having had my share of honorary appointments . " 
 Upon graduation Morris returned to South Farms , where he helped his father with the harvest and took a post teaching grammar school in nearby Litchfield , where he received his first opportunity to teach and was paid " ' handsome wages ' hoping to reimburse his father for the heavy expenses of his college education .
