 The book begins with Sasha chasing after her owner 's car , which then speeds off , leaving her grief @-@ stricken in the street . She then is filled with memories of her human owners , Ken and Jean , who took care of her . Everything was right until Jean got sick , and despite all they could do , she died . Ken , lamenting over Jean , then went with several other humans and left the house . Sasha , having escaped from an open bathroom window , began chasing after him . Unsuccessful , she wanders into the forest after seeing her friend <unk> for the last time . 
 Soon after , she finds an old den made of logs and bedded with leaves , and settles down there . The next day , while hunting prey she encounters a tom named Pine , who engages in conversation with Sasha . He warns her of the Clan cats living in the forest , in the process taking off her collar for her . The next morning , a ShadowClan patrol consisting of Tigerstar , <unk> , and <unk> comes along , and Sasha takes a particular interest in Tigerstar . After <unk> scents traces of foxes , a frog appears , although he is unsuccessful at catching it . Before it can get away , though , Sasha drops on it and says that it slipped through their paws . 
 The next night , Sasha realizes that she has feelings for Tigerstar , and misses a rabbit while being caught up in her thoughts . Turning around she sees that Tigerstar had caught it for her , criticizes her hunting technique , and tells her she needs someone to show her how to hunt properly . When Sasha asks who would teach her , he says that he might . 
 After a time of not seeing Tigerstar , Sasha returns to her den one evening , only to find Tigerstar already waiting for her . Asking him where he was , he comments on how nice her den was , and then stops and asks when she will be seeing her humans again , after seeing her collar hanging around a protruding branch on the logs . Sasha asks him why he was snooping around in her den , and he tells her that he cannot see her any more if she has the collar . She refuses to destroy it , and quarrels with Tigerstar about housecats and how they are not independent . Sad , she reminisces about her perfect life with Jean and Ken . 
 The next day , Sasha leaves a pigeon at the ShadowClan border to prove to Tigerstar that <unk> can hunt . After catching a rabbit , Sasha is attacked by two foxes . Before she can escape , though , Tigerstar comes and attacks the duo of animals , telling her to run . Scrambling up a tree , Sasha sees that the foxes have an advantage over him , and she jumps down to assist him . After defeating both foxes , Tigerstar stays in her den for the night and lets his wounds heal , and tells Sasha that he came to thank her for the pigeon , and that she is unlike any housecat he has ever known . 
 One night Sasha brings Tigerstar to her old fence near the town . Upon sitting on it , he loses interest and Sasha takes offense , although he comments that if she wishes to be a rogue she would have to say goodbye to her old life . 
 Tigerstar shows her around ShadowClan camp the next day , and introduces her to Blackstar , then known as Blackfoot . Sasha is offered to join a patrol , which she accepts . Along the way , she also sees Pine , who has gotten sick because winter is now coming on . Because Sasha does so well on the patrol , Tigerstar invites her to spend the night in the warriors den . Enjoying herself immensely , Sasha accepts . 
 Racing back to the camp , she looks down on the camp from a tree , suddenly stopped by the voices of Tigerstar and his Clanmates . Soon she becomes frightened after Tigerstar discusses his plans to rule the forest with his Clanmates , including hiring BloodClan and setting a pack of dogs on ThunderClan . Extremely scared and changing her mind , Sasha flees , but before she can get far she is approached by Tigerstar who asks if she will join ShadowClan . 
 = = = = = Escape from the Forest = = = = = 
 The book opens to Sasha refusing Tigerstar 's offer to join ShadowClan . Their conversation turns into an argument , and Sasha insists that Tigerstar 's plans go against the warrior code . 
 Back at her den , Sasha thinks about her heartbreak , and dreams of Ken coming , finding her , and taking her home . She makes her way out of the forest , realizing that she has no place there anymore . She bumps into Pine , and tells him that she is leaving . 
 Sasha returns to where she used to live with Ken and Jean , and is chased away by the human that is now living there . In a secondhand clothing store , Sasha catches Ken 's scent and finds one of his coats . As she roams the town , Sasha encounters two BloodClan warriors and narrowly escapes . Sasha wanders onto a tour boat , where she curls up and goes to sleep . 
 When Sasha wakes up , the floor is shaking . She runs outside to jump off , only to find that the boat is surrounded by water . She is spotted by the tourists , who believe her to be a ship cat , and the captain shuts her in a cupboard . Let off the boat , she notices that the captain looks lonely and sad . When she sneaks back onto the boat , she begins to attract many customers to the boat service as " Brownie the Famous Ship 's Cat , " gaining the affection of the captain . One night , she even prevents two saboteurs from burning the boat . 
 One day when the boat is out , Sasha finds a bag with a very young cat inside it in the water . The captain takes him home and names him Patch . The spring thaw arrives , and the captain ties up the boat and prepares to go elsewhere . Sasha decides not to go with the captain and Patch because she now knows that she is going to have kits , and wants them born in the forest . Patch and the captain are sad , but they understand . 
 = = = = = Return to the Clans = = = = = 
 Sasha has gone back to the forest to raise her three kits , Hawk , Moth , and Tadpole . While hunting for her kits , she is caught by a ShadowClan patrol . Afraid that they will take her kits , she lies and says they died from the cold . Afterwards , she lets her kits play outside , but when they go back in , she tells them about Ken . 
 Later , she lets them outside again , but this time , <unk> walks in on them . Instead of forcing her to give them up to ShadowClan , she instead helps Sasha by giving her some prey , and warns her to leave as soon as possible . Later on , Sasha goes out hunting and the kits go out to find Ken because they want to make their mother happy . 
 Meanwhile , Sasha has come back to find her kits gone . The kits go into an abandoned house . Sasha , still trying to find the three , gets confronted by BloodClan warriors , but is able to trick them into fear by telling them she is a Clan warrior out looking for revenge of Tigerstar 's death , and the BloodClan cats end up pointing out the direction they saw the kits go . 
 In the basement , a pipe blows and water leaks rapidly from it . Sasha rescues Hawk and Moth , but Tadpole doesn 't make it out of the flooding basement . That night , a devastated Sasha dreams of Tigerstar and asks if Tadpole is with him . Tigerstar says no , but confides that he is safe . Sasha later meets with Pine , a loner she had previously met , and he takes her and the kits to a barn where another she @-@ cat lives . 
 After Pine leaves , Sasha is attacked by the queen while Hawk and Moth are attacked by the she @-@ cat 's kits , but Sasha beats her . She leaves with the kits and decides to take them to RiverClan . In the outskirts of RiverClan territory , Sasha tells the kits who their father is and says that it is their secret . Sasha tells RiverClan that she and her kits wish to become warriors . 
 When they get back to camp , the kits get their apprentice names , but Sasha refuses to take a warrior name . Not long into their apprenticeships , <unk> and <unk> see other kits from the nursery pretending to be Tigerstar and kill everybody . They ask Sasha why they acted like that about him . Sasha tells them the truth about him and makes them promise again that that was their little secret . 
 Later , <unk> and <unk> discover the remnants of the Bonehill , a hill of bones that Tigerstar created in the events of The Darkest Hour . In the end , Sasha decides Clan life is not for her , and she also realizes that her kits are far safer and happier here than with her , so she leaves , but her kits stay .

 = = Inspiration and origins = = 
 The series first began when publisher HarperCollins asked Victoria Holmes to write a fantasy series about feral cats . Initially , Holmes was not very enthusiastic , since she " couldn 't imagine coming up with enough ideas " . She worked with the concept , however , expanding the storyline with elements of war , politics , revenge , doomed love , and religious conflict . Although the original plan was a stand @-@ alone novel , enough material was created for several books , and the publisher decided on a six @-@ volume series . The first volume , Into the Wild , was written by Kate Cary under the pseudonym " Erin Hunter " and was completed in about three months . Holmes then began to work behind the scenes , editing and supervising details . Cherith Baldry joined the team to write the third book , Forest of Secrets . Later , after she wrote the first Warriors field guide , Tui Sutherland became the fourth Erin Hunter . 
 The authors have named several other authors as sources of inspiration when writing the novels . In an online author chat , Cherith Baldry listed the authors that inspire her as including Tolkien , Ursula K. Le Guin , and Shakespeare . In the same chat , Victoria Holmes stated that Jacqueline Wilson , Kathy Reichs , and J. K. Rowling are some of the authors that inspire her . According to the official website , other authors who have inspired the writers include Enid Blyton , Lucy Daniels , Ellis Peters , Tess <unk> , Kate Ellis , Lisa Gardiner , and Meg Cabot . The authors have also mentioned several other sources of inspiration . The New Forest in southern England was the base for the forest where the original series took place . Other influential locations include Loch Lomond , as well as the Scottish Highlands . Nicholas Culpeper , a physician who used materials occurring in the natural world as medicine , also had an influence on the Warriors series . His book , Culpeper 's Herbal , is used as a source by the authors for the herbal remedies that the cats use in the books . In addition , the authors suggested that they may use some fan @-@ created names in future books . Also mentioned as a source of inspiration was the film series Rambo . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 The first book of the series , Into the Wild , was generally well @-@ received , with reviewers calling it a " spine @-@ tingling , " " thoroughly engrossing " and " exciting ... action @-@ packed adventure . " One reviewer praised the authors for " creating an intriguing world ... and an engaging young hero " , but another criticised the characters and imagined world as being " neither ... consistent nor compelling . " 
 The manga has also earned praise : a reviewer for Children 's Bookwatch noted that Into the Woods " ends on a tense cliffhanger , leaving the reader in anxious anticipation for more . Suitable for readers age ten to one hundred and ten , Warriors Tigerstar & Sasha # 1 : Into the Woods is especially recommended for cat lovers everywhere " . Its sequel , Escape from the Forest , was also well reviewed : a reviewer for Publishers Weekly believed that girls would benefit from reading about Sasha leaving the powerful Tigerstar due to his " growing violence " . The art was also praised , with the reviewer writing that " Hudson 's artwork brings Sasha 's emotional journey to life , showing each moment of fear , anxiety , contentment and joy . The cat 's @-@ eye perspective of many of the panels , in addition , add [ sic ] a dramatic , energizing element to the book " . The reviewer also wrote that " a twist at the end will leave fans eager for the next installment of Sasha 's saga " , and that the book would appeal to young adults trying to find their place in the world . Lisa Goldstein for School Library Journal also gave the book a positive review , writing that the plot would attract new fans and appeal to old fans . The reviewer also wrote that " though the cover claims that this is a ' manga , ' the straightforward illustrations are drawn in a simple , realistic style " . 
 The large number of characters involved in the series has often been seen as a negative point ; though one reviewer compared the " huge cast " to that of a Greek drama , others wrote that it was " hard to follow " and " a little confusing . " The characters have also been criticised as being " somewhat flat " and " limited essentially to each individual 's function within the clan . " 
 As one reviewer put it , the cats in the series are " true to their feline nature , " leading some critics to jokingly comment that the books will " leave readers eyeing Puss a bit nervously " and wondering " what dreams of grandeur may haunt the family cat . " However , this realism also means that the series contains a relatively large amount of violence , with one critic stating that it is " not for the faint of heart . " Several critics have compared Warriors to Brian Jacques ' Redwall series , though one commented that it was " not as elegantly written . " The New York Times called the series a " hit with young readers " , specifically because of its " sprawling universe " , and the series was able to appear on the New York Times Bestseller List for a total of 117 weeks , as of 24 November 2013 . 
 = = = Awards and recognitions = = = 
 Into the Wild was nominated for the Pacific Northwest Library Association 's 2006 Young Reader 's Choice Awards but lost to Christopher Paolini 's Eragon . It was also listed on Booklist 's Top 10 fantasy books for youth in 2003 and was a Book Sense 76 Pick . The Sight was nominated for the best Middle Readers book in Amazon 's Best Books of the Year ( 2007 ) and placed sixth out of the ten nominees , with six percent of the total votes . It was also nominated for the Children 's Choice Book Awards . In 2006 , Warriors also received an honourable mention for the best book series for Publisher Weekly 's " On the Cuff " awards . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Themes in the series often revolve around forbidden love , such as those involving Bluestar and Oakheart , Graystripe and Silverstream , and Leafpool and Crowfeather . These relationships are not allowed for various reasons : some involve medicine cats ( such as Leafpool ) , who cannot have mates , while others develop between cats in different Clans , which is forbidden by the warrior code . Holmes said that another central theme of the series centres on " faith and spirituality " in StarClan . All books in the series feature the influence of StarClan , not just as the cats think of them , but in terms of prophecies delivered by StarClan which inevitably come true . Some scenes take place within StarClan 's realm , with no living cats present as point @-@ of @-@ view characters . Thus the existence of an afterlife and the influence of spirits who have passed on and yet retain their earthly identities is integral to all of the plot arcs in the series . Another idea explored in the novels is the reactions of different faiths when meeting each other . For example , the Tribe of Rushing Water , which believes in different spiritual ancestors than the Clans , is introduced in Moonrise . In an author chat , Holmes explained that the books never say that either of the Clans or the Tribe of Rushing Water is right about faith because both are " equally valid . " This leads to fear and suspicion between them because they are afraid of things they do not understand . Holmes said that " ignorance is a very scary thing ! " Non @-@ belief is also significant in the storylines : <unk> and <unk> do not believe in StarClan . 
 Another theme is that characters can be a mix of good and evil . Holmes has said she is fascinated by these " shades of gray " in personalities . Her example of this was when Bluestar , a noble and honourable cat , gave up her kits for her own ambitions so an evil cat would not take over . Another example she gave of this is how the antagonist Tigerstar , even with all of his faults , is still courageous and fiercely loyal . Similarly , Holmes has also connected the theme to Brambleclaw and how nobody knew whether he was good or evil . A third major theme , often referred to as nature versus nurture , explores whether a person is born the way he or she will be , or if other things shape that . For example , Brambleclaw 's father is the evil Tigerstar , but he eventually demonstrates that despite this , he is not evil himself , despite initial suspicion from Clanmates due to his father 's legacy . This theme ties into the " shades of gray " theme . 
 A reviewer for Publishers Weekly noted that friendship and responsibility are taught to characters in the novels , while <unk> had a reviewer who pointed out the idea that , just as Clan cats shun house cats for their soft life , people should realise that it is necessary to experience hardship in life . A <unk> review noted that one of the themes was that " it doesn 't matter where you come from , only who you are inside " . In Dawn , the importance of cooperation is explored . The four Clans , normally hostile to each other , are forced to work together in order to find a new home . Other themes that have been pointed out deal with family , loss , honour , bravery , death , loyalty , and following rules . 
 Holmes has said that one of the good things about writing a book about cats is that " we can tackle difficult human issues such as death , racial intolerance , and religious intolerance [ without seeming so heavy ] . "

Starlight , Twilight , and Sunset from The New Prophecy , as well as the first four Omen of the Stars books , are available in an audiobook format . The The New Prophecy audiobooks are spoken by Nanette Savard , whose performance has been praised by reviewers . A reviewer for AudioFile wrote : " Nanette Savard brings out the youth of the cats who are struggling to help their clan survive and to protect each other from outside danger .

 = SMS Pillau = 
 SMS Pillau was a light cruiser ordered by the Imperial Russian navy under the name Maraviev Amurskyy from the Schichau @-@ Werke shipyard in Danzig in 1913 and launched in April 1914 . Following the outbreak of World War I , the ship was confiscated in August 1914 and renamed SMS Pillau in honor of the East Prussian port of Pillau ( now Baltiysk , Russia ) . The ship was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet in December 1914 . The lead ship of her class , she had one sister ship , Elbing . She was armed with a main battery of eight 15 cm SK L / 45 guns and had a top speed of 27 @.@ 5 kn ( 50 @.@ 9 km / h ; 31 @.@ 6 mph ) . 
 Pillau spent the majority of her career in the II Scouting Group , and saw service in both the Baltic and North Seas . In August 1915 , she participated in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga against the Russian Navy , and on 31 May – 1 June 1916 , she saw significant action at the Battle of Jutland .

She assisted the badly damaged battlecruiser SMS Seydlitz reach port on 2 June after the conclusion of the battle . She also took part in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight , though was not damaged in the engagement . Pillau was assigned to the planned , final operation of the High Seas Fleet in the closing weeks of the war , but a large scale mutiny forced it to be canceled . 
 After the end of the war , Pillau was ceded to Italy as a war prize in 1920 . Renamed Bari , she was commissioned in the Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) in January 1924 . She was modified and rebuilt several times over the next two decades .

 Following her commissioning , Pillau was assigned to the II Scouting Group . Her first major operation was the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915 . A significant detachment from the High Seas Fleet , including eight dreadnoughts and three battlecruisers , went into the Baltic to clear the Gulf of Riga of Russian naval forces . On 13 August , Russian submarines fired three torpedoes at the ship , all of which missed . Pillau participated in the second attack on 16 August , led by the dreadnoughts Nassau and Posen . The minesweepers cleared the Russian minefields by the 20th , allowing the German squadron to enter the Gulf . The Russians had by this time withdrawn to Moon Sound , and the threat of Russian submarines and mines in the Gulf prompted the Germans to retreat . The major units of the High Seas Fleet were back in the North Sea before the end of August .

 In May 1916 , Admiral Reinhard Scheer , the fleet commander , planned to lure a portion of the British fleet away from its bases and destroy it with the entire High Seas Fleet . Pillau remained in the II Scouting Group , attached to the I Scouting Group , for the operation . The squadron left the Jade roadstead at 02 : 00 on 31 May , bound for the waters of the Skagerrak . The main body of the fleet followed an hour and a half later . Shortly before 15 : 30 , the opposing cruiser screens engaged ; Elbing was the first German cruiser to encounter the British . Pillau and Frankfurt steamed to assist , and at 16 : 12 they began firing on HMS Galatea and Phaeton at a range of 16 @,@ 300 yards ( 14 @,@ 900 m ) . As the British ships turned away , the German shells fell short , and at 16 : 17 , Pillau and Frankfurt checked their fire . About fifteen minutes later , the three cruisers engaged a seaplane launched by the seaplane tender HMS Engadine . They failed to score any hits , but the aircraft was forced off after which its engine broke down and it was forced to land . The three cruisers then returned to their stations ahead of the German battlecruisers . 
 Shortly before 17 : 00 , the British 5th Battle Squadron had arrived on the scene , and at 16 : 50 they spotted Pillau , Elbing , and Frankfurt . Eight minutes later , the powerful battleships HMS Warspite and Valiant opened fire at Pillau at a range of 17 @,@ 000 yards ( 16 @,@ 000 m ) . Several salvos fell close to the German cruisers , prompting them to lay a cloud of smoke and turn away at high speed . About an hour later , the German battlecruisers were attacked by the destroyers Onslow and Moresby , but Pillau , Frankfurt , and the battlecruisers ' secondary guns drove them off . At around 18 : 30 , Pillau and the rest of the II Scouting Group encountered the cruiser HMS Chester ; they opened fire and scored several hits on the ship . As both sides ' cruisers disengaged , Rear Admiral Horace Hood 's three battlecruisers intervened . His flagship HMS Invincible scored a hit on Wiesbaden that exploded in her engine room and disabled the ship . Pillau was also hit by a 12 in ( 300 mm ) shell from HMS Inflexible . The shell exploded below the ship 's chart house ; most of the blast went overboard , but the starboard air supply shaft vented part of the explosion into the second boiler room . All six of the ship 's coal @-@ fired boilers were temporarily disabled , though she could still make 24 kn ( 44 km / h ; 28 mph ) on her four oil @-@ fired boilers , allowing her to escape under cover of heavy fog . By 20 : 30 , three of the six boilers were back in operation , allowing her to steam at 26 kn ( 48 km / h ; 30 mph ) . 
 At around 21 : 20 , the II Scouting Group again encountered the British battlecruisers . As they turned away , Pillau briefly came under fire from the battlecruisers , though to no effect . HMS Lion and Tiger both fired salvos at the ship before turning their attention to the battlecruiser SMS Derfflinger ; Pillau 's official record states that the British shooting was very inaccurate . Pillau and Frankfurt spotted the cruiser Castor and several destroyers shortly before 23 : 00 . They each fired a torpedo at the British cruiser before turning back toward the German line without using their searchlights or guns to avoid drawing the British toward the German battleships . By 04 : 00 on 1 June , the German fleet had evaded the British fleet and reached Horns Reef . At 09 : 30 , Pillau was detached from the fleet to assist the crippled battlecruiser Seydlitz , which was having trouble navigating back to port . Pillau steamed ahead of Seydlitz to guide her back to Wilhelmshaven , but shortly after 10 : 00 , the battlecruiser ran aground off Sylt . After freeing Seydlitz at 10 : 30 , the voyage back resumed , with a division of minesweepers steaming ahead testing the depth to prevent another grounding . Seydlitz continued to take on water and sink lower in the water ; she turned around and steamed in reverse in an attempt to improve the situation . Pillau also attempted to tow the battlecruiser , but was unable because the line repeatedly snapped . A pair of pumping steamers arrived in the evening , and slow progress was made through the night , with Pillau still guiding the voyage . The ships reached the outer Jade lightship at 08 : 30 and anchored twenty minutes later . In the course of the engagement , Pillau had fired 113 rounds of 15 cm ammunition and four 8 @.@ 8 cm shells . She also launched one torpedo . Her crew suffered four men killed and twenty @-@ three wounded .

 In July 1917 , a series of mutinies occurred on several ships of the fleet , including Pillau . While the ship was in harbor in Wilhelmshaven on the 20th , a group of 137 men left the ship to protest a cancellation of their leave . After a couple of hours in the town , the men returned to the ship and began to complete the tasks they had been ordered to do that morning as a show of good will . Pillau 's commander did not take the event seriously , and ordered a limited punishment for the crewmen who had staged the protest . By late 1917 , Pillau had been assigned to the IV Scouting Group , along with Stralsund and Regensburg . In late October 1917 , the IV Scouting Group steamed to Pillau , arriving on the 30th . They were tasked with replacing the heavy units of the fleet that had just completed Operation Albion , the conquest of the islands in the Gulf of Riga , along with the battleships of the I Battle Squadron . The risk of mines that had come loose in a recent storm , however , prompted the naval command to cancel the mission , and Pillau and the rest of the IV Scouting Group was ordered to return to the North Sea on 31 October . 
 Upon returning the North Sea , Pillau returned to the II Scouting Group . On 17 November , the four cruisers of the II Scouting Group , supported by the battleships Kaiser and Kaiserin , covered a minesweeping operation in the North Sea . They were attacked by British cruisers , supported by battlecruisers and battleships , in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight . Königsberg , the II Scouting Group flagship , was damaged in the engagement , but the four cruisers managed to pull away from the British , drawing them toward the German dreadnoughts . They in turn forced the British to break off the attack ; neither side had significant success in the operation . Pillau emerged from the battle unscathed . On 23 – 24 April 1918 , the ship participated in an abortive fleet operation to attack British convoys to Norway . The I Scouting Group and II Scouting Group , along with the Second Torpedo @-@ Boat Flotilla were to attack a heavily guarded British convoy to Norway , with the rest of the High Seas Fleet steaming in support . The Germans failed to locate the convoy , which had in fact sailed the day before the fleet left port . As a result , Admiral Reinhard Scheer broke off the operation and returned to port . 
 In October 1918 , Pillau and the rest of the II Scouting Group were to lead a final attack on the British navy . Pillau , Cöln , Dresden , and Königsberg were to attack merchant shipping in the Thames estuary while Karlsruhe , Nürnberg , and Graudenz were to bombard targets in Flanders , to draw out the British Grand Fleet . Admirals Reinhard Scheer and Franz von Hipper intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy , in order to secure a better bargaining position for Germany , whatever the cost to the fleet . On the morning of 29 October 1918 , the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day . Starting on the night of 29 October , sailors on Thüringen and then on several other battleships mutinied . The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation .

 Pillau briefly served in the newly reorganized Reichsmarine following the end of the war . She was stricken on 5 November 1919 and surrendered to the Allies in the French port of Cherbourg on 20 July 1920 . She was ceded to Italy as a war prize under the name " U " . She was renamed Bari and commissioned into the Regia Marina on 21 January 1924 . The 8 @.@ 8 cm anti @-@ aircraft guns were replaced with 76 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) / 40 guns . On 19 July 1929 , she was reclassified as a cruiser . In 1933 – 1934 , Bari was refitted for colonial service and converted to oil @-@ firing . The six coal @-@ fired boilers were removed to allow for additional oil bunker space , and the forward funnel was removed and the remaining two were cut down . This reduced her power to 21 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 16 @,@ 000 kW ) and a top speed of 24 @.@ 5 kn ( 45 @.@ 4 km / h ; 28 @.@ 2 mph ) . Her cruising range was increased considerably , from 2 @,@ 600 nmi ( 4 @,@ 800 km ; 3 @,@ 000 mi ) at 14 kn ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) to 4 @,@ 000 nmi ( 7 @,@ 400 km ; 4 @,@ 600 mi ) at that speed . 
 By the outbreak of World War II in 1939 , her armament had been increased by six 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) guns and six 13 @.@ 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 52 in ) machine guns . Her wartime career was in support of landings at Corfu in 1940 and Bastia in 1942 and anti @-@ partisan bombardments off the Montenegrin coast in 1942 . In early 1943 , she was slated for conversion to an anti @-@ aircraft ship . She was to be rearmed with six 90 mm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) / 50 guns , eight 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns , and eight new model 20 mm / 65 or / 70 machine guns . On 28 June , however , American bombers badly damaged Bari at Livorno and she sank in shallow water two days later . At the Italian armistice in September 1943 , she was further damaged to render her useless to the German occupiers . The wreck was partially scrapped by the Germans in 1944 . She was officially removed from the navy list on 27 February 1947 , and raised on 13 January 1948 for scrapping .

 Rugal Bernstein ( ルガール ・ <unk> , Rugāru <unk> ) is a video game character created by SNK . First introduced in The King of Fighters ' 94 , he is a recurring boss in the The King of Fighters fighting game series . As the host of the tournaments from The King of Fighters ' 94 and ' 95 , Rugal plans to turn all the competitors from the tournament into stone statues as part of his collection . Despite his death in ' 95 , Rugal is still featured in following The King of Fighters titles which do not contain a storyline ( nicknamed " Dream Matches " ) . He has also been featured in the SNK Vs . Capcom as a boss character . 
 His character has also appeared in other media related to The King of Fighters franchise , including comic adaptations and The King of Fighters live @-@ action film , and portrayed by British martial arts actor Ray Park . As the first boss character from The King of Fighters , the SNK staff created him to be one of the most difficult characters to defeat . His Omega Rugal form from ' 95 has been noted by the staff to be their favorite boss to the point they added him in the Dream Match titles . Publications for video games and other media have provided praise and criticism for Rugal 's character . 
 = = Conception and design = = 
 The concept for making Rugal in The King of Fighters ' 94 was to make " the mightiest ( most violent ) and most evil boss character ever " . Despite the difficulties in defeating him , Rugal has become the boss character with the biggest number of appearances in The King of Fighters series as he has been liked by players and developers . Due to his multiple " deaths " in the series , developers have joked with him , adding to his official profile that his hobby is resurrection . Flagship director , Toyohisa Tanabe , states that his fighting style was created to emphasize Rugal 's strength as the series ' first boss character . He also comments " going a bit overboard " with his Genocide Cutter technique damage ratio in The King of Fighters ' 94 . His Dead @-@ End Screamer special move was originally a technique in which Rugal breaks the neck of his opponent and crushes it . However , it was seen as lacking drama , so it evolved into a move in which he breaks his victim 's neck , crushes the victim , and then further spins the victim around to do more damage , striking a pose at the end of the move . In The King of Fighters ' 95 , Rugal appears as an enhanced version named Omega Rugal ; developers liked him so much that they added him as the boss character in dream matches ( KOF games with no storyline ) , commenting " He 's the only character who truly represents the ultimate KOF boss " . His The King of Fighters ' 98 move set was noted to be strongest of all his appearances , becoming the developers ' favorite boss character . 
 Rugal is 1 @.@ 97 m ( 6 ft 6 in ) tall , and weighs 103 kilograms ( 227 lb ) . In his first appearance in King of Fighters ' 94 , Rugal is shown wearing red formal clothes and with his right eye covered , having lost it in a previous confrontation . After his initial defeat , Rugal appears in a battle outfit composed of a sleeveless green shirt , but still keep his red pants .

His body is much bigger in this form , his skin becomes darker while his hair appears gray . From his right eye it appears a red light , and is shown using a prosthetic in his right hand 's place . In following games from the series , Rugal 's Omega form appears wearing his battle suit from King of Fighters ' 94 . In the SNK Vs . Capcom video games , he is featured in his formal clothes in both his common and god form .

 Voiced by Toshimitsu Arai in most titles , Rugal makes his first appearance as the boss character from King of Fighters ' 94 . The plot from the game introduces Rugal as an incredibly rich arms and drugs trafficker who organizes a King of Fighters tournament to reunite the strongest fighters from all the world . Once the player meets Rugal , he will reveal that he wants to turn his victims into stone statues to add them to his collection of fighters . Once defeated by Kyo Kusanagi and his teammates , Rugal self @-@ destructs his ship to kill his opponents , but fails .

After Saisyu is knocked unconscious , Rugal proceeds to fight as the boss character , in an enhanced form named Omega Rugal ( <unk> ・ ルガール , Omega Rugāru ) . However , once defeated , he is unable to control his new powers and his body is destroyed . Although Rugal is not featured in The King of Fighters ' 96 , the new tournament organizer mentions that the man responsible for taking Rugal 's right eye and giving him greater power is the game 's antagonist , Goenitz . 
 Since appearing in King of Fighters ' 95 , Omega Rugal has appeared in later SNK @-@ produced titles , serving as the final boss for both The King of Fighters ' 98 and The King of Fighters 2002 , destroying his ship in the former and disintegrating in the latter when defeated . Omega Rugal also appears as a boss character in several other King of Fighters titles , including The King of Fighters 2002 : Unlimited Match and The King of Fighters : Neowave , with different criteria for the character to appear in each . In The King of Fighters 2000 , Rugal appears as a non @-@ playable assistant character ( dubbed a " striker " ) to Kula Diamond . Arai reprises his role as the character 's voice actor in each appearance , with the exception of the original King of Fighters 2002 in which the character is voiced by Norio Wakamoto , who voices Igniz from King of Fighters 2001 . 
 In Capcom vs. SNK 2 , in addition to his normal form Rugal appears as a new , enhanced version of himself named God Rugal ( ゴッド ・ ルガール , <unk> Rugāru ) , serving as an optional final boss . Renamed " Ultimate Rugal " in English localizations , the character is the result of Rugal defeating Street Fighter character Akuma and absorbing his powers .

He also played for English Conference South club St Albans City in pre @-@ season before Falkirk received international clearance to play him in September 2004 . McBreen made his debut as a seventy @-@ third minute substitute for Andy Thomson in a 3 – 0 home win over Gretna in the Scottish Challenge Cup on 14 September 2004 . He came on as a seventy @-@ second @-@ minute substitute for Thomson in the 2004 Scottish Challenge Cup Final , in which Falkirk beat Ross County 2 – 1 at McDiarmid Park on 7 November 2004 . His first goal came on his first start for the club , with a shot from eight yards seconds before half @-@ time , as Falkirk beat Raith Rovers 2 – 0 away on 13 November 2004 .

He finished 2004 – 05 with thirteen goals from twenty @-@ six matches as Falkirk were promoted to the Scottish Premier League as Scottish First Division champions . His thirteen league goals saw him ranked as the division 's fourth highest scorer . 
 McBreen signed a new one @-@ year contract with Falkirk in June 2005 , and manager John Hughes predicted " With a good pre @-@ season under his belt , I 'm sure he 'll get even better " . He scored his first goal of the 2005 – 06 season in the eighty @-@ third minute of a home match against champions Rangers on 10 September 2005 , with a header from an Alan Gow cross that secured Falkirk a 1 – 1 draw . McBreen scored the only goal in Falkirk 's 1 – 0 win over Livingston on 6 May 2006 with a header from Gow 's free kick , which was only the team 's second victory at home all season . He appeared more frequently in 2005 – 06 , making thirty @-@ eight appearances but only scoring eight goals , with Falkirk ranking in tenth place in the Scottish Premier League table . Despite taking over the main striking role after Duffy 's transfer to Hull City in January 2006 , McBreen was released by the club in May . 
 He went on trial with English League One clubs Northampton Town , Brighton & Hove Albion and Scunthorpe United , signing for the latter on a two @-@ year contract on 30 August 2006 . He made his debut two days later starting a 2 – 0 away victory over Gillingham , but due to a hamstring injury that kept him out of action for ten months his last appearance of the 2006 – 07 season came in November 2006 . He made ten appearances for a Scunthorpe team that won promotion to the Championship as 2006 – 07 League One champions .

 McBreen joined Conference Premier team York City on a one @-@ month loan , with the option of a possible extension , on 5 October 2007 . His York debut came in a 4 – 1 home defeat to Histon a day later and scored his first goal in the following game against Stafford Rangers , with a header from a Martyn Woolford cross in a 2 – 0 home victory . After making five appearances and scoring two goals he was recalled by Scunthorpe on 5 November 2007 due to the departure of on @-@ loan Millwall striker Ben May . Despite this , York manager Billy McEwan was interested in bringing McBreen back to the club for another loan spell . He bought out the remainder of his Scunthorpe contract to join St Johnstone of the Scottish First Division on 2 January 2008 on a deal until the end of the season . His debut came the same day in a 1 – 1 home draw with Dundee , which he entered as a sixty @-@ second @-@ minute substitute for Liam Craig . He suffered a knee injury during this match , and this hampered his progress at the club . On 20 April 2008 , McBreen scored the opening goal with a back @-@ post header from Paul Sheerin 's cross in St Johnstone 's Scottish Cup semi @-@ final against Rangers at Hampden Park in extra time , which they eventually lost in a penalty shoot @-@ out .

His first game back at the club was a 1 – 0 away victory over Crawley Town and in his third appearance he scored his first goal of the 2008 – 09 season with a left @-@ footed shot from seventeen yards in a 1 – 1 home draw with Histon . McBreen was played primarily as a lone striker in away matches during 2008 – 09 , a decision which York manager Colin Walker defended in September 2008 ; Dave Flett of The Press commented that he " [ led ] the line lazily " . During February 2009 it was reported in the Australian media that he had agreed join A @-@ League newcomers North Queensland Fury , although York were unaware of any transfer taking place . It was later confirmed that he would join the Fury in August 2009 for the 2009 – 10 A @-@ League , following the expiry of his York contract in June . He had scored in every round of the 2008 – 09 FA Trophy leading up to the final , bar the first round when he was an unused substitute , and ahead of the final commented that : " I couldn 't ask for anything more than a Wembley final to end my career in Europe and it ’ s also a great finale to a disappointing season for the fans and players " . He started in the match at Wembley Stadium on 9 May 2009 , which York lost 2 – 0 to Stevenage Borough . He made forty @-@ eight appearances and scored ten goals with York finishing in 17th place in the 2008 – 09 Conference Premier table .

 = Batman Begins = 
 Batman Begins is a 2005 British @-@ American superhero film based on the fictional DC Comics character Batman , co @-@ written and directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Christian Bale , Michael Caine , Liam Neeson , Katie Holmes , Gary Oldman , Cillian Murphy , Tom Wilkinson , Rutger Hauer , Ken Watanabe , and Morgan Freeman . The film reboots the Batman film series , telling the origin story of the title character ( Bale ) , from his alter ego Bruce Wayne 's initial fear of bats , the death of his parents , his journey to become Batman , and his fight to stop Ra 's al Ghul ( Neeson ) and the Scarecrow ( Murphy ) from plunging Gotham City into chaos . It draws inspiration from classic comic book storylines such as The Man Who Falls , Batman : Year One , and Batman : The Long Halloween . 
 After a series of unsuccessful projects to resurrect Batman on screen following the critical failure and box office disappointment of Batman & Robin ( 1997 ) , Nolan and David S. Goyer began to work on the film in early 2003 and aimed for a darker and more realistic tone , with humanity and realism being the basis of the film . The goal was to get the audience to care for both Batman and Bruce Wayne . The film , which was primarily shot in Iceland and Chicago , relied on traditional stunts and miniatures , while computer @-@ generated imagery was used minimally . 
 Batman Begins opened on June 15 , 2005 , in the United States and Canada in 3 @,@ 858 theaters . It grossed over $ 48 million in its opening weekend in North America , eventually grossing over $ 374 million worldwide . The film received positive reviews and is considered by many to be one of the best superhero films of the 2000s . The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography and three BAFTA awards . It is followed by The Dark Knight ( 2008 ) and The Dark Knight Rises ( 2012 ) in a continual story @-@ arc , which has later been referred to as The Dark Knight Trilogy . 
 = = Plot = = 
 As a child , Bruce Wayne falls down a dry well and is attacked by a swarm of bats , subsequently developing a phobia of the creatures . While watching an opera with his parents , Thomas and Martha , Bruce becomes frightened by performers masquerading as bats and asks to leave . Outside , mugger Joe Chill murders Bruce 's parents in front of him . Orphaned , Bruce is raised by the family butler , Alfred Pennyworth . 
 Fourteen years later , Chill is freed in exchange for testifying against Gotham City mafia boss Carmine Falcone . Bruce intends to murder Chill , but one of Falcone 's assassins does so first . Bruce 's childhood friend , assistant district attorney Rachel Dawes , berates him for attempting to undermine the justice system , saying that his father would be ashamed . Bruce confronts Falcone , who tells him that real power comes from being feared . Bruce decides to travel the world and learn how to confront injustice . In Bhutan , he meets Henri Ducard , who trains him as a member of the League of Shadows , led by Ra 's al Ghul . After completing his training and purging his fears , Bruce learns that the League intends to destroy Gotham , believing it to be corrupt and beyond saving . Bruce rejects the League 's cause and burns down their temple during his escape . Ra 's is killed by falling debris , while Bruce saves the unconscious Ducard . 
 Bruce returns to Gotham intent on fighting crime . Inspired by his childhood fear , he takes up the vigilante identity of " the Batman " and sets up a base in the caves beneath Wayne Manor . He takes an interest in his family 's company , Wayne Enterprises , now run by the unscrupulous William Earle . Company archivist Lucius Fox allows Bruce access to prototype defense technologies including a protective bodysuit and a heavily armored car called the Tumbler . Bruce poses as a shallow playboy to allay suspicion . 
 Batman intercepts a drug shipment , provides Rachel with evidence against Falcone , and enlists Sergeant James Gordon , one of the few honest cops left in Gotham , to arrest him . In prison , Falcone meets with Dr. Jonathan Crane , a corrupt psychiatrist who has been helping him smuggle drugs into Gotham , and threatens to reveal his complicity if he does not declare him mentally unfit for trial . Crane puts on a scarecrow mask and sprays Falcone with a fear @-@ inducing hallucinogen that drives him insane , and has him transferred to Arkham Asylum . While investigating " the Scarecrow " , Batman is exposed to the hallucinogen and left incapacitated . He is saved by Alfred and given an antidote developed by Fox . When Rachel accuses Crane of corruption , Crane reveals that he has been pouring his fear @-@ inducing drug into Gotham 's water supply . He doses Rachel with it , but Batman saves her and subdues Crane , who claims to work for Ra 's al Ghul . Batman evades the police to get Rachel to safety , administers the antidote , and gives her a vial of it for Gordon and another for mass production . Ducard reappears at Bruce 's birthday party and reveals himself to be the actual Ra 's al Ghul . Having stolen a powerful microwave emitter from Wayne Enterprises , he plans to vaporize Gotham 's water supply , rendering Crane 's drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city . He sets Wayne Manor on fire and leaves Bruce for dead , but Alfred rescues him . 
 Ra 's loads the microwave emitter onto Gotham 's monorail system , releasing the drug as the train travels toward the city 's central water source . Batman rescues Rachel from a drugged mob and indirectly reveals his identity to her . He pursues Ra 's onto the monorail and fights him just as Gordon uses the Tumbler 's cannons to destroy a section of the track . Batman refuses to kill Ra 's , but also chooses not to save him , gliding from the train and leaving Ra 's aboard as it crashes and explodes . 
 Bruce gains Rachel 's respect but loses her love , as she decides she cannot be with him while he is Batman . Bruce buys a controlling stake in the now publicly traded Wayne Enterprises , fires Earle , and replaces him with Fox . Gordon is promoted to Lieutenant of the Gotham City Police Department , shows Batman the Bat @-@ Signal , and mentions a criminal who leaves Joker playing cards at crime scenes . Batman promises to investigate , and disappears into the night .

 Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman : 
 A billionaire socialite who witnesses his parents ' deaths at the hands of a mugger when he is eight years old , and later travels the world for seven years to seek the means to fight injustice before returning to Gotham City , becoming its bat @-@ masked vigilante protector at night . Before Bale was confirmed on September 11 , 2003 , having expressed interest in the role since Darren Aronofsky was planning his own film adaptation , Eion Bailey , Henry Cavill , Billy Crudup , Hugh Dancy , Jake Gyllenhaal , Joshua Jackson , Heath Ledger , David Boreanaz and Cillian Murphy took interest in it as well . Amy Adams served as the casting reader for the casting of Bruce Wayne / Batman in a favor to the casting director . Bale felt the previous films underused Batman 's character , overplaying the villains instead . To best pose as Batman , Bale studied graphic novels and illustrations of the superhero . Director Nolan said of Bale , " He has exactly the balance of darkness and light that we were looking for . " Goyer stated that while some actors could play a great Bruce Wayne or a great Batman , Bale could portray both radically different personalities . Bale described the part as playing four characters : the raging Batman persona ; the shallow playboy façade Bruce uses to ward off suspicion ; the vengeful young man ; and the older , angrier Bruce who is discovering his purpose in life . Bale 's dislike of his costume , which heated up regularly , helped him get into a necessarily foul mood . He said , " Batman 's meant to be fierce , and you become a beast in that suit , as Batman should be – not a man in a suit , but a different creature . " Since he had lost a great deal of weight in preparation for his role in The Machinist , Bale hired a personal trainer to help him gain 100 pounds ( 45 kg ) in the span of only a couple of months to help him physically prepare for the role . He first went well over the weight required and created concern over whether he would look right for the part . Bale recognized that his large physique was not appropriate for Batman , who relies on speed and strategy . He lost the excess weight by the time filming <unk> Lewis as Young Bruce Wayne . 
 Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth : 
 A trusted butler to Bruce 's parents , who continues his loyal service to their son after their deaths as his closest confidant . Nolan felt Caine would effectively portray the foster father element of the character . Although Alfred is depicted in the film as having served the Wayne family for generations , Caine created his own backstory , in that before becoming Wayne 's butler , Alfred served in the Special Air Service . After being wounded , he was invited to the position of the Wayne family butler by Thomas Wayne because , " He wanted a butler , but someone a bit tougher than that , you know ? " 
 Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard / Ra 's al Ghul : 
 A mysterious man who trains Bruce in the martial arts by initially posing as a subservient member of the League of Shadows , an ancient organization of injustice whose leader is greatly feared by the criminal underworld , but is later revealed to be the leader himself , having to have used the name " Ducard " as a pseudonym to hide his true identity . Writer David Goyer said he felt he was the most complex of all the Batman villains , comparing him to Osama bin Laden ; " He 's not crazy in the way that all the other Batman villains are . He 's not bent on revenge ; he 's actually trying to heal the world . He 's just doing it by very draconian means . " Gary Oldman was first choice for the part , but ended up playing James Gordon instead . Guy Pearce , who collaborated with Christopher Nolan on Memento ( 2000 ) , reported that the pair had discussions about him playing the role , but both of them decided that he was too young for the part . Neeson is commonly cast as a mentor , so the revelation that his character was the main villain was intended to shock viewers . 
 Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes : 
 Bruce 's childhood friend and love interest who serves as Gotham City 's assistant district attorney , fighting against corruption in the city . Nolan found a " tremendous warmth and great emotional appeal " in Holmes , and also felt " she has a maturity beyond her years that comes across in the film and is essential to the idea that Rachel is something of a moral conscience for Bruce " <unk> Lockhart as Young Rachel Dawes . 
 Gary Oldman as Sgt. James Gordon : 
 One of the few uncorrupted Gotham City police officers , who is on duty the night of the murder of Bruce 's parents and , in this way , shares a special bond with the adult Bruce and thus with Batman . Oldman was Nolan 's first choice for Ra 's al Ghul , but when Chris Cooper turned down the part of Gordon to spend time with his family Nolan decided that it would be refreshing for Oldman , who is renowned for his portrayals of villains , to play the role instead . " I embody the themes of the movie which are the values of family , courage and compassion and a sense of right and wrong , good and bad and justice , " Oldman said of his character . He filmed most of his scenes in Britain . Goyer said Oldman heavily resembled Gordon as drawn by David Mazzucchelli in Batman : Year One . 
 Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane / Scarecrow : 
 A corrupt <unk> working as Chief Administrator of Arkham Asylum , who develops a fear @-@ inducing toxin from a flower that grows in Ra 's al Ghul 's sanctuary and takes up the persona of a <unk> @-@ proof burlap @-@ masked external tormentor portraying himself as a " master of fear " , using his patients as human guinea pigs for his experiments on the toxin while working with Ra 's to smuggle its drug ingredients into Gotham using Carmine Falcone . Nolan decided against casting an Irish actor like Murphy for Batman , before casting him as Scarecrow . Murphy read numerous comics featuring the Scarecrow , and discussed making the character look less theatrical with Nolan . Murphy explained , " I wanted to avoid the <unk> <unk> look , because he 's not a very physically imposing man – he 's more interested in the manipulation of the mind and what that can do . " 
 Tom Wilkinson as Carmine Falcone : 
 The most powerful Mafia boss in Gotham , who shares a prison cell with Joe Chill after Chill murdered Bruce 's parents and later , after having Chill murdered for his decision to testify against their relationship , goes into business with Dr. Jonathan Crane and Ra 's al Ghul by smuggling in Crane 's fear toxins through his drug shipments over the course of several months so that they can be mixed in with the city 's water supply . 
 Rutger Hauer as William Earle : 
 The CEO of Wayne Enterprises , who takes the company public in Bruce 's long @-@ term absence . 
 Ken Watanabe as Ra 's al Ghul 's Decoy : 
 A member of the League of Shadows assigned to impersonate Ra 's al Ghul during Bruce 's training . 
 Mark Boone Junior as Detective Arnold <unk> : 
 Gordon 's corrupt partner , operating in Falcone 's pockets . 
 Linus Roache as Thomas Wayne : 
 Bruce 's late father , who is mugged and murdered along with his wife in an alley in front of their son . 
 Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox : 
 A high @-@ ranking Wayne Enterprises employee demoted to working in the company 's Applied Science Division , where he conducts advanced studies in biochemistry and mechanical engineering and supplies Bruce with much of the gear necessary to carry out Batman 's mission , yet is promoted to CEO when Bruce takes control of the company by the end of the film . 
 Other cast members include Larry Holden as district attorney Carl Finch ; Colin McFarlane as Police commissioner Gillian B. Loeb ; Christine Adams as Jessica , Lucius Fox 's secretary ; Sara Stewart as Martha Wayne , Bruce 's late mother ; Richard Brake as Joe Chill , the <unk> ' killer ; Gerard Murphy as the corrupt High Court Judge Faden ; Charles Edwards as a Wayne Enterprises executive ; Tim Booth as Victor Zsasz ; Rade Šerbedžija as a homeless man , who is the last person to meet Bruce when he leaves Gotham , and the first civilian to see Batman , and both <unk> Cooper and Andrew <unk> as uniformed policemen . Jack Gleeson , who previously co @-@ starred with Bale in 2002 's Reign of Fire and later found fame for his role as Joffrey Baratheon in the HBO series Game of Thrones , appears as a boy who idolises Batman and is later saved by him from Ra 's al Ghul 's men . Actors John Foo , Joey Ansah , Spencer Wilding , Dave <unk> , Khan Bonfils , Rodney Ryan and Dean Alexandrou portray members of the League of Shadows .

 In January 2003 , Warner Bros. hired Memento director Christopher Nolan to direct an untitled Batman film , and David S. Goyer signed on to write the script two months later . Nolan stated his intention to reinvent the film franchise of Batman by " doing the origins story of the character , which is a story that 's never been told before " . Nolan said that humanity and realism would be the basis of the origin film , and that " the world of Batman is that of grounded reality . [ It ] will be a recognizable , contemporary reality against which an extraordinary heroic figure arises . " Goyer said that the goal of the film was to get the audience to care for both Batman and Bruce Wayne . Nolan felt the previous films were exercises in style rather than drama , and described his inspiration as being Richard Donner 's 1978 film Superman , in its focus on depicting the character 's growth . Also similar to Superman , Nolan wanted an all @-@ star supporting cast for Batman Begins to lend a more epic feel and credibility to the story . 
 Nolan 's personal " jumping off point " of inspiration was " The Man Who Falls " , a short story by Denny O 'Neil and Dick Giordano about Bruce 's travels throughout the world . The early scene in Batman Begins of young Bruce Wayne falling into a well was adapted from " The Man Who Falls " . Batman : The Long Halloween , written by Jeph Loeb and drawn by Tim Sale , influenced Goyer in writing the screenplay , with the villain Carmine Falcone as one of many elements which were drawn from Halloween 's " sober , serious approach " . The writers considered having Harvey Dent in the film , but replaced him with the new character Rachel Dawes when they realized they " couldn 't do him justice " . The character was later portrayed by Aaron Eckhart in the 2008 sequel The Dark Knight . The sequel to Halloween , Batman : Dark Victory , also served as an influence . Goyer used the vacancy of Bruce Wayne 's multi @-@ year absence presented in Batman : Year One to help set up some of the film 's events in the transpiring years . In addition , the film 's Sergeant James Gordon was based on his comic book incarnation as seen in Year One . The writers of Batman Begins also used Frank Miller 's Year One plot device , which was about a corrupt police force that led to Gordon and Gotham City 's need for Batman . 
 A common idea in the comics is that Bruce saw a Zorro film with his parents before they were murdered . Nolan explained that by ignoring that idea – which he stated is not found in Batman 's first appearances – it emphasized the importance of bats to Bruce and that becoming a superhero is a wholly original idea on his part . It is for this reason Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of his film ; otherwise , Wayne 's reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would have been very different . 
 At his audition , Bale wore the bat suit ( minus the cape which has been missing for some time ) Val Kilmer donned for 1995 's Batman Forever . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 As with all his films , Nolan refused a second unit ; he did this in order to keep his vision consistent . Filming began in March 2004 in the Vatnajökull glacier in Iceland ( standing in for Bhutan ) . The crew built a village and the front doors to Ra 's ' temple , as well as a road to access the remote area . The weather was problematic , with 75 miles per hour ( 121 km / h ) winds , rain , and a lack of snow . A shot Wally Pfister had planned to take using a crane had to be done with a handheld camera . 
 In seeking inspiration from Superman and other blockbuster films of the late 1970s and early 1980s , Nolan based most of the production in England , specifically Shepperton Studios . A Batcave set was built there and measured 250 feet ( 76 m ) long , 120 feet ( 37 m ) wide , and 40 feet ( 12 m ) high . Production designer Nathan Crowley installed twelve pumps to create a waterfall with 12 @,@ 000 imperial gallons ( 55 @,@ 000 l ; 14 @,@ 000 US gal ) , and built rocks using molds of real caves . In January 2004 , an airship hangar at Cardington , Bedfordshire was rented by Warner Bros. during April 2004 and , converted into a 900 feet ( 270 m ) sound stage , was where the slum @-@ district of " the Narrows " and the feet of the monorails were filmed . 
 Mentmore Towers was chosen from twenty different locations for Wayne Manor , as Nolan and Crowley liked its white floors , which gave the impression of the manor as a memorial to Wayne 's parents . The building chosen to represent Arkham Asylum was the National Institute for Medical Research building in Mill Hill , northwest London , England . The St Pancras railway station and the Abbey Mills Pumping Stations were used for Arkham 's interiors . University College London was used for courtrooms . Some scenes , including the Tumbler pursuit , were filmed in Chicago at locations such as Lower Wacker Drive and 35 East Wacker . Authorities agreed to raise Franklin Street Bridge for a scene where access to the Narrows is closed . 
 Despite the film 's darkness , Nolan wanted to make the film appeal to a wide age range . " Not the youngest kids obviously , I think what we 've done is probably a bit intense for them but I certainly didn 't want to exclude the sort of ten to 12 @-@ year olds , because as a kid I would have loved to have seen a movie like this . " Because of this , nothing gory or bloody was filmed . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 Nolan used the 1982 cult science fiction film Blade Runner as a source of inspiration for Batman Begins . He screened Blade Runner to cinematographer Wally Pfister and two others to show the attitude and style that he wanted to draw from the film . Nolan described the film 's world as " an interesting lesson on the technique of exploring and describing a credible universe that doesn 't appear to have any boundaries " , a lesson that he applied to the production of Batman Begins . 
 Nolan worked with production designer Nathan Crowley to create the look of Gotham City . Crowley built a model of the city that filled Nolan 's garage . Crowley and Nolan designed it as a large , modern metropolitan area that would reflect the various periods of architecture that the city had gone through . Elements were drawn from New York City , Chicago , and Tokyo ; the latter for its elevated freeways and monorails . The Narrows was based on the <unk> nature of the ( now demolished ) walled city of Kowloon in Hong Kong . 
 = = = = Tumbler = = = = 
 Crowley started the process of designing the Tumbler for the film by model bashing . Crowley used the nose cone of a P @-@ 38 Lightning model to serve as the chassis for the Tumbler 's turbine engine . Six models of the Tumbler were built to 1 : 12 scale in the course of four months . Following the scale model creation , a crew of over 30 people , including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Annie Smith , carved a full @-@ size replica of the Tumbler out of a large block of Styrofoam in two months . 
 The styrofoam model was used to create a steel " test frame " , which had to stand up to several standards : have a speed of over 100 miles per hour ( 160 km / h ) , go from 0 to 60 miles per hour ( 97 km / h ) in 5 seconds , possess a steering system to make sharp turns at city corners , and withstand a self @-@ propelled launch of up to 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) . On the first jump test , the Tumbler 's front end collapsed and had to be completely rebuilt . The basic configuration of the newly designed Tumbler included a 5 @.@ 7 @-@ liter Chevy V8 engine , a truck axle for the rear axle , front tires by Hoosier ( which are actually dirt racing tires used on the right rear of open wheel sprint cars ) , 4 rear 44 / 18 @.@ 5 @-@ 16 @.@ 5 <unk> Super <unk> <unk> tires ( 44 " tall , 18 @.@ 5 " wide , mounted on a 16 @.@ 5 " wheel ) and the suspension system of Baja racing trucks . The design and development process took nine months and cost several million dollars . 
 With the design process complete , four street @-@ ready race cars were constructed , with each vehicle possessing 65 panels and costing $ 250 @,@ 000 to build . Two of the four cars were specialized versions . One version was the flap version , which had hydraulics and flaps to detail the close @-@ up shots where the vehicle propelled itself through the air . The other version was the jet version , in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto the vehicle , fueled by six propane tanks . The visibility inside the vehicle was poor , so monitors were connected to cameras on the vehicle body . The professional drivers for the <unk> practiced driving the vehicles for six months before they drove on the streets of Chicago for the film 's scenes . 
 The interior of the Tumbler was an immobile studio set and not actually the interior of a street @-@ capable Tumbler . The cockpit was oversized to fit cameras for scenes filmed in the Tumbler interior . In addition , another version of the Tumbler was a miniature model that was 1 : 6 scale of the actual Tumbler . This miniature model had an electric motor and was used to show the Tumbler flying across ravines and between buildings . However , the actual Tumbler was used for the waterfall sequence . 
 = = = = Batsuit = = = = 
 The filmmakers intended to create a very mobile Batsuit that would allow the wearer to move easily to fight and crouch . Previous film incarnations of the Batsuit had been stiff and especially restrictive of full head movement . Costume designer Lindy Hemming and her crew worked on the Batsuit at an FX workshop codenamed " Cape Town " , a secured compound located at Shepperton Studios in London . The Batsuit 's basic design was a neoprene <unk> , which was shaped by attaching molded cream latex sections . Christian Bale was molded and sculpted prior to his physical training so the team could work on a full body cast . To avoid imperfections picked up by sculpting with clay , <unk> was used to smooth the surface . In addition , the team brewed different mixtures of foam to find the mixture that would be the most flexible , light , durable , and black . The latter presented a problem , since the process to make the foam black reduced the foam 's durability . 
 For the cape , director Christopher Nolan wanted to have a " flowing cloak ... that blows and flows as in so many great graphic novels " . Hemming 's team created the cape out of their own version of parachute nylon that had electrostatic flocking , a process shared with the team by the British Ministry of Defence . The process was used by the London police force to minimize night vision detection . The cape was topped by a cowl , which was designed by Nolan , Hemming , and costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard . The cowl was created to be thin enough to allow motion but thick enough to avoid wrinkling when Bale turned his head in the Batsuit . Churchyard explained the cowl had been designed to show " a man who has angst " , so his character would be revealed through the mask . 
 = = = = Fight choreography = = = = 
 The fight choreographers Justo <unk> and Andy Norman , used the Keysi Fighting Method or Keysi , which itself gained fame after it was used in the movie and its sequel , The Dark Knight ; however , the method was modified in the The Dark Knight Rises due to Batman 's age and physical condition and in order to match Bane 's fighting style . The method is a self @-@ defense system whose training is based on the study and cultivation of natural instincts . 
 = = = = Special effects = = = = 
 For Batman Begins , Nolan preferred traditional stuntwork over computer @-@ generated imagery . Scale models were used to represent the Narrows and Ra 's al Ghul 's temple . There were , however , several establishing shots that were CG composite images ; that is , an image composed of multiple images . Examples include Gotham 's skyline , exterior shots of Wayne Tower , and some of the exterior monorail shots . The climactic monorail sequence mixed live action footage , model work , and CGI . 
 The bats were entirely digital ( except in shots containing only one or two bats ) , as it was decided directing larger numbers of real bats on set would be problematic . Dead bats were scanned to create digital models . Locations and sets were recreated on the computer so the flying bats would not be superfluous once incorporated into the finished film . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The score for Batman Begins was composed by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard . Nolan originally invited Zimmer to compose the music , and Zimmer asked Nolan if he could invite Howard to compose as well , as they had always planned a collaboration . The two composers collaborated on separate themes for the " split personality " of Bruce Wayne and his alter ego , Batman . Zimmer and Howard began composing in Los Angeles and moved to London where they stayed for twelve weeks to complete most of their writing . Zimmer and Howard sought inspiration for shaping the score by visiting the Batman Begins sets . 
 Zimmer wanted to avoid writing music that had been done in earlier Batman films , so the score became an amalgamation of orchestra and electronic music . The film 's ninety @-@ piece orchestra was developed from members of various London orchestras , and Zimmer chose to use more than the normal number of cellos . Zimmer enlisted a boy soprano to help reflect the music in some of the film 's scenes where tragic memories of Bruce Wayne 's parents are involved . " He 's singing a fairly pretty tune and then he gets stuck , it 's like froze , arrested development , " said Zimmer . He also attempted to add a human dimension to Batman , whose behavior would typically be seen as " psychotic " , through the music . Both composers collaborated to create 2 hours and 20 minutes worth of music for the film , with Zimmer composing the action sequences and Howard focusing on the dramatic scenes .

 Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 85 % of critics have given the film a positive review based on 267 reviews , with an average score of 7 @.@ 7 / 10 , making the film a " Certified Fresh " on the website 's rating system . At Metacritic , which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the film received an average score of 70 , based on 41 reviews , which indicates " generally favorable reviews " . Additionally , the film was a success with audiences who , when polled by CinemaScore , awarded the film an A grade . 
 James Berardinelli applauded Nolan and Goyer 's work in creating more understanding into " who [ Batman ] is and what motivates him " , something Berardinelli felt Tim Burton 's film had lacked ; at the same time , Berardinelli felt the romantic aspect between Bale and Holmes did not work because the actors lacked the chemistry Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder ( Superman ) , or Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst ( Spider @-@ Man ) shared in their respective roles . According to Total Film , Nolan manages to create such strong characters and story that the third @-@ act action sequences cannot compare to " the frisson of two people talking " , and Katie Holmes and Christian Bale 's romantic subplot has a spark " refreshingly free of Peter Parker / Mary Jane @-@ style whining " . 
 Los Angeles Times ' Kenneth Turan , who felt the film began slowly , stated that the " story , psychology and reality , not special effects " , assisted the darkness behind Batman 's arsenal ; he noted that Neeson and Holmes , unlike Bale 's ability to " feel his role in his bones " , do not appear to fit their respective characters in " being both comic @-@ book archetypes and real people " . The New Yorker 's David Denby did not share Berardinelli and Turan 's opinion . He was unimpressed with the film , when comparing it to the two Tim Burton films , and that Christian Bale 's presence was hindered by the " dull earnestness of the screenplay " , the final climax was " cheesy and unexciting " , and that Nolan had resorted to imitating the " fakery " used by other filmmakers when filming action sequences . 
 Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune believed Nolan and Goyer managed to " comfortably mix the tormented drama and revenge motifs with light hearted gags and comic book allusions , " and that Nolan takes the series out of the " slam @-@ bang Hollywood <unk> " the franchise had drifted into . Comic book scribe and editor Dennis O 'Neil stated that he " felt the filmmakers really understood the character they were translating " , citing this film as the best of the live @-@ action Batman films . In contrast , J.R. Jones , from the Chicago Reader , criticized the script , and Nolan and David Goyer for not living up to the " hype about exploring Batman 's damaged psyche " . Roger Ebert , who gave mixed reviews to the previous films , and claimed in his review for Batman Returns that he did not believe noir worked in superhero films , wrote this was " the Batman movie I 've been waiting for ; more correctly , this is the movie I did not realize I was waiting for " . Giving it four out of four stars , he commended the realistic portrayals of the Batman arsenal – the Batsuit , Batcave , Tumbler , and the <unk> – as well as the focus on " the story and character " with less stress on " high @-@ tech action " . 
 Like Berardinelli , USA Today 's Mike Clark thought Bale performed the role of Batman as well as he did Patrick Bateman in American Psycho , but that the relationship between Bruce Wayne and Rachel Dawes was " frustratingly underdeveloped " . Kyle Smith thought Bale exhibited " both the menace and the wit he showed in his brilliant turn in American Psycho " , and that the film works so well because of the realism , stating , " Batman starts stripping away each layer of Gotham crime only to discover a sicker and more monstrous evil beneath , his rancid city simultaneously invokes early ' 90s New York , when criminals <unk> to the tune of five murders a day ; Serpico New York , when cops were for sale ; and today , when psychos seek to kill us all at once rather than one by one . " In contrast , Salon.com 's Stephanie Zacharek felt Nolan did not deliver the emotional depth expected of " one of the most soulful and tortured superheroes of all " ; she thought Bale , unlike Michael Keaton whom she compared him to , failed to connect with the audience underneath the mask , but that Gary Oldman succeeded in " emotional complexity " where the rest of the movie failed . 
 Film director Tim Burton — who had directed the 1989 Batman film — felt Nolan " captured the real spirit that these kind of movies are supposed to have nowadays . When I did Batman twenty years ago , in 1988 or something , it was a different time in comic book movies . You couldn 't go into that dark side of comics yet . The last couple of years that has become acceptable and Nolan certainly got more to the root of what the Batman comics are about . " 
 = = = Themes = = = 
 Comic book writer and author Danny Fingeroth argues that a strong theme in the film is Bruce 's search for a father figure , saying " [ Alfred ] is the good father that Bruce comes to depend on . Bruce 's real father died before they could establish an adult relationship , and Liam Neeson 's Ducard is stern and demanding , didactic and challenging , but not a father figure with any sympathy . If Bruce is anyone 's son , he is Alfred 's . [ Morgan ] Freeman 's Lucius is cool and imperturbable , another steady anchor in Bruce 's life . " Blogger Mark Fisher states that Bruce 's search for justice requires him to learn from a proper father figure , with Thomas Wayne and Ra 's al Ghul being the two counterpoints . Alfred provides a maternal figure of unconditional love , despite the overall lack of focus on a mother figure in Bruce 's life . 
 Fingeroth also argues that a major theme in the film is fear , which supports the story of Bruce Wayne becoming a hero . Director Christopher Nolan stated that the idea behind the film was " a person who would confront his innermost fear and then attempt to become it " . Fingeroth referred to this film 's depiction as " the man with fear — but who rises above it " . The theme of fear is further personified by the Scarecrow . The film depicts how fear can affect all creatures regardless of might . Allusions to fear are seen throughout , from Bruce 's conquering of his demons , to becoming Batman , to the Scarecrow and his deadly fear toxin . The macabre , distorted images presented in the Scarecrow 's toxin @-@ induced hallucinations also express the idea of terror to an extreme . 
 Critic Brian Orndorf considered Batman Begins " fierce " and " demonstrative in brood " , giving the film an abundance of gravitas and energy . It strays away from the lighter fare of Joel Schumacher 's 1997 Batman film , Batman & Robin , which contained camp one @-@ liners throughout . The theme of fear is intensified with the help of the musical score by Zimmer and Howard , which also " eschews traditional heroic themes " . Also contrary to previous Batman films , a psychological investigation of Bruce Wayne 's split personality in the bat suit is only lightly touched upon . Orndorf noted that Bruce is a " character constantly striving to do the right thing , not worn down by incessant reexamination " .

 The project was led by Kenta Kamei who previously worked on the animated cutscenes from the Tales games . He expressed pressure due to First Strike being his debut as a director and also elaborated on how difficult was creating the storyboard . Yoshida was given the role of screenwriter in order to appeal to the female fanbase the series has always had . It was released in Japan on October 3 , 2009 , as a result of delays in production .

 = = Plot = = 
 Using the power of a powerful substance known as aer , mankind is in an age of discovery and prosperity . The crystallized form of aer , which is known as Apatheia , is considered to be a very powerful energy source as it is essential to human life . To protect towns from attacks by monsters , large amounts of Apatheia are being produced to create barriers around towns . One day , in a forest near the town of Shizontania , Yuri Lowell and Flynn Scifo , two knights who have just joined the Niren Corps , together with two of their senior knights and fellow Corps members , Hisca and Chastel , are sent on a mission to investigate an abnormal gushing of aer in the area . 
 After their first assignment to help in destroying a monster infestation near the town , Yuri , Flynn , Hisca , and Chastel meet the leader of the local guild , <unk> Kaid . Niren , the captain of the knights stationed in Shizontania , was once dedicated to following the letter of the rules and regulation of the knights . However , he attributes the death of his wife and daughter to this trait , saying that if he had defied orders , he may have been able to protect them . The knights ' efforts to repel the monsters around the area prove to be in vain . Despite being called by Commandant Alexei to attend a formal gathering at the imperial capital of Zaphias , Niren sends Flynn in his stead to attend the gathering and to request aid in defending the town . Niren and Chastel leave in search of a " strange blastia expert " named Rita <unk> . Yuri and Hisca are left to care for Lambert , Niren 's personal hound , and Repede , Lambert 's son . Niren succeeds in finding Rita <unk> and obtaining a device with which to return the aer to normal . Flynn is admonished by Commandant Alexei , and his request for reinforcements to hold Shizontonia is denied until the end of the gathering . Yuri and Hisca assist in defending the town against a strange monster made out of aer , and while they successfully repel the invasion , the monster takes control of Lambert along with two other <unk> . As Lambert rages out of control , Yuri is forced to kill him to protect Hisca . 
 When Flynn returns from Zaphias , he and Yuri come to blows , as each believes the other had an effortless assignment . Meanwhile , a platoon of high @-@ ranking knights from central are seen in the forest being slaughtered by monsters . One survives and flees to Shizontonia 's front gate , where he delivers a report to an unseen individual in the city . Niren , upon receiving the news that reinforcements would not be arriving anytime soon , decides to take the knights to investigate the source of the aer , which he believes to be a fortress at the center of a nearby lake . Flynn disagrees with Niren 's decision , viewing it as disobedience of a direct order . 
 Garista , the strategist for the Niren Corps , attempts to dissuade Niren but to no avail . The investigation in the fortress turns out to be more dangerous as the aer begins to turn the fortress into a living weapon to attack the knights . The knights make their way into the center of the fortress , where a giant blastia is found to be using the aer . Niren uses the device given by Rita to stifle the gushing of aer , but a backlash is caused by the sudden ceasing of aer flow , and the blastia explodes , destroying the barrier blastia that keeps Shizontonia safe , knocking out Chastel , and causing the fortress to begin to crumble . As Niren attempts to carry Chastel to safety , the floor beneath him crumbles . Niren is able to throw Chastel to Yuri and is stranded in a sinkhole of gushing aer . Despite Yuri 's attempts to save him , due to a wound he received during the investigation , Niren is unable to pull himself to safety . Leaving his blastia with Yuri , Niren has the knights leave without him . 
 The knights and the entire town mourn over Niren 's death . Flynn realizes that the blastia used in the fortress where the aer abnormality originated , along with the piece he spotted on the floor , were a specialized type used only by Garista . Yuri and Flynn confront Garista with this information , and Garista reveals that he was attempting to illegally create a new kind of blastia , but failed and decided to leave the blastia to destroy itself , therefore destroying Shizontonia and killing any and all witnesses . Yuri and Flynn attempt to arrest Garista , but a fight ensues and Yuri kills him . In the aftermath , Shizontonia is evacuated due to the failure of the barrier blastia . Yuri leaves the knights , taking Niren 's blastia as a keepsake and bringing Repede along with him , saying his goodbyes to everyone in the town . Flynn sees him off at the gates , and the two share a fond farewell , swearing to meet again one day .

 Tales of Vesperia : The First Strike was officially announced in early 2009 with the staff confirming the return of Kousuke Toriumi and Mamoru Miyano as the protagonists . Production of the movie started when Tales of Vesperia was still in plot stage . The team discarded the idea of making an adaptation of the game due to its large length . The team was also against making a sequel or a <unk> due to the required time @-@ consuming character introductions that would make it required to play the game to enjoy . Director Kenta Kamei wanted a movie that anybody would enjoy . As a result , it was decided to make it a prequel as they could explore Yuri and Flynn 's background . Kamei was originally involved in the movie parts of the Tales series . When he was assigned as the movie 's director , he recalls feeling " honoured , surprised and a bit nervous at the same time " . 
 The First Strike was Kamei 's first movie , and he wanted to rely on an experienced screenwriter . He eventually requested Reiko Yoshida 's help as the Tales series had a strong female fanbase and thus needed " feminine sensitiveness " in designing the script . The film uses 2D and computer @-@ generated animation . The director was demanding with the <unk> director , and he relied on a very skilled team . He started from the director of photography , Kazuhiro Yamada , who he personally insisted to join the production . Kamei elaborated on how blending hand @-@ drawn animation and CGI was one of the most difficult and time @-@ consuming tasks . As a result , especially in the opening scene , the film had hand @-@ drawn characters running on a 3D background . It took a while before he could get the result he was aiming for . The plot took two years and a half to produce . Originally , there were plans to release the movie before the game , but a delay in the schedule resulted in Vesperia being released first . Kamei believes that this was due to how demanding he was . 
 Much of the plot was affected by Yuri and Flynn 's youth . Niren <unk> was created to serve as a mentor figure as well as the possible future of the two 's careers . Since Yuri was surer of his interest , the coming @-@ of @-@ age story was more focused on Flynn . This is meant to act as a counterpart to the video game , where not much of Flynn 's past and his weaknesses are exposed . The friendship between Yuri and Flynn was seen as " priceless " by Kamei due to the mutual respect they share as well as the occasion each gets angry . 
 The storyboard took six months to complete . Kamei struggled with several difficulties as he was under pressure due to how it would influence the entire film . The climax of the film also proved difficult to make . He also noted how the first scene had the challenge of attracting the audience 's attention . Kamei 's favorite scene is when Yuri looks up at the sky of Shizontania the night before the knights ' expedition to the old ruins . It meant to emphasize the importance of Yuri 's decision in regards to his future .

 The music of the film was composed by Akira Senju . According to Elliot Gay from Japanator Senju " brings an orchestral sound that really elevates the film in a way that veteran Tales series composer Motoi Sakuraba seems to struggle with these day " . The source game 's theme song , " Ring a Bell " ( <unk> , Kane o <unk> ) by Bonnie Pink , was reused as the movie 's theme song .

 = = = Critical reaction = = = 
 Critical reception to the film has generally been positive . Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network gave the film a positive review . Despite criticizing the film 's pace , she said that " It may still appeal primarily to fans of the game , but for those who enjoy a heroic fantasy tale , this is one worth checking out . " Elliot Gay from Japanator praised the development of its cast and agreed with Frith in regards to the film 's accessibility . He gave the film a " Great " 8 out of 10 calling it " A well executed film that defines its genre without resorting to cliches " . John Rose from the Fandom Post praised both Yuri and Flynn 's characters as " neither character is simply some cardboard cutout incapable of growth or prevented from having another aspect to their personality and it is in these moments where the characters are able to show off their differences and complexities that the two really shine . " He also called the film " a fantastically animated feature that may also be one of the best adaptations of an RPG world that has been created in a different medium " . Carly Frith from <unk> gave it a 9 out of 10 praising its accessibility and the work from the English voice cast . He said " The story is good and absorbing with only a few times when it feels like it ’ s tripping up " criticizing some aspects that felt poorly translated from the video game . 
 The film also attracted criticism . UK Anime Network 's Andy Hanley stated " It has potential in its characters and concept , but does very little with them over the course of this film to make for a <unk> mediocre movie . " Similar to Silverman , Jeffrey Kauffman from Blu @-@ ray.com noted that the film had a slow pace in developing Yuri and Flynn 's relationship . He gave high praise to the animation used in the story . He criticized its supporting cast as he believes " Tales of Vesperia : The First Strike is a standalone offering , or at least one that might have done better had it focused solely on Yuri and Flynn and left the rest of the ' cast of thousands ' far in the background . " Gay was saddened by the lack of appearances from the side characters such as Siren , Hisca , and Chastel . 
 The production value has been met with positive critical response . Silverman praised the film 's animation , stating that " the movie is gorgeous , and not just for theatrical animation . " Silverman also praised the cast , most notably Yuri 's voice actors . <unk> also gave high praise to the animation calling it " beautiful and rich " and said " It is top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line in artwork , artistic style and coloring . The action sequences , though reminiscent of the game , are not repetitive nor silly . This is a very serious movie and it was treated as such . " The Fandom Post agreed saying " the feature has some absolutely stunning visuals which create lush and vibrant environments for the characters to live in which adds a wonderful polish to the work . " Similar praise was given by Jeffrey Kauffman from Blu @-@ <unk> Andy Hanley praised the distinctive character designs despite criticizing some aspects from the fight scenes . 
 = The Stake Out ( Seinfeld ) = 
 " The Stake Out " is the second episode produced of the first season of the NBC comedy Seinfeld . 
 It aired as the second episode of the season on May 31 , 1990 . The episode was written by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David and directed by Tom Cherones . The narrative features Jerry Seinfeld agreeing to attend a birthday party with his ex @-@ girlfriend Elaine Benes . During the party , Jerry tries to flirt with another woman , but fails to learn anything about her except her place of work . Jerry is reluctant to ask Elaine for the woman 's number because he does not talk to her about other women . Jerry 's father , Morty , suggests that he " stake out " the woman 's workplace and pretend to meet her accidentally , which Jerry does . " The Stake Out " is the first episode to feature Elaine and Jerry 's parents . The episode was nominated for a Writers Guild Award in 1991 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Jerry and Elaine have just ended their relationship , but have chosen to remain friends . Elaine invites Jerry to a birthday party ; he agrees to go on the condition that she accompanies him to a wedding that he and his parents have been invited to . At the party , Jerry meets an attractive woman named Vanessa . He wants to flirt with her , but is uncomfortable doing so in Elaine 's presence . The woman leaves with another man before Jerry finds out her name ; however , he learns that she works at a law firm called " <unk> , Bennett , Robbins , Oppenheim and Taft " . During the party , Elaine tries to tell Jerry about a dream she had , which featured him . Jerry tries to end the conversation but this results in an argument after the party is over . 
 Back at his apartment , Jerry 's parents , Morty and Helen , sleep over , with Jerry sleeping in Kramer 's apartment . He talks about the party and claims that he cannot get the phone number of the woman from Elaine because he does not talk about other women with her ; additionally , she is still angry with him . Morty suggests that Jerry " stake out " the woman by waiting outside her office , an idea which Jerry likes . The following day , Jerry and George Costanza perform the stake out , pretending that they are coming to see someone else in the building named " Art <unk> " , but under pressure , George insists that they make it " Art Vandelay " . They meet the woman , who says the man she left the party with was her cousin . The two then decide to go out on a date . 
 Later that night , Jerry finds out from his mother that Elaine knows about the stake out . On the day of the wedding , Elaine tells Jerry that the reason that she was angry was because it was the first time she saw him flirt with another woman . They decide that they have to be able to talk more about their relationships if they wish to remain friends . Elaine then reveals that she has recently met a man using a stake out .

 " The Stake Out " is based on a real life incident in which David was with a woman that he had dated previously named Monica Yates . They then went to a restaurant and David met another woman . However , he could not flirt as much as he wanted due to the presence of Yates . David did find out the name of the building where she worked at and staked her out . The names of the people in the title of the law firm are friends Larry David made at college . 
 This episode prompted running gags that were used in later episodes . These were the importer @-@ exporter , George 's ambitions of becoming an architect and Art Vandelay . The character of Vanessa ( named after a woman David once went out with ) also reappears in a later episode from the first season , " The Stock Tip " . 
 " The Stake Out " is the first episode to mention the past relationship between Jerry and Elaine . Although it was the third episode to be filmed ( after " The Seinfeld Chronicles " and " Male Unbonding " ) , it was the second episode to be broadcast . The episode order was changed because " The Stake Out " provided more background information about Elaine and her relationship with Jerry . Julia Louis @-@ Dreyfus commented that she liked the script for the episode because it made the character seem human . She also commented on the fact that it was racy due to the mention of a pornographic film . 
 The opening scene caused some problems because it featured a woman walking off the set and taking one step down to get off it . <unk> Forbes , the set designer , thought that this made the show look cheap . The scene in which Jerry and Elaine are in a taxi was filmed in a studio using a black background and moving a fake taxi , due to budget restraints , in a method known as " Poor Man 's Process . " 
 This is the first episode to feature Jerry 's parents . Only one casting session was performed to find the actors for the roles . Philip Sterling was originally cast to play the role of Morty Seinfeld , but was replaced with Phil Bruns . Bruns was then replaced as well because Seinfeld and David wanted the character to be harsher . As a result , the role was recast and given to Barney Martin — who had no idea that another actor had already established the part . In this episode Kramer greets Morty by name . 
 = = Reception = = 
 When " The Stake Out " was first broadcast on May 31 , 1990 , the episode attracted a Nielsen rating of 16 @.@ 2 / 24 , meaning that 16 @.@ 2 % of American households watched the episode , and that 24 % of all televisions in use at the time were tuned into it . When the episode was first repeated , on December 2 , 1992 , a special introductory film was made featuring Louis @-@ Dreyfus and Seinfeld , in which they stated that this episode was the first one they did together . Strictly speaking , though , it was just the first episode broadcast — in terms of production order , " Male Unbonding " was the first episode in which the two characters both appeared . 
 The episode was nominated for a Writers Guild Award in 1991 . Holly E. Ordway for DVD Talk Review commented positively on not just this episode , but the whole of the first season , saying , " What 's not to like about an episode like ' The Stakeout , ' in which ( among other things ) we are witness to the invention of George 's alter ego , Art Vandelay ( and his import / export business ) ? " Mary Kay Shilling and Mike Flaherty of Entertainment Weekly also liked the episode but had some doubts , saying it was , " A painfully realistic take on the lovers @-@ to @-@ friends transition that should have been more comically fruitful . " 
 However , some reviews of the episode were critical , both now and at the time . When first broadcast , Matt Roush from USA Today wrote : " Lacking much in the way of attitude , the show seems obsolete and irrelevant . What it boils down to is that Seinfeld is a mayonnaise clown in the world that requires a little horseradish . " 
 Colin Jacobson for DVD Movie Guide criticized the writing , saying , " the show 's rather bland . It provides the occasional chuckle , but the characters aren 't formed yet , and that makes the program ring false . The ending reconciliation between Jerry and Elaine causes particular problems ; it doesn 't turn sappy , but it comes too close for Seinfeld . "

 = 824th Tank Destroyer Battalion = 
 The 824th Tank Destroyer Battalion was a tank destroyer battalion of the United States Army active during the Second World War . It saw service during 1944 – 45 in the European Theater of Operations , primarily attached to the 100th Infantry Division in an infantry support role . After fighting through France and southern Germany , the battalion ended the war in Austria . 
 The 824th was originally formed in August 1942 in Oklahoma , and trained in the United States for two years . In October 1944 , it deployed to France equipped with towed 3 " anti @-@ tank guns , and was assigned to support the Seventh Army , then fighting in Alsace . Here it supported the 100th Division as it pushed steadily eastwards towards Germany , and on 8 – 9 January 1945 was employed to repel a SS panzergrenadier attack during Operation Nordwind , the only time the unit is recorded as having destroyed an enemy tank . 
 After conversion to M18 Hellcat self @-@ propelled tank destroyers , the battalion moved into Germany , helping force a bridgehead over the Neckar River at the Battle of Heilbronn . After reaching Stuttgart it was reassigned to the 103rd Infantry Division , and with them reached Innsbruck in Austria by VE Day . After two weeks of occupation duties it was ordered to prepare for service in the Pacific ; however , while it was reforming in the United States , the Japanese surrender was announced , and the need for more combat units ended . The battalion was demobilized in September 1945 . 
 = = Early service = = 
 The battalion was formed at Camp Gruber , Oklahoma , on 10 August 1942 , with a cadre of 31 officers and 77 men . It received 829 draftees from Camp Upton , New York , in mid @-@ January 1943 , bringing it up to slightly over full strength . The unit was nominally organised as a " tank destroyer battalion , heavy , self @-@ propelled " ; after some experimentation in 1941 @-@ 2 , this had become the standard organisation for tank destroyer units . Under this structure , the battalion would have three gun companies , each with three platoons of M3 self @-@ propelled 75mm guns ; each platoon had four gun crews and twelve additional men for command and security duties . These were supported by a fourth reconnaissance company with three reconnaissance platoons and one platoon of pioneers , and various headquarters and support elements . 
 After the men had been assembled at Camp Gruber , the battalion departed for Camp Bowie , Texas , where it carried out three months of basic training , and in mid @-@ April was transferred to Fort Hood , Texas , where it trained at the Tank Destroyer Tactical and Firing Center . While the 824th was at Fort Hood , a new organisational structure was announced for tank destroyer battalions , converting them from self @-@ propelled guns to towed 3 " anti @-@ tank guns ; the 824th was officially reorganised to the new pattern in July . This had the same number of guns - three companies , with three platoons of four guns - but the reconnaissance company was reduced to two platoons and merged into the headquarters company , while the pioneers were removed entirely . 
 On completing unit training at Fort Hood in August , the 824th was transferred to Louisiana for field maneuvers , returning to Camp Bowie in January 1944 . The battalion finally left the United States in October 1944 , sailing from New York aboard the USS Lejeune on 14 October and landing at Marseilles on 28 October . 
 = = Fighting in Alsace = = 
 The battalion first saw frontline service on 28 November , when two companies were attached to the 397th Infantry Regiment ( 100th Infantry Division ) , which was itself temporarily attached to the 45th Infantry Division , fighting in the Vosges Mountains under the Seventh Army . The battalion took its first casualties the following day , with four men in A Company killed and three wounded by artillery and mortar fire . The following day , a gun crew of the same company fired the battalion 's first shots in anger , destroying a machine @-@ gun position . The battalion pushed eastwards with the 100th and 45th Divisions until mid @-@ December , with individual gun crews providing direct fire support to infantrymen assaulting German defensive positions , as well as indirect artillery fire . 
 On 21 December , after the start of the German offensive in the Ardennes , the Seventh Army was ordered onto the defensive . A Company of the 824th was attached to the 106th Cavalry Group , covering the far left flank of the Army , while the other two gun companies remained with the infantry of 100th Division . The anticipated enemy offensive , Operation Nordwind , began on the night of New Year 's Eve . After heavy infantry fighting , German armored units were engaged on 8 – 9 January 1945 , when the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division attacked the 397th Infantry Regiment , supported by B Company of the 824th ; one gun was lost in return for one tank and several half @-@ tracks . This is the only occurrence noted in the battalion history in which the battalion engaged enemy armor . Two guns were temporarily abandoned by B Company when their supporting infantry retreated . A group of eight men returned to recover them the following night ; all were awarded Bronze Stars for bravery . Additionally , one gun commander was awarded the Bronze Star for holding his gun in an exposed position during an attack . 
 Through the rest of January and February , the battalion remained in defensive positions , with crews rotating to the neighboring 776th Tank Destroyer Battalion in order to train on self @-@ propelled tank destroyers . The 824th was prepared for conversion to the new equipment by early March , but this was delayed in order to support the 100th Division 's attack on Bitche as part of Operation <unk> from 15 – 19 March . 
 = = Advance into Germany = = 
 In the last week of March , the battalion finally withdrew to refit with the M18 Hellcat self @-@ propelled tank destroyer . In so doing , it reverted to the old self @-@ propelled battalion organisation ; three companies of twelve tank destroyers , plus a fourth reconnaissance company with a platoon of pioneers . The new organisation was smaller than the old - fewer men were needed for vehicle crews - and so even after the creation of the new Reconnaissance Company on 27 March , the 824th finished the month with a complement of 646 all ranks , down from 750 . 
 Following the refit , it crossed the Rhine on 1 April , and was almost immediately returned to combat to support the 100th Division 's attack on Heilbronn , an attempt to force a bridgehead across the Neckar River . The fighting began on 4 April , with C Company crossing the river into the centre of the city on 8 April ; in the absence of enemy armor , they provided close fire support to infantrymen engaged in house @-@ to @-@ house fighting . 
 Once Heilbronn had been secured , the 100th Division , and the 824th with it , moved south towards Stuttgart . On 25 April , the 824th was reassigned to the 103rd Division , which was moving eastwards through Bavaria towards Austria ; it finished the war , on VE Day , outside Innsbruck . After the end of hostilities , six men were awarded the Silver Star , and twenty @-@ two more men were awarded Bronze Stars – one posthumously – bringing the battalion 's total to six Silver Stars and thirty @-@ one Bronze Stars . 
 The battalion carried out security and occupation duties , until handing over to the 384th Field Artillery Battalion on 17 May . It was then ordered to prepare for redeployment to the Pacific Theater of Operations , via the United States . In mid @-@ June , the 824th headed west , leaving their vehicles at depots in northern France , and sailed from Le Havre aboard the SS John Howland and SS Thomas Cresap on 1 July . On arrival , the men were given one month of leave ; on 18 August , however , the battalion was notified that it would be demobilized due to the surrender of Japan . Three weeks later , on 11 September , the battalion was formally demobilized at Fort Jackson , South Carolina , and ceased to exist . 
 = Dandie Dinmont Terrier = 
 A Dandie Dinmont Terrier is a small Scottish breed of dog in the terrier family . The breed has a very long body , short legs , and a distinctive " top @-@ knot " of hair on the head . A character in Sir Walter Scott 's novel Guy Mannering has lent the name to the breed , with " Dandie Dinmont " thought to be based on James Davidson , who is credited as being the " father " of the modern breed . Davidson 's dogs descended from earlier terrier owning families , including the Allans of Holystone , Northumberland . 
 There are three breed clubs in the UK supporting the breed , although it is registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club due to its low number of puppy registrations on a yearly basis . The breed is friendly , but tough and is suitable for interaction with older children . There are no breed specific health concerns , but they can be affected by spinal issues due to their elongated body and the breed is affected by canine cancer at a higher than average rate . 
 = = History = = 
 The breed originates from the dogs being used in the border country of Scotland and England . During the 1600s , they were used for hunting badgers and otters . Whilst their ultimate origin remains unknown , dogs owned by the Allans of Holystone , Northumberland in the early 1700s are thought to have been involved in their early origins . These dogs may have been a type of Border Terrier , although other theories exist including the idea that they are a cross between Scottish Terriers and Skye Terriers . The head of this family was Willie " Piper " Allan , who was born in nearby Bellingham . He was a fly @-@ fisher and enjoyed his sports , and in particular kept dogs for the hunting of otters . Lord Ravensworth once hired Allan to remove the otters from the pond in <unk> Park . Lord Ravensworth attempted to purchase one of Allan 's favoured dogs after he successfully removed the otters , which Allan refused . Willie Piper died on 18 February 1779 , and his dogs passed into the care of his son , James . James ' son eventually inherited the dogs , and sold a dog named " Old Pepper " to Mr. Francis Sommer who came from Town Yetholm on the Scottish side of the border . Old Pepper was descended from one of Willie Allan 's favorite dogs who had worked Lord Ravensworth 's manor . 
 The breed remained relatively unknown outside of the borders until 1815 when Sir Walter Scott 's novel Guy Mannering was published . Sir Walter had spent time in the area whilst the Sheriff of <unk> and had learned of the prowess of these types of specialist terriers for working both fox and otter . When he wrote Guy Mannering , he included a character by the name of " Dandie Dinmont " who owned a number of terriers named " Pepper " and " Mustard " after the colours of their coats . The Dinmont character was partly based on the real life farmer and terrier owner , Mr. James Davidson , who too used the generic terms of Pepper and Mustard for his dogs depending on their coats . Davidson 's dogs came from a variety of sources including the dogs of the Allan , Anderson and Faas families . Davidson documented his breeding , and has been accepted as the father of the modern breed . 
 Some interbreeding with other breeds took place in the mid @-@ 1800s , which may have introduced Dachshund blood into the breed , although certain breeders maintained pure @-@ bred lines . The Dachshund theory was first introduced by John Henry Walsh under the pseudonym of " Stonehenge " in the 1880s , and was denied by many breeders of that era . By the mid @-@ 1800s , the breed was known as the Dandie Dinmont Terrier , and became sought after for hunting after Scott 's writings were published . They remain the only dog breed to have been named after a fictional character . Around this time the breed had some involvement in the development of the Bedlington Terrier . 
 The Kennel Club formed in 1873 and , at the Fleece Hotel at Selkirk , Scottish Borders on November 17 , 1875 , the Dandie Dinmont Terrier Club ( DDTC ) was formed , becoming the third oldest breed club for dogs in the world . Lord <unk> was the society 's first president , while Mr. E Bradshaw Smith was the first vice president . Noted breeders Hugh Dalziel and William <unk> were also involved in the formation of the club . The breed standard was created by Mr. William Wardlaw Reid , another founding member of the club , with it agreed a year later at another meeting of the club . A club show was held for the first time in Carlisle in 1877 . Shows after this were held in conjunction with other clubs on a yearly basis until 1928 when it moved to the Market Hall in Carlisle , where with the exception of during the Second World War , the shows continued to be held until 1982 . Shows continued to be held in the general area until 2001 when they moved south to Cheshire and Lancashire . 
 The DDTC is not the only breed club in the UK . For a while several breed clubs were created in Scotland , but none lasted particularly long except for the Scottish Dandie Dinmont Terrier Society which merged into the DDTC in 1929 . Today , in addition to the DDTC , there are also the Southern Dandie Dinmont Terrier Society , and for Scotland , the Caledonian Dandie Dinmont Club . 
 The breed was first registered with the American Kennel Club ( AKC ) in 1888 . The Dandie Dinmont Terrier was recognized by the United Kennel Club ( UKC ) in 1918 . During the Second World War many kennels were dispersed and the dogs destroyed , due to both the lack of food caused by rationing and that of manpower . Following the war several kennels led the way to re – establishing the breed including the <unk> Kennels , located first in Surrey before later moving to Old Windsor . Dandies continued to be bred up at <unk> up until the early 1990s , when it passed into the hands of Battersea Dogs and Cats Home . 
 In 2006 , the Kennel Club recognised the Dandie Dinmont Terrier as one of the rarest dog breeds native to the British Isles , putting it on a new list of Vulnerable Native Breeds . The breeds chosen for this list were those who originated in the UK and Ireland , but had less than 300 puppy registrations per year . One particularly low period was between July and September 2003 , when only 21 puppies were registered , of which 18 were male . Overall that year , only 90 puppies were registered in the UK , compared to 9 @,@ 823 for the West Highland White Terrier . Additionally numbers had dropped to low levels in America as well , with the AKC registering only 75 puppies in the same time period . Following work since 2006 , the Dandie Dinmont registration numbers have improved slightly , with 151 puppies registered with the Kennel Club in 2010 , the highest number for any year in the last ten years . Of other breeds of native terrier , only the Skye , Sealyham , Manchester and Glen of <unk> Terriers have lower registration figures . 
 = = Description = = 
 The breed has short legs , with an elongated body . Unusually among Scottish terrier breeds , it has pendulous ears . The neck is muscular , having developed from the breed 's use against larger game . The typical height at the withers is 8 – 11 inches ( 20 – 28 cm ) , and they can weigh anywhere between 18 – 24 pounds ( 8 @.@ 2 – 10 @.@ 9 kg ) . While the Dandie generally is a hardy breed , it may have issue climbing stairs . They have a silky coat which forms a " topknot " on top of the dog 's head . The Dandie Dinmont Terrier has a similar body shape to the Skye Terrier , but the Skye 's coat is thicker and longer . 
 The coat comes in two colour ranges , either " pepper " or " mustard " . Pepper ranges from a dark blueish black through to a very light silvery gray , while the mustard can vary from reddish browns to a fawn where the head appears to be almost white . Typically , the legs and feet are of a darker colour with the lighter colour on the body slowly blending into that on the legs . The depth of the coat can reach up to 2 inches ( 5 @.@ 1 cm ) . The colour of the coat is usually set by the time the dog reaches eight months of age , but the Dandie Dinmont Terrier will continue to mature physically until around two years old . 
 = = Temperament = = 
 The breed is tough but usually friendly , and are suitable for older children . It makes both a good companion and a guard dog , but are among the most docile of the terrier breeds and are usually quite undemanding of their owners . However they are known for their ability to dig large holes in a short space of time . They can be trained to be good with cats , but should not be trusted around smaller animals such as hamsters or rats . They are described as being " very game " , in that they are prone to challenging other animals including foxes , and in some cases other dogs . 
 = = Health = = 
 Due to the breed 's elongated body , there can be back issues within the breed specifically with intervertebral discs in the dog 's backs . These discs can sometimes " slip " resulting in spinal disc herniation . Any symptoms relating to this can depend entirely on what part of the dog 's back is affected , and can range to paralysis with loss of bladder and bowel control in the worst cases . 
 Following work by the breed clubs to ensure that any reoccurring health issues are dealt with , there are no especially common conditions affecting the Dandie Dinmont Terrier . However , minor issues affecting the breed can include hypothyroidism , primary closed angle glaucoma and Cushing 's syndrome . In order to combat glaucoma in the breed , the breed clubs recommend that Dandies should have a procedure called a <unk> conducted on them at regular intervals throughout their lives . The Dandie is also at slightly higher risk of canine cancer than average . The average life expectancy of a Dandie Dinmont Terrier is 11 – 13 years . 
 = Antemoro people = 
 The Antemoro ( or Antaimoro ) are an ethnic group of Madagascar living on the southeastern coast , mostly between Manakara and Farafangana . Numbering around 500 @,@ 000 , this ethnic group traces its origins back to Arab settlers who arrived from Mecca in the 15th or 16th century . Upon settling in Madagascar , these Arabs converted the Antemoro to Islam ; the religion was soon abandoned in favor of traditional beliefs and practices associated with respect for the ancestors , although remnants of Islam remain in fady such as the prohibition against consuming pork . In the 16th century an Antemoro kingdom was established , supplanting the power of the earlier Zafiraminia , who also descended from Arab seafarers . 
 The Antemoro soon developed a reputation as powerful sorcerers and astrologers , in large part owing to their monopoly on knowledge of writing , termed sorabe , which uses the Arabic script to transcribe the Malagasy language . Antemoro ombiasy ( astrologer sages ) migrated throughout the island , where they practiced their arts for local communities , served as advisers to kings , and even founded new principalities . This Antemoro mobility and their creation of a network of powerful spiritual advisers across the island is credited with forcing an awareness among Malagasy of communities beyond their own and sparking a sense of a common Malagasy identity . The Antemoro kingdom was disbanded in the late 19th century following an uprising of the Antemoro commoners against the noble class . 
 Today the Antemoro remain clustered around the southeast coastal homeland , where they grow rice and coffee , produce salt , and manufacture charms . The Antemoro often leave their homeland for six to ten months out of the year or more to work as ombiasy offering charms , spells , divinations and other arcane services . Nearly every village in Madagascar has an ombiasy , and many are either Antemoro themselves or have traveled to the Antemoro homeland to receive training . The community 's historic production of Antemoro paper , a flower @-@ embedded paper traditionally used to record secret knowledge using sorabe , is another major source of income as the paper is commonly sold to tourists and exported overseas . 
 = = Ethnic identity = = 
 " Antemoro " , in the Malagasy language , means " people of the coast " . They live on the southeastern coast , mostly between Manakara and Farafangana . The Antemoro are descendants of Arabs who settled in Madagascar in the 14th century and intermarried with the local population . In 2013 the Antemoro population was estimated at 500 @,@ 000 . 
 = = History = = 
 The Antemoro figure among the more recent settlers on the island of Madagascar . They are descended from Arab Muslim seafarers who are believed to have arrived on the southeast coast around 1500 . Boats carrying Arab settlers had arrived on Madagascar 's shores in the past , but there was a marked uptick in arrivals around this time . Upon arrival they encountered several other Malagasy ethnic groups including the Zafiraminia , who also traced their origins back to Mecca by way of East Africa and who had developed a high status among Malagasy communities for the knowledge and technology they had carried with them from overseas , and who had the prerogative of practicing ritual animal sacrifice for the ancestors ( <unk> ) , a highly powerful and important rite among Malagasy communities . Oral and written historical traditions of the Antemoro describe their desire to secure marriages between the two communities , but these efforts were rejected by the Zafiraminia . A conflict developed between the two groups for supremacy , which the oral histories of other Malagasy groups describe as a battle between two giants . The conflict evolved as additional Arab settlers arrived and joined with their fellow newcomers to become Antemoro themselves . 
 Around 1550 the mounting conflict seems to have reached a turning point with the Zafikasimambo noble family rising to power in Matitana following the family leader 's marriage to a local woman . Historical texts tie the lineage of the family 's leader , <unk> , to <unk> noble <unk> , who had settled there at least three generations before . Other historical sources confirm however that the genealogy described in these texts is not factual , and that the <unk> family had only newly arrived and so had no demonstrable descent from local nobles . Rather , these texts suggest that it took over three generations for the Antemoro to successfully integrate into the society through intermarriage and other means , and also reflect an awareness among the Antemoro of the importance of local caste and lineage traditions and their need to find a place within them . Upon rising to power , the Zafikasimambo clan absorbed the ritual privileges of the former Zafiraminia clan and had established themselves as the premier ombiasy ( wise men ) who practiced astrology and served as scribes ; they regularly left the Antemoro homeland to provide their services where needed . These ombiasy also often trained the spiritual leaders of other communities , further reinforcing the preeminence of the Matitana ombiasy as masters of arcane knowledge and those outside their clan who sought to learn or dispense it . The Zafikasimambo used their right to conduct <unk> ( ritual sacrifice ) to shape and increasingly control political and economic activities in the area . To end the conflict with the Zafiraminia , they executed as many males of the group as possible and relegated the women and children to restricted areas . In this way they established the first strong Antemoro kingdom . They are rare among Malagasy clans as newcomers who successfully established their own kingdom within a short time after landing on the island . 
 Under Antemoro Zafikasimambo leadership , the commoners ' freedom was significantly reduced and religion became a central feature of social and political life . The conflict between the Antemoro and Zafiraminia nobles and the resulting Zafikasimambo rule also established a tradition of emigration from this part of the island . Unlike the majority of Malagasy who generally seek to return to their ancestral land , the Antemoro initially felt no such call to remain linked to a geographic area . As a result , the ombiasy of the Antemoro traveled widely , some moving from place to place and others settling permanently at royal courts and elsewhere . Their arcane knowledge of writing , medicine , technology and other areas both established their reputation as indispensable advisers to nobles and commoners alike , and instilled the island @-@ wide feature of the community astrologer who shapes daily life . The ombiasy of Matitana were According to historian <unk> <unk> , the network of stationary and itinerant Antemoro ombiasy were key in transforming the societies of Madagascar from an amalgam of insular clans to outward looking communities with greater awareness of others , leading to territorial expansion and larger , more complex kingdoms . In addition , oral histories suggest that sovereigns among the Merina , Tanala and <unk> may have had ancestors who migrated away from Antemoro country . 
 By the early 18th century , the Antemoro had established themselves as major rice and slave exporters . Throughout the 1700s , the Antemoro were embroiled in a conflict with the <unk> @-@ Tanala that culminated in a bloody Tanala invasion of the eastern coastal plain . Shortly afterward , a major Antemoro leader named <unk> established an alliance and vassal relationship with the king then ruling Imerina , Andrianampoinimerina , to reestablish peace . 
 = = Society = = 
 Antemoro villages are primarily clustered in the southeastern coastal area near Vohipeno and Manakara . Society was traditionally divided into two broad categories : the <unk> ( or <unk> ) , who were nobles said to be descended from Arabs from Mecca , and the menakely , composed of the working and slave classes , who were said to have descended from the local Malagasy who submitted to the Arabs ' rule , or alternately from slaves that the Arabs had brought with them . The <unk> comprised many noble clans such as the Anakara , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and others . Particular clans within Antemoro society historically held distinct privileges and responsibilities . The butchering of certain animals for human consumption was assigned to specific clans . 
 Antemoro kings ( <unk> ) were selected by popular decision from among the Anakara clan , originally clustered around the mouth of the <unk> river near the town of Manakara that shares their name . Once selected , these rulers were accorded a near @-@ sacred status . The fady they established were scrupulously observed for centuries after the ruler 's death . The Anakara were responsible for safeguarding the sacred Antemoro idols and texts , spoke a secret language for communicating arcane knowledge amongst themselves , and rarely intermarried with other Antemoro clans . This clan was believed to be in communication with powerful genies ( <unk> ) and other spirits and was reputed to produce the most powerful sorcerers and astrologers on the island . They knew how to manufacture charms , cast spells , and practice geomancy using local gemstones . To maintain their distinction from other members of Antemoro society , the Anakara lived in villages sealed off by spiked wooden palisades where none could enter without permission . Rulers were further distinguished by fady forbidding them to wear shirts or hats .

 = = = Religious affiliation = = = 
 The Antemoro adhere to the traditional spiritual beliefs and practices common throughout the island , although different Antemoro clans and families incorporate aspects of Islam to varying degrees . They commonly make and wear amulets upon which verses of the Qur 'an are written using the sorabe script . Before converting to Islam in the seventh or eighth century , the Malagasy clans that later intermarried with Arabs to found the Antemoro dynasty were <unk> who believed in a creator god and numerous spirits that served as intermediaries between living beings and the creator . By the time of conversion to Islam , the creator god had been all but forgotten , with much greater focus placed on the spirits , who had been raised to the level of deities . The arrival of Arab settlers prompted large scale conversion to Islam , but the core tenets were soon lost and gave way to the honoring of ancestors and their fady . 
 = = Culture = = 
 Arab and Islamic influences strongly mark Antemoro culture . Traditionally , Antemoro men 's clothing included a turban or fez style hat and long , loose robes similar to those worn in many other parts of the Muslim world . <unk> reeds were woven to form mats ( <unk> ) that were sewn together to form jackets and tunics ( with long sleeves for older men ) ; a loincloth made of <unk> ( beaten <unk> ) was worn beneath the ensemble . Women wore sleeveless sheath dresses made from two or three reed mats sewn together and belted at the waist or drawn over one shoulder . Adolescent and adult women often also wore a mat bandeau or halter top . It was historically forbidden for women to wear lambas made of cotton or any other material than woven raffia mats , as it was believed this could render them more attractive to men outside their clan , with whom they were forbidden to marry . 
 The Antemoro were reputed across the island for being the only ethnic group to have developed a written form of the Malagasy language , sorabe , which used Arabic script ; this form of writing was largely replaced elsewhere by the Latin alphabet under the Merina monarchy in the 19th century . The Antemoro were also widely reputed in the pre @-@ colonial period for their astrologers , who would predict the future based on lunar phases . They were known all across Madagascar and acted as advisers at the court of many Malagasy kings , including the celebrated Merina king Andrianampoinimerina , whose Antemoro astrologers advised him and taught him sorabe writing . The pan @-@ Madagascar tradition of the ombiasy is rooted in this element of Antemoro culture . The introduction of royal sampy ( idols ) into the Kingdom of Imerina is likewise attributed to an Antemoro ombiasy .

 <unk> ( fady ) among the Antemoro derive from ancestral traditions as well as from aspects of Islamic and Arab culture . An Antemoro taboo against dogs as unclean , although shared by Islam , actually predates the arrival of the religion on the island .

A female widow must continue the mourning period until the parents of the deceased declare it completed . A male widower remains shut away in his home for a period of one or two weeks , during which time the parents of the deceased send a female family member to care for him and keep him company .

 The Antemoro speak a dialect of the Malagasy language , which is a branch of the Malayo @-@ Polynesian language group derived from the Barito languages , spoken in southern Borneo . The language is traditionally written using the sorabe script , and those who master this form of writing are called <unk> and are considered to possess unusual power . <unk> writings traditionally ranged from instructional texts for teaching astrology , to historical records and other forms of documentation , and materials written using the sorabe script were considered to be sacred .

 Many Antemoro work as ombiasy and earn their livelihood selling their services as astrologers , sorcerers , or crafters of powerful amulets ; it is common for men to travel for six to ten months out of the year . Coffee production is widespread in the Antemoro homeland and generates income for many families . Those who own little or no land often emigrate to work as agricultural laborers in the north and west . The Antemoro <unk> clan was historically a main producer and trader of sea salt . The Antemoro are well known for their handmade paper , which is often decorated using pressed fresh flowers and leaves . Antemoro paper is a major product marketed to tourists .

 The first formal school in the Kingdom of Imerina was established and run from 1800 to 1804 by two Antemoro ombiasy , <unk> and <unk> , who taught the future King Radama I and four or five other children to read using sorabe , trained them to manufacture ink and paper , and educated them in the art of astrology and divination . <unk> was among the party of three who served as the first ambassadors to Britain and Mauritius ; he died in 1838 from tangena poison administered in a trial by ordeal during the reign of Queen Ranavalona I.

Malawi and Zambia joined the tournament after being invited , and competed as guest teams as they were from the federation Council of Southern Africa Football Associations ( COSAFA ) , whereas the rest of the teams were from the Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations ( CECAFA ) . The reasoning behind their invitation was that it would " boost the competitiveness of this year 's tournament " .

 The CECAFA Cup is considered Africa 's oldest football tournament , and involves teams from Central and Southern Africa .

The tournament was originally the Gossage Cup , contested by the four nations of Kenya , Uganda , Tanganyika ( modern day Tanzania ) , and Zanzibar , running from 1929 until 1965 . In 1967 , this became the East and Central African Senior Challenge Cup , often shortened to simply the Challenge Cup , which was competed for five years , until 1971 , before the CECAFA Cup was introduced in 1973 . Ethiopia were the defending champions , having won the 2005 tournament in Rwanda , after finishing second in their group , and going on to beat Zanzibar and Rwanda in the final .

 = Rule of law doctrine in Singapore = 
 In Singapore , the rule of law doctrine has been the topic of considerable disagreement and debate , largely through differing conceptions of the doctrine . These conceptions can generally be divided into two categories developed by legal academics , the " thin " , or formal , conception and the " thick " , or substantive , conception of the rule of law . The thin conception , often associated with the legal scholars Albert Venn Dicey and Joseph Raz , advocates the view that the rule of law is fulfilled by adhering to formal procedures and requirements , such as the stipulations that all laws be prospective , clear , stable and constitutionally enacted , and that the parties to legal disputes are treated equally and without bias on the part of judges . While people subscribing to the thin conception do not dismiss the importance of the content of the law , they take the view that this is a matter of substantive justice and should not be regarded as part of the concept of the rule of law . On the other hand , the thick conception of the rule of law entails the notion that in addition to the requirements of the thin rule , it is necessary for the law to conform with certain substantive standards of justice and human rights . 
 A thin conception of the rule of law has generally been adopted by the Singapore Government and Members of Parliament from the ruling People 's Action Party , as evidenced from the views expressed during a 1999 parliamentary debate on the rule of law . However , a thicker conception was evinced by the Minister for Law in a speech made during the 2009 seasonal meeting of the New York State Bar Association 's International Section in Singapore . On the other hand , a thick conception of the rule of law that encompasses human rights has been adopted by a number of Government critics , including opposition politicians , and foreign and international organizations such as Human Rights Watch , Lawyers ' Rights Watch Canada and the World Justice Project . 
 Some of the key principles associated with the thin conception of the rule of law include judicial independence , natural justice , the availability of judicial review , and the accessibility of justice . Judicial independence in Singapore is safeguarded by various constitutional provisions and legal rules , though some commentators have highlighted certain events as suggesting a lack of judicial independence . One incident in the 1980s involving the transfer of the Senior District Judge to the Attorney @-@ General 's Chambers following a decision he made which was favourable to an opposition politician was investigated by a commission of inquiry and found not to be due to executive interference . In Singapore , natural justice is generally regarded as a procedural rather than a substantive concept . The process of judicial review involves the review of executive actions for compliance with administrative law rules , and of executive and legislative acts for unconstitutionality in light of the doctrine of constitutional supremacy . The state of the courts and legal processes in Singapore are largely seen as making justice accessible for the citizenry . 
 For those taking a thick conception of the rule of law , the existence of the Internal Security Act ( Cap . 143 , 1985 Rev. Ed . ) ( " ISA " ) is widely regarded as a breach of the doctrine . The Act , which provides for detention without trial for people regarded by the executive as a risk to national security , is shielded from unconstitutionality by Article 149 of the Constitution . Although the Court of Appeal held in the 1988 case Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs that the courts could review the legality of detentions under the Act , the effect of the case was reversed through amendments to the Constitution and the ISA in 1989 . The ISA amendments were determined to be effective by the High Court and Court of Appeal in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs in 1989 and 1990 respectively . While the executive 's largely unconstrained discretion to detain under the ISA has been criticized as contrary to the rule of law , the Government has justified the statute as a crucial measure of last resort for preserving security . 
 = = Introduction = = 
 There have been many attempts to define the rule of law . Academics over the years have come up with various formulations and ideas of what the doctrine should mean . The range of views can roughly be divided into two categories : the " thin " , or formal , conception and the " thick " , or substantive , conception of the rule of law . 
 = = = Thin conception of the rule of law = = = 
 The " thin " conception rule of law advocates the view that the rule of law is fulfilled by adhering to formal procedures and requirements . People who subscribe to the thin conception are not apathetic towards the content of the law . However , as Ronald Dworkin says , " [ t ] hey say that this is a matter of substantive justice , and that substantive justice is an independent ideal , in no sense part of the ideal of the rule of law " . 
 The thin conception of the rule of law is often associated with two academics , Albert Venn Dicey and Joseph Raz . According to Dicey , the rule of law may be regarded from three points of view : 
 The absolute supremacy of regular law – a person is to be judged by a fixed set of rules and punished for breaching only the law , and is not to be subject to " the exercise by persons in authority of wide , arbitrary , or discretionary powers of constraint " . 
 " Legal equality " , that is , " the universal subjection of all classes to one law administered by the ordinary Courts " . 
 The fact that the constitution is the result of the ordinary law of the land . In other words , it is not the source but the consequence of the citizens ' rights . 
 Raz expressed a similar view . Expanding on the concept in a 1977 article , he said that , in its broadest sense , the rule of law means that people should obey the law and be ruled by it . On the other hand , a narrower construction of the rule of law means that the government shall be ruled by and subjected to the law . The doctrine of the rule of law also requires that " the making of particular laws should be guided by open and relatively stable general rules " . If the law is to be obeyed , it " must be capable of guiding the behaviour of its subjects " , in that people can find out what the law is and act accordingly . 
 A number of important principles spring from the basic idea of the rule of law . These may be divided into two groups : principles that ensure the law is capable of guiding its subjects ' behaviour , and principles establishing legal machinery to secure compliance with the rule of law . 
 Principles ensuring the law is capable of guiding behaviour . 
 Laws should be " prospective , open and clear " . The meaning of the law should not be " ambiguous , vague , obscure or imprecise " , and the law must be sufficiently publicized . Furthermore , laws should generally not be retroactive ; but if a retroactive law is to be enacted , the fact that this is going to be done must be known for certain to ensure that the retroactivity does not clash with the rule of law . 
 Laws should be relatively stable and not changed too often , as with frequently changing laws it may be hard for people to keep themselves updated . People need to know what the law is both for short- and long @-@ term planning . 
 The making of particular or specific laws should be " guided by open , stable , clear and general rules " that create a stable framework . There are two types of general rules : those which empower authorities to make orders , and those which provide guidelines for the proper exercise of such powers . 
 Principles establishing legal machinery to secure compliance with the rule of law . 
 Judicial independence is essential . It would be futile for people to approach the courts for adjudication of their disputes if the courts do not apply the law independently . Moreover , people can only be guided by the law if judges apply it correctly . 
 Natural justice must be adhered to . For the law to be applied correctly , requirements such as an open and fair hearing and an absence of bias are essential . 
 Courts must have the power to review primary and subsidiary legislation , and administrative action . 
 The courts should be accessible , since if cases are delayed for long periods , legal costs are prohibitive , and so on , this may " effectively turn the most enlightened law to a dead letter and frustrate one 's ability effectively to guide oneself by the law " . 
 Although crime @-@ preventing agencies such as the police and prosecuting authorities must have some discretion to act , they should not be allowed to " pervert the law " . For example , the police should not be allowed to decide to stop investigating , nor the prosecution be allowed to choose not to prosecute , certain crimes or certain categories of offenders . 
 In Raz 's view , one of the virtues of the rule of law is the restraint it imposes on authorities . It aims to exclude arbitrary power as it is said that most of the exercises of arbitrary power violate the rule of law . Arbitrary power is excluded when courts hold themselves accountable only to the law and observe " fairly strict procedures " . Another virtue is the protection it accords to individual freedom , namely , " the sense of freedom in which it is identified with an effective ability to choose between as many options as possible " . Most importantly , to adhere to the rule of law is to respect human dignity by " treating humans as persons capable of planning and plotting their future " . 
 Raz also identified some of the potential pitfalls of the rule of law . He opined that as the rule of law is designed " to minimise the harm to freedom and dignity which the law may cause in its pursuit of its goals however laudable these may be " , the strict pursuit of the rule of law may prevent one from achieving certain social goals which may be preferable to the rule of law : " Sacrificing too many social goals on the altar of the rule of law may make the law barren and empty " . 
 = = = Thick conception of the rule of law = = = 
 At the other extreme , the " thick " rule of law entails the notion that in addition to the requirements of the thin rule , it is necessary for the law to conform with certain substantive standards of justice and human rights . Ronald Dworkin , one of the leading scholars advocating the thick conception of the rule of law , defines what he terms the " rights conception " of the rule of law as follows : 
 It assumes that citizens have moral rights and duties with respect to one another , and political rights against the state as a whole . It insists that these moral and political rights be recognized in positive law , so that they may be enforced upon the demand of individual citizens through courts or other judicial institutions of the familiar type , so far as this is practicable . The rule of law on this conception is the ideal of rule by an accurate public conception of individual rights . It does not distinguish , as the rule book conception does , between the rule of law and substantive justice ; on the contrary it requires , as part of the ideal of law , that the rules in the book capture and enforce moral rights . 
 Paul Craig , in analysing Dworkin 's view , drew three conclusions . First , Dworkin rejects the need to distinguish between " legal " rules and a more complete political philosophy , since the rule of law is basically the theory of law and adjudication that he believes is correct . Secondly , the rule of law is not simply the thin or formal rule of law ; the latter forms part of Dworkin 's theory of law and adjudication . Thirdly , since taking a substantive view of the rule of law requires choosing what the best theory of justice is , it is necessary to articulate particular conceptions of what liberty , equality and other freedoms require .

 On 24 November 1999 , Non @-@ constituency Member of Parliament Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam moved the following motion in Parliament : " That this House recognises the importance of the Rule of Law and urges the government to ensure the complete and full compliance of the Rule of Law by all Ministers , officials and public servants . " During the ensuing debate , the Members of Parliament ( MPs ) from the ruling People 's Action Party tended to adhere to a thinner , or more formal , conception of the rule of law . For instance , the Minister of State for Law Ho Peng Kee said : 
 In short , the Rule of Law refers to the supremacy of law , as opposed to the arbitrary exercise of power . The other key tenet is that everyone is equal before the law . The concept also includes the notions of the transparency , openness and prospective application of our laws , observation of the principles of natural justice , independence of the Judiciary and judicial review of administrative action . 
 Chin Tet Yung , an MP for Sembawang Group Representation Constituency , commented that the rule of law required that : 
 ... [ a ] ll laws are prospective , stable , properly and constitutionally enacted . The application of laws , the making of legal orders by public officers should be guided by clear and general rules , that is , avoiding any personal bias or favour , treating equal cases equally , making decisions rationally and in the public interest , and in accordance with the written laws of the land . ... In this particular principle where you have laws , obviously such laws must be applied and obviously the laws are applied by public officers who make legal orders . If these legal orders are substantiated by subsidiary legislation , if this subsidiary legislation is sanctioned by parent Acts , by the primary legislation , then any order issuing from it would be legitimate and would comply with the Rule of Law . And , if anyone is unhappy with that , there is always the next aspect or principle of the Rule of Law , and that is , that the judiciary has the power and the authority to review any administrative action . So that is the third principle . The final principle ... is that the judiciary must be independent and the courts should be generally accessible to all who seek recourse to them . 
 Chin moved an amendment to the motion introduced by Jeyaretnam so that it read : " That this House ( 1 ) values the importance of the Rule of Law ; and ( 2 ) commends the Government for upholding the Rule of Law and ensuring that it is fully observed by all . " The amendment motion was eventually voted on and agreed to by a majority of MPs in Parliament . 
 In a speech made on 27 October 2009 at a plenary session entitled Singapore and the Rule of Law at the seasonal meeting of the New York State Bar Association 's International Section in Singapore , Minister for Law K. Shanmugam said that he would not try to define the rule of law comprehensively or analyse it from an academic viewpoint , but , practically speaking , the key aspects of a society based on the rule of law are the following : 
 Exercise of State power should be through laws that are publicly known and enacted legitimately . 
 There should be independent , credible Courts to apply the law and decide on disputes between individuals , as well as between individuals and the State . There must be Separation of Powers . 
 No person should be above the law . That should apply in equal measure to the Government and officials as much as it does to everyone else . 
 There should be credible and effective means for people to challenge the arbitrary exercise of power . 
 However , evincing a thicker conception of the rule of law , he added that most people accepted two additional elements " as being part of how a modern civilised society should be structured " , though he felt it was " debatable whether they are part of a strict definition of Rule of Law " . These elements were that " [ t ] he people must have the sovereign right to elect their Government " , and that " laws must not offend that society 's norms of fairness and justice " . 
 = = = Thick conception = = = 
 A number of critics of the Government of Singapore have adopted a thick , or substantive , conception of the rule of law that encompasses the protection of human rights . In a chapter entitled " Rights and the Rule of Law " in his 1994 book Dare to Change , Singapore Democratic Party ( SDP ) member ( and later Secretary @-@ General ) Chee Soon Juan criticized , among other things , the Government 's use of the Internal Security Act ( " ISA " ) to detain persons without trial , and the lack of freedom of speech and assembly . In an open letter published on the SDP website dated 6 January 2009 which was addressed to the Chief Justice , Attorney @-@ General and Law Minister , he said : " [ T ] he rule of law is not just a system where the government passes legislation and everyone unquestioningly obeys . The concept of the rule of law necessitates the limitation of state power and the respect of human rights . Our Constitution spells out what these limitations are . It also defines the rights of the citizen . " And in a speech delivered to the International Bar Association Conference in Dubai on 4 November 2011 , he cited a free media and the rights to free expression and peaceful assembly as essential elements of the rule of law . 
 During the 24 November 1999 Parliamentary debate on the rule of law , Jeyaretnam traced the doctrine to the Magna Carta , and said that it was to be found in the Constitution of Singapore , particularly in Article 9 and Article 12 , which respectively protect the rights to life and personal liberty , and equality rights . He also noted that in the court judgment Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor ( 1980 ) , the Privy Council had held that in phrases such as " in accordance with law " and " equality before the law " in the Constitution , the term law does not only mean Acts passed by Parliament , but also includes the fundamental rules of natural justice that have been accepted and become part and parcel of the common law . He then cited eight instances of the Government 's alleged non @-@ compliance with the rule of law , including detention without trial under , inter alia , the ISA and the Criminal Law ( Temporary Provisions ) Act ( " CLTPA " ) ; denial of the right of arrested persons to counsel and to visits from their families for a period of time ; denial of the rights to freedom of speech and assembly ; and the tendency of the executive not to provide reasons for decisions made . Opposition MP Chiam See Tong complained that the Government had not treated opposition parties fairly as regards applications for licences for events . 
 Criticisms about the ISA and the state of freedom of speech and assembly in Singapore also appear in reports by some foreign and international organizations . A 2007 report by Lawyers ' Rights Watch Canada , Rule of Law in Singapore , alleged that defamation and bankruptcy law had been used to oppress the political opposition , and expressed concern about stringent limits on the freedom of assembly and detention under the ISA . 
 In its Rule of Law Index 2011 , the World Justice Project defined the rule of law as " a rules @-@ based system in which the following four universal principles are upheld " : 
 The government and its officials and agents are accountable under the law . 
 The laws are clear , publicized , stable , and fair , and protect fundamental rights , including the security of persons and property . 
 The process by which the laws are enacted , administered , and enforced is accessible , fair , and efficient . 
 Access to justice is provided by competent , independent , and ethical adjudicators , attorneys or representatives , and judicial officers who are of sufficient number , have adequate resources , and reflect the makeup of the communities they serve . [ Emphasis added . ] 
 Singapore was ranked highly on factors such as order and security ( with a ranking of 2 out of the 66 countries assessed ) , absence of corruption ( 4 / 66 ) , and effective criminal justice ( 5 / 66 ) , but less highly on open government ( 19 / 66 ) , limited government powers ( 20 / 66 ) and fundamental rights ( 39 / 66 ) . In particular , the Index noted that " [ n ] <unk> the country 's outstanding performance in most categories , there are substantial limitations on freedom of speech and freedom of assembly , with Singapore in 49th and 60th place , respectively , out of all 66 countries " . 
 The Human Rights Watch Singapore : Country Summary of January 2012 commented negatively on restrictions on the rights to free speech , assembly and association , such as limitations on print , broadcast and online media , and outdoor gatherings ; contempt of court proceedings against Alan Shadrake ; and the gazetting of The Online Citizen blog as a " political association " , thus preventing it from receiving foreign funding . It also criticized the existence of the ISA and CLTPA , the use of caning as a punishment , and the continued criminalization of sexual acts between consenting men under section 377A of the Penal Code . The Ministry of Law described the report as " inaccurate " and containing " false assertions " .

 = = = Principles associated with the thin conception = = = 
 = = = = Judicial independence = = = = 
 Raz identified judicial independence as one of the essential principles of the rule of law . In this context , judicial independence refers to the judiciary 's independence from the legislative and executive branches of the government . Singapore 's judiciary enjoys a certain measure of independence provided by various constitutional safeguards such as security of tenure and remuneration . Judges are also relatively free from executive and legislative influence . A retired Supreme Court judge , L.P. Thean , has said that it is theoretically possible for the executive to make political appointments to the Bench , to reduce a judge 's remuneration by amending the Constitution , or to take away the judiciary 's vital support staff , but " [ t ] he fact remains , however , that nothing of that kind has ever been done " . 
 Various provisions of the Constitution guarantee the independence of the Supreme Court judiciary . Since Article 93 vests judicial power exclusively in the courts , judicial power is to be solely exercised by the judiciary and not by the executive or legislature , thus reflecting the former 's independence from the other branches of government . Article 94 ensures that the office of a Supreme Court Judge will " not be abolished during his continuance in office " , while Article 98 provides for judges ' security of tenure until the age of 65 years , barring misbehaviour , inability , infirmity of body or mind , or any other cause that prevents judges from properly discharging the functions of their office . A judge may only be removed from office on these grounds by the President on the advice of a tribunal of judges of the Supreme Court or those who hold or have held equivalent offices in the Commonwealth . Article 98 also provides that the remuneration and other terms of office of Supreme Court judges may not be altered to their disadvantage following their appointment . Article 99 restricts parliamentary debate on the conduct of a Supreme Court judge unless on a substantive motion supported by at least a quarter of all MPs . 
 However , it has been argued by some commentators that Singapore falls short where some aspects of judicial independence are concerned . For instance , Supreme Court judges above the age of 65 may be reappointed on a term basis . It has been suggested that this may result in " the unsavoury possibility of judges being ' beholden ' to the executive " . This point was also raised by Jeyaretnam in Parliament in 1986 with respect to the then Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin . However , an academic has pointed out that removing entirely the system of extensions may not serve the larger interest at the end of the day if excellent judges have to retire due to the mandatory requirement . 
 Judges of the Subordinate Courts do not enjoy the security of tenure enjoyed by the Supreme Court judges . As officers of the Singapore Legal Service , it is said that there is a risk of executive interference because judges may be removed from their judicial positions or transferred to lower @-@ ranking positions elsewhere within the Legal Service by the Legal Service Commission ( LSC ) . In 1984 , the Senior District Judge Michael Khoo acquitted Opposition Member of Parliament J.B. Jeyaratnam of all but one minor charge in a case involving cheques for the Workers ' Party of Singapore which had allegedly been fraudulently handled . The acquittal was overturned on appeal to the High Court , and a retrial ordered . However , before the retrial took place , Khoo was transferred from his position on the Bench to the Attorney @-@ General 's Chambers to take up the post of deputy public prosecutor . This was considered to be a demotion . In 1986 , Jeyaratnam claimed in Parliament that the transfer had been made because Khoo had ruled in his favour in the 1984 case . However , a commission of inquiry formed to look into the circumstances surrounding the transfer found no evidence of this . For making the allegation , Jeyaratnam was referred to Parliament 's Committee of Privileges for abusing parliamentary privilege . While the Committee was considering the matter , Jeyaretnam wrote five newsletters about the Committee 's proceedings and sent them to residents of his constituency . On 9 October 1986 , the Leader of the House made a written complaint regarding the newsletters ' contents to the Speaker of Parliament , which the Committee also considered . On 27 January 1987 Parliament accepted the Committee 's reports on the complaints and found Jeyaretnam guilty of abusing the privileges of Parliament by alleging executive interference in the judiciary , and of contempt of the Committee and Parliament by publishing the newsletters . Fines totalling S $ 26 @,@ 000 were imposed . 
 Another concern which has been raised is that the routine shuffling of Subordinate Courts judges between the executive and judicial branches may result in them " <unk> [ ing ] the executive 's corporatist ideology , carrying that into adjudication , as a ' judiciary of amateurs ' " . On the other hand , while a potential for executive interference exists due to the LSC 's control of Subordinate Court judicial appointments , it has been commented that in a small state like Singapore it may not be practical to have a separate judicial and legal service . Also , the appointment process may not be detrimental to the independence of the lower judiciary as the Chief Justice , who is not part of the executive or legislature , is the head of the LSC and has the final say on judicial postings . It has also been noted that , as much as institutional processes play a part in judicial independence , ultimately the willingness of judiciary to stand up to executive and legislative influence is the most important factor in ensuring an independent judiciary . 
 Another incident said to have affected judicial independence in Singapore was the move by Parliament to amend the Constitution and the ISA to reverse the effect of the Court of Appeal 's decision Chng Suan Tze v. Minister of Home Affairs ( 1988 ) ( discussed in detail below ) . It has been asked if Parliament had " taken away absolutely the judicial power of review for ISA preventive detention cases " , and whether this reflected the Legislature 's " distrust in the independence of the Judiciary and its ability to deal impartially with ISA cases that affect national security notwithstanding the limited form of judicial review laid down in Chng Suan Tze . " Another commentator has framed it as " an attack on the judiciary simply because it removes a vital aspect of judicial power " and that this " undermines judicial credibility " . 
 = = = = Natural justice = = = = 
 It has been noted generally that natural justice is a fundamental element of the rule of law . In administrative law , the two principles of natural justice , which constitute a framework for common law procedural rights , are the rule against bias ( <unk> iudex in causa sua , or " no man a judge in his own cause " ) and the right to be heard ( audi alteram partem , or " hear the other side " ) . In the Australian case Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria v. Wood Hall Ltd . & Leonard Pipeline Contractors Ltd . ( 1978 ) , the Supreme Court of Victoria said that the ideas underlying both principles are that of " fairness and judgement only after a full and fair hearing given to all parties . " Speaking in Parliament on 24 November 1999 , MP Toh See Kiat expressed the view that the Singapore legal system does apply the rules of natural justice , which he described thus : " [ N ] <unk> justice requires essentially two basic principles . One is that you have the right to be heard and to explain your case , and , two , is the right to equal treatment . A right to have your case heard also means that there is a review . " 
 As was noted previously , the word law in provisions of the Constitution such as Articles 9 and 12 includes fundamental rules of natural justice . Jack Tsen @-@ Ta Lee has suggested that these fundamental rules are both procedural and substantive in nature , and that substantive natural justice gives the courts discretion to strike down a law if its very object is unreasonable and oppressive . Under this view , to interpret Article 9 ( 1 ) as permitting Parliament to enact any provision that <unk> from an individual 's personal liberty no matter how arbitrary or oppressive as long as procedural natural justice is observed , drains it of all content . Also , instead of the invalidation of legislation in this manner being seen as an encroachment by the judiciary into the legislature 's sphere , the application of substantive natural justice would simply be a full exercise of the judiciary 's proper constitutional role . Lee submits that Singapore courts should follow the Indian courts and apply a reasonableness test to determine if legislation is substantively constitutional . Ultimately , being able to review legislation by applying the substantive aspect of natural justice would " entitle courts to examine whether it is appropriate for the legislature to deprive individual of certain aspects of their personal liberty , and the manner in which such deprivation is achieved . " 
 Conversely , Andrew Harding has argued that the idea of substantive natural justice is vague and subjective , and has taken the view that fundamental rules of natural justice are entirely procedural in nature . In his opinion , Article 12 ( 1 ) of the Constitution is designed to prevent substantively discriminatory legislation . To determine whether legislation is discriminatory , a rational nexus test is applied . It would be strange if legislation that passed this test could nonetheless be struck down due to inconsistency with natural justice . Therefore , the extension of Article 12 ( 1 ) to include natural justice shows that the Privy Council in Ong Ah Chuan could not have intended to apply natural justice in a substantive sense . Further support for this argument can be found in the Privy Council 's decision Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor ( 1981 ) which discussed fundamental rules of natural justice in a procedural context , their Lordships stating that they had to consider " whether the consequence of the alteration [ of certain statutory provisions ] is a procedure for the trial of criminal offences that is contrary to some fundamental rule of natural justice " . The substantive review of legislation by the court was also rejected in Jabar bin <unk> v. Public Prosecutor ( 1995 ) , the Court of Appeal holding that " any law which provides for the deprivation of a person 's life or personal liberty , is valid and binding so long as it is validly passed by Parliament . The court is not concerned with whether it is also fair , just and reasonable as well . " Subsequently , in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney @-@ General ( 2011 ) , the Court held that fundamental rules of natural justice and the principles of natural justice in administrative law " are the same in nature and function , except that they operate at different levels of our legal order , one to invalidate legislation on the ground of unconstitutionality , and the other to invalidate administrative decisions on the ground of administrative law principles " . 
 = = = = Judicial review = = = = 
 Judicial review is the means by which legal rights are protected and good governance enforced . The ability of the courts to judicially review legislation and administrative action is considered an element of the rule of law . In R. v. Committee of the Lords of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council acting for the Visitor of the University of London , ex parte <unk> ( 1987 ) , Judge Simon Brown said : " Judicial review is the exercise of the court 's inherent power at common law to determine whether action is lawful or not ; in a word to uphold the rule of law " . 
 In Singapore , the vital role that the judiciary plays as a check on executive power was noted by the Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze , which held that all power given by law has legal limits and that " the rule of law demands that the courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power " . This is further illustrated by Law Society of Singapore v. Tan Guat Neo Phyllis ( 2008 ) , in which it was stated that prosecutorial discretion is subject to judicial review and may be curtailed where exercised in bad faith or for extraneous purposes , or is in contravention of constitutional rights . In Chee Siok Chin v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 2005 ) , the High Court held that if a litigant " genuinely seek [ s ] the court 's assistance in vindicating or determining a legitimate grievance , the court has a duty to assess such a grievance and accord proper and serious consideration in determining whether relief should be granted " . Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong has also said it is the role of the courts in Singapore to give litigants their rights , whilst simultaneously playing a supporting role in the promotion of good governance through the articulation of clear rules and principles by which the executive can conform with the rule of law . He noted that 27 @.@ 8 % of judicial review cases in Singapore since 1957 have been successful . 
 However , certain matters are regarded as impervious to judicial review owing to limitations in the courts ' institutional capacity . Courts are generally reluctant to get involved in affairs relating to national security , leaving this role to the Government . At the same time , Singaporean courts are committed to careful scrutiny of matters to decide whether they are indeed non @-@ justiciable , as affirmed in the Lee Hsien Loong v. Review Publishing Co . Ltd . ( 2007 ) . This case held that courts would exclude matters involving " high policy " from their purview , but still analyse cases carefully to determine whether or not they truly fell within areas of executive immunity . Also , limitations on the role of the court have led to the rational conclusion that certain other areas are to be excluded from judicial review . These include matters in which the court lacks expertise and those which are polycentric , as was held in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney @-@ General . 
 = = = = Accessibility of justice = = = = 
 Generally , justice is costly to provide and many legal systems , especially in Asia , are fraught with issues such as weak legal institutions , corrupt and incompetent administrative officers and judges , excessive delays and limited access to justice stemming from high legal costs and the lack of legal aid . It was agreed during the World Justice Forum in 2008 that access to justice is key to advancing the rule of law . 
 The extent to which citizens have access to justice in any given society depends on whether a thick or thin conception of rule of law is adopted . Raz , speaking about a thin conception , proposed that the rule of the law requires courts to be accessible – that is , the legal system , at a bare minimum , should comprise formal institutions and mechanisms for administering appropriate legal processes and outcomes . A legal system complying with the thin rule of law also requires that laws are fairly , equally and effectively applied . On the other hand , when a thick conception of the rule of law is taken , a greater emphasis is placed on elements of substantive justice . It is suggested that a legal system operating as such may , in addition to the basic elements of access to justice in a thin rule of law , incorporate a moral or political philosophy , may incorporate ideas of " democracy and legality " , and give precedence to human rights in the administration of justice . Access to justice operating under a thick rule of law may be achieved by , among other things , increasing the efficiency of the judicial process , and having a robust legal profession , an incorruptible and independent judiciary , and a set of supporting institutions in order to increase the quality of justice administered . 
 In Singapore , ensuring widespread and equal access to justice for Singapore citizens is a constant goal . In this respect , the judiciary takes effort to ensure that both procedural and substantive elements of the rule of law are fulfilled – firstly , by continually increasing the efficiency of the courts and legal processes , and secondly , by regularly improving the skills , knowledge and values of and judges . 
 In 1988 , the Singapore courts undertook the enormous task of clearing their extremely large backlogs in order to facilitate Singapore 's future development as an international business and finance centre . A multifaceted approach was adopted to dispose of cases expeditiously , including , among other things , the appointment of more judges and judicial commissioners , the use of information technology , electronic filing of documents and promoting the use of alternative dispute resolution . Such efforts significantly expedited the management of cases , both in the Supreme Court and the Subordinate Courts . In particular , specialized courts such as small claims tribunals , the Family Court and the Night Court were set up for better distribution of cases and have also helped to significantly reduce court fees . Over and above increasing the institutional capacity and efficiency of the courts , improving access to justice in Singapore has also meant a need for a corresponding increase in the quality of justice administered . Efforts to achieve this goal centre mainly on the appointment of the " best and brightest officers " and in particular , the constant upgrading of their skills and knowledge for judicial excellence . For this purpose , the Judicial Education Board was set up to provide guidance , training programmes and workshops for members of the judiciary , and is supported by a training unit within the Strategic Planning and Training Division of the Subordinate Courts . Such efforts aim to upgrade the competence of judges and equip them with the requisite knowledge for handling increasingly complex cases . 
 Today , there are relatively few barriers to court access for litigants . The availability of legal aid and free mediation services aid litigants who may not be able to afford legal fees , and the use of video links and establishment of regional offices of small claims tribunals in various parts of Singapore assist parties who have difficulty coming to court . 
 = = = Principles associated with the thick conception = = = 
 = = = = Criticisms of the Internal Security Act = = = = 
 As indicated above , a number of those who adopt a thick conception of the rule of law in Singapore criticize the existence of the Internal Security Act . The main point of contention is whether section 8 ( 1 ) of the Act should be interpreted in a subjective or objective way . This provision states that " [ i ] f the President is satisfied with respect to any person that , with a view to preventing that person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore or any part thereof or to the maintenance of public order or essential services therein , it is necessary to do so " , the Minister for Home Affairs shall order that the person be , among other things , detained without trial for up to two years . 
 In Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1971 ) , the High Court affirmed that with respect to the President 's satisfaction that a person is acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore , mala fides or bad faith was " not ... a justiciable issue in the context of the Act and the power conferred by the Act on a body such as the President who has to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet to direct the issue of an order of detention if the President is satisfied with a view to preventing a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore etc " . Essentially , this means that the President 's satisfaction is subjective , and not objective . The effect of this decision is that " the Constitution left it to the executive , and not the judiciary , to decide what national security required " . Subsequently , in Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1988 ) , the Court of Appeal took a different stand , holding that the objective test should apply to the review of the exercise of discretion under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA . ( Section 10 empowers the Minister to direct that a detention order be suspended " as the Minister sees fit " , as well as to revoke such a direction . ) The Court said that " the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion is contrary to the rule of law " because " all power has legal limits " , and therefore the exercise of discretionary power warrants examination by the court . 
 Following this decision , the Parliament moved quickly to curb the judiciary 's change in stance . The Internal Security ( Amendment ) Act 1989 was enacted on 25 January 1989 and came into force on 30 January . In particular , section 8B ( 1 ) declared : 
 [ T ] he law governing the judicial review of any decision made or act done in pursuance of any power conferred upon the President or the Minister by the provisions of this Act shall be the same as was applicable and declared in Singapore on the 13th day of July 1971 ; and no part of the law before , on or after that date of any other country in the Commonwealth relating to judicial review shall apply . 
 Section 8B ( 2 ) contained an ouster clause that restricted the scope of judicial review to any question relating to compliance with any procedural requirements of the ISA governing acts or decisions by the President or the Home Affairs Minister . The amendments to the ISA were made retrospective by section 8D , which meant that they applied to judicial review proceedings that had been started before the amendment Act came into force . In addition , the Constitution was amended through the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore ( Amendment ) Act 1989 to prevent the Internal Security ( Amendment ) Act 1989 from being challenged as unconstitutional . Article 149 ( 3 ) was inserted into the Constitution , with the effect that if the issue of whether any executive decision made pursuant to the ISA came before a court ( whether before or after this constitutional amendment came into force on 27 January 1989 ) , the court had to decide this issue according to the new provisions introduced by the 1989 ISA amendments . Article 149 ( 1 ) was amended to add Articles 11 and 12 to the list of fundamental liberties that the ISA cannot be challenged against , and to extend its immunizing effect to the 1989 ISA amendments . 
 The validity of the 1989 ISA amendments was challenged unsuccessfully before the High Court and Court of Appeal in 1989 and 1990 respectively in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs . The High Court held that the 1989 amendments had merely reaffirmed the legal principles laid down in Lee Mau Seng and thus could not be characterized as being contrary to the rule of law or having usurped judicial power : 
 There is no abrogation of judicial power . It is erroneous to contend that the rule of law has been abolished by legislation and that Parliament has stated its absolute and conclusive judgment in applications for judicial review or other actions . Parliament has done no more than to enact the rule of law relating to the law applicable to judicial review . The 
 legislation does not direct the court to enter a particular judgment or dismiss a particular case . The court is left to deal with the case on the basis of the amendments . Legislation designed against subversion must necessarily include provisions to ensure the effectiveness of preventive detention . The amendments are intended to do just that . 
 On appeal , the Court of Appeal confirmed that it had to decide the case in accordance with the legal principles laid down in Lee Mau Seng as the effect of section 8B ( 1 ) of the ISA was clear . Applying those legal principles , the Court held that the appellant had failed to prove that her detention had been made for reasons unrelated to national security . 
 During the 1999 parliamentary debate on the rule of law , Jeyaretnam asserted that detention without trial under the ISA contravened the doctrine as " there is no way of checking the Minister 's decision , who decides to make an order detaining a subject , depriving him of his liberty , completely contrary to the rule of natural justice and the fundamental principle that all men are free " . He called for the provisions in the Act permitting such detention to be repealed , saying : " The power is only necessary in emergency times when there is a real threat and so we do not need it any more . Let us for once realise that it is a violation of the Rule of Law . Let us be honest and repeal it . " Nominated Member of Parliament Simon Tay expressed the view that " the ISA fulfills the Constitution as an exception . It does not fulfill the concept of the Rule of Law in the sense that there are only very limited grounds on which a court can review the decision of the Minister . It is in that sense a subjective discretion . " Nonetheless , he recognized that the ISA remained relevant , for instance , as a tool against people alleged to have engaged in espionage , and thus preventive detention could not be definitively declared right or wrong : " It is a case @-@ by @-@ case decision , because that is how we live our lives in a real society . " Responding to Jeyaretnam , Ho Peng Kee noted that the justifications for the ISA had been fully debated in Parliament on previous occasions , and emphasized that there are safeguards in place to tackle the apparent arbitrariness of detentions under the Act , including a review of each detention by an advisory board composed of a Supreme Court judge and two prominent members of the public , and also the President 's personal discretion to order a detainee 's release in the event that the advisory board and Home Affairs Minister disagreed over the necessity for the detention . 
 Speaking at the 2009 seasonal meeting of the New York State Bar Association 's International Section in Singapore , Shanmugam explained that stability was one of the essential conditions for Singapore 's governance , and that the ISA contributed to the stability of the country by enabling terrorist threats to be dealt with . In response , Michael Galligan , the Chairman of the International Section , wrote that " whatever might be appropriate for times of extraordinary danger should not be assumed to be the measure for ordinary times . <unk> of liberties that may have some arguable justification in a national defense crisis should not set the norm for more peaceful or more ' ordinary ' times in the life of a nation . " In a 16 September 2011 statement , the Ministry of Home Affairs said that the Government had used the ISA " sparingly " , and not for detaining people solely for their political beliefs . It expressed the view that " [ t ] he ISA continues to be relevant and crucial as a measure of last resort for the preservation of our national security " .

 = Amenhotep I = 
 Amenhotep I ( / <unk> / ) from Ancient Egyptian " <unk> @-@ <unk> " or " <unk> " meaning " Amun is satisfied " or <unk> I ( / <unk> / ) from Ancient Greek <unk> , was the second Pharaoh of the 18th dynasty of Egypt . His reign is generally dated from 1526 to 1506 BC . He was a son of Ahmose I and Ahmose @-@ Nefertari , but had at least two elder brothers , Ahmose @-@ ankh and Ahmose <unk> , and was not expected to inherit the throne . However , sometime in the eight years between Ahmose I 's 17th regnal year and his death , his heir apparent died and Amenhotep became crown prince . He then acceded to the throne and ruled for about 21 years . 
 Although his reign is poorly documented , it is possible to piece together a basic history from available evidence . He inherited the kingdom formed by his father 's military conquests and maintained dominance over Nubia and the Nile Delta but probably did not attempt to maintain Egyptian power in Syrio @-@ Palestine . He continued the rebuilding of temples in Upper Egypt and revolutionized mortuary complex design by separating his tomb from his mortuary temple , setting a trend in royal funerary monuments which would persist throughout the New Kingdom . After his death , he was deified as a patron god of Deir el @-@ Medina . 
 = = Family = = 
 Amenhotep I was the son of Ahmose I and Ahmose @-@ Nefertari . His elder brothers , the crown prince Ahmose <unk> and Ahmose @-@ ankh , died before him , thus clearing the way for his ascension to the throne . Amenhotep probably came to power while he was still young himself , and his mother , Ahmose @-@ Nefertari , appears to have been regent for him for at least a short time . The evidence for this regency is that both he and his mother are credited with founding a settlement for workers in the Theban Necropolis at Deir el @-@ Medina . Amenhotep took his sister Ahmose @-@ <unk> as his Great Royal Wife . Another wife 's name , <unk> , is attested on a nineteenth dynasty stele . 
 Beyond this , the relationships between Amenhotep I and other possible family members are unclear . Ahhotep II is usually called his wife and sister , despite an alternate theory that she was his grandmother . He is thought to have had one son by Ahhotep II , Amenemhat , who died while still very young . This remains the consensus , although there are arguments against that relationship as well . With no living heirs , Amenhotep was succeeded by Thutmose I , whom he married to his " sister " , Aahmes , . Since Aahmes is never given the title " King 's Daughter " in any inscription , some scholars doubt whether she was a sibling of Amenhotep I. 
 = = Dates and length of reign = = 
 In Amenhotep I 's ninth regnal year , a heliacal rise of Sothis was observed on the ninth day of the third month of summer . Modern astronomers have calculated that , if the observation was made from Memphis or Heliopolis , such an observation could only have been made on that day in 1537 BC . If the observation was made in Thebes , however , it could only have taken place in 1517 . The latter choice is usually accepted as correct since Thebes was the capital during the early 18th dynasty ; hence , Amenhotep I is usually given an accession date in 1526 BC , although the possibility of 1546 BC is not entirely dismissed . 
 Manetho 's Epitome states that Amenhotep I ruled Egypt for twenty years and seven months or twenty @-@ one years , depending on the source . While Amenhotep I 's highest attested regnal year is only his Year 10 , Manetho 's statement is confirmed by a passage in the tomb autobiography of a magician named Amenemhet . This explicitly states that he served under Amenhotep I for 21 Years . Thus , in the high chronology , Amenhotep I is given a reign from around 1546 to 1526 BC and , in the low chronology , from around 1526 to 1506 BC or 1525 to 1504 BC , though individual scholars may ascribe dates to his reign that vary from these by a few years . 
 = = Foreign policy = = 
 Amenhotep I 's Horus and Two Ladies names , " Bull who conquers the lands " and " He who inspires great terror , " are generally interpreted to mean that Amenhotep I intended to dominate the surrounding nations . Two tomb texts indicate that he led campaigns into Nubia . According to the tomb texts of Ahmose , son of Ebana , Amenhotep later sought to expand Egypt 's border southward into Nubia and he led an invasion force which defeated the Nubian army . The tomb biography of Ahmose Pen @-@ <unk> says he also fought in a campaign in Kush , however it is quite possible that it refers to the same campaign as Ahmose , son of Ebana . Amenhotep built a temple at <unk> , showing that he had established Egyptian settlements almost as far as the third cataract . 
 A single reference in the tomb of Ahmose Pen @-@ <unk> indicates another campaign in <unk> in the land of Kehek . Unfortunately , the location of Kehek is unknown . It was long believed that Kehek was a reference to the Libyan tribe , <unk> , and thus it was postulated that invaders from Libya took advantage of the death of Ahmose to move into the western Nile Delta . Unfortunately for this theory , the <unk> people only appeared in later times , and Kehek 's identity remains unknown . Nubia is a possibility , since Amenhotep did campaign there , and the western desert and the oases have also been suggested , since these seem to have fallen under Egyptian control once again . 
 Egypt had lost the western desert and the oases during the second intermediate period , and during the revolt against the Hyksos , Kamose thought it necessary to garrison them . It is uncertain when they were fully retaken , but on one stele , the title " Prince @-@ Governor of the oases " was used , which means that Amenhotep 's reign forms the terminus ante quem for the return of Egyptian rule . 
 There are no recorded campaigns in Syro @-@ Palestine during Amenhotep I 's reign . However , according to the Tombos Stela of his successor , Thutmose I , when Thutmose led a campaign into Asia all the way to the Euphrates , he found no one who fought against him . If Thutmose did not lead a campaign which has not been recorded into Asia before this recorded one , it would mean that the preceding pharaoh would have had to pacify Syria instead , which would indicate a possible Asiatic campaign of Amenhotep I. Two references to the Levant potentially written during his reign might be contemporary witnesses to such a campaign . One of the candidates for Amenhotep 's tomb contains a reference to <unk> , which is somewhere in Canaan or the Transjordan , and Amenemhet 's tomb contains a hostile reference to Mitanni . However , neither of these references necessarily refer to campaigning , nor do they even necessarily date to Amenhotep 's reign . The location of Amenhotep 's tomb is not certain , and Amenemhet lived to serve under multiple kings who are known to have attacked Mitanni . Records from Amenhotep 's reign are simply altogether too scant and too vague to reach a conclusion about any Syrian campaign . 
 = = Cultural and intellectual developments = = 
 Large numbers of statues of Amenhotep have been found , but they are mostly from the Ramesside period and relate to his continuing funerary cult , made for his posthumous funerary cult . This makes study of the art of his reign difficult . Based upon his few authentic statues , it appears that Amenhotep continued the practice of copying Middle Kingdom styles . Art in the early 18th dynasty was particularly similar to that of the early Middle Kingdom , and the statues produced by Amenhotep I clearly copied those of Mentuhotep II and Senusret I. The two types are so similar that modern Egyptologists have had trouble telling the two apart . 
 It was probably Amenhotep I who founded the artisans village at Deir el @-@ Medina , whose inhabitants were responsible for much of the art which filled the tombs in the Theban Necropolis for the following generations of New Kingdom rulers and nobles . The earliest name found there is that of Thutmose I , however Amenhotep was clearly an important figure to the city 's workmen since he and his mother were both its patron deities . 
 Amenhotep 's reign saw literary developments . The Book of What is in the Underworld ( ' the Egyptian Book of the Dead ' ) , an important funerary text used in the New Kingdom , is believed to have reached its final form during Amenhotep 's reign , since it first appears in the decoration of the tomb of his successor Thutmose I. The Ebers papyrus , which is the main source for information on ancient Egyptian medicine , also seems to date to this time ( the mention of the Heliacal rise of Sothis by which the early New Kingdom chronology is usually calculated was found on the back of this document ) . 
 It appears that during Amenhotep I 's reign the first water clock was invented . Amenhotep 's court astronomer <unk> took credit for creating this device in his tomb biography , although the oldest surviving mechanism dates to the reign of Amenhotep III . This invention was of great benefit for timekeeping , because the Egyptian hour was not a fixed amount of time , but was measured as 1 / 12 of the night . When the nights were shorter in the summer , these <unk> could be adjusted to measure the shorter hours accurately . 
 = = Building projects = = 
 Amenhotep began or continued a number of building projects at temple sites in Upper Egypt but most of the structures he built were later dismantled or obliterated by his successors . From written sources it is known that he commissioned the architect Ineni to expand the Temple of Karnak . Ineni 's tomb biography indicates that he created a 20 cubit gate of limestone on the south side of Karnak . He constructed a sacred barque chapel of Amun out of alabaster and a copy of the White Chapel of Senusret III . Sculpted material from these structures has been recovered from the fill of Amenhotep III 's third pylon allowing some of these structures to be rebuilt at Karnak . Amenhotep also built structures at Karnak for his Sed festival , a festival by which a pharaoh 's strength and vigour was renewed after reigning 30 years , but it seems likely that he died before he could use them . A temple was constructed in Nubia at <unk> , and he built temple structures in Upper Egypt at Elephantine , Kom <unk> , Abydos , and the Temple of Nekhbet . As far as is known Amenhotep did not build anything of significance in Lower Egypt , like his father . 
 = = = Mortuary complex = = = 
 Amenhotep I was the first king of Egypt to separate his mortuary temple from his tomb , probably in an attempt to keep his tomb safe from robbers . This temple was sited at the north end of Deir el @-@ Bahri . Deir el @-@ Bahri appears to have had some sort of funerary significance for Amenhotep , since Theban Tomb 358 , the tomb of his queen Ahmose @-@ <unk> , was also found nearby . Amenhotep 's mortuary temple was largely demolished to make way for the lower terrace of the mortuary temple constructed approximately 50 years later by Queen Hatshepsut , and only a few bricks inscribed with Amenhotep 's name remain . The royal statues inside of the temple were moved to the nearby funerary temple of Mentuhotep II . 
 The original location of Amenhotep 's tomb has not been securely identified . A report on the security of royal tombs in the Theban Necropolis commissioned during the troubled reign of Ramesses IX noted that it was then intact , but its location was not specified . Two sites for Amenhotep I 's tomb have been proposed , one high up in the Valley of the Kings , <unk> and the other at Dra ' Abu el @-@ Naga ' , Tomb ANB . Excavations at KV 39 suggest it was used or reused to store the Deir el @-@ Bahri Cache , which included the king 's well @-@ preserved mummy , before its final reburial . However , Tomb ANB is considered the more likely possibility , because it contains objects bearing his name and the names of some family members . 
 = = Burial , succession , and legacy = = 
 = = = Burial = = = 
 Sometime during the 20th or 21st Dynasty Amenhotep 's original tomb was either robbed or deemed insecure and emptied and his body was moved for safety , probably more than once . It was found in the Deir el @-@ Bahri Cache , hidden with the mummies of numerous New Kingdom kings and nobles in or after the late 22nd dynasty above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut and is now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo . His mummy had apparently not been looted by the 21st dynasty , and the priests who moved the mummy took care to keep the <unk> intact . Because of that exquisite face mask , Amenhotep 's is the only royal mummy which has not been unwrapped and examined by modern Egyptologists . 
 = = = Succession = = = 
 Amenhotep I is thought to have had only one child , a son who died in infancy ( although some sources indicate he had no children ) . Amenhotep I was succeeded by Thutmose I , apparently a senior military figure . It is unclear if there was any blood relationship between the two , although it has been suggested that Thutmose I was a son of Amenhotep 's elder brother Ahmose <unk> . Amenhotep may have appointed Thutmose I as coregent before his own death as Thutmose I 's name appears next to Amenhotep 's on a divine barque found by archeologists in the fill of the third pylon at Karnak . However , most scholars consider that this is only evidence of Thutmose associating himself with his royal predecessor . One text has also been interpreted to mean that Amenhotep appointed his infant son as coregent , who then predeceased him . However , the scholarly consensus is that there is too little evidence for either coregency . 
 = = = Legacy : Funerary cult = = = 
 Amenhotep was deified upon his death and made the patron deity of the village which he opened at Deir el @-@ Medina . His mother , who lived at least one year longer than he did , was also deified upon her death and became part of his litany . As previously mentioned , the vast majority of Amenhotep 's statuary comes in the form of a funerary idol from this cult during later periods . When being worshiped , he had three <unk> manifestations : " Amenhotep of the Town , " " Amenhotep Beloved of Amun , " and " Amenhotep of the Forecourt , " and was known as a god who produced oracles . Some of the questions asked of him have been preserved on ostraca from Deir el @-@ Medina , and appear to have been phrased in such a way that the idol of the king could nod ( or be caused to nod ) the answer . He also had a number of feasts dedicated to him which were held throughout the year . During the first month , a festival was celebrated in honor of the appearance of Amenhotep to the necropolis workmen , which probably means his idol was taken to Deir el @-@ Medina . Another feast was held on the thirtieth of the fourth month , and then two more were held in the seventh month . The first was the " spreading of the funeral couch for king Amenhotep , " which probably commemorated the day of his death . The second , celebrated for four days at the very end of the month , was the " great festival of king Amenhotep lord of the town . " Later in Egyptian history , the seventh month was named after this festival , " <unk> . " Another festival was held on the 27th of the ninth month , and the last known festival was held for several days between at least the eleventh and thirteenth days of the eleventh month , which in all probability commemorated the date of Amenhotep 's accession to the throne . 
 Further light is shed upon Amenhotep 's funerary cult by multiple documents which appear to detail the rituals dedicated to Amenhotep . Three papyri from the time of Ramesses II record the liturgy used by the priests , and reliefs at Karnak and Medinet <unk> illustrate select rites and spells . The bulk of the rituals concern preparing for and conducting the daily offerings of libations for the idol , including a recitation of a <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> formula , and purifying and sealing the shrine at the end of the day . The remainder of the rites concern how to conduct various feasts throughout the year . In these cases , Amenhotep 's idol or a priest representing him is actually officiating the worship of Amun instead of being worshipped himself , which was not a typical cultic practice in ancient Egypt .

 = Great New York City Fire of 1845 = 
 The Great New York City Fire of 1845 broke out on July 19 , 1845 . The fire started in a whale @-@ oil and candle manufacturing establishment and quickly spread to other wooden structures in the neighborhood . It reached a warehouse on Broad Street where combustible saltpeter was stored and caused a massive explosion that spread the fire even farther . 
 Before it was subdued , the fire destroyed 345 buildings in the southern part of what is now the Financial District in New York City and caused $ 5 million to $ 10 million in damage , as well as killing 4 firefighters and 26 civilians . The 1845 fire was the last of three great fires that affected the heart of Manhattan , including fires in 1776 and 1835 . The 1845 fire was very destructive , but it affected mostly older wood @-@ frame construction in a confined section of the city . This proved the efficacy of the fire @-@ resistant building practices that had come into play in surrounding areas of the city in previous decades . 
 = = Fire = = 
 The fire started at about 2 : 30 a.m. on Saturday , July 19 , 1845 , on the third story of J. L. Van Doren , Oil Merchant and <unk> Candle Manufacturer , at 34 New Street in Manhattan , known as a seller of whale oil . The fire spread quickly to adjoining buildings . The City Hall alarm bell began to ring at about 3 a.m. , summoning firefighters . 
 Firefighters from the Fire Department of the City of New York ( FDNY ) , at that time a volunteer organization , arrived under the command of Chief Engineer Cornelius Anderson . As the fire grew , the FDNY personnel were joined by retired fire chiefs from the city and firefighting crews from Brooklyn , Newark , and Williamsburg . Firemen battling the blaze were aided by water flowing from the Croton aqueduct , which had been completed in 1842 . The fire either weakened in intensity or had been subdued by firefighters by 1 p.m. that day . 
 During the ten and a half hours that it burned , the fire had destroyed buildings from Broad Street below Wall Street to Stone Street , up Whitehall Street to Bowling Green , and up Broadway to Exchange Place . The fire killed 4 firefighters and 26 civilians . Buildings were reported destroyed on Broadway , New Street , Broad Street , Exchange Place , Beaver Street , <unk> Street , Whitehall Street , and South William Street . All told , the fire destroyed 345 buildings , doing property damage estimated at the time at between $ 5 million and $ 10 million . In today 's currency , damages would be between $ 127 million and $ 254 million . 
 There were multiple reports of looting during the fire and in its aftermath , both of businesses and private residences . At least two elderly women reported being approached by young men who offered to help them move their belongings from their damaged buildings , only to have their valuables stolen . 
 = = Warehouse explosion = = 
 In the first two hours of the fire 's spread , it reached a large multi @-@ story warehouse occupied by Crocker & Warren on Broad Street , where a large quantity of combustible saltpeter was stored . 
 When Engine Co . 22 arrived , it was ordered to pump water on the warehouse . The company 's firefighters entered the warehouse and dragged a hose up a staircase to direct water onto the fourth floor . When heavy black smoke began coming up the stairway , Foreman Garrett B. Lane ordered his firemen to evacuate . Fireman Francis Hart Jr . , trying to collect the hose , became trapped , fled to the roof , and escaped over neighboring rooftops . 
 At about 3 : 30 or 4 : 00 a.m. , about five minutes after Engine Co . 22 evacuated the building , it exploded . The explosion flattened six or eight buildings , blew in the fronts of the opposite houses on Broad Street and wrenched shutters and doors from buildings at some distance from the immediate area of the explosion . It propelled bricks and other missiles through the air , threw down many people who had gone as far as Beaver Street , and spread the fire far and wide so that the whole neighborhood was set ablaze . The explosion shattered windows a mile away and was heard as far away as Sandy Hook in New Jersey . 
 Engine Co . 22 's vehicle was blown across Broad Street ; the vehicle itself was eventually burned up . Several members of the company were injured . 
 Hart was thrown by the explosion across a rooftop , but only received a minor ankle injury . Augustus L. Cowdrey of Engine Co . 42 and Dave Van Winkle of Engine Co . 5 were throwing water on an adjacent building , when a second explosion occurred in the warehouse . The explosion threw Van Winkle into the street . Cowdrey was killed , his body never found . His company continued to search for his body amid the rubble for two days . His name appears along with many others on a memorial in Trinity Churchyard in New York for volunteer firefighters who died in the line of duty . 
 The cause of the explosion was debated in the days immediately following the fire . Public speculation led to the arrest of Crocker and Warren , the occupants of the warehouse . The Daily @-@ Tribune reported that the explosions could not have occurred without the presence of gunpowder in addition to the saltpeter , and thus they were suspected of possessing gunpowder , which would have led to a murder charge . However , later inquiry released Crocker and Warren of all charges as no evidence of gunpowder was discovered . 
 There was some speculation that the explosion had been caused by the NY Gas Light Co . ' s gasometer house , but Chief Engineer Cornelius Anderson released a statement the day of the fire stating that the explosion occurred before the flames ever reached the gas house . 
 = = Effect on New York City Fire Code and firefighting practices = = 
 The Great New York City Fire of 1845 was the last of three particularly devastating fires that affected the heart of Manhattan , the other two occurring in 1776 and 1835 . While very destructive , the 1845 fire confirmed the value of building codes restricting wood @-@ frame construction . In 1815 , city officials had banned new construction of wood @-@ frame structures in the densest areas of the city . The 1845 fire demonstrated the efficacy of these restrictions , as the progress of the fire was checked when it spread toward areas rebuilt after the 1835 fire with such materials as stone , masonry , and iron roofs and shutters . In spite of general improvements , the 1845 fire prompted public calls for a more proactive stance in fire prevention and firefighting . 
 To strengthen the city 's firefighting capabilities , the city established in 1845 a reserve unit called the <unk> Fireman 's Company , so called because it was made up of firemen who were exempt from militia and jury duty . The company was led by veteran fireman <unk> Mills , who had helped stop the great 1835 fire from crossing Wall Street . 
 = 27th Infantry Division Savska = 
 The 27th Infantry Division Savska was an infantry formation of the Royal Yugoslav Army that formed part of the Yugoslav 4th Army during the German @-@ led Axis invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in April 1941 . It was raised from the Savska military district , and was a very large and unwieldy formation which was almost entirely reliant on animal transport for mobility . Largely manned by Croat troops , many of whom saw the Germans as potential liberators from Serbian oppression during the interwar period , the division also lacked modern arms and sufficient ammunition . 
 Along with the rest of the Yugoslav Army , the 27th Infantry Division Savska began mobilising on 3 April 1941 , and was still engaged in that process three days later when the Germans began an air campaign and a series of preliminary operations against the Yugoslav frontiers . These attacks ignited rebellion within the Croat troops of the division . Even the chief of staff of the division became involved , countermanding orders for the sabotage of a bridge over the Drava river at Zákány . The division briefly established a defensive line on the Yugoslav side of the river , but German troops began crossing on 7 April , forcing the division to begin withdrawing . A planned counterattack delayed the Germans for a day , but the division began to disintegrate due to fifth column actions , rebellion and desertion . When the German 14th Panzer Division broke out of the bridgehead at Zákány on 10 April , the 27th Infantry Division Savska numbered only 2 @,@ 000 men , mostly Serbs . In a single day , the German panzers with overwhelming air support brushed aside the remnants of the division and captured Zagreb , covering nearly 160 kilometres ( 99 mi ) and meeting little resistance . On that day the divisional headquarters was captured , and the division effectively ceased to exist . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Royal Yugoslav Army ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : Vojska Kraljevine Jugoslavije , VKJ ) was formed after World War I as the army of the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( Kingdom of SCS ) , when that country was created on 1 December 1918 . To defend the new kingdom , an army was formed around the nucleus of the victorious Royal Serbian Army combined with armed formations raised in the former parts of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire that joined with the Kingdom of Serbia to form the new state . Many former Austro @-@ Hungarian officers and soldiers became members of the new army . From its beginning , the army , like other aspects of public life in the new kingdom , was dominated by ethnic Serbs , who saw the army as a means by which to secure Serb hegemony in the new kingdom . 
 The development of the army was hampered by the poor economy of the kingdom , and this continued through the 1920s . In 1929 , King Alexander changed the name of the country to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia , at which time the army became the VKJ . The army budget remained tight , and as tensions rose across Europe during the 1930s , it became hard to secure weapons and munitions from other countries . Consequently , at the time World War II broke out in September 1939 , the VKJ had several serious weaknesses , which included reliance on draught animals for transport , and the large size of its formations . For example , Yugoslav infantry divisions had twice the number of men of contemporary British infantry divisions . These characteristics resulted in slow , unwieldy formations , and the inadequate supply of arms and munitions meant that even the very large Yugoslav formations had low firepower . Older generals better suited to the trench warfare of World War I were combined with an army that was not equipped or trained to resist the fast @-@ moving combined arms approach used by the Germans in Poland and France . 
 The weaknesses of the VKJ in strategy , structure , equipment , mobility and supply were exacerbated to a significant degree by the lack of unity across Yugoslavia which had resulted from two decades of Serb hegemony , and the attendant lack of political legitimacy achieved by the central government . Attempts to address the lack of unity came too late to ensure that the VKJ was a cohesive force . Fifth column activity was also a serious concern , not only from the Croatian nationalist Ustaše , but from the Slovene and ethnic German minorities in the country .

 = = = Peacetime organisation = = = 
 According to regulations issued by the Royal Yugoslav Army in 1935 , the Savska divisional district was headquartered in Zagreb during peacetime , and was under the control of the 4th Army district also headquartered in Zagreb . The division was named for the Sava river , a tributary of the Danube that flows along the northern border of modern @-@ day Bosnia and Herzegovina . In peacetime , the Savska divisional district included : 
 35th Infantry Regiment , based in Zagreb 
 36th Infantry Regiment , based in Varaždin 
 53rd Infantry Regiment , based in Karlovac 
 14th Artillery Regiment , based in Varaždin

 The wartime organisation of the Royal Yugoslav Army was laid down by regulations issued in 1936 – 37 , and the strength of an infantry division was 26 @,@ 000 – 27 @,@ 000 men . A total of 11 @,@ 200 horses and other pack and draught animals were required to provide mobility for each infantry division . The theoretical wartime organisation of a fully mobilised Yugoslav infantry division was : 
 headquarters 
 divisional infantry headquarters , with three or four infantry regiments 
 divisional artillery headquarters , with one or two artillery regiments 
 a cavalry battalion with two squadrons , a bicycle squadron and a machine gun platoon 
 a pioneer battalion of three companies 
 an anti @-@ tank company , equipped with twelve 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) or 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) anti @-@ tank guns 
 a machine gun company 
 an anti @-@ aircraft machine gun company 
 a signals company 
 logistics units 
 Each infantry regiment was to consist of three infantry battalions , a machine gun company , and the divisional artillery regiments were animal @-@ drawn and largely equipped with World War I @-@ vintage pieces . An artillery regiment consisted of four battalions , one of 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) light howitzers , one of 65 mm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) or 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) mountain guns , and two of 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) or 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) field guns . The 36th Infantry Regiment and the 14th and 30th Artillery Regiments , which were administered by the Savska divisional district in peacetime , were earmarked to join other formations when they were mobilised , and the division was brought up to its wartime strength by the 104th Infantry Regiment and the 27th Artillery Regiment . 
 = = Planned deployment = = 
 The 27th Infantry Division Savska was a component of the 4th Army as part of the 1st Army Group , which was responsible for the defence of northwestern Yugoslavia . In the event of mobilisation , the 4th Army was to deploy in a cordon along the western sector of the Hungarian border , with the 27th Infantry Division Savska positioned opposite the Hungarian village of Gyékényes , between the confluence of the Mura at <unk> and Kloštar Podravski . In this disposition , the divisional headquarters was planned to be located at Kapela , north of Bjelovar . On the left flank of the division it was planned that the 42nd Infantry Division Murska would be positioned opposite the Hungarian city of Nagykanizsa , and on the right flank the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska was to establish itself opposite the Hungarian town of Barcs . Border guard units in the division 's area of responsibility would consist of the 3rd Battalion of the 393rd Reserve Regiment and 576th Independent Battalion .

 As the Axis invasion began , the 27th Infantry Division Savska had only commenced mobilisation , and was largely in its mobilisation centres or moving to concentration areas . On 4 April , the commander of the 4th Army , Armijski đeneral Petar Nedeljković had reported that the division could not move for another 24 hours due to lack of vehicles . Only a small proportion of the division was in its planned positions on 6 April : 
 the divisional commander Divizijski đeneral August Marić and his headquarters staff were mobilising in Zagreb 
 the 35th Infantry Regiment ( less its 3rd Battalion ) was marching from Zagreb to Križevci , with its 3rd Battalion still in Zagreb 
 the 53rd Infantry Regiment , with about 50 percent of its troops and 15 percent of its animals , was moving by rail from its mobilisation centre in Karlovac via Križevci to Koprivnica , with its 1st Battalion <unk> in Koprivnica 
 the 104th Infantry Regiment was marching from its mobilisation centre in Sesvete via Dugo Selo to Bjelovar 
 Two battalions of the 27th Artillery Regiment were in position in Novigrad Podravski and near Koprivnica , with the rest of the 27th Artillery Regiment still mobilising in Zagreb and Varaždin 
 the divisional cavalry battalion was mobilising in Čakovec but had no horses , and the divisional machine gun battalion was mobilising in Zagreb but also had no animal transport

 Early on 6 April 1941 , the German XLVI Motorised Corps launched preliminary attacks along the Drava between <unk> and <unk> in the area of the 27th Infantry Division Savska with the intention of securing crossings over the river , but they were unsuccessful . By the evening , German successes along the Hungarian border made it clear to the Germans that the Yugoslavs would not be resisting stubbornly at the frontier . The XLVI Motorised Corps was then ordered to begin seizing bridges over the Drava right along the 4th Army front , including at Zákány near Gyékényes . These local attacks were sufficient to inflame dissent within the largely Croat 4th Army , who refused to resist the Germans which they considered their liberators from Serbian oppression during the interwar period . 
 The continuing mobilisation and concentration of the division and the whole of the 4th Army was hampered by escalating fifth column activities and propaganda fomented by the Croatian nationalist Ustaše . Some units stopped mobilising , or began returning to their mobilisation centres from their concentration areas . During the day , Yugoslav sabotage units attempted to destroy the bridge over the Drava at Zákány . This attempt was only partially successful , due to the influence of Ustaše propaganda and the countermanding of the demolition orders by the chief of staff of the 27th Infantry Division Savska , Major Anton Marković . The Yugoslav radio network linking the division with the 4th Army and flanking divisions was sabotaged by the Ustaše on 6 April , and radio communications within the 4th Army remained poor throughout the fighting .

 About 05 : 00 on 7 April , two to three battalions of the XLVI Motorised Corps commenced crossing the Drava at Zákány , and attacked towards Koprivnica . In response to the German crossing , the 53rd Infantry Regiment withdrew towards Koprivnica and took up defensive positions in a series of villages including Torčec . In order to stop this German penetration and gain more time for the concentration of the division , elements of the 27th Artillery Regiment were sent to support the defensive line near Torčec , which was placed under the command of the division 's commanding officer for infantry . About 07 : 30 , the commander of the Yugoslav 1st Army Group , Armijski đeneral Milorad Petrović met with Nedeljković at Zagreb and ordered him to go to Koprivnica and prepare a counterattack against the bridgehead , to commence at 15 : 00 . The counterattack plan was unable to be carried out , as the necessary units could not reach their positions . 
 About 10 : 30 , the Germans reached the defensive line near Torčec , and fighting began . A few Breguet 19s of the 4th Air Reconnaissance Group attached to the 1st Army Group which had survived an early morning raid on their airfield the previous day , mounted attacks on the bridge over the Drava at Zákány . After the Germans reinforced their bridgehead with two more battalions , they overcame the Yugoslav defenders , who had suffered significant losses and were running low on artillery ammunition . About 18 : 00 , the 53rd Infantry Regiment withdrew to Koprivnica along with its artillery support , and remained in the town during the night . The bridge at Zákány was destroyed later that day by sabotage units . At 23 : 00 , following orders from Petrović that he was to attack on 8 April at all costs , Nedeljković issued orders for a counterattack to be carried out early on 8 April . 
 = = = 8 April = = = 
 On 8 April , the German XLVI Motorised Corps continued with its limited objective attacks to expand their bridgeheads on the 4th Army front , including at Zákány . The resistance offered by both flanking divisions was very limited . The 36th Infantry Regiment of the 42nd Infantry Division Murska , which had been concentrating in the Ludbreg district northwest of Koprivnica , was transferred to the 27th Infantry Division Savska , in an attempt to bolster the left flank of the divisional sector . 
 On the morning of 8 April , the 27th Infantry Division Savska was deployed around Koprivnica . The 104th Infantry Regiment supported by elements of the 27th Artillery Regiment was deployed northeast of the town behind the Drava between <unk> and <unk> . The 2nd Cavalry Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division , which had been riding from its mobilisation centre in Virovitica to Zagreb , was allocated to the 27th Infantry Division Savska to assist with establishing its forward defences , and was deployed with two artillery batteries between the outskirts of Koprivnica and Bregi . The 53rd Infantry Regiment , and the remnants of the 2nd Battalion of the 36th Infantry Regiment and the 1st Battalion of the 35th Infantry Regiment ( totalling around 500 men ) , and the 1st Battery of the 27th Artillery Regiment were located in the town itself . The 2nd Battalion of the 36th Infantry Regiment had not yet arrived in Koprivnica , and the divisional cavalry squadron had reached as far as Ivanec . The majority of the 81st Cavalry Regiment , which were army @-@ level troops , were on the road from Zagreb to Koprivnica , although its 1st Squadron , which had been transported to Koprivnica in cars on 7 April , was deployed as part of an outpost line forward of Koprivnica supporting the 1st Battalion of the 53rd Infantry Regiment . The divisional headquarters was located 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) southwest of Koprivnica at Reka . 
 In accordance with Nedeljković 's orders , Marić 's 27th Infantry Division Savska was to undertake a counterattack against the Zákány bridgehead on 8 April . Supported by two batteries of Skoda 75 mm Model 1928 mountain guns of the 27th Artillery Regiment , the attack consisted of three columns converging on the bridgehead . The right column , attacking from the area of Bregi , was to consist of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment supported by the divisional machine gun company . The centre column , consisting of the 53rd Infantry Regiment and the remnants of the 2nd Battalion of the 36th Infantry Regiment and the 1st Battalion of the 35th Infantry Regiment , directly supported by the 1st Battery of the 27th Artillery Regiment , would attack from Koprivnica . The left column , attacking from the vicinity of <unk> , was to consist of the dismounted 81st Cavalry Regiment . As promised support from the 36th Infantry Regiment , 81st Cavalry Regiment and army @-@ level artillery had not materialised , Marić postponed the counterattack to 16 : 00 . By noon , a full scale revolt had broken out within the flanking 40th Infantry Division Slavonska , resulting in the capture of the town of Bjelovar and a large portion of the 4th Army headquarters by the rebels that afternoon . When the attack on the bridgehead at Zákány was eventually launched , only the 2nd Cavalry Regiment and the 1st Squadron of the 81st Cavalry Regiment remained in contact with the Germans , south of <unk> , and the 2nd Cavalry Regiment held that area throughout the night of 8 / 9 April , despite heavy German artillery fire . Of the other units involved in the counterattack , most were only at 25 percent of their full strength due to Ustaše @-@ influenced desertions sparked by the rebellion within the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska . Two battalions of the 36th Infantry Regiment deserted during the day . 
 = = = 9 April = = = 
 On 9 April , the left flanking 42nd Infantry Division Murska withdrew from the Drava to conform with the line being held by forward elements of the 27th Infantry Division Savska , while the German XLVI Motorised Corps completed its preparations for full @-@ scale offensive action by expanding its bridgehead at Zákány . The cavalry units continued to fight the Germans around <unk> , but the left sector of the divisional front line began to disintegrate . The commander of the right sector , Pukovnik Mihailo Georgijević ordered his troops to hold their positions and went to divisional headquarters to ask approval to discharge the Croats in his units . Marić would not inform 4th Army headquarters of this idea , so Georgijević went to Zagreb to speak to Petrović , and to further urge him to withdraw all troops that still wanted to fight to a line south of the Sava . According to Georgijević , Petrović ordered him to tell Marić to consider disarming his Croat troops , and to continue to hold positions on the line of the Bilogora hills , but to conduct a fighting withdrawal towards Zagreb and Sisak if the German pressure was too great . The intent of these orders was not implemented , as fifth column elements changed the wording so that orders were issued to discharge Croat troops and to retreat towards Zagreb without fighting . 
 About 09 : 00 , Marić and Marković went to Zagreb to see Petrović , who ordered them to immediately return to their division and continue to resist the Germans . On the return journey , they encountered most of their division withdrawing towards Križevci , with the exception of the cavalry units still fighting north of Koprivnica . Marić halted the retreat , and established positions around Mali <unk> , making his headquarters at Križevci . Georgijević dismissed his Croat troops and retreated with the rest of his force towards Zagreb , and the commander of the 104th Infantry Regiment discharged all his troops . In the afternoon , the hard @-@ pressed cavalry units began to withdraw . About 14 : 00 , the 2nd Cavalry Regiment withdrew to Novigrad Podravski via Bregi , but receiving a hostile reception from the Croat population , continued towards Bjelovar . About 18 : 00 , the 1st Squadron of the 81st Cavalry Regiment withdrew via Koprivnica , reaching the rest of the division about 23 : 00 . About 19 : 00 , the Germans occupied Koprivnica without resistance . By evening , Marić 's division numbered about 2 @,@ 000 troops , the 36th Infantry Regiment and 81st Cavalry Regiment were widely dispersed , the 53rd Infantry Regiment had effectively ceased to exist , and his artillery regiment had only two horses to pull guns . 
 Prior to its disbandment , the rebels in Bjelovar had used the telegraph station and telephone exchange in the town to issue false orders to parts of the 104th Infantry Regiment directing them to withdraw from their positions . The rebels also contacted the Germans by telephone and sent representatives to meet the Germans at the Drava bridgeheads , to advise them that the roads had been cleared of obstacles , and the rebels invited them to enter Bjelovar . Rebels and deserters began to converge on Bjelovar , bringing with them many Serb officers and soldiers who soon filled the town 's jails . 
 Elements of the 4th Army began to withdraw southwards on 9 April . On the evening of 9 April , Generaloberst Maximilian von Weichs , commander of the German 2nd Army , was ready to launch major offensive operations from the bridgeheads on the following day . His plan involved two main thrusts . The first would be spearheaded by the 14th Panzer Division breaking out of the Zákány bridgehead and drive towards Zagreb , and the second would see the 8th Panzer Division break out of the bridgehead in the sector of the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska and turn east between the Drava and Sava to attack towards Belgrade . On the night of 9 / 10 April , those Croats that had remained with their units also began to desert or turn on their commanders , and in the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska on the right flank of the 27th Infantry Division Savska , almost all the remaining troops were Serbs . Due to the increasing momentum of the revolt , Petrović concluded that the 4th Army was no longer an effective formation and could not resist the Germans . 
 = = = Fate = = = 
 Early on 10 April , Pukovnik Franjo Nikolić , the head of the operations staff with the headquarters of the 1st Army Group , left his post and visited the senior Ustaše leader Slavko Kvaternik in Zagreb . He then returned to headquarters and redirected 4th Army units around Zagreb to either cease operations or to deploy to innocuous positions . These actions reduced or eliminated armed resistance to the German advance . On the same day , the 14th Panzer Division , supported by dive bombers , crossed the Drava and drove southwest towards Zagreb on snow @-@ covered roads in extremely cold conditions . Initial air reconnaissance indicated large concentrations of Yugoslav troops on the divisional axis of advance , but these troops proved to be withdrawing towards Zagreb . 
 <unk> by revolt and fifth @-@ column activity , the 27th Infantry Division Savska numbered about 2 @,@ 000 effectives when the German attack began . The 14th Panzer Division vanguard reached their positions in the Bilogora range around 08 : 00 , and the remnants of the division began withdrawing towards Križevci under heavy air attack . When they reached the town around 14 : 00 , they were quickly encircled by German motorised troops that had outflanked them . The divisional headquarters staff escaped , but were captured a little further down the road at <unk> . The remnants of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment had to fight its way towards Bjelovar , but was attacked by German tanks on the outskirts , captured and detained . The 14th Panzer Division continued its almost completely unopposed drive on Zagreb using two routes , Križevci – Dugo Selo – Zagreb and Bjelovar – Čazma – Ivanić @-@ Grad – Zagreb . 
 About 17 : 45 on 10 April , Kvaternik and SS @-@ Standartenführer Edmund Veesenmayer went to the radio station in Zagreb and Kvaternik proclaimed the creation of the Independent State of Croatia ( Croatian : Nezavisna Država Hrvatska , NDH ) . The 35th Infantry Regiment of the 27th Infantry Division Savska was disbanded by its commander when he heard news of the proclamation . By 19 : 30 on 10 April , lead elements of the 14th Panzer Division had reached the outskirts of Zagreb , having covered nearly 160 kilometres ( 99 miles ) in a single day . By the time it entered Zagreb , the 14th Panzer Division was met by cheering crowds , and had captured 15 @,@ 000 Yugoslav troops , including 22 generals . 
 About 19 : 45 , the 1st Army Group held a conference in Zagreb , just as German tanks were entering the city . Nedeljković told Petrović that he could no longer hold his positions , but despite this , Petrović ordered him to hold for at least 2 – 3 days to enable the withdrawal of the 7th Army to the Kupa river . Nedeljković replied that he no longer had an army , and suggested that all Serb officers and men be ordered back to form a defensive line along the Sava and Una rivers . Petrović refused to consider this , but ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to form a defensive line along the Sava between Jasenovac and Zagreb . The XLVI Motorised Corps encountered little resistance from the 4th Army , particularly from the 27th Infantry Division Savska and 40th Infantry Division Slavonska on its right , and by the evening of 10 April the whole 4th Army was disintegrating . Petrović wanted to dismiss Marić as commander of the 27th Infantry Division Savska due to suspicions that he was an Ustaše sympathiser , but could not identify a suitable replacement . 
 On 11 April , Petrović and the staff of 1st Army Group headquarters were captured by Ustaše at Petrinja , and the rear area staff of 4th Army headquarters were captured by Ustaše at Topusko . The personnel of both headquarters were soon handed over to the Germans by their captors . Nedeljković and his operations staff escaped to fight on for a few days , but the 27th Infantry Division Savska had ceased to exist . On 15 April , Nedeljković received orders that a ceasefire had been agreed , and that all 4th Army troops were to remain in place and not fire on German personnel . After a delay in locating appropriate signatories for the surrender document , the Yugoslav Supreme Command unconditionally surrendered in Belgrade effective at 12 : 00 on 18 April .
