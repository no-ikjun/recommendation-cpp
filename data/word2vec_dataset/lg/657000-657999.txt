 That fall , CBS Reports , a news / documentary program at 7 : 30 ( et ) on Wednesdays , was blamed in the press for the sharp drop off in the ratings of The Beverly Hillbillies – the comedy had been number one in its first two seasons , but dropped to eighteenth when CBS Reports became the Hillbillies lead @-@ in for its third season . ( Hillbillies had aired at nine o 'clock before moving up a half hour in 1964 . ) CBS responded by moving CBS Reports to Mondays . 
 = = = Dismissal = = = 
 In the spring of 1964 , charges were printed in the April 16 issue of Close @-@ Up , a celebrity tabloid , which claimed Aubrey was taking kickbacks from producers . The Federal Communications Commission made inquiries , and CBS learned that despite his $ 264 @,@ 000 annual salary from the company , Aubrey 's apartment on Manhattan 's Central Park South was owned by Martin Ransohoff , the head of Filmways , the producer of the Hillbillies , Petticoat Junction , Mister Ed , and other CBS programs . And though he had a chauffeur @-@ driven car paid for by the network , Brasselle 's Richelieu Productions was paying for another chauffeured car for Aubrey , done so Paley and Stanton would not know what Aubrey was doing after hours . CBS had not known of either the apartment or the car . The company was also concerned about the money spent to buy Gleason 's former home . 
 In late 1964 , Aubrey approached Stanton with a proposal . Claiming he had investors lined @-@ up and ready to buy the company , Aubrey said once in control , they would fire Paley , install Stanton as chairman , and promote Aubrey to Stanton 's post , CBS corporate president . This did not come to pass , but Aubrey 's contempt for Paley knew no bounds , Aubrey even showing his disregard for Paley in public . The Internal Revenue Service filing a tax lien against Aubrey for $ 38 @,@ 047 @.@ 93 was another irritant for Paley . Aubrey also seemed to have lost his touch , the early ratings for the 1964 – 65 season showing the new shows that fall were flops . Aubrey panicked , noted Life , and " by that time Paley had made his decision to fire Aubrey , though he had yet found no plausible excuse . " 
 " Aubrey was torpedoed at last , " wrote The New York Times Magazine , " by a combination of his imperiousness , the ratings drop , and a vivid <unk> life culminating in a raucous Miami Beach party – details of which no one ever agrees on – the weekend he was fired . " ( Aubrey had been in Florida for Jackie Gleason 's forty @-@ ninth birthday party . ) 
 " I don 't pretend to be any saint . If anyone wants to indict me for liking pretty girls , I 'm guilty , " Aubrey said at the time , one factor in his divorce in 1962 , which freed him to , " live the high life around New York , Hollywood , Miami , and in Europe with such companions as Judy Garland , Julie Newmar , Rhonda Fleming – and with other dolls who were only faces and figures , not names . His late dates and early morning parties were the talk of several towns . " 
 Paley ordered Stanton to fire Aubrey , and he did so on February 27 , 1965 , though the announcement was delayed until the following afternoon , a Sunday . Stanton 's statement declared : 
 Jim Aubrey 's outstanding accomplishment during his tenure as head of the <unk> television network need no elaboration . His extraordinary record speaks for itself . 
 In 1986 , Paul Rosenfield of the Los Angeles Times wrote : 
 There are at least 13 @,@ 000 theories on why he got the ax , some of them lurid , but none as obvious as the fact that CBS was starting to slip in the Nielsens . " And there was a basic dissatisfaction with me , " as he put it . If Aubrey understood ratings and revenue , he also was no stranger to a kind of after @-@ hours recklessness that mirrored the Camelot of its day . Nobody questions that Jungle Jim had a good time in the playgrounds of Manhattan and Hollywood . 
 Rosenfield also claimed " for years gossip columnists had to bite their tongues because the fodder on Aubrey was so tempting , but mostly unprintable . How much was hearsay and how much was fiction is not clear . " Aubrey 's successor was announced as John A. Schneider , the general manager of WCBS @-@ TV in New York City , who had no experience in network television . Aubrey was so despondent at losing his job Stanton feared he would kill himself . Wall Street took the news badly as well : CBS stock plunged nine points over the following week . The stock tumble " puts my net value to the network at $ 20 million , " Aubrey noted . Aubrey continued to be a CBS employee until April 20 . 
 Jack Gould , television critic for The New York Times , wrote two days after Aubrey 's dismissal that Aubrey 
 symbolized an era in television that has been and is too much rooted in calculated and insensitive preoccupation with making more money this year than last ... Automated situation comedies that wooed the young and did not drive away the old were the mainstay of his philosophy and they paid off . 
 = = The interregnum = = 
 Aubrey , who left CBS with $ 2 @.@ 5 million in network stock , moved to the Sunset Strip and set up a production company , The Aubrey Company . His attorney , Gregson E. Bautzer , in 1967 tried to buy the American Broadcasting Company for another client , the Las Vegas @-@ based millionaire Howard Hughes . Aubrey was to have run ABC after the takeover , but the reclusive Hughes refused to testify in person at hearings before the Federal Communications Commission , which had to approve the purchase , and the deal collapsed . 
 Aubrey 's outsize reputation – beaming smile , dapper dress , endless womanizing – and his dramatic exit from CBS inspired characters in three novels . His former friend Keefe Brasselle wrote The <unk> : A Novel About Television 's Savage Chieftains ( 1968 ) , the title of which had very unsubtle capitalization and was , in Nora Ephron 's assessment , " unreadable . " Harold Robbins 's The Inheritors ( 1969 ) and Jacqueline Susann 's The Love Machine ( 1969 ) also contained characters based on him . In Susann 's book , Aubrey is network executive Robin Stone . Paul Rosenfield said Aubrey had " quietly cooperated " with Susann , " giving her background on TV , " although Susann 's husband , Irving Mansfield , had been a busy TV producer himself , before switching to managing his wife 's career full @-@ time . Susann said Aubrey , her neighbor , was " one of those people who are born to run the works . A natural for a novel . " 
 In June 1967 , Aubrey agreed to a two @-@ year contract to produce films for Columbia Pictures . Despite being frequently rumored as a candidate for many posts in the entertainment industry , Aubrey told Vincent Canby of The New York Times he had " no desire ever again to become involved in the corporate side of the entertainment business " and had been , in Canby 's words , " dabbling in a number of enterprises , including the acquisition of films for TV , real estate , and cultured pearls . " In 1965 , Oulahan and Lambert had noted he had " extensive investments in everything from copper mines to a chain of waffle shops . " His first project for Columbia was to be an adaptation of a Patricia Highsmith book , Those Who Walk Away . " The criteria is profitable entertainment , " he told Canby . Before the deal collapsed on January 1 , 1968 , Aubrey had been rumored to be the leading candidate to be hired as ABC television entertainment chief if International Telephone and Telegraph 's takeover of ABC , which was announced in March 1966 , had been completed .

 Aubrey resurfaced in 1969 when Las Vegas businessman Kirk Kerkorian took control of the Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer studio for the first time , ousting Canadian liquor magnate Edgar M. Bronfman , who had gained control earlier that year . Aubrey 's attorney Gregson E. Bautzer also represented Kerkorian , and Bautzer recommended Aubrey for the MGM post . Aubrey , announced as MGM president on October 21 , 1969 , was Kerkorian 's third choice after Herb Jaffe of United Artists and independent producer Mike <unk> both declined the post , while producer Ray Stark was also considered . Aubrey replaced the fired Louis F. Polk , Jr . , who had been MGM president only since January 14 , 1969 . Aubrey was the studio 's third president that year . Polk told The New York Times , " no one likes to leave a job unfinished , " and said he had started much @-@ needed reforms at the studio , which suffered a $ 35 million loss in the fiscal year ending August 31 , 1969 . 
 Aubrey received a salary of $ 4 @,@ 000 a week , but had no contract . He said in 1986 , " I wanted Kirk to be able to say , ' Get lost , Jim , ' without obligation if it didn 't work . " Like most of the big studios in the 1960s , MGM was struggling and Kerkorian said his new president would bring the company roaring back to its former glory . Instead , Aubrey largely liquidated the company as Kerkorian transformed it into a hospitality company with the MGM Grand Hotel he was building . " We 've been using old @-@ fashioned methods here , " Aubrey said at the time . In 1986 , he said the company was " total disarray . Until you were in a position to lift up the rug , there was no way to know how much disarray . The crown jewel of studios had become a shambles . " 
 Within days of his hiring , twelve films were canceled because of financial issues , among them director Fred Zinnemann 's Man 's Fate , days from starting principal photography .

 Aubrey eliminated hundreds of jobs when he relocated corporate headquarters from New York City to Culver City to be closer to production facilities , a move which was announced on April 29 , 1970 . Aubrey ordered the sale of MGM 's historic collection of costumes and props such as the Ruby Slippers worn by Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz and the suit Spencer Tracy wore in Inherit the Wind . ( It was bought by one of the defense attorneys defending Charles Manson , who regularly wore it to court . ) The studio 's camera department was auctioned . Most of the studio 's Culver City backlot and its 2 @,@ 000 acre ( 8 km ² ) ranch in the Conejo Valley were sold to developers , moves already planned under Polk . Aubrey literally threw the company 's valuable archives into the trash and brought production to a standstill . Composer and conductor André Previn , in his memoir , No Minor Chords . My Days in Hollywood , describes how Aubrey had MGM 's collection of film music manuscripts discarded into the trash . [ citation needed ] Aubrey was criticized for these actions . In 1986 , he recalled , " the buck had to stop somewhere , and it was with me . Nostalgia runs strong out here , so we were criticized for selling Judy Garland 's red shoes . To us they had no value , and they had no intrinsic value . " 
 These moves were effective in restoring the company 's finances . In his first nine months on the job , he cut MGM 's debt by $ 27 million , nearly one @-@ quarter the total , and the company posted profits of $ 540 @,@ 000 for those nine months compared to a $ 18 @,@ 372 @,@ 000 loss in the comparable period in the preceding fiscal year . 
 = = = Changing tastes = = = 
 Losses were so great because Polk wrote off as total losses many films made under his predecessors ; the company posted a $ 35 @,@ 366 @,@ 000 loss in the fiscal year ending August 31 , 1969 . " Basically what we 're really concentrating on at the moment is to really streamline this operation . There isn 't much else to do when you 're losing as much money as we are , " Aubrey told The New York Times in December 1969 . Aubrey said , " we have determined that we 're not going to continue to produce on the basis of forty acres and acres and acres of standing sets . Young people who are the major movie audience today , refer to that as the plastic world and that is almost a deterrent in the business today . " 
 Aubrey announced plans for faster and cheaper movies , none of which would have a budget above $ 1 million , but many of these inexpensive films bombed with critics and audiences . One notable success was the Richard Roundtree film Shaft , which cost $ 1 million and grossed around $ 12 million at the box office . Agent Sue <unk> said he was a very tough <unk> . " I 'd rather go to bed with him than negotiate with him . " Upon assuming his MGM post , Aubrey almost immediately canceled production on two Julie Andrews pictures , She Loves Me and Say It With Music , the late 1960s fad for musicals having ended . He also clashed with David Lean , whose production of Ryan 's Daughter was running overbudget , in early 1970 , attempting to cancel or at least scale down the film ; but Lean held too much sway for Aubrey 's actions to have any effect . 
 = = = Return to profitability = = = 
 In the first half of fiscal 1970 , the company had profits of $ 6 @,@ 531 @,@ 000 despite sizable write @-@ offs . The company had significantly cut its operating losses from $ 6 @,@ 547 @,@ 000 to $ 1 @,@ 594 @,@ 000 . Aubrey told the press in April 1970 the company would have made money if not for four films : Herbert Ross 's musical version of James Hilton 's novel Goodbye , Mr. Chips starring Peter O 'Toole and Petula Clark ; Michelangelo Antonioni 's Zabriskie Point , a film Pauline Kael called " a huge , jerry @-@ built crumbling ruin of a movie " ; the adventure Captain Nemo and the Underwater City with Robert Ryan and Chuck Connors ; and Sidney Lumet 's The Appointment with Omar Sharif , Anouk Aimée , and Lotte Lenya . These four pictures cost almost $ 20 million to produce and had they broken even the company would have been profitable . In The New York Times , Vincent Canby noted that same month " the fickle tastes of the movie @-@ going audience have made a large part of [ studios ' film ] inventory obsolete . " 
 By the end of the fiscal year , the company had made $ 1 @,@ 573 @,@ 000 in profits ; a remarkable turnaround for a company which posted a $ 35 million loss one year before . In January 1971 , Aubrey declared , " we are pleased that the company has been turned around . Through the policies of this management , including a complete reorganization , substantial economies , consolidation of operations and through better performance of recent films , we have been able to operate substantially in the black . " 
 That same month , Aubrey announced the company was in merger talks with Twentieth Century Fox , days after Fox fired its top executives , Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown . Two weeks later he announced the talks had ended . However , Darryl F. Zanuck , chairman and CEO of Fox , publicly denied any negotiations . " There have not been and are not now and are not scheduled for the future any discussions concerning a merger or any other type of combination between our two companies , " he told the press . 
 = = = Hands @-@ on = = = 
 Aubrey again took a hands @-@ on approach to MGM 's products , personally ordering cuts on films . The New York Times Magazine wrote , " Aubrey 's heavy involvement with every creative detail of MGM 's pictures far surpassed his <unk> in CBS 's scripts . " After he made edits to the film Going Home starring Robert Mitchum , its director , Herbert B. Leonard , protested publicly . " He unilaterally and arbitrarily raped the picture , " he told Time in 1971 . Director Blake Edwards was incensed by changes Aubrey made to his film The Wild Rovers with William Holden , telling The New York Times Magazine , " Cuts ? He doesn 't know as much as a first @-@ year cinema student . He cut the heart right out of it . " Television producer Bruce Geller , who created Mission : Impossible , had his name removed from the credits of his first film , Corky , because " It 's not my picture any more . " The producer of the film Chandler , Michael S. Laughlin , and its director , Paul <unk> , took out a full page ad , bordered in black , in the trade papers declaring : 
 Regarding what was our film Chandler , let 's give credit where credit is due . We sadly acknowledge that all editing , post @-@ production as well as additional scenes were executed by James T. Aubrey Jr . We are sorry . 
 Laughlin told Time Magazine , " You just can 't deal with Aubrey . He realizes that litigation can be a great expense , and that because of legal delays the film will have disappeared long before your case comes to court . " 
 Aubrey engaged in another infamous feud with Sam Peckinpah , who in 1973 began work on the Western Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid . Aubrey clashed with Peckinpah immediately , the two men 's notoriously difficult personalities leading to a long @-@ lasting feud . Aubrey slashed Peckinpah 's budget early in production , refusing to allow him to reshoot crucial footage , pushing back the release date to Memorial Day , and editing out nearly 20 minutes of the film . Editor Roger Spottiswoode said that " Aubrey was ordering scenes cut out for no other reason except he knew Sam didn 't want them cut . " 
 MGM had disagreements with the Motion Picture Association of America and its rating system for films , which had been instituted in 1968 . MGM resigned from the MPAA in 1971 over the issue of ratings and " exorbitant dues charges , " Aubrey said . In October 1971 , MGM announced that it was to build the world 's largest hotel in Las Vegas , what would become the MGM Grand Hotel , and was to enter the cruise @-@ ship business . The next month , the company announced fiscal 1971 profits of $ 16 @,@ 358 @,@ 000 , up sharply from the $ 1 @.@ 6 million in fiscal 1970 and the highest in a quarter century . 
 After four years at MGM , Aubrey announced his resignation , declaring , " The job I agreed to undertake has been accomplished . " Kerkorian was named as his successor on October 31 , 1973 . Time Magazine declared , " Under Aubrey , MGM churned out profitable , medium @-@ budget schlock like <unk> and Black Belly of the Tarantula ; directors often charged him with philistine meddling , and he alienated many of them " but " as a financial auteur , Aubrey may have deserved an Oscar . " 
 Aubrey and Sherry Lansing , who entered the movie business as a script reader at MGM under Aubrey , were struck by a car while crossing Wilshire Boulevard in the mid @-@ 1970s . Both were badly hurt and Lansing had to use crutches for a year and a half . Aubrey nursed her back to health . " He came every day . He would say , ' You 're not going to limp . ' My own mother and father couldn 't give me more support , " she told Variety in 2004 . 
 = = Final years = = 
 Aubrey became an independent producer after leaving MGM , producing ten films , none memorable . His greatest success was a 1979 television movie about the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders starring Jane Seymour – " broads , bosoms , and fun " once more . In the mid @-@ 1980s , he was chairman of <unk> , a production company which made low @-@ budget films and was backed by several wealthy Texans – including former Governor John Connally . " Our theory is that with today 's ancillary rights , there is real profit in a movie that costs $ 3 million . We don 't need to gross $ 40 million , or open on Christmas Day , " he said . To publicize this venture , he granted a rare interview to the Los Angeles Times in 1986 . Reporter Paul Rosenfield found him unrepentant : 
 Aubrey doesn 't deny that he shoots from the hip , in a style that can unhinge the fragile egos of show business . " If I was in the tire business , " reasoned Aubrey , " I wouldn 't be hurt if the customer didn 't buy my tires . I 'd think , ' So what ? ' But in my business , if I don 't buy the script , then the writer kicks the dog and beats his wife . So you learn to pay attention to personal relationships . But that doesn 't mean you lie to people . I 've been the <unk> and the <unk> , and I know which is better . It 's better to be the <unk> , and it 's very difficult to do that with honesty , but it 's how I prefer to be treated . I don 't want power now , or authority , so I suppose my candor can 't hurt me . 
 Gossip columnist Liz Smith reported this profile of Aubrey had led to rumors he would again return to head CBS after Paley was forced out in 1986 when Laurence Tisch acquired the network . Aubrey worked as a consultant for Brandon Tartikoff during the 1980s , while Tartikoff worked to restore the reputation of NBC , but by the time of Aubrey 's death he had been largely forgotten .

 Jason Fox for NME felt that " Stop Crying Your Heart Out " was Oasis 's return to the " long lost humanism " of their 1996 single " Don 't Look Back in Anger " , because of Noel Gallagher 's ability to lighten the mood of his audience when they are in need .

 " Stop Crying Your Heart Out " is a cover song recorded by British singer @-@ songwriter Leona Lewis for her second studio album Echo ( 2009 ) . Originally written by Noel Gallagher of rock band Oasis , the song was produced by Lewis and Steve Robson . Lewis decided to cover the track as she is a fan of Oasis and rock bands in general , and she really liked the song 's sentiment . The strings were performed by London Session Orchestra , who were organised and arranged by Will Malone . The musical structure of the song is different from the conventional style which is normally used , as the song 's melody does not gain momentum until the end of the song instead of by the first chorus . 
 Her version of " Stop Crying Your Heart Out " garnered mostly negative reviews from music critics . Aside from comparisons to her previous singles " Bleeding Love " and her cover of Snow Patrol 's " Run " , reviewers felt as though she was too emotive and did not reflect the simplicity of the original . Although the arrangement of the song was criticised , Lewis 's vocal performance was highly praised . The song peaked at number 29 on the UK Singles Chart , number 11 on the UK R & B Chart and number 31 on the Irish Singles Chart . Lewis has performed the song live on the BBC Radio 2 show Live Sessions with Ken Bruce , MTV Unplugged and on the sixth series finale of The X Factor .

 In an interview with Rick Edwards titled Under the Skin of Leona Lewis on 28 February 2010 for 4Music , Lewis revealed that she is a fan of Oasis and that " Stop Crying Your Heart Out " is a " great song " with a " beautiful sentiment behind it " . She continued to say herself and label boss Simon Cowell discussed the possibility of Lewis recording a discussed cover version . Lewis cited her reason for wishing to record her own version as being a " massive " fan of rock bands , and that she wanted to put a " different spin on it " . When asked the question of if she knew what Gallagher thought about her version , she replied saying that she had not spoken to them and that she did not know if they had listened to her version . Originally written solely by Gallagher , Lewis 's cover version was produced by Steve Robson . Both Robson and Lewis were the vocal producers on " Stop Crying Your Heart Out " . It was engineered by Richard Flack , who was assisted in the process by vocal engineer Seth Waldmann . It was mixed by Jeremy <unk> at Twenty @-@ One Studios , located in London , England . A range of instrumentalists were bought in for the song ; Karl Brazil played the drums , while Luke Potashnick provided guitar . John Garrison played the bass and Robson the piano . The London Session Orchestra performed the strings on " Stop Crying Your Heart Out " and it was arranged by Will Malone , while the choir was organised and arranged by Lawrence Johnson . Background vocals were performed by Sara @-@ Jane Skeet and Beverly Skeet .

 " Stop Crying Your Heart Out " appears as the tenth track on Echo and lasts for a duration of four minutes and eight seconds . However , it is not included on the North American version of the album . The structure of the song is not conventional in its style , as most songs have gained momentum by the first chorus . However , Lewis 's version of " Stop Crying Your Heart Out " remains down @-@ tempo for the majority of the song . Andy Gill for The Independent noted that it does not possess the " rapidly acquiring melodramatic heft and momentum by the first refrain " . 
 Lewis 's version of " Stop Crying Your Heart Out " garnered mostly negative reviews from music critics . Nick Levine for Digital Spy complimented her version , writing that it is " as satisfying as a sponge pudding on a chilly winter evening " . Michael Cragg for musicOMH wrote that " Stop Crying Your Heart Out " is another song to be given the " Leona treatment " , and compared it to her cover of Snow Patrol 's " Run " , which she recorded for her inclusion on her debut studio album , Spirit . He felt that her cover of Oasis 's song appeared to serve as a " replacement " for covering Snow Patrol . He continued to criticise the production and vocal performance of Lewis 's version , writing " On this occasion the kitchen @-@ sink style production – stirring strings , acoustic strums , and inevitable appearance of a choir – feels hollow , like being aurally attacked by a ( admittedly very impressive ) karaoke singer " . As part of his review of Echo , Matthew Cole for Slant Magazine wrote that too much of the album is dominated by " thoughtless " ballads , which he highlighted in the form of " Don 't Let Me Down " and " Stop Crying Your Heart Out " . While he noted that Lewis gives a " technically unimpeachable " vocal performance , he wrote that it does not compensate for the " dull arrangement " and lack of emotion in her delivery . Andy Gill for The Independent described her cover as " sententious " . Neil McCormick for The Telegraph was critical of her decision to cover the song , writing that she is too emotive for the " direct and simple " lyrics , and concluded by saying that her version does not compare to Gallagher 's " raw @-@ <unk> sincerity " .

 = Metformin = 
 Metformin , marketed under the tradename Glucophage among others , is the first @-@ line medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes . This is particularly true in people who are overweight . It is also used in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome . Limited evidence suggests metformin may prevent the cardiovascular disease and cancer complications of diabetes . It is not associated with weight gain . It is taken by mouth . 
 Metformin is generally well tolerated . Common side effects include diarrhea , nausea , and abdominal pain . It has a low risk of developing low blood sugar . High blood lactic acid levels is a concern if prescribed inappropriately and in overdose . It should not be used in those with liver disease or kidney problems . While there is no clear harm if used during pregnancy , insulin is generally preferred for gestational diabetes . Metformin is in the biguanide class . It works by decreasing glucose production by the liver and increasing the insulin sensitivity of body tissues . 
 Metformin was discovered in 1922 . Study in humans began in 1950s by French physician Jean Sterne . It was introduced as a medication in France in 1957 and the United States in 1995 . It is on the World Health Organization 's List of Essential Medicines , the most important medications needed in a basic healthcare system . Metformin is believed to be the most widely used medication for diabetes which is taken by mouth . It is available as a generic medication . The wholesale price in the developed world is between 0 @.@ 21 and 5 @.@ 55 USD per month as of 2014 . In the United States , it costs 5 to 25 USD per month . 
 = = Medical uses = = 
 Metformin is primarily used for type 2 diabetes , but is increasingly being used in polycystic ovary syndrome . 
 = = = Type 2 diabetes = = = 
 The American Diabetes Association recommends metformin as a first @-@ line agent to treat type 2 diabetes . 
 = = = = Efficacy = = = = 
 The UK Prospective Diabetes Study , a large clinical trial performed in 1980 @-@ 90s , provided evidence that metformin reduced the rate of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes relative to other <unk> agents . However , accumulated evidence from other and more recent trials has reduced confidence in the efficacy of metformin for cardiovascular disease prevention . Treatment guidelines for major professional associations including the European Association for the Study of Diabetes , the European Society for Cardiology , and the American Diabetes Association , now describe evidence for the cardiovascular benefits of metformin as equivocal . According to the American College of Physicians in 2012 , low @-@ quality evidence indicates metformin monotherapy is associated with lower cardiovascular mortality than sulfonylurea monotherapy and metformin monotherapy is associated with fewer cardiovascular events than metformin @-@ sulfonylurea combination therapy . Evidence for other comparisons is described as unclear . A 2014 review found tentative evidence that people treated with sulfonylureas have fewer non @-@ fatal cardiovascular events than those treated with metformin ( RR 0 @.@ 67 ) but a higher risk of severe low blood sugar events ( RR 5 @.@ 64 ) . There was not enough data available to determine the relative risk of death or of death from heart disease . 
 Metformin has little or no effect on body weight compared with placebo in type 2 diabetes , although it causes weight loss compared with sulfonylureas , since sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain . There is some limited evidence that metformin may be associated with weight loss in obesity in the absence of diabetes . Metformin has a lower risk of hypoglycemia than the sulfonylureas , although hypoglycemia has uncommonly occurred during intense exercise , calorie deficit , or when used with other agents to lower blood glucose . Metformin modestly reduces LDL and triglyceride levels . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Metformin treatment of people at risk for type 2 diabetes may decrease their chances of developing the disease , although intensive physical exercise and dieting work significantly better for this purpose . In a large U.S. study known as the Diabetes Prevention Program , participants were divided into groups and given either placebo , metformin , or lifestyle intervention , and followed for an average of three years . The intensive program of lifestyle modifications included a 16 @-@ lesson training on dieting and exercise followed by monthly individualized sessions with the goals to decrease the body weight by 7 % and engage in a physical activity for at least 150 minutes per week . The incidence of diabetes was 58 % lower in the lifestyle group and 31 % lower in individuals given metformin . Among younger people with a higher body mass index , lifestyle modification was no more effective than metformin , and for older individuals with a lower body mass index , metformin was no better than placebo in preventing diabetes . After ten years , the incidence of diabetes was 34 % lower in the group of participants given diet and exercise and 18 % lower in those given metformin . It is unclear whether metformin slowed down the progression of <unk> to diabetes ( true preventive effect ) , or the decrease of diabetes in the treated population was simply due to its glucose @-@ lowering action ( treatment effect ) . 
 = = = Polycystic ovary syndrome = = = 
 <unk> therapy has been proposed as a treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) , a condition frequently associated with insulin resistance , since the late 1980s . The use of metformin in PCOS was first reported in 1994 , in a small study conducted at the University of the Andes , Venezuela . The United Kingdom 's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in 2004 that women with PCOS and a body mass index above 25 be given metformin for anovulation and infertility when other therapies have failed to produce results . However , two clinical studies completed in 2006 – 2007 returned mostly negative results , with metformin being no better than placebo , and a metformin @-@ clomifene combination no better than clomifene alone . Reflecting this , subsequent reviews noted large randomized controlled trials have , in general , not shown the promise suggested by the early small studies . UK and international clinical practice guidelines do not recommend metformin as a first @-@ line treatment or do not recommend it at all , except for women with glucose intolerance . The guidelines suggest <unk> as the first medication option and emphasize lifestyle modification independently from the drug treatment . 
 In a dissenting opinion , a systematic review of four head @-@ to @-@ head comparative trials of metformin and clomifene found them equally effective for infertility . Four positive studies of metformin were in women not responding to clomifene , while the population in the negative studies was drug @-@ naive or uncontrolled for the previous treatment . Metformin should be used as a second @-@ line drug if clomifene treatment fails . Another review recommended metformin unreservedly as a first @-@ line treatment option because it has positive effects not only on anovulation , but also on insulin resistance , <unk> , and obesity often associated with PCOS . A Cochrane Collaboration review found metformin improves ovulation and pregnancy rates , particularly when combined with clomifene , but is not associated with any increase in the number of live births . 
 = = = <unk> diabetes = = = 
 Several observational studies and randomized , controlled trials have found metformin to be as effective and safe as insulin for the management of gestational diabetes . Nonetheless , several concerns have been raised regarding studies published thus far , and evidence on the long @-@ term safety of metformin for both mother and child is still lacking . 
 Metformin is safe in pregnancy and women with gestational diabetes treated with metformin have less weight gain during pregnancy than those treated with insulin . Babies born to women treated with metformin have been found to develop less visceral fat , making them less prone to insulin resistance in later life . 
 = = Contraindications = = 
 Metformin is contraindicated in people with any condition that could increase the risk of lactic acidosis , including kidney disorders ( arbitrarily defined as creatinine levels over 150 μmol / l ( 1 @.@ 7 mg / dl ) , ) , lung disease and liver disease . According to the prescribing information , heart failure ( in particular , unstable or acute congestive heart failure ) increases the risk of lactic acidosis with metformin . A 2007 systematic review of controlled trials , however , suggested metformin is the only antidiabetic drug not associated with any measurable harm in people with heart failure , and it may reduce mortality in comparison with other antidiabetic agents . 
 Metformin is recommended to be temporarily discontinued before any radiographic study involving <unk> contrast agents , ( such as a contrast @-@ enhanced CT scan or angiogram ) , as the contrast dye may temporarily impair kidney function , indirectly leading to lactic acidosis by causing retention of metformin in the body . Metformin can be resumed after two days , assuming kidney function is normal . 
 = = Adverse effects = = 
 The most common adverse effect of metformin is gastrointestinal irritation , including diarrhea , cramps , nausea , vomiting , and increased flatulence ; metformin is more commonly associated with gastrointestinal side effects than most other antidiabetic drugs . The most serious potential side effect of metformin use is lactic acidosis ; this complication is very rare , and the vast majority of these cases seem to be related to comorbid conditions , such as impaired liver or kidney function , rather than to the metformin itself . 
 Metformin has also been reported to decrease the blood levels of thyroid @-@ stimulating hormone in people with hypothyroidism , The clinical significance of this is still unknown . 
 = = = Gastrointestinal = = = 
 In a clinical trial of 286 subjects , 53 @.@ 2 % of the 141 given immediate @-@ release metformin ( as opposed to placebo ) reported diarrhea , versus 11 @.@ 7 % for placebo , and 25 @.@ 5 % reported nausea / vomiting , versus 8 @.@ 3 % for those on placebo . 
 Gastrointestinal upset can cause severe discomfort ; it is most common when metformin is first administered , or when the dose is increased . The discomfort can often be avoided by beginning at a low dose ( 1 @.@ 0 to 1 @.@ 7 grams per day ) and increasing the dose gradually . 
 Long @-@ term use of metformin has been associated with increased homocysteine levels and malabsorption of vitamin B12 . Higher doses and prolonged use are associated with increased incidence of vitamin B12 deficiency , and some researchers recommend screening or prevention strategies . 
 = = = Lactic acidosis = = = 
 The most serious potential adverse effect of biguanide use is lactic acidosis ( " metformin @-@ associated lactic acidosis " or <unk> ) . Though the incidence for <unk> has been measured at about nine per 100 @,@ 000 person @-@ years , this is not different from the background incidence of lactic acidosis in the general population . A systematic review concluded no data exists to definitively link metformin to lactic acidosis . Lactic acidosis can be fatal in some cases . 
 <unk> , another biguanide , was withdrawn from the market because of an increased risk of lactic acidosis ( rate of 40 @-@ 64 per 100 @,@ 000 patient @-@ years ) . However , metformin is safer than phenformin , and the risk of developing lactic acidosis is not increased by the medication as long as it is not prescribed to known high @-@ risk groups . 
 Lactate uptake by the liver is diminished with metformin administration because lactate is a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis , a process which metformin inhibits . In healthy individuals , this slight excess is simply cleared by other mechanisms ( including uptake by the kidneys , when their function is unimpaired ) , and no significant elevation in blood levels of lactate occurs . When impaired kidney function is present , however , clearance of metformin and lactate is reduced , leading to increased levels of both , and possibly causing a buildup of lactic acid . Because metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate , any condition that may precipitate lactic acidosis is a contraindication to its use . Common causes of increased lactic acid production include alcoholism ( due to depletion of NAD + stores ) , heart failure , and respiratory disease ( due to inadequate oxygenation of tissues ) ; the most common cause of impaired lactic acid excretion is kidney disease . 
 Metformin has also been suggested to increase production of lactate in the large intestine ; this could potentially contribute to lactic acidosis in those with risk factors . However , the clinical significance of this is unknown , and the risk of metformin @-@ associated lactic acidosis is most commonly attributed to decreased hepatic uptake rather than increased intestinal production . 
 = = = Overdose = = = 
 A review of intentional and accidental metformin overdoses reported to poison control centers over a five @-@ year period found serious adverse events were rare , though the elderly appeared to be at greater risk . A similar study where cases were reported to Texas poison control centers between 2000 and 2006 found ingested doses of more than 5 @,@ 000 mg were more likely to involve serious medical outcomes in adults . Survival following intentional overdoses with up to 63 @,@ 000 mg ( 63 g ) of metformin have been reported in the medical literature . Fatalities following overdose are rare , but do occur . In healthy children , unintentional doses of less than 1 @,@ 700 mg are unlikely to cause any significant toxic effects . 
 The most common symptoms following overdose appear to include vomiting , diarrhea , abdominal pain , tachycardia , drowsiness , and , rarely , hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia . The major potentially life @-@ threatening complication of metformin overdose is lactic acidosis , which is due to lactate accumulation . Treatment of metformin overdose is generally supportive , as no specific antidote is known . Lactic acidosis is initially treated with sodium bicarbonate , although high doses are not recommended , as this may increase intracellular acidosis . Acidosis that does not respond to administration of sodium bicarbonate may require further management with standard hemodialysis or continuous <unk> hemofiltration . These treatments are recommended in severe overdoses . In addition , due to metformin 's low molecular weight and lack of plasma protein binding , these techniques also have the benefit of removing metformin from blood plasma , preventing further lactate overproduction . 
 Metformin may be quantified in blood , plasma , or serum to monitor therapy , confirm a diagnosis of poisoning , or assist in a medicolegal death investigation . Blood or plasma metformin concentrations are usually in a range of 1 – 4 mg / l in persons receiving the drug therapeutically , 40 – 120 mg / l in victims of acute overdosage , and 80 – 200 mg / l in fatalities . Chromatographic techniques are commonly employed . 
 = = = Interactions = = = 
 The H2 @-@ receptor antagonist cimetidine causes an increase in the plasma concentration of metformin , by reducing clearance of metformin by the kidneys ; both metformin and cimetidine are cleared from the body by tubular secretion , and both , particularly the cationic ( positively charged ) form of cimetidine , may compete for the same transport mechanism . A small double @-@ blind , randomized study found the antibiotic <unk> to also increase metformin concentrations by a similar mechanism ; theoretically , other cationic medications may produce the same effect . 
 = = Mechanism of action = = 
 Metformin decreases hyperglycemia primarily by suppressing glucose production by the liver ( hepatic gluconeogenesis ) . The " average " person with type 2 diabetes has three times the normal rate of gluconeogenesis ; metformin treatment reduces this by over one @-@ third . The molecular mechanism of metformin is incompletely understood : inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain ( complex I ) , activation of AMP @-@ activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , inhibition of glucagon @-@ induced elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) with reduced activation of protein kinase A ( PKA ) , inhibition of mitochondrial <unk> dehydrogenase , and an effect on gut microbiota have been proposed as potential mechanisms . 
 Activation of AMPK , an enzyme that plays an important role in insulin signaling , whole body energy balance , and the metabolism of glucose and fats , was required for metformin 's inhibitory effect on the production of glucose by liver cells . Activation of AMPK was required for an increase in the expression of small heterodimer partner , which in turn inhibited the expression of the hepatic <unk> genes <unk> <unk> and glucose 6 @-@ phosphatase . Metformin is frequently used in research along with AICA ribonucleotide as an AMPK agonist . More recent studies using mouse models in which the genes for <unk> and α2 catalytic subunits ( <unk> / 2 ) or <unk> , an upstream kinase of AMPK , had been knocked out in hepatocytes , have raised doubts over the obligatory role of AMPK , since the effect of metformin was not abolished by loss of AMPK function . The mechanism by which biguanides increase the activity of AMPK remains uncertain ; however , metformin increases the concentration of cytosolic adenosine monophosphate ( AMP ) ( as opposed to a change in total AMP or total AMP / adenosine triphosphate ) . Increased cellular AMP has also been proposed to explain the inhibition of glucagon @-@ induced increase in cAMP and activation of PKA . Metformin and other biguanides may antagonize the action of glucagon , thus reducing fasting glucose levels . Metformin also induces a profound shift in the faecal microbial community profile in diabetic mice and this may contribute to its mode of action possibly through an effect on glucagon @-@ like peptide @-@ 1 secretion . 
 In addition to suppressing hepatic glucose production , metformin increases insulin sensitivity , enhances peripheral glucose uptake ( by inducing the phosphorylation of <unk> enhancer factor ) , decreases insulin @-@ induced suppression of fatty acid oxidation , and decreases absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract . Increased peripheral use of glucose may be due to improved insulin binding to insulin receptors . The increase in insulin binding after metformin treatment has also been demonstrated in patients with <unk> . 
 AMPK probably also plays a role in increased insulin , as metformin administration increases AMPK activity in skeletal muscle . AMPK is known to cause <unk> deployment to the plasma membrane , resulting in insulin @-@ independent glucose uptake . Some metabolic actions of metformin do appear to occur by AMPK @-@ independent mechanisms ; the metabolic actions of metformin in the heart muscle can occur independent of changes in AMPK activity and may be mediated by <unk> <unk> and PKC @-@ dependent mechanisms . 
 = = Chemistry = = 
 The usual synthesis of metformin , originally described in 1922 and reproduced in multiple later patents and publications , involves the one @-@ pot reaction of dimethylamine hydrochloride and 2 @-@ <unk> over heat . 
 According to the procedure described in the 1975 Aron patent , and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia , equimolar amounts of dimethylamine and 2 @-@ <unk> are dissolved in toluene with cooling to make a concentrated solution , and an equimolar amount of hydrogen chloride is slowly added . The mixture begins to boil on its own , and after cooling , metformin hydrochloride precipitates with a 96 % yield . 
 = = Pharmacokinetics = = 
 Metformin has an oral bioavailability of 50 – 60 % under fasting conditions , and is absorbed slowly . Peak plasma concentrations ( <unk> ) are reached within one to three hours of taking immediate @-@ release metformin and four to eight hours with extended @-@ release formulations . The plasma protein binding of metformin is negligible , as reflected by its very high apparent volume of distribution ( 300 – 1000 l after a single dose ) . Steady state is usually reached in one or two days . 
 Metformin has acid dissociation constant values ( pKa ) of 2 @.@ 8 and 11 @.@ 5 , so exists very largely as the hydrophilic cationic species at physiological pH values . The metformin pKa values make metformin a stronger base than most other basic drugs with less than 0 @.@ 01 % nonionized in blood . Furthermore , the lipid solubility of the nonionized species is slight as shown by its low logP value [ log ( 10 ) of the distribution coefficient of the nonionized form between octanol and water ] of <unk> . These chemical parameters indicate low lipophilicity and , consequently , rapid passive diffusion of metformin through cell membranes is unlikely . The logP of metformin is less than that of phenformin ( <unk> ) because two methyl substituents on metformin impart lesser lipophilicity than the larger <unk> side chain in phenformin . More lipophilic derivatives of metformin are presently being investigated with the aim of producing <unk> with better oral absorption than metformin itself . 
 Metformin is not metabolized . It is cleared from the body by tubular secretion and excreted unchanged in the urine ; metformin is undetectable in blood plasma within 24 hours of a single oral dose . The average elimination half @-@ life in plasma is 6 @.@ 2 hours . Metformin is distributed to ( and appears to accumulate in ) red blood cells , with a much longer elimination half @-@ life : 17 @.@ 6 hours ( reported as ranging from 18 @.@ 5 to 31 @.@ 5 hours in a single @-@ dose study of <unk> people ) . 
 = = History = = 
 The biguanide class of antidiabetic drugs , which also includes the withdrawn agents phenformin and <unk> , originates from the French lilac or goat 's rue ( Galega officinalis ) , a plant used in folk medicine for several centuries . 
 Metformin was first described in the scientific literature in 1922 , by Emil Werner and James Bell , as a product in the synthesis of N , N @-@ <unk> . In 1929 , <unk> and <unk> discovered its sugar @-@ lowering action in rabbits , noting it was the most potent of the biguanide analogs they studied . This result was completely forgotten , as other guanidine analogs , such as the <unk> , took over and were themselves soon overshadowed by insulin . 
 Interest in metformin , however , picked up at the end of the 1940s . In 1950 , metformin , unlike some other similar compounds , was found not to decrease blood pressure and heart rate in animals . That same year , a prominent Philippine physician , Eusebio Y. Garcia , used metformin ( he named it <unk> ) to treat influenza ; he noted the drug " lowered the blood sugar to minimum physiological limit " and was not toxic . Garcia also believed metformin to have bacteriostatic , antiviral , antimalarial , antipyretic , and analgesic actions . In a series of articles in 1954 , Polish pharmacologist Janusz <unk> was unable to confirm most of these effects , including lowered blood sugar ; he did , however , observe some antiviral effects in humans . 
 While training at the Hôpital de la <unk> , French <unk> Jean Sterne studied the <unk> properties of <unk> , an alkaloid isolated from Galega officinalis , which is related in structure to metformin and had seen brief use as an antidiabetic before the <unk> were developed . Later , working at <unk> Aron in Paris , he was prompted by Garcia 's report to reinvestigate the blood sugar @-@ lowering activity of metformin and several biguanide analogs . Sterne was the first to try metformin on humans for the treatment of diabetes ; he coined the name " Glucophage " ( glucose eater ) for the drug and published his results in 1957 . 
 Metformin became available in the British National Formulary in 1958 . It was sold in the UK by a small Aron subsidiary called Rona . 
 Broad interest in metformin was not rekindled until the withdrawal of the other biguanides in the 1970s . Metformin was approved in Canada in 1972 , but did not receive approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for type 2 diabetes until 1994 . Produced under license by Bristol @-@ Myers Squibb , Glucophage was the first branded formulation of metformin to be marketed in the United States , beginning on March 3 , 1995 . Generic formulations are now available in several countries , and metformin is believed to have become the most widely prescribed antidiabetic drug in the world . 
 = = Formulations = = 
 Metformin is the BAN , USAN and INN . It is sold under several trade names , including Glucophage XR , <unk> SR , Riomet , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 Liquid metformin is sold under the name Riomet in India . Each 5 ml of Riomet is equivalent to the 500 @-@ mg tablet form of metformin . 
 Metformin IR ( immediate release ) is available in 500 , 850 , and 1000 @-@ mg tablets . All of these are now available as generic drugs in the U.S. 
 Metformin SR ( slow release ) or XR ( extended release ) was introduced in 2004 . It is available in 500 , 750 , and 1000 @-@ mg strengths , mainly to counteract the most common gastrointestinal side effects , as well as to increase compliance by reducing pill burden .

 A combination of metformin and rosiglitazone was released in 2002 and sold as <unk> by GlaxoSmithKline . By 2009 it had become the most popular metformin combination . In 2005 , all current stock of <unk> was seized by the FDA and removed from the market , after inspections showed the factory where it was produced was violating good manufacturing practices . The drug pair continued to be prescribed separately , which was available again by the end of that year . A generic formulation of metformin / rosiglitazone from Teva received tentative approval from the FDA , and was expected to reach the market in early 2012 . However , following a meta @-@ analysis in 2007 that linked the drug 's use to an increased risk of heart attack , concerns were raised over the safety of medicines containing rosiglitazone . In September 2010 the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) recommended that the drug be suspended from the European market because the benefits of rosiglitazone no longer outweighed the risks . It was withdrawn from the market in the UK and India in 2010 , and in New Zealand and South Africa in 2011 . From November 2011 until November 2013 the FDA in the U.S. did not allow rosiglitazone or metformin / rosiglitazone to be sold without a prescription ; moreover , people were required to be informed of the risks associated with its use , and the drug had to be purchased by mail order through specified pharmacies . In November 2013 , the FDA lifted its earlier restrictions on rosiglitazone after reviewing the results of the 2009 RECORD clinical trial ( a six @-@ year , open label randomized control trial ) , which failed to show elevated risk of heart attack or death associated with the drug .

 Snake is arrested for smoking inside the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart . Chief Wiggum explains that as this is Snake 's third strike , he will be executed in accordance with the new law . Before hauling Snake away , Chief Wiggum helpfully points out that Apu , Moe , and Bart are all witnesses ; Snake vows to kill all of them . Snake is executed in the electric chair on World 's Deadliest Executions , hosted by Ed McMahon and proudly broadcast on Fox , while Homer , who 's watching on TV , complains that they only do <unk> during sweeps . Chief Wiggum sends the body to the hospital to be used up for organ donations ( Barney calls out " <unk> on the liver " ) . 
 Shortly afterward , Homer visits Dr. Nick , who transplants Snake 's hair onto Homer 's head . When Homer goes to sleep the following night , it plants its roots in Homer 's brain . With the hair controlling his mind , Homer ( who begins to speak with Snake 's voice ) murders Apu by drowning him in his own Squishee machine . The next day , Homer goes to Moe 's Tavern , where he removes Moe 's heart with a corkscrew . Bart realizes that the other two witnesses have been killed , and Homer vows to protect him . Homer locks himself and Bart in a room , but Snake 's hair takes control of him . Homer tries to kill Bart with a sledgehammer . Bart begs Homer to fight the hair and , after a struggle , Homer rips the hair off his head . The hair tries to smother Bart ( like the Facehugger ) and Homer tries defending Bart by punching the hair , though due to it being attached to his face , all this does is hurt Bart. 
 Wiggum bursts through the door with the intention of arresting Homer for the murder of Moe ( not being able to say Apu 's last name , he settled for just the murder of Moe ) . Homer states the hair is the killer , and it makes a jump for the window . Wiggum opens fire and the hair is shot dead . Maggie picks up the hair and <unk> it close like a stuffed animal . Chief Wiggum jokes " now that 's a bad hair day " ; everyone laughs except Marge who reminds everyone that two well known people of Springfield have been murdered , only to suddenly get the joke , and joins in with the laughter .

 When Marge leaves , Bart finds a small piece of highly unstable plutonium in Homer 's toolbox and hammers it into the remote 's battery slot . When they use the remote , the kids actually enter the world of Itchy and Scratchy after they accidentally press the Enter button while Lisa tries to get the remote control from Bart. They watch Itchy decapitate Scratchy and use his head as a jack @-@ o ' -lantern . While the two laugh , Scratchy 's head asks why Bart and Lisa are laughing to which Itchy replies that they are laughing at his pain . Because of this , Scratchy reattaches his head and forms a partnership with Itchy to " teach them a lesson " . Back in the Simpson house , Homer enters the living room and watches the show . Bart and Lisa go through life @-@ death situations such as Itchy lighting up a cannon while Scratchy loads it with various weapons . Homer ( oblivious to what he sees on the TV ) decides to change the channel , and Bart , Lisa , Itchy and Scratchy wind up on Live with Regis and Kathie Lee . Afterward , they end up back at Itchy 's house and urge Homer from inside the TV to use the remote to get them out . While Homer is figuring out which button to press , Itchy and Scratchy unleash a hose full of piranhas at Bart , which eat away at his body until it is a skeleton ( although his head remains uneaten ) . Homer finally picks the right button and zaps them both out and Lisa then presses the rewind button to return Bart 's body to normal . Unfortunately , Itchy and Scratchy also escape from the TV into the real world , armed with axes . At first , the family is screaming , but realize how small the two characters are ( the size of a regular mouse and cat respectively ) and decide to keep them as pets . Itchy ends up in a hamster cage and Scratchy has fallen in love with Snowball II .

 When Maggie refuses to eat her oatmeal , the Simpsons discover she has gotten her first baby tooth , which appears to be a sharp fang . Later , when Homer is playing ' This Little Piggy ' with Maggie , her legs fall ( which Homer believes she lost her ' baby legs ' ) before growing green tentacles and climbing onto the ceiling while hissing , swinging Homer around the room when he tries to get her down with a broom . Dr. Hibbert , who can 't explain what 's happening to Maggie , prescribes lots of fire to Homer and Marge ( which Marge says is his cure for everything ) . 
 As Lisa comments that she wish Maggie could tell them what was happening to her , Maggie begins sucking on her pacifier in a rhythmic way , which is actually a message to the alien duo , Kang and Kodos to inform them her larval stage is complete . They arrive at the Simpson house , coming to retrieve Maggie . Marge reveals that Kang is Maggie 's real father , much to Homer 's shock and anger ( and worry that Kang was a better lover ) . Marge retells the story : Kang and Kodos abducted her while she was doing laundry , selecting Marge for a cross @-@ breeding program . She says the aliens used mind @-@ control techniques on her . In reality , the entire process consisted of Marge and Kang sitting on a couch , Kang quoting terrible pick @-@ up lines only to suddenly pull a " look @-@ over @-@ there " and use a ray which impregnates Marge as she looks . She recalls that nine months after the abduction , Maggie was born . 
 Kang and Kodos demand that the Simpsons give Maggie to them , and Kang and Homer start to fight over Maggie until Bart stops them and tells them there is only one place where something this bizarre can be resolved : The Jerry Springer Show , where the episode is entitled " My Daddy is a Space Monster " . On the set , Homer and Kang continually fight , throw chairs , and curse ( which is naturally bleeped out ) . When an audience member criticizes Kang for not being around for Maggie after he impregnated Marge , Kang vaporizes her , much to Jerry 's chagrin , and when he says that Kang can 't do that to his audience , Kang takes it as a challenge and vaporizes the rest of the audience and the film crew . During Jerry 's " final thought " , Maggie attacks Jerry Springer , upon which he swears at the baby , resulting in an angry Kang beating him to death while Homer continues to punch Kang . 
 After leaving the studio , Kang and Kodos threaten to destroy every politician in Washington unless given Maggie . Marge and the Simpsons slyly imply that the aliens could not possibly destroy every politician , and they fly off to do so .

 Like the other Treehouse of Horror episodes to that point , the segments of " Treehouse of Horror IX " were credited to different writers . " Hell <unk> " was written by Donick Cary . " Terror of Tiny Toon " was written by Larry Doyle . " Starship Poopers " was written by David S. Cohen and was the last writing credit he ever received for the show . The episode continues the Treehouse of Horror tradition of having the credits re @-@ written as " scary names " . David S. Cohen 's executive producer credit is " David ' Watch Futurama ' Cohen " is a reference to the show Futurama , created by Cohen and Matt Groening , which premiered the following year . 
 " The Terror of Tiny Toon " includes a live @-@ action segment starring Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford of Live with Regis and Kathie Lee . The segment was directed by Donick Cary . In the sequence , Itchy , Scratchy , Bart and Lisa fall into a pot of soup that Regis and Kathie Lee are making . The soup splash was created by dropping an item into the pot , then adding the animated characters over it . The taping of this segment took longer than expected , so a broadcast of WABC @-@ TV 's Eyewitness News that was to take place ( the show was and continues to be taped at the facilities of WABC in New York , where it originated in 1983 ) had to be moved to another studio . Jerry Springer also guest stars in the episode as himself . His lines were recorded by Julie Thacker . 
 Much of the animation in " Hell Toupée " was worked on by assistant director Chris Clements . Moe 's death scene was originally more violent , but it was toned down at the request of Mike Scully . The animators looked forward to working on " The Terror of Tiny Toon " because they were fans of Itchy & Scratchy . 
 In " Starship Poopers " , there is a shot of sound waves emanating from Springfield . At one point , there is a shot of North America and it appears that Springfield is located in Louisiana . The mystery of the location of Springfield is a running joke in The Simpsons , and a number of fans assumed that Louisiana was where the family lived . However , the animators had drawn the waves so that there were coming from the center of the screen , and they never intended to have them emanate from a specific location . In one scene , Marge is abducted by Kang and Kodos , who lasso her then pull her into the ship . According to David Cohen , it is a running gag that Kang and Kodos ' abduction methods are never the same . Maggie has a line at the end of the episode , where she sounds like Kang . She was voiced by Harry Shearer . 
 Poochie from the Simpsons episode " The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show " is seen during the " Terror of the Tiny Toon " segment . Also , the title of the segment " Terror of the Tiny Toon " , is a reference of the Animated television series Tiny Toon Adventures , as well as the movie The Terror of Tiny Town . The couch gag features Freddy Krueger from the Nightmare on Elm Street film series and Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th series . Freddy is voiced by Robert Englund , who portrayed the character in eight films . Two talk shows appear in the episode . Bart , Lisa , Itchy and Scratchy accidentally visit Live with Regis and Kathie Lee , while the Simpson family and Kang appear on The Jerry Springer Show . The title of the third segment , " Starship Poopers " , is a reference to the film Starship Troopers . David X. Cohen is credited as " David ' Watch Futurama ' Cohen " . Futurama , an animated science fiction sitcom also created by Matt Groening and executive produced by Cohen , premiered on Fox in 1999 .

 The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , wrote , " Another collection of horrors , of varying degrees of wit . The Itchy and Scratchy one is by far the best , and Starship Poopers is only really amusing once the Jerry Springer segment begins . " Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide gave the episode a positive review saying " The series usually rises to the occasion of its Halloween episodes , and “ IX ” doesn ’ t disappoint . Each of the three stories satisfies , as they offer a lot of clever , amusing moments . " Toupée " is probably the best , though , as it ’ s the most creative of the bunch . While funny , the other two can be a bit predictable . " Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times wrote that the episode is " certainly not on a par with that all @-@ time doppelganger classic , " Treehouse of Horror VII " , [ ... ] still , No. 9 's dialogue is sharp and there 's reassuring continuity to such beloved institutions as Itchy and Scratchy . " 
 In 2008 , " Starship Poopers " was named the tenth best Treehouse of Horror segment by IGN . They wrote that " While [ it is ] not the best Kang & Kodos segment , " Starship Poopers " delivers consistent laughs and a great ending , as Kang & Kodos vow to destroy all the politicians in Washington ( to the Simpsons ' delight ) and Maggie creepily laughs and says , " I need blood . " In 1999 , composer Alf Clausen was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series for his work on the episode .

 Peter , Brian , Cleveland and Joe are annoyed when Quagmire adopts a stray cat named James and prefers to spend more time with him than with them . When Quagmire goes to Vermont to buy him a birthday present , they decide to shave James as a prank , but it backfires when Peter accidentally kills him . He and Brian decide to hide his body , but are pulled over by the police , who ignore Peter 's blood stains and beer , but arrest Brian when they find him in possession of cannabis . He is bailed out by the family and put on probation for drug use . He attempts to use Stewie 's urine when Joe arrives to perform a drug test , only to be caught by Lois , who chastises him for going to such lengths and tells him that he has to change if he intends on doing so . However , Brian decides to start a campaign to legalize cannabis in Quahog . He and Stewie perform an enthusiastic musical number , and soon after the entire town rallies behind them in their cause . 
 Mayor West passes a law to legalize the drug , and everyone starts smoking it ; the town has improved as a result , with milestones such as an increase in productivity and a decrease in crime . However , Lois 's father , Carter , begins to lose money in the timber industry since hemp is being used to manufacture many products , particularly paper , and he bribes Peter to help him with an anti @-@ marijuana campaign . Lois , however , points out that their methods are uninspired , explaining that Brian only succeeded because he was passionate about legalizing cannabis . Carter decides to bribe Brian to join his cause by publishing and shipping his novel , Faster Than the Speed of Love . Brian resists at first , but Stewie suggests he at least perform a number about the health risks of cannabis , since the book does not have enough merit to sell on its own . Brian reluctantly complies , and the drug becomes illegal once more . 
 Unfortunately for Brian , when his novel is released , it is universally panned by literary critics and does not sell a single copy . Brian laments that he sacrificed his core beliefs for nothing , but Lois intervenes because he helped ban cannabis ( and she also points out how Stewie got to build a nice fort from all of Brian 's unsold books ) . A distraught Quagmire arrives at the household and informs Peter that he is still looking for James and offers a reward of $ 50 . Peter nonchalantly takes the reward , admits that he killed him and slams his door before Quagmire has a chance to react .

 " 420 " has been noted for being the final appearance of the recurring character Kevin Swanson , the son of characters Joe and Bonnie Swanson . Since the fifth season episode " Saving Private Brian " , series creator Seth MacFarlane and other staff writers had planned on writing out the character . MacFarlane recalls not having ideas to write for the character . During the episode 's production , the character of James the cat was originally colored white , but MacFarlane decided that it bear orange fur after he thought that white was a fairly dull color . The featured musical number , " A Bag o ' Weed , " was based on the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang song " Me Ol ' Bamboo " . 
 In addition to the regular cast , voice actor Phil LaMarr and voice actor Kerrigan Mahan guest starred in the episode . Recurring guest voice actors Lori Alan , Chris Cox , actor Ralph Garman , writer Danny Smith , writer Alec Sulkin and writer John Viener also made minor appearances .

 Peter , who tries to shave Quagmire 's cat in the episode , ends up killing it and cutting it six times because of the legend of cats having nine lives . As he is arresting Brian , one of the police officers states that he will not release him since he is a " family guy " . In their campaign , Brian and Stewie perform their musical number , ' " A Bag o ' Weed " , to the tune of " Me Ol ' Bamboo " as featured in the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang . During the song , a picture of Woody Harrelson is shown . Harrelson also wanted marijuana legalized . After cannabis is legalized , its effects include phenomenal ratings for Doctor Who . Peter then tries to remember something but ends up remembering the names of celebrities whom he does not like . While helping out with Carter 's smear campaign , Peter comes up with an advertisement that involves Adolf Hitler claiming that the Holocaust was started by smoking cannabis ; the campaign is dropped , however , because supposedly Fox News holds Hitler 's image rights and they cannot smear it . He later tries to film a new advertisement which informs that unlike the events of the film Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle , he made it there earlier since he was not stoned . He then says Neil Patrick Harris was cast on How I Met Your Mother based on his work in that film , and brings up a point that confuses him : since Josh Radnor is already an adult , why is the narrator of the show voiced by Bob Saget ? Carter later tells Brian that he will release his novel with an Oprah 's Book Club induction .

 = Hispanics in the United States Navy = 
 Hispanics in the United States Navy can trace their tradition of naval military service to men such as Lieutenant Jordi Farragut Mesquida , who served in the American Revolution . Hispanics , such as Seaman Philip Bazaar and Seaman John Ortega , have distinguished themselves in combat and have been awarded the Medal of Honor , the highest military decoration of the United States . Hispanics have also reached the top ranks of the Navy , serving their country in sensitive leadership positions on domestic and foreign shores . Among those who have reached the highest ranks in the Navy are Commodore Uriah Phillips Levy , of Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jewish descent , who participated in the War of 1812 as an assistant Sailing master ; Admiral David Glasgow Farragut , for whom the rank of Admiral in the U.S. Navy was created during the American Civil War ; and Admiral Horacio Rivero , who led the Navy during the Cuban Missile Crisis . 
 Hispanic is an ethnic term employed to categorize any citizen or resident of the United States , of any racial background , of any country , and of any religion , who has at least one ancestor from the people of Spain or is of non @-@ Hispanic origin , but has an ancestor from Mexico , Puerto Rico , Cuba , Central or South America , or some other Hispanic origin . The three largest Hispanic groups in the United States are the Mexican @-@ Americans , Puerto Ricans , and Cubans . 
 According to the U.S. Census Bureau the estimated Hispanic population of the United States is over 50 million , or 16 % of the U.S. population , and Hispanics are the nation 's largest ethnic or racial minority . The 2010 U.S. Census estimate of over 50 million Hispanics in the U.S. does not include the 3 @.@ 9 million residents of Puerto Rico . 
 More than 43 @,@ 000 people of Hispanic origin are sailors and civilians serving with the U.S. Navy . 
 The United States Navy has implemented aggressive recruitment programs directed towards this group . One of those programs is El Navy , whose principal aim is to attract those who speak Spanish . It has resulted in increased recruitment of Hispanics for entrance to the United States Naval Academy . As of April 2007 , thirteen Hispanic Americans who were graduates of the USNA , and nine who were commissioned after attending the Navy 's officer candidate school , have reached the rank of Rear Admiral and above . 
 = = American Revolution and the War of 1812 = = 
 The United States Navy traces its origins to the Continental Navy , which was established during the American Revolutionary War and was disbanded shortly thereafter . The United States Constitution provided the legal basis for a seaborne military force by giving Congress the power " to provide and maintain a navy . " Attacks against American shipping by Barbary Coast corsairs spurred Congress to employ this power by passing the Naval Act of 1794 ordering the construction and manning of six frigates . 
 Lieutenant Jordi Farragut Mesquida , ( 1755 – 1817 ) was a Spanish – Catalan by descent and a <unk> by birth . He immigrated to the American colonies and participated in the American Revolution as a lieutenant in the South Carolina Navy . During the Revolution , he fought the British at Savannah , Georgia , and in 1780 was captured during the battle of Charleston , South Carolina . He was released in a prisoner exchange and volunteered in the militia which fought at the Battle of Cowpens and Wilmington , North Carolina . Farragut Mesquida married Elizabeth Shine and had two sons , one of them was David Farragut .

He was the great @-@ great @-@ grandson of Dr. Samuel Nunez , the leader of the first Jewish colonists who helped found Savannah , Georgia . Levy was assigned sailing master on the USS Argus , which interdicted English ships in the English Channel during the War of 1812 . The ship confiscated more than twenty vessels , but was captured in 1813 and Levy and rest of the crew were taken prisoner until the end of the war . 
 Upon his return to the United States , Levy served as the sailing master on the 74 @-@ gun ship USS Franklin and in 1817 was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant . He was promoted to the rank of master commandant in 1837 , and the rank of captain in 1844 . In 1855 , Levy was given the courtesy title of commodore , in recognition of his superior abilities , making him one of the Navy 's highest @-@ ranking officers and the first Sephardic Jew of Hispanic descent to reach the rank , which at the time was the highest rank in the U.S. Navy .

 During the American Civil War , the government of the United States recognized that the rapidly expanding Union Navy was in need of admirals . Therefore , on July 16 , 1862 Congress proceeded to authorize the appointment of nine officers to the rank of rear admiral , making Flag Officer David Glasgow Farragut the first Hispanic @-@ American to be appointed said grade . 
 David Glasgow Farragut ( 1801 – 1870 ) was born on at Campbell 's Station , near Knoxville , Tennessee , to Jordi and Elizabeth Farragut . After Farragut 's mother died from yellow fever in his 1808 , his father gave him up for adoption , and he was adopted by future @-@ U.S. Navy Captain David Porter . 
 On December 17 , 1810 , Farragut entered the Navy as a midshipman aboard the USS Essex . He was 12 years old when , during the War of 1812 , he was given the assignment to bring a ship captured by the USS Essex , safely to port . 
 In April 1862 , Farragut was the " flag officer " in command of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron . With his flagship , the USS Hartford , he ran past Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip and the <unk> , Louisiana , batteries to take the city and port of New Orleans , Louisiana . This victory was an influential factor when in 1862 , Congress created the rank of Admiral and named Farragut and eight other naval officers ( which also included his foster brother David Dixon Porter ) as rear admirals . Thus , Farragut became the first Hispanic @-@ American admiral in the United States Navy . 
 Farragut 's greatest victory was the Battle of Mobile Bay on August 5 , 1864 . Mobile , Alabama , at the time was the Confederacy 's last major port open on the Gulf of Mexico . The bay was heavily mined with tethered naval mines , also known as torpedoes . When the USS Tecumseh , one of the ships under his command , struck a mine and went down , Farragut shouted through a trumpet from his flagship to the USS Brooklyn , " What 's the trouble ? " " Torpedoes ! " was the reply , to which Farragut then shouted his now famous words " Damn the torpedoes ! Full speed ahead ! " The fleet succeeded in entering the bay . Farragut then triumphed over the opposition of heavy batteries in Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines to defeat the squadron of Admiral Franklin Buchanan . Farragut was promoted to vice admiral on December 21 , 1864 , and to full admiral on July 25 , 1866 , after the war , thereby becoming the first person to be named full admiral in the Navy 's history .

 Seaman John Ortega ( born in 1840 in Spain ) , was a resident of Pennsylvania who joined the Union Navy in his adopted hometown in Pennsylvania . Ortega was assigned to the USS Saratoga during the Civil War . The USS Saratoga was ordered to proceed to Charleston , South Carolina , for duty in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron . Ortega was a member of the landing parties from the ship who made several raids in August and September in 1864 , which resulted in the capture of many prisoners and the taking or destruction of substantial quantities of ordnance , ammunition , and supplies . A number of buildings , bridges , and salt works were destroyed during the expedition . For his actions Seaman John Ortega was awarded the Medal of Honor and promoted to acting master 's mate . 
 Seaman Philip Bazaar , born in Chile , South America , was a resident of Massachusetts , who joined the Union Navy at New Bedford . He was assigned to the USS Santiago de Cuba , a wooden , brigantine @-@ rigged , side @-@ wheel steamship under the command of Rear Admiral David D. Porter . In the latter part of 1864 , Union General Ulysses S.

However , the submarines were equipped with snorkels that allowed them to spend long periods underwater , largely invisible to an enemy , and with electronic gear designed to detect far @-@ off radio signals – were part of an American intelligence operation . 
 The mission of the Cochino and Tusk was to eavesdrop on communications that revealed the testing of submarine @-@ launched Soviet missiles that might soon carry nuclear warheads . This was the first American undersea spy mission of the cold war . 
 On August 25 , one the Cochino 's 4 @,@ 000 @-@ pound batteries caught fire , emitting hydrogen gas and smoke . Unable to receive any help from the Tusk , Commander Benitez directed the firefighting . He ordered the Cochino to surface and had the crew members lash themselves to the deck rails with ropes while others fought the blaze . Benitez tried to save his ship and at the same time save his men from the toxic gases . He realized that the winds were about to tear the ropes and ordered his men to form a pyramid on the ship 's open bridge , which was designed to hold seven men . 
 The ocean waters became calmer during the night and the Tusk was able to approach the Cochino . All of the crew , with the exception of Commander Benitez and two of the crew who perished during the ordeal , boarded the Tusk .

 As part of promotion for " Remember the Time " , a music video , which was filmed in mid @-@ January 1992 , was released . Prior to the release of the video , Jackson 's record label promoted it by releasing clips , as well as releasing behind the scenes clips of making the video . The nine @-@ minute video was promoted as a " short film " . It premiered on MTV , Fox and Black Entertainment Television on February 2 , 1992 . After the video premiered on MTV , the channel aired a " rockumentary " called " More Dangerous Than Ever " which included glimpses of the making of the video . Jackson 's record label would not release the video 's budget figures . Directed by John Singleton and choreographed by Fatima Robinson , the video was an elaborate production and became one of Jackson 's longest videos at over nine minutes . It was set in ancient Egypt and featured groundbreaking visual effects and appearances by Eddie Murphy , Iman , The Pharcyde , Magic Johnson , Tom " Tiny " Lister , Jr. and Wylie Draper , who portrayed Jackson as an adult in the made for TV movie The Jacksons : An American Dream and died shortly after appearing in this video .

 Jackson appears in the video as a hooded wizard who enters an Egyptian palace and attempts to entertain the Pharaoh 's bored Queen . Two other entertainers have failed , and she has sent them to be executed . The Queen sees that this wizard is different — instead of juggling or eating fire , he walks up the steps to her throne and sings to her , asking her if she " remembers the time " they were together . The Pharaoh ( played by Murphy ) hardly appreciates this move and summons his guards . Jackson runs away to another room and begins elaborate , Egyptian @-@ style choreography with the Pharaoh 's servants . When the guards find him , the servants disappear as does Jackson , in a swirl and a cloud of golden dust . In the video , Jackson was dressed in a costume made of gold satin . He wore golden chain mail , a white skirt with a phallic dangling sash , black pants and black boots . This video features a physically complicated dance routine that became the centerpiece of other videos from the Dangerous album . 
 The music video was generally well received by music critics . Ira Robbins of Entertainment Weekly described " Remember the Time " as being a " gorgeous ancient Egyptian extravaganza " video . The music video appeared on the video albums : Dangerous – The Short Films , Video Greatest Hits – HIStory and Michael Jackson 's Vision . The music video , along with other videos from Dangerous , was frequently shown on MTV .

 Ulf Niklas Alexander Edler ( born 21 April 1986 ) is a Swedish professional ice hockey defenceman currently playing for the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . He was drafted out of Sweden 's third @-@ tier ice hockey league by the Canucks in the third round , 91st overall , in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft , and played junior ice hockey with Modo of the J20 SuperElit and the Kelowna Rockets of the Western Hockey League ( WHL ) . 
 Edler turned professional in North America with the Canucks ' American Hockey League ( AHL ) affiliate , the Manitoba Moose , in 2006 – 07 , seeing some time in the NHL over the course of the season . He became a full @-@ time member of the Canucks the following season , and has since been named to one NHL All @-@ Star Game ( 2012 ) . 
 Internationally , he has competed for Sweden on four occasions — at the 2006 World Junior Championships , the 2008 and 2013 IIHF World Championships ( winning gold ) and the 2014 Winter Olympics ( winning silver ) . Edler is an offensive defenceman noted for his calm on @-@ ice demeanor and strong slapshot .

 Edler played at the under @-@ 17 level with his hometown district team of Jämtland in 2001 and 2002 , competing at TV @-@ pucken , a national Swedish tournament . In 2003 – 04 , he joined the professional Jämtlands HF . He played with the club in Sweden 's third @-@ tier league , recording three goals and nine points in 24 games , while also appearing in six games for Jämtlands HF 's junior team . 
 Edler was largely unknown during his NHL Draft year , unranked by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau the entire season . He was brought to the attention of the Vancouver Canucks by the team 's head scout in Sweden , Thomas Gradin , who saw Edler playing with Jämtlands HF . Although Gradin would refer to the team 's level of play as little more than beer @-@ league @-@ calibre , he was impressed with Edler and encouraged Canucks management to draft him ( Edler 's number 23 with the Canucks would later be chosen by team trainers in honour of Gradin ) . The Canucks traded up in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft to acquire the Dallas Stars ' third @-@ round draft pick in exchange for their own third @-@ round pick in the 2005 Draft , and used the pick to select Edler 91st overall . The deal was made with the Stars in lieu of speculation that the Detroit Red Wings had a high interest in Edler and wanted to draft him in the third round as well . Detroit had discovered Edler in Sweden through their European scout Håkan Andersson , who was responsible for such previous Red Wings late @-@ round picks as Henrik Zetterberg and Pavel Datsyuk . At the time of his draft , Canucks General Manager Dave Nonis described Edler as a " smooth skater [ and a ] big guy . " Nonis added that , " He needs some time [ to develop ] , but in terms of raw skill , he 's got quite a bit of it . " 
 After being selected by the Canucks , Gradin brokered a move for Edler to play with Modo Hockey 's junior club of the J20 SuperElit . Edler had previously tried out for Modo 's youth program , but was cut . Future Canucks teammates Markus Näslund , Henrik Sedin and Daniel Sedin had also played in the Modo system before joining the NHL . In Edler 's lone season with Modo , he recorded eight goals and 23 points over 33 games in 2004 – 05 . He ranked second in point @-@ scoring among league defensemen to Modo teammate Tommy <unk> , who recorded 33 . 
 On 29 June 2005 , Edler 's major junior rights were obtained by the Kelowna Rockets of the Western Hockey League ( WHL ) ; he was chosen by Kelowna in the first round , 58th overall , of the Canadian Hockey League ( CHL ) Import Draft . The Canucks encouraged Edler to move from Sweden to play junior in North America . After reporting to training camp with the Canucks ' American Hockey League ( AHL ) affiliate , the Manitoba Moose , in September 2005 , he was assigned to junior with the Rockets . In his lone WHL season , Edler collected 13 goals and 53 points over 62 games in 2005 – 06 , ranking fifth among WHL defencemen and fourth among total rookies in scoring . He went on to help Kelowna to the second round of the WHL playoffs , where they were eliminated by the Everett Silvertips . In 12 post @-@ season games , Edler added eight points . 
 = = = Vancouver Canucks ( from 2006 ) = = = 
 The following off @-@ season , Edler was signed to an entry @-@ level contract by the Canucks on 24 July 2006 . Reporting to the Canucks ' training camp in September 2006 , his play had the Canucks slotting him in as the team 's seventh defenseman . However , a hip injury saw him assigned to the Manitoba Moose . Following an injury to Canucks defenseman Sami Salo , he was called up to the NHL on 3 November 2006 , two games into his AHL season . He made his NHL debut the following day against the Colorado Avalanche . Eleven days later , however , he was reassigned to the Moose , only to be recalled on 24 November . He scored his first NHL goal on 30 November , a slap shot that beat Anaheim Ducks goaltender Jean @-@ Sébastien Giguère in a 2 – 1 loss . Edler was reassigned between Manitoba and Vancouver on several more occasions over the course of the 2006 – 07 season . He appeared in 22 games total for the Canucks , recording a goal and two assists . With the Moose , he scored five goals and 26 points over 49 games and was named Manitoba 's Rookie of the Year . 
 Playing in his rookie season with the Canucks the following season , Edler was chosen to compete in the 2008 NHL YoungStars Game . Representing the Western Conference , his team was defeated by the Eastern Conference by a 7 – 6 score . Playing amidst numerous injuries on the Canucks ' blueline , Edler appeared in the most games among team defensemen with 75 . With all the injuries to his teammates , he was given additional time on the power play and penalty kill . His eight goals ranked second among rookie defensemen in the NHL , while his 20 points was fifth overall . 
 At the start of the 2008 – 09 season , Edler was re @-@ signed to a four @-@ year , $ 13 million contract extension on 9 October 2008 . The contract , a raise from his 2008 – 09 salary of $ 550 @,@ 000 , took into effect the following campaign . The following month , he missed two games sidelined with the flu . Later in the season , he recorded a personal best four @-@ point game ( one goal and three assists ) in a game against the Chicago Blackhawks on 7 February 2009 . He finished with 37 points , including a career @-@ high ten goals . In the 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs , Edler led all team defensemen with seven points in ten games as the Canucks were eliminated in the second round by Chicago . In his first few seasons in the NHL , Edler was often paired with veteran <unk> and countryman Mattias Öhlund , who he considered a mentor for him ( Öhlund left the Canucks to free agency in the 2009 off @-@ season and signed with the Tampa Bay Lightning ) . 
 The following campaign , Edler improved to career @-@ highs of 37 assists , first among team defensemen , and 42 points , second to Christian Ehrhoff . He missed six games near the midpoint of the campaign due to a left arm injury , sustained in December 2009 . In the post @-@ season , he added six points in 12 games as the Canucks lost again in the second round to the Blackhawks . Edler was injured in the sixth and deciding game of the series after opposing forward Dustin <unk> stepped on his right ankle after hitting him along the boards . Requiring a walking cast for five weeks , he rehabilitated his ankle during the off @-@ season . 
 Recovering in time for the 2010 – 11 season , Edler continued to improve and was on pace to record new career @-@ highs in goals , assists and points when he suffered a back injury in January 2011 . Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis told reporters that Edler had been experiencing tightness in his back at several times in the season , but an open @-@ ice hit against Dallas Stars forward Jamie Benn during a game on 24 January might have contributed to his back problems . Edler underwent <unk> surgery to relieve pressure on a herniated disk and was sidelined for two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half months , returning for the second @-@ last game of the regular season . Finishing the season with eight goals and 33 points over 51 games , he ranked second among team defencemen in scoring , behind Ehrhoff . His 24 minutes and 17 seconds of average ice time per game also led the Canucks . As the Canucks won the Presidents ' Trophy for the first time in franchise history , the team entered the 2011 playoffs with the first seed in the West . Eliminating the Chicago Blackhawks , Nashville Predators and San Jose Sharks , the Canucks advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in 17 years . Facing the Boston Bruins , the team lost the series in seven games . Following their defeat , it was revealed that several Canucks players had been playing with injuries , including Edler , who played Game 7 with two broken fingers . He ranked second among Canucks defensemen and third in the League overall with 11 points ( 2 goals and 9 assists ) in 25 games . 
 With the departure of Christian Ehrhoff , the Canucks ' leading defensive scorer from the previous two seasons , to the Buffalo Sabres in the off @-@ season , Edler assumed a larger role on the team 's blueline in the 2011 – 12 season . By mid @-@ January 2012 , Edler was ranked fourth among NHL defenceman in scoring with seven goals and 24 points . That month , he was selected to his first NHL All @-@ Star Game . He was selected to the competition alongside Canucks teammates Daniel and Henrik Sedin , as well as Cody Hodgson , who was named to the rookie squad . Playing for Team Alfredsson , Edler logged 21 minutes of ice time in a 12 – 9 loss to Team Chara . Edler finished the campaign having played all 82 games for the first time in his career . He recorded personal bests and team @-@ highs among defensemen in all major statistical categories with 11 goals , 38 assists and 49 points . League @-@ wide , he ranked seventh among defensemen in point @-@ scoring . Out of eight attempts , his four shootout goals was first among NHL defensemen . His efforts helped the Canucks to a second consecutive Presidents ' Trophy . Individually , he earned four fifth @-@ place votes for the James Norris Memorial Trophy to rank 15th overall . Defending their Campbell Bowl as Western Conference champions from the previous year , the Canucks lost in the first round of the 2012 playoffs to the Los Angeles Kings . Edler recorded two goals in the five @-@ game series . 
 On 18 January 2013 , Edler signed a six @-@ year , $ 30 million contract extension to remain with the Canucks . During the summer Edler was the talk of trade rumors at the trade deadline . The Red Wings were the team most interested in Edler and GM Mike Gills tried to move Edler before his NTC ( No trade clause ) went into effect on 1 July . In the end no deal was made and Edler stayed with the Canucks . 
 = = International play = = 
 Eder made his first appearance for Sweden at the under @-@ 20 level , competing in the 2006 World Junior Championships in British Columbia . He notched his lone point of the tournament , an assist , in a 10 – 2 round @-@ robin win against Latvia . Sweden went on to finish in fifth place , having lost their quarterfinal game to Finland . Two years later , Edler debuted with Sweden 's men 's team at the 2008 IIHF World Championships in Halifax and Quebec City . He scored his first international goal on the powerplay against French goaltender Fabrice <unk> in a 9 – 0 round @-@ robin win . Sweden went on to the bronze medal game , where they were defeated by Canada 5 – 4 . Edler finished with a goal and two assists in eight games . His 19 : 02 minutes of average ice time per game ranked third among team defencemen . 
 Edler was responsible for a knee @-@ on @-@ knee hit to Carolina Hurricanes captain Eric Staal in the quarterfinals of the 2013 IIHF World Championship , and was suspended for the final two games of the championship . Sweden went on to win the gold medal , and Edler was awarded a medal even though he did not play in the gold medal game . On 29 July 2013 , the IIHF extended the suspension to cover Sweden 's first two games of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi . Edler later joined team Sweden during the Olympics after his two @-@ game suspension . He <unk> a goal and two assists in the tournament , helping Sweden earn the silver medal . 
 = = Playing style = = 
 Edler plays in the style of an offensive defenseman . One of his strongest offensive assets is his slapshot . At the Canucks ' 2008 SuperSkills event , he beat the team 's reigning hardest shooter , Sami Salo , with a 99 @.@ 3 mile @-@ per @-@ hour shot and has gone on to win the competition in 2009 and 2010 , as well . He is also known for his poise and confidence with the puck , allowing him to make strong first passes out of the defensive zone to forwards . Many within the Canucks organization , such as Assistant Coach Rick Bowness , have asserted this as a reflection of his calm off @-@ ice demeanor . 
 Despite Edler 's imposing physical characteristics , he was not known to be an aggressive defender early in his NHL career . However , he has gradually shown a capability for physicality and to hit opposing players hard . Looking back on his transition to North American hockey with the Kelowna Rockets , Edler noted the most difficult adjustment was the physical aspect of the game , which was more pronounced than in Sweden . During the Canucks ' 2011 playoff run , teammate Kevin Bieksa compared him to Edler 's former defensive partner , Mattias Öhlund , commenting , " He [ Edler ] was like Bambi when he first came into the league but now he realized how big and strong he is . When he hits guys , he hurts them . "

 The Rokeby Venus ( / <unk> / ; also known as The Toilet of Venus , Venus at her Mirror , Venus and Cupid , or La Venus del <unk> ) is a painting by Diego Velázquez , the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age . Completed between 1647 and 1651 , and probably painted during the artist 's visit to Italy , the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose , lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love , her son Cupid . The painting is in the National Gallery , London . 
 Numerous works , from the ancient to the baroque , have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velázquez . The nude Venuses of the Italian painters , such as Giorgione 's Sleeping Venus ( c . 1510 ) and Titian 's Venus of Urbino ( 1538 ) , were the main precedents . In this work , Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus : recumbent on a couch or a bed , and gazing at a mirror . She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror , although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction . This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect . In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure , through its central use of a mirror , and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting . 
 The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving female nude by Velázquez . Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth @-@ century Spanish art , which was policed actively by members of the Spanish Inquisition . Despite this , nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle , and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813 , when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park , Yorkshire . In 1906 , the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery , London . Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson , it soon was fully restored and returned to display . 
 = = The painting = = 
 = = = Description = = = 
 The Rokeby Venus depicts the Roman goddess of love , beauty and fertility reclining languidly on her bed , her back to the viewer — in Antiquity , portrayal of Venus from a back view was a common visual and literary erotic motif — and her knees tucked . She is shown without the mythological paraphernalia normally included in depictions of the scene ; jewellery , roses , and myrtle are all absent . Unlike most earlier portrayals of the goddess , which show her with blond hair , Velázquez 's Venus is a brunette . The female figure can be identified as Venus because of the presence of her son , Cupid . 
 Venus gazes into a mirror held by Cupid , who is without his usual bow and arrows . When the work was first inventoried , it was described as " a nude woman " , probably owing to its controversial nature . Venus looks outward at the viewer of the painting through her reflected image in the mirror . However , the image is blurred and reveals only a vague reflection of her facial characteristics ; the reflected image of the head is much larger than it would be in reality . The critic Natasha Wallace has speculated that Venus 's indistinct face may be the key to the underlying meaning of the painting , in that " it is not intended as a specific female nude , nor even as a portrayal of Venus , but as an image of self @-@ absorbed beauty . " According to Wallace , " There is nothing spiritual about face or picture . The classical setting is an excuse for a very material aesthetic sexuality — not sex , as such , but an appreciation of the beauty that accompanies attraction . " 
 Intertwining pink silk ribbons are draped over the mirror and curl over its frame . The ribbon 's function has been the subject of much debate by art historians ; suggestions include an allusion to the fetters used by Cupid to bind lovers , that it was used to hang the mirror , and that it was used to blindfold Venus moments before . The critic Julián Gallego found Cupid 's facial expression to be so melancholy that he interprets the ribbons as fetters binding the god to the image of Beauty , and gave the painting the title " Amor conquered by Beauty " . 
 The folds of the bed sheets echo the goddess 's physical form , and are rendered to emphasise the sweeping curves of her body . The composition mainly uses shades of red , white , and grey , which are used even in Venus 's skin ; although the effect of this simple colour scheme has been much praised , recent technical analysis has shown that the grey sheet was originally a " deep mauve " , that has now faded . The luminescent colours used in Venus 's skin , applied with " smooth , creamy , blended handling " , contrast with the dark greys and black of the silk she is lying on , and with the brown of the wall behind her face . 
 The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving nude by Velázquez , but three others by the artist are recorded in 17th @-@ century Spanish inventories . Two were mentioned in the Royal collection , but may have been lost in the 1734 fire that destroyed the main Royal Palace of Madrid . A further one was recorded in the collection of Domingo Guerra Coronel . These records mention " a reclining Venus " , Venus and Adonis , and a Psyche and Cupid . 
 Although the work is widely thought to have been painted from life , the identity of the model is subject to much speculation . In contemporary Spain it was acceptable for artists to employ male nude models for studies ; however , the use of female nude models was frowned upon . The painting is believed to have been executed during one of Velázquez 's visits to Rome , and Prater has observed that in Rome the artist " did indeed lead a life of considerable personal liberty that would have been consistent with the notion of using a live nude female model " . It has been claimed that the painting depicts a mistress Velázquez is known to have had while in Italy , who is supposed to have borne his child . Others have claimed that the model is the same as in Coronation of the Virgin and Las <unk> , both in the Museo del Prado , and other works . 
 The figures of both Venus and Cupid were significantly altered during the painting process , the result of the artist 's corrections to the contours as initially painted . <unk> can be seen in Venus 's upraised arm , in the position of her left shoulder , and on her head . Infra @-@ red reveals that she was originally shown more upright with her head turned to the left . An area on the left of the painting , extending from Venus 's left foot to the left leg and foot of Cupid , is apparently unfinished , but this feature is seen in many other works by Velázquez and was probably deliberate . The painting was given a major cleaning and restoration in 1965 – 66 , which showed it to be in good condition , and with very little paint added later by other artists , contrary to what some earlier writers had asserted . 
 = = Nudes in 17th @-@ century Spain = = 
 The portrayal of nudes was officially discouraged in 17th @-@ century Spain . Works could be seized or repainting demanded by the Inquisition , and artists who painted licentious or immoral works were often excommunicated , fined , or banished from Spain for a year . However , within intellectual and aristocratic circles , the aims of art were believed to supersede questions of morality , and there were many , generally mythological , nudes in private collections . 
 Velázquez 's patron , the art @-@ loving King Philip IV , held a number of nudes by Titian and Rubens , and Velázquez , as the king 's painter , need not have feared painting such a picture . Leading collectors , including the King , tended to keep nudes , many mythological , in relatively private rooms ; in Phillip 's case " the room where His Majesty retires after eating " , which contained the Titian poesies he had inherited from Phillip II , and the Rubens he had commissioned himself . The Venus would be in such a room while in the collections of both Haro and Godoy . The court of Philip IV greatly " appreciated painting in general , and the nude in particular , but ... at the same time , exerted unparalleled pressure on artists to avoid the depiction of the naked human body . " 
 The contemporary Spanish attitude toward paintings of nudes was unique in Europe . Although such works were appreciated by some connoisseurs and intellectuals within Spain , they were generally treated with suspicion . Low necklines were commonly worn by women during the period , but according to the art historian <unk> <unk> , " the codes of pictorial decorum would not easily permit a known lady to be painted in this way " . For Spaniards of the 17th century , the issue of the nude in art was tied up with concepts of morality , power , and aesthetics . This attitude is reflected in the literature of the Spanish Golden Age , in works such as Lope de Vega 's play La <unk> de Florencia , which features an aristocrat who commits rape after viewing a scantily clad figure in a mythological painting by Michelangelo . 
 In 1632 , an anonymous pamphlet — attributed to the Portuguese Francisco de Braganza — was published with the title " A copy of the opinions and censorship by the most revered fathers , masters and senior professors of the distinguished universities of Salamanca and Alcalá , and other scholars on the abuse of lascivious and indecent figures and paintings , which are mortal sin to be painted , carved and displayed where they can be seen " . The court was able to exert counter @-@ pressure , and a piece by the famous poet and preacher Fray <unk> Félix Paravicino , which proposed the destruction of all paintings of the nude , and was written to be included in the pamphlet , was never published . Paravicino was a connoisseur of painting , and therefore believed in its power : " the finest paintings are the greatest threat : burn the best of them " . As his title shows , Braganza merely argued that such works should be kept from the view of a wider public , as was in fact mostly the practice in Spain . 
 In contrast , French art of the period often depicted women with low necklines and slender corsets ; however , the mutilation by the French royal family of the Correggio depiction of Leda and the Swan and their apparent destruction of the famous Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo paintings of the same subject , show that nudity could be controversial in France also . In northern Europe it was seen as acceptable to portray artfully draped nudes . Examples include Rubens 's Minerva Victrix , of 1622 – 25 , which shows Marie de ' Medici with an uncovered breast , and Anthony van Dyck 's 1620 painting , The Duke and Duchess of Buckingham as Venus and Adonis . 
 In 17th @-@ century Spanish art , even in the depiction of <unk> , nymphs , and goddesses , the female form was always chastely covered . No painting from the 1630s or 1640s , whether in the genre , portrait , or history format , shows a Spanish female with her breasts exposed ; even uncovered arms were only rarely shown . In 1997 , the art historian Peter Cherry suggested that Velázquez sought to overcome the contemporary requirement for modesty by portraying Venus from the back . Even in the mid @-@ 18th century , an English artist who made a drawing of the Venus when it was in the collection of the Dukes of Alba noted it was " not hung up , owing to the subject " . 
 Another attitude to the issue was shown by Morritt , who wrote to Sir Walter Scott of his " fine painting of Venus ' backside " , which he hung above his main fireplace , so that " the ladies may avert their downcast eyes without difficulty and connoisseurs steal a glance without drawing the said posterior into the company " . 
 = = Provenance = = 
 The Rokeby Venus was long held to be one of Velázquez 's final works . In 1951 , it was found recorded in an inventory of June 1 , 1651 from the collection of Gaspar Méndez de Haro , 7th Marquis of Carpio , a close associate of Philip IV of Spain . Haro was the great @-@ nephew of Velázquez 's first patron , the Count @-@ Duke of Olivares , and a notorious libertine . According to the art historian Dawson Carr , Haro " loved paintings almost as much as he loved women " , and " even his panegyrists lamented his excessive taste for lower @-@ class women during his youth " . For these reasons it seemed likely that he would have commissioned the painting . However , in 2001 the art historian Ángel <unk> discovered that the painting had first belonged to the Madrid art dealer and painter Domingo Guerra Coronel , and was sold to Haro in 1652 following Coronel 's death the previous year . Coronel 's ownership of the painting raises a number of questions : how and when it came into Coronel 's possession , and why Velázquez 's name was omitted from Coronel 's inventory . The art critic Javier <unk> has suggested that the omission may have been due to the painting 's portrayal of a female nude , " a type of work which was carefully supervised and whose dissemination was considered problematic " . 
 These revelations make the painting difficult to date . Velázquez 's painting technique offers no assistance , although its strong emphasis on colour and tone suggest that the work dates from his mature period . The best estimates of its origin put its completion in the late 1640s or early 1650s , either in Spain or during Velázquez 's last visit to Italy . If this is the case , then the breadth of handling and the dissolution of form can be seen to mark the beginning of the artist 's final period . The conscientious modelling and strong tonal contrasts of his earlier work are here replaced by a restraint and subtlety which would culminate in his late masterpiece , Las Meninas . 
 The painting passed from Haro into the collection of his daughter Catalina de Haro y Guzmán , the eighth Marchioness of Carpio , and her husband , Francisco Álvarez de Toledo , the tenth Duke of Alba . In 1802 , Charles IV of Spain ordered the family to sell the painting ( with other works ) to Manuel de Godoy , his favourite and chief minister . He hung it alongside two masterpieces by Francisco Goya that he may have commissioned himself , The Nude Maja and The Clothed Maja . These bear obvious compositional similarities with Velázquez 's Venus , although unlike Velázquez , Goya clearly painted his nude in a calculated attempt to provoke shame and disgust in the relatively unenlightened climate of 18th @-@ century Spain . 
 Venus was brought to England in 1813 , where it was purchased by John Morritt for £ 500 ( £ 29 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) , and on the advice of his friend Sir Thomas Lawrence . Morritt hung it in his house at Rokeby Park , Yorkshire — thus the painting 's popular name . In 1906 , the painting was acquired for the National Gallery by the newly created National Art Collections Fund , its first campaigning triumph . King Edward VII greatly admired the painting , and anonymously provided £ 8 @,@ 000 ( £ 780 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) towards its purchase , and became Patron of the Fund thereafter .

 In part because he was overlooked until the mid @-@ 19th century , Velázquez found no followers and was not widely imitated . In particular , his visual and structural innovations in this portrayal of Venus were not developed by other artists until recently , largely owing to the censorship of the work . The painting remained in a series of private rooms in private collections until it was exhibited in 1857 at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition , along with 25 other paintings at least claimed to be by Velázquez ; it was here that it became known as the Rokeby Venus . It does not appear to have been copied by other artists , engraved or otherwise reproduced , until this period . In 1890 it was exhibited in the Royal Academy in London , and in 1905 at Messrs. <unk> , the dealers who had bought it from Morritt . From 1906 it was highly visible in the National Gallery and became well @-@ known globally through reproductions . The general influence of the painting was therefore long delayed , although individual artists would have been able to see it on occasion throughout its history . 
 Velázquez 's portrait is a staging of a private moment of intimacy and a dramatic departure from the classical depictions of sleep and intimacy found in works from antiquity and Venetian art that portray Venus . However , the simplicity with which Velázquez displays the female nude — without jewellery or any of the goddess 's usual accessories — was echoed in later nude studies by Ingres , Manet , and <unk> , among others . In addition , Velázquez 's depiction of Venus as a reclining nude viewed from the rear was a rarity before that time , although the pose has been painted by many later artists . Manet , in his stark female portrayal Olympia , paraphrased the Rokeby Venus in pose and by suggesting the persona of a real woman rather than an ethereal goddess . Olympia shocked the Parisian art world when it was first exhibited in 1863 . Olympia gazes directly out at the viewer , as does Velázquez 's Venus , only through the reflection of the mirror . 
 = = Vandalism , 1914 = = 
 On March 10 , 1914 , the suffragette Mary Richardson walked into the National Gallery and attacked Velázquez 's canvas with a meat cleaver . Her action was ostensibly provoked by the arrest of fellow suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day , although there had been earlier warnings of a planned suffragette attack on the collection . Richardson left seven slashes on the painting , particularly causing damage to the area between the figure 's shoulders . However , all were successfully repaired by the National Gallery 's chief restorer Helmut Ruhemann . 
 Richardson was sentenced to six months ' imprisonment , the maximum allowed for destruction of an artwork . In a statement to the Women 's Social and Political Union shortly afterwards , Richardson explained , " I have tried to destroy the picture of the most beautiful woman in mythological history as a protest against the Government for destroying Mrs. Pankhurst , who is the most beautiful character in modern history . " She added in a 1952 interview that she didn 't like " the way men visitors gaped at it all day long " . 
 The feminist writer Lynda <unk> observed , " The incident has come to symbolize a particular perception of feminist attitudes towards the female nude ; in a sense , it has come to represent a specific stereotypical image of feminism more generally . " Contemporary reports of the incident reveal that the picture was not widely seen as mere artwork . Journalists tended to assess the attack in terms of a murder ( Richardson was nicknamed " Slasher Mary " ) , and used words that conjured wounds inflicted on an actual female body , rather than on a pictorial representation of a female body . The Times described a " cruel wound in the neck " , as well as incisions to the shoulders and back . 
 = Dürer 's Rhinoceros = 
 Dürer 's Rhinoceros is the name commonly given to a woodcut executed by German painter and printmaker Albrecht Dürer in 1515 . The image is based on a written description and brief sketch by an unknown artist of an Indian rhinoceros that had arrived in Lisbon in 1515 . Dürer never saw the actual rhinoceros , which was the first living example seen in Europe since Roman times . In late 1515 , the King of Portugal , Manuel I , sent the animal as a gift for Pope Leo X , but it died in a shipwreck off the coast of Italy in early 1516 . A live rhinoceros was not seen again in Europe until a second specimen , named <unk> , arrived from India at the court of Sebastian of Portugal in 1577 , being later inherited by Philip II of Spain around 1580 . 
 Dürer 's woodcut is not an entirely accurate representation of a rhinoceros . He depicts an animal with hard plates that cover its body like sheets of armour , with a gorget at the throat , a solid @-@ looking breastplate , and rivets along the seams . He places a small twisted horn on its back , and gives it scaly legs and saw @-@ like rear quarters . None of these features are present in a real rhinoceros , although the Indian rhinoceros does have deep folds in its skin that can look like armor from a distance . Despite its anatomical inaccuracies , Dürer 's woodcut became very popular in Europe and was copied many times in the following three centuries . It was regarded by Westerners as a true representation of a rhinoceros into the late 18th century . Eventually , it was supplanted by more realistic drawings and paintings , particularly those of Clara the rhinoceros , who toured Europe in the 1740s and 1750s . It has been said of Dürer 's woodcut : " probably no animal picture has exerted such a profound influence on the arts " .

 On 20 May 1515 , an Indian rhinoceros arrived in Lisbon from the Far East . In early 1514 , Afonso de Albuquerque , governor of Portuguese India , sent ambassadors to Sultan <unk> II , ruler of Cambay ( modern Gujarat ) , to seek permission to build a fort on the island of Diu . The mission returned without an agreement , but diplomatic gifts were exchanged , including the rhinoceros . At that time , the rulers of different countries would occasionally send each other exotic animals to be kept in a menagerie . The rhinoceros was already well accustomed to being kept in captivity . Albuquerque decided to forward the gift , known by its Gujarati name of ganda , and its Indian keeper , named <unk> , to King Manuel I of Portugal . It sailed on the Nossa Senhora da Ajuda , which left Goa in January 1515 . The ship , captained by Francisco Pereira Coutinho , and two companion vessels , all loaded with exotic spices , sailed across the Indian Ocean , around the Cape of Good Hope and north through the Atlantic , stopping briefly in Mozambique , Saint Helena and the Azores . 
 After a relatively fast voyage of 120 days , the rhinoceros was finally unloaded in Portugal , near the site where the Manueline Belém Tower was under construction . The tower was later decorated with gargoyles shaped as rhinoceros heads under its corbels . A rhinoceros had not been seen in Europe since Roman times : it had become something of a mythical beast , occasionally conflated in bestiaries with the " monoceros " ( unicorn ) , so the arrival of a living example created a sensation . In the context of the Renaissance , it was a piece of classical antiquity which had been rediscovered , like a statue or an inscription . 
 The animal was examined by scholars and the curious , and letters describing the fantastic creature were sent to correspondents throughout Europe . The earliest known image of the animal illustrates a <unk> by Florentine Giovanni Giacomo <unk> , published in Rome on 13 July 1515 , fewer than eight weeks after its arrival in Lisbon . The only known copy of the original published poem is held by the Institución Colombina in Seville . 
 It was housed in King Manuel 's menagerie at the Ribeira Palace in Lisbon , separate from his elephants and other large beasts at the <unk> Palace . On Trinity Sunday , 3 June , Manuel arranged a fight with young elephant from his collection , to test the account by Pliny the Elder that the elephant and the rhinoceros are bitter enemies . The rhinoceros advanced slowly and deliberately towards its foe ; the elephant , unaccustomed to the noisy crowd that turned out to witness the spectacle , fled the field in panic before a single blow was struck . 
 Manuel decided to give the rhinoceros as a gift to the Medici Pope Leo X. The King was keen to curry favour with the Pope , to maintain the papal grants of exclusive possession to the new lands that his naval forces had been exploring in the Far East since Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route to India around Africa in 1498 . The previous year , the Pope had been very pleased with Manuel 's gift of a white elephant , also from India , which the Pope had named Hanno . Together with other precious gifts of silver plate and spices , the rhinoceros , with its new collar of green velvet decorated with flowers , embarked in December 1515 for the voyage from the Tagus to Rome . The vessel passed near Marseille in early 1516 . King Francis I of France was returning from Saint @-@ Maximin @-@ la @-@ Sainte @-@ Baume in Provence , and requested a viewing of the beast . The Portuguese vessel stopped briefly at an island off Marseilles , where the rhinoceros disembarked to be beheld by the King on 24 January . 
 After resuming its journey , the ship was wrecked in a sudden storm as it passed through the narrows of Porto Venere , north of La Spezia on the coast of Liguria . The rhinoceros , chained and shackled to the deck to keep it under control , was unable to swim to safety and drowned . The carcass of the rhinoceros was recovered near Villefranche , and its hide was returned to Lisbon , where it was stuffed . Some reports say that the mounted skin was sent to Rome , arriving in February 1516 , to be exhibited <unk> ( Italian for " stuffed with straw " ) , although such a feat would have challenged 16th @-@ century methods of taxidermy , which were still primitive . If a stuffed rhinoceros did arrive in Rome , its fate remains unknown : it might have been removed to Florence by the Medici , or destroyed in the 1527 sack of Rome . In any event , there was not the popular sensation in Rome that the living beast had caused in Lisbon , although a rhinoceros was depicted in contemporary paintings in Rome by Giovanni da Udine and Raphael . 
 = = Dürer 's woodcut = = 
 <unk> Fernandes , a Moravian merchant and printer , saw the rhinoceros in Lisbon shortly after it arrived and wrote a letter describing it to a friend in Nuremberg in June 1515 . The original letter in German has not survived , but a copy in Italian is held in the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale in Florence . A second letter of unknown authorship was sent from Lisbon to Nuremberg at around the same time , enclosing a sketch by an unknown artist . Dürer – who was acquainted with the Portuguese community of the factory at Antwerp – saw the second letter and sketch in Nuremberg . He made a pen and ink drawing and printed a reversed reflection of it . 
 The German inscription on the woodcut , drawing largely from Pliny 's account , reads : 
 Dürer 's woodcut is not an accurate representation of a rhinoceros . He depicts an animal with hard plates that cover its body like sheets of armour , with a gorget at the throat , a solid @-@ looking breastplate , and rivets along the seams . He places a small twisted horn on its back , and gives it scaly legs and saw @-@ like rear quarters . None of these features is present in a real rhinoceros . It is possible that a suit of armour was forged for the rhinoceros 's fight against the elephant in Portugal , and that these features depicted by Dürer are parts of the armour . Alternatively , Dürer 's " armour " may represent the heavy folds of thick skin of an Indian rhinoceros , or , as with the other inaccuracies , may simply be misunderstandings or creative additions by Dürer . Dürer also draws a scaly texture over the body of the animal , including the " armour " . This may be Dürer 's attempt to reflect the rough and almost hairless hide of the Indian rhinoceros , which has wart @-@ like bumps covering its upper legs and shoulders . On the other hand , his depiction of the texture may represent dermatitis induced by the rhinoceros ' close confinement during the four @-@ month journey by ship from India to Portugal . 
 A second woodcut was executed by Hans Burgkmair in Augsburg around the same time as Dürer 's in Nuremberg . Burgkmair corresponded with merchants in Lisbon and Nuremberg , but it is not clear whether he had access to a letter or sketch as Dürer did , perhaps even Dürer 's sources , or saw the animal himself in Portugal . His image is truer to life , omitting Dürer 's more fanciful additions and including the shackles and chain used to restrain the rhinoceros ; however , Dürer 's woodcut is more powerful and eclipsed Burgkmair 's in popularity . Only one impression ( example ) of Burgkmair 's image has survived , whereas Dürer 's print survives in many impressions . Dürer produced a first edition of his woodcut in 1515 , in the first state , which is distinguished by only five lines of text in the heading . Many further printings followed after Dürer 's death in 1528 , including two in the 1540s , and two more in the late 16th century . Later printings have six lines of descriptive text . 
 The block passed into the hands of the Amsterdam printer and cartographer Willem Janssen ( also called Willem Blaeu amongst other names ) . By this time the block was very damaged ; the border lines were chipped , there were numerous woodworm holes and a pronounced crack had developed through the rhino 's legs . Janssen decided to re @-@ issue the block with the addition of a new tone block printed in a variety of colours , olive @-@ green and dark green , as well as blue @-@ grey . The resulting chiaroscuro woodcut , which entirely omitted the text , was published after 1620 . There is an example in the British Museum . This was the seventh of the eight editions in all of the print . 
 Despite its errors , the image remained very popular , and was taken to be an accurate representation of a rhinoceros until the late 18th century . Dürer may have anticipated this and deliberately chosen to create a woodcut , rather than a more refined and detailed engraving , as this was cheaper to produce and more copies could be printed . Images derived from it were included in naturalist texts , including Sebastian Münster 's Cosmographiae ( 1544 ) , Conrad Gessner 's Historiae Animalium ( 1551 ) , Edward Topsell 's Histoire of Foure @-@ footed <unk> ( 1607 ) and many others . A rhinoceros that was clearly based on Dürer 's woodcut was chosen by Alessandro de ' Medici as his emblem in June 1536 , with the motto " Non <unk> sin <unk> " ( old Spanish for " I shall not return without victory " ) . A sculpture of a rhinoceros based on Dürer 's image was placed at the base of a 70 @-@ foot ( 21 m ) high obelisk designed by Jean Goujon and erected in front of the Church of the Sepulchre in the rue Saint @-@ Denis in Paris in 1549 for the royal entry welcoming the arrival of the new King of France , Henry II . A similar rhinoceros , in relief , decorates a panel in one of the bronze west doors of Pisa Cathedral . The rhinoceros was depicted in numerous other paintings and sculptures , and became a popular decoration for porcelain . The popularity of the inaccurate Dürer image remained undiminished despite an Indian rhinoceros spending eight years in Madrid from 1580 to 1588 ( although a few examples of a print of the Madrid rhinoceros sketched by Philippe Galle in Antwerp in 1586 , and derivative works , have survived ) , and the exhibition of a live rhinoceros in London a century later , from 1684 – 86 , and of a second individual after 1739 . 
 The pre @-@ eminent position of Dürer 's image and its derivatives declined from the mid @-@ to @-@ late @-@ 18th century , when more live rhinoceroses were transported to Europe , shown to the curious public , and depicted in more accurate representations . Jean @-@ Baptiste Oudry painted a life @-@ size portrait of Clara the rhinoceros in 1749 , and George Stubbs painted a large portrait of a rhinoceros in London around 1790 . Both of these paintings were more accurate than Dürer 's woodcut , and a more realistic conception of the rhinoceros gradually started to displace Dürer 's image in the public imagination . In particular , Oudry 's painting was the inspiration for a plate in Buffon 's encyclopedic Histoire naturelle , which was widely copied . In 1790 , James Bruce 's travelogue Travels to discover the source of the Nile dismissed Dürer 's work as " wonderfully ill @-@ executed in all its parts " and " the origin of all the monstrous forms under which that animal has been painted , ever since " . Even so , Bruce 's own illustration of the African white rhinoceros , which is noticeably different in appearance to the Indian rhinoceros , still shares conspicuous inaccuracies with Dürer 's work . <unk> Umberto Eco argues that Dürer 's " scales and imbricated plates " became a necessary element of depicting the animal , even to those who might know better , because " they knew that only these conventionalized graphic signs could denote « rhinoceros » to the person interpreting the iconic sign . " He also notes that the skin of a rhinoceros is rougher than it visually appears and that such plates and scales portray this non @-@ visual information to a degree . 
 Until the late 1930s , Dürer 's image appeared in school textbooks in Germany as a faithful image of the rhinoceros ; and it remains a powerful artistic influence . It was one of the inspirations for Salvador Dalí ; a reproduction of the woodcut hung in his childhood home and he used the image in several of his works .

 King 's Highway 130 , commonly known as Highway 130 , is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario . It begins at a junction with Highway 61 and travels 15 @.@ 4 km ( 9 @.@ 6 mi ) north @-@ west to the Trans @-@ Canada Highway , Highway 11 and Highway 17 , west of Thunder Bay . Highway 130 is a short connecting highway , and passes entirely through the outskirts of Thunder Bay , connecting several minor communities and providing a shortcut for traffic travelling from the south to the west or vice versa . The speed limit along the highway is 80 km / h ( 50 mph ) ; it is patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police . 
 Highway 130 has retained most of its current route since the mid @-@ 1970s , but was longer prior to then , when it extended north of Arthur Street to Oliver Road and then along that road into downtown Thunder Bay , ending at what is now Water Street . The route was originally designated in late 1955 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Highway 130 is situated in the municipality of Oliver Paipoonge , in Thunder Bay District . The short route serves to connect Highway 61 with Highways 11 and 17 west of Thunder Bay , a distance of 15 @.@ 4 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 6 mi ) . 
 Beginning at Highway 61 in the south , the route proceeds straight north along a concession road midway between Monteith Road to the west and Hanna Road to the east . Surrounded almost entirely by farmland , the highway encounters McCluskey Drive one kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) along its route and Candy Mountain Drive two kilometres north of that . At the latter is the small community of Slate River Valley , though relatively few residences are located on the highway . At Barrie Drive , two kilometres north of the community , the highway turns east ; a channelized right turn lane is provided for northbound traffic while southbound traffic is given the right of way at the intersection . The highway travels east to Hanna Road where it turns north ; this junction features a channelized lane for southbound traffic while giving northbound traffic the right of way at the intersection . 
 Now surrounded by residences to the west and a farm to the west , the highway travels north a short distance before curving to the southeast to cross the <unk> River . Gradually curving back to the north , the route features residences to the south and woodland to the north . It enters the community of Twin City , acting as the main street and intersecting Rosslyn Road immediately north of a Canadian National Railway crossing and the Paipoonge Museum . At Arthur Street , the highway turns west until it ends at Highway 11 and Highway 17 .

 Highway 130 was first designated in late 1955 and early 1956 . At that time the route ended in the midst of McIntyre Township ; it began at Algoma Road ( now Water Street ) , then the route of Highway 17 , and followed John Street and Oliver Road . The Department of Highways assumed the portion within McIntyre Township on December 7 , 1955 . Three months later , the route was extended south to Highway 61 when the department assumed the section in Paipoonge Township on March 7 , 1956 . 
 This route remained in place until the mid @-@ 1970s , when Highway 130 was decommissioned north of Arthur Street ; the section within the newly formed City of Thunder Bay was transferred to the city on October 1 , 1970 , while the section within McIntyre Township remained until at least 1973 . On August 17 , 2007 , the highway was extended by 2 km ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) when Highway 11 and Highway 17 , which until then travelled along Arthur Street , were transferred onto the <unk> Bypass to the north . As a result , Highway 130 was extended west along Arthur Street to its current terminus at the bypass .

 No. 91 ( Composite ) Wing was a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) wing that operated during the Korean War and its immediate aftermath . It was established in October 1950 to administer RAAF units deployed in the conflict : No. 77 ( Fighter ) Squadron , flying North American P @-@ 51 Mustangs ; No. 30 Communications Flight , flying Austers and Douglas C @-@ 47 Dakotas ; No. 391 ( Base ) Squadron ; and No. 491 ( Maintenance ) Squadron . The wing was headquartered at Iwakuni , Japan , as were its subordinate units with the exception of No. 77 Squadron , which was based in Korea and came under the operational control of the United States Fifth Air Force . 
 No. 30 Communications Flight was re @-@ designated No. 30 Communications Unit in November 1950 , and No. 30 Transport Unit a year later , before re @-@ forming as No. 36 ( Transport ) Squadron in March 1953 . It undertook medical evacuation , cargo and troop transport , and courier flights . No. 77 Squadron converted to Gloster Meteor jets between April and July 1951 , and operated primarily in the ground attack role from December that year . It remained in Korea on garrison duty following the July 1953 armistice , and returned to Australia in November 1954 ; No. 491 Squadron disbanded the same month . No. 36 Squadron returned to Australia in March 1955 , leaving four aircraft to equip the newly formed RAAF Transport Flight ( Japan ) , which briefly came under No. 91 Wing 's control . The following month , No. 391 Squadron and No. 91 Wing headquarters were disbanded .

 When the Korean War broke out on 25 June 1950 , No. 77 ( Fighter ) Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) was based at Iwakuni , Japan . For the previous four years , equipped mainly with North American P @-@ 51 Mustangs , it had served with the British Commonwealth Air Group , the air component of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) , initially as part of No. 81 Wing RAAF . No. 81 Wing was disbanded in November 1948 , leaving No. 77 Squadron as Australia 's sole air unit in Japan . It was now the largest squadron in the RAAF , comprising 299 officers and men , forty Mustangs , three CAC Wirraways , two Douglas C @-@ 47 Dakotas and two Austers . The squadron was preparing to return to Australia when it was placed on standby for action over Korea ; it began flying missions as part of the United Nations ( UN ) peacekeeping force a week later . No. 77 Squadron 's commanding officer , Wing Commander Lou Spence , was killed in action on 9 September 1950 , and Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth , Chief of Staff at BCOF , temporarily took charge at Iwakuni , pending the formation of an overarching organisation for support and administration at the base . Squadron Leader Dick Cresswell arrived on 17 September to assume command of No. 77 Squadron . 
 Following the landing at Inchon and the northward advance of UN troops , No. 77 Squadron relocated to Pohang , South Korea , on 12 October 1950 . It left behind its main support elements at Iwakuni . No. 91 ( Composite ) Wing was established at the base on 20 October . The term " composite " referred to an RAAF formation made up of disparate operational elements , rather than one comprising a single type such as bombers or fighters . Commanded by Group Captain A.D. ( Dallas ) Charlton , No. 91 Wing was given administrative responsibility for all RAAF units operating during the Korean War . As well as No. 77 Squadron , this included the newly formed No. 391 ( Base ) Squadron and No. 491 ( Maintenance ) Squadron , and No. 30 Communications Flight , formerly the No. 77 Squadron Communications Flight and initially comprising its two Dakotas and two Austers . Apart from No. 77 Squadron , the wing 's units were all headquartered at Iwakuni . Elements of the US Far East Air Forces command favoured the establishment of a British Commonwealth Wing , to include No. 77 Squadron and the Mustang @-@ equipped No. 2 Squadron of the South African Air Force , then en route to Korea , but the South African government vetoed the idea . 
 = = = Operations = = = 
 No. 77 Squadron 's tasking was controlled by the United States Fifth Air Force from the time it commenced operations in Korea , and this arrangement was not affected by the formation of No. 91 Wing . It moved forward from Pohang to Yonpo , near Hamhung , in November 1950 , continuing its support of UN forces as they advanced up the peninsula . North Korea 's counter @-@ attack , augmented by Chinese forces , led to the squadron being hurriedly withdrawn to Pusan on 3 December . Poor radio communications with No. 91 Wing dogged the evacuation from Yonpo , which was effected through US Air Force support supplementing the efforts of RAAF Dakotas . Cresswell believed that the Iwakuni @-@ based wing headquarters was not always in tune with frontline requirements , and he often dealt directly with Lieutenant General Sir Horace Robertson , BCOF commander and the theatre 's senior Australian officer , and the RAAF 's Deputy Chief of the Air Staff , Air Vice Marshal Frederick Scherger . 
 In response to the threat of Chinese Mikoyan @-@ Gurevich MiG @-@ 15 jet fighters , No. 77 Squadron was withdrawn to Iwakuni in April 1951 , to re @-@ equip with Gloster Meteors . Four Royal Air Force officers with Meteor experience were seconded to No. 91 Wing to assist with training . The squadron returned to action with its new aircraft on 29 July , operating out of Kimpo , South Korea . The Mustangs had been highly effective in close support , but No. 77 Squadron 's main role in the RAAF was interception , and it was expected that with the Meteor it could again focus on fighter duties . According to the official history of Australia in the Korean War , the unit proved its value diplomatically as well as operationally : having been one of the first UN squadrons to go into action , it comprised one @-@ third of the jet fighter force in the latter part of 1951 , when clashes in " MiG Alley " were at their height . However , dogfights between Meteors and MiGs that August convinced the new commanding officer , Wing Commander Gordon Steege , that the Australian jets were outmatched , and Fifth Air Force agreed to take them out of an offensive air @-@ to @-@ air combat role in favour of escort and local air defence . The squadron 's loss rate by the end of the year was one in four killed or captured . 
 Beginning in December 1951 under Steege 's replacement , Wing Commander Ron Susans , No. 77 Squadron again took up an offensive role , namely ground attack , which constituted its primary tasking for the rest of the war . Flight Lieutenant J.C. Smith , No. 91 Wing 's armament officer , played a key role in developing " Flaming Onion " , napalm @-@ tipped air @-@ to @-@ ground rockets that were used in several operations in 1952 and 1953 . No. 77 Squadron remained in Korea on garrison duty — initially at Kimpo , later at Kunsan — following the armistice in July 1953 . It had lost forty @-@ one pilots killed during the war . A further seven pilots became prisoners of war . Aircraft losses totalled almost sixty , including over forty Meteors , mostly to ground fire . The squadron flew 18 @,@ 872 sorties , including 3 @,@ 872 in Mustangs and 15 @,@ 000 in Meteors . It was credited with shooting down five MiG @-@ 15s and destroying 3 @,@ 700 buildings , 1 @,@ 408 vehicles , ninety @-@ eight locomotives and carriages , and sixteen bridges . 
 No. 30 Communications Flight included Robertson 's personal Dakota , operating under his direction . The unit 's complement of two Dakotas and two Austers was soon augmented by two more Dakotas from Australia . On 1 November 1950 , No. 30 Communications Flight was renamed No. 30 Communications Unit . The same month , it received another four Dakotas from No. 38 Squadron , of No. 90 ( Composite ) Wing in Malaya , giving it a strength of eight Dakotas and two Austers . The unit supported all Australian forces in Korea . One of its key functions was medical evacuation , but it was also responsible for supply drops , search and rescue , reconnaissance , and mail delivery , as well as transporting cargo , troops , and VIPs . Unlike No. 77 Squadron , it was not tasked by Fifth Air Force but instead operated under Australian control , which was exercised through BCOF headquarters in Japan . No. 30 Communications Unit was re @-@ formed as No. 30 Transport Unit on 5 November 1951 , and as No. 36 ( Transport ) Squadron on 10 March 1953 . During the war it transported around 100 @,@ 000 passengers and over 6 @,@ 000 tons of cargo . No. 91 Wing 's records listed 12 @,@ 762 medical evacuations from Korea to Japan , and over 2 @,@ 000 from Japan to Australia or Britain . The transportation unit lost an Auster and a Wirraway to crashes , resulting in four deaths .

 When the Korean War broke out , No. 77 Squadron was self @-@ supporting . The added burden of combat operations made this situation untenable after the squadron went into action in Korea , leading to the formation of No. 391 ( Base ) Squadron at Iwakuni , at the same time as No. 91 Wing headquarters . RAAF base squadrons were responsible for administrative , logistical , medical , communications and security functions . Staffed mainly by former No. 77 Squadron members , in the first year of its existence No. 391 Squadron had to contend with severe shortages of winter clothing and equipment . Further problems arose following the introduction of the Meteor , as spares for the British @-@ made jet were harder to obtain than for the American Mustang . Along with its RAAF responsibilities , No. 391 Squadron supported Australian Army and other UN personnel travelling through Iwakuni . It ran No. 91 Wing 's " Transit Hotel " , which accommodated business people and entertainers , as well as military personnel . The squadron 's medical contingent was heavily engaged in the preparation and escort of injured personnel from Korea to Iwakuni and then to other destinations . 
 No. 491 Squadron was also formed in tandem with No. 91 Wing on 20 October 1950 . Headquartered at Iwakuni , it was responsible for all maintenance of the wing 's aircraft except day @-@ to @-@ day servicing . A section was attached to No. 77 Squadron in Korea to assist ground staff with daily maintenance . Personnel from Iwakuni were regularly rotated through this section , and augmented by additional No. 491 Squadron staff as needed for repair or salvage work . The standard RAAF working days for technicians at Iwakuni contrasted with shifts of up to sixteen hours near the front line in Korea . Korea was one of the coldest climates in which RAAF ground crews had ever worked ; Squadron Leader Cresswell recalled seeing maintenance staff with tools frozen to their hands . Both Nos. 391 and 491 Squadrons used Japanese technicians as well as Australian , which was unusual for the time ; during the occupation of Japan following its surrender in World War II , the RAAF had only employed Japanese workers for menial tasks .

 No. 77 Squadron stood down at Kunsan on 7 October 1954 and flew its Meteors to Iwakuni five days later . It departed for Australia in November and became operational again at RAAF Base Williamtown , New South Wales , on 4 January 1955 . Its eleven @-@ year absence from Australia , beginning in the Pacific during World War II and continuing in Japan as part of BCOF , was a record for an RAAF unit . No. 491 Squadron disbanded at Iwakuni on 13 December 1954 . No. 36 Squadron ceased flying on 13 March 1955 and returned to Australia , leaving behind three Dakotas and a Wirraway that equipped RAAF Transport Flight ( Japan ) , formed the following day under No. 91 Wing . No. 391 Squadron and No. 91 Wing headquarters were disbanded at Iwakuni on 30 April 1955 . Transport Flight ( Japan ) flew a courier service to South Korea and remained operational until 8 July 1956 , when its last Dakota — the last RAAF aircraft in Japan — departed <unk> .

 Banjo @-@ Kazooie : Nuts & Bolts is an action @-@ adventure video game developed by Rare and published by Microsoft Game Studios . The third instalment of the Banjo @-@ Kazooie series , it was released for the Xbox 360 worldwide in November 2008 . The game takes place eight years after the events of Banjo @-@ Tooie , and marks the return of series antagonist Gruntilda , who plans to take over Spiral Mountain . In order to defeat Gruntilda , series protagonists Banjo and Kazooie must compete in a set of vehicle @-@ based challenges . 
 The game revolves around vehicle construction , in which the player must design their own vehicles ranging from automobiles , motorbikes , boats and aeroplanes . Gameplay itself is centred on completing a series of challenges depending on the specific vehicle , although some parts of the game retain platforming traits . Development of the game first began as a remake of the original Banjo @-@ Kazooie , although a game which involved " more traditional platforming " was conceptualised . Eventually , the project evolved into a construction @-@ orientated game which was inspired by connecting Lego blocks . 
 Banjo @-@ Kazooie : Nuts & Bolts received mixed reviews upon release . Critics were largely divided over the concept of vehicle @-@ orientated gameplay , however some critics praised its mechanics and innovation . The game sold a total of 140 @,@ 000 units by the end of 2008 in the United States . The game has also achieved " Platinum Hits " status , which means it sold at least 400 @,@ 000 units during its first nine months of release . In 2010 , the game was included as one of the titles in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die . The game is also included in the Rare Replay retrospective compilation , released for the Xbox One in 2015 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Banjo @-@ Kazooie : Nuts & Bolts primarily revolves around vehicle construction , in which the player must construct their own vehicles after collecting specific vehicle parts . In contrast to its predecessors , there are no conventional " moves " for Banjo and Kazooie to use , apart from melee attacks Kazooie performs with her spanner . The game 's hub world is Showdown Town , which contains various portals that lead to six worlds . Each world contains three levels , one boss level , and a series of various challenges , although exploration of these worlds are optional . The key part of the game is to earn " Jiggies " in order to unlock new worlds , and accumulate enough Jiggies to unlock the final world , which contains the final boss . 
 The centre of Showdown Town houses <unk> 's factory , which dispenses " game globes " whenever a certain Jiggy total is reached . Placing the globes onto special stands unlocks the game 's levels . Each level features a set of challenges , which vary from races , combat and objectives such as <unk> jumping . The game also features vehicular @-@ combat ; players may equip weapons onto their vehicles to use against opposing vehicles . Players who surpass a challenge 's best score will be rewarded with a Trophy ; collecting four trophies will earn them an additional Jiggy from Trophy Thomas . Each Jiggy extracted from the levels appears in " Jig @-@ o @-@ Vend " collection units scattered in crates around Showdown Town . The player must vend the Jiggies and physically carry them over to the central " Jiggy Bank " device to affect the total of Jiggies . Showdown Town also houses Mumbo 's Motors , a workshop where the player may create and design their own vehicles . 
 Vehicles play a prominent role in the game , replacing the moves and transformations featured in its predecessors . The vehicles can be built freely by the player from over 1600 different components available , such as body panels , engines , wheels , wings , propellers , fuel tanks and weapons . Vehicles range from automobiles , motorbikes , boats and aeroplanes . In order to create vehicles , the player must collect vehicle parts and <unk> which are scattered throughout the hub world , or can be earned after winning specific challenges . The player may also purchase preset blueprints and vehicle parts from <unk> Wumba in Showdown Town . In addition , players can also send and receive blueprints over Xbox Live . 
 The game retains some platforming traits ; the player may disembark from a vehicle and explore the environment in a manner similar to that of the previous games . On foot the duo can grab ledges , swim underwater , balance on <unk> and perform basic jumps . Kazooie 's spanner can also be used as a melee weapon outside of the vehicle , in addition to levitating lopsided vehicles . Banjo and Kazooie have limited attack power and agility on foot at first , but the duo can upgrade their speed , stamina and strength by visiting Boggy 's gym in the game 's hub world . Scattered around the game 's six worlds are musical notes , which serve as currency for the player to purchase certain items such as blueprints , parts , and access to advanced vehicles . Musical notes vary in value as determined by its colour ; gold , silver or bronze . Banjo @-@ Kazooie : Nuts & Bolts also features an online multiplayer ; players can compete in challenges such as races and combat over Xbox Live . In addition , players can share their own vehicle designs and blueprints online . 
 Banjo @-@ Kazooie : Nuts and Bolts features bonus content unlocked through the use of " Stop ' N ' Swop " , a feature first introduced in the original Banjo @-@ Kazooie . By collecting the six Mystery Eggs and Ice Key in the Xbox Live Arcade re @-@ release of Banjo @-@ Kazooie , players will be able to find special vehicle part crates in Nuts & Bolts ' overworld , which can be used to unlock novelty vehicle parts , such as a disco ball or fuzzy dice . By using the Stop ' N ' Swop items in the XBLA version of Banjo @-@ Tooie as well , players who purchase the " L.O.G. ' s Lost Challenges " DLC gain access to seven additional vehicle blueprints created by fans who won a blueprint design contest held by Rare . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The game takes place eight years following the conclusion of Banjo @-@ Tooie , in which Gruntilda 's body was destroyed and vapourised by Banjo and Kazooie . The two have become obese since their last adventure , and have since spent eight years overeating , playing video games and listening to the radio . They soon discover Gruntilda 's detached head returning to their home , Spiral Mountain , who is planning revenge on Banjo and Kazooie . They are about to fight when they are stopped by the sudden appearance of the Lord of Games ( L.O.G. ) , the creator of all video games . He decides to settle the conflict between the two by devising a series of worlds and challenges . He uses his powers to give Gruntilda an artificial body and to restore the duo 's physical fitness , but not their moves from previous games , claiming that they will not need them . 
 L.O.G. transports the characters to Showdown Town , his headquarters , and starts the contest . The winner would be set to own Spiral Mountain ; the loser must endure eternal hardship at L.O.G. ' s video game factory . While Banjo and Kazooie seek to win by completing the challenges , Gruntilda uses her powers and abilities to try to stop the duo , with a cat named <unk> and an army of mechanical robots assisting the witch in her goal . The game ends with Gruntilda and Banjo participating in a final duel in Spiral Mountain . Banjo and Kazooie destroy all of Gruntilda 's vehicles and prepare to fight back as she gets back up , but L.O.G. returns and declares Banjo the winner . After L.O.G. sends Gruntilda off to work at his video game factory , he rewards Banjo and Kazooie by giving them the deeds to Spiral Mountain and restoring their moves , while Banjo 's friends reveal that they have restored his house after its destruction in Banjo @-@ Tooie . Meanwhile , Gruntilda declares that bringing her to the factory was a mistake and vows that she will make her own video game . 
 = = Development = = 
 According to designer Gregg Mayles , the first idea was to create a remake of the first Banjo @-@ Kazooie for the Xbox 360 , and the team 's second choice was to involve " more traditional platforming " , however they felt that the latter was a " stale " approach and deemed the former too similar to previous titles to have an impact . Ed Bryan revealed that the next idea the team wanted to conceive was a game " where you could build stuff " . Initially , Rare co @-@ founder Tim Stamper suggested that game revolve around an " interactive lego set " ; the team designed a prototype sandbox which involved the player putting blocks together to create vehicles . According to designer Steve <unk> , the prototype was set in the first level of the cancelled Banjo @-@ Kazooie remake , and the most difficult part of initial designing stages was creating a user interface for players to design vehicles with . Furthermore , Mayles stated that understanding how to construct vehicle parts in a three @-@ dimensional space was exceptionally difficult , and making the vehicles playable was a " colossal challenge " . While the game was in early development , Mayles hinted at the new direction : 
 On 17 October 2007 , designer Justin Cook revealed in an interview with PC Zone that the then @-@ untitled project was in designing stages , with the entire core team from the original Banjo @-@ Kazooie giving it full @-@ time attention . During development , Mayles asserted that getting the in @-@ game editor powerful enough to ensure that players could build " what they liked " . For re @-@ designing the characters of Banjo and Kazooie , Mayles and Bryan were tasked with finding a suitable way to update the two characters . Initially , they designed high @-@ resolution characters for the protagonists , however Bryan recalled that they lacked " the charm " the original game held . Later during development , Bryan suggested that the characters in the game should appear cuboid , and thus finalised the designs with smooth edges , whilst retaining the two character 's original appearances . Due to the game revolving around the theme of construction , the team went to lengths to ensure that the game 's aesthetics look like " everything was constructed " with patchwork , to give the illusion that " everything was patched together " . Mayles stated that all of the voice @-@ work from the characters were performed in @-@ house by Rare staff ; Banjo @-@ Kazooie lead programmer Chris Sutherland reprised his role of voicing Banjo and Kazooie .

 The music was composed by Robin Beanland , Grant Kirkhope and Dave <unk> . Banjo @-@ Kazooie : Nuts & Bolts was the final game worked on by Kirkhope , a Rare employee since 1995 . The soundtrack is orchestrated and features both remastered arrangements of existing music from the series , and new pieces entirely . The music was performed by The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra . On 29 June 2009 , Rare announced that the game 's soundtrack would be released and available to purchase on Amazon and iTunes . The soundtrack was released by the label Sumthing Else .

 A downloadable add @-@ on for Nuts & Bolts , titled " L.O.G. ' s Lost Challenges " , was released on 7 April 2009 . The content is set in the " Test @-@ o @-@ Track " area of Mumbo 's Motors , and includes six new missions with twelve additional Jiggies to earn : six for completing the missions with pre @-@ determined vehicles , and six for completing the missions with vehicles designed by the player . Collecting all twelve Jiggies will unlock " Hero Klungo <unk> Teh <unk> " , a set of new levels for the " Hero Klungo <unk> Teh World " minigame . The add @-@ on also includes seven new multiplayer game types . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The game received a mixed reception from the community for not featuring certain key elements found in previous games . According to Rare , the early reception was " expected " . The game received mostly positive reviews from critics upon release . It holds an average score of 79 / 100 at Metacritic , based on an aggregate of 71 reviews . The vehicular @-@ based mechanics of the game were met with scepticism from many reviewers . Tom Bradwell of Eurogamer criticised the overall design of vehicles and the lack of traditional platforming as " unfair " , alongside citing a " weak mission design " . Ben Reeves of Game Informer stated that the mission structure was a " mixed bag " , asserting that racing was largely repetitive and " derivative " . Tom McShea of GameSpot praised the variety of the mission structure and vehicle building , stating that each " problem " requires creative thinking and innovation . However , McShea criticised the controls and physics of some of the vehicles , thus adding difficulty to the overall experience . Sterling McGarvey of GameSpy called Rare 's decision to " move the emphasis away from platforming " and toward creation as bold , however he criticised the game 's mechanics and manoeuvrability of land @-@ based vehicles , although he noted that aeroplanes and helicopters were easy to utilise . McGarvey furthermore criticised the manoeuvrability of vehicles , stating that it was overall frustrating on how much the game relied on the awkward mechanics . 
 Brad Shoemaker of Giant Bomb praised the driving mechanics and vehicle construction , despite initially being frustrated with the game 's controls . Shoemaker praised the innovation the game offered ; stating that the vehicle @-@ building and enormous variety of mission types would attract all audiences . A reviewer of GamesRadar heavily criticised the overall mechanics and vehicular gameplay , stating that it was both " ridiculously complicated " and unsuitable for a Banjo game . The reviewer of GamesRadar also criticised Rare 's " old habit " of " collect @-@ a @-@ <unk> " , asserting that all the elements of the game were " clumsily put together " and the aspects of unlocking new levels were difficult to understand due to the many items that were pre @-@ required . Andrew Reiner of Game Informer heralded the vehicle construction as " fun " , however he criticised Rare 's " habit of forcing the player " to collect large quantities of items to build their vehicles and progress through the game . A reviewer of GameTrailers similarly criticised the vehicular theme of the game , citing that the sensitive physics and controls adds up to an overall frustrating experience . Erik Brudvig of IGN US praised the game 's absence of platform elements , and asked fans of Banjo @-@ Kazooie not to " write the game off " due to its change in genre . Brudvig also heralded the vehicle @-@ creation as " powerful " and the depth of the game 's mechanics . However , Matt Wales of IGN UK criticised the new direction of the game 's genre , summarising the lack of platforming action as " screwed up " . Wales stated that the game 's mechanics and vehicle construction " fails badly " due to the lack of " any fundamentally engaging " framework to support the game 's creative elements . Tom Orry of <unk> praised the complex construction of vehicles and stated that it was the most rewarding aspect of the game . Chris Kohler of Wired heavily criticised the mechanics , challenges and new genre of the game , panning the overall experience as a " disappointing , simplistic sandbox " . Kohler also added that the racing missions were " boring " and frustrating , similarly stating the same for vehicle customisation . In a retrospective review , David Roberts of GamesRadar stated that Nuts & Bolts " laid down groundwork " for future games that revolve around construction , such as Fallout 4 and <unk> Space Program . 
 Banjo @-@ Kazooie : Nuts & Bolts sold a total of 140 @,@ 000 units by the end of 2008 in the United States . The game has also achieved " Platinum Hits " status , which means it sold at least 400 @,@ 000 units during its first nine months of release . The game also surpassed 100 @,@ 000 units in the United Kingdom . In 2010 , the game was included as one of the titles in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die . 
 = Thunder ( mascot ) = 
 Thunder is the stage name for the horse who is the official live animal mascot for the Denver Broncos football team . Three purebred Arabians have held this role since 1993 , all gray horses whose coats lightened with age until they turned completely white . Sharon Magness @-@ Blake has owned all three horses , and Ann Judge has been their rider since 1998 and trainer since 1999 . As of 2016 , Thunder has appeared in four Super Bowls with the team since 1998 . The original Thunder performed in Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII and Thunder III appeared in Super Bowl XLVIII and Super Bowl 50 . Thunder III also made appearances in Times Square and on television morning news shows in New York City as part of the pre @-@ game promotion for Super Bowl XLVII . He routinely appears in parades , makes hospital and school visits , and attends various other public functions . He has been flown on airplanes , ridden in elevators , and appeared indoors at press conferences and banquets . 
 Thunder 's duties as mascot typically include leading the team onto the field at the start of every home game , and a gallop down the length of the field whenever the team scores a touchdown or field goal . Thunder and his rider also interact with fans before the game ; the horse is particularly popular with children , who are allowed to pet him . The horses who have served as Thunder need to remain calm in situations that would normally frighten most horses , such as being in football stadiums with thousands of cheering fans , exploding pyrotechnics , cheerleaders waving pom @-@ poms , and other spectacles common to National Football League ( NFL ) games . Thunder shares mascot duties with Miles , a human who wears a horse head mask atop a Broncos uniform . 
 The original Thunder , later named " Thunder , Sr. " , was described as bold and courageous . He was a stallion registered as JB Kobask , a former show horse , who was team mascot for the Broncos from 1993 until his retirement in 2004 . He continued making community appearances until his death in 2009 . Thunder , Sr. was succeeded in 2004 by " Thunder II " , an Arabian gelding registered as Winter Solstyce . He had been the personal pleasure riding horse of Magness @-@ Blake . Judge described him as being somewhat timid when he first began his role as mascot but eventually grew into it . He retired from mascot duties in early 2014 but appeared in the 2016 Super Bowl 50 victory parade in downtown Denver following the Broncos win over the Carolina Panthers . " Thunder III " , a gelding registered as Me N Myshadow , was the understudy to Thunder II , and trained specifically for mascot duties beginning at age three when he was started under saddle . He began performing at preseason games in 2013 . Although Thunder II was still active as team mascot during the 2013 – 14 season , Thunder III was sent to Super Bowl XLVIII because he was younger and better able to handle air travel . He is described as laid @-@ back , preferring to doze off during games when not performing . 
 = = History = = 
 The original " Thunder " , JB Kobask , was loaned to the Denver Broncos by Sharon Magness @-@ Blake of Magness Arabians after she received a phone call from team officials asking if she had a " white " horse . Thunder 's debut as team mascot was on September 12 , 1993 during the Denver Broncos ' victory over the San Diego Chargers . Angela Moore , his rider at the time , galloped him down the field after each Bronco touchdown . Thunder 's mascot duties were expanded to include delivering the game ball to the referees at the start of each home game . Spectators were allowed to interact with Thunder and pet him prior to the game . Magness said , " Thunder is friendly , and Broncos fans think it 's good luck for the opposing team to pet our mascot " . He was particularly popular with children , appeared on T @-@ shirts , and was referred to as the " second most popular Bronco " after former quarterback John Elway . Thunder appeared at Elway 's 1999 retirement gala . When team uniforms were redesigned in 1997 , Thunder was the inspiration to incorporate a horse @-@ head profile as part of the logo on the team 's helmets . During a February 4 , 1997 press conference introducing the new logo , the team president and the art director for Nike , creators of the new design , described it as " a powerful horse with a fiery eye and mane . " 
 The original Thunder , also known as Thunder , Sr. , was retired in 2004 after serving 11 years as the team mascot . Magness @-@ Blake replaced him with Thunder II , a 1994 Arabian gelding registered as Winter Solstyce . He was Magness @-@ Blake 's personal pleasure riding horse prior to taking on his new role as team mascot . As Thunder II grew older , Magness @-@ Blake anticipated the need for a replacement and added a third gray horse to the team . He became known as Thunder III , a 2000 Arabian gelding registered as Me N Myshadow . Thunder III initially served as the understudy for Thunder II , and was trained specifically for the role of team mascot from his start under saddle .

 Thunder leads the team onto the field at the beginning of each home game , and typically gallops from one end of the field to the other whenever the team makes a touchdown . He may also make a run after a field goal , but not a safety . Each time he makes a run , a four @-@ person crew runs down the sidelines to the end zone to escort Thunder back to his sideline position . Extra handlers ensure the safety of the horse and surrounding people . Thunder 's helpers also remove any manure that he might drop while on the field . As well as his support crew , Thunder has a bodyguard who travels to the games . Thunder shares mascot duties with Miles , a human who wears a horse head mask atop a Broncos uniform . 
 The horses who have served as Thunder have been trained to remain calm in situations that would normally cause a horse to respond with a fight @-@ or @-@ flight response , such as the flashing explosions of a pyrotechnic display , or items suddenly landing on the field including skydivers with parachutes and various objects thrown by spectators , or loud music and the sounds associated with tens of thousands of cheering fans at Mile High . Ann Judge has explained that because so many unexpected things can happen , it is important that the people working with him remain calm ; it is trust in his rider and handlers , not just desensitization , that helps the horse remain steady : " You want them to look to you for the appropriate response and for confidence and faith so that the flight response doesn ’ t get initiated . " She describes the process by saying , " if something is fearful to him , as long as he looks to me , and I tell him he ’ s OK , he ’ s OK . " The only frightening stimuli that was an ongoing problem for both Thunder Sr. and Thunder II was when the crowd would perform the wave ; Thunder Sr. would stand still , but tremble . Thunder II would become tense , requiring ground handlers and his rider to help steady him . Thunder III is the first of the mascots to tolerate wearing earplugs , which help protect his hearing from loud noises during games . 
 Magness @-@ Blake said one of the most dangerous parts of Thunder 's job is at the beginning of the game when he leads the team onto the field , as there are cheerleaders ahead of him waving their pom @-@ poms and a team of excited football players behind him . Ann Judge has also remarked about the team getting " amped up " with energy and excitement as Thunder leads them onto the field , explaining that " To him , amped up means danger . " On one occasion , a person walked out unexpectedly in front of Thunder as he was leading the players onto the field . Thunder stopped immediately , averting a potentially dangerous situation . Another unexpected event occurred in 2014 during Super Bowl XLVIII when the pyrotechnics display was supposed to have been executed before Thunder led the team out but it went off unexpectedly during his run . Thunder responded to the situation with aplomb , continuing to run forward onto the field , though he performed flying lead changes with each explosion . 
 Thunder 's record number of runs may have been during a 52 – 20 win on September 29 , 2013 , when he crossed the field eight times . Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning joked , " Might have to give ol ' Thunder an I.V. after this one . " Judge said Thunder , age 19 at the time , was not tired at all , describing him as " full of spit and vinegar " the next day . 
 Thunder appears primarily at home games , but has been transported out @-@ of @-@ state when the Broncos played in the Super Bowl . While at home , Thunder arrives at Mile High approximately two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours before kickoff . He is trailered into the stadium via the visitor 's tunnel . He has a large private box stall located next to the visitor 's locker room , and has hay , water and treats , including a big basket of carrots and apples . Judge signs autographs for about 45 minutes before each game , allowing fans , particularly children , an opportunity to become better acquainted with Thunder . Thunder usually leaves the field before the game is over . He is loaded into a horse trailer and hauled out of the stadium at the two @-@ minute warning . 
 Thunder has other duties off the field , and has appeared at many public exhibitions and charity functions in the Denver area , including visits to schools and hospitals . He has appeared frequently as part of the color guard at Denver 's annual National Western Stock Show . Thunder has gone up elevators , walked through indoor tunnels , has been ridden among the banquet tables at Magness @-@ Blake 's Western Fantasy fundraiser , and has attended indoor and outdoor press conferences .

 At Super Bowl XXXII in 1998 in San Diego , Thunder Sr. appeared on the field after touchdowns . It was his first away game , and required 26 hours of <unk> to reach the destination . Upon returning home , he led the team 's victory parade in front of 600 @,@ 000 fans in Denver . Thunder also attended Super Bowl XXXIII in Miami in 1999 . 
 In early 2014 , Thunder was again granted permission by the NFL to appear at Super Bowl XLVIII . Thunder III , age 14 at the time , made the trip because of concerns over Thunder II 's age ( 20 yrs ) and the stress some horses experience during air travel . It was the first time a Thunder mascot had been flown . He was transported to the east coast in a FedEx cargo plane , designed and equipped by Dutta Corporation specifically for transporting horses . FedEx sponsored the plane trip for its promotional value ; the cost for which normally runs about $ 20 @,@ 000 . The day after his arrival in Newark , New Jersey , Thunder was hauled into New York City for television appearances on Today , and Fox & Friends . He also walked through Times Square . 
 At Super Bowl XLVIII , Thunder led the team onto the field at the start of the game , making it the first Super Bowl where he was allowed to do so . Thunder was also allowed to run in the end zone after a touchdown , but because MetLife Stadium was considered a neutral zone for both teams , he was not allowed to run the length of the field . 
 For Super Bowl 50 , Thunder III was trailered to San Francisco , a two @-@ day trip that took four days because of ice and snow , further complicated by a 24 @-@ hour closure of I @-@ 80 . Upon arrival , Thunder was stabled at the Stanford Equestrian Center . Thunder II , who was retired at the end of the 2013 – 2014 season after the Broncos won the AFC Championship game , had remained in Denver . On the following Tuesday , he led the team in the Denver victory parade while Thunder III was still on the road heading home .

 Magness @-@ Blake owned all three of the Arabian horses that portrayed Thunder . She grew up poor in Philadelphia , and did not ride a horse until she was 20 years old . She married Bob Magness , founder of Tele @-@ Communications Inc . , who also loved horses , and together they began an Arabian breeding operation that at its peak had 900 horses . Following the death of her husband in November 1996 , Magness @-@ Blake downsized the horse operation and currently owns about 15 horses . In 2004 , she married Ernie Blake , an attorney and the mayor of Breckenridge who also loves horses . The couple , along with two other people , are part of Thunder 's ground crew at football games . 
 The first horse trainer for JB Kobask as Thunder was Tom Hudson , the trainer for Magness Arabians at the time . The mascot 's first rider was Angela Moore , then a 19 @-@ year @-@ old assistant trainer to Hudson and a graduate of Colorado State University . Ann Judge , also known as Ann Judge @-@ Wegener , became Thunder 's rider in 1998 . A year later , Judge took over as trainer as well as rider . She has been the trainer and rider of Thunder II for his entire career with the Broncos , and also does so for Thunder III . Judge grew up on an Arabian horse farm near West Lafayette , Indiana , and graduated from Purdue University in 1980 with a degree in English Education . She has ridden horses since she was five years old , was a participant in 4 @-@ H as a youth , and after finishing college became a horse trainer , first working in South Carolina and then in Colorado . Judge has been described by Broncos ' management as an " accomplished equestrian " . She has competed at the national level in Arabian and Pinto horse show competition . She is also a horse show judge who has adjudicated national and international events . Both Thunder II and Thunder III are stabled at Judge 's farm in Bennett , Colorado .

 JB Kobask , a purebred Arabian stallion foaled in 1983 , became the first live horse mascot for the Broncos in 1993 after a successful horse show career . He was a son of the reserve U.S. National Champion Arabian Stallion GG <unk> , and a grandson of the Polish @-@ bred Arabian * Bask , a multiple U.S. National Champion after his importation to the United States . JB Kobask also had a substantial amount of Crabbet breeding in his pedigree . 
 The stallion was kicked by a mare in a 1997 breeding accident , resulting in a fracture that required two arthroscopic surgeries on his stifle , akin to knee surgery on a human , and was out of commission for six weeks ; another two months was needed before he could gallop at full speed . Following his recovery , he resumed his mascot duties and appeared at Super Bowl XXXII in January 1998 . He served as the Broncos mascot for 11 years and was retired in 2004 after developing arthritis , which made it difficult for him to gallop down the field . He continued to make community appearances until his death in 2009 at age 27 . 
 Thunder , Sr. was noted for his bold personality , and was described by Magness @-@ Blake as having " a strong ego " . He had been trained to rear on command . Yet he remained calm and controlled in very intense situations , and Judge believed he had a sixth sense for when to be energetic for a performance and when to calm down . The stallion was notably gentle around children who wanted to pet him . During games , when he was waiting to perform , he had a tendency to watch players on the field .

 Winter Solstyce , an Arabian gelding foaled in 1994 , became " Thunder II " in 2004 . He was Magness @-@ Blake 's personal riding horse for several years prior to becoming the Broncos ' mascot . His paternal grandsire is * Salon , a Russian @-@ bred Arabian stallion from the Tersk Stud exported first to Germany and later brought to the United States .

 Thunder II stands 14 @.@ 3 hands ( 59 inches , 150 cm ) tall and weighs over 900 pounds ( 410 kg ) . Nicknamed " Dos " by Judge , Thunder II has been described as somewhat timid with a more subdued personality than his predecessor . Initially , he was nervous of the white markings on the football field and would try to jump over them . He was also afraid of the cheerleaders ' pom @-@ poms . For desensitization training , Judge and the rest of Thunder 's team would haul him to the football field at a local high school to work with people carrying pom @-@ poms and to run across a marked field . His handlers used operant conditioning with positive reinforcement , associating pom @-@ poms with a carrot treat . Eventually , he began turning to his handlers anticipating a treat whenever he saw a cheerleader with pom @-@ poms . 
 Thunder II would look attentively with his ears forward , seemingly on cue , for his picture to be taken whenever a photographer pointed a camera at him . He is known for being people @-@ friendly and particularly gentle with children who became acquainted with him prior to each game . Instead of watching players on the field the way Thunder Sr. did , Thunder II liked to observe the people in the stands . When bored , he has entertained himself by grabbing the zipper pulls of his handlers ' jackets and running them up and down . He also learned how to unscrew water bottles and squeeze them to get water . Officially retired in 2014 , Thunder II occasionally makes public appearances .

 Thunder III began his mascot duties as the understudy to Thunder II . He appeared at a few preseason home games in 2013 , and made most public appearances as team mascot in the Denver community that same year . His major public debut was in 2014 as team mascot at Super Bowl XLVIII in New Jersey . 
 Thunder III had been trained specifically for the role of Thunder , beginning at age three when Judge first started working with him under saddle . He was exposed to a variety of situations , including open horse shows where he could become accustomed to crowds and activity . Like Thunder II , he has appeared at Magness @-@ Blake 's annual Western Fantasy fundraising banquet for the Volunteers of America . He is people friendly and has been described as " social " and " quite the poser " .

 = Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky = 
 Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky ( / <unk> <unk> <unk> / ; Russian : <unk> <unk> ́ ч <unk> ́ вский ; tr . Pyotr Ilyich Chaykovsky ; 25 April / 7 May 1840 – 25 October / 6 November 1893 ) , often anglicized as Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky , was a Russian composer of the late @-@ Romantic period , some of whose works are among the most popular music in the classical repertoire . He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally , bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States . Tchaikovsky was honored in 1884 , by Emperor Alexander III , and awarded a lifetime pension . 
 Although musically precocious , Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant . There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education . When an opportunity for such an education arose , he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory , from which he graduated in 1865 . The formal Western @-@ oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five , with whom his professional relationship was mixed . Tchaikovsky 's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood . From this reconciliation , he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style — a task that did not prove easy . The principles that governed melody , harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music ; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large @-@ scale Western composition or from forming a composite style , and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky 's self @-@ confidence . Russian culture exhibited a split personality , with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great . This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country 's national identity — an ambiguity mirrored in Tchaikovsky 's career . 
 Despite his many popular successes , Tchaikovsky 's life was punctuated by personal crises and depression . <unk> factors included his early separation from his mother for boarding school followed by his mother 's early death , the death of his close friend and colleague Nikolai Rubinstein , and the collapse of the one enduring relationship of his adult life , which was his 13 @-@ year association with the wealthy widow Nadezhda von Meck . His homosexuality , which he kept private , has traditionally also been considered a major factor , though some musicologists now downplay its importance . Tchaikovsky 's sudden death at the age of 53 is generally ascribed to cholera ; there is an ongoing debate as to whether cholera was indeed the cause of death , or if it was accidental or self @-@ inflicted . 
 While his music has remained popular among audiences , critical opinions were initially mixed . Some Russians did not feel it was sufficiently representative of native musical values and expressed suspicion that Europeans accepted the music for its Western elements . In an apparent reinforcement of the latter claim , some Europeans lauded Tchaikovsky for offering music more substantive than base exoticism , and said he transcended stereotypes of Russian classical music . Others dismissed Tchaikovsky 's music as " lacking in elevated thought , " according to longtime New York Times music critic Harold C. Schonberg , and derided its formal workings as deficient because they did not stringently follow Western principles . 
 = = Life = = 
 = = = Childhood = = = 
 Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was born in Votkinsk , a small town in Vyatka Governorate ( present @-@ day <unk> ) in the Russian Empire , into a family with a long line of military service . His father , Ilya Petrovich Tchaikovsky , had served as a lieutenant colonel and engineer in the Department of Mines , and would manage the <unk> @-@ Votkinsk Ironworks . His grandfather , Petro Fedorovych Chaika , served first as a physician 's assistant in the army and later as city governor of <unk> in <unk> . His great @-@ grandfather , a Ukrainian Cossack named Fyodor Chaika ( accordingly , ' Tchaikovsky ' is the derivative of the Ukrainian family name ' Chaika ' ) , distinguished himself under Peter the Great at the Battle of Poltava in 1709 . Tchaikovsky 's mother , Alexandra Andreyevna née d <unk> , was the second of Ilya 's three wives , 18 years her husband 's junior and French on her father 's side . Both Ilya and Alexandra were trained in the arts , including music — a necessity as a posting to a remote area of Russia also meant a need for entertainment , whether in private or at social gatherings . Of Tchaikovsky 's six siblings , he was close to his sister Alexandra and twin brothers Anatoly and Modest . Alexandra 's marriage to Lev Davydov would produce seven children and lend Tchaikovsky the only real family life he would know as an adult , especially during his years of wandering . One of those children , Vladimir Davydov , whom the composer would nickname ' Bob ' , would become very close to him . 
 In 1844 , the family hired Fanny Dürbach , a 22 @-@ year @-@ old French governess . Four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year @-@ old Tchaikovsky was initially thought too young to study alongside his older brother Nikolai and a niece of the family . His insistence convinced Dürbach otherwise . By the age of six , he had become fluent in French and German . Tchaikovsky also became attached to the young woman ; her affection for him was reportedly a counter to his mother 's coldness and emotional distance from him , though others assert that the mother doted on her son . Dürbach saved much of Tchaikovsky 's work from this period , which includes his earliest known compositions , and became a source of several childhood anecdotes . 
 Tchaikovsky began piano lessons at age five . <unk> , within three years he had become as adept at reading sheet music as his teacher . His parents , initially supportive , hired a tutor , bought an <unk> ( a form of barrel organ that could imitate elaborate orchestral effects ) , and encouraged his piano study for both aesthetic and practical reasons . However , they decided in 1850 to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg . They had both graduated from institutes in Saint Petersburg and the School of Jurisprudence , which mainly served the lesser nobility , would prepare Tchaikovsky for a career as a civil servant . Regardless of talent , the only musical careers available in Russia at that time – except for the affluent aristocracy – were as a teacher in an academy or as an instrumentalist in one of the Imperial Theaters . Both were considered on the lowest rung of the social ladder , with individuals in them enjoying no more rights than peasants . His father 's income was also growing increasingly uncertain , so both parents may have wanted Tchaikovsky to become independent as soon as possible . As the minimum age for acceptance was 12 and Tchaikovsky was only 10 at the time , he was required to spend two years boarding at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence 's preparatory school , 1 @,@ 300 kilometres ( 800 mi ) from his family . Once those two years had passed , Tchaikovsky transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven @-@ year course of studies . 
 Tchaikovsky 's early separation from his mother caused an emotional trauma that lasted the rest his life and was intensified by her death from cholera in 1854 , when he was fourteen . Her loss also prompted Tchaikovsky to make his first serious attempt at composition , a waltz in her memory . Tchaikovsky 's father , who had also contracted cholera but recovered fully , sent him back to school immediately in the hope that classwork would occupy the boy 's mind . Isolated , Tchaikovsky compensated with friendships with fellow students that became lifelong ; these included Aleksey <unk> and Vladimir Gerard . Music , while not an official priority at school , also bridged the gap between Tchaikovsky and his peers . They regularly attended the opera and Tchaikovsky would improvise at the school 's harmonium on themes he and his friends had sung during choir practice . " We were amused , " Vladimir Gerard later remembered , " but not imbued with any expectations of his future glory . " Tchaikovsky also continued his piano studies through Franz Becker , an instrument manufacturer who made occasional visits to the school ; however , the results , according to musicologist David Brown , were " negligible " . 
 In 1855 , Tchaikovsky 's father funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger and questioned him about a musical career for his son . While impressed with the boy 's talent , Kündinger said he saw nothing to suggest a future composer or performer . He later admitted that his assessment was also based on his own negative experiences as a musician in Russia and his unwillingness for Tchaikovsky to be treated likewise . Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice . 
 = = = Civil service ; pursuing music = = = 
 On 10 June 1859 , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old Tchaikovsky graduated as a titular counselor , a low rung on the civil service ladder . Appointed to the Ministry of Justice , he became a junior assistant within six months and a senior assistant two months after that . He remained a senior assistant for the rest of his three @-@ year civil service career . 
 Meanwhile , the Russian Musical Society ( RMS ) was founded in 1859 by the Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna ( a German @-@ born aunt of Tsar Alexander II ) and her protégé , pianist and composer Anton Rubinstein . Previous tsars and the aristocracy had focused almost exclusively on importing European talent . The aim of the RMS was to fulfill Alexander II 's wish to foster native talent . It hosted a regular season of public concerts ( previously held only during the six weeks of Lent when the Imperial Theaters were closed ) and provided basic professional training in music . In 1861 , Tchaikovsky attended RMS classes in music theory taught by Nikolai Zaremba at the <unk> Palace ( now the Russian Museum ) . These classes were a precursor to the Saint Petersburg Conservatory , which opened in 1862 . Tchaikovsky enrolled at the Conservatory as part of its premiere class . He studied harmony and counterpoint with Zaremba and instrumentation and composition with Rubinstein . 
 The Conservatory benefited Tchaikovsky in two ways . It transformed him into a musical professional , with tools to help him thrive as a composer , and the in @-@ depth exposure to European principles and musical forms gave him a sense that his art was not exclusively Russian or Western . This mindset became important in Tchaikovsky 's reconciliation of Russian and European influences in his compositional style . He believed and attempted to show that both these aspects were " intertwined and mutually dependent " . His efforts became both an inspiration and a starting point for other Russian composers to build their own individual styles . 
 Rubinstein was impressed by Tchaikovsky 's musical talent on the whole and cited him as " a composer of genius " in his autobiography He was less pleased with the more progressive tendencies of some of Tchaikovsky 's student work . Nor did he change his opinion as Tchaikovsky 's reputation grew . He and Zaremba clashed with Tchaikovsky when he submitted his First Symphony for performance by the RMS in Saint Petersburg . Rubinstein and Zaremba refused to consider the work unless substantial changes were made . Tchaikovsky complied but they still refused to perform the symphony . Tchaikovsky , distressed that he had been treated as though he were still their student , withdrew the symphony . It was given its first complete performance , minus the changes Rubinstein and Zaremba had requested , in Moscow in February 1868 . 
 Once Tchaikovsky graduated in 1865 , Rubinstein 's brother Nikolai offered him the post of Professor of Music Theory at the soon @-@ to @-@ open Moscow Conservatory . While the salary for his professorship was only 50 rubles a month , the offer itself boosted Tchaikovsky 's morale and he accepted the post eagerly . He was further heartened by news of the first public performance of one of his works , his Characteristic Dances , conducted by Johann Strauss II at a concert in Pavlovsk Park on 11 September 1865 ( Tchaikovsky later included this work , re @-@ titled , Dances of the Hay Maidens , in his opera The Voyevoda ) . 
 From 1867 to 1878 , Tchaikovsky combined his professorial duties with music criticism while continuing to compose . This exposed him to a range of contemporary music and afforded him the opportunity to travel abroad . In his reviews , he praised Beethoven , considered Brahms overrated and , despite his admiration , took Schumann to task for poor orchestration . He appreciated the staging of Wagner 's Der Ring des Nibelungen at its inaugural performance in Bayreuth , Germany , but not the music , calling Das Rheingold " unlikely nonsense , through which , from time to time , sparkle unusually beautiful and astonishing details . " A recurring theme he addressed was the poor state of Russian opera . 
 = = = = Relationship with The Five = = = = 
 In 1856 , while Tchaikovsky was still at the School of Jurisprudence and Anton Rubinstein lobbied aristocrats to form the RMS , critic Vladimir Stasov and an 18 @-@ year @-@ old pianist , Mily Balakirev , met and agreed upon a nationalist agenda for Russian music , one that would take the operas of Mikhail Glinka as a model and incorporate elements from folk music , reject traditional Western practices and use exotic harmonic devices such as the whole tone and octatonic scales . They saw Western @-@ style conservatories as unnecessary and antipathetic to fostering native talent . Eventually , Balakirev , César Cui , Modest Mussorgsky , Nikolai Rimsky @-@ Korsakov and Alexander Borodin became known as the moguchaya kuchka , translated into English as the Mighty Handful or The Five . Rubinstein criticized their emphasis on amateur efforts in musical composition ; Balakirev and later Mussorgsky attacked Rubinstein for his musical conservatism and his belief in professional music training . Tchaikovsky and his fellow conservatory students were caught in the middle . 
 While ambivalent about much of The Five 's music , Tchaikovsky remained on friendly terms with most of its members . In 1869 , he and Balakirev worked together on what became Tchaikovsky 's first recognized masterpiece , the fantasy @-@ overture Romeo and Juliet , a work which The Five wholeheartedly embraced . The group also welcomed his Second Symphony , subtitled the Little Russian . Despite their support , Tchaikovsky made considerable efforts to ensure his musical independence from the group as well as from the conservative faction at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory . 
 = = = = Growing fame ; budding opera composer = = = = 
 The infrequency of Tchaikovsky 's musical successes , won with tremendous effort , exacerbated his lifelong sensitivity to criticism . Nikolai Rubinstein 's private fits of rage critiquing his music , most famously attacking the First Piano Concerto , did not help matters . His popularity grew , however , as several first @-@ rate artists became willing to perform his compositions . Hans von Bülow premiered the First Piano Concerto and championed other Tchaikovsky works both as pianist and conductor . Other artists included Adele Aus der Ohe , Max <unk> , Eduard Nápravník and Sergei Taneyev . 
 Another factor that helped Tchaikovsky 's music become popular was a shift in attitude among Russian audiences . Whereas they had previously been satisfied with flashy virtuoso performances of technically demanding but musically lightweight compositions , they gradually began listening with increasing appreciation of the music itself . Tchaikovsky 's works were performed frequently , with few delays between their composition and first performances ; the publication from 1867 onward of his songs and great piano music for the home market also helped boost the composer 's popularity . 
 During the late 1860s , Tchaikovsky began to compose operas . His first , The Voyevoda , based on a play by Alexander Ostrovsky , premiered in 1869 . The composer became dissatisfied with it , however , and , having re @-@ used parts of it in later works , destroyed the manuscript . <unk> followed in 1870 . Only excerpts were performed and it , too , was destroyed . Between these projects , Tchaikovsky started to compose an opera called <unk> , to a libretto by Sergei <unk> ; the only music he completed was a short chorus of Flowers and Insects . 
 The first Tchaikovsky opera to survive intact , The <unk> , premiered in 1874 . During its composition , he lost Ostrovsky 's part @-@ finished libretto . Tchaikovsky , too embarrassed to ask for another copy , decided to write the libretto himself , modelling his dramatic technique on that of Eugène Scribe . Cui wrote a " characteristically savage press attack " on the opera . Mussorgsky , writing to Vladimir Stasov , disapproved of the opera as pandering to the public . Nevertheless , The <unk> continues to be performed from time to time in Russia . 
 The last of the early operas , Vakula the Smith ( <unk> ) , was composed in the second half of 1874 . The libretto , based on Gogol 's Christmas Eve , was to have been set to music by Alexander Serov . With Serov 's death , the libretto was opened to a competition with a guarantee that the winning entry would be premiered by the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre . Tchaikovsky was declared the winner , but at the 1876 premiere the opera enjoyed only a lukewarm reception . After Tchaikovsky 's death , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov wrote an opera based on the same story , Christmas Eve . 
 Other works of this period include the Variations on a Rococo Theme for cello and orchestra , the Second and Fourth Symphonies , the ballet Swan Lake , and the opera Eugene Onegin . 
 = = = Emotional life = = = 
 Discussion of Tchaikovsky 's personal life , especially his sexuality , has perhaps been the most extensive of any composer in the 19th century and certainly of any Russian composer of his time . It has also at times caused considerable confusion , from Soviet efforts to expunge all references to same @-@ sex attraction and portray him as a heterosexual , to efforts at armchair analysis by Western biographers . Biographers have generally agreed that Tchaikovsky was gay . He sought the company of other men in his circle for extended periods , " associating openly and establishing professional connections with them . " However , the degree to which the composer might have felt comfortable with his sexual nature has remained open to debate . It is still unknown whether Tchaikovsky , according to musicologist and biographer David Brown , " felt tainted within himself , defiled by something from which he finally realized he could never escape " or whether , according to Alexander <unk> , he experienced " no unbearable guilt " over his sexual nature and " eventually came to see his sexual peculiarities as an insurmountable and even natural part of his personality ... without experiencing any serious psychological damage . " Relevant portions of his brother Modest 's autobiography , where he tells of the composer 's sexual orientation , have been published , as have letters previously suppressed by Soviet censors in which Tchaikovsky openly writes of it . 
 Tchaikovsky lived as a bachelor for most of his life . In 1868 he met Belgian soprano Désirée Artôt . They became infatuated with each other and were engaged to be married but due to Artôt 's refusal to give up the stage or settle in Russia , the relationship ended . Tchaikovsky later claimed she was the only woman he ever loved . In 1877 , at the age of 37 , he wed a former student , Antonina <unk> . The marriage was a disaster . <unk> psychologically and sexually , the couple lived together for only two and a half months before Tchaikovsky left , overwrought emotionally and suffering from an acute writer 's block . Tchaikovsky 's family remained supportive of him during this crisis and throughout his life . He was also aided by Nadezhda von Meck , the widow of a railway magnate who had begun contact with him not long before the marriage . As well as an important friend and emotional support , she became his patroness for the next 13 years , which allowed him to focus exclusively on composition . Tchaikovsky 's marital debacle may have forced him to face the full truth about his sexuality ; he never blamed Antonina for the failure of their marriage . 
 = = = Years of wandering = = = 
 Tchaikovsky remained abroad for a year after the disintegration of his marriage . During this time , he completed Eugene Onegin , orchestrated his Fourth Symphony , and composed the Violin Concerto . He returned briefly to the Moscow Conservatory in the autumn of 1879 For the next few years , assured of a regular income from von Meck , he traveled incessantly throughout Europe and rural Russia , mainly alone , and avoided social contact whenever possible . During this time , Tchaikovsky 's foreign reputation grew and a positive reassessment of his music also took place in Russia , thanks in part to Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky 's call for " universal unity " with the West at the unveiling of the Pushkin Monument in Moscow in 1880 . Before Dostoyevsky 's speech , Tchaikovsky 's music had been considered " overly dependent on the West . " As Dostoyevsky 's message spread throughout Russia , this stigma toward Tchaikovsky 's music evaporated . An unprecedented acclaim for him even drew a cult following among the young intelligentsia of Saint Petersburg , including Alexandre Benois , Léon Bakst and Sergei Diaghilev . 
 Two musical works from this period stand out . With the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour nearing completion in Moscow in 1880 , the 25th anniversary of the coronation of Alexander II in 1881 , and the 1882 Moscow Arts and Industry Exhibition in the planning stage , Nikolai Rubinstein suggested that Tchaikovsky compose a grand commemorative piece . Tchaikovsky agreed and finished it within six weeks . He wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that this piece , the 1812 Overture , would be " very loud and noisy , but I wrote it with no warm feeling of love , and therefore there will probably be no artistic merits in it . " He also warned conductor Eduard Nápravník that " I shan 't be at all surprised and offended if you find that it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts . " Nevertheless , the overture became , for many , " the piece by Tchaikovsky they know best . " 
 On 23 March 1881 , Nikolai Rubinstein died in Paris . That December , Tchaikovsky started work on his Piano Trio in A minor , " dedicated to the memory of a great artist . " First performed privately at the Moscow Conservatory on the first anniversary of Rubinstein 's death , the piece became extremely popular during the composer 's lifetime ; in November 1893 , it would become Tchaikovsky 's own elegy at memorial concerts in Moscow and St. Petersburg . 
 = = = Return to Russia = = = 
 In 1884 Tchaikovsky began to shed his unsociability and restlessness . That March , Tsar Alexander III conferred upon him the Order of St. Vladimir ( fourth class ) , which included a title of hereditary nobility and a personal audience with the Tsar . This was seen as a seal of official approval which advanced Tchaikovsky 's social standing and might have been cemented in the composer 's mind by the success of his Orchestral Suite No. 3 at its January 1885 premiere in Saint Petersburg . In 1885 , Alexander III requested a new production of Eugene Onegin at the Bolshoi <unk> Theatre in Saint Petersburg . By having the opera staged there and not at the Mariinsky Theatre , he served notice that Tchaikovsky 's music was replacing Italian opera as the official imperial art . In addition , thanks to Ivan <unk> , Director of the Imperial Theaters and a patron of the composer , Tchaikovsky was awarded a lifetime annual pension of 3 @,@ 000 rubles from the Tsar . This made him the premier court composer , in practice if not in actual title . 
 Despite Tchaikovsky 's disdain for public life , he now participated in it as part of his increasing celebrity and out of a duty he felt to promote Russian music . He helped support his former pupil Sergei Taneyev , who was now director of Moscow Conservatory , by attending student examinations and negotiating the sometimes sensitive relations among various members of the staff . He served as director of the Moscow branch of the Russian Musical Society during the 1889 – 1890 season . In this post , he invited many international celebrities to conduct , including Johannes Brahms , Antonín Dvořák and Jules Massenet . 
 During this period , Tchaikovsky also began promoting Russian music as a conductor , In January 1887 he substituted , on short notice , at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow for performances of his opera Cherevichki . Within a year , he was in considerable demand throughout Europe and Russia . These appearances helped him overcome life @-@ long stage fright and boosted his self @-@ assurance . In 1888 Tchaikovsky led the premiere of his Fifth Symphony in Saint Petersburg , repeating the work a week later with the first performance of his tone poem Hamlet . Although critics proved hostile , with César Cui calling the symphony " routine " and " meretricious " , both works were received with extreme enthusiasm by audiences and Tchaikovsky , undeterred , continued to conduct the symphony in Russia and Europe . Conducting brought him to America in 1891 , where he led the New York Music Society 's orchestra in his Festival Coronation March at the inaugural concert of Carnegie Hall . 
 = = = Belyayev circle and growing reputation = = = 
 In November 1887 , Tchaikovsky arrived at Saint Petersburg in time to hear several of the Russian Symphony Concerts , devoted exclusively to the music of Russian composers . One included the first complete performance of his revised First Symphony ; another featured the final version of Third Symphony of Nikolai Rimsky @-@ Korsakov , with whose circle Tchaikovsky was already in touch . Rimsky @-@ Korsakov , with Alexander Glazunov , Anatoly Lyadov and several other nationalistically minded composers and musicians , had formed a group known as the Belyayev circle , named after a merchant and amateur musician who became an influential music patron and publisher . Tchaikovsky spent much time in this circle , becoming far more at ease with them than he had been with the ' Five ' and increasingly confident in showcasing his music alongside theirs . This relationship lasted until Tchaikovsky 's death . 
 In 1892 , Tchaikovsky was voted a member of the Académie des Beaux @-@ Arts in France , only the second Russian subject to be so honored ( the first was sculptor Mark <unk> ) . The following year , the University of Cambridge in England awarded Tchaikovsky an honorary Doctor of Music degree . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 On 28 October / 9 November 1893 Tchaikovsky conducted the premiere of his Sixth Symphony , the Pathétique in Saint Petersburg . Nine days later , Tchaikovsky died there , aged 53 . He was interred in Tikhvin Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery , near the graves of fellow @-@ composers Alexander Borodin , Mikhail Glinka , and Modest Mussorgsky ; later , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov and Balakirev were also buried nearby . 
 While Tchaikovsky 's death has traditionally been attributed to cholera , most probably contracted through drinking contaminated water several days earlier from the local river , many writers have theorized that his death was a suicide . Opinion has been summarized as follows : " The polemics over [ Tchaikovsky 's ] death have reached an impasse ... Rumors attached to the famous die hard ... As for illness , problems of evidence offer little hope of satisfactory resolution : the state of diagnosis ; the confusion of witnesses ; disregard of long @-@ term effects of smoking and alcohol . We do not know how Tchaikovsky died . We may never find out ..... " 
 = = Music = = 
 Tchaikovsky wrote many works that are popular with the classical music public , including his Romeo and Juliet , the 1812 Overture , his three ballets ( The Nutcracker , Swan Lake , The Sleeping Beauty ) and Marche Slave . These , along with his First Piano Concerto and his Violin Concerto , the last three of his six numbered symphonies and his operas The Queen of Spades and Eugene Onegin , are among his most familiar works . Almost as popular are the Manfred Symphony , Francesca da Rimini , the Capriccio Italien and the Serenade for Strings . 
 = = = Creative range = = = 
 Tchaikovsky displayed an unusually wide stylistic and emotional range , from salon works of innocuous charm to symphonies of tremendous depth , power and grandeur . Some of his works , such as the Variations on a Rococo Theme , employ a poised " Classical " form reminiscent of 18th @-@ century composers such as Mozart ( the composer whose work was his favorite ) . Other compositions , such as his Little Russian symphony and his opera Vakula the Smith , flirt with musical practices more akin to those of the Five , especially in their use of folk song . Other works , such as Tchaikovsky 's last three symphonies , employ a personal musical idiom that facilitated intense emotional expression . 
 = = = Ukrainian folk elements = = = 
 Many of Tchaikovsky 's works have Ukrainian subjects or incorporate Ukrainian folk songs or melodies . Among these are the operas Mazepa ( based on Aleksandr Pushkin 's poem ) , Little Shoes , and Night before Christmas ( or Vakula the Smith , based on Nikolai Gogol 's story ) ; symphonies No. 2 ( Little Russian ) , No. 4 , and No. 7 ( finished and edited by Semyon <unk> ) ; the Concerto for Piano and Orchestra No. 1 in B @-@ flat Minor ; the 1812 Overture , the opening of which is based on the first mode of the Kievan chant ; the transcription for piano solo of Aleksandr Dargomyzhsky 's orchestral fantasy <unk> ; and songs to Russian translations of Taras Shevchenko , such as ‘ <unk> <unk> ’ ( Cherry Orchard ) . 
 = = = Compositional style = = = 
 = = = = Melody = = = = 
 American music critic and journalist Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Tchaikovsky 's " sweet , inexhaustible , <unk> fund of melody , " a feature that has ensured his music 's continued success with audiences . Tchaikovsky 's complete range of melodic styles was as wide as that of his compositions . Sometimes he used Western @-@ style melodies , sometimes original melodies written in the style of Russian folk song ; sometimes he used actual folk songs . According to The New Grove , Tchaikovsky 's melodic gift could also become his worst enemy in two ways . The first challenge arose from his ethnic heritage . Unlike Western themes , the melodies that Russian composers wrote tended to be self @-@ contained ; they functioned with a mindset of stasis and repetition rather than one of progress and ongoing development . On a technical level , it made modulating to a new key to introduce a contrasting second theme exceedingly difficult , as this was literally a foreign concept that did not exist in Russian music . The second way melody worked against Tchaikovsky was a challenge that he shared with the majority of Romantic @-@ age composers . They did not write in the regular , symmetrical melodic shapes that worked well with sonata form , such as those favored by Classical composers such as Haydn , Mozart or Beethoven , but were complete and independent in themselves . This completeness hindered their use as structural elements in combination with one another . This challenge was why the Romantics " were never natural symphonists . " . All a composer like Tchaikovsky could do with them was to essentially repeat them , even when he modified them to generate tension , maintain interest and satisfy listeners . 
 = = = = Harmony = = = = 
 Harmony could be a potential trap for Tchaikovsky , according to Brown , since Russian creativity tended to focus on inertia and self @-@ enclosed tableaux , while Western harmony worked against this to propel the music onward and , on a larger scale , shape it . Modulation , the shifting from one key to another , was a driving principle in both harmony and sonata form , the primary Western large @-@ scale musical structure since the middle of the 18th century . Modulation maintained harmonic interest over an extended time @-@ scale , provided a clear contrast between musical themes and showed how those themes were related to each other . One point in Tchaikovsky 's favor was " a flair for harmony " that " astonished " Rudolph Kündinger , Tchaikovsky 's music tutor during his time at the School of Jurisprudence . Added to what he learned at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory studies , this talent allowed Tchaikovsky to employ a varied range of harmony in his music , from the Western harmonic and textural practices of his first two string quartets to the use of the whole tone scale in the center of the finale of the Second Symphony , a practice more typically used by The Five .
