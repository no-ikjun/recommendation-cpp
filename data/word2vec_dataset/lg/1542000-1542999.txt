 = = = Evolutionary constraints = = = 
 The processes of evolution , as they are presently understood , can help explain why wheeled locomotion has not evolved in multicellular organisms ; simply put , a complex structure or system will not evolve if its incomplete form provides no benefit to the organism . 
 According to the modern evolutionary synthesis , adaptations are produced incrementally through natural selection , so major genetic changes will usually spread within populations only if they do not decrease the fitness of individuals . Although neutral changes ( which provide no benefit ) can spread through genetic drift , and detrimental changes can spread under some circumstances , large changes that require multiple steps will occur only if the intermediate stages increase fitness . Richard Dawkins describes the matter thus : " The wheel may be one of those cases where the engineering solution can be seen in plain view , yet be unattainable in evolution because it lies [ on ] the other side of a deep valley , cutting <unk> across the massif of Mount Improbable . " In such a fitness landscape , wheels might sit on a highly favorable " peak " , but the valley around that peak may be too deep or wide for the gene pool to migrate across by genetic drift or natural selection . Stephen Jay Gould notes that biological adaptation is limited to working with available components , commenting that " wheels work well , but animals are debarred from building them by structural constraints inherited as an evolutionary legacy . " 
 Natural selection therefore explains why wheels are an unlikely solution to the problem of locomotion – a partially evolved wheel , missing one or more of its key components , would probably not impart an advantage to an organism . The exception to this is the flagellum , the only known example of a freely rotating propulsive system in biology ; in the evolution of flagella , individual components were recruited from older structures , where they performed tasks unrelated to propulsion . The basal body that is now the rotary motor might , for instance , have evolved from a structure used by the bacterium to inject toxins into other cells . This recruitment of previously evolved structures to serve new functions is called exaptation . 
 Molecular biologist Robin Holliday has written that the absence of biological wheels argues against creationist or intelligent design accounts of the diversity of life , because an intelligent creator — free of the limitations imposed by evolution — would be expected to deploy wheels wherever they would be of use . 
 = = = Developmental and anatomical constraints = = = 
 Using human manufacturing processes , wheeled systems of varying complexity have proven fairly simple to construct , and issues of power transmission and friction have proven tractable . It is not clear , however , that the vastly different processes of embryonic development are suited to — or even capable of — producing a functioning wheel , for reasons described below . 
 The greatest anatomical impediment to wheeled multicellular organisms is the interface between the static and rotating components of the wheel . In either a passive or driven case , the wheel ( and possibly axle ) must be able to rotate freely relative to the rest of the machine or organism . Unlike animal joints , which have a limited range of motion , a wheel must be able to rotate through an arbitrary angle without ever needing to be " unwound " . As such , a wheel cannot be permanently attached to the axle or shaft about which it rotates ( or if the axle and wheel are fixed together , the axle cannot be affixed to the rest of the machine or organism ) . 
 = = = = Power transmission to driven wheels = = = = 
 In the case of a driven wheel , a torque must be applied to generate the locomotive force . In human technology , this torque is generally provided by a motor , of which there are many types , including electric , piston @-@ driven , turbine @-@ driven , pneumatic , and hydraulic . ( Torque may also be provided by human power , as in the case of a bicycle . ) In animals , motion is typically achieved by the use of skeletal muscles , which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food . Because these muscles are attached to both of the components that must move relative to each other , they are not capable of directly driving a wheel . In addition , large animals cannot produce high accelerations , as relative inertia increases rapidly with body size . 
 = = = = Friction = = = = 
 In typical mechanical systems , some type of bearing and / or lubricant must be used to reduce friction at the interface between two components . Reducing friction is vital for minimizing wear on components and preventing overheating . As the relative speed of the components rises , and as the contact force between them increases , the importance of friction mitigation increases as well . In biological joints such as the human knee , friction is reduced by means of cartilage with a very low friction coefficient , as well as lubricating synovial fluid , which has very low viscosity . Gerhard Scholtz , professor at the Institut für Biologie <unk> Zoologie ( " Institute for Biology and Comparative Zoology " ) at Humboldt University of Berlin , asserts that a similar secreted lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely . 
 = = = = Nutrient and waste transfer = = = = 
 Another potential problem that arises at the interface between wheel and axle ( or axle and body ) is the ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface . If the tissues that make up a wheel are living , they will need to be supplied with oxygen and nutrients and have wastes removed in order to sustain metabolism . A typical animal circulatory system , composed of blood vessels , would not be able to provide transportation across the interface . In the absence of circulation , oxygen and nutrients would need to diffuse across the interface , a process that would be greatly limited by the available partial pressure and surface area , in accordance with Fick 's law of diffusion . For large multicellular animals , diffusion would be insufficient . Alternately , a wheel could be composed of excreted , nonliving material such as keratin , of which hair and nails are composed . 
 = = Disadvantages of wheels = = 
 Wheels incur mechanical and other disadvantages in certain environments and situations that would represent a decreased fitness when compared with limbed locomotion . These disadvantages suggest that , even barring the biological constraints discussed above , the absence of wheels in multicellular life may not in fact be the " missed opportunity " of biology that it first seems . On the contrary , given the mechanical disadvantages and restricted usefulness of wheels when compared with limbs , the central question can be reversed : not " Why doesn 't nature produce wheels ? " , but rather , " Why don 't human vehicles make more use of limbs ? " The use of wheels rather than limbs in many engineered vehicles can likely be attributed to the complexity of design required to construct and control limbs , rather than to a consistent functional advantage of wheels over limbs . 
 = = = Efficiency = = = 
 = = = = Rolling resistance = = = = 
 Although stiff wheels are more energy efficient than other means of locomotion when traveling over hard , level terrain ( such as paved roads ) , wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as soils , because they are vulnerable to rolling resistance . In rolling resistance , a vehicle loses energy to the deformation of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling . Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to rolling resistance . <unk> surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces , resulting in greater resistance . Compared with rolling on concrete , resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater , and resistance on sand can be ten to fifteen times greater . While wheels must deform the surface along their entire path , limbs induce only a small , localized deformation at the point of foot contact . 
 Rolling resistance is also the reason wheels are not seen in certain human civilizations . During the time of the Roman Empire , wheeled chariots were common in the Middle East and North Africa ; yet when the Empire collapsed , wheels fell out of favor with the local populations , who turned to camels to transport goods in the sandy desert climate . In his book Hen 's Teeth and Horse 's Toes , Stephen Jay Gould explains this curiosity of history , asserting that , in the absence of maintained roads , camels required less manpower and water than a cart pulled by oxen . 
 = = = = Efficiency of aquatic locomotion = = = = 
 When moving through a fluid , rotating systems carry an efficiency advantage only at extremely low Reynolds numbers ( i.e. , viscosity @-@ dominated flows ) such as those experienced by bacterial flagella , whereas oscillating systems have the advantage at higher ( inertia @-@ dominated ) Reynolds numbers . Whereas ship propellers typically have efficiencies around 60 % and aircraft propellers up to around 80 % ( achieving 88 % in the human @-@ powered Gossamer Condor ) , much higher efficiencies , in the range of 96 % – 98 % , can be achieved with an oscillating flexible foil like a fish tail or bird wing . 
 = = = Traction = = = 
 Wheels are prone to slipping — an inability to generate traction — on loose or slippery terrain . Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead to a loss of control or becoming stuck , as with an automobile on mud or snow . This limitation of wheels can be seen in the realm of human technology : in an example of biologically inspired engineering , legged vehicles find use in the logging industry , where they allow access to terrain more challenging than what wheeled vehicles can navigate . Tracked vehicles suffer less from slipping than wheeled vehicles , owing to their larger contact area with the ground — but they tend to have larger turning radii than wheeled vehicles , and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex . 
 = = = Obstacle navigation = = = 
 Work by engineer Mieczysław G. Bekker implies that the distribution of irregularities in natural terrains is log @-@ normal ; i.e. , small obstacles are far more common than larger ones . Thus , obstacle navigation presents a challenge to wheeled locomotion in natural terrains at all size scales . The primary means of obstacle navigation are to go around obstacles and to go over them . 
 = = = = Going around obstacles = = = = 
 <unk> Michael LaBarbera of the University of Chicago illustrates the poor maneuverability of wheels by comparing the turning radii of walking and wheelchair @-@ bound humans . As Jared Diamond points out , most biological examples of rolling are found in wide open , hard packed terrain , including the use of rolling by dung beetles and <unk> . 
 = = = = Going over obstacles = = = = 
 Wheels are poor at dealing with vertical obstacles , especially obstacles on the same scale as the wheel itself . Assuming a vehicle or animal can shift its center of mass , the limiting height of vertical obstacles for a passive wheel is equal to the radius of the wheel . If the center of mass cannot be shifted , the highest obstacle a vehicle can surmount is one quarter to one half the radius of the wheel . Because of these limitations , wheels intended for rough terrain require a larger diameter . 
 In addition , without articulation , a wheeled vehicle can become stuck on top of an obstacle , with the obstacle between the wheels , preventing them from contacting the ground . Limbs , in contrast , are useful for climbing and are equipped to deal with uneven terrain . 
 With <unk> wheels , climbing obstacles will cause the body of a vehicle to tilt . If the vehicle 's center of mass moves outside of the wheelbase or axle track , the vehicle will become statically unstable and tip over . At high speeds , a vehicle can become dynamically unstable , meaning that it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit , or by excessive acceleration or tight turning . Without articulation , this can be an impossible position from which to recover . 
 = = = Versatility = = = 
 Limbs used by animals for locomotion over terrain are frequently also used for other purposes , such as grasping , manipulating , climbing , branch @-@ swinging , swimming , digging , jumping , throwing , kicking , and grooming . With a lack of articulation , wheels would not be as useful as limbs in these roles .

 = Muhammad al @-@ Durrah incident = 
 The Muhammad al @-@ Durrah incident took place in the Gaza Strip on 30 September 2000 , on the second day of the Second Intifada , during widespread rioting throughout the Palestinian territories . Jamal al @-@ Durrah and his 12 @-@ year @-@ old son , Muhammad , were filmed by Talal Abu Rahma , a Palestinian cameraman freelancing for France 2 , as they were caught in crossfire between Israeli and Palestinian security forces . The footage shows the pair crouching behind a concrete cylinder , the boy crying and the father waving , then a burst of gunfire and dust , after which the boy is seen slumped across his father 's legs . 
 Fifty @-@ nine seconds of the footage were broadcast in France with a voiceover from Charles Enderlin , the station 's bureau chief in Israel , who was not present during the shooting . Based on information from the cameraman , Enderlin told viewers that the al @-@ Durrahs had been the " target of fire from the Israeli positions " and that the boy had died . After an emotional public funeral , Muhammad was hailed throughout the Muslim world as a martyr . 
 Over the months and years that followed , commentators questioned the accuracy of France 2 's report . The Israel Defense Forces accepted responsibility for the shooting at first but later retracted . French journalists who saw the raw footage confirmed that France 2 had cut a final few seconds in which Muhammad appeared to lift his hand from his face ; they acknowledged that he had died , but said the footage alone did not show it . France 2 's news editor said in 2005 that no one could be sure who fired the shots . Other commentators , particularly Philippe Karsenty , a French media commentator , went further , alleging that the scene had been staged by Palestinian protesters ; France 2 sued him for libel and in 2013 he was fined € 7 @,@ 000 by the Court of Appeal of Paris . In May that year an Israeli government report supported Karsenty 's view . Jamal al @-@ Durrah and Charles Enderlin rejected its conclusion and called for an independent international investigation . 
 The footage of the father and son acquired what one writer called the power of a battle flag . Postage stamps in the Middle East carried the images ; one of the images was visible in the background when Daniel Pearl , a Jewish @-@ American journalist , was beheaded by al @-@ Qaeda in 2002 . James Fallows wrote of the controversy that " no version of truth that is considered believable by all sides will ever emerge . " 
 = = Background = = 
 On 28 September 2000 , two days before the shooting , the Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem , a holy site in both Judaism and Islam with contested rules of access . The violence that followed had its roots in several events , but the visit was provocative and triggered protests that escalated into rioting across the West Bank and Gaza Strip . The uprising became known as the Second Intifada ; it lasted over four years and cost around 4 @,@ 000 lives , over 3 @,@ 000 of them Palestinian . 
 The Netzarim junction , where the shooting took place , is known locally as the al @-@ <unk> ( martyrs ' ) junction . It lies on Saladin Road , a few kilometres south of Gaza City . The source of conflict at the junction was the nearby Netzarim settlement , where 60 Israeli families lived until Israel 's withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 . A military escort accompanied the settlers whenever they left or arrived at the settlement , and an Israeli military outpost , Magen @-@ 3 , guarded the approach . The area had been the scene of violent incidents in the days before the shooting .

As of 2013 they had four daughters and six sons , including a boy , Muhammad , born two years after the shooting . 
 Until the shooting , Jamal had worked for Moshe Tamam , an Israeli contractor , for 20 years , since he was 14 . Writer Helen Schary <unk> came to know Jamal when she employed him to help build her house in Tel Aviv . She described his years of rising at 3 : 30 am to catch the bus to the border crossing at four , then a second bus out of Gaza so he could be at work by six . Tamam called him a " terrific man , " someone he trusted to work alone in his customers ' homes . 
 Muhammad Jamal Al @-@ Durrah ( born 1988 ) was in fifth grade , but his school was closed on 30 September 2000 ; the Palestinian Authority had called for a general strike and day of mourning following violence in Jerusalem the day before . His mother said he had been watching the rioting on television and asked if he could join in . Father and son decided instead to go to a car auction . Jamal had just sold his 1974 Fiat , <unk> wrote , and Muhammad loved cars , so they went to the auction together .

 Charles Enderlin was born in 1945 in Paris ; his grandparents were Austrian Jews who had left the country in 1938 when Germany invaded . After briefly studying medicine , he moved to Jerusalem in 1968 where he became an Israeli national . He began working for France 2 in 1981 , serving as their bureau chief in Israel from 1990 until his retirement in 2015 . Enderlin is the author of several books about the Middle East , including one about Muhammad al @-@ Durrah , Un Enfant est Mort : Netzarim , 30 Septembre 2000 ( 2010 ) . Highly regarded among his peers and within the French establishment , he submitted a letter from Jacques Chirac , during the Philippe Karsenty libel action , who wrote in flattering terms of Enderlin 's integrity . In 2009 he was awarded France 's highest decoration , the Légion d 'honneur . 
 According to journalist Anne @-@ Élisabeth Moutet , Enderlin 's coverage of the Israeli @-@ Palestinian conflict was respected by other journalists but was regularly criticized by pro @-@ Israel groups .

 On the day of the shooting — Rosh Hashanah , the Jewish New Year — the two @-@ story Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) outpost at the Netzarim junction was manned by Israeli soldiers from the Givati Brigade Engineering Platoon and the <unk> Battalion . According to Enderlin , the soldiers were Druze . 
 The two @-@ story IDF outpost sat northwest of the junction . Two six @-@ story Palestinian blocks ( known as the twins or twin towers and described variously as offices or apartments ) lay directly behind it . South of the junction , diagonally across from the IDF , there was a Palestinian National Security Forces outpost under the command of Brigadier @-@ General Osama al @-@ Ali , a member of the Palestine National Council . The concrete wall that Jamal and Muhammad crouched against was in front of this building ; the spot was less than 120 metres from the most northerly point of the Israeli outpost . 
 In addition to France 2 , the Associated Press and Reuters also had camera crews at the junction . They captured brief footage of the al @-@ Durrahs and Abu Rahma . Abu Rahma was the only journalist to film the moment the al @-@ Durrahs were shot . 
 = = = Arrival at the junction , shooting starts = = = 
 Jamal and Muhammad arrived at the junction in a cab around midday , on their way back from the car auction . There had been a protest , demonstrators had thrown stones , and the IDF had responded with tear gas . Abu Rahma was filming events and interviewing protesters , including Abdel Hakim Awad , head of the Fatah youth movement in Gaza . Because of the protest , a police officer stopped Jamal and Muhammad 's cab from going any further , so father and son proceeded on foot across the junction . It was at that point , according to Jamal , that the live fire started . Enderlin said the first shots were fired from the Palestinian positions and returned by the Israeli soldiers . 
 Jamal , Muhammad , the Associated Press cameraman , and Shams Oudeh , the Reuters cameraman , took cover against the concrete wall in the south @-@ east quadrant of the crossroads , diagonally across from the Israeli outpost . Jamal , Muhammad and Shams Oudeh crouched behind a three @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) concrete drum , apparently part of a culvert , that was sitting against the wall . A thick paving stone sat on top of the drum , which offered further protection . Abu Rahma hid behind a white minibus parked across the road about 15 metres away from the wall . The Reuters and Associated Press cameramen briefly filmed over Jamal and Muhammad 's shoulders — the cameras pointing toward the Israeli outpost — before the men moved away . Jamal and Muhammad did not move away , but stayed behind the drum for 45 minutes . In Enderlin 's view , they were frozen in fear . 
 = = = France 2 report = = = 
 In an affidavit three days after the shooting , Abu Rahma said shots had been fired for about 45 minutes and that he had filmed around 27 minutes of it . ( How much film was shot became a bone of contention in 2007 when France 2 told a court that only 18 minutes of film existed . ) He began filming Jamal and Muhammad when he heard Muhammad cry and saw that the boy had been shot in the right leg . He said he filmed the scene containing the father and son for about six minutes . He sent those six minutes to Enderlin in Jerusalem via satellite . Enderlin edited the footage down to 59 seconds and added a voiceover : 
 1500 hours . Everything has just erupted near the settlement of Netzarim in the Gaza Strip . The Palestinians have shot live bullets , the Israelis are responding . Paramedics , journalists , passersby are caught in the crossfire . Here , Jamal and his son Mohammed are the target of fire from the Israeli positions . Mohammed is twelve , his father is trying to protect him . He is motioning . Another burst of fire . Mohammed is dead and his father seriously wounded . 
 The footage shows Jamal and Muhammad crouching behind the cylinder , the child screaming and the father shielding him . Jamal appears to shout something in the direction of the cameraman , then waves and shouts in the direction of the Israeli outpost . There is a burst of gunfire and the camera goes out of focus . When the gunfire subsides , Jamal is sitting upright and injured and Muhammad is lying over his legs . Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the footage that shows Muhammad lift his hand from his face . This cut became the basis of much of the controversy over the film . 
 The raw footage stops suddenly at this point and begins again with unidentified people being loaded into an ambulance . ( At that point in his report , Enderlin said : " A Palestinian policeman and an ambulance driver have also lost their lives in the course of this battle . " ) Bassam al @-@ <unk> , an ambulance driver on his way to the scene , was reported to have been shot and killed , leaving a widow and 11 children . Abu Rahma said Muhammad lay bleeding for at least 17 minutes before an ambulance picked up father and son together . He said he did not film them being picked up because he was worried about having only one battery . Abu Rahma remained at the junction for 30 – 40 minutes until he felt it was safe to leave , then drove to his studio in Gaza City to send the footage to Enderlin . The 59 seconds of footage were first broadcast on France 2 's nightly news at 8 : 00 pm local time ( GMT + 2 ) , after which France 2 distributed several minutes of raw footage around the world without charge .

 Jamal and Muhammad were taken by ambulance to the Al @-@ Shifa Hospital in Gaza City . Abu Rhama telephoned the hospital and was told that three bodies had arrived there : that of a jeep driver , an ambulance driver , and a boy , initially named by mistake as Rami Al @-@ Durrah . 
 According to Dr. Abed El @-@ Razeq El Masry , the pathologist who examined Muhammed , the boy had received a fatal injury to the abdomen . In 2002 he showed Esther Schapira , a German journalist , post @-@ mortem images of Muhammad next to cards identifying him by name . Schapira also obtained , from a Palestinian journalist , what appeared to be footage of him arriving at the hospital on a stretcher . During an emotional public funeral in the Bureij refugee camp , Muhammad was wrapped in a Palestinian flag and buried before sundown on the day of his death , in accordance with Muslim tradition . 
 Jamal was taken at first to the Al @-@ Shifa Hospital in Gaza . Dr. Ahmed <unk> said Jamal had received multiple wounds from high @-@ velocity bullets striking his right elbow , right thigh and the lower part of both legs ; his femoral artery was also cut .

Moshe Tamam , Jamal 's Israeli employer , offered to have him taken to hospital in Tel Aviv , but the Palestinian Authority declined the offer . He was transferred instead to the King Hussein Medical Center in Amman , Jordan , where he was visited by King Abdullah . Jamal reportedly told Tamam that he had been hit by nine bullets ; he said five were removed from his body in hospital in Gaza and four in Amman . 
 = = = Cameraman 's account = = = 
 Enderlin based his allegation that the IDF had shot the boy on the report of the cameraman , Talal Abu Rahma . Abu Rahma was clear in interviews that the Israelis had fired the shots . For example , he told The Guardian : " They were cleaning the area . Of course they saw the father . They were aiming at the boy , and that is what surprised me , yes , because they were shooting at him , not only one time , but many times . " Abu Rahma said shooting was also coming from the Palestinian National Security Forces outpost , but that they were not shooting when Muhammad was hit . The Israeli fire was being directed at this Palestinian outpost , he said . He told National Public Radio : 
 I saw the boy getting injured in his leg , and the father asking for help . Then I saw him getting injured in his arm , the father . The father was asking the ambulances to help him , because he could see the ambulances . I cannot see the ambulance ... I wasn 't far away , maybe from them [ Jamal and Muhammad ] face to face about 15 meters , 17 meters . But the father didn 't succeed to get the ambulance by waving to them . He looked at me and he said , " Help me . " I said , " I cannot , I can 't help you . " The shooting till then was really heavy ... It was really raining bullets , for more than for 45 minutes . 
 Then ... I hear something , " boom ! " Really is coming with a lot of dust . I looked at the boy , I filmed the boy lying down in the father 's lap , and the father really , getting really injured , and he was really dizzy . I said , " Oh my god , the boy 's got killed , the boy 's got killed , " I was screaming , I was losing my mind . While I was filming , the boy got killed ... I was very afraid , I was very upset , I was crying , and I was remembering my children .... This was the most terrible thing that has happened to me as a journalist . 
 Abu Rahma alleged in an affidavit that " the child was intentionally and in cold blood shot dead and his father injured by the Israeli army . " The affidavit was given to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights in Gaza and signed by the cameraman in the presence of Raji <unk> , a human rights lawyer . France 2 's communications director , Christine <unk> , said in 2008 that Abu Rahma denied having accused the Israeli army of firing at the boy in cold blood , and that this had been falsely attributed to him . 
 = = = Israel 's early response = = = 
 The position of the IDF changed over time , from accepting responsibility in 2000 to retracting the admission in 2005 . The IDF 's first response , when Enderlin contacted them before his broadcast , was that the Palestinians " make cynical use of women and children , " which he decided not to air . 
 On 3 October 2000 , the IDF 's chief of operations , Major @-@ General Giora Eiland , said an internal investigation indicated the shots had apparently been fired by Israeli soldiers . The soldiers , under fire , had been shooting from small slits in the wall of their outpost ; General Yom @-@ Tov Samia , then head of the IDF 's Southern Command said they may not have had a clear field of vision , and had fired in the direction from which they believed the fire was coming . Eiland issued an apology : " This was a grave incident , an event we are all sorry about . " 
 The Israelis had been trying for hours to speak to Palestinian commanders , according to Israel 's Cabinet Secretary , Isaac Herzog ; he added that Palestinian security forces could have intervened to stop the fire . 
 = = Controversy = = 
 = = = Overview = = = 
 Three mainstream narratives emerged after the shooting . The early view that Israeli gunfire had killed the boy developed into the position that , because of the trajectory of the shots , Palestinian gunfire was more likely to have been responsible . This view was expressed in 2005 by Denis Jeambar , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of L 'Express , and Daniel Leconte , a former France 2 correspondent , who viewed the raw footage . A third perspective , held by Arlette Chabot , France 2 's news editor , is that no one can know who fired the shots . 
 A fourth , minority , position held that the scene was staged by Palestinian protesters to produce a child martyr or at least the appearance of one . This is known by those who follow the case as the " maximalist " view , as opposed to the " minimalist " view that the shots were probably not fired by the IDF . The maximalist view takes the form either that the al @-@ Durrahs were not shot and Muhammad did not die , or that he was killed intentionally by Palestinians . 
 The view that the scene was a media hoax of some kind emerged from an Israeli government enquiry in November 2000 . It was most persistently pursued by Stéphane <unk> , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the Metula News Agency ( Mena ) , a French @-@ Israeli company ; Luc Rosenzweig , former editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Le Monde and a Mena contributor ; Richard Landes , an American historian who became involved after Enderlin showed him the raw footage during a visit to Jerusalem in 2003 ; and Philippe Karsenty , founder of a French media @-@ watchdog site , Media @-@ Ratings . It was also supported by Gérard Huber , a French psychoanalyst , and Pierre @-@ André <unk> , a French philosopher who specializes in antisemitism , both of whom wrote books about the affair . The hoax view gained further support in 2013 from a second Israeli government report , the Kuperwasser report . Several commentators regard it as a right @-@ wing conspiracy theory and smear campaign . 
 = = = Key issues = = = 
 Key issues include how much footage was shot ; that it was blurred at the moment Jamal and Muhammad were hit ; that France 2 cut a few seconds in which the boy moves ; and that the cameraman stopped filming at that point . Despite the presence of camera crews from ( at least ) France 2 , Associated Press and Reuters , there is no footage of the c . 17 minutes Jamal and Muhammad waited for an ambulance or of them being loaded into one . There is no film of the death of the first ambulance driver , Bassam al @-@ <unk> , who was reportedly shot on his way to pick them up . 
 Several commentators questioned what time the shooting occurred ; what time Muhammad arrived at the hospital ; why there seemed to be little blood on the ground where they were shot ; and whether any bullets were collected . Several alleged that , in other scenes in the raw footage , it is clear that protesters are play acting . One physician maintained that Jamal 's scars were not from bullet wounds , but dated back to an injury he sustained in the early 1990s . 
 There was no criminal inquiry . Palestinian police allowed journalists to photograph the scene the following day , but they gathered no forensic evidence . According to a Palestinian general , there was no Palestinian investigation because there was no doubt that the Israelis had killed the boy . General Yom Tov Samia of the IDF said the presence of protesters meant the Israelis were unable to examine and take photographs of the scene . The increase in violence at the junction cut off the <unk> settlers , so the IDF evacuated them and , a week after the shooting , blew up everything within 500 metres of the IDF outpost , thereby destroying the crime scene . 
 A pathologist examined the boy 's body , but there was no full autopsy . It is unclear whether bullets were recovered from the scene or from Jamal and Muhammad . In 2002 Abu Rahma implied to Esther Schapira that he had collected bullets at the scene , adding : " We have some secrets for ourselves . We cannot give anything ... everything . " According to Jamal al @-@ Durrah , five bullets were recovered from his body by physicians in Gaza and four in Amman . In 2013 he said , without elaborating : " The bullets the Israelis fired are in the possession of the Palestinian Authority . " 
 = = = Footage = = = 
 = = = = How long , what it showed = = = = 
 Questions arose about how much footage existed and whether it showed the boy had died . Abu Rahma said in an affidavit that the gunfight had lasted 45 minutes and that he had filmed about 27 minutes of it . Doreen Carvajal of the International Herald Tribune said in 2005 that France 2 had shown the newspaper " the original 27 @-@ minute tape of the incident . " When the Court of Appeal of Paris asked , in 2007 , to see all the footage , during France 2 's libel case against Philippe Karsenty , France 2 presented the court with 18 minutes of film , saying the rest had been destroyed because it had not been about the shooting . Enderlin then said only 18 minutes of footage had been shot . 
 According to Abu Rahma , six minutes of his footage focused on the al @-@ Durrahs . France 2 broadcast 59 seconds of that scene and released another few seconds of it . No part of the footage shows the boy dead . Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the end , during which Muhammad appears to lift his hand away from his face . Enderlin said he had cut this scene in accordance with the France 2 ethical charter , because it showed the boy in his death throes ( " agonie " ) , which he said was " unbearable " ( " J 'ai coupé l <unk> de l 'enfant . C 'était insupportable ... <unk> n <unk> rien <unk> de plus ) . In 2007 he said he had meant to use the word agony , not agonie . If he were editing the footage again , he said in 2005 , he would include that scene . 
 = = = = Why the footage stopped when it did = = = = 
 Another issue is why France 2 , the Associated Press and Reuters did not film the scene directly after the shooting , including the shooting death of the ambulance driver who arrived to pick up Jamal and Muhammad . Abu Rahma 's footage stops suddenly after the shooting of the father and son , then begins again — from the same position , with the white minibus behind which Abu Rhama was standing visible in the shot — with other people being loaded into an ambulance . 
 Abu Rahma said Muhammad lay bleeding for at least 17 minutes before an ambulance picked up Jamal and Muhammad together , but he did not film any of it . When Esther Schapira asked why not , he replied : " Because when the ambulance came it closed on them , you know ? " When asked why he had not filmed the ambulance arriving and leaving , he replied that he had only one battery . Enderlin reportedly told the Paris Court of Appeal that Abu Rahma changed batteries at that point . Enderlin wrote in 2008 that " footage filmed by a cameraman under fire is not the equivalent of a surveillance camera in a supermarket . " Abu Rahma " filmed what circumstances permitted . " 
 = = = = French journalists view the footage = = = = 
 In October 2004 France 2 allowed three French journalists to view the raw footage — Denis Jeambar , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of L 'Express ; Daniel Leconte , former France 2 correspondent and head of news documentaries at Arte , a state @-@ run television network ; and Luc Rosenzweig , former editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Le Monde . They also asked to speak to the cameraman , who was in Paris at the time , but France 2 apparently told them he did not speak French and that his English was not good enough . 
 Jeambar and Leconte wrote a report about the viewing for Le Figaro in January 2005 . None of the scenes showed that the boy had died , they wrote . They rejected the position that the scene had been staged , but when Enderlin 's voiceover said Muhammad was dead , Enderlin " had no possibility of determining that he was in fact dead , and even less so , that he had been shot by IDF soldiers . " They said the footage did not show the boy 's death throes : " This famous ' agonie ' that Enderlin insisted was cut from the montage does not exist . " 
 Several minutes of the film showed Palestinians playing at war for the cameras , they wrote , falling down as if wounded , then getting up and walking away . A France 2 official told them , " You know it 's always like that , " a comment that Leconte said he found disturbing given the controversy . Christine <unk> , France 2 's communications director , said that none of the scenes in the footage had been staged . Jeambar and Leconte concluded that the shots had come from the Palestinian positions , given the trajectory of the bullets . Leconte said in an interview : " If they had been Israeli bullets , they would be very strange bullets because they would have needed to go around the corner . " He dismissed France 2 's explanation — that perhaps the bullets that hit the boy had ricocheted off the ground . " It could happen once , but that there should be eight or nine of them , which go around a corner ? They 're just saying anything . " 
 The idea of writing about the raw footage had been Luc Rosenzweig 's ; he had initially offered a story about it to L 'Express , which is how Jeambar ( editor of L 'Express ) had become involved . But Jeambar and Leconte ended up distancing themselves from Rosenzweig . He was involved with the Israeli @-@ French Metula News Agency ( known as Mena ) , which was pushing the view that the scene was a fake . Rosenzweig later called it " an almost perfect media crime . " When Jeambar and Leconte wrote up their report about the raw footage , they initially offered it Le Monde , not Le Figaro , but Le Monde refused to publish it because Mena had been involved at an earlier stage . Jeambar and Leconte made clear in Le Figaro that they gave no credence to the staging hypothesis : 
 To those who , like Mena , tried to use us to support the theory that the child 's death was staged by the Palestinians , we say they are misleading us and their readers . Not only do we not share that point of view , but we attest that , given our present knowledge of the case , nothing supports that conclusion . In fact , the reverse is true . " 
 = = = = Enderlin 's response = = = = 
 Enderlin responded to Leconte and Jeambar in January 2005 in Le Figaro . He thanked them for rejecting that the scene had been staged . He had reported that the shots were fired by the Israelis because , he wrote , he trusted the cameraman , who had worked for France 2 since 1988 . In the days following the shooting , other witnesses , including other journalists , offered some confirmation , he said . He added that the Israeli army had not responded to France 2 's offers to cooperate with their investigation . 
 Another reason he had attributed the shooting to Israel , he wrote , was that " the image corresponded to the reality of the situation not only in Gaza but also in the West Bank . " Citing Ben <unk> in the Israeli newspaper Maariv , he wrote that , during the first months of the Second Intifada , the IDF had fired one million rounds of ammunition — 700 @,@ 000 in the West Bank and 300 @,@ 000 in Gaza ; from 29 September to late October 2000 , 118 Palestinians had been killed , including 33 under the age of 18 , compared to 11 adult Israelis killed during the same period . 
 = = = Confusion about timeline = = = 
 Confusion arose about the timeline . The cameraman said the shooting began at noon and continued for 45 minutes . Jamal 's account matched his : he and Muhammad arrived at the junction around noon , and were under fire for 45 minutes . 
 Enderlin 's France 2 report placed the shooting later in the day . His voiceover said that Jamal and Muhammad were shot around 3 : 00 pm local time ( GMT + 3 ) . James Fallows agreed that Jamal and Muhammad first made an appearance in the footage around 3 : 00 pm , judging by comments from Jamal and some journalists on the scene . Abu Rahma said he remained at the junction for 30 – 40 minutes after the shooting . According to Schapira , he left for his studio in Gaza at around 4 pm , where he sent the footage to Enderlin in Jerusalem at around 6 pm . The news first arrived in London from the Associated Press at 6 : 00 pm BST ( GMT + 1 ) , followed minutes later by a similar report from Reuters . 
 Contradicting the noon and 3 pm timelines , Mohammed Tawil , the doctor who admitted Muhammad to the Al @-@ Shifa Hospital in Gaza City , told Esther Schapira that the boy had been admitted around 10 : 00 am local time , along with the ambulance driver , who had been shot through the heart . Tawil later said that he could not recall what he had told reporters about this . Records from the Al @-@ Shifa Hospital reportedly show that a young boy was examined in the pathology department at midday . The pathologist , Dr. Abed El @-@ Razeq El Masry , examined him for half an hour . He told Schapira that the boy 's abdominal organs were lying outside his body , and he showed Schapira images of the body , with a card identifying the boy as Muhammad . A watch on a pathologist 's wrist in one of the images appeared to say 3 : 50 . 
 = = = Interview with soldiers = = = 
 In 2002 Schapira interviewed three anonymous Israeli soldiers , " Ariel , <unk> and Idan , " who said they had been on duty at the IDF post that day . They knew something was about to happen , one said , because of the camera crews that had gathered . One soldier said the live fire started from the high @-@ rise Palestinian blocks known as " the twins " ; the shooter was firing at the IDF post , he said . The soldier added that he had not seen the al @-@ Durrahs . The Israelis returned fire on a Palestinian station 30 metres to the left of the al @-@ Durrahs . Their weapons were equipped with optics that allowed them to fire accurately , according to the soldier , and none of them had switched to automatic fire . In the view of the soldier , the shooting of Jamal and Muhammad was no accident . The shots did not come from the Israeli position , he said . 
 = = = Father 's injuries = = = 
 In 2007 Yehuda David , a physician at Tel Hashomer hospital near Tel Aviv , told Israel 's Channel 10 that he had treated Jamal Al @-@ Durrah in 1994 for knife and axe wounds to his arms and legs , injuries sustained during a gang attack . David maintained that the scars Jamal had presented as bullet wounds were in fact scars from a tendon @-@ repair operation David had performed in the early 90s . When David repeated his allegations in an interview with a " Daniel <unk> , " published in 2008 in Actualité Juive in Paris , Jamal filed a complaint with the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris for defamation and breach of doctor @-@ patient confidentiality . 
 The court established that " Daniel <unk> " was a pseudonym for Clément Weill @-@ Raynal , a deputy editor at France 3 . In 2011 it ruled that David and Actualité Juive had defamed Jamal . David , Weill @-@ Raynal and Serge <unk> , the managing editor of Actualité Juive , were fined € 5 @,@ 000 each , and Actualité Juive was ordered to print a retraction . The Israeli government said it would fund David 's appeal . The appeal was upheld in 2012 ; David was acquitted of defamation and breach of confidentiality . Benjamin Netanyahu , Israeli 's prime minister , telephoned David to congratulate him . Jamal Al @-@ Durrah said he would appeal the court 's decision . 
 In 2012 Rafi Walden , deputy director of the Tel Hashomer hospital and board member of Physicians for Human Rights , wrote in Haaretz that he had examined Jamal 's 50 @-@ page medical file , and that the injuries from the 2000 shooting were " completely different wounds " from the 1994 injuries . Walden listed " a gunshot wound in the right wrist , a shattered forearm bone , multiple fragment wounds in a palm , gunshot wounds in the right thigh , a fractured pelvis , an exit wound in the buttocks , a tear in the main nerve of the right thigh , tears in the main groin arteries and veins , and two gunshot wounds in the left lower leg . "

 = = = = 2000 : Shahaf report = = = = 
 Major General Yom Tov Samia , the IDF 's southern commander , set up an inquiry soon after the shooting . According to James Fallows , Israeli commentators questioned its legitimacy as soon as it started ; Haaretz called it " almost a pirate endeavour . " The team was led by Nahum Shahaf , a physicist , and Joseph Doriel , an engineer , both of whom had been involved in the Yitzhak Rabin assassination conspiracy theories . Other investigators included Meir <unk> , chief scientist at Elisra Systems ; Bernie Schechter , a ballistics expert , formerly with the Israeli police 's criminal identification laboratory ; and Chief Superintendent Elliot Springer , also from the criminal identification lab . A full list of names was never released . 
 Shahaf and Doriel built models of the wall , concrete drum and IDF post , and tried to reenact the shooting . A mark on the drum from the Israeli Bureau of Standards allowed them to determine its size and composition . They concluded that the shots may have come from a position behind the France 2 cameraman , where Palestinian police were alleged to have been standing . 
 On 23 October 2000 , Shahaf and Doriel invited CBS 60 Minutes to film the reenactment . Doriel told the correspondent , Bob Simon , that he believed the boy 's death was real , but that it had been set up to damage Israel . Those in the know , he said , included the cameraman and the boy 's father , though the latter had not realized the boy would be killed . When General Samia heard about the interview , he removed Doriel from the investigation . The investigators ' report was shown to the head of Israeli military intelligence ; the key points were published in November 2000 as not ruling out that the IDF had shot the boy , though describing it as " quite plausible " that he had been hit by Palestinian bullets aimed at the IDF post . The inquiry provoked widespread criticism . A Haaretz editorial said , " it is hard to describe in mild terms the stupidity of this bizarre investigation . " 
 = = = = 2005 : Retraction of earlier position = = = = 
 In 2005 Major @-@ General Giora Eiland publicly retracted the IDF 's admission of responsibility , and a statement to that effect was approved by the prime minister 's office in September 2007 . The following year an IDF spokesman , Col. <unk> Am @-@ Shalom , said that the Shahaf report had shown the IDF could not have shot Muhammad . He asked France 2 to send the IDF the unedited 27 minutes of raw footage , as well as footage the France 2 cameraman shot the following day . 
 = = = = 2013 : Kuperwasser report = = = = 
 In September 2012 the Israeli government set up another inquiry at the request of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . The team was led by Yossi Kuperwasser , director @-@ general of the Strategic Affairs Ministry . In May 2013 it published a 44 @-@ page report concluding that the al @-@ Durrahs had not been hit by IDF fire and may not have been shot at all . 
 The Kuperwasser report said that France 2 's central claims were not substantiated by the material the station had in its possession at the time ; that the boy was alive at the end of the video ; that there was no evidence that Jamal or Muhammad were injured in the manner reported by France 2 or that Jamal was seriously injured ; and that they may not have been shot at all . It included a medical opinion from Yehuda David , the doctor who treated Jamal in 1994 . The report said it is " highly doubtful that bullet holes in the vicinity of the two could have had their source in fire from the Israeli position , " and that the France 2 report was " edited and narrated in such a way as to create the misleading impression that it substantiated the claims made therein . " The France 2 narrative relied entirely on the cameraman 's opinion , the report said . Yuval Steinitz , Minister of International Affairs , Strategy and Intelligence , called the affair a " modern @-@ day blood libel against the State of Israel . " 
 France 2 , Charles Enderlin and Jamal al @-@ Durrah rejected the report 's conclusions and said they would cooperate with an independent international investigation . France 2 and Enderlin asked the Israeli government to supply the commission 's letter of appointment , membership and evidence , including photographs and the names of witnesses . Enderlin said the commission had failed to speak to him , France 2 , al @-@ Durrah or other eyewitnesses , and had consulted no independent experts . According to Enderlin , France 2 stood ready to help al @-@ Durrah have his son 's body exhumed ; he and al @-@ Durrah said they were willing to take polygraph tests .

 = = = 2006 : Enderlin @-@ France 2 v. Karsenty = = = 
 In response to claims that it had broadcast a staged scene , Enderlin and France 2 filed three defamation suits in 2004 and 2005 , seeking symbolic damages of € 1 . The most notable lawsuit was against Philippe Karsenty , who ran a media watchdog , Media @-@ Ratings . He published an analysis of the footage on his website in November 2004 , based on work from the French @-@ Israeli Metula News Agency , that alleged the shooting scene had been faked , as had several scenes leading up to it where protesters were shown being injured . France 2 and Enderlin issued a writ two days later . 
 The case began in September 2006 . Enderlin submitted as evidence a February 2004 letter from Jacques Chirac , then president of France , which spoke of Enderlin 's integrity . The court upheld the complaint on 19 October 2006 , fining Karsenty € 1 @,@ 000 and ordering him to pay € 3 @,@ 000 in costs . He lodged an appeal that day . 
 = = = 2007 : Karsenty v. Enderlin @-@ France 2 = = = 
 The first appeal opened in September 2007 in the Court of Appeal of Paris , before a three @-@ judge panel led by Judge Laurence <unk> . The court asked France 2 to turn over the 27 minutes of raw footage the cameraman said he had shot , to be shown during a public hearing . France 2 produced 18 minutes ; Enderlin said that only 18 minutes had been shot . 
 During the screening , the court heard that Muhammad had raised his hand to his forehead and moved his leg after the cameraman had said he was dead , and that there was no blood on his shirt . Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not said the boy was dead , but that he was dying . A report prepared for the court by Jean @-@ Claude <unk> , a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty , said that had the shots come from the Israeli position , Muhammad would have been hit in the lower limbs only . 
 France 2 's lawyer , Francis <unk> , counsel to former President of France Jacques Chirac , called Karsenty " the Jew who pays a second Jew to pay a third Jew to fight to the last drop of Israeli blood , " comparing him to 9 / 11 conspiracy theorist Thierry <unk> and Holocaust denier Robert Faurisson . Karsenty had it in for Enderlin , <unk> argued , because of Enderlin 's even @-@ handed coverage of the Middle East . 
 The judges overturned the ruling against Karsenty in May 2008 in a 13 @-@ page decision . They ruled that he had exercised in good faith his right to criticize and had shown the court a " coherent body of evidence . " The court noted inconsistencies in Enderlin 's statements and said that the cameraman 's statements were not " perfectly credible either in form or content . " There were calls for a public inquiry from historian Élie <unk> , a former Israeli ambassador to France , and Richard <unk> , president of the Conseil <unk> des Institutions <unk> de France . The left @-@ leaning Le Nouvel Observateur began a petition in support of Enderlin that was signed by 300 French writers , accusing Karsenty of a seven @-@ year smear campaign . 
 = = = 2013 : Defamation ruling = = = 
 France 2 appealed to the Court of Cassation ( supreme court ) . In February 2012 it quashed the decision of the appeal court to overturn the conviction , ruling that the court should not have asked France 2 to provide the raw footage . The case was sent back to the appeal court , which convicted Karsenty of defamation in 2013 and fined him € 7 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Impact of the footage = = 
 The footage of Muhammad was compared to other iconic images of children under attack : the boy in the Warsaw ghetto ( 1943 ) , the Vietnamese girl doused with napalm ( 1972 ) , and the firefighter carrying the dying baby in Oklahoma ( 1995 ) . Catherine Nay , a French journalist , argued that Muhammad 's death " cancels , erases that of the Jewish child , his hands in the air before the SS in the Warsaw Ghetto . " 
 Palestinian children were distressed by the repeated broadcasting of the footage , according to a therapist in Gaza , and were re @-@ enacting the scene in playgrounds . Arab countries issued postage stamps bearing the images . Parks and streets were named in Muhammad 's honour , and Osama bin Laden mentioned him in a " warning " to President George Bush after 9 / 11 . The images were blamed for the 2000 Ramallah lynching and a rise in antisemitism in France . One image could be seen in the background when journalist Daniel Pearl , an American Jew , was beheaded by al @-@ Qaeda in February 2002 . 
 Sections of the Jewish and Israeli communities , including the Israeli government in 2013 , described the statements that IDF soldiers had killed the boy as a " blood libel , " a reference to the centuries @-@ old allegation that Jews sacrifice Christian children for their blood . Comparisons were made with the Dreyfus affair of 1894 , when a French @-@ Jewish army captain was found guilty of treason based on a forgery . In the view of Charles Enderlin , the controversy is a smear campaign intended to undermine footage coming out of the occupied Palestinian territories . Doreen <unk> wrote in The New York Times that the footage is " a cultural prism , with viewers seeing what they want to see . " 
 = Russian battleship Borodino = 
 Borodino ( Russian : <unk> ) was the lead ship of her class of pre @-@ dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy although she was the second ship of her class to be completed . Named after the 1812 Battle of Borodino , the ship was completed after the beginning of the Russo @-@ Japanese War in 1904 . Borodino was assigned to the Second Pacific Squadron sent to the Far East a few months after her completion to break the Japanese blockade of Port Arthur . The Japanese captured the port while the squadron was in transit and their destination was changed to Vladivostok . The ship was sunk during the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905 due to explosions set off by a Japanese shell hitting a 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) magazine . There was only one survivor from her crew of 855 officers and enlisted men . 
 = = Description = = 
 Borodino was 389 feet 5 inches ( 118 @.@ 7 m ) long at the waterline and 397 feet ( 121 @.@ 0 m ) long overall , with a beam of 76 feet 1 inch ( 23 @.@ 2 m ) and a draft of 29 feet 2 inches ( 8 @.@ 9 m ) , 38 inches ( 965 mm ) more than designed . Her normal displacement was 14 @,@ 091 long tons ( 14 @,@ 317 t ) , over 500 long tons ( 508 t ) more than her designed displacement of 13 @,@ 516 long tons ( 13 @,@ 733 t ) . Her intended crew consisted of 28 officers and 754 enlisted men , although she usually carried 826 – 46 crewmen in service . 
 The ship was powered by two four @-@ cylinder vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one three @-@ bladed propeller , using steam generated by 20 Belleville boilers . Unlike her sisters , the engines and boilers were both built by the Franco @-@ Russian Works and the boilers provided steam to the engines at a pressure of 19 standard atmospheres ( 1 @,@ 925 kPa ; 279 psi ) . The engines were rated at 16 @,@ 300 indicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 200 kW ) and designed to reach a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . They produced , however , only 15 @,@ 012 ihp ( 11 @,@ 194 kW ) on her builder 's sea trials on 23 August 1904 and gave an average speed of 16 @.@ 2 knots ( 30 @.@ 0 km / h ; 18 @.@ 6 mph ) . At full load she carried 1 @,@ 350 long tons ( 1 @,@ 372 t ) of coal that provided her a range of 2 @,@ 590 nautical miles ( 4 @,@ 800 km ; 2 @,@ 980 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 Borodino 's 40 @-@ caliber 12 @-@ inch guns were mounted in two twin @-@ turrets , one each fore and aft . They had a rate of fire of about one round per 90 seconds . Sixty rounds per gun were carried . The twelve 45 @-@ caliber 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns were mounted in six electrically powered twin @-@ gun turrets carried on the upper deck . They had a practical rate of fire of approximately three rounds per minute and were provided with 180 rounds per gun . Four of the twenty 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) guns used against torpedo boats were mounted in casemates just below the forward main gun turret , two on each side . These guns were placed well above the waterline for use in any weather , unlike the remaining sixteen guns , which were mounted in casemates one deck lower and distributed over the length of the ship , close to the water . The unsuitability of the lower deck guns was graphically demonstrated when Borodino 's sister ship Imperator Aleksander III made a high @-@ speed turn during her trials , heeling 15 ° , and began taking water through the lower casemates . Each gun had 300 rounds available . The ship also mounted twenty 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss guns for anti @-@ torpedo boat defense . Borodino carried four 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) torpedo tubes , one each above water in the bow and in the stern , and a submerged tube on each side forward . 
 The ship 's waterline armor belt consisted of Krupp armor and was 5 @.@ 7 – 7 @.@ 64 inches ( 145 – 194 mm ) thick . The armor of her gun turrets had a maximum thickness of 10 in ( 254 mm ) and her deck ranged from 1 to 2 inches ( 25 to 51 mm ) in thickness . The 1 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 38 mm ) armored lower deck curved downwards to her double bottom and formed an anti @-@ torpedo bulkhead . 
 = = Service = = 
 Construction began on Borodino , named after the Battle of Borodino in 1812 , on 26 May 1899 at the New Admiralty Shipyard in Saint Petersburg . The ship was laid down on 23 May 1900 in the presence of Tsar Nicholas II , and launched on 8 September 1901 . She was completed in August 1904 at the cost of 14 @,@ 573 @,@ 000 rubles . 
 On 15 October 1904 , Borodino set sail for Port Arthur from Libau along with the other vessels of the Second Pacific Squadron , under the overall command of Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky . Rozhestvensky led his squadron , including Borodino , down the Atlantic coast of Africa , rounding Cape Horn , and reached the island of Nosy Be off the north @-@ west coast of Madagascar on 9 January 1905 where they remained for two months while Rozhestvensky finalized his coaling arrangements . During this time , Rozhestvensky learned of the capture of Port Arthur and changed his destination to Vladivostok , the only other port controlled by the Russians in the Far East . The squadron sailed for Camranh Bay , French Indochina , on 16 March and reached it almost a month later to await the obsolete ships of the 3rd Pacific Squadron , commanded by Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov . The latter ships reached Camranh Bay on 9 May and the combined force sailed for Vladivostok on 14 May . While exact figures are not available for Borodino , it is probable that the ship was approximately 1 @,@ 700 long tons ( 1 @,@ 700 t ) overweight as she and her sisters were overloaded with coal and other supplies ; all of which was stored high in the ships and reduced their stability . The extra weight also submerged the waterline armor belt and left only about 4 feet 6 inches ( 1 @.@ 4 m ) of the upper armor belt above the waterline . 
 Rozhestvensky decided to take the most direct route to Vladivostok using the Tsushima Strait and was intercepted by the Japanese battlefleet under the command of Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō on 27 May 1905 . At the beginning of the battle , Borodino was third in line behind Rozhestvensky 's flagship , Knyaz Suvorov . Very little is known of the ship 's actions during the battle as there was only a single survivor from the ship and visibility was poor for most of the battle , but Captain W. C. Pakenham , the Royal Navy 's official military observer aboard the Japanese battleship Asahi under the Anglo @-@ Japanese Alliance , noted that she was hit badly around 14 : 30 , some 25 minutes after Russian ships opened fire . Borodino briefly fell out of her position after that hit , but apparently regained it by 14 : 50 . By this time , she had a serious fire on the central portion of her superstructure . 
 Knyaz Suvorov suffered multiple hits early in the battle , some of which wounded Rozhestvensky and jammed the ship 's steering so that she fell out of formation . Around 16 : 00 , Borodino 's captain , Petr <unk> , now de facto commander of the fleet , turned Borodino south and led the Russian fleet out of sight . As Japanese cruisers closed in at around 17 : 05 , he turned the fleet north to avoid them , but encountered the Japanese battleships an hour later . They concentrated their fire on Borodino and her sister , Imperator Aleksander III , both of which had lists from earlier damage . Captain Pakenham noted a conspicuous hit on Borodino at 18 : 57 and she was observed to be on fire at 19 : 04 by observers aboard Tōgō 's flagship Mikasa . Pakenham observed two 12 @-@ inch hits by the battleship Shikishima at 19 : 18 that started a massive fire . Ten minutes later , after Tōgō ordered his ships to cease fire and disengage , the battleship Fuji fired her already @-@ loaded 12 @-@ inch guns before turning away . One of these hit Borodino beneath her starboard forward six @-@ inch turret and ignited the ready @-@ use ammunition in the turret . The fire spread and caused a catastrophic detonation in a nearby 6 @-@ inch magazine . Subsequent detonations of other magazines blew open her hull and the ship quickly capsized and sank . Only one crewman , Seaman First Class Semyon Yushin , survived the explosion from her crew of 855 , being rescued after surviving for twelve hours in the water . 
 = Monte Testaccio = 
 Monte Testaccio ( alternatively spelled Monte <unk> ; also known as Monte dei cocci ) is an artificial mound in Rome composed almost entirely of <unk> ( Italian : cocci ) , fragments of broken amphorae dating from the time of the Roman Empire , some of which were labelled with tituli picti . It is one of the largest spoil heaps found anywhere in the ancient world , covering an area of 20 @,@ 000 square metres ( 220 @,@ 000 sq ft ) at its base and with a volume of approximately 580 @,@ 000 cubic metres ( 760 @,@ 000 cu yd ) , containing the remains of an estimated 53 million amphorae . It has a circumference of nearly a kilometre ( 0 @.@ 6 mi ) and stands 35 metres ( 115 ft ) high , though it was probably considerably higher in ancient times . It stands a short distance away from the east bank of the River Tiber , near the <unk> <unk> where the state @-@ controlled reserve of olive oil was stored in the late 2nd century AD . The mound later had both religious and military significance . 
 = = Structure and purpose = = 
 The huge numbers of broken amphorae at Monte Testaccio illustrate the enormous demand for oil of imperial Rome , which was at the time the world 's largest city with a population of at least one million people . It has been estimated that the hill contains the remains of as many as 53 million olive oil amphorae , in which some 6 billion litres ( 1 @.@ 3 billion imperial gallons / 1 @.@ 6 billion U.S. gallons ) of oil were imported . Studies of the hill 's composition suggest that Rome 's imports of olive oil reached a peak towards the end of the 2nd century AD , when as many as 130 @,@ 000 amphorae were being deposited on the site each year . The vast majority of those vessels had a capacity of some 70 liters ( 15 imp gal ; 18 U.S. gal ) ; from this it has been estimated that Rome was importing at least 7 @.@ 5 million liters ( 1 @.@ 6 million imperial gal / 2 million U.S. gal ) of olive oil annually . As the vessels found at Monte Testaccio appear to represent mainly state @-@ sponsored olive oil imports , it is very likely that considerable additional quantities of olive oil were imported privately . 
 Monte Testaccio was not simply a haphazard waste dump ; it was a highly organised and carefully engineered creation , presumably managed by a state administrative authority . Excavations carried out in 1991 showed that the mound had been raised as a series of level terraces with retaining walls made of nearly intact amphorae filled with shards to anchor them in place . Empty amphorae were probably carried up the mound intact on the backs of donkeys or mules and then broken up on the spot , with the shards laid out in a stable pattern . Lime appears to have been sprinkled over the broken pots to neutralise the smell of rancid oil . 
 As the oldest parts of Monte Testaccio are at the bottom of the mound , it is difficult to say with any certainty when it was first created . Deposits found by excavators have been dated to a period between approximately AD 140 to 250 , but it is possible that dumping could have begun on the site as early as the 1st century BC . The mound has a roughly triangular shape comprising two distinct platforms , the eastern side being the oldest . At least four distinct series of terraces were built in a stepped arrangement . Layers of small sherds were laid down in some places , possibly to serve as paths for those carrying out the waste disposal operations . 
 = = Re @-@ use and disposal of amphorae = = 
 The hill was constructed using mostly the fragments of large globular 70 @-@ liter ( 15 imp gal ; 18 U.S. gal ) vessels from Baetica ( the Guadalquivir region of modern Spain ) , of a type now known as Dressel 20 . It also included smaller numbers of two types of amphorae from Tripolitania ( Libya ) and Byzacena ( Tunisia ) . All three types of vessel were used to transport olive oil . However , it is not clear why Monte Testaccio was built using only olive oil vessels . The oil itself was probably decanted into bulk containers when the amphorae were unloaded at the port , in much the same way as other staples such as grain . There is no equivalent mound of broken grain or wine amphorae and the overwhelming majority of the amphorae found at Monte Testaccio are of one single type , which raises the question of why the Romans found it necessary to dispose of the amphorae in this way . 
 One possibility is that the Dressel 20 amphora , the principal type found at Monte Testaccio , may have been unusually difficult to recycle . Many types of amphora could be re @-@ used to carry the same type of product or modified to serve a different purpose — for instance , as drain pipes or flower pots . Fragmentary amphorae could be pounded into chips to use in opus signinum , a type of concrete widely used as a building material , or could simply be used as landfill . The Dressel 20 amphora , however , broke into large curved fragments that could not readily be reduced to small shards . It is likely that the difficulty of reusing or repurposing the Dressel 20s meant that it was more economical to discard them . 
 Another reason for not re @-@ cycling olive oil amphorae into concrete of the opus signinum type may have been that the fragments were too fatty due to residual oil . Also , oil happens to react chemically with lime ( a major component of concrete ) and the product of this chemical reaction is soap ; the resulting concrete would have had unsatisfactory quality . Wheat amphorae and wine amphorae on the other hand were certainly " clean " enough to be re @-@ cycled into concrete . 
 = = <unk> picti = = 
 Monte Testaccio has provided archaeologists with a rare insight into the ancient Roman economy . The amphorae deposited in the mound were often labelled with tituli picti , painted or stamped inscriptions which record information such as the weight of the oil contained in the vessel , the names of the people who weighed and documented the oil and the name of the district where the oil was originally bottled . This has allowed archaeologists to determine that the oil in the vessels was imported under state authority and was designated for the annona <unk> ( distribution to the people of Rome ) or the annona militaris ( distribution to the army ) . Indeed , some of the inscriptions found on mid @-@ 2nd century vessels at Monte Testaccio specifically record that the oil they once contained was delivered to the praefectus annonae , the official in charge of the state @-@ run food distribution service . It is possible that Monte Testaccio was also managed by the praefectus annonae . 
 The tituli picti on the Monte Testaccio amphorae tend to follow a standard pattern and indicate a rigorous system of inspection to control trade and deter fraud . An amphora was first weighed while empty , and its weight was marked on the outside of the vessel . The name of the export merchant was then noted , followed by a line giving the weight of the oil contained in the amphora ( subtracting the previously determined weight of the vessel itself ) . Those responsible for carrying out and monitoring the weighing then signed their names on the amphora and the location of the farm from which the oil originated was also noted . The maker of the amphora was often identified by a stamp on the vessel 's handle . 
 The inscriptions also provide evidence of the structure of the oil export business . Apart from single names , many inscriptions list combinations such as " the two <unk> <unk> , father and son " , " the <unk> " , " <unk> <unk> and Fabius <unk> " , " the two Junii , <unk> and Melissa " , " the partners Hyacinthus , Isidore and Pollio " , " L. Marius Phoebus and the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . " This suggests that many of those involved were members of joint enterprises , perhaps small workshops involving business partners , father @-@ son teams and skilled freedmen . 
 = = Later history = = 
 Monte Testaccio 's use as an amphora dump seems to have ceased after about the 260s , perhaps due to the city 's quays being moved elsewhere . A new type of amphora was also introduced around this time to transport olive oil . 
 The area around the hill was largely abandoned after the fall of Rome . A print of 1625 depicts Monte Testaccio standing in isolation in an area of wasteland within the ancient city walls , and even as late as the mid @-@ 19th century the surrounding area was little more than a " romantic desert " on which was situated only " a few shabby houses " . It was the scene of jousts and tournaments during the Middle Ages , when Monte Testaccio was the scene of pre @-@ Lenten celebrations . As part of the festivities , two carts filled with pigs were hauled to the top of the hill , then allowed to run back down the steep slope to be smashed to pieces along with their porcine passengers . The watching revellers would then dismember the pigs on the spot and carry the parts off to be roasted and eaten . 
 Monte Testaccio was still used as a place of recreation when Stendhal visited in 1827 . A 19th century traveller , visiting a few years earlier , described the annual festival that was held on the summit of the hill : 
 " Each Sunday and Thursday during the month of October , almost the whole population of Rome , rich and poor , throng to this spot , where innumerable tables are covered with refreshments , and the wine is drawn cool from the vaults . It is impossible to conceive a more animating scene than the summit of the hill presents . Gay groups dancing the <unk> , intermingled with the jovial circles which surround the tables ; the immense crowd of walkers who , leaving their carriages below , stroll about to enjoy the festive scene ... " 
 The hill gained a brief military significance in 1849 when it was used as the site of an Italian gun battery , under the command of Giuseppe Garibaldi , in the successful defence of Rome against an attacking French army . Its economic significance was somewhat greater , as the hill 's interior was discovered to have unusual cooling properties which investigators attributed to the ventilation produced by its porous structure . This made it ideal for wine storage and caves were excavated to keep wine cool in the heat of the Roman summer . 
 Monte Testaccio also had a religious significance ; it was formerly used on Good Friday to represent the hill of Golgotha in Jerusalem , when the Pope would lead a procession to the summit and placed crosses to represent those of Jesus and the two thieves crucified alongside him . Monte Testaccio is still crowned with a cross in commemoration of the event . It was not until after World War II that the area around the hill was redeveloped as a working class neighbourhood . 
 The first archaeological investigation of Monte Testaccio began in January 1872 under the German archaeologist Heinrich Dressel , who published his results in a pioneering study in 1878 . Further important work was carried out in the 1980s by the Spanish archaeologists Emilio Rodríguez Almeida and José <unk> Almeida . 
 = Tabley House = 
 Tabley House is a former stately home in Tabley Inferior ( Nether Tabley ) , some 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) to the east of the town of Knutsford , Cheshire , England . The house is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building . It was built between 1761 and 1769 for Sir Peter Byrne Leicester , to replace an older hall nearby ( Tabley Old Hall ) , and was designed by John Carr . 
 In the early part of the 19th century three of Carr 's rooms on the west side of the house were converted to form a single room , the gallery . After Sir Peter 's death the house was re @-@ orientated and the main entrance moved from the south to the north front . The house and estate continued to be held by the Leicester family until the death of Lt. Col. John Leicester Warren in 1975 . 
 Under the terms of his will the house , contents and estate were offered to the National Trust who declined the offer . The house was then acquired under the terms of the will by the Victoria University of Manchester , and the house was used as a school . Since 1988 its lease has been held by a healthcare company . The 3600 @-@ acre estate surrounding the house was sold in 2007 to the Crown Estate . 
 The house is symmetrical and designed in Palladian style . It is constructed in brick with stone dressings , with a large sandstone portico on the south front . On the east and west sides of the main house are pavilion wings connected to the house by curved corridors . To the west of the house is St Peter 's Church , also listed Grade I , which was moved from a position adjacent to Tabley Old Hall to its present site in 1927 . In the grounds are other listed buildings , including the ruins of the Old Hall . 
 As of 2012 the ground and top floors of the main house , together with the adjacent wings , are used as accommodation for the elderly . The reception rooms of the first floor are open to the public at advertised times , and are entered by the original stairway on the south front ; they contain paintings and furniture collected by the Leicester family . Some items in the collection had formerly been displayed on this floor , whilst others were moved from elsewhere in the house . The first floor may also be hired for weddings , meetings , and conferences . It is managed by a trust , which is supported by a group of Friends and by volunteers .

 = = = Old Hall = = = 
 The original house was built on an island in Nether Tabley Mere , known as the Moat , in about 1380 by John de Leycester . The house contained a Great Hall with a large central arch formed by two massive cruck beams , which were carved to imitate Gothic stonework . During the 16th century Adam de Leycester made alterations to the hall , and built a half @-@ timbered gatehouse to the bridge crossing the mere . Peter Leycester ( 1588 – 1647 ) installed an ornate chimneypiece dated 1619 in the Great Hall . 
 In 1671 his son , the historian Sir Peter Leycester , 1st Baronet ( 1614 – 78 ) , enlarged the house , adding a staircase and an upper storey . He arranged for the exterior to be encased in brick in Jacobean style , with a mixture of mullioned and round windows , and a porch with statues of lions . In 1674 Sir Peter replaced the chapel adjacent to the hall , designed in a mixture of Gothic and Jacobean styles , and a tower was added to the chapel in 1724 . 
 After the new house was built in the 1760s , the Old Hall continued to be furnished , and the chapel was used for family worship . But in 1927 part of the hall collapsed because of subsidence resulting from the extraction of brine nearby . The building was abandoned , and is now a ruin . The chapel ( now known as St Peter 's Church ) was demolished and rebuilt near to the west front of the new house . The ornate chimneypiece was moved and reinstalled in the Old Hall Room on the west side of the house . 
 = = = Present house = = = 
 The present house was built by Sir Peter Byrne Leicester . He inherited the estate through his mother 's line on the death of his grandfather in 1742 , at which time he was aged 10 . At this time his name was Peter Byrne , and the name of Leicester was added by an Act of Parliament in 1744 . One of the requirements of his inheritance was to keep the Old Hall in good condition , but Sir Peter considered it to be " old and not commodious " . When he came of age in 1753 he decided to build a new house to replace the Old Hall . The provisions of his grandfather 's will made it difficult for him to build a new house outside the parish of Nether Tabley , therefore Sir Peter decided to build it nearby in the estate , higher on the ground sloping down to the Moat . He appointed John Carr of York as architect ; building began in 1761 and was completed in about 1769 . 
 Carr designed the house in Palladian style , even though by the 1760s this style was becoming less fashionable . His design consisted of a rectangular building in three storeys , with a projecting portico on the south front , and two pavilions on each side , which were set back and approached by curved corridors . On each side of the portico was a curved stairway leading to the main middle floor , the piano nobile . As the house was originally planned , it had a central staircase , with three rooms on the south front . The middle of these rooms was the entrance hall , to the west of it was the drawing room , and to the east was the dining room . Behind the drawing room was the library , and behind the dining room was a room known as the common parlour . Across the back of the house , on this floor , there were two bedrooms and three dressing rooms . The western pavilion contained the servants ' bedrooms , and in the eastern pavilion was the kitchen . The interior of the house contained craftsmanship of a high quality . The plasterwork was created by Thomas Oliver of Warrington , the woodcarving of the doorcases and staircase was by Mathew Bertram , assisted by Daniel Shillito . Much of the furniture was made by Gillow of Lancaster . Sir Peter also commissioned a number of paintings , which included full @-@ length portraits of himself and his wife by Francis Cotes , and landscapes of the grounds and the halls by J. M. W. Turner and Richard Wilson amongst others . 
 An interest in paintings continued in the family 's next generation . Sir John Fleming Leicester , later the 1st Lord de Tabley , built a collection of modern British art that was hung in a gallery in his London house at Hill Street , Berkeley Square . In 1823 Sir John offered his collection to Lord Liverpool to form the basis of the planned National Gallery , but the offer was declined . After Sir John 's death in 1827 the best works were sold by auction and the remainder moved to Tabley , where most of them are today . Between 1808 and 1810 the three original rooms on the west side of the first floor of the house had been converted into a single tripartite room to form a picture gallery by Thomas Harrison . Further work was carried out in the room following this ; Peter Cannon Brookes , the author of the 1991 guide to the house , concludes that the final appearance of the room " dates almost entirely from 1840 – 45 " . 
 After Sir John 's death the house was structurally reorganised for George Warren , 2nd Baron de Tabley by Robert Curzon , a family friend and an " amateur architect " . The house was re @-@ orientated to move the front entrance to the north side of the house . The architecture of the north front had previously been " simple and dignified " , but it was enhanced to make its appearance more impressive . The alterations included adding rustication to the bottom storey and around the central window , and quoins to the three projecting central bays . The arms of the 2nd baron were added to the previously blank pediment , and in 1915 a small porch was built over the new entrance . The south portico had become redundant , other than serving as an entrance to the garden . The new entrance led by way of a small lobby to a new staircase up to a new entrance hall on the first floor . A new dining room was created in the northeast corner . 
 The house and estate continued to be owned by the Leicester family until the death of Lt. Col. John Leicester Warren in 1975 . The first request in his will was that the estate should if possible be taken into the care of the National Trust , but this was declined by the Trust . The executors then acted on Warren 's second request , to pass the estate to a charitable institution , and thus it came into the care of the Victoria University of Manchester . By the time of Warren 's death the manor of Nether Tabley , comprising the estate and the halls , had been owned by the Leicester family for almost exactly 700 years . Col. Leicester @-@ Warren used the house as a school from the late 1940s until the mid 1970s , after his death . In 1988 a 125 year lease of the house , the stables , and the associated buildings was sold by the university to Cygnet Health Care , on condition that the suite of rooms on the first floor of the house , and their contents , should be preserved . Between 1988 and 1990 the health care company carried out structural repairs to deal with damage caused by dry rot and the death watch beetle . The ground and top floors of the house , and the wings , have been converted into nursing accommodation , leaving the appearance of the exterior virtually unchanged . In 1990 the first floor was opened to the public under the care of the Tabley House Collection Trust . The original entrance by the stairway on the south front was re @-@ instated for this purpose . 
 In 2007 the university sold the estate - but not the house - to the Crown Estate in a deal worth " over £ 35m " . Its 3600 acres included 18 tenanted farms , 18 farmland lettings , 52 residential properties and 13 commercial leases generating a total rent roll of £ <unk> 
 = = Architecture = = 
 Tabley House was designated as a Grade I listed building on 5 March 1959 . Its architectural style is Palladian , the only 18th @-@ century Palladian country house in Cheshire . The house has three storeys ; the bottom storey is constructed in rusticated stone , with the upper storeys in Flemish bond brick with stone dressings . A Doric frieze runs around the whole building below the eaves . The roofs are in green slate with lead flashings . The south front has nine bays , the central three bays projecting forward . On each side of the central projection is a semi @-@ circular stairway leading to the middle floor . The stairway is built in rusticated stone and it has a moulded balustrade . From the top of the stairway a portico rises through the top two storeys . It consists of four columns in Doric style constructed from red Runcorn sandstone . Its tympanum contains the arms of Sir Peter Byrne Leicester and his wife , Catherine . All the windows in the ground floor are sashes with 3x2 panes and over each window there are splayed voussoirs . The central bay of the middle storey contains a doorway with an architrave and a segmental pediment carried on brackets . On each side of the door is a window with similar architraves and segmental pediments , but not carried on brackets . In the lateral three bays on each side are sash windows with 3x5 panes over which are architraves and triangular pediments . The top floor windows are also sashes , these having 3x3 panes , and architraves with scrolls at the top and bottom . 
 The north front is also symmetrical and is in seven bays , with the central three projecting slightly forwards . Over the bays is a pediment containing the arms of the 2nd Baron de Tabley and his wife Catherina . In the centre of the ground floor is a porch , on either side of which are two 3x2 sash windows , plus a narrow two @-@ pane window . The middle floor has a central Venetian window surrounded by a rusticated stone arch . All the other windows on this floor are 3x5 sashes ; those on each side of the central window have triangular pediments , while those in the lateral bays have horizontal architraves . The top storey has seven 3x3 sash windows ; the central three have scrolls similar to those on the south front , while the surrounds to the lateral two windows on each side are plainer . 
 On each side elevation there are central canted bay windows . The middle floor has arched windows on the west front , while the corresponding windows on the east front are blind . On each side of the house are two @-@ storey pavilion wings joined to the main block by quadrant ( curved ) , single @-@ storey corridors . Each pavilion is symmetrical and identical , built in brick with stone dressings . Each is in three bays , the central bay forming a canted bay window . Again , the windows are sashes . 
 To the east of the house , and linked to it by the Old Hall Room , is St Peter 's Chapel . Incorporated in the Old Hall Room is the painted and gilded wooden chimney @-@ piece from the Old Hall , which had been installed in the Old Hall by Sir Peter Leycester in 1619 . It includes carvings of caryatids , statues of Lucretia and Cleopatra in niches , and a female nude lying on a skull and holding an hourglass . The windows in the Old Hall Room contain stained glass panels with various designs , including depictions of English monarchs from William II to George II . 
 = = Interior = = 
 The entrance to the first floor on the south front leads to a room now known as the Portico Room . This was the original entrance hall to the house , but as a result of the 19th @-@ century alterations it was converted into a billiard room . It was later used as a drawing room , and during the time the house was used as a school , it was the school library . From 1990 it has been restored as the entrance hall . It contains a white chimney @-@ piece and a cast iron grate . The mahogany woodwork was carved by Daniel Shillito and Mathew Bertram and the plasterwork was by Thomas Oliver . In the side walls are plaster figures of Isis and the Capitoline Flora in niches , and on the walls are plaster relief medallions representing the four seasons . Much of the furniture in the room has been moved from elsewhere in the house . The breakfast table carries the mark of the Lancaster firm of Gillow . The lantern suspended from the middle of the ceiling was made by Ince and Mayhew in about 1770 , and was restored by Plowden and Smith in 1998 . 
 To the east of the Portico Room is the Drawing Room . This was designed by Carr as the dining room , and contains a white marble chimneypiece designed by Carr . The plasterwork is again by Oliver . The furniture and paintings are original to the house . The paintings include one of John , 1st Baron Byron by William Dobson , one of his wife as Saint Catherine by Peter Lely , and two paintings by John Opie . The most important painting in the room is Tabley , the Seat of Sir J. F. Leicester , Bart : Windy Day , by J. M. W. Turner . Also in the room are two still life paintings by Thomas Lister , 4th Baron Ribblesdale , a cousin of the Leicesters . 
 The room to the north of the Drawing Room was originally the common parlour , and is now known as the Octagon Room . It provided a link between the public rooms on the south of the house and the more private rooms on the north side . Again designed by Carr , its canted corners contain china cabinets . It also contains a set of five paintings of Tabley by Anthony Devis . The ceiling has Rococo plasterwork by Oliver . This room leads to the Dining Room on the north side of the house , which contains paintings of the Leicester family . These include 3rd Lord Tabley by Frank Holl , Colonel Sir John Leicester , Bart. , and the King 's Cheshire Yeomanry Cavalry exercising on the Sands at Liverpool by George Jones , Portrait of 2nd Lord de Tabley by Margaret Carpenter , a full @-@ length Portrait of 2nd Lord de Tabley as Colonel Commandant of the Earl of Chester 's Yeomanry Cavalry by Francis Grant , Hilda , Mrs Cuthbert Leicester Warren by Simon Elwes , Lt. Colonel John Leicester Warren by Graham Rust , and Margaret Leicester Warren by Philip de László . Also in the room is Extensive Picturesque Landscape , with Gypsies by Francis Bourgeois and , over the sideboard , is the Portrait of the Prince Regent , later George IV by Thomas Lawrence and his studio . The fireplace in the Dining Room is made from Anglesey marble and was designed by George Bullock . 
 In the centre of the first floor is the Oak Hall , so @-@ called because of the oaks formerly growing on the site of the new hall . It contains a mahogany four @-@ flight staircase . The staircase has triple <unk> , and was carved by Shillito . <unk> the plasterwork is by Oliver . More family portraits hang on its walls and the hall 's contents include a hobby horse , a man trap , and an 18th @-@ century sedan chair . Also in the hall is a memorial display for Tabley House School . The other room on the north side of the house is known as the Marble Hall . This was created from Carr 's original rooms in the 19th @-@ century alterations . It contains five reliefs on its wall , one of which depicts the nine muses . 
 The west side of the first floor is occupied by the gallery , which has been described as " one of the great rooms of Cheshire " . It contains most of the finest furniture from the house . The items include mirrors and marble tops attributed to the London workshops of Thomas Chippendale , and sofas attributed to George Bullock . There is more furniture by Gillow , a " very rare " 17th @-@ century English virginal signed " Phillip Jones " , and an Italian spinet dating from about 1598 . Paintings in the gallery include the Portrait of Sir John Fleming Leicester , 1st Lord de Tabley , in Peer 's Robes , started by Joshua Reynolds and completed by James Northcote , and Portrait of Georgiana Maria Lady Leicester by Lawrence . There are more paintings by Northcote and Lawrence , and others by James Ward , Julius Caesar Ibbetson , William Hilton , Charles Robert Leslie , Francis Cotes , Henry Fuseli , Augustus Wall <unk> , and George Henry Harlow .

 The grounds cover an area of about 240 hectares ( 590 acres ) and are listed Grade II in the English Heritage Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England . What remains of Tabley Old Hall consists of its shell in three storeys , constructed in red English garden wall bond brick with stone dressings . The ruin is listed at Grade II * , and its moated site and gatehouse are a scheduled monument . To the north of the Old Hall is Moat Farm . One of the farm buildings , dating from the mid @-@ 17th century , is listed at Grade II . By Tabley Mere is a boathouse in brick with stone dressings , but lacking a roof , in Gothic style ; it is listed at Grade II . On an island in the mere is a folly tower , dating from about 1780 , constructed in red brick . It is a circular structure in three storeys , with machicolations and battlements at its summit . The folly is also listed at Grade II . 
 To the north of Tabley House , off Chester Road , are two entrance lodges , each of which is listed at Grade II . The White Lodge dates from about 1770 and was probably designed by John Carr . It is constructed in whitewashed English garden wall bond brick with a slate roof . The Red Lodge dates from the late 19th century ; it is constructed in English garden wall bond brick with timber framing , and has a tiled roof . St Peter 's Church to the west of the house is a Grade I listed building . It is joined to the house by a linking building , constructed in 1927 – 29 in red Flemish bond brick with stone dressings and a stone slate roof . The linking building is listed at Grade II . To the south of the house is a sundial dating from the early 19th century constructed in stone with a copper dial and gnomon ; it is listed at Grade II . To the south of this is a parterre wall , about 1 metre ( 3 ft ) high , constructed in red Flemish bond brick , with piers carrying stone balls . It is also listed at Grade II . 
 To the north of the house is the former stable block dating from about 1760 , designed by John Carr . It was converted and extended in 1995 – 96 . The block is constructed in red brick with stone dressings and green slate roofs . Although it has been altered since it was originally built , it has maintained its Grade II listing for its " group value " , recognising " the importance of its massing and exterior character to the setting of Tabley House " . To the north of the stable block is a dovecote dating from about 1760 . It is an octagonal structure in two storeys built in red brick with a slate roof , and is listed at Grade II . The grounds are promoted by the Campaign to Protect Rural England .

 The ground and top floors of the main house , and the wings , are run as Tabley House Nursing Home by Cygnet Health Care . The rooms on the first floor , with their collection of paintings and furniture , have been open to the public since 1990 . These rooms are open at advertised times during the summer months , as is the Tea Room in the Old Hall Room . The hall is licensed for civil weddings and is available to hire for conferences and meetings . Occasional events are organised at the house . Tabley House is managed by the Tabley House Collection Trust . It is supported by a group known as The Friends of Tabley , and by volunteers . 
 = Gettysburg Cyclorama = 
 The Battle of Gettysburg , also known as the Gettysburg Cyclorama , is a cyclorama painting by the French artist Paul Philippoteaux depicting Pickett 's Charge , the climactic Confederate attack on the Union forces during the Battle of Gettysburg on July 3 , 1863 . Four versions were painted , two of which are among the last surviving cycloramas in the United States . 
 The first version of the painting , completed in 1883 and originally exhibited in Chicago , was lost for some time . It was rediscovered in 1965 and purchased by a group of North Carolina investors in 2007 for an undisclosed amount . Until November 2005 , the second painting , originally exhibited in the Cyclorama Building in Boston , was on display at the Gettysburg National Military Park . It was removed for restoration work and the exhibition was reopened September 2008 in the new Gettysburg Museum and Visitor Center . The third version , exhibited in Philadelphia , is known to have been destroyed . The location of the fourth version , originally exhibited in Brooklyn , is unknown . 
 = = Description = = 
 The painting is the work of French artist Paul Dominique Philippoteaux . It depicts Pickett 's Charge , the failed infantry assault that was the climax of the Battle of Gettysburg . The painting is a cyclorama , a type of 360 ° cylindrical painting . The intended effect is to immerse the viewer in the scene being depicted , often with the addition of foreground models and life @-@ sized replicas to enhance the illusion . Among the sites documented in the painting are Cemetery Ridge , the Angle , and the " High @-@ water mark of the Confederacy " . The completed original painting was 22 feet ( 6 @.@ 7 m ) high and 279 feet ( 85 m ) in circumference . The version that hangs in Gettysburg , a recent ( 2005 ) restoration of the version created for Boston , is 42 feet ( 13 m ) high and 377 feet ( 115 m ) in circumference .

 = = Development = = 
 Philippoteaux became interested in cycloramas and , in collaboration with his father , created The Defence of the Fort d 'Issy in 1871 . Other successful works included Taking of Plevna ( Turko @-@ Russian War ) , the Passage of the Balkans , The Belgian Revolution of 1830 , Attack in the Park , The Battle of Kars , The Battle of Tel @-@ el @-@ Kebir , and the <unk> Sortie . He was commissioned by a group of Chicago investors in 1879 to create the Gettysburg Cyclorama . He spent several weeks in April 1882 at the site of the Gettysburg Battlefield to sketch and photograph the scene , and extensively researched the battle and its events over several months . He erected a wooden platform along present @-@ day Hancock Avenue and drew a circle around it , eighty feet in diameter , driving stakes into the ground to divide it into ten sections . Local photographer William H. Tipton took three photographs of each section , focusing in turn on the foreground , the land behind it , and the horizon . The photos , pasted together , formed the basis of the composition . Philippoteaux also interviewed several survivors of the battle , including Union generals Winfield S. Hancock , Abner Doubleday , Oliver O. Howard , and Alexander S. Webb , and based his work partly on their recollections . 
 Philippoteaux enlisted a team of five assistants , including his father until his death , to create the final work . It took over a year and a half to complete . The finished painting was nearly 100 yards long and weighed six tons . When completed for display , the full work included not just the painting , but numerous artifacts and sculptures , including stone walls , trees , and fences . The effect of the painting has been likened to the nineteenth century equivalent of an IMAX theater . 
 = = Exhibition and reception = = 
 The work opened to the public in Chicago on October 22 , 1883 , to critical acclaim . General John Gibbon , one of the commanders of the Union forces who repelled Pickett 's Charge , was among the veterans of the battle who gave it favorable reviews . So realistic was the painting that many veterans of the war were reported to have wept upon seeing it . 
 The Chicago exhibition was sufficiently successful to prompt businessman Charles L. Willoughby to commission a second version , which opened in Boston , Massachusetts , on December 22 , 1884 . From its opening until 1892 , approximately 200 @,@ 000 people viewed the painting . The Boston version was housed in a specially designed building , the Cyclorama Building , on Tremont Street , and was the site of popular public lectures on the battle . Two additional copies of the cyclorama were made : the third was first exhibited in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , beginning in February 1886 and a fourth debuted in Brooklyn , New York , in October 1886 . 
 Many reviewers and visitors agreed with the Boston Daily Advertiser that " it is impossible to tell where reality ends and the painting begins . " One veteran , pointing at the painting , said to his friend : " You see that puff of smoke ? Just wait a moment till that clears away , and I 'll show you just where I stood . " In New York , police responding to a report of a nighttime burglary and disoriented by the illusion twice seized dummies representing dead soldiers , convinced that they were live burglars . 
 In 1894 , Chase & Everhart displayed their " Cyclorama of the Battle of Gettysburg " during a National Guard encampment at Gettysburg . 
 = = Boston version = = 
 In 1891 , the Boston cyclorama , housed in the Cyclorama Building , was exchanged temporarily with the cyclorama Crucifixion of Christ in Philadelphia . When it returned in 1892 , it was stored in a 50 @-@ foot ( 15 m ) crate behind the exhibition hall , where it was subjected to damage from weather , vandals removing boards from the crate , and two fires . It was eventually purchased in its deteriorated state by Albert J. <unk> of Newark , New Jersey , in 1910 . <unk> displayed sections of the cyclorama in his department store in Newark beginning in 1911 , and sections were also shown in government buildings in New York City , Baltimore , Maryland , and Washington , D.C. In the Baltimore exhibition , George E. Pickett 's widow , " Sallie " Pickett , lectured on her husband 's experiences and found herself very moved by the experience . 
 On September 3 , 1912 , ground was broken for a new cyclorama building on Baltimore Street in Gettysburg , on Cemetery Hill ( on the site of the present day Holiday Inn ) , near the entrance to the Soldiers ' National Cemetery . It opened to the public in 1913 , in time for the 50th anniversary of the battle , once again displayed as a full circular painting , rather than in sections . The unheated , leaky brick building took a further toll on the condition of the painting . The Boston cyclorama was purchased by the National Park Service in 1942 , and moved to a site on Ziegler 's Grove near the new Visitor 's Center in 1961 , after a second round of restoration . 
 The exhibition remained open to the public until 2005 , when it was closed for a third restoration . The $ 12 @-@ million restoration , by Olin Conservation , Inc . , of Great Falls , Virginia , started with the 26 sections of the painting and recreated its original shape of 14 panels hung from a circular railing , slightly flared out at the bottom . In the process , some original pieces were found of the 12 circumferential feet that had been cut away . Fourteen vertical feet of sky was also restored . 
 The painting restoration was accompanied by the construction of a facility to house the painting , the new Gettysburg Museum and Visitor Center on Hunt Avenue , located away from any areas in which fighting occurred in 1863 . The restored Cyclorama exhibition was reopened to the public in September 2008 . The proposed demolition of the old Cyclorama building in Ziegler 's Grove has been a source of some controversy among history and architecture buffs , with some opposing the destruction of the modernist structure designed by architect Richard Neutra . 
 = = Chicago version = = 
 The original Chicago work went on a tour of eight cities before returning to Chicago in 1933 where it was displayed at the World 's Fair . It was in a warehouse until it was purchased by Winston @-@ Salem , North Carolina , artist and collector Joseph Wallace King in 1965 . King had first seen the painting in 1933 at the Chicago World 's Fair . Years later he described the painting and how magnificent it was seeing it displayed in Chicago to his friend Ed Grout of Maryland . Mr. Grout arranged a meeting with the nephew of George McConnel and the painting was purchased by Mr. King . King appeared on the panel game show I 've Got A Secret on May 30 , 1966 , displaying a 22 ' by 25 ' section of the painting ( his secret was that this was only part of the painting ) . It was revealed that King had been searching for it for some time , and now that he 'd found it , he hoped to construct a new cyclorama building . 
 When King bought the painting it consisted of 13 panels sewn together and rolled into one piece . To more easily store and transport the painting King unstitched the 13 panels and stored them individually together with two separate panels of scenery used to make the painting a bit longer depending on the exhibition space . The 13 panels along with the two extra scenery panels bring the painting to 410 feet long according to King . The painting has , for the most part , remained rolled up since 1933 , though it was donated by King to Wake Forest University upon his death in 1996 . The university sold the painting in 2007 to an anonymous group of Raleigh , North Carolina , investors . The painting has been appraised at a value of US $ 5 @.@ 5 million , but the value of the sale remains unknown . The group intends to resell the painting to a new buyer who will commit to restoring the work and building a suitable structure to house it . 
 = GateKeeper ( roller coaster ) = 
 GateKeeper is a steel roller coaster located at Cedar Point in Sandusky , Ohio . Designed by Bolliger & Mabillard ( B & M ) , it was the fifth Wing Coaster installation in the world . The ride opened on May 11 , 2013 , on the most successful opening weekend to date in the park 's history . GateKeeper features the highest inversion in the world , with its 170 @-@ foot ( 52 m ) Wing Over drop . It has broken several Wing Coaster records , including those for height , speed , track length , drop height and number of inversions . The coaster has a 170 ft ( 52 m ) , 40 @-@ degree inclined lift hill with a 164 ft ( 50 m ) drop and features two support towers with keyhole elements that the trains travel through . Its top speed is approximately 67 mph ( 108 km / h ) . 
 Construction began in September 2012 and took roughly eight months to complete . The park built a new entrance plaza featuring the keyhole towers as the centerpiece . The roller coaster replaced Disaster Transport and Space Spiral , both demolished during the summer of 2012 , bringing Cedar Point back to its former total of 16 roller coasters . It was Cedar Point 's first new roller coaster since Maverick debuted in 2007 , and the third B & M coaster in the park following Raptor ( 1994 ) and Mantis ( 1996 ) . In 2013 , GateKeeper was the most frequently @-@ ridden roller coaster at Cedar Point , and it ranked 28th among steel roller coasters in the annual Golden Ticket Awards poll from Amusement Today . 
 = = History = = 
 Discussions about a new roller coaster began under former Cedar Fair CEO Dick Kinzel in 2011 , who credits his successor Matt Ouimet with the project . The first concept of GateKeeper was created at the 2011 International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions ( IAAPA ) Expo . On April 24 , 2012 , Ouimet said at an Erie County Chamber of Commerce meeting that there would be $ 25 million in capital expenditures for Cedar Point in 2013 . On May 30 , 2012 , the Sandusky Register reported that a memo written by Ouimet to Cedar Fair 's board of directors on February 15 , 2012 , stated that a new Wing Coaster code @-@ named " CP Alt . Winged " would be introduced in 2013 . It also mentioned that the new coaster would set Wing Coaster records for drop , speed , and length , and that it would have a " Front Gate Statement " explained as a strong presence at the entrance to the park . In addition to traveling over the front entrance , part of the track would also cross over portions of the parking lot . Details claimed the ride would be 170 feet ( 52 m ) high , and that both Disaster Transport and Space Spiral would need to be removed to accommodate the new attraction . 
 As part of Gatekeeper 's marketing campaign , Cedar Point released several teasers on their " <unk> " blog . Posters scattered throughout the park and on Cedar Point 's website included taglines such as , " How do you recover from a Disaster ? " , " WildCat is no match for this creature " and " Not even a Jumbo Jet soars like this ! " Each poster had a black background with five blue wings , hinting at the ride 's logo . Annie <unk> , a marketing representative for the park , stated that some of the clues on the website were intended to mislead readers . On August 3 , 2012 , Cedar Point launched a countdown clock on their Facebook page , letting the public know when the next major announcement was scheduled . The page said , " We can 't keep it locked away much longer ... Join us outside the Main Gate at 3 : 30 pm on August 13 , where all we 've kept hidden will be set free ! " 
 On August 13 , 2012 , Cedar Point officially announced GateKeeper with specifications that confirmed the report leaked earlier by Sandusky Register — a 170 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 52 m ) Wing Coaster that would be manufactured by B & M. The announcement included a Halloween Haunt @-@ like creature speaking to guests atop the main gate at the park 's main entrance . A trademark application was filed for the name GateKeeper the same day . Rob Decker said , " GateKeeper is truly an innovation in thrills . Every twist , turn and near @-@ miss element was created exclusively for Cedar Point . " 
 In its first complete test , the roller coaster completed its first full @-@ circuit ride on April 4 , 2013 . Hundreds of tests were conducted prior to inspections and approval for operation . On April 10 , Cedar Point launched an online auction in which bidders could bid to become one of the first 64 people to ride GateKeeper after it opened to the public . The Cleveland Clinic Children ’ s Hospital and United Way of Erie County each had 32 seats available in separate auctions , and proceeds were shared between the organizations . Media day for GateKeeper was held on May 9 , and the ride debuted to the public on opening day , May 11 .

 On July 13 , 2012 , Cedar Point announced the closure of Disaster Transport and Space Spiral . Disaster Transport closed on July 29 , 2012 and dismantling began on August 6 , starting in the back of the building . Space Spiral was demolished on September 12 , 2012 by imploding the base and letting the tower fall towards the beach . Construction of GateKeeper started in mid @-@ September and the first footers were poured on October 2 . Approximately 200 footers were dug , each about 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) deep . The first pieces of track were delivered on October 23 and the installation of the track and supports , starting with the station , began on November 5 . The lift hill was topped off on November 30 . A construction update on January 7 , 2013 , said that approximately 40 % of the ride 's structure , including the Wing Over Drop , Immelmann and Camelback elements , had been completed . The first pieces of the two keyhole towers arrived on January 23 , and the first keyhole tower was erected on January 29 . On February 27 , 2013 , at approximately 2 pm , the final piece of GateKeeper was put in place about two weeks ahead of schedule . 
 Building the coaster took about eight months , and nearly 100 workers from four engineering companies worked on the project . Sherrod Brown , a United States Senator from Ohio , praised Cedar Point for using local companies for the job . A.A. Boos & Sons did the groundwork , including the footers and cement pouring . Tony <unk> Architects designed , engineered and installed the two keyhole towers . The electrical work , including the lighting , was done by Firelands Electric . The station and gift shop were built by Bert Witte Contractors , S.A. Comunal installed the plumbing and air systems and Lew ’ s Construction built the park 's new entrance plaza . About 12 million pounds ( 5 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 kilograms ) of concrete was used for the ride .

 GateKeeper 's entrance plaza is located along the beach next to one of Wicked Twister 's towers . A sculpture with the GateKeeper logo is in the center of the plaza . The queue runs parallel to the beach , under the lift hill and station . Once under the station , riders can choose which side of the train they would like to ride . GateKeeper uses the Fast Lane queuing system ; visitors can buy a wristband that allows them to wait in a short line .

 After leaving the station , the train turns 180 degrees to the right , then begins to climb the chain lift hill at 40 degrees . Once the train reaches the top of the 170 @-@ foot ( 52 m ) lift , it enters the first element called the " Wing Over Drop " . The train rotates 180 degrees before descending 164 feet ( 50 m ) in a half loop . During this drop , the train reaches 67 miles per hour ( 108 km / h ) — its maximum speed — and riders experience about 4 Gs . After leaving the first drop , the train immediately enters an Immelmann loop almost directly under the lift hill . After the loop , the train turns right into the only camelback hill , which is 105 feet ( 32 m ) high . Riders experience about two seconds of weightlessness on the hill . Next , the train goes through a giant flat spin , followed by a zero @-@ g roll which features two keyhole points as it passes through two 100 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) -tall towers . The train then returns to the ground and goes through an inclined dive loop , which is the turn @-@ around point of the roller coaster . Next , the train rotates 360 degrees in an inline twist , which passes the two towers . The train then turns slightly left before entering the mid @-@ course brake run . The train drops to the ground before ascending again and enters a 360 @-@ degree downward helix . The train then traverses a small hill before turning left into the final brake run which leads back to the station .

 GateKeeper is a Wing Coaster model manufactured by Swiss roller coaster firm Bolliger & Mabillard . It is Cedar Point 's third B & M roller coaster ; the park also has Raptor , an inverted roller coaster , and Rougarou , a floorless roller coaster . GateKeeper was the fifth Wing Coaster in the world and the third one built in the United States following X @-@ Flight at Six Flags Great America and Wild Eagle at Dollywood . 
 = = = Trains = = = 
 GateKeeper operates with three open @-@ air steel and fiberglass trains , each with eight cars of four seats each , with two on each side of the track . Each train holds 32 riders and the ride has a capacity of about 1 @,@ 710 riders per hour . Riders are restrained by flexible over @-@ the @-@ shoulder restraints and interlocking seat belts and riders are required to be between 52 inches ( 130 cm ) and 78 inches ( 200 cm ) to ride . Because the seats are on the side of the track , a cantilevered steel arm is used to support the wings . The trains are painted Sunset Gold with Zenith , Meteor , and Orion Gold accents . The fourth row of each train has extendable harnesses enabling large passengers to ride . The front of each train is shaped to resemble the head of a griffin . The griffin 's eyes and the outside seats of each row incorporate LED lighting , a first for a roller coaster at Cedar Point . The LED lights on the trains recharge while the trains are in the station . 
 = = = Track = = = 
 GateKeeper 's tubular steel track is 4 @,@ 164 feet ( 1 @,@ 269 m ) long and the lift is approximately 170 feet ( 52 m ) high . The track is Azure Blue ( dark blue ) and Strata Blue ( light blue ) , and the supports are white . There are 102 track pieces , each weighing approximately 7 @,@ 500 pounds ( 3 @,@ 400 kg ) . Unlike Raptor and Rougarou , the track and supports are filled with sand to reduce the noise as the ride traverses the main entrance . The track and supports were manufactured by Clermont Steel Fabricators in Batavia in southwest Ohio . 
 Clermont also manufactured the two keyhole towers . Each tower is 100 feet ( 30 m ) tall ; 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) is the concrete foundation and 75 feet ( 23 m ) is steel . At the Great Ohio Coaster Club holiday tour , Ed <unk> — Cedar Point ’ s Director of Maintenance and New Construction — stated the original plan was to have the towers ' supports encased by an outer shell ; however , Cedar Point went back to B & M , and decided to build a steel structure to serve as the keyhole element and the supports . Each half of the tower weighs about 65 @,@ 000 pounds ( 29 @,@ 000 kg ) .

 GateKeeper broke several world records . Among Wing Coasters , it became the longest and fastest , featured the longest drop , and contained the most inversions . It also set a new record for highest inversion of any roller coaster in the world , surpassing Volcano , The Blast Coaster at Cedar Point 's sister park , Kings Dominion .

 GateKeeper has received mostly positive reviews from the media and public . Some riders complained about the shoulder restraints becoming too tight while sitting in the brake run at the end of the ride . Others praised the near @-@ miss elements ; one woman said , " It feels like you 're going to get your knees chopped off and your head chopped off . " Many guests also praised the smoothness of the ride and how the renovated main entrance is very appealing . On GateKeeper 's opening weekend , Cedar Point achieved its most successful opening weekend in the history of the park , due to the popularity of GateKeeper . 
 On July 17 , 2013 , GateKeeper 's millionth rider received $ 500 to spend at the park , a VIP tour of the park and exclusive access to GateKeeper for the rest of the 2013 season . The park 's spokesman Bryan Edwards said , " We are giving approximately 1 @,@ 600 rides per hour . It has definitely been a huge success for the park . Our guests love GateKeeper . " It finished the season with just over 2 @.@ 1 million riders , the most of any ride in 2013 .

 A Contract with God and Other Tenement Stories is a graphic novel by American cartoonist Will Eisner published in 1978 . The book 's short story cycle revolves around poor Jewish characters who live in a tenement in New York City . Eisner produced two sequels set in the same tenement : A Life Force in 1988 , and Dropsie Avenue in 1995 . Though the term " graphic novel " did not originate with Eisner , the book is credited with popularizing its use . 
 Four stand @-@ alone stories make up the book : in " A Contract with God " a religious man gives up his faith after the death of his young adopted daughter ; in " The Street Singer " a has @-@ been diva tries to seduce a poor , young street singer , who tries to take advantage of her in turn ; a bullying racist is led to suicide after false accusations of pedophilia in " The Super " ; and " Cookalein " intertwines the stories of several characters vacationing in the Catskill Mountains . The stories are thematically linked with motifs of frustration , disillusionment , violence , and issues of ethnic identity . Eisner uses large , monochromatic images in dramatic perspective , and emphasizes the caricatured characters ' facial expressions ; few panels or captions have traditional borders around them . 
 Eisner began his comic book career in 1936 and had long held artistic ambitions for what was perceived as a lowbrow medium . He found no support for his ideas , and left the world of commercial comics after ending his signature work The Spirit in 1952 . The growth of comics fandom convinced him to return in the 1970s , and he worked to realize his aspirations of creating comics with literary content . He wanted a mainstream publisher for the book and to have it sold in traditional bookstores , rather than in comic book shops ; the small press Baronet Books released A Contract with God in 1978 and marketed it as a " graphic novel " , which thereafter became the common term for book @-@ length comics . It sold slowly at first , but gained respect from Eisner 's peers , and since has been reprinted by larger publishers . A Contract with God cemented Eisner 's reputation as an elder statesman of comics , and he continued to produce graphic novels and theoretical works on comics until his death in 2005 . 
 = = Content and plot summaries = = 
 A Contract with God mixes melodrama with social realism . Following an author 's introduction , " A Tenement in the Bronx " , the book contains four stories set in a tenement building ; they derive in part from Eisner 's personal memories growing up in a tenement in the Bronx . With A Contract with God he aimed to explore an area of Jewish @-@ American history that he felt was <unk> , while showing that comics was capable of mature literary expression , at a time when it received little such regard as an artistic medium . In the preface he stated his aim to keep the exaggeration in his cartooning within realistic limits . 
 The story " A Contract with God " drew from Eisner 's feelings over the death at sixteen of his daughter Alice . In his introduction to the 2006 edition of the book , Eisner first wrote about it and the feelings he felt toward God that were reflected in the story . " The Street Singer " and " The Super " are fiction , but sprang from Eisner 's memories of people he had met in the tenements of his youth . " Cookalein " was the most autobiographical — the main character " Willie " even carries Eisner 's own boyhood nickname . Eisner remarked that " it took a lot of determination , a kind of courage , to write that story " . 
 The stories ' sexual content is prominent , though not in the gratuitous manner of underground comix ' celebration of hedonism , which contrasted with the conservative lifestyle of Eisner the middle @-@ aged businessman . Eisner used no profanity in the book , and according to critic Josh Lambert the sex in Contract is not so much erotic as disturbing , the characters frustrated or filled with guilt .

 In Russia , the young , deeply religious Hasidic Jew Frimme Hersh carves a contract with God on a stone tablet to live a life of good deeds ; he attributes to it his later success in life . He moves to New York , into a tenement building at 55 Dropsie Avenue , and lives a simple life devoted to God . He adopts an infant girl , <unk> , who is abandoned on his doorstep . When she dies of a sudden illness , Hersh is infuriated , and accuses God of violating their contract . He abandons his faith , shaves his beard , and lives a life as a miserly businessman in a penthouse with a gentile mistress . He illicitly uses a synagogue 's bonds that were entrusted to him to buy the tenement building in which he had lived when poor . He becomes dissatisfied with his new way of life , and decides that he needs a new contract with God to fill the emptiness he feels . He has a group of rabbis draw up a new contract , but when he returns home with it , his heart fails and he dies . A boy , <unk> , finds Hersh 's old contract , and signs his own name to it . Eisner appended a page to the 2006 edition , depicting <unk> ascending the stairs to the tenement . 
 Eisner called the story 's creation " an exercise in personal anguish " as he was still grieved and angered over his daughter Alice 's death from leukemia at 16 . In early sketches of the story , Eisner used her name for Hersh 's adopted daughter , and expressed his own anguish through Hersh . He stated , " [ Hersh 's ] argument with God was mine . I exorcised my rage at a deity that I believed violated my faith and deprived my lovely 16 @-@ year @-@ old child of her life at the very flowering of it . " 
 = = = " The Street Singer " = = = 
 Marta Maria , an aging opera singer , tries to seduce a young man , Eddie , whom she finds singing in the alleys between tenement buildings . She had given up her own singing career for an alcoholic husband ; she hopes to get back into show business as mentor to Eddie , and gives him money for clothes . He buys whiskey instead and returns to his pregnant wife , who herself had given up on show business for him and whom he abuses . He hopes to take advantage of Maria and build an actual singing career , but is unable to find the aging diva again — he does not know her address , and the tenement buildings appear all the same to him . 
 Eisner based the story on memories of an unemployed man who made the rounds of tenements singing " popular songs or off @-@ key operatic operas " for spare change . Eisner remembered throwing the street singer coins on occasion , and considered he " was able to immortalize his story " in " The Street Singer " .

 Those who live in the tenement at 55 Dropsie Avenue fear and mistrust their antisemitic superintendent , Mr. Scuggs . The tenant Mrs. <unk> 's young niece Rosie goes down to the his apartment and offers him a peek at her panties for a nickel . After receiving the nickel she poisons Scuggs ' dog and only companion , Hugo , and steals Scuggs 's money . He corners her in an alley , where the tenants spot him and call the police , accusing him of trying to molest a minor . Before the police can break into his apartment to arrest him , he shoots himself , embracing Hugo 's body . 
 Eisner wrote that he based the superintendent on the " mysterious but threatening custodian " of his boyhood tenement . Eisner added a page to the 2006 edition in which a " Super Wanted " sign is posted on the tenement building , following the original conclusion of Rosie counting her stolen money . 
 = = = " Cookalein " = = = 
 " Cookalein " is a story of tenants of 55 Dropsie Avenue vacationing in the country . To be alone with his mistress , a man named Sam sends his wife and children away to the Catskill Mountains , where they stay at a " cookalein " ( Yiddish : <unk> , " cook alone " , a place for boarders with access to a kitchen ) . 
 A clothing cutter named Benny and a secretary named Goldie are staying at an expensive hotel near the cookalein , both hoping to find someone rich to marry ; they mistake each other for a wealthy target , and when they discover this , Benny rapes Goldie . Herbie , an intern Goldie had earlier turned down , takes her into his care , and Benny goes on to court an heiress . An older woman seduces Sam 's fifteen @-@ year @-@ old son Willie at the cookalein ; they are discovered by her husband who , after beating her , makes love to her in front of the boy . 
 At the end of the summer , the vacationers return to Dropsie Avenue . Goldie and Herbie are engaged , and Benny believes he will be marrying into the diamond business . Willie is affected by his experiences , but does not express them , and his family plan to leave the tenement . For the 2006 edition Eisner added an extra page of Willie from a rear @-@ view perspective , looking out from his balcony . 
 " Cookalein " was the most overtly autobiographical of the stories — Eisner used the real names of his family members : his parents Sam and Fannie , his brother Petey , and himself , " Willie " . Eisner called " Cookalein " " an honest account of [ his ] coming of age " that was " a combination of invention and recall " . 
 = = Background = = 
 Will Eisner was born in New York in 1917 to poor Jewish immigrants . He has said he wanted a career in the arts , but that poor Jews at the time were restricted from upper @-@ class universities where he could study it . Like others of his generation , he turned to comics as an artistic outlet , a career he began in 1936 . In the late 1930s he co @-@ owned a studio which produced content for comic books ; he left the studio in 1940 to produce his best @-@ known creation , the formally inventive The Spirit , which ran as a newspaper insert from 1940 to 1952 . After its end , Eisner withdrew from the comic book world and focused on the American Visuals Corporation , which he had founded in 1948 to produce educational and commercial comics and related media . With the rise of comics fandom in the 1970s , Eisner found there was still interest in his decades @-@ old Spirit comics , and that the fans wanted more work from him . After American Visuals went out of business in 1972 , Eisner entered a deal with underground comix publisher Denis Kitchen to reprint old Spirit stories . Other reprints followed , but Eisner was unwilling to do new Spirit stories — instead , he wanted to do something more serious , inspired in part by the wordless novels of Lynd Ward he first read in 1938 , and similar work by the Flemish Frans Masereel and the German Otto Nückel . 
 Eisner had had greater artistic ambitions for comics since his time doing The Spirit . Since the 1950s , he had been developing ideas for a book , but was unable to gain support for them , as comics was seen by both the public and its practitioners as low @-@ status entertainment ; at a meeting of the National Cartoonists Society in 1960 , Rube Goldberg rebuked Eisner 's ambitions , saying , " You are a vaudevillian like the rest of us ... don 't ever forget that ! " 
 With the critical acceptance of underground comix in the 1970s , Eisner saw a potential market for his ideas . In 1978 , he produced his first book @-@ length , adult @-@ oriented work , A Contract with God . He marketed it as a " graphic novel " — a term which had been in use since the 1960s , but was little known until Eisner popularized it with Contract . Though it was a modest commercial success , Eisner was financially independent , and soon set to work on another graphic novel Life on Another Planet , and completed eighteen further graphic novels before his 2005 death ; two featured the autobiographical Willie from the story " Cookalein " : The Dreamer ( 1986 ) and To the Heart of the Storm ( 1991 ) . 
 Eisner was brought up in a religious household , but himself was a reluctant disbeliever . In 1970 , his sixteen @-@ year @-@ old daughter Alice died after an eighteen @-@ month battle with leukemia . Eisner was enraged , and questioned how a God could let such a thing happen ; he dealt with his grief by immersing himself in his work . When working on " A Contract with God " , he tried to capture these emotions by acting out Frimme Hersh 's character in his head . 
 = = Style = = 
 The narration is lettered as part of the artwork , rather than being set apart in caption boxes , and Eisner makes little use of conventional box @-@ style panels , often avoiding panel borders entirely , delimiting spaces with buildings or window frames instead . Pages are <unk> and have large drawings which focus on facial expression . He allowed the length of the stories to develop based on their content , rather than a set page count as was traditional in comics before that time . Eisner emphasizes the urban setting with dramatic , vertical perspective , and dark artwork with much chiaroscuro , and uses visual motifs to tie the stories together . The dark , vertical rain surrounding Hersh when he buries his daughter in the first story is echoed by the revised final image of the last story , in which Willie stares out into a city sky in a similar hatched rainy " <unk> " style . The monochromatic artwork was printed in sepia tones , rather than conventional black @-@ and @-@ white . 
 In contrast to comics in the superhero genre , in which Eisner did prominent work early in his career , the characters in A Contract with God are not heroic ; they often feel frustrated and powerless , even when performing seemingly heroic deeds to help their neighbors . The characters are rendered in a caricatured manner that contrasts with the realistic backgrounds , though the backgrounds are rendered in less detail than in Eisner 's work in The Spirit ; according to writer Dennis O 'Neil , this style mimics the impressionistic sense of memory . Eisner explored these sorts of characters and situations further in his other Dropsie Avenue books , such as A Life Force . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 The stories share themes of disillusionment and frustration over thwarted desires . Frimme Hersh grieves over the death of his daughter , which he perceives as a breach of his contract with God ; street singer Eddie returns to insignificance when he finds himself unable to find his would @-@ be benefactor ; Goldie 's and Willie 's romantic ideals are disillusioned after her near @-@ rape and his seduction . Violence also ties the stories together ; Eddie 's wife @-@ beating is mirrored by the beating Willie 's seductress receives from her husband . 
 The characters are depicted neither as purely good or evil : for example , Rosie in " The Super " triumphs over the racist , abusive superintendent by stealing his money , having him framed for pedophilia , and driving him to suicide . Confinement is a prominent theme ; Eisner chooses perspectives through which the reader views the characters framed by doorways , window frames , or sheets of rain . Frimme Hersh seeks freedom from oppressive Eastern European antisemitism ; there is a feeling of elation for characters in the final story as they find their way out of the tenement 's , and the city 's , confinement . 
 According to academic Derek Royal , Jewish ethnicity is prominent throughout the stories ; in " A Contract with God " and " Cookalein " , religious and cultural Jewish <unk> are prominent , though in the middle two stories , there is little outward evidence of the characters ' Jewishness . The two outer stories further emphasize Jewish identity with the extra @-@ urban portions of their settings — the rural Russian origin of the religious Hersh in " Contract " , and the Catskill mountains in " Cookalein " , a retreat commonly associated with Jews in the 20th century . Eisner deals with representing Jewish identity through community . He juxtaposes individual stories and individual characters , who have different experiences which may be incompatible with one another ; this confounds any single definition of " Jewishness " , though there is a communal sense that binds these characters and their Jewishness together . Royal argues that Eisner shows the unresolved nature of American identity , in which ethnicities are conflicted between cultural assimilation and their ethnic associations . As the book progresses , the characters move from overt Jewishness to greater levels of assimilation , presented as an ambivalent change that has costs of its own . 
 Royal argued that the book was not only important to comics studies , but also to the study of Jewish and ethnic American literature . Much like short story cycles common to contemporary Jewish prose , in which stories can stand alone , but complement each other when read as a loosely integrated package , Royal wrote that Contract could be better described as a " graphic cycle " rather than a " graphic novel " . He wrote that such cycles , as well as Eisner 's , emphasized a heterogeneous multiplicity of perspectives , as " [ n ] o American ethnic literature can ever be defined monolithically " . 
 Art critic Peter <unk> saw the " over @-@ the @-@ topness " endemic to American comics , and Eisner 's work , as " ill suited to serious subjects , especially those that incorporate authentic social history " . The work has been criticized for its use of stereotypical imagery ; writer Jeremy Dauber countered that these images reflect Eisner 's own memories of his youth and the strictures that Jewish people felt in the tenements . Others said <unk> character designs conflicted with the otherwise realism of the stories ; the appropriateness of the style was defended by others , such as Dennis O 'Neil , who said that they better reflect the impressionistic way a child remembers the past . 
 The concept of a contract or covenant with God is fundamental to the Jewish religion . The idea that God must uphold his end of the first commandment has been a subject of works such as Elie Wiesel 's play The Trial of God ( 1979 ) , made in response to the atrocities Wiesel witnessed at Auschwitz . To art historian Matthew <unk> , <unk> 's angst regarding his relationship with God is a modern response to the questions of Hillel the Elder 's quoted in the <unk> Avot : " If I am not for myself , who will be for me ? But if I am only for myself , what am I ? And if not now , when ? " Literary scholar Susanne <unk> found Hersh 's character unrealistic from the view of Jewish scholarship . She wrote that " the suffering of the righteous " is " one of the greatest problems in Jewish thought " , and that a character as devoutly religious as Hersh would not have struggled with what she saw as elementary Jewish teaching . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 The book took two years to finish . Eisner worked through a variety of approaches and styles , and toyed with using color , overlays , or washes , before settling on a hard @-@ lined style printed in sepia . As he had no deadline , he reworked and resequenced the stories until he was satisfied . 
 Eisner intended A Contract with God to have an adult audience , and wanted it to be sold in bookstores rather than comic shops ; as such , he turned down an offer from Denis Kitchen to publish it . Though he had contacts at Bantam Books , he knew they would be uninterested in publishing comics . To secure a meeting with editor Oscar Dystel there , he called the book a " graphic novel " . When Dystel discovered that the book was actually comics , he told Eisner Bantam would not publish it , but a smaller publisher might . 
 Baronet Press , a small New York publishing house , agreed to publish A Contract with God , which bears the credit " Produced by <unk> Press " of " White Plains , N.Y. " on its indicia page . Eisner had originally intended to call the book Tenement Stories , Tales from the Bronx , or A Tenement in the Bronx but Baronet titled it A Contract with God , after the lead story , as the term " tenement " was not widely known outside the eastern US . The trade paperback carried the term " graphic novel " , though it is a collection of stories rather than a novel . As Baronet was not financially sound , Eisner loaned it money to ensure the book was published . 
 Sales were poor , but demand increased over the years . Kitchen Sink Press reissued the book in 1985 , as did DC Comics in 2001 as part of its Will Eisner Library ; and W. W. Norton collected it in 2005 as The Contract with God Trilogy in a single volume with its sequels , A Life Force ( 1988 ) and Dropsie Avenue ( 1995 ) . The Norton edition , and subsequent stand @-@ alone editions of Contract , included extra final pages to the stories . As of 2010 , at least eleven translations have been published , including in Yiddish , a language which would have been common with many of the characters in the book .

 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 A Contract with God has frequently , though erroneously , been cited as the first graphic novel ; comic book reviewer Richard Kyle had used the term in 1964 in a fan newsletter , and it had appeared on the cover of The First Kingdom ( 1974 ) by Jack Katz , with whom Eisner had corresponded . A number of book @-@ length comics preceded Contract , at least as far back as Milt Gross 's He Done Her Wrong ( 1930 ) . A Contract with God attracted greater attention than these previous efforts partly due to Eisner 's greater status in the comics community . It is considered a milestone in American comics history not only for its format , but also for its literary aspirations and for having dispensed with typical comic @-@ book genre tropes . 
 Eisner continued to produce graphic novels in a third phase to his cartooning career that ultimately lasted longer than either his periods in comic books or in educational comics . According to comics historian R. Fiore , Eisner 's work as a graphic novelist also maintained his reputation as " a contemporary figure rather than a relic of the dim past " . 
 Editor N. C. Christopher Couch considered the book 's physical format to be Eisner 's major contribution to the graphic novel form — few in comic book publishing had experience in bookmaking , whereas Eisner gained intimate familiarity with the process during his time at American Visuals . The book succeeded in getting into bookstores , though initial sales amounted to a few thousand copies in its first year ; stores had difficulty finding an appropriate section in which to shelve it . It was put on display at the Brentano 's bookstore in Manhattan , and reportedly sold well . Eisner visited the store to find out how the book was faring after being taking down from display . The manager told him it had been placed in the religious section , and then in humor , but customers had raised concerns that the book did not belong in those sections . The manager gave up and put the book in storage in the cellar . 
 Early reviews were positive . The book 's marketing consisted initially of word @-@ of @-@ mouth and in fanzines and trade periodicals , as mainstream newspapers and magazines did not normally review comics at the time . Comic book writer Dennis O 'Neil called Contract " a masterpiece " that exceeded his expectations . O 'Neil wrote that the combination of words and images mimicked the experience of remembering more accurately than was possible with pure prose . O 'Neil 's review originally appeared in The Comics Journal , and was used to preface later editions of Eisner 's book . Critic Dale Luciano called the book a " perfectly and exquisitely balanced ... masterpiece " , and praised Kitchen Sink Press for reprinting such a " risky project " in 1985 . 
 Eisner 's status as a cartoonist grew after A Contract with God appeared , and his influence was augmented by his time as a teacher at the School of Visual Arts in New York , where he expounded his theories of the medium . He later turned his lectures into the books Comics and Sequential Art ( 1985 ) — the first book in English on the formalities and of the comics medium — and Graphic Storytelling and Visual Narrative ( 1995 ) . As Eisner 's social esteem grew , a distinction developed among publishers between Eisner 's pre – and post @-@ graphic novel work ; highbrow publishers such as W. W. Norton have reissued his graphic novel work , while his superhero Spirit work has been reprinted by publishers with less social esteem such as DC Comics . The Comics Journal placed the book in 57th place on its " Top 100 English @-@ Language Comics of the Century " list , which called it " the masterpiece of one of the medium 's first true artists " . 
 Cartoonist Dave Sim praised the book and wrote that he reread it frequently , but called it " a bit illegitimate " to use the term " graphic novel " for works of such brevity ; he stated he could read the book in " twenty to thirty minutes " , which he argued amounted to " the equivalent of a twenty @-@ page short story " . 
 = = Adaptations = = 
 On July 24 , 2010 , at the San Diego Comic @-@ Con International , producers Darren Dean , Tommy Oliver , Bob Schreck , Mike <unk> , and Mark Rabinowitz announced plans for a film adaptation of A Contract with God . Darren Dean was hired to script it , with plans to have a different director for each of the four stories .

 = Artabanes ( general ) = 
 Artabanes ( Greek : <unk> , from Old Armenian <unk> , fl . 538 – 554 ) was an East Roman ( Byzantine ) general of Armenian origin who served under Justinian I ( r . 527 – 565 ) . Initially a rebel against Byzantine authority , he fled to the Sassanid Persians but soon returned to Byzantine allegiance . He served in Africa , where he won great fame by killing the rebel general Guntharic and restoring the province to imperial allegiance . He became engaged to Justinian 's niece Praejecta , but did not eventually marry her due to the opposition of the Empress Theodora . Recalled to Constantinople , he became involved in a failed conspiracy against Justinian in 548 / 549 , but was not severely punished after its revelation . He was soon pardoned and sent to Italy to fight in the Gothic War , where he participated in the decisive Byzantine victory at Casilinum . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Artabanes was a descendant of the royal Armenian Arsacid line , a branch of which at the time was recognized as autonomous local princes in the eastern fringes of the Eastern Roman Empire . His father was named John , and he had a brother also named John . 
 = = = Revolt against Byzantium = = = 
 In 538 / 539 , Artabanes , at the time apparently still a young man , took part in the Armenian conspiracy against Acacius , the proconsul of First Armenia , whose heavy taxes and cruel behaviour was greatly resented . Artabanes himself killed Acacius . Shortly after , in a skirmish between the rebels and the Byzantine army at <unk> , Artabanes may have killed the Byzantine general Sittas , sent by Justinian to quell the rebellion ( Procopius supplies two accounts , one attributing Sittas 's death to Artabanes and another to an otherwise unknown Armenian named Solomon ) . Artabanes 's father tried to negotiate a settlement with Sittas ' successor , Bouzes , but was murdered by the latter . This act forced Artabanes and his followers to seek the aid of the Sassanid Persian ruler , Khosrau I ( r . 531 – 579 ) . Crossing over to Persian territory , over the next few years Artabanes and those who followed him took part in Khosrau 's campaigns against the Byzantines . 
 = = Service in Africa = = 
 At some time around 544 , perhaps as early as 542 , Artabanes , his brother John and several other Armenians deserted back to the Byzantines . 
 Along with his brother , Artabanes was placed in command of a small Armenian contingent and sent to Africa in spring 545 under the senator Areobindus . There , the Byzantines were engaged in a protracted war with the rebellious Moorish tribes . Shortly after their arrival , John died in battle at <unk> <unk> with the rebel forces of the renegade Stotzas . Artabanes and his men remained loyal to Areobindus during the rebellion of the dux <unk> Guntharic in late 545 . Guntharic , allied with the Moorish chieftain Antalas , marched on Carthage and seized the city gates . At the urging of Artabanes and others , Areobindus decided to confront the rebel . The two armies appeared evenly matched , until Areobindus took fright and fled to a monastery seeking sanctuary . Thereupon the troops loyal to him also fled , and the city fell to Guntharic . 
 Areobindus was murdered by Guntharic , but Artabanes secured guarantees of his safety and pledged himself to Guntharic 's service . In secret , however , he began planning to overthrow him . Soon after , Artabanes was entrusted , alongside John and <unk> , with an expedition against Antalas 's Moors . He marched south , along with an allied Moorish contingent under Cutzinas . Antalas 's men fled before him , but Artabanes did not pursue them and turned back . According to Procopius , he considered leading his men to join the loyalist imperial garrison that held out at Hadrumetum under Marcentius , but decided to return to Carthage and go on with his plan to assassinate Guntharic . Artabanes kept his plan in absolute secrecy for a long time , confiding only with his two closest Armenian friends : even his Armenian unit of hand @-@ picked and completely loyal veteran soldiers was not aware of it until the very last moment . Such a perfect concealment was achieved , not least thanks to the fact that during both planning and implementation stages of this assassination the communication between the exclusively Armenian conspirators was in their mother tongue , an incomprehensible language for other ethnic elements of the imperial army in Africa . 
 Upon his return to Carthage , he justified his decision to turn back by insisting that the entire army was needed to quell the insurgents , and urged Guntharic to set forth himself . At the same time , he conspired with his nephew , Gregory , and a few other of his Armenian bodyguards to murder the usurper ( although Corippus suggests that it was the praetorian prefect Athanasius who was the real mastermind of the plot ) . On the eve of the army 's departure in early May , Guntharic hosted a great banquet , and invited Artabanes and Athanasius to share the same couch , a mark of honour . Suddenly , during the banquet , Artabanes ' Armenians fell upon Guntharic 's bodyguards , while Artabanes himself allegedly landed the killing blow on Guntharic . 
 This deed won him great honour and fame : Praejecta , the widow of Areobindus and niece of Justinian , whom Guntharic was planning to marry , gave him a rich reward , while the emperor confirmed him as magister militum of Africa . Despite being already married to a relative of his , Artabanes eventually became engaged with Praejecta . He sent her back to Constantinople and himself asked from Justinian to be recalled from Africa , so that they could marry . 
 = = Artabanes at Constantinople and the conspiracy against Justinian = = 
 Soon afterwards , Artabanes was indeed recalled to Constantinople , replaced in Africa by John Troglita . He received numerous honours from Justinian , and was named magister militum praesentalis , comes <unk> and honorary consul . Despite these and his great popularity however , he was unable to achieve his ambition of marrying Praejecta : his wife came to the imperial capital and presented her case to the Empress Theodora . The Empress compelled Artabanes to retain his wife , and not until after Theodora 's death in 548 was the Armenian general able to divorce himself . By then , however , Praejecta had already been remarried . 
 Irritated over this affair , shortly after Theodora 's death ( late 548 / early 549 ) he became involved in the so @-@ called " Armenian Plot " or " Conspiracy of Artabanes " . The real instigator , however , was a relative of his , named Arsaces , who proposed to assassinate Justinian , and elevate Justinian 's cousin Germanus on the throne instead . The conspirators thought Germanus amenable to their plans , since he had been dissatisfied with Justinian 's meddling in the settling of the will of his recently deceased brother Boraides , which had initially named Germanus as the major beneficiary as opposed to the former 's sole daughter . The conspirators approached Germanus 's son Justin first , and revealed to him the plot . Immediately , he informed his father , and he in turn informed the comes excubitorum Marcellus . In order to find out more of their intentions , Germanus met the conspirators in person , while a trusted aide of Marcellus was concealed nearby and listened in . Although Marcellus hesitated to inform Justinian without further proof , eventually he revealed the conspiracy to the emperor . Justinian ordered the conspirators imprisoned and questioned , but they were otherwise treated remarkably leniently . Artabanes was stripped of his offices and confined to the palace under guard , but was soon pardoned . 
 = = Service in Italy = = 
 In 550 , Artabanes was appointed magister militum per Thracias and sent to replace the aged senator Liberius in command of an expedition under way against Sicily , which had recently been overrun by the Ostrogoth king Totila . Artabanes failed to catch up with the expedition before it sailed for Sicily , and his own fleet was driven back and scattered by severe storms in the Ionian Sea . Eventually he arrived in Sicily and took command of the Byzantine forces there . He besieged the Gothic garrisons left behind by Totila after he left the island and soon forced them to surrender . Over the next two years , he remained in Sicily . According to Procopius , the inhabitants of the mainland city of Croton , which was being besieged by the Goths , repeatedly sent to him for help , but he did nothing . 
 In 553 , he crossed over into mainland Italy , where he joined the army of Narses as one of its generals . Facing the Frankish invasion in the summer of 553 , Narses ordered Artabanes and other generals to occupy the passes of the Apennines and harass the enemy advance ; after a Byzantine contingent was defeated at Parma , however , the other Byzantine generals withdrew to <unk> , until an envoy from Narses persuaded them to move up to the area of Parma again . In 554 , Artabanes was stationed at <unk> with Byzantine and Hunnic troops . At Fanum , he ambushed and defeated the advance guard of the Frankish army of <unk> , which was returning from a plundering expedition into southern Italy and heading back to Gaul . Most of the Franks fell , and in the confusion , the many captives escaped , taking much of the Franks ' booty with them . Artabanes did not engage the main body of <unk> ' army however , since it far outnumbered his own force . He then marched south and joined Narses 's main force , accompanying him in his campaign against the remaining Frankish army under <unk> . At the decisive Byzantine victory in the Battle of Casilinum , along with Valerian , he commanded the cavalry in the Byzantine left flank . They were concealed in the woods , as part of Narses 's stratagem to attack the Franks in the rear and encircle them . Nothing further is known of him after that . 
 = As I was going by Charing Cross = 
 " As I was going by Charing Cross " ( sometimes referred to as " As I was going to Charing Cross " ) , is an English language nursery rhyme . The rhyme was first recorded in the 1840s , but it may have older origins in street cries and verse of the seventeenth century . It refers to the equestrian statue of King Charles I in Charing Cross , London , and may allude to his death or be a puritan satire on royalist reactions to his execution . It was not recorded in its modern form until the mid @-@ nineteenth century . It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 20564 . 
 = = Lyrics = = 
 Modern versions include : 
 The Roud Folk Song Index , which catalogues folk songs and their variations by number , classifies the song as 20564 . 
 = = Origin = = 
 The rhyme is thought to refer to the equestrian statue of Charles I ( r . 1625 – 49 ) , which was erected after the Restoration in 1660 and was moved in 1675 to the site of the old Charing Cross in central London . The tarnished bronze statue is largely dark in colour , but the " black " may refer to the king 's hair colour . 
 The last line may refer to the reaction of the crowd when he was beheaded , or it may be a puritan satire on royalist reactions to the event . The rhyme may also have been produced out of a combination of existing couplets . A traditional London street cry was :

 = Grill ( jewelry ) = 
 In hip hop culture , a grill ( most commonly spelled as <unk> also fronts or golds ) is a type of jewelry worn over the teeth . Grills are made of metal and are generally removable . They began to be worn by hip hop artists in the early 1980s , and upgraded during the 90s in Oakland , but they became more widely popular during the mid @-@ 2000s due to the rise of Southern hip hop rap and the more mainstream pop culture status hip hop attained . Though grills are fitted to the tooth impression of the wearer , whether they are safe for long @-@ term wear is unknown . 
 = = Characteristics and wearer demographics = = 
 Grills are made of several types of metal ( often silver , gold or platinum ) that are sometimes inlaid with precious stones ; they are generally removable , though some may be permanently attached to the teeth . Gold grills can be made from 10 karat , up to 24 karat gold . The gold can be tinted yellow , white and rose color . 
 Grills can cost anywhere from one hundred dollars to thousands of dollars , depending on the materials used and the number of teeth covered . 
 As of 2006 , grills were most often worn by 18- to 35 @-@ year @-@ old African American male hip @-@ hop listeners , and one commentator argued that grills will never become mainstream . However , grills received mainstream attention , including on network television , when , during the 2012 Summer Olympics , Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte posed with a grill that sported stones in the design of an American flag ; he had previously worn diamond grills after earlier competitions . 
 = = History = = 
 The insertion of gems into teeth has long predated hip hop culture , with rich Mayans drilling pieces of jade into their teeth . Hip hop artists began wearing grills in the early 1980s ; New Yorker Eddie Plein , owner of Eddie 's Gold Teeth , is often credited with starting the trend . Plein made gold caps for Flavor Flav , and then outfitted New York rappers including Big Daddy Kane and Kool G. Rap . He later moved to Atlanta , where he designed ever @-@ more @-@ elaborate grills for rappers like OutKast , Goodie Mob , Ludacris , and Lil Jon . Other writers have cited Slick Rick and Afrika Bambaataa as an important early contributor to the popularity of grills . 
 Grills remained popular in the Southern U.S. , especially in Houston or Memphis , even as they rose and fell from popularity elsewhere , and the rise of Dirty South rappers in the 2000s spurred a nationwide grill trend . During this time , grills frequently appeared in hip hop music , most notably in the 2005 number one single " Grillz , " by Nelly , Paul Wall , Big Gipp , and Ali , and in other Paul Wall songs . Wall is known for his grill business as well as his rapping ; his clients include Kanye West and Cam 'ron . 
 Grills maintained their popularity into the 2010s , with French <unk> Dolly Cohen creating custom oral jewelry for Rihanna , Cara Delevingne , and Rita Ora . In 2015 , DJ Khaled created a song based around grills , " Gold Slugs " ( feat . Chris Brown , August Alsina & Fetty Wap " Gold Slugs also is used as a term similar to grills with the same meaning . 
 = = Manufacture = = 
 While early grills could not be removed easily and involved reshaping the tooth itself to fit the grill , grills are today made from custom dental molds . For more expensive grills , a dentist takes a mold of the wearer 's front teeth with a quick set alginate . A tooth mold is obtained by filling the alginate negative with buff stone , then the buff stone is used to fit the grill to the unique set of teeth . However , for inexpensive novelty grills , a jeweler may make an impression by having the wearer bite into dental putty or wax softened in water , or the wearer may do this himself . Such grills may be less comfortable or dependable than grills that are professionally fitted , and in several instances jewelers manufacturing grills in this manner have been charged with practicing dentistry without a license . 
 = = Criticism and health hazards = = 
 According to the American Dental Association in June 2006 , no studies have shown whether the long @-@ term wearing of grills is safe . If the grills fit properly and are worn only intermittently , wearers are at a low risk for dental problems , according to the ADA . The ADA has warned , however , that grills made from base metals could cause irritation or allergic reactions , and that bacteria trapped under a grill worn on a long @-@ term basis could result in gum disease , cavities , or even bone loss . School districts in Alabama , Georgia , and Texas have banned grills for reasons both disciplinary and health @-@ related . 
 Just as other hip hop fashions have been criticized , grills have been denounced by some commentators as expensive , ostentatious , and superficial displays that strain the finances of poor youth . 
 = White dwarf = 
 A white dwarf , also called a degenerate dwarf , is a stellar remnant composed mostly of electron @-@ degenerate matter . A white dwarf is very dense : its mass is comparable to that of the Sun , while its volume is comparable to that of Earth . A white dwarf 's faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy ; no fusion takes place in a white dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy . The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B , at 8 @.@ 6 light years , the smaller component of the Sirius binary star . There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun . The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910 . The name white dwarf was coined by Willem Luyten in 1922 . The universe has not existed long enough to experience a white dwarf releasing all of its energy as it will take close to a trillion years . 
 White dwarfs are thought to be the final evolutionary state of stars whose mass is not high enough to become a neutron star , including the Earth 's Sun and over 97 % of the other stars in the Milky Way . , § 1 . After the hydrogen @-@ fusing period of a main @-@ sequence star of low or medium mass ends , such a star will expand to a red giant during which it fuses helium to carbon and oxygen in its core by the triple @-@ alpha process . If a red giant has insufficient mass to generate the core temperatures required to fuse carbon , around 1 billion K , an inert mass of carbon and oxygen will build up at its center . After a star sheds its outer layers and forms a planetary nebula , it will leave behind this core , which is the remnant white dwarf . Usually , therefore , white dwarfs are composed of carbon and oxygen . If the mass of the progenitor is between 8 and 10 @.@ 5 solar masses ( M ☉ ) , the core temperature is sufficient to fuse carbon but not neon , in which case an oxygen – neon – magnesium white dwarf may form . Stars of very low mass will not be able to fuse helium , hence , a helium white dwarf may form by mass loss in binary systems . 
 The material in a white dwarf no longer undergoes fusion reactions , so the star has no source of energy . As a result , it cannot support itself by the heat generated by fusion against gravitational collapse , but is supported only by electron degeneracy pressure , causing it to be extremely dense . The physics of degeneracy yields a maximum mass for a non @-@ rotating white dwarf , the Chandrasekhar limit — approximately 1 @.@ 46 M ☉ — beyond which it cannot be supported by electron degeneracy pressure . A carbon @-@ oxygen white dwarf that approaches this mass limit , typically by mass transfer from a companion star , may explode as a type Ia supernova via a process known as carbon detonation . ( SN 1006 is thought to be a famous example . ) 
 A white dwarf is very hot when it forms , but because it has no source of energy , it will gradually radiate its energy and cool . This means that its radiation , which initially has a high color temperature , will lessen and redden with time . Over a very long time , a white dwarf will cool and its material will begin to crystallize ( starting with the core ) . The star 's low temperature means it will no longer emit significant heat or light , and it will become a cold black dwarf . The length of time it takes for a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe ( approximately 13 @.@ 8 billion years ) , and it is thought that no black dwarfs yet exist . The oldest white dwarfs still radiate at temperatures of a few thousand kelvin .

 The first white dwarf discovered was in the triple star system of 40 Eridani , which contains the relatively bright main sequence star 40 Eridani A , orbited at a distance by the closer binary system of the white dwarf 40 Eridani B and the main sequence red dwarf 40 Eridani C. The pair 40 Eridani B / C was discovered by William Herschel on 31 January 1783 ; , p . 73 it was again observed by Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve in 1825 and by Otto Wilhelm von Struve in 1851 . In 1910 , Henry Norris Russell , Edward Charles Pickering and <unk> Fleming discovered that , despite being a dim star , 40 Eridani B was of spectral type A , or white . In 1939 , Russell looked back on the discovery : , p . 1 
 I was visiting my friend and generous benefactor , Prof. Edward C. Pickering . With characteristic kindness , he had volunteered to have the spectra observed for all the stars — including comparison stars — which had been observed in the observations for stellar parallax which Hinks and I made at Cambridge , and I discussed . This piece of apparently routine work proved very fruitful — it led to the discovery that all the stars of very faint absolute magnitude were of spectral class M. In conversation on this subject ( as I recall it ) , I asked Pickering about certain other faint stars , not on my list , mentioning in particular 40 Eridani B. Characteristically , he sent a note to the Observatory office and before long the answer came ( I think from Mrs Fleming ) that the spectrum of this star was A. I knew enough about it , even in these paleozoic days , to realize at once that there was an extreme inconsistency between what we would then have called " possible " values of the surface brightness and density . I must have shown that I was not only puzzled but crestfallen , at this exception to what looked like a very pretty rule of stellar characteristics ; but Pickering smiled upon me , and said : " It is just these exceptions that lead to an advance in our knowledge " , and so the white dwarfs entered the realm of study ! 
 The spectral type of 40 Eridani B was officially described in 1914 by Walter Adams . 
 The white dwarf companion of Sirius , Sirius B , was next to be discovered . During the nineteenth century , positional measurements of some stars became precise enough to measure small changes in their location . Friedrich Bessel used position measurements to determine that the stars Sirius ( α Canis Majoris ) and Procyon ( α Canis Minoris ) were changing their positions periodically . In 1844 he predicted that both stars had unseen companions : 
 If we were to regard Sirius and Procyon as double stars , the change of their motions would not surprise us ; we should acknowledge them as necessary , and have only to investigate their amount by observation . But light is no real property of mass . The existence of numberless visible stars can prove nothing against the existence of numberless invisible ones . 
 Bessel roughly estimated the period of the companion of Sirius to be about half a century ; C. A. F. Peters computed an orbit for it in 1851 . It was not until 31 January 1862 that Alvan Graham Clark observed a previously unseen star close to Sirius , later identified as the predicted companion . Walter Adams announced in 1915 that he had found the spectrum of Sirius B to be similar to that of Sirius . 
 In 1917 , Adriaan van Maanen discovered Van Maanen 's Star , an isolated white dwarf . These three white dwarfs , the first discovered , are the so @-@ called classical white dwarfs . , p . 2 Eventually , many faint white stars were found which had high proper motion , indicating that they could be suspected to be low @-@ luminosity stars close to the Earth , and hence white dwarfs . Willem Luyten appears to have been the first to use the term white dwarf when he examined this class of stars in 1922 ; the term was later popularized by Arthur Stanley Eddington . Despite these suspicions , the first non @-@ classical white dwarf was not definitely identified until the 1930s . 18 white dwarfs had been discovered by 1939 . , p . 3 Luyten and others continued to search for white dwarfs in the 1940s . By 1950 , over a hundred were known , and by 1999 , over 2 @,@ 000 were known . Since then the Sloan Digital Sky Survey has found over 9 @,@ 000 white dwarfs , mostly new . 
 = = Composition and structure = = 
 Although white dwarfs are known with estimated masses as low as 0 @.@ 17 M ☉ and as high as 1 @.@ 33 M ☉ , the mass distribution is strongly peaked at 0 @.@ 6 M ☉ , and the majority lie between 0 @.@ 5 and 0 @.@ 7 M ☉ . The estimated radii of observed white dwarfs are typically 0 @.@ 8 – 2 % the radius of the Sun ; this is comparable to the Earth 's radius of approximately 0 @.@ 9 % solar radius . A white dwarf , then , packs mass comparable to the Sun 's into a volume that is typically a million times smaller than the Sun 's ; the average density of matter in a white dwarf must therefore be , very roughly , 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 times greater than the average density of the Sun , or approximately 106 g / cm3 , or 1 tonne per cubic centimetre . A typical white dwarf has a density of between 10 7 and 1011 kg per cubic meter . White dwarfs are composed of one of the densest forms of matter known , surpassed only by other compact stars such as neutron stars , black holes and , hypothetically , quark stars . 
 White dwarfs were found to be extremely dense soon after their discovery . If a star is in a binary system , as is the case for Sirius B or 40 Eridani B , it is possible to estimate its mass from observations of the binary orbit . This was done for Sirius B by 1910 , yielding a mass estimate of 0 @.@ 94 M ☉ . ( A more modern estimate is 1 @.@ 00 M ☉ . ) Since hotter bodies radiate more energy than colder ones , a star 's surface brightness can be estimated from its effective surface temperature , and that from its spectrum . If the star 's distance is known , its absolute ( overall ) luminosity can also be estimated . From the absolute luminosity and distance , the star 's surface area and its radius can be calculated . Reasoning of this sort led to the realization , puzzling to astronomers at the time , that Sirius B and 40 Eridani B must be very dense . When Ernst Öpik estimated the density of a number of visual binary stars in 1916 , he found that 40 Eridani B had a density of over 25 @,@ 000 times the Sun 's , which was so high that he called it " impossible " . As Arthur Stanley Eddington put it later in 1927 : , p . 50 
 We learn about the stars by receiving and interpreting the messages which their light brings to us . The message of the Companion of Sirius when it was decoded ran : " I am composed of material 3 @,@ 000 times denser than anything you have ever come across ; a ton of my material would be a little nugget that you could put in a matchbox . " What reply can one make to such a message ? The reply which most of us made in 1914 was — " Shut up . Don 't talk nonsense . " 
 As Eddington pointed out in 1924 , densities of this order implied that , according to the theory of general relativity , the light from Sirius B should be gravitationally redshifted . This was confirmed when Adams measured this redshift in 1925 . 
 Such densities are possible because white dwarf material is not composed of atoms joined by chemical bonds , but rather consists of a plasma of unbound nuclei and electrons . There is therefore no obstacle to placing nuclei closer than normally allowed by electron orbitals limited by normal matter . Eddington wondered what would happen when this plasma cooled and the energy to keep the atoms ionized was no longer sufficient . This paradox was resolved by R. H. Fowler in 1926 by an application of the newly devised quantum mechanics . Since electrons obey the Pauli exclusion principle , no two electrons can occupy the same state , and they must obey Fermi – Dirac statistics , also introduced in 1926 to determine the statistical distribution of particles which satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle . At zero temperature , therefore , electrons can not all occupy the lowest @-@ energy , or ground , state ; some of them would have to occupy higher @-@ energy states , forming a band of lowest @-@ available energy states , the Fermi sea . This state of the electrons , called degenerate , meant that a white dwarf could cool to zero temperature and still possess high energy . 
 Compression of a white dwarf will increase the number of electrons in a given volume . Applying the Pauli exclusion principle , this will increase the kinetic energy of the electrons , thereby increasing the pressure . This electron degeneracy pressure supports a white dwarf against gravitational collapse . The pressure depends only on density and not on temperature . Degenerate matter is relatively compressible ; this means that the density of a high @-@ mass white dwarf is much greater than that of a low @-@ mass white dwarf and that the radius of a white dwarf decreases as its mass increases . 
 The existence of a limiting mass that no white dwarf can exceed ( beyond which it becomes a neutron star ) is another consequence of being supported by electron degeneracy pressure . These masses were first published in 1929 by Wilhelm Anderson and in 1930 by Edmund C. Stoner . The modern value of the limit was first published in 1931 by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in his paper " The Maximum Mass of Ideal White Dwarfs " . For a non @-@ rotating white dwarf , it is equal to approximately <unk> ☉ / <unk> , where μe is the average molecular weight per electron of the star . , eq . ( 63 ) As the carbon @-@ 12 and oxygen @-@ 16 which predominantly compose a carbon @-@ oxygen white dwarf both have atomic number equal to half their atomic weight , one should take μe equal to 2 for such a star , leading to the commonly quoted value of 1 @.@ 4 M ☉ . ( Near the beginning of the 20th century , there was reason to believe that stars were composed chiefly of heavy elements , , p . 955 so , in his 1931 paper , Chandrasekhar set the average molecular weight per electron , μe , equal to 2 @.@ 5 , giving a limit of 0 @.@ 91 M ☉ . ) Together with William Alfred Fowler , Chandrasekhar received the Nobel prize for this and other work in 1983 . The limiting mass is now called the Chandrasekhar limit . 
 If a white dwarf were to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit , and nuclear reactions did not take place , the pressure exerted by electrons would no longer be able to balance the force of gravity , and it would collapse into a denser object called a neutron star . Carbon @-@ oxygen white dwarfs accreting mass from a neighboring star undergo a runaway nuclear fusion reaction , which leads to a Type Ia supernova explosion in which the white dwarf may be destroyed , before it reaches the limiting mass . 
 New research indicates that many white dwarfs — at least in certain types of galaxies — may not approach that limit by way of accretion . It has been postulated that at least some of the white dwarfs that become supernovae attain the necessary mass by colliding with one another . It may be that in elliptical galaxies such collisions are the major source of supernovae . This hypothesis is based on the fact that the X @-@ rays produced by those galaxies are 30 to 50 times less than what is expected to be produced by type Ia supernovas of that galaxy as matter accretes on the white dwarf from its encircling companion . It has been concluded that no more than 5 percent of the supernovae in such galaxies could be created by the process of accretion onto white dwarfs . The significance of this finding is that there could be two types of supernovae , which could mean that the Chandrasekhar limit might not always apply in determining when a white dwarf goes supernova , given that two colliding white dwarfs could have a range of masses . This in turn would confuse efforts to use exploding white dwarfs as standard candles in determining distances . 
 White dwarfs have low luminosity and therefore occupy a strip at the bottom of the Hertzsprung – Russell diagram , a graph of stellar luminosity versus color ( or temperature ) . They should not be confused with low @-@ luminosity objects at the low @-@ mass end of the main sequence , such as the hydrogen @-@ fusing red dwarfs , whose cores are supported in part by thermal pressure , or the even lower @-@ temperature brown dwarfs . 
 = = = Mass – radius relationship and mass limit = = = 
 The relationship between the mass and radii of white dwarfs can be derived using an energy minimization argument . The energy of the white dwarf can be approximated by taking it to be the sum of its gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy . The gravitational potential energy of a unit mass piece of white dwarf , Eg , will be on the order of − G M ∕ R , where G is the gravitational constant , M is the mass of the white dwarf , and R is its radius . 
 <formula> 
 The kinetic energy of the unit mass , Ek , will primarily come from the motion of electrons , so it will be approximately N p2 ∕ 2m , where p is the average electron momentum , m is the electron mass , and N is the number of electrons per unit mass . Since the electrons are degenerate , we can estimate p to be on the order of the uncertainty in momentum , Δp , given by the uncertainty principle , which says that Δp Δx is on the order of the reduced Planck constant , ħ . Δx will be on the order of the average distance between electrons , which will be approximately n − 1 / 3 , i.e. , the reciprocal of the cube root of the number density , n , of electrons per unit volume . Since there are N · M electrons in the white dwarf , where M is the star 's mass and its volume is on the order of R3 , n will be on the order of N M ∕ R3 . 
 Solving for the kinetic energy per unit mass , Ek , we find that 
 <formula> 
 The white dwarf will be at equilibrium when its total energy , Eg + Ek , is minimized . At this point , the kinetic and gravitational potential energies should be comparable , so we may derive a rough mass @-@ radius relationship by equating their magnitudes : 
 <formula> 
 Solving this for the radius , R , gives 
 <formula> 
 Dropping N , which depends only on the composition of the white dwarf , and the universal constants leaves us with a relationship between mass and radius : 
 <formula> 
 i.e. , the radius of a white dwarf is inversely proportional to the cube root of its mass . 
 Since this analysis uses the non @-@ relativistic formula p2 ∕ 2m for the kinetic energy , it is non @-@ relativistic . If we wish to analyze the situation where the electron velocity in a white dwarf is close to the speed of light , c , we should replace p2 ∕ 2m by the extreme relativistic approximation p c for the kinetic energy . With this substitution , we find 
 <formula> 
 If we equate this to the magnitude of Eg , we find that R drops out and the mass , M , is forced to be 
 <formula> 
 To interpret this result , observe that as we add mass to a white dwarf , its radius will decrease , so , by the uncertainty principle , the momentum , and hence the velocity , of its electrons will increase . As this velocity approaches c , the extreme relativistic analysis becomes more exact , meaning that the mass M of the white dwarf must approach a limiting mass of <unk> . Therefore , no white dwarf can be heavier than the limiting mass <unk> , or 1 @.@ 4 M ☉ . 
 For a more accurate computation of the mass @-@ radius relationship and limiting mass of a white dwarf , one must compute the equation of state which describes the relationship between density and pressure in the white dwarf material . If the density and pressure are both set equal to functions of the radius from the center of the star , the system of equations consisting of the hydrostatic equation together with the equation of state can then be solved to find the structure of the white dwarf at equilibrium . In the non @-@ relativistic case , we will still find that the radius is inversely proportional to the cube root of the mass . , eq . ( 80 ) Relativistic corrections will alter the result so that the radius becomes zero at a finite value of the mass . This is the limiting value of the mass — called the Chandrasekhar limit — at which the white dwarf can no longer be supported by electron degeneracy pressure . The graph on the right shows the result of such a computation . It shows how radius varies with mass for non @-@ relativistic ( blue curve ) and relativistic ( green curve ) models of a white dwarf . Both models treat the white dwarf as a cold Fermi gas in hydrostatic equilibrium . The average molecular weight per electron , μe , has been set equal to 2 . Radius is measured in standard solar radii and mass in standard solar masses . 
 These computations all assume that the white dwarf is non @-@ rotating . If the white dwarf is rotating , the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium must be modified to take into account the centrifugal pseudo @-@ force arising from working in a rotating frame . For a uniformly rotating white dwarf , the limiting mass increases only slightly . If the star is allowed to rotate <unk> , and viscosity is neglected , then , as was pointed out by Fred Hoyle in 1947 , there is no limit to the mass for which it is possible for a model white dwarf to be in static equilibrium . Not all of these model stars will be dynamically stable . 
 = = = Radiation and cooling = = = 
 The degenerate matter that makes up the bulk of a white dwarf has a very low opacity , because any absorption of a photon requires that an electron must transition to a higher empty state , which may not be possible as the energy of the photon may not be a match for the possible quantum states available to that electron , hence radiative heat transfer within a white dwarf is low ; it does , however , have a high thermal conductivity . As a result , the interior of the white dwarf maintains a uniform temperature , approximately 107 K. An outer shell of non @-@ degenerate matter cools from approximately 107 K to 104 K. This matter radiates roughly as a black body . A white dwarf remains visible for a long time , as its tenuous outer atmosphere of normal matter begins to radiate at about 107 K , upon formation , while its greater interior mass is at 107 K but cannot radiate through its normal matter shell . 
 The visible radiation emitted by white dwarfs varies over a wide color range , from the blue @-@ white color of an O @-@ type main sequence star to the red of an M @-@ type red dwarf . White dwarf effective surface temperatures extend from over 150 @,@ 000 K to barely under 4 @,@ 000 K. In accordance with the Stefan – Boltzmann law , luminosity increases with increasing surface temperature ; this surface temperature range corresponds to a luminosity from over 100 times the Sun 's to under 1 / 10 @,@ 000 that of the Sun 's . Hot white dwarfs , with surface temperatures in excess of 30 @,@ 000 K , have been observed to be sources of soft ( i.e. , lower @-@ energy ) X @-@ rays . This enables the composition and structure of their atmospheres to be studied by soft X @-@ ray and extreme ultraviolet observations . 
 As was explained by Leon <unk> in 1952 , unless the white dwarf accretes matter from a companion star or other source , its radiation comes from its stored heat , which is not replenished . , § 2 @.@ 1 . White dwarfs have an extremely small surface area to radiate this heat from , so they cool gradually , remaining hot for a long time . As a white dwarf cools , its surface temperature decreases , the radiation which it emits reddens , and its luminosity decreases . Since the white dwarf has no energy sink other than radiation , it follows that its cooling slows with time . The rate of cooling has been estimated for a carbon white dwarf of 0 @.@ 59 M ☉ with a hydrogen atmosphere . After initially taking approximately 1 @.@ 5 billion years to cool to a surface temperature of 7 @,@ 140 K , cooling approximately 500 more kelvins to 6 @,@ 590 K takes around 0 @.@ 3 billion years , but the next two steps of around 500 kelvins ( to 6 @,@ 030 K and 5 @,@ 550 K ) take first 0 @.@ 4 and then 1 @.@ 1 billion years . , Table 2 . 
 Most observed white dwarfs have relatively high surface temperatures , between 8 @,@ 000 K and 40 @,@ 000 K. A white dwarf , though , spends more of its lifetime at cooler temperatures than at hotter temperatures , so we should expect that there are more cool white dwarfs than hot white dwarfs . Once we adjust for the selection effect that hotter , more luminous white dwarfs are easier to observe , we do find that decreasing the temperature range examined results in finding more white dwarfs . This trend stops when we reach extremely cool white dwarfs ; few white dwarfs are observed with surface temperatures below 4 @,@ 000 K , and one of the coolest so far observed , WD <unk> + 246 , has a surface temperature of approximately 3 @,@ 900 K. The reason for this is that the Universe 's age is finite , there has not been enough time for white dwarfs to cool below this temperature . The white dwarf luminosity function can therefore be used to find the time when stars started to form in a region ; an estimate for the age of our Galactic disk found in this way is 8 billion years . A white dwarf will eventually , in many trillion years , cool and become a non @-@ radiating black dwarf in approximate thermal equilibrium with its surroundings and with the cosmic background radiation . No black dwarfs are thought to exist yet . 
 Although white dwarf material is initially plasma — a fluid composed of nuclei and electrons — it was theoretically predicted in the 1960s that at a late stage of cooling , it should crystallize , starting at its center . The crystal structure is thought to be a body @-@ centered cubic lattice . In 1995 it was suggested that <unk> observations of pulsating white dwarfs yielded a potential test of the crystallization theory , and in 2004 , observations were made that suggested approximately 90 % of the mass of BPM <unk> had crystallized . Other work gives a crystallized mass fraction of between 32 % and 82 % . As a white dwarf core undergoes crystallization into a solid phase , latent heat is released which provides a source of thermal energy that delays its cooling . 
 Low @-@ mass helium white dwarfs ( with a mass < 0 @.@ 20 M ☉ , often referred to as " extremely low @-@ mass white dwarfs , <unk> <unk> " ) are formed in binary systems . As a result of their hydrogen @-@ rich envelopes , residual hydrogen burning via the CNO cycle may keep these white dwarfs hot on a long timescale . In addition , they remain in a bloated proto @-@ white dwarf stage for up to 2 Gyr before they reach the cooling track . 
 = = = Atmosphere and spectra = = = 
 Although most white dwarfs are thought to be composed of carbon and oxygen , spectroscopy typically shows that their emitted light comes from an atmosphere which is observed to be either hydrogen or helium dominated . The dominant element is usually at least 1 @,@ 000 times more abundant than all other elements . As explained by <unk> in the 1940s , the high surface gravity is thought to cause this purity by gravitationally separating the atmosphere so that heavy elements are below and the lighter above . , § 5 – 6 This atmosphere , the only part of the white dwarf visible to us , is thought to be the top of an envelope which is a residue of the star 's envelope in the AGB phase and may also contain material accreted from the interstellar medium . The envelope is believed to consist of a helium @-@ rich layer with mass no more than 1 / 100 of the star 's total mass , which , if the atmosphere is hydrogen @-@ dominated , is overlain by a hydrogen @-@ rich layer with mass approximately 1 / 10 @,@ 000 of the stars total mass . , § 4 – 5 . 
 Although thin , these outer layers determine the thermal evolution of the white dwarf . The degenerate electrons in the bulk of a white dwarf conduct heat well . Most of a white dwarf 's mass is therefore at almost the same temperature ( isothermal ) , and it is also hot : a white dwarf with surface temperature between 8 @,@ 000 K and 16 @,@ 000 K will have a core temperature between approximately 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 K and 20 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 K. The white dwarf is kept from cooling very quickly only by its outer layers ' opacity to radiation . 
 The first attempt to classify white dwarf spectra appears to have been by G. P. Kuiper in 1941 , and various classification schemes have been proposed and used since then . The system currently in use was introduced by Edward M. Sion , Jesse L. Greenstein and their coauthors in 1983 and has been subsequently revised several times . It classifies a spectrum by a symbol which consists of an initial D , a letter describing the primary feature of the spectrum followed by an optional sequence of letters describing secondary features of the spectrum ( as shown in the table to the right ) , and a temperature index number , computed by dividing 50 @,@ 400 K by the effective temperature . For example : 
 A white dwarf with only He I lines in its spectrum and an effective temperature of 15 @,@ 000 K could be given the classification of <unk> , or , if warranted by the precision of the temperature measurement , <unk> 
 A white dwarf with a polarized magnetic field , an effective temperature of 17 @,@ 000 K , and a spectrum dominated by He I lines which also had hydrogen features could be given the classification of <unk> . 
 The symbols ? and : may also be used if the correct classification is uncertain . 
 White dwarfs whose primary spectral classification is DA have hydrogen @-@ dominated atmospheres . They make up the majority ( approximately 80 % ) of all observed white dwarfs . The next class in number is of <unk> ( approximately 16 % ) . The hot ( above 15 @,@ 000 K ) DQ class ( roughly 0 @.@ 1 % ) have carbon @-@ dominated atmospheres . Those classified as DB , DC , DO , DZ , and cool DQ have helium @-@ dominated atmospheres . Assuming that carbon and metals are not present , which spectral classification is seen depends on the effective temperature . Between approximately 100 @,@ 000 K to 45 @,@ 000 K , the spectrum will be classified DO , dominated by singly ionized helium . From 30 @,@ 000 K to 12 @,@ 000 K , the spectrum will be DB , showing neutral helium lines , and below about 12 @,@ 000 K , the spectrum will be featureless and classified DC . , § 2 @.@ 4 . 
 Molecular hydrogen ( H2 ) has been detected in spectra of the atmospheres of some white dwarfs . 
 = = = = Metal @-@ Rich White Dwarfs = = = = 
 Around 25 @-@ 33 % of white dwarfs have metal lines in their spectra , which is unusual because any heavy elements in a white dwarf should sink into the star 's interior in just a small fraction of the star 's lifetime . The prevailing explanation for metal @-@ rich white dwarfs is that they have recently accreted rocky planetesimals . The bulk composition of the accreted object can be measured from the strengths of the metal lines . For example , a 2015 study of the white dwarf Ton 345 concluded that its metal abundances were consistent with those of a differentiated , rocky planet whose mantle had been eroded by the host star 's wind during its asymptotic giant branch phase . 
 = = = Magnetic field = = = 
 Magnetic fields in white dwarfs with a strength at the surface of ~ 1 million gauss ( 100 teslas ) were predicted by P. M. S. Blackett in 1947 as a consequence of a physical law he had proposed which stated that an uncharged , rotating body should generate a magnetic field proportional to its angular momentum . This putative law , sometimes called the Blackett effect , was never generally accepted , and by the 1950s even Blackett felt it had been refuted . , pp. 39 – 43 In the 1960s , it was proposed that white dwarfs might have magnetic fields due to conservation of total surface magnetic flux that existed in its progenitor star phase . A surface magnetic field of ~ 100 gauss ( 0 @.@ 01 T ) in the progenitor star would thus become a surface magnetic field of ~ 100 · 1002 = 1 million gauss ( 100 T ) once the star 's radius had shrunk by a factor of 100 . , § 8 ; , p . 484 The first magnetic white dwarf to be observed was GJ 742 , which was detected to have a magnetic field in 1970 by its emission of circularly polarized light . It is thought to have a surface field of approximately 300 million gauss ( 30 kT ) . , § 8 Since then magnetic fields have been discovered in well over 100 white dwarfs , ranging from 2 × 103 to 109 gauss ( 0 @.@ 2 T to 100 kT ) . Only a small number of white dwarfs have been examined for fields , and it has been estimated that at least 10 % of white dwarfs have fields in excess of 1 million gauss ( 100 T ) . 
 = = = = Chemical bonds = = = = 
 The magnetic fields in a white dwarf may allow for the existence of a new type of chemical bond , perpendicular paramagnetic bonding , in addition to ionic and covalent bonds , resulting in what has been initially described as " magnetized matter " in research published in 2012 . 
 = = Variability = = 
 Early calculations suggested that there might be white dwarfs whose luminosity varied with a period of around 10 seconds , but searches in the 1960s failed to observe this . , § 7 @.@ 1 @.@ 1 ; The first variable white dwarf found was HL Tau 76 ; in 1965 and 1966 , and was observed to vary with a period of approximately 12 @.@ 5 minutes . The reason for this period being longer than predicted is that the variability of HL Tau 76 , like that of the other pulsating variable white dwarfs known , arises from non @-@ radial gravity wave pulsations . , § 7 . Known types of pulsating white dwarf include the <unk> , or ZZ Ceti , stars , including HL Tau 76 , with hydrogen @-@ dominated atmospheres and the spectral type DA ; , pp. 891 , 895 <unk> , or <unk> Her , stars , with helium @-@ dominated atmospheres and the spectral type DB ; , p . 3525 and GW Vir stars ( sometimes subdivided into <unk> and <unk> stars ) , with atmospheres dominated by helium , carbon , and oxygen . GW Vir stars are not , strictly speaking , white dwarfs , but are stars which are in a position on the Hertzsprung @-@ Russell diagram between the asymptotic giant branch and the white dwarf region . They may be called pre @-@ white dwarfs . These variables all exhibit small ( 1 % – 30 % ) variations in light output , arising from a superposition of vibrational modes with periods of hundreds to thousands of seconds . Observation of these variations gives <unk> evidence about the interiors of white dwarfs . 
 = = Formation = = 
 White dwarfs are thought to represent the end point of stellar evolution for main @-@ sequence stars with masses from about 0 @.@ 07 to 10 M ☉ . The composition of the white dwarf produced will depend on the initial mass of the star . 
 = = = Stars with very low mass = = = 
 If the mass of a main @-@ sequence star is lower than approximately half a solar mass , it will never become hot enough to fuse helium in its core . It is thought that , over a lifespan that considerably exceeds the age of the Universe ( ~ 13 @.@ 8 billion years ) , such a star will eventually burn all its hydrogen and end its evolution as a helium white dwarf composed chiefly of helium @-@ 4 nuclei . Due to the very long time this process takes , it is not thought to be the origin of the observed helium white dwarfs . Rather , they are thought to be the product of mass loss in binary systems or mass loss due to a large planetary companion . 
 = = = Stars with low to medium mass = = = 
 If the mass of a main @-@ sequence star is between 0 @.@ 5 and 8 M ☉ , its core will become sufficiently hot to fuse helium into carbon and oxygen via the triple @-@ alpha process , but it will never become sufficiently hot to fuse carbon into neon . Near the end of the period in which it undergoes fusion reactions , such a star will have a carbon @-@ oxygen core which does not undergo fusion reactions , surrounded by an inner helium @-@ burning shell and an outer hydrogen @-@ burning shell . On the Hertzsprung @-@ Russell diagram , it will be found on the asymptotic giant branch . It will then expel most of its outer material , creating a planetary nebula , until only the carbon @-@ oxygen core is left . This process is responsible for the carbon @-@ oxygen white dwarfs which form the vast majority of observed white dwarfs . 
 = = = Stars with medium to high mass = = = 
 If a star is massive enough , its core will eventually become sufficiently hot to fuse carbon to neon , and then to fuse neon to iron . Such a star will not become a white dwarf , because the mass of its central , non @-@ fusing core , initially supported by electron degeneracy pressure , will eventually exceed the largest possible mass <unk> by degeneracy pressure . At this point the core of the star will collapse and it will explode in a core @-@ collapse supernova which will leave behind a remnant neutron star , black hole , or possibly a more exotic form of compact star . Some main @-@ sequence stars , of perhaps 8 to 10 M ☉ , although sufficiently massive to fuse carbon to neon and magnesium , may be insufficiently massive to fuse neon . Such a star may leave a remnant white dwarf composed chiefly of oxygen , neon , and magnesium , provided that its core does not collapse , and provided that fusion does not proceed so violently as to blow apart the star in a supernova Although a few white dwarfs have been identified which may be of this type , most evidence for the existence of such comes from the novae called <unk> or neon novae . The spectra of these novae exhibit abundances of neon , magnesium , and other intermediate @-@ mass elements which appear to be only explicable by the accretion of material onto an oxygen @-@ neon @-@ magnesium white dwarf . 
 = = = Type Ia supernovae = = = 
 Type Ia supernovae , that involve one or two previous white dwarfs , have been proposed to be a channel for transformation of this type of stellar remnant . In this scenario , the carbon detonation produced in a Type Ia supernova is too weak to destroy the white dwarf , expelling just a small part of its mass as ejecta , but produces an asymmetric explosion that kicks the star to high speeds of a <unk> star . The matter processed in the failed detonation is re @-@ accreted by the white dwarf with the heaviest elements such as iron falling to its core where it accumulates . 
 These iron @-@ core white dwarfs would be smaller than their carbon @-@ oxygen kind of similar mass and would cool and crystallize faster than those . 
 = = Fate = = 
 A white dwarf is stable once formed and will continue to cool almost indefinitely , eventually to become a black dwarf . Assuming that the Universe continues to expand , it is thought that in 1019 to 1020 years , the galaxies will evaporate as their stars escape into intergalactic space . , § IIIA . White dwarfs should generally survive galactic dispersion , although an occasional collision between white dwarfs may produce a new fusing star or a super @-@ Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf which will explode in a Type Ia supernova . , § IIIC , IV . The subsequent lifetime of white dwarfs is thought to be on the order of the lifetime of the proton , known to be at least 1034 @-@ 1035 years . Some grand unified theories predict a proton lifetime between 1030 and 1036 years . If these theories are not valid , the proton may decay by complicated nuclear reactions or through quantum gravitational processes involving a virtual black hole ; in these cases , the lifetime is estimated to be no more than <unk> years . If protons do decay , the mass of a white dwarf will decrease very slowly with time as its nuclei decay , until it loses enough mass to become a <unk> lump of matter , and finally disappears completely . , § IV . 
 A white dwarf can also be cannibalized or evaporated by a companion star , causing the white dwarf to lose so much mass that it becomes a planetary mass object . The resultant object , orbiting the former companion , now host star , could be a helium planet or diamond planet . 
 = = Debris disks and planets = = 
 A white dwarf 's stellar and planetary system is inherited from its progenitor star and may interact with the white dwarf in various ways . Infrared spectroscopic observations made by NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope of the central star of the Helix Nebula suggest the presence of a dust cloud , which may be caused by cometary collisions . It is possible that infalling material from this may cause X @-@ ray emission from the central star . Similarly , observations made in 2004 indicated the presence of a dust cloud around the young white dwarf G29 @-@ 38 ( estimated to have formed from its AGB progenitor about 500 million years ago ) , which may have been created by tidal disruption of a comet passing close to the white dwarf . Some estimations based on the metal content of the atmospheres of the white dwarfs consider that at least a 15 % of them may be orbited by planets and / or asteroids , or at least their debris . Another suggested idea is that white dwarfs could be orbited by the stripped cores of rocky planets , that would have survived the red giant phase of their star but losing their outer layers and , given those planetary remnants would likely be made of metals , to attempt to detect them looking for the signatures of their interaction with the white dwarf 's magnetic field . 
 There is a planet in the white dwarf – pulsar binary system PSR B1620 @-@ 26 . 
 There are two circumbinary planets around the white dwarf – red dwarf binary NN Serpentis . 
 The metal @-@ rich white dwarf WD 1145 + 017 is the first white dwarf observed with a disintegrating minor planet which transits the star . The disintegration of the planetesimal generates a debris cloud which passes in front of the star every 4 @.@ 5 hours , causing a 5 @-@ minute @-@ long fade in the star 's optical brightness . The depth of the transit is highly variable . 
 = = Habitability = = 
 It has been proposed that white dwarfs with surface temperatures of less than 10 @,@ 000 Kelvin could harbor a habitable zone at a distance between ~ 0 @.@ 005 to 0 @.@ 02 AU that would last upwards of 3 billion years . The goal is to search for transits of hypothetical Earth @-@ like planets that could have migrated inward and / or formed there . As a white dwarf has a size similar to that of a planet , these kinds of transits would produce strong eclipses . Newer research casts some doubts on this idea , given that the close orbits of those hypothetical planets around their parent stars would subject them to strong tidal forces that could render them <unk> by triggering a greenhouse effect . Another suggested constraint to this idea is the origin of those planets . Leaving aside in @-@ situ formation on an accretion disk surrounding the white dwarf , there are two ways a planet could end in a close orbit around stars of this kind : by surviving being engulfed by the star during its red giant phase , and then spiraling towards its core , or inward migration after the white dwarf has formed . The former case is implausible for low @-@ mass bodies , as they are unlikely to survive being absorbed by their stars . In the latter case , the planets would have to expel so much orbital energy as heat , through tidal interactions with the white dwarf , that they would likely end as uninhabitable embers . 
 = = Binary stars and novae = = 
 If a white dwarf is in a binary star system and is accreting matter from its companion , a variety of phenomena may occur , including novae and Type Ia supernovae . It may also be a super @-@ soft x @-@ ray source if it is able to take material from its companion fast enough to sustain fusion on its surface . A close binary system of two white dwarfs can radiate energy in the form of gravitational waves , causing their mutual orbit to steadily shrink until the stars merge . 
 = = = Type Ia supernovae = = = 
 The mass of an isolated , nonrotating white dwarf cannot exceed the Chandrasekhar limit of ~ 1 @.@ 4 M ☉ . ( This limit may increase if the white dwarf is rotating rapidly and <unk> . ) White dwarfs in binary systems can accrete material from a companion star , increasing both their mass and their density . As their mass approaches the Chandrasekhar limit , this could theoretically lead to either the explosive ignition of fusion in the white dwarf or its collapse into a neutron star . 
 Accretion provides the currently favored mechanism called the single @-@ degenerate model for Type Ia supernovae . In this model , a carbon – oxygen white dwarf accretes mass and compresses its core by pulling mass from a companion star . , p . 14 . It is believed that compressional heating of the core leads to ignition of carbon fusion as the mass approaches the Chandrasekhar limit . Because the white dwarf is supported against gravity by quantum degeneracy pressure instead of by thermal pressure , adding heat to the star 's interior increases its temperature but not its pressure , so the white dwarf does not expand and cool in response . Rather , the increased temperature accelerates the rate of the fusion reaction , in a runaway process that feeds on itself . The thermonuclear flame consumes much of the white dwarf in a few seconds , causing a Type Ia supernova explosion that obliterates the star . In another possible mechanism for Type Ia supernovae , the double @-@ degenerate model , two carbon @-@ oxygen white dwarfs in a binary system merge , creating an object with mass greater than the Chandrasekhar limit in which carbon fusion is then ignited . , p . 14 . 
 Observations have failed to note signs of accretion leading up to Type Ia supernovae , and this is now thought to be because the star is first loaded up to above the Chandrasekhar limit while also being spun up to a very high rate by the same process . Once the accretion stops the star gradually slows until the spin is no longer enough to prevent the explosion . 
 = = = <unk> variables = = = 
 Before accretion of material pushes a white dwarf close to the Chandrasekhar limit , accreted hydrogen @-@ rich material on the surface may ignite in a less destructive type of thermonuclear explosion powered by hydrogen fusion . These surface explosions can be repeated as long as the white dwarf 's core remains intact . This weaker kind of repetitive cataclysmic phenomenon is called a ( classical ) nova . Astronomers have also observed dwarf novae , which have smaller , more frequent luminosity peaks than the classical novae . These are thought to be caused by the release of gravitational potential energy when part of the accretion disc collapses onto the star , rather than through a release of energy due to fusion . In general , binary systems with a white dwarf accreting matter from a stellar companion are called cataclysmic variables . As well as novae and dwarf novae , several other classes of these variables are known , including polars and intermediate polars , both of which feature highly magnetic white dwarfs . Both <unk> and accretion @-@ powered cataclysmic variables have been observed to be X @-@ ray sources .

 = Hurricane Irene – Olivia = 
 Hurricane Irene – Olivia was the first actively tracked tropical cyclone to move into the eastern Pacific Ocean from the Atlantic basin . It originated as a tropical depression on September 11 , 1971 , in the tropical Atlantic . The cyclone tracked nearly due westward at a low latitude , passing through the southern Windward Islands and later over northern South America . In the southwest Caribbean Sea , it intensified to a tropical storm and later a hurricane . Irene made landfall on southeastern Nicaragua on September 19 , and maintained its circulation as it crossed the low @-@ lying terrain of the country . <unk> after reaching the Pacific , Irene was renamed Hurricane Olivia , which ultimately attained peak winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) . Olivia weakened significantly before moving ashore on the Baja California Peninsula on September 30 ; the next day it dissipated . 
 In the Atlantic , Irene produced moderate rainfall and winds along its path , although impact was greatest in Nicaragua where it moved ashore as a hurricane . A total of 96 homes were destroyed , and 1 @,@ 200 people were left homeless . The rainfall resulted in widespread flooding , killing three people in Rivas . In neighboring Costa Rica , Hurricane Irene caused more than $ 1 million ( USD ) in damage to the banana crop . Later , the remnants of Hurricane Olivia produced rainfall in the southwest United States . Flooding was reported near Yuma , Arizona , which closed a major highway , and the moisture produced snowfall in higher elevations in the Rocky Mountains . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of the hurricane were from a tropical wave that exited the west African coast on September 7 . It moved rapidly westward , developing into a tropical depression on September 11 about 800 miles ( 1300 km ) east of the Windward Islands . It was one of seven active tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin that day , one of the most active single days on record . It existed at a fairly low latitude and failed to intensify due to the unfavorable combination of Hurricane Ginger and a long trough to its northwest . On September 13 , the depression passed just south of Barbados and subsequently entered the Caribbean Sea . Interacting with the terrain of South America , the center became broad and ill @-@ defined , although Curaçao reported winds of near tropical storm force as it crossed the island on September 16 . It later moved near or over northern Venezuela and Colombia . As it approached the western Caribbean , the depression was able to organize more , with less influence from landmass or the trough to its north . At 0000 UTC on September 17 , it is estimated the depression attained tropical storm status ; that day , it was named Irene about 350 miles ( 560 km ) east of San Andrés . Initially , the storm was expected to track west @-@ northwestward toward the northwest Caribbean , similar to the track taken by the destructive Hurricane Edith two weeks prior . 
 Tropical Storm Irene gradually intensified as it continued across the southwestern Caribbean Sea . Late on September 18 , the storm attained hurricane status a short distance off the coast of Central America , with 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) winds , its peak intensity in the Atlantic Ocean . As it strengthened , it developed an eye and spiral rainbands that extended across Panama into the Pacific Ocean . Hurricane Irene weakened slightly as it approached the coast , although its pressure dropped to 989 mbar . On September 19 , the hurricane made landfall in the Nicaraguan South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region ; it was the first tropical cyclone of hurricane intensity since 1911 to strike Nicaragua south of Bluefields . Irene quickly weakened , deteriorating to tropical depression status within 18 hours of moving ashore . The circulation remained organized over the low @-@ lying terrain of southern Nicaragua , possibly due to it crossing Lake Nicaragua . After reaching the Pacific Ocean on September 20 , the depression restrengthened to attain tropical storm status ; upon doing so , it was re @-@ designated by a new name , Olivia . It was the first time an Atlantic hurricane was tracked as a tropical cyclone while crossing Central America into the Pacific Ocean ; subsequent research indicated there were earlier storms that accomplished the feat , although they were not known at the time . 
 As an Eastern Pacific tropical cyclone , Olivia maintained well @-@ defined outflow and inflow . It gradually intensified as it paralleled the southern Central America coastline . Late on September 21 , a Hurricane Hunters flight reported winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) and an eye 23 miles ( 37 km ) in diameter ; based on the readings , Olivia was upgraded to hurricane status . For several days , Olivia moved west to west @-@ northwestward off the coast of Mexico , although its exact intensity fluctuations were unknown , due to lack of significant observations . On September 25 , the eye became very pronounced on satellite imagery , and based on a report from the Hurricane Hunters , it is estimated Olivia reached peak winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) , about 245 miles ( 395 km ) southwest of Manzanillo , Colima . The Hurricane Hunters also reported a pressure of 948 mbar , which was the lowest reported pressure during the 1971 Pacific hurricane season . 
 The intensity of Hurricane Olivia fluctuated for two days as it turned westward away from land , due to a blocking ridge over northwestern Mexico . Early on September 26 it weakened to winds of about 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) , before it quickly restrengthened to its previous peak intensity . Subsequently , dry air became entrained in the circulation , and Olivia began to weaken as it moved over cooler waters . The eye became disorganized and eventually dissipated . Late on September 28 it weakened to tropical storm status , after beginning a turn to the northwest and later to the north . About 24 hours later , Olivia weakened to tropical depression status as it approached the coastline of the Baja California Peninsula . Most of the thunderstorm activity dissipated by the time the depression moved ashore on September 30 ; the next day , Olivia dissipated near the border of Baja California and Baja California Sur . 
 = = Impact and records = = 
 As a tropical depression , the cyclone produced a wind gust of 43 mph ( 69 km / h ) in Barbados . The system also dropped 3 @.@ 35 inches ( 85 @.@ 1 mm ) of rainfall in Trinidad . Prior to its arrival , officials noted the potential for the depression to bring flash flooding to northern Venezuela , as well as heavy rainfall to the ABC islands . Later as a tropical storm , Irene brushed San Andrés island in the western Caribbean with gale force winds ; no major damage was reported there . 
 Prior to the hurricane 's landfall in Nicaragua , the country 's army evacuated about 500 people from a settlement near Bluefields , and along the coastline , boats were advised to remain at port . When it moved ashore , the hurricane produced sustained winds of 46 mph ( 74 km / h ) in Bluefields . The winds destroyed 27 houses in the region . Observations were not available in the sparsely populated region near where Irene moved ashore , although winds were believed to have reached hurricane force there . Reconnaissance planes reported heavy structural and tree damage in southeastern Nicaragua . Satellite imagery suggested that heavy rainfall occurred from Panama through Honduras , and one location in Nicaragua reported more than 6 @.@ 3 inches ( 160 mm ) of precipitation . The rainfall caused flooding in many communities , killing three people in Rivas . At least five rivers reported flooding ; along one of the rivers , 35 houses were inundated , and along another , the floodwaters swept away all of the crops and personal belongings of three villages . Across the country , the hurricane destroyed 96 homes , and 1 @,@ 200 people were left homeless . In Costa Rica , Irene 's passage resulted in more than $ 1 million ( USD ) in damage to the banana crop . 
 Late in its duration , Hurricane Olivia brought increased moisture into the southwest United States . More than 2 inches ( 50 mm ) of rainfall were reported across Arizona and New Mexico . Light precipitation was also reported in western Texas and southeastern California . The National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings throughout the region . Near Yuma , Arizona , thunderstorms caused three major power outages and produced flooding that resulted in the closure of a portion of U.S. Route 95 . In Navajo and Pinal counties , the rainfall damaged roads , bridges , sewers , and homes , which amounted to about $ 250 @,@ 000 in repair work for the state of Arizona . The storm 's moisture also produced locally heavy snowfall in higher elevations in the Rocky Mountains . 
 Irene – Olivia is unusual in that it survived passage from the Atlantic to Pacific Ocean . Only seven other storms are known to have done so . Irene was the first of three Atlantic @-@ to @-@ Pacific crossover tropical cyclones in the 1970s , all three of which took eastern Pacific names starting with the letter O. 
 = Two Black Cadillacs = 
 " Two Black Cadillacs " is a song by American recording artist Carrie Underwood , taken from her fourth studio album , Blown Away . The song served as the album 's third single on November 18 , 2012 through Arista Nashville . Written by Underwood , Hillary Lindsey and Josh Kear , " Two Black Cadillacs " is a country pop song with lyrics addressing the story of two women ( one being his wife , the other unaware he was married ) who , when they realize they are both involved with the same guy , set aside their differences and decide to kill him . It was produced by Mark Bright , and the instrumentation was compared to songs by Dixie Chicks and Miranda Lambert . 
 Upon its release , " Two Black Cadillacs " was met with positive reviews from music critics , who praised its story and Underwood 's versatility as an artist . Commercially , the song was successful . In the United States , it reached number two on the Billboard Country Airplay chart , and also reached number 41 on the Hot 100 . " Two Black Cadillacs " was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , denoting sales of over one million units in the country . The song also charted in Canada at number three on the Country chart and at number 52 on the Canadian Hot 100 . 
 The accompanying music video was directed by P.R. Brown , and filmed in Nashville , Tennessee . The video draws inspiration from Stephen King 's novel Christine , and shows how the wife and mistress kill the cheating husband with a black Cadillac . It was nominated for Video of the Year at the 2013 Academy of Country Music Awards . Underwood has performed " Two Black Cadillacs " in a number of live appearances , including at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards , where various images were projected onto the singer 's gown , and at the 2013 Country Music Association Awards , in a medley with " Good Girl " , " See You Again " and " Blown Away " . It was also performed during the Blown Away Tour . 
 = = Writing and composition = = 
 After Underwood 's Play On Tour ended in December 2010 , she started to work on her then @-@ untitled fourth studio album . Sony Music Nashville chairman / CEO Gary Overton said that the singer " took nearly a year to compile and record the songs . " Songwriters Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear , who previously wrote " Before He Cheats " for Underwood 's debut album , Some Hearts , worked on a track titled " Blown Away " and sent it to the singer . Underwood loved the song and recorded it , also naming her album Blown Away as it was the song that defined the album 's darker direction . She then started writing material with several songwriters , including Hillary Lindsey and Kear . Together , the trio wrote " Two Black Cadillacs " , which is about two women finding out that they both are involved in a relationship the same man and set their differences aside to kill him . Underwood said that " it was so much fun to write and just be in that room " with Lindsey and Kear , as they " didn 't really know what to expect or where we were headed or what we would end up with . " Kear described the writing session : 
 Carrie had told me in an earlier writing appointment that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records . So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark , this was what she was after . Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn 't give away how the two women got rid of the man the song is about . This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it 's unpleasant to listen to more than once . I think we managed to pull that off . Either way , it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out . 
 Melodically , " Two Black Cadillacs " is written in the key of F minor , and is set in the common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute . Underwood 's voice spans from the low note of A ♭ 3 to the high note of C5 . Billy Dukes of Taste of Country noted that the lyrics of the song push " the normally plucky country superstar to the edge of evil . It 's as far as she can go without falling off the cliff of believability . " Dukes also described the song as a " mini @-@ movie " , in which Underwood sings : " And the preacher said he was a good man / And his brother said he was a good friend / But the women in the two black veils didn 't bother to cry / Bye , bye / Yeah they took turns laying a rose down / Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground / He 's not the only one who had a secret to hide / Bye bye , bye bye , bye bye . " The country pop instrumentation includes piano , brooding strings and a guitar , and has been compared to " Goodbye Earl " by the Dixie Chicks and " Gunpowder and Lead " by Miranda Lambert .

So , maybe it 'll only sell a million singles and reach No. 2 " , giving the song three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars . Daryl Addison of Great American Country praised the song , saying that " even with heavy thematic elements , the songs impressively maintain a pop / crossover shine and accessible sound , courtesy of Carrie 's pristine voice and modern delivery . " Writing for Country Universe , Kevin Coyne gave the song an A , complimenting the singer 's versatility , saying that " it 's a credit to her ambition as an artist . For someone so frequently accused of getting to the top without having to earn it , she continues to work harder than the rest of her peers just to stay there . "

 Underwood performed " Two Black Cadillacs " at the 40th American Music Awards on November 18 , 2012 . Amy Sciaretto of Taste of Country summarized the performance , writing : 
 Underwood performed in a lacy , frilly black dress with a full skirt and black leather fingerless gloves , which she paired with smoky black eye makeup and black hoop earrings . The singer was the centerpiece of the performance , and her look was jaw @-@ droppingly gorgeous . [ ... ] There were bright lights above the stage and images of two black Cadillacs on the screens behind her , but that was about the extent of her production . And the simplicity worked for her . 
 She performed an acoustic version of the song during the 55th Annual Grammy Awards . During the performance , the singer 's gown became a screen on which images varying from roses to butterflies and fireworks were projected . Underwood also performed " Two Black Cadillacs " at the 2013 Country Music Association Awards , in a medley with " Good Girl " , " See You Again " and " Blown Away " . " Two Black Cadillacs " was the third song in the medley , and <unk> Howell of Taste of Country noted that , in that part , " lighting ripped across the screen and everything went black , except Underwood and her sparkly microphone .

 = Procellariiformes = 
 Procellariiformes is an order of seabirds that comprises four families : the albatrosses , petrels and shearwaters , storm petrels , and diving petrels . Formerly called <unk> and still called tubenoses in English , they are often referred to collectively as the petrels , a term that has been applied to all Procellariiformes , or more commonly all the families except the albatrosses . They are almost exclusively pelagic ( feeding in the open ocean ) , and have a cosmopolitan distribution across the world 's oceans , with the highest diversity being around New Zealand . 
 Procellariiformes are colonial , mostly nesting on remote , predator @-@ free islands . The larger species nest on the surface , while most smaller species nest in natural cavities and burrows . They exhibit strong philopatry , returning to their natal colony to breed and returning to the same nesting site over many years . Procellariiformes are monogamous and form long @-@ term pair bonds that are formed over several years and may last for the life of the pair . Only a single egg is laid per nesting attempt , and usually only a single nesting attempt is made per year , although the larger albatrosses may only nest once every two years . Both parents participate in incubation and chick rearing . Incubation times are long compared to other birds , as are fledging periods . Once a chick has fledged there is no further parental care . 
 Procellariiformes have had a long relationship with humans . They have been important food sources for many people , and continue to be hunted as such in some parts of the world . The albatrosses in particular have been the subject of numerous cultural depictions . Procellariiformes are one of the most endangered bird taxa , with many species threatened with extinction due to introduced predators in their breeding colonies , marine pollution and the danger of fisheries by @-@ catch . Scientists , conservationists , fishermen , and governments around the world are working to reduce the threats posed to them , and these efforts have led to the signing of the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels , a legally binding international treaty signed in 2001 . 
 = = Biology = = 
 = = = Distribution and movements = = = 
 The Procellariiformes have a cosmopolitan distribution across the world 's oceans and seas , although at the levels of family and genus there are some clear patterns . Antarctic petrels , <unk> antarctica , have to fly over 100 mi ( 160 km ) to get to the ocean from their breeding colonies in Antarctica , and northern fulmars breed on the northeastern tip of Greenland , the furthest north piece of land . The most cosmopolitan family is the Procellariidae , which are found in tropical , temperate and polar zones of both the Northern and the Southern Hemispheres , though the majority do not breed in the tropics , and half the species are restricted to southern temperate and polar regions . The gadfly petrels , Pterodroma , have a generally tropical and temperate distribution , whereas the fulmarine petrels are mostly polar with some temperate species . The majority of the fulmarine petrels , along with the prions , are confined to the Southern Hemisphere . 
 The storm petrels are almost as widespread as the procellariids , and fall into two distinct subfamilies ; the Oceanitinae have a mostly Southern Hemisphere distribution and the Hydrobatinae are found mostly in the Northern Hemisphere . Amongst the albatrosses the majority of the family is restricted to the Southern Hemisphere , feeding and nesting in cool temperate areas , although one genus , Phoebastria , ranges across the north Pacific . The family is absent from the north Atlantic , although fossil records indicate they bred there once . Finally the diving @-@ petrels are restricted to the Southern Hemisphere . 
 = = = = Migration = = = = 
 The various species within the order have a variety of migration strategies . Some species undertake regular trans @-@ equatorial migrations , such as the sooty shearwater which annually migrates from its breeding grounds in New Zealand and Chile to the North Pacific off Japan , Alaska and California , an annual round trip of 64 @,@ 000 km ( 40 @,@ 000 mi ) , the longest measured annual migration of any bird . A number of other petrel species undertake trans @-@ equatorial migrations , including the Wilson 's storm petrel and the Providence petrel , but no albatrosses cross the equator , as they rely on wind assisted flight . There are other long @-@ distant migrants within the order ; Swinhoe 's storm petrels breed in the western Pacific and migrates to the western Indian Ocean , and Bonin petrels nesting in Hawaii migrate to the coast of Japan during the non @-@ breeding season . 
 = = = = Navigation = = = = 
 Many species in the order travel long distances over open water but return to the same nest site each year , raising the question of how they navigate so accurately . The Welsh naturalist Ronald Lockley carried out early research into animal navigation with the Manx shearwaters that nested on the island of Skokholm . In release experiments , a Manx shearwater flew from Boston to Skokholm , a distance of 3 @,@ 000 miles ( 4 @,@ 800 kilometres ) in 12 ½ days . Lockley showed that when released " under a clear sky " with sun or stars visible , the shearwaters oriented themselves and then " flew off in a direct line for Skokholm " , making the journey so rapidly that they must have flown almost in a straight line . But if the sky was overcast at the time of release , the shearwaters flew around in circles " as if lost " and returned slowly or not at all , implying that they navigated using astronomical cues . 
 = = = Morphology and flight = = = 
 Procellariiformes range in size from the very large wandering albatross , at 11 kg ( 24 lb ) and a 3 @.@ 6 @-@ metre ( 12 @-@ foot ) wingspan , to tiny birds like the least storm petrel , at 20 g ( 0 @.@ 71 oz ) with a 32 @-@ centimetre ( 13 @-@ inch ) wingspan , and the smallest of the prions , the fairy prion , with a wingspan of 23 to 28 cm ( 9 @.@ 1 to 11 @.@ 0 in ) . They have their nostrils enclosed in one or two tubes on their straight , deeply grooved bills with hooked tips . The beaks are made up of several plates . Their wings are long and narrow ; the feet are webbed , and the hind toe is undeveloped or non @-@ existent ; their adult plumage is predominantly black , white , and grey . 
 The order has a few unifying characteristics , starting with their tubular nasal passage which is used for olfaction . This ability to smell helps to locate patchily distributed prey at sea and may also help locate their nests within nesting colonies . The structure of the bill , which contains seven to nine distinct horny plates , is another unifying feature , although there are differences within the order . Petrels have a plate called the maxillary <unk> that forms a hook on the maxilla . The smaller members of the order have a comb @-@ like mandible , made by the tomial plate , for plankton feeding . Most members of the order are unable to walk well on land , and many species visit their remote breeding islands only at night . The exceptions are the huge albatrosses , several of the gadfly petrels and shearwaters and the fulmar @-@ petrels . The latter can disable even large predatory birds with their obnoxious stomach oil , which they can project some distance . This stomach oil , stored in the proventriculus , is a digestive residue created in the foregut of all tubenoses except the diving petrels , and is used mainly for storage of energy @-@ rich food during their long flights . The oil is also fed to their young , as well as being used for defence . 
 Procellariiformes drink seawater , so they have to excrete excess salt . All birds have an enlarged nasal gland at the base of the bill , above the eyes , and in the Procellariiformes the gland is active . In general terms , the salt gland removes salt from the system and forms a 5 percent saline solution that drips out of the nostrils , or is forcibly ejected in some petrels . The processes behind this involve high levels of sodium ion reabsorption into the blood plasma within the kidneys , and secretion of sodium chloride via the salt glands using less water than was absorbed , which essentially generates salt @-@ free water for other physiological uses . This high efficiency of sodium ion absorption is attributed to mammalian @-@ type <unk> . 
 Most albatrosses and procellariids use two techniques to minimise exertion while flying , namely , dynamic soaring and slope soaring . The albatrosses and giant petrels share a morphological adaptation to aid in flight , a sheet of tendon which locks the wing when fully extended , allowing the wing to be kept up and out without any muscle effort . Amongst the Oceanitinae storm @-@ petrels there are two unique flight patterns , one being surface pattering . In this they move across the water surface holding and moving their feet on the water 's surface while holding steady above the water , and remaining stationary by hovering with rapid fluttering or by using the wind to anchor themselves in place . A similar flight method is thought to have been used by the extinct petrel family Diomedeoididae . The white @-@ faced storm petrel possesses a unique variation on pattering : holding its wings motionless and at an angle into the wind , it pushes itself off the water 's surface in a succession of bounding jumps . 
 = = = Diet and feeding = = = 
 The Procellariiformes are for the most part exclusively marine foragers ; the only exception to this rule are the two species of giant petrel , which regularly feed on carrion or other seabirds while on land . While some other species of fulmarine and Procellaria petrels also take carrion , the diet of most species of albatrosses and petrels is dominated by fish , squid , krill and other marine zooplankton . The importance of these food sources varies from species to species and family to family . For example , of the two albatross species found in Hawaii , the black @-@ footed albatross takes mostly fish , while the Laysan feeds mainly on squid . The albatrosses in general feed on fish , squid and krill . Among the procellariids , the prions concentrate on small crustacea , the fulmarine petrels take fish and krill but little squid , while the Procellaria petrels consume mainly squid . The storm petrels take small droplets of oil from the surface of the water , as well as small crustaceans and fish . 
 Petrels obtain food by snatching prey while swimming on the surface , snatching prey from the wing or diving down under the water to pursue prey . Dipping down from flight is most commonly used by the gadfly petrels and the storm petrels . There have been records of wedge @-@ tailed shearwaters snatching flying fish from the air , but as a rule this technique is rare . Some diving birds may aid diving by beginning with a plunge from the air , but for the most part petrels are active divers and use their wings to move around under the water . The depths achieved by various species were determined in the 1990s and came as a surprise to scientists ; short @-@ tailed shearwaters have been recorded diving to 70 m ( 230 ft ) and the Light @-@ mantled sooty albatross to 12 m ( 39 ft ) .

 = = = = Breeding colonies = = = = 
 All Procellariiformes are colonial , predominantly breeding on offshore or oceanic islands . The few species that nest on continents do so in inhospitable environments such as dry deserts or on Antarctica . These colonies can vary from the widely spaced colonies of the giant petrels to the dense 3 @.@ 6 million @-@ strong colonies of Leach 's storm petrels . For almost all species the need to breed is the only reason that Procellariiformes return to land at all . Some of the larger petrels have to nest on windswept locations as they require wind to take off and forage for food . Within the colonies , pairs defend usually small territories ( the giant petrels and some albatrosses can have very large territories ) which is the small area around either the nest or a burrow . Competition between pairs can be intense , as is competition between species , particularly for burrows . Larger species of petrels will even kill the chicks and even adults of smaller species in disputes over burrows . Burrows and natural crevices are most commonly used by the smaller species ; all the storm petrels and diving petrels are cavity nesters , as are many of the procellariids . The fulmarine petrels and some tropical gadfly petrels and shearwaters are surface nesters , as are all the albatrosses . 
 Procellariiformes show high levels of philopatry , both site fidelity and natal philopatry . Natal philopatry is the tendency of an individual bird to return to its natal colony to breed , often many years after leaving the colony as a chick . This tendency has been shown through ringing studies and mitochondrial DNA studies . Birds ringed as chicks have been recaptured close to their original nests , sometimes extremely close ; in the Laysan albatross the average distance between hatching site and the site where a bird established its own territory was 22 m ( 72 ft ) , and a study of Cory 's shearwaters nesting near Corsica found that nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony actually bred in the burrow they were raised in . Mitochondrial DNA provides evidence of restricted gene flow between different colonies , strongly suggesting philopatry . 
 The other type of philopatry exhibited is site fidelity , where pairs of birds return to the same nesting site for a number of years . Among the most extreme examples known of this tendency was the fidelity of a ringed northern fulmar that returned to the same nest site for 25 years . The average number of birds returning to the same nest sites is high in all species studied , with around 91 percent for Bulwer 's petrels , and 85 percent of males and 76 percent of females for Cory 's shearwaters ( after a successful breeding attempt ) . 
 = = = = Pair bonds and life history = = = = 
 Procellariiformes are monogamous breeders and form long @-@ term pair bonds . These pair bonds take several years to develop in some species , particularly with the albatrosses . Once formed , they last for many breeding seasons , in some cases for the life of the pair . Petrel courtship can be elaborate . It reaches its extreme with the albatrosses , where pairs spend many years perfecting and elaborate mating dances . These dances are composed of synchronised performances of various actions such as preening , pointing , calling , bill clacking , staring , and combinations of such behaviours ( like the sky @-@ call ) . Each particular pair will develop their own individual version of the dance . The breeding behaviour of other Procellariiformes is less elaborate , although similar bonding behaviours are involved , particularly for surface @-@ nesting species . These can involve synchronised flights , mutual preening and calling . Calls are important for helping birds locate potential mates and distinguishing between species , and may also help individuals assess the quality of potential mates . After pairs have been formed , calls serve to help them reunite ; the ability of individuals to recognise their own mate has been demonstrated in several species . 
 Procellariiformes are K @-@ selected , being long @-@ lived and caring extensively for their few offspring . Breeding is delayed for several years after fledging , sometimes for as long as ten years in the largest species . Once they begin breeding , they make only a single breeding attempt per nesting season ; even if the egg is lost early in the season , they seldom re @-@ lay . Much effort is placed into laying a single ( proportionally ) large egg and raising a single chick . Procellariiformes are long @-@ lived : the longest living albatross known survived for 51 years , but was probably older , and even the tiny storm @-@ petrels are known to have survived for 30 years . 
 = = = = Nesting and chick rearing = = = = 
 The majority of Procellariiformes nest once a year and do so seasonally . Some tropical shearwaters , like the Christmas shearwater , are able to nest on cycles slightly shorter than a year , and the large great albatrosses ( genus Diomedea ) nest in alternate years ( if successful ) . Most temperate and polar species nest over the spring @-@ summer , although some albatrosses and procellariids nest over the winter . In the tropics , some species can be found breeding throughout the year , but most nest in discreet periods . Procellariiformes return to nesting colonies as much as several months before laying , and attend their nest sites regularly before copulation . Prior to laying , females embark on a lengthy pre @-@ laying exodus to build up energy reserves in order to lay the exceptionally large egg . In the stormy petrel , a very small <unk> , the egg can be 29 percent of the body weight of the female , while in the grey @-@ faced petrel , the female may spend as much as 80 days feeding out at sea after courtship before laying the egg . 
 When the female returns and lays , incubation is shared between the sexes , with the male taking the first incubation stint and the female returning to sea . The duration of individual stints varies from just a few days to as much as several weeks , during which the incubating bird can lose a considerable amount of weight . The incubation period varies from species to species , around 40 days for the smallest storm @-@ petrels but longer for the largest species ; for albatrosses it can span 70 to 80 days , which is the longest incubation period of any bird . 
 Upon hatching , the chicks are semi @-@ precocial , having open eyes , a dense covering of white or grey down feathers , and the ability to move around the nesting site . After hatching , the incubating adult remains with the chick for a number of days , a period known as the guard phase . In the case of most burrow @-@ nesting species , this is only until the chick is able to thermoregulate , usually two or three days . Diving @-@ petrel chicks take longer to thermoregulate and have a longer guard phase than other burrow nesters . However , surface @-@ nesting species , which have to deal with a greater range of weather and to contend with predators like skuas and frigatebirds , consequently have a longer guard phase ( as long as two weeks in procellariids and three weeks in albatrosses ) . 
 The chick is fed by both parents . Chicks are fed on fish , squid , krill , and stomach oil . Stomach oil is oil composed of neutral dietary lipids that are the residue created by digestion of the prey items . As an energy source for chicks it has several advantages over undigested prey , its calorific value is around 9 @.@ 6 kcal per gram , which is only slightly lower than the value for diesel oil . This can be a real advantage for species that range over huge distances to provide food for hungry chicks . The oil is also used in defence . All Procellariiformes create stomach oil except the diving @-@ petrels . 
 The chick fledges between two and nine months after hatching , almost twice as long as a gull of the same body mass . The reasons behind the length of time are associated with the distance from the breeding site to food . First , there are few predators at the nesting colonies , therefore there is no pressure to fledge quickly . Second , the time between feedings is long due to the distance from the nest site that adults forage , thus a chick that had a higher growth rate would stand a better chance of starving to death . The duration between feedings vary among species and during the stages of development . Small feeds are frequent during the guard phase , but afterward become less frequent . However , each feed can deliver a large amount of energy ; both sooty shearwater and mottled petrel chicks have been recorded to double their weight in a single night , probably when fed by both parents . 
 = = Relationship with humans = = 
 = = = Role in culture = = = 
 The most important family culturally is the albatrosses , which have been described by one author as " the most legendary of birds " . Albatrosses have featured in poetry in the form of Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's famous 1798 poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner , which in turn gave rise to the usage of albatross as metaphor for a burden . More generally , albatrosses were believed to be good omens , and to kill one would bring bad luck . There are few instances of petrels in culture , although there are sailors ' legends regarding the storm petrels , which are considered to warn of oncoming storms . In general , petrels were considered to be " soul birds " , representing the souls of drowned sailors , and it was considered unlucky to touch them . 
 In the Russian language , many petrel species from the Hydrobatidae and <unk> families of the order Procellariiformes are known as burevestnik , which literally means ' the announcer of the storm ' . When in 1901 , the Russian writer Maxim Gorky turned to the imagery of subantarctic avifauna to describe Russian society 's attitudes to the coming revolution , he used a storm @-@ announcing petrel as the lead character of a poem that soon became popular in the revolutionary circles as " the battle anthem of the revolution " . Although the species called " stormy petrel " in English is not one of those to which the burevestnik name is applied in Russian ( it , in fact , is known in Russian as an entirely un @-@ romantic <unk> ) , the English translators uniformly used the " stormy petrel " image in their translations of the poem , usually known in English as The Song of the Stormy Petrel . 
 = = = Exploitation = = = 
 Albatrosses and petrels have been important food sources for humans for as long as people have been able to reach their remote breeding colonies . Amongst the earliest @-@ known examples of this is the remains of shearwaters and albatrosses along with those of other seabirds in 5 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old middens in Chile , although it is likely that they were exploited prior to this . Since then , many other marine cultures , both subsistence and industrial , have exploited Procellariiformes , in some cases almost to extinction . Some cultures continue to harvest shearwaters ( a practice known as <unk> ) ; for example , the Māori of New Zealand use a sustainable traditional method known as <unk> . In Alaska , residents of Kodiak Island harpoon short @-@ tailed albatrosses , Diomedea <unk> , and until the late 1980s residents of Tristan Island in the Indian Ocean harvested the eggs of the Yellow @-@ nosed <unk> , Diomedea chlororhynchos , and sooty albatrosses , Phoebetria fusca . Albatrosses and petrels are also now tourist draws in some locations , such as Taiaroa Head . While such exploitation is non @-@ consumptive , it can have deleterious effects that need careful management to protect both the birds and the tourism . 
 The English naturalist William Yarrell wrote in 1843 that " ten or twelve years ago , Mr. Gould exhibited twenty @-@ four [ storm petrels ] , in a large dish , at one of the evening meetings of the Zoological Society " . 
 The engraver Thomas Bewick wrote in 1804 that " Pennant , speaking of those [ birds ] which breed on , or inhabit , the Isle of St Kilda , says — ' No bird is of so much use to the islanders as this : the Fulmar supplies them with oil for their lamps , down for their beds , a delicacy for their tables , a balm for their wounds , and a medicine for their distempers . ' " A photograph by George Washington Wilson taken about 1886 shows a " view of the men and women of St Kilda on the beach dividing up the catch of Fulmar " . James Fisher , author of The Fulmar ( 1952 ) calculated that every person on St Kilda consumed over 100 fulmars each year ; the meat was their staple food , and they caught around 12 @,@ 000 birds annually . However , when the human population left St Kilda in 1930 , the population did not suddenly grow . 
 = = = Threats and conservation = = = 
 The albatrosses and petrels are " amongst the most severely threatened taxa worldwide " . They face a variety of threats , the severity of which varies greatly from species to species . Several species are among the most common of seabirds , including Wilson 's storm petrel ( an estimated 12 to 30 million individuals ) and the short @-@ tailed shearwater ( 23 million individuals ) ; while the total population of some other species is a few hundred . There are less than 200 Magenta petrels breeding on the Chatham Islands , only 130 to 160 Zino 's petrels and only 170 Amsterdam albatrosses . Only one species is thought to have become extinct since 1600 , the Guadalupe storm petrel of Mexico , although a number of species had died out before this . Numerous species are very poorly known ; for example , the Fiji petrel has rarely been seen since its discovery . The breeding colony of the New Zealand storm petrel was not located until February 2013 ; it had been thought extinct for 150 years until its rediscovery in 2003 , while the Bermuda petrel had been considered extinct for nearly 300 years . 
 The principal threat to the albatrosses and larger species of procellariids is long @-@ line fishing . Bait set on hooks is attractive to foraging birds and many are hooked by the lines as they are set . As many as 100 @,@ 000 albatrosses are hooked and drown each year on tuna lines set out by long @-@ line fisheries . Before 1991 and the ban on drift @-@ net fisheries , it was estimated that 500 @,@ 000 seabirds a year died as a result . This has caused steep declines in some species , as Procellariiformes are extremely slow breeders and cannot replace their numbers fast enough . Losses of albatrosses and petrels in the Southern Ocean were estimated at between 1 percent and 16 percent per year , which these species cannot sustain for long . 
 Exotic species introduced to the remote breeding colonies threaten all types of Procellariiformes . These principally take the form of predators ; most albatross and petrel species are clumsy on land and unable to defend themselves from mammals such as rats , feral cats and pigs . This phenomenon , ecological naivete , has resulted in declines in many species and was implicated in the extinction of the Guadalupe storm petrel . Already in 1910 Godman wrote : 
 Owing to the introduction of the mongoose and other small carnivorous mammals into their breeding haunts , some species , such as <unk> jamaicensis and <unk> , have already been completely exterminated , and others appear to be in danger of extinction . 
 Introduced herbivores may unbalance the ecology of islands ; introduced rabbits destroyed the forest understory on Cabbage Tree Island off New South Wales , which increased the vulnerability of the Gould 's petrels nesting on the island to natural predators , and left them vulnerable to the sticky fruits of the native birdlime tree ( Pisonia <unk> ) . In the natural state these fruits lodge in the understory of the forest , but with the understory removed the fruits fall to the ground where the petrels move about , sticking to their feathers and making flight impossible . 
 Exploitation has decreased in importance as a threat . Other threats include the ingestion of plastic flotsam . Once swallowed , plastic can cause a general decline in the fitness of the bird , or in some cases lodge in the gut and cause a blockage , leading to death by starvation . It can also be picked up by foraging adults and fed to chicks , stunting their development and reducing the chances of successfully fledging . Procellariids are also vulnerable to marine pollution , as well as oil spills . Some species , such as Barau 's petrel , Newell 's shearwater and Cory 's shearwater , which nest high up on large developed islands , are victims of light pollution . Fledging chicks are attracted to streetlights and may then be unable to reach the sea . An estimated 20 to 40 percent of fledging Barau 's petrels and 45 to 60 percent of fledging Cory 's shearwater are attracted to the streetlights on Réunion and Tenerife , respectively . 
 = = Taxonomy and systematics = = 
 Procellariiformes comes from the Latin word procella , which means a violent wind or a storm , and <unk> for order . The order was named Procellariiformes by German anatomist Max Fürbringer in 1888 . 
 Until the beginning of the 20th century , the family Hydrobatidae was named Procellariidae , and the family now called Procellariidae was rendered " <unk> . " The order itself was called <unk> . A major early work on this group is Frederick <unk> Godman 's Monograph of the Petrels , five fascicles , 1907 – 1910 , with figures by John Gerrard Keulemans . 
 In the Sibley @-@ Ahlquist taxonomy , the tubenoses were included in a greatly enlarged order " Ciconiiformes " . This taxonomic treatment was almost certainly erroneous , but its assumption of a close evolutionary relationship with other " higher waterbirds " – such as loons ( <unk> ) and penguins ( Sphenisciformes ) – appears to be correct . The Procellariiformes are ( 2014 ) considered to be most closely related to penguins , having diverged from them about 60 million years ago . 
 There are around 125 living species of Procellariiformes worldwide , and the order is traditionally divided into four extant families , with one <unk> extinct : 
 Family † Diomedeoididae ( Early Oligocene – Early Miocene ) is an extinct group that had narrow beaks and feet with wide , flat phalanges , especially on the fourth toe . 
 Family Procellariidae ( shearwaters , fulmarine petrels , gadfly petrels , and prions ) are a varied group of small or medium @-@ sized seabirds , the largest being the giant petrels . They are heavy for their size , with a high wing loading , so they need to fly fast . Most , except the giant petrels , have weak legs and are nearly helpless on land . 
 Family Diomedeidae ( albatrosses ) are very large seabirds with a large strong hooked bill . They have strong legs , enabling them to walk well on land . 
 Family Hydrobatidae ( storm petrels ) are among the smallest seabirds , with fluttering flight and long but weak legs . Most have dark upperparts and a white underside . 
 Family <unk> ( diving petrels ) are small with short bills and wings , and a whirring flight low over the water and through wave @-@ crests . 
 The Hydrobatidae 's two subfamilies , Oceanitinae and Hydrobatinae , are probably better treated as distinct families . However , the traditional view may not correctly represent the <unk> ' phylogeny . The storm petrels are two separate clades . All other tubenoses are part of the albatross clade . The diving petrels are a clade , but within a larger clade of true petrels that also contains the gadfly petrels . Most fossil species broadly resemble living tubenoses , including the oldest confirmed record , <unk> septentrionalis from the Oligocene in Belgium . 
 DNA evidence has confirmed common ancestry for all Procellariiformes , though the taxonomy within the order is complex and fluctuating . Fossils of a bird similar to a petrel from the Eocene have been found in the London Clay and in Louisiana . Diving petrels occurred in the Miocene , with a species from that family ( <unk> <unk> ) being described in 2007 . The most numerous fossils from the Paleogene are those from the extinct family Diomedeoididae , fossils of which have been found in Central Europe and Iran . 
 = Serbian State Guard = 
 The Serbian State Guard ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : Srpska državna straža or SDS , <unk> <unk> <unk> ; German : <unk> <unk> ) was an auxiliary paramilitary force used to impose law and order within the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia during the German military occupation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in World War II . It was formed from two former Yugoslav gendarmerie regiments , was created with the approval of the German military authorities , and for a long period was controlled by the Higher SS and Police Leader in the Territory . It was also known as the <unk> after the leader of the Serbian pro @-@ Axis puppet government , General Milan Nedić , who eventually gained control of its operations . It assisted the Germans in imposing one of the most brutal occupation regimes in occupied Europe and helped guard and execute prisoners at the Banjica concentration camp in Belgrade . Its leaders and much of the rank and file were sympathetic to the Chetnik movement of Draža Mihailović , and it was purged by the Germans on several occasions for that reason . In October 1944 , as the Red Army closed on Belgrade , the SDS was transferred to Mihailović 's control by a member of the fleeing Nedić administration , but it quickly disintegrated during its withdrawal west , with only a small number of former SDS members being captured by the British near the Italian @-@ Yugoslav border in May 1945 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Following the Axis invasion , occupation and dismantling of Yugoslavia in April 1941 , the Wehrmacht established the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia under a military government of occupation . The territory included most of Serbia proper , with the addition of the northern part of Kosovo ( around Kosovska Mitrovica ) , and the Banat . It was the only area of the partitioned Kingdom of Yugoslavia in which the German occupants established a military government , to exploit the key rail and riverine transport routes that passed through it , and its valuable resources , particularly non @-@ ferrous metals . The Military Commander in Serbia appointed Serbian puppet governments to " carry on administrative chores under German direction and supervision " . On 29 August 1941 , the Germans appointed the Government of National Salvation ( Vlada <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ) under General Milan Nedić , to replace the short @-@ lived Commissioner Administration . 
 = = = Formation = = = 
 The Serbian State Guard ( or SDS ) was established by Nedić on the basis of an understanding he reached with the German Military Commander in Serbia , General der Artillerie ( Lieutenant General ) Paul Bader , and the Higher SS and Police Leader in Serbia , SS @-@ Obergruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Polizei ( SS @-@ General of Police ) August Meyszner , regarding the maintenance of law and order in the occupied territory . It was formed on 10 February 1942 from two former Yugoslav gendarmerie regiments , <unk> and <unk> , but the law formally creating the force was not issued by Nedić until 2 March 1942 . The SDS took over the role and functions of the gendarmerie , and was initially commanded by Stevan Radovanović . Sources vary on the strength of the SDS . The Germans initially set a maximum strength of 17 @,@ 000 , but the SDS quickly reached a strength of 18 @,@ 500 . Initially the SDS included four groups , the Rural Police ( <unk> straža ) , the Municipal Police ( <unk> straža ) , the Frontier ( or Border ) Guard ( <unk> straža ) , and the Village Guard ( seljačka straža ) . The SDS was equipped using arms and ammunition captured by the Germans from throughout Europe , and was organised as a largely static force split across five regions ( oblasts ) : Belgrade , Kraljevo , Niš , Valjevo and Zaječar , with one battalion per region . Each region was further divided into three districts ( <unk> ) , each of which included one or more SDS companies . A branch of the SDS was created specifically for service in the Banat , and was known as the Banat State Guard . It was formed from the region 's German minority ( or Volksdeutsche ) , and in March 1942 numbered less than one thousand . 
 Nedić intended that the SDS would not only maintain law and order and guard the borders , but also monitor the people 's requirements and offer assistance and protection in areas such as " health care , cultural , educational and economic life " . The SDS was royalist and was rapidly infiltrated by Chetniks loyal to Draža Mihailović . It also lacked sufficient officers , and although it had some initial successes , it never developed into an effective military force . Meyszner took overall control of the SDS three days after its formation , a decision which was strongly opposed by Nedić . 
 = = = Operations = = = 
 Along with other collaborationist military and paramilitary units , the SDS was used against the Partisans operating within the Territory . In late 1941 , prior to the formation of the SDS , the Serbian gendarmerie had participated in the German @-@ led Operation Uzice , which drove the Partisans and Chetniks from the Užice area . The SDS routinely executed captured Partisans , and frequently took and murdered hostages in towns and villages . The SDS also included former members of the gendarmerie that had assisted German troops to round up hostages to be shot at both Kraljevo and Kragujevac in October 1941 . In July 1941 , the Banjica concentration camp had been established in the suburbs of Belgrade . It was initially guarded by both the Gestapo and the SDS , but sole responsibility was eventually transferred to the SDS , who behaved sadistically and violently towards the inmates . Survivors of the camp stated that executions at the camp were carried out by both the Belgrade Special Police and the SDS , and that those executed included children . A total of 3 @,@ 849 people were killed at the camp before it was closed on 3 October 1944 . The SDS became increasingly unpopular with the population as time went on . Despite their limited independence , the SDS actively engaged in dehumanising Jews , Roma and communist Serbs , and in killing people from those groups or delivering them to the Germans for execution . They engaged in the execution of hostages both under Gestapo or Wehrmacht control and at their own initiative . The SDS clashed with other collaborationist formations at times , specifically Dimitrije Ljotić 's Serbian Volunteer Corps ( Srpski dobrovoljački korpus or SDK ) , and the Pećanac Chetniks loyal to vojvoda Kosta Pećanac . 
 In March 1942 , Nedić suggested to the Germans that the SDK and Pećanac Chetniks be incorporated into the SDS and that he take control of the force , but this idea was firmly rejected . In mid @-@ 1942 , Meyszner appointed Dragomir Jovanović , the German @-@ approved mayor and chief of police of Belgrade , as chief of Serbian State Security , which included responsibility for the SDS . The Germans considered that Radovanović was a Mihailović sympathiser , so in June 1942 he was replaced by Colonel Borivoje Jonić , the brother of Nedić 's minister of education , Velibor Jonić . In July 1942 the SDS consisted of 15 @,@ 000 – 20 @,@ 000 men . In August and September 1942 , Nedić again tried to have the SDS placed under his command , and the German refusal to do so contributed to him tendering his resignation . Nedić had threatened to resign several times previously for similar reasons , but on this occasion the Germans took it more seriously and offered him an audience with Adolf Hitler . On that basis , Nedić remained at his post . In October 1942 , the Border Guard was transferred to the Ministry of Finance . Also in 1942 , the Gestapo arrested some SDS officers suspected of having links with Mihailović , and by the end of 1942 the Germans had purged the SDS in an attempt to eliminate those who sympathised with Mihailović . One of the senior SDS officers arrested by the Gestapo during the purge was Lieutenant Colonel Milan Kalabić , the prefect of Požarevac , and father of one of Mihailović 's unit commanders , Nikola Kalabić . The elder Kalabić had been passing information , arms and ammunition to Mihailović 's Chetniks . In October 1943 , Milan Kalabić was executed by the Germans along with other Chetnik commanders and men . 
 By 1943 , most of the rank and file of the SDS was sympathetic to Mihailović 's Chetniks , and SDS units were regularly being " disarmed " by them , sometimes even staging mock battles to disguise transfers of much needed weapons and ammunition to Mihailović 's forces . Jovanović himself provided financial assistance to Mihailović from his own discretionary funds . In April 1943 , units of the SDS were praised by German commanders for their fighting against the Partisans near Bijeljina in eastern Bosnia . In June 1943 , the Germans rounded up and executed 1 @,@ 139 Serb civilians under suspicion that they had been collaborating with the resurgent Partisans . The SDS were involved in these crimes , and throughout 1943 were actively involved in committing atrocities against Serbian civilians . After many delays , on 18 September 1943 Nedić met with Hitler in Berlin and was promised that he would be given command of the SDS and the SDK . Upon his return to Belgrade , Nedić called upon the Military Commander in Serbia , General der Infanterie Hans Felber , to make arrangements for the transfer of command , but Felber advised him that he had received no orders to do so . It was not until 2 November 1943 that Nedić was finally given command of both the SDS and SDK . In late 1943 the SDS reached its maximum strength of 36 @,@ 716 men . By February 1944 , the SDS leadership were avoiding any direct confrontations with Mihailović 's Chetniks . 
 In the spring and summer of 1944 , the SDS had declined to a strength of around 24 @,@ 000 – 25 @,@ 000 men . With the return of the Partisans to Serbia proper , the SDS began to incur serious casualties . For example , between 15 March and 15 August 1944 , the SDS lost 157 men killed , 107 wounded and 26 missing . By August 1944 , SDS units were responding to Mihailović 's call for a general mobilisation by defecting openly to his Chetniks .

 Three days after the fall of the Nedić regime on 6 October 1944 , Felber transferred the command of the SDS to General Miodrag Damjanovič , the head of Nedić 's secretariat and a principal confidant of Mihailović within Nedić 's administration . Damjanovič immediately placed himself and the remaining 6 @,@ 500 troops of the SDS under Mihailović 's command . The SDS was then renamed the " Serbian Shock Corps ( Srpski <unk> korpus or SUK ) of the Yugoslav Army in the Homeland " once again under the command of Radovanović and it joined the withdrawal of other Chetnik formations towards the Sandžak region then into northeastern Bosnia . This arrangement resulted in a difficult and uneasy alliance which began to disintegrate under the pressures of the withdrawal . 
 In the last days of December 1944 , the SUK participated , along with other Chetnik formations , in an unsuccessful attempt to capture the Partisan @-@ held city of Tuzla in northeastern Bosnia . This failure and mutual recriminations between Mihailović 's Chetniks and the SUK resulted in the effective disintegration of the SUK . By mid @-@ January 1945 , 5 @,@ 000 former SDS members had rejoined the Germans , with some returning to Serbia to take advantage of Josip Broz Tito 's amnesty . Most were transported to Austria where they were used in labour battalions under the direction of Organisation Todt , but about 1 @,@ 500 were allowed to move to the Ljubljana Gap area , where they could join other collaborationist forces , such as the SDK or the Chetnik formations of Momčilo Đujić or Dobroslav Jevđević . Mihailović was not concerned about their departure , describing the former SDS troops as the " worst troops in the world " . 
 The remnants of the SDS / SUK and Mihailović 's Chetniks remained under the overall command of Damjanovič as part of the Chetnik Šumadija Division . These Chetniks had been under the command of the SS since 12 December 1944 . They crossed the river Soča and surrendered to the British near the Italian @-@ Yugoslav border on 5 May 1945 . Fortunately for them , they were interned as prisoners of war and other than a few senior officers , were not repatriated to Yugoslavia to face trial .
