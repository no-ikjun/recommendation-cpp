 Deurne airfield was to be destroyed by Jagdgeschwader 77 ( JG 77 ) . Antwerp housed the largest Allied contingent of nine Squadrons . It had been incessantly attacked by V1 and V2 flying bombs and had been given a strong anti @-@ aircraft defence . 
 At 08 : 00 , two formations 18 Bf 109s of I and III . / JG 77 took off with their pathfinders . At the same time 23 Bf 109s of II . / JG 77 took off . Around the <unk> area they formed up with the other two Gruppen . Heading south and still north of Antwerp , JG 77 passed Woensdrecht airfield . It was home to No. 132 Wing RAF and its five Spitfire squadrons ; No. 331 Squadron RAF , No. 332 Squadron RAF ( Norwegian ) , No. 66 Squadron RAF and No. 127 Squadron RAF , and No. 322 Squadron RAF ( Dutch ) . Some pilots from II . / JG 77 either mistakenly believed it to be Antwerp , or thought the opportunity was too good to pass up . Two German fighters were claimed shot down , and one pilot captured . However , none of the JG 77 casualties fit this description . 
 The main body continued to Antwerp . Some 12 – 30 German fighters attacked the airfield from 09 : 25 to 09 : 40 . The ground defences were alert and the German formations attacked in a disorganised manner . 145 Wing RAF was missed completely and considering the large number of targets the destruction was light ; just 12 Spitfires were destroyed . 
 In total , 14 Allied aircraft were destroyed and nine damaged . JG 77 lost 11 Bf 109s and their pilots were lost . Six were killed and five captured according to Allied sources . However , German records show the loss of only 10 pilots . Four are listed as captured . 
 = = = Metz @-@ <unk> = = = 
 Jagdgeschwader 53 ( JG 53 ) was tasked with the operation against the USAAF airfield at Metz @-@ <unk> Air Base . Stab . , II . , III . , and IV . / JG 53 were available . III . / JG 53 was to destroy anti @-@ aircraft installations in the Metz area , while the other Gruppen knocked out the airfields . 
 The USAAF XIX Tactical Air Command had established a strong presence in northeast France and was supporting the U.S. 3rd Army . JG 53 was to knock out its airfields . Some 26 Bf 109s took off but were intercepted by 12 P @-@ 47s of the 367th Fighter Squadron , 358th Fighter Group . The P @-@ 47s claimed 13 destroyed , one probable and six damaged for no losses . On the way home at 09 : 20 , III . / JG 53 were intercepted by 366th Fighter Squadron . Altogether , III . / JG 53 lost 10 Bf 109s and one damaged to the 358th Fighter Group . Of the 25 III . / JG 53 Bf 109s that took part , 11 were shot down representing 40 % of the attacking force . The 358th Fighter Group received the Distinguished Unit citation for preventing the attack on the 362nd Fighter Groups airfield . 
 Although III . / JG 53 failed , the main attack was a success by comparison . Stab , . II. and IV . / JG 53 encountered no difficulties on the outward leg . The Germans caused significant damage among the parked USAAF fighters on the field . When the attack against the Metz airfield was over , the three JG 53 Gruppen reported the loss of 20 Bf 109s and seven damaged . This represented more than 50 percent of the attacking 52 fighters . Some 13 pilots were missing ; three were killed , six remain missing as of today , and four were captured . A further three were wounded . JG 53 claimed 27 USAAF fighters on the ground and eight damaged . Added to this total is four aerial victories . In total JG 53 lost 30 Bf 109s and eight damaged in the two operations . This was a total loss of 48 % . The losses of the USAAF were 22 destroyed , 11 damaged ( all P @-@ <unk> ) . However , the negative effects of Bodenplatte on JG 53 outweighed any advantages gained . 
 = = = Le Culot and Ophoven = = = 
 Le Culot airfield ( later known as Beauvechain ) was 45 km ( 28 mi ) northeast of Charleroi and was the target of Jagdgeschwader 4 ( JG 4 ) target . The main strip ( A @-@ 89 ) was known locally as Beauvechain , and an auxiliary field known as Le Culot East ( Y @-@ 10 ) , known to the locals as <unk> , was nearby . It was known to the Luftwaffe because several of its units had operated there . 
 Geschwaderkommodore Major Gerhard Michalski commanded the force . Five pilots were shot down by ground fire . Another pilot got lost during the flight and ended up near Eindhoven where he was shot down and killed . Reduced in number , 8 – 10 fighters of IV . / JG 4 continued to their target . After 10 minutes , they located a fairly large airfield and attacked , believing it to be Le Culot . It was in fact Sint @-@ Truiden . 
 The mistake was easy to make , Le Culot was located nearby . Sint @-@ Truiden housed the 48th Fighter Group and <unk> Fighter Group . The <unk> Fighter Squadron was readying to take off at 09 : 20 . JG 4 hit the airfield at 09 : 15 . Several P @-@ 47s taxiing out were abandoned by pilots and strafed to destruction . The small @-@ scale attack by JG had achieved considerable damage . Total American losses were 10 destroyed and 31 damaged . The Germans lost eight fighters , including seven Bf 109s , and three damaged . No damage was done at Le Culot airfield . 
 II ( Sturm ) . / JG 4 took off for Le Culot at 08 : 08 . Getting lost , they stumbled upon Asch airfield and claimed one P @-@ 47 destroyed and two twin @-@ engine aircraft damaged , as well as two trains and trucks destroyed . The unit claimed an Auster reconnaissance aircraft shot down . The machine was probably a Stinson L @-@ 1 Vigilant of the 125th Liaison Squadron , U.S. Army . However , virtually the entire Gruppe of 17 Fw 190s was wiped out . 
 I. and III . / JG 4 were to strike Le Culot together . Taking off at 08 : 20 and heading northwest , they comprised a force of 35 Bf 109s ( nine from III . / JG 4 ) . Two Ju <unk> @-@ 1s of II . / NJG 101 lead as pathfinders . Some of I. / JG 4 attacked No. 125 Wing RAF Spitfires at Ophoven airfield . Spitfire losses are unclear . Two P @-@ 47s and a B @-@ 17 were destroyed . I. / JG 4 reported two Bf 109s missing , one damaged and one destroyed . Just a hangar , one P @-@ 47 and several vehicles were claimed , and the anti @-@ aircraft battery was silenced . The attack on the Spitfires at Ophoven and the mentioned B @-@ 17 and two P @-@ 47s are not included in the total . Another source suggests two Spitfires destroyed and 10 damaged at Ophoven . 
 According to one source , JG 4 ′ s losses were 25 fighters of the 55 that took part . With 17 pilots killed or missing and seven captured , JG 4 suffered a 42 % loss rate . A more recent source claims a total of 75 aircraft of JG 4 took part , with only 12 attacking ground targets . Two Ju 88 pathfinders were lost , as well as 26 fighters with six more damaged . 
 = = = Asch = = = 
 The Asch Airfield had been constructed in November 1944 and was home to the 352nd Fighter Group , 8th Air Force , and the 366th Fighter Group , Ninth Air Force . Jagdgeschwader 11 ( JG 11 ) was to destroy the airfield . I. / JG 11 had only 16 Fw 190s on strength and only six fit and operational pilots . Only six of I. / JG 1 ′ s pilots took part , and just four of Stab . / JG 1 ′ s pilots participated . III . / JG 11 had more aircraft than pilots , and so other Staffel made up the numbers . Just 41 Fw 190s of JG 11 took part in Bodenplatte ; four from the Stab . , six from I Gruppe and 31 of III Gruppe . The 20 fighters from II . Gruppe were Bf 109s . 
 The plan called for a low @-@ level strike by I and III . / JG 11 , while II . / JG 11 flew as top cover against USAAF fighters . The pilots were shown maps and photographs of the airfield , but were not told the targets ' identity until the morning of the attack . After crossing Allied lines , four fighters were lost to AAA fire . The course of JG 11 took it directly over Ophoven . Large formations of JG 11 attacked , in the mistaken belief it was Asch . The other half continued to Asch . Ophoven housed No. 125 Wing RAF , just 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) north of Asch . About half , or some 30 Fw 190s and Bf 109s attacked the airfield . 
 Asch was notable for a chance event . The 390th Squadron of the 366th Fighter Group had launched two fighter sweeps that morning , which played a crucial role in the failure of JG 11 ′ s attack . The leader of the <unk> squadron , 352nd Fighter Group , John Charles Meyer , anticipated German activity and had a flight of 12 P @-@ 51s about to take off on a combat patrol when the attack began . They took off under fire . 
 Several pilots made " Ace " status that day . No P @-@ 51s were lost ; two were damaged and one was damaged on the ground . The 336th Fighter Group lost one P @-@ 47 . The 366th was credited with eight kills , and AAA claimed seven more . However , overclaiming is likely . Luftwaffe records indicate JG 11 lost 28 fighters . Four German pilots ( two wounded ) made it back to German @-@ held territory , while four were captured and the remaining twenty were killed . Some 24 of the Bf 109s and Fw 190s lost were lost over enemy lines . German ace Günther Specht was among those German pilots killed . 
 Little is known about the claims of JG 11 . According to one German document , 13 fighters , two twin @-@ engine and one four @-@ engine aircraft were claimed destroyed . Five fighters were claimed damaged on " <unk> airfield " — in reality it was Ophoven . Ten aerial victories and one probable were also claimed . But U.S. Fighter Group losses indicate these claims are excessive . 
 The Americans claimed 35 kills . Only 14 can be judged with a degree of certainty to have been shot down by USAAF fighters , and possibly two more . Four are confirmed to have been shot down by AAA fire . Total JG 11 losses were 28 . The air battle over Asch had lasted 45 minutes . 
 = = = Brussels @-@ Evere / Grimbergen = = = 
 Jagdgeschwader 26 ( JG 26 ) and the III . Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 54 ( JG 54 ) were to strike at Brussels @-@ Evere . At the end of December , II . / JG 26 had 39 D @-@ 9s and III . / JG 26 had 45 Bf 109s . Records of available aircraft indicate 110 aircraft of JG 26 flew that day ; all but 29 were Fw 190s , the remainder were Bf 109s . 17 Fw 190s from III . / JG 54 took part with JG 26 . 
 Unknown to the Luftwaffe the Grimbergen Airfield was almost completely abandoned . The Evere airfield was located to the south . It was one of the most densely populated airfields in Belgium and had plenty of targets . The main force consisted of 60 Spitfire <unk> of No. 127 Wing RAF . Also present were B @-@ 17s and B @-@ 24s of the Eighth Air Force . Overall , well over 100 aircraft were on the field . 
 At 08 : 13 , the first formations took off . In total , 64 Fw 190D @-@ 9s participated . Before the target was reached , some 14 D @-@ 9s were forced to turn back due to AAA damage or mechanical difficulties . Three Fw 190s were lost to German AAA fire . At 09 : 10 , when the front was reached , Allied heavy AAA units began to engage the formation and another five were shot down . Most of the fire was from British Naval AAA defences defending the Scheldt Estuary . As the formation crossed the Dutch and Belgian border , I. / JG 26 and III . / JG 54 were intercepted by Spitfires . Five of the Fw 190s were shot down . I. / JG 26 destroyed or damaged the few aircraft at the airfield . AAA defences claimed five kills and I. / JG 26 reported two Fw 190s lost to Spitfires . Several others were lost over the airfield . Other losses occurred against friendly fire again on the return flight . 
 The raid was a disaster . Just six machines were destroyed at Grimbergen for the loss of 21 Fw 190s and two damaged . Another eight sustained minor damage . Some 17 pilots were missing , eight of whom would survive as prisoners . 
 Only II. and III . / JG 26 hit Evere . Between 44 and 52 Fw 190s from these units took off . II. and III . / JG 26 knocked out the flak towers and destroyed anything combustible : hangars , trucks , fuel dumps and aircraft . 127 Wing RCAF lost one Spitfire in the air and 11 on the ground ; 11 vehicles were damaged and one was destroyed . A total of 60 – 61 Allied aircraft were destroyed at Evere . A large number of transports were located there and attracted the attention of German pilots , which left many more Spitfires undamaged . Given the number of Spitfires on the field , the Canadian wing suffered " low " losses . The Canadian Wing Commander — Johnnie Johnson — blamed the poor marksmanship of German pilots for failing to achieve further success . 
 Allied losses are given at Evere as 32 fighters , 22 twin @-@ engine aircraft and 13 four @-@ engine aircraft destroyed , plus another nine single , six twin and one four @-@ engine aircraft damaged . In total , II . / JG 26 losses included 13 Fw 190s destroyed and two damaged . Nine of its pilots were missing ; five were killed and four captured . III . / JG 26 lost six Bf 109s and four pilots . Only one of them was captured , the remainder were killed . The amount of damage the Germans inflicted made up for the losses ; the Evere strike was a success . 
 = = = Brussels @-@ Melsbroek = = = 
 Jagdgeschwader 27 and IV . / Jagdgeschwader 54 ( JG 27 and JG 54 ) targeted Melsbroek airfield . On 31 December , JG 27 could only muster the following operational pilots and aircraft : 22 ( 22 ) from I. , 19 ( 13 ) from II . , 13 ( 15 ) from III . , and 16 ( 17 ) from IV . Gruppe . <unk> Wolfgang Späte had rebuilt IV . / JG 54 . It had only 21 pilots and 15 of its 23 Fw 190s were operational . Altogether 28 Bf 109s of JG 27 and 15 Fw 190s of JG 54 took off . Seven fighters were lost to enemy aircraft and friendly AAA fire before they reached the target . 
 The Germans hit Melsbroek hard . According to Emil Clade ( leading III . / JG 27 ) , the AAA positions were not manned , and aircraft were bunched together or in lines , which made perfect targets . The attack caused considerable damage among the units based there and was a great success . The Recce Wings had lost two entire squadrons worth of machines . No. 69 Squadron RAF lost 11 Vickers Wellingtons and two damaged . No. 140 Squadron RAF lost four Mosquitoes , the losses being made good the same day . At least five Spitfires from No. 16 Squadron RAF were destroyed . No. 271 Squadron RAF lost at least seven Harrow transports " out of action " . A further 15 other aircraft were destroyed . 139 Wing reported five B @-@ 25s destroyed and five damaged . Some 15 to 20 USAAF bombers were also destroyed . Another source states that 13 Wellingtons were destroyed , as were five Mosquitoes , four Auster and five Avro Ansons from the Tactical Air Forces 2nd Communications Squadron . Three Spitfires were also lost and two damaged . At least one RAF Transport Command Douglas Dakota was destroyed . 
 The pilots of JG 27 and 54 claimed 85 kills and 40 damaged . German reconnaissance was able to confirm 49 kills . JG 27 suffered unacceptable losses ; 17 Bf 109s , 11 pilots killed , one wounded and three captured . IV . / JG 54 lost two killed and one captured . Three Fw 190s were lost and one damaged . 
 = = = Gilze @-@ Rijen and Eindhoven = = = 
 Jagdgeschwader 3 ( JG 3 ) and Kampfgeschwader 51 ( KG 51 ) were tasked with eliminating the Allied units at the Eindhoven base and Gilze @-@ Rijen airfield . The field contained three Spitfire Squadrons and eight Typhoon units of the RAF and RCAF . Some 22 Bf 109s of I. / JG 3 took off , along with four from Stab . / JG 3 , 15 from III . / JG 3 and 19 Fw 190s from IV . / JG 3 . KG 51 contributed some 21 of their 30 Messerschmitt Me 262 jets to the action . Some histories mistakenly include Kampfgeschwader 76 ( KG 76 ) on the order of battle , but KG 76 did not take part in the mission . 
 Each staffel was expected to make at least three firing passes . I. / JG 3 took off and joined the lead Gruppe , IV Sturm . / JG 3 , with III . / JG 3 following in the rear . The Bf 109s and Fw 190s of the Geschwader reached the area at about 09 : 20 . Geschwaderkommodore Heinrich Bär led the attack . Some pilots made four passes , destroying AAA emplacements , fuel storage stations and vehicles . Nearly 300 aircraft were on the field , along with huge stores of equipment and fuel . The attack caused fires all over the airfield . 
 JG 3 claimed 53 single @-@ engine and 11 twin @-@ engine aircraft destroyed . Five fighters and one four @-@ engine bomber were also claimed damaged . Four Typhoons , three Spitfires , one Tempest and another unidentified aircraft were claimed shot down . All in all , JG 3 managed to destroy 43 aircraft according to British records , and damage a further 60 , some seriously . The Geschwader believed it had destroyed 116 . JG 3 did not come away unscathed . I. / JG 3 lost nine of its aircraft and pilots , a 50 % loss rate . Damage to the returning Gruppe aircraft meant the entire unit was unserviceable . RAF AAA were credited with shooting down five . JG 3 lost , altogether , 15 of the 60 fighters sent , a 25 % loss rate . Some 15 pilots were missing ; nine were killed and five captured , and another pilot was posting as missing in action and his fate remains unknown . Another source says 16 pilots ; ten killed or missing and six captured . 
 The damage done to Eindhoven was significant and can be considered a victory for JG 3 . It was also assisted by elements of JG 6 which had misidentified Eindhoven as one their targets . The greatest losses were amongst the Recce Wing and the Canadian 124 Wing RCAF , which suffered 24 aircraft destroyed or damaged . The visiting 39 Wing RAF lost 30 aircraft destroyed or damaged . 143 Wing RCAF lost 29 damaged or destroyed . It is likely that I. / JG 3 was responsible for about 2 / 3 of the damage . Another source gives 47 aircraft destroyed and 43 damaged . 
 = = = Possible V @-@ 2 missile launch attempts = = = 
 At least one V @-@ 2 missile on a mobile Meillerwagen launch trailer was observed being elevated to launch position by a USAAF 4th Fighter Group pilot over the northern German attack route near the town of Lochem on 1 January 1945 . Possibly , from the potential sighting of the American fighter by the missile 's launch crew , the rocket was quickly lowered from a near launch @-@ ready 85 ° elevation to 30 ° . 
 = = Results of raid = = 
 The results of the raid are difficult to judge given the confusion over loss records . It is likely more aircraft were destroyed than listed . The Americans failed to keep a proper record of their losses and it appears the U.S. 8th Air Force losses were not included in loss totals . When these estimates and figures are added to the losses listed in the table below , it is likely that the correct figures are 232 destroyed ( 143 single @-@ engine , 74 twin @-@ engine and 15 four @-@ engine ) and 156 damaged ( 139 single @-@ engine , 12 twin @-@ engine and five four @-@ engine ) . Researching individual squadron records confirms the destruction of even more USAAF aircraft . This suggests at least a further 16 B @-@ 17s , 14 B @-@ 24s , eight P @-@ 51s , and at least two P @-@ 47s were destroyed on top of that total . A total of 290 destroyed and 180 damaged seems a more realistic summation than the conservative figures given by the USAAF , RAF , and RCAF . Including the 15 Allied aircraft shot down and 10 damaged in aerial combat , 305 destroyed and 190 damaged is the sum total of the attack . 
 Number can 't hide the fact that it was a disaster for Germans . Both sides had many backup planes so the main limiting factor for air forces was the number of trained pilots . The Allies lost , most of the time , empty fighters on the <unk> while the Germans lost crewed fighters . As a consequence pilot losses were completely different . Allies : 12 pilots KIA in planes and 12 KIA or wounded on the ground Germans : 238 pilots KIA or POW . This total does not include wounded . 
 The results of the attacks are listed : little to no damage light damage medium damage heavy damage 
 = = Aftermath and casualties = = 
 The operation achieved tactical surprise , but it was undone by poor execution and low pilot skill ( owing to poor training ) . The operation failed to achieve its aim and that failure was very costly to German air power . Some of the units of the RAF , RCAF and USAAF on the receiving end of Bodenplatte had been badly hit , others not so badly , but most had sustained some losses . The Germans , however , launched Bodenplatte under a set of conditions , such as poor planning and low pilot skill , which clearly indicated any advantage gained would be outweighed by possible losses . Bodenplatte weakened the Jagdwaffe past any hope of rebuilding . General der Jagdflieger Adolf Galland said , " We sacrificed our last substance " . 
 The Luftwaffe lost 143 pilots killed and missing , while 70 were captured and 21 wounded including three Geschwaderkommodore , five Gruppenkommandeure , and 14 Staffelkapitäne — the largest single @-@ day loss for the Luftwaffe . Many of the formation leaders lost were experienced veterans , which placed even more pressure on those who were left . Thus , Bodenplatte was a very short @-@ term success but a long @-@ term failure . Allied losses were soon made up , while lost Luftwaffe aircraft and especially pilots were irreplaceable . German historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that it left the Germans " weaker than ever and incapable of mounting any major attack again " . 
 In the remaining 17 weeks of war the Jagdwaffe struggled to recover sufficiently from the 1 January operation to remain an effective force . In strategic terms , German historian Werner <unk> wrote , " Operation Bodenplatte amounted to a total defeat " . The exhausted German units were no longer able to mount an effective defence of German air space during Operation Plunder and Operation Varsity , the Allied crossing of the Rhine River , or the overall Western Allied invasion of Germany . Subsequent operations were insignificant as a whole , and could not challenge Allied air supremacy . The only service in the Luftwaffe capable of profitable sorties was the night fighter force . In the last six weeks of the war the Luftwaffe was to lose another 200 pilots killed . <unk> wrote , " it was not until the autumn of 1944 that the German fighter forces set foot down the sacrificial path ; and it was the controversial Operation Bodenplatte that dealt this force a mortal blow and sealed its fate . What happened from then on was no more than a dying flicker " .

 Shahid Kapoor ( pronounced [ <unk> ̪ kəˈpuːr ] ; born 25 February 1981 ) , also known as Shahid Khattar , is an Indian actor who appears in Hindi films . The son of actors Pankaj Kapur and Neelima Azeem , Kapoor was born in New Delhi . His parents separated when he was three , and he continued living with his mother . They moved to Mumbai when has was 10 , where he joined Shiamak Davar 's dance academy . Kapoor appeared as a background dancer in a few films of the 1990s , and was later featured in music videos and television commercials . 
 Kapoor made his film debut in 2003 with a leading role in the romantic comedy Ishq Vishk , a sleeper hit for which he won a Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut . He followed it with roles in several commercial failures before starring opposite Amrita Rao in Sooraj Barjatya 's top @-@ grossing family drama Vivah ( 2006 ) . Kapoor earned nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for portraying a troubled businessman in Imtiaz Ali 's romantic comedy Jab We Met ( 2007 ) and twin brothers in Vishal Bhardwaj 's caper thriller Kaminey ( 2009 ) . After appearing in another series of box office flops , he starred in the action film R ... Rajkumar ( 2013 ) — his highest @-@ grossing release . In 2014 , Kapoor portrayed the Hamlet character in Bhardwaj 's acclaimed drama Haider , for which he won the Best Actor award at Filmfare , and in 2016 , he played a drug abusing singer in the crime drama Udta Punjab . 
 Cited in the media as one of the most attractive Indian celebrities , Kapoor maintains his popularity despite a fluctuating career trajectory . Initially recognised for portraying romantic roles , Kapoor has since taken on parts in action films and thrillers . He is the recipient of several awards , including two Filmfare Awards . In addition to acting , Kapoor supports charities , hosts award ceremonies , and has featured as a talent judge on the dance reality show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa Reloaded ( 2015 ) . Following a romantic relationship with the actress Kareena Kapoor , he married Mira Rajput , a student from New Delhi , in 2015 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Shahid Kapoor was born in New Delhi on 25 February 1981 to actor Pankaj Kapur and actor @-@ dancer Neelima Azeem . His parents divorced when he was three years old ; his father shifted to Mumbai ( and married the actress Supriya Pathak ) and Kapoor continued living in Delhi with his mother and maternal grandparents . His grandparents were journalists for the Russian magazine Sputnik , and Kapoor was particularly fond of his grandfather : " He would walk me to school every single day . He would talk to me about dad , with whom he shared a great relationship , and read out his letters to me . " His father , who was then a struggling actor in Mumbai , would visit Kapoor only once a year on his birthday . When Kapoor was 10 , his mother , who was working as a dancer , moved to Mumbai to work as an actress . 
 In Mumbai , Azeem went on to marry the actor Rajesh Khattar . Kapoor continued living with his mother and Khattar , until they separated in 2001 . Kapoor continues to use the last name Khattar on his passport . He has a maternal half @-@ brother from his mother 's marriage to Khattar . From his father 's marriage to Pathak , he has two paternal half @-@ siblings . Kapoor was educated at the Gyan Bharati School in Delhi and <unk> Vidyalaya in Mumbai . He later attended Mumbai 's Mithibai College for three years . 
 Kapoor was interested in dance from an early age , and at the age of 15 , he joined Shiamak Davar 's dance institute . As a student there , Kapoor appeared as a background dancer in the films Dil To Pagal Hai ( 1997 ) and Taal ( 1999 ) , in which Davar served as choreographer . During a stage show at the institute , Kapoor performed in the songs " Vogue " and " GoldenEye " to a positive response from the audience ; he described the experience as the first time that he " felt like a star " . He later became an instructor at the institute . During this time , Kapoor accompanied a friend to an audition for a Pepsi commercial featuring the stars Shah Rukh Khan , Kajol and Rani Mukerji , but wound up with the part himself . He appeared in television commercials for the brands Kit Kat and Close @-@ Up , among others , and featured in music videos for several performers , including the band Aryans and the singer Kumar Sanu . Kapoor also took on the job of an assistant director to his father on the 1998 television series Mohandas <unk>

 Having noticed Kapoor in the Aryans ' music video " <unk> Mein " , the producer Ramesh Taurani was keen to cast him in a film . However , upon meeting him , Taurani thought Kapoor , who was 20 years old at the time , to be too young and underweight to become an actor , and encouraged him to wait for a few years . Kapoor , meanwhile , turned down a lead role in N. Chandra 's sex comedy Style in hopes of working with Taurani . Taurani found a suitable project for Kapoor in the teenage romance Ishq Vishk ( 2003 ) , which Ken Ghosh was directing for his company . Kapoor , who trained extensively for a bulkier physical build , was eventually hired . Before beginning work on the film , he attended acting workshops with Naseeruddin Shah and <unk> Dubey . 
 Ishq Vishk tells the story of Rajiv Mathur ( Kapoor ) , a high @-@ school student who engages in a romantic affair with two classmates of contrasting personalities ( played by Amrita Rao and <unk> <unk> ) . Kapoor was attracted to the idea of playing an unlikable lead since it was a departure from the traditional portrayal of teenage heroes in Indian films . Writing for The Hindu , the critic Ziya Us Salam did not find him to be " hero material " , adding that " boyhood seems to have overstayed on his face – but he is not necessarily bad in the acting department . " The film , however , proved to be a sleeper hit at the box office and won Kapoor the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut . 
 Following his debut , Kapoor reunited with Ghosh in a film he considered to be drastically different from Ishq Vishk . The thriller Fida ( 2004 ) featured him as a love @-@ struck student who is manipulated by a woman ( Kareena Kapoor ) and her lover ( Fardeen Khan ) to rob a bank . Despite criticising the film , Rama Sharma of The Tribune wrote that Kapoor " shines in his role . He looks fresh . As an impulsive emotional and innocent guy , who is sucked into crime because of these very qualities , he manages to evoke your sympathies . " Later that year , Kapoor appeared in the romantic comedy Dil <unk> More in which he was paired opposite three women : Soha Ali Khan , Tulip Joshi , and Ayesha Takia . <unk> N of Rediff.com praised his dancing skills but was wary of his imitation of Shah Rukh Khan 's acting style . Both his 2004 releases were commercially unsuccessful . 
 The series of poorly received films continued in 2005 , when all three of Kapoor 's films failed at the box office . His first two releases that year were the comedies Deewane Huye <unk> and <unk> ! Life Ho Toh <unk> ! , both of which were largely panned . The former was plagiarised from the Hollywood film There 's Something About Mary in which Kapoor played one of Rimi Sen 's love interests ; the critic Khalid Mohamed found Kapoor to be " the only likeable element in this travesty " but Namrata Joshi of Outlook labelled him " colourless " and criticised his pairing with Sen. His final role was that of a righteous teenager drawn towards a life of indulgence in John Matthew <unk> 's drama Shikhar , co @-@ starring Ajay Devgan , Bipasha Basu and Amrita Rao . The critic Sukanya Verma found Kapoor to be miscast as a village boy in the film , but noted that he was " never short of spontaneity and youthful exuberance " .

 In 2006 , Kapoor played opposite Kareena Kapoor in two films — the thriller 36 China Town and the comedy Chup Chup Ke .

 Kapoor found no success in his first release of 2007 — the ensemble comedy Fool & Final . However , his second release that year , the Imtiaz Ali @-@ directed romantic comedy Jab We Met proved to be one of the top @-@ grossing films of the year .

Kapoor , a teetotaler , found it challenging to play a character who he deemed to be " all about addiction " .

Udta Punjab generated controversy when the Central Board of Film Certification demanded extensive censorship before its theatrical release , citing that the portrayal of Punjab in it was negative . The demands sparked a broad debate about the freedom of expression in India .

 = Atlantic hurricane = 
 An Atlantic hurricane or tropical storm is a tropical cyclone that forms in the Atlantic Ocean , usually in the summer or fall . Tropical cyclones can be categorized by intensity . Tropical storms have one @-@ minute maximum sustained winds of at least 39 mph ( 34 knots , 17 m / s , 63 km / h ) , while hurricanes have one @-@ minute maximum sustained winds exceeding 74 mph ( 64 knots , 33 m / s , 119 km / h ) . Most North Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes form between June 1 and November 30 . The United States National Hurricane Center monitors the basin and issues reports , watches , and warnings about tropical weather systems for the North Atlantic Basin as one of the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers for tropical cyclones , as defined by the World Meteorological Organization . 
 In recent times , tropical disturbances that reach tropical storm intensity are named from a predetermined list . Hurricanes that result in significant damage or casualties may have their names retired from the list at the request of the affected nations in order to prevent confusion should a subsequent storm be given the same name . On average , in the North Atlantic basin ( from 1966 to 2009 ) 11 @.@ 3 named storms occur each season , with an average of 6 @.@ 2 becoming hurricanes and 2 @.@ 3 becoming major hurricanes ( Category 3 or greater ) . The climatological peak of activity is around September 11 each season . 
 In March 2004 , Catarina was the first hurricane @-@ intensity tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Atlantic Ocean . Since 2011 , the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center has started to use the same scale of the North Atlantic Ocean for tropical cyclones in the South Atlantic Ocean and assign names to those which reach 35 kn ( 65 km / h ; 40 mph ) . 
 = = Steering factors = = 
 Tropical cyclones are steered by the surrounding flow throughout the depth of the troposphere ( the atmosphere from the surface to about eight miles ( 12 km ) high ) . Neil Frank , former director of the United States National Hurricane Center , used the analogies such as " a leaf carried along in a stream " or a " brick moving through a river of air " to describe the way atmospheric flow affects the path of a hurricane across the ocean . Specifically , air flow around high pressure systems and toward low pressure areas influence hurricane tracks . 
 In the tropical latitudes , tropical storms and hurricanes generally move westward with a slight tend toward the north , under the influence of the subtropical ridge , a high pressure system that usually extends east @-@ west across the subtropics . South of the subtropical ridge , surface easterly winds ( blowing from east to west ) prevail . If the subtropical ridge is weakened by an upper trough , a tropical cyclone may turn poleward and then recurve , or curve back toward the northeast into the main belt of the Westerlies . <unk> ( north ) of the subtropical ridge , westerly winds prevail and generally steer tropical cyclones that reach northern latitudes toward the east . The westerlies also steer extratropical cyclones with their cold and warm fronts from west to east . 
 = = Intensity = = 
 Generally speaking , the intensity of a tropical cyclone is determined by either the storm 's maximum sustained winds or lowest barometric pressure . The following table lists the most intense Atlantic hurricanes in terms of their lowest barometric pressure . In terms of wind speed , Hurricane Allen ( in 1980 ) was the strongest Atlantic tropical cyclone on record , with maximum sustained winds of 190 mph ( 310 km / h ) . However , these measurements are suspect since instrumentation used to document wind speeds at the time would likely succumb to winds of such intensity . Nonetheless , their central pressures are low enough to rank them among the strongest recorded Atlantic hurricanes . 
 Owing to their intensity , the strongest Atlantic hurricanes have all attained Category 5 classification . Hurricane Opal , the strongest Category 4 hurricane recorded , intensified to reach a minimum pressure of 916 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 05 inHg ) , a pressure typical of Category 5 hurricanes . Nonetheless , the pressure remains too high to list Opal as one of the ten strongest Atlantic tropical cyclones . Presently , Hurricane Wilma is the strongest Atlantic hurricane ever recorded , after reaching an intensity of 882 mbar ( hPa ; 26 @.@ 05 inHg ) in October 2005 ; this also made Wilma the strongest tropical cyclone worldwide outside of the West Pacific , where seven tropical cyclones have been recorded to intensify to lower pressures . However , this was later superseded by Hurricane Patricia in 2015 in the east Pacific , which had a pressure reading of 872 mbar . Preceding Wilma is Hurricane Gilbert , which had also held the record for most intense Atlantic hurricane for 17 years . The 1935 Labor Day hurricane , with a pressure of 892 mbar ( hPa ; 26 @.@ 34 inHg ) , is the third strongest Atlantic hurricane and the strongest documented tropical cyclone prior to 1950 . Since the measurements taken during Wilma and Gilbert were documented using dropsonde , this pressure remains the lowest measured over land . 
 Hurricane Rita is the fourth strongest Atlantic hurricane in terms of barometric pressure and one of three tropical cyclones from 2005 on the list , with the others being Wilma and Katrina at first and sixth , respectively . However , with a barometric pressure of 895 mbar ( hPa ; 26 @.@ 43 inHg ) , Rita is the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico . Hurricanes Camille , Mitch , and Dean share intensities for the seventh strongest Atlantic hurricane at 905 mbar ( hPa ; 26 @.@ 73 inHg ) . Sharing tenth place for most intense Atlantic tropical cyclone are Hurricane Ivan and an unnamed hurricane from 1932 , which both are listed to have deepened to a pressure as low as 910 mbar ( hPa ; 26 @.@ 88 inHg ) . 
 Many of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones weakened prior to their eventual landfall or demise . However , three of the storms remained intense enough at landfall to be considered some of the strongest landfalling hurricanes – three of the eleven hurricanes on the list constitute the three most intense Atlantic landfalls in recorded history . The 1935 Labor Day hurricane made landfall at peak intensity , making it the most intense Atlantic landfall . Though it weakened slightly before its eventual landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula , Hurricane Gilbert maintained a pressure of 900 mbar ( hPa ; 26 @.@ 58 inHg ) at landfall , making its landfall the second strongest . Similarly , Hurricane Dean made landfall on the peninsula , though it did so at peak intensity and with a higher barometric pressure ; its landfall marked the third strongest in Atlantic hurricane history . 
 = = Climatology = = 
 Climatology does serve to characterize the general properties of an average season and can be used as one of many other tools for making forecasts . Most storms form in warm waters several hundred miles north of the equator near the Intertropical convergence zone from tropical waves . The Coriolis force is usually too weak to initiate sufficient rotation near the equator . Storms frequently form in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico , the Caribbean Sea , and the tropical Atlantic Ocean as far east as the Cape Verde Islands , the origin of strong and long @-@ lasting Cape Verde @-@ type hurricanes . Systems may also strengthen over the Gulf Stream off the coast of the eastern United States , wherever water temperatures exceed 26 @.@ 5 ° C ( 79 @.@ 7 ° F ) . 
 Although most storms are found within tropical latitudes , occasionally storms will form further north and east from disturbances other than tropical waves such as cold fronts and upper @-@ level lows . These are known as baroclinically induced tropical cyclones . There is a strong correlation between Atlantic hurricane activity in the tropics and the presence of an El Niño or La Niña in the Pacific Ocean . El Niño events increase the wind shear over the Atlantic , producing a less @-@ favorable environment for formation and decreasing tropical activity in the Atlantic basin . Conversely , La Niña causes an increase in activity due to a decrease in wind shear . 
 According to the Azores High hypothesis by Kam @-@ <unk> Liu , an anti @-@ phase pattern is expected to exist between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the North American Atlantic coast . During the quiescent periods ( 3000 – 1400 BC , and 1000 AD to present ) , a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered toward the Atlantic coast . During the hyperactive period ( 1400 BC to 1000 AD ) , more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores High was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean . Such a displacement of the Azores High is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in Haiti around 3200 14C years BP , and a change towards more humid conditions in the Great Plains during the late @-@ Holocene as more moisture was pumped up the Mississippi Valley through the Gulf coast . Preliminary data from the northern Atlantic coast seem to support the Azores High hypothesis . A 3000 @-@ year proxy record from a coastal lake in Cape Cod suggests that hurricane activity has increased significantly during the past 500 – 1000 years , just as the Gulf coast was amid a quiescent period of the last millennium . 
 = = = Seasonal variation = = = 
 Climatologically speaking , approximately 97 percent of tropical cyclones that form in the North Atlantic develop between the dates of June 1 and November 30 – dates which delimit the modern @-@ day Atlantic hurricane season . Though the beginning of the annual hurricane season has historically remained the same , the official end of the hurricane season has shifted from its initial date of October 31 . Regardless , on average once every few years a tropical cyclone develops outside the limits of the season ; as of January 2016 there have been 66 tropical cyclones in the off @-@ season , with the most recent being Hurricane Alex in 2016 . The first tropical cyclone of the 1938 Atlantic hurricane season , which formed on January 3 , became the earliest forming tropical storm and hurricane after reanalysis concluded on the storm in December 2012 . 
 Hurricane Able in 1951 was initially thought to be the earliest forming major hurricane – a tropical cyclone with winds exceeding 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) – however following post @-@ storm analysis it was determined that Able only reached Category 1 strength which made Hurricane Alma of 1966 the new record holder ; as it became a major hurricane on June 8 . Though it developed within the bounds of the Atlantic hurricane season , Hurricane Audrey in 1957 became the earliest developing Category 4 hurricane on record after it reached the intensity on June 27 . The earliest @-@ forming Category 5 hurricane , Emily , reached the highest intensity on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale on July 17 , 2005 . 
 Though the official end of the Atlantic hurricane season occurs on November 30 , the dates of October 31 and November 15 have also historically marked the official end date for the hurricane season . December , the only month of the year after the hurricane season , has featured the cyclogenesis of fourteen tropical cyclones . Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005 was the latest tropical cyclone to attain tropical storm intensity as it did so on December 30 . However , the second Hurricane Alice in 1954 was the latest forming tropical cyclone to attain hurricane intensity . Both Zeta and Alice were the only two storms to exist in two calendar years – the former from 1954 to 1955 and the latter from 2005 to 2006 . No storms have been recorded to exceed Category 1 hurricane intensity in December . In 1999 , Hurricane Lenny reached Category 4 intensity on November 17 as it took an unprecedented west to east track across the Caribbean ; its intensity made it the latest developing Category 4 hurricane , though this was well within the bounds of the hurricane season . Hurricane Hattie ( October 27 @-@ November 1 , 1961 ) was initially thought to have been the latest forming Category 5 hurricane ever documented , though reanalysis indicated that a devastating hurricane in 1932 reached such an intensity at a later date . Consequently , this made the hurricane the latest developing tropical cyclone to reach all four Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale classifications past Category 1 intensity . 
 = = = = June = = = = 
 The beginning of the hurricane season is most closely related to the timing of increases in sea surface temperatures , convective instability , and other thermodynamic factors . Although June marks the beginning of the hurricane season , generally little activity occurs during the month with an average of 1 tropical cyclone every 2 years . Tropical systems usually form in the Gulf of Mexico or off the east coast of the United States . 
 Since 1851 , a total of 81 tropical storms and hurricanes formed in the month of June . During this period , two of these systems developed in the deep tropics east of the Lesser Antilles . Since 1870 , three major hurricanes have formed during June , most notably Hurricane Audrey in 1957 . Audrey ranks as the earliest forming Category 4 hurricane in the Atlantic basin . Audrey attained an intensity greater than that of any Atlantic tropical cyclone during June or July until Hurricanes Dennis and Emily of 2005 . The easternmost forming storm during June , Tropical Storm Ana in 1979 , formed at 45 ° W. 
 = = = = July = = = = 
 Not much tropical activity occurs during the month of July , but the majority of hurricane seasons see the formation of one tropical cyclone during July . From an average of Atlantic tropical cyclone seasons from 1944 to 1996 , the first tropical storm in half of the seasons occurred by 11 July , and a second formed by 8 August . 
 Formation usually occurs in the eastern Caribbean Sea around the Lesser Antilles , in the northern and eastern parts of the Gulf of Mexico , in the vicinity of the northern Bahamas , and off the coast of The Carolinas and Virginia over the Gulf Stream . Storms travel westward through the Caribbean and then either move towards the north and curve near the eastern coast of the United States or stay on a north @-@ westward track and enter the Gulf of Mexico . 
 Since 1851 , a total of 105 tropical storms have formed during the month of July . Since 1870 , ten of these storms reached major hurricane intensity . Only Hurricane Emily of 2005 , the strongest July tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin , attained Category 5 hurricane status during July , making it the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record . The easternmost forming storm and longest lived during the month of July , Hurricane Bertha in 2008 , formed at 22 @.@ 9 ° W and lasted 17 days . 
 = = = = August = = = = 
 Decrease in wind shear from July to August contributes to a significant increase of tropical activity . An average of 2 @.@ 8 Atlantic tropical storms develop annually in August . On average , four named tropical storms , including one hurricane , occur by August 30 , and the first intense hurricane develops by 4 September . 
 = = = = September = = = = 
 The peak of the hurricane season occurs in September and corresponds with low wind shear and the warmest sea surface temperatures . The month of September sees an average of 3 storms a year . By 24 September , the average Atlantic season features 7 named tropical storms , including 4 hurricanes . In addition , two major hurricanes occur on average by 28 September . Relatively few tropical cyclones make landfall at these intensities . 
 = = = = October = = = = 
 The favorable conditions found during September begin to decay in October . The main reason for the decrease in activity is increasing wind shear , although sea surface temperatures are also cooler than in September . Activity falls markedly with 1 @.@ 8 cyclones developing on average despite a climatological secondary peak around 20 October . By 21 October , the average season features 9 named storms with 5 hurricanes . A third major hurricane occurs after 28 September in half of all Atlantic tropical cyclone seasons . In contrast to mid @-@ season activity , the mean locus of formation shifts westward to the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico , reversing the eastward progression of June through August . 
 = = = = November = = = = 
 Wind shear from westerlies increases substantially through November , generally preventing cyclone formation . On average , one tropical storm forms during every other November . On rare occasions , a major hurricane occurs . The few intense hurricanes in November include Hurricane " Cuba " in late October and early November 1932 ( the strongest November hurricane on record peaking as a Category 5 hurricane ) , Hurricane Lenny in mid @-@ November 1999 , Hurricane Kate in late November 1985 ( the latest major hurricane on record ) , and Hurricane Paloma in early November 2008 . 
 = = = = December to May = = = = 
 Although the hurricane season is defined as beginning on June 1 and ending on November 30 , there have been several off @-@ season storms . Since 1870 , there have been 32 off @-@ season cyclones , 18 of which occurred in May . In the same time span , nine storms formed in December , two in April , and one each in January , February and March . During five years ( 1887 , 1953 , 2003 , 2007 , and 2012 ) , tropical cyclones formed in the North Atlantic Ocean both during or before May and during December . In 1887 , four storms occurred outside the season , the most in a single year . High vertical wind shear and low sea surface temperatures generally preclude tropical cyclone formation during the off @-@ season . 
 Tropical cyclones have formed in all months . Four tropical cyclones existed during the month of January , two of which formed during late December : the second Hurricane Alice in 1954 / 1955 , and Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005 / 2006 . The only two hurricanes to form in January are a Category 1 hurricane in the 1938 season , and Hurricane Alex in the 2016 season . A subtropical storm in January also began the 1978 Atlantic hurricane season . No major hurricanes have occurred in the off @-@ season . 
 = = Extremes = = 
 The season in which the most tropical storms formed on record was the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season ( 28 ) . That season was also the one in which the most hurricanes formed on record ( 15 ) . 
 The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season had the most major hurricanes on record ( 7 ) . The 1950 Atlantic hurricane season was once thought to have 8 , but a re @-@ analysis showed that several storms were weaker than thought , and thus the record is now held by the 2005 season . 
 The least active season on record since 1946 ( when the database is considered more reliable ) was the 1983 Atlantic hurricane season , with one tropical storm , two hurricanes , and one major hurricane . Overall , the 1914 Atlantic hurricane season remains the least active , with only one documented storm . 
 The most intense hurricane ( by barometric pressure ) on record to form in the North Atlantic basin was Hurricane Wilma ( 2005 ) ( 882 mbar ) . 
 The largest hurricane ( in gale diameter ) on record to form in the North Atlantic was Hurricane Sandy ( 2012 ) with a gale diameter of 1 @,@ 100 miles . 
 The longest @-@ lasting hurricane was the San Ciriaco 's Hurricane of 1899 , which lasted for 27 days and 18 hours as a tropical cyclone . 
 The longest @-@ tracked hurricane was Hurricane Faith , which travelled for 6 @,@ 850 miles as a tropical cyclone . Faith is also the northern most moving tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin . 
 The most tornadoes spawned by a hurricane was 127 by Hurricane Ivan ( 2004 season ) . 
 The strongest landfalling hurricane was the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 ( 892 hPa ) . 
 The deadliest hurricane was the Great Hurricane of 1780 ( 22 @,@ 000 fatalities ) . 
 The deadliest hurricane to make landfall on the continental United States was the Galveston Hurricane in 1900 which may have killed up to 12 @,@ 000 people . 
 The most damaging hurricane ( adjusted for inflation ) was Hurricane Katrina of the 2005 season which caused $ 108 billion in damages ( 2005 USD ) . 
 The quickest forming hurricane was Hurricane Humberto in 2007 . It was a minimal hurricane that formed and intensified faster than any other tropical cyclone on record before landfall . Developing on September 12 , 2007 , in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico , the cyclone rapidly strengthened and struck High Island , Texas , with winds of about 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) early on September 13 . 
 = = Trends = = 
 While the number of storms in the Atlantic has increased since 1995 , there is no obvious global trend . The annual number of tropical cyclones worldwide remains about 87 ± 10 . However , the ability of climatologists to make long @-@ term data analysis in certain basins is limited by the lack of reliable historical data in some basins , primarily in the Southern Hemisphere . In spite of that , there is some evidence that the intensity of hurricanes is increasing . In 2006 , Kerry Emanuel stated , " Records of hurricane activity worldwide show an upswing of both the maximum wind speed in and the duration of hurricanes . The energy released by the average hurricane ( again considering all hurricanes worldwide ) seems to have increased by around 70 % in the past 30 years or so , corresponding to about a 15 % increase in the maximum wind speed and a 60 % increase in storm lifetime . " At the time , Emanuel theorized that increased heat from global warming was driving this trend , however , some argue that Emanuel 's own research in 2008 refuted this theory . Others contend that the trend does not exist at all , but instead is a figment created by faulty readings from primitive 1970s @-@ era measurement equipment . Vecchi and Knutson ( 2008 ) found a weakly positive , although not statistically @-@ significant trend in the number of North Atlantic tropical cyclones for 1878 – 2006 , but also a surprisingly strong decrease in cyclone duration over this period . 
 On May 15 , 2014 , the journal Nature published a peer @-@ reviewed submission from October 2013 by James P. <unk> , Kerry A. Emanuel , and Gabriel A. Vecchi that suggests that a poleward migration exists for the paths of maximum intensity of tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic . The focus of the report is on the latitude at which recent tropical cyclones in the Atlantic are reaching maximum intensity . Their data indicates that during the past thirty years , the peak intensity of these storms has shifted poleward in both hemispheres at a rate of approximately 60 km per decade , amounting to approximately one degree of latitude per decade . 
 Atlantic storms are becoming more destructive financially , since five of the ten most expensive storms in United States history have occurred since 1990 . According to the World Meteorological Organization , “ recent increase in societal impact from tropical cyclones has largely been caused by rising concentrations of population and infrastructure in coastal regions . ” Pielke et al . ( 2008 ) normalized mainland U.S. hurricane damage from 1900 – 2005 to 2005 values and found no remaining trend of increasing absolute damage . The 1970s and 1980s were notable because of the extremely low amounts of damage compared to other decades . The decade 1996 – 2005 has the second most damage among the past 11 decades , with only the decade 1926 – 1935 surpassing its costs . The most damaging single storm is the 1926 Miami hurricane , with $ 157 billion of normalized damage . 
 Often in part because of the threat of hurricanes , many coastal regions had sparse population between major ports until the advent of automobile tourism ; therefore , the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast may have gone unmeasured in some instances . The combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely limit the number of intense hurricanes in the official record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology . Although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes , therefore , experts regard the early data as suspect . Christopher Landsea et al. estimated an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 . These <unk> roughly take into account the typical size of tropical cyclones , the density of shipping tracks over the Atlantic basin , and the amount of populated coastline . 
 The number and strength of Atlantic hurricanes may undergo a 50 – 70 year cycle , also known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation . Nyberg et al. reconstructed Atlantic major hurricane activity back to the early eighteenth century and found five periods averaging 3 – 5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 40 – 60 years , and six other averaging 1 @.@ 5 – 2 @.@ 5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 10 – 20 years . These periods are associated with the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation . Throughout , a decadal oscillation related to solar irradiance was responsible for enhancing / dampening the number of major hurricanes by 1 – 2 per year . 
 Although more uncommon since 1995 , few above @-@ normal hurricane seasons occurred during 1970 – 94 . Destructive hurricanes struck frequently from 1926 – 60 , including many major New England hurricanes . Twenty @-@ one Atlantic tropical storms formed in 1933 , a record only recently exceeded in 2005 , which saw 28 storms . Tropical hurricanes occurred infrequently during the seasons of 1900 – 25 ; however , many intense storms formed during 1870 – 99 . During the 1887 season , 19 tropical storms formed , of which a record 4 occurred after November 1 and 11 strengthened into hurricanes . Few hurricanes occurred in the 1840s to 1860s ; however , many struck in the early 19th century , including an 1821 storm that made a direct hit on New York City . Some historical weather experts say these storms may have been as high as Category 4 in strength . 
 These active hurricane seasons predated satellite coverage of the Atlantic basin . Before the satellite era began in 1960 , tropical storms or hurricanes went undetected unless a reconnaissance aircraft encountered one , a ship reported a voyage through the storm , or a storm hit land in a populated area . The official record , therefore , could miss storms in which no ship experienced gale @-@ force winds , recognized it as a tropical storm ( as opposed to a high @-@ latitude extra @-@ tropical cyclone , a tropical wave , or a brief squall ) , returned to port , and reported the experience . 
 Proxy records based on paleotempestological research have revealed that major hurricane activity along the Gulf of Mexico coast varies on timescales of centuries to millennia . Few major hurricanes struck the Gulf coast during 3000 – 1400 BC and again during the most recent millennium . These quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 BC and 1000 AD , when the Gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3 – 5 times . This millennial @-@ scale variability has been attributed to long @-@ term shifts in the position of the Azores High , which may also be linked to changes in the strength of the North Atlantic Oscillation . 
 According to the Azores High hypothesis , an anti @-@ phase pattern is expected to exist between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast . During the quiescent periods , a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast . During the hyperactive period , more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores High was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean . Such a displacement of the Azores High is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in Haiti around 3200 14C years BP , and a change towards more humid conditions in the Great Plains during the late @-@ Holocene as more moisture was pumped up the Mississippi Valley through the Gulf coast . Preliminary data from the northern Atlantic coast seem to support the Azores High hypothesis . A 3000 @-@ year proxy record from a coastal lake in Cape Cod suggests that hurricane activity increased significantly during the past 500 – 1000 years , just as the Gulf coast was amid a quiescent period of the last millennium . 
 = Griffith Rutherford = 
 Griffith Rutherford ( c . 1721 – August 10 , 1805 ) was an officer in the American Revolutionary War , a political leader in North Carolina , and an important figure in the early history of the Southwest Territory and the state of Tennessee . 
 During the French and Indian War , Rutherford became a captain of a local British colonial militia . He continued serving in the militia until the start of the revolution in 1775 , at which time he enlisted in the North Carolina militia as a colonel . He was appointed to the post of brigadier general of the " Salisbury District " in May 1776 , and participated in the initial phases of the Cherokee – American wars against the Cherokee Indians along the frontier . In June 1780 , he was partly responsible for the Loyalist defeat in the Battle of Ramsour 's Mill . Rutherford was present at the Battle of Camden on August 16 , 1780 , where he was taken prisoner by the British . After being exchanged in 1781 , Rutherford participated in several other campaigns , including further attacks on the Chickamauga faction of the Cherokee . 
 Originally from Ireland , Rutherford immigrated with his parents to Philadelphia , Pennsylvania Colony , at the age of eighteen . In 1753 he moved to Rowan County , in the Province of North Carolina , where he married Elizabeth Graham . An active member of his community , Rutherford served in multiple civil occupations . He was a representative of both houses of the North Carolina House of Commons , as well as an unsuccessful candidate for governor . Rutherford was an advocate of the anti @-@ federalist movement , and was appointed President of the Legislative Council of the Southwest Territory in 1794 . Rutherford retired to Sumner County , Tennessee , where he died on August 10 , 1805 , at the age of 84 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Little is known about Griffith Rutherford 's early life . Born in Ireland in either 1721 or 1731 to John Rutherford , who was of Ulster Scots descent , and Elizabeth ( née Griffin ) , who was of Welsh descent , he appears clearly in records after his immigration to Philadelphia at the age of eighteen . His parents died during the voyage from Ireland , and for a while he worked on a relative 's farm , where he was taught how to survey land . Around 1753 , he moved to Rowan County , North Carolina Colony , and bought a tract of land about seven miles ( 11 km ) from Salisbury ; this was the first of several land purchases he made during the 1750s . The following year Rutherford married his neighbor 's sister , Elizabeth Graham , who eventually bore him ten children . One of their sons , James Rutherford , later became a major during the Revolutionary War , dying at the Battle of Eutaw Springs . Rutherford also became friends with Daniel Boone during this time , with whom he often went on hunting and surveying expeditions . After the French and Indian War , Rutherford became increasingly active in community affairs . He was listed as a member of the North Carolina General Assembly in 1766 , a sheriff and justice of the peace of Rowan County from 1767 to 1769 , and a tax collector . 
 = = French @-@ Indian War = = 
 Rutherford began his extensive military career in 1760 during the French and Indian War . He was a participant in several battles and skirmishes , most notably the Battle of Fort Duquesne ( 1758 ) ; the battle at Fort Dobbs ( 1760 ) ; and James Grant 's campaign against the Cherokee in the southern Appalachians ( 1761 ) . By the war 's end , he had achieved the rank of captain . Between 1769 and 1771 , he embraced the cause against the rebels during the Regulator Movement , commanding a local militia which participated in the Battle of Alamance ( May 16 , 1771 ) . The following month , Rutherford retired to Salem to recover from an acute attack of gout . 
 = = Revolutionary War = = 
 Rutherford entered the war in 1775 as a colonel in the North Carolina militia following his appointment to the Rowan County Committee of Safety . Throughout that year , his regiment helped to disarm and disperse Loyalist groups in the South Carolina back country , most notably during the Snow Campaign in Ninety Six , South Carolina . Rutherford represented Rowan County at the Fourth Provincial Congress in Halifax from April 4 to May 14 , 1776 , during which he helped develop and write the North Carolina Constitution and was promoted to brigadier general of the Salisbury District . In the summer following the conference , he raised an army of 2 @,@ 400 men to campaign against local Cherokee Indians , who had been attacking colonists on the western frontier since their alliance with the British . 
 = = = Campaign against the Cherokee = = = 
 Rutherford 's regiment rendezvoused at Fort <unk> with the Guilford and Surry regiments under Colonels James Martin and Martin Armstrong on July 23 . From there , the three groups traveled through the Blue Ridge Mountains at the Swannanoa Gap , passed up the valley of <unk> Creek , and crossed the Pigeon River . They then passed through Richland Creek , near the present day town of Waynesville , North Carolina , and crossed the Tuckasegee River near an Indian settlement . They moved further onwards towards the <unk> Gap , where they had a small engagement with a band of Cherokee , in which one of Rutherford 's men was wounded . After that conflict , they marched to the Overhill Cherokee " Middle Towns " ( on the Tennessee River ) , where he met General Andrew Williamson of South Carolina on September 14 . Williamson was on a similar mission and readily joined forces with the original three regiments . 
 The now four regiments skirmished with hostile Indians at Valley Town , <unk> , and near the southern Watauga settlements ( present day northeast Tennessee ) . Eventually , the Indian tribes were subdued at the cost of three fatalities to Rutherford 's regiment . Casualties to the Indians , however , were severe . By the end of the conflict , the four regiments had destroyed 36 Indian towns , decimated acres of corn farms , and chased off most of the Indians ' cattle . Afterward , Rutherford returned home by the same route . He arrived back in Salisbury in early October , where he disbanded his troops . Later that month , Rutherford authorized another punitive expedition of a recently raised cavalry force , led by Captain William Moore , to attack the Middle Towns . 
 = = = Southern theater = = = 
 British strategists viewed the Southern colonies , especially lightly populated Georgia , as the most vulnerable of all . Despite early victories won by the Patriots at Charleston and other settlements , the South became the focus of English attack starting in 1778 . Governor Richard Caswell of North Carolina identified this threat and immediately ordered militia to regroup . Rutherford , who had been checking on Loyalists since his return to Salisbury in 1776 , received word of this by October . Governor Caswell and Rutherford met in Kinston , North Carolina , on November 25 to discuss the specifics of Rutherford 's assignment . Apparently a fleet of British ships were en route from New York , heavily endangering key coastal cities . Rutherford was able to amass a force which reached the border of South Carolina by early December . They proceeded to establish headquarters near Savannah in Purrysburg , South Carolina , the following month . 
 With the cities of Savannah and Augusta taken by February , the campaign was severely weakened . Rutherford moved his troops near Augusta , where he supported General John Ashe during the Battle of Brier Creek on March 3 . Soldiers ' enlistments soon began expiring ; by April 10 most of Rutherford 's forces returned to North Carolina . 
 The loss of Charleston in 1780 was a huge blow to the Patriot cause and posed a significant threat to neighboring North Carolina , which lacked adequate defenses due to expiring enlistments . Rutherford saw this danger , calling back his remaining troops stationed in South Carolina and ordering all soldiers from Salisbury to rally near Charlotte , North Carolina . A force of 900 had accumulated by early June . 
 = = = = Battle of Ramsour 's Mill = = = = 
 After rallying troops at Charlotte , Rutherford received information that Loyalists were gathering at arms at Ramsour 's Mill — near present @-@ day <unk> , North Carolina — and issued orders for local officers to disperse the group before they evolved into an even greater threat . After collecting troops from Rowan and Mecklenburg counties , Rutherford moved his men to the Catawba River and crossed it at the Tuckasegee Ford on June 19 . He sent word to Colonel Francis Locke of Rowan County , to rendezvous with him about 16 miles ( 26 km ) from Ramsour 's Mill , near the forks of the Catawba . Locke accumulated a force of 400 men and encamped at Mountain Creek , which was 35 miles ( 56 km ) away from Rutherford 's position , though still approximately the same distance from Ramsour 's Mill as Rutherford 's position was . It was resolved by Locke and his officers that a junction with Rutherford was unrealistic given the distance between the two regiments and the limited amount of time before the Loyalist group grew too large to safely engage . Therefore , it was decided Locke 's forces would attack the Loyalist 's position immediately . Colonel Johnson , one of Locke 's subordinates , informed Rutherford of the new situation by 10 : 00 pm . 
 Locke 's forces left their encampment late in the evening of June 19 ; arriving at the Loyalist position by early morning , June 20 . The Patriots took the Loyalists by surprise . While at first bewildered and confused , the Loyalists retaliated by firing at Locke 's cavalry , who were forced to fall back . The Patriots eventually forced the Loyalists to retreat to their camp , though it was discovered that they were regrouping on the other side of the mill stream . At this point , since an immediate attack from the Loyalists was expected , messages were sent to Rutherford , who had advanced to within six miles ( 9 @.@ 6 km ) of Ramsour 's , to immediately move forward . Rutherford met Locke within 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) of Ramsour 's , where he was informed that the Loyalists were in full retreat .

 The losses at Savannah , Charleston and the Battle of Waxhaws had practically driven the Continental Army from the South , with State defenses reduced to a number of locally @-@ lead partisan militias . In response to the loss of military presence , Congress sent Horatio Gates , who had distinguished himself at Saratoga , to reform the Continental Army in Charlotte , North Carolina . Against the advice of his officers and without knowing the capabilities of his troops — some of which were untested in battle — Gates marched toward South Carolina on July 27 with over 4 @,@ 000 men . He aimed to capturing the crossroads town of Camden , North Carolina , which would have been strategically important for control over the South Carolina backcountry . Lord Rawdon , who was stationed there with 1 @,@ 000 men , alerted Lord Cornwallis of Gates 's movements on August 9 . Cornwallis arrived at Camden by August 13 with reinforcements , increasing the British presence there to over 2 @,@ 000 men . 
 The battle ensued at dawn on August 16 , 1780 . Rutherford was positioned in the center of the Continental formation with other North Carolina militia . During the battle , he was wounded and taken prisoner . He was detained for ten months at Castillo de San Marcos in St. Augustine , Florida , and was later exchanged for another prisoner in 1781 .

 Rutherford returned to Salisbury in September 1781 after his release to find his home ransacked by British troops . After a short reunion with his family , Rutherford trained and took command of 1 @,@ 400 men and allegedly began to brutally attack Tory militias and communities according to several reports sent to his superior , General Greene . Greene disagreed with Rutherford 's tactics , warning Rutherford that these methods would only encourage the Loyalist cause . While these reports were later found to be false , Rutherford decided to redirect his forces towards the British encampment and surrounding militias at Wilmington , North Carolina , beginning with the Loyalist force at Raft Swamp . During October and November , Rutherford continued to force the Loyalists into Wilmington , and eventually surrounded the city , successfully cutting off British communications and supply lines . The commanding British officer , Major Craig , was soon afterward informed of Cornwallis 's surrender at Yorktown , and his forces at Wilmington were hastily evacuated . 
 After Wilmington , Rutherford again fought the Chickamauga in the west in 1782 . He followed the same route he had taken seven years before . No known accounts were written of the campaign , though it was reportedly successful .

 Rutherford was elected to North Carolina 's senate during the War in 1779 and continued to serve in this position until 1789 . He opposed the restoration of Loyalist lands , supporting and assisting in their confiscation while serving in the Council of State . Rutherford ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1783 . He was an ardent anti @-@ federalist during the national debate on the recently created United States Constitution . At a Constitutional Convention held at Hillsborough , North Carolina in 1788 , he had reservations about the Constitution — as did other anti @-@ federalists at the meeting . Rutherford requested if he could challenge some of the clauses . While each clause was challenged individually despite opposition from federalist Samuel Johnston and others , Rutherford rarely contributed to discussion . His final decision to vote against the ratification of the Constitution resulted in him losing his seat in the state senate . However , his reputation with his colleagues was relatively unaffected , and he was subsequently elected Councilor of the State . 
 Rutherford acquired nearly 13 @,@ 000 acres of Washington District land through trading off his 700 acres in Salisbury , government grants and purchasing Continental soldier 's tracts . With his family and eight slaves Rutherford relocated to this area , in what is today Sumner County , Tennessee , in September 1792 . Two years later , he was appointed President of the Legislative Council of the Southwest Territory . 
 Rutherford died in Sumner County , Tennessee , on August 10 , 1805 .

 Atherton ( pop . 20 @,@ 300 ) is a town within the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan , in Greater Manchester , England and historically a part of Lancashire . It is 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) east of Wigan , 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) north of Leigh , and 10 @.@ 7 miles ( 17 @.@ 2 km ) northwest of Manchester . For about 300 years from the 17th century Atherton was referred to as Chowbent , which was frequently shortened to Bent , the town 's old nickname . 
 Along with neighbouring Shakerley , Atherton has been associated with coal mining and nail manufacture since the 14th century , encouraged by its outcrops of coal . At the beginning of the 20th century the town was described as " the centre of a district of collieries , cotton mills and iron @-@ works , which cover the surface of the country with their inartistic buildings and surroundings , and are linked together by the equally unlovely dwellings of the people " . Atherton 's last deep coal mine closed in 1966 , and the last working cotton mills closed in 1999 . Today the town is the third largest retail centre in the Borough of Wigan ; almost 20 % of those employed in the area work in the wholesale and retail trade , although there is still some significant manufacturing industry in the town . 
 Evidence has been discovered of a Roman road passing through the area , on the ancient route between Coccium ( Wigan ) and Mamucium ( Manchester ) . Following the Anglo @-@ Saxon invasion of England , Atherton , which is built on and around seven brooks , became part of the manor of Warrington until the Norman conquest , when it became a township or vill in the ancient parish of Leigh . Since 1974 the town has been part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan , a local government district of the Metropolitan County of Greater Manchester .

 Atherton was recorded as <unk> in 1212 and 1242 , and Atherton in 1259 . Opinions differ as to the derivation of the name . One is the farmstead or village of a man named Aethelhere , an Old English personal name and the suffix tun , meaning an enclosure , farmstead or manor estate ; another is <unk> , Saxon for little brook with the suffix tun . Either is possible as Atherton is bounded by brooks to the west and south , and crossed by several others . The western boundary is Hindsford Brook , originally named <unk> Brook after a Saxon saint . 
 The Chow – also recorded as Chew , <unk> and <unk> – family were tenants of the Athertons living at the valley by Chanters Brook . This part of the township became known as Chow 's Bent but the meaning of Bent has been lost , perhaps a bend or slope . It was referred to in the 14th century as <unk> or <unk> . Chowbent , or Bent , was the name given to the built @-@ up part of Atherton from the mid @-@ 17th century for at least 300 years . As the population grew , the resulting town was called Atherton , although the names Chowbent or Bent are used by locals .

 Evidence of a Roman road and Bronze Age settlement have been found in the area . The Roman road between Manchester and Wigan is shown on the 1849 6 " OS map crossing Miller 's Lane at 90 degrees about halfway down . The site of <unk> Brickworks at the Gibfield Colliery site has been excavated , and evidence of Roman and possibly earlier settlements found . 
 = = = Manor = = = 
 The manor was held by the Atherton family from the de <unk> , whose chief manor was at Warrington . William and Nicholas Atherton fought at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 . The manor house was situated towards the south of the ancient township . Christopher Saxton 's map shows that there was a medieval deer park in the time of Elizabeth I. " Mad " Richard Atherton , the last direct male descendant of the Athertons is remembered for two events ; his expulsion of the congregation from the first Atherton Chapel in 1721 , and building Atherton Hall on a grand scale , to designs by architect William Wakefield . Work on the hall started in 1723 and was not finished until 1743 . The carriage drive from the hall led over Lion 's Bridge down an avenue to gates which faced the parish church in Leigh where the Atherton 's had a chapel . Richard Vernon Atherton was the last of the Atherton male line . He married Elizabeth Farington and had a daughter Elizabeth . 
 The Atherton family 's association with the township ended with Richard Atherton 's death in 1726 . His daughter , Elizabeth , married Robert <unk> and their son , Robert Vernon Atherton , married Henrietta Maria Legh . They had five children , the sons died young , their eldest daughter Henrietta Maria Atherton married Thomas Powys , 2nd Baron Lilford whose father was ennobled by Pitt the Younger in 1797 , taking the title of Baron Lilford . He left his estates to his son , Thomas Atherton Powys . The Atherton estate was inherited by Lord Lilford , who preferred to live at his family seat , Lilford Hall in Northamptonshire . Lord Lilford could not afford the upkeep of another house and Atherton Hall was put up for sale but , after failing to sell , it was demolished in 1824 . Some of the outbuildings were left standing and are private property still known as Atherton Hall . This portion of Atherton was incorporated into Leigh in 1894 and the area became a public park .

 The area was divided in its allegiance during the Civil War , in 1642 men of Chowbent were on their way to Leigh Church when word came that James Stanley , 7th Earl of Derby 's Royalist troops were marching through Leigh probably en route for Manchester . The men of Chowbent armed themselves and drove the Earl 's men back to Lowton Common , killing some , wounding others and taking prisoner about 200 men : " ... we are all upon our guard , and the <unk> of Chowbent , instead of making <unk> , have busied themselves making Bills and Battle Axes . " ( Civil War tracts of Lancashire , Chetham Society Series , vol II ) . 
 In 1715 , during the Jacobite Uprising the supporters of the Old Pretender were marching on Preston . General Charles Wills wrote to Minister Wood of Atherton Chapel asking him to raise a force to be at <unk> Green the following day , 12 November . Minister Wood led a force of Chowbent men who were given the job of guarding the bridge over the River Ribble at Walton @-@ le @-@ Dale and a ford at Penwortham , which they defended successfully . The Highlanders were routed , and for his efforts Parson James Wood was given £ 100 annuity ( equivalent to £ 14 @,@ 100 in 2015 ) by Parliament and the title " The General " by his congregation . 
 = = = Industrial history = = = 
 Atherton , along with neighbouring Shakerley , was associated with coal mining and nail manufacture . Alexander Naylor was taxed on his goods in 1332 , showing the industry was present for at least 600 years . Encouraged by the proximity of outcrops of coal , iron was brought from Derbyshire , Yorkshire and Spain . A variety of nails were made , lath nails , slate nails , thatching nails and <unk> . The nail smithies manufactured ploughs and scythes ; their products were taken by pack horse to be sold in Manchester , Denbigh , Clitheroe and Kendal . The nail industry developed into the manufacture of nuts and bolts . Thomas Blakemore was the first in 1843 and by 1853 there were eight makers of nuts and bolts including James Prestwich and Robert Parker . Some manufacturers of nuts and bolts made spindles and flyers for spinning machinery . Collier Brook Bolt Works on Bag Lane dating from 1856 survives and is a Grade II listed building . 
 Coal had been mined for several hundred years in numerous shallow shafts and adits , but took on greater importance when in 1776 Robert Vernon Atherton leased the coal rights to Thomas Guest from Leigh and John Fletcher from Bolton . In 1845 the era of deep mining arrived with the sinking of Fletcher 's Lover 's Lane pit at Howe Bridge . The Crombouke Day @-@ Eye , a drift mine accessing the shallow <unk> and Crombouke mines , opened in 1870 and closed in 1907 . ( A coal seam was referred to as a " mine " in this part of Lancashire . ) By the early 1870s Fletcher , Burrows and Company 's Howe Bridge Colliery , the biggest of the three Howe Bridge pits , was sunk to the Black & White , or Seven Foot mine . It pit closed in 1959 . Gibfield Colliery , situated alongside the Bolton and Leigh Railway , was working in 1829 , coal was mined from the <unk> mine . Forty years later a 1 @,@ 169 @-@ foot ( 356 m ) shaft was sunk to Arley Mine . The pit closed in 1963 . In September 1913 the first pit head baths in the country were opened at Gibfield . Chanters Colliery was in Hindsford , where 1 @,@ 120 @-@ foot ( 340 m ) shafts were sunk to the <unk> mine in 1854 . In the late 1890s shafts were deepened to 1 @,@ 800 feet ( 550 m ) to reach the Arley mine . Atherton had its share of mining disasters , on 11 February 1850 five men died in a gas explosion caused by a lighted candle at Gibfield and 27 men died at Lovers Lane Colliery after a firedamp explosion caused by blown @-@ out shot on 28 March 1872 . On 6 March 1957 eight men died at Chanters Colliery after an explosion of gas . Chanters closed in 1966 bringing the era of deep coal mining in the town to an end . In 1908 , the Lancashire and Cheshire Coal Owners Association opened Howe Bridge Mines Rescue Station . 
 The cotton mills grew out of a cottage spinning and weaving industry that was widespread across the district . As industrialisation gathered pace , local weavers felt threatened by the advent of powered looms , and in April 1812 a mob smashed the machines and burnt down a new factory , Westhoughton Mill , in neighbouring Westhoughton . For this , the Luddites , three men and a boy of 14 , were tried at Lancaster Assizes and hanged . Fustian was woven and after 1827 silk also was brought from Manchester . In 1938 James Burton had built cotton mills on both sides of the Hindsford Brook including Lodge Mill . Dan Lane Spinning and Doubling Mills were built in the 1840s and lasted until the 1950s . Howe Bridge Spinning Mills , the largest complex in Atherton was started in 1868 and the last mill built in 1919 . It closed as a textile factory in early 1999 . Mills built in the 20th century were Laburnum Mills in 1905 ( closed 1980 ) , and Ena Mill in 1908 which closed in 1999 . The Ena Mill , now converted for other uses , is a Grade II listed building .

 Atherton forms an electoral ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan . The ward elects three councillors to the 75 @-@ member metropolitan borough council , Wigan 's local authority . As of 2009 , two ward councillors of Atherton are Independents and one is a member of the Labour Party . Historically , Atherton formed part of the Hundred of West Derby , a judicial division of southwest Lancashire . Atherton was one of the six townships or vills that made up the ancient parish of Leigh . The townships existed before the parish . The manor of Atherton was held by the Atherton family from the de <unk> , whose chief manor was at Warrington . 
 Under the terms of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 the townships formed part of the Leigh Poor Law Union which was established on 26 January 1837 comprising an area covering the whole of the ancient parish of Leigh and part of Winwick . There were workhouses in existence in Pennington , Culcheth , Tyldesley , Lowton and Hag Fold in Atherton but Leigh Union workhouse at Atherleigh replaced these in the 1850s . In 1863 the Local Government Act 1858 was adopted for the township , meaning it was governed by a local board of health , a type of regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation in the township . In 1894 part of the township was added to Leigh Urban District ; the remainder became Atherton Urban District . The urban district was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 , when the area became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan , a local government district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester . 
 Following a review of parliamentary representation in Greater Manchester , Atherton is part of the Bolton West Parliamentary constituency . It is the only ward in the borough to be represented outside a Wigan borough seat ( the remainder of the borough is represented by Leigh , Makerfield or Wigan ) . Atherton 's MP is Julie <unk> who won the parliamentary seat for Bolton West at the 2010 General Election . Howe Bridge is in the Leigh constituency represented by Andy Burnham .

She co @-@ wrote the song with Benny Benassi , his cousin Alle Benassi ( known together as the Benassi Bros. ) , and songwriter Jenson Vaughan , while the Benassi Bros. co @-@ produced the track with Madonna . Vaughan had worked on the lyrics before sending them to Madonna , who developed the demo into the final version of " Girl Gone Wild " . The song was confirmed by Madonna as the second single from the album and was released on March 2 , 2012 , by Interscope Records . 
 Musically , " Girl Gone Wild " is a mid @-@ tempo electropop party track that is influenced by four @-@ on @-@ the @-@ floor . The song opens with a prayer and features electronic music elements . After the song was released , Joe Francis , the creator of Girls Gone Wild franchise , threatened to sue Madonna for copyright infringement if she sang the song during her performance at Super Bowl XLVI halftime show . Madonna 's representatives stated that she was not aware of either Francis or the lawsuit , and that several songs with the same name had already been released by other artists . 
 The song received mixed reviews from critics , who praised its composition as a return to dance music for Madonna , but criticized its lyrics and believed it failed as album opener on MDNA . " Girl Gone Wild " reached the top @-@ ten of the charts in Hungary , Israel , Italy , Russia , South Africa , South Korea and Spain , along with the Billboard digital charts in Greece .

 In December 2010 , Madonna posted a message on her Facebook page exclaiming that she was on the lookout for " maddest , sickest , most badass people " as collaborators for making new dance music . On July 4 , 2011 , her manager Guy Oseary announced that the singer had entered the studio for recording her then unnamed twelfth studio album . Among the collaborators enlisted for the project was Italian record producer Benny Benassi , who at that time was working on the release of his fourth studio album <unk> . His label Ultra Records ' head Patrick Moxey felt that the producer 's " aggressive " sounds would " work well with some of the major American superstar artists " . Moxey asked for some additional tracks from him , and his longtime production partner and cousin , Alle ( Allessandro ) Benassi . 
 A few demos produced by them were sent to songwriter Jenson Vaughan , who liked the lyrics and the " bass @-@ driven " sound . Vaughan added the top @-@ line on a demo and returned it to Moxey , who shared it with Benassi 's European co @-@ manager Paul Sears , who in @-@ turn shared the demo with Oseary . Upon listening , Madonna was impressed with the demos and requested the Benassi Bros. to come to London for a recording session . Moxey commented that the singer " loved [ the producer ] . Benny is such a quality person ; I think that made it all flow so much easier . " Two tracks from those sessions , " Girl Gone Wild " and " I 'm Addicted " , were included on the final track list of the album , named MDNA . Madonna spoke about her experience of collaborating with the Benassi Bros. : 
 Benny was a tricky one because he doesn 't speak English very well . I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter . It was a little bit frustrating at first but eventually we found a way to communicate . You figure out a way . With music it 's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they ’ re not . When you 're working with someone for the first time , there 's a kind of shyness that everybody has , so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well . 
 A day after Madonna 's halftime show performance on the Super Bowl XLVI , the singer confirmed to Ryan Seacrest that " Girl Gone Wild " would be released as the second single from the album . A lyric video for the song was released on February 27 , 2012 , while it was available for digital download from March 2 , 2012 at the iTunes Store . The cover art for the single was released on February 29 , 2012 . Shot by fashion photographers Mert and Marcus , who had also created the covers for MDNA , the " Girl Gone Wild " artwork showed Madonna wearing lingerie by English retailer Agent Provocateur . She had chosen the brand 's " <unk> " padded bra , made from French corded lace and pleated tulle . Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly praised the artwork saying that the singer " still wears underwear in public better than most women half her age " . Billboard writer Gregory <unk> , Jr. felt that Madonna portrayed having fun in " racy undies " on the cover , in spite of being a mother . " Is this the 21st century version of her infamous cone bra ? Nah , but it made you look [ at her ] , " he concluded . 
 = = Threatened lawsuit = = 
 On February 4 , 2012 , Joe Francis , the creator of the Girls Gone Wild video franchisee , threatened to sue Madonna if she sang the song during her halftime show performance . His representatives said that " [ Madonna ] violated Federal and State trademark laws by making unauthorized use of Mr. Francis ' trademark Girls Gone Wild in not only the title , but subject line of her various advertisements in order to lure potential consumers to purchase her latest musical effort . " The National Football League ( NFL ) revealed in their magazine that the song would not be performed at the Super Bowl . On hearing about the allegations , Moxey commented that Francis only wanted attention from the press , adding : " When I looked at ASCAP , I noticed there were approximately 50 records called ' Girls Gone Wild ' . This guy just thinks too much of himself . " 
 The song title was slightly modified to the singular " Girl Gone Wild " to which Francis again commented : " Clearly her label was trying to avoid legal action surrounding the song ... But [ the new title ] is still infringement as far as the law is concerned , and we have been in touch with Madonna 's people in an effort to resolve this issue . " He added that he would pursue new legal action if more changes were not made to the track . Francis ' lawyer also said that his client had made a federal trademark for the singular form of the title . Oseary denied that the song 's title was changed because of Francis , explaining that Madonna had been completing the final version of MDNA and the renamed title was chosen due to the singular word " girl " in the lyrics . He stated that there are several songs titled " Girls Gone Wild " on iTunes , and that Madonna was not aware of a lawsuit or about Francis . Oseary concluded by saying that the singer was not restricted from performing the song at the Super Bowl , though she did not . 
 = = Recording and composition = = 
 " Girl Gone Wild " was recorded at MSR Studios , New York City and Sarm West Studios , Notting Hill , London . It was written by Madonna , Vaughan and the Benassi Bros. , and was produced by the <unk> and Madonna . Demacio " Demo " Castellon recorded and mixed the track . Philippe Weiss and Graham Archer assisted Castellon on the recording , while Angie Teo assisted on the mixing . Stephen " The Koz " Kozmeniuk did the additional editing of the song and arranged the vocoder . Benny Benassi recalled that Madonna would arrive in the studio around 3 – 4 pm and would work till 11 : 30 pm in the night . Together they fixed the production of the song , including the layering and stacking of the track . They added more vocals to the composition and during the chorus , decided on how many voices should be duplicated . According to Alle Benassi , Madonna " has clear idea . She knows very well what she wants : where put something , how , why . It 's surreal but impressive . " 
 " Girl Gone Wild " is as a mid @-@ tempo party track , drawing influence from four @-@ on @-@ the @-@ floor and has a similar sound to tracks from the singer 's tenth studio album , Confessions on a Dance Floor ( 2005 ) . Kerri Mason of Billboard described it as mostly a dance track with more of electro influence in it rather than house . Jason Lipshutz from the same publication relegated it in the electropop genre , adding that it has a " driving beat " and " propulsive hook " reminiscent of Madonna 's 2005 single , " Hung Up " . The song opens with a prayer , and Madonna uttering " Oh my God , I 'm heartily sorry " , which was a spoken rendition of the last track , " Act of <unk> " , from Madonna 's fourth studio album , Like a Prayer ( 1989 ) . During the middle eight , Madonna talks about how " good girls " should not misbehave . NME contributor Ailbhe Malone noted that the composition featured elements from the singer 's previous singles , " Music " ( 2000 ) and " Jump " ( 2006 ) . As she sings " forgive me " , the beat drops completely with the music disintegrating . Madonna 's vocals are processed to appear thin and stretched out . 
 According to the sheet music of the song published online by Sony / ATV Music Publishing , " Girl Gone Wild " is set in the time signature of common time , with a moderate tempo of 127 beats per minute . It is composed in the key of A minor with Madonna 's vocals ranging from Gm to Dm . The song follows a sequence of G ♯ m – C ♯ m – E during the opening prayer verse and Am – Em – G – F for the rest as its chord progression . Mike Senior from Sound on Sound magazine found that along with the predominant synth sounds , there was " a lot " of double tracking present in the song which made the vocals unclear . He felt that this was not pose a problem in stereo sound , but with mono sounds the combined vocals appeared double tracked while the vocal level decreased . The mixing for " Girl Gone Wild " was done mainly for stereo speakers and around the 1 : 45 – 2 : 00 mark , the vocal levels fluctuate with the backing music being dwarfed . Senior also observed that Madonna put the stresses of the words on the beats of the song , hence some of the enunciation are lost with the drum sounds , especially on the title hook . 
 Lyrically , the song addresses a " good girl gone wild " singing about her " burning hot desire " to have some fun . It contains references to singer Cyndi Lauper 's " Girls Just Want to Have Fun " ( 1983 ) , with lyrics like " Girls , they just wanna have some fun " and " The room is spinning / It must be the Tanqueray / I 'm about to go astray / My inhibitions gone away " . In the intermediate verses , Madonna utters " forgive me " , which is a Catholic term used as a sexual reference . The lyrics , once placed in the context of Madonna 's career " attains a new meaning " according to Josh Haigh from Attitude magazine . Explaining it , he said that the meaning behind the lyrics was how Madonna , being a Catholic girl herself , decided that she would not be tied down by anyone else 's rules , and consequently became one of the most recognizable musical artists .

 The song has received mixed reviews from music critics . Keith Caulfied of Billboard deemed it as a " very dance @-@ by @-@ the @-@ numbers with Madonna " song , and further assessed that the chorus made " Girl Gone Wild " a memorable song . Robbie Daw from Idolator said that " Madge [ is ] doing what she does best : turning up the heat on the dance floor , " but that " the song is packed with tried @-@ but @-@ true sexual pop cliches . " Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone rated it three out of five stars . He commended the singer for the electro and Europop composition of the track , describing it as " buoyant and warm @-@ rinse soothing . It 's the sound of a woman who hits the dance @-@ floor for restoration more than craziness . " Haigh from Attitude believed that " Girl Gone Wild " should have been released as the lead single from MDNA . He felt that the track " screams " early 1990s Madonna 's work , and complimented it for being a " basic , balls @-@ to @-@ the @-@ wall night out anthem " , adding " why does that have to be something that 's considered ' below ' Madonna ? " In a pre @-@ release screening of MDNA , Matthew Todd from the same magazine praised the " pop stomper " track , writing : " The production might sound like she 's been listening to a fair bit of Rihanna , but who 's counting . Madonna brings her own authority , creating the kind of anthemic party song that she does best , the kind where everyone from your three @-@ year @-@ old niece to your 60 @-@ year @-@ old mother gets up on the dancefloor . " MTV News journalist Bradley Stern felt that the composition emulated her single " Celebration " ( 2009 ) . 
 A writer for Virgin Media gave the song four out of five stars , writing : " It sounds a tad familiar , not to mention inappropriate in a track named after a US porn @-@ movie series , but Benny Benassi then lifts ' Girl Gone Wild ' into a fantastic throbbing Kelis @-@ style dancefloor @-@ filler . " Nick Levine , writing for The National , praised the composition saying that it " gets better the more ( and louder ) you play it " . Michael Cragg from The Guardian felt that the song was " more interesting musically " , especially during the middle eight . " A signal we 're back in Confessions on a Dance Floor territory following the relative misstep of Hard Candy , " Cragg concluded . Laurence Green from musicOMH believed that with its nod to Confessions on a Dance Floor and " Get Together " , the song was commercial enough to represent the current sound . In a review of MDNA , Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph praised the track calling it a " lean , sleek , electro stomper , balancing the twin requirements of radio friendly hooks and dance floor drive " . Aidin Vaziri of the San Francisco Chronicle called it " insistent and sleek " but hoped that Madonna would have found different lyrical references than Lauper 's song . Matthew Parpetua from Pitchfork Media praised the <unk> ' production , adding that it was worthy of " competing with singers like Kesha , Britney Spears , and Katy Perry on pop radio " . Senior from Sound on Sound was pleased with the synth sounds and the departure from the " brightness " of Confessions on a Dance Floor tracks , making it more " <unk> " . 
 Slant Magazine 's Eric Henderson wrote that " Girl Gone Wild " sounds like a " Tumblr @-@ meme version " of the singer 's 2006 single , " Get Together " . He added that the release " may not be the nadir of Madonna 's career so far , but I can think of few moments that feel as much a betrayal of her legacy than the way she <unk> ' It 's so erotic ' right before chirping ' This feeling can 't be beat ' . " Robert Copsey of Digital Spy felt the production credits for MDNA had fueled " over @-@ inflated expectations " for the single . Copsey found it was not " forward @-@ thinking " like Madonna 's past records and cited the lyrics " Girls they just wanna have some fun / Get fired up like a smoking gun " as an example of this , although he concluded his review writing " we defy anyone who isn 't singing this back to themselves immediately after . " The New York Observer journalist Daniel D 'Addario compared it to " Music " , but added that " Madonna was twelve years younger at that time and thus perhaps a more convincing ' bad girl ' , so too was our culture ... maybe it 's time for her to try something totally different ? " In another article for The Guardian , Gareth Grundy proclaimed " Girl Gone Wild " to be a " clumsy rave @-@ pop " , while Amanda Dobbins from New York panned it as a " paint @-@ by @-@ numbers , <unk> and Tanqueray @-@ referencing dance track that falls even flatter when compared to its source material " . Malone from NME found no innovation in the track , writing , " combined with earlier single ' Give Me All Your Luvin ' it points to an uneasy mix for album MDNA . " Margaret Wappler from Los Angeles Times felt that Madonna would have been better re @-@ releasing " Music " again as a single , instead of " Girl Gone Wild " . She added that " There 's something very attractive about a song this militaristic and precise , but in Madge 's too @-@ capable hands it 's also <unk> professional . " 
 Brad O 'Mancey from Popjustice believed that the song failed as an " album opener " , but sounds " slightly better " after one finished the whole record . Chicago Tribune journalist Greg Kot believed that unlike Madonna 's 80s Catholic imagery , " Girl Gone Wild " does not venture into new territory with its sound . Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald found the song " laughable " , calling it a " yawning Catholic @-@ girl @-@ in @-@ heat " . In another review of the album for BBC News , Levine called it " charmless <unk> @-@ banger " . Alex Macpherson from Fact panned the track , saying that the " rote , lifeless singing on [ ' Girl Gone Wild ' ] sounds as though a guide track was mistakenly kept on the finished song , and arguably marks the worst vocal performance Madonna has ever committed to record . " Robert Leedham from Drowned in Sound website felt that the song did not represent the album 's sound , hence failed as a single to promote it . Jon Pareles from The New York Times called it " shallow , effective club fodder " , describing it as containing " blippy stereo @-@ hopping synthesizers and generic title " . This view was shared by Emily Mackay of The Quietus , who felt that the song would have been better off for other artist and was below Madonna 's level .

 During her interview with Ryan Seacrest , Madonna confirmed that a music video for " Girl Gone Wild " would be filmed during the week of February 17 , 2012 . Oseary confirmed through Twitter that Mert and Marcus were enlisted as the video directors . The singer also recruited Ukrainian dance group Kazaky to appear with her in the video . Madonna was inspired by the androgynous portrayal of the group , since they danced in high @-@ heels but appeared masculine in their appearance with muscular bodies . According to Mark Johansen from International Business Times , the group achieved popularity in 2010 for their " techno beats , tiny outfits , sky @-@ high stilettos " and " highly stylized videos " . Tabitha , the choreographer of the video , recalled that since Madonna was a professional dancer , she added elements of her own characteristic routines in the choreography . " Madonna is a mover , so there were definitely moments that wasn 't choreographed and was her being raw , " Tabitha added . 
 Madonna also enlisted male models Brad Alphonso , Jon Kortajarena , Rob Evans , Sean O <unk> and Simon <unk> . In the video , Madonna sported a brassiere designed by Agent Provocateur . The singer 's stilettos , which were custom @-@ made by footwear designer Paola Bay , consisted of black silk embroidered with silver threading . " She wanted them as high as possible and to be able to dance with them on , " stated Bay . " We did three fittings to make sure they were like second skin . " Arianne Phillips , dress designer for the video , recalled that she had to create custom @-@ made high @-@ heeled stilettos for Kazaky , because of unavailability of shoes in their size . Artur Gaspar from the band recalled that " By the end of the day on set , our feet were bleeding and we had blisters ... But if Madonna can repeat the dancing for the 50th time , why can 't we ? " Phillips explained that they had created three different looks for Madonna in the video . The first was called a " super vixen " look for which she created short tops that could be worn as brassiere . Hairstylist Andy Lecompte wanted to go for a 1960s style with it . The second look portrayed was called " rockstar " for which designer Michael Smith created t @-@ shirts out of metal mesh , while Lecompte cut the singer 's hair short , so that it would resemble her early look . The final look was called the " platinum bombshell " , and was inspired by Marilyn Monroe .

 A 30 second teaser video was released on March 9 , 2012 . The full video debuted on E ! News on March 20 , 2012 , and became available on their website shortly afterwards . Shot completely in black @-@ and @-@ white , the music video is polar opposite to the colorful , football @-@ themed video for previous single " Give Me All Your Luvin ' " . Instead of having a plot , the video is an assortment of imagery referring to the singer 's early works . 
 The video opens with Madonna in the " platinum bombshell " look uttering the opening prayers of the song . As the music starts she is shown in the other looks , performing yoga poses , while intercepting scenes show the male models in provocative poses . Other scenes show Madonna dancing against a wall , smoking a cigarette , and being bound to a chain . Kazaky appears during the first chorus and perform a dance routine in the heels . While Madonna sings the second verse , she is surrounded by the male models , who are almost nude . The singer joins Kazaky during the chorus emulating the choreography with them . Interspersed are scenes of Madonna playing with a fog machine billowing smoke . 
 During the intermediate break , one of the male models is shown nude and wearing a crown of thorns on his head , while Madonna gets caressed by the others . The final sequence of the video shows the singer dancing energetically with Kazaky , with the fog machine and the male models who grind against each other . " Girl Gone Wild " ends with Madonna dropping the fog machine and a final scene showing the singer 's face with black colored tears pouring from her eyes .

 John Mitchell from MTV News observed five main influences from Madonna 's past behind the video . He explained that references from the singer 's music video for the 1992 song " Erotica " are present with Madonna 's " platinum bombshell " look as well as scenes of leather @-@ underwear wearing men and S & M. The choreography had direct references to the " Vogue " ( 1990 ) music video , and the gay eroticism was also displayed in both of them . For Mitchell , the video for " Human Nature " ( 1995 ) is referenced with Madonna 's latex clothing and portions showing the singer against a white background . The " Justify My Love " ( 1990 ) video had scenes of orgy in it , similar to the scenes of Madonna being caressed by her dancers in " Girl Gone Wild " , towards the end . Mitchell concluded by saying that the crown of thorns directly referenced the religious iconography in the singer 's " Like a Prayer " ( 1989 ) video . 
 In another article , Jocelyn Vena from MTV News thought that the video was " the perfect homage " to the singer 's Sex book and her Erotica ( 1992 ) days , describing it as " crunchy , sexy and edgy " . Idolator 's X. Alexander compared the concept of the video , along with its scenes of homoeroticism , to her 1990 music videos for " Vogue " and " Justify My Love " . Sophie A. Schillaci of The Hollywood Reporter noted references to the music video for " Like a Prayer " ( 1989 ) . E ! contributor Nathalie Finn commented : " Madonna doesn 't need a song to tell us she 's ready to dance all night — just one look at her and you figure she could outlast the average <unk> under any circumstances " . She added that the references to her old work , as well as the half @-@ nude men indicated that " it isn 't just the girls ' who wanna have some fun ' . " 
 Ethan Sack from New York Daily News said that " it 's a <unk> over who looks better in tights and high @-@ heels , the 53 @-@ year @-@ old Material Girl or the bevy of shirtless male dancers who gyrate around her . " Lanford Beard of Entertainment Weekly praised the video saying that it " shows Madonna looking the best she has since at least 2005 's video for ' Hung Up ' . Of course there is the requisite writhing , hip grinding , a rousing dance sequence , and a smoldering <unk> . It is , in a word , awesome " . HitFix 's Melinda Newman praised the direction by Mert and Marcus , feeling that " the clip is a luscious collection of erotic images : two men biting an apple together , backlit men dancing in high heels , and Madge , looking as if she ’ s a dewy 25 @-@ year old . " A review in The Week praised the video for being self @-@ referential with its " dark , dominatrix @-@ y " visuals . Amanda Dobbins from New York magazine gave a positive review for the appearance of Kazaky and Madonna 's look in the video . Caryn Ganz from Spin noticed that along with her old videos , Madonna also referenced her contemporary releases , like the videos for " Give It 2 Me " ( 2008 ) and " Celebration " , with the scenes showing her " incredible " dancing alone . 
 The video was chosen by fans , in a Billboard poll for Madonna 's best videos , as her sixth best effort of all time , in honor of her 54th birthday . At the 2013 International Dance Music Awards , the video was nominated in the categories of Best Dance Music Video and Best Pop Music Video , but failed to win either of them . Shortly after " Girl Gone Wild " ' s release to YouTube on March 21 , 2012 , the video was rated by many viewers as inappropriate . This caused YouTube to set an age restriction , only allowing those of age 18 or older to view the video . According to the website , the video was labeled explicit because of the " raunchy " and " orgy " scenes , thereby blocking it from getting uploaded to the singer 's Vevo account . YouTube also asked Madonna 's representative to upload a more PG @-@ rated version . Madonna later commented , " What 's wrong with ... what grinding ? I 'm supposed to be a ' girl gone wild ' in the video — how can I go wild and not grind ? This is the question that people should be asking . " During her interview with Jimmy Fallon on Facebook , Madonna jokingly confessed that if she were president , " There would be no restrictions whatsoever on any of my videos , ever " . Jane Martinson of The Guardian expressed her disappointment with the ban , since she felt there were far more provocative content in YouTube than Madonna 's video . Martinson also noted that the semi @-@ nudity in question came from the men featured in the clip , and felt that Madonna had turned Francis ' concept of girls going wild , to " [ girls who ] can also be the ones in control . I watched the video ready to slate her and came away thinking , after 30 years Madonna can still show Rihanna how sex and music can subvert expectations . " 
 = = Live performance = = 
 Madonna 's first performance of " Girl Gone Wild " was on The MDNA Tour ( 2012 ) as the concert 's opening track . The performance was choreographed by Jason Young and Alison Faulk , along with dancer Derrell Bullock , who assisted as supervisor . According to Faulk , Madonna asked Bullock to experiment with the concept of " girl gone wild " , and come up with a routine and style of his own . He wanted to find a story with the dancing and presented his moves to Madonna the next day . The singer also wanted to experiment with the concept of Catholic church , along with monks and gargoyles . Her message behind it was that of freedom , " people getting to do whatever they wanted to " . Four dancers from Brooklyn , adept at bone breaking dance , were enlisted as backup crew for the performance . Young recalled that they could " create these abstract , very animalistic shapes . What they can do with their arms is unbelievable . Anything that most people can do in front of their bodies , they do it behind their bodies . " The dancing required the boys to put on heels like Kazaky in the music video . Most of them refused to abide by it , resulting in Madonna giving them a choice to put the heels and dance or leave the show . The dancers complied and learned the choreography . 
 The show began with a gothic cathedral setting , which was developed by Tait Towers , a production management company . They used <unk> <unk> video screens with an integrated active cooling system designed to dissipate captured heat from LED tiles . The main screens could move up and down , thus creating a moving cathedral setting and steps . Onstage several dancers wearing <unk> and Christian monks ' robes swung a giant <unk> back and forth , as it burnt incense and appeared to cleanse the venue . The Kalakan Trio then appeared dressed in religious robes with huge head dresses , chanting excerpts from " <unk> Dodi " , as the backdrop screens showed a huge cross with the letters MDNA . The religious chants eventually morph into chants of Madonna 's name , as the two main backdrop screens split open to reveal a giant confessional , covered by a scrim at the front . Madonna was present inside kneeling down and praying , while the confessional was lowered to the stage with the song 's opening monologue in the background . The singer was decked in a gold crown with a black veil , a tight black shirt with a leopard @-@ printed bra peeking out from the top , leather arm bands and black skinny jeans and black high @-@ heel boots . Madonna pretended to smash and break through the glass window of the confessional with a large rifle and proceeded to perform the song accompanied by a troupe of shirtless dancers wearing high heels , doing a choreography similar to the song 's music video . The song was arranged to include musical elements of " Material Girl " ( 1985 ) and " Give It 2 Me " ( 2008 ) . Moving blocks and contortionist dancers dressed up as gargoyles were also present in the performance . " Girl Gone Wild " ended with Madonna grabbing another rifle and pretending to shoot at the crowd , giving way to the second performance of the show , " Revolver " . The performance of the song at the November 19 – 20 , 2012 shows in Miami , at the American Airlines Arena , were recorded and released in Madonna 's fourth live album , MDNA World Tour . 
 Shawn Kellner from the Chicago Music Magazine praised the costumes and the dancing , while Jodi Duckett from The Morning Call felt that the " characters that looked like Tibetan monks [ ... ] , the <unk> of bells and Madonna arriving in a gilded cage " made the performance seem " very ' Da Vinci Code ' like " . Kitty Empire from The Guardian received the usage of guns negatively , saying that Madonna 's son Rocco would be " perfectly blasé about the prospect of the former Mrs. Ritchie shooting her way out of a confessional booth with a machine gun , as she does on the set opener " . Barry Walters from MuuMuse called the opening sequence as " manic " and called it a " power punch " sequence along with " Revolver " . Barbara <unk> from The Arizona Republic called the performance as " raucous " . Shirley Halperin from The Hollywood Reporter was confused as how the religious iconography portrayed during the performance was tied to the song 's theme of a " girl gone wild " . San Jose Mercury News editor Jim Harrington called the selection of " Girl Gone Wild " as " commonplace " . Jim Farber from New York Daily News described the performance as transitioning from a girl gone wild to " girl gone bloodthirsty " with the subsequent violence depictions . Ben Crandell from Florida 's Sun @-@ Sentinel newspaper observed that Madonna turned around the " solemn " introduction to a dance number with " Girl Gone Wild " . According to her the performance portrayed Madonna as " fashionable , powerful , but vulnerable sex toy " , which became " an ongoing theme for the night " .

 On December 17 , 1999 , during the premiere of the music video for " From the Bottom of My Broken Heart " on Total Request Live , Spears called the show to announce March US tour dates . The tour was designed as a continuation of the ... Baby One More Time Tour and a prelude to her future world tour . The leg 's main sponsor was Got Milk ? .

 The show opened with a skit in which the dancers came out of lockers and stayed in the stage until a bell rang . They all sat until a female teacher voice started calling their names . After the teacher called Spears , she emerged at the top of the staircase in a cloud of smoke , wearing a top and white stretch pants , to perform a short dance mix of " ... Baby One More Time " . She then entered one of the lockers and appeared in another one on the opposite side of the stage to perform " ( You Drive Me ) Crazy " . Spears briefly talked to the audience , the segment continued with performances of " Born to Make You Happy " and " I Will Be There " . After a dance interlude , Spears appeared onstage sitting on the magic carpet and flew over the audience while singing " Don 't Let Me Be the Last to Know " . When she returned to the stage , she performed another song from her upcoming album , " Oops ! ... I Did It Again " . Spears addressed the audience again before the " Who is the Ultimate Heartbreaker ? " interlude , in which her dancers picked a boy from the audience and invited him onstage . Spears took to the stage again wearing a jacket and dedicated the performance of " From the Bottom of My Broken Heart " to the boy .

 Jae @-@ Ha Kim of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times said that Spears " showed why she has got a leg up on blonder competitors such as Christina Aguilera , Jessica Simpson and Mandy Moore . Aguilera may have a better voice ( and a Grammy to validate it ) , but Spears has that ' it ' factor that worked for pinup queens of the past , such as Farrah Fawcett " . Adam Graham of Central Michigan Life commented that " although the show was only about 10 songs long and the authenticity of her voice was in question throughout , it was really truly hard to walk away feeling anything but completely gratified " . Dave Tianen of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel believed that the show " was energetic , good @-@ humored , fast @-@ paced and bright " . 
 During the tour , accusations of lip synching arose . Spears talked to Rolling Stone about the accusations , saying , 
 " There 's a delay in the screen above me , so if you listen to the music and watch the screen , they don 't sync up . I think that confuses people . But I 'm singing every song . I 'm singing my ass off . [ ... ] There are times during the show , when I 'm dancing so much , where I get out of breath , and we have a signal where I 'm dying and they 'll help me out . Believe me , I 'd give anything to do a show where I just sit there and sing " .

 Barbarian : The Ultimate Warrior is a video game first released for Commodore 64 personal computers in 1987 ; the title was developed and published by Palace Software , and ported to other computers in the following months . The developers licensed the game to Epyx , who published it as Death Sword in the United States . Barbarian is a fighting game that gives players control over sword @-@ wielding barbarians . In the game 's two @-@ player mode , players pit their characters against each other . Barbarian also has a single @-@ player mode , in which the player 's barbarian braves a series of challenges set by an evil wizard to rescue a princess . 
 Instead of using painted artwork for the game 's box , Palace Software used photos of hired models . The photos , also used in advertising campaigns , featured Michael Van Wijk ( who would later become famous as ' Wolf ' in the TV series Gladiators ) as the hero and bikini @-@ clad Maria Whittaker , a model who was then associated with The Sun tabloid 's Page Three topless photo shoots . Palace Software 's marketing strategy provoked controversy in the United Kingdom , with protests focused on the sexual aspects of the packaging rather than decapitations and other violence within the game . The ensuing controversy boosted Barbarian 's profile , helping to make it a commercial success . Game critics were impressed with its fast and furious combat , and dashes of humour . The game was Palace Software 's critical hit ; boosted by Barbarian 's success , Palace Software expanded its operations and started publishing other developers ' work . In 1988 , the company released a sequel , Barbarian II : The Dungeon of Drax . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Barbarian : The Ultimate Warrior is a fighting game that supports one or two players . Players assume the roles of sword @-@ wielding barbarians , who battle in locales such as a forest glade and a " fighting pit " . The game 's head @-@ to @-@ head mode lets a player fight against another or the computer in time @-@ limited matches . The game also features a single @-@ player story mode , which comprises a series of plot @-@ connected challenges . 
 Using joysticks or the keyboard , players move their characters around the arena , jumping to dodge low blows and rolling to dodge or trip the opponent . By holding down the fire button and moving the controller , players direct the barbarians to kick , headbutt , or attack with their swords . Each barbarian has 12 life points , which are represented as 6 circles in the top corners of the interface . A successful attack on a barbarian takes away one of his life points ( half a circle ) . The character dies when his life points are reduced to zero . Alternatively , a well @-@ timed blow to the neck decapitates the barbarian , killing him instantly , upon which a goblin enters the arena , kicks the head , and drags the body away . 
 If the players do not input any commands for a time , the game attempts a self @-@ referencing action to draw their attentions : the barbarians turn to face the players , shrug their shoulders , and say " C 'mon " . The game awards points for successful attacks ; the more complex the move , the higher the score awarded . A score board displays the highest points achieved for the game . 
 = = = Single @-@ player story mode = = = 
 In the single @-@ player story mode , the player controls a nameless barbarian who is on a quest to defeat the evil wizard Drax . Princess Mariana has been kidnapped by Drax , who is protected by 8 barbarian warriors . The protagonist engages each of the other barbarians in single combat to the death . Overcoming them , he faces the wizard . After the barbarian has killed Drax , Mariana drops herself at her saviour 's feet and the screen fades to black . The United States version of the game names the protagonist <unk> . 
 = = Development = = 
 In 1985 , Palace Software hired Steve Brown as a game designer and artist . He thought up the concept of pitting a broom @-@ flying witch against a monster pumpkin , and created Cauldron and Cauldron II : The Pumpkin Strikes Back . The two games were commercial successes and Brown was given free rein for his third work . He was inspired by Frank Frazetta 's fantasy paintings to create a sword fighting game that was " brutal and as realistic as possible " . 
 Brown based the game and its characters on the Conan the Barbarian series , having read all of Robert E Howard 's stories of the eponymous warrior . He conceptualised 16 moves and practiced them with wooden swords , filming his sessions as references for the game 's animation . One move , the Web of Death , was copied from the 1984 sword and sorcery film Conan the Destroyer . Spinning the sword like a propeller , Brown " nearly took [ his ] eye out " when he practiced the move . Playing back the videos , the team traced each frame of action onto clear plastic sheets laid over the television screen . The tracings were transferred on a grid that helped the team map the swordplay images , pixel by pixel , to a digital form . Brown refused to follow the convention of using small sprites to represent the fighters in the game , forcing the coders to conceive a method to animate larger blocks of graphics : Palace Software 's co @-@ founder Richard Leinfellner said they " multiplexed the sprites and had different look @-@ up tables for different frames . " 
 Feeling that most of the artwork on game boxes at that time were " pretty poor " , Brown suggested that an " iconic fantasy imagery with real people would be a great hook for the publicity campaign . " His superiors agreed and arranged a photo shoot , hiring models Michael Van Wijk and Maria Whittaker to pose as the barbarian and princess . Whittaker was a topless model , who frequently appeared on Page 3 of the tabloid , The Sun . She wore a tiny bikini for the shoot while Van Wijk , wearing only a loincloth , posed with a sword . Palace Software also packaged a poster of Whittaker in costume with the game . Just before release , the company discovered that fellow developer Psygnosis was producing a game also titled Barbarian , albeit of the platform genre . After several discussions , Palace Software appended the subtitle " The Ultimate Warrior " to differentiate the two products . 
 The sounds of the characters are taken from the 1985 film Red Sonja . Most notably the " <unk> @-@ <unk> ! " sound that plays when the player attempts to decapitate an opponent . This particular sound can be found near the beginning of the movie when Arnold 's character is ambushed after pulling an arrow out of the lady 's back .

 Barbarian was released in 1989 for the Commodore 64 and in the months that followed , most other home computers . These machines were varied in their capabilities , and the software ported to them was modified accordingly . The version for the 8 @-@ bit ZX Spectrums is mostly monochromatic , displaying the outlines of the barbarians against single @-@ colour backgrounds . The sounds are recorded at a lower sampling rate . Conversely , the version for the Atari ST , which has 16- and 32 @-@ bit buses , presents a greater variety of backgrounds and slightly higher quality graphics than the original version . Its story mode also pits 10 barbarians against the player instead of the usual 8 . <unk> sound samples are used in the Atari ST and 32 @-@ bit Amiga versions ; the latter also features digitised speech . Each fight begins with the announcement of " Prepare to die ! " , and metallic sounding thuds and <unk> ring out as swords clash against each other . 
 After the initial releases , Barbarian was re @-@ released several times ; budget label <unk> published these versions without Whittaker on the covers . Across the Atlantic , video game publisher Epyx acquired the license to Barbarian and released it under the title Death Sword as part of their " Maxx Out ! " video game series . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 During the 1980s , the prevalent attitude was that video games were for children . Barbarian 's advertisements , showing a scantily dressed model known for topless poses , triggered significant outcries of moral indignity . Electron User magazine received letters from readers and religious bodies , who called the image " offensive and particularly insulting to women " and an " ugly pornographic advertisement " . Chris Jager , a writer for PC World , considered the cover " a trashy controversy @-@ magnet featuring a glamour @-@ <unk> " and a " big bloke [ in leotard ] " . According to Leinfellner , the controversy did not negatively affect Barbarian , but boosted the game 's sales and profile tremendously . Video game industry observers Russell DeMaria and Johnny Wilson commented that the United Kingdom public were more concerned over scantily clad Whittaker than the gory contents in the game . Conversely , Barbarian was banned in Germany by the <unk> für <unk> Medien for its violent contents . The ban forbade promotion of the game and its sale to customers under the age of 18 . A censored version of the game , which changed the colour of the blood to green , was later permitted to be freely sold in the country . Barbarian 's mix of sex and violence was such that David Houghton , writer for GamesRadar , said the game would be rated " Mature " by the Entertainment Software Rating Board if it was published in 2009 . 
 Reviewers were impressed with Barbarian 's gory gameplay . Zzap ! 64 's Steve Jarratt appreciated the " fast and furious " action and his colleague Ciaran Brennan said Barbarian should have been the licensed video game to the fantasy action film Highlander ( which had a lot of sword fights and decapitations ) instead . Amiga Computing 's Brian Chappell enjoyed " hacking the foe to bits , especially when a well aimed blow decapitates him . " Several other reviewers express the same satisfaction in <unk> the heads off their foes . Although shocked at the game 's violence , Antic 's reviewer said the " sword fight game is the best available on the ST . " According to Jarratt , Barbarian represented " new heights in <unk> " . Equally pleasing to the reviewers at Zzap ! 64 and Amiga User International 's Tony Horgan was the simplicity of the game ; they observed that almost anyone could quickly familiarise themselves with the game mechanics , making the two @-@ player mode a fun and quick pastime . 
 Although the barbarian characters use the same basic blocky sprites , they impressed reviewers at Zzap ! 64 and Amiga Computing with their smooth animation and lifelike movements . Reviewers of the Amiga version , however , expressed disappointment with the port for failing to exploit the computer 's greater graphics capability and implement more detailed character sprites . Its digitised sounds , however , won praise from Commodore User 's Gary Penn . Advanced Computer Entertainment 's reviewers had similar thoughts over the Atari ST port . 
 Reviewing for Computer and Video Games , Paul Boughton was impressed by the game 's detailed gory effects , such as the aftermath of a decapitation , calling them " hypnotically gruesome " . It was these little touches that " [ makes ] the game worthwhile " , according to Richard Eddy in Crash . Watching " the head [ fall ] to the ground [ as blood spurts from the ] severed neck , accompanied by a scream and satisfying thud as the torso tumbles " proved to be " wholesome stuff " for Chappell , and the scene was a " great retro gaming moment " for Retro Gamer 's staff . The cackling goblin , which drags off the bodies , endeared him to some reviewers ; the team at Retro Gamer regretted that the creature did not have his own game . The actions of the barbarian also impressed them to nominate him as one of their top 50 characters from the early three decades of video gaming . 
 Barbarian proved to be a big hit , and Palace started planning to publish a line of sequels ; Leinfellner said he received royalty cheques for approximately seven years , the first of which was for £ 20 @,@ 000 . Barbarian II : The Dungeon of Drax was released in 1988 , and Barbarian III was in the works . Van Wijk and Whittaker were hired again to grace the box cover and advertisements . After the success with Barbarian , Palace Software began to expand its portfolio by publishing games that were created by other developers . Barbarian , however , remained its most popular game , best remembered for its violent sword fights and Maria Whittaker . 
 In 2011 , <unk> Interactive ( French publisher ) launched a remake of the game , adapted to mobile devices and computers : Barbarian - The Death Sword . 
 In 2012 , the Italian guitarist Marco <unk> included a cover of the main theme on his album <unk> . 
 = Oliver Bosbyshell = 
 Oliver Christian Bosbyshell ( January 3 , 1839 – August 1 , 1921 ) was Superintendent of the United States Mint at Philadelphia from 1889 to 1894 . He also claimed to have been the first Union soldier wounded by enemy action in the Civil War , stating that he received a bruise on the forehead from an object thrown by a Confederate sympathizer while his unit was marching through Baltimore in April 1861 . 
 Bosbyshell was born in Mississippi . His parents were of old Philadelphia stock , and he was raised in Schuylkill County , Pennsylvania . After briefly working on the railroad and then studying law , Bosbyshell enlisted in the Union cause on the outbreak of war . Following a brief period of service in the 25th Pennsylvania Volunteer Regiment , he joined the 48th Pennsylvania , remaining in that regiment for three years . He saw action in such battles as Second Bull Run and Antietam . He rose to the rank of major and led his regiment , but was mustered out upon the expiration of his term of service in October 1864 , having been refused a leave of absence . 
 After leaving the army , Bosbyshell returned to Pennsylvania and worked in two unsuccessful businesses ; he also involved himself in Republican politics and in the activities of the Grand Army of the Republic , a veterans ' group . He was appointed to a post at the Philadelphia Mint in 1869 , and became chief coiner in 1876 and superintendent in 1889 , serving for four years . One of Bosbyshell 's underlings at the mint stole gold bars and , as they were not all recovered when the culprit was arrested , Bosbyshell was held responsible for the loss by virtue of his office . He was absolved of this liability by act of Congress in 1899 . In his later years , he was an officer of an insurance company ; he died in 1921 . 
 = = Early life and Civil War = = 
 Oliver Christian Bosbyshell was born in Vicksburg , Mississippi , on January 3 , 1839 , the son of Oliver Christian and Mary Ann ( Whitney ) Bosbyshell . Both his parents were from old Philadelphia families ; the couple had taken up temporary residence in Vicksburg . The senior Oliver Bosbyshell was engaged in the commission business . He contracted bronchitis while fighting a fire that destroyed his warehouse , and died in Philadelphia after a sea voyage taken in the hope of recovering his health . Eight weeks later , his son was born , and Mary Bosbyshell returned from Mississippi with him to her father 's house in Schuylkill County , Pennsylvania . Young Oliver grew up there , and attended local public schools . At age 15 , he left school to become a telegraph messenger and for the next three years took various jobs in that field before deciding to pursue a career in the law . He first studied with attorney Francis W. <unk> , then with his uncle , William Whitney ; both were in Pottsville . He was still engaged as a student in 1861 , when the Civil War broke out . 
 On April 15 , 1861 , President Abraham Lincoln called for 50 @,@ 000 volunteers to fight to preserve the Union . The following day , Bosbyshell joined the Washington <unk> , a local militia company , which quickly set out for Washington . En route , the company had to march through the streets of Baltimore on April 17 . A hostile crowd of Confederate sympathizers gathered ; according to accounts in his lifetime , he was struck by a missile variously described as a stone or a brick . Although it gave him a large bruise and momentarily stunned him , the object drew no blood ; Private Bosbyshell was purportedly the first man wounded in the Union cause , while an African @-@ American servant , hit a few minutes later by a missile which broke the skin , was deemed the first man to have shed his blood for the Union . However , official records do not list Bosbyshell among the casualties of the Baltimore riots . 
 In Washington , the company was quartered in the Ladies ' Gallery of the Senate Chamber , in the Capitol . The 350 Pennsylvania troops who first reached Washington on April 18 became known as the First Defenders and , after the war , the survivors formed an association with that name . While they were lodged at the Capitol , President Lincoln , Secretary of State William H. Seward , and Secretary of War Simon Cameron visited . Bosbyshell recalled Lincoln , " yes , here , towering over all in the room was the great central figure of the war . I remember how I was impressed by the kindliness of his face and awkward hanging of his arms and legs , his apparent <unk> in the presence of these first soldiers of the Republic , and with it all a grave , rather mournful bearing in his attitude . " 
 The Washington <unk> were redesignated as Company H of the 25th Pennsylvania Volunteers , and were sent down the Potomac River to Fort Washington , where the company spent three months strengthening the fortifications . Bosbyshell was offered a first lieutenancy in the regular Army , which he declined , stating that he preferred volunteer service . When the company 's term of enlistment expired , Bosbyshell rejoined Union forces as a second lieutenant in Company G , 48th Pennsylvania Volunteers , to serve a three @-@ year term from October 1 , 1861 . 
 For about a month after his re @-@ enlistment , Bosbyshell was regimental recruiting officer in Harrisburg , but on November 11 , sailed with his regiment from Fortress Monroe , Virginia , to Hatteras , North Carolina . There he served as acting adjutant of his regiment , and as judge advocate for courts @-@ martial . When General Ambrose Burnside launched an attack on New Bern , he took six companies of the 48th with him , as well as Bosbyshell , though Company G was not included among the Union forces . In April and May 1862 , Bosbyshell received successive promotions to first lieutenant and captain and was assigned to command his company , which he did at such battles as Second Bull Run , Antietam , and Fredericksburg . After Fredericksburg , he was again assigned to serve in courts @-@ martial ; when the regiment was moved west in early 1863 , Bosbyshell was assigned as provost marshal of Louisville , Kentucky . While stationed at Louisville , he returned home to Pennsylvania on leave of absence to marry Martha Stem , daughter of a minister . 
 When the regiment was ordered to Tennessee in September 1863 to take part in Union actions there , Bosbyshell was made Acting Assistant Adjutant @-@ General for the First Brigade of the Ninth Corps , of which the 48th was part . He fought at Blue Springs and Campbell 's Station , and took part in the siege of Knoxville . In 1864 , he returned to Pennsylvania again to help bring the regiment up to strength . Returning to his brigade post , he commanded African @-@ American troops in the Wilderness Campaign . 
 On July 10 , 1864 , Bosbyshell was promoted to major and ordered to command the 48th , though he remained at his brigade post temporarily . At this time , Union forces were besieging Petersburg , south of the Confederate capital , Richmond , Virginia . The acting commander of the 48th , Lieutenant Colonel Henry Pleasants , in civilian life a mining engineer , conceived the idea of digging under the Confederate lines and exploding a giant bomb . After weeks of preparation , the bomb was exploded on July 30 , creating a huge pit in the ground and a hole in the Confederate lines . After initial shock , the Confederates rallied and repulsed the attempt to break the lines , aided by Union bungling . Bosbyshell led African @-@ American troops into action in the Battle of the Crater ; they suffered over 400 casualties . With Pleasants promoted to General Robert B. Potter 's staff , Bosbyshell took command of the 48th on August 2 , 1864 . 
 Bosbyshell led his command at Globe Tavern and at Peebles 's Farm . In September 1864 , he sought leave of absence to return to Pennsylvania on personal business . When this was refused , and with his three @-@ year term of service having expired , he was mustered out on October 1 , 1864 . 
 = = Return to Pennsylvania = = 
 Having returned to Pottsville , Bosbyshell entered first the banking business , and then the book and stationary trade , each time with " disastrous " results . A Republican , he ran for prothonotary of Schuylkill County in 1866 , but was defeated . 
 Shortly after the war , the Grand Army of the Republic ( GAR ) , a Union veteran 's group , was founded . During Bosbyshell 's campaign to become prothonotary , he was asked to organize the Schuylkill County branch , but declined because of his status as a candidate . The following year , however , he joined the GAR , organizing Post 24 in Pottsville . He became Schuylkill County district commander of the GAR soon after , and in 1869 was elected Pennsylvania 's GAR department commander . 
 In 1869 , Bosbyshell was hired as Register of Deposits of the Philadelphia Mint , and moved to that city . The Chief Coiner , A. Loudon Snowden , was impressed by Bosbyshell , and promoted him to Assistant Coiner in 1872 . When Snowden left the Mint to accept a position as postmaster in 1876 , President Ulysses Grant promoted Bosbyshell in his place . Grant nominated Bosbyshell on December 14 , 1876 ; he was confirmed by the Senate on December 26 . According to numismatic historian Q. David Bowers , Bosbyshell , while serving as Chief Coiner , used Mint facilities and out @-@ of @-@ date dies to strike rare three @-@ dollar pieces , including the 1873 , 1875 , and 1876 issues . During Bosbyshell 's tenure , quantities of pattern coins , restrikes , and pieces struck in different metals flowed to well @-@ connected collectors and dealers , and Bosbyshell sold a large personal collection of such pieces shortly after leaving office . 
 Bosbyshell served as Chief Coiner until early 1885 ; with the approaching advent of the first Cleveland administration , Democrats would be appointed as Mint officials , and Bosbyshell secured a position as chief clerk in the Philadelphia City Controller 's office . Bosbyshell was hired , despite the fact that he was a Republican in a Democratic @-@ run municipal administration , because of his friendship with Controller Robert <unk> . 
 Having maintained his involvement in the GAR , Bosbyshell was in charge of the committee on arrangements for the Tenth National Encampment of the GAR , at Philadelphia in 1876 . In 1879 , he was elected as commander of Post 2 in that city . He also joined the Second Regiment of the Pennsylvania National Guard , and was elected major in 1878 and lieutenant colonel in 1880 . 
 = = Mint superintendent ( 1889 – 1894 ) = = 
 On October 17 , 1889 , President Benjamin Harrison commissioned Bosbyshell as superintendent of the Philadelphia Mint . As the Senate was not sitting , Bosbyshell received a recess appointment . Bosbyshell filed his oath of office on November 1 , 1889 . On his first day on the job , he was greeted with a bouquet of flowers and a large pile of mail from office @-@ seekers . He gave receipts for the Mint property he was now responsible for , and found no errors in the accounts of his predecessor . On December 16 , 1889 , with the Senate in session , Harrison nominated Bosbyshell . The following day , Vermont Senator Justin Morrill , on behalf of the Senate Finance Committee , to which Bosbyshell 's nomination had been referred , recommended that he be confirmed . The Senate did so on December 19 . 
 In 1890 , Bosbyshell deposited $ 4 @,@ 200 of federal funds in the Keystone National Bank , which then went bankrupt . Bosbyshell was responsible for the debt , which was only $ 300 less than his annual salary , and paid it off by stages , completing the payments in 1894 . In August 1890 , Bosbyshell was elected colonel of his National Guard regiment ; the vote was unexpectedly close , as he was disliked by some of his fellow officers . Following the Homestead Riots in July 1892 , Pennsylvania Governor Robert E. Pattison ordered militia to the strike @-@ torn town to restore order . Bosbyshell led his guard regiment to Homestead , where the strikers offered no resistance . In August 1893 , he resigned from the regiment . 
 Before Congress abolished the practice in 1873 , the government made silver legal tender alongside gold . This led to one of the great political controversies of the late 1800s , as many called for a return to pre @-@ 1873 laws , which would require the government to take all the silver offered it and then return it , struck into silver dollars . On January 3 , 1891 , two " free silver " advocates called at the Philadelphia Mint with a large ingot of silver , and asked for it to be coined . When the weighing clerk declined , they asked to see Bosbyshell , who received them , but refused their demand . He did , however , write at their request a letter stating that the laws forbade coinage of silver provided by the public . 
 Bosbyshell was Mint Superintendent while the Mint created new coin designs , including the Barber coinage , Columbian half dollar , and Isabella quarter . In the case of the quarter , issued in 1893 , Bosbyshell was involved in the consultations within the Mint over the design , and sent a letter to Caroline Peddle , who was initially hired to design the piece , requiring that the image of Queen Isabella on the coin not wear a crown . Soon after , Peddle withdrew from the project . 
 Cleveland was elected for a second non @-@ consecutive term in November 1892 . With the Democrats in power again , new Mint Director Robert Preston in late March 1894 ordered Bosbyshell to turn over the Philadelphia Mint to his successor , Dr. Eugene Townsend . This required the counting of every coin in the facility , including cents and nickels . After consulting with the sureties on his bond as superintendent , Bosbyshell objected to resigning until the count ( expected to take three months ) was complete , but nevertheless left office as directed on March 31 , 1894 . 
 = = Later years , interests , and death = = 
 Bosbyshell had been elected vice @-@ president of the Fidelity National Life Insurance Company in February 1893 ; in December of that year he was elected treasurer instead , a post he still held as of 1908 . President McKinley appointed him a member of the 1898 Assay Commission . 
 In September 1893 , a major theft at the Philadelphia Mint had been discovered . Henry Cochran , weighing clerk , had been surreptitiously extracting gold bars from a vault sealed in 1887 , not with a solid door but with a latticed one that was somewhat loose . Bosbyshell , in taking custody of the Philadelphia Mint 's assets from his predecessor , Daniel Fox , had not asked for the gold to be weighed . When the gold was taken out to be converted into coin in 1893 , the shortage was discovered . Although some of the gold was recovered , there was still a shortage of $ 12 @,@ 810 @.@ 82 , and the government brought suit against Bosbyshell after he left office in 1894 , securing judgment against him and the sureties on his bond . Bosbyshell appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit , which ruled against him . The district court had ruled for Bosbyshell on the matter of 733 silver dollars said to be missing , leaving only the question of the gold . Bosbyshell asked for review by the Supreme Court , but also sought legislative relief , and on February 2 , 1899 , Congress absolved him of the debt , making the court case moot . 
 With the outbreak of the Spanish – American War in 1898 , Bosbyshell organized and served as colonel of the Nineteenth Pennsylvania National Guard Regiment , which was used for homeland defense . He remained in that capacity from August 1898 until November 1899 . 
 As well as the GAR , Bosbyshell had many interests and activities . An Episcopalian , he was a vestryman of the Church of the Savior in Philadelphia ; for many years he conducted the choir and involved himself in Sunday school work , often as superintendent . He memorialized his regiment 's wartime experiences with The 48th in the War , published in 1895 , and was a member of several other veterans societies . He was also chairman of the Board of Trustees of the University Lodge of Masons . Taking an interest in genealogy , around 1910 he published Descendants of Christian and Elizabeth ( Oliver ) Bosbyshell 1782 – 1910 . 
 Oliver Bosbyshell died on August 1 , 1921 , after suffering a stroke . He was survived by one of his children , Oliver , and by several grandchildren . He had four sons with his wife Martha , who died in 1914 ; their eldest son Nathan died in Los Angeles in 1888 at age 23 . 
 = Der Herr ist mein getreuer Hirt , BWV 112 = 
 Der Herr ist mein getreuer Hirt ( The Lord is my faithful Shepherd ) , BWV 112 , is a cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach , a church cantata for the second Sunday after Easter . Bach composed the chorale cantata in Leipzig and first performed it on 8 April 1731 . It is based on the hymn by Wolfgang <unk> , a paraphrase of Psalm 23 written in 1530 , sung to a melody by Nikolaus Decius . 
 Bach , the Thomaskantor in Leipzig from May 1723 , composed this cantata to complete his second cantata cycle of chorale cantatas , begun in 1724 . He used the lyrics of the hymn unchanged , which reflect the psalm and Jesus as the Good Shepherd . Bach structured the work in five movements . The outer choral movements are a chorale fantasia and a four @-@ part closing chorale , both on the hymn tune . Bach set the inner stanzas as aria – recitative – aria , with music unrelated to the hymn tune . He scored the cantata for four vocal soloists , a four @-@ part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns , two oboes d 'amore , strings and continuo . Bach scholars agree that the brass instruments , normally reserved for Feast days , could come from an earlier chorale fantasia of the same melody with the text of the German Gloria . 
 = = History and words = = 
 In his second year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig , Bach composed chorale cantatas between the first Sunday after Trinity of 1724 and Palm Sunday of 1725 , but for Easter he returned to cantatas on more varied texts . He had not composed a chorale cantata yet for the occasion Misericordias Domini , the second Sunday after Easter . The prescribed readings for that Sunday were from the First Epistle of Peter ( Christ as a model – 1 Peter 2 : 21 – 25 ) , and from the Gospel of John , ( the Good Shepherd – John 10 : 11 – 16 ) . 
 During the cycle of 1724 / 25 , the text of the inner stanzas of a hymn was paraphrased by a contemporary poet with whom Bach collaborated . In this cantata however , Bach used the hymn text unchanged , a 1530 hymn in five stanzas written by Wolfgang <unk> as a paraphrase of Psalm 23 . The hymn is sung to the melody of " Allein Gott in der <unk> sei Ehr " , the German <unk> , by Nikolaus Decius ( 1522 ) . <unk> 's hymn is different from the one with the same opening line by Cornelius Becker , but sung to the same melody , which Bach had used in his other two cantatas for the same occasion , Du Hirte Israel , <unk> , BWV 104 and Ich bin ein guter Hirt , BWV 85 . The hymn 's topic , the Lord as the Good Shepherd , has traditionally been used for Jesus and is thus related to the gospel . 
 Bach first performed the cantata at the Nikolaikirche on 8 April 1731 . 
 = = Structure and scoring = = 
 Bach structured the cantata in five movements . The text and tune of the hymn are kept in the outer choral movements , a chorale fantasia and a four @-@ part closing chorale , which frame a alternating arias and a recitative . Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists ( soprano , alto , tenor , bass ) , a four @-@ part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns ( Co ) , two oboes d 'amore ( Oa ) , two violins ( Vl ) , viola ( Va ) and basso continuo . 
 In the following table of the movements , the scoring follows the Neue Bach @-@ Ausgabe . The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred Dürr , using the symbol for common time ( 4 / 4 ) . The continuo , playing throughout , is not shown . 
 = = Music = = 
 In the opening chorus , a chorale fantasia , the melody of the German Gloria " Allein Gott in der <unk> sei Ehr " is embedded in an orchestral concerto . The movement opens with calls derived from the chorale tune played on the two horns , leading to a free concerto with the strings and oboes . The cantus firmus is sung by the soprano in long notes , while the lower voices engage in imitation . John Eliot Gardiner compares the movement to the openings of the two former cantatas for the same occasion : " The presence of two horns ... reveals a much more regal portrait of the Good Shepherd than we have previously met . " Both Alfred Dürr and Klaus Hofmann assume that the music was not originally composed for this pastoral text , but previously , for the Gloria . Bach had composed a different chorale fantasia on the same melody in Auf Christi Himmelfahrt allein , BWV 128 , with similar instrumentation . 
 The inner three movements quote the text of the hymn without change , but their music is not related to the hymn tune . The alto aria is accompanied by an obbligato oboe . It is structured in two similar parts , and is in pastoral 6 / 8 time . The steady flow of the oboe can be seen as depicting the " pure water " mentioned in the text , the steps in the continuo as " the steps made on this significant journey " " on the pathway of the righteousness of His commandments " . 
 The central movement begins as an arioso , accompanied by the continuo , illustrating the walk through the " valley of darkness " . The second part is a dramatic recitative with strings , first expressing " <unk> , Leiden , Trübsal " ( persecution , sorrow , trouble ) in a broken melodic line against sustained string chords , then " Thy rod and Thy staff comfort me " , where the " first violins weave a comforting little melody " . 
 The following duet expresses enjoyment at God 's table in a dance , a bourrée . 
 The cantata closes with a four @-@ part chorale , most instruments playing colla parte , while the horns play different parts because of their limited range .

 Alejandro Sanz ( Spanish pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ] ; born Alejandro Sánchez Pizarro ; December 18 , 1968 ) is a Spanish singer @-@ songwriter and musician . For his work , Sanz has won a total of fifteen Latin Grammy Awards and three Grammy Awards . He has won the Latin Grammy for Album of the Year three times , more than any other artist . The singer is notable for his flamenco @-@ influenced ballads , but he has also experimented with rock , funk , electronic , jazz and many genres from latin music . 
 Born in Madrid , Sanz began playing guitar at age seven , taking influence from his family 's flamenco roots . Sanz released his debut album at age nineteen , although he did not gain commercial success in Spain until his second release , Viviendo Deprisa . His next two records , Si Tú Me Miras ( 1993 ) and 3 ( 1995 ) also fared well commercially , but it was his 1997 breakthrough album Más that garnered international success . El Alma al Aire followed in 2000 , selling more than a million copies in its first week . In 2002 , he became the first Spanish artist to record an MTV Unplugged album . En 1991 , for the album Viviendo Deprisa , made song in English called " Blowfish " 
 His collaboration with Shakira on the 2005 single " La Tortura " reached number one on several charts worldwide . His albums No Es lo Mismo ( 2003 ) and El Tren de los Momentos ( 2006 ) showed Sanz experimenting with more diverse styles of music , while his most recent release , Paraíso Express ( 2009 ) served as a return to form for the musician . He signed to Universal Music Group in 2011 and released his tenth studio album , La Música No Se Toca , on September 25 , 2012 , followed by Sirope on May 4 , 2015 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Sanz was born in Madrid , Spain , on December 18 , 1968 , the youngest son of María Pizarro and Jesús Sánchez . He grew up in the neighborhood of <unk> in eastern Madrid . Sanz recalled that " Back then , kids grew up on the street ... I was a bit like the group troubadour ; the one who played the guitar and sang . That kept me out of a lot of trouble . " Sanz 's father , a door @-@ to @-@ door book salesman , played guitar professionally , which inspired seven @-@ year @-@ old Sanz to learn to play the instrument . He pursued the instrument with an intensity that eventually frustrated his mother , who broke his guitar one morning after his playing kept the family from sleeping . 
 He was exposed to traditional flamenco music as a child while vacationing each summer in his parents ' native Andalusia in southern Spain . Originally , Sanz intended to become a flamenco performer , but he found the music teachers to be overly strict . Commenting on his early experiences , Sanz explained , " Flamenco can be very hard on beginners . If you lose the rhythm , they toss you out with , ' You 're no good , boy ! ' They 're very strict and very cruel . But it 's also a marvelous education , because you either learn to play or else . " He felt that he could not compete with his peers , and decided to focus on creating pop music with flamenco influences , viewing flamenco to be a " lifestyle " better suited to others .

 As a teenager , Sanz performed in various venues in his hometown . He became acquainted with Miguel Ángel Arenas , a music industry executive who had signed several popular Spanish groups such as Mecano . Arenas helped Sanz find work , eventually leading to a record deal with the Spanish label <unk> . In 1989 Sanz released his debut album , Los Chulos Son Pa ' Cuidarlos under the name of Alejandro Magno ( Spanish for " Alexander the Great " ) . The record , which fused techno and flamenco , was met with critical and commercial indifference , and today Sanz views the record to be " insignificant " . However , the album is now considered to be a collector 's item . In an attempt to promote Los Chulos Son Pa ' Cuidarlos , he performed at strip clubs , playing short sets between acts . This proved to be unsuccessful and Sanz took a break from music , choosing to study business administration . He also took a job at a recording studio in which he wrote material for other artists . He persuaded Arenas to send demos of his songs to record companies , which led to being signed by Warner Music Latina . At this time , he began performing under his current name . 
 Sanz 's rise to fame began in 1991 , when he released his first album from Warner , Viviendo Deprisa . The record and the songs " <unk> Fuerte " and " Se le <unk> la Luz " helped him gain a dedicated fan base in Spain . In 1993 , he released Si Tú Me Miras shortly followed by a live album , titled <unk> . That same year , he recorded a song entitled " Mi Primera Canción " with flamenco pioneer Paco de Lucía , whom Sanz idolized as a child . He released his third studio album since changing his stage name , 3 , in 1995 . In addition to Spanish , 3 was also released in Italian and Portuguese . " La Fuerza del Corazón " , the first single released from 3 , was his first song to chart internationally . All three albums proved to be successful , reaching multi @-@ platinum status in Spain .

 Sanz spent two years in Milan , Italy to work on a follow @-@ up for 3 . For the album , he wished to create a " true fusion " of many different sounds , and began studying the saxophone and piano in addition to guitar . In 1997 , Sanz released his fifth studio album , Más , a record containing ballads strongly influenced by flamenco , pop , and tropical rhythms . Driven by the singles " Corazón Partío " , " Y , ¿ Si Fuera Ella ? " , " Amiga Mía " , " <unk> Que Me <unk> " , and " Siempre Es de Noche " , Más sold more than two million copies in Spain and was certified 22 × Platinum in the country , making it the best @-@ selling album in Spanish history . The album remained on the Billboard Latin Albums chart for 74 weeks , and one year after the record 's release , Sanz was granted an Ondas Award for Best Song for " Corazón Partío " . According to David Cazares of the South Florida Sun @-@ Sentinel , the album " made Sanz an international star on the strength of the pop @-@ salsa hit ' Corazón Partío ' , a song on the lips of fans from Spain to Cuba and the United States . " Following the success of the album , Sanz began touring in United States for the first time . 
 His fifth album , El Alma al Aire , released September 26 , 2000 , featured Sanz exploring a wider array of musical genres , including jazz , R & B , soul and tango . In Spain , the album sold more than one million copies in the first week , breaking the record of one million copies sold in four months , also set by Sanz with his previous album , Más . At the 2001 Latin Grammy Awards , Sanz walked away with four awards : Best Pop Male Vocal Album and Album of the Year for El Alma al Aire , and Record of the Year and Song of the Year for the title track from the album . Later that year , El Alma al Aire was released in a special edition including Sanz 's duets with Irish band The Corrs . In October 2001 , Sanz collaborated with Michael Jackson and various other artists on the Spanish version of the charity single " What More Can I Give " , which benefited the victims of the September 11 attacks . 
 In 2002 , Sanz recorded MTV Unplugged at the Gusman Center for the Performing Arts in Miami , Florida . He was the first Spanish artist to record and release an MTV Unplugged album . For Sanz , the recording of the album " changed the way I do my music . It was a rediscovery of how to perform , and also how to record , music with live musicians . That was the spirit of the music in its pure form , though [ it is ironic ] that the more people who are playing , the more simple it is . " With the MTV Unplugged , he garnered three Latin Grammy Awards ( Album of the Year , Recording of the Year and Song of the Year for " Y Sólo Se Me <unk> Amarte " ) .

 On September 2 , 2003 , Sanz released his sixth studio album , No Es lo Mismo . On this record , Sanz took a more political approach than he had on previous releases . The song " Sandy a Orilla do Mundo " discusses oil spills on the Spanish coast , while " <unk> " tells the story of people fleeing from Cuba on makeshift rafts . The album won four awards at the 2004 Latin Grammy Awards , including Album of the Year and Record of the Year . Sanz was unable to attend the event and his awards were accepted by presenters and colleagues . Also in 2004 , he became the first Spanish musician to give a lecture at Harvard University , speaking about Hispanic culture at the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies . 
 In 2005 , Sanz collaborated with Shakira on her song " La Tortura " . Co @-@ written by Sanz , the song became an international hit , breaking the record for the most weeks at the number one spot on the Hot Latin Songs chart . The song exposed Sanz to a more diverse audience , and helped build anticipation for his next release . The first single from the album El Tren de los Momentos , " A la Primera Persona " , became his first song to enter the Billboard Hot 100 , peaking at number 100 on the chart . The record was also noted for its guest appearances , which featured Shakira , Juanes , Alex González of Maná , and Residente of Calle 13 . 
 In the spring of 2007 , Sanz suffered a mental breakdown and took two months off in the middle of a world tour at the request of his doctor . The breakdown was caused by several events in his personal life , including the death of his father in 2005 , his separation with Mexican model and actress <unk> Mitchel , and his announcement that he had a three @-@ year @-@ old son outside of his marriage with Mitchel . He commented on the situation , saying " You have to put things in perspective . It was stress , something that had never affected me , but this time , yes , it did . So I had to pay . A doctor told me to stop for a couple of months to recuperate completely . " Sanz spent time in therapy , a time which " helped [ him ] a lot " and gave him " more power " to perform . 
 In a press conference in late 2007 , he criticized Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez , calling him " undemocratic " in the wake of a petition made by Venezuelan citizens to prevent Chávez from running for re @-@ election . Sanz further stated " If they gave me 3 million signatures to stop singing , I would stop singing immediately . " Supporters of Chávez subsequently gathered 230 @,@ 000 signatures in response to Sanz ' comments .

 To promote his new record , Paraíso Express , Sanz started a campaign in which fans could create a video about their definition of paradise and upload it to his YouTube channel . Artists such as Shakira , Laura Pausini and Paulina Rubio also participated . On November 10 , 2009 , Sanz released Paraíso Express . This record was described as a return to form for Sanz , focusing more on melody as opposed to the experimentation he pursued on his previous two albums . He commented that " On this album , I first composed the melody and then the lyrics . It is more of a rock album than my past releases , with more elegant and positive lyrics and a happier and more rhythmic spirit . " The bilingual single " Looking for Paradise " featuring Alicia Keys reached number one on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart . At the 2010 Latin Grammy Awards , the album was nominated Album of the Year and Best Male Pop Vocal Album , while the single " Desde <unk> " received both Record and Song of the Year nominations . 
 On February 15 , 2011 , Sanz announced that he would be signing with Universal Music Group after twenty years with Warner . In the same year , Sanz received the Latin Heritage Award by the American Society of Composers , Authors and Publishers ( ASCAP ) in recognition of his contributions to Latin music . On September 2 , 2012 , the singer unveiled the official artwork of his upcoming ninth studio album , La Música No Se Toca on his official site . Sanz released La Música No Se Toca , featuring the single " No Me Compares " and based on the opening theme song in the telenovela Amores <unk> , on September 25 , 2012 . On August 21 , 2012 , Sanz released his new single " <unk> ( Me <unk> ) " , a duet with Brazilian singer @-@ songwriter Ana Carolina . The song is a Portuguese @-@ Spanish song and it 's only available in Brazil 's iTunes . On September 17 , he released the album 's second single , " Se <unk> " . In 2013 , Sanz was recognized as the Pop Male Artist of the Year and was the recipient of the Excellence Award at the 26th Lo Nuestro Awards for his achievements in the music industry . 
 On November 6 , 2013 Sanz received an honorary doctor of music degree from Berklee College of Music . “ It is a great honor for me to receive this doctorate degree from one of the most prestigious music schools in the world , ” Sanz said of the Berklee recognition . “ I will continue to work every day of my life to deserve this honor . ” Sanz released his eleventh studio album , Sirope , featuring the single " A Que No Me <unk> " , a collaboration with Alejandro Fernandez and used as the opening theme song in the telenovela A Que No Me <unk> , on May 4 , 2015 . The album took a year and one month to record , and features an " eclectic sound " in Sanz 's words , containing elements of flamenco , R & B , and folk music . He worked with producer Sebastian <unk> , who helped him " enrich what was there but [ not lose ] the essence " of the songs . 
 = = Musical style = = 
 Early in his career , Sanz ' music generally consisted of romantic ballads . However , in the late 1990s , his collaborations with other artists greatly expanded his musical style . On No Es lo Mismo , he experimented with rock , salsa , and hip hop . While recording the album , Sanz noted that he often entered the studio with a rough idea for a song and the guest artists would " contaminate it with their rhythms ... in a good way . " El Tren de los Momentos continued this pattern of musical experimentation , featuring diverse genres such as funk , jazz , and country . Despite this , Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic described his musical evolution by saying " Even as Sanz broadened his style over the years , he never ventured far from his strength : romantic songs , generally ballads , tinged with flamenco and sung wholeheartedly with his distinct voice . " 
 Sanz is known for his distinctive raspy vocals , which he attributes to his flamenco roots , crediting singer Camarón de la Isla as a major influence . His song " Sí , He <unk> Mal " ( Yes , I Have Sung Badly ) from No Es lo Mismo references this , with Sanz saying " I 'm laughing a little at myself so that I can laugh at other things . Sometimes , I 'm harder on myself than any music critic can be . I 'm laughing at that . " Throughout his youth , Sanz was heavily influenced by English @-@ language heavy metal groups such as Iron Maiden and Dio , referring to himself as a " heavy metal radical " . He also feels that living in the city of Cadiz had a major impact on his musical style , where " Any 7 @-@ year @-@ old kid you find knows how to play guitar , play the cajón , knows how to sing . When the family comes together we start to sing . In a way it 's not just music , it 's culture . " 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Sanz married Mexican fashion model and actress <unk> Michel in Bali on December 30 , 1999 , but this marriage was never legally recognized in either of their home countries . Sanz felt that having a legally recognized marriage was unnecessary : " My wife is my wife and I am her husband . For me , that has enough validity ... I am married with the heart . " The couple separated in 2005 . Their daughter , Manuela Sánchez Michel , was born on July 28 , 2001 . Sanz later had a son named Alexander with Valeria Rivera , a Puerto Rican fashion designer . 
 Sanz welcomed his third child in New York , a boy named Dylan ( b . July 2011 ) , the first child from his relationship with girlfriend and former assistant , Raquel Perera . Sanz chose flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucía to be the godfather to his son . Sanz and Perera are godparents to David Bisbal 's daughter , Ella . On May 23 , 2012 , Sanz married Raquel Perera in a private ceremony in Sabadell ( Barcelona ) . Sanz had a second child ( a daughter ) with wife Raquel Perera in Madrid on the 24th of June , 2014 . They named her Alma . 
 In addition to music , Sanz enjoys painting , which he often does while trying to create ideas for new songs . He explains that painting " teaches you that taking risks rarely leads to failure . In fact , from the moment you assume a risk , you have succeeded . "

 = I Love Bacon ! = 
 I Love Bacon ! is a cookbook with over fifty recipes devoted to bacon and bacon dishes , many of them from celebrity chefs . The book was written by Jayne Rockmill and photography was provided by Ben Fink . Broken down into eight sections , the book covered how to make homemade bacon and moves onto " brunch " and " small bites " before covering soups , salads and sides , pasta , fish , meat , and desserts . I Love Bacon ! was published in October 2010 by Andrews McMeel Publishing and met with favorable reviews for its unique dishes and helpful culinary tips for novices . 
 = = Background = = 
 The book 's author , Jayne Rockmill , is a literary agent based in New York City whose clients include Tony Caputo , François <unk> , and the professional photographer and storm chaser , Jim Reed . Rockmill had also become involved in producing charity food and wine events , and is a longtime supporter of the New York City Food Bank and Share Our Strength , which focuses on ending childhood hunger . She conceived the book as a way to help raise money for their work , and a portion of the proceeds from I Love Bacon will be donated to the two charities . Rockmill began by asking chefs she knew personally to donate bacon recipes , and then contacted others across the United States . In some cases , she adapted the original recipes in collaboration with the chefs . 
 The book 's illustrator is the well @-@ known food photographer , Ben Fink , whose photographs appear in Food & Wine , Bon Appétit , <unk> and publications of the Culinary Institute of America . A native of Memphis , Tennessee now based in New York , Fink illustrated Jacques Pépin 's , Fast Food My Way ( 2004 ) and Maggie <unk> 's Artisan Baking Across America ( 2000 ) for which he won a James Beard Foundation Award in 2001 . Some of Fink 's more unusual food photographs are those for Martha Hopkins and Randall <unk> 's 1997 <unk> : An <unk> Cookbook , where the food is photographed against the background of a naked human body .

 I Love Bacon ! contains over 50 recipes from celebrity chefs including Cat Cora , John <unk> , Ming Tsai , and Chris Cosentino , as well as brief biographies of the chefs themselves . It presents basic bacon recipes as well as dishes with bacon as one of the chief ingredients . The recipes are grouped into eight sections beginning with Make Your Own Bacon which has recipes for " Classic Cured Bacon " , " Spicy Braised Bacon " , " Soy @-@ Ginger Braised Bacon " , " Crispy Pork Belly " , and " Chinese Style Pork Belly " . The remaining seven sections ( Brunch ; Small Bites ; Soups , Salads and Sides , Pasta , Fish , Meat and Desserts ) contain recipes for dishes using bacon as one of the main ingredients . 
 The Brunch section begins with a recipe from Seattle @-@ based Black Rock Spirits for " <unk> Bloody Mary " , a variant on the traditional Bloody Mary cocktail using bacon infused vodka with the glass rim dipped in lime juice and finely crumbled grilled bacon . Although the majority of recipes in this section feature bacon with its traditional brunch partner , eggs , there is also a recipe for " Mediterranean <unk> " . This version of the classic BLT sandwich pairs the bacon , lettuce and tomato with toasted focaccia bread and red @-@ pepper aioli in place of mayonnaise . Another version of the BLT using toasted brioche and sun @-@ dried tomatoes cut into mini @-@ sandwiches appears in the Small Bites section which is devoted to bacon @-@ based hors d <unk> . 
 Among the recipes in Soups , Salads and Sides are " Egg Chowder with Bacon and New Potatoes " , " Grilled Bacon and Cucumber Salad with Chili Caramel Dressing " , and " Spicy Braised Bacon with <unk> Beans and Treviso <unk> " which uses thickly sliced pork belly bacon . The Pasta section has a recipe for " Bacon Mac and Cheese " from Julie Taras Wallach , the chef and co @-@ owner of the <unk> Parson and Little Giant restaurants in New York City . Her variant on the traditional macaroni and cheese uses <unk> pasta seasoned with <unk> mustard , thyme , rosemary , garlic , and nutmeg and incorporates sauteed onion and pieces of grilled bacon . One of the recipes in the Meat section , " Veal and Foie Gras Meatloaf Wrapped in Bacon " , comes from Mark Allen , who in 1997 became the youngest chef , and the first American , to have headed The Dining Room at the Ritz @-@ Carlton in Boston . Allen also contributed a recipe for the Fish section , " Whole Roasted <unk> with Carrots and Bacon " . Other dishes in that section include " <unk> @-@ Wrapped <unk> with Cauliflower <unk> " and " Bluefish with Corn , Avocado , and Bacon Salad " . 
 Like its somewhat lengthier predecessors , Sara Perry 's Everything Tastes Better with Bacon ( 2002 ) , Pruess and Lape 's Seduced by Bacon ( 2006 ) , and James Villas 's The Bacon Cookbook ( 2007 ) , Rockmill 's I Love Bacon ! includes sweet dishes using bacon . Among the recipes in the Desserts section are " Bacon Panna Cotta with <unk> " , " Cane Sugar and Bacon @-@ Iced <unk> " , and Cat Cora 's " Pig Candy Ice Cream " . Cora 's recipe uses a pound ( .454 kilograms ) of chopped <unk> @-@ smoked bacon per quart ( <unk> litres ) of brown sugar @-@ sweetened vanilla ice cream .

 Carol Johnson writing in the Kansas City Star described I Love Bacon ! as both a cookbook with " inventive " recipes and " a mini @-@ course in some of the country 's top restaurants . " Johnson noted that not all recipes were for beginners , but found the accompanying notes for many of the recipes with information about techniques and ingredients to be helpful . She described Ben Fink 's photography as " vivid and mouth @-@ watering , if a little spare . " The Republic of Bacon website favorably reviewed the cookbook for its ability to go beyond the standard classic cured bacon dishes and the added biographies of the leading industry chefs which contributed recipes to the book . 
 = Entrada ( Fringe ) = 
 " Entrada " is the eighth episode of the third season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe , and the 51st episode overall . The first part of the third season spent much of its time alternating between the prime and parallel universes , and " Entrada " was the first episode of the season to have time evenly divided between both . In the episode , both Olivia and her doppelganger " Fauxlivia " attempt to journey back to their respective universes . John Cassini , Seth Gabel , Ryan McDonald , Stefan Arngrim , and Karen Holness guest starred . 
 Showrunners J. H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner wrote the episode as the " culmination of a lot of things that [ they ] had been working on for quite a while . " Calling it one of their favorite episodes , they believed it was a good entry point for new viewers to the series . Frequent Fringe collaborator Brad Anderson returned to direct the episode . " Entrada " first aired on December 2 , 2010 in the United States to an estimated 5 @.@ 13 million viewers . It has been selected for " best episode " lists by various television critics . Both Anna Torv and John Noble submitted the episode for consideration at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards , but both failed to garner a nomination . 
 = = Plot = = 
 At the end of the previous episode , Olivia Dunham ( Anna Torv ) was able to cross over back to her universe long enough to warn Peter Bishop ( Joshua Jackson ) she is trapped in the parallel universe . After receiving the message , Peter tests the Olivia from the other dimension , " Fauxlivia " , by telling her the Greek phrase Na <unk> <unk> <unk> apo ton patera tou ( roughly , " May he be a better person than his father " ) , which Olivia told Peter in the " New Day in the Old Town " . When Fauxlivia fails to recognize the phrase , Peter confirms his suspicions . Realizing she has been exposed , Fauxlivia forces Peter to inject himself with a paralyzing agent . She then goes to a typewriter store in the Bronx to contact the parallel universe to request an extraction . 
 After Peter recovers , the Fringe team starts a search for Fauxlivia . Walter Bishop ( John Noble ) is distressed that he has no idea how to find Fauxlivia and no idea how to bring Olivia back . However , Astrid Farnsworth ( Jasika Nicole ) discovers Fauxlivia brought Walter malasadas from a bakery in the Bronx . Peter , Walter , Farnsworth and Phillip Broyles ( Lance Reddick ) search the nearby area , Peter finds the typewriter store and the team finds the typewriter used to contact the other universe ( a " quantum entanglement " device ) . There , the team realizes that Fauxlivia is going to a train station in Newark for a 4 : 00 PM pick @-@ up . 
 Meanwhile , in the parallel universe , " Walternate " ( Noble ) plans on using Olivia 's body in order for her alternate self to return home , as it would require a person of Olivia 's mass to complete the transfer . However , Walternate arranges for Olivia 's brain to be removed for further study on how to traverse universes safely . Before she is to start the operation , Olivia receives a visit from Colonel Broyles ( the alternate universe 's counterpart to her FBI supervisor ) , who is still grateful to Olivia for helping his son . Olivia convinces him that her universe is not at war with theirs ; the troubles started not from any hostile action , but only as an accidental side @-@ effect of Walter 's initial crossing to save Peter . Broyles later talks with his wife and then returns to Liberty Island to save Olivia . Together , the two reach the immersion tank that Olivia used earlier , but find it empty . As a back @-@ up plan , the two travel to Walternate 's long abandoned lab at Harvard to use the sensory deprivation tank . Broyles reveals there is a GPS tracker in him , but manages to buy Olivia enough time to successfully return to her universe . 
 As this transpires , Fauxlivia meets with a shapeshifter at the station to inject her with resonating rods . By that time , Broyles and Peter arrive at the station . To ensure her escape , Fauxlivia holds a hostage . However , Peter realizes the hostage is the shapeshifter when the hostage is unable to state the name of " her " nearby daughter . Peter shoots the shapeshifter in the head , killing it , and Fauxlivia is arrested . Later , the team learns that their own Olivia has returned . However , Fauxlivia still manages to escape back to her universe , leaving behind the mutilated body of the alternate counterpart of Broyles to make up for her mass . While Peter and Olivia reunite at a hospital , the typewriter store owner trades a piece of the doomsday device in exchange for the restoration of his paralyzed legs . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Entrada " was written by executive producers Jeff Pinkner and J. H. Wyman . Filmmaker and frequent Fringe collaborator Brad Anderson returned to direct the episode , shooting it in September 2010 on New Westminster 's Front Street in Vancouver and in a train station . The special effects crew used a prosthetic body resembling actor Lance Reddick , minus a certain amount of mass equal to Anna Torv ; they did research to find out how much a human leg typically weighs , finding the number to be around 20 percent of a body 's mass . 
 The third season spent much of its time alternating between the prime and parallel universes , and " Entrada " was the first episode of the season to have time divided between both . This was reflected in the opening credits , which were red and blue in a season that had previously differentiated each universe with one exclusive color . 
 Pinkner and Wyman revealed in a conference call interview that the episode was the " culmination of a lot of things that [ they ] had been working on for quite a while " . Though they loved all of their episodes , the two stated that " Entrada " was a particular favorite of theirs , with Pinker elaborating that " if the only episode of Fringe you ever tune into watch is this one , sure , it ’ s going to take you five minutes to catch up , but you will feel what ’ s going on , and you will understand the relationships ... [ It 's ] a great entry point " . The producers considered making " Entrada " the mid @-@ season finale , but instead selected " Marionette " , the following week 's episode . 
 The episode featured appearances by recurring guest stars Karen Holness as Phillip Broyles ' wife Diane , John Cassini as the Store Owner , and Ryan McDonald as scientist Brandon Fayette . Seth Gabel also returned to guest star as Lincoln Lee , an agent from the parallel universe . 
 In a departure from previous Fringe trailers , Fox created and premiered a " grandiose movie @-@ style " trailer at Entertainment Weekly 's website to celebrate the airing of " Entrada " . Pinkner explained that the trailer idea did not come from his production team , but rather was produced by a Fox division called Special Ops , who came up with the idea in order to platform Fringe to the audience in a way they had not seen before . As with other Fringe episodes , Fox released a science lesson plan in collaboration with Science Olympiad for grade school children , focusing on the science seen in " Entrada " , with the intention of having " students learn about scientific intuition and how it can facilitate the scientific method of collecting data through experimentation and observation in order to formulate and test a hypothesis " .

 The original broadcast of " Entrada " occurred on December 2 , 2010 in the United States . According to Nielsen ratings , it was watched by an estimated 5 @.@ 13 million viewers , earning a 3 @.@ 2 / 5 share among all households and a 1 @.@ 8 / 5 share among viewers aged 18 – 49 . This latter demographic was down five percent from the previous episode that aired on November 18 . Entertainment Weekly writer Lynette Rice remarked of the low ratings , " If this genre series were on AMC ( or featured zombies ) , the media world would be calling it a monster hit . Sadly , the threshold for success is far different on broadcast TV , so Fringe will always be viewed as a niche performer with a small but rabid fan base . " 
 Seven days after its broadcast on time shifted viewings , " Entrada " was seen by an additional 1 @.@ 7 million , pushing the total viewership up to 6 @.@ 87 million with a 2 @.@ 6 rating among those 18 – 49 .

 The episode received critical acclaim . James Poniewozik of Time Magazine wrote , " While it may not have been the high point that the emotional " Peter " from earlier this year was , " Entrada " was a pretty excellent action @-@ focused episode , in which the dimensional swap between Fauxlivia and <unk> came to a head . In the process , it demonstrated that Fringe 's writers have made a compelling world out of Over There in a relative few episodes — and it was another example of what a strong series Fringe has become since its committed fully to its clash @-@ of @-@ the @-@ universes storyline ... All in all , a satisfying hour and a good demonstration of how Fringe — one of the most improved shows of the past season or so — has grown into one of TV 's most entertaining dramas " . 
 Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly noted that the episode " closed a Fringe chapter in bringing Olivia back , while opening up all sorts of fresh new possibilities for the future . Both Olivias are changed women with new amounts of information about their opposing universes , and thus will be able to influence their Walters in how to proceed henceforth . The series can resume plot threads that have been given scant attention in recent weeks , such as Walter ’ s takeover of Massive Dynamic , and what I ’ m hoping will be an increased presence by Nina Sharp , whose role in the <unk> machinations is ripe for exploration " . 
 Writing for SFScope , Sarah Stegall praised Reddick 's performance as both Colonel Broyles , and Torv 's " tour @-@ de @-@ force " performance as Olivia and her doppelganger . She also noted how strong of a show Fringe has evolved into , lauding the producers ' decision to focus on the show 's " strongest and most innovative plot " : the parallel universe . Stegall expressed hope that Fauxlivia 's experiences in the prime universe would lead her to challenge Walternate 's more militant actions to destroy it . Stegall further recognized the episode 's editing , as " a complicated story like this one could have been endlessly confusing , with multiple versions of the same character , two extremely similar universes , and plot points reaching back to the first season . Yet the writing and direction kept it all sorted out , without resorting to voice @-@ overs , flashbacks , or other lame expository devices . This is classy , tight writing , and my hat 's off to the entire team " . Television Without Pity graded the episode an A + , . Noel Murry at The A.V. Club gave it an A- highlighting Torv 's performance . 
 It topped several " best episode of 2010 " lists , including Den of Geek , Give Me My Remote , and <unk> Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named " Entrada " the fifth best episode of the series , calling it " the sensational climax to season 3 's sensational Olivia / Fauxlivia parallel universe interplay , which seemed to bring out the best in both the writers of Fringe as well as its actors , especially Anna Torv , who rocked the tricky material and created a convincingly distinct and unique doppelganger iteration of Olivia . She deserved an Emmy nomination for her work this season . Oh , well . "

The video stars Spanish professional tennis player Rafael Nadal , who portrays Shakira 's love interest in the video . When asked about the reason for starring Nadal in the video , Shakira said she " thought that maybe I needed someone I could in some way identify with . And Rafael Nadal is a person who has been totally committed to his career since he was very young , since he was 17 , I believe . " The music videos for " Gypsy " and the Spanish @-@ language version " Gitana " were released on 27 February 2010 . The video begins with Shakira playing the harmonica , dressed in a black halter top and a long black skirt . The next scenes mainly consist of Shakira interacting with Nadal in different ways , such as dancing for him and laying together on the ground . The video ends with the duo sharing a kiss . 
 The video received positive reviews from critics . Melanie Bertoldi from Billboard praised Shakira 's appearance in the video , saying " the Colombian firebird looks hotter than ever " . The Huffington Post review of the video labelled it as a " steamy affair " . Alek & Steph from <unk> praised the chemistry between Shakira and Nadal , calling it " flirtatious and playful " . Jocelyn Vena from MTV praised the video for its " organic vibe " and commented that " while she ( Shakira ) claims that she 's willing to wear her lover 's clothes if they fit , she looks much hotter in the sheer black halter top and long black skirt that she sports at one point in the clip " . The PopEater review of the video complimented the duo 's chemistry and called them both " equally @-@ stunning " .

 = <unk> hypothesis = 
 The nebular hypothesis is the most widely accepted model in the field of cosmogony to explain the formation and evolution of the Solar System . It suggests that the Solar System formed from nebulous material . The theory was developed by Immanuel Kant and published in his Allgemeine <unk> und Theorie des Himmels ( " Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens " ) , published in 1755 . Originally applied to the Solar System , this process of planetary system formation is now thought to be at work throughout the Universe . The widely accepted modern variant of the nebular hypothesis is the solar nebular disk model ( SNDM ) or simply solar nebular model . This nebular hypothesis offered explanations for a variety of properties of the Solar System , including the nearly circular and coplanar orbits of the planets , and their motion in the same direction as the Sun 's rotation . Some elements of the nebular hypothesis are echoed in modern theories of planetary formation , but most elements have been superseded . 
 According to the nebular hypothesis , stars form in massive and dense clouds of molecular hydrogen — giant molecular clouds ( GMC ) . These clouds are gravitationally unstable , and matter coalesces within them to smaller denser clumps , which then rotate , collapse , and form stars . Star formation is a complex process , which always produces a gaseous protoplanetary disk around the young star . This may give birth to planets in certain circumstances , which are not well known . Thus the formation of planetary systems is thought to be a natural result of star formation . A Sun @-@ like star usually takes approximately 1 million years to form , with the protoplanetary disk evolving into a planetary system over the next 10 – 100 million years . 
 The protoplanetary disk is an accretion disk that feeds the central star . Initially very hot , the disk later cools in what is known as the T <unk> star stage ; here , formation of small dust grains made of rocks and ice is possible . The grains eventually may coagulate into kilometer @-@ sized planetesimals . If the disk is massive enough , the runaway accretions begin , resulting in the rapid — 100 @,@ 000 to 300 @,@ 000 years — formation of Moon- to Mars @-@ sized planetary embryos . Near the star , the planetary embryos go through a stage of violent mergers , producing a few terrestrial planets . The last stage takes approximately 100 million to a billion years . 
 The formation of giant planets is a more complicated process . It is thought to occur beyond the frost line , where planetary embryos mainly are made of various types of ice . As a result , they are several times more massive than in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk . What follows after the embryo formation is not completely clear . Some embryos appear to continue to grow and eventually reach 5 – 10 Earth masses — the threshold value , which is necessary to begin accretion of the hydrogen – helium gas from the disk . The accumulation of gas by the core is initially a slow process , which continues for several million years , but after the forming protoplanet reaches about 30 Earth masses ( M ⊕ ) it accelerates and proceeds in a runaway manner . <unk> and Saturn @-@ like planets are thought to accumulate the bulk of their mass during only 10 @,@ 000 years . The accretion stops when the gas is exhausted . The formed planets can migrate over long distances during or after their formation . Ice giants such as Uranus and Neptune are thought to be failed cores , which formed too late when the disk had almost disappeared .

 There is evidence that parts of the nebular hypothesis were first proposed in 1734 by Emanuel Swedenborg . Immanuel Kant , who was familiar with Swedenborg 's work , developed the theory further in 1755 , when Kant published his Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens , wherein he argued that gaseous clouds , nebulae , slowly rotate , gradually collapse and flatten due to gravity , eventually forming stars and planets . 
 A similar model was developed independently and proposed in 1796 by Pierre @-@ Simon <unk> in his Exposition du <unk> du monde . He envisioned that the Sun originally had an extended hot atmosphere throughout the volume of the Solar System . His theory featured a contracting and cooling protosolar cloud — the protosolar nebula . As this cooled and contracted , it flattened and spun more rapidly , throwing off ( or shedding ) a series of gaseous rings of material ; and according to him , the planets condensed from this material . His model was similar to Kant 's , except more detailed and on a smaller scale . While the Laplacian nebular model dominated in the 19th century , it encountered a number of difficulties . The main problem was angular momentum distribution between the Sun and planets . The planets have 99 % of the angular momentum , and this fact could not be explained by the nebular model . As a result , this theory of planet formation was largely abandoned at the beginning of the 20th century . 
 A major critique came during the 19th century from James Clerk Maxwell who maintained that different rotation between the inner and outer parts of a ring could not allow condensation of material . It was also rejected by astronomer Sir David Brewster who stated that " those who believe in the <unk> Theory consider it as certain that our Earth derived its solid matter and its atmosphere from a ring thrown from the Solar atmosphere , which afterwards contracted into a solid <unk> sphere , from which the Moon was thrown off by the same process . " He argued that under such view , " the Moon must necessarily have carried off water and air from the watery and aerial parts of the Earth and must have an atmosphere . " Brewster claimed that Sir Isaac Newton 's religious beliefs had previously considered nebular ideas as tending to atheism , and quoted him saying that " the growth of new systems out of old ones , without the mediation of a Divine power , seemed to him apparently absurd . " 
 The fall of the Laplacian model stimulated scientists to find a replacement for it . During the 20th century many theories were proposed including the planetesimal theory of Thomas Chamberlin and Forest Moulton ( 1901 ) , tidal model of Jeans ( 1917 ) , accretion model of Otto Schmidt ( 1944 ) , protoplanet theory of William McCrea ( 1960 ) and finally capture theory of Michael Woolfson . In 1978 Andrew Prentice resurrected the initial Laplacian ideas about planet formation and developed the modern Laplacian theory . None of these attempts was completely successful and many of the proposed theories were descriptive . 
 The birth of the modern widely accepted theory of planetary formation — the solar nebular disk model ( SNDM ) — can be traced to the Soviet astronomer Victor <unk> . His book Evolution of the protoplanetary cloud and formation of the Earth and the planets , which was translated to English in 1972 , had a long @-@ lasting effect on the way scientists think about the formation of the planets . In this book almost all major problems of the planetary formation process were formulated and some of them solved . <unk> 's ideas were further developed in the works of George Wetherill , who discovered runaway accretion . While originally applied only to the Solar System , the SNDM was subsequently thought by theorists to be at work throughout the Universe ; as of 15 July 2016 , 3 @,@ 472 extrasolar planets have since been discovered in our galaxy .

 The star formation process naturally results in the appearance of accretion disks around young stellar objects . At the age of about 1 million years , 100 % of stars may have such disks . This conclusion is supported by the discovery of the gaseous and dusty disks around protostars and T Tauri stars as well as by theoretical considerations . Observations of these disks show that the dust grains inside them grow in size on short ( thousand @-@ year ) time scales , producing 1 centimeter sized particles . 
 The accretion process , by which 1 km planetesimals grow into 1 @,@ 000 km sized bodies , is well understood now . This process develops inside any disk where the number density of planetesimals is sufficiently high , and proceeds in a runaway manner . Growth later slows and continues as oligarchic accretion . The end result is formation of planetary embryos of varying sizes , which depend on the distance from the star . Various simulations have demonstrated that the merger of embryos in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk leads to the formation of a few Earth @-@ sized bodies . Thus the origin of terrestrial planets is now considered to be an almost solved problem . 
 = = = Current issues = = = 
 The physics of accretion disks encounters some problems . The most important one is how the material , which is accreted by the protostar , loses its angular momentum . One possible explanation suggested by Hannes Alfvén was that angular momentum was shed by the solar wind during its T Tauri phase . The momentum is transported to the outer parts of the disk by viscous stresses . <unk> is generated by macroscopic turbulence , but the precise mechanism that produces this turbulence is not well understood . Another possible process for shedding angular momentum is magnetic braking , where the spin of the star is transferred into the surrounding disk via that star 's magnetic field . The main processes responsible for the disappearance of the gas in disks are viscous diffusion and photo @-@ evaporation . 
 The formation of planetesimals is the biggest unsolved problem in the nebular disk model . How 1 cm sized particles coalesce into 1 km planetesimals is a mystery . This mechanism appears to be the key to the question as to why some stars have planets , while others have nothing around them , not even dust belts . 
 The formation timescale of giant planets is also an important problem . Old theories were unable to explain how their cores could form fast enough to accumulate significant amounts of gas from the quickly disappearing protoplanetary disk . The mean lifetime of the disks , which is less than ten million ( 107 ) years , appeared to be shorter than the time necessary for the core formation . Much progress has been done to solve this problem and current models of giant planet formation are now capable of forming Jupiter ( or more massive planets ) in about 4 million years or less , well within the average lifetime of gaseous disks . 
 Another potential problem of giant planet formation is their orbital migration . Some calculations show that interaction with the disk can cause rapid inward migration , which , if not stopped , results in the planet reaching the " central regions still as a sub @-@ Jovian object . " More recent calculations indicate that disk evolution during migration can mitigate this problem .

 Stars are thought to form inside giant clouds of cold molecular hydrogen — giant molecular clouds roughly 300 @,@ 000 times the mass of the Sun ( M ☉ ) and 20 parsecs in diameter . Over millions of years , giant molecular clouds are prone to collapse and fragmentation . These fragments then form small , dense cores , which in turn collapse into stars . The cores range in mass from a fraction to several times that of the Sun and are called protostellar ( protosolar ) nebulae . They possess diameters of 0 @.@ 01 – 0 @.@ 1 pc ( 2 @,@ 000 – 20 @,@ 000 AU ) and a particle number density of roughly 10 @,@ 000 to 100 @,@ 000 cm − 3 . 
 The initial collapse of a solar @-@ mass protostellar nebula takes around 100 @,@ 000 years . Every nebula begins with a certain amount of angular momentum . Gas in the central part of the nebula , with relatively low angular momentum , undergoes fast compression and forms a hot hydrostatic ( not contracting ) core containing a small fraction of the mass of the original nebula . This core forms the seed of what will become a star . As the collapse continues , conservation of angular momentum means that the rotation of the infalling envelop accelerates , which largely prevents the gas from directly accreting onto the central core . The gas is instead forced to spread outwards near its equatorial plane , forming a disk , which in turn accretes onto the core . The core gradually grows in mass until it becomes a young hot protostar . At this stage , the protostar and its disk are heavily obscured by the infalling envelope and are not directly observable . In fact the remaining envelope 's opacity is so high that even millimeter @-@ wave radiation has trouble escaping from inside it . Such objects are observed as very bright condensations , which emit mainly millimeter @-@ wave and submillimeter @-@ wave radiation . They are classified as spectral Class 0 protostars . The collapse is often accompanied by bipolar outflows — jets — that emanate along the rotational axis of the inferred disk . The jets are frequently observed in star @-@ forming regions ( see Herbig – Haro ( HH ) objects ) . The luminosity of the Class 0 protostars is high — a solar @-@ mass protostar may radiate at up to 100 solar luminosities . The source of this energy is gravitational collapse , as their cores are not yet hot enough to begin nuclear fusion . 
 As the infall of its material onto the disk continues , the envelope eventually becomes thin and transparent and the young stellar object ( <unk> ) becomes observable , initially in far @-@ infrared light and later in the visible . Around this time the protostar begins to fuse deuterium . If the protostar is sufficiently massive ( above 80 Jupiter masses ( MJ ) ) , hydrogen fusion follows . Otherwise , if its mass is too low , the object becomes a brown dwarf . This birth of a new star occurs approximately 100 @,@ 000 years after the collapse begins . Objects at this stage are known as Class I protostars , which are also called young T Tauri stars , evolved protostars , or young stellar objects . By this time the forming star has already accreted much of its mass : the total mass of the disk and remaining envelope does not exceed 10 – 20 % of the mass of the central <unk> . 
 At the next stage the envelope completely disappears , having been gathered up by the disk , and the protostar becomes a classical T Tauri star . This happens after about 1 million years . The mass of the disk around a classical T Tauri star is about 1 – 3 % of the stellar mass , and it is accreted at a rate of 10 − 7 to 10 − 9 M ☉ per year . A pair of bipolar jets is usually present as well . The accretion explains all peculiar properties of classical T Tauri stars : strong flux in the emission lines ( up to 100 % of the intrinsic luminosity of the star ) , magnetic activity , photometric variability and jets . The emission lines actually form as the accreted gas hits the " surface " of the star , which happens around its magnetic poles . The jets are byproducts of accretion : they carry away excessive angular momentum . The classical T Tauri stage lasts about 10 million years . The disk eventually disappears due to accretion onto the central star , planet formation , ejection by jets and photoevaporation by UV @-@ radiation from the central star and nearby stars . As a result , the young star becomes a weakly lined T Tauri star , which slowly , over hundreds of millions of years , evolves into an ordinary Sun @-@ like star .

 Under certain circumstances the disk , which can now be called protoplanetary , may give birth to a planetary system . Protoplanetary disks have been observed around a very high fraction of stars in young star clusters . They exist from the beginning of a star 's formation , but at the earliest stages are unobservable due to the opacity of the surrounding envelope . The disk of a Class 0 protostar is thought to be massive and hot . It is an accretion disk , which feeds the central protostar . The temperature can easily exceed 400 K inside 5 AU and 1 @,@ 000 K inside 1 AU . The heating of the disk is primarily caused by the viscous dissipation of turbulence in it and by the infall of the gas from the nebula . The high temperature in the inner disk causes most of the volatile material — water , organics , and some rocks to evaporate , leaving only the most refractory elements like iron . The ice can survive only in the outer part of the disk . 
 The main problem in the physics of accretion disks is the generation of turbulence and the mechanism responsible for the high effective viscosity . The turbulent viscosity is thought to be responsible for the transport of the mass to the central protostar and momentum to the periphery of the disk . This is vital for accretion , because the gas can be accreted by the central protostar only if it loses most of its angular momentum , which must be carried away by the small part of the gas drifting outwards . The result of this process is the growth of both the protostar and of the disk radius , which can reach 1 @,@ 000 AU if the initial angular momentum of the nebula is large enough . Large disks are routinely observed in many star @-@ forming regions such as the Orion nebula . 
 The lifespan of the accretion disks is about 10 million years . By the time the star reaches the classical T @-@ Tauri stage , the disk becomes thinner and cools . Less volatile materials start to condense close to its center , forming 0 @.@ 1 – 1 μm dust grains that contain crystalline silicates . The transport of the material from the outer disk can mix these newly formed dust grains with primordial ones , which contain organic matter and other volatiles . This mixing can explain some peculiarities in the composition of Solar System bodies such as the presence of interstellar grains in the primitive meteorites and refractory inclusions in comets .
