A professional pianist , Eguchi often utilizes the piano in his compositions . He has stated that most of the time he composes and arranges music is at his home studio , where his friends help out by recording acoustic instruments ; if the quality of these recordings are not adequate , however , Eguchi replaces them at the company 's studio . He has said that by the time he is finished creating the music , he is only sleeping three to four hours a week . 
 Since joining Sega Digital Studio in 2006 , Eguchi has switched over to almost an exclusively orchestral style . On recent projects , he has assisted his fellow co @-@ workers with string and keyboard arrangements , in addition to writing his own material . 
 He cites Igor Stravinsky , Ryuichi Sakamoto , and Miles Davis as musical influences .

 Faisalabad ( pronunciation : / <unk> / ; Lyallpur until 1979 ) , is the third most populous city in Pakistan , and the second largest in the eastern province of Punjab . Historically one of the first planned cities within British India , it has long since developed into a cosmopolitan metropolis . Faisalabad was restructured into City District status ; a devolution promulgated by the 2001 Local Government Ordinance ( <unk> ) . The total area of Faisalabad District is 58 @.@ 56 km2 ( 22 @.@ 61 sq mi ) while the area controlled by the Faisalabad Development Authority ( FDA ) is 1 @,@ 280 km2 ( 490 sq mi ) . Faisalabad has grown to become a major industrial and distribution centre because of its central location in the region and connecting roads , rails , and air transportation . It has been referred to as the " Manchester of Pakistan " because it contributes over 20 % toward Pakistan 's annual GDP . Faisalabad 's average annual GDP is $ 20 @.@ 55 billion ( USD ) , of which 21 % comes from agriculture . 
 The surrounding countryside , irrigated by the lower Chenab River , produces cotton , wheat , sugarcane , vegetables and fruits . The city is an industrial centre with major railway repair yards , engineering works , and mills that process sugar , flour , and oil seed . Faisalabad is a major producer of <unk> , cotton and silk textiles , hosiery , dyes , industrial chemicals , beverages , clothing , pulp and paper , printing , agricultural equipment , and ghee ( clarified butter ) . The Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry monitors industrial activity in the city and reports their findings to the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry and provincial government . The city also has a major dry port and international airport . 
 Faisalabad is home to the University of Agriculture , Government College University as well as the Ayub Agricultural Research Institute , Divisional Public School Faisalabad and National Textile University . The city has its own cricket team , Faisalabad Wolves , which is based at the Iqbal Stadium . There are several other sports teams that compete internationally , including hockey and snooker as well as other sporting events . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Toponymy = = = 
 Faisalabad district actually began as Lyallpur district in 1904 and prior to that , was a tehsil of Jhang district . During the British Raj , the city Lyallpur was named in honour of the then Lieutenant @-@ Governor of Punjab , Sir James Broadwood Lyall , for his services in the colonisation of the lower Chenab Valley . His surname Lyall was joined with " pur " which in old Sanskrit language means city . In the late 1970s , the Government of Pakistan changed the name of the city from Lyallpur to Faisalabad ( meaning City of Faisal ) , in honour of King Faisal of Saudi Arabia , who made several financial contributions to Pakistan . 
 = = = Early settlements = = = 
 According to the University of Faisalabad , the city of Faisalabad traces its origins to the 18th century when the land was inhabited by a number of forest @-@ dwelling tribes . It is believed these early settlements belonged to the ancient districts of Jhang and <unk> , which included the area between Shahdara to <unk> and <unk> Hill to Toba Tek Singh . 
 = = = Colonial rule = = = 
 By the mid @-@ 18th century , the economic and administrative collapse of provinces within the Mughal Empire , from Punjab to Bengal , led to its dissolution . Internal unrest resulted in multiple battles for independence and further deterioration of the region , which then led to formal <unk> as established by the Government of India Act 1858 , with direct control under the British Raj from 1858 to 1947 . In 1880 , <unk> Young CIE , a British colonial officer , proposed construction of a new strategic town within the area . His proposal was supported by Sir James Broadwood Lyall and the city of Lyall was developed . Historically , Faisalabad , ( Lyallpur until 1979 ) , became one of the first planned cities within British India . 
 Young designed the city centre to replicate the design in the Union Jack with eight roads extending from a large clock tower at its epicentre ; a design geometrically symbolic of the Cross of Saint Andrew <unk> with the Cross of Saint Patrick , and Saint George 's Cross over all . The eight roads developed into eight separate bazaars ( markets ) leading to different regions of the Punjab . In 1892 , the newly constructed town with its growing agricultural surplus was added to the British rail network . Construction of the rail link between <unk> and Lyallpur was completed in 1895 . In 1896 , Gujranwala , Jhang and Sahiwal comprising the <unk> of Lyallpur were under the administrative control of the Jhang District . 
 In 1904 , the new district of Lyallpur was formed to include the tehsils of <unk> and Toba Tek Singh with a sub @-@ tehsil at <unk> , which later became a full tehsil in itself . The University of Agriculture , originally the Punjab Agricultural College and Research Institute , Lyallpur , was established in 1906 . The Town Committee was upgraded to a Municipal Committee in 1909 . Lyallpur grew into an established agricultural tool and grain centre . The 1930s brought industrial growth and market expansion to the textile industry as well as to food processing , grain crushing and chemicals . 
 = = = Independence = = = 
 In August 1947 , following three decades of nationalist struggles , India and Pakistan achieved independence . The British agreed to partition colonial India into two sovereign states – Pakistan with a Muslim majority , and India with a Hindu majority ; however , more Muslims remained in India than what governing authorities believed would assimilate into Pakistan . The partitioning led to a mass migration of an estimated 10 million people which made it the largest mass migration in human history . India 's Bengal province was divided into East Pakistan and West Bengal ( India ) , and the Punjab Province was divided into Punjab ( West Pakistan ) and Punjab , India . There were also respective divisions of the British Indian Army , the Indian Civil Service , various administrative services , the central treasury , and the railways . Riots and local fighting followed the expeditious withdrawal of the British , resulting in an estimated one million civilians deaths , particularly in the western region of Punjab . Lyallpur , which was located in the region of the Punjab Province that became West Pakistan , was populated by a number of Hindus and Sikhs who migrated to India , while Muslim refugees from India settled in the district . 
 In 1977 , Pakistani authorities changed the name of the city to " Faisalabad " to honour the close relationship of King Faisal of Saudi Arabia with Pakistan . During the eighties , the city realised an increase in foreign investment . More <unk> began working abroad as bilateral ties improved within the new dominion . This led to more monetary funds returning to the city that aided the development of the region . In 1985 , the city was upgraded as a division with the districts of Faisalabad , Jhang and Toba Tek Singh .

 = = = Geology = = = 
 The district of Faisalabad is part of the alluvial plains between the Himalayan foothills and the central core of the Indian subcontinent . The alluvial deposits are typically over a thousand feet thick . The <unk> are believed to have been formed during the Late Pleistocene and feature river terraces . These were later identified as old and young floodplains of the Ravi River on the <unk> and Chenab Plains . The old floodplains consist of Holocene deposits from the Ravi and Chenab rivers . 
 The soil consists of young stratified silt loam or very fine sand loam which makes the subsoil weak in structure with common <unk> at only five feet . The course of the rivers within Faisalabad are winding and often subject to frequent alternations . In the rainy season , the currents are very strong . This leads to high floods in certain areas which do last for a number of days . The <unk> and <unk> canals have encouraged the water levels in the district however the belt on the Ravi River has remained narrow . The river bed does include the river channels which have shifted the sand bars and low sandy levees leading to river erosion . 
 Faisalabad is situated at the centre of the lower <unk> Doab , the area is located between the Chenab and Ravi rivers . There is a mild slope from the northeast to the southwest with an average fall of 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 3 metres per kilometre ( 1 @.@ 1 – 1 @.@ 6 feet per mile ) .

 Faisalabad was established as one of the first planned towns of British India covering an area of 3 square kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 sq mi ) . It was initially designed to accommodate 20 @,@ 000 people . The city 's population increased from 69 @,@ 930 in 1941 to 179 @,@ 000 in 1951 ( 152 @.@ 2 % increase ) .

 The province of Punjab , in which Faisalabad is the second largest city , has prevalent sociocultural distinctions . Population sizes vary by district but some distinguishing factors include a young age structure , high age dependency ratio , a higher percentage of males , a higher proportion of married population , and heterogeneity in castes and languages . 
 Islam is the common heritage in the region with a 97 @.@ 22 % Muslim majority according to the 1998 Pakistan census report and 2001 population data sheet . Islamic influences are evident in the fundamental values of various inhabitants including cultural traditions , marriage , education , diet , ceremonies and policies with may reflect stark differences in rural villages as compared to urban areas . People live in tight @-@ knit joint families , although a nuclear family system is also emerging due to changing socio @-@ economic conditions . Ancient Pakistani culture prevails in most marriage practices in the region , as do certain restrictions related to ethnicity and caste . However , the influences of more modern societies have effected some change , particularly in the area of the dowry system . As of 2016 , monogamous and polygamous unions remain an acceptable marriage practice . In following ancient culture , marriages are customarily arranged by the parents or matchmakers . In some instances , the husband must buy his wife from her parents . Marriage ceremonies , which can be more or less formal , include rituals which are universal in nature and hold sociological importance . Studies conducted in 2007 and 2013 , the latter in an outlying rural village in Faisalabad District , acknowledged the existence of gender bias and discrimination against females , stating that " Gender discrimination is not a new phenomenon " , and that it still exists in the modern world . It was further noted that situations may be worse in villages because " whenever a girl is born , nobody celebrates her birth , whereas when a boy is born , it means great joy and celebration . " 
 Social change in the region has been a slow process but there are indications that change has occurred as more villages are exposed to various forms of media and modernized urban communities . It is further noted that there has been a " conscious and persistent effort " to educate rural and urban societies about gender bias and equality . In early 2014 , there was a march known as the " White Ribbon Campaign " which took place in front of the Faisalabad Press Club . Protestors appealed to the government to adopt new laws " to protect women who are discriminated against in the family and workplace . " 
 <unk> minorities , particularly Hindu and Christian , feel a sense of vulnerability because of their religious beliefs . Labourers and farmhands comprise the countless Christian villages throughout Punjab ; many are descendants of people who converted from Hinduism to Christianity under the British Raj , and considered low caste by virtue of their birth . A small population of wealthy , well @-@ educated Christians have settled in Karachi ; however , as a result of increasing Islamization , religious intolerance in Pakistani society , <unk> laws and Islamist militancy , most have left Pakistan to settle in other countries where there is more religious tolerance , such as Canada and Australia .

Men have also adopted some of the modern Western styles for both casual and formal business dress such as dress pants , trousers , T @-@ shirts and jeans . 
 Faisalabad Institute of Textile and Fashion Design at the Government College University ( Faisalabad ) teaches Fashion Design as part of their Fine Arts program . Some of the more conservative establishments and universities follow strict dress codes , such as the National Textile University in Faisalabad where a notice was issued on 27 April 2016 by university professor Muhammad Ashfaq . The intent of the notice was to " promote a positive image of the NTU and to maintain good moral , religious and cultural values among the faculty , staff and students . " The dress code bans certain styles of Western attire including shorts , sleeveless shirts and shawls for men . Women are prohibited from wearing jeans , tights or leggings , sleeveless or half @-@ sleeved shirts for women . Women are also prohibited from wearing heavy make @-@ up and expensive jewellery . 
 = = = Cuisine = = = 
 <unk> cuisine is very much Punjabi cuisine , with influences from the realms of the Mughal and Colonial empires . Key ingredients include rice or roti ( flatbread ) served with a vegetable or non @-@ vegetable curry , a salad consisting of spiced tomatoes and onions , and yogurt . This is usually accompanied by a variety of South Asian sweets such as jaggery , <unk> ka halwa , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> . Tandoori barbecue specialties consist of a variety of naan bread served with tandoori chicken , chicken tikka or lamb <unk> served with a mint chutney . 
 Street foods are a key element to <unk> cuisine . <unk> ( deep fried pastry filled with vegetables or meat ) topped with an onion salad and two types of chutney . There is even a square dedicated to them in the old city . Other street foods include , dahi <unk> ( deep fried <unk> in creamy yoghurt ) , gol <unk> ( fried round puri filled with vegetables and topped with tamarind chutney ) and vegetable or chicken <unk> . Biryani and <unk> <unk> rice are also a speciality in Faisalabad . 
 A typical breakfast in <unk> is halwa <unk> comprising a deep fried flatbread served with a spicy chickpea curry and sweet orange coloured halwa . It is customarily accompanied by a sweet or salty yoghurt based drink called lassi . During winter , a common breakfast is <unk> naan bread served with <unk> curry . 
 Specialty drinks vary depending on climate . During winter , a variety of hot drinks are available , such as <unk> <unk> , a creamy dessert drink commonly made with full @-@ fat milk , almonds , pistachios and basil seeds , <unk> <unk> ( milky tea ) , and Kashmiri chai , a pink coloured milky tea containing almonds and pistachios . During summer , drinks such as sugar cane <unk> , limo pani ( iced lemon water ) , <unk> ( iced orange and black pepper ) and lassi are common . 
 There are also American @-@ style fast food franchises that cater to the local community such as McDonald ’ s , Fried Chicken ( KFC ) , and Pizza Hut . 
 = = = Literacy = = = 
 According to a report by the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organisation ( UNESCO ) , the 2015 literacy rate for Pakistan ranked 160th which is among the lowest literacy rates in the world . 
 In 1981 , Faisalabad was among four districts in Punjab , which also included Gujranwala , Jhelum and Gujrat , that were experiencing low literacy rates , due primarily to either a lack of resources or family pressure ; the latter of which may also be attributable to illiteracy . In 1998 , Faisalabad progressed to a higher literacy rate with the most improvement realised at the primary school level . In 2008 , Faisalabad District ranked 51 @.@ 9 % which placed the district 9th in literacy out of the 34 Punjab districts . 
 In 2014 , the city held its first literary festival which brought a number of writers to the city to encourage the community to follow the arts .

 = Early thermal weapons = 
 Early thermal weapons were devices or substances used in warfare during the classical and medieval periods ( approx 8th century BC until the mid @-@ 16th century AD ) which used heat or burning action to destroy or damage enemy personnel , fortifications or territories . 
 Incendiary devices were frequently used as projectiles during warfare , particularly during sieges and naval battles ; some substances were boiled or heated to inflict damage by scalding or burning . Other substances relied on their chemical properties to inflict burns or damage . These weapons or devices could be used by individuals , manipulated by war machines , or utilised as army strategy . 
 The simplest and most common thermal projectiles were boiling water and hot sand , which could be poured over attacking personnel . Other anti @-@ personnel weapons included the use of hot pitch , oil , resin , animal fat and other similar compounds . Smoke was used to confuse or drive off attackers . Substances such as quicklime and sulfur could be toxic and blinding . 
 Fire and incendiary weapons were used against enemy structures and territory , as well as personnel , sometimes on a massive scale . Large tracts of land , towns and villages were frequently destroyed as part of a scorched earth strategy . Incendiary mixtures , such as the oil @-@ based Greek fire , could be launched by throwing machines or administered through a siphon . <unk> and oil @-@ soaked materials were sometimes ignited and thrown at the enemy , or attached to spears , arrows and bolts and fired by hand or machine . Some siege techniques — such as mining and boring — relied on combustibles and fire to complete the collapse of walls and structures . 
 Towards the latter part of the period , gunpowder was invented , which increased the sophistication of the weapons , and led to the eventual development of the cannon and other firearms . Development of the early weapons has continued ever since , with modern war weapons such as napalm , flame throwers , and other explosives having direct roots in the original early thermal weapons . Fire @-@ raising and other destructive strategies can still be seen in modern strategic bombing . 
 = = " Fire and sword " = = 
 The destruction of enemy possessions and territory was a fundamental strategy of war , serving the dual purpose of punishment and deprivation of resources . Until the 5th century BC , the Greeks had little expertise in siege warfare and relied on a strategy of devastation to draw the enemy out ; they destroyed crops , trees and houses . Centuries later , the Byzantines recommended this strategy , even though they had developed siege technology . 
 Fire was the easiest way of harrying and destroying territories , and could be done easily and quickly by small forces . It was a strategy put to good use by the Scots during the Wars of Independence ; they repeatedly launched raids into northern England , burning much of the countryside until the whole region was transformed . King Edward II of England pursued one raiding party in 1327 by following the lights of burning villages . 
 The tactics were replicated by England during the Hundred Years ' War ; fire became their chief weapon as they laid waste to the French countryside during lightning raids called chevauchées , in a form of economic warfare . One estimate records the destruction of over 2000 villages and castles during one raid in 1339 . 
 As well as causing the destruction of lands , foods and belongings , fire could also be used to divert manpower . 13th century Mongol armies regularly sent out small detachments from their main forces to start grass fires and fire settlements as diversions . 
 Devastation by fire was not only used as an offensive tactic ; some countries and armies employed ' scorched earth ' policies on their own land to deprive invading armies of all food and forage . Robert I of Scotland reacted to the English invasion of 1322 by launching punitive and diversionary chevauchées into north @-@ west England , then retreating to Culross , burning as he went the Scottish lands which lay in the path of the English army . The English ran out of food and had to abandon the campaign . Kitchener employed scorched earth tactics to subdue Boer forces in South Africa when three years of warfare had resulted in a stalemate . 
 Such acts of aggression were not limited to wars against territorial enemies , but could form part of the strategies of conquest , subjugation and punishment of rebellion . Alexander the Great suppressed a revolt in Thebes , Greece in 335 BC , after which he ordered the city to be torched and laid waste . Alexander ordered ( or allowed ) a similar arson at Persepolis in 330 BC . It was a policy which was repeated throughout the period . William I of England , following his conquest of England in the 11th century , asserted his control of Northumbria by destructive campaigns throughout the region : " He ordered that crops and herds , tools and food should be burned to ashes . More than 100 @,@ 000 people perished of hunger " , reported Orderic Vitalis , a contemporary chronicler . It was a scene repeated the following century , during the anarchy of Stephen of England 's reign . Civil war erupted between Stephen 's supporters and those of the Empress Matilda , a rival claimant for the throne . The Gesta Stephani tells of the deeds of one of Stephen 's supporters , Philip of Gloucester , by describing how he " raged in all directions with fire and sword , violence and plunder " , reducing territory to " bare fields and dreadful desert " . 
 = = Techniques of use = = 
 At the simplest level , fire itself was used as a weapon to cause large @-@ scale destruction , or to target specific enemy positions or machinery . It was frequently used against siege engines and wooden structures . Incendiary weapons could be used to set fire to towns and fortifications , and a wide range of thermal weapons were used against enemy personnel . Some armies developed specialised " fire @-@ troops " . By 837 , many Muslim armies had groups of " <unk> " ( fire archers ) , and when the Mamluk Sultanate raised a fleet for an attack on Cyprus they had " <unk> " , or <unk> . 
 = = = Simple fire @-@ raising = = = 
 The burning of enemy positions and equipment was not necessarily a complicated procedure , and many fires were set by individuals using common materials . When William of Normandy 's army besieged Mayenne in 1063 , they shot fire into the castle to panic the garrison , while two boys stole into the castle in order to start a fire within . The garrison surrendered . 
 Besieged forces would sometimes launch sorties in an attempt to fire the attackers ' camps or equipment . When Hugh Capet besieged Laon in 986 – 987 , his troops became drunk one night , and Duke Charles 's men sallied forth and torched the camp , forcing Hugh to abandon the siege . 
 The besieged were not the only ones who might fire siege equipment ; when Frederick I Barbarossa abandoned his siege of Alessandria in 1175 , he burned his own camp and equipment . 
 However , like all weapons , fire @-@ raising had its own dangers . In 651 Penda of Mercia attempted to win Bamburgh Castle by building a pyre at its base from planks , beams , wattle and thatch . The wind changed direction and the fire blew back on Penda 's men , who had to abandon the attack . This fortuitous wind @-@ change was credited to Saint Aidan , who saw the smoke from the Farne Islands and prayed for the defenders . 
 = = = Throwing machines = = = 
 Various throwing machines were in use throughout the classical and medieval periods . Generally referred to as " artillery " , these engines could hurl , fire or shoot missiles and most could be used or adapted for throwing thermal weapons , by attacking and defending forces . Barrels , fire pots and other breakable containers of pitch , Greek fire , and other incendiary mixtures could be thrown ; other machines fired arrows and bolts , which could be ignited , or adapted to carry flammable mixtures . From the 12th century , Muslims in Syria were using clay and glass grenades for fire weapons , thrown by machines . 
 Most of the terms used for throwing machines were vague , and could refer to different engines , all of which went through changes and developments over the period . Among the most common were the ballista , mangonel and trebuchet . The ballista was similar in form to a crossbow , though much larger , and used a string @-@ winding mechanism to fire a missile or bolt placed in a groove . Other giant crossbows were used throughout the period , and an " <unk> " , based on the ballista , which threw large bolts , was developed in the 13th century . <unk> @-@ powered arrow firers had been used from 400 BC , and were adapted for stones . A mangonel had a wooden spoon @-@ shaped arm , to hold a stone or other projectile , which was manipulated under tension from a twisted rope . The trebuchet was an advanced development of the 12th or 13th century , which used a counter @-@ weight to power the throwing arm , and was the major siege engine until the cannon became widespread . 
 = = = In mining = = = 
 Forces attacking a castle of other strong fortification sometimes sought to undermine the foundations by digging " mines " or tunnels underneath them . Usually , such mining or digging machinery was protected by a tortoise ( also called a cat , sow , or owl ) : a covered shed on wheels , which shielded the miners from missile attack . 
 As the tunnels were constructed , they were generally supported by wooden beams and posts . Once the mine had been finished , the internal space was filled with combustibles , such as brushwood , firewood , resin , and other incendiary substances ; once ignited , these would burn the supporting props , causing the mine to collapse , bringing down with it the structures lying above . From the 15th century , gunpowder was also used , although the aim remained to burn the props . 
 Defenders might sometimes dig counter @-@ tunnels in order to reach the enemy 's mines and launch an attack ; frequently thermal weapons were used to drive the besiegers from the tunnels . 
 Rather than undermining a structure , some besiegers used borers to drill holes in the outer walls in an effort to destroy them ; such methods were more effective than rams on brick walls ( which tended to absorb the shocks from the ram ) . <unk> differed in size and mechanism , but a typical machine was made from a log of wood , tipped with iron and supported and driven by <unk> or ropes . Once a series of holes had been bored along the length of a wall , the holes were typically filled with rods of dry wood , saturated with sulfur or pitch and then ignited . Bellows could be used to encourage a blaze . 
 = = = Fire ships = = = 
 Fire ships were used on several occasions throughout the period . In 332 BC Alexander the Great laid siege to Tyre , a coastal base of the Phoenicians . In order to bring his siege engines within range , Alexander ordered the construction of moles . The <unk> responded by attacking the first mole with a large fireship , which destroyed it . A large horse transport ship was packed with cedar torches , pitch , dried brush and other combustibles ; above this were suspended cauldrons of sulfur , bitumen and " every sort of material apt to kindle and nourish flame " . This was towed to the mole , and lit by the Phoenicians before they jumped overboard and swam away . 
 Another example occurred during the 886 Siege of Paris , when the Vikings filled three warships with combustible material and pulled them upriver in a failed attempt to destroy the Franks ' fortified bridges . Fire ships containing straw and powder were also used during the Chinese Battle of Lake Poyang in 1363 . 
 = = = Other methods = = = 
 Often ingenious methods were developed for administering the weapons . The 10th @-@ century Olga of Kiev is reported to have tied burning tinder to birds which , when released , flew back to their nests in the hostile town and set them alight . Siege towers and ladders could be fitted with a long , narrow tilting beam at the top , gouged with a groove , so that hot oil and water could be poured down on the enemy defenders during an escalade . 
 During an attack , castle or fortification defenders could launch or pour the substances on the heads of attackers below . This could be done over the battlements , but also through purpose @-@ built holes such as machicolations and murder @-@ holes . Indian records suggest smoke and fire was used defensively within a fortress to confuse and disorient attackers ; iron grills could also be heated and used to block passageways . During night attacks , defenders could drop lighted bundles over the walls so the enemy could be seen ; Chinese and Muslim sources also describe the light gained by torches hung on the walls . 
 = = = Use against stone castles = = = 
 Stone castles were susceptible to fire , since they contained many combustible materials . In 1139 , Henry de Tracy forced the surrender of Torrington Castle by the simple expedient of tossing lighted torches through the keep 's loopholes . 
 Stone was also susceptible to intense heat , which would cause it to crack and collapse . Byzantine sources recorded the demolition of stone structures caused by placing clay pots of burning charcoal at the base of walls moistened with vinegar or urine , and the 6th century treatise by an engineer in Justinian 's army includes the lighting fires beneath the walls amongst its instructions for sieges . 
 Stone castles sometimes offered other inflammatory targets . During the Crusades , Muslim defenders frequently hung bundles of straw against their walls as buffers against stones and rams ; in turn , the Crusader archers would set these alight with fire arrows . 
 = = = Defence against thermal attack = = = 
 Defence from thermal weapons and fire attacks was usually water or other liquids such as urine ; hides were soaked and draped over vulnerable wooden hoardings and siege engines , and vats and barrels of liquid were collected and stored by defenders and attackers . Hides were hung in an overlapping manner so that any water would run down the whole structure to extinguish flames . Some thermal weapons ( such as quicklime or oil ) could not be extinguished or eased by water , in which case sand or earth could be used . Wooden structures were frequently soaked in alum to increase their fire resistance . The Romans covered their tortoises ( mobile siege sheds ) with raw hides packed with vinegar @-@ soaked seaweed or chaff , to serve as protection against regular and incendiary missiles . Throughout the period , sacks or nets might be filled with vinegar @-@ moistened chaff , seaweed or wet moss and hung on the exterior . The wooden siege engines of the Crusaders were vulnerable to attack from the Byzantine and Muslim fire @-@ weapons , so the troops inside siege towers kept stores of water and vinegar . 
 During the High Middle Ages , the majority of Poland 's castles were still made of wood , so uncut stone was frequently added to the front to improve their fire defences . 
 Both attackers and defenders needed to be prepared for incendiary and thermal attack . When the Athenians besieged Syracuse in 416 BC they lost many siege engines to fire . The Syracusan ruler Dionysius I must have taken note of this success , for when he laid siege to <unk> in 398 BC he organised special fire " brigades " , who successfully doused the fires when his siege engines were bombarded . 
 During the First English Civil War , incendiary devices were used to raze city centers . Defenders in London were advised to combat the flames using milk , sand , earth , and urine . In Colchester , fires caused by hand grenades ( the weapon was called " wildfire " by the combatants ) were extinguished using wet clothes saturated in milk and vinegar . 
 = = Types of weapons = = 
 = = = Flaming arrows , bolts , spears and rockets = = = 
 Lit torches ( burning sticks ) were likely the earliest form of incendiary device . They were followed by incendiary arrows , which were used throughout the ancient and medieval periods . The simplest flaming arrows had <unk> or resin @-@ soaked tows tied just below the arrowhead and were effective against wooden structures . Both the Assyrians and the Judeans used fire arrows at the siege of Lachish in 701 BC . More sophisticated devices were developed by the Romans which had iron boxes and tubes which were filled with incendiary substances and attached to arrows or spears . These arrows needed to be shot from loose bows , since swift flight extinguished the flame ; spears could be launched by hand or throwing machine . 
 Flaming arrows and crossbow bolts were used throughout the period . Fifteenth @-@ century writer <unk> Diaz de <unk> witnessed a Spanish attack on the Moorish town of Oran in 1404 and later described how " During the most part of the night , the galleys did not cease from firing bolts and <unk> dipped in tar into the town , which is near the sea . The noise and the cries which came from the town were very great by reason of the havoc that was wrought . " 
 Anna Komnene records that at the 1091 Battle of Levounion , lighted torches were fixed to spears . 
 The Chinese Song Dynasty created fire arrows - rockets attached to arrows and launched in mass through platforms , and later created rockets such as the huo long chu shui , a multistage rocket used in naval combat . Primitive rockets made from bamboo and leather were used by the Mongols , under Genghis Khan , but were inaccurate . However , the <unk> used " Chinese arrows " from the 11th Century , which probably included saltpetre . The Mamluks experimented with a rocket @-@ powered weapon described as " an egg which moves itself and burns . " 
 A 2 @-@ metre @-@ long ( 2 @.@ 2 yd ) iron crossbow @-@ bolt probably designed to carry a fire cartridge was found in a 13th @-@ 14th @-@ century castle in Vladimir , Eastern Russia . Such large machine @-@ thrown bolts were ideal for incendiary weapons . The Mongols used an " ox @-@ bow " machine to throw bolts which had been dipped in burning pitch , with a range of 2500 paces . 
 During the British Civil Wars ( mid @-@ 17th century in Great Britain ) , both the Parliamentarian and Royalist armies used various incendiary devices to attack enemies and destroy property that might be used for military purposes , according to historian Stephen Porter in Destruction in the English Civil Wars . The flaming arrow attack was used to set fire to buildings at a distance . An arrow with a flammable substance attached to the shaft , close to the tip , was shot from a bow or short @-@ muzzled musket . Such arrows shot from a musket had their feathers removed , to fit inside the muzzle , and were called fire @-@ darts . These devices were cheap to make and easy to prepare . Although used infrequently during the wars , the flaming arrows and darts proved to be destructive . The Royalists shot flaming arrows into the thatched homes in the suburbs of Chester causing extensive damage . Lyme Regis was partly razed using flaming arrows . 
 = = = Greek fire = = = 
 Greek fire was one of the most effective thermal devices , although it was extremely dangerous for the users . A combustible liquid , it could be shot from siphons or catapults , and it burst into flames on impact . First developed by the Byzantines in the 7th century , it was later used by the Turks during the Crusades , and was probably first used in Western Europe in the 12th century . Early experiments by the Byzantines in the 6th century used a mixture of sulfur and oil , which would have been terrifying if not destructive . Various versions seem to have existed , and the recipes were frequently kept secret ; experts today still debate the exact composition , although some recipes are known . It probably had regional variations ; the Islamic derivative was known as " naft " and had a petroleum base , with sulfur ; the Persian word for " petroleum " is <unk> ( naft ) . 
 The combustible liquid could be shot from catapults , and would burst into flames on impact . <unk> , frequently of copper , were also developed , first appearing in the 10th and 11th centuries . The siphons could shoot a blazing stream , which a 10th @-@ century Mesopotamian source claimed could engulf twelve men . Mardi bin Ali al @-@ <unk> , who wrote a military manual for Saladin in the 12th century , suggested that " naft " could be placed inside blown eggshells , which could be thrown from horseback . From the 12th century , mouth @-@ blown tubes were developed for use in mines . 
 Similar petroleum and bitumen @-@ based incendiary mixtures had been known for centuries before the invention of Greek fire , but this new recipe created a blaze which was extremely difficult to extinguish . It burned on water , and was used effectively in naval warfare , although it was primarily an anti @-@ personnel weapon rather than a ship @-@ burner . It remained effective at sea even after its use had declined on land after the 13th century . 
 The Greek fire recipes continued to be developed over the centuries , and by the High Middle Ages was much more sophisticated than the early versions . Saltpetre ( also called " Chinese salt " ) was added to the mixture in the Islamic world , and China developed a dry saltpetre mixture in the 12th century , which eventually became gunpowder . Both the Parliamentarian and Royalist armies used Greek @-@ fire @-@ like petroleum @-@ based incendiary devices known as " wildfire " during the British Civil Wars . 
 = = = Hot oil = = = 
 Oil of various kinds could be heated to high temperatures and poured over an enemy , although , since it was extremely expensive , its use was limited , both in frequency and quantity . Moreover , it could be dangerous and volatile . Since the smoke point of oil is lower than its boiling point , the oil was only heated and not boiled . 
 Pouring @-@ oil was used in historic battles , and Josephus described its use at <unk> in AD 67 , saying " the oil did easily run down the whole body from head to foot , under their entire armour , and fed upon their flesh like flame itself . " 
 Oil was usually used to create incendiary devices . The Roman @-@ Byzantine armies of the 6th century created " fire @-@ pots " , oil @-@ based incendiary weapons which could be launched by hand or with ballistae . During the siege at Montreuil @-@ en @-@ Bellay in 1147 , a mixture of oils from nuts , cannabis and flax , was heated in iron containers , launched by mangonel , and burst into flames on impact . The Chinese made early grenades out of oil @-@ soaked hemp and cotton , which were ignited and thrown by mangonels . 
 Another use of oil can be seen in the naval battle of La Rochelle during the Hundred Years ' War ; the Castilians sprayed oil on the decks of English ships then ignited it by shooting flaming arrows down . 
 = = = Water , sand and other heated missiles = = = 
 Hot oil was considerably less common than boiling water or heated sand , which were cheap and extremely effective ; even " dust from the street " could be used . These would penetrate armour and cause terrible burns . Sand , especially , could work its way through very small gaps in armour . The Phoenicians at the Siege of Tyre ( 332 BC ) dropped burning sand down on the attacking Greeks , which got in behind the armour and burned the flesh . 
 Such heated missiles have also been used in mining situations ; the 1st century Roman writer Vitruvius describes a counter @-@ mine dug above the attackers ' gallery by defenders at the siege of Apollonia . Piercing the floor between the mines , the Apollonian defenders poured down boiling water , hot sand and hot pitch onto the heads of their enemy . Other mixtures were more innovative ; the defenders at Chester in 918 boiled a mixture of water and ale in copper tubs and poured it over the Viking besiegers , causing their skin to peel off . 
 When Frederick I <unk> besieged Crema , Italy in the 12th century , the defenders threw red @-@ hot iron objects down on them . 
 = = = Pitch , tar and resin = = = 
 Burning pitch was used on occasion ; the Mongols were known to fire containers of burning tar during sieges using catapults and trebuchets . Wheels could be covered in pitch , set alight , and rolled along ; this technique was commonly used during the Crusades . The besieged Carthaginians in <unk> , 398 BC , set alight the siege engines of the attacking Syracusan forces under Dionysius I by dropping burning charred logs and resin @-@ soaked oakum ; however , the Syracusans were able to put out the fires . 
 Pitch was a base ingredient in many incendiary devices throughout the period . The Boeotians developed a fire machine , which they used against the Athenian wooden fortifications during the Battle of Delium in 424 BC . A cauldron of burning coals , pitch and sulfur was suspended at one end of a hollowed @-@ out log and bellows were fixed to the other end . A similar mixture was used 1700 years later by the Scots , when they dropped bales of wood , tar and sulfur by crane onto the English " sow " ( a large protective shield covering the battering ram ) at the 1319 siege of Berwick @-@ upon @-@ Tweed .

 At the 1215 siege of Rochester Castle , King John ordered that fat from 40 pigs be used to set fire to the mines beneath the keep , which caused it to collapse , a cheap and effective technique in place of the more complicated mixture of sulfur , tallow , gum , pitch and quicksilver he had used in France the previous year . Animal fat was not uncommon as an accelerant ; in the 13th century French sortie @-@ parties would often be equipped with animal fat , straw and flax to use as fuel when setting fires amongst enemy siege engines . 
 There were some other intriguing uses of animal parts ; during the Siege of Paris in 886 AD , the Franks dropped bucket @-@ loads of a hot mixture of pitch ( or oil ) , wax and fish on the attacking Vikings ; the mixture got under the armour and stuck to the skin . Konrad <unk> 's <unk> of 1405 describes a poisonous mixture of sulfur , tar and horses ' hooves . Other incendiary ingredients included egg yolks , and pigeon and sheep droppings . 
 Some documented uses of animals were not thermal or incendiary . Live insects were also used , to sting the enemy . 4th century BC writer Aeneas <unk> suggested defenders should let wasps and bees into enemy mines , and jars of scorpions were sometimes fired during early bombardment in naval battles . In 189 BC <unk> was besieged by the Romans , who dug mines under the walls . The defenders filled a clay jar with chicken feathers , which they then lit , using bellows to blow the acrid smoke down the tunnel ; unable to approach the pot due to defensive spears , the Romans were forced to abandon their works . 
 = = = <unk> , sulfur and smoke = = = 
 The 15th @-@ century engineer <unk> recommended quicklime , although its use went back to ancient times , and might well have been a component of Greek fire . <unk> reacts violently with water , and can cause blindness and burns . While quicklime was used in some naval battles , it does not appear to have been standard issue on board ships , due to the danger of the quicklime blowing back and burning the user . 
 Other substances smoked rather than flamed . Sacks of burning sulfur were effective at clearing enemy mines due to the toxic smoke produced . Any smoke could be used in small confines ; the Greek military writer Aeneas <unk> recommended burning wood and straw to drive out enemy sappers by the smoke . 
 = = Gunpowder and cannon = = 
 The discovery of gunpowder was probably the product of centuries of alchemical experimentation . Saltpetre was known to the Chinese by the mid @-@ 1st century AD and there is strong evidence of the use of saltpetre and sulfur in various largely medicinal combinations . The impetus for the development of gunpowder weapons in China was increasing encroachment by tribes on its borders . The earliest known formula for gunpowder can be found in a Chinese work dating probably from the 9th century . The Chinese wasted little time in applying it to warfare , and they produced a variety of gunpowder weapons , including flamethrowers , rockets , bombs , and mines , before inventing firearms . European descriptions of gunpowder first appear in Opus <unk> and Opus <unk> , written by the English philosopher Roger Bacon in the mid @-@ 13th century , although the mixture was not very effective . The composition of gunpowder varied throughout the period , and did not settle into the current ratios of saltpetre , sulfur and coal until the 17th century . 
 The years 904 – 906 saw the use of incendiary projectiles called ' flying fires ' ( <unk> @-@ huo ) . Needham ( 1986 ) argues that gunpowder was first used in warfare in China in 919 as a fuse for the ignition of another incendiary , Greek fire . Initially , gunpowder mixtures were utilised through traditional engines and throwing mechanisms ; containers and grenades were thrown by mangonels and trebuchets , and explosive rockets and arrows were developed , along with gunpowder flamethrowers . 
 Like firearms , cannon are a descendant of the fire @-@ lance , a gunpowder @-@ filled tube used as a flamethrower ; shrapnel @-@ like material was sometimes placed in the barrel so that it would fly out together with the flames . In due course , the proportion of saltpeter in the propellant was increased to increase its explosive power . To better withstand that explosive power , the paper and bamboo of which fire @-@ lance barrels were originally made came to be replaced by metal . And to take full advantage of that power , the shrapnel came to be replaced by projectiles whose size and shape filled the barrel more closely . With this , we have the three basic features of the gun : a barrel made of metal , high @-@ nitrate gunpowder , and a projectile which totally occludes the muzzle so that the powder charge exerts its full potential in propellant effect . 
 Firearms remained in use in China throughout the following centuries . Meanwhile , gunpowder and firearms spread elsewhere very quickly . Gunpowder seems to have been widely known by the 13th century . The Europeans , Arabs , and Koreans all obtained firearms in the 14th century . The Turks , Iranians , and Indians all got firearms no later than the 15th century , in each case directly or indirectly from the Europeans . The Japanese did not acquire firearms until the 16th century , and then from the Portuguese rather than the Chinese . 
 In 1326 , the earliest known European picture of a gun appeared in a treatise entitled " Of the Majesty , Wisdom and Prudence of Kings . " On February 11 of that same year , the Signoria of Florence appointed two officers to obtain <unk> de <unk> and ammunition for the town 's defense . A reference from 1331 describes an attack mounted by two Germanic knights on Cividale del Friuli , using gunpowder weapons of some sort . Cannon were first used by the Muslims at Alicante in 1331 , or Algeciras in 1343 . The French raiding party that sacked and burned Southampton in 1338 brought with them a <unk> and 48 bolts ( but only 3 pounds of gunpowder ) . The Battle of Crécy in 1346 was one of the first in Europe where cannons were used . 
 However , early cannon were not very effective , the main benefits being psychological , frightening men and horses . Short barrelled , large @-@ calibre " bombards " were used up until the late 15th century in Europe , during which period they grew increasingly larger . In the mid @-@ 15th century , mortars also appeared . Various smaller weapons also existed , including the serpentine , <unk> and <unk> . The powder was of poor quality and was used in small quantities – to prevent explosion of the barrel – so the effective range of these cannon was rarely more than 200 – 250m . 
 The barrels of the cannon were forged or cast , and each gun generally differed in calibre and length . Early powder resembled a paste , and tended to burn slowly . Its composition varied in different geographical areas , the powder of Europe being quite different to that used in the Islamic world . The projectiles used were generally stone balls for bombards and mortars . Forged iron balls were used in smaller @-@ calibre cannon , and coated with lead to make them smooth . From the 15th century , cast iron balls were used , which caused great destruction . As they were denser than stone , even small balls could be destructive . Thus , cannon became smaller in calibre , and longer barrels increased the range . 
 = = Later development = = 
 The use of incendiary devices had decreased by the 14th century , perhaps due to the economic realities of war where it became increasingly important that captured castles and towns were undamaged . Moreover , fewer wooden engines and structures were employed in the battlefield after the late 13th century , perhaps because of the prior success of the incendiary weapons at destroying them . 
 While the incidence of use dropped , towards the latter end of the Middle Ages the incendiary devices became more sophisticated , and the principle of wielding fire with sword remained present throughout the Early Modern and Modern periods ; improving technology merely allowed the process to become more efficient . 
 = = = The principle of fire and sword = = = 
 Fire itself remained a part of warfare . In his reminisces of the Peninsular War ( 1807 – 1814 ) , a British soldier recorded that the French soldiers would " regularly burn to the ground every place they pass through . In following them we find each town and village a heap of smoking ruins . " During World War I , Leuven , in Belgium was " looted and burned in medieval fashion " , when German soldiers set fire to much of the town , destroying the library and other cultural buildings , and causing outrage around the world . Yet the tactic was not dispensed with . In World War II , firebombing with incendiary bombs was carried out by the Germans against Britain during the Blitz , and by the Allies against Germany and Japan . After one heavy raid on Tokyo in March 1945 , the resulting conflagration destroyed a quarter of the predominantly wooden buildings . Much as the Ancient Greeks before them , it was a strategy of devastation . Fire has continued to be used as a destructive measure in warfare . During the 1991 – 1992 Gulf War , Iraq set fire to three @-@ quarters of Kuwait 's oil wells . 
 Fire remained an extremely successful weapon . During naval warfare of the Napoleonic wars , " the one thing most likely to destroy a ship was fire " . Sometimes the fires were merely a side effect of weapon technology . Early firearms proved incendiary in their use and could start fires . During the Peninsular War , both Talavera and Salamanca battlefields were wracked by tremendous <unk> , first started by the guns . At the Battle of Trafalgar , 1805 , the French ship Achille caught fire when musket @-@ flashes from her own men 's guns set fire to the tar and grease on the sail rigging ; the ship eventually exploded . 
 Smoke screens have continued to be used by attackers and defenders as a means of sowing confusion and hiding movements . During naval battles in the 18 – 19th centuries , shots were sometimes fired early so a defensive screen was erected before the ships converged , to spoil the aim of the enemy . 
 = = = Development and continued use of weapons = = = 
 The major development of weapons in the early modern and modern periods occurred with firearms , which became progressively more efficient . Gunpowder settled into its standard ratio in the 17th century , and general ballistic technology improved . Initially , iron round shot replaced the earlier stone balls for cannon then , latterly , different types of shot were invented . 
 A carcass was a hollow projectile usually formed either by an iron cage of ribs joining two small rings or a cast iron ball with holes . A carcass was so named because the iron cage was thought to resemble the ribs of a body . A carcass was filled with a highly flammable mixture . <unk> were used for the first time by the French under Louis XIV in 1672 . 
 For short range use against personnel , canister and the smaller naval grapeshot were popular during the 19th century ; it comprised smaller iron or lead pellets contained within a case or bag , which scattered on explosion . In 1784 , Lt Henry Shrapnel invented a spherical case @-@ shot , which was later named after him . The case was a hollow iron sphere which was filled with musket balls and was detonated by a gunpowder charge . Shot fired from cannon could be so hot that it scorched or set fire to materials that it brushed . 
 The incendiary liquids of the ancient and medieval periods were also developed , and have their modern equivalents . World War I saw the development of the flamethrower , a modern version of the Byzantine siphons , which used gas under pressure to squirt a mixture of inflammable oil and petrol , ignited by a burning taper . Similarly , the carcass projectile found new use in the Livens Projector , a primitive mortar that could throw a large canister of inflammable liquid ( it was soon used for poison gas instead ) . 
 Technology improved throughout the 20th century , and the latter half saw the development and use of napalm , an incendiary liquid formed in part from naphtha , which was the main ingredient of the Arabic " naft " . 
 Flames continued to be used for defensive light until artificial lights were developed . At the Siege of Badajoz in 1812 , the French defenders flung down burning " carcasses " of straw so that the attacking British might be seen . Like the sieges of old , the British were met by incendiary weapons , but now these took the form of explosive grenades , mines and powder barrels as well as the enemy 's guns . 
 Specific weapons from the ancient and medieval periods continued to develop , and many have modern equivalents . Rocket technology , originally trialled by the Mongols , Indians and the Chinese , amongst others , was improved by the 19th century ; one example was the incendiary Congreve rocket , which had a tail , a fuse , and a powder charge ( saltpetre , sulfur and carbon ) inside a hollow shell . Grenades continued to develop , although still retaining some aspects of their medieval equivalents . The grenades carried on board British Royal Navy ships in the late 18th century and early 19th century were constructed from hollow cast iron , filled with gunpowder ; the fuse was a hollow wooden tube filled with combustible material . During World War I , grenades were still occasionally launched by ballistae . 
 The use of some weapons continued with little change . The Koreans used fire arrows against the Japanese at the Battle of Hansan Island in 1592 . At Trafalgar , in 1805 , the British ship Tonnant shot wads covered in sulfur , which set fire to the <unk> . <unk> were used in later periods . In 1588 , the English sent fireships loaded with gunpowder , pitch and tar amongst the anchored Spanish Armada ; the Spanish fleet broke formation , setting them up for the later battle . The last battle under sail was the Battle of Navarino ( 1827 ) , part of the Greek War of Independence , during which fireships were utilised by the Turks . 
 Chemical warfare had been experimented with during the early period with sulfur , quicklime ( calcium oxide ) , and others , and developments continued . World War I saw many gases used , including the extremely effective sulfur mustard ( mustard gas ) . 
 = Pavel Bure = 
 Pavel Vladimirovich Bure ( Russian : Па ́ <unk> <unk> ́ <unk> <unk> ́ , IPA : [ <unk> <unk> ] ; born March 31 , 1971 ) is a retired Russian professional ice hockey right winger . Nicknamed " The Russian Rocket " for his speed , Bure played for 12 seasons in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) with the Vancouver Canucks , Florida Panthers and New York Rangers . Trained in the Soviet Union , where he was known as " Pasha " , he played three seasons with the Central Red Army team before his NHL career . 
 Selected 113th overall in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft by Vancouver , he began his NHL career in 1991 – 92 and won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league 's best rookie before leading the NHL in goal @-@ scoring in 1993 @-@ 94 and helping the Canucks to the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals . After seven seasons with the Canucks , Bure was dealt to the Panthers , where he won back @-@ to @-@ back Rocket Richard Trophies as the league 's leading goal @-@ scorer ( accomplished with Vancouver in 1993 – 94 as well , before the trophy 's inauguration ) . Bure struggled with knee injuries throughout his career , resulting in his retirement in 2005 as a member of the Rangers , although he had not played since 2003 . He averaged better than a point per game in his NHL career ( 779 points with 437 goals in 702 NHL games ) and is fourth all @-@ time in goals per game . After six years of eligibility , Bure was elected into the Hockey Hall of Fame in June 2012 . 
 Internationally , Bure competed for the Soviet Union and Russia . As a member of the Soviet Union , he won two silver medals and a gold in three World Junior Championships , followed by a gold and a silver medal in the 1990 and 1991 World Championships , respectively . After the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991 , Bure competed for Russia in two Winter Olympics , claiming silver at the 1998 Games in Nagano as team captain and bronze at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City . Following Bure 's retirement in 2005 , he was named the general manager for Russia 's national team at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin . Bure was later recognized for his international career as a 2012 inductee in the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Bure was born in Moscow to Vladimir and Tatiana Bure in 1971 . At age 12 , his parents separated , and Bure remained with his mother . Vladimir Bure , a Russian swimming legend , had dreams of Pavel becoming a professional swimmer , but Pavel aspired to play hockey at an early age . He attended his first tryout with the CSKA Moscow hockey school at the age of six despite his limited skating ability . Until that point , Bure had only played hockey on the streets with a ball . After Bure failed to impress in his first tryout , his father told him that if he did not show significant improvement within two months , he would withdraw him from the hockey school . By age 11 , he was named the best forward in his league . Around that time , in July 1982 , Bure was selected as one of three young Russian players to practice with Wayne Gretzky and Soviet national goaltender Vladislav Tretiak in a taped television special . By the time he was 14 years old , he was named to the Central Red Army 's junior team . 
 In December 1986 , he embarked on a tour of Canada , spanning from Ottawa to Vancouver , with the Soviet national midget team . Nearly five years before Bure made his NHL debut with the Vancouver Canucks in 1991 at the Pacific Coliseum , he played his first game at his future home rink as part of the tour . Bure also earned another opportunity to meet Gretzky , as well as defenseman Paul Coffey , when his team stopped in Edmonton to play at the Northlands Coliseum . 
 = = Playing career = = 
 = = = Central Red Army ( 1987 – 1991 ) = = = 
 Bure began his professional hockey career at age 16 , playing for the Central Red Army team . He was invited to the senior club 's training camp for the 1987 – 88 season and although he was deemed too young and not yet ready for the Soviet League , Bure earned minimal playing time filling in for absent regulars . He made his debut in September 1987 when the club briefly lost several players to the 1987 Canada Cup ; Bure played in five games that season . He scored his first professional goal for CSKA Moscow while playing on the fourth line in his senior club debut . 
 Bure joined the club full @-@ time in 1988 – 89 and amassed 17 goals , a Soviet League record for rookies . The record @-@ setting mark stood for 18 years before New York Rangers prospect Alexei <unk> scored 18 goals in 2006 – 07 . Bure added 9 assists for 26 points to earn the league 's rookie of the year honours . His individual success helped CSKA Moscow capture their thirteenth consecutive Soviet championship and twelfth consecutive IIHF European Cup in 1989 ( they repeated as European champions the following year ) . 
 As a member of the Moscow @-@ based club , Bure joined a lineup that featured several future NHL players , including linemates Sergei Fedorov and Alexander Mogilny , as well as Igor Larionov , Slava Fetisov , Sergei Makarov , and Vladimir Konstantinov . The combination of Bure , Fedorov and Mogilny formed a promising combination for head coach Viktor Tikhonov , with expectations to replace the previous top Soviet line , the K @-@ L @-@ M combination of Vladimir Krutov , Larionov and Makarov . The trio was short @-@ lived , as Mogilny defected to play for the Buffalo Sabres in 1989 and Fedorov joined the Detroit Red Wings the following year . 
 In his third and final season with the Red Army , Bure tied for the lead in team @-@ scoring with Valeri Kamensky , tallying 46 points . His 35 goals was second in the league , one goal behind Ramil <unk> of <unk> Kyiv . Bure turned down a three @-@ year contract extension in August 1991 , which resulted in him being left off the roster of the Soviet team for the Canada Cup . 
 = = = Transfer to the NHL ( 1989 – 1991 ) = = = 
 Prior to the 1989 NHL Entry Draft , William Houston of The Globe and Mail wrote , " The best of the group is Soviet star winger Pavel Bure , a spectacular player with outstanding speed . He is compared to Vladimir Krutov and also the late Soviet superstar of the 1970s , Valeri Kharlamov . " NHL organizations were afraid he would not leave the Soviet Union to play in the NHL thus deterring teams from selecting him early , although scouts and analysts believed he could have been selected as high as the second round in case he defected . Many analysts compared Bure to Valeri <unk> . Edmonton Oilers scout Barry Fraser commented , " From what I 've seen of him , Bure can play on any team in the NHL right now ... he 's quick , real quick , small and very exciting . He may be the top player in this year 's draft , but because he is from the Soviet Union , we don 't analyze him the same way as a kid from the West ... I don 't expect him to go really early because it is still too much of a gamble to hope he will defect . " Bure was selected 113th overall in the sixth round of the 1989 NHL Entry Draft by the Vancouver Canucks , following his rookie season with CSKA Moscow . The pick was controversial , as the Canucks had chosen him seemingly a year ahead of his eligible draft season . At the age of 18 , he was available to be chosen in the first three rounds of the draft , but in order to be selected any later than that , he would have needed to play in at least two seasons — with a minimum of 11 games per season — for his elite @-@ level Soviet club , the Central Red Army . While most teams believed he was ineligible , the Canucks ' head scout at the time , Mike Penny , discovered that Bure had played in additional exhibition and international games to make him an eligible late @-@ round draft choice a year early . Jack Button , the Washington Capitals ' director of player personnel , admitted " everybody would have taken him earlier . We assumed he was not eligible ... you 've got to give the Canucks credit for doing their homework . " 
 Several other teams either had similar knowledge or had pursued Bure , but there was confusion as to the legitimacy of the extra games . The Detroit Red Wings had inquired to league vice president Gil Stein as to Bure 's supposed availability prior to their fifth @-@ round pick , but were told that he was not eligible . According to General Manager Ken Holland of the Detroit Red Wings , their European scout Christer <unk> insisted that the Wings select Bure while he was still available in the fifth round , but upon being told of his ineligibility the team selected Shawn McCosh instead . The Red Wings then decided they would select him with their sixth @-@ round pick , 116th overall , " no matter what " and then settle his eligibility later . The Canucks selected Bure three picks ahead of Detroit 's turn . Winnipeg Jets general manager Mike Smith , meanwhile , claimed he travelled to Moscow prior to the draft and made an offer to the Soviet Ice Hockey Federation . The deal involved a transfer fee to be paid to the Soviets over three years , after which time , Bure would join the Jets as a 21 @-@ year @-@ old . Smith did not have any plans to draft Bure in 1989 , however , as he believed Bure was ineligible . 
 General manager Pat Quinn originally intended to draft Bure in the eighth round , but after receiving word that the Edmonton Oilers had similar intentions , he selected him in the sixth . Detroit 's European scout Christer <unk> immediately began protesting , while several other unidentified team representatives reportedly stormed the Met Center stage in Minnesota , where the draft was being held , following the announcement of Bure 's draft . The Hartford Whalers and Washington Capitals then filed formal complaints to the league , resulting in an investigation into the selection . After the pick was deemed illegal by league president John Ziegler in a press release on May 17 , 1990 , the Canucks appealed the decision , procuring game sheets proving Bure 's participation in the additional games with the help of recent Soviet acquisition Igor Larionov . It was not until the eve of the 1990 NHL Entry Draft , in which Bure would have been re @-@ entered , that the draft choice was upheld . 
 Although Larionov and Fetisov had successfully spearheaded the rebellion against Soviet ice hockey officials in the late 1980s that led to the allowance of Soviet players to join the NHL , Bure 's transfer to the Canucks met with resistance . Soviet authorities forbade the Canucks to contact Bure personally . During the 1991 World Junior Championships , he told the Toronto Sun in an interview that he was hesitant to defect for fears that the Soviets would make things difficult for his younger brother Valeri Bure , who was 15 at the time and playing in the junior league . 
 Bure left Moscow with his father and brother on September 6 , 1991 , temporarily staying in Los Angeles . His mother arrived shortly afterwards . The Canucks began negotiating a contract with Bure , but before one could be finalized , the issue of his existing contract with the Central Red Army had to be settled . The Canucks management and officials from the Soviet Ice Hockey Federation met in late @-@ October 1991 in a Detroit court , where they bartered for a cash settlement . After the Canucks offered $ 200 @,@ 000 , Bure stood up in the courtroom to offer an additional $ 50 @,@ 000 , bringing the total to $ 250 @,@ 000 . The Soviet officials accepted , and Canucks management paid the full $ 250 @,@ 000 . Bure signed a four @-@ year contract worth a reported $ 2 @.@ 7 million with an $ 800 @,@ 000 signing bonus soon thereafter . The deal made Bure the Canucks ' second highest paid player behind team captain Trevor Linden , who had just recently signed a four @-@ year , $ 3 @.@ 7 million contract . 
 = = = Vancouver Canucks ( 1991 – 1999 ) = = = 
 Due to the court proceedings , Bure 's Canucks debut in 1991 – 92 was delayed until a month into the season . Garnering much attention in Vancouver , his first practice with the club on November 3 , 1991 , was attended by approximately 2 @,@ 000 fans at Britannia Ice Rink in East Vancouver . He played his first game for the Canucks on November 5 , 1991 , in a 3 – 3 tie against the Winnipeg Jets . Despite being kept off the scoresheet in his NHL debut , Bure showcased his talent and speed with several end @-@ to @-@ end rushes , carrying the puck past several defenders from near his defensive zone to the opposing net . Following the game , Vancouver Sun columnist Iain MacIntyre compared him to a rocket , calling him " the fastest Soviet creation since Sputnik " . MacIntyre 's comments are credited for having laid the groundwork for Bure 's moniker as the " Russian Rocket " . It took Bure until his third game , a 6 – 0 win against the New York Islanders , to record his first point , an assist on a Cliff Ronning goal . He scored his first two NHL goals in the next game on November 12 against Daniel <unk> of the Los Angeles Kings in an 8 – 2 win . He scored 34 goals and 60 points in 65 games that season , including 22 goals in his final 23 games . In the last game of the regular season , Bure scored a goal to tie Ivan Hlinka 's 1981 – 82 team mark for most points by a rookie . Bure 's addition to the Canucks lineup bolstered a core that featured Linden and goaltender Kirk McLean , a Vezina Trophy nominee in 1989 and 1992 as the league 's best goaltender , and helped the Canucks to their first of two consecutive Smythe Division titles . 
 As the Canucks opened the 1992 playoffs against the Winnipeg Jets , Bure recorded his first NHL hat trick in game six to help force a seventh and deciding game . Vancouver won the series to advance to the second round , but were then eliminated by the Edmonton Oilers . Bure finished his first Stanley Cup playoffs with 6 goals and 10 points in 13 post @-@ season games . At the end of the season , Bure was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year over Detroit Red Wings defenceman Nicklas Lidström . His 60 points were second among first @-@ year players to Tony <unk> 's 69 points with the Rangers , although Bure played in 14 fewer games . When accepting the award , he thanked Canucks linemate Igor Larionov for his guidance . On arriving in Vancouver , the former Red Army teammate took Bure into his North Vancouver home for two weeks before Bure moved into his own downtown apartment . The two also roomed together on the road . Bure 's Calder Trophy , along with head coach Pat Quinn 's Jack Adams Award as the league 's top coach , marked the first major individual NHL awards in Canucks team history . Despite being distinguished as the league 's top rookie , however , Bure was left off the NHL All @-@ Rookie Team , making him the only Calder recipient to not be named to the lineup . He was left off the All @-@ Rookie Team because he split his time playing both left and right wing . When it came to voting for the players , Bure had the most total votes , but not enough at either position to claim a spot . 
 Bure improved on his rookie season in 1992 – 93 for his first of two consecutive 60 @-@ goal seasons . In the third game of the season , Bure scored a career @-@ high four goals against the Winnipeg Jets . His three goals and one assist in the second period set a pair of Canucks records for most goals and points in a period , in addition to the team mark for most goals overall in a game ( for which he is tied with several players ) . Furthermore , Bure scored two of his goals on the penalty kill to set a fourth team record for most short handed goals in one contest . Bure appeared in his first NHL All @-@ Star Game that season in 1993 , being named to the Clarence Campbell Conference Team as the lone Canucks representative . He scored two goals in his All @-@ Star debut in a 16 – 6 loss to the Wales Conference . Shortly after the All @-@ Star break , Bure established a new franchise record for goals in a season during a 5 – 1 win over the Quebec Nordiques , surpassing Tony Tanti 's 45 @-@ goal mark . The next month , on March 1 , Bure reached the 50 @-@ goal mark for the first time in his career , scoring against Grant Fuhr of the Buffalo Sabres in a neutral @-@ site game in Hamilton , Ontario . On March 9 , Bure recorded two assists in a 7 – 2 win against the New Jersey Devils to surpass Patrik Sundström 's franchise record of 91 points . This record stood until it was broken by Henrik Sedin 's 112 points in 2009 – 10 . Bure finished the season with 110 points in 83 games and became the first Canuck named to the NHL First All @-@ Star Team . 
 Bure began the 1993 @-@ 94 season with 7 goals and 13 points in 8 games , but then suffered his first career injury on October 23 , 1993 , pulling his groin in a match against the San Jose Sharks . Despite the injury , Bure was allowed to play the next night against the Sharks . He had to be helped off the ice after his first shift because he re @-@ injured his groin . As a result of the injury , Bure 's production the following two months declined substantially . On October 27 , 1993 , Pat Quinn voiced his opinion , stating in regards to Bure 's injury , " groins aren 't something you can fool with . You can have a problem all year long . If it actually pops , it could mean a career problem . " Bure recorded only four goals between his return on November 14 , 1993 and December 19 , 1993 , a dramatic decline from his near goal @-@ per @-@ game pace throughout that season . Although he missed eight games with the injury and struggled over the next two months , Bure led the league in goal @-@ scoring by repeating his 60 @-@ goal feat from the previous season . In doing so , he became the eighth player in NHL history to record back @-@ to @-@ back 60 @-@ goal seasons . He concluded the season with a streak of 49 goals and 78 points in his final 51 games , and earned player of the month honours in March 1994 after scoring 19 goals and 30 points in 16 games that month . His March scoring burst was just one point shy of Stan Smyl 's 31 @-@ point March in 1983 for the most productive month by a Canucks player . Bure 's 154 NHL goals at that point in his career put him behind only Wayne Gretzky and Mike Bossy for the most in any NHL player 's first three seasons . As the Canucks struggled to score in the second half of the 1993 @-@ 94 season , Bure recorded 49 goals in the club 's final 51 games and contributed to 46 @.@ 45 % of his team 's goals in the final 47 games of the season to carry the Canucks into the 1994 postseason . Jim Matheson of the Edmonton Journal called Bure " the NHL 's best forward the last 40 games , scoring almost a goal a game . " Bure played that season with linemates Gino Odjick and Murray Craven . The previous season , Bure played with Anatoli Semenov and Greg " Gus " Adams . Pat Quinn acknowledged , in failing to acquire suitable linemates to complement Bure , that he would likely continue to look " for that big , talented centre until the day I die . " 
 Entering the 1994 Stanley Cup Playoffs as the seventh seed , the Canucks went on a run to the Stanley Cup Finals . In the seventh game of the opening round series against the Calgary Flames , Bure scored one of the most significant and well @-@ known goals in Canucks history . After receiving a breakaway pass from defenceman Jeff Brown , he deked and scored on Flames goalie Mike Vernon in the second overtime to win the series . The Canucks advanced past Calgary with three consecutive overtime wins after having been down 3 – 1 in the series . In game two of the second round against the Dallas Stars , Bure knocked enforcer Shane <unk> to the ice with an elbow to the jaw . Bure also scored two goals in the game to help Vancouver to a 3 – 0 win . Although Bure was not initially penalized for the play , he later received a $ 500 fine from the league . Bure recorded 6 goals and 8 points in five games against the Dallas Stars , and against the Toronto Maple Leafs the following round scored 4 goals and 6 points in five games . Sports journalist Damien Cox recognized Bure as an emerging , committed playoff performer . 
 After defeating Dallas in five games , the Canucks eliminated the Toronto Maple Leafs in the Campbell Conference Finals to meet the New York Rangers in the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals . With the series tied 1 – 1 , Bure was ejected in game three after delivering a high stick to Rangers defenceman Jay Wells . Bure 's stick caught Wells beneath the eye , drawing blood and resulting in a five @-@ minute major and a game misconduct . With Bure out of the game , the Canucks lost the contest 5 – 1 . A 4 – 2 loss in game four put the Canucks at the brink of defeat in the series . When Vancouver won game five in New York on the strength of Bure 's two goals , and game six in Vancouver , the series was pushed to seven games . In the deciding game , the Rangers ended Vancouver 's playoff run by a 3 – 2 score to capture the Stanley Cup . Bure finished with a team @-@ high 16 goals and 31 points in 24 games , second in playoff scoring only to Conn Smythe winner Brian Leetch . Bure 's points total also remained the highest by any Russian player until Evgeni Malkin of the Pittsburgh Penguins recorded 36 in 2009 . 
 In the subsequent off @-@ season , the Canucks announced they had re @-@ signed Bure to a five @-@ year , US $ 24 @.@ 5 million contract on June 16 . The deal was reported to have been signed prior to game three of the Stanley Cup Finals against New York . It also obtained Bure 's marketing rights and put his father , Vladimir , on the team payroll as a fitness and marketing consultant . The average annual salary of US $ 4 @.@ 9 million made Bure the league 's third highest @-@ paid player , behind Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux . Bure and the Canucks had , in fact , entered into contract negotiations at the beginning of the 1993 – 94 season , although two years remained in his original deal . Neither side could come to an initial agreement ; one of the major factors was the Canucks ' demands for the contract to be in Canadian dollars on account of the American exchange rate . Numerous accusations were made in the media during the Canucks ' playoff run that Bure threatened not to play if a contract could not be agreed upon . A Toronto Star article published before the first game of the Finals on May 31 , 1994 , claimed that Bure had signed a five @-@ year , US $ 30 million contract that , if the Canucks had not agreed to , would have seen him pull out of game five of the Conference Finals against the Maple Leafs . The article was followed by two additional claims in the following two days in the Vancouver @-@ based newspaper The Province and Toronto Sun . The Toronto Sun held that the contract was a five @-@ year , US $ 22 @.@ 5 million deal , and that it was signed prior to either game six or seven of the opening round against the Flames after Bure 's agent , Ron Salcer , told general manager Quinn that Bure would not play if the deal was not made . As the story continued well into the next season , Pat Quinn appeared in a segment on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ( CBC ) ' s Hockey Night in Canada with host Ron MacLean on March 27 , 1995 , publicly denying the claims . 
 Due to the 1994 – 95 NHL lockout , Bure spent single @-@ game stints with HC Spartak Moscow of the Russian Super League and EV Landshut of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga ( DEL ) . He joined a team of Russian NHL players organized by Slava Fetisov that returned to Russia to play a five @-@ game charity tour against local clubs . On the team , Bure was reunited with former Central Red Army linemates Mogilny and Fedorov . When the NHL Players Association ( NHLPA ) and owners came to an agreement on January 12 , 1995 , NHL play was set to resume . However , there were unresolved contract issues , as Salcer claimed that the Canucks promised they would pay Bure 's full salary despite the lockout , which cancelled nearly half of the 1994 – 95 season . Bure held out for four days as a result ( the amount claimed to be owing was US $ 1 @.@ 7 million ) , before the two sides reached an agreement that the Canucks would put the disputed amount in escrow and would continue discussions . He soon reported to Vancouver and went on to tally 43 points in 44 games of the shortened season . He spent the season with a rotation of linemates , taking turns being centred by Trevor Linden , Cliff Ronning and rookie Michael <unk> . Bure had lacked a consistent linemate since he was centred by fellow Soviets Igor Larionov and Anatoli Semenov in each of his first two seasons . Nevertheless , in the 1995 playoffs , Bure set franchise records for most goals and points in a series with 7 and 12 respectively in a seven @-@ game series victory against the St. Louis Blues ( Mikael Samuelsson later tied Bure 's goal @-@ scoring record in 2010 against the Los Angeles Kings ) . The Canucks , however , failed to defend their Clarence Campbell Bowl title , being swept by the Chicago Blackhawks in round two . In the fourth and final playoff game against the Blackhawks , Bure left the contest early in the third period with a rib injury . The Canucks ' elimination in 1995 marked the last time Bure appeared in the post @-@ season with the club . He finished with a career playoff total of 66 points with the Canucks , including 34 goals , which remained the highest club total until Linden tied the mark in 2007 . 
 At the start of the 1995 – 96 season , Bure changed his jersey number from 10 to 96 . The switch commemorated the day on which he first landed in North America from Moscow , on September 6 , 1991 ( 9th month , 6th day ) . He had originally requested to wear the number when he first joined the Canucks , but was not permitted by head coach Pat Quinn , who did not approve of high jersey numbers . After the Canucks made a deal with the Buffalo Sabres to reunite Bure with Alexander Mogilny , the jersey number was deemed acceptable because of Mogilny 's number 89 . 
 Early in the season , Bure sustained the first of what were to be several serious knee injuries during his career . On November 9 , 1995 , in a game against the Chicago Blackhawks , Bure was grabbed around the head by defenceman Steve Smith while approaching the end boards . Falling to the ice , he caught his skate against the boards , tearing the anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) in his right knee . Requiring arthroscopic surgery , in which tendon was removed from his hamstring to repair the ACL , he was sidelined for the remainder of the season . Without Bure , the Canucks managed to make the 1996 playoffs on the strength of an offence led by Linden and Mogilny , but were defeated in six games of the opening round by the Colorado Avalanche , who went on to win the Stanley Cup . 
 Bure returned to the Canucks lineup with his knee fully recovered in the 1996 – 97 season . Competing for Russia in an exhibition match for the 1996 World Cup in August , he had suffered another setback with a bruised kidney and was sidelined for three weeks , but was able to recover in time for the NHL season . In the season opener against the Calgary Flames , on October 5 , 1996 , Bure was pushed into the boards head @-@ first by rookie defenceman Todd Simpson . He continued to play following the hit , though head coach Tom Renney admitted that Bure was still experiencing headaches in the weeks following . As Bure 's play dropped early in the season , speculation began that he was playing injured . After Bure went eight games without a goal , Renney claimed that Bure was not playing with a head injury , but instead had injured his shoulder in a game against the New York Rangers on November 23 . Nevertheless , Bure continued to play . With under a month left in the season , he received another hit , this time from defenceman Aaron Miller of the Colorado Avalanche during a game on March 3 , 1997 . He left the game and did not return for the remainder of the season . Afterwards , Bure admitted that he was playing with a neck injury , having sustained whiplash from the first game against Calgary , but did not want to take himself out of the lineup after having missed 62 games the previous season . With Bure 's reduced playing capacity , he managed 55 points in 63 games , well below his usual pace , and the Canucks missed the playoffs for the first time since Bure joined the team . In a 2012 interview , Bure admitted having sustained a head injury on the Simpson hit and that " he should not have played through it . " 
 In the off @-@ season , the Canucks made another significant move , signing Rangers captain Mark Messier during free agency on July 26 , 1997 . Despite finally having a high @-@ profile centre to play with , reports in the media began soon thereafter that Bure was requesting to be traded , starting with an article published by The Province on August 26 , 1997 , by Tony Gallagher . Bure and the Canucks opened the season with two games against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in Tokyo – an event organized by the league to market hockey for the upcoming 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano . After two injury @-@ plagued seasons with the number 96 on his jersey , Bure switched back to his familiar number 10 , explaining that " I 'm not superstitious , but the last two seasons have been bad memories . " Although the Canucks missed the playoffs for the second straight year , he returned his previous form in 1997 – 98 , scoring 51 goals for his first 50 @-@ goal season since 1993 – 94 and third overall . Bure later recalled that with the Canucks out of playoff contention with a handful of games left , head coach Mike Keenan told Bure he could play as much as he wanted in order to reach the milestone . Scoring 50 goals was also implicit in a contract bonus for Bure . With an additional 39 assists , Bure 's 90 points ranked him third in the NHL , behind Peter Forsberg and Jaromír Jágr . 
 Bure scored his last goal as a Canuck , and his 254th with the team , in the final game of the season against the Toronto Maple Leafs . The total left him just eight goals shy of Stan Smyl 's all @-@ time franchise record of 262 goals , which was later surpassed by Trevor Linden and Markus Näslund . 
 Following the 1997 – 98 season , Bure told newly appointed general manager Brian Burke in a meeting on July 5 , 1998 , that he would not play for the Canucks again , despite still having a year left in his contract worth USD $ 8 million . Bure then went public with the declaration the following month , stating that he intended to leave the club for " personal reasons " . Bure did not report to the club the following season . He instead went back to his hometown Moscow to practice with his former Central Red Army club . During this time , Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko offered Bure a tax @-@ free US $ 4 million salary to play in Belarus , which Bure turned down . 
 = = = Florida Panthers ( 1999 – 2002 ) = = = 
 Bure held out well into the 1998 – 99 season until he was traded on January 17 , 1999 , to the Florida Panthers , with Bret Hedican , Brad Ference , and Vancouver 's third @-@ round choice in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft ( Robert Fried ) for Ed Jovanovski , Dave Gagner , Mike Brown , Kevin Weekes , and Florida 's first @-@ round choice in the 2000 draft ( Nathan Smith ) . Talks between general managers Burke and Bryan Murray had begun in late @-@ December , with the two meeting at the 1999 World Junior Championships in Winnipeg . After the trade was completed , Bure explained in a joint @-@ interview with the Toronto Sun and The Province that he felt he was alienated by Canucks management ever since arriving in North America from Moscow . He cited having stayed in Los Angeles for two weeks before any Canucks representative came down to see him , in addition to several bitter contract negotiations . Bure also claimed that the constant allegations of him threatening not to play during the 1994 playoff run were planted by someone within Canucks management . 
 Meeting the Panthers in New York for a game against the Islanders , Bure debuted with his new club on January 20 , 1999 . He played on an all @-@ Russian line with Viktor Kozlov and Oleg Kvasha and scored two goals to help the Panthers to a 5 – 1 win . In his first six games with the club , Bure scored eight goals and three assists for eleven points . Less than a month into his Panthers debut , he suffered a strained right knee while kicking a loose puck during a game against the Pittsburgh Penguins on February 5 . Despite the injury , the Panthers announced three days later that Bure had signed to a five @-@ year , US $ 47 @.@ 5 million deal ( with an option for a sixth year at US $ 10 @.@ 5 million ) , the most lucrative in team history . 
 After being out of the lineup for nearly three weeks , Bure returned to appear in five more games , but was sidelined once more for the rest of the season with a knee injury that he suffered on March 3 after a collision with defenceman Adam Foote in a game against the Colorado Avalanche . After initial arthroscopic surgery revealed that his right ACL was not functioning , Bure underwent further reconstructive surgery on March 29 . Due to his holdout from Vancouver and the two injuries in Florida , Bure appeared in just 11 games that season , but managed to record 13 goals and 3 assists for 16 points . 
 In his first full season as a Panther , in 1999 – 2000 , he led the league in goal @-@ scoring to capture his first of two consecutive Rocket Richard Trophies with a 58 @-@ goal season . It marked the second time Bure led the league in goal scoring , but his first Rocket Richard Trophy as the award had just been inducted the previous season . Combined with 36 assists , his 94 points came within two of Art Ross Trophy winner Jaromír Jágr as the league 's leading point @-@ scorer . His 58 goals and 94 points both set franchise records . Bure helped Florida to a fifth @-@ place finish in the Eastern Conference to earn their first post @-@ season berth in three seasons . They were , however , swept in the opening round by the eventual Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils . It was Bure 's final appearance in the NHL playoffs . At the end of the season , he was listed as a nominee for the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league 's most valuable player . He finished as the second runner @-@ up with 11 first @-@ place votes , behind Jágr ( 18 first @-@ place votes ) and award @-@ winner Chris Pronger ( 25 first @-@ place votes ) . He was named to the NHL Second All @-@ Star Team for the first time , finishing second in balloting for right wingers behind Jágr ( he also mistakenly received a first @-@ place ballot as a left winger ) . Bure also finished fourth in balloting for the Lady Byng Trophy as the league 's most sportsmanlike player . 
 Bure was set to make his much @-@ anticipated return to Vancouver to play the Canucks on November 5 , 1999 , but was instead kept out of the lineup due to a broken finger suffered in a game against the Edmonton Oilers . The injury came after having missed five games to a groin injury , which also kept him out of a home game against the Canucks . During the season , he was also named to the 2000 NHL All @-@ Star Game in Toronto , where he recorded an assist and the 11th hat trick in the history of the All @-@ Star Game . Of Bure 's three goals , two were assisted by his brother Valeri , who played on the same line with Bure , along with Bure 's Panthers linemate , Viktor Kozlov . Helping lead the World team to a 9 – 4 victory over North America , Bure was named the All @-@ Star Game MVP . 
 Bure repeated as league scoring champion in 2000 – 01 with 59 goals , reaching the 50 @-@ goal plateau for the fifth and final time in his career , as well as bettering his franchise single @-@ season goal @-@ scoring record . Without much secondary scoring , however ( the second leading scorer on the team was Viktor Kozlov with 37 points ) , the Panthers missed out on the playoffs , finishing 12th place in the East . Bure set a league record that season by scoring 29 @.@ 5 % of his team 's total goals over the course of the season . He was named to the NHL Second All @-@ Star Team , behind Jágr in the right wing position for the second consecutive year . 
 Prior to the 2001 – 02 season , the Panthers acquired Valeri Bure from the Calgary Flames in a trade , reuniting the two brothers under the same team . Bure suffered a setback in the pre @-@ season , however , re @-@ injuring his groin . Bure recalled having " good relations " with Panthers management , who often consulted with him on team matters , including the acquisition of his brother . After the season began , he was sidelined for seven games in November and December due to a concussion . He sustained the head injury during a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs on November 19 , 2001 , after he was checked into the glass by forward Darcy Tucker . Several days after returning to the lineup , on December 16 , 2001 , Bure reached the 700 @-@ point mark with two assists and an empty net goal in a 3 – 1 win over the New York Islanders . At the trading deadline , Bure was dealt to the New York Rangers . During his 56 games for the Panthers that season , he led the team in scoring for the third consecutive season with 49 points . 
 = = = New York Rangers ( 2002 – 2003 ) = = = 
 The New York Rangers acquired Bure on March 18 , 2002 , along with Florida 's second @-@ round pick in the 2002 draft ( Lee Falardeau ) for Igor Ulanov , Filip Novak , as well as the Rangers ' first and second @-@ round choices in the 2002 draft ( Petr <unk> and Rob Globke , respectively ) and a fourth @-@ round choice in the 2003 draft . The Rangers had shown interest in Bure when he was originally shopped by the Canucks in 1997 . After losing their initial bid for Bure , Wayne Gretzky , who retired the same season Bure was dealt to Florida , announced prior to the 1999 – 2000 season that he would have extended his career had the Rangers been able to pull the trade off . Bure made his Rangers debut against the Vancouver Canucks the day after his trade on March 19 , scoring a goal in a 3 – 1 loss to his former team . He scored 12 goals and 20 points in 12 games upon being traded , up from his pace with Florida that season . Between the two teams , he finished the season with 34 goals and 69 points . 
 Bure suffered another knee injury in a 2002 – 03 pre @-@ season matchup with the New Jersey Devils on September 24 , 2002 . Combined with a case of strep throat , the injury caused him to miss the first three games of the regular season . Bure returned to the lineup to record 14 goals and 21 points in his first 27 games , including two goals and an assist in his first game back , before suffering a knee @-@ on @-@ knee collision with Buffalo Sabres forward Curtis Brown in a game on December 6 , 2002 . After undergoing surgery 10 days later , it was revealed that there was no damage to the ACL as previously feared , but instead a tear to the meniscus in his left knee , which was repaired . Bure returned that season to appear in 39 games , managing 19 goals and 30 points . 
 Bure did not play in 2003 – 04 due to lingering effects of the knee injury , even after two operations . He failed a pre @-@ season physical and was declared medically unable to play . Left with Bure 's fully insured US $ 10 million salary ( which would be reimbursed to the team by 80 percent ) , the Rangers consequently left him unprotected in the NHL 's <unk> Draft . He was unclaimed . 
 = = = Retirement and HHOF = = = 
 Bure remained inactive for another season due to the 2004 – 05 NHL lockout . After the NHL resumed play for the 2005 – 06 season , Bure announced his retirement from professional hockey at a press conference in Moscow on November 1 , 2005 , due to complications with his chronically injured knee . In an interview with hockey magazine Puck Life , Bure explained that he did not want to extend his playing career without being able to play at an elite level . 
 Because Bure had been inactive since the 2002 – 03 season , he was eligible for selection into the Hockey Hall of Fame ( HHOF ) immediately following his retirement . After being passed for induction in his first six years of eligibility , Bure was voted in on June 27 , 2012 , alongside Joe Sakic , Adam Oates and Mats Sundin . He became the fifth Soviet or Russian player ( after Vladislav Tretiak , Viacheslav Fetisov , Valeri Kharlamov and Igor Larionov ) and the first Canucks player to be inducted into the HHOF . 
 His non @-@ selections in previous years were widely debated in the media . Among the players chosen over him , defensive forward Dick Duff ( inducted in 2006 ) was singled out by Vancouver sports journalist Tony Gallagher in The Province as one Bure deserved recognition over . Often Bure was compared with Cam Neely , a player who also waited six years for induction ; Neely recorded similar goals @-@ per @-@ game numbers in a career that was also shortened to 700 @-@ plus games . After being passed a sixth time in 2011 , Bure 's brother , Valeri went public on the Vancouver radio station TEAM 1040 , declaring " somebody in the committee probably doesn 't like him . " It had been often rumoured that Bure 's former head coach and general manager in Vancouver , Pat Quinn , who became co @-@ chairman of the HHOF 's selection committee , opposed Bure 's induction . In a conference call following his selection , however , Quinn was among the most prominent figures he singled out to thank . He also accused the Canucks organization for not yet retiring Bure 's jersey . 
 In his retirement , Bure has remained publicly steadfast in his dissatisfaction with the way he was treated by the Canucks organization during his playing career . Among his claimed <unk> , Bure has singled out his arrival in North America after defecting from Russia , in which it took the Canucks organization several weeks to get in contact with him in Los Angeles . Another instance he has mentioned in particular were his contract negotiations in 1994 , when it was rumoured that Bure was threatening to sit himself out of the playoffs as leverage . Bure 's agent at the time , Ron Salcer , has said he believes the story came from within the Canucks organization . While Bure has admitted to " a lot of disagreements with the Canucks management , " he has maintained that he " never had any problems with the Canucks fans . " 
 On November 2 , 2013 , the Canucks officially retired Bure 's # 10 jersey . One day prior , Canucks Sports & Entertainment announced that the organization 's Most Exciting Player Award would be officially renamed the Pavel Bure Most Exciting Player Award in honor of Bure . 
 = = International career = = 
 Prior to joining the NHL in 1991 , Bure competed in several junior international tournaments for the Soviet Union . The first was the 1988 Quebec Esso Cup , an under @-@ 17 tournament ( now known as the World U @-@ 17 Hockey Challenge ) held in Quebec City , where he earned a gold medal . That same year , he competed in his first of two consecutive European Junior Championships . 
 The following year , Bure debuted at the world under @-@ 20 level as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old at the 1989 World Junior Championships in Anchorage , Alaska . The top line of CSKA Moscow teammates Bure , Alexander Mogilny and Sergei Fedorov led the Soviet Union to a gold medal . Bure 's eight goals tied him for the tournament lead with Jeremy Roenick of the United States , in addition to a team @-@ high 14 points . He was named to the Tournament All @-@ Star Team and earned Best Forward honours . 
 Bure competed in his second World Juniors the following year in 1990 , winning a silver medal in Helsinki , Finland , while scoring seven goals in seven games . Later that year , he made his senior debut with the Soviet national team as a 19 @-@ year @-@ old at the 1990 World Championships in Switzerland . He scored two goals and four assists in ten games to help the Soviets to a gold medal finish , winning all three games in the medal round . Despite winning the overall tournament , the Soviets finished with a silver in the European Championship , which took into account only games played amongst European teams during the tournament . Nevertheless , each Soviet player was awarded $ 10 @,@ 000 for winning the overall tournament , which Bure used to buy a new Lada . Several months later , in July , Bure took part in his third international tournament of the year at the 1990 Goodwill Games in Seattle . Bure scored four goals and an assist in five games , and the Soviets captured the gold medal by defeating the United States in the final . 
 In 1991 , Bure appeared in his third and final World Junior Championships . Having won their first four games , the Soviets required only a win in their the second @-@ to @-@ last @-@ game against Finland to clinch the gold medal . After the Finns built a 4 – 0 lead , Bure led a 5 @-@ goal comeback in which he scored his team 's final three goals for a natural hat trick . Nevertheless , the Soviets gave up a goal in the final minute of the game to set up a gold medal match against Canada . Although Bure finished the tournament as the leading scorer with 12 goals in 7 games , the Soviets fell to Canada 3 – 2 to settle for silver . He finished his three @-@ year World Junior career with a tournament @-@ record 27 goals , to go with 39 points , in 21 games . Bure later competed in the 1991 World Championships for his second international appearance of the year . He improved on his previous year 's total with 11 points in 11 games , tied for the team lead with Valeri Kamensky , and helped the Soviets to a bronze medal finish . Bure was named to the tournament 's Second All @-@ Star Team . The 1991 team marked the last World Championships that the Soviets played as the USSR , giving way to the union 's dissolution later that year . 
 Prior to the dissolution , Bure was set to represent the Soviet Union at the 1991 Canada Cup several months later in Canada . However , after turning down a three @-@ year contract with his Russian club , CSKA Moscow , he was left off the final roster . Further controversy ensued five years later in the inaugural 1996 World Cup ( the successor tournament to the Canada Cup ) . Bure had recently recovered from reconstructive surgery to his right knee and had begun practicing with the Russian national team , when he refused to sign a petition organized by national team veteran Slava Fetisov . With the Russian Ice Hockey Federation dealing with internal corruption , the petition called for the ouster of a select few Russian ice hockey officials . In response , Bure explained , " I do not sign petitions . I believe I should work – play hockey . Petitions to the federation or to Olympic committees do not interest me . " 
 In the 1996 World Cup of Hockey , Team Russia had played five preliminary games in order to set the groupings for the main tournament stage . Russia was the only team that went undefeated ( winning against Finland ( Moscow ) , Germany ( Landshut ) , Sweden ( Stockholm ) , USA ( Detroit ) , and tied against Canada ( Calgary ) . The U.S.A , Sweden and Finland games saw the pairing line of " Bure @-@ Fedorov @-@ Mogilny " , for the first and only time internationally on the senior level , and was considered " perhaps the best forward line on earth " at the time . With Bure injured as a result of a bruised kidney suffered in the preliminary game against the United States in Detroit , he would not play in the main tournament . 
 Two years later , Bure made his Olympic debut with Russia at the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano . He helped his team to the gold medal game after an Olympic record five @-@ goal game in Russia 's 7 – 4 semifinal win against Finland , two of which came on breakaways . Playing the Czech Republic in the final , however , Bure and the Russians were shut out by goaltender Dominik Hašek and lost the gold medal by a 1 – 0 score . He finished with a tournament @-@ high nine goals to be named the top forward and , while recording no assists , placed third in point @-@ scoring with nine points in six games . 
 After the Panthers were eliminated in the 2000 playoffs , Bure was added to the Russian roster for the 2000 World Championships , held in Saint Petersburg . The Russians were not able to make the medal rounds , suffering upset defeats to both Latvia and Belarus . In six games , Bure managed four goals and an assist . 
 Two years later , Bure made his second Olympic appearance at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City , playing with a fractured hand . Attempting to make his second straight trip to the gold medal game , Bure and the Russians knocked out the Czech Republic in the quarterfinals 1 @-@ 0 , but lost in the semifinals to the United States by 3 – 2 . Bure finished his final international tournament as a player with two goals and an assist in six games to go with a bronze medal , having defeated Belarus in the bronze medal game . 
 Upon the announcement of his retirement in 2005 , Bure was named Russia 's Olympic general manager , succeeding Viacheslav Fetisov . He promised to put an end to the Russian Hockey Federation 's history of internal conflict and player boycotts , stating , " You won 't see such a mess with the national team that you 've seen here before " , and that " You won 't see grouchy players here anymore . Only those who really want to play for Russia will be called into the team . " As general manager , Bure chose the team for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin . The Russians failed to win a medal after they were shut out by the Czech Republic in the bronze medal game . Leading up to the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver , former Soviet national goaltender Vladislav Tretiak was named Bure 's successor as Olympic general manager on October 12 , 2009 . 
 Over five years later , in December 2011 , Bure was announced as one of the 2012 inductees for the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame . He was named alongside American Phil Housley , Finn Raimo <unk> and Czechoslovak Milan <unk> in the annual class . The players will be officially inducted in a ceremony in May 2012 . 
 = = Playing style = = 
 Trained in the Soviet Union under the CSKA Moscow hockey program , Bure 's playing style reflected the speed , skill and puck possession that the Soviets held at a premium . The most prevalent aspects of Bure 's game were his skating speed , agility , and acceleration , which earned him his nickname as the " Russian Rocket " . He was able to use his quickness to separate himself from defenders , to retrieve pucks before the opposition could in all zones of the ice , and to skate coast @-@ to @-@ coast on many occasions . In a 1993 NHL coaches poll conducted by hockey writer Bob McKenzie , Bure was named the league 's best skater with eight of twenty @-@ one votes , twice as many votes as any other player . One coach noted " Bure has the best combination of speed , agility and balance ... He can also use change of speed better than anybody in the league right now . " Vancouver Canucks conditioning coach Peter Twist noticed during Bure 's rehabilitation period following his first major knee injury in 1995 , that his skating style was distinct in comparison to typical North American players . He explained , " Most players skate on their inside edge and push off at a 45 @-@ degree angle , but Bure starts on his outer edge and rolls over to his inside edge and pushes back straighter on his stride ... he gets more power and force in his stride to get up to top speed quicker . " 
 Bure 's skating was also complemented by his ability to deke out defenders and goaltenders at top speeds , making him capable of routinely starting end @-@ to @-@ end rushes . However , several knee injuries and consequent reconstructive surgeries compromised the speed that defined Bure 's game , ultimately leading to his retirement in 2005 . 
 Early in Bure 's career , he was noted for playing a strong two @-@ way game . Having joined head coach Pat Quinn 's defensive @-@ minded Vancouver Canucks in 1991 , his transition to the NHL was cited as being much easier than that of his countryman , Igor Larionov , due to his quick adjustment to the team 's defensive demands . Regarding Bure 's first NHL game against the Winnipeg Jets , reporter Mike Beamish explained that " hockey fans marvelled at his offensive thrusts , but hockey people were taken by a singular display of jet @-@ powered defensive diligence . On one play , after the Canucks were caught deep in the Winnipeg zone , the Russian winger raced back and almost singlehandedly foiled a two @-@ on @-@ one Jets ' rush , making up a half @-@ rink disadvantage . " Bure was used on the team 's penalty kill for his entire tenure with the Canucks , and was proficient at generating shorthanded chances , pressuring the opposition with his quickness and positioning in the defensive zone . During the 1992 Stanley Cup playoffs , commentator and ex @-@ NHL coach Harry Neale commented , " I like the effort he gives it when he doesn 't have the puck . We all know what he can do when he thinks he can score , but he 's killing penalties , he 's checking , doing a lot of things . " Bure tied for second @-@ place on Bob McKenzie 's 1993 coaches poll for the NHL 's best penalty killer . He was also voted the league 's second @-@ best stickhandler that season and garnered recognition as one of the smartest players in the NHL . 
 Sports journalists Damien Cox and Stephen Brunt wrote about Bure during the 1994 Stanley Cup playoffs that he was a " two @-@ way dynamo , " accounting for " several bodychecks he handed out on the night " and for his defensive abilities as he stayed on the ice in the final minutes of a one @-@ goal playoff match against the Toronto Maple Leafs . They spoke highly of his creativity as well , recognizing him as " someone who sees in his game a world of possibilities that just never occur to others , " praising his " sheer elegance and imagination " and characterizing his hockey sense as " ho @-@ hum brilliance from the most explosive player in the sport . " Brunt called him " a nonpareil , a van Gogh , a Picasso , a Charlie Parker . " During the 1993 @-@ 94 season , Bure demonstrated his strong playmaking abilities , helping linemate and friend Gino Odjick score a career @-@ high 16 goals in a single season , more than twice the number of goals Odjick would score in any other year separated from Bure and doubling his career goal totals up to that point in his career . According to teammate Cliff Ronning in 1994 , " we play a much sounder game defensively when Pavel 's flying , as he was in the first period . " Former Canuck Jyrki Lumme spoke of Bure as a player and teammate , " That guy does something spectacular every time ... it 's frustrating to go against him in practice because he 's all over the place . He makes everybody on our team better . " In reference to Bure 's ability in his time as a Canuck to transition from defense to offense rapidly , anticipate plays and retrieve loose pucks with his explosive skating , Pat Quinn explained after a Canucks victory in Edmonton , " The winning goal was an alert play on Pavel 's part . He was positioned well on defence and then he saw that wicked bounce and he turned it into a goal . He 's a cut above in those situations . We have nine or 10 other guys who would have probably missed the net . " Adrien <unk> , whose dump @-@ in resulted in the opportunity , stated , " I made the safe play , it took a funny bounce and with his speed he got there first . All I was trying to do was get it in . " The Vancouver Sun 's summary of the game described that " while Bure 's winner displayed his exquisite sense of the dramatic , his second @-@ period assist on Greg Adams ' goal was far the more spectacular play . He turned Oiler defenceman Brian Glynn around like a set of revolving doors before feeding Adams in front . " 
 Bure won the Canucks ' Most Exciting Player Award , as voted by the fans , a team record five times ( tied with Tony Tanti ) from 1992 – 1995 and once more in 1998 . Canucks teammate and captain Trevor Linden , who had played with Bure for seven seasons , said following Bure 's retirement , " I don 't know if I 've ever seen or played with a player that 's brought people out of their seats like that . " During the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals , New York Rangers coach Mike Keenan , who later coached Bure for one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half seasons in Vancouver , called him " perhaps the most electrifying forward in the league " . On November 1 , 2013 , the Vancouver Canucks officially renamed the award the Pavel Bure Most Exciting Player Award in his honor . 
 Bure has been described as a pure goal scorer and is statistically among the top players in NHL history in that regard . In addition to having reached the 50 @-@ goal mark in his career five times and the 60 @-@ goal mark twice , his .623 goals per game average is third among the top 100 goal scorers in NHL history , behind Mike Bossy and Mario Lemieux . In the 1993 @-@ 94 season , Bure began the year with 7 goals and 13 points in his first 8 games , and finished the season with a streak of 49 goals and 78 points in his final 51 games , a goal @-@ per @-@ game pace playing with Gino Odjick and Murray Craven , interrupted primarily by a groin injury suffered on October 23 , 1993 . In the final 47 games of that season , Bure scored 29 @.@ 67 % of his team 's goals to catapult them into the 1994 Stanley Cup playoffs . NHL veteran Mike Keane , playing with the Montreal Canadiens at the time , called Bure " dangerous ... right behind Lemieux and ( Wayne ) Gretzky . He can zip , he 's strong and he can finesse you . A bona @-@ fide superstar . " Michael Farber of the Montreal Gazette described Bure as " the most dangerous scorer in the National Hockey League with the continued absence of Mario Lemieux because Bure can beat a defence with his speed , his strength , his mind . Bure isn 't a scorer as much as he is a permanent late @-@ night television guest ; he is to highlight packages what Terri Garr is to Letterman . "

 = = = Family = = = 
 Bure comes from an athletic family ; his father Vladimir , who is of Swiss descent ( his side of the family originated from <unk> , Switzerland ) , was an Olympic swimmer who competed for the Soviet Union in the 1968 , 1972 , and 1976 Olympic Games . He won four medals , including a bronze medal for the 100 @-@ metre race in the 1972 Games , in which he lost the gold medal by half a second to American swimming legend Mark Spitz . Bure retained his father as his personal trainer well into his playing career , before severing ties with him in 1997 . Bure 's paternal grandfather , Valeri Bure , also competed for the Soviet Union in the Olympics as a goalkeeper for the national water polo team . Named after their grandfather , Bure 's younger brother , Valeri Bure , was also a hockey player , spending 10 years in the NHL . The two siblings played with each other briefly as members of the Florida Panthers , after Valeri was traded there on June 25 , 2001 , as well as on the Russian national team at Nagano and Salt Lake City in 1998 and 2002 , respectively . 
 In addition to athleticism , nobility ran in the family . Bure was named after his great @-@ grandfather , a watchmaker to Tsar Alexander III . Bure 's family made precious watches for the tsars from 1815 – 1917 ; as <unk> of the imperial family , they were granted noble status . After Bure sustained his first serious knee injury in 1995 , he pursued the watchmaking business during his rehabilitation period in an attempt to revive the family business . Fifty replicas of the same watches his ancestors sold to the Russian imperial family were made and priced at US $ 30 @,@ 000 each . Bure presented three of the gold replicas to Russian President Boris Yeltsin , Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Moscow mayor Yuriy Luzhkov . 
 Pavel 's younger brother Valeri Bure has been married to actor Candace Cameron Bure for over 19 years . Together they have three children 
 = = = Relationships = = = 
 Five days after arriving in North America from Moscow with his father and brother on September 6 , 1991 ( his mother Tatiana arrived two months later ) , Bure married an American fashion model in a civil ceremony . The model was later revealed to be Jayme Bohn . The marriage was allegedly set up by Bure 's agents as a preventative measure against deportation in the event Bure and the Canucks could not come to terms with a contract . Bure derived no immigration benefit from the marriage , which was dissolved the following year . Bohn became a costume designer in the film and television industry . Bure later obtained his permanent residence visa ( " green card " ) as an alien " with extraordinary ability in sciences , arts , education , business , or athletics " . 
 After being linked to girlfriend <unk> Bryan , a model and actress , early in his NHL career , Bure shared a relationship with tennis star and fellow Russian Anna Kournikova . The two met in 1999 when Kournikova was still linked to Bure 's former Russian teammate Sergei Fedorov . Bure and Kournikova were reported to have been engaged in 2000 after reporter Andrew Greven took a photo of them together in a Florida restaurant where Bure supposedly asked Kournikova to marry him . As the story made headlines in Russia , where they were both heavily followed in the media as celebrities , Bure and Kournikova both denied any engagement . Kournikova , 10 years younger than Bure , was 18 years old at the time . The following year , Kournikova and Fedorov were married in Moscow . They were soon divorced , however , and Kournikova later entered into a long term relationship with pop star Enrique Iglesias in 2001 after appearing in his music video " Escape . " 
 Bure married 23 @-@ year @-@ old model Alina <unk> on October 10 , 2009 . Bure and <unk> had known each other for four years after meeting in Turkey . The wedding was held in Moscow for over 300 guests at a restaurant . Pravda reported the couple had officially married on October 10 , 2008 , in Miami . 
 = = = Legal activity = = = 
 In 2002 , Bure sued the Russian newspaper the eXile for publishing an article stating that he broke up with Kournikova on account of her having two vaginas . Although the newspapers ' editorial staff claimed the story was a mere joke , the court ruled in favour of Bure in the amount of 500 @,@ 000 rubles ( US $ 17 @,@ 770 ) . Furthermore , the eXile was obligated to print another article refuting the previous story . Two years later , on December 27 , 2004 , the Russian cosmetics chain Arbat Prestige published a story in their free promotional paper that Bure had bragged about Kournikova losing her virginity to him . Shortly thereafter , on January 31 , 2005 , Bure sued Arbat Prestige for 300 million rubles ( US $ 10 @.@ 65 million ) in a court in Moscow . He also demanded Arbat Prestige print a retraction and apology in a future paper , similar to the suit against the eXile . The court ruled in favour of Bure in November 2005 . The amount was , however , reduced from 300 million to approximately 320 @,@ 000 rubles . 
 Nearly a year after his retirement , on October 31 , 2006 , Bure filed another suit after being kicked off a British Airways flight by the pilot , having been mistaken for a rowdy soccer fan . Despite an official apology from the airline company in June 2007 , Bure took the issue to court , suing British Airways for 20 million rubles . In late @-@ August 2007 , the Tver Court of Moscow ruled in favour of Bure in the total amount of 67 @,@ 000 rubles . 
 = = = Alleged Mafia connections = = = 
 During Bure 's playing career , much speculation surrounded Russian NHL players and their potential ties to the Russian mafia as both victims and associates . As Soviet players began defecting to the NHL , many cases of extortion began surfacing that the Russian mafia was targeting the players ' families still living in Russia . Former teammate Alexander Mogilny was a victim of such an extortion attempt in 1994 , while Bure was reported to have made payments totaling in the thousands of dollars to Russian extortionists in 1993 . Three years later , however , in 1996 , American sports network ESPN aired reports alleging Bure was a potential associate to the Russian mafia on account of his relationship with friend and business partner <unk> Kikalishvili , known to both Russian and American police as a suspected criminal and possible Russian mob boss . Bure was revealed to hold a position as vice president in the sports company Twenty First Century Association , owned by Kikalishvili , and reportedly believed by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to be a mafia front worth at least US $ 100 million in illicit funds . While Bure did not deny his business and personal relationships with Kikalishvili , he refuted reports that Kikalishvili was involved in any criminal activity . Speculation resurfaced in 1999 , as Bure was included in an investigation aired by CBC documentary series fifth estate that made several supposed associations between Soviet NHL players and the Russian mafia . An allegation arose that Bure 's former Red Army teammate Viacheslav Fetisov used a company of which he was president to launder money for Vyacheslav <unk> , considered to be the " Russian godfather " in North America . Bure 's relationship with Kikalishvili continued to be questioned . Bure denied Kikalishvili 's involvement in any criminal activity , dismissing the allegations as " rumours " .

 During his stay with the Canucks , Bure initially lived with teammate and countryman Igor Larionov , who helped him transition in the city of Vancouver .

 George Julian " Snowy " Howell , VC , MM ( 19 November 1893 – 23 December 1964 ) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross , the highest decoration for gallantry " in the face of the enemy " that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces . Howell was decorated with the Victoria Cross following his actions during the Second Battle of Bullecourt , in which he ran along the parapet of a trench bombing the German forces attacking his position through the use of grenades , and thus driving them back . 
 Born in a suburb of Sydney , New South Wales , Howell was employed as a builder before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in June 1915 . Allotted to the force 's 1st Battalion , he served at Gallipoli prior to transferring to the Western Front . Participating in the Somme offensive of 1916 , Howell was wounded at Pozières and promoted to corporal in early 1917 . During an attack on a German held village , he led a rifle bombing section and was awarded the Military Medal for his actions . Severely wounded in his Victoria Cross action , Howell underwent a prolonged hospitalisation period before returning to Australia and receiving his discharge on medical grounds . Settling in Coogee , he gained employment by working on the advertising staff of several newspapers . Following the outbreak of the Second World War , Howell served with the Australian Eastern Command Headquarters but soon sought his discharge and enlisted with the United States Sea Transport Service . Howell died in 1964 at the age of 71 .

 = = First World War = = 
 On 3 June 1915 , Howell enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force for service in the First World War . Allotted to the 7th Reinforcements of the 1st Battalion as a private , he embarked from Sydney for Egypt on 14 July aboard HMAT Orsova . Joining the 1st Battalion at Gallipoli on 1 November , Howell served on the peninsula until the Allied evacuation the following month . Returning to Egypt , the battalion spent several months training in the desert in preparation for service on the Western Front . 
 The 1st Battalion embarked for France in March 1916 , and by April the unit was entrenched in the Fromelles sector . In the third week of July , Howell was wounded in the Battle of Pozières while taking part in the Somme offensive . Evacuated to a hospital in Sheffield , England , during early August , Howell attended a training school before returning to his battalion on 26 November . Appointed lance corporal on 10 December , he was promoted to corporal on 6 February 1917 . 
 On 9 April 1917 , Howell took part in the 1st Battalion 's attack on the German held village of Demicourt . During the engagement , Howell led a rifle bombing section at the forefront of his company against the German position . The section was held up several times in their advance due to heavy machine gun fire , but managed to overcome the opposition and continue the advance each time . For his actions during the battle , Howell was awarded the Military Medal , the recommendation of which cited his " ... courage and devotion to duty ... was of great assistance to his company in the capture of its objectives " . The notification of the award was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 26 May 1917 .

 In preparation for an attack on the Hindenburg Line at Bullecourt , the 1st Australian Brigade — of which the 1st Battalion was part — was attached to the 2nd Australian Division . The attack commenced in the morning of 3 May 1917 , with the 2nd Division lined up in conjunction with thirteen other divisions . Despite some progress made early in the attack , the Australian forces were soon held up by strong opposition , and in the evening the 1st Battalion was entrenched in the old German line known as ' <unk> ' . Three of the battalion 's companies occupied the line , while a fourth was placed in reserve . Their position was such that they occupied a wedge into the German line , while two flanks were in German held territory . 
 From the initial attack , only the Canadians on the extreme right and the 3rd Australian Brigade on the extreme left were able to capture and hold their set objectives . Over the course of the next three days , severe fighting took place and further troops were drawn in to hold and extend the gains of 3 May . On 6 May , the Germans launched a counter @-@ attack which forced the 3rd Brigade to withdraw from their trenches ; it was during this engagement that Howell was to perform the act which was to earn him the Victoria Cross . 
 At 06 : 00 , Howell , who was in charge of a post to the right of the line , noticed the battalion on the right flank was being forced out of its trench and was beginning to retire . Immediately alerting battalion headquarters , Captain Alexander MacKenzie — who had assumed temporary command of the battalion — hurriedly organised a group of non @-@ combatant soldiers from headquarters together with several signallers to form a defensive line along a road bank in order to fend off the expected German advance . A fierce bombing and grenade fight soon ensued , with both sides suffering heavy casualties . Fearing the Germans would outflank his battalion , Howell climbed onto the top of the parapet and began running along the trench line throwing bombs down on the Germans , all the while being subject to heavy rifle and bomb fire . Forcing the Germans back along the trench , Howell was supported by Lieutenant Thomas Richards who followed him along the trench firing bursts from his Lewis Gun . Soon <unk> his supply of bombs , Howell began to attack with his bayonet until he fell into the trench wounded . Howell had been hit in both legs by machine gun fire , and when he was brought into the clearing station some hours later , it was discovered he had suffered at least twenty @-@ eight separate wounds . Due to his actions , the ground which had been lost was soon retaken , and the German attack was later repulsed . 
 The full citation for Howell 's Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the London Gazette on 27 June 1917 , reading : 
 War Office , 27th June , 1917 . 
 His Majesty the KING has been graciously pleased to approve of the award of the Victoria Cross to the undermentioned Officer , Warrant Officer , Non @-@ commissioned Officers and men : — 
 No. <unk> Cpl. George Julian Howell , Inf . Bn . , Aus . Imp . Force . 
 For most conspicuous bravery . Seeing a party of the enemy were likely to outflank his Battalion , Cpl. Howell , on his own initiative , single @-@ handed and exposed to heavy bomb and rifle fire , climbed on to the top of the parapet and proceeded to bomb the enemy , pressing them back along the trench . 
 Having exhausted his stock of bombs , he continued to attack the enemy with his bayonet . He was then severely wounded . 
 The prompt action and gallant conduct of this N C.O. in the face of superior numbers was witnessed by the whole Battalion and greatly inspired them in the subsequent successful counter attack . 
 = = = Hospitalisation and repatriation = = = 
 Howell 's multiple wounds at Bullecourt required a prolonged hospitalisation period for treatment , and he was sent to the Norfolk and Norwich War Hospital in England . On 21 July 1917 , Howell was invested with his Victoria Cross and Military Medal by King George V in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace . A photograph of the pair together was taken at this time , and later published in the Times History of the War . Promoted to sergeant , Howell returned to Australia on 31 October . Having not adequately recovered from his wounds , he was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 5 June 1918 on medical grounds . Howell 's father and one of his brothers had also served on the Western Front during the First World War ; his father with the 54th Battalion and his brother , Frederick , with the 1st Pioneer Battalion .

 On 1 March 1919 , Howell married Sadie Lillian Yates , a nurse , at St Stephen 's Presbyterian Church in Sydney . The pair settled in Coogee , where Howell was employed on the advertising staff of Smith 's Newspapers Ltd and later the Bulletin Newspaper Co . Pty Ltd . By 1933 , he was the New South Wales representative for the Brisbane Standard and the Queensland Worker . 
 At the outbreak of the Second World War , Howell once again offered his services and enlisted in the Australian Army on 14 October 1939 . Posted to Eastern Command Headquarters , Paddington , he was granted the rank of staff sergeant , but found staff work to be dull and sought his discharge in February 1941 . In August 1944 , Howell enlisted in the United States Army for service in the United States Sea Transport Service , and was thus able to participate in the invasion of Leyte at the commencement of the Philippines campaign . 
 In December 1953 , following his wife 's death , Howell moved from Sydney to Western Australia . Accompanied by his grandson , the journey took four days by train before the pair arrived in the Perth suburb of Applecross , where Howell was to live with his married daughter , Norma . He later moved to <unk> , via <unk> , where he was to reside for a few years before returning to Perth . In 1956 , he joined the Australian contingent of Victoria Cross recipients who attended the parade in London 's Hyde Park to commemorate the centenary of the institution of the Victoria Cross . 
 Howell died at the Repatriation General Hospital , Hollywood , Perth , on 23 December 1964 . He was granted a funeral with military honours , before his body was cremated and his ashes interred at Karrakatta Cemetery , Perth . Howell 's name is commemorated by a plaque in the Western Australian Garden of Remembrance , and his Victoria Cross and other medals are on display at the Australian War Memorial , Canberra .

 " Unleashed " is the 16th episode of the first season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe . It centered on a man @-@ made chimera , which escaped from an animal testing facility and attacked various people , including Agent Charlie Francis while the Fringe team tries to stop it . 
 The episode was written by Zack Whedon and J. R. Orci , and directed by Brad Anderson . Actress Kiersten Warren guest starred as Charlie 's wife Sonia . 
 It first aired in the United States on the Fox Broadcasting Network on April 14 , 2009 , and more than 10 million viewers watched the episode . It received mixed reviews , with a common criticism being that the " monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week " was becoming a tired idea for the show . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Animal rights activists ransack a laboratory and unwittingly release a creature with a ferocious appetite . As they flee in an SUV , the creature follows and grotesquely mutilates them . The Fringe team consisting of FBI agents Olivia Dunham ( Anna Torv ) , Charlie Francis ( Kirk Acevedo ) , Philip Broyles ( Lance Reddick ) , and civilian consultants Peter ( Joshua Jackson ) and Walter Bishop ( John Noble ) arrives , and Walter sees evidence of different creatures ' marks on the bodies . Olivia realizes one of them is missing , and after interviewing a student at MIT to try to identify the victims , she realizes they were animal rights activists . While conducting autopsies on the bodies , an animal control team at a different site is killed by the creature after investigating a call . 
 While investigating the animal control team deaths , Charlie is attacked by the creature , but it fails to kill him after Olivia arrives on the scene . Walter explains he believes the creature is a man @-@ made chimera , which has the best genetic traits of many different creatures , including a lizard , bat , and wasp . He had tried to create the creature years before , but his experiments failed , and concludes that someone else must have taken up his research . Though initially thinking Charlie was healthy after the attack , they realize the chimera 's stinger injected him with its larvae , and that he has less than 24 hours to live . 
 After experimenting with poison fails to kill the larvae in Charlie 's body , Walter believes that mixing the chimera 's blood with Charlie 's will stop the larvae from attacking and bursting out of his body , as they did in the other victims ' corpses . Olivia learns one of the victims , Jonathan Swift , was the son of a scientist who tests on animals , and was killed while breaking into his father 's lab . They also realize the chimera was created based on work by one of Walter 's peers , not Walter himself . 
 After several sightings , the Fringe team move into some nearby storm drains to bait the chimera with its larvae . Feeling somewhat responsible , Walter locks himself in with the chimera and ingests some poison that will kill him within the hour , believing that if it kills him , the chimera will only be killing itself . He manages to shoot the chimera in time however , and they use its blood to find a cure for Charlie . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Unleashed " was directed by filmmaker Brad Anderson , his third episode of the season . It was co @-@ written by writer Zack Whedon and supervising producer J. R. Orci . 
 The episode centered on Kirk Acevedo 's character Charlie Francis . Acevedo explained in an interview , " Charlie goes out on this call , and he gets attacked by this mythological , genetically enhanced griffin . He fights for his life throughout the episode " . Acevedo suggested that his wife , actress Kiersten Warren , play his character 's wife Sonia , and the producers duly cast her . Acevedo explained his choice was because , " to create intimacy with someone who you don 't know is actually not going to work . So to have your real wife do it , then you can be a lot better on screen " . 
 The scene where Walter confronts the chimera was shot in a Boston sewer . He and Peter carry 50 caliber Desert Eagle handguns , called " monster killers " by one prop crew member . While shooting , the actors had to use their imagination , as the CGI monster was not yet complete . Director Brad Anderson described the chimera " sort of an amalgam of a bat , lion , and a dragon " . Anderson called the scene between Walter and the chimera as a " triumphant moment " for Walter , and actor Joshua Jackson characterized the scene as Walter 's " action hero moment " . The actor himself , John Noble , described the scene with the chimera as " terrifying " , as his character " tries to be a hero " . Andrew Orloff , Zoic ’ s Creative Director and Visual Effects Supervisor later called the chimera effect the most difficult effect he 'd done for the show thus far . Sound editor Thomas Harris explained that because the episode had a monster that was " part lizard , part wasp , part bat , and part lion , " it was difficult to " manipulate sounds from all these animals , as well as other sweeteners , without getting muddy and meshing together " . Their efforts on the episode were ultimately nominated in several categories at the Golden Reel Awards , and at the HPA Awards , for which they won . 
 Actress Jasika Nicole explained in a May 2009 interview that the scariest episode for her at the time was " Unleashed " . She described the episode 's production , " The props people had these big buckets of earth worms , but they were thicker and meatier and longer . They had teeny little bitty faces ... So the guy 's chest is cut open and he ’ s been in make @-@ up for hours to make it look like he ’ s been torn open and he ’ s all bloody and stuff . So then they pour these worms and this goopy , syrupy stuff and this fake blood onto this guy ’ s chest ... We had to zip him up in the body bag . It takes a few minutes to get to ' action ' after he 's zipped up . We unzip him and we see the worms and it ’ s so gross – and the look on his face . The worms are crawling up and their in his armpits and starting to crawl toward his face and he can ’ t move at all because he ’ s supposed to be dead . " Nicole continued that this scene had to be shot " three or four times . We kept trying to get faster and faster but we were all laughing [ for him ] . It was like a Fear Factor episode with no chance of getting money ... It was so gross but so much fun . The guy was such a trooper . " 
 New Media consultant Glen Whitman stated in an interview that this particular episode contains some recent scientific developments that were part of their inspiration for the creation of Fringe in the first place . Specifically , Whitman is referring to the use of transgenics , which is the idea that there are organisms with genes from other species . Whitman concluded that they were partly inspired by scientists Osamu Shimomura , Martin Chalfie , and Roger Y. Tsien and their work on research on isolating genes from jellyfish for the treatment of Huntington 's disease ; all three won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry .

Isler however praised the further development of John Noble 's character , as Walter took responsibility for his actions . Josie Kafka of Open Salon.com saw allusions in the episode to many other genres , including Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Halloween , and Dollhouse . She thought the " Walter @-@ Peter interchanges " were the most interesting aspects of the episode . The A.V. Club 's Noel Murray graded the episode a B- , writing that though he enjoyed the " thrilling , funny opening " and the " multiple amusing lines of dialogue , " he wished the episode had gone further with the genetic experimentation concept . Murray concluded that " ' Unleashed ' stays at the level of a well @-@ shot , disappointingly straightforward monster movie , with an everything ’ s @-@ okay @-@ now ending " . 
 Sarah Stegall from SFScope was skeptical of the chimera premise , but wrote she was willing to overlook that because the episode " delivers [ entertainment ] in spades " and gives " a fine payoff ... There are creepy sewers , pee jokes , heroics , tears , laughter , scares , and finally a kill shot of a terrifically scary monster " . Stegall also praised Torv and Acevedo 's performances , and called the episode the best she 's watched in a while . Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times praised the episode , writing the writers and characters were " finally getting into their groove , " and that the monster sequence was " better than most horror films I ’ ve seen lately " .

 = Battle of Marston Moor = 
 The Battle of Marston Moor was fought on 2 July 1644 , during the First English Civil War of 1642 – 1646 . The combined forces of the English Parliamentarians under Lord Fairfax and the Earl of Manchester and the Scottish Covenanters under the Earl of Leven defeated the Royalists commanded by Prince Rupert of the Rhine and the Marquess of Newcastle . 
 During the summer of 1644 , the Covenanters and Parliamentarians had been besieging York , which was defended by the Marquess of Newcastle . Rupert had gathered an army which marched through the northwest of England , gathering reinforcements and fresh recruits on the way , and across the Pennines to relieve the city . The convergence of these forces made the ensuing battle the largest of the civil wars . 
 On 1 July , Rupert outmanoeuvred the Covenanters and Parliamentarians to relieve the city . The next day , he sought battle with them even though he was outnumbered . He was dissuaded from attacking immediately and during the day both sides gathered their full strength on Marston Moor , an expanse of wild meadow west of York . Towards evening , the Covenanters and Parliamentarians themselves launched a surprise attack . After a confused fight lasting two hours , Parliamentarian cavalry under Oliver Cromwell routed the Royalist cavalry from the field and , with Leven 's infantry , annihilated the remaining Royalist infantry . 
 After their defeat the Royalists effectively abandoned Northern England , losing much of the manpower from the northern counties of England ( which were strongly Royalist in sympathy ) and also losing access to the European continent through the ports on the North Sea coast . Although they partially retrieved their fortunes with victories later in the year in Southern England , the loss of the north was to prove a fatal handicap the next year , when they tried unsuccessfully to link up with the Scottish Royalists under the Marquess of Montrose .

 In Northern England , the Royalists had the advantage in numbers and local support , except in parts of Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire , where the Parliamentarians had support from the clothing @-@ manufacturing towns which " naturally maligned the gentry " . On 30 June 1643 , the Royalists commanded by the Marquess of Newcastle defeated the Parliamentarian army of Lord Fairfax at the Battle of <unk> Moor near Bradford . Fairfax and his son , Sir Thomas Fairfax , fled with their remaining forces to the port of Hull , which was held for Parliament . 
 Newcastle sent some of his army south into Lincolnshire , as part of a planned " three @-@ pronged " advance on London , but was forced to besiege Hull with most of his forces . The siege failed , as the Parliamentarian navy could supply and reinforce the port and the garrison flooded wide areas around the city , while the Royalist detachments sent into Lincolnshire were defeated at the Battle of Gainsborough and the Battle of <unk> . 
 In late 1643 , the English Civil War widened . King Charles I negotiated a " cessation " in Ireland , which allowed him to reinforce his armies with English regiments ( one of horse and twelve of foot ) which had been sent to Ireland following the Irish Rebellion of 1641 , but Parliament took an even greater step by signing the Solemn League and Covenant , sealing an alliance with the Scottish Covenanters . 
 Early in 1644 , a Covenanter army under the Earl of Leven entered the north of England on behalf of the English Parliament . The Marquess of Newcastle was forced to divide his army , leaving a detachment under Sir John Belasyse to watch the Parliamentarians under Lord Fairfax in Hull , while he led his main body north to confront Leven . 
 = = = Siege of York = = = 
 During March and early April , the Marquess of Newcastle fought several delaying actions as he tried to prevent the Scots from crossing the River Tyne and surrounding the city of Newcastle upon Tyne . Meanwhile , a Parliamentarian cavalry force under Sir Thomas Fairfax , who had been campaigning in Cheshire and Lancashire during the winter , crossed the Pennines and entered the West Riding of Yorkshire . To prevent Sir Thomas rejoining Lord Fairfax in Hull , Belasyse occupied the town of Selby which lay between them . On 11 April , Sir Thomas Fairfax 's force , reinforced by infantry under Sir John Meldrum , stormed Selby , capturing Belasyse and most of his force . 
 Hearing the news , Newcastle realised that the city of York was in danger . York was the principal city and bastion of Royalist power in the north of England , and its loss would be a serious blow to the Royalist cause . He hastily retreated there to forestall the Fairfaxes . Leven left a detachment to mask the Royalist garrison of Newcastle upon Tyne , and followed Newcastle 's army with his main body . On 22 April , Leven and the Fairfaxes joined forces at Wetherby , about 14 miles ( 23 km ) west of York . Together , they began the Siege of York . 
 Initially , the siege was a rather loose blockade as the Covenanters and Parliamentarians concentrated on capturing smaller Royalist garrisons which threatened their communications with Hull . On 3 June , they were reinforced by the Parliamentarian army of the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester . York was now completely encircled and siege operations began in earnest . Leven was accepted as commander in chief of the three combined allied armies before York ( referred to by Parliament as the " Army of Both Kingdoms " ) . It was politic to make the Scottish Covenanters pre @-@ eminent in the north as they were the largest single contingent in the army , but Leven was also a respected veteran of the Thirty Years ' War . 
 = = = Relief moves = = = 
 News of the siege soon reached Oxford , where King Charles had his wartime capital . From 24 April to 5 May , he held a council of war attended by his nephew and most renowned field commander , Prince Rupert . It was settled that while Charles attempted to play for time in Oxford , Rupert would relieve York . 
 Rupert set out from Shrewsbury with a small force on 16 May . His first moves were intended to gather reinforcements along the way to bolster his army , and secure Lancashire for the troops heading over from Ireland for the Royalist cause . He assumed the direction of a small Royalist army , based on Chester and commanded by Lord John Byron , raising his force to 2 @,@ 000 horse and 6 @,@ 000 foot . Having forced a crossing of the River Mersey at Stockport , he stormed Bolton , allegedly killing 1 @,@ 600 of the Parliamentarian defenders and citizens . Resting at Bury nearby , Rupert was joined by the Marquess of Newcastle 's cavalry under Lord George Goring , which had broken out of York early in the siege , with a small contingent from Derbyshire , and several regiments which were being freshly raised in Lancashire by the Earl of Derby . Bypassing the Parliamentarian stronghold of Manchester , Rupert approached Liverpool on 6 June and wrested control of the city from Parliament after a five @-@ day siege . 
 Rupert now hesitated , unsure whether to proceed to the relief of York or remain to consolidate the Royalist hold on Lancashire , securing more reinforcements in the process . He also distrusted some of the members of Charles 's council of war and was wary of being so far from the King 's side . On 16 June , he received a dispatch from the King which contained troubling news . The King 's advisors on the council of war had overturned Rupert 's defensive policies , sending the garrisons of Reading and Abingdon on an offensive in the West Country . This had left Oxford exposed to a sudden threat from the Parliamentarian armies commanded by the Earl of Essex and Sir William Waller and forced the King to leave the city in haste and head to Worcester , where he was still in danger . The letter also contained some ambiguous orders regarding Rupert 's northern offensive and future plans : 
 But now I must give the true state of my affairs , which , if their condition be such as enforces me to give you more peremptory commands than I would willingly do , you must not take it ill . If York be lost I shall esteem my crown little less ; unless supported by your sudden march to me ; and a miraculous conquest in the South , before the effects of the Northern power can be found here . But if York be relieved , and you beat the rebels ' army of both kingdoms , which are before it , then ( but otherwise not ) I may possibly make a shift upon the defensive to spin out time until you come to assist me . Wherefore I command and conjure you , by the duty and affection that I know you bear me , that all new enterprises laid aside , you immediately march according to your first intention , with all your force to the relief of York . But if that be either lost , or have freed themselves from the besiegers , or that for want of powder , you cannot undertake that work , that you immediately march with your whole strength , directly to Worcester to assist me and my army ; without which , or you having relieved York by beating the Scots , all the successes you can afterwards have must infallibly be useless onto me . 
 Rupert understood the letter to be an order both to relieve York and defeat the allied army before heading south once more to aid the King . By this time Rupert 's army numbered nearly 14 @,@ 000 . He set out from Liverpool to Preston , which surrendered without a fight . From there he proceeded via Clitheroe and crossed the Pennines to Skipton , where he paused for three days from 26 June to 28 June to " fix arms " and await some final reinforcements from Cumberland and Westmoreland . He arrived at the Royalist garrison at Knaresborough Castle 14 miles ( 23 km ) northwest of York on 30 June . 
 = = = Relief of York = = = 
 The allies were aware of Rupert 's approach and had been hoping that reinforcements from the Midlands under Sir John Meldrum and the Earl of Denbigh could ward off this threat , but they learned that these forces could not intervene in time . The allied armies around York were separated from each other by rivers , and if Rupert attacked them in their siege lines he could destroy any one army before the other two could come to its aid . Therefore , they abandoned the siege on the night of 30 June , and concentrated their forces near the village of <unk> before taking position on Marston Moor , where they blocked Rupert 's expected direct march to York ( along the old Roman road named Ermine Street , the modern A59 ) , and could easily move to their left to prevent Rupert making any move to the south via Wetherby . 
 Early on 1 July , some Royalist cavalry advanced from Knaresborough and appeared on the Moor , and the allies prepared for battle . However , Rupert had made a 22 @-@ mile ( 35 km ) flank march to the northeast with his main body , crossing the River Ure at Boroughbridge and the River Swale at Thornton Bridge . These two rivers merge to form the River Ouse , which Rupert had successfully put between himself and the allied armies . Later that day , his forces defeated the Earl of Manchester 's dragoons , who had been left to guard a bridge of boats across the Ouse at the village of Poppleton a few miles north of York . This had been the only crossing available to the allies above another bridge of boats at <unk> <unk> 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) south of York , and its capture prevented the allies crossing the Ouse to engage Rupert . 
 More of Rupert 's cavalry arrived at York to gain touch with the garrison . With York definitely relieved , Newcastle sent Rupert a fulsome letter of welcome and congratulations . Rupert replied , not in person but through Goring , with a peremptory demand for Newcastle to march his forces to Rupert 's assistance on the following morning . 
 = = Battle = = 
 = = = Prelude = = = 
 On learning that they had been outmanoeuvred , the allied commanders debated their options . They decided to march south to Tadcaster and Cawood , where they could both protect their own supply lines from Hull , and also block any move south by Rupert on either side of the Ouse . Their foot ( infantry ) , ordnance and baggage set off early on 2 July , leaving the cavalry and dragoons , commanded by Sir Thomas Fairfax , as rearguard . At about 9 am , the allied generals learned that Rupert 's army had crossed the captured bridge of boats at Poppleton , and was advancing onto Marston Moor . The Covenanter and Parliamentarian foot , some of whom had already reached Tadcaster , were hastily recalled . 
 However , Newcastle and his Lieutenant General , Lord Eythin , were opposed to any pitched battle and possibly offended by Rupert 's high @-@ handed attitude . Rather than join Rupert immediately they temporised , claiming that it would take time to clear the earth and rubble which had been used to block the city gates of York during the siege . Newcastle 's soldiers in York then refused to fight unless given their delayed payment , a dispute which Eythin may have fomented . A number were also absent , pillaging the abandoned allied siege works and encampments outside the city , and had yet to return . 
 Around midday , Rupert was joined on Marston Moor by Newcastle , accompanied by a mounted troop of " gentleman volunteers " only . Rupert greeted him by saying , " My Lord , I wish you had come sooner with your forces , but I hope we shall yet have a glorious day . " Newcastle counselled that the three allied armies , with separate garrisons , recruiting areas and lines of communication to protect , would eventually separate . He also suggested waiting for a force of 3 @,@ 000 under Colonel Clavering and collected garrisons amounting to another 2 @,@ 000 to join the Royalist army . Rupert was adamant that the King 's letter ( which he never showed to Newcastle ) was a command to engage and defeat the enemy immediately . Furthermore , Rupert wished to compensate for the Royalists ' numerical inferiority by catching the enemy unawares , and before further Parliamentarian reinforcements could increase their superiority in numbers . 
 However , without Newcastle 's infantry , and with his own infantry exhausted from their long march on the previous day , Rupert was unable to attack , and the odds against him lengthened as the day wore on , and the Scots and Parliamentarian infantry and artillery returned from their aborted move south and took position . 
 At about 2 : 00 pm , the allied artillery , consisting of around thirty pieces of ordnance commanded by General Alexander Hamilton , began a cannonade . However , at about 5 : 00 pm , the firing ceased . Meanwhile , at about 4 : 00 pm , the Royalist contingent from York belatedly arrived , led by Eythin . Rupert and Eythin already knew and disliked one another . Both had fought at the Battle of Vlotho in 1638 , where Rupert had been captured and held prisoner for several years . Rupert blamed Eythin 's caution for the defeat on that occasion , while Eythin blamed Rupert 's rashness . On the Moor , Eythin criticised Rupert 's dispositions as being drawn up too close to the enemy . His main concern was that a fold in the ground ( referred to by some eyewitnesses as a " glen " ) between the ridge on which the allied forces were drawn up and the track between Long Marston and Tockwith concealed the front line of the allied infantry from both view and artillery fire , allowing them to attack suddenly from a comparatively close distance . When Rupert proposed to either attack or move his army back as Eythin suggested , Eythin then <unk> that it was too late in the day for such a move . The Royalist army prepared to settle down for the night , close to the allied armies . 
 = = = Deployment = = = 
 = = = = Covenanters and Parliamentarians = = = = 
 The Covenanters and Parliamentarians occupied Marston Hill , a low feature ( actually part of a terminal moraine ) less than 100 feet ( 30 m ) above the surrounding countryside but nevertheless prominent in the flat Vale of York , between the villages of Long Marston and Tockwith . They had the advantage of the higher ground , but cornfields stretching between the two villages hampered their deployment . 
 At some point in the day , the Royalists attempted to seize a rabbit warren to the west of the cornfields from where they might enfilade the Parliamentarian position , but they were driven off and the Parliamentarian left wing of horse occupied the ground . The wing was under the command of Manchester 's Lieutenant General , Oliver Cromwell . The first two lines consisted of over 3 @,@ 000 cavalry from the Eastern Association , including Cromwell 's own double @-@ strength regiment of <unk> . They were deployed in eleven divisions of three or four troops of cavalry each , with 600 " commanded " musketeers deployed as platoons between them . The use of musketeers to disrupt attacking cavalry or dragoons was a common practice in the Swedish Army during the Thirty Years ' War , and was adopted by both the Parliamentarians and Royalists at Marston Moor . Three regiments of Covenanter horse , numbering 1 @,@ 000 and mounted on lighter " nags " , formed a third line to Cromwell 's rear under Sir David Leslie . Five hundred Scottish dragoons under Colonel Hugh Fraser were deployed on the extreme left . 
 The centre , under the direction of the Earl of Leven as nominated commander in chief , consisted of over 14 @,@ 000 foot , with 30 to 40 pieces of artillery . Thomas Stockdale recorded the disposition of the troops and the role of Leven in drawing up the order of battle : 
 The <unk> forces strengthened with a great party of the Scotts army <unk> the main battle , the Earl of Manchester ’ s forces the left wing , and the Scotts the right wing , each battle <unk> severall <unk> and winged with horse , according to Generall <unk> direction whose great experience did <unk> challenge the prime power in ordering them . 
 The Covenanter Sergeant Major General of Foot , James Lumsden , nevertheless noted ( in a note on the map he made of the allied army 's dispositions ) that " ... the <unk> <unk> up heir as we [ illegible ] it is not so formal as it ought to be . " 
 Most of Manchester 's infantry under Sergeant Major General Lawrence Crawford were on the left of the front line . A brigade of Lord Fairfax 's foot was in the centre . Two Covenanter brigades each of two regiments , the " vanguard " of the main battalia commanded by Lieutenant General William Baillie , made up the right of the front line . The second line consisted of four Covenanter brigades , their " main battle " , commanded by Lumsden . There is confusion as to the disposition of the third line and of the infantry deployment on the right wing , as the only map ( Lumsden 's ) is badly damaged . The usual interpretation , based on Peter Young 's reconstruction , is that the third line contained two or three Covenanter brigades and the Earl of Manchester 's own regiment of foot . Young placed the main body of Fairfax 's foot on the left of the third line , although more recent interpretations of accounts put them on the right of the third line or even behind the cavalry of the right wing . An <unk> Covenanter regiment may have formed an incomplete fourth line . ( There were a total of nineteen Covenanter regiments of foot , some of them incomplete , present at the battle . ) 
 The right wing was commanded by Sir Thomas Fairfax , with John Lambert as his second in command . He had at least 2 @,@ 000 horse from Yorkshire and Lancashire , deployed in nine divisions , with 600 musketeers posted between them in the same manner as on the left wing . There were also perhaps 500 dragoons . One regiment of Covenanter horse commanded by the Earl of Eglinton was deployed with Fairfax 's front line , two more ( one of them composed of lancers commanded by the Earl of Balgonie , Leven 's son ) were deployed behind Fairfax 's second line . The second and third lines of the right wing may also have included some units of foot , whose identity is uncertain . 
 = = = = Royalists = = = = 
 The Royalists occupied the low @-@ lying moor , behind a drainage ditch that Rupert noted as an effective obstacle to a cavalry charge . There is some dispute over the course of the ditch at the time of the battle . Some contemporary accounts support the contention by later historians that it was non @-@ existent on the Royalists ' right wing . On the other hand , a near @-@ contemporary plan of the Royalist dispositions by Rupert 's chief engineer , Bernard de Gomme , shows the ditch in its present @-@ day alignment . It is generally accepted that the ditch was at least less of an obstacle on the Royalist right . 
 The Royalist left wing was commanded by Lord Goring . It consisted of 1 @,@ 700 cavalry from the Marquess of Newcastle 's cavalry ( the " Northern Horse " ) , 400 cavalry from Derbyshire and 500 musketeers . The first line was commanded by Goring and the second by Sir Charles Lucas . 
 Their centre was commanded by Eythin . A brigade numbering 1 @,@ 500 and consisting of Rupert 's and Byron 's regiments of foot under Colonel Robert Napier of Byron 's regiment was deployed at the ditch , at the junction of the right wing and centre , possibly to protect some artillery which may have occupied a slight hummock near this point . To their left , a forlorn hope of musketeers lined the ditch . Behind them , the first line and the left wing of the second line were composed of the remaining infantry units of Rupert 's army , numbering 5 @,@ 500 , under Rupert 's Sergeant Major General , Henry <unk> . The 3 @,@ 000 infantry from Newcastle 's army under Sergeant Major General Francis Mackworth formed the right wing of the second line and an incomplete third line behind the right centre when they arrived , though some at least of them may not have taken up their assigned positions when the battle began , leaving the right of the Royalist centre understrength . A brigade of 600 " Northern Horse " under Sir William Blakiston was deployed behind the left centre . A total of 14 field guns were deployed in the centre . 
 The right wing was commanded by Byron , with 2 @,@ 600 horse and 500 musketeers . The second line , which included Rupert 's Regiment of Horse but also some comparatively inexperienced regiments , was commanded by Lord Molyneux , although the experienced but unprincipled Sir John Urry ( or " Hurry " ) was Sergeant Major General of Rupert 's horse and therefore Byron 's second in command . 
 Unlike the Covenanters and Parliamentarians , Rupert retained a reserve of 600 cavalry , including his elite Lifeguard of Horse , under his personal command . This reserve was situated behind the centre . 
 = = = Main action = = = 
 Delayed by the late arrival of the York garrison , it was late evening before the Royalists were fully deployed . A flurry of rain showers and the discouragement of Newcastle and Eythin persuaded Rupert to delay his attack until the next day . From the ranks of the allied army he could hear the singing of psalms . As the Royalist troops broke ranks for their supper , Leven noted the lack of preparation among his opponents and ordered his men to attack at or shortly after 7 : 30 pm , just as a thunderstorm broke out over the moor . 
 On the allied left , Crawford 's infantry outflanked and drove back Napier 's brigade while Cromwell 's horse quickly defeated Byron 's wing . Though Byron had been ordered to stand his ground and rely on the ditch and musket fire to slow and disorganize an enemy attack , he instead ordered a hasty counter @-@ charge which disordered his own troops and prevented his musketeers and four " drakes " ( field guns ) attached to Napier 's brigade from firing for fear of hitting their own cavalry . In the clashes which followed , Byron 's front line regiments were put to flight . Cromwell was slightly wounded in the neck , by a pistol ball in most accounts , and briefly left the field to have the wound dressed . 
 Noting the setback on this flank , Rupert led his reserve towards the right , rallying his own fleeing regiment of horse and leading them in a counter @-@ attack . A Parliamentarian officer wrote : 
 Cromwell 's own division had a hard pull of it ; for they were charged by Rupert 's bravest men both in front and flank ; they stood at the sword 's point a pretty while , hacking one another ; but at last ( it so pleased God ) he [ Cromwell ] brake through them , scattering them before him like a little dust . 
 Leslie 's Covenanter regiments eventually swung the balance for Cromwell , outflanking and defeating the Royalist cavalry . Rupert 's right wing and reserve were routed and he himself narrowly avoided capture by hiding in a nearby bean field . 
 In the centre , the main Covenanter foot initially succeeded in crossing the ditch , capturing at least three pieces of artillery . On the allied right , Sir Thomas Fairfax 's wing fared worse . He later wrote : 
 Our Right Wing had not , all , so good success , by reason of the <unk> and ditches which we were to pass over before we could get to the Enemy , which put us into great disorder : notwithstanding , I drew up a body of 400 Horse . But because the intervals of Horse , in this Wing only , were lined with Musketeers ; which did us much hurt with their shot ; I was necessitated to charge them . We were a long time engaged with one another , but at last we routed that part of their Wing ... [ I ] myself only returned presently , to get to the men I left behind me . But that part of the Enemy which stood , perceiving the disorder they were in , had charged and routed them , before I could get to them . 
 Fairfax wrote that his second @-@ in @-@ command , Major @-@ General Lambert , could not get up to him , and so charged in another place . A lane , the present @-@ day <unk> Lane , crossed the ditch on this flank , and some accounts suggest that several units were easy targets for the Royalist musketeers as they advanced along the lane only four abreast . When a small embankment alongside the ditch at this point was removed in the 1960s , several hundred musket balls were recovered . 
 When Goring launched a counter @-@ charge , the disorganised Parliamentarians were routed , although some of the Covenanter cavalry regiments with Sir Thomas Fairfax 's wing , especially the Earl of Eglinton 's regiment , resisted stoutly for some time . As an eyewitness observed : 
 sir Tho . Fairfax his new levied Regiments being in the Van [ of the right wing ] , they wheeled about , & being hotly pursued by the enemy , came back upon the L. Fairfax foot , and the reserve of the Scottish foot , broke them wholly , & trod the most part of them under foot . 
 Most of Goring 's victorious wing then either scattered in pursuit , or fell out to loot the allied baggage train , but some of them under Lucas wheeled to attack the right flank of the allied infantry . Meanwhile , some of Newcastle 's foot counter @-@ attacked the brigade of Fairfax 's foot in the centre of the allied front line and threw them into confusion . Following up this advantage , Blakiston 's brigade of horse , probably reinforced by the troop of " gentleman volunteers " under Newcastle himself , charged the allied centre . Under Lucas 's and Blakiston 's assaults in the confusion and the gathering darkness , six of the Covenanter infantry regiments and all of Fairfax 's infantry fled the field . The Scottish sergeant major general , Lumsden , on the right of the allied second line , stated that : 
 These that ran away shew themselves most <unk> . I commanding the battel was on the head of your Lordships [ Loudoun 's ] Regiment , and Buccleuch 's ; but they carried themselves not so I could have wished , neither could I <unk> with them : For these that fled , never came to charge with the enemie , but were so <unk> with ane <unk> fear , that they ran for an example to others , and no enemie following them , which gave the enemie [ an opportunity ] to charge them , they intended not , & they had only the <unk> . 
 One isolated Covenanter brigade that stood its ground was at the right of their front line and consisted of the regiments of the Earl of Crawford @-@ Lindsay and Viscount Maitland . Lucas launched three cavalry charges against them . In the third charge , Lucas 's horse was killed , and he was taken prisoner . Behind them , Lumsden reformed the reserve of the allied centre , pushing four regiments ( those of the Earl of <unk> , William Douglas of <unk> , Lord Coupar and the Earl of Dunfermline ) and part of the Clydesdale Regiment forward into the breach in the allied front line . Behind them in turn , the Earl of Manchester 's regiment repulsed and scattered Blakiston 's brigade . 
 By now it was nearly fully dark , although the full moon was rising . The countryside for miles around was covered with fugitives from both sides . A messenger from Ireland riding in search of Prince Rupert wrote : 
 In this horrible distraction did I coast the country ; here meeting with a shoal of Scots crying out , ' <unk> us , we are all undone ' ; and so full of lamentation and mourning , as if their day of doom had overtaken them , and from which they knew not whither to fly ; and anon I met with a ragged troop reduced to four and a Cornet ; by and by with a little foot officer without hat , band , sword , or indeed anything but feet and so much tongue as would serve to enquire the way to the next garrisons , which ( to say the truth ) were well filled with the stragglers on both sides within a few hours , though they lay distant from the place of the fight 20 or 30 miles . 
 Cromwell 's disciplined horsemen had rallied behind the right of the original Royalist position . Sir Thomas Fairfax , finding himself alone in the midst of Goring 's men , removed the " field sign " ( a handkerchief or slip of white paper which identified him as a Parliamentarian ) from his hat , and made his way to Cromwell 's wing to relate the state of affairs on the allied right flank . Some five or six troops of Fairfax 's cavalry and Balgonie 's Covenanter regiment of horse ( split into two bodies ) also made their way though the Royalists to join Cromwell . Cromwell now led his cavalry , with Sir David Leslie still in support and Sergeant Major General Crawford 's foot on his right flank , across the battlefield to attack Goring 's cavalry . 
 By this time , Goring 's troops were tired and disorganised , and several of his senior officers were prisoners . They nevertheless marched down the hill from the Parliamentarian baggage to occupy roughly the same position which Fairfax 's cavalry had held at the start of the battle , which most contemporary accounts stated to be a disadvantageous position . When Cromwell attacked , Goring 's outnumbered troops were driven back . Many of them retired to the " glen " , the fold of ground beneath Marston Hill , but refused to take any further part in the battle despite the efforts of officers such as Sir Marmaduke Langdale and Sir Philip Monckton to rally them . Eventually they obeyed orders to retreat to York late at night . 
 The triumphant allies meanwhile turned against the remains of the Royalist centre , overrunning successive units and cutting down many fugitives . Finally some of Newcastle 's foot , the " whitecoats " , gathered for a last stand in a ditched enclosure . This has usually been stated to be White Sike Close , in the rear of the Royalists ' original position , where some of Newcastle 's infantry would have retreated when they found their right flank " in the air " following the defeat of Byron 's and Rupert 's cavalry , and certainly where some mass burials later took place , although the enclosure may instead have been Fox Covert , a mile north of Long Marston on the natural line of retreat towards York . The whitecoats refused quarter and repulsed constant cavalry charges until infantry and Colonel Hugh Fraser 's dragoons were brought up to break their formation with musket fire . The last 30 survivors finally surrendered . 
 = = = Casualties = = = 
 Approximately 4 @,@ 000 Royalist soldiers had been killed , many in the last stand of the whitecoats , and 1 @,@ 500 captured , including Lucas and <unk> . The Royalists lost all their guns , with many hundreds of weapons and several standards also falling into the hands of the allied forces . 
 The allied generals ' dispatch , and other Parliamentarian accounts , stated that 300 of their soldiers were killed . One of those mortally wounded among the Parliamentarians was Sir Thomas Fairfax 's brother , Charles . Another was Cromwell 's nephew , Valentine Walton , who was struck by a cannonball early in the day . Cromwell was present when he died afterwards , and wrote a famous letter to the soldier 's father , Cromwell 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , also named Valentine Walton , which briefly described the battle and then informed the father of the son 's last words and death .

 Late at night , the Royalist generals reached York , with many routed troops and stragglers . The Governor of York , Sir Thomas <unk> , allowed only those who were part of the garrison ( in effect , only a few officers who had participated in the battle as volunteers ) into the city , in case Parliamentarian cavalry entered the city on the heels of the fleeing Royalists . Many fugitives , including wounded , crowded the streets before Micklegate Bar , the western gate into the city . 
 Newcastle , having seen his forces broken and having spent his entire fortune in the Royalist cause , resolved that he would not endure the " laughter of the court " . He departed for Scarborough on the day after the battle ( 3 July ) and went into exile in Hamburg , with Eythin and many of his senior officers . Two days after the battle , Rupert rallied 5 @,@ 000 cavalry and a few hundred infantry whom he mounted on spare horses . He considered that rather than attempt to restore Royalist fortunes in the north , he was required to return south to rejoin the King . Leaving York by way of Monk Bar on the north east side , he marched back over the Pennines , making a detour to Richmond to escape interception . 
 At Marston Moor , Rupert had been decisively beaten for the first time in the war . He was deeply affected by the defeat , and kept the King 's ambiguous dispatch close to him for the remainder of his life . He had suffered an additional blow through the death during the battle of his dog " Boye " , who had been a constant companion by his side throughout his campaigns . Parliamentarian propaganda made much of this , treating Boye almost as a Devil 's familiar . 
 With the departure of Newcastle and Rupert , the Royalists effectively abandoned the north , except for isolated garrisons , which were reduced one by one over the next few months . The remnants of Byron 's troops were driven from Lancashire in August , and were involved in another Royalist disaster at the Relief of Montgomery Castle in Wales in September . The Royalist cavalry from the northern counties , the " Northern Horse " , continued to fight for Charles under Sir Marmaduke Langdale . They relieved a Royalist garrison at Pontefract Castle in south Yorkshire in February 1645 , but their undisciplined and licentious conduct turned many former sympathisers away from the Royalist cause . After being involved in the defeats of Charles at the battles of Naseby and Rowton Heath , they made a final attempt to reach Scotland and were routed at Sherburn @-@ in @-@ Elmet in October 1645 . 
 = = = Allies = = = 
 The victorious allies regrouped , although too slowly to intercept Rupert as he left York . Once the allied army had reformed ( and had been joined by Meldrum 's and Denbigh 's forces ) they resumed the siege of York . Without hope of relief , and under the agreement that no Scottish soldiers were to be quartered in the city , the garrison surrendered on honourable terms on 16 July . 
 Once York surrendered , the allied army soon dispersed . Leven took his troops north to besiege Newcastle upon Tyne and Carlisle . He sent dispatches to Scotland ordering that all runaways from the Covenanter regiments which broke at Marston Moor be returned , but not before every tenth deserter was hanged according to article 14 of Leven 's Articles of War . Once reunited with the Army of both Kingdoms , the remnants of the six broken regiments were put to base service such as latrine duties and the disposing of corpses until they got the chance to redeem themselves during the storm of Newcastle . Manchester 's army returned to Lincolnshire and eventually moved into the south of England to take part in the Second Battle of Newbury . 
 The Earl of Leven had again demonstrated the importance of disciplined infantry . Even as some of the newly levied allied regiments were routed by the Royalists , he had ensured he had enough veterans in reserve to replace them and overturn the early gains made by his opponents . Cromwell 's reputation as a cavalry commander was also firmly established at this battle . Despite attempts by his political rivals such as Denzil Holles and military critics such as Major General Lawrence Crawford to belittle the part he played , it was acknowledged that the discipline he had instilled into his troops and his own leadership on the battlefield had been crucial to the victory . Cromwell would later declare that Marston Moor was " an absolute victory obtained by God 's blessing " . From this moment , he was to exert increasing influence both in the House of Commons and in the Parliamentarian armies in the field . 
 However , the accounts published after the battle exacerbated the rifts which were already growing between the moderates and Presbyterians on the one hand and the Independents on the other . The noted Scottish theologian Robert Baillie wrote from Westminster only a few days later to one of his Independent brethren : 
 We were both grieved and angry , that your Independents there should have sent up Major Harrison to trumpet over all the city their own praises , to our prejudice , making all believe , that Cromwell alone , with his unspeakable valorous regiments , had done all that service : that most of us fled : and who stayed they fought so and so , as it might be . We were much vexed with these reports , against which yow were not pleased , any of yow to instruct us with any <unk> , till <unk> 's letters came at last , and captain Stewart with his <unk> . Then we sent abroad our printed relations , and could lift up our face . But within three days Mr Ashe 's relation was also printed , who gives us many good words , but gives much more to Cromwell than we are informed is his due … See by this inclosed , if the whole <unk> both in the right and left wing , be not ascribed to Cromwell , and not a word of David Lesley , who in all places that day was his leader . 
 = = = = Conduct of the allied generals = = = = 
 Much of the resulting many @-@ sided dispute among the Parliamentarians and Covenanters was prompted by accounts very soon after the battle that all three allied generals @-@ in @-@ chief had fled the field . The Earl of Manchester left the field but he subsequently rallied some infantry and returned , although he was able to exercise little control over events . 
 By some accounts , Lord Fairfax and Leven also fled the battlefield with their routed troops , but this has recently been challenged , certainly in Leven 's case . The most detailed account of Leven 's flight was written by the biographer of Lieutenant Colonel James Somerville , who was present at the battle as a volunteer . However , this second hand account was published only in 1679 , and has been challenged by previously unused eye witness accounts . These show most of the Covenanter infantry and cavalry units remained fighting until the end of the battle . As seven different eyewitnesses attested , they did so under the direction of Leven . For example , Simeon Ashe ( the Earl of Manchester 's chaplain ) noted that : 
 The Earl of Manchester ’ s new levied Forces began to give <unk> , the <unk> pursued our men , fell on again and gained two <unk> of ordnance there ; Rupert fell upon Sir Thomas Fairfaxes horse , and there was a very hot fight , many <unk> on both sides : our forces retreated , but <unk> our men again and General <unk> coming on with his foot , they fell on furiously , many were killed on both sides , and then the enemy beginning to retreat , our men followed pursuing and totally <unk> Rupert . 
 The enigmatic English reporter , " T. M. " , agreed that Leven still commanded the centre battalia after the initial rout : 
 The Lord of Hosts did so strike up the hearts of the three Noble Generals [ that God ] took boldness and courage unto them , gathering up those Horse Forces that were left into a body to assist those English and Scotts that stood to it , and set upon them , as David with his small Army upon the numerous company of the <unk> , while they were rejoicing over their spoils , and smote them until the evening .

 In 1971 the British band Electric Light Orchestra released a song titled " The Battle of Marston Moor ( July 2nd 1644 ) " . 
 = Cottingley Fairies = 
 The Cottingley Fairies appear in a series of five photographs taken by Elsie Wright ( 1901 – 88 ) and Frances Griffiths ( 1907 – 86 ) , two young cousins who lived in Cottingley , near Bradford in England . In 1917 , when the first two photographs were taken , Elsie was 16 years old and Frances was 9 . The pictures came to the attention of writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , who used them to illustrate an article on fairies he had been commissioned to write for the Christmas 1920 edition of The Strand Magazine . Doyle , as a spiritualist , was enthusiastic about the photographs , and interpreted them as clear and visible evidence of psychic phenomena . Public reaction was mixed ; some accepted the images as genuine , but others believed they had been faked . 
 Interest in the Cottingley Fairies gradually declined after 1921 . Both girls married and lived abroad for a time after they grew up , yet the photographs continued to hold the public imagination . In 1966 a reporter from the Daily Express newspaper traced Elsie , who had by then returned to the UK . Elsie left open the possibility that she believed she had photographed her thoughts , and the media once again became interested in the story . 
 In the early 1980s Elsie and Frances admitted that the photographs were faked , using cardboard cutouts of fairies copied from a popular children 's book of the time , but Frances maintained that the fifth and final photograph was genuine . The photographs and two of the cameras used are on display in the National Media Museum in Bradford , England . 
 = = 1917 photographs = = 
 In mid @-@ 1917 nine @-@ year @-@ old Frances Griffiths and her mother — both newly arrived in the UK from South Africa — were staying with Frances ' aunt , Elsie Wright 's mother , in the village of Cottingley in West Yorkshire ; Elsie was then 16 years old . The two girls often played together beside the beck ( stream ) at the bottom of the garden , much to their mothers ' annoyance , because they frequently came back with wet feet and clothes . Frances and Elsie said they only went to the beck to see the fairies , and to prove it , Elsie borrowed her father 's camera , a <unk> quarter @-@ plate . The girls returned about 30 minutes later , " triumphant " . 
 Elsie 's father , Arthur , was a keen amateur photographer , and had set up his own darkroom . The picture on the photographic plate he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground , on which four fairies appeared to be dancing . Knowing his daughter 's artistic ability , and that she had spent some time working in a photographer 's studio , he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts . Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again , and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a 1 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 30 cm ) gnome . Exasperated by what he believed to be " nothing but a prank " , and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way , Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again . His wife Polly , however , believed the photographs to be authentic . 
 Towards the end of 1918 , Frances sent a letter to Johanna Parvin , a friend in Cape Town , South Africa , where Frances had lived for most of her life , enclosing the photograph of herself with the fairies . On the back she wrote " It is funny , I never used to see them in Africa . It must be too hot for them there . " 
 The photographs became public in mid @-@ 1919 , after Elsie 's mother attended a meeting of the Theosophical Society in Bradford . The lecture that evening was on " fairy life " , and at the end of the meeting Polly Wright showed the two fairy photographs taken by her daughter and niece to the speaker . As a result , the photographs were displayed at the society 's annual conference in Harrogate , held a few months later . There they came to the attention of a leading member of the society , Edward Gardner . One of the central beliefs of theosophy is that humanity is undergoing a cycle of evolution , towards increasing " perfection " , and Gardner recognised the potential significance of the photographs for the movement : 
 ... the fact that two young girls had not only been able to see fairies , which others had done , but had actually for the first time ever been able to materialise them at a density sufficient for their images to be recorded on a photographic plate , meant that it was possible that the next cycle of evolution was underway . 
 = = Initial examinations = = 
 Gardner sent the prints along with the original glass @-@ plate negatives to Harold Snelling , a photography expert . Snelling 's opinion was that " the two negatives are entirely genuine , <unk> photographs ... [ with ] no trace whatsoever of studio work involving card or paper models " . He did not go so far as to say that the photographs showed fairies , stating only that " these are straight forward photographs of whatever was in front of the camera at the time " . Gardner had the prints " clarified " by Snelling , and new negatives produced , " more conducive to printing " , for use in the illustrated lectures he gave around the UK . Snelling supplied the photographic prints which were available for sale at Gardner 's lectures . 
 Author and prominent spiritualist Sir Arthur Conan Doyle learned of the photographs from the editor of the spiritualist publication Light . Doyle had been commissioned by The Strand Magazine to write an article on fairies for their Christmas issue , and the fairy photographs " must have seemed like a godsend " according to broadcaster and historian Magnus Magnusson . Doyle contacted Gardner in June 1920 to determine the background to the photographs , and wrote to Elsie and her father to request permission from the latter to use the prints in his article . Arthur Wright was " obviously impressed " that Doyle was involved , and gave his permission for publication , but he refused payment on the grounds that , if genuine , the images should not be " soiled " by money . 
 Gardner and Doyle sought a second expert opinion from the photographic company Kodak . Several of the company 's technicians examined the enhanced prints , and although they agreed with Snelling that the pictures " showed no signs of being faked " , they concluded that " this could not be taken as conclusive evidence ... that they were authentic photographs of fairies " . Kodak declined to issue a certificate of authenticity . Gardner believed that the Kodak technicians might not have examined the photographs entirely objectively , observing that one had commented " after all , as fairies couldn 't be true , the photographs must have been faked somehow " . The prints were also examined by another photographic company , Ilford , who reported unequivocally that there was " some evidence of faking " . Gardner and Doyle , perhaps rather optimistically , interpreted the results of the three expert evaluations as two in favour of the photographs ' authenticity and one against . 
 Doyle also showed the photographs to the physicist and pioneering psychical researcher Sir Oliver Lodge , who believed the photographs to be fake . He suggested that a troupe of dancers had masqueraded as fairies , and expressed doubt as to their " distinctly ' Parisienne ' " hairstyles . 
 = = 1920 photographs = = 
 Doyle was preoccupied with organising an imminent lecture tour of Australia , and in July 1920 , sent Gardner to meet the Wright family . Frances was by then living with her parents in Scarborough , but Elsie 's father told Gardner that he had been so certain the photographs were fakes that while the girls were away he searched their bedroom and the area around the beck ( stream ) , looking for scraps of pictures or cutouts , but found nothing " incriminating " . 
 Gardner believed the Wright family to be honest and respectable . To place the matter of the photographs ' authenticity beyond doubt , he returned to Cottingley at the end of July with two Kodak Cameo cameras and 24 secretly marked photographic plates . Frances was invited to stay with the Wright family during the school summer holiday so that she and Elsie could take more pictures of the fairies . Gardner described his briefing in his 1945 Fairies : A Book of Real Fairies : 
 I went off , to Cottingley again , taking the two cameras and plates from London , and met the family and explained to the two girls the simple working of the cameras , giving one each to keep . The cameras were loaded , and my final advice was that they need go up to the glen only on fine days as they had been accustomed to do before and <unk> the fairies , as they called their way of attracting them , and see what they could get . I suggested only the most obvious and easy precautions about lighting and distance , for I knew it was essential they should feel free and unhampered and have no burden of responsibility . If nothing came of it all , I told them , they were not to mind a bit . 
 Until 19 August the weather was unsuitable for photography . Because Frances and Elsie insisted that the fairies would not show themselves if others were watching , Elsie 's mother was persuaded to visit her sister 's for tea , leaving the girls alone . In her absence the girls took several photographs , two of which appeared to show fairies . In the first , Frances and the Leaping Fairy , Frances is shown in profile with a winged fairy close by her nose . The second , Fairy offering Posy of <unk> to Elsie , shows a fairy either hovering or tiptoeing on a branch , and offering Elsie a flower . Two days later the girls took the last picture , Fairies and Their Sun @-@ Bath . 
 The plates were packed in cotton wool and returned to Gardner in London , who sent an " ecstatic " telegram to Doyle , by then in Melbourne . Doyle wrote back : 
 My heart was gladdened when out here in far Australia I had your note and the three wonderful pictures which are confirmatory of our published results . When our fairies are admitted other psychic phenomena will find a more ready acceptance ... We have had continued messages at <unk> for some time that a visible sign was coming through . 
 = = Publication and reaction = = 
 Doyle 's article in the December 1920 issue of The Strand contained two higher @-@ resolution prints of the 1917 photographs , and sold out within days of publication . To protect the girls ' anonymity , Frances and Elsie were called Alice and Iris respectively , and the Wright family was referred to as the " Carpenters " . An enthusiastic and committed spiritualist , Doyle hoped that if the photographs convinced the public of the existence of fairies then they might more readily accept other psychic phenomena . He ended his article with the words : 
 The recognition of their existence will jolt the material twentieth century mind out of its heavy ruts in the mud , and will make it admit that there is a glamour and mystery to life . Having discovered this , the world will not find it so difficult to accept that spiritual message supported by physical facts which has already been put before it . 
 Early press coverage was " mixed " , generally a combination of " embarrassment and puzzlement " . The historical novelist and poet Maurice Hewlett published a series of articles in the literary journal John O ' London 's Weekly , in which he concluded : " And knowing children , and knowing that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has legs , I decide that the Miss Carpenters have pulled one of them . " The Sydney newspaper Truth on 5 January 1921 expressed a similar view ; " For the true explanation of these fairy photographs what is wanted is not a knowledge of occult phenomena but a knowledge of children . " Some public figures were more sympathetic . Margaret McMillan , the educational and social reformer , wrote : " How wonderful that to these dear children such a wonderful gift has been vouchsafed . " The novelist Henry De Vere <unk> decided to take the fairy photographs and the girls at face value . In a letter to Gardner he wrote : " Look at Alice 's [ Frances ' ] face . Look at Iris 's [ Elsie 's ] face . There is an extraordinary thing called Truth which has 10 million faces and forms – it is God 's currency and the cleverest coiner or forger can 't imitate it . " 
 Major John Hall @-@ Edwards , a keen photographer and pioneer of medical X @-@ ray treatments in Britain , was a particularly vigorous critic : 
 On the evidence I have no hesitation in saying that these photographs could have been " faked " . I criticize the attitude of those who declared there is something supernatural in the circumstances attending to the taking of these pictures because , as a medical man , I believe that the inculcation of such absurd ideas into the minds of children will result in later life in manifestations and nervous disorder and mental disturbances . 
 Doyle used the later photographs in 1921 to illustrate a second article in The Strand , in which he described other accounts of fairy sightings . The article formed the foundation for his 1922 book The Coming of the Fairies . As before , the photographs were received with mixed credulity . Sceptics noted that the fairies " looked suspiciously like the traditional fairies of nursery tales " and that they had " very fashionable hairstyles " . 
 = = Gardner 's final visit = = 
 Gardner made a final visit to Cottingley in August 1921 . He again brought cameras and photographic plates for Frances and Elsie , but was accompanied by the clairvoyant Geoffrey Hodson . Although neither of the girls claimed to see any fairies , and there were no more photographs , " on the contrary , he [ Hodson ] saw them [ fairies ] everywhere " and wrote voluminous notes on his observations . 
 By now Elsie and Frances were tired of the whole fairy business . Years later Elsie looked at a photograph of herself and Frances taken with Hodson and said : " Look at that , fed up with fairies . " Both Elsie and Frances later admitted that they " played along " with Hodson " out of mischief " , and that they considered him " a fake " . 
 = = Later investigations = = 
 Public interest in the Cottingley Fairies gradually subsided after 1921 . Elsie and Frances eventually married and lived abroad for many years . In 1966 , a reporter from the Daily Express newspaper traced Elsie , who was by then back in England . She admitted in an interview given that year that the fairies might have been " figments of my imagination " , but left open the possibility she believed that she had somehow managed to photograph her thoughts . The media subsequently became interested in Frances and Elsie 's photographs once again . BBC television 's Nationwide programme investigated the case in 1971 , but Elsie stuck to her story : " I 've told you that they 're photographs of figments of our imagination , and that 's what I 'm sticking to " . 
 Elsie and Frances were interviewed by journalist Austin Mitchell in September 1976 , for a programme broadcast on Yorkshire Television . When pressed , both women agreed that " a rational person doesn 't see fairies " , but they denied having fabricated the photographs . In 1978 the magician and scientific sceptic James Randi and a team from the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal examined the photographs , using a " computer enhancement process " . They concluded that the photographs were fakes , and that strings could be seen supporting the fairies . Geoffrey Crawley , editor of the British Journal of Photography , undertook a " major scientific investigation of the photographs and the events surrounding them " , published between 1982 and 1983 , " the first major postwar analysis of the affair " . He also concluded that the pictures were fakes . 
 = = Confession = = 
 In 1983 , the cousins admitted in an article published in the magazine The Unexplained that the photographs had been faked , although both maintained that they really had seen fairies . Elsie had copied illustrations of dancing girls from a popular children 's book of the time , Princess Mary 's Gift Book , published in 1914 , and drew wings on them . They said they had then cut out the cardboard figures and supported them with <unk> , disposing of their props in the beck once the photograph had been taken . But the cousins disagreed about the fifth and final photograph , which Doyle in his The Coming of the Fairies described in this way : 
 Seated on the upper left hand edge with wing well displayed is an undraped fairy apparently considering whether it is time to get up . An earlier riser of more mature age is seen on the right possessing abundant hair and wonderful wings . Her slightly denser body can be glimpsed within her fairy dress . 
 Elsie maintained it was a fake , just like all the others , but Frances insisted that it was genuine . In an interview given in the early 1980s Frances said : 
 It was a wet Saturday afternoon and we were just <unk> about with our cameras and Elsie had nothing prepared . I saw these fairies building up in the grasses and just aimed the camera and took a photograph . 
 Both Frances and Elsie claimed to have taken the fifth photograph . In a letter published in The Times newspaper on 9 April 1983 , Geoffrey Crawley explained the discrepancy by suggesting that the photograph was " an unintended double exposure of fairy cutouts in the grass " , and thus " both ladies can be quite sincere in believing that they each took it " . 
 In a 1985 interview on Yorkshire Television 's Arthur C. Clarke 's World of Strange Powers , Elsie said that she and Frances were too embarrassed to admit the truth after fooling Doyle , the author of Sherlock Holmes : " Two village kids and a brilliant man like Conan Doyle – well , we could only keep quiet . " In the same interview Frances said : " I never even thought of it as being a fraud – it was just Elsie and I having a bit of fun and I can 't understand to this day why they were taken in – they wanted to be taken in . "

 Frances died in 1986 , and Elsie in 1988 . Prints of their photographs of the fairies , along with a few other items including a first edition of Doyle 's book The Coming of the Fairies , were sold at auction in London for £ 21 @,@ 620 in 1998 . That same year , Geoffrey Crawley sold his Cottingley Fairy material to the National Museum of Film , Photography and Television in Bradford ( now the National Media Museum ) , where it is on display . The collection included prints of the photographs , two of the cameras used by the girls , watercolours of fairies painted by Elsie , and a nine @-@ page letter from Elsie admitting to the hoax . The glass photographic plates were bought for £ 6 @,@ 000 by an unnamed buyer at a London auction held in 2001 . 
 Frances ' daughter , Christine Lynch , appeared in an episode of the television programme Antiques Roadshow in Belfast , broadcast on BBC One in January 2009 , with the photographs and one of the cameras given to the girls by Doyle . Christine told the expert , Paul Atterbury , that she believed , as her mother had done , that the fairies in the fifth photograph were genuine . Atterbury estimated the value of the items at between £ 25 @,@ 000 and £ 30 @,@ 000 . The first edition of Frances ' memoirs was published a few months later , under the title Reflections on the Cottingley Fairies . The book contains correspondence , sometimes " bitter " , between Elsie and Frances . In one letter , dated 1983 , Frances wrote : 
 I hated those photographs from the age of 16 when Mr Gardner presented me with a bunch of flowers and wanted me to sit on the platform [ at a Theosophical Society meeting ] with him . I realised what I was in for if I did not keep myself hidden . 
 The 1997 films <unk> : A True Story and Photographing Fairies were inspired by the events surrounding the Cottingley Fairies . The photographs were parodied in a 1994 book written by Terry Jones and Brian Froud , Lady Cottington 's Pressed Fairy Book .

It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on May 11 , 1997 and in the United Kingdom on BBC One on February 25 , 1998 . It was written by R. W. Goodwin and directed by Kim Manners . The episode helps explore the series ' overarching mythology . " Demons " received a Nielsen rating of 11 @.@ 8 , being watched by 19 @.@ 1 million viewers in its initial broadcast . The episode received mostly positive reviews from television critics , with many complimenting the episode 's look in Mulder 's mind . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In this episode , Mulder wakes up in a hotel with blood all over him and no memory what happened . Mulder and Scully soon discover that Mulder was involved in a double homicide and may have been the killer . It is soon revealed that Mulder had been seeing a doctor who had allowed him to view glimpses of his past memories . After evidence becomes paramount , Mulder is cleared of the murder charges . 
 The episode was written by R. W. Goodwin , an executive producer and director for the show . This marked the second instance where a member of the production crew wrote an episode , after the third season entry " Wetwired " , written by Mat Beck . The episode was influenced by An Anthropologist on Mars , a series of essays by Oliver Sacks , in particular The Landscape of Dreams featuring a man who could recall every detail of his childhood . During the flashback sequences in the episode , various effects were created by manipulating the camera and its film . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Fox Mulder 's ( David Duchovny ) mind flashes back to being in the attic with his sister Samantha while their parents are arguing downstairs . Back in the present , Mulder awakens in a hotel room in Providence , Rhode Island , covered in blood . Mulder calls Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) , who arrives , finding him in shock . Mulder has a pounding headache and has no memory of what he has done in the past two days . Scully finds that two bullets have been fired from Mulder 's gun and that he has keys belonging to a David and Amy Cassandra . Scully wants Mulder to check into a hospital , but he wants to find out if he was involved in a crime before doing so . The agents arrive at the Cassandra 's house where the housekeeper tells them they are not at home . Mulder recognizes a house in many of Cassandra 's paintings : a house that is near his parent 's summer home in Rhode Island . When they arrive there , Mulder has striking pains in his head and flashes back again to when he was a child , seeing a younger version of The Smoking Man ( Chris Owens ) in his home . The agents enter the home , where they find the Cassandras dead from gunshot wounds . 
 The agents call the police , who take Mulder with them due to the circumstantial evidence against him . Scully performs an autopsy on Amy Cassandra , finding a scab on her forehead . The detective in charge of the case tells Mulder that they have found David and Amy 's blood on his shirt . Mulder refuses to confess to the murders , not remembering anything . Scully arrives , saying she found in Amy 's blood traces of ketamine , an <unk> substance that has hallucinogenic properties . The substance was detected in Mulder 's blood as well . Meanwhile , one of the officers at the station kills himself ; he has similar symptoms to that of the Cassandras . Mulder suffers a seizure and flashes back to his childhood again , witnessing his parents arguing with The Smoking Man . Scully sees Mulder the next day , telling him that she believes that the Cassandras killed themselves after receiving psychiatric treatment and that Mulder was visiting them about their alien abduction experiences . 
 The agents visit Dr. Goldstein in Warwick , Rhode Island , who was treating Amy with an aggressive method to help her recover her abduction memories . Goldstein also treated the police officer , but says he has not met Mulder before . Mulder has another painful flashback of The Smoking Man arguing with his mother , Teena Mulder . Mulder declines Scully 's request that he go to the hospital and goes to visit his mother , demanding she explain what really happened when they had to make a choice between him and Samantha . Mulder believes that The Smoking Man forced them to take Samantha . Mulder also questions who his father really is . Mulder 's mother gets upset and refuses to provide him answers . Later Mulder visits Goldstein , and convinces him to again treat him so he will remember what really happened . Mulder has further visions of the past . Scully and the police arrive soon after to arrest Goldstein but find Mulder gone . Scully finds him at the family 's summer home in Rhode Island and is able to calm him down . While Mulder is cleared in the deaths of the Cassandras , what truly happened when he was a child remains a mystery .

 The episode was written by R. W. Goodwin , an executive producer and director for the show . This was the second instance where a member of the production crew wrote an episode , the first being Mat Beck 's " Wetwired " . Goodwin was inspired to write the episode after reading An Anthropologist on Mars , a series of essays by Oliver Sacks , in particular The Landscape of Dreams featuring a man who could recall every detail of his childhood . Goodwin came up with the idea of having Fox Mulder waking up in a strange place with no idea how he got there . After receiving approval from series creator Chris Carter , Goodwin spent approximately six weeks writing the episode . 
 The episode helped to elaborate the backstory of The Smoking Man , the series ' chief antagonist . William B. Davis , the actor who played the character , later noted , " As the story developed , we developed a relationship between Cigarette @-@ Smoking Man and Mulder 's apparent father , and Cigarette @-@ Smoking Man and Mulder 's mother ; then we started <unk> with an historical connection . " Carter explained that the episode was the start of the series ' greater conspiracy : " It 's an interesting development because it really was the development of the conspiracy . The elements of the conspiracy were part of his development . But [ The Smoking Man 's ] back story , of course , intertwined with Mulder 's . " Actor Chris Owens reprised his role as The Smoking Man ; he had previously played him in the season 's earlier episode " Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man " . 
 The crux of the episode relied on the idea that <unk> syndrome — the ability to recall every memory of one 's younger life — could be incurred via a combination of technology and drugs , a situation that is certainly not supported by modern medicine . Goodwin , however , himself admitted that this was completely a creative license he took with the disorder . In addition , he also based a majority of Dr. Goldstein 's equipment on various New Age equipment , including a " brain stimulator " .

 The home where the Cassandras were murdered was filmed at a farmhouse in South Surrey , near locations used for filming the episodes " Home " and " Tunguska " . The farmhouse was rented and refurbished by the show 's art department , although this restoration was only used for pre @-@ production photographs and the farmhouse was returned to its original state for the actual filming . The paintings of the house were created with Adobe Photoshop and Fractal Painter . 
 During the flashback sequences in the episode , various effects were created by manipulating the camera and its film . The camera 's shuttering mechanism was " continuously stopped and started " to give the scene an " out @-@ of @-@ time " feel . A majority of the effects were created in post @-@ production .

" He did write , however , that he was " a little disappointed at how " Demons " doesn 't really hold up in retrospect from a story perspective , " but noted that " what does work here is great . " John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode an 8 out of 10 and wrote , " Overall , this episode continued to strip away , in methodical fashion , Mulder ’ s psychological support system . [ … ] While there are some plot contrivances that are troubling , the episode as a whole comes together very well . " Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four . She wrote that " Demons " works " as a character study of Mulder " and praised the episode 's " hyper @-@ realistic flashback " sequences . Vitaris , while calling the structure of the story " not particularly imaginative " , wrote that " Mulder 's condition is intriguing " . Not all reviews were positive . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five , calling it " the wrong episode at the wrong time . " The two argued that the attention given to Mulder 's potential " aneurysm " are oddly juxtaposed next to Scully 's real , life @-@ threatening brain cancer . However , they did call the flashback sequences " masterpieces of editing " , but noted that their contents " lack [ ed ] information " .

Principal Sue Sylvester ( Jane Lynch ) announces her intention to marry herself , and glee club member Sam Evans ( Chord Overstreet ) tells fellow member Quinn Fabray ( Dianna Agron ) that he loves her and would like to marry her in the future , by offering her a promise ring . 
 Kurt is menaced by school bully Dave Karofsky ( Max Adler ) and badly shaken ; while Sue sympathizes with Kurt 's plight , she can only punish Karofsky if he physically attacks Kurt . Glee club co @-@ captain Rachel Berry ( Lea Michele ) convinces the glee club girls to have their football @-@ playing boyfriends defend Kurt , but her own boyfriend , Finn , refuses , concerned that it may jeopardize his position as quarterback .

He instigates a meeting with Sue , Karofsky 's father ( Daniel Roebuck ) and the two boys , at which Sue expels Karofsky . 
 The day of the wedding , Santana Lopez ( Naya Rivera ) , who wants another chance at Finn , suggests that he reveal that they had sex to boost his popularity at school . He is unwilling to do so , as he truly loves Rachel , who recently admitted to him that she lied when she claimed to have slept with her then @-@ boyfriend Jesse ( Jonathan Groff ) ; Finn also lied at the same time , by saying he never had sex with Santana . 
 At the wedding , New Directions perform " Marry You " by Bruno Mars as they , and then Burt and Carole , dance down the aisle , after which the two of them marry . During the reception , Finn uses his best man speech as an opportunity to apologize to Kurt for not defending him , and promises to do so in the future ; he announces that Finn and Kurt are now " Furt " . He and the other glee club members dedicate a performance of Mars ' " Just the Way You Are " to Kurt , and the new stepbrothers dance together . Following the wedding , Kurt and his parents learn that the school board has reversed Karofsky 's expulsion and given him a verbal warning , thus allowing him to return to school . Sue resigns as principal in protest , and Burt and Carole use their honeymoon savings to enroll Kurt at Dalton Academy , which has a zero @-@ tolerance policy against bullying and is also the school that Kurt 's friend Blaine ( Darren Criss ) attends . 
 While the Hummel – Hudson wedding is being arranged , Sue advances her own marriage plans . She is surprised when her mother arrives in town . Doris ( Carol Burnett ) , a recently retired Nazi hunter who was an absentee parent to Sue and her sister Jean ( Robin Trocki ) , attempts to make amends for her long absence , but is nevertheless so critical of her daughter that Sue calls her a bully and <unk> her during the wedding rehearsal . Doris leaves , and Sue and Jean comfort each other .

 Sue 's parents were mentioned and their occupations as Nazi hunters revealed in the season one episode " The Power of Madonna " . According to Lynch , Sue 's mother left her two daughters to pursue her career , and returns home retired after the last Nazi has been captured . On working with Burnett , Lynch said , " I 'm a little nervous , but I can 't wait to get in scenes with her ... It 's like playing tennis with a master . " The origin behind Sue 's antagonistic personality was explored in this episode ; plans at the time were for Burnett to reappear on the series in a future episode . This is Burnett 's and Lynch 's second time working together , the first being the 2009 comedy film Post Grad . 
 In an interview after BAFTA / LA 's Brittania Awards , Lynch told People a wedding was in the future for her character . A tracksuit wedding dress was created by personal costume designer Ali Rahimi . 
 Recurring characters in this episode include glee club members Mike Chang and Sam Evans , cheerleader Becky Jackson ( Lauren Potter ) , athlete and school bully Dave Karofsky , football coach Shannon Beiste ( Dot @-@ Marie Jones ) , and local news anchors Rod Remington ( Bill A. Jones ) and Andrea Carmichael ( Earlene Davis ) . In addition , Rosemont and Burnett star as Carole and Doris , the respective mothers of Finn and Sue , and Daniel Roebuck plays Karofsky 's father , Paul . 
 Four songs were covered on the episode and were all released as singles available for digital download . The song " Ohio " from the 1953 musical Wonderful Town was covered as a duet between Burnett and Lynch .

Additionally , two Bruno Mars songs were featured — " Just the Way You Are " and " Marry You " — as well as Pablo Beltrán Ruiz 's " Sway " as covered by Michael Bublé . All songs except " Ohio " are included on the album Glee : The Music , Volume 4 .

 " Furt " received a generally positive reception from critics , though there were some dissenting viewpoints . Meghan Brown of The Atlantic wrote that the episode " worked beautifully . " The A.V. Club 's Todd VanDerWerff called it a " largely terrific episode of television " , and gave it a " B + " . Lisa Respers France of CNN was reminded of " how well this show marries plot with music " , and Rolling Stone 's Erica Futterman concluded , " The focus on the show 's best characters , Kurt and Sue , kept the show balanced between heart and bite — just the way we like our Glee " . IGN 's Robert Canning was less enthusiastic ; he called it an " unfocused jumble of an episode " and gave it a score of 7 out of 10 . The BuddyTV reviewers were split , with Jen Harper quite happy , and John Kubicek who wrote that he hated the entire episode . 
 Most reviews heaped praise on the guest appearance of Carol Burnett , who played Sue 's Nazi @-@ hunting absentee mother Doris . Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle said Burnett was a " well @-@ used guest star " , and he " loved every minute she was on screen . " Dave Itzkoff of the New York Times asked " who could not be charmed " by Burnett , and the Wall Street Journal 's Raymund Flandez lauded the " tour @-@ de @-@ force panache and sharp @-@ tongued deadpan by Carol Burnett " , and called her appearance the " best guest casting this season " . 
 The marriage of Burt Hummel and Carole Hudson received generally good marks . VanDerWerff wrote , " it 's rare that an episode of television can make a hurried wedding between two middle @-@ aged people who are rarely on the show into something so well @-@ conceived and thrillingly moving . " Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times noted , " Every character in that family rings emotionally true . " Entertainment Weekly 's Tim Stack was pleased with the performances of Mike O ’ Malley as Burt and Romy Rosemont as Carole ; he also welcomed the episode 's increased focus on Finn , and praised Cory Monteith as a " good , natural actor " . Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic was unhappy with both weddings , and Canning said they " took up most of this episode , and unfortunately neither were entirely successful " . Several reviewers noted the " homage " of the wedding procession dance , including Hankinson , Anthony Benigno of the Daily News and Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post ; the Wall Street Journal invited readers to compare the original viral " JK Wedding Entrance Dance " YouTube video and the subsequent dancing procession from the " Niagara " episode of The Office with Glee 's version in " Furt " , while Stack made his own comparison , and said Glee 's was " just about as good " as the original , and " a blast to watch " . 
 Sue Sylvester 's marriage to herself was lambasted by many critics , including Vanity Fair 's Brett Berk , who said it " was about as compelling as a hair lollipop " . Patrick Burns of The Atlantic was also unimpressed , especially " because the main plot points of this episode are otherwise so effective " ; his colleague Fallon was brief and to the point : " <unk> . " 
 There was disagreement on the bullying storyline . Some critics , including Canning and Hankinson , praised it , while others had reservations , such as Brown , who characterized it as " heavy @-@ handed " , and Fallon , who considered it " well @-@ acted " but " far too stagnant " . The Sam and Quinn storyline was panned by VanDerWerff , who wrote " the series has wasted whatever chemistry the two had in ' Duets ' on scenes where Sam talks about how he wants to be the most popular kid in school " , and by Kubicek , who criticized the lack of consistency in Sam 's characterization . 
 = = = Music and performances = = = 
 The musical performances and cover versions in the episode attracted generally positive reviews , though a few reviewers noted that the program had been on for twenty @-@ three minutes before the first song appeared . While Fallon said it was an " interminable wait " for the first musical number , " Ohio " , and Reiter cited the delay as flaw , James Poniewozik of Time thought it a " credit to the episode " that he had not noticed the absence of music to that point . Flandez and Futterman commented favorably on all the musical numbers , though Canning felt the songs were a " disappointing aspect of this episode " , and none were " exceptionally memorable " . 
 The duet of Burnett and Lynch on " Ohio " was well received . Jean Bentley of AOL TV praised it as " simply magnificent " , Zap2it 's Hanh Nguyen called it a " fantastic job " and Flandez said it was " lovely " and that " the bickering interlude was a delight . " Others tempered their praise : Berk gave it three of five stars and noted the " bland staging " , and Benigno graded it a " C " and called it " boring " , though he said " their voices work well " together ; Stack gave it a " B + " with the caveat that it was " a little too theatrical " . 
 The dancing wedding procession and its accompanying performance of the Bruno Mars song " Marry You " were mostly praised . Stack gave it an " A " and Berk five stars out of five , and Amanda Hensel of AOL Music called it " easily one of the best performances of the season " . Benigno gave it a " B " primarily because the cast didn 't " do anything particularly interesting with it " vocally , but called the performance " pure joy " . Flandez wrote that " two Bruno Mars songs that were brilliant in execution and touching in sentiment " , and Futterman agreed : " the Bruno Mars songs gave the show two of its best performances this season " . While Benigno and Stack also praised " Just the Way You Are " , and both gave the song an " A " , Harper thought Monteith 's vocals as Finn " aren 't the strongest " and Bentley also wished Finn had not been the soloist . Additionally , Harper criticized the failure of the show to adjust the song 's pronouns from feminine to masculine when Finn was singing to Kurt , and noted that Gwyneth Paltrow had changed pronouns while singing Cee Lo Green 's " Forget You " the week before . Hankinson was more impressed with " Just the Way You Are " , and gave it a " slight edge " over " Marry You " for the episode 's " best musical number " , " given the emotional context " . 
 Matthew Morrison 's performance of " Sway " received the most divergent opinions . Some reviewers mentioned how closely it resembled Michael Bublé 's version : Benigno graded it " A- " and said " Matthew Morrison sounds EXACTLY like Bublé here , which is both unbelievably impressive ( Bublé 's got some pipes on him ) , and takes a little bit away from the number ( easy to write it off as an impression ) " , Stack gave it a " B " and characterized it as " pretty simple , but Matthew Morrison does a mean Michael Bublé " , and Bentley called it " a perfectly fine cover " , though Futterman said it " can ’ t beat Michael Bublé ’ s take " . Among those who did not compare Morrison to Bublé , Hensel called it a " beautiful solo performance " , while Berk gave it two stars out of five and wrote " Shue sings it just like a real wedding singer " , and Nguyen said the song felt " out of place " .

He tries to browbeat Darryl into staying with Dunder @-@ Mifflin by tallying up his perceived job failures since taking the Athlead job and holding a meeting on customer loyalty with a customer he describes as " enraged " , but who demurs at the characterization . When this is ineffective , Dwight joins Darryl 's delivery run to make the job more " fun . " One attempt at being more fun is to order a milkshake at a fast food drive @-@ through and throw it at the server , shouting " Fire in the hole ! " Morally outraged , Darryl forces Dwight to stay behind and clean up the mess , whereupon another customer pulls the same prank on Dwight himself . Darryl later laughs at footage of the event that has been uploaded onto the internet , saying that this is what he will miss when he moves to Philadelphia . 
 Nellie Bertram ( Catherine Tate ) assigns Erin Hannon ( Ellie Kemper ) and Pete Miller ( Jake Lacy ) to a social media project that meets with some success . She notices the two 's flirting with each other for the first time and assumes that she brought it on with the project , citing several unintentional double entendres in her project e @-@ mails .

Nellie also ends the social media project so they will not be able to flirt . Shamed by Nellie 's fidelity speech , Erin assumes a coldly professional attitude towards Pete . However , a talk with Toby Flenderson ( Paul Lieberstein ) reminds Nellie that Andy was not the best boyfriend to Erin and Nellie has second thoughts .

Jim calls her that evening to tell her the investor backed out , and his group will have to work long hours to make up the lost funds . He asks her to send him her recording of the recital as a way to cheer him up , and Pam confesses that she did not tape it . She tries to make light of the mishap by making self @-@ deprecating remarks and pointing out that they can get recordings of the recital from other attendees , but he becomes frustrated at her , scolding her and starting a fight over his new job , the time he spends away from the family , and the sacrifices they are making to get their new life to work . After he hangs up , Pam breaks down in tears . A previously unseen boom operator named Brian ( Chris Diamantopoulos ) enters into the shot and comforts her , and tells the crew to stop filming .

 " Customer Loyalty " was written by co @-@ executive producers Jonathan Green and Gabe Miller , their second writing credit for the series after " Andy 's Ancestry " . It was directed by Kelly Cantley , making her television directorial debut ; Cantley previously served as a first assistant director on the series and directed The Office webisode series The Mentor . 
 The episode is the first of the series to actively feature a member of the documentary crew interacting with the characters on screen ; before the episode was aired , showrunner Greg Daniels stated that this episode would begin to reveal who was behind the documentary . Originally , the idea to have a sound man named Brian comfort Pam when she was crying was proposed by former series actress and writer Mindy Kaling . According to an interview with B.J. Novak , she had proposed it during the show 's third season . The episode guest stars Chris Diamantopoulos as Brian the boom operator . Brian 's character is named after the series ' actual boom mic operator , Brian <unk> . <unk> played the part of one of the annoyed parents at Cece 's recital . Ben Silverman also appears as Issac , one of Jim 's coworkers at Athlead . This marks Silverman 's third appearance , after <unk> in the episodes " Here Comes Treble " and " Suit Warehouse " . 
 The cold open features a montage of Jim setting up a prank — which involves sending Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail . Through Jim 's voice @-@ over , it is heavily suggested that Jim set up the prank sometime circa 2006 , which would have taken place during the show 's second season . Appropriately , the montage was filmed to look as if the documentarians were using archival footage of Jim ; his hair matches the style that Jim had during the first few seasons of the show . This is not the first time this technique has been used on the show . During the cold open for the sixth season episode " Shareholder Meeting " , a montage of Dwight harassing past receptionists was shown . Furthermore , during the seventh season episode " Threat Level Midnight " , there is a short sequence that was shot to look as if it had been filmed during the show 's second season , although the scene itself was filmed in 2011 .

 " Customer Loyalty " received largely positive reviews from television critics . James Poniewozik of Time magazine concluded that it " showed the stakes behind its characters ’ paper @-@ pushing lives in a way it hasn ’ t since Michael Scott left Scranton . " He called the first half a " wacky ensemble show " , but said that the last part featured elements that allowed the audience to " all but hear the old machinery [ of earlier episodes ] waking up and sliding into place " . Poniewozik stated that Jim and Pam 's fight was " believable in its arc and its parameters " and that both characters were presented in a way in which their plights were understandable . Ally <unk> of Hollywood.com wrote that the " episode was one worth tuning in for . " She felt that , for fans of the show who had left when Steve Carell departed , " Customer Loyalty " was the right episode for them to come back to the series . She called the fight between Jim and Pam " jarring in and of itself " . Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald commented on the fight between Jim and Pam , writing that it " felt just like the kind of argument that two real people would have . " Brett Harrison Davinger of the California Literary Review wrote that the episode was " fine " and was composed of " several small storylines , all of which worked " . Davinger called the ending " odd " but " effective " . 
 Michael Tedder of Vulture wrote positively of the episode and awarded it four out of five stars . He called the final fight between Pam and Jim " ugly and real " and one in which " the writers didn 't flinch " , in that it truly made him feel uncomfortable . Tedder complimented both Fischer and Krasinski , and wrote that Krasinski " doesn 't try to make Jim look charming in this fight , just terrified and exhausted . " He called Nellie 's subplot " the best use of this new version of Nellie " , but wrote that Dwight and Darryl 's subplot was undeveloped . Rick Porter of Zap2it felt that , while the episode was " up and down " ( he wrote that Dwight and Darryl 's subplot was " flat " , but that Erin and Pete 's yielded several humorous lines ) the final confrontation between Jim and Pam was " a big dose of reality " and that it was not " a contrived fight " . David Wilcox of The Citizen wrote that the fight between Pam and Jim was " welcome " because their relationship had grown stale ever since they had " hooked up and started living their perfect little lives together . " Wilcox praised the way in which the fight was written , and wrote that he " couldn 't help smiling . Not because the fight wasn 't wrenching to watch . But because it was . " Cindy White of IGN awarded the episode a 7 @.@ 8 out of 10 , denoting a " good " episode . She reasoned that while the episode was funny but largely forgettable , the final scene made it worth watching . 
 Not all reviews were as positive . Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a " C + " , and called it " a middle @-@ of @-@ the @-@ road table @-@ setting episode of The Office " with a " tacked @-@ on coda " . Adams wrote that the episode was " not really a ' story ' at all " because it was dragged down by elements that are necessary for the episode to play as a standalone piece , even though " it ’ s not meant to be taken as " one . Adams was complimentary towards the episode 's cold open but wrote that " there aren ’ t a whole lot of quality laughs in ' Customer Loyalty ' " . Nick Campbell of TV.com felt that the Erin and Pete relationship was not constructed properly , nor was the conclusion satisfying . Furthermore , he felt that the ending fight was " petty " . 
 Many reviews commented on the reveal of the documentary crew . E ! Online named the reveal one of the " Best TV Moments of the Week " . Verne Gay of Newsday called the scene a " historic " moment for the show . <unk> wrote that , between Jim and Pam fighting , and the cameramen making an appearance , the scene was " a lot to take in " . However , she felt that the scene was properly done . Jason Hughes of The Huffington Post called the reveal a " huge " and " shocking " moment . Tedder called the reveal " something that we 've never seen before on The Office . " He admitted that , " the last five minutes of this episode genuinely startled me , which is an impressive feat for a series on its ninth and final season . " Porter called the shots with Brian " good " because it reaffirmed that the camera crew was a character , one that had been an integral part of the show . Wilcox wrote that Brian 's appearance was a " weird turn " , and that it was " kind of funny " that the first time a member of the camera crew intervened with the characters was when Pam needed comforting and not " one of Dwight or Michael 's dozens of near @-@ death experiences . " Poniewozik enjoyed the reveal of the documentary crew . However , he wrote that , " I don ’ t know if I ’ m going to like the idea of making Brian an actual player in the events , if indeed that ’ s where the show is going . " Adams , on the other hand , said that the reveal of the cameramen was " a Big Moment for The Office , but it has a hollow ring to it " because the cameramen had never before interacted with the members of the office before . Campbell wrote that " the show played its documentary crew trump card WAY [ sic ] too early " and noted that the crew had never intervened in past events that were on the same level as Pam crying . 
 = Mesoscale convective system = 
 A mesoscale convective system ( MCS ) is a complex of thunderstorms that becomes organized on a scale larger than the individual thunderstorms but smaller than extratropical cyclones , and normally persists for several hours or more . A mesoscale convective system 's overall cloud and precipitation pattern may be round or linear in shape , and include weather systems such as tropical cyclones , squall lines , lake @-@ effect snow events , polar lows , and Mesoscale Convective Complexes ( MCCs ) , and generally form near weather fronts . The type that forms during the warm season over land has been noted across North America , Europe , and Asia , with a maximum in activity noted during the late afternoon and evening hours . 
 Forms of MCS that develop within the tropics use either the Intertropical Convergence Zone or monsoon troughs as a focus for their development , generally within the warm season between spring and fall . One exception is that of lake @-@ effect snow bands , which form due to cold air moving across relatively warm bodies of water , and occurs from fall through spring . Polar lows are a second special class of MCS which form at high latitudes during the cold season . Once the parent MCS dies , later thunderstorm development can occur in connection with its remnant mesoscale convective vortex ( MCV ) . Mesoscale convective systems are important to the United States rainfall climatology over the Great Plains since they bring the region about half of their annual warm season rainfall . 
 = = Definition = = 
 Mesoscale convective systems are thunderstorm regions which may be round or linear in shape , on the order of 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) or more across in one direction but smaller than extratropical cyclones , and include systems such as tropical cyclones , squall lines , and Mesoscale Convective Complexes ( MCCs ) , among others . MCS is a more generalized term which includes systems that do not satisfy the stricter size , shape , or duration criteria of an MCC . They tend to form near weather fronts and move into areas of 1000 @-@ 500 mb thickness diffluence , which are areas where the low to mid level temperature gradient broadens , which generally steers the thunderstorm clusters into the warm sector of extratropical cyclones , or equatorward of warm fronts . They can also form along any convergent zones within the tropics . Their formation has been noted worldwide , from the Mei @-@ Yu front in the far East to the deep tropics . Mesoscale convective systems are important to the United States rainfall climatology over the Great Plains since they bring the region about half of their annual warm season rainfall .

 = = = Mesoscale Convective Complex = = = 
 A mesoscale convective complex ( MCC ) is a unique kind of mesoscale convective system which is defined by characteristics observed in infrared satellite imagery . Their area of cold cloud tops exceeds 100 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 39 @,@ 000 sq mi ) with temperature less than or equal to − 32 ° C ( − 26 ° F ) ; and an area of cloud top of 50 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 19 @,@ 000 sq mi ) with temperature less than or equal to − 52 ° C ( − 62 ° F ) . Size definitions must be met for six hours or greater . Its maximum extent is defined as when the cloud shield , or the overall cloud formation , reaches its maximum area . Its eccentricity ( minor axis / major axis ) is greater than or equal to 0 @.@ 7 at maximum extent , so they are fairly round . They are long @-@ lived , nocturnal in formation as they tend to form overnight , and commonly contain heavy rainfall , wind , hail , lightning and possibly tornadoes . 
 = = = Squall line = = = 
 A squall line is an elongated line of severe thunderstorms that can form along and / or ahead of a cold front . In the early 20th century , the term was used as a synonym for cold front . The squall line contains heavy precipitation , hail , frequent lightning , strong straight line winds , and possibly tornadoes and waterspouts . Severe weather , in form of strong straight @-@ line winds can be expected in areas where the squall line itself is in the shape of a bow echo , within the portion of the line which bows out the most . Tornadoes can be found along waves within a line echo wave pattern , or LEWP , where mesoscale low pressure areas are present . Some bow echoes which develop within the summer season are known as derechos , and they move quite fast through large sections of territory . On the back edge of the rain shield associated with mature squall lines , a wake low can form , which is a mesoscale low pressure area that forms behind the mesoscale high pressure system normally present under the rain canopy , which are sometimes associated with a heat burst . 
 = = = Tropical cyclone = = = 
 A tropical cyclone is a fairly symmetric storm system characterized by a low pressure center and numerous thunderstorms that produce strong winds and flooding rain . A tropical cyclone feeds on the heat released when moist air rises , resulting in condensation of water vapour contained in the moist air . It is fueled by a different heat mechanism than other cyclonic windstorms such as nor 'easters , European windstorms , and polar lows , leading to their classification as " warm core " storm systems . 
 The term " tropical " refers to both the geographic origin of these systems , which form often in tropical regions of the globe , and their formation in Maritime Tropical air masses . The term " cyclone " refers to such storms ' cyclonic nature , with counterclockwise rotation in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise rotation in the Southern Hemisphere . Depending on their location and strength , tropical cyclones are referred to by other names , such as hurricane , typhoon , tropical storm , cyclonic storm , tropical depression , or simply as a cyclone . Generally speaking , a tropical cyclone is referred to as a hurricane ( from the name of the ancient Central American deity of wind , Huracan ) in the Atlantic and eastern Pacific oceans , a typhoon across the northwest Pacific ocean , and a cyclone across in the southern hemisphere and Indian ocean . 
 Tropical cyclones can produce extremely powerful winds and torrential rain , as well as high waves and damaging storm surge . They develop over large bodies of warm water , and lose their strength if they move over land . This is the reason coastal regions can receive significant damage from a tropical cyclone , while inland regions are relatively safe from the strong winds . Heavy rains , however , can produce significant flooding inland , and storm surges can produce extensive coastal flooding up to 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) from the coastline . Although their effects on human populations can be devastating , tropical cyclones can also relieve drought conditions . They also carry heat and energy away from the tropics and transport it toward temperate latitudes , which makes them an important part of the global atmospheric circulation mechanism . As a result , tropical cyclones help to maintain equilibrium in the Earth 's troposphere , and to maintain a relatively stable and warm . 
 Many tropical cyclones develop when the atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance in the atmosphere are favorable . Others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristics . Tropical systems are then moved by steering winds in the troposphere ; if the conditions remain favorable , the tropical disturbance intensifies , and can even develop an eye . On the other end of the spectrum , if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall , the system weakens and eventually dissipates . A tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses ; From an operational standpoint , a tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become a subtropical cyclone during its extratropical transition . 
 = = = Lake @-@ effect snow = = = 
 Lake @-@ effect snow is produced in the winter in the shape of one or more elongated bands when cold winds move across long expanses of warmer lake water , providing energy and picking up water vapor which freezes and is deposited on the lee shores . The same effect over bodies of salt water is called ocean effect snow , sea effect snow , or even bay effect snow . The effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the orographic effect of higher elevations on the downwind shores . This uplifting can produce narrow , but very intense bands of precipitation , which is deposited at a rate of many inches of snow per hour and often brings copious snowfall totals . The areas affected by lake @-@ effect snow are called <unk> . This effect occurs in many locations throughout the world , but is best known in the populated areas of the Great Lakes of North America . 
 If the air temperature is not low enough to keep the precipitation frozen , it falls as lake @-@ effect rain . In order for lake @-@ effect rain or snow to form , the air moving across the lake must be significantly cooler than the surface air ( which is likely to be near the temperature of the water surface ) . Specifically , the air temperature at the altitude where the air pressure is 850 millibars ( or 1 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) altitude ) should be 13 ° C ( 24 ° F ) lower than the temperature of the air at the surface . Lake @-@ effect occurring when the air at 850 millibars is 25 ° C ( 45 ° F ) colder than the water temperature can produce <unk> , snow showers accompanied by lightning and thunder ( due to the larger amount of energy available from the increased instability ) . 
 = = = Polar low = = = 
 A polar low is a small @-@ scale , symmetric , short @-@ lived atmospheric low pressure system ( depression ) that is found over the ocean areas poleward of the main polar front in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres . The systems usually have a horizontal length scale of less than 1 @,@ 000 kilometres ( 620 mi ) and exist for no more than a couple of days . They are part of the larger class of mesoscale weather systems . Polar lows can be difficult to detect using conventional weather reports and are a hazard to high @-@ latitude operations , such as shipping and gas and oil platforms . Polar lows have been referred to by many other terms , such as polar mesoscale vortex , Arctic hurricane , Arctic low , and cold air depression . Today the term is usually reserved for the more vigorous systems that have near @-@ surface winds of at least 17 metres per second ( 38 mph ) . 
 = = Where they form = = 
 = = = Great Plains of the United States = = = 
 The time period in the Plains where thunderstorm areas are most prevalent ranges between May and September . Mesoscale convective systems develop over the region during this time frame , with a bulk of the activity occurring between 6 and 9 p.m. local time . Mesoscale convective systems bring 30 to 70 percent of the annual warm season rainfall to the Plains . A subset of these systems known as mesoscale convective complexes lead to up to 10 % of the annual rainfall across the Plains and Midwest . Squall lines account for 30 % of the large thunderstorm complexes which move through the region . 
 = = = Europe = = = 
 While most form over the continent , some <unk> form during the second half of August and September over the western Mediterranean Sea . MCS triggering over Europe is strongly tied to mountain ranges . On average , a European MCS moves east @-@ northeast , forming near 3 p.m. local solar time , lasts 5 @.@ 5 hours , dissipating near 9 p.m. LST . Around 20 % of the <unk> over Europe do not form during maximum heating . Their average maximum extent is around 9 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 3 @,@ 500 sq mi ) .
