 Carbon dating on ash mounds associated with Neolithic cultures in South India date back to 8000 BCE . Artefacts such as ground stone axes , and minor copper objects have been found in the region . Towards the beginning of 1000 BCE , iron technology spread through the region ; however , there does not appear to be a fully developed Bronze Age preceding the Iron Age in South India . The region was in the middle of a trade route that extended from Muziris to Arikamedu linking the Mediterranean and East Asia . Trade with Phoenicians , Romans , Greeks , Arabs , Syrians , Jews and Chinese began from the Sangam period ( c . 3rd century BC to c . 4th century AD ) . The region was part of the ancient Silk Road connecting the Asian continent in the East and the West . 
 Several dynasties such as the Cheras of <unk> , the Pandyas of Madurai , the Cholas of Thanjavur , the Satavahanas of <unk> , the Pallavas of Kanchi , the Kadambas of Banavasi , the Western Gangas of Kolar , the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta , the Chalukyas of Badami , the Hoysalas of Belur and the Kakatiyas of <unk> ruled over the region from 6th century B.C. to 14th century A.D. The Vijayanagara Empire , founded in 14th century A.D. was the last Indian dynasty that ruled over the region . After repeated invasions from the Sultanate of Delhi and the fall of Vijayanagara empire in 1646 , the region was ruled by Deccan Sultanates , polygars and Nayak governors of Vijayanagara empire who declared independence . 
 = = = Colonial era = = = 
 The Europeans arrived in the 15th century and by the middle of the 18th century , the French and the British were involved in a protracted struggle for military control over South India . After the defeat of Tipu Sultan in the Fourth Anglo @-@ Mysore War in 1799 and the end of the Vellore Mutiny in 1806 , the British consolidated their power over much of present @-@ day South India with the exception of French <unk> . The British Empire took control of the region from the British East India Company in 1857 . During the British colonial rule , the region was divided into the Madras Presidency , Hyderabad state , Mysore , Travancore , Kochi , Vizianagaram and a number of other minor princely states . The region played a major role in the Indian independence movement ; of the 72 delegates who participated in the first session of the Indian National Congress at Bombay in December 1885 , 22 hailed from South India . 
 = = = Post Independence = = = 
 After the independence of India in 1947 , the region was organised into four states : Madras State , Mysore State , Hyderabad State and Travancore @-@ Cochin . The States Reorganisation Act of 1956 reorganised the states on linguistic lines resulting in the creation of the new states of Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka , Kerala and Tamil Nadu . As a result of this Act , Madras State retained its name and Kanyakumari district was added to it from the state of Travancore @-@ Cochin . The state was subsequently renamed Tamil Nadu in 1968 . Andhra Pradesh was created through the merger of Andhra State with the Telugu @-@ speaking districts of the Hyderabad State in 1956 . Kerala emerged from the merger of Malabar district and the Kasaragod taluk of South Canara districts of the Madras State with Travancore @-@ Cochin . Mysore State was re @-@ organised with the addition of districts of Bellary and South Canara ( excluding Kasaragod <unk> 1 ) and the Kollegal taluk of Coimbatore district from the Madras State , the districts of Belgaum , Bijapur , North Canara and Dharwad from the Bombay State , the Kannada @-@ majority districts of Bidar , Raichur and Gulbarga from the Hyderabad State and the province of Coorg . Mysore State was renamed as Karnataka in 1973 . The Union territory of Puducherry was created in 1954 comprising the previous French enclaves of <unk> , Karaikal , Yanam and Mahé . The Laccadive Islands , which were divided between South Canara and Malabar districts of Madras State , were united and organised into the union territory of Lakshadweep . Telangana was created on 2 June 2014 by bifurcating Andhra Pradesh and it comprises ten districts of the erstwhile state of Andhra Pradesh .

 = = Geography = = 
 South India is a peninsula in the shape of an inverted triangle bound by the Arabian Sea on the west , by the Bay of Bengal on the east and Vindhya and Satpura ranges on the north . The Narmada river flows westwards in the depression between the Vindhya and Satpura ranges which define the northern spur of the Deccan plateau . The Western Ghats run parallel along the western coast and the narrow strip of land between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea forms the Konkan region . The Western Ghats continue south until Kanyakumari . The Eastern Ghats run parallel along the eastern coast and the strip of land between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal forms the Coromandel region . Both the ranges meet at the Nilgiri mountains . The Nilgiris run in a crescent approximately along the borders of Tamil Nadu with northern Kerala and Karnataka , encompassing the Palakkad and Wayanad hills and the Sathyamangalam ranges , extending on to the relatively low @-@ lying hills of the Eastern Ghats on the western portion of the Tamil Nadu – Andhra Pradesh border forming the Tirupati and Annamalai hills . 
 The low lying coral islands of Lakshadweep are situated off the south @-@ western coast of India . The Andaman and Nicobar islands lie far off the eastern coast of India . The Palk Strait and the chain of low sandbars and islands known as Rama 's Bridge separate the region from Sri Lanka , which lies off the south @-@ eastern coast . The southernmost tip of mainland India is at Kanyakumari where the Indian Ocean meets the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea . 
 The Deccan plateau is the elevated region bound by the mountain ranges . The plateau rises to 100 metres ( 330 ft ) in the north and to more than 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) in the south , forming a raised triangle within the downward @-@ pointing triangle of the Indian subcontinent 's coastline . It also slopes gently from West to East resulting in major rivers arising in the Western Ghats and flowing east into the Bay of Bengal . The volcanic basalt beds of the Deccan were laid down in the massive Deccan Traps eruption , which occurred towards the end of the Cretaceous period between 67 and 66 million years ago . Layer after layer was formed by the volcanic activity that lasted 30 @,@ 000 years and when the volcanoes became extinct , they left a region of highlands with typically vast stretches of flat areas on top like a table . The plateau is watered by east flowing rivers Godavari , Krishna , Kaveri and Vaigai . The major tributaries include Pennar , Tungabhadra , Bhavani and <unk> . 
 = = Climate = = 
 The region has a tropical climate and depends on monsoons for rainfall . According to the Köppen climate classification , it has a non @-@ arid climate with minimum mean temperatures of 18 ° C ( 64 ° F ) . The most humid is the tropical monsoon climate characterised by moderate to high year @-@ round temperatures and seasonal heavy rainfall above 2 @,@ 000 mm ( 79 in ) per year . The tropical climate is experienced in a strip of south @-@ western lowlands abutting the Malabar Coast , the Western Ghats and the islands of Lakshadweep and Andaman and Nicobar are also subject to this climate . 
 The tropical wet and dry climate , drier than areas with a tropical monsoon climate prevails over most of inland peninsular region except for a semi arid rain shadow east of the Western Ghats . Winter and early summer are long and dry periods with temperatures averaging above 18 ° C ( 64 ° F ) , summer is exceedingly hot with temperatures in low @-@ lying areas exceeding 50 ° C ( 122 ° F ) and the rainy season lasts from June to September with annual rainfall averaging between 750 and 1 @,@ 500 mm ( 30 and 59 in ) across the region . Once the dry northeast monsoon begins in September , most precipitation in India falls in Tamil Nadu , leaving other states comparatively dry . The hot semi @-@ arid climate predominates the land east of the Western Ghats and the Cardamom Hills . The region , which includes Karnataka , inland Tamil Nadu and western Andhra Pradesh , gets between 400 and 750 millimetres ( 15 @.@ 7 and 29 @.@ 5 in ) of rainfall annually with hot summers and dry winters with temperatures around 20 – 24 ° C ( 68 – 75 ° F ) . The months between March and May are hot and dry with mean monthly temperatures hover around 32 ° C ( 90 ° F ) , with 320 millimetres ( 13 in ) precipitation and without artificial irrigation , this region is not suitable for agriculture . 
 The south – west Monsoon from June to September accounts for most of the rainfall in the region . The Arabian Sea branch of the south @-@ west monsoon hits the Western Ghats along the coastal state of Kerala and moves northwards along the Konkan coast with precipitation on coastal areas , west of the Western Ghats . The lofty Western Ghats prevent the winds from reaching the Deccan Plateau - hence the leeward region ( the region that deprived of winds ) receives very little rainfall . The Bay of Bengal branch of south @-@ west monsoon heads toward north east India , picking up moisture from the Bay of Bengal . The Coramandel coast does not receive much rainfall from the south @-@ west monsoon due to the shape of the land . Tamil Nadu and southeast Andhra Pradesh receive rains from the north – east Monsoon . The north @-@ east monsoon take place from November to early March when the surface high @-@ pressure system is strongest . The North Indian Ocean tropical cyclones occur throughout the year in Bay of Bengal and Arabian sea bringing devastating winds and heavy rainfall .

 There is a wide diversity of plants and animals in South India , resulting from its varied climates and geography . Deciduous forests are found along the Western Ghats while tropical dry forests and scrub lands are common in the interior Deccan plateau . The southern Western Ghats have rainforests located at high altitudes called the South Western Ghats montane rain forests and the Malabar Coast moist forests are found on the coastal plains . The Western Ghats is one of the eight hottest biodiversity hotspots in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site . 
 Important ecological regions of South India are the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve , located at the conjunction of the borders of Karnataka , Kerala and Tamil Nadu in the Nilgiri Hills and the Anamalai Hills in the Western Ghats . Bird sanctuaries including <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and Pulicat are home to numerous migratory and local birds . Lakshadweep has been declared a bird sanctuary by the Wildlife Institute of India . Other protected ecological sites include the mangrove forests of <unk> in Tamil Nadu , the backwaters of Pulicat lake in Tamil Nadu and Vembanad , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> lakes in Kerala . The Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve covers an area of 10 @,@ 500 km ² of ocean , islands and the adjoining coastline including coral reefs , salt marshes and mangroves . It is home to Endangered aquatic species including dolphins , dugongs , whales and sea cucumbers . 
 The region is home to one of the largest populations of endangered Indian elephant and Bengal Tiger in India . Elephant populations are found in eight fragmented sites in South India ; in northern Karnataka , along the Western Ghats , in Bhadra – Malnad , in Brahmagiri – Nilgiris – Eastern Ghats , in Nilambur – Silent Valley – Coimbatore , in Anamalai – <unk> , in Periyar – Srivilliputhur and <unk> The region is home to one @-@ third of the tiger population and more than half of the elephant population of India .

 As per the 2011 census of India , the estimated population of South India is 252 million , around one fifth of the total population of India . The region 's total fertility rate ( TFR ) was less than the population replacement level of 2 @.@ 1 for all states with Kerala and Tamil Nadu having the lowest <unk> in India at 1 @.@ 7 . As a result , the proportion of the population of South India to India 's total population has declined from 1981 to 2011 . The population density of the region is approximately 463 . Scheduled Castes and Tribes form 18 % of the population of the region . Agriculture is the major employer in the region with 47 @.@ 5 % of the population is involved in agrarian activities . About 60 % of the population lives in permanent housing structures . 67 @.@ 8 % of South India has access to tap water with wells and springs forming other major sources of water supply . 
 After experiencing fluctuations in the decades immediately after the independence of India , the economies of South Indian states have registered growth higher than the national average over the past three decades . While South Indian states have improved in some of the socio @-@ economic metrics , poverty continues to affect the region as it does the rest of the country , although it has considerably decreased over the years . Basis the 2011 census , HDI in the southern states is high and the economy has grown at a faster rate than most northern states .

 Hinduism is the major religion with about 80 % of the population adhering to it . About 11 % of the population follow Islam and 8 % follow Christianity . Evidence of prehistoric religion in South India comes from scattered Mesolithic rock paintings depicting dances and rituals in Stone Age sites such as the <unk> petroglyphs of eastern Karnataka . Hinduism , often regarded as the oldest religion in the world , traces its roots to prehistoric times in India . The main spiritual traditions of South India include both Shaivite and Vaishnavite branches of Hinduism , although Buddhist and Jain philosophies had been influential several centuries earlier . <unk> is spread significantly across the southern parts of South India . Islam was introduced to South India in the early 7th century by Arab traders in Malabar Coast of Kerala and spread during the rule of Deccan Sultanates from 17th to 18th century and the Muslims in Kerala of Arab descent are called <unk> Mappila . Christianity was introduced to South India by Thomas the Apostle , who visited Muziris in Kerala in 52 CE and baptised Kerala 's Jewish settlements . Kerala is also home to one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world who are supposed to have arrived in the Malabar coast during the reign of King Solomon . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The economy of South India after the independence of the nation conformed to a socialist framework , with strict governmental control over private sector participation , foreign trade and foreign direct investment . Through 1960 to 1990 , the South Indian economies experienced mixed economic growth . In the 1960s , Kerala achieved above average economic growth while Andhra Pradesh 's economy declined during this period . Kerala experienced an economic decline in the 1970s while the economies of Tamil Nadu , Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka consistently exceeded national average growth rates after 1970 due to reform @-@ oriented economic policies compared to other Indian states . As of 2013 – 14 , the total Gross domestic product of the region is ₹ 27 @.@ 1 trillion ( US $ 400 billion ) . Tamil Nadu has the second highest GDP and is the second most industrialised state in the country after Maharashtra . As of March 2015 , there are 109 operational Special Economic Zones in South India , which is about 60 % of the country 's total . 
 Over 48 % of South India 's population is engaged in agriculture , which is largely dependent on seasonal monsoons . Some of the main crops cultivated in South India include paddy , sorghum , pearl millet , pulses , sugarcane , cotton , chilli and ragi . <unk> , coffee , tea , rubber and spices are cultivated on the hilly regions . The staple food is rice ; the delta regions of Godavari , Krishna and Kaveri are amongst the top rice producing areas in the country . Frequent droughts have left farmers debt @-@ ridden , forcing them to sell their livestock and sometimes to commit suicide . The region accounts for 92 % of the total Coffee production in India . South India is also a major producer of cotton , tea , rubber , turmeric , mangoes and spices . Other major agriculture related produce include silk and poultry . 
 The other major industry is textiles with the region being home to nearly 60 % of the fibre textile mills in India . Bangalore , Chennai , Hyderabad , Coimbatore and Thiruvananthapuram are amongst the major IT hubs of India and Bangalore is also known as the Silicon Valley of India . The growth of information technology ( IT ) hubs in the region have spurred economic growth and attracted foreign investments and job seekers from other parts of the country . Software exports from South India grossed over ₹ 640 billion ( US $ 9 @.@ 5 billion ) in fiscal 2005 – 06 . Chennai , known as the " Detroit of Asia " , accounts for about 35 % of India 's overall automotive components and automobile output .

 Politics in South India is characterised by a mix of regional and national political parties . Justice Party and Swaraj Party were the two major parties in the erstwhile Madras Presidency . The Justice Party eventually lost the 1937 elections to the Indian National Congress and Chakravarti Rajagopalachari became the Chief Minister of the Madras Presidency . During the 1920s and 1930s , the Self @-@ Respect Movement movement emerged in the Madras Presidency spearheaded by Theagaroya Chetty and E. V. Ramaswamy Naicker ( commonly known as Periyar ) . In 1944 Periyar , who had started the Self @-@ Respect Movement transformed the party into a social organisation , renaming the party Dravidar Kazhagam , and withdrew from electoral politics . The initial aim was the secession of Dravida Nadu from the rest of India on independence . After Independence , C. N. Annadurai , a follower of Periyar formed the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in 1948 . The Anti @-@ Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu led to the rise of Dravidian parties which formed its first government in 1967 in Tamil Nadu . In 1972 , a split in the DMK resulted in the formation of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam led by M. G. Ramachandran . Dravidian parties continue to dominate Tamil Nadu electoral politics ; the national parties usually aligned as junior partners to the major Dravidian parties , AIADMK and DMK . 
 Indian National Congress dominated the political scene in Tamil Nadu in 1950s and 1960s under the leadership of K. Kamaraj , who led the party after the death of Jawaharlal Nehru and ensured the selection of Prime Ministers Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi . Congress continues to be a major party in Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka and Kerala . The party ruled with minimal opposition for 30 years in Andhra Pradesh before the formation of Telugu Desam Party by Nandamuri <unk> Rama Rao in 1982 . Two prominent party systems in Kerala are the United Democratic Front , led by the Indian National Congress and the Left Democratic Front , led by the Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) . For the past fifty years , these two coalitions have been alternately in power and E. M. S. Namboodiripad , the first elected chief minister of Kerala in 1957 is credited as the leader of the first democratically elected communist government in the world . Bharatiya Janata Party and Janata Dal are significant parties in Karnataka . 
 C. Rajagopalachari , the first Indian Governor General of India post independence , was from South India . The region has produced six Indian Presidents namely Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan , V. V.

Besides these , a South Indian temple typically has a tank called the Kalyani or Pushkarni . The gopuram is a monumental tower , usually ornate at the entrance of any temple in Southern India . This forms a prominent feature of <unk> , Hindu temples of the Dravidian style . They are topped by the <unk> , a spherical stone finial , and function as gateways through the walls that surround the temple complex . The origins of the gopuram can be traced back to early structures of the Pallavas and by the twelfth century , under the Pandya rulers , these gateways became a dominant feature of a temple 's outer appearance , eventually overshadowing the inner sanctuary which became obscured from view by the colossal size of the gopuram .

 = English language = 
 English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and is now a global lingua franca . English is either the official language or an official language in almost 60 sovereign states . It is the most commonly spoken language in the United Kingdom , the United States , Canada , Australia , Ireland , and New Zealand , and is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean , Africa , and South Asia . It is the third most common native language in the world , after Mandarin and Spanish . It is the most widely learned second language and an official language of the United Nations , of the European Union , and of many other world and regional international organisations . 
 English has developed over the course of more than 1 @,@ 400 years . The earliest forms of English , a set of Anglo @-@ Frisian dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo @-@ Saxon settlers in the fifth century , are called Old English . Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England . Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London and the King James Bible , and the start of the Great Vowel Shift . Through the worldwide influence of the British Empire , modern English spread around the world from the 17th to mid @-@ 20th centuries . Through all types of printed and electronic media , as well as the emergence of the United States as a global superpower , English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and in professional contexts such as science , navigation , and law . 
 Modern English has little inflection compared with many other languages , and relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses , aspect and mood , as well as passive constructions , interrogatives and some negation . Despite noticeable variation among the accents and dialects of English used in different countries and regions – in terms of phonetics and phonology , and sometimes also vocabulary , grammar and spelling – English @-@ speakers from around the world are able to communicate with one another with surprising ease . 
 = = Classification = = 
 English is an Indo @-@ European language , and belongs to the West Germanic group of the Germanic languages . Most closely related to English are the Frisian languages , and English and Frisian form the Anglo @-@ Frisian subgroup within West Germanic . Old Saxon and its descendent Low German languages are also closely related , and sometimes Low German , English , and Frisian are grouped together as the <unk> or North Sea Germanic languages . Modern English descends from Middle English , which in turn descends from Old English . Particular dialects of Old and Middle English also developed into a number of other English ( <unk> ) languages , including Scots and the extinct <unk> and Forth and <unk> ( Yola ) dialects of Ireland . 
 English is classified as a Germanic language because it shares new language features ( different from other Indo @-@ European languages ) with other Germanic languages such as Dutch , German , and Swedish . These shared innovations show that the languages have descended from a single common ancestor , which linguists call Proto @-@ Germanic . Some shared features of Germanic languages are the use of modal verbs , the division of verbs into strong and weak classes , and the sound changes affecting Proto @-@ Indo @-@ European consonants , known as Grimm 's and Verner 's laws . Through Grimm 's law , the word for foot begins with / f / in Germanic languages , but its cognates in other Indo @-@ European languages begin with / p / . English is classified as an Anglo @-@ Frisian language because Frisian and English share other features , such as the palatalisation of consonants that were velar consonants in Proto @-@ Germanic ( see Phonological history of Old English § <unk> ) . 
 English sing , sang , sung ; Dutch <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ; German <unk> , sang , <unk> ( strong verb ) 
 English laugh , laughed ; Dutch and German <unk> , <unk> ( weak verb ) 
 English foot , Dutch <unk> , German Fuß , Norwegian and Swedish fot ( initial / f / derived from Proto @-@ Indo @-@ European * p through Grimm 's law ) 
 Latin pes , stem ped- ; Modern Greek <unk> <unk> ; Russian под pod ; Sanskrit <unk> ् <unk> ( original Proto @-@ Indo @-@ European * p ) 
 English cheese , Frisian <unk> ( ch and ts from palatalisation ) 
 German <unk> and Dutch <unk> ( k without palatalisation ) 
 English , like the other insular Germanic languages , Icelandic and Faroese , developed independently of the continental Germanic languages and their influences . English is thus not mutually intelligible with any continental Germanic language , differing in vocabulary , syntax , and phonology , although some , such as Dutch , do show strong affinities with English , especially with its earlier stages . 
 Because English through its history has changed considerably in response to contact with other languages , particularly Old Norse and Norman French , some scholars have argued that English can be considered a mixed language or a creole – a theory called the Middle English creole hypothesis . Although the high degree of influence from these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of Modern English is widely acknowledged , most specialists in language contact do not consider English to be a true mixed language . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Proto @-@ Germanic to Old English = = = 
 The earliest form of English is called Old English or Anglo @-@ Saxon ( c . 550 – 1066 CE ) . Old English developed from a set of North Sea Germanic dialects originally spoken along the coasts of Frisia , Lower Saxony , Jutland , and Southern Sweden by Germanic tribes known as the Angles , Saxons , and Jutes . In the fifth century , the Anglo @-@ Saxons settled Britain and the Romans withdrew from Britain . By the seventh century , the Germanic language of the Anglo @-@ Saxons became dominant in Britain , replacing the languages of Roman Britain ( 43 – 409 CE ) : Common Brittonic , a Celtic language , and Latin , brought to Britain by the Roman occupation . England and English ( originally Englaland and <unk> ) are named after the Angles . 
 Old English was divided into four dialects : the Anglian dialects , Mercian and Northumbrian , and the Saxon dialects , Kentish and West Saxon . Through the educational reforms of King Alfred in the ninth century and the influence of the kingdom of Wessex , the West Saxon dialect became the standard written variety . The epic poem Beowulf is written in West Saxon , and the earliest English poem , Cædmon 's Hymn , is written in Northumbrian . Modern English developed mainly from Mercian , but the Scots language developed from Northumbrian . A few short inscriptions from the early period of Old English were written using a runic script . By the sixth century , a Latin alphabet was adopted , written with half @-@ uncial letterforms . It included the runic letters <unk> < <unk> > and thorn < þ > , and the modified Latin letters eth < ð > , and ash < æ > . 
 Old English is very different from Modern English and difficult for 21st @-@ century English speakers to understand . Its grammar was similar to that of modern German , and its closest relative is Old Frisian . Nouns , adjectives , pronouns , and verbs had many more inflectional endings and forms , and word order was much freer than in Modern English . Modern English has case forms in pronouns ( he , him , his ) and a few verb endings ( I have , he has ) , but Old English had case endings in nouns as well , and verbs had more person and number endings . 
 The translation of Matthew 8 : 20 from 1000 CE shows examples of case endings ( nominative plural , accusative plural , genitive singular ) and a verb ending ( present plural ) : 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> nest 
 Fox @-@ as <unk> @-@ <unk> hol @-@ u and <unk> @-@ an <unk> @-@ as <unk> <unk> 
 fox @-@ <unk> have @-@ <unk> hole @-@ <unk> and heaven @-@ <unk> bird @-@ <unk> nest @-@ <unk> 
 " Foxes have holes and the birds of heaven nests " 
 = = = Middle English = = = 
 In the period from the 8th to the 12th century , Old English gradually transformed through language contact into Middle English . Middle English is often arbitrarily defined as beginning with the conquest of England by William the Conqueror in 1066 , but it developed further in the period from 1200 – 1450 . 
 First , the waves of Norse colonisation of northern parts of the British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put Old English into intense contact with Old Norse , a North Germanic language . Norse influence was strongest in the Northeastern varieties of Old English spoken in the Danelaw area around York , which was the centre of Norse colonisation ; today these features are still particularly present in Scots and Northern English . However the centre of <unk> English seems to have been in the Midlands around Lindsey , and after 920 CE when Lindsey was reincorporated into the Anglo @-@ Saxon polity , Norse features spread from there into English varieties that had not been in intense contact with Norse speakers . Some elements of Norse influence that persist in all English varieties today are the pronouns beginning with <unk> ( they , them , their ) which replaced the Anglo @-@ Saxon pronouns with <unk> ( hie , him , <unk> ) . 
 With the Norman conquest of England in 1066 , the now <unk> Old English language was subject to contact with the Old Norman language , a Romance language closely related to Modern French . The Norman language in England eventually developed into Anglo @-@ Norman . Because Norman was spoken primarily by the elites and nobles , while the lower classes continued speaking Anglo @-@ Saxon , the influence of Norman consisted of introducing a wide range of loanwords related to politics , legislation and prestigious social domains . Middle English also greatly simplified the inflectional system , probably in order to reconcile Old Norse and Old English , which were <unk> different but morphologically similar . The distinction between nominative and accusative case was lost except in personal pronouns , the instrumental case was dropped , and the use of the genitive case was limited to describing possession . The inflectional system regularised many irregular inflectional forms , and gradually simplified the system of agreement , making word order less flexible . By the Wycliffe Bible of the 1380s , the passage Matthew 8 : 20 was written 
 <unk> han <unk> , and <unk> of <unk> han <unk> 
 Here the plural suffix -n on the verb have is still retained , but none of the case endings on the nouns are present . 
 By the 12th century Middle English was fully developed , integrating both Norse and Norman features ; it continued to be spoken until the transition to early Modern English around 1500 . Middle English literature includes Geoffrey Chaucer 's The Canterbury Tales , and Malory 's Le Morte d 'Arthur . In the Middle English period the use of regional dialects in writing proliferated , and dialect traits were even used for effect by authors such as Chaucer . 
 = = = Early Modern English = = = 
 The next period in the history of English was Early Modern English ( 1500 – 1700 ) . Early Modern English was characterised by the Great Vowel Shift ( 1350 – 1700 ) , inflectional simplification , and linguistic standardisation . 
 The Great Vowel Shift affected the stressed long vowels of Middle English . It was a chain shift , meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent shift in the vowel system . Mid and open vowels were raised , and close vowels were broken into diphthongs . For example , the word bite was originally pronounced as the word beet is today , and the second vowel in the word about was pronounced as the word boot is today . The Great Vowel Shift explains many irregularities in spelling , since English retains many spellings from Middle English , and it also explains why English vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages . 
 English began to rise in prestige during the reign of Henry V. Around 1430 , the Court of Chancery in Westminster began using English in its official documents , and a new standard form of Middle English , known as Chancery Standard , developed from the dialects of London and the East Midlands . In 1476 , William Caxton introduced the printing press to England and began publishing the first printed books in London , expanding the influence of this form of English . Literature from the Early Modern period includes the works of William Shakespeare and the translation of the Bible commissioned by King James I. Even after the vowel shift the language still sounded different from Modern English : for example , the consonant clusters / kn <unk> <unk> / in knight , gnat , and sword were still pronounced . Many of the grammatical features that a modern reader of Shakespeare might find quaint or archaic represent the distinct characteristics of Early Modern English . 
 In the 1611 King James Version of the Bible , written in Early Modern English , Matthew 8 : 20 says : 
 The Foxes haue holes and the birds of the ayre haue nests 
 This exemplifies the loss of case and its effects on sentence structure ( replacement with Subject @-@ Verb @-@ Object word order , and the use of of instead of the non @-@ possessive genitive ) , and the introduction of loanwords from French ( ayre ) and word replacements ( bird originally meaning " nestling " had replaced OE <unk> ) . 
 = = = Spread of Modern English = = = 
 By the late 18th century , the British Empire had facilitated the spread of English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance . Commerce , science and technology , diplomacy , art , and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly global language . English also facilitated worldwide international communication . As England continued to form new colonies , these in turn became independent and developed their own norms for how to speak and write the language . English was adopted in North America , India , parts of Africa , Australasia , and many other regions . In the post @-@ colonial period , some of the newly created nations that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others . In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States and its status as a superpower following the Second World War has , along with worldwide broadcasting in English by the BBC and other broadcasters , significantly accelerated the spread of the language across the planet . By the 21st century , English was more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been . 
 A major feature in the early development of Modern English was the codification of explicit norms for standard usage , and their dissemination through official media such as public education and state sponsored publications . In 1755 Samuel Johnson published his A Dictionary of the English Language which introduced a standard set of spelling conventions and usage norms . In 1828 , Noah Webster published the American Dictionary of the English language in an effort to establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent from the British standard . Within Britain , non @-@ standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised , leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes . 
 In terms of grammatical evolution , Modern English has now reached a stage where the loss of case is almost complete ( case is now only found in pronouns , such as he and him , she and her , who and whom ) , and where SVO word @-@ order is mostly fixed . Some changes , such as the use of do @-@ support have become universalised . ( Earlier English did not use the word " do " as a general auxiliary as Modern English does ; at first it was only used in question constructions where it was not obligatory . Now , do @-@ support with the verb have is becoming increasingly standardised . ) The use of progressive forms in -ing , appears to be spreading to new constructions , and forms such as had been being built are becoming more common . <unk> of irregular forms also slowly continues ( e.g. dreamed instead of dreamt ) , and analytical alternatives to inflectional forms are becoming more common ( e.g. more polite instead of <unk> ) . British English is also undergoing change under the influence of American English , fuelled by the strong presence of American English in the media and the prestige associated with the US as a world power . 
 = = Geographical distribution = = 
 As of 2010 , 359 million people spoke English as their first language . English is probably the third largest language by number of native speakers , after Mandarin and Spanish . However , when combining native and non @-@ native speakers it is probably the most commonly spoken language in the world . English is spoken by communities on every continent and on oceanic islands in all the major oceans . The countries in which English is spoken can be grouped into different categories by how English is used in each country . The " inner circle " countries with many native speakers of English share an international standard of written English and jointly influence speech norms of English around the world . English does not belong to just one country , and it does not belong solely to descendants of English settlers . English is an official language of countries populated by few descendants of native speakers of English . It has also become by far the most important language of international communication when people who share no native language meet anywhere in the world . 
 = = = Three circles of English @-@ speaking countries = = = 
 Braj Kachru distinguishes countries where English is spoken with a three circles model . In his model , the " inner circle " countries are countries with large communities of native speakers of English , " outer circle " countries have small communities of native speakers of English but widespread use of English as a second language in education or broadcasting or for local official purposes , and " expanding circle " countries are countries where many learners learn English as a foreign language . Kachru bases his model on the history of how English spread in different countries , how users acquire English , and the range of uses English has in each country . The three circles change membership over time . 
 Countries with large communities of native speakers of English ( the inner circle ) include Britain , the United States , Australia , Canada , Ireland , and New Zealand , where the majority speaks English , and South Africa , where a significant minority speaks English . The countries with the most native English speakers are , in descending order , the United States ( at least 231 million ) , the United Kingdom ( 60 million ) , Canada ( 19 million ) , Australia ( at least 17 million ) , South Africa ( 4 @.@ 8 million ) , Ireland ( 4 @.@ 2 million ) , and New Zealand ( 3 @.@ 7 million ) . In these countries , children of native speakers learn English from their parents , and local people who speak other languages or new immigrants learn English to communicate in their neighbourhoods and workplaces . The inner @-@ circle countries provide the base from which English spreads to other countries in the world . 
 Estimates of the number of English speakers who are second language and foreign @-@ language speakers vary greatly from 470 million to more than 1 @,@ 000 million depending on how proficiency is defined . Linguist David Crystal estimates that non @-@ native speakers now outnumber native speakers by a ratio of 3 to 1 . In Kachru 's three @-@ circles model , the " outer circle " countries are countries such as the Philippines , Jamaica , India , Pakistan , Singapore , and Nigeria with a much smaller proportion of native speakers of English but much use of English as a second language for education , government , or domestic business , and where English is routinely used for school instruction and official interactions with the government . Those countries have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from an English @-@ based creole to a more standard version of English . They have many more speakers of English who acquire English in the process of growing up through day by day use and listening to broadcasting , especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction . Varieties of English learned by speakers who are not native speakers born to English @-@ speaking parents may be influenced , especially in their grammar , by the other languages spoken by those learners . Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of English in the inner @-@ circle countries , and they may have grammatical and phonological differences from inner @-@ circle varieties as well . The standard English of the inner @-@ circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in the outer @-@ circle countries . 
 In the three @-@ circles model , countries such as Poland , China , Brazil , Germany , Japan , Indonesia , Egypt , and other countries where English is taught as a foreign language make up the " expanding circle " . The distinctions between English as a first language , as a second language , and as a foreign language are often debatable and may change in particular countries over time . For example , in the Netherlands and some other countries of Europe , knowledge of English as a second language is nearly universal , with over 80 percent of the population able to use it , and thus English is routinely used to communicate with foreigners and often in higher education . In these countries , although English is not used for government business , the widespread use of English in these countries puts them at the boundary between the " outer circle " and " expanding circle " . English is unusual among world languages in how many of its users are not native speakers but speakers of English as a second or foreign language . Many users of English in the expanding circle use it to communicate with other people from the expanding circle , so that interaction with native speakers of English plays no part in their decision to use English . Non @-@ native varieties of English are widely used for international communication , and speakers of one such variety often encounter features of other varieties . Very often today a conversation in English anywhere in the world may include no native speakers of English at all , even while including speakers from several different countries . 
 = = = <unk> English = = = 
 English is a <unk> language , which means that no one national authority sets the standard for use of the language . But English is not a divided language , despite a long @-@ standing joke originally attributed to George Bernard Shaw that the United Kingdom and the United States are " two countries separated by a common language " . Spoken English , for example English used in broadcasting , generally follows national pronunciation standards that are also established by custom rather than by regulation . International broadcasters are usually identifiable as coming from one country rather than another through their accents , but newsreader scripts are also composed largely in international standard written English . The norms of standard written English are maintained purely by the consensus of educated English @-@ speakers around the world , without any oversight by any government or international organisation . American listeners generally readily understand most British broadcasting , and British listeners readily understand most American broadcasting . Most English speakers around the world can understand radio programmes , television programmes , and films from many parts of the English @-@ speaking world . Both standard and nonstandard varieties of English can include both formal or informal styles , distinguished by word choice and syntax and use both technical and non @-@ technical registers . 
 The settlement history of the English @-@ speaking inner circle countries outside Britain helped level dialect distinctions and produce a <unk> form of English in South Africa , Australia , and New Zealand . The majority of immigrants to the United States without British ancestry rapidly adopted English after arrival . Now the majority of the United States population are monolingual English speakers , although English has been given official status by only 30 of the 50 state governments of the US . 
 = = = English as a global language = = = 
 English has ceased to be an " English language " in the sense of belonging only to people who are ethnically English . Use of English is growing country @-@ by @-@ country internally and for international communication . Most people learn English for practical rather than ideological reasons . Many speakers of English in Africa have become part of an " Afro @-@ Saxon " language community that unites Africans from different countries . 
 As decolonisation proceeded throughout the British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s , former colonies often did not reject English but rather continued to use it as independent countries setting their own language policies . For example , the view of the English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress , and English continues to be an official language of India . English is also widely used in media and literature , and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK . However English is rarely spoken as a first language , numbering only around a couple hundred @-@ thousand people , and less than 5 % of the population speak fluent English in India . David Crystal claimed in 2004 that , combining native and non @-@ native speakers , India now has more people who speak or understand English than any other country in the world , but the number of English speakers in India is very uncertain , with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India . 
 Modern English , sometimes described as the first global lingua franca , is also regarded as the first world language . English is the world 's most widely used language in newspaper publishing , book publishing , international telecommunications , scientific publishing , international trade , mass entertainment , and diplomacy . English is , by international treaty , the basis for the required controlled natural languages <unk> and <unk> are used as international languages of seafaring and aviation . English has replaced German as the dominant language of scientific research . It achieved parity with French as a language of diplomacy at the Treaty of Versailles negotiations in 1919 . By the time of the foundation of the United Nations at the end of World War II , English had become pre @-@ eminent and is now the main worldwide language of diplomacy and international relations . It is one of six official languages of the United Nations . Many other worldwide international organisations , including the International Olympic Committee , specify English as a working language or official language of the organisation . 
 Many regional international organisations such as the European Free Trade Association , Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) , and Asia @-@ Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) set English as their organisation 's sole working language even though most members are not countries with a majority of native English speakers . While the European Union ( EU ) allows member states to designate any of the national languages as an official language of the Union , in practice English is the main working language of EU organisations . 
 Although in most countries English is not an official language , it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language . In the countries of the EU , English is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty @-@ five member states where it is not an official language ( that is , the countries other than the UK , Ireland and Malta ) . In a 2012 official Eurobarometer poll , 38 percent of the EU respondents outside the countries where English is an official language said they could speak English well enough to have a conversation in that language . The next most commonly mentioned foreign language , French ( which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland ) , could be used in conversation by 12 percent of respondents . 
 A working knowledge of English has become a requirement in a number of occupations and professions such as medicine and computing . English has become so important in scientific publishing that more than 80 percent of all scientific journal articles indexed by Chemical Abstracts in 1998 were written in English , as were 90 percent of all articles in natural science publications by 1996 and 82 percent of articles in humanities publications by 1995 . 
 The increased use of the English language globally has had an effect on other languages , leading to some English words being assimilated into the vocabularies of other languages . This influence of English has led to concerns about language death , and to claims of linguistic imperialism , and has provoked resistance to the spread of English ; however the number of speakers continues to increase because many people around the world think that English provides them with opportunities for better employment and improved lives . 
 Although some scholars mention a possibility of future divergence of English dialects into mutually unintelligible languages , most think a more likely outcome is that English will continue to function as a <unk> language in which the standard form unifies speakers from around the world . English is used as the language for wider communication in countries around the world . Thus English has grown in worldwide use much more than any constructed language proposed as an international auxiliary language , including Esperanto . 
 = = Phonology = = 
 The phonetics and phonology of English differ between dialects , usually without interfering with mutual communication . Phonological variation affects the inventory of phonemes ( speech sounds that distinguish meaning ) , and phonetic variation is differences in pronunciation of the phonemes . This overview mainly describes the standard pronunciations of the United Kingdom and the United States : Received Pronunciation ( RP ) and General American ( GA ) ( See Section below on " Dialects , accents and varieties " ) . The phonetic symbols used below are from the International Phonetic Alphabet ( IPA ) . 
 = = = Consonants = = = 
 Most English dialects share the same 24 consonant phonemes . The consonant inventory shown below is valid for Californian American English , and for RP . 
 * Conventionally transcribed / r / . 
 In the table , when obstruents ( stops , affricates , and fricatives ) appear in pairs , such as / p b / , / tʃ dʒ / , and / s z / , the first is fortis ( strong ) and the second is lenis ( weak ) . Fortis obstruents , such as / p tʃ s / are pronounced with more muscular tension and breath force than lenis consonants , such as / b dʒ z / , and are always voiceless . <unk> consonants are partly voiced at the beginning and end of utterances , and fully voiced between vowels . Fortis stops such as / p / have additional articulatory or acoustic features in most dialects : they are aspirated [ pʰ ] when they occur alone at the beginning of a stressed syllable , often unaspirated in other cases , and often unreleased [ p ̚ ] or pre @-@ glottalised [ <unk> ] at the end of a syllable . In a single @-@ syllable word , a vowel before a fortis stop is shortened : thus nip has a noticeably shorter vowel ( phonetically , but not phonemically ) than nib [ <unk> <unk> ] ( see below ) . 
 lenis stops : bin [ b ̥ <unk> ] , about [ <unk> ] , nib [ <unk> ̥ ] 
 fortis stops : pin [ <unk> ] , spin [ spɪn ] , happy [ <unk> ] , nip [ <unk> ̚ ] or [ <unk> ] 
 In RP , the lateral approximant / l / , has two main allophones ( pronunciation variants ) : the clear or plain [ l ] , as in light , and the dark or <unk> [ <unk> ] , as in full . GA has dark l in most cases . 
 clear l : RP light [ <unk> ] 
 dark l : RP and GA full [ <unk> ] , GA light [ <unk> ] 
 All sonorants ( liquids / l , r / and nasals / m , n , ŋ / ) <unk> when following a voiceless obstruent , and they are syllabic when following a consonant at the end of a word . 
 voiceless sonorants : clay [ <unk> ̯ ] and snow [ <unk> ̥ <unk> ] 
 syllabic sonorants : paddle [ <unk> ̩ ] , and button [ <unk> ̩ ] 
 = = = Vowels = = = 
 The pronunciation of vowels varies a great deal between dialects and is one of the most detectable aspects of a speaker 's accent . The table below lists the vowel phonemes in Received Pronunciation ( RP ) and General American ( GA ) , with examples of words in which they occur from lexical sets compiled by linguists . The vowels are represented with symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet ; those given for RP are standard in British dictionaries and other publications . 
 In RP , vowel length is phonemic ; long vowels are marked with a triangular colon 〈 ː 〉 in the table above , such as the vowel of need [ <unk> ] as opposed to bid [ <unk> ] . GA does not have long vowels . 
 In both RP and GA , vowels are phonetically shortened before fortis consonants in the same syllable , like / t tʃ f / , but not before lenis consonants like / d dʒ v / or in open syllables : thus , the vowels of rich [ <unk> ̆ tʃ ] , neat [ <unk> ] , and safe [ <unk> ̆ f ] are noticeably shorter than the vowels of ridge [ <unk> ] , need [ <unk> ] , and save [ <unk> ] , and the vowel of light [ <unk> ̆ t ] is shorter than that of lie [ <unk> ] . Because lenis consonants are frequently voiceless at the end of a syllable , vowel length is an important cue as to whether the following consonant is lenis or fortis . 
 The vowels / ɨ ə / only occur in unstressed syllables and are a result of vowel reduction . Some dialects do not distinguish them , so that roses and comma end in the same vowel , a dialect feature called weak vowel merger . GA has an unstressed r @-@ coloured schwa / <unk> / , as in butter [ <unk> ] , which in RP has the same vowel as the word @-@ final vowel in comma . 
 = = = Phonotactics = = = 
 An English syllable includes a syllable nucleus consisting of a vowel sound . Syllable onset and coda ( start and end ) are optional . A syllable can start with up to three consonant sounds , as in sprint / <unk> / , and end with up to four , as in texts / <unk> / . This gives an English syllable the following structure , ( CCC ) V ( <unk> ) where C represents a consonant and V a vowel . The consonants that may appear together in onsets or codas are restricted , as is the order in which they may appear . <unk> can only have four types of consonant clusters : a stop and approximant , as in play ; a voiceless fricative and approximant , as in fly or sly ; s and a voiceless stop , as in stay ; and s , a voiceless stop , and an approximant , as in string . Clusters of nasal and stop are only allowed in codas . Clusters of obstruents always agree in voicing , and clusters of sibilants and of plosives with the same point of articulation are prohibited . Furthermore , several consonants have limited distributions : / h / can only occur in syllable initial position , and / ŋ / only in syllable final position . 
 = = = Stress , rhythm and intonation = = = 
 Stress plays an important role in English . Certain syllables are stressed , while others are unstressed . Stress is a combination of duration , intensity , vowel quality , and sometimes changes in pitch . Stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables , and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently reduced while vowels in stressed syllables are not . Some words , primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as can , have weak and strong forms depending on whether they occur in stressed or non @-@ stressed position within a sentence . 
 Stress in English is phonemic , and some pairs of words are distinguished by stress . For instance , the word contract is stressed on the first syllable ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ <unk> ) when used as a noun , but on the last syllable ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ <unk> ) for most meanings ( for example , " reduce in size " ) when used as a verb . Here stress is connected to vowel reduction : in the noun " contract " the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel / ɒ / , but in the verb " contract " the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to / ə / . Stress is also used to distinguish between words and phrases , so that a compound word receives a single stress unit , but the corresponding phrase has two : e.g. to <unk> <unk> versus a <unk> , and a <unk> versus a <unk> <unk> . 
 In terms of rhythm , English is generally described as a stress @-@ timed language , meaning that the amount of time between stressed syllables tends to be equal . Stressed syllables are pronounced longer , but unstressed syllables ( syllables between stresses ) are shortened . Vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well , and vowel shortening causes changes in vowel quality : vowel reduction . 
 = = = Regional variation = = = 
 Varieties of English vary the most in pronunciation of vowels , and are categorised generally into two groups : British ( BrE ) and American ( AmE ) . Because North America was settled in the late 17th century , American and Canadian English had time to diverge greatly from other varieties of English during centuries when transoceanic travel was slow . Australian , New Zealand , and South African English , on the other hand , were settled in the 19th century , shortly before ocean @-@ going steamships became commonplace , so they show close similarities to the English of South East England . The English spoken in Ireland and Scottish English fall between these two groups . Some differences between the various dialects are shown in the table " Varieties of Standard English and their features " . 
 English has undergone many historical sound changes , some of them affecting all varieties , and others affecting only a few . Most standard varieties are affected by the Great Vowel Shift , which changed the pronunciation of long vowels , but a few dialects have slightly different results . In North America , a number of chain shifts such as the Northern Cities Vowel Shift and Canadian Shift have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents . 
 Some dialects have fewer or more consonant phonemes and phones than the standard varieties . Some conservative varieties like Scottish English have a voiceless [ ʍ ] sound in whine that contrasts with the voiced [ w ] in wine , but most other dialects pronounce both words with voiced [ w ] , a dialect feature called wine – whine merger . The unvoiced velar fricative sound / x / is found in Scottish English , which distinguishes loch / <unk> / from lock / <unk> / . Accents like Cockney with " h @-@ dropping " lack the glottal fricative / h / , and dialects with th @-@ stopping and th @-@ fronting like African American Vernacular and Estuary English do not have the dental fricatives / θ , ð / , but replace them with dental or alveolar stops / t , d / or labiodental fricatives / f , v / . Other changes affecting the phonology of local varieties are processes such as <unk> @-@ dropping , <unk> @-@ coalescence , and reduction of consonant clusters . 
 General American and Received Pronunciation vary in their pronunciation of historical / r / after a vowel at the end of a syllable ( in the syllable coda ) . GA is a rhotic dialect , meaning that it pronounces / r / at the end of a syllable , but RP is non @-@ rhotic , meaning that it loses / r / in that position . English dialects are classified as rhotic or non @-@ rhotic depending on whether they <unk> / r / like RP or keep it like GA . 
 There is complex dialectal variation in words with the open front and open back vowels / æ ɑː ɒ <unk> / . These four vowels are only distinguished in RP , Australia , New Zealand and South Africa . In GA , these vowels merge to three / æ ɑ ɔ / , and in Canadian English they merge to two / æ ɑ / . In addition , the words that have each vowel vary by dialect . The table " Dialects and open vowels " shows this variation with lexical sets in which these sounds occur . 
 = = Grammar = = 
 Modern English grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo @-@ European dependent marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order , to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection , a fairly fixed SVO word order and a complex syntax . Some traits typical of Germanic languages persist in English , such as the distinction between irregularly inflected strong stems inflected through ablaut ( i.e. changing the vowel of the stem , as in the pairs speak / spoke and foot / feet ) and weak stems inflected through affixation ( such as love / loved , hand / hands ) . Vestiges of the case and gender system are found in the pronoun system ( he / him , who / whom ) and in the inflection of the copula verb to be . Typically for an Indo @-@ European language , English follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment . English distinguishes at least seven major word classes : verbs , nouns , adjectives , adverbs , determiners ( i.e. articles ) , prepositions , and conjunctions . Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns , and subdivide conjunctions into <unk> and coordinators , and add the class of interjections . English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs , such as have and do , expressing the categories of mood and aspect . Questions are marked by do @-@ support , wh @-@ movement ( fronting of question words beginning with wh- ) and word order inversion with some verbs . 
 The seven word classes are exemplified in this sample sentence : 
 = = = Nouns and noun phrases = = = 
 English nouns are only inflected for number and possession . New nouns can be formed through derivation or compounding . They are semantically divided into proper nouns ( names ) and common nouns . Common nouns are in turn divided into concrete and abstract nouns , and grammatically into count nouns and mass nouns . 
 Most count nouns are inflected for plural number through the use of the plural suffix -s , but a few nouns have irregular plural forms . Mass nouns can only be pluralised through the use of a count noun classifier , e.g. one loaf of bread , two loaves of bread . 
 Regular plural formation : 
 Singular : cat , dog 
 Plural : cats , dogs 
 Irregular plural formation : 
 Singular : man , woman , foot , fish , ox , knife , mouse 
 Plural : men , women , feet , fish , oxen , knives , mice 
 Possession can be expressed either by the possessive enclitic -s ( also traditionally called a genitive suffix ) , or by the preposition of . Historically the -s possessive has been used for animate nouns , whereas the of possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns . Today this distinction is less clear , and many speakers use -s also with <unk> . Orthographically the possessive -s is separated from the noun root with an apostrophe . 
 Possessive constructions : 
 With -s : The woman 's husband 's child 
 With of : The child of the husband of the woman 
 Nouns can form noun phrases ( <unk> ) where they are the syntactic head of the words that depend on them such as determiners , <unk> , conjunctions or adjectives . Noun phrases can be short , such as the man , composed only of a determiner and a noun . They can also include modifiers such as adjectives ( e.g. red , tall , all ) and specifiers such as determiners ( e.g. the , that ) . But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP , using conjunctions such as and , or prepositions such as with , e.g. the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles ( this NP uses conjunctions , prepositions , specifiers and modifiers ) . Regardless of length , an NP functions as a syntactic unit . For example , the possessive enclitic can , in cases which do not lead to ambiguity , follow the entire noun phrase , as in The President of India 's wife , where the enclitic follows India and not President . 
 The class of determiners is used to specify the noun they precede in terms of definiteness , where the marks a definite noun and a or an an indefinite one . A definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor , whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known . <unk> , which include one , many , some and all , are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number . The noun must agree with the number of the determiner , e.g. one man ( sg . ) but all men ( pl . ) . <unk> are the first constituents in a noun phrase . 
 = = = = Adjectives = = = = 
 Adjectives modify a noun by providing additional information about their referents . In English , adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after determiners . In Modern English , adjectives are not inflected , and they do not agree in form with the noun they modify , as adjectives in most other Indo @-@ European languages do . For example , in the phrases the slender boy , and many slender girls , the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun . 
 Some adjectives are inflected for degree of comparison , with the positive degree unmarked , the suffix -er marking the comparative , and <unk> marking the superlative : a small boy , the boy is smaller than the girl , that boy is the smallest . Some adjectives have irregular comparative and superlative forms , such as good , better , and best . Other adjectives have <unk> formed by periphrastic constructions , with the adverb more marking the comparative , and most marking the superlative : happier or more happy , the happiest or most happy . There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison , and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common at the expense of the inflected form . 
 = = = = Pronouns , case and person = = = = 
 English pronouns conserve many traits of case and gender inflection . The personal pronouns retain a difference between subjective and objective case in most persons ( I / me , he / him , she / her , we / us , they / them ) as well as a gender and <unk> distinction in the third person singular ( distinguishing he / she / it ) . The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case , and the objective case is used both in the sense of the previous accusative case ( in the role of patient , or direct object of a transitive verb ) , and in the sense of the Old English dative case ( in the role of a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb ) . Subjective case is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause , and otherwise the objective case is used . While already grammarians such as Henry Sweet and Otto Jespersen noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system , some contemporary grammars , for example Huddleston & Pullum ( 2002 ) , retain traditional labels for the cases , calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively . 
 Possessive pronouns exist in dependent and independent forms ; the dependent form functions as a determiner specifying a noun ( as in my chair ) , while the independent form can stand alone as if it were a noun ( e.g. the chair is mine ) . The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address , and the forms for 2nd person plural and singular are identical except in the reflexive form . Some dialects have introduced innovative 2nd person plural pronouns such as y 'all found in Southern American English and African American ( Vernacular ) English or <unk> and ye found in Irish English . 
 Pronouns are used to refer to entities <unk> or <unk> . A deictic pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situation — for example the pronoun I identifies the speaker , and the pronoun you , the addressee . <unk> pronouns such as that refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience , for example in the sentence I already told you that . The reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase ( e.g. " he sent it to himself " or " she braced herself for impact " ) . 
 = = = = Prepositions = = = = 
 Prepositional phrases ( PP ) are phrases composed of a preposition and one or more nouns , e.g. with the dog , for my friend , to school , in England . Prepositions have a wide range of uses in English . They are used to describing movement , place , and other relations between different entities , but they also have many syntactic uses such as introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs . For example , in the phrase I gave it to him , the preposition to marks the recipient , or Indirect Object of the verb to give . Traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded , for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form , " with her " , " to me " , " for us " . But some contemporary grammars such as Huddleston & Pullum ( 2002 : 598 – 600 ) no longer consider government and case to be defining for the class of prepositions , rather defining prepositions as words that can function as the heads of prepositional phrases . 
 = = = Verbs and verb phrases = = = 
 English verbs are inflected for tense and aspect , and marked for agreement with third person singular subject . Only the copula verb to be is still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects . Auxiliary verbs such as have and be are paired with verbs in the infinitive , past , or progressive forms . They form complex tenses , aspects , and moods . Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in that they can be followed by the negation , and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence . 
 Most verbs have six inflectional forms . The primary forms are a plain present , a third person singular present , and a preterite ( past ) form . The secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive , a gerund – participle and a past participle . The copula verb to be is the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation , and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject . The first person present tense form is am , the third person singular form is and the form are is used second person singular and all three plurals . The only verb past participle is been and its gerund @-@ participle is being . 
 = = = = Tense , aspect and mood = = = = 
 English has two primary tenses , past ( preterit ) and non @-@ past . The preterit is inflected by using the preterit form of the verb , which for the regular verbs includes the suffix -ed , and for the strong verbs either the suffix -t or a change in the stem vowel . The non @-@ past form is unmarked except in the third person singular , which takes the suffix -s . 
 English does not have a <unk> future tense . Futurity of action is expressed <unk> with one of the auxiliary verbs will or shall . Many varieties also use a near future constructed with the phrasal verb be going to . 
 Further aspectual distinctions are encoded by the use of auxiliary verbs , primarily have and be , which encode the contrast between a perfect and non @-@ perfect past tense ( I have run vs. I was running ) , and compound tenses such as preterite perfect ( I had been running ) and present perfect ( I have been running ) . 
 For the expression of mood , English uses a number of modal auxiliaries , such as can , may , will , shall and the past tense forms could , might , would , should . There is also a subjunctive and an imperative mood , both based on the plain form of the verb ( i.e. without the third person singular -s ) , and which is used in subordinate clauses ( e.g. subjunctive : It is important that he run every day ; imperative Run ! ) . 
 An infinitive form , that uses the plain form of the verb and the preposition to , is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause . Finite verbal clauses are those that are formed around a verb in the present or preterit form . In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause . For example , he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive , or in a complement clause such as I saw him leave , where the main verb is to see which is in a preterite form , and leave is in the infinitive . 
 = = = = <unk> verbs = = = = 
 English also makes frequent use of constructions traditionally called phrasal verbs , verb phrases that are made up of a verb root and a preposition or particle which follows the verb . The phrase then functions as a single predicate . In terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb , but in writing it is written as a separate word . Examples of phrasal verbs are to get up , to ask out , to back up , to give up , to get together , to hang out , to put up with , etc . The phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement ( e.g. lay off meaning terminate someone 's employment ) . In spite of the idiomatic meaning , some grammarians , including Huddleston & Pullum ( 2002 ) : 274 , do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term " phrasal verb " . Instead they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement , i.e. he woke up in the morning and he ran up in the mountains are syntactically equivalent . 
 = = = = Adverbs = = = = 
 The function of adverbs is to modify the action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about the manner in which it occurs . Many adverbs are derived from adjectives with the suffix <unk> , but not all , and many speakers tend to omit the suffix in the most commonly used adverbs . For example , in the phrase the woman walked quickly the adverb quickly derived from the adjective quick describes the woman 's way of walking . Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms , such as good which has the adverbial form well . 
 = = = Syntax = = = 
 Modern English syntax language is moderately analytic . It has developed features such as modal verbs and word order as resources for conveying meaning . Auxiliary verbs mark constructions such as questions , negative polarity , the passive voice and progressive aspect . 
 = = = = Basic constituent order = = = = 
 English word order has moved from the Germanic verb @-@ second ( V2 ) word order to being almost exclusively subject – verb – object ( SVO ) . The combination of SVO order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence , such as he had hoped to try to open it . 
 In most sentences English only marks grammatical relations through word order . The subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it . The example below demonstrates how the grammatical roles of each constituent is marked only by the position relative to the verb : 
 An exception is found in sentences where one of the constituents is a pronoun , in which case it is doubly marked , both by word order and by case inflection , where the subject pronoun precedes the verb and takes the subjective case form , and the object pronoun follows the verb and takes the objective case form . The example below demonstrates this double marking in a sentence where both object and subject is represented with a third person singular masculine pronoun : 
 Indirect objects ( IO ) of <unk> verbs can be placed either as the first object in a double object construction ( S V IO O ) , such as I gave Jane the book or in a prepositional phrase , such as I gave the book to Jane 
 = = = = Clause syntax = = = = 
 In English a sentence may be composed of one or more clauses , that may in turn be composed of one or more phrases ( e.g. Noun Phrases , Verb Phrases , and Prepositional Phrases ) . A clause is built around a verb , and includes its constituents , such as any <unk> and <unk> . Within a sentence one clause is always the main clause ( or matrix clause ) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it . Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause . For example , in the phrase I think ( that ) you are lying , the main clause is headed by the verb think , the subject is I , but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause ( that ) you are lying . The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause , but it is often omitted . Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause : For example , in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today , the relative clause that you received today specifies the meaning of the word letter , the object of the main clause . Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who , whose , whom and which as well as by that ( which can also be omitted . ) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses . 
 = = = = Auxiliary verb constructions = = = = 
 English syntax relies on auxiliary verbs for many functions including the expression of tense , aspect and mood . Auxiliary verbs form main clauses , and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb . For example , in the sentence the dog did not find its bone , the clause find its bone is the complement of the negated verb did not . Subject – auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions , including focus , negation , and interrogative constructions . 
 The verb do can be used as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences , where it usually serves to add emphasis , as in " I did shut the fridge . " However , in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above , it is used because the rules of English syntax permit these constructions only when an auxiliary is present . Modern English does not allow the addition of the negating adverb not to an ordinary finite lexical verb , as in * I know not — it can only be added to an auxiliary ( or <unk> ) verb , hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required , the auxiliary do is used , to produce a form like I do not ( don 't ) know . The same applies in clauses requiring inversion , including most questions — inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb , so it is not possible to say * Know you him ? ; grammatical rules require Do you know him ? 
 Negation is done with the adverb not , which precedes the main verb and follows an auxiliary verb . A contracted form of not -n 't can be used as an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb to be . Just as with questions , many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do @-@ support , thus in Modern English I don 't know him is the correct answer to the question Do you know him ? , but not * I know him not , although this construction may be found in older English . 
 Passive constructions also use auxiliary verbs . A passive construction <unk> an active construction in such a way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase , and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase . They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb to be or to get , although not all varieties of English allow the use of <unk> with get . For example , putting the sentence she sees him into the passive becomes he is seen ( by her ) , or he gets seen ( by her ) . 
 = = = = Questions = = = = 
 Both yes – no questions and wh @-@ questions in English are mostly formed using subject – auxiliary inversion ( Am I going tomorrow ? , Where can we eat ? ) , which may require do @-@ support ( Do you like her ? , Where did he go ? ) . In most cases , interrogative words ( wh @-@ words ; e.g. what , who , where , when , why , how ) appear in a fronted position . For example , in the question What did you see ? , the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence . ( When the wh @-@ word is the subject or forms part of the subject , no inversion occurs : Who saw the cat ? . ) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question 's theme , e.g. To whose house did you go last night ? . The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case , with the variant whom serving as the objective case form , although this form may be going out of use in many contexts . 
 = = = = Discourse level syntax = = = = 
 At the discourse level English tends to use a topic @-@ comment structure , where the known information ( topic ) precedes the new information ( comment ) . Because of the strict SVO syntax , the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence . In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence , frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means . One way of doing this is through a passive construction , the girl was stung by the bee . Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there , e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung , there was a girl who was stung by a bee . Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs ( e.g. , it is raining ) or in existential clauses ( there are many cars on the street ) . Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with <unk> vacuous subjects , English is able to maintain both a topic comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax . 
 Focus constructions emphasise a particular piece of new or salient information within a sentence , generally through allocating the main sentence level stress on the focal constituent . For example , the girl was stung by a bee ( emphasising it was a bee and not for example a wasp that stung her ) , or The girl was stung by a bee ( contrasting with another possibility , for example that it was the boy ) . Topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation , either <unk> or <unk> the item to be focused on relative to the main clause . For example , That girl over there , she was stung by a bee , emphasises the girl by preposition , but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition , she was stung by a bee , that girl over there , where reference to the girl is established as an " afterthought " . 
 Cohesion between sentences is achieved through the use of deictic pronouns as anaphora ( e.g. that is exactly what I mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors , or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event ) . Discourse markers such as oh , so or well , also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion . Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences . Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said , for example , no way is that true ! ( the idiomatic marker no way ! expressing disbelief ) , or boy ! I 'm hungry ( the marker boy expressing emphasis ) . While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English , they are also used in written and formal registers . 
 = = Vocabulary = = 
 The vocabulary of English is vast , and counting exactly how many words English ( or any language ) has is impossible . The Oxford Dictionaries suggest that there are at least a quarter of a million distinct English words . Early studies of English vocabulary by lexicographers , the scholars who formally study vocabulary , compile dictionaries , or both , were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good @-@ quality linguistic corpora , collections of actual written texts and spoken passages . Many statements published before the end of the 20th century about the growth of English vocabulary over time , the dates of first use of various words in English , and the sources of English vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes available . 
 = = = Word formation processes = = = 
 English forms new words from existing words or roots in its vocabulary through a variety of processes . One of the most productive processes in English is conversion , using a word with a different grammatical role , for example using a noun as a verb or a verb as a noun . Another productive word @-@ formation process is nominal compounding , producing compound words such as babysitter or ice cream or homesick . A process more common in Old English than in Modern English , but still productive in Modern English , is the use of derivational suffixes ( <unk> , <unk> , -ing , <unk> ) to derive new words from existing words ( especially those of Germanic origin ) or stems ( especially for words of Latin or Greek origin ) . Formation of new words , called neologisms , based on Greek or Latin roots ( for example television or optometry ) is a highly productive process in English and in most modern European languages , so much so that it is often difficult to determine in which language a neologism originated . For this reason , lexicographer Philip Gove attributed many such words to the " international scientific vocabulary " ( <unk> ) when compiling Webster 's Third New International Dictionary ( 1961 ) . Another active word @-@ formation process in English is acronyms , words formed by pronouncing as a single word abbreviations of longer phrases ( e.g. NATO , laser ) . 
 = = = Word origins = = = 
 English , besides forming new words from existing words and their roots , also borrows words from other languages . This process of adding words from other languages is commonplace in many world languages , but English is characterised as being especially open to borrowing of foreign words throughout the last 1 @,@ 000 years . The most commonly used words in English are West Germanic . The words in English learned first by children as they learn to speak , particularly the grammatical words that dominate the word count of both spoken and written texts , are the Germanic words inherited from the earliest periods of the development of Old English . But one of the consequences of long language contact between French and English in all stages of their development is that the vocabulary of English has a very high percentage of " Latinate " words ( derived from French , especially , and also from Latin or from other Romance languages ) . French words from various periods of the development of French now make up one @-@ third of the vocabulary of English . 
 English has also borrowed many words directly from Latin , the ancestor of the Romance languages , during all stages of its development . Many of the words borrowed into English from Latin were earlier borrowed into Latin from Greek . Latin or Greek are still highly productive sources of stems used to form vocabulary of subjects learned in higher education such as the sciences , philosophy , and mathematics . English continues to gain new loanwords and calques ( " loan translations " ) from languages all over the world , and words from languages other than the ancestral Anglo @-@ Saxon language make up about 60 percent of the vocabulary of English . English has formal and informal speech registers , and informal registers , including child directed speech , tend to be made up predominantly of words of Anglo @-@ Saxon origin , while the percentage of vocabulary that is of Latinate origin is higher in legal , scientific , and academic texts . 
 = = = English loanwords and calques in other languages = = = 
 English has a strong influence on the vocabulary of other languages . The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language , the role of English as a world lingua franca , and the large number of books and films that are translated from English into other languages . That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies . Among varieties of English , it is especially American English that influences other languages . Some languages , such as Chinese , write words borrowed from English mostly as calques , while others , such as Japanese , readily take in English loanwords written in sound @-@ indicating script . Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe . 
 = = Writing system = = 
 Since the ninth century , English has been written in a Latin alphabet ( also called Roman alphabet ) . Earlier Old English texts in Anglo @-@ Saxon runes are only short inscriptions . The great majority of literary works in Old English that survive to today are written in the Roman alphabet . The modern English alphabet contains 26 letters of the Latin script : a , b , c , d , e , f , g , h , i , j , k , l , m , n , o , p , q , r , s , t , u , v , w , x , y , z ( which also have capital forms : A , B , C , D , E , F , G , H , I , J , K , L , M , N , O , P , Q , R , S , T , U , V , W , X , Y , Z ) . 
 The spelling system , or orthography , of English is multi @-@ layered , with elements of French , Latin , and Greek spelling on top of the native Germanic system . Further complications have arisen through sound changes with which the orthography has not kept pace . Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms , English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is pronounced . There are also systematic spelling differences between British and American English . These situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in English . 
 Although letters and speech sounds do not have a one @-@ to @-@ one correspondence in standard English spelling , spelling rules that take into account syllable structure , phonetic changes in derived words , and word accent are reliable for most English words . Moreover , standard English spelling shows etymological relationships between related words that would be obscured by a closer correspondence between pronunciation and spelling , for example the words photograph , photography , and photographic , or the words electricity and electrical . While few scholars agree with Chomsky and Halle ( 1968 ) that conventional English orthography is " near @-@ optimal " , there is a rationale for current English spelling patterns . The standard orthography of English is the most widely used writing system in the world . Standard English spelling is based on a <unk> segmentation of words into written clues of what meaningful units make up each word . 
 Readers of English can generally rely on the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation to be fairly regular for letters or digraphs used to spell consonant sounds . The letters b , d , f , h , j , k , l , m , n , p , r , s , t , v , w , y , z represent , respectively , the phonemes / b , d , f , h , dʒ , k , l , m , n , p , r , s , t , v , w , j , z / . The letters c and g normally represent / k / and / ɡ / , but there is also a soft c pronounced / s / , and a soft g pronounced / dʒ / . The differences in the pronunciations of the letters c and g are often signalled by the following letters in standard English spelling . <unk> used to represent phonemes and phoneme sequences include ch for / tʃ / , sh for / ʃ / , th for / θ / or / ð / , ng for / ŋ / , qu for / kw / , and ph for / f / in Greek @-@ derived words . The single letter x is generally pronounced as / z / in word @-@ initial position and as / ks / otherwise . There are exceptions to these generalisations , often the result of loanwords being spelled according to the spelling patterns of their languages of origin or proposals by pedantic scholars in the early period of Modern English to mistakenly follow the spelling patterns of Latin for English words of Germanic origin . 
 For the vowel sounds of the English language , however , correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are more irregular . There are many more vowel phonemes in English than there are vowel letters ( a , e , i , o , u , w , y ) . As a result of a smaller set of single letter symbols than the set of vowel phonemes , some " long vowels " are often indicated by combinations of letters ( like the oa in boat , the ow in how , and the ay in stay ) , or the historically based silent e ( as in note and cake ) . 
 The consequence of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in English . It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages , including Italian , Spanish , or German . Nonetheless , there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound @-@ symbol regularities that occur in the standard English spellings of commonly used words . Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English . Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English . 
 English writing also includes a system of punctuation that is similar to the system of punctuation marks used in most alphabetic languages around the world . The purpose of punctuation is to mark meaningful grammatical relationships in sentences to aid readers in understanding a text and to indicate features important for reading a text aloud . 
 = = Dialects , accents , and varieties = = 
 <unk> distinguish between English dialects , regional varieties that differ from each other in terms of grammar and vocabulary , and regional accents , distinguished by different patterns of pronunciation . The major native dialects of English are often divided by linguists into the two general categories of the British dialects ( BrE ) and those of North America ( AmE ) . 
 = = = UK and Ireland = = = 
 As the place where English first evolved , the British Isles , and particularly England , are home to the most variegated pattern of dialects . Within the United Kingdom , the Received Pronunciation ( RP ) , an educated dialect of South East England , is traditionally used as the broadcast standard , and is considered the most prestigious of the British dialects . The spread of RP ( also known as BBC English ) through the media has caused many traditional dialects of rural England to recede , as youths adopt the traits of the prestige variety instead of traits from local dialects . At the time of the Survey of English Dialects , grammar and vocabulary differed across the country , but a process of lexical attrition has led most of this variation to disappear . Nonetheless this attrition has mostly affected dialectal variation in grammar and vocabulary , and in fact only 3 percent of the English population actually speak RP , the remainder speaking regional accents and dialects with varying degrees of RP influence . There is also variability within RP , particularly along class lines between Upper and Middle class RP speakers and between native RP speakers and speakers who adopt RP later in life . Within Britain there is also considerable variation along lines of social class , and some traits though exceedingly common are considered " non @-@ standard " and are associated with lower class speakers and identities . An example of this is H @-@ dropping , which was historically a feature of lower class London English , particularly Cockney , but which today is the standard in all major English cities — yet it remains largely absent in broadcasting and among the upper crust of British society . 
 English in England can be divided into four major dialect regions , Southwest English , South East English , Midlands English , and Northern English . Within each of these regions several local subdialects exist : Within the Northern region , there is a division between the Yorkshire dialects , and the Geordie dialect spoken in Northumbria around Newcastle , and the Lancashire dialects with local urban dialects in Liverpool ( Scouse ) and Manchester ( Mancunian ) . Having been the centre of Danish occupation during the Viking Invasions , Northern English dialects , particularly the Yorkshire dialect , retain Norse features not found in other English varieties . 
 Since the 15th century , Southeastern varieties centred around London , which has been the centre from which dialectal innovations have spread to other dialects . In London , the Cockney dialect was traditionally used by the lower classes , and it was long a socially stigmatised variety . Today a large area of Southeastern England has adopted traits from Cockney , resulting in the so @-@ called Estuary English which spread in areas south and East of London beginning in the 1980s . Estuary English is distinguished by traits such as the use of intrusive R ( drawing is pronounced <unk> / <unk> / ) , t @-@ <unk> ( Potter is pronounced with a glottal stop as Po 'er / <unk> / ) , and the pronunciation of <unk> as / f / ( thanks pronounced <unk> ) or / v / ( bother pronounced <unk> ) . 
 Scots is today considered a separate language from English , but it has its origins in early Northern Middle English and developed and changed during its history with influence from other sources , particularly Scots Gaelic and Old Norse . Scots itself has a number of regional dialects . And in addition to Scots , Scottish English are the varieties of Standard English spoken in Scotland , most varieties are Northern English accents , with some influence from Scots . 
 In Ireland , various forms of English have been spoken since the Norman invasions of the 11th century . In County Wexford , in the area surrounding Dublin , two highly conservative dialects known as Forth and <unk> and <unk> developed as offshoots from Early Middle English , and were spoken until the 19th century . Modern Hiberno @-@ English however has its roots in English colonisation in the 17th century . Today Irish English is divided into Ulster English , a dialect with strong influence from Scots , and southern Hiberno @-@ English . Like Scots and Northern English , the Irish accents preserve the rhoticity which has been lost in most dialects influenced by RP . 
 = = = North America = = = 
 American English is generally considered fairly homogeneous compared to the British varieties . Today , American accent variation is in fact increasing , though most Americans still speak within a phonological continuum of similar accents , known collectively as General American ( GA ) , with its differing accents hardly noticed even among Americans themselves ( such as Midland and Western American English ) . Separate from GA are American accents with clearly distinct sound systems ; this historically includes Southern American English , English of the coastal Northeast ( famously including Eastern New England English and New York City English ) , and African American Vernacular English . Canadian English , except for the Maritime provinces , may be classified under GA as well , but it often shows unique vowel raising , as well as distinct norms for written and pronunciation standards . In GA and Canadian English , rhoticity ( or r @-@ fulness ) is dominant , with non @-@ rhoticity ( r @-@ dropping ) becoming associated with lower prestige and social class especially after World War II ; this contrasts with the situation in England , where non @-@ rhoticity has become the standard . 
 In Southern American English , the largest American " accent group " outside of GA , rhoticity now prevails , replacing the region 's historical non @-@ rhotic prestige , though social variation may still apply . Southern accents are often colloquially described as a " drawl " or " twang , " being recognised most readily by the Southern Vowel Shift that begins with glide @-@ deleting in the / aɪ / vowel ( e.g. pronouncing spy almost like spa ) , the " Southern breaking " of several front pure vowels into a gliding vowel or even two syllables ( e.g. pronouncing the word " press " almost like " pray @-@ us " ) , the pin – pen merger , and other distinctive features , many of which are actually recent developments of the 19th century or later . 
 Today spoken primarily by <unk> and middle @-@ class African Americans , African American Vernacular English ( AAVE ) is also largely non @-@ rhotic and likely originated among enslaved Africans and African Americans influenced primarily by the non @-@ rhotic , non @-@ standard English spoken by whites in the Old South . A minority of linguists , contrarily , propose that AAVE mostly traces back to African languages spoken by the slaves who had to develop a pidgin or Creole English to communicate with slaves of other ethnic and linguistic origins . After abolition , most African Americans settled in the inner cities of the North and here AAVE developed to a highly coherent and homogeneous variety . AAVE has often been stigmatised as a form of " broken " or " uneducated " English , as modern Southern American English also often is , but linguists today recognise both as fully developed varieties of English with their own norms shared by a large speech community . 
 = = = Australia and New Zealand = = = 
 Since 1788 English has been spoken in Oceania , and the major native dialect of Australian English is spoken as a first language by the vast majority of the inhabitants of the Australian continent , with General Australian serving as the standard accent . The English of neighbouring New Zealand has to a lesser degree become an influential standard variety of the language . Australian and New Zealand English are most closely related to British English , and both have similarly non @-@ rhotic accents , aside from some accents in the South Island of New Zealand . They stand out , however , for their innovative vowels : many short vowels are fronted or raised , whereas many long vowels have <unk> . Australian English also has a contrast between long and short vowels , not found in most other varieties . Australian English grammar differs from British English only in few instances , one difference is the lack of verbal concord with collective plural subjects . New Zealand English differs little from Australian English , but a few characteristics sets its accent apart , such as the use of [ ʍ ] for wh- and its front vowels being even closer than in Australian English . 
 = = = Africa , the Caribbean , and South Asia = = = 
 English is spoken widely in South Africa and is an official or co @-@ official language in several countries . In South Africa , English has been spoken since 1820 , co @-@ existing with Afrikaans and various African languages such as the <unk> and Bantu languages . Today about 9 percent of the South African population speak South African English ( SAE ) as a first language . SAE is a non @-@ rhotic variety , which tends to follow RP as a norm . It is alone among non @-@ rhotic varieties in lacking intrusive r . There are different L2 varieties that differ based on the native language of the speakers . Most phonological differences from RP are in the vowels . Consonant differences include the tendency to pronounce / p , t , t ͡ ʃ , k / without aspiration ( e.g. / pin / pronounced [ <unk> ] rather than as [ pʰɪn ] as in most other varieties ) , while r is often pronounced as a flap [ <unk> ] instead of as the more common fricative . 
 Several varieties of English are also spoken in the Caribbean Islands that were colonial possessions of Britain , including Jamaica , and the Leeward and Windward Islands and Trinidad and Tobago , Barbados , the Cayman Islands , and Belize . Each of these areas are home both to a local variety of English and a local English based creole , combining English and African languages . The most prominent varieties are Jamaican English and Jamaican Creole . In Central America , English based creoles are spoken in on the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Panama . Locals are often fluent both in the local English variety and the local creole languages and code @-@ switching between them is frequent , indeed another way to conceptualise the relationship between Creole and Standard varieties is to see a spectrum of social registers with the Creole forms serving as " <unk> " and the more RP @-@ like forms serving as the " <unk> " , the most formal register . 
 Most Caribbean varieties are based on British English and consequently most are non @-@ rhotic , except for formal styles of Jamaican English which are often rhotic . Jamaican English differs from RP in its vowel inventory , which has a distinction between long and short vowels rather than tense and lax vowels as in Standard English . The diphthongs / ei / and / ou / are monophthongs [ eː ] and [ oː ] or even the reverse diphthongs [ ie ] and [ <unk> ] ( e.g. bay and boat pronounced [ <unk> ] and [ <unk> ] ) . Often word final consonant clusters are simplified so that " child " is pronounced [ t ͡ <unk> ] and " wind " [ win ] . 
 As a historical legacy , Indian English tends to take RP as its ideal , and how well this ideal is realised in an individual 's speech reflects class distinctions among Indian English speakers . Indian English accents are marked by the pronunciation of phonemes such as / t / and / d / ( often pronounced with retroflex articulation as [ ʈ ] and [ ɖ ] ) and the replacement of / θ / and / ð / with <unk> [ t ̪ ] and [ d ̪ ] . Sometimes Indian English speakers may also use spelling based pronunciations where the silent < h > found in words such as ghost is pronounced as an Indian voiced aspirated stop [ <unk> ] . 
 = Beautiful nuthatch = 
 The beautiful nuthatch ( Sitta formosa , sometimes called Callisitta formosa ) is a bird species in the family Sittidae . It is a large nuthatch , measuring 16 @.@ 5 cm ( 6 @.@ 5 in ) in length , that is not sexually dimorphic . Its coloration and markings are dramatic , the upper parts being black and azure , streaked with white and pale blue on the head and lined with the same colors on the wing feathers . The underparts are orange , and the eyebrow and throat are ochre . An irregular , dark eyestripe highlights its eye . S. formosa 's ecology is not fully described , but it is known to feed on small insects and larvae found on the trunks and epiphyte @-@ covered branches of trees in its range . Reproduction takes place from April to May ; the nest is placed in the hole of an oak , rhododendron , or other large tree . The nest is made of plant material and fur in which the bird typically lays four to six eggs . 
 Although the species is found in most of the countries making up the mainland of Southeast Asia , it appears to be rare throughout its range , its population being highly localized where it is found . The bird nests predominantly in mountain forests at an altitudinal range from 950 m ( 3 @,@ 120 ft ) up to nearly 2 @,@ 300 m ( 7 @,@ 500 ft ) , with some seasonal height adjustment , down to around 300 m ( 980 ft ) in winter . Its apparent localization within its range makes rigorous estimates of its population difficult , but its habitat is threatened by deforestation and the species appear to be in decline . It has been classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The nuthatches constitute a genus – Sitta – of small passerine birds belonging to the family , Sittidae , typified by short , compressed wings and short , square 12 @-@ feathered tails , a compact body , longish pointed bills , strong toes with long claws , and behaviorally , by their unique head @-@ first manner of descending tree trunks . Most nuthatches have gray or bluish upperparts and a black eyestripe . Sitta is derived from the Ancient Greek name for nuthatches , σιττη , sittē . " Nuthatch " , first recorded in 1350 , is derived from " nut " and a word probably related to " hack " , since these birds hack at nuts they have wedged into crevices . The genus may be further divided into seven subgenera , of which the beautiful nuthatch is placed alone in Callisitta ( Bonaparte , 1850 ) , and the species is therefore sometimes called Callisitta Formosa . 
 The beautiful nuthatch was first described in 1843 by British zoologist Edward Blyth , from a specimen he examined in Darjeeling . Its kinship with other members of the genus is unclear . The bright blue color of its plumage invites a comparison to the blue nuthatch ( S. <unk> ) , or other blue @-@ tinted nuthatch species such as the velvet @-@ fronted nuthatch ( S. frontalis ) , yellow @-@ billed nuthatch ( S. <unk> ) and the sulphur @-@ billed nuthatch ( S. <unk> ) , but its distribution being focused in the eastern Himalayas , and the uniqueness of its plumage , argues against the assumption . According to the International Ornithological Congress and ornithologist Alan P. Peterson , no subspecies have been identified . 
 In 2014 , Eric Pasquet , et al. published a phylogeny based on examination of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of 21 nuthatch species . The position of the beautiful nuthatch within the genus was not established with certainty , having a far lower statistical association than others in the model . Nevertheless , under the findings the species appears closest evolutionarily to three clades of nuthatches : two nuthatches that prefer rocky environments , the western rock nuthatch ( S. <unk> ) and the eastern rock nuthatch ( S. <unk> ) ; species in the " europaea " group , including the Eurasian nuthatch ( S. europaea ) , Siberian nuthatch ( S. arctica ) , chestnut @-@ vented nuthatch ( S. <unk> ) , Kashmir nuthatch ( S. <unk> ) , Indian nuthatch ( S. castanea ) , chestnut @-@ bellied nuthatch ( S. <unk> ) and the Burmese nuthatch ( S. <unk> ) ; as well as the white @-@ tailed nuthatch ( S. himalayensis ) , and therefore , the white @-@ browed nuthatch ( S. victoriae ) . These close relatives are generally all species that plaster the entrance to their nest with mud . 
 = = Description = = 
 Described by Erik <unk> in his 1998 treatise The Nuthatches as a bird that " deserves its name " , the beautiful nuthatch has highly distinctive plumage . Its upperparts are black and azure , and it is orange on the underparts . The crown and upper mantle are black , streaked with pale blue and white . The scapulars , back and rump are an azure blue . The greater and medium coverts are black , finely edged with white , forming two narrow wing bars ; the flight feathers are black and more or less lined with pale blue . The eyebrow and throat are white and buff and the eye is highlighted by an irregular , dark eyestripe . Under the wing , the white base of the primary coverts contrasts sharply with gray undertail @-@ coverts , a distinguishing trait when viewing the bird in flight . The iris is reddish @-@ brown or dark brown and the bill is black but for a whitish tinge at the base of the lower mandible . The lower parts are generally orange @-@ cinnamon . The legs and feet are yellowish @-@ brown , olive @-@ brown or greenish @-@ brown . 
 There is no sexual dimorphism . Juveniles are very similar to adults , but the streaks on the mantle are blue rather than white . The primary coverts of juveniles are also more closely lined with blue , and the underparts are paler overall , especially on the chest . Adults perform a complete moult after the breeding season , whereas juveniles only have a partial moult , in which they replace a variable number of rectrices . 
 The bird is large as compared with other members of the Sitta genus , measuring 16 @.@ 5 cm ( 6 @.@ 5 in ) in length . The folded wing measure 98 – 109 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 – 4 @.@ 3 in ) in males and 97 – 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 8 – 3 @.@ 9 in ) in females . The tail is 48 – 60 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 – 2 @.@ 4 in ) in males and 52 – 56 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 – 2 @.@ 2 in ) in females . The beak measures between 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) and 24 @.@ 9 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) and the tarsus is 19 – 22 mm ( 0 @.@ 75 – 0 @.@ 87 in ) in length . The weight is not known .

 S. formosa 's vocalizations are not well known , but its song is described as " low and sweet in tone " . Its call is typical of nuthatches , and similar to that of the Eurasian nuthatch ( Sitta europaea ) , but less strident . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The beautiful nuthatch forages alone , in pairs or in small groups of four to five individuals , though an unusual gathering of 21 individuals was observed in one tree in Bhutan . It often takes part in mixed @-@ species foraging flocks , and has been notably observed feeding with the Himalayan <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) and the velvet @-@ fronted nuthatch ( Sitta frontalis ) – two other species that prospect for food on tree trunks . Other foraging flock partners surveyed are the long @-@ tailed <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , the lesser racket @-@ tailed drongo ( Dicrurus <unk> ) , the maroon oriole ( <unk> <unk> ) and the white @-@ browed scimitar babbler ( <unk> <unk> ) . 
 S. formosa forages from about the middle to the apex of tall trees , exploring the trunks and epiphyte @-@ covered branches ( lichens , mosses , orchids ) , for small insects , but also prospect on outermost branches . In Laos , individuals were observed feeding while perched on the larger branches of a Fokienia evergreen ( Fokienia <unk> ) – a tree frequently enveloped in epiphytes . The bird has been described at times as the most timid of nuthatches . It prospects in a manner typical of many others in its genus , sometimes hanging upside down for an extended time surveying its surroundings . As compared with other nuthatch , the species has been described as working " unhurriedly " , as they peck at trunks , lichen and other epiphytes , searching for prey . Stomach contents of collected Chinese specimens consisted of beetles and insect larvae . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Reproduction in the species has not been well studied . In the northeast of India , the breeding season is from April to May . The nest is placed off the ground , between two and eight meters high , and is often built in a hole of a ( living or dead ) oak or rhododendron tree , or sometimes in other large trees . Nests are constructed using leaves and bark , held together with hair , often that of bamboo rats . If the opening of the hole is too large , it is cemented with mud to reduce the entrance size . The bird usually lays four to six white eggs , speckled with red spots , that measure 20 @.@ 8 mm × 15 @.@ 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 82 in × 0 @.@ 60 in ) . Beautiful nuthatch sexes are reported to share equally in nest building and incubation duties . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 This species lives in the eastern Himalayas , and has been reported in several scattered sites across Southeast Asia , in the northwest of Vietnam and in central Laos . Its range stretches west into the northeast of India , where it was reported seen near Darjeeling in West Bengal , but not since 1933 . It is present in Bhutan , and in the Indian states of Sikkim ( in the town of <unk> ) , in Meghalaya ( in the Khasi Hills ) , in Assam ( in the Dima <unk> district ) , in the south of Arunachal Pradesh , and in Manipur and Nagaland . Its presence in Bangladesh is uncertain but it is found further west in the north of Burma , in Chin State ( in the Chin Hills @-@ Arakan Yoma montane forests ) , the Sagaing Region , in Kachin State and in Shan State . Data on the bird from Laos is erratic , but there are reports of sightings north of Phou Kobo , and of large numbers of the species wintering in the center of the country in the pristine wilderness of Nakai – Nam <unk> . There are also reports of sightings in the southeast of China ’ s Yunnan province , in northern Thailand and in northwestern Vietnam . Its residential and breeding range is estimated to cover 376 @,@ 000 km2 ( 145 @,@ 000 sq mi ) . 
 Beautiful nuthatches typically inhabit both the interior and outskirts of evergreen or semi @-@ evergreen mountain forests , though in northern Burma they have been recorded nesting in trees scattered across open areas . In central Laos , the bird was found associated with the Fokienia evergreen . They usually live at altitudes of 950 m ( 3 @,@ 120 ft ) and up to nearly 2 @,@ 300 m ( 7 @,@ 500 ft ) during the warm seasons but may make seasonal vertical migration . In India , for example , the species spends the summer between 1 @,@ 500 m ( 4 @,@ 900 ft ) and 2 @,@ 100 m ( 6 @,@ 900 ft ) , but was observed during winter at just 335 m ( 1 @,@ 099 ft ) in Sikkim and in northeastern Arunachal Pradesh at 460 m ( 1 @,@ 510 ft ) and between 600 m ( 2 @,@ 000 ft ) and 800 m ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) . In Burma , they were observed at between 975 m ( 3 @,@ 199 ft ) and 1 @,@ 830 m ( 6 @,@ 000 ft ) , in China between 350 m ( 1 @,@ 150 ft ) and 1 @,@ 975 m ( 6 @,@ 480 ft ) , in Laos between 1 @,@ 950 m ( 6 @,@ 400 ft ) and 2 @,@ 000 m ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) and in Thailand , the only observation of the species was at a height of 2 @,@ 290 m ( 7 @,@ 510 ft ) . 
 = = Threats and protection = = 
 The beautiful nuthatch has always been rare and very localized throughout its distribution , perhaps due to very specific ecological requirements , though this has been questioned as not in keeping with the diversity of habitats in which S. Formosa has been observed . Although the species is less threatened at high elevations , its habitat has been reduced by deforestation , due to logging and forest clearance to make way for human habitation . In the center of Laos and northern Vietnam , Fokienia trees , which are a known beautiful nuthatch foraging source and nesting site , are harvested for their high commercial value . Research conducted in 2001 indicated a population comprising 2 @,@ 500 to 10 @,@ 000 adults , and between 3 @,@ 500 and 15 @,@ 000 total individuals ; these numbers are in decline . The species has been classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) . 
 = St Mary 's Church , Astbury = 
 St Mary 's Church is an Anglican parish church in the village of Newbold Astbury , Cheshire , England . It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building , and its architecture has been praised by a number of writers . 
 It is possible that a church was present on the site in the Saxon era , although the earliest fabric in the church is Norman . The present ground plan was established in the 13th and 14th centuries , from which time the church 's external appearance dates , apart from a major rebuilding in the later part of the 15th century , when the range of high windows or clerestory was added . All styles of English Gothic architecture , are represented in the church : Early English , Decorated , and Perpendicular . During the civil war , a group of Roundheads stabled their horses in the church . In the 19th century the interior of the church was restored by George Gilbert Scott ; some wall paintings were revealed , and stained glass was added . 
 The church has a number of special features . These include its exceptionally wide nave for a village church , and its trapezoidal shape . The tower is separate from the body of the church , joined to it by a passage with a porch . There are two other porches : the three @-@ storey west porch and the two @-@ storey south porch . Inside the church are medieval fittings and furniture and many memorials . The churchyard contains numerous gravestones from the 17th century and five listed structures , including a canopied tomb . St Mary 's continues to be an active church in the centre of its village . It provides the usual services of an Anglican church and runs a number of organisations catering for children and adults . 
 = = History = = 
 The origins of the church are unclear . The Domesday survey of 1086 records the presence of a priest at Astbury , but not a church . The discovery nearby of fragments of stone with apparent Saxon decoration , coffin lids , and the lower stages of a cross – all of which might date from before the Norman conquest – suggest that an earlier church may have been on the site . The earliest fabric in the present church is a round @-@ arched doorway . Architectural historian Andor Gomme dates this from about the middle of the 12th century and states that at that time the church would have been a simple rectangular building , and mainly timber @-@ framed . Gomme suggests further that in the middle of the 13th century the east end of the church would have been rebuilt in stone , with a chancel and sanctuary . Subsequently the rest of the body of the church was built , consisting of the nave and north and south aisles ; the work was completed in the 14th century . The tower was built towards the end of the 13th century , not in the usual position at the west end of the church but to the north of the west bay of the north aisle , separated from it by a distance of 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) . During the 14th century the south porch , with its priest 's room or treasury in the top storey , was added . It is not known whether the tower 's spire was built in the 14th or the 15th century . 
 Major rebuilding work took place in the later part of the 15th century . It is thought that it began with the south arcade , followed by the north arcade and the addition of a clerestory . The rebuilding was probably complete by about 1525 , although the north aisle may not have been completely re @-@ roofed until the early 17th century . The west porch was probably started in the 14th century , and the upper two storeys added in the following century . The nave roof was repaired in 1615 . During the civil war , while nearby Biddulph Hall was under siege , Sir William Brereton 's Roundheads stabled their horses in the church . They damaged the medieval glass windows and removed some of the church furniture , including the organ . There have been few significant changes since that time . The church was restored during the 19th century by Anthony Salvin , and later , in about 1857 , by George Gilbert Scott , who removed plaster from the walls and built a small gallery . During the Victorian era , the reredos and most of the stained glass were added . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 = = = Exterior = = = 
 The body of the church is constructed in yellow sandstone ashlar , and the tower in millstone grit , an unusual material for churches in Cheshire . The architectural historian Alec Clifton @-@ Taylor draws attention to the crispness of the details of the stonework in the tower 500 years after it was carved , compared to the sandstone , which is prone to weathering . The roof is metal . The church incorporates elements of Norman , Early English , Decorated , and Perpendicular architecture . The overall plan is that of a trapezium ; the west end is 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) wider than the east . The body of the church consists of a seven @-@ bay nave and chancel with no structural division , and north and south aisles . The aisles are rectangular , thus the narrowing takes place entirely within the nave and chancel . The west end of the nave , between the piers ( columns ) of the arcades , is 40 feet ( 12 @.@ 2 m ) wide . This is exceptionally wide for a parish church , and slightly wider than the nave of Chester Cathedral . The aisles extend along the sides of the chancel , forming north and south chapels . The tower stands to the north of the west bay of the body of the church , and is joined to it by a short passage with a porch on its east side . There are also porches on the west and south sides of the church . 
 The tower is in three stages and is supported by buttresses . In the lowest stage , on the west side , is a doorway in Romanesque style , on the north side is an ogee @-@ headed lancet window . On the left of the east side is a Perpendicular @-@ style porch . The middle stage has a two @-@ light window on the west side , above which is a circular clock face , and on the north and east sides are lancet windows . The top stage contains a two @-@ light louvred bell opening on each side . The parapet is plain , and projecting from it on the west side is a gargoyle . The spire is octagonal , with two tiers of <unk> ( dormer windows ) . The north side of the church is divided by buttresses into four bays . The second bay from the east contains a priest 's door , above which is a lancet window . To the right of the door is a small trefoil @-@ headed window . The other bays contain two @-@ light windows with Early English tracery . <unk> parapets run around the walls of the aisle walls and the clerestory . The clerestory has seven bays on either side , each containing a four @-@ light Perpendicular window . At the east end are three windows . The central window , at the end of the chancel , is Perpendicular with seven lights . This is flanked by two aisle windows with plate tracery , the one to the right having four lights , and that to the left five lights . 
 The southern side of the church has nine bays , again divided by buttresses . In the third bay from the west is a porch . The other bays each contain a two @-@ light window with trefoil heads . The porch is in two storeys , with angle buttresses and a battlemented parapet with gargoyles .

 = Laurence Harbor ( NJT station ) = 
 Laurence Harbor was a proposed station that was to be located along New Jersey Transit 's North Jersey Coast Line between the South Amboy and Aberdeen @-@ Matawan stations . The station was to be in the Laurence Harbor section of Old Bridge , New Jersey . 
 The station was first proposed in the 1980s , although no progress was made until August 2001 , when the transportation officials said the official station could be constructed within several years . After several years of proposals , along with the passing of a high <unk> in 2003 , the station came up once again in 2008 . That year , the proposed Metropark South was brought back to the Old Bridge council by developer Michael Alfieri . His proposal also brought up the plans for new residential homes , commercial businesses along with the new station . The proposal was conditionally accepted in November of that year . As of 2009 , there is no forward on the actual station being constructed .

 The idea for a station in Laurence Harbor was first proposed by developer in Michael Alfieri in 1985 . His original proposal in the community was to create and constructed a so @-@ called " Metropark South " , to consist of residential homes , commercial businesses , and a brand @-@ new train station . The proposal received approval , but only the residential portion of the proposal was ever built . This residential area , consisting of high @-@ class townhouses , is known as " <unk> " . In August 2001 , several years after the partially constructed project was started , the staff at New Jersey Transit proposed the design and construction of a station at Laurence Harbor near Exit 120 on the Garden State Parkway , which would serve the North Jersey Coast Line . At that time , the tracks passed through Laurence Harbor between the South Amboy and Aberdeen @-@ Matawan stations . A spokesperson from New Jersey Transit reported that the state is working with Old Bridge Township ( where Laurence Harbor is a part ) to make preliminary designs . The costs for the designs began around $ 300 @,@ 000 ( 2001 USD ) for a two @-@ year study . The station was proposed to relieve major congestion on four of the major state highways in the community including Route 18 , Route 34 , Route 35 , and U.S. Route 9 . Old Bridge 's mayor , Barbara Cannon , gave full support for the new station , who previously passed a unanimous resolution for the proposal . The township also reported that this would help qualify Old Bridge as a city and receive more state funding . 
 A week later , the figures for a brand @-@ new station at Laurence Harbor were released , saying the station would take five years to construct , with costs ranging from $ 25 million – $ 30 million ( 2001 USD ) of funding from the state of New Jersey and the federal government . The station would also relieve the busy Aberdeen @-@ Matawan station , which at the time hosted about 3 @,@ 500 commuters daily . Most of the city council and mayor supported the deal , except for councilman Joseph Hoff . Hoff believed the train station was a good idea , but there were a number of outstanding issues before plans for one could go forward . Hoff stated that the additional truck traffic and the safety of the pedestrians in the area were also a concern . These concerns would also get worse when the Atrium II office complex would be completed on the western side of Exit 120 . Another major issue was the traffic congestion at Exit 120 itself , which at rush hour was " atrocious " . By November 2002 , the station had not received any studies on the general location were not conducted by New Jersey Transit . Although the proposal still had support by the community , several citizens , including Joseph Hoff , were still questioning it . Hoff cited that New Jersey Transit has not put any interest forward and would just end up becoming another parking lot rather than a tax revenue . He reported however , that if residential homes and commercial businesses were constructed , it would be beneficial to Laurence Harbor . The other issue that Hoff maintained , was that it would risk the lives of children heading to and from Laurence Harbor Memorial School by affecting the traffic in the area .

 After the 2002 report by Joseph Hoff , the township councilman in opposition to the Laurence Harbor train station , the 74 @-@ year @-@ old politician himself died on November 20 , 2003 . The proposal for the new train station began to wane for sometime , until 2005 , when Aliferi , the designer and constructor of " <unk> " returned to the township board . This time Aliferi proposed the continuation of construction for the two decade @-@ old project , with several community groups either opposing the plan , or raising concerns . The proposal was to include a seven @-@ story hotel , 83 single @-@ family homes , two parking garages and 15 @,@ 000 square feet ( 1 @,@ 400 m2 ) of retail space . The local highway , Laurence Parkway , would also receive improvements to better handle the new development . Concerns were also raised by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority , the agency that governs the Garden State Parkway , about the effects on the off @-@ ramp for Exit 120 . On February 8 , 2006 , the Old Bridge Township Council turned over on a 7 @-@ 0 vote for the new development . Aliferi sued the township , taking the case to the New Jersey Superior Court . A judge sided with Aliferi , citing that the developer can bring the proposal back to the council . On February 21 , 2007 , the proposal was rejected again , partially citing that Aliferi has no interest in building the hotel or the offices . 
 On November 17 , 2008 , Aliferi returned yet again to the Old Bridge Township Council . The council this time gave the go @-@ ahead for construction to begin with a condition . The council set that if Aliferi wants to construct it , he has to include commercial development before constructing residential homes to minimize community impact . Also before construction would begin , Aliferi would also have to return for a new General Development Permit ( GDP ) . The proposal for the hotel that Aliferi brought up , was held off due to the location , which was on depressed elevation . There was no official decision for a new train station , which was proposed several times during Aliferi 's plans . 
 = Final Fantasy Tactics = 
 Final Fantasy Tactics ( <unk> , Fainaru Fantajī Takutikusu ) is a tactical role @-@ playing game developed and published by Square ( now Square Enix ) for the Sony PlayStation video game console . It is the first game of the Final Fantasy Tactics series and was released in Japan in June 1997 and in the United States in January 1998 . The game combines thematic elements of the Final Fantasy video game series with a game engine and battle system unlike those previously seen in the franchise . In contrast to other 32 @-@ bit era Final Fantasy titles , Final Fantasy Tactics uses a 3D , isometric , rotatable playing field , with bitmap sprite characters . 
 Final Fantasy Tactics is set in a fictional medieval @-@ inspired kingdom called Ivalice created by Yasumi Matsuno . The game 's story follows Ramza Beoulve , a highborn cadet who finds himself thrust into the middle of an intricate military conflict known as The Lion War , where two opposing noble factions are coveting the throne of the kingdom . As the story progresses , Ramza and his allies discover a sinister plot behind the war . 
 A spinoff title , Final Fantasy Tactics Advance , was released for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance in 2003 and a sequel to that title , Final Fantasy Tactics A2 : Grimoire of the Rift , was released in 2007 for the Nintendo DS . Various other games have also utilized the Ivalice setting , including Vagrant Story for the PlayStation and Final Fantasy XII for the PlayStation 2 . An enhanced port of Final Fantasy Tactics , Final Fantasy Tactics : The War of the Lions , was released in 2007 as part of Square Enix 's Ivalice Alliance project . Overall , the game received positive reviews from gaming magazines and websites and has become a cult classic since its release . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The gameplay of Final Fantasy Tactics differs in several key areas from other titles in the Final Fantasy series . Instead of a generic battle screen , with the player 's characters on one side and the enemies on the other , encounters take place on three @-@ dimensional , isometric fields . Characters move on a battlefield composed of square tiles ; movement and action ranges are determined by the character 's statistics and job class . Battles are turn @-@ based ; a unit may act when its CT ( Charge Time ) reaches 100 . Charge time is increased once every CT unit ( a measure of time in battles ) by an amount equal to the unit 's speed statistic . When CT reaches 100 or greater , the unit may act . During battle , whenever a unit performs an action successfully , it gains Experience Points ( EXP ) and Job Points ( JP ) . 
 Another difference is the manner in which random battles are encountered . Like other Final Fantasy games , random battles occur on the world map . However , in Final Fantasy Tactics , random battles only occur in pre @-@ set locations , marked in green on the world map . Passing over one of these spots may result in a random encounter . Another major aspect of battles is magical attacks . Certain magical attacks cause area of effect damage , and many of the more powerful magical attacks require several turns of charging . Hit Points of enemy units are also visible to the player ( except in the case of certain bosses ) , allowing the player to know exactly how much damage they still have to inflict on a particular unit . 
 Movement on the world map is limited to predefined paths connecting the towns and battle points . When the character icon is over a town , a menu can be opened with several options : " Bar " for taking sidequest job offers , " Shop " for buying supplies and equipment , and " Soldier Office " for recruiting new characters . Later in the game , some towns contain " Fur Shops " for obtaining items by way of poaching monsters . 
 Like several installments in the series , Final Fantasy Tactics features a character class system , which allows players to customize characters into various roles . The game makes extensive use of most of the original character classes seen in earlier Final Fantasy games , including Summoners , Wizards ( Black Mages ) , Priests ( White Mages ) , Monks , Lancers ( Dragoons ) , and Thieves . New recruits start out as either a Squire or a Chemist , the base classes for warrior and magician jobs , respectively . The game features twenty jobs accessible by normal characters . 
 Throughout the game , unique characters also join the party . As well , some characters join as " guests " , which are computer controlled characters that fight on your side . Many of the unique characters have custom classes that replace the base squire class . It 's also possible to recruit monsters into the party . Monsters have unique abilities , but cannot change jobs . Monsters can be captured from battles or bred from existing monsters . 
 In battle , JP are rewarded for every successful action . JP are used to learn new abilities within each job class . Accumulating enough JP results in a job level up ; new jobs are unlocked by attaining a certain level in the current job class ( for instance , to become a Priest or Wizard , the unit must first attain Job Level 2 as a Chemist ) , which also allows the character to gain more JP in that class in battles . Once all the abilities of a job class have been learned , the class is " Mastered " . A soldier in a specific Job always has its innate skill equipped ( Wizards always have " Black Magic , " Knights always have " Battle Skill " ) but a second job @-@ skill slot and several other ability slots ( Reaction , Support , and Movement ) can be filled with any skill the particular soldier has learned .

 The story takes place in the kingdom of Ivalice , located in a peninsula surrounded by sea on the north , west and south , with a headland south of the landmass . Its geography features ranging landscapes , from plains to mountains ranges to deserts and forests . It is heavily populated by human beings , although intelligent monsters can be found living in less populated areas . Magic is predominant in the land , although ruins and artifacts indicated that past populace had relied on machinery , such as airships and robots . 
 Ivalice is a kingdom of seven territories ; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Lionel , <unk> , the Holy Territory of Murond ( Mullonde in later versions ) , and the Royal Capital of <unk> ( Lesalia in later versions ) , Ivalice 's neighbors are the kingdom of Ordalia in the east and <unk> , a military nation to the north , across the <unk> Strait . While the three nations share common royal bloodlines , major wars have taken place between them . An influential religious institution known as the Murond Glabados Church heads the dominant faith , centering around a religious figure known as Saint Ajora . 
 The story takes place after Ivalice ended its war with the two nations in what is known as the Fifty Years War , and is facing economic problems and political strife . Adding to its problems is the recent death of the king , whose heir is only an infant . A regent is needed to rule in place of the prince , and the kingdom is split between Prince Goltana , represented by the Black Lion , and Prince Larg , symbolized by the White Lion . The conflict leads to what is known in the game as the Lion War . Behind this backdrop is a revelation by the game 's historian <unk> J. Durai , who seeks to reveal the story of an unknown character whose role in the Lion War was major but was covered up by the kingdom 's church . The setting is based around this character , named by default as Ramza , and revolves around his early life and the future conflicts he faced while the events that changed the kingdom unfold . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 Central to the plot of the game are two main characters , Ramza Beoulve and Delita Heiral . The two characters are childhood friends , and while both are born of differing social classes ; Ramza a noble and Delita a commoner , both disregarded this fact and grew up together believing in justice and honor , as taught by Ramza 's father <unk> . However , as the story progresses , the two characters faced many conflicts that changed their viewpoint on life ; Delita seeks to manipulate the upper class to achieve his dreams , while Ramza believes in justice and honor regardless of name and class . 
 The game 's plot is then portrayed through the eyes of Ramza Beoulve , who is the player character of the story . His exploits in the war introduced him to a number of characters ; each with their own roles and agenda concerning the war and the fictional world , Ivalice , that they inhabit . The most prominent factions at the beginning of the story are those of Prince Goltana and Prince Larg , both are nobles seeking to obtain control of the throne by being the guardian to the monarch 's young heir and were thus engaged in a war . The story progresses to include characters from the Murond Glabados Church , which have been controlling Ivalice silently and engineering the war in question . 
 As the game progresses , players are able to recruit generic player characters and customize them using the Job system of the Final Fantasy series . Several battles also feature " Guest " characters that are controlled via the game 's A.I. , which may be recruited later in the game according to the story proper . Aside from original characters , the developers have also incorporated cameo roles from other Square games . The characters were designed by Akihiko Yoshida , who was also in charge of the illustration and character designs of games such as Tactics Ogre , Final Fantasy Tactics Advance , Final Fantasy XII , and Vagrant Story . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 Final Fantasy Tactics begins with Ivalice just recovering from the Fifty Year War against Ordalia . The power vacuum caused by the death of its ruler , King <unk> , soon sparks another conflict . Princess Ovelia and the younger Prince <unk> are both candidates to the throne , with the former supported by Prince Goltana of the Black Lion , and the latter by Queen <unk> and her brother , Prince Larg of the White Lion . This erupts into a full @-@ scale war known as the " Lion War " , with either side using whatever means possible to secure their place in the throne . This includes bearing an illegitimate child , killing other possible heirs , betrayal , assassination and false identities . 
 Throughout the game , nobles regard commoners and peasants as animals , and many commoners try to take revenge on the nobles , who abandoned them after the war . Most joined the so @-@ called Death Corps to fight against the nobles ' soldiers , and many die in vain . Ramza , part of the noble Beoulve family of knights , and Delita , his childhood friend who was an ordinary commoner , are witnesses to this phenomenon . Events such as meeting an arrogant noble named <unk> , as well as the negligent killing of Delita 's sister Teta during an uprising , cause Delita and Ramza to abandon their ties to the nobility , both going separate ways . 
 Ramza joins a mercenary group , led by <unk> , who protects Princess Ovelia from being hunted by both sides . Delita joins Prince Goltana 's forces to rise up through the ranks and gain control over his own destiny . Ramza and Delita are reunited when <unk> attempts to take Ovelia to Prince Larg , though this proves futile . Agrias suggests visiting Cardinal Draclau of the Glabados Church to protect Ovelia , while Delita continues to work in the shadows , working with multiple sides to realize his ambitions . Along the way to Lionel Castle , Ramza meets Mustadio , a machinist in possession of a holy relic called the Zodiac Stone . Hunted by a trading company for the power it contains , Mustadio also seeks Draclau 's intervention . 
 However , soon after the encounter with Cardinal Draclau , Ramza discovers that an elaborate plot was set by the Murond Glabados Church . In their desire to control Ivalice , the Church , particularly the High Priest , Marge Funeral , uses the legend of the so @-@ called holy Zodiac Braves to gather the Zodiac Stones , and fuels the Lion War between Larg and Goltana . To stave off Ramza 's interference , Draclau uses the stone to transform into a legendary Lucavi demon , and Ramza has no choice but to slay him / it . As a result , Ramza is regarded a heretic of the Church , and he is approached by the Heretic Examiner <unk> at Lesalia Imperial Capital . 
 While noble in name , the Beoulve family is susceptible to corruption , due to ambition . Dycedarg , the eldest sibling , conspires with Larg and the Church to ensure that the Beoulve family remains in power . However , his younger brother Zalbag is unaware of his dealings . Alma , Ramza 's younger sister , remains in church , unaffected by the situation until Ramza is branded a heretic in front of her . Ramza seeks to rescue her after her capture while helping Ramza escape the Heresy Examiners . Only Ramza and Alma share their father 's sense of justice . 
 Ramza is chased throughout the story by the Shrine Knights , the soldiers of the Church who are hunting the Zodiac Stones , although he gains allies , either by saving their lives , or by showing them the truth . Some individuals with knowledge of the Zodiac Stones attempt to conspire with the Shrine Knights for its power , though most fail . Ramza also acquires proof of the Church 's lies about Saint Ajora , a central figure in the religion , and attempts to use it along with the Zodiac Stone to reveal the organization 's plot . 
 During the course of the story , the two sides face off in a major battle that sees the deaths of many soldiers , including their leaders Larg and Goltana . Ramza manages to stop the bloodshed from continuing and rescues the general <unk> Orlandu , though the Church succeeds in eliminating the two Lions to secure its power over Ivalice . Deeper into the story , Ramza discovers that the Shrine Knights are in reality Lucavi , and the real conspirators behind the Church 's plot . The Lucavi are seeking to resurrect their leader Altima , who in the past was Saint Ajora , and they need much bloodshed and a suitable body to complete the resurrection . Alma is to serve as the host for Altima 's incarnation . While racing off to find her , Ramza encounters Dycedarg - now a Lucavi demon - and witnesses Zalbag 's death . Zalbag is then risen and converted into an undead servant , and frequently begs for death during the encounter . 
 At the end of the story , though Altima is resurrected , Ramza and his allies succeed in destroying her . Their final fates are unknown , although Olan does witness Ramza and Alma riding away from the kingdom on Chocobos at the end of the game . In the epilogue , Delita marries Ovelia and becomes the King of Ivalice . However , he fails to find true satisfaction as even Ovelia distrusts him , leading her to stab Delita . Ovelia in turn is stabbed by the agonizing Delita and dies . Delita then sorrowfully cries out to Ramza , asking if what they have done was worth what they received ( vilification for Ramza , and ostracization for Delita ) . Olan Durai , a witness who had many encounters with Ramza , attempts to reveal the Church 's evil plot with the " Durai Report . " However , his papers are confiscated and he is burned at the stake for heresy . The story ends many years later with the historian <unk> J. Durai intent on revealing the truth of the Lion War and the Durai Report . 
 = = Development = = 
 Final Fantasy Tactics was produced mostly by the team that made Ogre Battle and Tactics Ogre , and was Yasumi Matsuno 's first project with Square following his departure from Quest in 1995 . In an interview with Akito Inoue , an assistant professor at the International University of Japan , Inoue mentions that Final Fantasy Tactics was made because of how casual gamers are usually put off by games with branching storylines found in other Matsuno 's titles such as Tactics Ogre . 
 Several historical and mythological references were altered by translators : for instance , the Norse World Tree , Yggdrasil , makes an appearance as <unk> ; the word " breath " is consistently rendered as " bracelet " in attack names ; and Wiegraf 's name is nearly homonymous with a character from Beowulf but rendered differently . The in @-@ game tutorial function also shows examples of Engrish - poorly translated English - including lines such as " This was the darkened Items won 't appear . " 
 The game also includes references to several Final Fantasy specific characters , places , and situations from earlier games in the Final Fantasy series — Final Fantasy VII 's Cloud Strife is a playable character , and through the " Proposition " system in bars scattered around the world map , treasures and lost areas such as " Matoya Cave " ( a reference to the first Final Fantasy ) and various colors of materia can be found . To keep with tradition , Olan 's adoptive father , <unk> Orlandu , is nicknamed " T.G. Cid " , and chocobos are present in the game as well . Additionally , most of the monsters appear in one Final Fantasy game or another , although the Lucavi are entirely new monsters altogether . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The original score for Final Fantasy Tactic was composed , arranged , and produced by Hitoshi Sakimoto and Masaharu Iwata . Matsuno approached his longtime friends Sakimoto and Iwata to compose the music soon after the initial release of Final Fantasy VII in January 1997 . Sakimoto composed 47 tracks for the game , and Iwata was left to compose the other 24 . The orchestral timbres of the game 's music were synthesized , with performance by Katsutoshi Kashiwabara and sound programming by Hidenori Suzuki . The album was first released on two Compact Discs by now @-@ defunct DigiCube on June 21 , 1997 , bearing the catalog number SSCX @-@ 10008 , and was re @-@ released by Square Enix on March 24 , 2006 , with the catalog number SQEX @-@ <unk> / 7 . It spans two discs and 71 tracks , covering a duration of 2 : 31 : 03 . 
 Some reviewers made comparison with Nobuo Uematsu 's Final Fantasy compositions , though the soundtrack received positive reviews from critics . Chudah 's Corner summarized its review by stating that the soundtrack is an " astoundingly memorable classic of videogame music " . This is also supported by other professional reviews , such as by an RPGFan reviewer that " don 't believe that any other soundtrack known to man surpasses it " , and a <unk> World review who quotes that " the orchestral music is beautiful nonetheless " .

 Final Fantasy Tactics received universal acclaim upon its release , and critical opinion of the game has improved further over time . Magazines such as Electronic Gaming Monthly acknowledged it as " Square 's first attempt into the strategy RPG genre " ; though being " uneven " , it is worthy of being called " a classic " . Game Informer called it " the most impressive strategy RPG yet . " Gaming websites such as GameSpot lauded the game 's battle sequences as challenging , requiring more strategic planning than ordinary RPGs . IGN noted that the plot was the strength of the game , being in @-@ depth and with numerous plot twists . During battle sequences , the story unfolds to create a serious atmosphere of the plot , even with simple and " cute " character design . The spells and summoning visuals were compared with Final Fantasy VII ' s detailed graphics . 
 Criticism is made on gameplay , plot and the localization effort . One of the reviews of RPGFan criticized the difficulty of the game as being inconsistent with each encounter against enemy units . The factors that influence the difficulty of the game include overpowered enemy units or party members , and time had to be taken to level up before any progress can be made . Though in @-@ depth , IGN also noted that the game 's plot was confusing at times , and that the item system was repetitive . The game 's localization effort was criticized by reviewers as poorly written , being rife with grammatical mistakes that almost stopped players from enjoying the storyline . General RPGFan review noted that the battlefield area was too small , hindering any possibilities for better strategy . The gameplay is summarized by one of the reviews as " strength vs. strength and proper spacing of troops when fighting magic users " . 
 IGN awarded the game the Editor 's Choice Award on 1998 , praising the in @-@ game graphics as " amazing " and the battle environments with its extra details as being " extremely well designed " . GameSpot has named Final Fantasy Tactics as one of its Greatest Games of All Time — the first Final Fantasy game to receive such an honour . However , its legacy remains fairly obscure compared to Final Fantasy VII , also released for the PlayStation that year . The game still entered many " best games of all time " lists , receiving 84th place in the " Top 100 Favorite Games of All Time " poll by Japanese magazine Famitsu during March 2006 , 19th in a 2005 list by GameFAQs users , 45th in Game Informer 's list , 43rd in Electronic Gaming Monthly 's , and 38th in IGN 's . Since its release , Final Fantasy Tactics has attracted a cult following . Fan communities dedicated to modding and balancing the game have appeared on the internet . These communities experience member activity as of 2011 , fourteen years after Final Fantasy Tactics ' original release . 
 Editorials from the gaming website RPGamer outlined several similarities between the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Glabados portrayed in Final Fantasy Tactics . One editorial noted that it was a controversial move by the developers , as the church institution " in fact worships a demon , and is evil from its god on down " . However , another editorial mentions that such controversies failed to point out that any powerful organized religion in a <unk> @-@ medieval fictional setting , good or ill , is going to be compared with Catholicism due to its importance in European history .

 = Final Fantasy X / X @-@ 2 HD Remaster = 
 Final Fantasy X / X @-@ 2 HD Remaster ( ファイナルファンタジーX / X @-@ 2 HD <unk> , Fainaru Fantajī Ten / Ten Tsū HD <unk> ) , also stylized as Final Fantasy X | X @-@ 2 HD Remaster , is a high @-@ definition remaster of the role @-@ playing video games Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 , originally developed and published by Square ( now Square Enix ) on the PlayStation 2 in 2001 and 2003 respectively . It also features story content previously only found in the International versions , and a new audio drama set a year after the events of X @-@ 2 . The Chinese studio Virtuos handled large parts of its development , while Square Enix assisted the process and published the collection . It was released for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in Japan in December 2013 and in North America and Europe in March 2014 , and worldwide for PlayStation 4 in May 2015 , as well as for Windows PC in May 2016 . 
 The collection saw graphical and musical revisions and is based on the international versions of both games , making certain special features missing in the original releases accessible to North American players for the first time . The collection sold favorably in Japan and the west , and has received positive reviews in western territories . Many praised the graphical upgrade and the chance to play through the games on the new platforms . The collection did receive criticism for a few minor upgrade faults and uneven quality between the two , while some of the collection 's added content drew mixed opinions . 
 = = Content = = 
 The HD remaster covers both Final Fantasy X and its sequel Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 . The first game follows the journey of the teenager Tidus who is transported to the world of Spira after an encounter with a creature known as Sin . He becomes one of the guardians of the summoner Yuna , protecting her on a pilgrimage to defeat Sin and finding out how the creature is linked to Tidus ' and Yuna 's late fathers . Gameplay relies on the Conditional Turn @-@ Based Battle system that allows for swapping party members in mid @-@ combat . Characters are leveled up by means of the Sphere Grid on which the player may choose a specific skill to learn or attribute to improve . The second game is set two years after the events of X and features Yuna as a treasure hunter in search of spheres leading her to Tidus . It reintroduces the series ' classic job system in the form of the Garment Grid : jobs can be acquired as dresspheres , costumes that give the player characters different abilities , throughout the game and may be changed in battle . X @-@ 2 includes multiple minigames such as Sphere Break and blitzball , the latter of which also featured prominently in X. 
 While the majority of the gameplay for X and X @-@ 2 remains unchanged , the games have undergone an extensive graphical update and a large amount of the music for X has been rearranged . All regional releases contain content from the International versions : X has the expert Sphere Grid and several optional bosses , while X @-@ 2 comes with extra dresspheres and new minigames . The Creature Creator system was added , whereby players can capture enemy monsters and certain non @-@ player characters ( NPCs ) to train them and to have them fight alongside the party in battle , similar to the Pokémon series : these captured allies can also be fought and strengthened in a coliseum . Lastly , X @-@ 2 includes the " Last Mission " extra dungeon that plays in the style of a roguelike 3D game , having a grid @-@ based layout across which the characters move and take on enemies . <unk> are generated randomly and each opponent is allowed as many turns as the player has taken . As in the main game , the player characters can equip jobs in the form of dresspheres . Dialogue between the protagonists changes depending on which ending the player achieved in X @-@ 2 . The Eternal Calm movie that bridges the gap between X and X @-@ 2 is included in the collection as well . The collection allows for cross @-@ platform saving between the PlayStation 3 ( PS3 ) and PlayStation Vita versions and both games have full trophy support . 
 Final Fantasy X : Will is an original audio drama included in the release , playing during the ending credits . It features multiple characters from the games , alongside two new characters : the narrator <unk> and her companion <unk> . In the story , the two are sent to summon Yuna to investigate a mysterious phenomenon known as " <unk> " , where the dead are being called back into existence . On their journey , they encounter a reborn Sin , who has apparently been beckoned . Over the course of the story , it is revealed that Tidus is suffering from some kind of weakness , and that Yuna and he appear to have broken up and Yuna is seeing someone else . The drama ends with Yuna preparing to face Sin again and Tidus , despite his weakness , deciding to follow her . 
 = = Development = = 
 The idea for a remaster originated from a reunion of the games ' original development team and voice cast during the making of Final Fantasy Type @-@ 0 . Character designer Tetsuya Nomura , associate producer Hideki Imaizumi and a voice actor thought that they should create something to celebrate the tenth anniversary of X. Producer Yoshinori Kitase 's personal motivation was to have people too young to have played the games experience them , as his son was only old enough to know the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel . Another reason was that many did not have an opportunity to play the games since they were not compatible with the majority of PlayStation 3 models and neither available on the PlayStation Network unlike games from the original PlayStation like Final Fantasy VII and IX . Nomura entered negotiations with other old members of staff and got a remaster of X and X @-@ 2 approved , but the actual development process was delayed because much of the team was still busy with the creation of Final Fantasy XIII . The remaster was first announced at Tokyo Game Show 2011 , where it was assumed that the game would release to commemorate X 's tenth anniversary . 
 The bulk of the remastering work was outsourced to the Shanghai @-@ based studio Virtuos . Square Enix 's internal staff was responsible for reassembling the original assets , and helped with a part of redoing the high @-@ definition data . Among the returning original team members were Motomu Toriyama , Yusuke Naora , Toshitaka Matsuda and Masaki Kobayashi who supervised the production . X @-@ 2 art director Shintaro Takai remained in the same role for both remastered games . The Chinese side of development was headed by managing director Pan Feng . The team encountered problems in porting the games to PlayStation 3 and Vita as their graphics used many functionalities unique to the PlayStation 2 hardware . The loss and repair of some of the original assets posed another hurdle , with Kitase commenting that it might have been easier to recreate the data from the ground up . 
 The PlayStation 3 version supports display resolutions of 720p and 1080p – the former with and the latter without anti @-@ aliasing – while the Vita version runs at <unk> pixels . Graphical features such as the water effects and lighting were improved . Other changes include the addition of bloom , the move from circular to dynamic shadows and tweaks to environmental geometry and texturing . The developers revised the 3D models for both games : most models merely received new textures but those of the playable characters were rebuilt completely with noticeable changes to their faces . The cutscenes and prerendered environments needed to be adjusted from a 4 : 3 to a 16 : 9 screen ratio , the process of which required lots of art and programming readjustments . For example , the widescreen display led to character models being visible in a cutscene although they were to appear only in a later shot ; these instances had to be corrected . Both the prerendered background images and cutscenes were cropped at the top and bottom to fit the new screen ratio . However , they received a bump in resolution to appear much clearer than in the PlayStation 2 version . The gameplay also needed to be duplicated while bringing it up to the standard of a high definition game , which was harder than the team thought . 
 Sixty tracks of the original Final Fantasy X soundtrack by Nobuo Uematsu , Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano were rearranged . Hamauzu and Nakano took charge of most of the revised music , with Tsutomu Narita and Ryo Yamazaki also making select arrangements . The soundtrack for Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 by Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi was carried over from the original PlayStation 2 version . For the credits of the HD remaster , scenario writer Kazushige Nojima wrote the audio drama Final Fantasy X : Will as an appendix taking place two years after X @-@ 2 . Nojima and Nomura felt that it was a good opportunity to expand upon the universe of X. They opted for the audio drama format as the team did not want to create a solid visual impression , instead intending to leave it up to interpretation . The team wanted the audio drama to be the " direct opposite " to the upbeat feel and happy ending of X @-@ 2 . This wish for a more melancholy atmosphere resulted in them bringing Sin , the main antagonistic force in X , back into the story , as the team wanted to keep it involved in a similar fashion to Sephiroth , the main antagonist of Final Fantasy VII and its companion media . The drama 's open ending was also intentional , as Kitase " wanted to leave something up to the player 's imagination . "

 Final Fantasy X / X @-@ 2 HD Remaster was released as a collection for the PlayStation 3 and as separate releases of each game for the PlayStation Vita . Alongside the standard PlayStation Vita releases in Japan , there was a Twin Pack that bundled both games and a Resolution Box collection which additionally contained the handheld console . A dual release was decided against for the Vita versions due to the limited storage capacity of the cartridges . Play Arts Kai figurines of Tidus and Yuna were produced and the original soundtracks were re @-@ released . Two new Ultimania guide books were published for each game . Nojima wrote the tie @-@ in novel Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 @.@ 5 : Eien no Daishō that bridges the gap between Last Mission and Final Fantasy X : Will . A Collector 's Edition of the PlayStation 3 version was exclusively released in North America via Square Enix 's online store . It contained both games , an artwork book , a Blu @-@ ray disc for the rearranged soundtrack and five artwork lithographs . A special launch event is being held at Gallery Nucleus in Alhambra , California until March 27 , 2014 . It includes a signing event with Kitase and Naora , and an artwork auction with all profits going to the victims of Typhoon Haiyan . The PlayStation 4 port of the remaster , officially announced at a PlayStation conference in China on December 11 , 2014 , was originally leaked in Square Enix France 's online store earlier that same day . The PS4 release supports save transfers from the PS3 and Vita versions , remote play on the Vita , and switching between the original and remastered soundtracks .

 The remaster has received favorable reviews . On Metacritic , the Vita version holds a score of 86 / 100 , the PS3 version an 85 / 100 , the PS4 version an 84 / 100 , and the PC version an 83 / 100 . 
 Reaction to the quality of the remaster was mostly positive . IGN 's Meghan Sullivan said that despite the game showing its roots , it " looks and sounds dramatically better " , though critiqued some textures , off @-@ putting facial close @-@ ups and lip @-@ synching problems carried over from the original . Gamespot 's Josiah Renaudin was generally positive , calling the visual upgrades " compelling reasons to revisit one of the most poignant entries in the long @-@ running series . " , although he found the uneven graphical upgrade companions between player characters and NPCs jarring . Reviewing the PlayStation 3 version , Destructoid 's Dale North generally praised the upgrade , although stated that the fixed camera had not aged well and some of the smaller , more detailed aspects of environments and models had not received a thorough HD treatment . Game Informer 's Kimberley Wallace generally praised the upgrade , but noted that character movements betrayed the game 's age . GamesRadar 's Ashley Reed called the environments better @-@ looking , but found the characters " oddly doll @-@ like " and noted graphical limitations carried over from the original . She found less of these problems in X @-@ 2 . Digital Spy 's Mark Langshaw praised the upgrade , but noted framerate dips and " ropey " animations . He also noted that the character models in X @-@ 2 were updated better than those in X. Reviewing the PS3 version , VideoGamer.com 's Daniel Cairns was highly positive , despite noting some lingering awkward moments . In his review of the Vita version , Ryan King of NowGamer generally praised the updates and polishing the game received . While the Vita version was similarly praised by the majority of reviewers , though Renaudin and Wallace noted that some dated textures stood out more . 
 The remastered soundtrack received mixed to positive reviews . North noted that the revamped music " might be less agreeable to fans of the original score . " , while praising the general improvement in the sound . Wallace found the soundtrack a mixed bag , with some tracks being improved by the remastering and others feeling uneven or losing their impact . Renaudin said that , while the soundtrack was crisper , fans of the original " might not immediately notice the acoustic alterations . " Eternal Calm , Last Mission and Will received mixed responses . Caires called Last Mission " a good little distraction " , but called Will " incomprehensible " . Sullivan didn 't enjoy Eternal Calm or Last Mission , while finding Will " incredibly weird and confusing . " , recommending players to stay clear of it . Wallace called Last Mission " a nice diversion , but not incredibly engaging . " , while North noted that it " may not have as much appeal to fans of your typical Final Fantasy game . " 
 Opinions for the original gameplay and story remained generally unchanged from the original games : the stories for X and X @-@ 2 received positive and mixed to positive reviews respectively , while the gameplay was generally praised . The new gameplay features for X and X @-@ 2 received mixed to positive reviews . Sullivan called the extra content " [ her ] favorite thing about this remastered version " , while Langshaw called the extra features , including Last Mission , " welcome inclusions . "

 The audio drama sparked speculation of a second sequel to X. In a February 2014 interview , Shinji Hashimoto said that the audio drama was simply meant to expand on the universe and did not mean a sequel was in development . Prior to this , Nojima stated that if there was enough demand , there could be developments , and that he would like to write the story for a second sequel . Later , speaking with Famitsu in a feature concerning industry rumors , Kitase denied that a second sequel was in development , and that both Eien no Daishō and the audio drama were simply intended as standalone continuations of the games ' universe . 
 = 1981 Canada Cup = 
 The 1981 Labatt Canada Cup was the second best @-@ on @-@ best ice hockey world championship and involved the world 's top six hockey nations . Tournament games were held in Edmonton , Winnipeg , Montreal and Ottawa . The Soviet Union defeated Canada in a single game final to win its first title , while Soviet goaltender Vladislav Tretiak was named most valuable player . Canada 's Wayne Gretzky led the tournament in scoring with 12 points . 
 This second edition of the Canada Cup was originally scheduled to be held in 1979 but was postponed due to disputes between the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association and Hockey Canada . It was postponed a second time in 1980 following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and Canada 's boycott of sporting events with the Soviet Union as a result . When finally held in 1981 , tournament organizer Alan Eagleson speculated it could be the last such event due to rising costs and disappointing attendance . Eagleson generated additional controversy when he refused to allow the Soviets to take the Canada Cup trophy with them to the Soviet Union . 
 = = Organization = = 
 At its congress in the summer of 1978 , the International Ice Hockey Federation approved proposals to hold the second and third Canada Cup tournaments in 1979 and 1982 . However , tensions between Canada 's rival governing bodies , the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association ( CAHA ) and Hockey Canada , increased after the latter body accused the CAHA of reneging on promises it had made regarding Hockey Canada 's control of international events involving professional players . Hockey Canada 's chief negotiator for international events , Alan Eagleson , accused the CAHA of attempting to sabotage the Canada Cup and threatened to cancel the tournament if the CAHA refused to compromise with his body . 
 The tournament was put in further jeopardy in January 1979 when General Motors withdrew as a major sponsor ; Eagleson argued GM withdrew as a result of the dispute with the CAHA . The disputes put the two bodies on the verge of severing all ties , a move that would have led to Hockey Canada refusing to release any professional or university player to any of Canada 's national teams . The tournament was ultimately postponed by a year until September 1980 . 
 The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 and threatened boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow led organizers to consider again postponing the Canada Cup . While Eagleson initially favoured allowing the tournament to go ahead regardless of the political situation , he ultimately agreed that Hockey Canada should again postpone the Canada Cup after the Canadian Government joined the Olympic boycott . A brief effort to move the tournament to Sweden was quickly put down when Eagleson informed them that neither Hockey Canada nor the National Hockey League Players Association ( NHLPA ) would participate in such an event . 
 Undaunted , Eagleson and IIHF president Günther Sabetzki announced that the tournament had again been rescheduled for September 1981 . This time , the tournament went ahead as scheduled . 
 = = Teams = = 
 The Soviet Union treated the 1976 Canada Cup with disdain , but entered this tournament intent on re @-@ asserting themselves following their upset loss to the United States at the 1980 Winter Olympics . They were led by the KLM line of Vladimir Krutov , Igor Larionov and Sergei Makarov on offence , as well as the " Bobby Orr of the Soviet Union " , Vyacheslav Fetisov , and Alexei Kasatonov on defence , with the venerable Vladislav Tretiak in goal . With a strong mixture of veterans and young players , the Soviets entered the tournament as favourites . 
 Canada brought a considerably younger team as compared to their 1976 entry . Three defencemen – Ray Bourque , Paul Reinhart and Craig Hartsburg were under the age of 22 , while 20 @-@ year @-@ old Wayne Gretzky was expected to be the offensive catalyst . Gretzky 's pairing with Guy Lafleur was highly anticipated ( and they would combine with each other on 22 % of Team Canada 's goals ) , while the New York Islanders quartet of Mike Bossy , Bryan Trottier , Butch Goring and Clark Gillies were also expected to be offensive leaders . 
 With 17 National Hockey League ( NHL ) players on their roster , Sweden felt confident they could upset the Soviet Union and Canada by utilizing a system of strong team play . Kent Nilsson , coming off a 131 @-@ point season for the Calgary Flames , Thomas Steen , Ulf Nilsson and Börje Salming were expected to be the team 's leaders . With only five returning players from their appearance in the 1976 final and suffering from the defections of the Šťastný brothers – Peter , Marián and Anton – to Canada , the Czechoslovakian team entered the tournament in the midst of a rebuilding phase and were not considered contenders in 1981 . 
 The Americans , riding high following their gold medal victory at the 1980 Olympics were considered to have the potential of upsetting the stronger teams in the tournament . Mark Howe , Rod Langway and seven players from the Olympic team were expected to lead the United States . Tony Esposito was the American goaltender for the tournament . Esposito represented Canada at the 1972 Summit Series , but gained his American citizenship in time to represent his new nation . As in 1976 , Finland was expected to finish last in the six @-@ team tournament despite the fact that the Finnish hockey association considered the team sent to Canada among the best their nation had assembled .

 The tournament opened on September 1 at Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton as the Americans defeated a disorganized Swedish team , 3 – 1 . Swedish coach Anders <unk> , upset at how his team underestimated the Americans , sat several of his top players for extended periods of the third period . At the Winnipeg Arena , a young Czechoslovak team battled the Soviet Union to a 1 – 1 draw in a game marked by rough play . The Soviets were forced to rely on the stellar goaltending of Vladislav Tretiak to preserve the tie . In the third game of the opening day , Canada 's " dream line " of Gretzky , Lafleur and Gilbert Perreault combined for ten points as Canada easily defeated Finland 9 – 0 . The second line of Gillies , Trottier and Bossy also combined to score ten points in the game . 
 Finland fared little better against Czechoslovakia two nights later , dropping a 7 – 1 result . Finnish goaltender Hannu Lassila was the star of the game , however , as he made several difficult saves to keep the Finns close through two periods . Despite outshooting Finland 26 – 9 , the Czechs managed only a 2 – 1 lead after 40 minutes before finally overcoming Lassila to score five goals in the third period . Sweden attempted to employ a physical style against the Soviet Union without success , as they surrendered five power play goals in a 6 – 3 loss . Canada then defeated the United States , 8 – 3 , in a game that was played much closer than the score indicated . The Americans appeared to be headed to a draw with Canada as the two teams were tied at three with nine minutes to play before a power play goal by Mike Bossy sparked a five @-@ goal outburst for the Canadians in the dying minutes of the game . 
 The Soviets then avenged their 1980 Olympic defeat to the United States with a 4 – 1 win , while the Swedes defeated Finland 5 – 0 . Ending the third night of play , Czechoslovakia was able to overcome a late two @-@ minute , two @-@ man disadvantage to emerge with a 4 – 4 tie against Canada in a game that was described as the best of the tournament . Canada then defeated Sweden 4 – 3 , but not before losing Perrault to a broken ankle . Perrault was Canada 's leading scorer over the first four games and was considered a contender to be named most valuable player at the time of his injury . The United States then overcame an early two @-@ goal deficit against the Czechs to win 6 – 2 while the Soviets easily defeated Finland 6 – 1 
 The final night of round robin play opened with a meaningless game between the United States and Finland . The Americans had already advanced to the playoff round while Finland had been eliminated . The game ended in a 4 – 4 draw and was most notable for Montreal Forum staff accidentally playing the Italian national anthem instead of the Finnish anthem prior to the start of the game . The Czechs then easily defeated Sweden , 7 – 1 , to advance to the playoff round and eliminate the Swedes . Canada and the Soviet Union closed out the round robin with a battle for first place . A five @-@ goal outburst by Canada in the third period broke a 2 – 2 tie and sent Canada into the playoffs as the top ranked team . Their 7 – 3 win was the most lopsided victory Canada had recorded against the Soviets in 20 years . 
 = = = Semi @-@ finals = = = 
 As the top team in the playoff round , Canada faced the fourth place Americans in the first semi @-@ final . Talk entering the game revolved around the defensive style of the United States and whether they could overcome Canada 's offensive game and upset the favoured nation in a one @-@ game , winner @-@ take @-@ all scenario . Early play favoured Canada , as they opened the scoring 2 : 01 into the game on a goal by defenceman Brian Engblom , then extended their lead five minutes later when a long shot by Bossy eluded Esposito in the American goal . Another goal by Bossy saw Canada end the first period with a 3 – 0 lead . The remaining 40 minutes of the game lacked emotion , and the two teams traded goals for a 4 – 1 Canadian victory . 
 The second place Soviet Union faced third ranked Czechoslovakia in the second semi @-@ final . Soviet coach Viktor Tikhonov was agitated following his nation 's 7 – 3 defeat to Canada to end the round robin , while the Czechs had grown increasingly confident of their ability as the tournament progressed . It was the Soviets , however , who scored three first period goals to take an early 3 – 0 lead . The young Czechoslovakian team pressured their opponents for much of the final 40 minutes , outshooting the Soviets 23 – 11 in the second and third periods combined . Tretiak withstood the pressure in the Soviet goal , however , allowing only one goal as the Soviet Union emerged with a 4 – 1 victory .

Coach Scotty Bowman called it a " must win game " for Canada : " We really are favorites in the final . Nobody in this country will tolerate a loss . " The players also spoke of their desire to show the Russians that they were the world 's top hockey nation . During their pre @-@ game preparations , Tikhonov called upon his team to play the finest games of their lives : " Today you got to play so well that the entire Canadian population will talk about you afterwards and remember you for a long time . Play so well that the Canadian fans when they will leave Forum will wait for you when you get on the bus after the game and admire you . " 
 Canada held the early advantage of play , outshooting the Soviets 12 – 4 in the first period as their opponent was unable to generate offence . Despite their advantage , Canada was unable to put a puck past Tretiak , and the first period ended with no scoring . The Soviets counterattacked in the second period , opening the scoring five minutes in on a goal by Igor Larionov . Clark Gillies tied the game for Canada three minutes later , but Sergei Shepelev restored the Soviet lead three minutes after that . Shepelev added a powerplay goal late in the period to give the Soviets a 3 – 1 lead heading into the third period . The third period turned into a rout ; Shepelev completed a natural hat trick , and the Soviets scored three goals in the final four minutes to claim the championship by an 8 – 1 score . 
 Canadian goaltender Mike Liut became the scapegoat for Canada 's embarrassing loss . The game was one of the worst of his career , but Canada managed only four shots in the third period and never threatened the Soviets even though they entered the final 20 minutes down by only two goals . Tretiak , meanwhile , was named the tournament most valuable player on the strength of his goaltending throughout the event .

 The fate of the championship trophy itself was the subject of controversy after Canadian hockey officials accompanied by Montreal Police prevented the Soviet team from taking the trophy back to the Soviet Union . As he took the Cup from the Soviets at the airport , Eagleson claimed that the trophy was intended to remain in Canada at all times . The decision upset the Soviets who claimed that Eagleson 's decision was made " in violation of the traditions existing at international competitions " . George Smith , a truck driver from Winnipeg , organized a fundraising campaign that raised enough money to create a replica trophy that was gifted to Soviet officials at their Canadian embassy . Soviet officials praised the sportsmanship of the Canadian people as they accepted the replica . 
 Tournament organizer Allan Eagleson , lamenting the rapidly increasing costs of hosting such an event , speculated that the 1981 Canada Cup could be the last . Noting that some costs had increased up to 200 % over what was paid in 1976 , Eagleson speculated that a third Canada Cup might have to be held in a different format . Organizers were also disappointed in tournament attendance . The two games scheduled to be held in Quebec City were transferred to Ottawa after only 300 tickets were pre @-@ sold for the round robin game between Czechoslovakia and Sweden and 1 @,@ 000 for the semi @-@ final game . Low ticket sales also led to fears that the games scheduled for Winnipeg would also be moved , but the investments the television partners had made in rental equipment to broadcast the games from Winnipeg prevented a switch . Adding to Eagleson 's woes , Toronto Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard refused to allow any games to be held in Maple Leaf Gardens as a result of his hatred of the Soviet Union . 
 Strong support in Montreal , and the response in Ottawa after the games were moved to the national capital left Eagleson increasingly confident in the tournament 's future . The 1981 Canada Cup turned a profit of about C $ 1 million to be split between Hockey Canada and the National Hockey League Players Association pension fund , one third that of the 1976 tournament . Shortly after the tournament ended , Eagleson confirmed he intended to hold a third Canada Cup . He noted that Canada 's loss in the final played a role in his decision : " As far as I am concerned personally , it 's probably preferable that we lost . I think if we had won , I 'd have said , ' To hell with it ' . "

 = Oslo Airport , Fornebu = 
 Oslo Airport , Fornebu ( IATA : <unk> , ICAO : <unk> ) ( Norwegian : Oslo lufthavn , Fornebu ) was the main airport serving Oslo and Eastern Norway from 1 June 1939 to 7 October 1998 . It was then replaced by Oslo Airport , Gardermoen and the area has since been redeveloped . The airport was located at Fornebu in Bærum , 8 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) from the city center . Fornebu had two runways , one 2 @,@ 370 @-@ metre ( 7 @,@ 780 ft ) 06 / 24 and one 1 @,@ 800 metres ( 5 @,@ 900 ft ) 01 / 19 , and a capacity of 20 aircraft . In 1996 , the airport had 170 @,@ 823 aircraft movements and 10 @,@ 072 @,@ 054 passengers . The airport served as a hub for Scandinavian Airlines System ( SAS ) , Braathens SAFE and Widerøe . In 1996 , they and 21 other airlines served 28 international destinations . Due to limited terminal and runway capacity , intercontinental and charter airlines used Gardermoen . The Royal Norwegian Air Force retained offices at Fornebu . 
 The airport opened as a combined sea and land airport , serving both domestic and international destinations . It replaced the land airport at Kjeller and the sea airport at Gressholmen . In 1940 , it was taken over by the German Luftwaffe , but civilian air services began again in 1946 and it was then taken over by the Norwegian Civil Airport Administration . The airport at first had three runways , each at 800 metres ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) , but these were gradually expanded , first the north – south runway and finally the east – west one to the current length in 1962 . The same year the terminal moved south to the final location . A large @-@ scale expansion to the terminal was made during the 1980s . 
 = = Facilities = = 
 At the time of closing , the airport consisted of a single terminal with three satellites : two domestic and one international . The service building had three stories , one for arrival , one for departure and one for administration . Airplane capacity at the airport was 20 craft ; five planes parked at the international terminal could be served with jetbridges , while passengers had to walk outdoors to get to domestic planes . The airport terminals were 36 @,@ 000 square metres ( 390 @,@ 000 sq ft ) , of which 16 @,@ 000 square metres ( 170 @,@ 000 sq ft ) were for the public . In the main hall of the terminal were two murals made by Kai Fjell , both which have been preserved . The largest was the 310 @-@ square @-@ metre ( 3 @,@ 300 sq ft ) Arrival and Departure which was completed in 1968 and covered three stories . 
 At the north part of the airport , located where the former main terminal was until 1964 , were the offices of the Air Force and Fred . Olsen Airtransport , the main hangar for Braathens SAFE , as well as mechanical facilities for SAS and Fred . Olsen . The fire station and snowplowing facilities were also located there , along with the main radar center . All the terminal buildings built until the early 1960s were still intact until the closing of the airport . 
 In 1989 , about 5 @,@ 500 people worked at Fornebu . Of these , 3 @,@ 600 worked for the airlines , including ground services . The airport administration had 350 employees , including administration , air control , fire fighters , meteorology and maintenance . The remaining 500 people worked for other public offices , including the police and customs , as well as service employees working for private companies involved with passenger services . 
 Fornebu had two runways : a main 2 @,@ 200 metres ( 7 @,@ 200 ft ) east – west runway and a secondary 1 @,@ 800 metres ( 5 @,@ 900 ft ) north – south . Only the main runway was used under ordinary weather conditions , with the north – south runway only being used if there was strong winds from the north and for general aviation , helicopters and ambulance aircraft . The main runway was equipped with instrument landing system category 1 . Under ordinary weather conditions , flights to Fornebu were to , as soon as possible , divert southwards along the Oslo Fjord to avoid noise pollution to residential areas . However , when necessary , a direct approach could be made eastwards from Drammen or westwards from <unk> . Until 1996 , Oslo Air Traffic Control Center ( Oslo ATCC ) was located at Fornebu . It had the responsibility to oversee all air traffic in southeastern Norway , bordering to Dovre in the north , almost to Stavanger in the west , halfway to Stockholm to the east and almost to Denmark in the south . 
 Since Fornebu is located on a peninsula , all transport to the airport needed to go via Lysaker . A branch from the motorway European Route E18 allowed access to the airport . Lysaker Station is on the Drammen Line , and was served by both local and regional trains , including services to Oslo Central Station . In addition , Stor @-@ Oslo Lokaltrafikk offered bus transport to the airport from Asker and Bærum , including Lysaker . A limited number of services were extended to Snarøya . An airport coach connected the airport to the city center . 
 = = Airlines and destinations = = 
 In 1996 , the airport had 170 @,@ 823 aircraft movement and 10 @,@ 072 @,@ 054 passengers , making it the busiest airport in the country . It served as the main hub for Braathens SAFE , one of three main hubs for SAS and as one of many for Widerøe . 
 Prior to 1 April 1994 , all air transport in Norway was restricted to airlines that had received concession from the ministry . On the primary domestic routes , the traffic was split between SAS and Braathens SAFE , although both had services to Trondheim and Stavanger . SAS had a monopoly to Bergen and Northern Norway ( Alta , Bardufoss , Bodø , Harstad / Narvik , Kirkenes , Longyearbyen and Tromsø ) , while Braathens SAFE had a monopoly to the other primary airports in Southern Norway ( Haugesund , Kristiansand , Kristiansund , Molde , Røros and Ålesund ) . Widerøe had a monopoly on the regional state @-@ supported routes ( Brønnøysund , Florø , Førde , Sandane , <unk> and Ørsta / Volda ) , and also served Stord and Sandefjord . 
 Following Norway joining the European Economic Area ( EEA ) , the airline industry was deregulated , allowing any airline from any EEA member country to make domestic or international flights to Norway . However , by 1994 there was no available slots at Fornebu during the morning and evening rush hours , limiting the number of new routes that could be established . After the deregulation , Fornebu could not offer slots to new airlines , and SAS and Braathens could not establish as many competing routes as they wanted to . However , domestic services were provided by both SAS and Braathens SAFE to Stavanger , Bergen , Trondheim , Bodø , Harstad / Narvik , Tromsø and Longyearbyen . The remaining domestic airports were only served by the incumbent . In addition , Teddy Air offered services to Fagernes . 
 International services were provided by 21 airlines to 28 destinations . SAS had international flights to Amsterdam , Brussels , Billund , Copenhagen , Düsseldorf , Frankfurt , Helsinki , London @-@ Heathrow , Manchester , Munich , New York , Nice , Paris , Stockholm and Zurich . Braathens SAFE offered international services to Alicante , Billund , London @-@ Gatwick , Málaga , Newcastle and Stockholm . Lufthansa offered flights to Düsseldorf , Frankfurt , Hamburg and Munich . Other European airlines that provided services to their main hubs included Aeroflot ( Moscow @-@ Sheremetyevo ) , Air France ( Paris @-@ Charles de Gaulle ) , Air Malta ( Valletta ) , TAP Air Portugal ( Lisbon ) , AirUK ( London @-@ Stansted ) , Alitalia ( Milan ) , British Airways ( London @-@ Heathrow ) , Dan @-@ Air ( London @-@ Gatwick ) , Delta Air Lines ( New York @-@ JFK ) , Iberia ( Madrid ) and ( Barcelona ) , Icelandair ( Reykjavík ) , KLM ( Amsterdam ) , LOT Polish Airlines ( Warsaw ) , Pan Am ( New York @-@ JFK ) and Sabena ( Brussels ) .

 Aviation in Oslo started in 1909 , when Carl <unk> of Sweden made exhibition flights from fields at Etterstad . Following this , the Norwegian Army decided that it needed a military land airport , and established itself at Kjeller , outside Oslo , in 1912 . Kjeller Airport served as the main airport for Norway until the 1930s , being the main base of the newly established Norwegian Army Air Service and the first place to have air services . 
 In 1918 , the first Norwegian airline , Det Norske <unk> , was established , and plans were made to start flying to Trondheim . The following year , civil aviation was discussed in the Norwegian Parliament for the first time . Norsk <unk> wanted to start seaplane routes from Oslo , and applied to the state to be allowed to lease 2 hectares ( 4 @.@ 9 acres ) of the island <unk> for 99 years . The Oslo Port Authority recommended that the application be denied , since it was already in negotiations with the state to purchase the island and seaplane services would interfere with ship traffic . The ministry recommended a ten @-@ year lease . Sam Eyde , who was a member of parliament , recommended that the state should be responsible for all airports , and suggested a state @-@ owned seaplane airport be built at Gressholmen . However no money was granted for construction of the airport until 1926 , when Gressholmen Airport opened . Gressholmen was served by Norsk <unk> and Deutsche Luft Hansa . 
 During the late 1920s and early 1930s , the politicians became less satisfied with the solution . Kjeller was considered too far away from the city center ( about 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) , but along the mainline railway ) , while travel to Gressholmen needed to be made by ferry . The politicians also wanted to have a combined land- and seaplane airport , and it had become clear that serving Gressholmen was interfering with ship traffic . A committee was established to look into the matter . While considering many locations , it made detail surveys of only two places : Ekeberg , located southeast of the city center , and Fornebu , to the southwest . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 At the time , Fornebu was a mostly unpopulated area . Until 1907 , a lumber mill was located at Snarøya on the southern tip . From 1921 , Snarøya had received a coach service , and had grown with many single dwellings . About 1 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) northeast of Fornebu is the town of Lysaker , which had a railway station on the Drammen Line . The committee decided to purchase 90 hectares ( 220 acres ) on the northern part of the peninsula . The Fornebu solution would be more expensive , but would yield a larger airport and better landing conditions . The formal decision to build the airport was taken in 1934 . 
 It was the Municipality of Oslo which built the airport , having bought the land from the Municipality of Bærum . Construction was to serve as work creation for the unemployed , and workers were selected based on how long they had been unemployed and the number of people in their family . Because the need for workplaces was greatest in the winter , most of the construction was done during the winters of 1935 , 1936 and 1937 . Not until 1937 was a normal 48 @-@ hour week throughout the year introduced . 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cubic metres ( 35 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cu ft ) of rock was blasted and , along with garbage from Oslo , used to fill in the swamps and depressions . Because of the delays , plans were changed and three runways were built , two 800 metres ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) long and one 700 metres ( 2 @,@ 300 ft ) long . The airport was equipped with a control tower ; administration building ; a hangar with a workshop ; and a service building . Docks for seaplanes were constructed about 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) to the south , on the east shore of the peninsula . 
 In 1934 , there were three domestic airlines in Norway : Det Norske Luftfartsselskap ( DNL ) , Norske <unk> and Widerøe 's <unk> . All three applied to the state for subsidies to operate routes . DNL applied for a ten @-@ year concession with a NOK 500 @,@ 000 annual subsidy to fly Oslo – Kristiansand – Amsterdam , continuing northwards to Ålesund . Widerøe applied for NOK 265 @,@ 000 per year for a three @-@ year concession for the seaplane routes Oslo – Bergen and Bergen – Trondheim . Norske <unk> applied for NOK 250 @,@ 000 per year for a route from Bergen to Copenhagen via Kristiansand and Oslo . The following year , parliament passed a long @-@ term plan for construction of airports , which would be located in Oslo , Telemark , Kristiansand , Stavanger , Bergen , Ålesund and Trondheim . In each case , the municipalities would have to purchase land and build the airport , but the state would reimburse 50 % of the investments . Due to the high cost burden on the municipalities , only Stavanger Airport , Sola and Kristiansand Airport , Kjevik were operational by the time Fornebu opened . 
 = = = Opening and war = = = 
 The first aircraft at Fornebu was a Lufthansa Junkers Ju 52 in September 1938 . It had flown a scheduled route to Kjeller , and the captain had continued to Fornebu to try the new airport . On 16 April 1939 , the seaplane section came into regular use . The first seaplane was a Ju 52 operated by DNL to Copenhagen . The official opening was on 1 June 1939 . The first aircraft to land after the official opening was a Douglas DC @-@ 2 operated by KLM from Amsterdam . The first departure was on the Danish airline Det Danske <unk> , when a Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 200 took off to Copenhagen . The captain made a mistake , and took off from the parking space instead of the runway . In addition to these two routes , Luft Hansa started flights to Germany and DNL flew to Amsterdam . During the fall , DNL also flew from Perth , Scotland , via Oslo to Stockholm , but this route was soon canceled . 
 1940 diagram 
 As part of the invasion of Norway by Nazi Germany on 9 April 1940 , German Luftwaffe @-@ aircraft landed at Fornebu . There was no attempt by the civilian airport authorities to hinder this , such as driving cars onto the runway , although several German aircraft collided with each other during the landing . A KLM aircraft had a scheduled service that morning , and the captain was ordered to leave the passengers , take the crew and return to Oslo . On 12 April , the airport was bombed by the British Royal Air Force . On 14 April , the KLM captain was granted permission to fly back to Amsterdam with the crew , albeit without any passengers . The German military used Fornebu heavily during the war , but it was never of any strategic importance , since it was located far from any battle zones . During the war , the airport officially remained owned by the municipality . By orders of the German authorities , the main north – south runway was expanded to 1 @,@ 200 metres ( 3 @,@ 900 ft ) , and all facilities not yet built were completed . However , during the war all other runways than the main north – south were taken out of use . At the north end of the runway , the Luftwaffe built several hangars and a prison camp . Prisoners were used to keep the runways free of snow during winter , by marching along them and stomping the snow down . 
 In May 1945 , as German forces were ousted from Norway , the airport was taken over by the Allies and the Royal Norwegian Air Force . None of the civilian airlines were in operation , and the Air Force started flying commercial flights . In addition to previous lines , a route was started to Northern Norway , although it had to be terminated for the winter . Due to the lack of qualified personnel , the international services had to be terminated as well . In early 1946 , management of the airport was transferred back to the municipality . Due to the technological development of aviation during the war , the runway needed to be expanded . The 1 @,@ 200 @-@ metre ( 3 @,@ 900 ft ) runway was sufficient for Douglas DC @-@ 3 aircraft , but insufficient for larger Douglas DC @-@ 4s . The latter were all used by American Overseas Airways , DNL on its North America routes and British European Airways on its route to London , which were all transferred to Oslo Airport , Gardermoen . 
 = = = Expansion = = = 
 On 1 November 1947 , Norsk Spisevognselskap established a restaurant at the airport . In 1946 , DNL launched plans to expand the north – south runway to 3 @,@ 000 metres ( 9 @,@ 800 ft ) by taking into use the whole peninsula . In addition , it wanted a second east – west runway to be built . The state took over ownership of the airport — without compensation — in 1946 , albeit with the clause that if the airport ever should close , the real estate should be returned to the municipality . Stavanger Airport had been a candidate for intercontinental travel , but a state committee in 1949 decided that instead this should be shared between Fornebu and Gardermoen . Another committee was established in 1948 , and in 1950 it recommended that all airport services in the Oslo region should be concentrated at Gardermoen , and that a new motorway be built to the airport . Among politicians and planners , there were two main ideologies : The first , which dominated in political circles , stated that Fornebu 's close proximity to the city center was a key to reaching a market in Oslo and for the growth of the airlines . The second emphasized that , in the long run , Fornebu could not fulfill the requirements of a central airport , and that a better location should be established . 
 Following the political processes , the north – south runway was extended to 1 @,@ 600 metres ( 5 @,@ 200 ft ) . With the completion of this , intercontinental traffic was moved from Gardermoen to Fornebu . In 1946 , Overseas Scandinavian Airlines System had been established between DNL , DDL and the Swedish <unk> . The same year , shipowner Ludvig G. Braathen established Braathens South American and Far East ( Braathens SAFE ) , which started with charter flights using DC @-@ 4s . The first civilian route was operated by KLM , who started the route Oslo – Kristiansand – Amsterdam in March 1946 . From 1 April , DNL operated a route to Copenhagen , followed a week later with the route via Stavanger to London , using DC @-@ 3s . The third DNL route was to Stockholm using Ju 52s , and the fourth via Gothenburg and Copenhagen to Zurich and Marseilles . In May , DNL started routes to Trondheim and Tromsø , and later onwards to Kirkenes . It also started a direct service to Copenhagen . In October , routes were established via Kristiansand to Amsterdam , Brussels and Paris . Finally , a route was started via Copenhagen to Praha and to Stavanger . In 1946 , DNL had 47 @,@ 000 passengers ( although not all flew through Fornebu ) . The company operated six DC @-@ 3s and five Ju 52s . 
 In 1947 , Icelandair started flights to Reykjavík and the same year British European Airways transferred its London route from Gardermoen to Fornebu . DNL bought three Short Sandringham flying boats which were put into service along the coast as the " Flying Coastal Express " . They remained in service from 1947 until May 1950 , but proved expensive in operation . In 1949 , Braathens SAFE introduced scheduled flights from Fornebu using DC @-@ 3s ; it had long @-@ haul flights to the Far East , with stops in Amsterdam , Geneva , Rome , Cairo , Basra , Karachi , Bombay , Calcutta and Bangkok before arriving in Hong Kong . Following the establishment of Scandinavian Airlines System ( SAS ) in 1949 , all international concessions were transferred to that company , and Braathens SAFE started domestic services , although it kept its existing concessions on international routes until 1954 . 
 Braathens SAFE 's first domestic service was via Tønsberg Airport , Jarlsberg to Stavanger , and later a route to Trondheim . These were both operated with Heron aircraft . At first the Trondheim route was flown to Lade , but were quickly transferred to the current airport at Værnes . <unk> started flights to Reykjavík in 1952 . 
 In 1953 , work started with expanding the north – south runway to 1 @,@ 800 metres ( 5 @,@ 900 ft ) and building a new east – west runway which also was to become 1 @,@ 800 metres ( 5 @,@ 900 ft ) . The same year a new commission was established , which in 1957 recommended that the east – west runway be expanded to 3 @,@ 300 metres ( 10 @,@ 800 ft ) and the north – south runway to 2 @,@ 150 metres ( 7 @,@ 050 ft ) . Local residents and politicians were opposed to the expansion plans , and Akershus County Council voted against them . The ministry then chose to expand the east – west runway to only 2 @,@ 200 metres ( 7 @,@ 200 ft ) and leave the north – south runway untouched . The plans would allow the east – west runway to be expanded to 2 @,@ 800 metres ( 9 @,@ 200 ft ) in the future , if necessary . The north – south runway had difficult landing conditions , in part because of the residential areas north of the line . From 1959 , the ministry denied jet aircraft from using the then longer runway . In the 1950s , SAS started using Convair 440s , while Braathens SAFE took into use Fokker F @-@ 27s . Both companies later also took into use Douglas DC @-@ 6s . 
 In 1952 , SAS started flights to Bodø Airport and in 1955 to Bergen Airport , Flesland . In 1955 , Braathens SAFE also started flights to Kristiansand and Farsund Airport , Lista , and the following year to Notodden Airport , Tuven . That year also saw some of its Trondheim flights land at Hamar Airport , and in 1957 at Røros Airport . In 1958 , Ålesund Airport , Vigra was opened and became served by Braathens SAFE . The Røros stops were terminated in 1958 , but reinstated in 1963 after the runway had been extended . The Hamar stops were permanently terminated in 1959 . 
 In 1960 , Finnair started flying to Helsinki , although direct flights were not introduced until 1971 . After 1962 , the east – west runway became the main runway . Along with the runway expansion , a new service building , with a capacity for 2 million passengers , was opened in 1964 . It was located about half a kilometer ( quarter of a mile ) south of the former terminal . Designed by Odd <unk> Arkitektkontor , it had two stories , one for arrivals and one for departures , and two wings , one for domestic and one for international flights . It included a central hall that had a panorama view over the aircraft . The expanded facilities allowed SAS to take into use Sud Aviation Caravelle jets on the Copenhagen routes , although they were also occasionally used to Bodø . 
 = = = Cramped quarters = = = 
 Three airports were opened in Finnmark in 1963 , all served by SAS : Alta Airport , Kirkenes Airport , Høybuktmoen and Lakselv Airport , Banak . The following year , SAS also started flights to Tromsø Airport . In 1966 , Lufthansa started flights to Hamburg , and later also introduced services to Düsseldorf , Frankfurt and Munich . During the 1960s , SAS introduced <unk> on most of the domestic routes . 
 During the 1970s , Douglas DC @-@ 8s were also taken into use . Pan American World Airways had flights to New York City from 1967 to 1973 and from 1976 to 1978 . Braathens SAFE started taking delivery of Boeing 737 @-@ 200s and Fokker F @-@ 28s in 1969 , and these gradually took over most of the domestic routes . In 1970 , Air France and Swissair started flying to Fornebu from Paris and Zurich , respectively . They were supplemented by Aeroflot 's Moscow route in 1972 . 
 In 1971 , a state committee recommended that Gardermoen be expanded to take a larger share of the traffic from Fornebu . At the same time , a new main airport was eventually to be built at Hobøl . From 1971 , charter flights were moved to Gardermoen , although SAS and Braathens SAFE were granted dispensation so they only needed to serve one Oslo airport . On 1 July 1971 , Widerøe also started serving domestic routes to Fornebu , with the opening of a regional airport in Sogn og Fjordane . These routes were served using de Havilland Canada Twin Otter and later de Havilland Canada Dash 7 aircraft , although regular services to all airports were not introduced until the late 1970s , with the introduction of the Dash 7 . The last four primary airports were opened during the 1970s . Braathens SAFE started flights to Kristiansund Airport , Kvernberget in 1972 , Molde Airport , Årø in 1972 and Harstad / Narvik Airport , <unk> in 1973 . In 1975 , SAS started flights to Haugesund Airport , Karmøy . 
 During the 1980s , the airport was again deemed too small . In 1983 , all charter flights operated by SAS and Braathens were forced to move to Gardermoen . Additional foreign services were introduced , namely Sabena to Brussels in 1985 , Dan @-@ Air to London @-@ Gatwick and Newcastle in 1986 and Alitalia to Milan in 1988 . During a period of reconstruction at Gardermoen , Trans World Airlines also served Fornebu , and the same year Pan American reintroduced its route to New York . Air Europe also started to fly from London @-@ Gatwick to Fornebu . An additional storey was added to the service building , allowing office space to be moved there and free up space for check @-@ in and traveler service on the two main storeys . Two satellites were built for the domestic terminal , one each for Braathens SAFE and SAS , allowing increased waiting area for travelers . The international terminal was expanded with a five @-@ gate pier with jetbridges . A multi @-@ story parking house was also built . 
 Norsk Air started serving Fornebu following the opening of Fagernes Airport , Leirin in 1987 . The route was closed within a year , but taken up again by Coast Air in 1990 . From 1996 , the route was taken over by Teddy Air . 
 In 1989 , Braathens SAFE started its first international scheduled service since 1960 , from Fornebu to Billund in Denmark . Two years later , the company started flying to Newcastle , after Dan @-@ Air had withdrawn from the route , and to Malmö in Sweden . That year also saw the start of Norway Airlines , who started a base at Fornebu and offered flights to London @-@ Gatwick , as well as to Stockholm , in cooperation with Transwede , and to Copenhagen , in cooperation with Sterling Airlines . In 1992 , both Norway Airlines and Dan @-@ Air went bankrupt , and Braathens SAFE started flights to London @-@ Gatwick . It terminated the Malmö route in 1994 . After the deregulation , Braathens SAFE also introduced flights to Alicante , Málaga , Rome and Stockholm . Widerøe introduced international services to Gothenburg and Berlin . 
 In 1994 , the domestic and international flights to the European Union were deregulated , and the number of international services increased and Fornebu received airlines such as Air Malta , Air Portugal , AirUK and LOT Polish Airlines . Other airlines to fly from Fornebu during the 1980s and 1990s includes Delta Air Lines , Northwest Orient and Tower Air . Domestically , Braathens SAFE introduced flights to Bergen , Bodø , Harstad / Narvik and Tromsø .

 During the 1960s , a political debate started concerning whether or not a new main airport should be built for Oslo and Eastern Norway . A government report launched in 1970 , suggested surveys for five locations : Gardermoen , Hurum , <unk> , <unk> and Ås . Hobøl was preliminarily selected and areas reserved for a future airport . During the 1970s , the Labour Party became concerned that Hobøl was located too centrally in relation to the growth areas around Oslo , and instead wanted to use Gardermoen , in an attempt to force the population growth further north . Commercial interests and the airlines supported Hobøl . In 1983 , Parliament decided to abandon the plans for Hobøl and continue with a divided solution . Fornebu would be expanded , and all charter traffic be moved to Gardermoen . From 1988 , all international traffic would also be moved , making Fornebu a purely domestic airport . 
 Increased traffic in the mid @-@ 1980s changed the politician 's interests , and in 1988 Parliament voted to build a new main airport at Hurum , located on the same side of Oslo as Fornebu , but further away . However , new weather data showed that Hurum was unsuitable , and the location was discarded . There were accusations that the data was fabricated to manipulate the political decision . In 1992 , parliament made a final vote that started construction of a new airport at Gardermoen and mandated the closure of Fornebu . 
 Financing of the airport at Gardermoen would be done through a state loan issued to a limited company owned by the Civil Airport Administration . This company would build and operate Gardermoen , but from 1 January 1997 it also took over operation of Fornebu . After the last aircraft took off from Fornebu on 7 October 1998 , 300 people spent the night transporting 500 truckloads of equipment from Fornebu to Gardermoen . The new airport opened on the morning of 8 October 1998 . 
 Some locals wanted to keep Fornebu as a regional airport for the Oslo and Bærum area . The proposal was to keep part of the runway and terminals and allow aircraft such as the Bombardier Dash 8 , Fokker 50 and British Aerospace 146 to use the airport . Proponents argued that a similar role was filled by Stockholm @-@ Bromma Airport and Chicago 's Midway Airport . 
 The opening of Gardermoen had a strategic impact on aviation in Norway . Despite the deregulation of the market in 1994 , the lack of free slots at Fornebu made it impossible to have free competition , since no new airlines could establish themselves and no new international airlines could fly to Fornebu . Gardermoen allowed this to happen , and from 1 August 1998 , Color Air started with flights from Oslo , pressing down prices on domestic routes . Although the airline went bankrupt the following year , the losses for Braathens were so high that it was taken over by SAS . The gap was then filled by Norwegian Air Shuttle .

 = 4 Vesta = 
 Vesta , minor @-@ planet designation 4 Vesta , is one of the largest objects in the asteroid belt , with a mean diameter of 525 kilometres ( 326 mi ) . It was discovered by the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers on 29 March 1807 and is named after Vesta , the virgin goddess of home and hearth from Roman mythology . 
 Vesta is the second @-@ most @-@ massive and second @-@ largest body in the asteroid belt after the dwarf planet Ceres , and it contributes an estimated 9 % of the mass of the asteroid belt . It is slightly larger than Pallas , though significantly more massive . Vesta is the last remaining rocky protoplanet ( with a differentiated interior ) of the kind that formed the terrestrial planets . Numerous fragments of Vesta were ejected by collisions one and two billion years ago that left two enormous craters occupying much of Vesta 's southern hemisphere . Debris from these events has fallen to Earth as <unk> – eucrite – diogenite ( HED ) meteorites , which have been a rich source of information about Vesta . 
 Vesta is the brightest asteroid visible from Earth . Its maximum distance from the Sun is slightly greater than the minimum distance of Ceres from the Sun , though its orbit lies entirely within that of Ceres . 
 NASA 's Dawn spacecraft entered orbit around Vesta on 16 July 2011 for a one @-@ year exploration and left orbit on 5 September 2012 en route to its final destination , Ceres . Researchers continue to examine data collected by Dawn for additional insights into the formation and history of Vesta . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Discovery = = = 
 Heinrich Olbers discovered Pallas in 1802 , the year after the discovery of Ceres . He proposed that the two objects were the remnants of a destroyed planet . He sent a letter with his proposal to the English astronomer William Herschel , suggesting that a search near the locations where the orbits of Ceres and Pallas intersected might reveal more fragments . These orbital intersections were located in the constellations of Cetus and Virgo . Olbers commenced his search in 1802 , and on 29 March 1807 he discovered Vesta in the constellation Virgo — a coincidence , because Ceres , Pallas , and Vesta are not fragments of a larger body . Because the asteroid Juno had been discovered in 1804 , this made Vesta the fourth object to be identified in the region that is now known as the asteroid belt . The discovery was announced in a letter addressed to German astronomer Johann H. Schröter dated 31 March . Because Olbers already had credit for discovering a planet ( Pallas ; at the time , the asteroids were considered to be planets ) , he gave the honor of naming his new discovery to German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss , whose orbital calculations had enabled astronomers to confirm the existence of Ceres , the first asteroid , and who had computed the orbit of the new planet in the remarkably short time of 10 hours . Gauss decided on the Roman virgin goddess of home and hearth , Vesta . 
 = = = Name = = = 
 Vesta was the fourth asteroid to be discovered , hence the number 4 in its formal designation . The name Vesta , or national variants thereof , is in international use with two exceptions : Greece and China . In Greek , the name adopted was the Hellenic equivalent of Vesta , Hestia ( 4 <unk> ) ; in English , that name is used for 46 Hestia ( Greeks use the name " Hestia " for both , with the minor @-@ planet numbers used for disambiguation ) . In Chinese , Vesta is called the ' hearth @-@ god ( <unk> ) star ' , <unk> <unk> , in contrast to the goddess Vesta , who goes by her Latin name . 
 Upon its discovery , Vesta was , like Ceres , Pallas , and Juno before it , classified as a planet and given a planetary symbol . The symbol representing the altar of Vesta with its sacred fire and was designed by Gauss . In Gauss 's conception , this was drawn ; in its modern form , it is . 
 After the discovery of Vesta , no further objects were discovered for 38 years , and the Solar System was thought to have eleven planets . However , in 1845 , new asteroids started being discovered at a rapid pace , and by 1851 there were fifteen , each with its own symbol , in addition to the eight major planets ( Neptune had been discovered in 1846 ) . It soon became clear that it would be impractical to continue inventing new planetary symbols indefinitely , and some of the existing ones proved difficult to draw quickly . That year , the problem was addressed by Benjamin Apthorp Gould , who suggested numbering asteroids in their order of discovery , and placing this number in a disk ( circle ) as the generic symbol of an asteroid . Thus , the fourth asteroid , Vesta , acquired the generic symbol ④ . This was soon coupled with the name into an official number – name designation , ④ Vesta , as the number of minor planets increased . By 1858 , the circle had been simplified to parentheses , ( 4 ) Vesta , which were easier to typeset . Other punctuation , such as 4 ) Vesta and 4 , Vesta , was also used , but had more or less completely died out by 1949 . Today , either Vesta , or , more commonly , 4 Vesta , is used . 
 = = = Early measurements = = = 
 Photometric observations of Vesta were made at the Harvard College Observatory in 1880 – 1882 and at the Observatoire de Toulouse in 1909 . These and other observations allowed the rotation rate of Vesta to be determined by the 1950s . However , the early estimates of the rotation rate came into question because the light curve included variations in both shape and albedo . 
 Early estimates of the diameter of Vesta ranged from 383 ( in 1825 ) to 444 km . E.C. Pickering produced an estimated diameter of 513 ± 17 km in 1879 , which is close to the modern value for the mean diameter , but the subsequent estimates ranged from a low of 390 km up to a high of 602 km during the next century . The measured estimates were based on photometry . In 1989 , speckle interferometry was used to measure a dimension that varied between 498 and 548 km during the rotational period . In 1991 , an occultation of the star SAO <unk> by Vesta was observed from multiple locations in the eastern United States and Canada . Based on observations from 14 different sites , the best fit to the data was an elliptical profile with dimensions of about 550 km × 462 km . Dawn confirmed this measurement . 
 Vesta became the first asteroid to have its mass determined . Every 18 years , the asteroid 197 Arete approaches within 0 @.@ 04 AU of Vesta . In 1966 , based upon observations of Vesta 's gravitational perturbations of Arete , Hans G. Hertz estimated the mass of Vesta as ( 1 @.@ 20 ± 0 @.@ 08 ) × 10 − 10 solar masses . More refined estimates followed , and in 2001 the perturbations of 17 Thetis were used to estimate the mass of Vesta as ( 1 @.@ 31 ± 0 @.@ 02 ) × 10 − 10 solar masses . 
 = = Orbit = = 
 Vesta orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter , within the asteroid belt , with a period of 3 @.@ 6 Earth years , specifically in the inner asteroid belt , interior to the Kirkwood gap at 2 @.@ 50 AU . Its orbit is moderately inclined ( i 
 = 7 @.@ 1 ° , compared to 7 ° for Mercury and 17 ° for Pluto ) and moderately eccentric ( e = 
 0 @.@ 09 , compared to 0 @.@ 09 for Mars ) . 
 True orbital resonances between asteroids are considered unlikely ; due to their small masses relative to their large separations , such relationships should be very rare . Nevertheless , Vesta is able to capture other asteroids into temporary 1 : 1 resonant orbital relationships ( for periods up to 2 million years or more ) ; about forty objects have been identified . <unk> @-@ sized objects detected in the vicinity of Vesta by Dawn may be such quasi @-@ satellites rather than proper satellites . 
 = = Rotation = = 
 Its rotation is relatively fast for an asteroid ( 5 @.@ 342 h ) and prograde , with the north pole pointing in the direction of right ascension 20 h 32 min , declination + 48 ° ( in the constellation Cygnus ) with an uncertainty of about 10 ° . This gives an axial tilt of 29 ° . 
 = = = Coordinate systems = = = 
 There are two longitudinal coordinate systems in use for Vesta , with prime meridians separated by 150 ° . The IAU established a coordinate system in 1997 based on Hubble photos , with the prime meridian running through the center of Olbers Regio , a dark feature 200 km across . When Dawn arrived at Vesta , mission scientists found that the location of the pole assumed by the IAU was off by 10 ° , so that the IAU coordinate system drifted across the surface of Vesta at 0 @.@ 06 ° per year , and also that Olbers Regio was not discernible from up close , and so was not adequate to define the prime meridian with the precision they needed . They corrected the pole , but also established a new prime meridian 4 ° from the center of Claudia , a sharply defined crater 700 meters across , which they say results in a more logical set of mapping quadrangles . All NASA publications , including images and maps of Vesta , use the Claudian meridian , which is unacceptable to the IAU . The IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements recommended a coordinate system , correcting the pole but rotating the Claudian longitude by 150 ° to coincide with Olbers Regio . It was accepted by the IAU , though it disrupts the maps prepared by the Dawn team , which had been positioned so they would not bisect any major surface features . 
 = = Physical characteristics = = 
 Vesta is the second @-@ most @-@ massive body in the asteroid belt , though only 28 % as massive as <unk> its density is lower than that of the four terrestrial planets , but higher than that of most asteroids and all of the moons in the Solar System except Io . Vesta 's surface area is about the same as that of Pakistan ( about 800 @,@ 000 square kilometers ) . It has a differentiated interior . Vesta is only slightly larger ( 525 @.@ 4 ± 0 @.@ 2 km ) than 2 Pallas ( 512 ± 3 km ) in volume , but is about 25 % more massive . 
 Vesta 's shape is close to a gravitationally relaxed oblate spheroid , but the large concavity and protrusion at the southern pole ( see ' Surface features ' below ) combined with a mass less than 5 × 1020 kg precluded Vesta from automatically being considered a dwarf planet under International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) Resolution XXVI 5 . A 2012 analysis of Vesta 's shape and gravity field using data gathered by the Dawn spacecraft has shown that Vesta is currently not in hydrostatic equilibrium . 
 Temperatures on the surface have been estimated to lie between about − 20 ° C with the Sun overhead , dropping to about − 190 ° C at the winter pole . Typical daytime and nighttime temperatures are − 60 ° C and − 130 ° C respectively . This estimate is for 6 May 1996 , very close to perihelion , although details vary somewhat with the seasons . 
 = = Surface features = = 
 Prior to the arrival of the Dawn spacecraft , some Vestan surface features had already been resolved using the Hubble Space Telescope and ground @-@ based telescopes ( e.g. the Keck Observatory ) . The arrival of Dawn in July 2011 revealed the complex surface of Vesta in detail . 
 = = = Rheasilvia and Veneneia craters = = = 
 The most prominent of these surface features are two enormous craters , the 500 @-@ kilometre ( 310 mi ) -wide Rheasilvia crater , centered near the south pole , and the 400 kilometres ( 250 mi ) wide Veneneia crater . The Rheasilvia crater is younger and overlies the Veneneia crater . The Dawn science team named the younger , more prominent crater Rheasilvia , after the mother of Romulus and Remus and a mythical vestal virgin . Its width is 95 % of the mean diameter of Vesta . The crater is about 19 kilometres ( 12 mi ) deep . A central peak rises 23 km above the lowest measured part of the crater floor and the highest measured part of the crater rim is 31 km above the crater floor low point . It is estimated that the impact responsible excavated about 1 % of the volume of Vesta , and it is likely that the Vesta family and V @-@ type asteroids are the products of this collision . If this is the case , then the fact that 10 @-@ km fragments have survived bombardment until the present indicates that the crater is at most only about 1 billion years old . It would also be the site of origin of the HED meteorites . All the known V @-@ type asteroids taken together account for only about 6 % of the ejected volume , with the rest presumably either in small fragments , ejected by approaching the 3 : 1 Kirkwood gap , or perturbed away by the <unk> effect or radiation pressure . Spectroscopic analyses of the Hubble images have shown that this crater has penetrated deep through several distinct layers of the crust , and possibly into the mantle , as indicated by spectral signatures of olivine . 
 The large peak at the center of Rheasilvia is 20 to 25 kilometres ( 12 – 16 mi ) high and 180 kilometres ( 110 mi ) wide . 
 = = = Other craters = = = 
 Several old , degraded craters rival Rheasilvia and Veneneia in size , though none are quite so large . They include <unk> Planitia , shown at right , which is 270 km across . More @-@ recent , sharper craters range up to 158 kilometres ( 98 mi ) <unk> and 196 kilometres ( 122 mi ) <unk> . 
 = = = = " Snowman craters " = = = = 
 The " snowman craters " is an informal name given to a group of three adjacent craters in Vesta 's northern hemisphere . Their official names from largest to smallest ( west to east ) are Marcia , Calpurnia , and <unk> . Marcia is the youngest and cross @-@ cuts Calpurnia . <unk> is the oldest . 
 = = = Troughs = = = 
 The majority of the equatorial region of Vesta is sculpted by a series of concentric troughs . The largest is named <unk> Fossa ( 10 – 20 km wide , 465 km long ) . Despite the fact that Vesta is a one @-@ seventh the size of the Moon , <unk> Fossa dwarfs the Grand Canyon . A second series , inclined to the equator , is found further north . The largest of the northern troughs is named Saturnalia Fossa ( ≈ 40 km wide , > 370 km long ) . These troughs are thought to be large @-@ scale graben resulting from the impacts that created Rheasilvia and Veneneia craters , respectively . They are some of the longest chasms in the Solar System , nearly as long as Ithaca Chasma on Tethys . The troughs may be graben that formed after another asteroid collided with Vesta , a process that can happen only in a body that , like Vesta , is differentiated . Vesta 's differentiation is one of the reasons why scientists consider it a protoplanet . 
 = = = Surface composition = = = 
 Compositional information from the visible and infrared spectrometer ( <unk> ) , gamma @-@ ray and neutron detector ( <unk> ) , and framing camera ( FC ) , all indicate that the majority of the surface composition of Vesta is consistent with the composition of the <unk> , eucrite , and diogenite meteorites . The Rheasilvia region is richest in diogenite , consistent with the Rheasilvia @-@ forming impact excavating material from deeper within Vesta . The presence of olivine within the Rheasilvia region would also be consistent with excavation of mantle material . However , olivine has only been detected in localized regions of the northern hemisphere , not within Rheasilvia . The origin of this olivine is currently uncertain . 
 = = = Features associated with volatiles = = = 
 Pitted terrain has been observed in four craters on Vesta : Marcia , Cornelia , <unk> and <unk> . The formation of the pitted terrain is proposed to be degassing of impact @-@ heated volatile @-@ bearing material . Along with the pitted terrain , curvilinear gullies are found in Marcia and Cornelia craters . The curvilinear gullies end in lobate deposits , which are sometimes covered by pitted terrain , and are proposed to form by the transient flow of liquid water after buried deposits of ice were melted by the heat of the impacts . Hydrated materials have also been detected , many of which are associated with areas of dark material . Consequently , dark material is thought to be largely composed of carbonaceous chondrite , which was deposited on the surface by impacts . Carbonaceous chondrites are comparatively rich in <unk> bound OH . 
 = = Geology = = 
 There is a large collection of potential samples from Vesta accessible to scientists , in the form of over 1200 HED meteorites ( Vestan <unk> ) , giving insight into Vesta 's geologic history and structure . NASA Infrared Telescope Facility ( NASA <unk> ) studies of asteroid ( <unk> ) 1999 <unk> suggest that it originated from deeper within Vesta than the HED meteorites 
 Vesta is thought to consist of a metallic iron – nickel core 214 – 226 km in diameter , an overlying rocky olivine mantle , with a surface crust . From the first appearance of calcium – aluminium @-@ rich inclusions ( the first solid matter in the Solar System , forming about 4 @.@ 567 billion years ago ) , a likely time line is as follows : 
 Vesta is the only known intact asteroid that has been resurfaced in this manner . Because of this , some scientists refer to Vesta as a protoplanet . However , the presence of iron meteorites and <unk> meteorite classes without identified parent bodies indicates that there once were other differentiated planetesimals with igneous histories , which have since been shattered by impacts . 
 On the basis of the sizes of V @-@ type asteroids ( thought to be pieces of Vesta 's crust ejected during large impacts ) , and the depth of Rheasilvia crater ( see below ) , the crust is thought to be roughly 10 kilometres ( 6 mi ) thick . Findings from the Dawn spacecraft have found evidence that the troughs that wrap around Vesta could be graben formed by impact @-@ induced faulting ( see Troughs section above ) , meaning that Vesta has more complex geology than other asteroids . Vesta could have been classified as a dwarf planet if it had retained a spherical shape , and it has other qualities that lead to the thought it could be a protoplanet . The only thing that knocked it out of the category of a dwarf planet was the formation of two large impact basins at its southern pole . At the time of these impacts Vesta was not warm and plastic enough to return to a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Vesta 's surface is covered by regolith distinct from that found on the Moon or asteroids such as Itokawa . This is because space weathering acts differently . Vesta 's surface shows no significant trace of <unk> iron because the impact speeds on Vesta are too low to make rock melting and vaporization an appreciable process . Instead , regolith evolution is dominated by <unk> and subsequent mixing of bright and dark components . The dark component is probably due to the infall of carbonaceous material , whereas the bright component is the original Vesta basaltic soil . 
 = = Fragments = = 
 Some small Solar System bodies are suspected to be fragments of Vesta caused by impacts . The <unk> asteroids and HED meteorites are examples . The V @-@ type asteroid 1929 Kollaa has been determined to have a composition akin to cumulate eucrite meteorites , indicating its origin deep within Vesta 's crust . 
 Vesta is currently one of only six identified Solar System bodies of which we have physical samples , coming from a number of meteorites suspected to be Vestan fragments . It is estimated that 1 out of 16 meteorites originated from Vesta . The other identified Solar System samples are from Earth itself , meteorites from Mars , and samples returned from the Moon , the comet Wild 2 , and the asteroid <unk> Itokawa . 
 = = Exploration = = 
 In 1981 , a proposal for an asteroid mission was submitted to the European Space Agency ( ESA ) . Named the <unk> Gravity Optical and Radar Analysis ( AGORA ) , this spacecraft was to launch some time in 1990 – 1994 and perform two flybys of large asteroids . The preferred target for this mission was Vesta . AGORA would reach the asteroid belt either by a gravitational slingshot trajectory past Mars or by means of a small ion engine . However , the proposal was refused by the ESA . A joint NASA – ESA asteroid mission was then drawn up for a Multiple Asteroid Orbiter with Solar Electric Propulsion ( <unk> ) , with one of the mission profiles including an orbit of Vesta . NASA indicated they were not interested in an asteroid mission . Instead , the ESA set up a technological study of a spacecraft with an ion drive . Other missions to the asteroid belt were proposed in the 1980s by France , Germany , Italy and the United States , but none were approved . Exploration of Vesta by fly @-@ by and impacting penetrator was the second main target of the first plan of the multi @-@ aimed Soviet Vesta mission , developed in cooperation with European countries for realisation in 1991 – 1994 but canceled due to the Soviet Union disbanding . 
 In the early 1990s , NASA initiated the Discovery Program , which was intended to be a series of low @-@ cost scientific missions . In 1996 , the program 's study team recommended a mission to explore the asteroid belt using a spacecraft with an ion engine as a high priority . Funding for this program remained problematic for several years , but by 2004 the Dawn vehicle had passed its critical design review and construction proceeded . 
 It launched on 27 September 2007 as the first space mission to Vesta . On 3 May 2011 , Dawn acquired its first targeting image 1 @.@ 2 million kilometers from Vesta . On 16 July 2011 , NASA confirmed that it received telemetry from Dawn indicating that the spacecraft successfully entered Vesta 's orbit . It was scheduled to orbit Vesta for one year , until July 2012 . Dawn 's arrival coincided with late summer in the southern hemisphere of Vesta , with the large crater at Vesta 's south pole ( Rheasilvia ) in sunlight . Because a season on Vesta lasts eleven months , the northern hemisphere , including anticipated compression fractures opposite the crater , would become visible to Dawn 's cameras before it left orbit . Dawn left orbit around Vesta on 4 September 2012 11 : 26 p.m. PDT to travel to Ceres . 
 NASA / DLR released imagery and summary information from a survey orbit , two high @-@ altitude orbits ( 60 – 70 m / pixel ) and a low @-@ altitude mapping orbit ( 20 m / pixel ) , including digital terrain models , videos and atlases . Scientists also used Dawn to calculate Vesta 's precise mass and gravity field . The subsequent determination of the J2 component yielded a core diameter estimate of about 220 km assuming a crustal density similar to that of the HED .

 Its size and unusually bright surface make Vesta the brightest asteroid , and it is occasionally visible to the naked eye from dark skies ( without light pollution ) .

 Sergei Sergeyevich Prokofiev ( / <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> / ; Russian : <unk> <unk> <unk> , tr . Sergej <unk> <unk> ; 23 April 1891 – 5 March 1953 ) was a Russian and Soviet composer , pianist and conductor . As the creator of acknowledged masterpieces across numerous musical genres , he is regarded as one of the major composers of the 20th century . His works include such widely heard works as the March from The Love for Three Oranges , the suite Lieutenant Kijé , the ballet Romeo and Juliet – from which " Dance of the Knights " is taken – and Peter and the Wolf . Of the established forms and genres in which he worked , he created – excluding juvenilia – seven completed operas , seven symphonies , eight ballets , five piano concertos , two violin concertos , a cello concerto , a Symphony @-@ Concerto for cello and orchestra , and nine completed piano sonatas . 
 A graduate of the St Petersburg Conservatory , Prokofiev initially made his name as an iconoclastic composer @-@ pianist , achieving notoriety with a series of ferociously dissonant and virtuosic works for his instrument , including his first two piano concertos . In 1915 Prokofiev made a decisive break from the standard composer @-@ pianist category with his orchestral Scythian Suite , compiled from music originally composed for a ballet commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev of the Ballets Russes . Diaghilev commissioned three further ballets from Prokofiev – Chout , Le pas d 'acier and The Prodigal Son – which at the time of their original production all caused a sensation among both critics and colleagues . Prokofiev 's greatest interest , however , was opera , and he composed several works in that genre , including The Gambler and The Fiery Angel . Prokofiev 's one operatic success during his lifetime was The Love for Three Oranges , composed for the Chicago Opera and subsequently performed over the following decade in Europe and Russia . 
 After the Revolution , Prokofiev left Russia with the official blessing of the Soviet minister Anatoly <unk> , and resided in the United States , then Germany , then Paris , making his living as a composer , pianist and conductor . During that time he married a Spanish singer , Carolina Codina , with whom he had two sons . In the early 1930s , the Great Depression diminished opportunities for Prokofiev 's ballets and operas to be staged in America and western Europe . Prokofiev , who regarded himself as composer foremost , resented the time taken by touring as a pianist , and increasingly turned to Soviet Russia for commissions of new music ; in 1936 he finally returned to his homeland with his family . He enjoyed some success there – notably with Lieutenant Kijé , Peter and the Wolf , Romeo and Juliet , and perhaps above all with Alexander Nevsky . 
 The Nazi invasion of the USSR spurred him to compose his most ambitious work , an operatic version of Leo Tolstoy 's War and Peace . In 1948 Prokofiev was criticized for " anti @-@ democratic formalism " and , with his income severely curtailed , was forced to compose Stalinist works , such as On Guard for Peace . However , he also enjoyed personal and artistic support from a new generation of Russian performers , notably Sviatoslav Richter and Mstislav Rostropovich : for the latter , he composed his Symphony @-@ Concerto , whilst for the former he composed his ninth piano sonata .

 Prokofiev was born in 1891 in Sontsovka ( now Krasne , <unk> Raion , Donetsk Oblast , eastern Ukraine ) , a remote rural estate in the Yekaterinoslav Governorate of the Russian Empire . His father , Sergei Alexeyevich Prokofiev , was an agronomist . Prokofiev 's mother , Maria ( née <unk> ) , came from a family of former serfs who had been owned by the Sheremetev family , under whose patronage serf @-@ children were taught theatre and arts from an early age . She was described by Reinhold Glière ( Prokofiev 's first composition teacher ) as " a tall woman with beautiful , clever eyes ... who knew how to create an atmosphere of warmth and simplicity about her . " After their wedding in the summer of 1877 , the <unk> had moved to a small estate in the Smolensk governorate . Eventually Sergei Alexeyevich found employment as a soil engineer , employed by one of his former fellow @-@ students , Dmitri <unk> , to whose estate in the Ukrainian steppes the <unk> moved . 
 By the time of Prokofiev 's birth Maria , having previously lost two daughters , had devoted her life to music ; during her son 's early childhood she spent two months a year in Moscow or St Petersburg taking piano lessons . Sergei Prokofiev was inspired by hearing his mother practicing the piano in the evenings – mostly works by Chopin and Beethoven – and composed his first piano composition at the age of five , an ' Indian Gallop ' , which was written down by his mother : this was in the F Lydian mode ( a major scale with a raised 4th scale degree ) as the young Prokofiev felt ' reluctance to tackle the black notes ' . By seven , he had also learned to play chess . Much like music , chess would remain a passion , and he became acquainted with world chess champions José Raúl Capablanca , whom he beat in a simultaneous exhibition match in 1914 , and Mikhail Botvinnik , with whom he played several matches in the 1930s . At the age of nine he was composing his first opera , The Giant , as well as an overture and various other pieces .

 In 1902 , Prokofiev 's mother met Sergei Taneyev , director of the Moscow Conservatory , who initially suggested that Prokofiev should start lessons in piano and composition with Alexander <unk> . When Taneyev was unable to arrange this , he instead organised that composer and pianist Reinhold Glière should spend the summer of 1902 in Sontsovka teaching Prokofiev . This first series of lessons culminated , at the 11 @-@ year @-@ old Prokofiev 's insistence , with the budding composer making his first attempt to write a symphony . The following summer Glière revisited Sontsovka to give further tuition . When decades later Prokofiev wrote about his lessons with Glière , he gave due credit to his teacher 's sympathetic method but complained that Glière had introduced him to " square " phrase structure and conventional modulations which he subsequently had to unlearn . Nonetheless , equipped with the necessary theoretical tools , Prokofiev started experimenting with dissonant harmonies and unusual time signatures in a series of short piano pieces which he called " ditties " ( after the so @-@ called " song form " – more accurately ternary form – they were based on ) , laying the basis for his own musical style . 
 Despite his growing talent , Prokofiev 's parents hesitated over starting their son on a musical career at such an early age , and considered the possibility of his attending a quality high school in Moscow . By 1904 , his mother had decided instead on Saint Petersburg , and she and Prokofiev visited the ( then ) capital to explore the possibility of their moving there for his education . They were introduced to composer Alexander Glazunov , a professor at the Conservatory , who asked to see Prokofiev and his music ; Glazunov was so impressed that he urged Prokofiev 's mother that her son apply to the Saint Petersburg Conservatory . By this point , Prokofiev had composed two more operas , Desert Islands and The Feast during the Plague , and was working on his fourth , <unk> . He passed the introductory tests and entered the Conservatory that same year . 
 Several years younger than most of his class , he was viewed as eccentric and arrogant , and he annoyed a number of his classmates by keeping statistics on the errors made by fellow students . During this period , he studied under , among others , Alexander Winkler for piano , Anatoly Lyadov for harmony and counterpoint , Nikolai Tcherepnin for conducting , and Nikolai Rimsky @-@ Korsakov for orchestration ( though when Rimsky @-@ Korsakov died in 1908 , Prokofiev noted that he had only studied with him " after a fashion " – he was just one of many students in a heavily attended class — and regretted that he otherwise " never had the opportunity to study with him " ) . He also shared classes with the composers Boris <unk> and Nikolai Myaskovsky , the latter becoming a relatively close and lifelong friend . 
 As a member of the Saint Petersburg music scene , Prokofiev developed a reputation as a musical rebel , while getting praise for his original compositions , which he performed himself on the piano . In 1909 , he graduated from his class in composition with unimpressive marks . He continued at the Conservatory , studying piano under Anna <unk> and continuing his conducting lessons under Tcherepnin . 
 In 1910 , Prokofiev 's father died and Sergei 's financial support ceased . Fortunately he had started making a name for himself as a composer and pianist outside the Conservatory , making appearances at the St Petersburg Evenings of Contemporary Music . There he performed several of his more adventurous piano works , such as his highly chromatic and dissonant Etudes , Op. 2 ( 1909 ) . His performance of this impressed the organizers of Evenings sufficiently for them to invite Prokofiev to give the Russian premiere of Arnold Schoenberg 's Drei Klavierstücke , Op. 11 . Prokofiev 's harmonic experimentation continued with <unk> for piano , Op. 17 ( 1912 ) , which makes extensive use of polytonality . He composed his first two piano concertos around this time , the latter of which caused a scandal at its premiere ( 23 August 1913 , Pavlovsk ) . According to one account , the audience left the hall with exclamations of " ' To hell with this futuristic music ! The cats on the roof make better music ! ' " , but the modernists were in rapture . 
 In 1911 , help arrived from renowned Russian musicologist and critic Alexander Ossovsky , who wrote a supportive letter to music publisher Boris P. Jurgenson ( son of publishing @-@ firm founder Peter Jurgenson [ 1836 – 1904 ] ) ; thus a contract was offered to the composer . Prokofiev made his first foreign trip in 1913 , travelling to Paris and London where he first encountered Sergei Diaghilev 's Ballets Russes . 
 = = = The first ballets = = = 
 In 1914 , Prokofiev finished his career at the Conservatory by entering the so @-@ called ' battle of the pianos ' , a competition open to the five best piano students for which the prize was a <unk> grand piano : Prokofiev won by performing his own Piano Concerto No. 1 . Soon afterwards , he journeyed to London where he made contact with the impresario Sergei Diaghilev . Diaghilev commissioned Prokofiev 's first ballet , Ala and Lolli ; but when Prokofiev brought the work in progress to him in Italy in 1915 he rejected it as " non @-@ Russian " . Urging Prokofiev to write " music that was national in character " , Diaghilev then commissioned the ballet Chout ( The Fool , the original Russian @-@ language full title was <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ( <unk> pro <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , meaning " The Tale of the <unk> who <unk> Seven Other <unk> " ) . Under Diaghilev 's guidance , Prokofiev chose his subject from a collection of folktales by the ethnographer Alexander Afanasyev ; the story , concerning a buffoon and a series of confidence tricks , had been previously suggested to Diaghilev by Igor Stravinsky as a possible subject for a ballet , and Diaghilev and his choreographer Léonide Massine helped Prokofiev to shape this into a ballet scenario . Prokofiev 's inexperience with ballet led him to revise the work extensively in the 1920s , following Diaghilev 's detailed critique , prior to its first production . The ballet 's premiere in Paris on 17 May 1921 was a huge success and was greeted with great admiration by an audience that included Jean Cocteau , Igor Stravinsky and Maurice Ravel . Stravinsky called the ballet " the single piece of modern music he could listen to with pleasure , " while Ravel called it " a work of genius . " 
 = = = First World War and Revolution = = = 
 During World War I , Prokofiev returned to the Conservatory and studied organ in order to avoid conscription . He composed The Gambler based on Fyodor Dostoyevsky 's novel of the same name , but rehearsals were plagued by problems and the scheduled 1917 première had to be canceled because of the February Revolution . In the summer of that year , Prokofiev composed his first symphony , the Classical . This was his own name for the symphony , which was written in the style that , according to Prokofiev , Joseph Haydn would have used if he had been alive at the time . It is more or less Classical in style but incorporates more modern musical elements ( see Neoclassicism ) . This symphony was also an exact contemporary of Prokofiev 's Violin Concerto No. 1 in D major , Op. 19 , which was scheduled to premiere in November 1917 . The first performances of both works had to wait until 21 April 1918 and 18 October 1923 , respectively . He stayed briefly with his mother in <unk> in the Caucasus . After completing the score of Seven , They Are Seven , a " Chaldean invocation " for chorus and orchestra , Prokofiev was " left with nothing to do and time hung heavily on my hands " . Believing that Russia " had no use for music at the moment " , Prokofiev decided to try his fortunes in America until the turmoil in his homeland had passed . He set out for Moscow and Petersburg in March 1918 to sort out financial matters and to arrange for his passport . In May he headed for the USA , having obtained official permission to do so from Anatoly <unk> , the People 's Commissar for Education , who told him : " You are a revolutionary in music , we are revolutionaries in life . We ought to work together . But if you want to go to America I shall not stand in your way . " 
 = = = Life abroad = = = 
 Arriving in San Francisco after having been released from questioning by immigration officials on Angel Island on 11 August 1918 , Prokofiev was soon compared to other famous Russian exiles ( such as Sergei Rachmaninoff ) . His debut solo concert in New York led to several further engagements . He also received a contract from the music director of the Chicago Opera Association , <unk> <unk> , for the production of his new opera The Love for Three Oranges ; however , due to <unk> 's illness and death , the premiere was postponed . This delay was another example of Prokofiev 's bad luck in operatic matters . The failure also cost him his American solo career , since the opera took too much time and effort . He soon found himself in financial difficulties , and , in April 1920 , he left for Paris , not wanting to return to Russia as a failure . 
 In Paris Prokofiev reaffirmed his contacts with Diaghilev 's Ballets Russes . He also completed some of his older , unfinished works , such as the Third Piano Concerto . The Love for Three Oranges finally premièred in Chicago , under the composer 's baton , on 30 December 1921 . Diaghilev became sufficiently interested in the opera to request Prokofiev play the vocal score to him in June 1922 , while they were both in Paris for a revival of Chout , so he could consider it for a possible production . Stravinsky , who was present at the audition , refused to listen to more than the first act . When he then accused Prokofiev of " wasting time composing operas " , Prokofiev retorted that Stravinsky " was in no position to lay down a general artistic direction , since he is himself not immune to error " . According to Prokofiev , Stravinsky " became incandescent with rage " and " we almost came to blows and were separated only with difficulty " . As a result , " our relations became strained and for several years Stravinsky 's attitude toward me was critical . " 
 In March 1922 , Prokofiev moved with his mother to the town of Ettal in the Bavarian Alps , where for over a year he concentrated on an opera project , The Fiery Angel , based on the novel by Valery Bryusov . By this time his later music had acquired a following in Russia , and he received invitations to return there , but he decided to stay in Europe . In 1923 , Prokofiev married the Spanish singer Carolina Codina ( 1897 – 1989 , whose stage name was Lina <unk> ) before moving back to Paris . 
 In Paris , several of his works ( for example the Second Symphony ) were performed , but the audiences ' reception was now lukewarm and Prokofiev sensed that he " was evidently no longer a sensation " . However the Symphony appeared to prompt Diaghilev to commission Le pas d 'acier ( The Steel Step ) , a ' modernist ' ballet score intended to portray the industrialisation of the Soviet Union . It was enthusiastically received by Parisian audiences and critics . 
 In around 1924 , Prokofiev was introduced to Christian Science . He began to practice its teachings , which he believed to be beneficial to his health and to his fiery temperament , and to which , according to biographer Simon Morrison , he remained faithful for the rest of his life . 
 Prokofiev and Stravinsky restored their friendship , though Prokofiev particularly disliked Stravinsky 's " stylization of Bach " in such recent works as the Octet and the Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments . However , Stravinsky himself described Prokofiev as the greatest Russian composer of his day , after himself . 
 = = = First visits to the Soviet Union = = = 
 In 1927 , Prokofiev made his first concert tour in the Soviet Union . Over the course of more than two months , he spent time in Moscow and Leningrad ( as Saint Petersburg had been renamed ) , where he enjoyed a very successful staging of The Love for Three Oranges in the Mariinsky Theatre . In 1928 , Prokofiev completed his Third Symphony , which was broadly based on his unperformed opera The Fiery Angel . The conductor Serge Koussevitzky characterized the Third as " the greatest symphony since Tchaikovsky 's Sixth . " 
 In the meantime , however , Prokofiev , under the influence of the teachings of Christian Science , had turned against the expressionist style and the subject matter of The Fiery Angel . He now preferred what he called a " new simplicity " , which he believed more sincere than the " contrivances and complexities " of so much modern music of the 1920s . During 1928 – 29 , Prokofiev composed what was to be the last ballet for Diaghilev , The Prodigal Son . When first staged in Paris on 21 May 1929 , with Serge <unk> in the title role , both audience and critics were particularly struck by the final scene in which the prodigal son drags himself across the stage upon his knees to be welcomed by his father . Diaghilev had recognised that in the music to this scene , Prokofiev had " never been more clear , more simple , more melodious , and more tender . " Only months later , Diaghilev was dead . 
 That summer , Prokofiev completed the <unk> , Op. 43 ( which he had started in 1925 ) and revised his Sinfonietta , Op. 5 / 48 , a work started in his days at the Conservatory . In October that year , he had a car crash while driving his family back to Paris from their holiday : as the car turned over , Prokofiev pulled some muscles on his left hand . Prokofiev was therefore unable to perform in Moscow during his tour shortly after the accident , but he was able to enjoy watching performances of his music from the audience . Prokofiev also attended the Bolshoi Theatre 's " audition " of his ballet Le pas d 'acier , and was interrogated by members of the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians ( RAPM ) about the work : he was asked whether the factory portrayed " a capitalist factory , where the worker is a slave , or a Soviet factory , where the worker is the master ? If it is a Soviet factory , when and where did Prokofiev examine it , since from 1918 to the present he has been living abroad and came here for the first time in 1927 for two weeks [ sic ] ? " Prokofiev replied , " That concerns politics , not music , and therefore I won 't answer . " The RAPM condemned the ballet as a " flat and vulgar anti @-@ Soviet anecdote , a counter @-@ revolutionary composition bordering on Fascism " . The Bolshoi had no option but to reject the ballet . 
 With his left hand healed , Prokofiev toured the United States successfully at the start of 1930 , propped up by his recent European success . That year Prokofiev began his first non @-@ Diaghilev ballet On the Dnieper , Op. 51 , a work commissioned by Serge <unk> , who had been appointed <unk> de ballet at the Paris Opéra . In 1931 and 1932 , he completed his fourth and fifth piano concertos . The following year saw the completion of the Symphonic Song , Op. 57 , which Prokofiev 's friend Myaskovsky – thinking of its potential audience in the Soviet Union – told him " isn 't quite for us ... it lacks that which we mean by <unk> – a familiar simplicity and broad contours , of which you are extremely capable , but temporarily are carefully avoiding . " 
 By the early 1930s , both Europe and America were suffering from the Great Depression , which inhibited both new opera and ballet productions , though audiences for Prokofiev 's appearances as a pianist were — in Europe at least — undiminished . However Prokofiev , who saw himself as a composer first and foremost , increasingly resented the amount of time that was lost to composition through his appearances as a pianist . Having been homesick for some time , Prokofiev began to build substantial bridges with the Soviet Union . Following the dissolution of the RAPM in 1932 , he acted increasingly as a musical ambassador between his homeland and western Europe , and his premieres and commissions were increasingly under the auspices of the Soviet Union . One such was Lieutenant Kijé , which was commissioned as the score to a Soviet film . Another commission , from the Kirov Theatre ( as the Mariinsky had now been renamed ) in Leningrad , was the ballet Romeo and Juliet , composed to a scenario created by Adrian Piotrovsky and Sergei <unk> following the precepts of " <unk> " ( dramatised ballet , officially promoted at the Kirov to replace works based primarily on choreographic display and innovation ) . Following <unk> 's acrimonious resignation from the Kirov in June 1934 , a new agreement was signed with the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow on the understanding that Piotrovsky would remain involved . However , the ballet 's original happy ending ( contrary to Shakespeare ) provoked controversy among Soviet cultural officials ; the ballet 's production was then postponed indefinitely when the staff of the Bolshoi was overhauled at the behest of the chairman of the Committee on Arts Affairs , Platon <unk> . Nikolai Myaskovsky , one of his closest friends , mentioned in a number of letters how he would like Prokofiev to stay in Russia . 
 = = = Return to Russia = = = 
 In 1936 , Prokofiev and his family settled permanently in Moscow . In that year he composed one of his most famous works , Peter and the Wolf , for Natalya <unk> 's Central Children 's Theatre . <unk> also persuaded Prokofiev to write two songs for children – " Sweet Song " , and " Chatterbox " ; these were eventually joined by " The Little Pigs " , published as Three Children 's Songs , Op. 68 . Prokofiev also composed the gigantic Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution , originally intended for performance during the anniversary year but effectively blocked by <unk> , who demanded at the work 's audition before the Committee on Arts Affairs , " Just what do you think you 're doing , Sergey Sergeyevich , taking texts that belong to the people and setting them to such incomprehensible music ? " The Cantata had to wait until 5 April 1966 for a partial premiere ( just over 13 years after the composer 's death ) . 
 Forced to adapt to the new circumstances ( whatever misgivings he had about them in private ) , Prokofiev wrote a series of " mass songs " ( Opp . 66 , 79 , 89 ) , using the lyrics of officially approved Soviet poets . In 1938 , Prokofiev collaborated with Eisenstein on the historical epic Alexander Nevsky . For this he composed some of his most inventive and dramatic music . Although the film had a very poor sound recording , Prokofiev adapted much of his score into a large @-@ scale cantata for mezzo @-@ soprano , orchestra and chorus , which was extensively performed and recorded . In the wake of Alexander Nevsky 's success , Prokofiev composed his first Soviet opera Semyon <unk> , which was intended to be produced by the director Vsevolod Meyerhold . However the première of the opera was postponed because Meyerhold was arrested on 20 June 1939 by the NKVD ( Joseph Stalin 's Secret Police ) , and shot on 2 February 1940 . Only months after Meyerhold 's arrest , Prokofiev was ' invited ' to compose <unk> ( literally translated ' Cheers ! ' , but more often given the English title Hail to Stalin ) ( Op. 85 ) to celebrate Joseph Stalin 's 60th birthday . 
 Later in 1939 , Prokofiev composed his Piano Sonatas Nos. 6 , 7 , and 8 , Opp . 82 – 84 , widely known today as the " War Sonatas . " Premiered respectively by Prokofiev ( No. 6 : 8 April 1940 ) , Sviatoslav Richter ( No. 7 : Moscow , 18 January 1943 ) and Emil Gilels ( No. 8 : Moscow , 30 December 1944 ) , they were subsequently championed in particular by Richter . Biographer Daniel Jaffé argued that Prokofiev , " having forced himself to compose a cheerful evocation of the nirvana Stalin wanted everyone to believe he had created " ( i.e. in <unk> ) then subsequently , in these three sonatas , " expressed his true feelings " . As evidence of this , Jaffé has pointed out that the central movement of Sonata No. 7 opens with a theme based on a Robert Schumann lied , ' <unk> ' ( ' Sadness ' , which appears in Schumann 's <unk> , Op. 39 ) : the words to this translate " I can sometimes sing as if I were glad , yet secretly tears well and so free my heart . Nightingales ... sing their song of longing from their dungeon 's depth ... everyone delights , yet no one feels the pain , the deep sorrow in the song . " Ironically ( because , it appears , no one had noticed his allusion ) Sonata No. 7 received a Stalin Prize ( Second Class ) , and No. 8 a Stalin Prize First Class . 
 In the meantime , Romeo and Juliet was finally staged by the Kirov ballet , choreographed by Leonid <unk> , on 11 January 1940 . To the surprise of all its participants , the dancers having struggled to cope with the music 's syncopated rhythms and almost having boycotted the production , the ballet was an instant success , and became recognised as the crowning achievement of Soviet dramatic ballet .
