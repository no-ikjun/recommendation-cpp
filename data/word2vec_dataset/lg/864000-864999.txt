 Kepler @-@ 40 , formerly known as KOI @-@ 428 , is an F @-@ type star in the constellation Cygnus . Kepler @-@ 40 is known to host at least one planet , Kepler @-@ 40b . The star is approximately 1 @.@ 5 times more massive than the Sun , and is over two times its size ; it was , at upon its discovery , the largest yet discovered with a transiting planet in its orbit . Kepler @-@ 40 was first noted as home to a possible transiting object by the Kepler spacecraft ; the data on the system was released to the public . A team of French and Swiss scientists used follow @-@ up data to determine the existence of the Hot Jupiter planet Kepler @-@ 40b , and later had their results published in a scientific journal on January 4 , 2011 .

 Kepler @-@ 40 was first targeted by the Kepler spacecraft , an Earth @-@ trailing NASA operation that searches for planets that transit , or cross in front of , their host stars . It was labeled a Kepler Object of Interest ( KOI ) during the satellite 's first 33 @.@ 5 days of operations , which stretched from mid @-@ May to mid @-@ June 2009 , because of the detection of a potential transit event . The data collected by Kepler 's photometer was publicly released , including data on Kepler @-@ 40 and its possible transiting companion . 
 Data on Kepler @-@ 40 was analyzed by a team of French and Swiss astronomers , who first tested for false positives . When all obvious false positives were cleared , the science team used the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph at the Haute @-@ Provence Observatory in southern France to gather radial velocity measurements on the star . Collected data was then checked to see if it corresponded with that of a closely orbiting binary star or that of a planet ; it was found to be that of a planet , leading to the confirmation of Kepler @-@ 40b . 
 After Kepler @-@ 40b was confirmed , the French and Swiss science team worked to clarify the stellar parameters its star by analyzing the star 's spectrum as collected by SOPHIE . Kepler @-@ 40 is the sixth known planetary host star with a radius of more than 1 @.@ 8 times that of the Sun . At the time of its discovery , Kepler @-@ 40 was the most evolved star known to have a transiting planet . 
 Kepler @-@ 40 and its exoplanet were published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics on January 4 , 2011 , after being submitted on September 15 , 2010 .

 = Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards = 
 Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is a graphic adventure game originally released in 1987 as the first part of the Leisure Suit Larry series . Originally developed for the PC DOS and the Apple II , it was later ported to other platforms such as the Amiga , Atari ST , Apple IIGS , Apple Macintosh , and the Tandy Color Computer 3 . It utilizes the Adventure Game Interpreter ( AGI ) engine made famous by King 's Quest : Quest for the Crown . 
 The game 's story follows a middle @-@ aged male virgin named Larry Laffer as he desperately tries to " get lucky " in the fictional American city of Lost Wages . Land of the Lounge Lizards establishes several elements which recur in the later Larry games , including Larry 's campy attire , perpetual bad luck with women , and penchant for double @-@ entendres . The story and basic structure of the game are lifted from Softporn Adventure , a 1981 Apple II text adventure . 
 Despite a lack of advertising , the game was a sleeper hit and a commercial and critical success . Sierra developed and published a remake that used the Sierra 's Creative Interpreter ( SCI ) engine with 256 colors and a point @-@ and @-@ click , icon @-@ driven ( as opposed to text @-@ based ) user interface , released for the PC DOS , Apple Macintosh , and Amiga in 1991 . A second , high @-@ definition remake , titled Leisure Suit Larry : Reloaded , was developed by N @-@ Fusion Interactive working with series ' creator Al Lowe and published by Replay Games in 2013 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Larry Laffer is a 38 @-@ year @-@ old ( 40 @-@ year @-@ old in the 1991 remake ) " loser " who lives in his mother 's basement and has not yet lost his virginity . Having grown weary of his lonely existence , he decides to visit the resort city of Lost Wages ( a parody of " Las Vegas " ) hoping to experience what he has not lived before , and to finally find the woman of his dreams . Larry starts with nothing but an out @-@ of @-@ style 1970s disco @-@ era leisure suit and $ 94 in his pocket . His quest involves four possible women : a nameless , seedy @-@ looking sex worker ; Fawn , a club @-@ goer of low moral fiber ; Faith , a receptionist who ( true to her name ) is faithful to her boyfriend ; and Eve , a bathing beauty and Larry 's ultimate goal . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The game begins outside a bar in Lost Wages . Players are given seven real @-@ time hours ( eight in the 1991 remake ) to complete the game , at which point a despairing Larry commits suicide , resulting in game over . Players control Larry 's movements with the directional keys and by <unk> commands into a text parser ( e.g. " talk to man " , " open window " , etc . ) . If Larry is too far away from a person or object to comply , or if the command is invalid , a caution message appears with hints on what to do . 
 The city consists of five areas : Lefty 's Bar , a hotel casino , a 24 @-@ hour wedding chapel , a discothèque , and a convenience store . The player can walk between areas that are next to each other , but other areas can only be accessed by hailing a taxi , which costs the player money ; failure to do so results in Larry 's being mugged or hit by oncoming traffic . During the early stages of the game , Larry can survive most premature deaths . In the original release , a compartment opens beneath Larry 's body and takes him to a laboratory where heroes from Sierra 's computer games — such as King 's Quest — are re @-@ assembled ; in the remake , Larry 's remains are instead thrown inside a blender and reformed . 
 A prostitute is available as soon as the game starts . Should Larry have unprotected intercourse with her , he will contract a sexually @-@ transmitted disease and die shortly thereafter . This fate may be avoided by buying a condom at the convenience store . Larry questions the validity of losing his virginity to a prostitute , but the game resumes without a time limit . 
 Larry 's interactions with key women are accompanied by a detailed image of whomever he is speaking with , unlike other non @-@ player characters . With the exception of the prostitute , each of the women shun Larry at first , but respond favorably to gifts of varying sorts . Although it is not possible to woo all of the women , giving gifts is needed to advance to the game 's final area , the hotel penthouse . To this end , money is essential to advance through the game . The only available method of augmenting Larry 's funds is to gamble in the casino , playing blackjack and slots .

 Al Lowe , a former high school teacher , had carved a niche for himself at Sierra with his work on such Disney @-@ licensed edutainment titles as Donald Duck 's Playground , Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood , and The Black Cauldron , which he wrote , designed and programmed . In 1982 , Sierra had released a text @-@ only game on the Apple II titled Softporn Adventure ( it was the only text adventure that was released by a company which had established its name on providing a graphical alternative to such games ) . In 1986 , after Sierra lost a Disney license , Al Lowe suggested that Sierra remake Softporn Adventure with the improved tools now at their disposal , and Ken Williams agreed . 
 Lowe , who considered the original Softporn Adventure " a primitive , early effort " , borrowed its basic structure and added a graphic game engine ( Adventure Game Interpreter ) , improvised humor , and an on @-@ screen protagonist , Larry Laffer . Chuck Benton , creator of Softporn Adventure , is included in the Leisure Suit Larry 's end credits , as the layout and puzzles of the game are identical to those found in the earlier title . However , Lowe said that in Softporn Adventure " there were no characters in the game . There was no central character at all . There were almost no characters to the women . And so it was a real role @-@ over . I think there 's one line of dialogue that I kept of the original game and all the rest was fresh . " 
 The game was co @-@ designed and illustrated by Mark Crowe , creator of the Space Quest series , and co @-@ programmed by Ken Williams . An accomplished jazz musician ( The Lounge Lizards being a jazz band 's name ) , Lowe also wrote the main theme music ( called " For Your Thighs Only " ) , and some of his compositions appear in later entries of the series . The theme , inspired by Irving Berlin 's 1929 song " Alexander 's Ragtime Band " , was composed within 20 minutes . Lowe said it " sounded so unusual , so different , so fresh compared to most computer game music , that I decided to write something with the same pep , simplicity , humor , and out @-@ of @-@ sync attitude . " 
 = = = Release = = = 
 Unsure of how the 1987 game would be received , Sierra 's management chose to release it with no publicity or advertising budget . Many stores also refused to stock the game because of its adult content , which was subject to controversy . In effect , its first @-@ month sales were lower than any new Sierra product launch in years . 
 Due to the adult nature of the game , the game includes an age verification system consisting of trivia questions that Al Lowe assumed children would not know the answer to . As many of the questions are <unk> , they risked frustrating non @-@ American gamers . If played today , the questions also include out @-@ of @-@ date cultural references . ( One question begins " OJ Simpson is ... " and one wrong answer is " under indictment . " ) In the original AGI version , the age verification screen may be skipped by pressing Alt @-@ X ( or in the 1991 SCI remake , by pressing <unk> @-@ Alt @-@ X ) .

 A version of the game with VGA graphics and sound card audio appeared in 1991 . Leisure Suit Larry 1 : In the Land of the Lounge Lizards used the new game engine Sierra 's Creative Interpreter and was released in 1991 for the Amiga , DOS , and Macintosh platforms . For the first remake , Al Lowe served as director and designer , also helping to program the game , and Ken Williams became executive producer . Other key people included Stuart Moulder ( producer ) , William R. Davis Sr. ( creative director ) , William D. <unk> ( art designer ) , Mark Seibert ( music director ) , Oliver Brelsford ( lead programmer ) , and the music other than the theme song was composed by Chris <unk> . 
 The suggested retail price of the 1991 version was $ 59 @.@ 95 . Sierra offered owners of the original game an upgrade to the new game for $ 25 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Larry 's sales were very poor at first , with only 4 @,@ 000 copies sold upon its release . Some resellers refused to handle the game , while others refused to advertise it , and one refused to list the game on its list of best sellers . A Sierra employee quit and a potential employee refused to work on Larry . Lowe stated , " My initial reaction was that I had wasted six months of my life . " Word @-@ of @-@ mouth spread quickly , however , and by the year 's end , the game became a commercial success , selling over 250 @,@ 000 copies . According to Sierra 's marketing director John Williams , " Obviously lots of retailers were selling lots of Leisure Suit Larry , but no one wanted to admit it " . It also became widely pirated , including in the Soviet Union . According to Lowe , a film adaptation was considered and he was flown to Hollywood to demonstrate the game in person . Footage from the game was used in the 1990 music video for Sailor 's song " The Secretary " . Sierra received what Williams described as a " deluge " of mail opposing its release of Larry after he wrote a series of articles for Computer Gaming World discussing his company and the industry 's views on adult software . The game 's success resulting in a long line of sequels and spin @-@ off titles . 
 Computer Gaming World 's reviewer Roy Wagner ( " a wholesome family man " ) stated that Larry " is a lot of fun to play and is very humorous ... with good graphics , good design , and good fun provided , who needs ' good taste ' ? " According to the review by Rob Steele of The Games Machine , the Atari ST version was entertaining and very enjoyable , even if " wholeheartedly sexist " . Jason Simmons from Amiga Action opined that the 1991 remake 's " advanced graphics and new control system have improved the game by a huge degree " , but " without a hard drive it is slow and almost a chore to play " and those who played the original " will probably find the new edition a waste of time and little more than an exercise in pretty pictures . " In 2004 , Adventure Gamers ' Rob Michaud wrote : " Despite its weaknesses , it 's a bona fide gaming classic , a must @-@ play for adventure history buffs as well as those who just like risqué humor . " 
 In 1988 , Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards was given an award for the Best Adventure , or Fantasy / Role @-@ Playing Program of 1987 by the Software Publishers Association . In 1996 , Computer Gaming World ranked it as the 69th best game of all time , also ranking it as the fifth most funny computer game , and stating : " Base , sexist , sometimes scatological humor , with no concessions made to taste or sensibilities , this was the best of a funny series . " FHM included it on its 2011 list of six games " that shamelessly used sex to sell " but adding that it was actually " funny , well @-@ crafted , and well @-@ written " and " has become kind of like a cult classic among gaming fans .

 = Centennial Light = 
 The Centennial Light is the world 's longest @-@ lasting light bulb , burning since 1901 . It is at <unk> East Avenue , Livermore , California , and maintained by the Livermore @-@ Pleasanton Fire Department . Due to its longevity , the bulb has been noted by The Guinness Book of World Records , Ripley 's Believe It or Not ! , and General Electric . It is often cited as evidence for the existence of planned obsolescence in later @-@ produced light bulbs . 
 = = History = = 
 The Centennial Light was originally a 30 @-@ watt or 60 @-@ watt bulb but now is very dim , emitting about the same light as a 4 @-@ watt nightlight . The hand @-@ blown , carbon @-@ filament common light bulb was manufactured in Shelby , Ohio , by the Shelby Electric Company in the late 1890s ; many just like it still exist and can be found functioning . According to <unk> Bernal Beck , the bulb was donated to the Fire Department by her father , Dennis Bernal , in 1901 . Bernal owned the Livermore Power and Water Company and donated the bulb to the fire station when he sold the company . That story has been supported by firefighter volunteers of that era . 
 Evidence suggests that the bulb has hung in at least four locations . It was originally hung in 1901 in a hose cart house on L Street , then moved to a garage in downtown Livermore used by the fire and police departments . When the fire department consolidated , it was moved again to a newly constructed City Hall that housed the unified departments . 
 Its unusual longevity was first noticed in 1972 by reporter Mike Dunstan . After weeks of interviewing people who had lived in Livermore all their lives , he wrote " Light Bulb May Be World 's Oldest " , published in the Tri @-@ Valley Herald . Dunstan contacted the Guinness Book of World Records , Ripley 's Believe It or Not , and General Electric , who all confirmed it as the longest @-@ lasting bulb known in existence . The article came to the attention of Charles Kuralt of the CBS @-@ TV program On the Road with Charles Kuralt . 
 In 1976 , the fire department moved to Fire Station # 6 with the bulb ; the bulb 's cord was severed for fear that <unk> it could damage it . It was deprived of electricity for only 22 minutes during the transfer , which was made in a specially designed box and with full firetruck escort . An electrician was on hand to install the bulb into the new fire station 's emergency generator . Ripley 's Believe It Or Not stated that the short delay would not mar the bulb 's continuous burning record . In 2001 , the bulb 's 100th birthday was celebrated with a community barbecue and live music . Since that move , the bulb has run continuously for 38 years ; previously it had only been off the grid for short periods of time ( e.g. a week in 1937 for a renovation and the odd power outage ) . 
 On the evening of May 20 , 2013 , the general public witnessed , through a dedicated webcam , that the bulb had apparently burned out . The next morning , an electrician was called in to confirm its status . It was determined that the bulb had not burned out when the uninterruptible power supply was bypassed , using an extension cord . The dedicated power supply was found to have been faulty . Approximately seven hours had transpired before the light was reestablished . 
 The bulb is cared for by the Centennial Light Bulb Committee , a partnership of the Livermore @-@ Pleasanton Fire Department , Livermore Heritage Guild , Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories , and Sandia National Laboratories . The Livermore @-@ Pleasanton Fire Department plans to house and maintain the bulb for the rest of its life , regardless of length . When it does go out , they have no plans for it , although Ripley 's Believe it or Not ! has requested it for their museum . The bulb 's long life has been attributed to its low power , nearly continuous operation , and dedicated power supply . 
 = = Publicity = = 
 The bulb was officially listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as " the most durable light " in 1972 , replacing another bulb in Fort Worth , Texas . The bulb was listed in the book for the next 16 editions . It was not listed during 1988 – 2006 , without a reason being given , before returning in 2007 . 
 2010 French – Spanish documentary The Light Bulb Conspiracy dealing with planned obsolescence refers to the Centennial Light extensively . 
 According to the fire chief , every few months a news outlet will publish a story on the bulb , generating visitors and general interest , then it will drop back into obscurity for a while . Dozens of magazines and newspapers have featured articles on the bulb . The bulb has been visited and featured by many major news channels in the United States , including NBC , ABC , Fox , CBS , WB , CNN and NPR . The bulb has received letters acknowledging and celebrating its longevity from the city of Shelby , Ohio , the Alameda County Board of Supervisors , the California State Assembly , the California State Senate , Congresswoman Ellen Tauscher , Senator Barbara Boxer , and President George W. Bush . The bulb was featured on an episode of MythBusters on December 13 , 2006 . It was also in the Public Broadcasting Service ( PBS ) documentary Livermore . It was also briefly mentioned on Warehouse 13 in the season @-@ one episode " Regrets " . The light bulb was featured in an episode of 99 % Invisible .

 Forbidden Zone is a 1980 American musical fantasy comedy film directed and produced by Richard Elfman . Co @-@ written by Elfman and fellow Mystic Knights member Matthew Bright , the film is based upon the stage performances of the Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo . Originally shot on black @-@ and @-@ white film , the story involves an alternate universe accessed through a door in the house of the Hercules family . 
 The composing debut of Richard Elfman 's brother Danny , the film stars Hervé Villechaize , Susan Tyrrell , and members of the Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo , and features appearances by Warhol Superstar Viva , Joe Spinell , and The Kipper Kids . Villechaize kicked his cheque back into the production and even painted sets on weekends . The only actual paid actor was Phil Gordon , who played Flash ; all the other SAG actors kicked their cheques back into the show . 
 The film was made as an attempt to capture the essence of The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo 's live performances on film , and also as a means for both Richard Elfman to retire from music to work on film projects , and to serve as a transition between Oingo Boingo 's former cabaret style and a new wave @-@ based style . Amid negative reactions to content in the film that had been perceived as being offensive , the film was screened as a midnight movie , received positive notice , and developed a cult following . In 2004 , the film was digitally restored and released on DVD , and in 2008 , the film was colorized . 
 Richard Elfman is currently working on a sequel that is in pre @-@ production . He has also licensed Forbidden Zone as an intellectual property for manufacturers to produce collectibles based on the film 's characters .

 The film begins on " Friday , April 17 " at 4 pm in Venice , California . Huckleberry P. Jones , local pimp , narcotics peddler and <unk> , enters a vacant house that he owns . While stashing heroin in the basement , he stumbles upon a mysterious door and enters it , falling into the Sixth Dimension , from which he promptly escapes . After retrieving the heroin , he sells the house to the Hercules family . On their way to school , Frenchy Hercules and her brother Flash have a conversation with Squeezit Henderson , who tells them that , while being violently beaten by his mother , he had a vision of his transgender sister René , who had fallen into the Sixth Dimension through the door in the Hercules ' basement . 
 Frenchy returns home to confide in her mother , and decides to take just a " little peek " behind the forbidden door in the basement . After arriving in the Sixth Dimension , she is captured by the perpetually topless Princess , who brings Frenchy to the rulers of the Sixth Dimension , the midget King Fausto and his queen , Doris . When the king falls for Frenchy , Doris orders their frog servant , Bust Rod , to lock her up . In order to make sure that Frenchy is not harmed , Fausto tells Bust Rod to take Frenchy to Cell 63 , where the king keeps his favorite concubines ( as well as René ) . 
 The next day at school , Flash tries to convince Squeezit to help him rescue René and Frenchy . When Squeezit refuses , Flash enlists the help of Gramps instead . In the Sixth Dimension , they speak to an old Jewish man who tells them how to help Frenchy escape , but they soon are captured by Bust Rod . Doris interrogates Flash and Gramps and then lowers them into a large septic tank . She then plots her revenge against Frenchy , relocating all the denizens of Cell 63 to a torture chamber . She leaves the Princess to oversee Frenchy 's torture and execution , but when a fuse is blown , the torture is put on hold and the prisoners from Cell 63 are relocated to keep the King from finding them . 
 After escaping the septic tank , Flash and Gramps come across a woman who tells them that she was once happily married to the king , until Doris stole the throne by seducing her , " even though she 's not my type " . The ex @-@ queen has been sitting in her cell for 1 @,@ 000 years , and has been writing a screenplay in order to keep her sanity . Meanwhile , Pa Hercules is blasted through the stratosphere by an explosion caused by improperly extinguishing his cigarette in a vat of highly flammable tar during his work break at the La Brea Tar Pit Factory . After re @-@ entry , Pa falls through the Hercules family basement and into the Sixth Dimension , where he is imprisoned . 
 Finding a phone , Flash calls Squeezit and again asks for his help . Finally , Squeezit agrees to go into the Sixth Dimension to help rescue Frenchy and René . There , he is captured by Satan , with whom he makes a deal to bring him the Princess in exchange for Satan 's help freeing René and Frenchy . Squeezit accomplishes this task , but has failed to include himself in the deal to rescue his friends , and the devil has him decapitated . Queen Doris sends Bust Rod to keep an eye on the king , and to ensure he doesn 't find out where she 's hidden Frenchy . 
 Fausto catches Bust Rod and forces him to lead him to Frenchy and René , whom he orders to leave the Sixth Dimension to avoid the Queen 's wrath . However , en route to safety , René is stricken with pseudo @-@ menstrual cramps , and they are again captured by the frog . Squeezit 's head , which has now sprouted chicken wings , finds the king and informs him of what has happened . 
 While preparing to kill Frenchy , Doris is confronted by the ex @-@ queen , and the two engage in a cat @-@ fight , with Doris eventually coming out as the victor . Just as she is about to kill Frenchy , Fausto stops her , explaining that Satan 's Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo are holding the Princess hostage , and will kill her should anything befall Frenchy . Flash and Gramps arrive , and Flash is knocked down by Gramps . Ma Hercules enters and , seeing a seemingly dead Flash , shoots Doris . Fausto mourns Doris , then marries Frenchy . 
 The surviving characters look toward a great future as they plan to take over everyone and everything in the Galaxy .

 The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo were formed in late 1972 by Richard Elfman , as a musical theatre troupe . As Richard 's interest shifted to filmmaking , he passed leadership of the band to younger brother Danny Elfman , who had begun to lose interest in musical theatre , and had gained interest in other musical styles such as ska , and had become " sick of <unk> around so much stuff with the theatre troupe . Towards the end " , Elfman remembers , " it was a big production ... there was , like a semi full of stuff . And that was becoming burdensome . So , for me , the idea of being a band that can fit all their gear into a van and set up in a club , and an hour later be playing , became a goal . " 
 Production began during a transitional period when the group was moving from its cabaret style towards a more pop / rock format ; by the time the film was completed , the band had shortened its name to Oingo Boingo . 
 The film was originally conceived as The Hercules Family , a 16mm musical that consisted of twelve musical numbers and a story loosely constructed around them . But as the project grew to 35mm and the storyline evolved , Richard Elfman found himself re @-@ shooting many of the original scenes to fit the new film . Two sequences from the original 16mm footage were featured on the 2004 DVD release : one of Danny Elfman , as Satan , performing " Minnie the Moocher " ( later reshot with visual elements borrowed from the original 16mm sequence and alternate lyrics ) , and another of Marie @-@ Pascale Elfman , singing " Johnny " . The sequence with Elfman as Satan , and members of the Oingo Boingo as his minions , came from live shows , in which the band would perform Cab Calloway tunes like " St. James Infirmary Blues " in the same costumes . 
 Marie @-@ Pascale Elfman , at the time of shooting , was married to director Richard Elfman . She designed the film 's expressionistic sets and starred in the film . Actor and former Mystic Knight Gene Cunningham helped fund the film . When Cunningham and Elfman ran out of money during production , Richard and Marie @-@ Pascale Elfman helped finance by selling houses , before Carl Borack put money into the production in order for Elfman to complete the film . According to Elfman , he had originally intended the film to be screened in color , stating that the original plan was to ship the film to China , where each frame would be hand @-@ tinted , but that this plan was not practical within the production costs .

 Actor Hervé Villechaize was a former roommate of co @-@ writer and co @-@ star Matthew Bright , Villechaize had previously dated co @-@ star Susan Tyrrell , but the two had already broken up by the time production on the film began . According to Richard Elfman , Tyrrell and Villechaize fought periodically throughout the production . The <unk> ' grandfather , Herman Bernstein , also appeared in the film , and Richard Elfman 's accountant appeared under the name " Hyman Diamond " because Elfman had no idea whether or not he wanted to be credited . Others who worked on the film include The Kipper Kids ( Brian Routh and Martin von <unk> ) , Joe Spinell , and former Warhol superstar Viva .

 Forbidden Zone featured Bright 's first work on film , and his only work as an actor ( under the name " Toshiro <unk> " ) . A founding member of the Mystic Knights , Bright later became a screenwriter and director in his own right . Bright 's credits include Freeway , Ted Bundy , and Tiptoes . Bright and director Richard Elfman 's only dispute during the screenwriting process was over a scene in which his character , Squeezit , was originally to have been beaten up for eight minutes and having the walls wiped with his blood . Another scene cut from the script would have had Squeezit being castrated . According to Bright , " I didn 't have any sense of limits or balance then , at the time , I ... you know , I was just , didn 't know what I was doing . I needed reining in . " During filming , Bright was sitting on the set in costume when a lighting stand fell onto his head , cracking his skull , and he had to be rushed to the hospital . When Bright returned to work the next day , he had a mild concussion and whiplash , but he continued with filming .

" The production , from its original 16mm roots to its finish , took three years . Cast and crew members would sleep on the film 's stage , wearing spare gorilla suits to stay warm . Among the film 's artistic influences included 1940s big band and jazz music and Max Fleischer cartoons of the 1930s ( such as Betty Boop ) . Some of the film 's cast was made up of non @-@ professionals cast off the street . In one scene , Richard Elfman brought in a young man to mouth the words of " Bim Bam Boom " , but when he was put in front of the camera , he stood there as the scene was shot . Elfman left the scene in the film by editing in Bright 's lips over the actor 's face . Another scene featured homeless men .

 The film 's animation was created by then @-@ unknown animator John Muto . Because of the film 's low budget , Muto created all of the film 's animation sequences himself . Muto made frequent use of airbrush techniques to establish for himself a distinctive style . For sequences in which live @-@ action and animation were combined , the actors were photographed in tight head @-@ on and profile shots , and the photos were cut out and pasted into the animation in a style recalling Terry Gilliam 's work on Monty Python 's Flying Circus . Muto also credits The Fleischer Brothers as another inspiration .

 Forbidden Zone was the first film scored by Danny Elfman , who would eventually score , among other films , Batman , The Nightmare Before Christmas , and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory . The song Witch 's Egg was written by Georg Michalski and Tyrrell . In some scenes , characters lip synch to old records , including recordings by Cab Calloway , Josephine Baker , and others . 
 The alphabet song performed in a classroom scene was inspired by the " Swinging the Alphabet " song from The Three Stooges short Violent Is the Word for Curly . 
 For the " Yiddishe Charleston " scene , Richard Elfman had shot the sequence with him lip @-@ syncing to an old recording of the song , but was later unable to acquire the rights to the recording , and had to record a new version of the song while attempting to sync the new recording with the footage .

 Forbidden Zone was given limited distribution during its initial theatrical release , and not well received by critics . Some of the film 's sequences and characters led to director Richard Elfman being accused of racism ( because of its satirically surreal use of blackface ) , and even anti @-@ Semitism . According to Elfman , " I was attacked on every level . [ ... ] We were kicked out of theaters ; there were arson threats . " However , the film has since been rediscovered , and has gained new life as a cult film . 
 On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an 88 % score based on 8 reviews , with an average rating of 7 @.@ 1 / 10 . 
 The film 's soundtrack has also become popular , and its theme song was eventually reused by Danny Elfman , who rearranged it as The Dilbert Zone for use as the theme for the television series Dilbert .

 " One Son " is the twelfth episode from the sixth season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It first aired on February 14 , 1999 , on the Fox network . The episode was written by series creator Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz , and directed by Rob Bowman . It explores the series ' overarching mythology and concludes the Syndicate story arc . 
 The series centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) , who work on " X @-@ Files " — cases deemed " unsolvable " by the FBI , usually dealing with the paranormal . Although Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , and the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work , the two have developed a deep friendship . While Cassandra Spender ( Veronica Cartwright ) reveals the truth about the alien conspiracy to take over the Earth to Mulder , her ex @-@ husband , the Smoking Man ( William B. Davis ) , does the same to her son , Jeffrey Spender ( Chris Owens ) , in an effort to convince him to work with the Syndicate . Even as Mulder is deceived by Diana Fowley ( Mimi Rogers ) , Scully stays true to the investigation , and the two find Spender to be a surprise ally . Meanwhile , the Syndicate reaches the climax of its plans , only to have its members systematically exterminated by the faceless alien rebels , who oppose colonization . 
 " One Son , " a direct continuation of the previous episode " Two Fathers , " was written , along with its predecessor , to eliminate the Syndicate and relaunch the series ' mythology in a different direction . Both the opening of the episode and the climactic scene featuring the demise of the Syndicate were filmed at the Marine Corps Air Station Tustin in Tustin , California . Spotnitz was particularly critical of some of the visual effects used in the episode , expressing a desire to one day revisit and redo them . The episode has also been analyzed for its thematic examination of family . " One Son " earned a Nielsen household rating of 10 @.@ 1 , and its first broadcast was watched by 16 @.@ 57 million people . The episode was well received by critics , who applauded the way the Syndicate 's story arc was wrapped up , although others felt the resolution was too simplistic .

 For the first five seasons of the series , FBI federal agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) have unravelled a conspiracy that involves the mysterious Syndicate , and their plans to aid in the alien colonization of Earth . The fifth season episodes " Patient X " and " The Red and the Black " reveal that , counter to the colonization effort , there is a faction of alien rebels opposed to colonization . In the previous episode , " Two Fathers " , one of the rebels tried to infiltrate the Syndicate and form an alliance , only to be killed . Meanwhile , Mulder learned that The Smoking Man 's ( William B. Davis ) ex @-@ wife Cassandra Spender ( Veronica Cartwright ) had successfully become an alien @-@ human hybrid — a signal to the aliens for them to begin colonizing the planet . 
 = = = Events = = = 
 Cassandra demands to be killed by Mulder but , before he can do anything , the group is quarantined by Diana Fowley ( Mimi Rogers ) . Mulder , Cassandra , and Scully are taken to a Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) facility at Fort Marlene , where Fowley tells the agents Cassandra is carrying a contagious organism . Meanwhile , Alex Krycek ( Nicholas Lea ) reports on Cassandra 's escape to the Syndicate , noting that the alien rebels want Cassandra kept alive . However , the Syndicate decides to turn Cassandra over to the colonists and save themselves by commencing colonization . 
 At Fort Marlene , Mulder runs into the sickly looking Marita Covarrubias ( Laurie Holden ) , who tells Mulder that she was subjected to experiments by the Syndicate to create a black oil vaccine and that the colonists will begin colonization if they learn of Cassandra 's existence as an alien @-@ human hybrid . Scully , with help from the Lone Gunmen , looks into Fowley 's personal history and informs Mulder that Fowley has been collecting data on alien abductees and traveling to Tunisia every week , although there is no trace of her activities in FBI records . Although Mulder still trusts Fowley , he goes to her apartment to confront her . 
 Inside the apartment , Mulder 's search for clues is interrupted by the arrival of The Smoking Man , who tells Mulder that he has been betrayed by Jeffrey Spender ( Chris Owens ) , who is actually his son . The Smoking Man tells Mulder that , many years ago , the Syndicate agreed by majority vote , against Bill Mulder 's objections , to align with the alien colonists to be spared during colonization . The Syndicate was forced to give up family members to the colonists as collateral so that an alien fetus could be given to the Syndicate in order for them access alien DNA . Since Bill Mulder was slow to agree , Samantha Mulder was not taken until after the others . Using the fetus , the Syndicate worked on creating alien @-@ human hybrids who could survive colonization . The Smoking Man tells Mulder that colonization will begin once Cassandra is handed over and that Mulder will be able to see his sister again , providing him with an address to the hangar where the Syndicate members will be meeting the colonists . 
 Spender goes to the Syndicate 's headquarters , only to find Krycek , who tells him that the group 's members — with the exception of The Smoking Man , who has gone to retrieve Cassandra — are preparing to present the alien fetus to the aliens . Fowley returns to her apartment , where she finds Mulder . Fowley head to the hangar at El Rico Air Force Base , whereas Scully contacts Mulder and the two try and fail to stop the train car transporting Cassandra to El Rico . Spender arrives at Fort Marlene , where he runs into Covarrubias ; she tells him to go to El Rico Air Force Base to find his mother . 
 A Syndicate surgeon attempting to procure the alien fetus is killed by one of the alien rebels , who assumes his form . Krycek finds the dead surgeon and the fetus missing , and tells Spender that the rebels are now going to succeed in their goals to halt colonization . The Syndicate and its families gather at El Rico Air Force Base . Shortly after Fowley arrives , a white light appears around one end of the hangar . It is revealed to be the rebels , who surround and immolate the entire Syndicate — except for The Smoking Man and Fowley — who escape by car . 
 The next day , Mulder , Scully , Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) and Spender report to Assistant Director Alvin Kersh ( James Pickens , Jr . ) on the deaths of the Syndicate and Cassandra . Spender tells Kersh that Mulder and Scully could have prevented their demise , and recommends that they be reassigned to the X @-@ Files before abruptly leaving the room . Heading to the X @-@ Files office in the basement , Spender finds The Smoking Man , who first berates Spender for not being like Mulder and then shoots him in the head .

 " One Son " concluded the story that had begun in the preceding episode , " Two Fathers " , and wrapped up a large portion of the series ' mythology which had been centered around the Syndicate . The producers decided to pursue this route because the Syndicate 's story arc was creating a " narrative drag " on the series , and that many questions from the past five seasons were still unanswered . Another reason behind the resolution of the Syndicate arc was that series creator and episode co @-@ writer Chris Carter thought the series was going to be canceled by the spring of 2000 . Ultimately , " One Son " was written to resolve the show 's many arcs in preparation for a series finale . While promoting the episode , Carter said it would provide many long @-@ awaited answers , but create new questions for future episodes . The writing staff was also looking for ways to create a new story lines for the series , such as the " Super Soldiers " arc , which was created for the eighth and ninth seasons . 
 Carter also sought to rectify small issues that fans had with the 1998 feature film , The X @-@ Files , explaining , " I think if there was any trouble with the movie , it was that we promised so much that we didn 't deliver all of it . I think we wanted to deliver a lot , and all at once , in these two episodes " . Episode co @-@ writer Frank Spotnitz agreed , saying that when The X @-@ Files film was being promoted with the tagline " The Truth is Revealed , " he realized that the answers presented in the movie would not be the answers that many of the fans were wanting to hear . Spotnitz also felt that writing " One Son " was difficult because the episodes that gave answers seemed to be less entertaining for viewers than episodes that presented new questions . Spotnitz , however , acknowledged that this episode was necessary to help explain the complex mythology of the show ; he called the episode the " biggest chapter we had time to explore in the nine years we were on the air " . 
 Part of the problem with creating " mytharc " for the writers was due to the fact that , because there were so few mythology episodes each season , they were often forced to put as much material as they could into each episode . Originally , a large portion of the episode was supposed to reveal the history of the Syndicate via flashback . Reportedly , these scenes would have featured younger versions of Bill Mulder ( played by Peter Donat ) , The Smoking Man , Dr. Openshaw , the Elders , and many others . However , this never panned out , and Carter and Spotnitz had to reframe the episode around narration courtesy of the Smoking Man , which was filmed and edited under extreme pressure near the end of production . While the previous episode , " Two Fathers " , was titled after the duality of Bill Mulder and The Smoking Man , this episode was titled " One Son " to reflect the fact that Mulder was the only remaining son of either of these fathers , after the shooting of Jeffrey Spender and the rejection of Alex Krycek . 
 Several of the plot elements are self @-@ referential to other episodes of the series . Fort Marlene 's presence is a reference to the first season finale " The Erlenmeyer Flask , " when the alien fetus was first introduced ; the term " purity control " is also a reference to this episode . The references to MUFON were purposely placed in the episode to connect to the story @-@ arc involving Scully 's cancer , which had been discovered during the show 's fourth season . The episode also references and mirrors elements of popular culture . Fowley 's apartment was purposely located in the Watergate complex , a hotel notorious as the location of the 1970s Watergate scandal . The scenes featuring Mulder and Scully being decontaminated were based on a similar scene in the 1962 James Bond film Dr. No , according to Spotnitz . He felt that the scene successfully played upon the sexual tension between the two lead characters . 
 = = = Casting and filming = = = 
 " One Son " would be the last episode of the series to feature Owens ' character , Jeffrey Spender , until the ninth season entry " William " . Owens first learned that he would be killed off when Carter called him and told him , " You 're going to go out a hero , of sorts " . Owens was slightly disappointed , noting that he had just been introduced in the series during the conclusion of the previous season . Davis was upset that Owens was leaving the series , and reportedly told Owens during their last scene together , " I don 't want to shoot you ! I enjoy working with you ! " Owens , however , jokingly noted that Davis had no problems slapping him when the script called for it . In the episode , Laurie Holden , who played Marita Covarrubias , returns . Spotnitz crafted the sequence in which she confronts Mulder to be a way of " taking away [ her ] beauty and making her [ look ] as horrifying as possible " . To accomplish this , she was given " terrible @-@ looking " contact lenses and her hair was unkempt . 
 While the first five seasons of the series were mainly filmed in Vancouver , British Columbia , production of the show 's sixth season was based in Los Angeles , California . The scenes taking place in the hangar were filmed at the Marine Corps Air Station Tustin in Tustin , California . The hangar , constructed in 1942 as an airship base , is one of the largest all @-@ wooden hangars in the United States . Bill Roe , director of photography , and Rob Bowman were tasked with lighting the entire structure for the episode 's teaser and climax , a job that Spotnitz later called " amazing " . He noted that , after the series ' move to Los Angeles , production costs had risen , forcing the show to cut down on its " astonishing production values " . However , he applauded the use of the hangar , noting that it " was a way to try and create that cinematic scale and still keep [ the show ] affordable " . The episode also revisits trains as a setting , something that had previously been done in the third season episodes " 731 " and " Nisei " . However , for budgetary reasons , the scenes taking place on the trains did not take up much screen time . To give the effect that the train carrying Cassandra Spender is moving at a high speed , Manners utilized " sound effects , music , clever camera angles and quick cutting " . In reality , the train was never moving faster than eight miles an hour . 
 All of the sets in the episode were created by Corey Kaplan . Roe , meanwhile , was in charge of the cinematography . Spotnitz complimented Rob Bowman 's direction in this episode . However , he had a problem with the scene in which one of the Syndicate members changes into an alien rebel , reasoning that this was because the effect had been created on such short notice . He explained , " It was one of those cases where you just run out of time , sorry to say " . He later expressed a desire to one day go back and amend the effect . 
 The production staff originally wanted to show the alien rebels incinerating the Syndicate on screen . However , because they were filming in an all @-@ wooden hangar , the use of fire was not at all considered . The episode required extensive demands from makeup department head Cheri Montesanto @-@ Medcalf . She was required to create the illusion of the head surgeon 's head being frozen in liquid nitrogen , as well as to " de @-@ age " members of the Syndicate for the flashback sequences . To create the former , <unk> @-@ Medcalf painted the actor 's face blue , then attached silicon icicles to his head . 
 = = Themes = = 
 The episode makes heavy use of the theme of family , which is notably reflected in its title . Meghan Deans of Tor.com highlighted the fact that the Syndicate hands over their family and loved ones to save the world as evidence of this permeating theme . She also highlighted the duality of fathers and sons . The Smoking Man is both a father to Mulder and Spender , but he favors Mulder . At the same time , both Spender and Krycek vie for the position of " son , " with the former falling from The Smoking Man 's grace , and the latter playing the role of " prodigal son " . However , both Spender and Krycek fail , leaving Mulder as the titular " one son " . Neal Justin of the Star Tribune also noted this theme , commenting that " it is interesting to note that the core of the story appears to be the relationship between parents and their children " . He compared the episode 's thematic mechanism to the same concern of the Star Wars films .

 Because the episode was promoted with the promise of answering questions , it caused increased media speculation . With the conclusion of " One Son " , many critics applauded the way the series was able to wrap up the Syndicate arc . A.M. Jamison of the Dayton Daily News wrote that " ' One Son ' ends dramatically , drawing to a close one quest and opening a new set of challenges not only for Mulder but the Earth as well " . Noel Holston and Justin of the Star Tribune awarded the episode four stars out of five , noting that it answered even more questions than " Two Fathers " . They also applauded the familial bonds that held the episode together . However , some critics felt that the answers were slightly rushed . Manuel Mendoza of The Dallas Morning News wrote that " Mr. Carter and his co @-@ writer Frank Spotnitz have a wonderfully indirect way of setting up dramatic situations and an unbelievably shorthand way of resolving them " . 
 Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five . The two enjoyed Davis ' performance , noting that he gave the role " real power " , and that he was " the emotional centre of the episode " . Shearman and Pearson were critical of the amount of attention Fowley 's allegiance received . However , they felt that the episode " reaches for both significance and closure , and mostly works " . Deans wrote that " One Son , " along with " Two Fathers , " is elevated above a " mytharc <unk> " because of " its use of family , a theme woven deep and clear throughout " . She largely applauded the episode 's exploration of the various characters , and its central motif , noting that " the conspiracy [ the Syndicate ] is no longer the threat now . It 's the rebels and the colonists , fearful and unknown . Just like family " . Tom Kessenich , in his book Examination : An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6 – 9 of the X @-@ Files wrote positively of the episode , saying " The ' Two Fathers ' / ' One Son ' was extremely powerful stuff . Tightly written , beautifully filmed and filled with more affirmations than revelations , but fascination looks at the characters in the drama " . 
 Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a " B " rating . He felt that the episode worked extremely well on a visual and character @-@ based level . Handlen felt that , because the show was " often scariest when it ’ s implying , rather than flat out stating , " its " mythology only really works as something just out of sight " . For this reason , he felt that the episode mixed " the compelling with the absurd " with " mixed results " . Handlen concluded that the episode " has its moment , " but is ultimately hurt by the fact that it refuses " to come to any serious conclusions , " as well as " the inherent limitations of the [ episode 's ] form " . Not all reviews were glowing . Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four . Vitaris criticized the death scene of the Syndicate , noting that it was " clumsily contrived , allowing [ The Smoking Man ] and Fowley to escape , but not because it makes sense , but because the show needs them to return at some point " . 
 Since its airing , " One Son " has been called one of the best episodes of The X @-@ Files . Joyce Millman from Salon magazine said the episode , along with " Two Fathers , " was one " of the most coherent , [ ... ] almost unbearably tense , hours in the series ' run " . She said that the episode gave some long @-@ waited answers , but created new questions , such as what has really happened to Samantha Mulder . Michigan Daily reviewer Melissa Runstrom said that " One Son , " along with " Two Fathers " and season finale " Biogenesis , " were the highlights of the sixth season . Earl Cressey from DVD Talk also named " One Son , " along with " Two Fathers , " as one of the " highlights of season six " . 
 = Skanderbeg 's Italian expedition = 
 Skanderbeg 's Italian expedition ( 1460 – 1462 ) was undertaken to aid his ally Ferdinand I of Naples , whose rulership was threatened by the Angevin Dynasty . George Kastrioti Skanderbeg was the ruler of Albania ( Latin : dominus <unk> ) who had been leading a rebellion against the Ottoman Empire since 1443 and allied himself with several Western European monarchs in order to consolidate his domains . In 1458 , Alfonso V of Aragon , ruler of Sicily and Naples and Skanderbeg 's most important ally , died , leaving his illegitimate son , Ferdinand , on the Neapolitan throne ; René d 'Anjou , the French Duke of Anjou , laid claim to the throne . The conflict between René 's and Ferdinand 's supporters soon erupted into a civil war . Pope Calixtus III , of Spanish background himself , could do little to secure Ferdinand , so he turned to Skanderbeg for aid . 
 In 1457 , Skanderbeg had achieved his most famous victory over the Ottoman Empire at Albulena ( Ujëbardha ) , which was received with great enthusiasm throughout Italy . In order to repay Alfonso for the financial and military assistance given to him years before , Skanderbeg took up the pope 's pleas to help out Alfonso 's son by sending a military expedition to Italy . Before leaving , Skanderbeg tried to negotiate a ceasefire with Sultan Mehmed II , the conqueror of Constantinople , to ensure his domain 's safety . Mehmed had not declared a truce and he was still sending his armies against Bosnia and the Morea . It was not until 1459 , after Mehmed 's conquest of Serbia , that Mehmed not only declared a truce , but also a three @-@ year ceasefire with Skanderbeg . This gave Skanderbeg his opportunity to send his men to Italy . 
 Due to fears of an approaching Ottoman army , Skanderbeg first sent his nephew , Constantine , with 500 cavalry to Barletta . They were incorporated into Ferdinand 's forces to combat his Angevin rivals . They held back their enemy for a year , but did not gain much ground until Skanderbeg arrived in September 1461 . Before reaching Italy , Skanderbeg visited Ragusa ( Dubrovnik ) to convince its rectors to help fund his campaign . Meanwhile , his men landed in Italy and Angevin forces lifted their siege on Barletta . Upon arriving , Skanderbeg continued to pursue his ally 's enemies with great success . Ferdinand 's adversaries thus began to retreat from his territories and Skanderbeg went back to Albania ; a troop of his men stayed until Ferdinand managed to finally defeat the pretenders to his throne at the Battle of <unk> , although it is not known if Skanderbeg 's men participated . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1456 , Skanderbeg 's ally , Janos Hunyadi , died , and his son , Mathias Corvinus , was crowned King of Hungary . Hunyadi had been an advocate for an offensive war against the Ottoman Empire , whereas the Hungarian nobility and his son promoted a defensive war . The next year , however , George Kastrioti Skanderbeg defeated a sizable Ottoman force at the Battle of Albulena ( Ujëbardha ) . Rome had been desperately waiting for such a victory after the Siege of Belgrade , as Pope Calixtus III had wanted to assure himself of the feasibility of a crusade before declaring one . Calixtus thus named Skanderbeg the Captain @-@ General of the Curia ; to secure the pope 's interests , Skanderbeg sent twelve Turkish prisoners of war that had been captured at Albulena to Rome . Despite seeing his forces defeated the year before , Sultan Mehmed II prepared another force to be sent into Albania . The country had been obstructing his ambitions for empire in the West and he grew restless to defeat Skanderbeg . Skanderbeg sent delegations to several Western European states to convince them to stop fighting each other and unite for Calixtus ' crusade .

 On 27 September 1458 , Alfonso V of Aragon , Skanderbeg 's most important and helpful ally after the stipulation of the Treaty of Gaeta , died . In 1448 , as gesture of friendship with Alfonso , Skanderbeg sent a detachment of Albanian troops commanded by General Demetrios <unk> to <unk> to quell a rebellion against Alfonso . The next year , many of these men were allowed to settle four villages in Sicily which Alfonso controlled . Upon hearing of his ally 's death , Skanderbeg sent emissaries to the new King of Naples , Ferdinand I , to give condolence for his father 's death , but also to congratulate him on his accession to the throne of Naples . The succession was not without turbulence , however : René d 'Anjou laid claim to the throne since his family had controlled Naples before Aragon had taken control of it , and also because Ferdinand was Alfonso 's illegitimate son . The Southern Italian nobility , many of Angevin background , supported René d 'Anjou over the Aragonese Ferdinand . Among them was Giovanni Antonio del Balzo Orsini , the Prince of Taranto , and Jacopo Piccinino , a famed condottieri who had been invited by the Angevins . Francisco Sforza , the Duke of Milan , who was wary of a French presence in Italy , sided with Ferdinand and sent his nephew , Alessandro Sforza , to command his army in southern Italy . Pope Calixtus , a Spaniard who wished to see his compatriot in control of Naples , was in no position to help the weak Ferdinand , so he turned to Skanderbeg for help . However , by that time , Piccinino and his men had conquered all of southern Italy except Naples , Capua , Aversa , Gaeta , Troia , and Barletta , where Ferdinand was besieged . 
 Skanderbeg had received much aid from Ferdinand 's father , Alfonso , and was still a vassal of the Crown of Aragon , so he felt the need to repay the Crown . He accepted the pope 's pleas to go to Italy and aid Ferdinand . Skanderbeg 's stated reasoning was twofold : he wanted to remain loyal to his ally and he wanted to prevent an Angevin takeover of Naples since they had maintained friendly relations with the Turks . Skanderbeg also feared that if the Angevins took Naples , they would turn to Albania where they had previously maintained a kingdom . On the other hand , before undertaking any action against the Angevins , he took measures to soften relations with Venice . Seeing that Southern Italy was locked in conflict , Venice no longer feared an Aragonese @-@ Albanian alliance and the Senate decided to take a friendlier approach in Albanian @-@ Venetian relations . Meanwhile , Pope Calixtus III had died and was succeeded by Pope Pius II . Sensing that war would soon begin , Pius tried to convince Giovanni Orsini , Ferdinand 's main rival , to settle his differences with the King . The French King , Louis XI , took up the Angevin stance and , in the hopes of convincing Pius to allow the French takeover of Naples , proposed the repeal of the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges which undermined the pope 's power and he even declared that he would be willing to lend 70 @,@ 000 men for the planned papal crusade . Pius , however , was wary of insincerity and disregarded these proposals . A further effort to deter Skanderbeg 's landing was made by Sigismondo Malatesta , the Lord of Rimini and Italy 's most feared petty tyrant , who had tried to invite Mehmed to Italy with a detailed map of the Adriatic if Ferdinand sent for the Albanian . The manuscript , however , never reached the sultan and fell into Pius ' hands . 
 = = = Albanian situation = = = 
 Constant news of Ottoman campaigns against Bosnia and Morea but not against Albania seemed to suggest to Skanderbeg that Mehmed II had been considering an armistice with Skanderbeg . The latter took advantage of this lull in the fighting by preparing for his voyage to Italy and by securing his northern frontiers from a possible attack by Skanderbeg 's elusive ally in northern Albania , Lekë Dukagjini , who had been trying to expand his realm by reaching an agreement with the Turks . In order to curb his ambitions , Skanderbeg seized <unk> Fortress and presented it as a gift to Venice . Skanderbeg then established an alliance with Venice against Dukagjini , while <unk> was strengthening his Turkish alliance . The new pope issued a bull against Dukagjini , giving him fifteen days to break his alliance with the Ottomans and to reconcile with Skanderbeg , or be subject to interdiction ; Dukagjini conceded and chose the former option . He then reestablished his alliance with Skanderbeg and Venice and accepted all of its losses . 
 Pius II continued to support Skanderbeg , but did not provide him as much financial aid as Calixtus had since he believed that Skanderbeg 's military skill and his soldiers ' aptitude for battle were enough to hold back the Turkish armies . However , the pope still considered Skanderbeg 's assistance essential for his plans for an anti @-@ Ottoman crusade . In 1459 , after Mehmed II completed his conquest of Serbia , Ottoman envoys appealed for a three @-@ year armistice between Skanderbeg 's Albania and the Ottoman Empire . The sultan 's purpose was to distance Skanderbeg from the pope 's crusade as he believed the crusade 's only hope for success was Skanderbeg . In order to give Albania a break from fifteen years of continuous Ottoman invasion , Skanderbeg considered accepting the proposal but he had to get the pope 's approval . Pius did not allow such an agreement and began to doubt Skanderbeg 's loyalty . As the Ottomans were operating in the Western Balkans , Pius feared that the Ottoman soldiers would break the truce and pour into Albania . In order to regain the pope 's trust , Skanderbeg did not agree to the peace . Skanderbeg , nevertheless , was disappointed by Rome 's response and he responded by not participating in the Council of Mantua which was held to plan the future crusade . The Council ended in failure , signifying that Skanderbeg would receive no help from the West . He thus sent ambassadors to the pope saying that he would only be willing to land in Italy if a ceasefire with the Turks were arranged , something which Rome soon allowed . 
 Before sending his men to Italy , Ragusa ( Dubrovnik ) was to receive Skanderbeg 's envoy on 9 June 1460 . He requested the city 's support for the transport of his warriors to southern Italy over the Adriatic . Venice was not consulted since they pursued their own interests in Italy , whereas Ragusa held close economic relations with the Crown of Aragon . Meanwhile , Skanderbeg sent Martin Muzaka to Rome where he presented Pius with Skanderbeg 's plans , and Pius in turn notified Ferdinand . Pius then ordered Venice to guard the Albanian coastline . Skanderbeg then decided to send a troop of his men while he remained in Albania . In mid @-@ June 1461 , Skanderbeg agreed to a ceasefire with Mehmed who used this time to finally conquer Trebizond ( Trabzon ) in the northeastern part of modern Turkey . The truce was agreed to last for three years .

 On 17 September 1460 , Skanderbeg sent 500 cavalry to Barletta in Apulia under the command of his nephew , Constantine , who at the time was 22 or 23 years old . The battles for the Crown of Naples up to that point had been minor with not much more than one @-@ thousand troops per belligerent . Ferdinand 's Neapolitan army as a whole stood at 7 @,@ 000 men . The addition of 500 Albanian cavalry , even though they were not <unk> like their Italian counterparts , increased his force 's effectiveness . By this time , Ferdinand had lost most of his territory , and was left with some fortresses in Apulia and the area surrounding Naples . The Angevins were swiftly approaching Naples and Ferdinand prepared a counteroffensive . He first secured what he had by putting Roberto del Balzo Orsini in command , but Orsini 's incompetence held up the Neapolitan army . By this time , Skanderbeg 's men had already arrived , and Ferdinand commenced his offensive . Albanian light @-@ cavalry warfare was first noted here for its swiftness and effectiveness where they were reported to travel 30 – 40 miles ( 48 – 64 km ) per day as opposed to the Italian cavalry which could only travel 10 – 12 miles ( 16 – 19 km ) . The Albanians were encouraged by Ferdinand to fight in their traditional manner and to raid the territory ; Ferdinand informed Francisco Sforza that the Albanians had been devastating Apulia and taking whatever loot they could . These events worried the Angevins and prompted Giovanni Orsini to try to stop Skanderbeg from pouring his men into Italy . René d 'Anjou had been particularly surprised by Skanderbeg 's action since he believed that he had never offended the Albanian . 
 = = = Orsini – Skanderbeg correspondence = = = 
 Giovanni Orsini was the Prince of Taranto and Ferdinand 's fiercest rival . He had been , however , Alfonso 's faithful ally and had developed an admiration for Skanderbeg and his campaigns in Albania . After Skanderbeg had sided with his rival , Orsini allied with the Angevins and refused to recognize Ferdinand as King of Naples . He then sent a letter to convince Skanderbeg to pull his men out of Italy arguing that Ferdinand 's fortunes were hopeless , that Skanderbeg 's fame would die out after his supposed debacle , and that an alliance with René would be much more rewarding than an alliance with Ferdinand . Skanderbeg 's letter in response , dated to 10 October 1460 , stated that he was not a condottieri looking for fortune , but a mature man looking to help his ally . Furthermore , he sent another letter to Ferdinand assuring him his loyalty . Another letter was sent to Pius assuring him that the Albanians were fit for battle in Italy , something the Italian rulers did not believe . The letters elucidate Skanderbeg 's political motives behind his Italian expedition , presenting himself as a noble ally , and also illustrate the influence of the Renaissance in Skanderbeg 's court . They also served a psychological purpose to intimidate Ferdinand 's rivals : Skanderbeg compared himself to Pyrrhus of Epirus of antiquity who marched into Italy to defend the Greek city @-@ states from Roman expansion . 
 = = = Neapolitan counteroffensive = = = 
 By October 1460 , Ferdinand was able to recapture his western territories from Capua to Beneventum . In his eastern frontier , however , his enemies remained at large . The most dangerous among them was Piccinino . Piccinino had undertaken the task of blocking papal and Neapolitan troops en route to Apulia . Since Roberto Orsini , the man left in charge of the east and Giovanni Orsini 's brother who had remained loyal to Ferdinand , was deemed incompetent , Ferdinand invited Constantine to Naples , offering him a leading role in an operation against Piccinino . Along with Constantine 's cavalry , Francesco del Balzo , the Duke of Andria who had remained loyal to Ferdinand , managed to defeat Ercole d 'Este in Gargano . They then had control over the custom @-@ duties gathered there which brought 30 @,@ 000 ducats annually from which most of Piccinino 's pay came . The fighting continued for three months after which Constantine and Ferdinand were able to regain some lost territory . Piccinino prepared his own counteroffensive , along with Giovanni Orsini 's men , laying siege to the main castles . A fierce battle soon erupted over Venosa on 28 May 1461 where the Albanian cavalry took part . Ferdinand abandoned the city and fled back to Apulia . Near Troia , he met Skanderbeg 's ambassador , <unk> Stres Balsha , who informed him that Skanderbeg was ready to land in Italy as soon as the proper galleys were provided . 
 = = Skanderbeg 's expedition = = 
 = = = Preparations and Ragusan voyage = = = 
 Before leaving for Italy , Skanderbeg needed to accumulate the appropriate finances . Pius ordered the Diocese of Dalmatia to give a third of what it had raised for the forthcoming crusade to Skanderbeg . The pope also ordered 1 @,@ 000 florins to be given to Skanderbeg from the Vatican 's funds . The Ragusan banks held this amount , but due to the threat of an Ottoman invasion , they refused to continue funding the crusade ; Stefan Vukčić of Zeta warned that the Ottomans would soon move into Dalmatia and Albania . They were thus reluctant to fund Skanderbeg 's expedition to Italy . Due to issues of finance and the lack of large ships ( he had , however , received several smaller ships to transport his troops ) , Skanderbeg 's arrival was delayed while Ferdinand was under siege in Barletta . Before the siege began , however , <unk> sent four galleys to the Albanian shores where Skanderbeg and his men were waiting . Skanderbeg had meanwhile sent an unnamed captain to his eastern frontiers to guard against an Ottoman attack and left his wife , <unk> , in charge of his affairs . 
 A Venetian ambassador on his way from Constantinople reported that Skanderbeg had assembled 1 @,@ 000 cavalry and 2 @,@ 000 infantry along with several papal and Neapolitan ships at Capo @-@ di @-@ <unk> ( Albanian : Kepi i <unk> ) near modern @-@ day <unk> . He was still awaiting a supply of grain and two Neapolitan ships , however , so he continued to wait . On 21 – 22 August 1461 , the four galleys sent by Ferdinand arrived . He boarded soon thereafter but he did not send his entire force directly to Apulia . He sent <unk> Balsha ( who had returned from Italy ) with 500 cavalry and 1 @,@ 000 infantry to the besieged Ferdinand , whereas Skanderbeg himself went to Ragusa to convince its rectors there to give him his needed funds . Balsha 's men landed in Barletta on 24 August 1461 . The Angevin forces , among whom was Giovanni Orsini , feared that Skanderbeg himself was the leader of this force , so they lifted the siege of Barletta immediately . Balsha then informed Ferdinand that Skanderbeg would arrive after his voyage to Ragusa . Ferdinand felt that Skanderbeg 's personal involvement was essential and began to worry when he did not come in two days , as Balsha had promised . 
 Skanderbeg reached Ragusa on 24 August 1461 along with the Pal Engjëlli , the Archbishop of Durrës . His men stayed on the ships anchored in the harbor while he went into the city . Due to papal pressure , the Ragusans had reconsidered Skanderbeg 's requests . His fame was visible when he walked through the city @-@ gates and the population poured into the streets to see him . He had been greeted with a ceremony and a tour of the city inspecting its walls and weaponry . He then received the financial sum he had come for . His men were also supplied with food for their coming campaign . His popularity allowed him to be well @-@ kept by the Ragusans where the largest Albanian community outside of Albania was present . On 29 August 1461 , Skanderbeg set off for Apulia , but a storm forced him to anchor off a Dalmatian island . On 3 September 1461 , Skanderbeg finally reached Barletta . 
 = = = Skanderbeg in Italy = = = 
 Even though they lifted the siege of Barletta upon seeing Skanderbeg 's approaching men the week before , Angevin forces remained active . Once Skanderbeg arrived , Ferdinand put him in command of the fortress of Barletta whereas the King himself went to Ariano <unk> . Once left in command of the fortress , Skanderbeg moved against Ferdinand 's rivals . Among them were Giovanni Orsini , Jean d 'Anjou ( the Duke of Calabria ) , Piccinino , and Francesco del Balzo . They had stationed themselves in Andria , where the Albanian assaults continued . The Albanian cavalry 's light armament , swift horses and loose ranks allowed them to quickly overcome the more heavily armed Italian cavalry , which fought in tight formations . In one of their operations , an Albanian warrior captured Alois <unk> , the lord of the Castle of Monte Sant 'Angelo who was imprisoned in the Fortress of Barletta . Three years later , Ferdinand would present Skanderbeg with the castle as a token of his gratitude . 
 Ferdinand 's opponents , under Piccinino 's main command , tried to open battle with Skanderbeg , but due to the combined strength of Albanian and Neapolitan forces , they withdrew from the <unk> fields to Acquaviva delle Fonti . News of Piccinino 's retreat reached Venice who sent a message to Francisco Sforza . Skanderbeg then marched to Taranto , where Giovanni Orsini was prince . Orsini tried again to dissuade Skanderbeg from marching against him , but Ferdinand was wary of Orsini 's faithfulness , so Skanderbeg continued raiding Orsini 's territory . He split his army into three parts , one under Moisi Arianit Golemi , the other under Vladan <unk> , and the last under his command . He led attacks against Ferdinand 's enemies in three directions without halt , thoroughly exhausting them . During the month of October , Skanderbeg continued to pillage <unk> 's territory from his bases at Barletta and Andria since the Angevins were not present ; Ferdinand meanwhile mopped up in Calabria , where he recaptured Cosenza and <unk> . At this point , Orsini asked Skanderbeg for a truce which the Albanian rejected . On 27 October , Skanderbeg reported that he had captured the town of <unk> . Piccinino then asked Skanderbeg to discontinue his campaign which Skanderbeg exuberantly accepted , believing that peace was near . 
 Piccinino , however , did not seek to maintain the agreement as one of his deserters reported . Upon learning this , Skanderbeg decided to open battle with Piccinino 's men . After feeding his men and preparing his horses , Skanderbeg set off by moonlight for the Angevin camp . He found the place empty , however , since one of Piccinino 's men had already informed Piccinino on the Albanians ' intentions . Skanderbeg then returned to Barletta where he was reinforced by Ferdinand and his men . He then split his army into two , one under Alessandro Sforza 's command , the other under his , and he approached Troia . Jean d 'Anjou and Piccinino were stationed in Lucera , however , eight miles from Troia . Knowing that battle would come between Troia and Lucera , Skanderbeg set out by night to capture <unk> , a mountain lying between the two cities , where he stationed some of his men to protect it . Thence , his men could find refuge in case of defeat . Piccinino had the same objective in mind and set out to capture the mountain , but instead met Skanderbeg 's men . He thus kept his men in order for the coming battle . The next day , the two armies met . The battle lasted until dusk , but Jean 's men suffered a serious defeat and he was forced to flee . Piccinino then retreated from his campaigns . He went northwards where he joined Sigismondo Malatesta and 200 of his men to launch assaults on the papal state . 
 Skanderbeg 's next task was to recapture Trani , the second most important point in Apulia , aside from Barletta . He succeeded in capturing the commander of the garrison , Fuscia de <unk> , who had rebelled against Ferdinand . Fuscia was outside the walls of Trani with sixteen men when Skanderbeg saw him and surrounded him and then tried to convince him to abandon Orsini , whereby Fuscia refused for pecuniary reasons . On the morning of 28 December 1461 , with Fuscia 's pleas , <unk> , the vice @-@ commander of the garrison , surrendered Trani . Both Fuscia and <unk> , however , refused to hand over the garrison 's munitions . Skanderbeg threatened to imprison them if they did not surrender what they were asked to , forcing the two to hand over Trani 's stores . After weeks of marauding , Skanderbeg and his Aragonese colleagues joined Alessandro Sforza 's men . They then yielded all of the fortresses that they had recaptured to Ferdinand . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Seeing that their fortunes were dwindling , Ferdinand 's rivals tried to settle for peace with Francisco Sforza . Ferdinand sent Skanderbeg as an intermediary where Giovanni Orsini and Piccinino offered peace if paid 150 @,@ 000 and 110 @,@ 000 ducats respectively , something that Ferdinand refused . This was one of Skanderbeg 's last personal actions in Italy . He stayed in Apulia for another month until January 1462 when he returned to Albania , leaving his soldiers in Italy . His reason for leaving Italy is not clear , but it is believed that at that time Mehmed was preparing his campaign against Hungary , something which could be turned against Albania . On his return route , he again visited Ragusa , where he was likewise welcomed as a hero . He wanted to set off for Albania immediately , but bad weather forced him to stay . He was offered supplies by the Ragusan Rectors , suggesting that he wished to continue to Albania via land , but instead , after ten days in Ragusa , he sailed by ship to Albania . Before leaving , he purchased grain from Sicily for his soldiers in Apulia . 
 The war over the Crown of Naples continued for several more months after Skanderbeg left . It is not known if Albanian warriors fought in the ensuing battles . In August 1462 , Ferdinand achieved a decisive victory at <unk> . Skanderbeg 's expedition made him famous throughout Italy . In his book , De Bello <unk> ( English : The Neapolitan War ) , <unk> Pontanus sees the Albanian landing as essential to Ferdinand 's victory : their quick maneuvering and swift assaults virtually immobilized the Italian warriors . Skanderbeg 's expedition succeeded in lifting the Siege of Barletta , capturing Trani through a ruse , forcing the Angevins to turn from an offensive to a defensive strategy , and devastating the land to the point where its inhabitants and Giovanni Orsini were forced to submit to Ferdinand , even allowing Ferdinand to safely attend the wedding of Antonio Piccolomini , Pius II 's nephew . Moreover , the campaign was instrumental in securing the Neapolitan kingdom for Ferdinand . 
 For his services , Ferdinand awarded Monte Sant 'Angelo to Skanderbeg where many of his men soon settled . They settled fifteen villages in the rolling landscapes to the east of Taranto . His return to Albania was greeted as a triumph by his followers . Despite the jubilation , however , Skanderbeg began to prepare for war . On 7 July 1462 , the Turkish army resumed its campaigns in Albania . The first major engagement was at Mokra on 7 July 1462 . In the following Macedonian campaign in August of the same year , Skanderbeg defeated three Ottoman armies in one month . On 27 April 1463 , Skanderbeg and Mehmed signed a new peace treaty , but later , on 9 September 1463 , Skanderbeg signed an alliance with Venice which had been preparing for war against the Ottomans . On 12 October 1463 , Pius grew confident enough to declare his crusade against the Ottoman Turks which Skanderbeg joined . 
 = Battle of Goodenough Island = 
 The Battle of Goodenough Island ( 22 – 27 October 1942 ) , also known as Operation Drake , was a battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II . The Allies attacked the Kaigun Rikusentai ( Special Naval Landing Force ) stranded on Goodenough Island , Papua , during the Battle of Milne Bay to deny the Japanese the ability to use the island prior to the Buna campaign . " Drake Force " , consisting of the Australian 2 / 12th Battalion and attachments , landed on the southern tip of Goodenough Island at Mud Bay and Taleba Bay on 22 October , and following a short but heavy fight , the Japanese forces withdrew to Fergusson Island on 27 October . After the battle , Goodenough Island was developed by the Allies and became a major base which they used for further operations later in the war . 
 = = Background = = 
 Goodenough Island is the northernmost of the D 'Entrecasteaux Islands , to the north @-@ east of Papua separated by the 15 @-@ mile ( 24 km ) wide Ward Hunt Strait . The island is located 65 miles ( 105 km ) by sea from Milne Bay and 185 miles ( 298 km ) from Port Moresby . It lies along the sea route between Buna and Milne Bay and was therefore strategically important during late 1942 . The island is roughly oval shaped , measuring 21 miles ( 34 km ) long and 13 miles ( 21 km ) across . The coastal belt is up to 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) in width , covered in grasslands and dissected by streams and coastal swamps . The island rises sharply to the central summit of Mount <unk> , 8 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 400 m ) above sea level . 
 While the western side of the island was covered in rain forest and jungle , there were grassy plains on the north @-@ eastern side covered in kunai and kangaroo grass . These were suitable sites for airfield development , but the best anchorages were at Mud Bay on the south eastern side , Taleba Bay on the south western , and Beli Beli Bay on the eastern side . Other sites could only accommodate shallow draught vessels drawing 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) or less , were obstructed by coral reefs , or were exposed to the weather thus making them unsuitable for development . The island had no roads , and there was no motor or animal transport . Neither the interior of the island nor the surrounding waters were adequately charted in 1942 . Important features were often missing from maps , and some features had different spellings . 
 Aircraft and ships headed from Milne Bay to Buna and vice versa had to pass close by Goodenough Island , so an Allied presence on the island could provide warning of Japanese operations while denying the Japanese the opportunity to observe Allied ships and aircraft . Goodenough Island also had flat areas suitable for the construction of emergency airstrips . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 In early August 1942 , a small detachment of an American fighter control squadron had been stationed on Goodenough Island to provide advance warning to the Australian fighters based at Milne Bay . On 7 August , five Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) P @-@ 40 Kittyhawks of No. 76 Squadron made forced landings on the grassy plains . After makeshift airstrips were cut through the grass , four of them were able to be flown out again . 
 On 24 August , seven landing craft carrying 353 Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces troops of the 5th Sasebo Special Naval Landing Force , supplemented by a few engineers of the 14th and 15th Pioneer Units ( <unk> ) , set out from Cape Nelson in the dark to participate in the attack on the Allied forces at Milne Bay . Upon reaching Goodenough Island they were unable to locate a suitable hiding place for their landing craft during the day , and they had to be left on the beach , where they were discovered by the Allies . Their movement was reported by a coastwatcher at Cape Nelson , and a report was received at Milne Bay around midday on 25 August that they were on the west coast of Goodenough Island . Nine Kittyhawks from No. 75 Squadron RAAF were despatched to investigate . They located the landing craft and destroyed all seven , along with the Japanese force 's radio and most of its stores . Eight Japanese were killed in the raid ; the survivors , lacking transport , were stranded . Meanwhile , the American detachment on Goodenough Island destroyed its radios and withdrew from the island . 
 News of what had occurred on Goodenough Island reached the Japanese command on 9 September via an orderly who had made his way back to Buna in a canoe . The destroyers Yayoi and Isokaze set out from Rabaul to rescue the men on 10 September . They were sighted by Allied aircraft the next day . The destroyers USS Selfridge , Bagley , Henley and Helm were detached from Task Force 44 , under Captain Cornelius W. Flynn , USN , to intercept . They did not locate the Japanese destroyers , but five Boeing B @-@ 17 Flying Fortresses did . Isokaze escaped , despite a near @-@ miss , but Yayoi sank after taking a direct hit on the stern that set her on fire . Her survivors reached Normanby Island , where they found themselves in a similar predicament to their compatriots on Goodenough Island . After the attack , Isokaze returned to the area where Yayoi had gone down , finding an oil slick , but no survivors . On 22 September , Isokaze returned again , this time with the destroyer Mochizuki , and together they found 10 survivors in a launch . The two destroyers then searched the coast of Normanby Island without success . However , the next day , another 10 survivors were spotted by a patrol plane , and they were rescued on 26 September . 
 The presence of shipwrecked Japanese sailors on Normanby Island presented no military threat to the Allied forces at Milne Bay , but Captain A. T. Timperley , the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit ( ANGAU ) officer responsible for the D 'Entrecasteaux and Trobriand Islands , argued that they posed a threat to the native population and Australia 's reputation as its protector . As a result , C Company , 2 / 10th Infantry Battalion , under the command of Captain J. <unk> , was ordered to land on Normanby Island . Leaving Gili Gili on the destroyer HMAS Stuart on 21 September , <unk> 's company landed at Nadi Nadi on 22 September , and experienced no opposition . It took eight Japanese as prisoners before returning to Milne Bay on Stuart on 23 September . 
 Meanwhile , messages and food supplies had been air dropped by the Japanese to the troops on Goodenough on 10 and 12 September . On 3 October , the submarine I @-@ 1 arrived at Goodenough Island , and dropped off rations , ammunition , medical supplies , a radio and a landing craft . It took 71 sick or wounded men , all it could carry , back to Rabaul , along with the bodies of 13 dead . This left 285 Japanese troops on the island , most of whom were suffering from malaria . I @-@ 1 returned on 13 October with more rations and medical supplies , and a second landing craft , but was driven off by an Allied aircraft that dropped a flare . On 15 October , they received a radio message warning that the Allies were showing considerable interest in Goodenough Island and were likely to invade . 
 The Allied Supreme Commander of the South West Pacific Area , General Douglas MacArthur , issued new orders on 1 October : 
 Our Forces in the Southwest Pacific Area [ will ] attack with the immediate objective of driving the Japanese to the northward of the Kumusi River line . The New Guinea Force will : 
 Advance along the axes <unk> – Kokoda – Wairopi and Rigo – <unk> – Jaure – Wairopi and / or Abau – <unk> – Jaure – Wairopi Trail , both inclusive , with the objective of securing the line of the Kumusi River from <unk> Divide to the crossing of the Kokoda – Buna Trail , both inclusive . 
 Occupy and hold Goodenough Island and the north coast of Southeastern New Guinea south of Cape Nelson in such force as to deny these areas to the Japanese forces . 
 Upon securing these objectives , all land forces will prepare for further advance to secure the area Buna – Gona upon further orders of this Headquarters . 
 = = Battle = = 
 As part of an operation codenamed " Drake " , the 2 / 12th Infantry Battalion , a Second Australian Imperial Force unit from the 18th Infantry Brigade , which was composed mainly of men from Queensland and Tasmania , was selected to invade Goodenough Island . Its commanding officer , Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Arnold , as the commander of Drake Force , was ordered to destroy the Japanese force there , re @-@ establish the coastwatching and radar warning posts , and reconnoitre the island for airfield sites . Intelligence reports indicated that there were approximately 300 Japanese troops on the island , mainly concentrated in the <unk> Bay – Kilia Mission area in the south east . The Japanese were believed to be short of food and ammunition , and suffering from malnutrition and disease . 
 Boarding the destroyers HMAS Stuart and Arunta on 22 October , the Australian troops were transported to Goodenough Island escorted by Task Force 44 . Arriving that night , the battalion disembarked on both sides of the island 's southern tip . It was planned to trap the Japanese between the main force of 520 troops , commanded by Arnold , which landed at Mud Bay , and a smaller force of 120 men , mostly from C Company , commanded by Major Keith Gatewood , which landed at Taleba Bay , about 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) away . Australian landing craft were unavailable , but the 2 / 12th Infantry Battalion had three ketches , the <unk> , Maclaren King and <unk> , three Japanese landing craft that had been captured in the Battle of Milne Bay , and two powered whaleboats . Seven days ' rations were carried on these craft , and another seven days ' on the two destroyers . Each man carried three days ' rations . 
 Drake Force had two AWA 3B Wireless Sets for maintaining communication with Milne Force . One was taken to Mud Bay while the other remained on Arunta . Two Army No. 101 Wireless Sets enabled battalion headquarters to communicate with Mud Bay . In addition , each company had an Army No. 108 Wireless Set to talk to battalion headquarters . 
 The Mud Bay force travelled in Arunta and came ashore at 23 : 00 in the Maclaren King , two of the ship 's launches , the three Japanese landing craft and the two powered whaleboats . A base was established ashore at Mud Bay , where a dressing station was prepared and heavy equipment , including all but one 2 @-@ inch mortar per company , was cached . The Australians then set out on a gruelling march to Kilia . As they did so , a violent thunderstorm broke , and it started to rain heavily . The force pushed on toward Kilia , but made slow progress that night due to the steep terrain and heavy rain . They were still half a mile from Kilia at 08 : 30 on 23 October , when they encountered the Japanese . 
 The Australians were crossing a creek behind which was a steep hill . The Japanese commander waited until the Australians were almost at his position before opening fire with machine guns and mortars . The troops who had crossed the creek found hand grenades were being rolled down the hill at them ; those behind it were pinned down by heavy and accurate fire . Arnold decided to pull back . That night , he formed a defensive position , and beat off a small Japanese counterattack . 
 Meanwhile , the Taleba Bay force , which travelled on Stuart , and came ashore in <unk> , a ship 's launch and a ship 's whaleboat , was ashore by 03 : 30 on 23 October . They captured a Japanese machine gun position at about 06 : 00 . Two platoons went south where they were engaged by Japanese forces . The Japanese were driven beyond <unk> Creek , but a heavy Japanese counterattack from the north at 09 : 00 inflicted casualties on the Australians and forced them to withdraw from the area . Gatewood broke radio silence and attempted to contact Arnold on the 108 set , but was unable to reach him . After this , they came under heavy mortar and machine gun fire , which inflicted heavy casualties . Having lost six men killed and ten wounded , with three more posted as missing , the Australians were forced to fall back under pressure from the pursuing Japanese . Lieutenant Clifford <unk> would later receive the Military Cross for silencing a Japanese machine gun in the ensuing fighting . Faced with being overrun , Gatewood withdrew his force even further , at first back to Taleba Bay , and then to Mud Bay aboard Stuart , arriving on 24 October . 
 Gatewood could not get through on the radio because the petrol generator that supplied power to the radios at Mud Bay had broken down , thereby cutting Arnold 's link with Mud Bay , Milne Force and Taleba Bay . Arnold launched an attack on Kilia at 09 : 10 , supported by two 3 @-@ inch mortars and 100 rounds that had been brought up from Mud Bay . A promised air strike failed to arrive . Instead , Japanese aircraft strafed the Australian positions , as well as the ketch McLaren King in Mud Bay . It had some wounded men on board , and further casualties were caused . Arnold attempted a flanking movement with A Company , but it became lost in the jungle . The attack then became a frontal one against the main Japanese defences , which Arnold chose not to press . 
 With the Australian forces unable to advance , the Japanese were able to withdraw during the night . They were transported , along with their equipment and supplies , by the two landing craft to Fergusson Island , where they arrived at dawn on 25 October . From there , 261 men were collected by the light cruiser Tenryū the following day . The 2 / 12th Infantry Battalion then pressed on from Kilia to <unk> Bay , meeting no resistance and finding well @-@ prepared but unmanned defences . 
 The bombing and strafing of native villages by the Allied Air Forces caused some 600 Goodenough Islanders to flee to Fergusson Island , where Timperley 's ANGAU detachment had set up a refugee camp , and cared for them until the fighting was over and they could safely return . Australian losses on Goodenough Island were 13 killed in action or died of wounds , and 19 wounded . The Japanese suffered 20 killed and 15 wounded during the battle , but the 2 / 12th counted 39 dead . However , this was only an estimate as the Japanese had been able to retrieve and bury their dead , which had made it difficult for the Australians to accurately determine their casualties . Despite the evacuation , a number of Japanese were left behind . One was captured by islanders on 30 October and handed over to Timperley . There was also a group of three , of which two died from malaria in November 1942 , and the third , Shigeki Yokota , was taken prisoner in July 1943 .

 = = = Deception = = = 
 Two American officers , one each from the Air Corps and the Corps of Engineers , had accompanied the 2 / 12th Infantry Battalion 's landing on Goodenough Island with the mission of locating suitable sites for airbases and air warning facilities . They found good sites around Vivigani and <unk> . The Vivigani site was cleared by local labourers who established a 4 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) by 100 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) emergency fighter landing strip . The 1st Battalion , 91st Engineer General Service Regiment was assigned the task of developing Vivigani Airfield into a major airbase capable of handling heavy bombers . The 2 / 12th Infantry Battalion remained on the island until the end of December , eventually being shipped to Oro Bay on the night of 28 – 29 December to join the attack on Buna on 31 December , leaving 75 men behind . The American engineers were withdrawn to Port Moresby . 
 Without the engineers , the plans to develop Goodenough Island had to be postponed . Due to the strategic importance of the island for the forthcoming operations against the Imperial Japanese forces in the South West Pacific Area , the small Australian occupation force used deception and camouflage to make the Japanese believe that a brigade @-@ sized force was occupying the island . They fabricated dummy structures , including a hospital , anti @-@ aircraft guns constructed of simple logs pointed at the sky , and barricades of jungle vines which looked like barbed wire . They also lit fires to appear as cooking fires for large numbers of soldiers , and sent messages in easily broken codes consistent with a brigade . 
 = = = Garrison = = = 
 A new garrison , the Australian 47th Infantry Battalion , a Militia unit under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Henry Tasker , arrived from Milne Bay on 4 March 1943 . This became the major component of Drake Force , which also included a company of the 4th Field Ambulance , C Troop of the 2 / 10th Field Battery , B Troop of the 2 / 17th Light Anti @-@ Aircraft Battery , a section of the 11th Field Company , and detachments of signals , workshop and camouflage units . In all , Drake Force had a total strength of about 720 men . On 5 and 6 March , Japanese bombers attacked ships in the anchorage , and the airstrip and village at Vivigani , but caused no damage and only wounded two men . 
 In the aftermath of the Battle of the Bismarck Sea , Japanese troops and sailors were again shipwrecked on Goodenough Island . Responding to reports from ANGAU , the police and civilian informants , patrols searched the island for Japanese survivors . In a week of vigorous patrolling between 8 and 14 March 1943 , the 47th Infantry Battalion located and killed 72 Japanese , captured 42 , and found another nine dead on a raft . A remarkable coup was achieved by a patrol under Captain Joseph Pascoe that killed eight Japanese who had landed in two flat @-@ bottomed boats . In the boats they found some documents in sealed tins . On translation by the Allied Translator and Interpreter Section , one document turned out to be a copy of the Japanese Army List , with the names and postings of every officer in the Japanese Army . It therefore provided a complete order of battle of the Japanese Army , including many units that had never been reported before . Moreover , a mention of any Japanese officer could now be correlated with his unit . Copies were made available to intelligence units in every theatre of war against Japan .

 Meanwhile , a four @-@ man survey party from No. 5 Mobile Works Squadron RAAF arrived on Goodenough Island on 3 January 1943 . They selected Beli Beli Bay as a suitable site for an anchorage . Here , a 5 @,@ 000 ton ( 14 @,@ 000 m3 ) ship could anchor half a mile ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) offshore with a some degree of shelter from the south east and north west . A member of the survey team and 100 local workers recruited by ANGAU began constructing a jetty at Beli Beli Bay and improving the foot track to Vivigani . An advance party of 54 men from No. 5 Mobile Works Squadron arrived on 27 February 1943 . 
 Plans for Operation Chronicle , the invasion of Woodlark and Kiriwina Islands , called for fighter cover from Goodenough Island . The operation was scheduled for June 1943 , so the pace of construction work was lifted . The rest of No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron arrived in late March , followed by No. 7 Mobile Works Squadron in April . A 5 @,@ 100 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 600 m ) fighter strip was completed and sealed with a mixture of gravel and bitumen . P @-@ 40 Kittyhawks of No. 77 Squadron RAAF arrived on 12 June . It was joined by No. 76 Squadron RAAF and No. 79 Squadron RAAF on 16 June , and No. 73 Wing RAAF assumed control of the three fighter squadrons on the island . A 6 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) by 100 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) bomber strip was completed on 20 October , although No. 30 Squadron RAAF had already commenced operations from the strip on 10 October . Work on the airbase at Vivigani continued until November , by which time there were taxiways and dispersal areas for 24 heavy and 60 medium bombers , and 115 fighters . No. 7 Mobile Works Squadron also built two wharves for Liberty ships . 
 The island , now codenamed " Amoeba " , became a staging point and supply base for operations in New Guinea and New Britain , and USASOS Sub Base C was established on the island on 27 April 1943 . Sub Base C was abolished in July when responsibility for Goodenough Island passed to Alamo Force , whose headquarters opened on Goodenough Island on 15 August . From there , it directed operations in the Battles of <unk> and Cape Gloucester , and the landing at Saidor . 
 In August 1943 , Goodenough Island was chosen as the site for a number of hospitals to treat casualties incurred as Allied forces advanced through the Pacific . Work on the 750 @-@ bed 360th Station Hospital commenced on 15 September 1943 , followed by the 1 @,@ 000 @-@ bed 9th General Hospital on 4 November . A staging area for 60 @,@ 000 troops was also established on the island . Thousands of American troops later passed through Goodenough Island before the base was wound up at the end of 1944 .

 = Panzer 35 ( t ) = 
 The Panzerkampfwagen 35 ( t ) , commonly shortened to Panzer 35 ( t ) or abbreviated as Pz.Kpfw. 35 ( t ) , was a Czechoslovak @-@ designed light tank used mainly by Nazi Germany during World War II . The letter ( t ) stood for <unk> ( German : " Czech " ) . In Czechoslovak service , it had the formal designation Lehký tank vzor 35 ( Light Tank Model 35 ) , but was commonly referred to as the LT vz . 35 or LT @-@ 35 . A total of 434 were built ; of these , the Germans seized 244 when they occupied Bohemia @-@ Moravia in March 1939 and the Slovaks acquired 52 when they declared independence from Czechoslovakia at the same time . Others were exported to Bulgaria and Romania . In German service , it saw combat during the early years of World War II , notably the Invasion of Poland , the Battle of France and the invasion of the Soviet Union before being retired or sold off in 1942 . It was used for the remainder of the war by other countries and as a training tank in Bulgaria into the 1950s . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Panzerkampfwagen 35 ( t ) was assembled from a framework of steel " angle iron " beams to which the armor plates were riveted . A 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 16 in ) firewall separated the engine compartment from the crew . It had several mesh @-@ covered openings to allow access to the engine and improve ventilation by drawing air in through the commander 's hatch . This had the advantage of rapidly dispersing gun combustion gases when firing , but several disadvantages . The constant draft generated by the engine greatly affected the crew during cold weather , the danger of an engine fire reaching the crew compartment was increased and the engine noise and heat increased crew fatigue . 
 The driver sat on the right side of the tank using a 390 by 90 millimetres ( 15 @.@ 4 in × 3 @.@ 5 in ) observation port protected by 50 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) of bulletproof glass and an armored shutter 28 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 1 in ) thick . To his right was a vision slit 120 by 3 millimetres ( 4 @.@ 72 in × 0 @.@ 12 in ) with a similar thickness of bulletproof glass . The Germans replaced the original three colored lights used by the Czechs to communicate with the driver with an intercom system . The radio operator sat on the left and had his own 150 by 75 millimetres ( 5 @.@ 9 in × 3 @.@ 0 in ) observation port with the same protection as the driver 's . His radios were mounted on the left wall of the hull . The hull machine gun was between the driver and radio operator in a ball mount capable of 30 ° of traverse , 25 ° of elevation and depressing up to 10 ° . Most of the machine gun 's barrel protruded from the mount and was protected by an armored trough . The mount had a spotting telescope , but open sights could be used if the plug at the top of the ball mount was removed . If necessary , the driver could lock the mount into position and fire it himself using a Bowden cable . The driver 's hatch was exposed to direct fire and could be damaged from the front . 
 The turret ring had a diameter of 1 @.@ 267 metres ( 49 @.@ 9 in ) . The turret had a flat face in the center of which was mounted the 3 @.@ 72 centimetres ( 1 @.@ 46 in ) main armament . On the right side was another 7 @.@ 92 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 312 in ) machine gun in a ball mount . The commander had four episcopes in his cupola and a monocular mirror , 1 @.@ 3 x 30 ° periscope which he could extend , once he had removed its armored cover in his hatch , to give vision while " buttoned @-@ up " . As the sole occupant of the turret , the commander was responsible for loading , aiming and firing the main gun and the turret machine gun while simultaneously commanding the tank . The Germans added an extra crewman on the right side of the turret to load the main gun and to operate the turret machine gun . Some ammunition had to be removed to accommodate him . 
 The 8 @.@ 62 @-@ litre ( 526 cu in ) Škoda T @-@ 11 / 0 four @-@ cylinder , water @-@ cooled engine produced 120 horsepower ( 89 kW ) at 1 @,@ 800 rpm . Two fuel tanks were fitted , the main tank with a capacity of 124 litres ( 33 US gal ) was on the left side of the engine and the 29 litres ( 7 @.@ 7 US gal ) auxiliary tank was on the other side . The engine could run on gasoline , an alcohol @-@ gasoline mixture , and " <unk> " ( an alcohol @-@ benzole mixture ) . It was mounted in the rear along with the six @-@ speed transmission which drove rear @-@ mounted drive sprockets . The suspension was derived from the Vickers 6 @-@ Ton tank ; eight small pairs of road wheels on four bogies per side , each pair of bogies sprung by a single leaf spring , a front idler wheel , and four track return wheels . An unsprung road wheel was located directly underneath the idler wheel to improve obstacle crossing . The transmission , brakes and steering were mechanically assisted with compressed air , reducing driver fatigue . This last feature proved problematic in the extreme conditions of the Eastern Front . 
 The main armament was a Škoda <unk> vz . 34 ( German designation " KwK 34 ( t ) " ) gun with a pepperpot muzzle brake and a prominent armored recoil cylinder above the barrel . Škoda called it the A3 . It fired a .815 kilograms ( 1 @.@ 80 lb ) armor @-@ piercing shell at 690 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 300 ft / s ) . It was credited with penetrating a plate inclined at 30 ° from the vertical 37 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) thick at 100 metres ( 110 yd ) , 31 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick at 500 metres ( 550 yd ) , 26 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 0 in ) thick at 1 @,@ 000 metres ( 1 @,@ 100 yd ) , and 22 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 87 in ) thick at 1 @,@ 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 yd ) . Kliment and <unk> quote penetration of a vertical plate 45 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) thick at 500 metres ( 550 yd ) . The machine gun 's ball mount could be coupled to the main gun or used independently . Both weapons could elevate 25 ° and depress 10 ° . They both used <unk> power sights with a 25 ° field of view . Initially the tank used Zbrojovka Brno ZB vz . 35 machine guns , but these were exchanged for ZB vz . 37s during 1938 . This was adopted by the Germans as the MG 37 ( t ) . 
 In German use , 72 rounds of 37 mm ammunition were carried . These were stored in 6 @-@ round boxes : three on the hull side wall , eight in the turret overhang and one ready box above the gun on the turret roof . For the machine gun , 1 @,@ 800 rounds of belted 7 @.@ 92 mm ammunition were carried . The machine gun ammunition was in 100 @-@ round belts , stored three to a box . In Czech service , the LT vz . 35 carried 78 rounds ( 24 AP and 54 HE ) and 2 @,@ 700 rounds of machine gun ammunition , the difference being removed to make room for the fourth crewmember in German service . The German command tank version ( Panzerbefehlswagen 35 ( t ) ) exchanged some ammunition - exactly how much isn 't known - for another radio set and a gyrocompass . It could be recognized by the prominent " clothesline " radio antenna mounted on the rear deck .

 The Czech Army formulated a requirement in the II @-@ a category of light cavalry tanks by the end of 1934 . <unk> Kolben @-@ <unk> proposed an improved version of its P @-@ II light tank already in service as the LT vz . 34 , but Škoda offered a new design that used the pneumatic system and engine earlier proved by its unsuccessful SU or S @-@ II light tank prototype . One prototype was ordered from each company for delivery during the summer of 1935 . Both tanks had the same armament and three @-@ man crew , but ČKD 's P @-@ II @-@ a was much smaller at 8 @.@ 5 tonnes ( 8 @.@ 4 long tons ; 9 @.@ 4 short tons ) and had only a maximum 16 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 63 in ) of armor while Škoda 's S @-@ II @-@ a weighed 10 @.@ 5 tonnes ( 10 @.@ 3 long tons ; 11 @.@ 6 short tons ) and had 25 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) of armor . The army thought that P @-@ II @-@ a was at the limit of its development while the S @-@ II @-@ a could be improved as needed . 
 The first production order for 160 LT vz . 35s , as the S @-@ II @-@ a was designated in Army service , was placed on 30 October 1935 and deliveries began in December 1936 . An additional order for 35 was made on 12 May 1936 and a follow @-@ on order placed for 103 more a month later . The total order for 298 tanks was split equally by Škoda Works and ČKD according to their cartel agreement . 
 Development was rushed and there were many defects in the LT vz . 35s . Many tanks had to be returned to the factories to be repaired . Most of these repairs involved the electrical system , not the complicated pneumatic system .

 In August 1936 , Romania placed an order for 126 ; the bulk of these were delivered from the end of 1938 by Škoda . Afghanistan ordered ten in 1940 ; but , these were sold instead to Bulgaria . Total production was 434 , including 298 for the Czechoslovak Army , 126 for Romania ( under the designation Škoda R @-@ 2 ) and ten for Bulgaria . The Wehrmacht used 218 vehicles captured from the Czechoslovak Army in March 1939 . Britain 's Alvis @-@ <unk> negotiated for a production license from September 1938 until March 1939 when the Nazi occupation made an agreement impossible . The Soviets were also interested so Škoda shipped the S @-@ II @-@ a prototype and one production LT vz . 35 to the proving grounds at Kubinka for evaluation . The Soviets were only interested in buying the prototype , but Škoda refused to sell unless a license was purchased as well , believing that the Soviets would simply copy the design and build it without paying any royalties .

 The T @-@ 11 was built to an Afghan order placed in 1940 and differed mainly in that it used an improved Škoda A @-@ 8 gun . Ten were built , but were sold to Bulgaria and delivered in the third quarter of 1940 . 
 The TACAM R @-@ 2 was a tank destroyer built by removing the turret and substituting a captured Soviet 76 @.@ 2 mm ( 3 @.@ 00 in ) USV field gun in its place . The gun and crew was protected by a thin , fixed , three @-@ sided , partially roofed casemate that used armor plate salvaged from captured Soviet tanks . The prototype was completed by September 1943 , although it used the older 76 @.@ 2 mm M @-@ 1936 F @-@ 22 field gun , and proved reasonably successful .

 The 298 LT vz . 35 tanks were assigned to the armored regiments belonging to the four Mobile ( <unk> ) Divisions between 1936 — 39 . Each regiment was supposed to detach three @-@ tank platoons to support the infantry divisions and border areas in times of crisis . These platoons were heavily used suppressing the protests and violence instigated by Konrad Henlein 's Sudeten German Party ( <unk> Partei - <unk> ) and the <unk> Freikorps ( paramilitary groups trained in Germany by SS @-@ instructors ) between May and October 1938 . 
 After the Munich Agreement , two tank battalions were sent to reinforce the 3rd Mobile Division in Slovakia . They were used to repel Hungarian and Polish border @-@ crossers , sometimes up to a battalion in strength . They screened the infantry when they had to evacuate southern Slovakia after the First Vienna Award on 2 November 1938 . 
 A company of nine LT vz . 35s was in <unk> when Carpatho @-@ Ukraine declared independence and Hungary invaded on 14 March 1939 . They bolstered the Czech defenses in front of <unk> before being forced to retreat into Slovakia by 17 March . They were turned over to Slovakia the next day . The S @-@ II @-@ a prototype and one LT vz . 35 tank were returning from testing in the Soviet Union when the fighting began . They detrained in <unk> and participated in a counterattack at <unk> , but the LT vz . 35 was damaged and captured by the Hungarians . The prototype was forced to retreat into Romania by 17 March , along with most of the other Czech troops in eastern Ruthenia . The Romanians returned it to Škoda six months later .

 In 1939 , following the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 , 244 vehicles of the Czechoslovak Army were seized by the Germans where they were known as the <unk> until January 1940 . In German service , they were used as substitutes for the Panzerkampfwagen III medium tank . They were assigned to the Panzer Battalion ( <unk> ) 65 ( 39 ) of the 1st Light ( leichte ) Division and the independent Panzer @-@ Regiment 11 ( 81 ) where they participated in the Invasion of Poland . 77 of these were lost during the campaign , mostly due to mechanical breakdowns , but only 7 of these were irreparable . From 1940 on , there had not been any spare parts available and tanks had to be completely rebuilt to remain operational . 
 The 1st Light Division absorbed the 11th Panzer @-@ Regiment and was redesignated as the 6th Panzer Division on 18 October 1939 . It took 132 Pz.Kpfw. 35 ( t ) s into the Battle of France where it was assigned to XXXXI Corps ( mot . ) for Panzergruppe von Kleist 's attack through the Ardennes 44 of these had been lost by the end of May . 35 replacements were issued on 3 June in preparation for Fall Rot , the attack on the remnants of the French Army that began the following day . A total of 62 Pz.Kpfw. 35 ( t ) s were either total write @-@ offs or were damaged beyond the ability of the field maintenance workshops to repair during the campaign . 
 For the invasion of the Soviet Union , 6th Panzer Division had 160 Pz.Kpfw. 35 ( t ) s. to support 4th Panzer Group 's drive on Leningrad . By 10 September 1941 , the division had only 102 operational Pz.Kpfw. 35 ( t ) , despite having received two replacements from Germany . Eight tanks were repairable , but 47 were total losses . By 31 October , only 34 were operational with another 41 requiring repair . On 30 November , all Pz.Kpfw. 35 ( t ) s were reported non @-@ operational . 
 The average distance driven is 12 @,@ 500 kilometres ( 7 @,@ 800 mi ) for the Pz.Kpfw. 35 ( t ) . The special situation in regard to repair the Pz.Kpfw. 35 ( t ) is well known . It is indeed deemed necessary to point out that repairs can only be accomplished by cannibalizing other Panzers because there are no longer any spare parts for the Pz.Kpfw. 35 ( t ) . This means that after retrieval of the Panzers that are scattered around the terrain , a maximum of 10 can actually be repaired out of the 41 Pz.Kpfw. 35 ( t ) reported as needing repair . The Pz.Kpfw. 35 ( t ) can no longer be rebuilt . All of the components are worn out . To be practical , maybe the armored hulls are still useable . 
 Due to the cessation of production of these tanks , and the absence of spare parts being made , it was decided that the summer campaign of 1941 was to be their last . The fighting in Russia exposed the vehicle 's unsuitability for cold weather operations and general unreliability . This weakness , in addition to their thin armor and inadequate firepower , resulted in the 6th Panzer Division being reequipped with German tanks on its withdrawal from Russia in April 1942 . All 26 remaining Panzer 35 ( t ) s still in working condition in 1942 were sold to Romania . Some vehicles had their turrets and hull machine guns removed so that the chassis could serve as a munition carrier or an artillery tractor , the Artillerie Schlepper and the <unk> 35 ( t ) . These had a towing capacity of 12 tonnes ( 12 long tons ; 13 short tons ) .

 Romania ordered 126 of the tanks on 14 August 1936 as the R @-@ 2 and received the first 15 , which had been diverted from the Czech order , in April – May 1937 to display in a parade . They suffered from numerous teething problems and the Romanians put a hold on production until these issues were resolved . The constantly changing Romanian demands didn 't help the situation , but they refused to accept any vehicles until trials were conducted in Romania . Three R @-@ 2s were shipped to Romania on 12 July 1938 for the trials , but Skoda knew which one would be chosen and prepared the vehicle well and it passed all tests . After disassembly and checks of the trial tank were completed , the Romanian commission approved the design on 23 August . In the meantime , the initial batch was returned to Skoda to be upgraded to current standards on 28 July . Shipments to Romania began on 1 September with 27 shipped before the Munich Crisis forced the Czechs to hold all remaining tanks in case they were needed . 5 finished tanks and 6 almost @-@ finished tanks were appropriated and shipped to Slovakia although they were quickly returned after the Munich Agreement was signed . The last shipment departed on 22 February 1939 . 
 The R @-@ 2s were assigned to the 1st Armored Regiment of the 1st Armored Division where they participated in Operation Barbarossa . The division was withdrawn from combat after the Battle of Odessa in 1941 . It returned to the front on 29 August 1942 with 109 R @-@ 2s . By the eve of the Soviet Stalingrad Counter @-@ offensive on 19 November the division could only muster 84 serviceable R @-@ 2s with as many as 37 unserviceable tanks stationed in the rear . The division was on the outer edges of the Stalingrad Pocket , but managed to breakthrough the western wing of the encirclement , although 77 R @-@ 2s were lost in the process . Only about a third of these were destroyed by the Soviets , the rest were either abandoned or broke down and couldn 't be recovered . One R @-@ 2 arrived from Romania during December as a reinforcement . The 1st Armored Division was ordered home in early January 1943 . 
 Despite the delivery of 26 Pz.Kpfw. 35 ( t ) s during 1942 , Romania could only muster 59 R @-@ 2 / Pz.Kpfw. 35 ( t ) s on 1 April and 30 August 1943 , but raised this to 63 by 25 March 1944 . There were 44 on hand on 19 July 1944 . By this time they were relegated to training duties with the 1st Training Armored Division . A company of R @-@ 2s was sent to Transnistria with the ad @-@ hoc <unk> Mixed Tank Group on 24 February 1944 , but it did not see combat before being withdrawn on 28 March 1944 . 
 A company of R @-@ 2s was assigned to the Popescu Armored Detachment after King Michael 's Coup and Romanian 's defection from the Axis at the end of August 1944 . The Detachment was tasked with preventing the German units stationed around Ploiești from breaking out to the north and finding refuge in Hungary . They accomplished their task and the R @-@ 2s were withdrawn from combat operations until the following year . Romania had concentrated all of its remaining tanks and armored fighting vehicles in the 2nd Armored Regiment in early 1945 as the unofficial Soviet arms embargo began to have effect . It had five R @-@ 2s on hand in early February 1945 when it was sent to the front , but the Soviets confiscated most of them when it arrived . Both R @-@ 2s were serviceable when the regiment entered Bratislava on 4 April 1945 , but these were probably destroyed when the regiment was virtually surrounded in Austria on 10 April because they are no longer listed among the regiment 's vehicles afterwards .

 = = = Slovakia = = = 
 The Slovak Army seized 52 LT vz . 35 tanks when they declared their independence from Czechoslovakia in March 1939 . They were organized into a battalion that was later incorporated into the Armored Regiment . Three of these tanks participated in the Slovak @-@ Hungarian War of March 1939 . One tank company participated in the invasion of Poland , but didn 't see any fighting . The Army upgraded the internal communications system of its tanks with German <unk> in 1941 , but it is unknown if they added a fourth crewman as did the Germans . When Slovakia joined the German invasion of the Soviet Union it sent a Mobile Group that included thirty LT vz . 35 . The Mobile Group was reinforced and reorganized in early July 1941 as the Mobile Brigade , also known as Brigade <unk> after its commander , and it mustered only twenty seven tanks despite seven reinforcements because breakdowns had caused ten to be evacuated back to Slovakia . This was due to a conspiracy among the Slovak tankers that the tanks would be needed to overthrow the regime at some point and couldn 't be wasted in combat against the Soviets . This caused a high incidence of crew sabotage to which the officers and maintainers turned a blind eye , which caused the tanks to be withdrawn to Slovakia at the beginning of August 1941 . On 1 January 1942 , the Slovaks had 49 LT vz . 35 on hand because three had been destroyed in the battle for <unk> earlier in the summer . However , of these 49 only seven were operational as part of the conspiracy to keep the tanks in Slovakia The LT vz . 35s were relegated to the training / reserve role by 1943 when the Germans began to supply more modern tanks to Slovakia . At least eight LT vz . 35s were used by the insurgents during the Slovak National Uprising in 1944 .

 = Pride and Prejudice ( 1995 TV series ) = 
 Pride and Prejudice is a six @-@ episode 1995 British television drama , adapted by Andrew Davies from Jane Austen 's 1813 novel of the same name . Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth starred as Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy . Produced by Sue Birtwistle and directed by Simon Langton , the serial was a BBC production with additional funding from the American A & E Network . BBC1 originally broadcast the 55 @-@ minute episodes from 24 September to 29 October in 1995 . The A & E Network aired the series in double episodes on three consecutive nights beginning 14 January 1996 . 
 Critically acclaimed and a popular success , Pride and Prejudice was honoured with several awards , including a BAFTA Television Award for Jennifer Ehle for " Best Actress " and an Emmy for " Outstanding Individual Achievement in Costume Design for a Miniseries or a Special " . The role of Mr Darcy elevated Colin Firth to stardom . A scene showing Firth in a wet shirt was recognised as " one of the most unforgettable moments in British TV history " . The New York Times called the adaptation " a witty mix of love stories and social conniving , cleverly wrapped in the ambitions and illusions of a provincial gentry " . The series inspired author Helen Fielding to write the popular Bridget Jones novels and their screen adaptations subsequently featured Firth as Bridget 's love interest Mark Darcy . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Episode 1 – Part One : Mr. Charles Bingley , a rich man from the north of England , settles down at Netherfield estate near Meryton village in Hertfordshire for the autumn . Mrs Bennet , unlike her husband , is excited at the prospect of marrying off one of her five daughters ( Jane , Elizabeth , Mary , Kitty , and Lydia ) to the newcomer . Bingley takes an immediate liking to Jane at a local country @-@ dance , while his best friend Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy , rumoured to be twice as rich , refuses to stand up with anyone including Elizabeth . Elizabeth 's poor impression of his character is confirmed at a later gathering at Lucas Lodge and she and Darcy verbally clash on the two nights she spends at Netherfield caring for the sick Jane . 
 Episode 2 – Part Two : A sycophantic clergyman named Mr. William Collins visits his cousins , the Bennets . He is the entailed heir of their home and estate , Longbourn , and intends to marry one of Mr. Bennet 's daughters . This is meant , on his part , as an act of benign goodwill towards the Bennets , because Mrs. Bennet and her unwed daughters will be rendered homeless once Mr. Bennet dies and Mr. Collins inherits the estate . He therefore invites himself for a two @-@ week visit , to get to know the Bennets better and select a wife from among the daughters of the family . However , the Bennet girls judge Mr. Collins to be a rather ridiculous man , an " oddity " with many peculiarities of speech and deportment . They are nevertheless civil to him , and take him to balls and social events in Meryton . One day , while on a walk around Meryton village , they meet members of a newly arrived militia , including a Mr George Wickham . At a social event , Wickham befriends Elizabeth and tells her that Darcy , who is the son of Wickham 's late father 's employer , has denied Wickham a living ( a curacy ) which had been assured to him by Mr. Darcy 's father . At another social event , Darcy surprises Elizabeth with a dance offer at a ball at Netherfield , which she grudgingly but politely accepts . Mr Collins proposes to Elizabeth the next day , but she resoundingly rejects him . While Mrs Bennet disagrees about Elizabeth 's decision , her close friend Charlotte Lucas invites Mr Collins to stay at Lucas Lodge . 
 Episode 3 – Part Three : Elizabeth is stunned and appalled when she learns that Charlotte Lucas has accepted a proposal from Mr Collins . When the Netherfield party departs for London in autumn , Jane stays with her modest London relatives , the Gardiners , but she soon notices that the <unk> ignore her . After befriending Mr Wickham , Elizabeth departs for the Collinses ' home in Kent in the spring . They live near Rosings , the estate of the formidable Lady Catherine de Bourgh , and as Lady Catherine is Darcy 's aunt , Elizabeth meets Darcy several times . Shortly after Elizabeth learns of Darcy 's direct responsibility for Jane and Bingley 's separation , Darcy unexpectedly proposes to her , expressing his ardent admiration and love despite Elizabeth 's inferior family connections . Elizabeth flatly rejects him , noting his arrogant , disagreeable , and proud character , and his involvement in her sister 's failed romance and Mr Wickham 's misfortune . 
 Episode 4 – Part Four : Darcy justifies his previous actions in a long letter to Elizabeth : he misjudged Jane 's affection for Bingley and exposes Wickham as a gambler who once attempted to elope with his young sister , Georgiana , to obtain her inheritance . Back at Longbourn , Mr Bennet allows Lydia to accompany the militia to Brighton as a personal friend of the militia colonel 's wife . Elizabeth joins the Gardiners on a sightseeing trip to Derbyshire and visits Pemberley , Darcy 's estate , during his absence . Greatly impressed by the immense scale and richness of the estate , Elizabeth listens to the housekeeper 's earnest tales of her master 's lifelong goodness , while Darcy refreshes from his unannounced journey home by taking a swim in a lake . After an unexpected and awkward encounter with Elizabeth , a damp Darcy is able to prevent the party 's premature departure with an unusual degree of friendliness and politeness . 
 Episode 5 – Part Five : Elizabeth and the Gardiners receive an invitation to Pemberley , where Darcy and Elizabeth share significant glances . The next morning , Elizabeth receives two letters from Jane , discussing Lydia 's elopement with Wickham . As Elizabeth is about to return to Longbourn , Darcy walks in and offers his help , but , upon digesting the bad news , gradually appears more remote , and soon takes his leave . Elizabeth supposes she will never see him again . Mr and Mrs Bennet try to deal with the possible scandal until they receive a letter from Mr Gardiner , saying that Lydia and Wickham have been found and are not married , but will be soon under the Gardiners ' care . After Mr Bennet states his surprise at how easily the issue has been resolved , Elizabeth informs Jane about her last meeting with Darcy , including her ambivalent feelings for him . 
 Episode 6 – Part Six : After Lydia carelessly mentions Darcy 's involvement in her wedding , Mrs Gardiner enlightens Elizabeth how Darcy found the errant couple and paid for all the expenses . When Bingley and Darcy return to Netherfield in the autumn , Darcy apologises to Bingley for intervening in his relationship with Jane and gives his blessing for the couple to wed . Lady Catherine de Bourgh , who has heard rumours of an engagement between Darcy and Elizabeth but wants him to marry her sickly daughter Anne , pays Elizabeth an unannounced visit . She insists that Elizabeth renounce Darcy , but Elizabeth does not rule out a future engagement . When Elizabeth thanks Darcy for his role in Lydia 's marriage , Lady Catherine 's story encourages Darcy to reconfirm his feelings for Elizabeth . Elizabeth admits the complete transformation of her feelings and agrees to an engagement , which takes her family by surprise . The series ends with a double wedding in the winter months : Jane with Bingley , and Elizabeth to Fitzwilliam Darcy . 
 = = Cast = = 
 When casting the many characters of Pride and Prejudice , the producer Sue Birtwistle and director Simon Langton were looking for actors with wit , charm and charisma , who could also play the Regency period . Their choices for the story 's protagonists , 20 @-@ year @-@ old Elizabeth Bennet and 28 @-@ year @-@ old Mr Darcy , determined the other actors cast . Hundreds of actresses between 15 and 28 auditioned , and those with the right presence were screen @-@ tested , performing several prepared scenes in period costumes and makeup in a television studio . Straight offers were made to several established actors . 
 Actress Jennifer Ehle was chosen out of half a dozen serious candidates to play Elizabeth , the second Bennet daughter , the brightest girl , and her father 's favourite . At the time in her mid @-@ 20s , Ehle had first read Pride and Prejudice at the age of 12 and was the only actor to be present throughout the whole filming schedule . Sue Birtwistle particularly wanted Colin Firth , a relatively unknown British actor in his mid @-@ 30s at the time , to play the wealthy and aloof Mr. Darcy . Birtwistle had worked with him on the mid @-@ 1980s comedy film Dutch Girls , but he repeatedly turned down her offer as he neither felt attracted to Austen 's feminine perspective nor believed himself to be right for the role . Birtwistle 's persistent coaxing and his deeper looks into the Darcy character finally convinced him to accept the role . Firth and Ehle began a romantic relationship during the filming of the series , which only received media attention after the couple 's separation . 
 Benjamin Whitrow and BAFTA @-@ nominated Alison Steadman were cast to play Mr and Mrs Bennet , Elizabeth 's distinguished but financially imprudent and occasionally self @-@ indulgent parents . Steadman was offered the role without auditions or screen tests . Elizabeth 's four sisters , whose ages ranged between 15 and 22 , were cast to look dissimilar from each other . Susannah Harker portrayed Elizabeth 's beautiful older sister Jane , who desires to only see good in others . Lucy Briers , Polly Maberly , and Julia Sawalha played Elizabeth 's younger sisters – the plain Mary , the good @-@ natured but flighty and susceptible Kitty , and frivolous and headstrong Lydia . Being 10 years older than 15 @-@ year @-@ old Lydia , Julia Sawalha , of Absolutely Fabulous fame , had enough acting experience to get the role without screen tests . Joanna David and Tim <unk> appeared as the Gardiners , Elizabeth 's maternal aunt and uncle . David Bamber played the sycophantic clergyman , Mr Collins , a cousin of Mr Bennet . Lucy Scott portrayed Elizabeth 's best friend and Mr Collins 's wife , Charlotte Lucas , and David Bark @-@ Jones portrayed Lt. Denny . 
 The producers found Crispin Bonham @-@ Carter to have the best physical contrast to Firth 's Darcy and gave him his first major television role as the good @-@ natured and wealthy Mr Charles Bingley . Bonham @-@ Carter had originally auditioned for the part of Mr George Wickham , a handsome militia lieutenant whose charm conceals his licentiousness and greed , but Adrian Lukis was cast instead . Anna Chancellor , of Four Weddings and a Funeral fame , played Mr Bingley 's sister Caroline Bingley . ( Chancellor is also Jane Austen 's niece by eight generations . ) Mr Bingley 's other sister and his brother @-@ in @-@ law were played by Lucy Robinson ( Louisa Hurst ) and Rupert Vansittart ( Mr Hurst ) . Casting the role of Darcy 's young sister , Georgiana , proved hard as the producers were looking for a young actress who appeared innocent , proud and yet shy , had class and could also play the piano . After auditioning over 70 actresses , Simon Langton suggested Emilia Fox , the real @-@ life daughter of Joanna David ( Mrs Gardiner ) , for the part . Barbara Leigh @-@ Hunt was cast as Darcy 's meddling aunt , Lady Catherine de Bourgh , without auditions or screen tests .

 = = = Conception and adaptation = = = 
 Jane Austen 's novel Pride and Prejudice had already been the subject of numerous television and film adaptations , including BBC television versions in 1938 , 1952 , 1958 , 1967 and 1980 . In the autumn of 1986 , after watching a preview of Austen 's Northanger Abbey , Sue Birtwistle and Andrew Davies agreed to adapt Pride and Prejudice , one of their favourite books , for television . Birtwistle in particular felt that a new adaptation on film would serve the drama better than the previous videotaped Pride and Prejudice television adaptations , which looked too " undernourished " and " unpoetic " . The needs of TV scheduling forced Davies to change his original plan of a five @-@ episode adaptation to six . Birtwistle and Davies then offered the first three scripts to ITV in late 1986 to build on the guaranteed BBC audience , but the recent TV adaptation led to a delay . When ITV announced its renewed interest in 1993 , Michael Wearing of the BBC commissioned the final scripts with co @-@ funding from the American A & E Network . Director Simon Langton and the art department joined pre @-@ production in January and February 1994 . 
 Although Birtwistle and Davies wished to remain true to the tone and spirit of the novel , they wanted to produce " a fresh , lively story about real people " , not an " old studio @-@ bound BBC drama that was shown in the Sunday <unk> slot " . Emphasising sex and money as the themes of the story , Davies shifted the focus from Elizabeth to Elizabeth and Darcy and foreshadowed Darcy 's role in the narrative resolution . To portray the characters as real human beings , Davies added short backstage scenes such as the Bennet girls dressing up to advertise themselves in the marriage market . New scenes where men pursue their hobbies with their peers departed from Jane Austen 's focus on women . The biggest technical difficulty proved to be adapting the long letters in the second half of the story . Davies employed techniques such as voice @-@ overs , flashbacks , and having the characters read the letters to themselves and to each other . Davies added some dialogue to clarify events from the novel to a modern audience but left much of the novel 's dialogue intact . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Director of photography John <unk> used Super 16mm film , which has a slightly smaller widescreen aspect ratio than 16 : 9 , but the series was originally broadcast 4 : 3 pan and scan . 
 The budget of about £ 1 million per episode ( totalling US $ 9 @.@ 6 million ) allowed 20 shooting weeks of five days to film six 55 @-@ minute episodes . Production aimed for 10 @.@ 5 @-@ hour shooting days plus time for costume and make @-@ up . Two weeks before filming began , about 70 of the cast and crew gathered for the script read @-@ through , followed by rehearsals , lessons for dancing , horse @-@ riding , fencing , and other skills that needed to be ready ahead of the actual filming . Filming took place between June 1994 and 1 November 1994 to reflect the changing seasons in the plot , followed by post @-@ production until mid @-@ May 1995 . Scenes in the same place were grouped in the filming schedule . 
 Twenty @-@ four locations , most of them owned by the National Trust , and eight studio sets were used for filming . Reflecting the wealth differences between the main characters , the filming location for Longbourn showed the comfortable family house of the Bennet family , whereas Darcy 's Pemberley needed to look like the " most beautiful place " , showing good taste and the history of the aristocracy . The first location that the producers agreed on was Lacock in Wiltshire to represent the village of Meryton . <unk> Court nearby served as the interior and exterior of Longbourn . Lyme Hall in Cheshire was chosen as Pemberley but management problems forced production to film Pemberley 's interiors at Sudbury Hall in Sudbury , Derbyshire . 
 The producers found Belton House in Grantham , Lincolnshire the best match for Rosings , Lady Catherine de Bourgh 's estate , which needed to appear " over @-@ the @-@ top " to reflect her <unk> . Old Rectory at <unk> in Rutland was chosen as Hunsford parsonage , Mr Collins 's modest home . <unk> House in south @-@ west Northamptonshire served as the interior and exterior of Bingley 's Netherfield , along with Brocket Hall in Welwyn Garden City , Hertfordshire as the Netherfield ballroom . The London streets were filmed in Lord Leycester Hospital in Warwick , Warwickshire . Wickham 's and Georgiana 's planned elopement in Ramsgate was filmed in the English seaside resort Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare in Somerset . 
 = = = Costumes and make @-@ up = = = 
 Because Pride and Prejudice was a period drama , the design required more research than contemporary films . The personality and wealth of the characters were reflected in their costumes ; the wealthy Bingley sisters were never shown in print dresses and they wore big feathers in their hair . As the BBC 's stock of early 19th century costumes was limited , costume designer Dinah Collin designed most of the costumes , visiting museums for inspiration while trying to make the clothes attractive to a modern audience ( although some costumes , mostly worn by extras , were re @-@ used from earlier BBC productions or hired ) . Elizabeth 's clothes had earthy tones and were fitted to allow easy and natural movements in line with the character 's activity and liveliness . In contrast , Collin chose pale or creamy white colours for the clothes of the other Bennet girls to highlight their innocence and simplicity and richer colours for Bingley 's sisters and Lady Catherine de Bourgh . Colin Firth participated in the wardrobe decisions and wanted his character to wear darker colours , leaving the warmer colours for Bingley . 
 The producers imagined Darcy to be dark despite no such references in the novel and asked Firth to dye black his light @-@ brown hair , eyebrows and lashes ; they instructed all male actors to let their hair grow before filming and shave off their moustaches . Three brunette wigs were made to cover Ehle 's short , blonde hair and one wig for Alison Steadman ( Mrs. Bennet ) because of her thick , heavy hair . Susannah Harker 's ( Jane ) hair was slightly lightened to contrast with Elizabeth 's and was arranged in a classic Greek style to highlight the character 's beauty . Mary 's plainness was achieved by painting spots on Lucy Briers 's face ; her hair was greased to suggest an unwashed appearance and was arranged to emphasise the actress 's protruding ears . As Kitty and Lydia were too young and wild to have their hair done by the maids , the actresses ' hair was not changed much . Makeup artist Caroline Noble had always considered Mr. Collins a sweaty character with a moist upper lip ; she also greased David Bamber 's hair and gave him a low parting to suggest baldness . 
 = = = Music and choreography = = = 
 Carl Davis had been writing scores for BBC adaptations of classic novels since the mid @-@ 1970s and approached Sue Birtwistle during pre @-@ production . Aiming to communicate the wit and vitality of the novel and its theme of marriage and love in a small town in the early 19th century , he used contemporary classical music as inspiration , in particular a popular Beethoven septet of the period , as well as a theme strongly reminiscent of the finale of Beethoven 's Emperor Concerto . For control over the sound , the music was recorded in six hours by a group of up to 18 musicians and was then fed into tiny earpieces of the screen musicians , who mimed playing the instruments . The actresses whose characters played the piano , Lucy Briers ( Mary ) and Emilia Fox ( Georgiana ) , were already accomplished pianists and were given the opportunity to practise weeks ahead of filming . Among the songs and movements that were played in the serial were Handel 's " Air con <unk> " from Suite No. 5 in E Major HWV 430 and " Slumber , Dear Maid " from his opera Xerxes , Mozart 's " Rondo Alla <unk> " , " Voi Che <unk> " and other music from his operas The Marriage of Figaro and Don Giovanni , Beethoven 's Andante <unk> , the second movement from Muzio Clementi 's Sonatina No.4 and the traditional folk song " The Barley Mow " . A soundtrack with Davis 's themes was released on CD in 1995 . 
 Many scenes in the book were set at dances or balls . Jane Gibson based her choreography on The Apted Book of Country Dances ( 1966 ) by W.S. Porter , which had several late @-@ 18th @-@ century dances by Charles and Samuel Thompson such as " The Shrewsbury <unk> " , " A Trip to Highgate " and " Mr. Beveridge 's Maggot " . Although these dances gave the story an impression of authenticity , they were anachronistic , being out of fashion by the time of the story . Some fifteen dances were choreographed and rehearsed before filming . Polly Maberly and Julia Sawalha , the dance @-@ mad Kitty and Lydia , had three days to learn the dances . Three days were allotted for the filming of the ball at Netherfield , whose pace and style concentrated on elegance rather than the community enjoying themselves as at the dance at Meryton . The musicians and dancers had earpieces with music playing to allow dialogue recording . Many wide @-@ shots of Elizabeth 's and Darcy 's dance at Netherfield later turned out to be unusable because of a hair in front of a lens so the editors resorted to close @-@ up shots and material provided by a steadicam . 
 = = Themes and style = = 
 The adaptation received praise for its faithfulness to the novel , which highlights the importance of environment and upbringing on peoples ' development , although privilege is not necessarily advantageous . Describing the adaptation as " a witty mix of love stories and social conniving , cleverly wrapped in the ambitions and illusions of a provincial gentry " , critics noted that Davies 's focus on sex and money and Austen 's wry , incisive humour and the " deft " characterisation , prevented the television adaptation from " descending into the realm of a nicely @-@ costumed , brilliantly @-@ photographed melodrama " . 
 To avoid a narrator , the serial delegates the novel 's first ironic sentence to Elizabeth in an early scene . The adaptation opens with a view of Darcy 's and Bingley 's horses as they race across a field toward the Netherfield estate , expressing vitality ; Elizabeth watches them before breaking into a run . While the novel indicates Elizabeth 's independence and energy in her three @-@ mile trek to Netherfield , the adaptation of this scene also shows her rebelliousness and love of nature . 
 In what is " perhaps the most radical revision of Austen 's text " , the BBC drama departs from a late 18th @-@ century vision of emotional restraint and portrays emotions in a " modern " interpretation of the story . The novel leaves Elizabeth and the reader uncertain of Darcy 's emotions and the adaptation uses additional scenes to hint at Darcy 's inability to physically contain or verbally express his emotional turmoil . On the other hand , whereas the climax of the novel describes Darcy expressing his ardent love for Elizabeth at length ( though Austen leaves his actual words to the reader 's imagination ) , the adaptation <unk> this moment and passes directly to the next lines of dialogue . Scholars argue that activities such as billiards , bathing , fencing and swimming ( see the lake scene ) offer Darcy to a female gaze ; he is often presented in profile by a window or a fireplace when his friends discuss Elizabeth . Many passages relating to appearance or characters ' viewpoints were lifted from the novel . 
 The novel shows irony with " unmistakable strains of cynicism , ... laughing at human nature without any real hope of changing it " . Laughter in the story , which ranges from irresponsible laughter to laughter at people and laughter of amusement and relief , can also be linked to the sexual tensions among the different characters . Despite their appeal to modern audiences , laughter and wit were seen as vulgar and irreverent in Austen 's time . The BBC drama made changes " with a view to exposing a character , or adding humour or irony to a situation " . The adaptation comically exaggerates the characters of Mrs. Bennet , Miss Bingley and Mr. Collins , even showing Mrs. Bennet on the verge of hysteria in many of the early scenes . 
 The serial expands on Austen 's metaphorical use of landscapes , reinforcing beauty and authenticity . Elizabeth takes every opportunity to enjoy nature and to escape exposure to Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine . The most symbolic use of nature in the novel is Elizabeth and the Gardiners ' visit to Pemberley in Derbyshire , where Elizabeth becomes conscious of her love for Darcy . The story makes nature integral in the form of Old England . Elizabeth 's appreciation of the beauties of Derbyshire elevates Darcy in her and her relatives ' opinion . Darcy 's gaze through the window works as a movie screen , projecting Elizabeth 's actions for him and the viewer . His participation in the English landscape is his redemption .

 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 The critical response to Pride and Prejudice was overwhelmingly positive . Gerard Gilbert of The Independent recommended the opening episode of the serial one day before the British premiere , saying the television adaptation is " probably as good as it [ can get for a literary classic ] . The casting in particular deserves a tilt at a BAFTA , Firth not being in the slightest bit soft and fluffy – and Jennifer Ehle showing the right brand of spirited intelligence as Elizabeth . " He considered Benjamin Whitrow a " real scene @-@ stealer with his Mr. Bennet " , but was undecided about Alison Steadman 's portrayal of Mrs. Bennet . Reviewing the first episode for the same newspaper on the day after transmission , Jim White praised Andrew Davies for " injecting into the proceedings a pace and energy which at last provides a visual setting to do justice to the wit of the book . With everyone slinging themselves about at high speed ( the dances , in a first for the genre , actually involve a bit of sweat ) , it looks like people are doing something you would never have suspected they did in Austen 's time : having fun . " 
 A few days before the American premiere , Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times considered the adaptation " decidedly agreeable " despite its incidental liberties with Austen 's novel , and named Elizabeth 's parents and Mr. Collins as the main source of humour . John O 'Connor of The New York Times lauded the serial as a " splendid adaptation , with a remarkably faithful and sensitively nuanced script " . He commented on Jennifer Ehle 's ability to make Elizabeth " strikingly intelligent and authoritative without being overbearing " , and noted how Firth " brilliantly captures Mr. Darcy 's snobbish pride while conveying , largely through intense stares , that he is falling in love despite himself " . O 'Connor praised Barbara Leigh @-@ Hunt 's portrayal of Lady Catherine as " a marvellously imperious witch " and considered her scenes with David Bamber ( Mr. Collins ) " hilarious " . 
 However , O 'Connor remarked that American audiences might find the " languorous walks across meadows " and " ornately choreographed dances " of the British production too slow . In one of the most negative reviews , People Magazine considered the adaptation " a good deal more thorough than necessary " and " not the best Austen on the suddenly crowded market " . Although the reviewer thought Firth " magnificent " , he rebuked the casting of Jennifer Ehle as her oval face made her " look like Anaïs Nin in period clothes , and that ain 't right " . The official A & E Network magazine summarised a year later that " critics praised the lavish production , audiences adored it , and women everywhere swooned over Darcy . So much , in fact , that newspapers began to joke about ' Darcy fever . ' " Commendation for the serial continued in the years following its original transmission .

 As one of the BBC 's and A & E 's most popular presentations ever , the serial was " a cultural phenomenon , inspiring hundreds of newspaper articles and making the novel a commuter favourite " . With the 1995 and 1996 films Persuasion , Sense and Sensibility and Emma , the serial was part of a wave of Jane Austen enthusiasm which caused the membership of the Jane Austen Society of North America to jump fifty percent in 1996 and to over 4 @,@ 000 members in the autumn of 1997 . Some newspapers like The Wall Street Journal explained this " Austen @-@ mania " as a commercial move of the television and film industry , whereas others attributed Austen 's popularity to escapism . 
 While Jennifer Ehle refused to capitalise on the success of the serial and joined the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon , the role of Mr. Darcy unexpectedly elevated Colin Firth to stardom . Although Firth did not mind being recognised as " a romantic idol as a Darcy with smouldering sex appeal " in a role that " officially turned him into a heart @-@ throb " , he expressed the wish to not be associated with Pride and Prejudice forever and was reluctant to accept similar roles . He took on diverse roles and co @-@ starred in productions such as The English Patient ( 1996 ) , Shakespeare in Love ( 1998 ) , Bridget Jones 's Diary ( 2001 ) , Girl with a Pearl Earring ( 2003 ) , Love Actually ( 2003 ) and Bridget Jones : The Edge of Reason ( 2004 ) . 
 Pride and Prejudice continued to be honoured years later . A 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the British Film Institute ranked the serial at 99 in the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century , which the BFI attributed to its " managing to combine faithfulness to the novel with a freshness that appealed across the generations " . Radio Times included the serial in their list of " 40 greatest TV programmes ever made " in 2003 . It was also named by Entertainment Weekly as one of the 20 best miniseries of all time . In 2007 , the UK Film Council declared Pride and Prejudice one of the television dramas that have become " virtual brochures " for British history and society . Lyme Hall , Cheshire , which had served as the exterior of Pemberley , experienced a tripling in its visitor numbers after the series ' broadcast and is still a popular travel destination . 
 = = = Lake scene = = = 
 The adaptation is famous for a scene in its fourth episode where a fully dressed Darcy , having emerged from a swim in a lake at Pemberley , accidentally encounters Elizabeth . While many critics attributed the scene 's appeal to Firth 's sexual attractiveness , Andrew Davies thought that it unwittingly " <unk> , not disrobed , Austen " . When Davies wrote the scene ( it was not part of Austen 's novel ) , he did not intend a sexual connection between Elizabeth and Darcy but to create " an amusing moment in which Darcy tries to maintain his dignity while improperly dressed and <unk> wet " . The BBC opposed Davies 's plan to have Darcy naked but the producers discarded the alternative of using underpants as fatuous . According to Davies , Firth had " a bit of the usual tension about getting [ his ] kit off " , the scene was filmed with Firth in linen shirt , breeches and boots . A stuntman , who appears in midair in a very brief shot , was hired because of the risk of infection with Weil 's disease at Lyme Park . A short underwater segment was filmed separately with Firth in a tank at Ealing Studios in west London . 
 The Guardian declared the lake scene " one of the most unforgettable moments in British TV history " . The sequence also appeared in Channel 4 's Top 100 TV Moments in 1999 , between the controversial programme Death on the Rock and the Gulf War . The New York Times compared the scene to Marlon Brando shouting " Stella ! " in his undershirt in A Streetcar Named Desire and Firth 's projects began alluding to it – screenwriter @-@ director Richard Curtis added in @-@ joke moments of Firth 's characters falling into the water to Love Actually and Bridget Jones : The Edge of Reason , and Firth 's character from the 2007 film St Trinian 's emerges from a fountain in a soaking wet shirt before meeting up with an old love . The creators of the 2008 ITV production Lost in Austen emulated the lake scene in their Pride and Prejudice through their contemporary heroine who cajoles Darcy into recreating the moment . 
 Cheryl L. Nixon suggested in Jane Austen in Hollywood that Darcy 's dive is a " revelation of his emotional capabilities " , expressing a " Romantic bond with nature , a celebration of his home where he can ' strip down ' to his essential self , a cleansing of social prejudices from his mind , or ... a rebirth of his love for Elizabeth " . Linda Troost and Sayre Greenfield wrote that the scene " tells us more about our current decade 's obsession with physical perfection and acceptance of gratuitous nudity than it does about Austen 's Darcy , but the image carves a new facet into the text " . 
 = = = Bridget Jones = = = 
 The fictional journalist Bridget Jones ( in reality Helen Fielding of The Independent ) wrote of her love of the serial in the paper 's Bridget Jones 's Diary column during the original British broadcast , mentioning her " simple human need for Darcy to get off with Elizabeth " and regarding the couple as her " chosen representatives in the field of shagging , or rather courtship " . Fielding loosely reworked the plot of Pride And Prejudice in her 1996 novel of the column , naming Bridget 's uptight love interest " Mark Darcy " and describing him exactly like Colin Firth . Following a first meeting with Firth during his filming of Fever Pitch in 1996 , Fielding asked Firth to collaborate in what would become a multi @-@ page interview between Bridget Jones and Firth in her 1999 sequel novel , Bridget Jones : The Edge of Reason . Conducting the real interview with Firth in Rome , Fielding lapsed into Bridget Jones mode and obsessed over Darcy in his wet shirt for the fictional interview . Firth participated in the editing of what critics called " one of the funniest sequences in the diary 's sequel " . Both novels make various other references to the BBC serial . 
 Andrew Davies collaborated on the screenplays for the 2001 and 2004 Bridget Jones films , in which Crispin Bonham @-@ Carter ( Mr. Bingley ) and Lucy Robinson ( Mrs. Hurst ) appeared in minor roles . The self @-@ referential in @-@ joke between the projects convinced Colin Firth to accept the role of Mark Darcy , as it gave him an opportunity to ridicule and liberate himself from his Pride and Prejudice character . Film critic James Berardinelli would later state that Firth " plays this part [ of Mark Darcy ] exactly as he played the earlier role , making it evident that the two Darcys are essentially the same " . The producers never found a way to incorporate the Jones @-@ Firth interview in the second film but shot a spoof interview with Firth as himself and Renée Zellweger staying in character as Bridget Jones after a day 's wrap . The scene , which extended Bridget 's Darcy obsession to cover Firth 's lake scene in Love Actually , is available as a bonus feature on the DVD . 
 = = = Other adaptations = = = 
 For almost a decade , the 1995 TV serial was considered " so dominant , so universally adored , [ that ] it has lingered in the public consciousness as a cinematic standard " . Comparing six Pride and Prejudice adaptations in 2005 , the Daily Mirror gave 9 / 10 to the 1995 serial ( " what may be the ultimate adaptation " ) and the 2005 film adaptation , leaving the other adaptations such as the 1940 film behind with six or fewer points . The 2005 film was " obviously [ not as ] daring or revisionist " as the 1995 adaptation but the youth of the film 's leads , Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen , was mentioned favourably over the 1995 cast , as Jennifer Ehle had formerly been " a little too ' heavy ' for the role " . The president of the Jane Austen Society of North America noted in an otherwise positive review that the casting of the 2005 leads was " arguably a little more callow than Firth and Ehle " and that " Knightley is better looking than Lizzy should strictly be " . The critical reception of <unk> 's Darcy , whose casting had proven difficult because " Colin Firth cast a very long shadow " , ranged from praise to pleasant surprise and dislike . Several critics did not observe any significant impact of Macfadyen 's Darcy in the following years . Garth Pearce of The Sunday Times noted in 2007 that " Colin Firth will forever be remembered as the perfect Mr. Darcy " , and Gene Seymour stated in a 2008 Newsday article that Firth was " ' universally acknowledged ' as the definitive Mr. Darcy " .

 The World Is Not Enough ( 1999 ) is the nineteenth film in the James Bond series , and the third to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond . The film was directed by Michael Apted , with the original story and screenplay written by Neal Purvis , Robert Wade and Bruce Feirstein . It was produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli . The title is taken from a line in the 1963 novel On Her Majesty 's Secret Service . 
 The film 's plot revolves around the assassination of billionaire Sir Robert King by the terrorist Renard , and Bond 's subsequent assignment to protect King 's daughter Elektra , who had previously been held for ransom by Renard . During his assignment , Bond unravels a scheme to increase petroleum prices by triggering a nuclear meltdown in the waters of Istanbul . 
 Filming locations included Spain , France , Azerbaijan , Turkey and the UK , with interiors shot at Pinewood Studios . Despite mixed critical reception , The World Is Not Enough earned $ 361 @,@ 832 @,@ 400 worldwide . It was also the first Eon @-@ produced Bond film to be officially released by Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer instead of United Artists , the original distributor . 
 = = Plot = = 
 MI6 agent James Bond meets a Swiss banker in Bilbao , Spain to retrieve money for Sir Robert King , a British oil tycoon and friend of M. Bond tells the banker that King was buying a report stolen from an MI6 agent who was killed for it , and wants to know who killed him . The banker is killed by his assistant before he can reveal the assassin 's name . Bond escapes with the money , but it is revealed to be booby @-@ trapped , and Sir Robert is killed by an explosion inside MI6 headquarters back in London . Bond gives chase to the assistant / assassin on a boat on the Thames to the Millennium Dome , where she attempts to escape via hot air balloon . Bond offers her protection , but she refuses , then causes the balloon to explode , killing herself . 
 Bond traces the recovered money to Renard , a KGB agent @-@ turned @-@ terrorist . Following an earlier attempt on his life by MI6 , Renard was left with a bullet in his brain which is gradually destroying his senses , making him immune to pain . M assigns Bond to protect King 's daughter , Elektra ; Renard previously abducted and held her for ransom , and MI6 believes that he is targeting her a second time . Bond flies to Azerbaijan , where Elektra is overseeing the construction of an oil pipeline . During a tour of the pipeline 's proposed route in the mountains , Bond and Elektra are attacked by a hit squad in armed , paraglider @-@ equipped snowmobiles . 
 Afterwards Bond visits Valentin Zukovsky at a casino to acquire information about Elektra 's attackers ; he discovers that Elektra 's head of security , Davidov , is secretly in league with Renard . Bond kills Davidov and boards a plane bound for a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan . He poses as a Russian nuclear scientist , meets American nuclear physicist Christmas Jones , and enters the silo . Inside , Renard is removing the GPS locator card and weapons @-@ grade plutonium from a nuclear bomb . Before Bond can kill him , Jones blows his cover . Renard drops a hint that he and Elektra are collaborating and flees with the plutonium , while Bond and Jones escape the exploding silo with the locator card . 
 Back in Azerbaijan , Bond discloses to M that Elektra may not be as innocent as she seems . An alarm sounds while he is handing M the locator card as proof of the theft , which reveals that the stolen bomb from Kazakhstan is attached to an inspection rig heading towards the oil terminal . Bond and Jones enter the pipeline to deactivate the bomb , and Jones discovers that half of the plutonium is missing . They both jump clear of the rig , a large section of pipeline is destroyed , and they are presumed killed . Back at the command centre , Elektra reveals she and Renard are conspirators and that she killed her father as revenge for using her as bait for Renard . She abducts M , whom she resents for advising her father not to pay the ransom money , and imprisons her in the Maiden 's Tower . 
 Bond accosts Zukovsky at his caviar factory in the Caspian Sea , which is then attacked by Elektra 's sawing helicopters . Later , Zukovsky reveals his arrangement with Elektra was in exchange for the use of a submarine , currently being captained by Zukovsky 's nephew , Nikolai . The group goes to Istanbul , where Jones realises that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the submarine 's nuclear reactor , the resulting nuclear explosion would destroy Istanbul , sabotaging the Russians ' oil pipeline in the Bosphorus while dramatically increasing the value of Elektra 's oil . Bond then gets a signal from the hacked locator card in the Maiden 's Tower just before Zukovsky 's underling , Bullion blows up the command centre . Zukovsky is knocked unconscious and Bond and Jones are captured by Elektra 's henchmen . Jones is taken aboard the submarine , which was seized by Renard 's men . Bond is taken to the tower , where Elektra tortures him with a garrote . Zukovsky and his men seize the tower , but Zukovsky is shot by Elektra , freeing Bond with his cane gun with his last act . Bond frees M and kills Elektra . 
 Bond dives after the submarine , boards it , and frees Jones . Following a fight , the submarine hits the bottom of the Bosphorus , causing its hull to rupture . Bond catches up with Renard and kills him after a lengthy fight in the submarine 's reactor . Bond and Jones escape from the submarine , leaving the flooded reactor to detonate safely underwater .

 Joe Dante and then Peter Jackson were offered the opportunity to direct the film . Barbara Broccoli enjoyed Jackson 's Heavenly Creatures , and a screening of The Frighteners was arranged for her . She disliked the latter film , however , and showed no further interest in Jackson . Jackson , a lifelong Bond fan , remarked that as Eon tended to go for less famous directors , he would likely not get another chance to direct a Bond film after The Lord of the Rings . 
 The pre @-@ title sequence lasts for about 14 minutes , the longest pre @-@ title sequence in the Bond series to date . In the " making of " documentaries on the Ultimate Edition DVD release , director Michael Apted said that the scene was originally much longer than that . Originally , the pre @-@ credits sequence was to have ended with Bond 's leap from the window and descent to the ground , finishing as Bond rushes away from the area as police cars approach . Then , after the credits the sequence in MI6 headquarters would have been next , with the boat scenes the next major action sequence . However , the pre @-@ credits scenes were viewed as lacklustre when compared to ones from previous 007 films , so the credits were pushed back to appear after the boat sequence . The Daily Telegraph claimed that the British Government prevented some filming in front of the actual MI6 Headquarters at Vauxhall Cross , citing a security risk . However , a Foreign Office spokesperson rejected the claims and expressed displeasure with the article . 
 Initially the film was to be released in 2000 , rumoured to be titled Bond 2000 . Other rumoured titles included Death Waits for No Man , Fire and Ice , Pressure Point and Dangerously Yours . The title The World Is Not Enough is an English translation of the Latin phrase Orbis non <unk> , which in real life was the motto of Sir Thomas Bond . In the novel On Her Majesty 's Secret Service and its film adaptation , this is revealed to be the Bond family motto . The phrase originates from the epitaph of Alexander the Great . 
 Writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade were hired after their work on Plunkett & Macleane . Dana Stevens did an uncredited rewrite before Bruce Feirstein , who worked in the previous two films , took over the script .

 The pre @-@ title sequence begins in Bilbao , Spain , featuring the Guggenheim Museum . After the opening scene , the film moves to London , showcasing the SIS Building and the Millennium Dome on the Thames . Following the title sequence , Eilean Donan castle in Scotland is used by MI6 as a location headquarters . Other locations include Baku , Azerbaijan , the Azerbaijan Oil Rocks and Istanbul , Turkey , where Maiden 's Tower is shown . 
 The studio work for the film was shot as usual in Pinewood Studios , including Albert R. Broccoli 's 007 Stage . Bilbao , Spain was used briefly for the exterior of the Swiss bank and flyover @-@ bridge adjacent to the Guggenheim Museum . In London outdoor footage was shot of the SIS Building and Vauxhall Cross with several weeks filming the boat chase on the River Thames eastwards towards the Millennium Dome , Greenwich . The canal footage of the chase where Bond soaks the parking wardens was filmed at Wapping and the boat stunts in Millwall Dock and under Glengall Bridge were filmed at the Isle of Dogs . Chatham Dockyard was also used for part of the boat chase . Stowe School , Buckinghamshire , was used as the site of the King family estate on the banks of Loch Lomond . Filming continued in Scotland at Eilean Donan Castle which was used to depict the exterior of MI6 temporary operations centre " Castle Thane " . The skiing chase sequence in the Caucasus was shot on the slopes of Chamonix , France . Filming of the scene was delayed by an avalanche ; the crew helped in the rescue operation . 
 The interior ( and single exterior shot ) of L 'Or Noir casino in Baku , Azerbaijan , was shot at Halton House , the Officers ' Mess of RAF Halton . RAF Northolt was used to depict the airfield runway in Azerbaijan . Zukovsky 's quayside caviar factory was shot entirely at the outdoor water tank at Pinewood . 
 The exterior of Kazakhstan nuclear facility was shot at the Bardenas Reales , in Navarre , Spain , and the exterior of the oil refinery control centre at the Motorola building in <unk> , Swindon . The exterior of the oil pipeline was filmed in Cwm Dyli , Snowdonia , Wales , while the production teams shot the oil pipeline explosion in Hankley Common , <unk> , Surrey . Istanbul , Turkey , was indeed used in the film and Elektra King 's Baku villa was actually in the city , also using the famous Maiden 's Tower which was used as Renard 's hideout in Turkey . The underwater submarine scenes were filmed in The Bahamas . 
 The BMW Z8 driven by Bond in the film was the final part of a three @-@ film product placement deal with BMW ( which began with the Z3 in GoldenEye and continued with the 750iL in Tomorrow Never Dies ) but , due to filming preceding release of the Z8 by a few months , several working mock @-@ ups and models were manufactured for filming purposes .

 The soundtrack to The World Is Not Enough is the second Bond soundtrack to be composed by David Arnold . Arnold broke tradition by not ending the film with a reprise of the opening theme or , as with the previous three films , a new song . Originally , Arnold intended to use the song " Only Myself to Blame " at the end of the film ; however , Apted discarded this and the song was replaced by a remix of the " James Bond Theme " . " Only Myself to Blame " , written by Arnold and Don Black and sung by Scott Walker , is the nineteenth and final track on the album and its melody is Elektra King 's theme . The theme is heard in " Casino " , " Elektra 's Theme " and " I Never Miss " . Arnold added two new themes to the final score , both of which are reused in the following film , Die Another Day . 
 The title song , " The World Is Not Enough " , was written by David Arnold with Don Black and performed by Garbage . It is the fifth Bond theme co @-@ written by Black , preceded by " Thunderball " , " Diamonds Are Forever " , " The Man with the Golden Gun " , and " Tomorrow Never Dies " . Garbage also contributed to the music heard during the chase sequence ( " Ice Bandits " ) , which was released as the B @-@ side to their single release of the theme song . IGN chose " The World Is Not Enough " as the ninth @-@ best James Bond theme of all time . In 2012 Grantland ranked the song as the second @-@ best Bond song of all @-@ time , behind only " Goldfinger . " The song also appeared in two " best of 1999 " polls : # 87 in 89X 's " Top 89 Songs of 1999 " and No. 100 in <unk> 's " Top 101 of 1999 " . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 The World Is Not Enough premiered on 19 November 1999 in the United States and on 26 November 1999 in the United Kingdom . Its World Premiere was November 8 , 1999 at the Bruin & Fox Theatre , Los Angeles , USA . At that time MGM signed a marketing partnership with MTV , primarily for American youths , who were assumed to have considered Bond as " an old @-@ fashioned secret service agent " . As a result , MTV broadcast more than 100 hours of Bond @-@ related programmes immediately after the film was released , most being presented by Denise Richards . 
 The film opened at the top of the North American box office with $ 35 @.@ 5 million . Its final worldwide gross was $ 361 million worldwide , with $ 126 million in the United States alone . It became the highest grossing James Bond film of all time until the release of Die Another Day . The film was also selected for the first round of nominations for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects but failed . The film was nominated for a Best Action / Adventure / Thriller Film Saturn Award , Pierce Brosnan won both the Empire Award and the Blockbuster Entertainment Award as Best Actor , and David Arnold won a BMI Film Music Award for his score . The film became the first in the Bond series to win a Golden Raspberry when Denise Richards was chosen as " Worst Supporting Actress " at the 1999 Razzie Awards . Richards and Brosnan were also nominated for " Worst Screen Couple " . 
 The initial release of the DVD includes the featurette " Secrets of 007 " , which cuts into " making of " material during the film ; the documentary " The Making of The World Is Not Enough " ; two commentary tracks — one by director Michael Apted , and the other by production designer Peter Lamont , second unit director Vic Armstrong , and composer David Arnold ; a trailer for the video game , and the Garbage music video . The Ultimate Edition released in 2006 had as additional extras a 2000 documentary named " Bond Cocktail " , a featurette on shooting the Q Boat scenes , Pierce Brosnan in a press conference in Hong Kong , deleted scenes , and a tribute to Desmond Llewelyn . 
 Reception was mixed . Chicago Sun @-@ Times critic Roger Ebert said the film was a " splendid comic thriller , exciting and graceful , endlessly inventive " , and gave it three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four . On the other hand , Eleanor Ringel Gillespie of The Atlanta Journal @-@ Constitution disliked the film , calling it " dated and confused " . Rotten Tomatoes gave The World Is Not Enough a 51 % rating , the lowest of the Brosnan films , and Metacritic gave the film a score of 59 out of 100 . Negative criticism was focused on the execution of the plot , and the action scenes were considered excessive . Entertainment Weekly picked it as the worst Bond film of all time , saying it had a plot " so convoluted even Pierce Brosnan has admitted to being mystified " . Norman Wilner of MSN chose it as the third worst film , above A View to a Kill and Licence to Kill , while IGN chose it as the fifth worst . 
 Richards was criticised as not being credible in the role of a nuclear scientist . She was ranked as one of the worst Bond girls of all time by Entertainment Weekly in 2008 . 
 = = Adaptations = = 
 The film was adapted into a trading card series which was released by <unk> . Bond novelist Raymond Benson wrote his adaptation of The World Is Not Enough from the film 's screenplay . It was Benson 's fourth Bond novel and followed the story closely , but with some details changed . For instance , Elektra sings quietly before her death and Bond still carries his Walther PPK instead of the newer P99 . The novel also gave the cigar girl / assassin the name Giulietta da Vinci and retained a scene between her and Renard that was cut from the film ( this scene was also retained in the card series ) . 
 In 2000 , the film was adapted by Electronic Arts to create a first @-@ person shooter of the same name for the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation . The Nintendo 64 version was developed by Eurocom and the PlayStation version was developed by Black Ops . Versions of The World Is Not Enough for the PC and the PlayStation 2 were planned for release in 2000 , but both were cancelled . These versions would have used the id Tech 3 game engine . Although this game marks Pierce Brosnan 's fifth appearance in a Bond video game , the game includes only his likeness ; the character is voiced by someone else .

 Kepler @-@ 9 was named for the Kepler Mission , a project headed by NASA that was designed to search for Earth @-@ like planets . Unlike stars such as Aldebaran or Sirius , Kepler @-@ 9 does not have a colloquial name . 
 In June 2010 , some 43 days after Kepler came online , its operating scientists submitted a list of over 700 exoplanet candidates for review . Of those , five were originally suspected to have more than one planet . Kepler @-@ 9 was one of the <unk> systems ; it was identified as such when scientists noticed significant variations in the time intervals at which Kepler @-@ 9 was transited . Kepler @-@ 9 holds the first <unk> system discovered using the transit method . It is also the first planetary system where transiting planets were confirmed through transit timing variations method , allowing to calculate the masses of planets . The discovery of the planets was announced on August 26 , 2010 . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Kepler @-@ 9 is located in the constellation Lyra that lies some 650 parsecs away from Earth . With a mass of 1 @.@ 07 M ☉ and a radius of 1 @.@ 02 R ☉ , Kepler @-@ 9 is almost exactly the same size and width of the Sun , being only 7 % more massive and 2 % wider . Kepler @-@ 9 has an effective temperature of 5777 ( ± 61 ) K , as compared to the Sun 's at 5778 K , and is approximately 32 % more metal @-@ rich ( in terms of iron ) than the Sun . Kepler @-@ 9 is younger than the Sun , and is estimated to be one billion years old . 
 = = Planetary system = = 
 There are three confirmed planets , all in direct orbit . The outer two planets , Kepler @-@ 9b ( the inner one ) and Kepler @-@ 9c ( the outer one ) , are low density gas giants that are respectively 25 % and 17 % the mass of Jupiter and around 80 % the radius of Jupiter . Both planets have a density less than that of water , similar to Saturn . The innermost planet , Kepler @-@ 9d , is a super @-@ Earth with a radius that is 1 @.@ 64 times that of Earth , orbiting the star every 1 @.@ 6 days . It is estimated that there is a 0 @.@ 59 % chance that the discoveries are false . 
 From Kepler @-@ 9d ( closest to star ) to Kepler @-@ 9b ( second from star ) , the ratio of their orbits is 1 : 12 . However , the ratio of the orbits of the two outer planets is 1 : 2 , a relationship known as a mean motion resonance . Kepler @-@ 9b and Kepler @-@ 9c are the first transiting planets detected in such an orbital configuration . The resonance causes the orbital speeds of each planet to change , and thus causes the transit times of the two planets to oscillate . The period of Kepler @-@ 9b is increasing by 4 minutes per orbit , while that of Kepler @-@ 9c is decreasing by 39 minutes per orbit . These orbital changes allowed the masses of the planets ( a parameter not normally obtainable via the transit method ) to be estimated using a dynamical model . The mass estimates were further refined using radial velocity measurements obtained with the HIRES instrument of the Keck 1 telescope . 
 Kepler @-@ 9b and 9c are thought to have formed beyond the " frost line " . They are then thought to have migrated inward due to interactions with the remains of the protoplanetary disk . They would have been captured into orbital resonance during this migration .

 " Born Again " is a song recorded by the Christian rock band Third Day and alternative metal singer Lacey Mosley . Written by Mac Powell and composed by Third Day , " Born Again " was released as the third and final single from Third Day 's 2008 album Revelation . Musically , the song is a ballad featuring influences from the genres of folk music and pop music , while the song is lyrically a " study in self @-@ examination and celebration of a life redeemed " . It was included on the compilation album WOW Hits 2011 . 
 " Born Again " met with positive critical reception , with many critics praising Mosley 's vocals . It was nominated for two Grammy Awards at the 52nd Grammy Awards : the Grammy Award for Best Gospel Song and the Grammy Award for Best Gospel Performance . It was the third No. 1 single from Revelation and twenty @-@ seventh overall for Third Day , peaking atop the Billboard Christian AC Monitored chart ; it also peaked at No. 3 on the Hot Christian Songs chart , No. 4 on the Hot Christian AC chart , No. 10 on the Christian CHR chart , and No. 41 on the Heatseekers Songs chart .

 = 24 : Redemption = 
 24 : Redemption is a television film based on the series 24 . It first aired on November 23 , 2008 , on Fox in the United States , and was released to DVD on November 25 . The film was written by executive producer Howard Gordon and was directed by Jon Cassar . 24 : Redemption takes place almost four years after sixth season and two months before seventh season in real time between 3 : 00 pm and 5 : 00 pm ( Sangala timezone ) on Inauguration Day in the United States . 
 The main setting is Sangala , a fictional African country , where Jack Bauer ( Kiefer Sutherland ) tries to find peace with himself , and works as a missionary with Carl Benton ( Robert Carlyle ) , who built the Okavango school to aid war orphans . Bauer is served a subpoena to appear before the United States Senate regarding human rights violations , but refuses to go , and a shadow organization among the United States government aids General Juma ( Tony Todd ) and his militia in a coup d 'état . 
 The working title was 24 : Exile . The concept of the film started since the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike , which delayed the seventh season for a year thus leaving a gap in the series during 2008 . Redemption was somewhat inspired by the Rwandan Genocide in 1994 . The majority of Redemption was filmed on location outside Cape Town , South Africa since it was difficult to mimic an authentic African scenery in America . 
 Two versions of the film were released to DVD , the original broadcast version and an extended directors cut . The original airing was seen by just over 12 million Americans , and received positive reviews , and was praised for showing a more human side to Bauer . 24 : Redemption was nominated for a Golden Globe as well as five Emmy Awards . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Redemption begins with a brief prologue showing a young boy being kidnapped at night , indoctrinated , and drafted along with other boys into a rebel militia so they could take part in a coup d 'état , which is being funded by a shadow organization led by Jonas Hodges ( Jon Voight ) . 
 While Bauer performs missionary work at the Okavango school in Sangala owned by Carl Benton ( Robert Carlyle ) , U.S. embassy official Frank <unk> ( Gil Bellows ) serves him a subpoena to appear before the Senate regarding torture charges , but Bauer refuses to go . Upon hearing the embassy will cut funding to Benton 's school if it continues to protect him , he decides to leave . Meanwhile , several children playing soccer are ambushed by Juma 's rebel soldiers and kidnapped for conscription . When two boys run away , the soldiers open fire , killing one . Benton learns that the rebels are planning to attack his school . He calls Bauer , who hides the children in an underground shelter , and kills several rebels before getting captured and tortured . Benton is able to ambush the remaining soldiers , and Bauer kills the leader , Youssou Dubaku ( <unk> <unk> ) . His brother , Iké ( Hakeem Kae @-@ Kazim ) hears of his death and plots revenge , while Bauer and Benton leave with the children to get to the American embassy in the capital before the final helicopter evacuates the country . 
 In Washington , D.C. , Chris Whitley ( Kris Lemche ) is ordered by the conspirators who fund Juma 's militia to erase all information that would incriminate them . Instead , he calls his friend Roger Taylor ( Eric Lively ) , the son of President Elect Allison Taylor ( Cherry Jones ) , for help . After Roger hears of the conspiracy , Whitley returns to his home to forward the files , only to be stopped by Hodges 's men , Halcott and John Quinn ( Sebastian Roche ) who take the information , kill Whitley and bury the body in concrete . 
 Benton , Bauer and the boys are spotted by Iké 's helicopter . While they flee into the forest , Benton steps on a land mine . With little time to disarm it , Benton urges Bauer to leave , so he can buy time . When he is surrounded by Iké and his men , Benton takes his foot off the trigger and detonates the mine , killing himself and the rebels , though Iké survives . Bauer and the children continue to the capital , where he defeats another rebel ambush . At the gates of the embassy , <unk> denies the children entry and blackmails Bauer into surrendering for the children 's safety . He reluctantly accepts , thus sacrificing his freedom . While Taylor is inaugurated President , Bauer and the children evacuate , leaving chaotic Sangala behind .

 = = Production = = 
 The film was conceived as a result of the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike , which delayed the seventh season for an entire year ; the producers were exploring ways to get back on the air earlier . Ideas included airing webisodes or mobisodes . According to the President of Entertainment at Fox , " We were going to be off the air for a while and how do you bridge that gap . We thought about doing something online and after talking with [ executive producer ] Howard Gordon we decided to do it on air . " The working title for the film was 24 : Exile , until the change to 24 : Redemption . 
 In an interview , Kiefer Sutherland revealed that Redemption was inspired by the Rwandan Genocide and the U.S. Government 's response to it . " The truth is , one of the things that was said in the prequel , which I think has been a massive problem with how the Western world has dealt with Africa , no one can justify going there , because they have no viable reason – meaning oil or money . Here [ the president 's ] response is a human one . We can stop a genocide . I think that that 's something that Bill Clinton apologized for not doing with Rwanda and we centered a show around that . " 
 On April 30 , producers began scouting locations in Africa in order to film the feature in the upcoming weeks . The original plan was to shoot three days worth of scenes in Africa and then have Simi Valley , California fill in for the location . After realizing it would be difficult to fake , it was decided to shoot the majority of the film on location in Cape Town , South Africa . Filming took place from June 4 to June 20 with the final scenes being shot in Los Angeles , California . By July 13 , principal shooting of the film had been completed and post @-@ production had begun .

Mary McNamara of The Los Angeles Times praised the film , acknowledging the producers taking on board the criticism and moral issues regarding the use of torture , and stated that a group of innocent young children running for their lives " instantly ratchets up a story 's emotional level .

He further praised the action scenes involving Bauer on his own , stating it as a " sort of Die Hard in Africa , " and called the change of setting from Los Angeles a " refreshing change of pace " .

Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe gave the film a negative review , giving it a 2 out of 10 , calling it " un @-@ fun " , and stating that Bauer 's character has not changed at all from past seasons , and asking , " When does a rogue hero [ Bauer ] become a tired joke ? Based on this un @-@ fun movie , I would say yesterday . "

 = I Don 't Give A = 
 " I Don 't Give A " is a song recorded by American singer @-@ songwriter Madonna for her twelfth studio album MDNA ( 2012 ) . The song features rap vocals by Trinidadian recording artist Nicki Minaj . It was written and produced by Madonna and Martin Solveig , with additional songwriting by Minaj and Julien Jabre . " I Don 't Give A " is a pop song , with electronic and hip hop syncopated beats . 
 Lyrically , the song is about a day in Madonna 's life with some portions of it directed at her ex @-@ husband , film director Guy Ritchie , when she sings about a failed marriage . The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics who praised Minaj 's appearance and its personal lyrics . Following the release of MDNA , the song peaked at number 117 in the Gaon Chart of South Korea . Madonna performed the song on The MDNA Tour as the closing track of the show 's first segment .

 Madonna 's manager Guy Oseary had contacted Martin Solveig wanting to know if he would be available to work with the singer , to which he responded affirmative . In July 2011 , the singer invited Solveig for a writing session in London for her twelfth studio album , MDNA . This session produced three songs , including " I Don 't Give A " , " Give Me All Your Luvin ' " and " Turn Up the Radio " , the last two later becoming official singles off the album . According to the producer , few days after he had finished the composition , Madonna completed writing the lyrics of " I Don 't Give A " . Solveig understood that the lyrics were probable references towards Madonna 's life and thus received coverage in the press . However , he was not aware of the inner meaning behind the lyrics . With Billboard magazine , the producer further explained : 
 At first I thought we were going to work on one song ; that was the original plan . Let 's try to work on one song and take it from there -- not spend too much time thinking about the legend , and do something that just makes sense . [ ... ] We did one song and another song , and we were having fun making music . And actually it was a very privileged time . She wasn 't under any kind of pressure , she had time to spend on it ; it was the only thing she had to work on . 
 In an interview with Channel V Australia , he recalled that the two of them were able to communicate their thoughts about the tracks they developed , " on an organisational level " , thus accelerating the process . Madonna was completely involved in the recording which was a surprise for Solveig , since he had expected the singer not to stay more than an hour or two in the recording studio and then leave . Madonna expressed her thoughts about the composition , including the instrumentation to be used as Solveig added , " at some point she wanted to choose the sound of a snare drum or a synth and that kind of stuff . She was really in the session ! " Madonna reciprocated the feelings saying that she liked Solveig 's way of working : " He 's very organised and methodical in his thinking so I like his work process " . The singer also stated that she was able to disapprove something which she did not like without hurting his feelings . 
 Regarding having Minaj feature as a guest vocalist , Madonna explained that she wanted to collaborate with female singers she believed had a " strong sense of themselves " . They were shy of each other in the beginning but were able to pass that and dedicate to the tracks . Solveig described Minaj as a " pro " and recalled that she spent some time with the songs and wrote her rapping verse and recorded it within a short span of time . 
 = = Recording and composition = = 
 " I Don 't Give A " was written by Madonna , Solveig , Minaj and Julien Jabre . Production was handled by Madonna and Solveig , while Minaj provided rap vocals for the track . It was mixed by Demacio " Demo " Castellon for The Demolition Crew , while it was recorded by Castellon , Philippe Weiss and Graham Archer , with additional recording by Jason " Metal " Donkersgoed , also for The Demolition Crew . The recording took place at Sarm West Studios , London , England and MSR Studios , New York , New York . Minaj appeared for one day during the recording , finishing off her work in " I Don 't Give A " as well as " Give Me All Your Luvin ' " . Jabre also provided electric guitars , drums and synths , while Solveig provided additional instrumentation . Ron Taylor did the vocal editing for the track while Michael Turco added the outro music for The Demolition Crew . Other personnel working on the song included Romain Faure and Angie Teo , the latter of whom worked as mixing assistant . 
 " I Don 't Give A " is a midtempo pop song with a " ballsy " electronic hip hop and industrial beats . <unk> after the initial dance tunes in MDNA , the mood for the song is dark and somber , with a Sturm und Drang chorus and backed by an orchestra that The New York Times reviewer Jon Pareles compared to composer Carl Orff 's cantata , Carmina Burana . The ending of the song consists of a big outro , with " grandiose " choirs , " crashing " cymbals and " escalating " strings . Critics noted that Madonna 's rap in the song is similar to that on her 2003 single " American Life " . 
 Lyrically " I Don 't Give A " describes a day in the life of Madonna , with the singer working through her schedule . The verses during the chorus are representative of how Madonna had previously ignored her detractors , instead choosing to express it with her music with the lines , " I 'm moving fast , Can you follow my track , I 'm <unk> ' fast , And I like it like that , I do ten things all at once , And if you have a problem , I don 't give a . " During the bridge , the lyrics presumably talks about a marriage which did not work out for unknown reasons , " I tried to be a good girl / I tried to be your wife / I diminished myself / And I swallowed my light . " Many critics agreed that the song has pretty direct lyrics that seem to take aim at her ex @-@ husband , film director Guy Ritchie . However , when asked if Ritchie was indeed the subject of the song , Madonna 's representative Liz Rosenberg added that " [ Madonna ] has not explained the lyrics and if they are about someone specifically ... [ but ] I appreciate that people will speculate . " The song ends with Minaj uttering the final line , " There 's only one queen and that 's Madonna . Bitch ! . " 
 Brandon Soderberg from Spin observed how the song was a narrative against her " haters " , a theme predominant in rap music . This is enunciated with the lyrics addressing Ritchie and tabloids , along with some of Minaj 's verses being directed against pop singer Lady Gaga , with whom Madonna had been compared to previously . Soderberg deduced that Madonna might have noticed the shifting themes in rap music , where it had become acceptable to boast about one 's wealth , hence the lyrics had more of a Sex and the City vibe with its depiction of Madonna 's " fairly awesome life " . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 " I Don 't Give A " received generally favorable reviews from music critics . Neal McCormick of The Daily Telegraph called it " an album highlight " , writing that " there is real energy to this Martin Solveig production , though Nicki Minaj 's explosive rap rather shows up Madonna 's more static delivery " . A writer from Virgin Media gave the song a rating of 4 out of 5 stars while complimenting the chorus . Michael Cragg of The Guardian labeled " I Don 't Give A " as " brilliantly odd " . He praised " the industrial beats " as well as " the spooky chants and out of nowhere [ appearance of ] Minaj " . 
 Jeremy Thomas of music website 411 Mania called the track as " incredibly in @-@ your @-@ face " , commending Minaj for delivering " one of the best flows we 've seen from her since she showed up on Kanye West 's ' Monster ' . " Joel Meares of Time Out shared this view , adding that Minaj 's rap verse was reminiscent of the times when Madonna 's own songs were as good as the former 's single " Starships " . The Village Voice 's Maura Johnston was also complimentary about Minaj , writing that , " [ She ] lays down a couple of rhymes that are by no means the best in her vast catalog , but her sudden presence shows that the music isn 't the song 's biggest weakness . " Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club also considered the rapper 's performance as " one of her better features in a while " , and better than her inclusion in the lead single " Give Me All Your Luvin ' " . Soderberg from Spin described the song as a " rap track that positions Nicki Minaj , as the brash , pop subversive in the tradition of Madonna " and criticized the latter 's rapping , finding the vocals to be weak . Conversely , he appreciated Minaj 's verses and vocal delivery , calling them " witty " and " confident " . He further wrote about Madonna 's vocals in detail : 
 [ Although Madonna 's ] MC voice is weak and silly , it 's admirably her , which is impressive now that the feigned " hood " accents of Iggy Azalea and Kreayshawn are in vogue . I would favorably compare Madonna 's verses to the much @-@ maligned Uffie , who was also brave / stupid / smart enough to just rap about her annoying , first world problems with no pretense to being down . 
 Keith Caulfield of Billboard called it " a very rat @-@ a @-@ tat @-@ tat song " ; He complimented the lengthy orchestral portion of the track and called it " epic and sweeping , but comes out of nowhere " . For Matthew Perpetua of Pitchfork Media the song showed how Madonna 's strong rapping was upstaged by Minaj , " who turns in an entertaining performance that is nevertheless below the standards of her usual features " . Nick Bond of Sydney Star Observer wrote that the song is " not her most GFC @-@ friendly track " , but explained that " Musically , it 's the damp squib that was Hard Candy done right . "

 Madonna performed " I Don 't Give A " on The MDNA Tour in 2012 .

Saeed Saeed of The National praised Madonna for " re @-@ emerging once again triumphant in rock star mode , " during the performance Kat Keogh of Birmingham Mail described that " The crowd was awash with a sea of camera phones as Madge grabbed a guitar for Nicki Minaj duet ' I Don ’ t Give A ' . " Jon Pareles of The New York Times was mixed in his review , writing that Madonna " still looks silly when , as she did in ' I Don ’ t Give A ' , she slings an electric guitar and makes rocker @-@ chick faces " and found it odd that " someone so physically disciplined can ’ t fake better guitar moves . " The performance was included on Madonna 's fourth live album , MDNA World Tour .

 = = Character creation and casting = = 
 The character of Loretta was created as a temporary love interest for Dominic Reilly ( John Pickard ) and was intended to feature only in Hollyoaks Later , the spin @-@ off from the Hollyoaks series . In 2009 it was announced that the Hollyoaks ' producer Lucy Allan had decided to introduce both Loretta and Cheryl Brady ( Bronagh Waugh ) into the main show . Allan said , " Cheryl and Loretta will bring an energy and a sense of fun to the show . Both Melissa and Bronagh impressed me with their performances in Hollyoaks Later and I 'm sure viewers will warm to them quickly . " Loretta was initially paired with Dom and , after ending their relationship , was given links to other characters in the series . To prepare for the role Walton took pole @-@ dancing classes and visited a lap dancing club . After watching girls perform at the club she carried out routines in her underwear . She also had a pole set up in her living room to carry on practicing . Speaking of her research Walton stated : " I loved it . It 's really good exercise . It 's really good for toning . They didn 't ask me to , but I did ... I went and I had pole dancing classes . I had a pole put up in my living room . " 
 Though Walton had initially signed on for a three @-@ month stint Allan decided to renew her contract in 2009 and keep Loretta in the series until 2010 . In early 2010 it was announced that Allan had stepped down from the position of executive producer and that Paul Marquess had taken over the role . It was soon revealed that Marquess planned to give Hollyoaks a " shake up " , changing the productions team and beginning a cast cull by axing three established characters . Stephanie Waring ( who plays Cindy Hutchinson ) then revealed that all remaining cast members feared their own character would be axed . One month later Marquess announced his plans to axe a further 11 characters , including Loretta at the end of Walton 's contract . It was also revealed that Loretta would depart at the same time as her current love interest Jake Dean ( Kevin Sacre ) . 
 On 8 June 2010 Walton filmed her final scenes for the series , along with two fellow cast members Scare and Gerard McCarthy ( who plays Kris Fisher ) . She spoke of her upset over leaving her fellow cast members , but later said she was looking forward to pursuing other projects . Walton also confirmed that she was happy the door was left open for a potential return , stating that she would consider reprising her role as Loretta in the future . Walton also said she understood why Marquess axed her character , he did not feel Loretta had anywhere left to go after the cancellation of her main storyline . However , she also felt like she deserved another chance to prove herself .

 Loretta has stated on @-@ screen that she does not want to conform with the stereotype of a blond pole dancer , and makes it clear that she is a keen bird watcher and enjoys documentaries . Speaking of the character Walton stated , " I love that Loretta 's not a stereotypical stripper sort of girl — there ’ s a lot more depth to her . She ’ s actually quite shy and reserved . She ’ s got lots of interesting little hobbies , like bird @-@ watching and Roman history ! Then at night she skips off and turns into a stripper . It ’ s like two different lives , and I think many real @-@ life pole @-@ dancers are like that . They ’ re really nice , normal girls by day , and by night they turn into these temptresses . " Walton also praised the soap 's realistic portrayal of the occupation , saying that many pole dancers attend university or have good professions but rely on stripping for extra money , and that she has met people like her character in the strip club where Hollyoaks films scenes . 
 Walton hopes viewers will find Loretta 's alter ego as a stripper tasteful commenting , " As tasteful as you can be in a pink frilly bra and knicker set , with a little skirt that ’ s more like a belt , and back @-@ combed hair and fake eyelashes ! " Loretta 's stripper clothing is in stark contrast to her every day look of non @-@ revealing clothing . 
 Loretta 's relationships helped develop the character . Her first relationship is with Dom Reilly who shares her interests in bird watching , documentaries on ancient Rome and literature . The relationship immediately gave viewers an insight into the character . However , as their relationship progressed , it became apparent that Dom could not handle Loretta 's profession as he feared for her safety , which ultimately lead to their break up . Loretta 's second relationship is a short @-@ lived fling with Ravi Roy ( Stephen <unk> ) where she is determined to see the good in him , and help him while he suffers from a brain aneurysm , but ends the relationship when he attempts to assault her . Loretta then begins a secret romance with Jake , who had tried to murder his child and rape his wife . Loretta believes he had been misled and is still a good person , demonstrating Loretta 's willingness to give people second chances . Walton comments , " [ Loretta ] is just lovely – she sees the good in everyone . " When television listings magazine What 's on TV challenged Walton to explain why Loretta would be interested in Jake after his crimes Walton said , " Loretta 's big on forgiveness . She believes Jake ’ s changed , that he 's learnt from his time inside and he 's paid his debt to society . " 
 After Marquess decided to axe Loretta he changed the character 's direction and her persona . She became obsessive over men , controlling towards Jake , manipulative and began lying to get what she wanted . Jake later decides he does not want her , of this Walton states that : " She 's not going anywhere . She 's deluded and manipulative and he hasn 't seen anything yet ! " She also is shown have " bunny boiler " tendencies , with Walton agreeing to the label . Walton later revealed that Loretta began pole dancing to have power over men because of the abuse she suffered as a child although , as Loretta 's exit approached , she was now a dangerous and deluded woman . 
 = = = Child murderer controversy = = = 
 In November 2009 Loretta became the centre of media controversy when various media outlets announced that Loretta would be part of a storyline which revealed that she had murdered a child in her past . The controversy began when tabloid newspaper The Sun compared the storyline to the real life murder of James Bulger . Bulger had been murdered when he was two years old by two young children . Being just 10 years of age they were handed small sentences to serve and were later released with new identities . Soon afterwards various other news sources and lifestyle magazines picked up the story and mimicked The Sun and its claims . Bulger 's mother , Denise Fergus , condemned the storyline . While speaking to the news website Click Liverpool she criticised the decision to air a plot that allegedly mirrored her son 's death , stating they should have consulted her first . She said , " I 'm shocked and disgusted at what Hollyoaks is doing . They have clearly based this story on what happened to James and it 's outrageous that they should do this without consulting with me in any way . " She threatened to encourage a boycott of the show . Channel 4 released a statement defending the plot , explaining it had nothing to do with any real life case : " The forthcoming storyline is not based on any real @-@ life case and it will in no way seek to recreate real events . The storyline focuses on the psychological repercussions for two characters in the show who were responsible for the death of a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl in the past . " The storyline would answer questions for viewers who had been speculating on Loretta 's secret past . It would reveal that Loretta had spent time in prison for her crime , was born with the name Joanna Norman , and is living under a false identity . 
 Speaking about delving into her character 's history Walton commented to entertainment website Digital Spy , " It took a little while and until now , we 've known little about her . Nobody in the village knows who she is or where she 's come from . She 's just planted herself in the village knowing hardly anybody . She 's quite a mysterious character . I 'm absolutely loving the opportunity to explore her backstory . " Speaking about her reaction to the plot she continued , " I was like , ' Oh my gosh ! ' I was so shocked but absolutely chuffed to bits because this is what all actors want – something massive like this to sink my teeth into . I feel so privileged that they 've trusted me with this story . I know they 've wanted to do it for a while and they 've finally chosen me ! " 
 In the same interview Walton described the storyline , " Loretta and Chrissy were best , best friends through childhood . They were closer than sisters . She somehow tracks Loretta down and turns up out of the blue after Loretta 's finished a dance class . What we learn is that when they were 12 , they bullied a young girl and didn 't stop until they killed her . They kept pushing and pushing and eventually killed her . Since then , Loretta and Chrissy have been completely separated from each other , their families and friends . They 've spent years in institutions having psychiatric and behavioural treatment . " 
 Kevin Sacre , whose character was directly involved in the storyline , voiced his support for the plot stating : " I think the fact that it 's the sort of thing that happens in real life means it 's something that should be addressed . Anyone who buries their head in the sand is a bit naïve . And I think soap is a medium where you can explore issues of real life . " 
 Just days before the episodes were set to transmit Channel 4 announced that it was axing the storyline , due in part to Fergus 's reaction to the storyline . Whilst Walton had previously claimed the storyline was about three twelve @-@ year @-@ old girls , Channel 4 admitted the similarities between the story and the Bulger case . " This particular storyline was not based on any real life case and was not intended to recreate actual events . However , after conversations with Denise Fergus we have agreed to amend certain aspects of the storyline . " Amber Hodgkiss , who was cast to play Chrissy , expressed her disappointment over the decision to axe the plot all together saying , " The storyline has been completely cut . I am not so happy about it . I would like it to go ahead , but I don 't have that decision . It wasn 't based on Jamie Bulger , but people portrayed it that way . It was quite a big storyline that could affect people , but it happens . " Fergus said she was grateful that the plot was axed saying , " I 'm grateful that they are respecting my wishes . I made it clear that I did not want those scenes broadcast and I 'm pleased to say they clearly understood my feelings . " 
 When episodes that were intended to feature the storyline transmitted , they instead featured a selection of then " last minute " scenes . In these scenes Hodgkiss portrays a new character , Caroline , who holds Loretta and Jake hostage . 
 = = = Stalker and exit storyline = = = 
 Marquess began writing scripts to facilitate Loretta 's departure as Walton 's filming was to finish in June 2010 , with a departure date of August that same year . Her exit from the series was described as dramatic , with Walton commenting on this during an interview with magazine programme Live from Studio Five stating , " I 'm very pleased with my exit , you know . I 'm very , very pleased with what I 've been given and I 've really enjoyed doing it . I 've probably enjoyed the last few months of filming more than I 've enjoyed anything else that I 've done , to be honest . " 
 Loretta 's backstory gradually began to unfold on @-@ screen . Loretta decided she needed to win Jake back . Her ex @-@ boyfriend Adam ( Vlach Ashton ) warned Jake that Loretta had previously stalked him . This starts to damage their relationship and during an interview with What 's on TV Walton commented on it saying that Jake was suspicious of Loretta 's motives . Loretta love for Jake turned into an obsession with Walton saying , " She 's definitely not giving up on him . What he thought was love is already actually an obsession . She wants to totally control him " . The story line reveals her past of obsessions with men and Walton stated , " You sense Adam wasn 't the only ex @-@ partner she stalked . She has a mobile full of men 's numbers . " Walton explains the cause of her behaviour , " You find out much later on that it 's because of something that happened in her past . Her obsession really is getting full @-@ on [ ... ] She 's jealous of anybody who gets Jake 's attention . " After Jake 's sister Steph Cunningham ( Carley Stenson ) is diagnosed with cervical cancer Loretta pretends she once had leukaemia in order to trap Jake . He throws her out though because his son had previously suffered from the illness . Loretta refuses to give up and her behaviour becomes more erratic . 
 In the final episodes of her departure Loretta manages to convince everyone that Jake was mentally ill once more . She takes Nancy Hayton ( Jessica Fox ) hostage for snooping into her life with Adam and Walton states , " Loretta is dangerous and deluded , Nancy 's terrified of her – she tries to escape but Loretta won 't let her She accidentally pushes Nancy , who crashes into a table and bangs her head badly " . Walton also revealed more of Loretta 's past saying , " Adam confesses that Loretta was violent towards him , basically she did some awful things to him that she 's doing to Jake now . " The storyline sought to explain all the unanswered questions left in her backstory with Walton saying , " He [ Jake ] tries to talk her round , and at that point she reveals she was sexually abused when she was very young . It 's supposedly the reason she went into stripping to have power over men . " Walton also defended Loretta 's final actions , saying the character was confused and did not mean to hurt anyone . In Loretta 's final scene she voluntarily admits herself into a psychiatric hospital after being convinced to by Jake .

 = 1966 NASA T @-@ 38 crash = 
 The 1966 NASA T @-@ 38 crash occurred when a NASA Northrop T @-@ 38 Talon crashed at Lambert Field in St. Louis , Missouri , on February 28 , 1966 , killing two Project Gemini astronauts , Elliot See and Charles Bassett . The aircraft , piloted by See , crashed into the McDonnell Aircraft building where their Gemini 9 spacecraft was being assembled . The weather was poor with rain , snow , fog , and low clouds . A NASA panel , headed by the Chief of the Astronaut Office , Alan Shepard , investigated the crash . While the panel considered possible medical issues or aircraft maintenance problems , in addition to the weather and air traffic control factors , the end verdict was that the crash was caused by pilot error . 
 In the aftermath of the crash , the backup crew of Thomas Stafford and Eugene Cernan were moved up to the primary position for the Gemini 9 mission , scheduled for early June . Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin , who had formerly been the backup for Gemini 10 , became the mission 's backup crew , and through the normal rotation were assigned as prime crew for Gemini 12 . Without the Gemini experience , it is unlikely that Aldrin would have been assigned to the Apollo 11 mission , during which he became the second man to walk on the moon . 
 = = The accident = = 
 See and Bassett were the prime crew assigned to the Gemini 9 mission . They and the backup crew for the mission , Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan , were flying to St. Louis from their normal training base in Houston , Texas , for two weeks of simulator training for rendezvous and docking procedures at McDonnell Aircraft , the prime contractor for the Gemini spacecraft . It was a routine flight they had made many times previously . 
 See and Bassett flew in one Northrop T @-@ 38A Talon jet trainer , tail number NASA 901 ( Air Force serial number 63 @-@ 8181 ) , with See at the controls and Bassett in the rear seat . A second T @-@ 38 , NASA 907 , carried Stafford and Cernan in the same configuration . The two aircraft took off from Ellington Air Force Base in Texas at 7 : 35 a.m. CST , with See in the lead and Stafford in wing position . Weather at Lambert Field in St. Louis was poor , with rain , snow , and fog , broken clouds at 800 feet ( 240 m ) and a flight ceiling of 1 @,@ 500 feet ( 460 m ) , requiring an instrument approach . When the two aircraft emerged below the clouds shortly before 9 am , both pilots realized they had missed the outer marker and overshot the runway . 
 See then elected to perform a visual circling approach , a simplified landing procedure allowing flight under instrument rules , as long as the pilot can keep the airfield and any preceding aircraft in sight . The reported weather conditions at the airport were adequate for this type of approach , but visibility was irregular and deteriorating rapidly . Stafford began to follow See 's plane , but when he lost sight of it in the clouds he instead followed the standard procedure for a missed approach and pulled his aircraft up , back into the clouds for another attempt at an instrument landing . 
 See completed a full circle to the left at an altitude of 500 to 600 feet ( 150 to 180 m ) , and announced his intention to land on the southwest runway ( 24 ) . With landing gear down and full flaps , the plane dropped quickly but too far left of the runway . See turned on his afterburner to increase power while pulling up and turning hard right . Seconds later , at 8 : 58 a.m. CST , the plane struck the roof of McDonnell Building 101 on the northeast side of the airport . It lost its right wing and landing gear on impact , then cartwheeled and crashed in a parking lot beyond the building which was in use as a construction staging area . 
 Both astronauts instantly succumbed to trauma sustained in the crash . Inside Building 101 , 17 McDonnell employees and contractors received mostly minor injuries from falling debris . The crash set off several small fires inside the building , and caused minor flooding from a number of broken pipes and sprinklers . By coincidence , See and Bassett died within 500 feet ( 150 m ) of the very spacecraft that they were to have flown in orbit , which was in the final stages of assembly in another part of Building 101 . Spacecraft S / C9 was undamaged , but a piece of debris from the T @-@ 38 's wing struck the unfinished S / C10 spacecraft . 
 Meanwhile , Stafford and Cernan , still circling in the clouds in the second T @-@ 38 , had no idea what had happened to their flight partners . Air traffic controllers were confused by the two planes in flight attempting different abort actions after the initial missed approach , and moreover no one on the ground knew who was in the crashed plane . After some delay , Stafford and Cernan were asked to identify themselves and given permission to land , but they were not informed of the crash until on the ground . Although personally distraught over the loss of his close colleagues and friends , Stafford acted as NASA 's chief contact on the scene until other personnel arrived to relieve him later in the day . 
 = = Investigation and aftermath = = 
 NASA immediately appointed a 7 @-@ member panel to investigate the crash , headed by their Chief of the Astronaut Office , Alan Shepard . While the panel weighed possible medical issues , aircraft maintenance problems , weather conditions , and air traffic control factors , their end verdict was pilot error , citing See 's inability " to maintain visual reference for a landing " as the primary cause of the crash . See was described as a " cautious and conservative " pilot in the accident report . In his memoir , chief astronaut Deke Slayton was less diplomatic , calling See 's piloting skills " old @-@ <unk> . " Others , including Neil Armstrong , who had worked with See on the backup crew for Gemini 5 , have since defended See 's piloting ability . 
 Since the crash did not affect space flight operations and the spacecraft itself was undamaged — it was shipped to NASA two days after the crash — the accident caused neither delays nor engineering changes in the U.S. space program . However , the loss of the Gemini 9 crew did cause NASA to reshuffle the crew assignments for subsequent Gemini and Apollo missions ; Stafford and Cernan were moved up to the primary position for Gemini 9 , re @-@ designated Gemini 9A . Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin , who had formerly been the backup for Gemini 10 , became the back @-@ up crew for Gemini 9A , and through the normal rotation were then assigned as prime crew for Gemini 12 . Without experience during the Gemini mission , Buzz Aldrin would have been an unlikely choice for the Apollo 11 mission , during which he became the second man to walk on the moon .

 " Elogium " is the fourth episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : Voyager , the 20th episode overall . The episode first aired on the UPN network on February 18 , 1995 . The story was written by freelancers Jimmy Diggs and Steve J. Kay , based on Diggs ' experience while serving in the United States Navy . It was rewritten by executive producer Jeri Taylor and guest writer Kenneth Biller . 
 Set in the 24th century , the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet and Maquis crew of the starship USS Voyager after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant far from the rest of the Federation . In this episode , Voyager encounters a swarm of space @-@ borne lifeforms , which mistake the vessel for a member of their species . The presence of the aliens induce a premature mating cycle in Kes ( Jennifer Lien ) , causing her and Neelix ( Ethan Phillips ) to question whether or not they are ready to have children . 
 Taylor incorporated Diggs ’ suggestion to name a character " Samantha Wildman " after an organ donor who saved his wife ’ s life . The script was Biller 's first work for the series and earned him a permanent spot on the Voyager writing staff after impressing the producers . The episode received Nielsen ratings of 5 @.@ 7 / 9 percent , placing it in 87th position for the week overall . The episode was praised by the cast , although director Winrich Kolbe was satisfied but felt that Kes could have been taken further in the episode . Critics gave the episode a mixed response , lauding Lien 's performance while criticizing the character dynamics and the message about women wanting to become a mother . 
 = = Plot = = 
 On stardate <unk> @.@ 3 , when the USS Voyager encounters a cloud of space @-@ dwelling lifeforms , Captain Janeway ( Kate Mulgrew ) takes the ship in for a closer look . The ship is soon drawn in and engulfed by the swarm of creatures , whose proximity disables the helm controls and shields . The crew endeavor to escape without harming the creatures , but when they begin attaching themselves to the Voyager 's hull , they wreak even more havoc on the ship ’ s systems . A version of the creatures as large as the Voyager arrives , and the crew realize that they have been mistaken for a male of the species ; the smaller creatures are attempting to mate with the ship . When the male attacks , the Voyager adopts a position of submission , based on behavior the crew observed in the smaller members of the species . Losing interest , the smaller creatures detach from the Voyager and allow it to leave . 
 In response to Voyager 's exposure to the swarm of aliens , Kes ( Jennifer Lien ) begins eating abnormally , including insects and soil . In sickbay , she has a fever , a dangerously elevated pulse and blood pressure , and a tumorous growth on her back . She resists the Doctor ’ s ( Robert Picardo ) treatment and locks herself in his office , finally relenting only to explain to Captain Janeway that she ’ s undergoing the elogium : the Ocampa mating cycle . This process only happens once and usually affects Ocampa between four and five years old — but Kes is not even two years old yet . Neelix ( Ethan Phillips ) and Kes agonize over whether to have children and the ramifications of becoming parents . After discussing children and family with Lieutenant Tuvok ( Tim Russ ) , Neelix decides he ’ s ready to be a father , while Kes has instead decided against it . Ultimately , because The Doctor believes the elogium was artificially induced by the creatures ’ proximity to the ship , it may come upon her again later in her life when she is ready . 
 Throughout the episode , a concern over shipboard fraternization arises . After Captain Janeway and Chakotay ( Robert Beltran ) discuss whether the ship is an appropriate place to raise children , Ensign Samantha Wildman ( Nancy <unk> ) announces that she is pregnant by her husband , who is still in the Alpha Quadrant . 
 = = Production = = 
 " The <unk> " and " The Running " were temporary titles during the development of the episode , before settling on the final title : " Elogium " . The episode was originally written for the show 's first season , but was held over by UPN to give the second season a jump @-@ start on other networks ' programming . In other countries , including the United Kingdom , the episode was included in the first season . Executive producer and co @-@ creator Jeri Taylor described " Elogium " as a fitting end to that season " because it leaves us with the revelation that someone aboard the U.S.S. Voyager is pregnant ! " Though the production of the episode required extensive computer graphics , " Elogium " ' s production required little other extra production features like extra cast or sets , making it a bottle episode . 
 Jimmy Diggs wrote the A @-@ story of " Elogium " based on an experience he had while serving in the United States Navy . One <unk> night when he was tasked with cleaning the ship as it came into port , giant spotlights were employed to assist the sailors . As the ship traveled , Diggs witnessed the gradual accumulation of thousands of sea creatures following the ship . That " special , unique memory " was the basis for his first script sold to Star Trek . He was already working as an intern on the staff on the basis of a previous script when he met with Taylor and Brannon Braga to pitch further stories , including " Elogium " . He later said that the story was sold on the strength of a single line of dialogue : when the crew finally figures out how to shed the alien creatures , Tuvok 's line of " Captain , I believe that we 've lost our sex appeal . " made Braga laugh and caused him to " say the magic word , ' Sold . ' " With this , Diggs became the third African American to write for Star Trek . The composition of shots including the Voyager and the alien creatures were accomplished with heavy use of computer @-@ generated imagery ( CGI ) produced by Amblin Imaging and Santa Barbara Studios . When viewing the alien swarm at a distance , the special effect was a composition from magnified footage of sperm . When viewed close @-@ up however , the alien swarm was computer @-@ generated . Jeri Taylor rewrote the script to weave in Kes ' need to mate as the B @-@ story . 
 Diggs later wrote to Jeri Taylor , requesting a character be named after Samantha Wildman , a young girl whose kidney donation saved his wife 's life . Taylor wrote in the character of Samantha Wildman , who recurred as the department head of <unk> because her namesake had been a fervent animal lover . Diggs described his motivation for lobbying for the name : " ' I couldn 't imagine the selflessness of people who , in the middle of their grief over the loss of their child , could think about someone else , could save someone else 's life . ' Jimmy says that in ancient times , the gods would immortalize heroes by placing them in the stars . ' Samantha Wildman will live on , ' he says . ' She 's taken her [ place ] in the stars . ' " 
 The teleplay was written by Kenneth Biller and Taylor ; Biller wrote the A @-@ story that focused on the swarm of alien creatures while Taylor focused on the B @-@ story of Kes ' elogium . Instead of writing from Digg 's full prose story , Biller worked from a seven @-@ page treatment . Biller reacted to the plot with the thought : " a show about eating and sex — these are things I know a lot about … " Biller explained in a later interview that he fought for Neelix and Kes to already be living together and having sex when drafting the teleplay , but he was shot down by Taylor and Rick Berman out of concern for Kes ' young age and that it would be more interesting to show the couple grappling with this for the first time . 
 " Elogium " inaugurated Biller 's term as a writer for Star Trek : Voyager . When he brought in the script for series co @-@ creators Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor to review , he was told that it was a very good script . However , Piller said that " I don 't think the teaser works at all . " Biller received so many notes on the script that he began to feel as though the experience were an audition . After rewriting the script , Taylor expressed his pleasure with Biller 's technical descriptions within the script and asked if Biller had a science background ; ironically , Biller had instead attended Brown University specifically to avoid taking science courses — the technical details were all made up . The day after presenting the rewrite , Taylor asked Biller to join the Voyager writing staff . Biller had been unaware of the vacancy , having come on board for the $ 15 @,@ 000 fee and expecting nothing more . Though initially reluctant , Biller took Taylor 's offer for the " opportunity to write television that was about something . " Taylor and Biller conceded that it was UPN 's holding back of the episode until the second season that resulted in Ensign Wildman 's strange gestation period of seven or eight months .

 Several members of the cast of Voyager found the episode enjoyable . Mulgrew praised " Elogium " for her opportunity to interact with the Kes character on a maternal level . Mulgrew thought the episode was a great vessel for Lien to stretch her acting chops , calling her " a constant and wonderful surprise . " Lien herself thought that the episode was a great vehicle to learn more about her character and the Ocampa species ; she said " [ i ] t really took my character to a different level . " Russ thought that " Elogium " ( along with " <unk> " ) were stories that challenged concepts , ideas , attitudes , and traditions — all things that Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry originally wrote science fiction about : " That , I think , is the most important part of Star Trek . " Director Winrich Kolbe praised Lien 's performance in " Elogium " , but was disappointed that he could not take the character even further , saying that " [ t ] he show went soft at the end . " Kolbe complained that it wasn 't uncommon for a wonderful concept to fall victim to a failing of courage and determination .

 However , critics had a more mixed response . In his book Delta Quadrant : The unofficial guide to Voyager , David McIntee found Chakotay 's revelation and Lien 's acting the only high points of the episode . Otherwise , he felt the " sexual @-@ politics statements " were cheesy and overdone , and that all of the possible clichés of Kes ' elogium ( puberty , PMS , pregnancy , abortion , and menopause ) were trodden upon and ill @-@ used . McIntee accused the plot of being dull and the acting as subpar ; although he thought the plot was supposed to touch on teenage pregnancy , it instead emphasized that all women wish to be mothers , and all men are " immature bastards . " He rated the episode 1 out of 10 . 
 Cinefantastique 's Dale Kutzera thought the episode flowed well , and that the <unk> was reasonable and logical , but that the episode didn 't make good use of the characters . He said that each character fitted a certain role : Neelix was the jealous boyfriend , B 'Elanna Torres ( Roxann Dawson ) was the shoot @-@ first Klingon , and Kes was the perky @-@ looking alien sounding board for other characters . Furthermore , Kutzera felt that the themes of the episode were more appropriate for an early first @-@ season episode , not being as pertinent or believable a year later . He gave the episode 2 @.@ 5 out of 4 stars .

 " Vow " is a song by alternative rock band Garbage . It was released as their debut single in early 1995 by Discordant , a label set up by Mushroom Records to launch the group , and Almo Sounds in North America . 
 " Vow " was quietly licensed to a Volume magazine / CD sampler publication at the end of 1994 ; it was subsequently picked up and broadcast by BBC Radio 1 DJs Steve Lamacq and John Peel , and then playlisted by modern rock radio stations in Los Angeles and Seattle . " Vow " generated such significant buzz through positive reviews and word @-@ of @-@ mouth that it was eventually chosen as Garbage 's first single release . After a low @-@ key independent record label pressing in the United Kingdom , where it was packaged in a very limited edition logo embossed aluminium case , " Vow " went on to top the alternative charts in Australia and register on the Hot 100 singles chart in the United States . 
 The song began as a demo during sessions between band members Butch Vig , Duke Erikson and Steve Marker , and the composition finished after singer Shirley Manson joined the band . The lyrics for " Vow " deal with themes of revenge and retaliation , and were inspired by a newspaper article on domestic abuse . In 2007 , " Vow " was remastered and included as the opening track on Garbage 's greatest hits compilation , Absolute Garbage .

 " Vow " began in rough demo form in January , 1994 , as band members Butch Vig , Duke Erikson and Steve Marker performed sessions in Marker 's basement recording studio and Vig and Marker 's own Smart Studios business in Madison , Wisconsin . After Marker saw Shirley Manson 's group Angelfish on 120 Minutes , the band invited Manson to Smart Studios to sing on a couple of tracks . After a dreadful first audition , she returned to Angelfish , which folded shortly thereafter . Manson decided to test for Garbage again , and after the successful second audition , she began to work on the then @-@ skeletal " Queer " and " Vow " . While performing " Vow " , Manson ad @-@ libbed the lyrics " I can 't use what I can 't abuse " and " like Joan of Arc coming back for more " . The song is written in the key of A minor , set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 126 beats per minute . It opens with Erikson playing a guitar through a noise gate " with a lot of echo on it " , and has a chord progression is A – C @-@ F in the verses , D @-@ B ♭ -A @-@ Em @-@ D @-@ B ♭ -F in the bridge , and F @-@ C @-@ D @-@ G in the chorus , with a segue into F # minor in the interlude . 
 According to Vig , the inspiration for the song was a newspaper article about a woman who had gone back to get revenge on an abusive husband , " so we thought it would be cool to get a bit of retribution in there . " Vig also said he noted violence could also come from psychological stand point by seeing the story of a sado @-@ masochistic couple who could not keep away from each other . Lyrically , Manson claimed " ' Vow ' is about having feelings [ of vengeance ] . You have to face your feelings of revenge and work out why you feel that way . It 's about that conundrum when you 're really angry but in reality you 're in a pitiful state . Angry , twisted , but deep down , vulnerable . " During promotion for the song , Garbage joked to journalists that " Vow " was about John and Lorena Bobbitt . 
 Garbage had not initially planned to release " Vow " as their first single , as a single at all , or even include it on their debut album . The band felt that " Vow " was not representative of the album 's genre @-@ hopping body of work , although they later came to appreciate the situation that led to the song becoming their debut . Manson declared that " now we can do whatever and people won 't know what to expect " , but if the band had instead settled for " of the more clubby tunes " as a single , " we would have been pigeonholed as a dance band and that 's a hard tag to shake " .

 Midway through the recording sessions for the band 's debut album , the band 's label , Mushroom Records , secured the group an inclusion on Volume , a magazine that released compilation albums . However , the deadline given for accepting a track was only three days . The only song the band had completed in any shape or form was " Vow " . After Volume was released in December 1994 , " Vow " began to receive radio airplay from BBC Radio 1 DJs Steve Lamacq , John Peel and Johnnie Walker , and record stores in the United Kingdom began to receive requests for a single that did not yet exist . Word @-@ of @-@ mouth on " Vow " took the track back to the United States , where KROQ @-@ FM in Los Angeles and KNDD in Seattle discovered the song , and put it into rotation on their station playlists . By May 1995 , alternative radio stations across the country had picked up on " Vow " , and it began to receive heavy rotation nationwide . Garbage were still putting the finishing touches to their debut set , which was still three months away from release . 
 On the back of the surprise attention that " Vow " had garnered , the band 's UK record label Mushroom were keen to capitalise on the song . The terms of the licensing deal regarding the inclusion of " Vow " on Volume meant that the track could only be released on a limited basis . Concerned that at the time that their label was only known in the UK for the Neighbours theme tune , Mushroom founded the Discordant label for the sole purpose of launching Garbage . Prior to its release " Vow " had already topped NME 's playlist chart for 5 weeks and received " Single of the Week " status in seven publications . 
 On March 20 , 1995 " Vow " was issued in a limited edition 7 " vinyl format , backed with a remix of the title track and packaged in an embossed aluminium sleeve . A total of 1 @,@ 000 copies were pressed , of which only 934 were made available to buy , barely enough to reach the U.K. Top 100 . " Vow " sold out in one day . The single was the first of six specially packaged Garbage singles Mushroom Records released between 1995 and 1996 , which were costly investment - posting a <unk> per @-@ unit loss on each single - but the investment paid off as each subsequent single became bigger hits . The limited pressing helped the " Vow " single to become a highly sought collectible , with copies selling for £ 100 by the time Mushroom launched follow @-@ up single " Subhuman " .

 In 1996 , when the band 's third North American single " Only Happy When it Rains " had driven the sales of Garbage into the top half of the Billboard 200 for the first time , Almo Sounds considered re @-@ releasing " Vow " , feeling that on its initial release the song had not gotten a full chance at radio and video .

 Bayer asked the group to perform " Vow " live while he filmed the takes for the video shoot . Garbage had never performed live as group prior to this , and had initially had not considered ever performing live onstage . " We set up amps and played guitars . Butch was pounding away and Shirley had a live mic . After the first run @-@ through , we all looked at each other and said , ' This feels really good . ' " Erikson later recalled . The group enjoyed the experience of performing together so much that they quickly changed their minds , and scheduled <unk> later that year . 
 The " Vow " music video was first commercially released on VHS and Video @-@ CD on 1996 's Garbage Video . A remastered version was later included on Garbage 's 2007 greatest hits DVD Absolute Garbage .
