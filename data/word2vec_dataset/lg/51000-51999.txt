 The M3 GMC saw limited service with other countries as it was not widely supplied through the Lend @-@ Lease program . A small batch of 170 vehicles were supplied to Britain , which used them in armored car regiments . They were first used in the Tunisian Campaign with the Royal Dragoons . They were also used in Sicily , Italy , and later in France , but were gradually retired . The Free French Army also used M3s for training before receiving M10 tank destroyers .

 = Óengus I = 
 Óengus son of Fergus ( Pictish : * <unk> map <unk> ; Old Irish : Óengus mac <unk> , " Angus mac Fergus " ) , was king of the Picts from 732 until his death in 761 . His reign can be reconstructed in some detail from a variety of sources . 
 Óengus became the chief king in Pictland following a period of civil war in the late 720s . During his reign , the neighbouring kingdom of Dál Riata was subjugated and the kingdom of Strathclyde was attacked with less success . The most powerful ruler in Scotland for over two decades , he was involved in wars in Ireland and England . Kings from Óengus 's family dominated Pictland until 839 when a disastrous defeat at the hands of Vikings began a new period of instability , which ended with the coming to power of Cináed mac Ailpín . 
 = = Rise to power = = 
 Irish genealogies make Óengus a member of the <unk> of Munster , as a descendant of <unk> <unk> or " <unk> the little Pict " , a mythological emanation or double of <unk> <unk> mac <unk> , legendary son of Conall <unk> , and ancestor of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , rulers of the kingdom of <unk> . The branch of the kindred from which he came , known in the annals as the <unk> Magh <unk> , were said to be located in an area known as Circinn , usually associated with modern Angus and the Mearns . His early life is unknown ; Óengus was middle @-@ aged by the time he entered into history . His close kin included at least two sons , Bridei ( died 736 ) and Talorgan ( died 782 ) , and two brothers , Talorgan ( died 750 ) and Bridei ( died 763 ) . 
 King Nechtan son of Der @-@ Ile abdicated to enter a monastery in 724 and was imprisoned by his successor Drest in 726 . In 728 and 729 , four kings competed for power in Pictland : Drest ; Nechtan ; <unk> , of whom little is known ; and lastly Óengus , who was a partisan of Nechtan , and perhaps his acknowledged heir . 
 Four battles large enough to be recorded in Ireland were fought in 728 and 729 . <unk> was defeated twice by Óengus , after which Nechtan was restored to power . In 729 a battle between supporters of Óengus and Nechtan 's enemies was fought at <unk> Carno ( traditionally Cairn o ' Mount , near <unk> ) where the supporters of Óengus were victorious . Nechtan was restored to the kingship , probably until his death in 732 . On 12 August 729 Óengus defeated and killed Drest in battle at <unk> Derg <unk> , a place which has not been identified . 
 = = Piercing of Dal Riata = = 
 In the 730s , Óengus fought against Dál Riata whose traditional overlords and protectors in Ireland , the Cenél Conaill , were much weakened at this time . A fleet from Dál Riata fought for Flaithbertach mac <unk> , chief of the Cenél Conaill , in his war with Áed Allán of the Cenél <unk> , and suffered heavy losses in 733 . Dál Riata was ruled by Eochaid mac Echdach of the Cenél nGabráin who died in 733 , and the king lists are unclear as to who , if anyone , succeeded him as overking . The Cenél Loairn of north Argyll were ruled by Dúngal mac <unk> whom Eochaid had deposed as overking of Dál Riata in the 720s . 
 Fighting between the Picts , led by Óengus 's son Bridei , and the Dál Riata , led by Talorgan mac <unk> , is recorded in 731 . In 733 , Dúngal mac <unk> " profaned [ the sanctuary ] of Tory Island when he dragged Bridei out of it . " Dúngal , previously deposed as overking of Dál Riata , was overthrown as king of the Cenél Loairn and replaced by his first cousin Muiredach mac <unk> . 
 In 734 Talorgan mac <unk> was handed over to the Picts by his brother and drowned by them . Talorgan son of <unk> was captured near Dún <unk> . He appears to have been the King of Atholl , and was drowned on Óengus 's order in 739 . Dúngal too was a target in this year . He was wounded , the unidentified fortress of Dún <unk> was destroyed , and he " fled into Ireland , to be out of the power of Óengus . " 
 The annals report a second campaign by Óengus against the Dál Riata in 736 . Dúngal , who had returned from Ireland , and his brother <unk> , were captured and bound in chains . The fortresses of <unk> and Dunadd were taken . Muiredach of the Cenél Loairn was no more successful , defeated with heavy loss by Óengus 's brother Talorgan mac Fergusa , perhaps by Loch Awe . A final campaign in 741 saw the Dál Riata again defeated . This was recorded in the Annals of Ulster as <unk> Dál <unk> la h @-@ Óengus m . <unk> , the " smiting of Dál Riata by Óengus son of Fergus " . With this Dál Riata disappears from the record for a generation . 
 It may be that Óengus was involved in wars in Ireland , perhaps fighting with Áed Allán , or against him as an ally of Cathal mac <unk> . The evidence for such involvement is limited . There is the presence of Óengus 's son Bridei at Tory Island , on the north @-@ west coast of Donegal in 733 , close to the lands of Áed Allán 's enemy Flaithbertach mac <unk> . Less certainly , the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland report the presence of a Pictish fleet from Fortriu fighting for Flaithbertach in 733 rather than against him . 
 = = Alt Clut , Northumbria , and Mercia = = 
 In 740 , a war between the Picts and the Northumbrians is reported , during which Æthelbald , King of Mercia , took advantage of the absence of Eadberht of Northumbria to ravage his lands , and perhaps burn York . The reason for the war is unclear , but it has been suggested that it was related to the killing of <unk> son of Eadwulf on Eadberht 's orders . <unk> 's father had been an exile in the north after his defeat in the civil war of 705 – 706 , and it may be that Óengus , or Æthelbald , or both , had tried to place him on the Northumbrian throne . 
 Battles between the Picts and the Britons of Alt Clut , or Strathclyde , are recorded in 744 and again in 750 , when Kyle was taken from Alt Clut by Eadberht of Northumbria . The 750 battle between the Britons and the Picts is reported at a place named <unk> ( perhaps <unk> near Milngavie ) in which Talorgan mac Fergusa , Óengus 's brother , was killed . Following the defeat in 750 , the Annals of Ulster record " the ebbing of the sovereignty of Óengus " . This is thought to refer to the coming to power of Áed Find , son of Eochaid mac Echdach , in all or part of Dál Riata , and his rejection of Óengus 's overlordship . 
 Unlike the straightforward narrative of the attacks on Dál Riata , a number of interpretations have been offered of the relations between Óengus , Eadberht and Æthelbald in the period from 740 to 750 . One suggestion is that Óengus and Æthelbald were allied against Eadberht , or even that they exercised a joint rulership of Britain , or <unk> , Óengus collecting tribute north of the River Humber and Æthelbald south of the Humber . This rests largely on a confused passage in Symeon of Durham 's Historia Regum Anglorum , and it has more recently been suggested that the interpretation offered by Frank Stenton — that it is based on a textual error and that Óengus and Æthelbald were not associated in any sort of joint overlordship — is the correct one . 
 In 756 , Óengus is found campaigning alongside Eadberht of Northumbria . The campaign is reported as follows : 
 In the year of the Lord 's incarnation 756 , king Eadberht in the eighteenth year of his reign , and <unk> , king of Picts led armies to the town of Dumbarton . And hence the Britons accepted terms there , on the first day of the month of August . But on the tenth day of the same month perished almost the whole army which he led from <unk> to <unk> . 
 That <unk> is Govan is now reasonably certain , but the location of <unk> is less so . Although there are very many <unk> , it is Newburgh @-@ on @-@ Tyne near Hexham that has been the preferred location . An alternative interpretation of the events of 756 has been advanced : it identifies <unk> with Newborough by Lichfield in the kingdom of Mercia . A defeat here for Eadberht and Óengus by Æthelbald 's Mercians would correspond with the claim in the Saint Andrews foundation legends that a king named Óengus son of Fergus founded the church there as a thanksgiving to Saint Andrew for saving him after a defeat in Mercia . 
 = = The cult of Saint Andrew = = 
 The story of the foundation of St Andrews , originally <unk> , is not contemporary and may contain many inventions . The Irish annals report the death of " <unk> , abbot of <unk> Móna " , in 747 , making it certain that St Andrews had been founded before that date , probably by Óengus or by Nechtan son of Der @-@ Ilei . It is generally presumed that the St Andrews Sarcophagus was executed at the command of Óengus . Later generations may have conflated this king Óengus with the 9th century king of the same name . The choice of David as a model is , as Alex Woolf notes , an appropriate one : David too was an usurper . 
 The cult of Saint Andrew may have come to Pictland from Northumbria , as had the cult of Saint Peter which had been favoured by Nechtan , and in particular from the monastery at Hexham which was dedicated to Saint Andrew . This apparent connection with the Northumbrian church may have left a written record . Óengus , like his successors and possible kinsmen Caustantín and Eógan , is recorded prominently in the Liber Vitae Ecclesiae Dunelmensis , a list of some 3000 benefactors for whom prayers were said in religious institutions connected with Durham . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Óengus died in 761 , " aged probably more than seventy , ... the dominating figure in the politics of Northern Britain " . His death is reported in the usual brief style by the annalists , except for the continuator of Bede in Northumbria , possibly relying upon a Dál Riata source , who wrote : 
 Óengus , king of the Picts , died . From the beginning of his reign right to the end he perpetrated bloody crimes , like a tyrannical slaughterer . 
 The Pictish Chronicle king lists have it that he was succeeded by his brother Bridei . His son Talorgan was later king , and is the first son of a Pictish king known to have become king . 
 The following 9th @-@ century Irish praise poem from the Book of Leinster is associated with Óengus : 
 Good the day when Óengus took Alba , 
 hilly Alba with its strong chiefs ; 
 he brought battle to palisaded towns , 
 with feet , with hands , with broad shields . 
 An assessment of Óengus is problematic , not least because <unk> sources provide very little information on Scotland in the succeeding generations . His apparent Irish links add to the long list of arguments which challenge the idea that the " Gaelicisation " of eastern Scotland began in the time of Cináed mac Ailpín ; indeed there are good reasons for believing that process began before Óengus 's reign . Many of the Pictish kings until the death of Eógan mac Óengusa in 839 belong to the family of Óengus , in particular the 9th century sons of Fergus , Caustantín and Óengus . 
 The amount of information which has survived about Óengus compared with other Pictish kings , the nature and geographical range of his activities and the length of his reign combine to make King Óengus one of the most significant rulers of the insular Dark Ages .

 = = Plot = = 
 Gautham is a schizophrenic Indian rock musician who is missing 25 percent of his grey matter . He hallucinates a mysterious person he believes is one of the three murderers of his parents . As a child , Gautham was convinced that he was an orphan and assumes that his parents are dead ; he does not remember their names or what they looked like . 
 At one of his concerts , Gautham sees one of the three men and chases him . Sameera , a journalist at the concert , films Gautham fighting his imaginary opponent . Gautham surrenders to the police after " killing " the man , confessing that he killed three men : one in Belfast , one in Pune and one just now in Hyderabad . He is released from custody after Sameera broadcasts the video on television . According to his doctor , if Gautham can hallucinate a person other than the three men , he can be treated . Gautham goes to Goa on vacation . Sameera stalks him , convincing him that two people are stalking him : a journalist who wants to interview him ( imaginary ) , and a person claiming to be his fan ( real ) . Gautham begins to fall in love with Sameera . He saves her from a group of people trying to murder her ; on an isolated island together Gautham learns the truth behind the fourth imaginary person and writes Sameera off as a disturbed journalist . By the time he learns about Sameera 's intentions , she has left for Hyderabad ; Gautham pursues her . 
 In Hyderabad , Gautham accidentally spoils Sameera 's birthday plans , infuriating her . Although he is convinced that he has made up an enemy to cope with being an orphan , a mysterious person tries to kill Sameera . Gautham saves her and proposes marriage , which she accepts . Sameera learns that the mysterious person is Antonio Rosarios , a Goa @-@ based crime boss who wants to kill her because she tried to expose the presence of hydrogen cyanide in seeds sold by Rosarios ' company , <unk> . Gautham meets Rosarios in the lobby of Sameera 's office building . Assuming that he is an illusion , he shoots Rosarios in his head . By the time Gautham realises Rosarios is real he is dead , and Gautham learns that his parents were murdered . He catches an aged taxi driver who was stalking him ( one of the three men he imagined ) , and learns that two London @-@ based Indians ( one of whom was Rosarios ) killed his parents ; his father gave the taxi driver a bag to give to Gautham . In the bag is an old Rubik 's Cube , a key and a British coin . 
 Gautham and Sameera go to London , where they and their driver <unk> Singh escape from a murder attempt ; Gautham 's manager , Michael , is killed . The Rubik 's Cube , when solved a certain way , reveals a safe @-@ deposit @-@ box number in which Gautham finds a preserved rice sample . After escaping another murder attempt in a parking lot , he eludes the police and the two men with Sameera and Singh 's help . One of the men — a fan — seeks revenge for his father ( one of the other murderers , according to the aged taxi driver ) , who was killed by Gautham in Belfast when he performed there . Gautham learns that the aged taxi driver he met previously is a businessman and the murderer ; the person hit by the businessman 's car in Gautham 's presence was the actual , innocent taxi driver . 
 Gautham and the businessman confront each other , and the businessman says that he and Gautham 's father were good friends and fellow scientists . They worked on cultivating Golden rice , a variety which could grow in any weather . When Gautham 's father refused to sell it in favour of distributing it globally for free , the businessman and Rosarios killed his parents . When he refuses to tell Gautham about his parents , Gautham kills him . On his way to the airport , Gautham passes the school he had attended and hears children singing a rhyme . It reminds him of a similar rhyme he learned from his mother , and he remembers his way back to his house . At his house ( a dilapidated villa ) Gautham finds a photo of his parents , Chandrasekhar and Kalyani . He later introduces the rice variety at a global convention as " the second green revolution " , and the film ends with Gautham standing in his field of Golden rice .

 After completing 100 % Love ( 2011 ) , Sukumar began working on a psychological thriller with Mahesh Babu in mind as the protagonist because he felt that Mahesh had universal appeal . An incident in which a bus driver talked about a young boy who said that his parents were murdered on his bus became the story 's base . Mahesh met Sukumar on the set of Businessman ( 2012 ) in Goa , and listened to the script for 25 minutes . Although Sukumar could not describe the story well in the noisy restaurant , Mahesh agreed to appear in the film within half an hour . Sukumar worked on 1 : Nenokkadine 's script for two months , and considered it his dream project . 
 Ram Achanta , Gopichand Achanta and Anil Sunkara of 14 Reels Entertainment , who produced Mahesh 's Dookudu ( 2011 ) and Aagadu ( 2014 ) , agreed to produce 1 : Nenokkadine after hearing the script . Asked about his frequent collaboration with them , Mahesh said that Sukumar clearly indicated the risk of budget escalation and longer production and said that he and Sukumar could be viewed as criminals if it was produced by someone else . Sunil Lulla and Andrew <unk> were credited as co @-@ producers , and Koti Paruchuri was its executive producer . The film , introduced on 12 February 2012 in Hyderabad , received its title in May 2013 .

 Mahesh agreed to be fit and healthy , since the film emphasised action scenes . He followed a 12 @-@ week Dynamic Transformation Plan ( DTP ) supervised by Kris Gethin , developing his abdominal muscles and losing weight . Mahesh then followed a Yoda Three Training regime ( <unk> ) , supervised by Neil Hill , further developing his muscles . His stylist , Ashwin <unk> , said that his appearance and style would be " sophisticated and classy " in the film . Sukumar had Mahesh wear eyeglasses , since the director felt that audiences tended to consider a bespectacled character to be <unk> and positive , and the actor 's hairstyle was changed . 
 Tamannaah was considered for the female lead , since the producers were impressed with her performance in 100 % Love . She declined the offer , citing scheduling conflicts , and the Producer 's Council told her not to sign for any new films until she completed her current assignments . After auditioning two actresses , Sukumar chose Kajal Aggarwal in March 2012 as the female lead . She was replaced by Kriti Sanon in October 2012 , due to scheduling conflicts . Sanon was signed for <unk> ( 2014 ) after completing one shooting schedule for 1 : Nenokkadine , and divided her time between the films . Sanon , who was involved in several action scenes filmed on the sea , was apprehensive about a scene in which Mahesh took her from a yacht since she did not knew how to swim . 
 Mahesh 's seven @-@ year @-@ old son , Gautham Krishna , was chosen to play the younger version of the protagonist in his Telugu cinema debut . According to Sukumar , Gautham looked like the actor did as a child . When the director approached Mahesh and his wife , Namrata <unk> , Gautham Krishna was only six and they were apprehensive . His introduction scene was filmed silently by Peter Hein , since the boy was afraid of gunfire . Naveen <unk> played a supporting role as Mahesh 's friend in the film , and Vikram Singh was signed as an antagonist . Nassar , Pradeep Rawat , Kelly Dorji , Sayaji Shinde and Anu Hasan were cast in other supporting roles . 
 Jacqueline Fernandez was approached to perform an item number in the film , but the producers failed to make a deal and instead signed Sophie Choudry after seeing her performance in " <unk> Re <unk> " from Shootout at Wadala ( 2013 ) . For her first Telugu song , Choudry joined the film 's set in September 2013 . Sukumar said about the item number , " It 's a superstar ’ s film and it should reach all . Item numbers are common these days and people expect to see them . The situation was that Mahesh had to go to a pub to get information about the person he was looking for . So there was occasion to put in an item number " .

 R. Rathnavelu , who collaborated with Sukumar on Arya ( 2004 ) and Jagadam ( 2007 ) , was the film 's director of photography in his return to Telugu cinema after seven years . Rathnavelu called the film " more challenging aesthetically " and compared it to Enthiran ( 2010 ) , which he considered his technically @-@ toughest film . He created the film 's visual style in a week with a variety of cameras , such as Red Epic , Body <unk> , <unk> and an underwater scuba camera . For the climaxes , Rathnavelu shifted from chrome to black @-@ and @-@ white to full colour in synchronisation with the story 's mood . 
 Rathnavelu had to address the protagonist 's mood swings and hallucinations , replicating scenes with minor differences . The film was shot in locations with a variety of climates , and new technical crews were hired in those places . Sukumar said , " We looked at world technicians and saw them work and can use whatever we learnt " and called it a " new yet learning experience " [ sic ] . 
 Sukumar 's usual composer , Devi Sri Prasad , was chosen for the film 's soundtrack and score in Prasad 's first Mahesh film . He went through the script and discussed it with Sukumar , who felt that Prasad translated his vision in the background score . Prasad finished re @-@ recording the film 's second half in four days . Eleven @-@ year @-@ old journalist <unk> <unk> 's father was an associate director of the film , and Prasad emailed him the rhyme 's tune with several stills from the scene ; his daughter wrote the lyrics for the rhyme . P. <unk> Reddy was the film 's <unk> . 
 Peter Hein choreographed 1 : Nenokkadine 's action sequences , and Prem Rakshith choreographed its songs . <unk> Hari Prasad and Palnati Surya Pratap worked on the film 's story , and Y. K. Arjun , Thota Srinivas and <unk> Venkateswara Rao developed the script . Jeremy Zimmerman was credited with the screenplay , assisted by Sunil Madhav . V. Srinivas Mohan was 1 : Nenokkadine 's visual @-@ effects producer and R. C.

 Principal photography began on 23 April 2012 , with the filming of " Who R U ? " featuring Mahesh and Aggarwal supervised by Prem Rakshith on a set at Annapurna Studios in Hyderabad . Six hundred models performed in the song , and about 2 @,@ 000 people participated in the shoot . After its completion , an action sequence was filmed . The first shooting schedule wrapped up , and Mahesh returned to the set of Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu ( 2013 ) . The second schedule began on 31 May 2012 on house and colony sets at <unk> Studios in Hyderabad , including scenes with Mahesh and others . Scenes of Mahesh at the police station were also part of the schedule . 
 Since the actor had allotted a block of time to Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu , 1 : Nenokkadine 's filming was delayed . When the former neared completion , he resumed work on 1 : Nenokkadine in late September 2012 in Hyderabad . Filming continued in Goa in mid @-@ October , after a four @-@ month hiatus , and a song with Mahesh and others was filmed in late October . The Goa schedule wrapped up on 1 November , with half the filming completed . Mahesh took a break to promote Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu , returning to the set on 23 January 2013 . The next shooting schedule , which began on 18 March , lasted for three weeks . Night scenes focusing on Mahesh and others were filmed in <unk> in mid @-@ April . 
 The next schedule , which began on 18 June , filmed in London and Belfast for 60 days . At the Causeway Pictures studio in Northern Ireland , 1 : Nenokkadine was the first Telugu film shot in Belfast . Hollywood stunt co @-@ ordinator Conrad <unk> supervised stunts by Mahesh and others . Rathnavelu called the action scene in a London car park " one of the most satisfying " things he had ever done . The scene takes place during a power failure , with the headlights of motorcycles chasing the protagonist the only sources of light . To film the scene , Rathnavelu used LED lamps and three <unk> ; smoke was pumped into the air to create a backdrop . When scenes were filmed on one of London 's three main bridges , traffic was stopped on both sides of the bridge for more than eight hours . 
 After London , filming continued in Bangkok in August 2013 and in Hyderabad in September ; some scenes were filmed in and near Banjara Hills . The last shooting schedule began in Bangkok in early October 2013 , with action scenes supervised by Peter Hein . The remaining dialogue scenes were filmed in Bangalore in mid @-@ October 2013 .

According to The New Indian Express , its audience was " gripped through the whole film , but not for the right reasons " : " Ending with a heralding of a second ' Green Revolution ' and carrying on a legacy that aims at a food Utopia , you wish the movie continued with the schizophrenia and ended in an asylum " . Karthik Pasupulate of The Times of India gave the film three out of five stars : " The [ Telugu cinema ] format of six songs , five fights and loads of entertainment and melodrama makes it impossible to respectably adapt racy Hollywood styled suspense thrillers " . Radhika Rajamani of Rediff called the film " inordinately long , with repetitive scenes and slow and sluggish narration " , and a " sense of ennui set in after a point " ; however , Rajamani praised the lead actors ' performances . Sify gave the film 2 @.@ 75 out of five stars : " In 1 Nenokkadine , individual sequences are cool but the same cannot be said if we see it in totality . Apart from Mahesh <unk> stunning performance , the drive of the film is completely off the track . It disappoints . " Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle gave the film 2 @.@ 5 out of five stars : " To say it in a line , the film falls short of expectations and disappoints film goers , especially the fans of Mahesh Babu " . Kavirayani called Rathnavelu 's cinematography its " saving grace " , praising the lead pair 's performances . IndiaGlitz also gave 1 Nenokkadine 2 @.@ 5 out of five stars , saying that the film had the capacity to " tank without a trace if Mahesh Babu 's character did not come with a difference " ; the actor " looks that pained man every bit " , expressing " intense emotions without much effort " . 
 Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu wrote , " How often do we get to watch a Telugu film where the audience , along with the protagonist and supporting characters , is also required to think and distinguish between events unfolding in real and imaginary spaces ? " and called 1 Nenokkadine a " visually stunning " film . Sridhar Vivan of Bangalore Mirror gave the film 3 @.@ 5 out of five stars : " As the film tries out a refined or reformed revenge saga , it needs to be seen whether 1 Nenokkadine works at the box office . If it does , it is a good sign for Telugu cinema " . A. S. <unk> of The Times of India wrote , " The first half of 1 : Nenokkadine is good and will keep you wanting for more . The story has a few interesting twists and turns , in the second half too to keep the audience glued to the screen " , and Sukumar " should be commended for superb attempt in choosing to make a film that has not been explored in Telugu movies " . Shekhar of Oneindia called the film a " brilliant psychological thriller " : " The first half of 1 : Nenokkadine is excellent and will impress all classes of audience . A few sentimental scenes slow down the pace of narration in the second half . But the superb climax that lasts for 15 minutes will compensate it . The viewers will surely walk out of theatre with contented hearts " .

 = Kongō @-@ class ironclad = 
 The Kongō @-@ class ironclads ( <unk> ) were a pair of armored corvettes built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) by British shipyards in the 1870s . A British offer to purchase the two ships during the Russo @-@ Turkish War in 1878 was refused . They became training ships in 1887 and made training cruises to the Mediterranean and to countries on the edge of the Pacific Ocean . The ships returned to active duty during the First Sino @-@ Japanese War of 1894 – 95 where one participated in the Battle of the Yalu River and both in the Battle of Weihaiwei . The Kongō @-@ class ships resumed their training duties after the war , although they played a minor role in the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 . They were reclassified as survey ships in 1906 and were sold for scrap in 1910 and 1912 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Tensions between Japan and China heightened after the former launched its punitive expedition against Taiwan in May 1874 in retaliation of the murder of a number of shipwrecked sailors by the Paiwan aborigines . China inquired into the possibility of buying ironclad warships from Great Britain and Japan was already negotiating with the Brazilian government about the purchase of the ironclad Independencia then under construction in Britain . The Japanese terminated the negotiations with the Brazilians in October after the ship was badly damaged upon launching and the expeditionary force was about to withdraw from Taiwan . The crisis illustrated the need to reinforce the IJN and a budget request was submitted that same month by Acting Navy Minister Kawamura Sumiyoshi for ¥ 3 @.@ 9 – 4 @.@ 2 million to purchase three warships from abroad . No Japanese shipyard was able to build ships of this size so they were ordered from Great Britain . This was rejected as too expensive and a revised request of ¥ 2 @.@ 3 million was approved later that month . Nothing was done until March 1875 when Kawamura proposed to buy one ironclad for half of the money authorized and use the rest for shipbuilding and gun production at the Yokosuka Shipyard . No response was made by the Prime Minister 's office before the proposal was revised to use all of the allocated money to buy three ships , one armored frigate and two armored corvettes of composite construction to be designed by the prominent British naval architect Sir Edward Reed , formerly the Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy . Reed would also supervise the construction of the ships for an honorarium of five percent of the construction cost . The Prime Minister 's office approved the revised proposal on 2 May and notified the Japanese consul , Ueno <unk> , that navy officers would be visiting to negotiate the contract with Reed . 
 Commander Matsumura Junzō arrived in London on 21 July and gave Reed the specifications for the ships . Reed responded on 3 September with an offer , excluding armament , that exceeded the amount allocated in the budget . Ueno signed the contracts for all three ships on 24 September despite this problem because Reed was scheduled to depart for a trip to Russia and the matter had to be concluded before his departure . Ueno had informed the Navy Ministry about the costs before signing , but Kawamura 's response to postpone the order for the armored frigate did not arrive until 8 October . The totals for all three contracts came to £ 433 @,@ 850 or ¥ 2 @,@ 231 @,@ 563 and did not include the armament . These were ordered from Krupp with a 50 percent down payment of £ 24 @,@ 978 . The government struggled to provide the necessary money even though the additional expenses had been approved by the Prime Minister 's office on 5 June 1876 , especially as more money was necessary to fully equip the ships for sea and to provision them for the delivery voyage to Japan .

 The ships were fitted with three 172 @-@ millimeter ( 6 @.@ 8 in ) Krupp rifled breech @-@ loading ( RBL ) guns and six RBL 152 @-@ millimeter ( 6 @.@ 0 in ) Krupp guns . All of the 172 @-@ millimeter guns were positioned as chase guns , two forward and one aft . The forward chase guns were pivot @-@ mounted and could traverse 122 degrees from straight ahead on their side of the ship . The aft gun could traverse a total of 125 degrees to each side . The 152 @-@ millimeter guns were mounted on the broadside . Each ship also carried two short 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) guns for use ashore or mounted on the ships ' boats . 
 The armor @-@ piercing shell of the 172 @-@ millmeter gun weighed 132 pounds ( 59 @.@ 9 kg ) .

 In February 1878 , during the Russo @-@ Turkish War , the British were not willing to accept the occupation of the Ottoman Turkish capital of Constantinople by Russian forces and began to prepare for war . The British government made informal inquiries about purchasing the two corvettes , but this was firmly rejected by the Japanese government . The ships sailed from Britain in February – March and arrived in Yokohama two months later . They were sailed to Japan by hired British crews as the IJN lacked the necessary experience . The ships were not formally turned over to the navy until 10 July when a formal ceremony was held in Yokohama attended by the Meiji Emperor and many senior government officials . The ships were opened for public tours after the ceremony . 
 Kongō hosted the Duke of Genoa when he visited Japan in late 1879 . Hiei made port visits in China and in the Persian Gulf the following year . In 1885 – 86 both ships were assigned to the Small Standing Fleet . They became training ships in 1887 and they both made a training cruise to the Mediterranean in 1889 – 90 with cadets from the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy . Hiei and Kongō ferried the 69 survivors of the wrecked Ertuğrul back to Turkey where the ships ' officers were received by Sultan Abdul Hamid II . The ships also carried a class of naval cadets . Until the end of the century , one or the other of the Kongō @-@ class ships made the annual cadet cruise , usually to countries bordering the Pacific Ocean . Kongō was in Honolulu on one of these cruises during the Hawaiian Revolution of 1893 , although the ship played no part in the affair . She returned to Hawaii the next year and briefly became the patrol ship there until the start of the First Sino @-@ Japanese War later in 1894 . Kongō did not participate in the Battle of the Yalu River , but Hiei was there . She was heavily engaged by Chinese ships and was damaged enough that she was forced to break off the action . Hiei was repaired after the battle and both ships were present during the Battle of Weihaiwei in early 1895 , although neither saw any significant combat . 
 The Kongō @-@ class ships were redesignated as 3rd @-@ class coast defense ships in 1898 although they continued their training duties . They played a minor role in the Russo @-@ Japanese War before they were reclassified as survey ships in 1906 . Kongō was stricken from the Navy List in 1909 and sold the next year for scrap . Hiei was struck from the Navy List two years after her sister ship and was sold before 25 March 1912 . 
 = Jessica Jones ( season 1 ) = 
 The first season of the American web television series Jessica Jones , which is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name , follows a former superhero who opens her own detective agency after an end to her superhero career at the hands of Kilgrave . It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe ( MCU ) , sharing continuity with the films and other television series of the franchise . The season was produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios and Tall Girls Productions , with Melissa Rosenberg serving as showrunner . 
 Krysten Ritter stars as Jones , while David Tennant plays Kilgrave . The two are joined by principal cast members Mike Colter , Rachael Taylor , Wil <unk> , Erin Moriarty , Eka Darville , and Carrie @-@ Anne Moss . Jessica Jones entered development in late 2013 , with Rosenberg reworking a series she had previously developed for ABC . Ritter was cast as Jones in December 2014 , with production on Jessica Jones taking place in New York City from February to August 2015 . The season addresses issues of rape and assault with realism and a grounded tone , and was always intended to be far more " adult " than other Marvel projects , particularly in terms of sex . The show 's cinematography took inspiration from noir , while visual effects house Shade VFX focused on creating " invisible " effects that would support its realistic approach . 
 The first two episodes of the season premiered in New York City on November 17 , 2015 , with the full season of 13 episodes released on Netflix on November 20 to an estimated high viewership and critical acclaim . Critics praised the performances of Ritter and Tennant , as well as the series ' noir tone , approach to sexuality , and coverage of darker topics such as rape , assault and posttraumatic stress disorder . The season was awarded a Peabody Award in the category of " Entertainment and Children 's programs " . A second season of Jessica Jones was ordered on January 17 , 2016 .

 In October 2013 , Marvel and Disney announced that they would provide Netflix with live action series centered around Daredevil , Jessica Jones , Iron Fist , and Luke Cage , leading up to a miniseries based on the Defenders . Melissa Rosenberg was brought on to <unk> the Jessica Jones series , to be reconfigured as a " page one do @-@ over " from an original project she had developed in December 2010 for ABC . In December 2014 , the official title was revealed to be Marvel 's A.K.A. Jessica Jones , but that was shortened to Marvel 's Jessica Jones in June 2015 . The season consists of 13 hour @-@ long episodes . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 The writers for the series worked in Los Angeles , with one member of the writing team on set in New York for filming . Actress Carrie @-@ Anne Moss talked about how the scripts developed through the production of the series , explaining that the dialogue usually did not change much while filming , but scenes were altered to accommodate the filming locations when necessary . Rosenberg stated that , since Jones is a private investigator , there would be some procedural elements to the show , " but that ’ s not our focus . There are cases . In particular , there is a large case that carries over the season . " Elaborating on this , Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb said that the " fun about being a private detective is that the line between what ’ s legal and what ’ s not legal gets very blurred .... her drive is not always necessarily to solve the case , as much as it is to go , ' Okay , can I pay the rent ? How am I going to get through this day ? ' " He also added that inspiration for the series came from " the noir films from the ‘ 40s " and " film [ s ] like Chinatown . " 
 Describing the tone of the series , Loeb said , " When we first started talking about Daredevil , we promised that we were telling a story that was first a crime drama and then a superhero show . This is more of a psychological thriller . This speaks to when you think about what happened to Jessica and what sort of destroyed her life and how she tried to put it together , and then to have to confront the person who deconstructed her world , that ’ s a very powerful , emotional place to start from . " On approaching rape and trauma in the series , Rosenberg wanted to avoid actually showing rape , which she called " lazy storytelling " and often a way to " spice up " male characters , and preferred to just make the trauma a part of the characters ' everyday lives rather than an " issue " for the series to tackle . When asked about the adult nature of the series , including the use of sex , Rosenberg explained that Marvel would only not allow showing nudity and the use of the word ' fuck ' in the series .

 The main cast for the season includes Krysten Ritter as Jessica Jones , Mike Colter as Luke Cage , Rachael Taylor as Patricia " Trish " Walker , Wil <unk> as Will Simpson , Erin Moriarty as Hope <unk> , Eka Darville as Malcolm Ducasse , Carrie @-@ Anne Moss as Jeri Hogarth , and David Tennant as Kilgrave . 
 Appearing in recurring roles for the season are Susie <unk> as Pam , Colby Minifie and Kieran <unk> as Robyn and Ruben , Clarke Peters as Oscar Clemons , Michael <unk> and Lisa Emery as Albert and Louise Thompson , and Robin <unk> as Wendy Ross @-@ Hogarth . Danielle Ferland , Gillian <unk> , Ryan Farrell , and Paul Pryce also recur as victims of Kilgrave who join a support group established by Jones , while Rosario Dawson and Royce Johnson reprise their roles of Claire Temple and Brett Mahoney , respectively , from Daredevil . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 Stephanie Maslansky returned as the costume designer for Jessica Jones from Daredevil , and was assisted on the first episode by Jenn <unk> , who crafted Jessica Jones ' leather jacket , faded jeans , and boots costume . On Jones 's costume , Maslansky said she " considers her clothing to be an armor and a shield and something that helps her maintain a distance from other people and privacy . It keeps her from having to deal with the rest of humanity in a certain sort of way . " At least 10 versions of Jones 's jacket were made , which started as an Acne Studios leather motorcycle jacket that had any " bells and whistles and any additional superfluous design details " removed . 20 pairs of jeans were used , with both sets of clothing being aged and distressed . 
 Because Jones 's costume does not evolve much throughout the series , Maslansky used flashbacks to show how her costume had evolved to the present day : for ' pre @-@ Kilgrave ' Jessica Jones , Maslansky gave the character " more pulled together " clothes , albeit " still kind of edgy " clothes that did not change who she was as a character , but were just " different " . For instance , in a flashback to Jones working in a corporate environment , she does not wear a suit , instead " wear [ s ] her jeans and find [ s ] a really cool jacket , maybe a vintage thing , maybe something that she borrowed from Trish " . For a flashback where Jones wears a large sandwich costume , a " variety " of costumes were ordered online , with the chosen suit then distressed to " look dirty and old " ; " a mere shadow of its former sandwich self , " becoming " more of a hoagie than a sandwich . " In another flashback , Jones imagines escaping Kilgrave 's control . The bright yellow dress the character wears in the dream sequence was chosen for its juxtaposition to the character 's real situation , with Maslansky calling it " so beautiful and so free and so light " . 
 For Kilgrave , Maslansky used many suits created by designer Paul Smith , rather than custom @-@ making them as she originally planned , as Smith " was all about purple " in the previous fashion season . On the suits , Maslansky added that the designers " wanted to find a place where we could utilize clothing in shades of purple , but not go so over the top that it would look silly and that he would stop feeling ominous or menacing . " Expanding on this , Maslansky called purple a traditionally " fairly friendly color , and he ’ s anything but friendly . So I had to find ways to make him be ominous and frightening and terrifying . I found that I needed the right proportion of shades of purple to other shades that were similar : navy , black , maroon . " Maslansky felt Luke Cage was also someone " who wears his clothing like an armor , " with his wardrobe consisting of T @-@ shirts , jeans , leather jackets or an army jacket . For a character like Trish Walker , who does not have the same kind of " statement costume " as Jones , Maslansky tried to create a certain character style . Maslansky said that Walker 's uniform is fashion , so " even when she was hanging around the house , she was wearing a pair of Rag and Bone jeans with a Chloé top , and this was her version of a T @-@ shirt and jeans . " Maslansky added that Robin was " a blast to dress " because of her " quirky " personality , yet she was still able to " put herself together aesthetically . " For Malcolm , as his story progressively became brighter throughout the season , so did his wardrobe , becoming " a little brighter and a little more hopeful . " 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 In February 2014 , Marvel announced that Jessica Jones would be filmed in New York City . In April , Marvel Comics ' editor @-@ in @-@ chief Joe Quesada stated that the show would be filming in areas of Brooklyn and Long Island City that still look like the old Hell ’ s Kitchen , in addition to sound stage work . The series went into production in February 2015 in The Bronx at Lehman College with the working title Violet , and aimed to film each episode over nine days , on average . Filming concluded in mid @-@ late August , with other locations in New York City used including : the East Village 's Horseshoe Bar for Luke 's Bar ; the 33rd Street PATH station and a PATH train ; the 101st Street area for the exterior of Jessica 's apartment ( with the interior apartment settings created on a sound stage ) ; Douglaston , Queens for Jessica 's childhood home ; the Angel <unk> Center for Jessica and Luke 's fight in " AKA Take a Bloody Number " ; and <unk> Savings Bank Tower and Pier 88 for locations in " AKA Smile " . 
 Concerning inspirations on the series , Loeb revealed that " Chinatown ... is one of the things that influenced Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Gaydos when they created the character . So those kind of beautiful , long , wide expansive shots , where people sort of come into frame and go back out of frame and someone ’ s in the foreground and then someone is way in the background and they ’ re having a conversation , that ’ s the stuff that makes it interesting . " Director of Photography Manuel Billeter and episodic director S. J. Clarkson took inspiration from the comics in terms of their color palette , while looking to the works of Wong Kar @-@ wai as reference to create " unconventional " compositions , with Billeter explaining , " There were a lot of foreground elements [ and ] headroom as well , and we never wanted to show an open frame . We wanted to create a sense of claustrophobia . " Billeter shot the season with a Red Epic Dragon camera in 4K resolution , with 5K used for some visual effects shots , and with Panavision <unk> lenses ; he focused mostly on static frames and " good composition " , but did occasionally employ a camera dolly or steadicam . For lighting , Billeter noted that many New York street lamps had been changed from sodium @-@ vapor lamps to LEDs , so he tried to recreate the " warm , dirty color of sodium vapor " for night exterior scenes . 
 Production designer Loren Weeks described Marvel 's Hell 's Kitchen as having " a little more [ East ] Village quality . " To achieve the explosion at Luke 's Bar , Weeks said , " We could not take out the windows [ at Horseshoe Bar ] , which are [ made up of ] multiple small colored glass and metal frames . We didn ’ t know frankly when we picked that location that we would have that explosion ... What we did was build a fireproof box in the entrance and we had a cannon in there which blew out debris and smoke and some fire . And then we did a lighting effect on the inside and then the rest of the explosion was handled by visual effects . " For the scenes on the PATH train and station , location manager Jason Farrar noted that production had exclusive use of the tracks and platform during the day when ridership was low to get their shots .

 Shade VFX created over 600 effects shots for the season , with " invisible " effects " the showpiece , helping to push forward the darker elements the series . " Therefore , effects supervisor Karl <unk> and producer Julie Long worked closely with the crew on set to " execute stunts , set extensions , explosions , <unk> and fire sequences " while filming , rather than have Shade create those effects digitally . An effect that Shade was required to create was tinting Kilgrave 's skin purple " in a few key scenes " where he is using his powers , a nod to the comic iteration 's purple @-@ skinned appearance .

 On existing in the MCU , specifically in the same world as the other Netflix series , Rosenberg said , " Jessica Jones is a very , very different show than Daredevil . We exist in a cinematic universe , [ and ] the mythology of the universe is connected , but they look very different , tonally they ’ re very different … That was my one concern coming in : Am I going to have to fit into Daredevil or what ’ s come before ? And the answer is no . " On references or " easter eggs " in the series , Rosenberg explained that " A little is always there and in the writer ’ s room we have some fanboys that know all this stuff and they ’ re all <unk> out with different stuff .... a lot of references are to the [ Alias comic ] . " She also said that nods to the larger MCU are in the series , with each episode having a " little something in it . " 
 <unk> Hogarth is closely associated with Iron Fist in the comics , and also worked with Luke Cage as part of those characters ' Heroes for Hire team . Like Daredevil , the series makes references to the events of The Avengers and the Avengers ( specifically Hulk and Captain America , though not by name ) . Jessica also mentions Angela del Toro as another private investigator , who in the comics is the hero White Tiger and has connections with K 'un @-@ Lun and Iron Fist . Paul Tassi , writing for Forbes , was disappointed with how the series fit into the larger MCU , feeling the series seemed " removed from the world of The Avengers " and did not acknowledge Daredevil enough given that " it ’ s supposed to be sharing at least this little corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with it . " Eric Francisco of Inverse countered that Jessica Jones 's lack of overt connections to the MCU was " the show 's chief advantage . Besides demonstrating how physically wide open the MCU 's scope really is , Jessica Jones also proves the MCU 's thematic durability . "

 Jessica Jones was released on November 20 , 2015 on the streaming service Netflix , in all territories where it is available , in Ultra HD 4K . In January 2015 , a month after Marvel announced a 2015 release for the series , Sarandos had said that it was " too hard to say now " if the series would actually release in 2015 , with Netflix 's plan to release a Marvel series approximately a year apart from each other after Daredevil 's April 2015 release . However , Netflix soon confirmed that the series would indeed release in 2015 , announcing the November 20 release date in September . 
 = = = Marketing = = = 
 Disney Consumer Products created a small line of products to cater to a more adult audience , given the show ’ s edgier tone . Paul Gitter , senior VP of Marvel Licensing for Disney Consumer Products explained that the focus would be more on teens and adults than very young people , with products at outlets like Hot Topic . Additionally , a Marvel Knights merchandise program was created to support the series , which creates new opportunities for individual product lines and collector focused products . Licensing partners wanted to pair up with Marvel , despite this not being a film project , given its previous successes . 
 In May 2015 , Marvel announced plans to reprint Alias , the comic that the series is based on , with new covers from David Mack , the original cover artist on the comic who is also providing artwork for the series ' opening credits . The reprints , which were all released digitally in June 2015 , and up to issue 15 in two trade paperbacks in September , were intended to both celebrate the history of Jessica Jones , and introduce new audiences to the character ahead of the release of the series . In late September through early October , Marvel and Netflix released short teasers for the series , which chronicled a day of Jones ' life . Also in early October , Marvel digitally released a 12 @-@ page one @-@ shot comic by the original Alias creative team — Bendis , Gaydos , and Mack — set in the universe of the television series . The one @-@ shot was created as an exclusive for New York Comic Con , where a print version was distributed . The comic sees Jessica Jones coming into contact with Daredevil character Turk Barrett , and includes a short sequence featuring Daredevil , to celebrate " the connective tissue that will build between the series . " Also during New York Comic Con , Marvel set up a street marketing campaign , and screened " AKA Ladies Night " on October 10 , while at the Marvel Booth fans could take their picture with the Alias Investigations desk , with Kilgrave 's eyes appearing in the background of the final animation . Marvel additionally partnered with Uber during the event to provide select riders with complimentary trips to or from the convention in custom designed SUVs . 
 A full trailer was released at the end of October , with Meagan Damore of Comic Book Resources feeling that it helped establish the same tone as Daredevil and introduced " Marvel 's creepiest villain yet " with Kilgrave . She also compared Jessica to some of the other female characters of the MCU — Black Widow , Melinda May , and Peggy Carter — feeling that Jessica stood out from the others because she does not have " a sense of togetherness " and was the most relatable because of her struggle with trauma , and that the series would have the amount of creative space required to explore the character that the other female characters were lacking . A second trailer was released on November 10 , 2015 . Sarene Leeds of The Wall Street Journal felt that this trailer highlighted empowerment , compared to the first that " was about illustrating the fear behind Jones ’ s past " . The season held its premiere in New York City on November 17 .

 As Netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their original series , Symphony Technology Group compiled data for the series based on a sample size of 15 @,@ 000 people using software on their phones that measures television viewing by detecting a program 's sound . According to Symphony , from September to December 2015 , episodes of Jessica Jones averaged 4 @.@ 8 million viewers during a 35 @-@ day viewing cycle . The data was presented by Alan Wurtzel , NBCUniversal president of research and media development , in a presentation aimed to provide " perspective " when stating " digital platforms are hurting the traditional TV business " . Netflix CCO Ted Sarandos responded to the data by saying that " the whole methodology and the measurement and the data itself doesn ’ t reflect any sense of reality of anything that we keep track of . " A further study from Symphony , for the same time period , found Jessica Jones to be one of the four most watched series in the 18 to 24 demographic , ahead of any broadcast network series .

 The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 93 % approval rating with an average rating of 8 @.@ 1 / 10 based on 54 reviews . The website 's critical consensus reads , " Jessica Jones builds a multifaceted drama around its engaging antihero , delivering what might be Marvel 's strongest TV franchise to date . " Metacritic , which uses a weighted average , assigned a score of 81 out of 100 based on 31 critics , indicating what the website considers to be " universal acclaim " . 
 The early screening of the first episode at New York Comic Con was met by a very positive reaction from the crowd . George Marston of Newsarama gave the first episode a 10 out of 10 , saying the series " strikes a balance between self @-@ aware noir and Marvel ’ s first flirtations with psychological horror .... not just another hit for Marvel and Netflix , but a landmark moment for female superheroes on TV . " Eric Goldman of IGN felt that " Jessica Jones starts out with a strong premiere episode that ... easily goes further than anything in the MCU in terms of sexuality . " He called Ritter " a commendably tough , sardonic " Jessica Jones and praised the supporting cast for the strong impressions they made , later scoring the episode an 8 @.@ 5 out of 10 . Evan Valentine of Collider.com gave the episode 5 stars out of 5 , feeling that Tennant would " ascend to the same level as Tom Hiddleston ’ s Loki and Vincent D 'Onofrio ’ s Wilson Fisk as one of the cornerstones of villainy in the MCU " . Katharine <unk> of io9 also had positive thoughts on " AKA Ladies Night " , highlighting the episode 's use of light and color , especially with purple , and the way it portrays New York as how it " actually looks — not overly bright and shiny and clean , but not suffering a never @-@ ending power @-@ outage either " . Abraham Riesman noted the episode 's presentation of sexuality , which " was shockingly and refreshingly honest " , compared to Marvel 's other films and television series . He concluded by applauding the series ' bringing up of the topics of rape and PTSD . 
 Reviewing the first seven episodes of the series , Maureen Ryan of Variety gave positive thoughts on Jessica Jones , stating , " The show , which features an exceptional performance from Krysten Ritter and sure @-@ handed guidance from executive producer Melissa Rosenberg , is not just a contender for the title Best Marvel @-@ related TV property ; in a supremely crowded TV scene , it is one of the year ’ s most distinctive new dramas . " Jack Shepard of The Independent , also on the first seven episodes , felt the series " not only matches [ Daredevil ] but exceeds expectations . " Shepard gave exceptional praise to Tennant 's Kilgrave , feeling he was one of the best villains produced by Marvel , and possibly " the best on @-@ screen comic book villain since Heath Ledger ’ s Joker . " Forbes ' Merrill Barr stated that after seeing the first seven episodes , " the answer is a resounding yes " if lightning could strike twice for Marvel Television , claiming , " In no uncertain terms , Jessica Jones is the best thing Marvel Television has ever produced . It contains all the hopeful anticipation of [ Agents of ] S.H.I.E.L.D. , all the feminist @-@ overtones of Agent Carter and all the grittiness of Daredevil . " 
 Deadline.com 's Dominic Patten also had praise for the series , particularly Rosenberg 's influence on it , the coverage of topics such as " PTSD , abuse , assault , shame , and death " and the cast , highlighting Tennant 's Kilgrave as the actor 's best role as well as the MCU 's best villain . Mary McNamara from the Los Angeles Times felt Jessica Jones " rewrote the definition of superhuman " and was " a marvel " , lauding the series ' " breathtaking " examination of recovery from a sexually , emotionally and physically abusive relationship . Daniel Fienberg for The Hollywood Reporter was also positive , saying the series " looks and feels a bit like a cable anti @-@ hero series — but it 's really more of a post @-@ hero story , making it fascinating and unique in a marketplace that doesn 't lack for costumed do @-@ gooders of all types . " His one criticism was that " the show shares Jessica 's monomaniacal fixation on [ Kilgrave ] and the result is a sort of narrative claustrophobia ... Everything in these opening episodes ties back to Kilgrave and Kilgrave is such a twisted figure that it 's hard for any light to get in . " Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly was slightly more critical of the series , awarding it a " B " . Though Maerz felt Ritter was a good choice for Jessica and enjoyed the cinematography , she felt the series " could 've made for a gritty character drama if it weren 't for the noir clichés ( saxophone music , shadows through glass ) and a procedural structure that 's very CSI : Marvel . The show 's biggest weakness is the same as Jessica 's : It starts out with extraordinary potential , but somewhere along the way , it loses what make it special . " 
 Goldman , later reviewing the whole season , gave it a 9 @.@ 3 out of 10 . He commended all the actors , the relationship between Jessica and Trish , and the episode " Sin Bin " , though was critical of the character Robyn . Additionally , Goldman also felt the series spent " too many scenes devoted to Jeri ’ s marital strife " and that it hit its peak " a bit before the actual end of the season " similar to Daredevil , with most of the thrilling moments earlier in the season . 
 = = = Analysis = = = 
 Libby Hill of the Los Angeles Times commented on how Jessica Jones exposed modern day sexism and misogyny through Kilgrave 's use of the phrase " Smile " , calling the series " the most innocuous and incisive cultural critique " from Marvel to date . Hill likened an early scene that shows Kilgrave asking Jones to smile , and her obliging , to " similar well @-@ meaning scenarios [ that ] play out in the real world time and again each day " many in the form of gendered street harassment , that resonates with many women . Hill also added that " Kilgrave serves as an exaggerated representation of perceived consent , " due to the response he gives later in the series to Jessica about never knowing if someone is doing what they want or what he tells them to do . She concludes that " Jessica Jones is revolutionary because in acknowledging casual misogyny and exaggerating its most destructive tendencies , it exposes the pervasive toxicity therein . It does all of this without making a show of its politics , instead resting easy on the knowledge that all too many women will relate to the subtleties of its premise . " Amy C. Chambers , writing for The Science and Entertainment Laboratory , noted how the season moved away from sexism even more so than the comics , by changing Kilgrave 's abilities from <unk> based , with a particular effect on women , to viral , with equal effect no matter gender , indicating that " powerlessness is not gendered . " 
 Kwame <unk> at The Verge chose to examine rape and the nature of consent in the series . Comparing Jessica Jones to other television series that have depicted rape ( Game of Thrones , Orange Is the New Black , and Outlander ) , <unk> felt that " since rape is one of the show ’ s core themes , we never need to see it ... rape is a foundational part of the text , and its presence is constant . Even if it ’ s invisible , it ’ s always there . " He also felt the series took the time to examine how rape happens and what it means , especially in terms of power and consent , concluding , " Jessica Jones moves the conversation about rape forward by treating it as a complex subject worth investigating , rather than as spice for a story ... Maybe we don ’ t need to see it anymore to grasp how violent it is . Maybe our energies are better spent thinking deeply about why it happens at all . " The Guardian 's Lili <unk> also discussed the series depiction of rape and consent , noting the complications that come with Kilgrave telling his victims how to feel rather than just how to act , and saying , " however exceptional Kilgrave ’ s power seems , the moral quagmire it produces is all too common . It ’ s the condition of the rape victim who had an orgasm during her assault . It ’ s the condition of the soldier trained to kill when he suspects his targets are innocent . It ’ s the condition of the battered woman who goes back to her abuser and stays “ of her own free will ” . It ’ s the condition of ... any person , really , who agrees , whatever the context , to consent to forgo consent in the future . " <unk> also discussed the character of Simpson , comparing his power @-@ inducing red pill to the anti @-@ feminist " red <unk> " , and noting that his taking of the pills " renders him not just dangerously delusional , but so utterly at odds with nature and reality of any kind that he will forget to breathe unless he counteracts the pill ’ s effects .

 = Triptych , May – June 1973 = 
 Triptych , May – June 1973 is a triptych completed in 1973 by the Irish @-@ born artist Francis Bacon ( 1909 – 1992 ) . The oil @-@ on @-@ canvas was painted in memory of Bacon 's lover George Dyer , who committed suicide on the eve of the artist 's retrospective at Paris 's Grand Palais on 24 October 1971 . The triptych is a portrait of the moments before Dyer 's death from an overdose of pills in their hotel room . Bacon was haunted and preoccupied by Dyer 's loss for the remaining years of his life and painted many works based on both the actual suicide and the events of its aftermath . He admitted to friends that he never fully recovered , describing the 1973 triptych as an exorcism of his feelings of loss and guilt . 
 The work is stylistically more static and monumental than Bacon 's earlier triptychs of Greek figures and friends heads . It has been described as one of his " supreme achievements " and is generally viewed as his most intense and tragic canvas . Of the three Black Triptychs Bacon painted when confronting Dyer 's death , Triptych , May – June 1973 is generally regarded as the most accomplished . In 2006 , The Daily Telegraph 's art critic Sarah Crompton wrote that " emotion seeps into each panel of this giant canvas ... the sheer power and control of Bacon 's brushwork take the breath away " . Triptych , May – June 1973 was purchased at auction in 1989 by Esther <unk> for $ 6 @.@ 3 million , then a record for a Bacon painting . 
 = = Biographical context = = 
 Francis Bacon met George Dyer in a Soho pub . According to Bacon " George was down the far end of the bar and he came over and said ' You all seem to be having a good time , can I buy you a drink ? ' " ( Francis Bacon quoted in : Michael <unk> , Francis Bacon : Anatomy of an Enigma , London 2008 , p . 259 ) . From that point on , Dyer became devoted to Bacon . He admired his intellect and power and was in awe of his self @-@ confidence . He felt as if he had found a purpose , as the prominent artist 's companion . Dyer was then about thirty years old and had grown up in the East End of London in a family steeped in crime . He had spent his life drifting between theft , juvenile detention center and jail . Typical of Bacon 's taste in men , Dyer was fit , masculine , and not an intellectual . 
 Bacon 's relationships prior to Dyer had all been with older men who were as tumultuous in temperament as the artist himself , but each had been the dominating presence . Peter Lacy , his first lover , would often tear up the young artist 's paintings , beat him up in drunken rages , and leave him on the street half @-@ conscious . Bacon was attracted to Dyer 's vulnerability and trusting nature . Dyer was impressed by Bacon 's self @-@ confidence and his artistic success , and Bacon acted as a protector and father figure to the insecure younger man . Dyer was , like Bacon , a borderline alcoholic and similarly took obsessive care with his appearance . Pale @-@ faced and a chain @-@ smoker , Dyer typically confronted his daily hangovers by drinking again . His compact and athletic build belied a docile and inwardly tortured personality ; the art critic Michael Peppiatt described him as having the air of a man who could " land a decisive punch " . Their behaviours eventually overwhelmed their affair , and by 1970 , Bacon was merely providing Dyer with enough money to stay more or less permanently drunk . 
 As Bacon 's work moved from the extreme subject matter of his early paintings to portraits of friends in the mid @-@ 1960s , Dyer became a dominating presence in the artist 's work . Bacon 's treatment of his lover in these canvasses emphasises his subject 's physicality while remaining uncharacteristically tender . More than any other of the artist 's close friends portrayed during this period , Dyer came to feel inseparable from his effigies . The paintings gave him stature , a raison d 'etre , and offered meaning to what Bacon described as Dyer 's " brief interlude between life and death " . Many critics have cited Dyer 's portraits as favourites , including Michel Leiris and Lawrence <unk> . Yet as Dyer 's novelty diminished within Bacon 's circle of sophisticated intellectuals , the younger man became increasingly bitter and ill at ease . Although Dyer welcomed the attention the paintings brought him , he did not pretend to understand or even like them . " All that money an ' I <unk> they 're <unk> ' <unk> " , he observed with choked pride . He abandoned crime but soon descended into alcoholism . Bacon 's money allowed Dyer to attract hangers @-@ on who would accompany him on massive benders around London 's Soho . Withdrawn and reserved when sober , Dyer was <unk> when drunk , and would often attempt to " pull a Bacon " by buying large rounds and paying for expensive dinners for his wide circle . Dyer 's erratic behaviour inevitably wore thin — with his cronies , with Bacon , and with Bacon 's friends . Most of Bacon 's art world associates regarded Dyer as a nuisance — an intrusion into the world of high culture to which their Bacon belonged . Dyer reacted by becoming increasingly needy and dependent . By 1971 , he was drinking alone and was only in occasional contact with his former lover . 
 In October 1971 , Dyer accompanied Bacon to Paris for the opening of the artist 's retrospective at the Grand Palais . The show was the high point of Bacon 's career to date , and he was now being described as Britain 's " greatest living painter " . Dyer was now a desperate man , and although he was " allowed " to attend , he was well aware that he was " slipping " , in every sense , out of the picture . To draw Bacon 's attention he earlier planted cannabis in Bacon 's flat , then phoned the police , and he had attempted suicide on a number of occasions . On the eve of the Paris exhibition , Bacon and Dyer shared a hotel room , and Bacon spent the next day surrounded by people eager to meet him . In mid @-@ evening he was informed that Dyer had taken an overdose of barbiturates and was dead . Though devastated , Bacon continued with the retrospective and displayed powers of self @-@ control " to which few of us could aspire " , according to Russell . Bacon was deeply affected by the loss of Dyer , and he had recently lost four other friends and his nanny . From this point on , death haunted his life and work . Though he gave a stoic appearance at the time , he was inwardly broken . He did not express his feelings to critics , but later admitted to friends that " daemons , disaster and loss " now stalked him as if his own version of the Eumenides . Bacon spent the remainder of his stay in Paris attending to promotional activities and funeral arrangements . He returned to London later that week to comfort Dyer 's family . The funeral proved to be an emotional affair for all , and many of Dyer 's friends , including hardened East @-@ End criminals , broke down in tears . As the coffin was lowered into the grave one attendant screamed " you bloody fool ! " . Although Bacon remained stoic throughout , in the following months Dyer preoccupied his imagination as never before . To confront his loss , he painted a number of tributes on small canvasses and his three " Black Triptych " masterpieces . 
 = = Description = = 
 In each panel , Dyer is framed by a doorway , and set against a flat , anonymous foreground coloured with black and brown hues . In the left frame , he is seated on a toilet with his head crouched between his knees as if in pain . Although his arched back , thighs and legs are according to the Irish critic Colm Tóibín , " lovingly painted " , Dyer is by now clearly a broken man . This central panel shows Dyer sitting on the toilet bowl in a more contemplative pose , his head and upper body writhing beneath a hanging lightbulb which throws a large bat @-@ like shadow formed in the shape of a demon or <unk> . The art critic Sally Yard has noted that in the portrayal of Dyer 's flesh , " life seems to visibly drain ... into the substantial character of the shadow beneath him " . Dyer 's posture suggests he is seated on a lavatory bowl , though the object is not described . Schmied has proposed that in this frame the blackness of the background has enveloped the subject , and it " seems to be advancing forward over the threshold , threatening the viewer like a flood or a giant bat with flapping wings and extended claws . " 
 In the right panel , Dyer is shown with his eyes shut , vomiting into a hand basin . In the two outer frames his figure is shadowed by arrows , pictorial devices that Bacon often used to place a sense of energy into his paintings . In this work , the arrows point to a man about to die , and according to Tóibín they scream " Here ! " , " Him ! " . The arrow of the right panel , according to Tóibín , points to a " dead figure on the lavatory bowl , as though telling the Furies where to find him " . The triptych is centralised by the lightbulb , and by the fact that Dyer faces inwards in the two outer canvasses . The triptych 's composition and setting are poised to suggest instability , and the doors in each side panel are splayed outwards as if to look into the darkness of the foreground . 
 Triptych , May – June 1973 has been said to achieve its tension by locating <unk> described figures in an austere , cage @-@ like space . The foreground of each panel is bounded by a wall , which runs parallel to a framing door . Each door admits a stark black into its frame , while the walls establish a link between each of the three Black Triptychs . In 1975 , the curator Hugh M. Davis noted that while Bacon 's earlier triptychs had been set in public spaces " open to all kinds of visitor " , the Black Triptychs are set in a " deeply private realm , to which only the individual — accompanied , perhaps , by one or two of his closest friends — has access " . In 1999 , Yard wrote that the sense of foreboding and ill @-@ omen conjured by the Eumenides of Bacon 's Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion ( 1944 ) reappears in the triptych as a " <unk> void that snared the figure of George Dyer as he subsides into the supple curves of death " . John Russell observed that the painting 's background describes an area which is half studio , half condemned cell . A reviewer of the 1975 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition found a resemblance between the concept of the central panel and Albrecht Dürer 's engraving Melencolia I ( 1514 ) — in the figure 's pose , the bat form , and the panel 's radiance — suggesting that Bacon 's late triptychs evoke " memorable figural formulations " of classic Western culture . 
 Bacon later stated that " painting has nothing to do with colouring surfaces " , and in general he was not preoccupied with detailing his backgrounds : " When I feel that I have to some extent formed the image , I put the background in to see how it 's going to work and then I go with the image itself . " He told David Sylvester that he intended his " hard , flat , bright ground " to juxtapose with the complexity of the central images , and noted that " for this work , it can work more starkly if the background is very united and clear . I think that probably is why I have used a very clear background against which the image can articulate itself " . Bacon usually applied paint to the background quickly , and with " great energy " ; however , he thought of it as a secondary element . He used its colour to establish tone , but in his mind the real work began when he came to paint the figures . 
 Critics have argued whether the triptych should be read sequentially from left to right . Davies believes the work is a narrative , panoramic view of Dyer 's suicide , and that the triptych 's format implies a temporal continuity between each frame . Ernst van <unk> has argued that , notwithstanding spatial inconsistencies — the light bulb featured in the central panel is missing from the two outer canvasses , while the doorway view is reversed in the center panel — the triptych is a " plain representation of a story " . 
 = = The Black Triptychs = = 
 Bacon 's work from the 1970s has been described by the art critic Hugh Davies as the " frenzied momentum of a struggle against death " . Bacon admitted during a 1974 interview that he thought the most difficult aspect of aging was " losing your friends " . This was a bleak period in his life , and though he was to live for another seventeen years , he felt that his life was almost over , " and all the people I 've loved are dead " . His concern is reflected in the darkened flesh and background tones of his paintings from this period . His acute sense of mortality and awareness of the fragility of life were heightened by Dyer 's death in Paris . In the next three years he painted many images of his former lover , including the series of three " Black Triptychs " which have come to be seen as among his best work . A number of characteristics bind the triptychs together : the form of a <unk> rendered doorway features centrally in all , and each is framed by flat and shallow walls . In each three Dyer is stalked by a broad shadow ; which takes the form of pools of blood or flesh in the outer panels and the wings of the angel of death in the left hand and central images . In its display caption for Triptych – August 1972 the Tate gallery wrote , " What death has not already consumed seeps <unk> out of the figures as their shadows . " 
 Each of the three Black Triptychs displays sequential views of a single figure , and each seems to be intended to be viewed as if stills from a film . The figures rendered are not drawn from any of Bacon 's usual intellectual sources ; they do not depict Golgotha , <unk> , or Leopold Bloom . In these pictures Bacon strips Dyer from the context of both Dyer 's own life and the artist 's life , and presents him as a nameless , slumped , gathering of flesh , awaiting the onset of death . Describing the Black Triptychs in 1993 , the art critic Juan Vicente <unk> wrote that " the horror , the abjection that oozed from the crucifixes has been transformed in his last paintings into quiet solitude . The masculine bodies entwined in a carnal embrace have given way to the solitary figure leaning over the washbasin , standing firm on the smooth ground , neutral , bald @-@ headed , his convex back deformed , his testicles contracted in a fold . " 
 When asked by the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg in 1984 if the portraits painted in the wake of Dyer 's death were depictions of his emotional reaction to the event , Bacon replied that he did not consider himself to be an " expressionist painter " . He explained that he was " not trying to express anything , I wasn 't trying to express the sorrow about somebody committing suicide ... but perhaps it comes through without knowing it " . When Bragg inquired if he often thought about death , the artist replied that he was always aware of it , and that although " it 's just around the corner for [ me ] , I don 't think about it , because there 's nothing to think about . When it comes , it 's there . You 've had it . " Reflecting on the loss of Dyer , Bacon observed that as part of aging , " life becomes more of a desert around you " . He told Bragg that he believed in " nothing . We are born and we die and that 's it . There is nothing else . " Bragg asked Bacon what he did about that reality , and after the artist told him he did nothing about it , Bragg pleaded , " No Francis , you try and paint it . " 
 Throughout his career , Bacon consciously and carefully avoided explaining the meaning behind his paintings , and pointedly observed that they were not intended as narratives , nor open to interpretation . When Bragg challenged him with the observation that Triptych , May – June 1973 was the nearest the artist had come to telling a story , Bacon admitted that " it is in fact the nearest I 've ever done to a story , because you know that is the triptych of how [ Dyer ] was found " . He went on to say that the work reflected not just his reaction to Dyer 's death , but his general feelings about the fact that his friends were then dying around him " like flies " . A borderline alcoholic himself , Bacon continued to explain that his dead friends were " generally heavy drinkers " , and that their deaths led directly to his composition of a series of meditative self @-@ portraits which emphasised his own aging and awareness of the passage of time .

 Julius Franks , Jr . ( September 5 , 1922 – November 26 , 2008 ) was a civil rights leader and an All @-@ American guard who played football at the University of Michigan from 1941 to 1942 . Franks wore # 62 as a varsity letterman in 1941 and # 63 in 1942 . Franks was the first ( or second depending on the source ) African @-@ American University of Michigan player to become an All @-@ American in football . Illness cut short his collegiate athletic career . 
 After Michigan , Franks pursued a career in dentistry . He also became an active community leader who contributed his time to public service and who helped to integrate Grand Rapids , Michigan by financing home construction in a majority Caucasian neighborhood .

 Franks , who was born in Macon , Georgia and raised in Hamtramck , Michigan , was named to the Detroit , Michigan , all @-@ city team after the 1939 high school football season . He is the son of Julius Franks , Sr. and Nellie Mae Solomon and father of Daryl , Cheryl , Bobby , Beverly A Grant , Fredrick . After graduating from high school , he attended the University of Michigan , where he became the third African @-@ American to play for the Michigan Wolverines football team . In 1942 , he became the first African @-@ American at Michigan to earn All @-@ American honors . He is described as the second to be All @-@ American by some accounts . Head coach Fritz Crisler said Franks was one of the hardest @-@ working players he ever coached . The 1942 Wolverines ' offensive line , which included Franks , Al Wistert , Robert Kolesar , Merv <unk> , and Elmer Madar , was known as the " Seven Oak Posts " . Franks credited the group 's success to <unk> as rookies against the 1940 offense that included Tom Harmon , Forest Evashevski , and Bob Westfall . Franks was played all 60 minute in his games as a junior in 1942 and was named a first @-@ team All American by the International News Service ( Hearst newspapers ) , Central Press , and Collier 's Weekly , and a second @-@ team All @-@ American by the Associated Press and New York Sun . 
 In 1943 , Franks and teammate Tom Kuzma came down with tuberculosis and were hospitalized at University Hospital for 25 months as they recuperated . Franks recalled that head coach Fritz Crisler was a regular visitor to his hospital room , and team star Tom Harmon also stopped to visit while on leave from military service . As a result of the hospitalization , Franks missed his senior year as a football player . He obtained his bachelor of science degree in 1947 . 
 In 1982 , Franks was named to the University of Michigan Hall of Honor in the fifth class of inductees that was inducted in 1983 . He was the twelfth Michigan football player to earn this honor .

In 1992 , Franks contracted Guillain @-@ Barré syndrome , which forced him into retirement . 
 In the 1960s , Franks helped to integrate Grand Rapids . In the early 1960s , African Americans were not welcome in Grand Rapids ' " white " middle @-@ class neighborhoods , and real estate agents would not show them houses . In 1962 , Franks ' friend , J.E. Adams , found vacant land designated as a potential park site . Adams , Franks , and friends Joseph Lee and Samuel Triplett created a plan to purchase the 20 acres ( 80 @,@ 937 m2 ) site and build a middle @-@ class neighborhood for African @-@ Americans . The announcement " caused an uproar that resulted in protests , lawsuits and threats . " When banks refused to finance the project , the four men purchased the land on their own for $ 60 @,@ 000 and started building . The first of 51 houses was completed in 1965 . Today , the neighborhood , known as Auburn Hills ( not to be confused with Auburn Hills , Michigan ) , has a population of 542 and the lowest crime rate in Grand Rapids . In 2006 , the Michigan Alumni Club gave Franks the " Paul G. Goebel , Sr. Distinguished Alumni in Athletics Award " . In later years , Franks was also a leader with the Urban League , United Way and other groups .

 The second day of the tournament began with the Maryland Terrapins facing the seventh @-@ seeded Notre Dame Fighting Irish at home in South Bend , Indiana . The Fighting Irish entered the game in possession of a perfect 15 – 0 record , but still considered an unknown variable due to their schedule . The magazine Inside Lacrosse called the Terrapins a talented team that had underachieved during the regular season . The first @-@ ranked Notre Dame defense frustrated Maryland , but the Terps still managed to gain a 6 – 1 lead in the third quarter . Maryland 's defense effectively shut @-@ down Notre Dame and the leading Irish scorer Ryan Hoff was unable to make a single shot on goal .

John decides to go to Will 's apartment and lets himself in with the key and finds the two girls asleep . They awake and take him for a burglar and threaten to kill him and John pleads for mercy instead of addressing the misunderstanding . John is later revealed to be her employer after he is caught opening a safe in the office the next morning . The film was released on August 26 , 1910 and was met with positive reviews by the trade publications . The film is presumed lost .

 Though the film is presumed lost , a synopsis survives in The Bioscope from November 10 , 1910 . It states : " Will and John are prosperous young businessmen and close friends . Will has an apartment in the city , while John lives in the suburbs . When Will goes to the country on his vacation he leaves the latchkey of his apartment with his chum , telling him to make himself at home . The landlady in the house in which Will lives is seized with a bright idea that she can sublet his apartment during his absence . May and Belle , two pretty girls who are in business , decide to try their hand at housekeeping . They rent Will 's apartment and settle down in their new quarters . John decides to take advantage of his friend 's invitation and make use of his rooms . He lets himself in with the latchkey , and is amazed to find the two girls sound asleep . Believing him to be a burglar the girls threaten him with annihilation . John thinks the joke too good to spoil , so does not try to square himself , but pleads for mercy . May secures his promise that he will never ' burgle ' again , and allows him to escape . Unknown to John , May has been engaged by his partner as a typist , and when she enters the office the following morning and finds John opening the safe , she decides that once again her burglar has been caught red @-@ handed . She calls for help , and is greatly chagrined when her supposed burglar is introduced as her employer . Amid explanations , the ' burglar ' and the lady shake hands and become good friends . " 
 In both The Moving Picture World and The Moving Picture News the character of Will was named Bill , but it is not clear if this was intentional , a renaming or error .

 The writer of the scenario is unknown , but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan . He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions . The film director is unknown , but it may have been Barry O 'Neil . Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production , but at least two possible candidates exist . Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company , but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer . The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions . There are no known credits for the cast , but Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane are two possible actors that were prominent players in 1910 . Credits may have included Anna Rosemond , one of two leading ladies of the Thanhouser company in this era . Frank H. Crane was a leading male actor of the company and also involved since the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company . Bowers states that most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions . A surviving film still leaves open the possibility of identifying three actors .

 The one reel comedy , approximately 1 @,@ 000 feet long , was released on August 26 , 1910 . The film likely saw a wide national release , advertisements in theaters are known in Indiana , North Carolina , and Pennsylvania . The New York Dramatic Mirror gave the most detailed review of the trade publications by summing up the scenario and approving of the plot and the good acting in the production . The reviewer concluded , " Not only are the leading roles well portrayed , but the minor parts are quite well done in the picture - the dismissed stenographer and the old landlady actually look and act their parts . There is a pleasing , symmetrical competence in the whole cast . " The production was reviewed positively by The Moving Picture World and concludes with the statement , " The story ends there without a suspicion of anybody falling in love with anybody else , a restraint which will be duly appreciated . " Bower 's notes that many Thanhouser plots conclude with the romance and the reviewer noted this change was a welcome one for this production . The previous film A Dainty Politician concluded with romance and the next release An Assisted Elopement took the romance element further with two sets of parents trying to get their children to marry each other .

 There are a number of different modes : Grand Prix ( GP ) , Motocross , and Traffic . GP takes place at a number of different locations across the world on paved tracks in places such as San Francisco and Russia . The paved tracks require the player to learn how to effectively use their brakes around corners . The GP courses contain small differences between them , giving more variety to the courses in the game . Motocross requires the player to drive on off @-@ road terrain and to master the act of " <unk> " on corners . The courses found in Motocross races are less hospitable and often take place in arid and <unk> locales and with obstacles . Traffic mixes both GP and Motocross , having mixed pavement courses and traffic on roads that serve as obstacles . 
 There are three different methods of gameplay : Championship , Progression , and Single Race . The single race mode must be earned through playing the progression mode . Progression is the game 's " main mode " and places the player in a number of different tournaments and races in all three racing styles .

 = = Early life = = 
 Turner was born Anna Mae Bullock on November 26 , 1939 , in Nutbush , an unincorporated area in Haywood County , Tennessee . Her parents were Zelma Priscilla ( née Currie ) and Floyd Richard Bullock . Anna Mae was born at Poindexter Farm on Highway 180 , where her father worked as an overseer of the sharecroppers . She is of African @-@ American descent , with approximately 33 % European and 1 % Native American ancestry . ( The latter was revealed when she appeared on the PBS documentary African American Lives 2 , and the host Henry Louis Gates shared the results of Turner 's ancestral tests . ) 
 Anna Mae had an older sister , Ruby <unk> . As young children , Anna Mae and <unk> were separated when their parents relocated to Knoxville , Tennessee , to work at a defense facility during World War II . Anna went to stay with her strict , religious paternal grandparents , Alex and <unk> Bullock , who were deacon and deaconess at the Woodlawn Missionary Baptist Church , which was located on Woodlawn Road off Highway 19 . After the war , the sisters reunited with their parents and moved with them to Knoxville . Two years later , the family returned to Nutbush to live in the Flagg Grove community , where Anna attended Flagg Grove Elementary School from first through eighth grade . In 1889 , her great @-@ great uncle had sold the land on which the school was built to the school trustees . 
 As a youngster , Anna Mae sang in the church choir at Nutbush 's Spring Hill Baptist Church . When she was 11 , her mother ran off without warning , seeking freedom from her abusive relationship with Floyd Bullock . Zelma relocated to St. Louis to live with Anna Mae 's great @-@ aunt . As a preteen , Anna Mae worked as a domestic worker for the Henderson family . When Anna Mae was 13 , her father married another woman and moved to Detroit . Anna Mae and her sister were sent to live with their grandmother <unk> in Brownsville , Tennessee . Anna Mae later stated in her memoir I , Tina that she felt her mother had not loved her , and that she " wasn 't wanted " , stating further that her mother had planned to leave her father when pregnant with Anna Mae . " She was a very young woman who didn 't want another kid " , Anna Mae wrote . Her relationship with her mother remained estranged until Bullock 's death in 1999 . 
 A self @-@ professed tomboy , Anna Mae joined both the cheerleading squad and the female basketball team at Carver High School in Brownsville , and " socialized every chance she got . " Her first boyfriend , while she was living in Brownsville , was Harry Taylor , who originally attended a rival school to hers . Taylor relocated to Anna 's school to be near her . The relationship ended after Anna Mae learned Harry had married another woman . 
 When Anna Mae was 16 , her grandmother died suddenly . After the funeral , Anna Mae went to live with her mother in St. Louis , where she was reunited with her sister . There , Anna Mae graduated from Sumner High School in 1958 . After her graduation , she worked as a nurse 's aide at Barnes @-@ Jewish Hospital and dreamed of becoming a nurse .

 Anna and her sister began to frequent nightclubs in the St. Louis and East St. Louis areas around this time . At Club Manhattan , a nightclub in the East St. Louis area , she first saw Ike Turner and his band , the Kings of Rhythm , perform . Anna was impressed by the band 's music and of Ike 's talent , claiming the bandleader 's music put her " into a trance . " Anna felt the urge to sing on stage with Ike 's band despite the fact that few women had ever sung with him . One night , 18 @-@ year @-@ old Anna was given a microphone by Kings of Rhythm drummer Gene Washington during an intermission . Upon hearing her sing , Ike asked her if she knew more songs , she was allowed to sing that night , becoming a guest vocalist from then on . Through this period , Ike taught her the points of voice control and performance . Her first studio recording was in 1958 , singing background , under the name " Little Ann " , on the Ike Turner song , " Box Top " , alongside singer Carlson Oliver . 
 In 1960 , Ike wrote an R & B song , " A Fool in Love " , originally for Kings of Rhythm vocalist Art Lassiter . Lassiter failed to show up to the recording studio and Anna eventually was allowed to sing the song after much pleading to Ike . Ike agreed to use her voice as a " dummy vocal " , with the intention of erasing her vocals and adding Lassiter 's at a later date . Although some felt that the demo with Anna 's voice was " high pitched " and " screechy " , the song received decent airtime in St. Louis . Local St. Louis deejay Dave Dixon convinced Ike to send the tape to Juggy Murray , president of R & B label , Sue Records . Upon hearing the song , Murray was impressed with Anna 's vocals , later stating that her vocals " sounded like screaming dirt ... it was a funky sound . " Murray bought the track and paid Ike a $ 25 @,@ 000 advance for recording and publishing rights . Murray also convinced Turner to make Anna " the star of the show . " It was at this point that Ike Turner renamed Anna Mae Bullock " Tina " , because the name rhymed with the television character Sheena . It has also been said that the renaming of Anna Mae Bullock was intended to keep her from running off and making a name for herself . Ike Turner felt that , if Anna Mae Bullock left him , he could replace her with another singer and have her perform as Tina .

 " A Fool in Love " was released in July 1960 and became an immediate hit , peaking at number 2 on the Hot R & B Sides chart and number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100 that October . Kurt Loder described the track as " the blackest record to ever creep into the white pop charts since Ray Charles ' gospel @-@ styled ' What 'd I Say ' that previous summer . " A second pop hit , " It 's Gonna Work Out Fine " ( 1961 ) , reached the top 20 and earned the duo a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock and Roll Performance . Notable singles released during the duo 's Sue Records period included the R & B hits , " I <unk> You " , " Poor Fool " and " Tra @-@ La @-@ La @-@ La . " In 1964 , Ike & Tina left Sue and signed with Kent Records , releasing the modest single , " I Can 't Believe What You Say . " The following year , they signed with Loma Records , a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Records and run by Bob Krasnow , who had become their manager shortly after they left Sue Records . Between 1964 and 1969 , Ike & Tina signed with more than ten labels . 
 The duo maintained a popularity through a rigorous touring schedule across the United States , gigging 90 days straight in dates around the country . During the days of the chitlin ' circuit , the Ike and Tina Turner Revue built a reputation that a writer for the History of Rock site cited as " one of the most hottest , most durable and potentially most explosive of all R & B ensembles " with its show rivaling that of the James Brown Show in terms of musical spectacle . The shows , organized by Ike Turner , provided them financial success . Due to their successful performances , the couple were able to perform in front of diverse crowds in the American South due to the money they made from performing in Southern clubs . Between 1963 and 1966 , the band toured constantly without the presence of a hit single . Tina 's own profile was raised after several solo appearances on shows such as American Bandstand and Shindig ! , while the entire Revue appeared on shows such as Hollywood A Go @-@ Go , The Andy Williams Show and , in late 1965 , in the concert film The Big T.N.T. Show .

 In 1965 , Phil Spector caught an Ike & Tina performance in Los Angeles and sought to work with Tina . Working out a deal , Spector gave Ike a $ 20 @,@ 000 advance to keep out of the studio to which Ike agreed . With Spector , Tina produced the song " River Deep - Mountain High " , which was released in 1966 on Spector 's Philles label . Spector considered that record , with Tina 's maximum energy over a symphonic sound , to be his best work . It was successful overseas , particularly in the United Kingdom , where it eventually reached number 3 on the singles chart , but it failed to go any higher than # 88 in the United States . Crushed , Spector never signed another act to Philles and seldom produced again . But the impact of the record gave Ike and Tina an opening spot for The Rolling Stones ' UK tour later that fall , which the Revue later extended by performing all over Europe and Australia . Signing with Blue Thumb Records in 1968 , the Revue issued the blues @-@ heavy albums , Outta Season and The Hunter . Outta Season produced the Revue 's charted cover of Otis Redding 's " I 've Been Loving You Too Long " , while the latter earned Tina a Grammy nomination for Best Female R & B Vocal Performance for her rendition of the title track , originally recorded by Albert King . The success of the albums led to the Revue headlining at Las Vegas where their shows were attended by a variety of celebrities including David Bowie , Sly Stone , Janis Joplin , Cher , James Brown , Ray Charles , Elton John and Elvis Presley . 
 In 1969 , the Revue 's profile in their home country was raised after opening for the Rolling Stones on their US tour . In 1970 , they performed on The Ed Sullivan Show . The tour 's success resulted in the Revue signing with Liberty Records , where they released two albums , Come Together and Workin ' Together , released in 1970 and 1971 respectively . Come Together produced the duo 's first top 40 single with their cover of Sly and the Family Stone 's " I Want to Take You Higher . " Come Together marked a turning point in their careers in which they switched from their usual R & B repertoire to incorporate more rock tunes . In early 1971 , their cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival 's " Proud Mary " became their biggest hit , reaching number 4 on the Hot 100 and selling over a million copies , winning them a Grammy for Best R & B Performance by a Duo or Group . Later in 1971 , their live album , What You Hear Is What You Get , taken from a performance at Carnegie Hall , was their first to be certified gold . In 1972 , Ike Turner created the studio , Bolic Sounds , near their home in Inglewood . After Liberty was bought by United Artists Records , the duo was assigned to that label , releasing ten albums in a three @-@ year period . The duo 's final major hit single , " Nutbush City Limits " , was released in 1973 , reaching number 22 on the Hot 100 , and peaking at number 4 in the UK . In 1974 , Tina released her first solo album , Tina Turns the Country On ! , winning a Grammy nomination . 
 That year , Tina traveled to London to participate in the filming of the rock musical , Tommy , in which she played The Acid Queen , A drug addicted prostitute who tries to heal Tommy with illegal drugs and sang the song of the same name . Turner 's performance was critically acclaimed . Shortly after filming wrapped , Turner appeared with Ann @-@ Margret on her TV special in London . Returning to the United States , Turner continued her career with the Revue . Following the release of Tommy , another Turner solo album , Acid Queen , was released in 1975 .

 By the mid @-@ 1970s , Ike Turner 's excessive cocaine habit had gotten out of hand . During this period , Tina adopted the Nichiren Buddhism faith and chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo to help her deal through a stressful marriage and career . Due to Ike Turner 's drug abuse , some shows were either canceled or postponed . In July 1976 , Ike Turner had plans to leave United Artists Records for a five @-@ year , $ 150 @,@ 000 deal with Cream Records . The deal was to be signed on July 6 . On July 2 , 1976 , Ike and Tina were en route from Los Angeles to Dallas where the Revue had a gig at the Dallas Statler Hilton . The couple engaged in a bloody fight during their ride to the hotel . Shortly after arriving to the hotel , Tina fled from the hotel and later hid at a friend 's house . On July 27 , Tina sued for divorce in the grounds of irreconcilable differences . 
 Tina later credited the Nichiren Buddhist faith and chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo with giving her the courage to strike out on her own . However , by walking out on Ike in the middle of a tour , she learned she was legally responsible to tour promoters for the canceled shows . After a year in court , their divorce was made final on March 29 , 1978 . In the divorce , she completely parted ways with him , retaining only her stage name and assuming responsibility for the debts incurred by the canceled tour as well as a significant Internal Revenue Service lien .

 In 1977 , with finances given to her by United Artists executive Richard Stewart , Tina returned onstage , giving a round of shows in Las Vegas in a cabaret setting , influenced by the cabaret shows she witnessed while a member of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue . She took her cabaret act to smaller venues in the United States . Turner earned further income by appearing on shows such as The Hollywood Squares , Donny and Marie , The Sonny & Cher Show and The Brady Bunch Hour . Later in 1977 , Turner headlined her first solo concert tour , throughout Australia . In 1978 , United Artists released Turner 's third solo album , Rough , with distribution both in North America and Europe with EMI . That album , along with its followup , Love Explosion , which included a brief diversion to disco rhythms , failed to chart . 
 The albums completed her United Artists / EMI contracts and Turner left the labels . Continuing her performing career with her second headlining tour , Wild Lady of Rock ' n ' Roll , she continued to be a successful live act even without the premise of a hit record . Following an appearance on Olivia Newton @-@ John 's US TV special , Hollywood Nights , in 1979 , Turner sought contract with Newton @-@ John 's manager Roger Davies . Davies agreed to work with Turner as her manager after seeing her perform at the Venetian Ballroom in the Fairmont San Francisco hotel in February 1980 . 
 Davies advised Turner to drop her band and remodel her show into a grittier rock 'n'roll showcase . In 1981 , Davies booked Tina at The Ritz in New York City . Following the performance , Rod Stewart hired Turner to perform a duet version of his hit , " Hot Legs " , on Saturday Night Live , and later hired Turner to open for him on his U.S. tour . One show with Rod Stewart and Kim Carnes , on 19 December 1981 , at the L. A. Forum , Inglewood , was filmed . Afterwards , Turner opened three shows for The Rolling Stones . A recorded cover of The Temptations ' " Ball of Confusion " for the UK production team <unk> featuring Robert Cray , became a hit in European dance clubs in 1982 . Following performances with Chuck Berry and several short tours in the U.S. and Europe , Turner again performed at the Ritz in December of the year , which resulted in a singles deal with Capitol Records under the insistence of David Bowie .

 In November 1983 , Tina released her cover of Al Green 's " Let 's Stay Together " , with Capitol . The record became a hit , reaching several European charts , including a top 10 placement in the United Kingdom . The song peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Hot 100 , becoming Turner 's first solo entry into the U.S. charts . It also peaked at the top 10 of the Hot Dance Club Songs and Hot Black Singles charts . The success of the song forced Capitol to rethink its contract with Turner , offering the singer a three album deal , demanding an album on short notice , which had Turner staging what Ebony magazine later called an " amazing comeback . " Recorded in two months in London , the album , Private Dancer , was released in June 1984 . That same month , Capitol issued the album 's second single , " What 's Love Got to Do with It . " It reached the top 10 within a month and in September had reached number 1 on the Hot 100 in the U.S. Featuring hit singles such as " Better Be Good to Me " and " Private Dancer " , the album peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200 , selling five million copies alone in the states and selling over twenty million copies worldwide , making it her most successful album . Turner 's comeback culminated in early 1985 when she won four Grammy Awards , including Record of the Year for " What 's Love Got to Do with It . " In February of that year , she embarked on her second world tour supporting the Private Dancer album , where she toured to huge crowds . One show , filmed at Birmingham , England 's NEC Arena , was later released on home video . During this time , she also contributed on vocals to the USA for Africa benefit song " We Are the World . " 
 Turner 's success continued when she travelled to Australia to star opposite Mel Gibson in the 1985 post @-@ apocalyptic film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome . The movie provided her with her first acting role in ten years — she portrayed the glamorous Aunty Entity , the ruler of <unk> . Upon release , critical response to her performance was generally positive , and the film became a global success , making more than $ 36 million in the United States alone . Turner later received the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress for her role in the film . She also recorded two songs for the film , " We Don 't Need Another Hero ( Thunderdome ) " and " One of the Living " ; both became hits , with the latter winning Turner a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance . In July , Turner performed at Live Aid alongside Mick Jagger . Encouraged by a performance together during Tina 's filmed solo concert in England , singer Bryan Adams released their duet single together , " It 's Only Love " , later resulting in a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal .

 Turner followed up Private Dancer with Break Every Rule in 1986 .

Turner contributed to the soundtrack for What 's Love Got to Do with It , re @-@ recording songs from her Revue days and recording several newer songs , including what turned out to be her last Top 10 U.S. hit , " I Don 't Wanna Fight . " Other than helping Bassett with her wardrobe and teaching her dance steps as well as providing songs for the soundtrack , and appearing as herself at the end of the film , she refused to be involved fully in the film , telling an interviewer , " Why would I want to see Ike Turner beat me up again ? I haven 't dwelled on it ; it 's all in the past where it belongs . " Following the film 's and soundtrack 's release , Turner embarked on her first US tour in seven years .

 Turner returned in 1995 with the U2 composition , " GoldenEye " for the James Bond film of the same name . Its huge success in Europe and modest success in her native United States led Turner to record a new album , releasing the Wildest Dreams album in 1996 . Though the album itself was not as hugely successful in the United States , thanks to a world tour and a much played Hanes hosiery commercial , the album went gold in the United States . The album reached platinum success in Europe where Turner had hits with " Whatever You Want " , " Missing You " , which briefly charted in the U.S. , " Something Beautiful Remains " , and the sensual Barry White duet " In Your Wildest Dreams .

 Tina and Ike 's early relationship was friendly and " like siblings . " In late 1958 , Tina moved into Ike 's home in East St. Louis . During that period , Ike began musically training Tina . At the beginning , the two had no mutual attraction ; Tina felt Ike was not the " ideal @-@ looking man " , while Ike viewed her as a sister and favored " curvaceous women . " Ike was still married to his common @-@ law wife , Lorraine Taylor , during this period . 
 Ike and Tina began a sexual relationship in 1959 , much to Tina 's chagrin . Ike also felt guilt over the relationship , stating later that having sex with Tina felt as if he were having sex with a sibling . In her book , Tina stated the couple married in Tijuana , in 1962 . She recalled the first time Ike physically abused her began after she told him she was considering leaving Ike 's group due to financial disputes and their own confusing relationship . Tina said Ike grabbed a shoe stretcher and hit her in the head with it . Afterwards , Tina said , Ike asked her to have sex with him . Tina wrote in her memoirs , I , Tina , that the incident was the first time Ike had " instilled fear " in her . 
 Ike 's accounts of his relationship with Tina , including the incidents of abuse , differed . In a 1985 interview with Spin magazine , Ike admitted , " Yeah I hit her , but I didn 't hit her more than the average guy beats his wife .... If she says I abused her , maybe I did . " He worded this slightly differently in his memoirs , Taking Back My Name ( 1999 ) , writing : " Sure , I 've slapped Tina .... There have been times when I punched her to the ground without thinking . But I have never beat her . " 
 Ike also claimed on more than one occasion that he and Tina weren 't even legally married . In the 1985 Spin article , Ike said , " As God is my judge , of all my wives , Tina is the only one I was never legally married to . " He explained in later years that Tina took his name in order to discourage a former lover from returning to her . 
 Ike said he had married at least 14 times , and five times before he allegedly married Tina . Tina admits she " never felt like [ she ] was married " to Ike . A musician associate of Ike 's later recounted that , except for a few arguments , he never witnessed Ike being abusive to Tina or anyone else in his close circle . 
 Before a show in Los Angeles , in 1968 , Tina tried to commit suicide by swallowing 50 <unk> , after a fight with Ike . After their July 1976 fight in Dallas , Tina filed for divorce . In the final divorce decree , Tina took responsibility for missed concert dates as well as an IRS lien , and requested to be allowed to retain use of her stage name as a means to find work as a performer . Following the divorce , Turner claimed she had corrective surgery on her nasal septum , which she says was injured by Ike 's frequent hitting .

 Other suit variations include the partial suit , which only has a mask , gloves , a tail , and possibly feet , with regular clothing covering the rest of the body .

 = Sembawang Hot Spring = 
 The Sembawang Hot Spring ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> ) , located at <unk> Avenue between Woodlands Avenue 12 and Sembawang Road , is the only natural hot spring on the main island of Singapore . It lies in a wooded area about 100 metres ( 330 ft ) off the main road . The spring is believed by locals to have healing properties , and its water has been bottled commercially by Fraser and Neave , under the brand name of Seletaris . Since its discovery in 1909 , the spring , now on land belonging to a military air base , has gone through several changes of ownership and abortive redevelopment plans . The hot spring retains a rural rustic feel for nature visitors to unwind . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1909 , a Chinese merchant named Seah Eng Keong , the son of Chinese pioneer Seah Liang Seah , discovered hot springs in his pineapple estate in Sembawang . The three springs were channelled into one , so that the water would be conveniently concentrated in one area . A well was built along the spring , which became popular with the villagers , who frequently sought the waters for their supposed healing powers . The spring 's fame spread , resulting in the village becoming known as Kampong Ayer <unk> , which means " Village of Hot Water " in Malay . 
 Soft drinks firm Fraser & Neave ( F & N ) acquired the site in 1922 , and set up a bottling plant at nearby Semangat Ayer to tap the mineral water , which they labelled Seletaris . During the Second World War , the spring 's flow was temporarily interrupted when a bomb fell near the well during a Japanese air raid over Singapore in 1942 . After the fall of Singapore , the Japanese military seized the place and converted it into recreational thermal baths ( onsen ) . 
 The hot spring was frequented by gamblers in 1960 , who took " good luck " baths before the start of horse races . That same year , the villagers urged the authorities to develop the area into a spa @-@ like onsen tourist resort . However , F & N shelved the suggestion after geologists could not to trace the source of the spring water . In 1967 , the proposal of the spa surfaced again , when F & N proposed plans for the development of a bathhouse , restaurants , a miniature golf course and even a nature reserve . However , the plans did not materialize , so the hot spring remained untouched and forgotten . 
 = = = Redevelopment = = = 
 In 1998 , the Ministry of Defence ( Mindef ) acquired the land containing the spring for the expansion of the nearby Sembawang Air Base , leaving F & N with less than 4 hectares ( 10 acres ) of land . Its water @-@ bottling plant survived until the early 1990s however . In January 2002 , locals ' interest to the hot spring , which had caught the attention of Singaporeans after the surrounding land had been cleared to begin the RSAF air base extension . Sembawang community leaders gathered signatures to petition Mindef , which was going to fence off the area , to preserve and develop the hot spring for the general public . Mindef gave the green light to the appeals and opened a small side gate pavement for the public to access the spring . 
 During that same year , a series of scalding cases , including an incident in which a senior citizen diabetic lost six toes to gangrene after soaking in the hot spring , prompted the Singapore General Hospital to warn that people with nerve disorders or diseases affecting blood circulation should be cautious to hot mineral springs . As a result of some negative rumors and hearsay , and the RSAF redevelopment , public interest began to wane and the number of visitors dwindled . 
 = = = Present day = = = 
 During its peak , up to 300 people visited the hot spring daily . On 1 March 2002 , it was closed for two months while upgrading and improvement works were carried out to the area around the spring , which had become sodden and muddy . Litter had also become a problem because of the increased numbers of visitors . The former dirt track leading to the spring was paved with cement , and lined with bougainvillea bushes and high fences to ensure the security of the air base . Drainage pipes were also installed . Mindef , which owns the land , allows public access between 7 am and 7 pm daily , free @-@ of @-@ charge . When the spring reopened on 1 May 2002 , more than 100 people visited the site despite the afternoon drizzle . At the same time , some new free @-@ hold condominiums were built in the surrounding area ; one of the developments , built by the property arm of F & N in 2001 , is called Seletaris after the company 's former mineral water . 
 In July 2005 , a Business Times reader proposed that the authorities should explore the possibility of tapping the geothermal heat that lies many miles under Sembawang — similar to the project in South Australia 's Cooper Basin — in order to aid Singapore 's reliance on oil and gas . The proposal was not acted upon . 
 As of 2014 , the well can still be seen locked inside a red @-@ brick enclosure with a steel gate , and its geothermal heat can be felt outside the building . Some plastic chairs , pails and mini @-@ tubs kindly donated by visitors are stored at the perimeter of the compound , which has a makeshift shed in one corner . A caretaker , paid by Mindef , takes care of the place to ensure its overall cleanliness , but there is no toilet on location . The hot spring is less frequented nowadays but remains rustic for rural and suburban families to discover and explore . 
 The potential redevelopment of Sembawang Hot Spring into a national park is currently being explored . The Ministry of Defence ( MINDEF ) said on 23 April 2016 that it is prepared to return the land occupied by the hot spring to the Singapore Land Authority . MINDEF hopes a public agency such as the National Parks Board ( NParks ) can take over to improve and maintain the place , while constructing amenities such as toilets and adding more greenery . The ministry added that putting the place under a public agency means the land need not be tendered out to the highest bidder and become commercialised . 
 Earlier on 16 April 2016 , a NParks senior director of Parks Development confirmed the statutory board was working with the Urban Redevelopment Authority , Singapore Land Authority and MINDEF on “ the feasibility of using the area as a park 
 = = Water properties = = 
 According to local geologists , the exact source of the spring remains unknown , but it is believed that its origin may be southwest of its actual location , possibly at Bukit Timah . Hot springs are formed when underground water comes into contact with hot rock masses . The resulting high pressure causes the water to seep upwards through cracks , forcing itself out of the ground as a spring . 
 A series of tests conducted by the PSB Corporation and SGS Testing & Control Services found the spring water contains 420 mg of chloride per litre , an amount which is substantially higher than the 35 to 100 mg in the water from Choa Chu Kang and Bedok waterworks . It was also found that the sulphide content is three times more than tap water and the spring water is also slightly alkaline due to the presence of minerals . Natural spring waters may have health benefits , similar to the hot springs of other countries near tectonic plates with volcanoes , in a search for cures for some skin conditions , as well as debilitating ailments like rheumatism and arthritis . Although local <unk> conceded that hydrotherapy is an accepted treatment that can be helpful for mild forms of rheumatism or muscle strain , they , along with dermatologists , remain skeptical of claims about the alternative healing of the natural spring water . 
 Hot hard water bubbles continuously in the well , releasing a slightly unpleasant sulphur mud @-@ like odour together with steam . The temperature of the spring water is measured by precision instrument to be constant 70 ° C ( 160 ° F ) . In an investigation carried out by the Nanyang Technological University in 1994 , the hot spring was found to have an estimated yield of approximately 150 litres ( 33 imp gal ; 40 US gal ) per minute at ground level through installed steel casings .

 " Detour " is the fourth episode of the fifth season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It was written by executive producer Frank Spotnitz and directed by Brett Dowler . The episode aired in the United States on November 23 , 1997 , on the Fox network . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , a stand @-@ alone plot which is unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " Detour " received a Nielsen rating of 13 @.@ 2 , being watched by 22 @.@ 8 million viewers , and received mixed reviews from television critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In this episode , Mulder and Scully , while traveling to a conference with two other FBI agents , stop at a roadblock and join a nearby investigation of attacks by an unidentified predator . 
 Executive producer Frank Spotnitz was inspired to write the episode after watching the 1972 American thriller film Deliverance . " Detour " took nineteen days to film , over eleven more than the norm for The X @-@ Files . Shooting was hampered by incessant rain . The episode 's villains were created through a mixture of elaborate " bark suits " and digital technology . In addition , the episode contained several cultural references . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Two men are surveying an area of the Apalachicola National Forest in Leon County , Florida when they are attacked and killed by unseen assailants with glowing red eyes . Later that day , Michael Asekoff and his son , Louis , are hunting for possums with their dog , Bo , in the same stretch of woods . Upon discovering a surveyor 's bloody jacket , the father orders his son to take the dog and run home . As the son and dog take off , two shots are heard . 
 Meanwhile , Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) are carpooling with FBI agents Michael Kinsley and Carla <unk> en route to a " team building " seminar . When they are stopped at a roadblock by local police , Mulder decides to investigate . As Mulder and Scully venture into the woods , they are informed by Officer Michele Fazekas that no conclusive evidence has been found to support Louis ' report of a shooting . Mulder sees this as a perfect opportunity to ditch the seminar . Later , Mulder explains to Scully that no species native to North America will attack a stronger member of its prey when there is a weaker target available . 
 At the Asekoff residence , Bo becomes upset and begins barking . Mrs. Asekoff lets him outside but when she attempts to retrieve him , the dog refuses to budge . She turns to go back inside but discovers that it has been bolted from the inside . Louis hears his mother 's screams and climbs out of bed , but a dark , shadowy figure with red eyes corners him . Louis barely escapes through the dog door where he runs into Mulder , informing him of the creature 's whereabouts in the house . 
 The next morning , Mulder shows Scully some tracks by the front door of the house that appear to be human . Based on the weight distribution , however , the assailant evidently travels on the balls of its feet rather than from heel to toe . Additionally , that the creature lured the mother out of the house in order to get to Louis suggests to Mulder that the creatures are paranormal in nature . 
 Jeff Glaser , a local technician armed with a FLIR device , joins Fazekas , Mulder , and Scully on a search for the creature . They soon spot two creatures on the FLIR which travel in separate directions , causing the four to split up . Fazekas is attacked and disappears . Mulder deduces from this that the creatures may be related to the Mothman of Point Pleasant , West Virginia . After a brief encounter with the creatures , Glaser takes off running and is swiftly killed by a creature . Mulder is grabbed by the other creature , though it releases him after Scully manages to wound it with her firearm . 
 The next morning , Scully falls through a hole into an underground chamber where the bodies of their missing companions are stored . Spotting a pair of red eyes , Scully realizes she does not have her firearm on her . Mulder drops his down to her as the bushes behind him begin to rustle . He jumps in the hole as Scully shoots the creature and kills it . As they examine the dead creature , they notice its almost human @-@ like features and wood @-@ like skin . Nearby , the words " Ad <unk> " , Latin for " into darkness " , are found carved into a tree trunk . 
 Mulder , Scully , Asekoff , and Fazekas are rescued , but there is no sign of Glaser or the other creature . Upon leaving the forest , Mulder states that the creature may , in fact , be an evolved version of the first Spanish conquistadors who had first settled in the forest 450 years before . Although Kinsley finds it ridiculous , Mulder believes that centuries of seclusion could be adequate for such drastic adaptations to happen . Afterwards , Mulder realizes that the creatures presume others ' presence in their territory as threatening and rushes to the hotel room where Scully is packing her things . After ascertaining that she is finished packing , he firmly urges her to vacate the room , which she does . The camera then pans under the bed where a pair of red eyes open .

 Executive producer Frank Spotnitz was inspired to write the episode after watching the 1972 American thriller film Deliverance . Spotnitz recounted , " the idea of being stranded in a hostile environment is very interesting to me and so is the idea of something moving the brush that you can 't see . " Series writer Vince Gilligan contributed to the " team builder " exercise bit . The ending was left intentionally ambiguous . Spotnitz explained , " it 's scarier if you think [ the monster ] could still be out there . " 
 Initially , scenes were filmed at the Seymour Demonstration Forest in North Vancouver . Although the typical shooting time for an episode of The X @-@ Files is eight days , " Detour " took nineteen days to film . Second unit director Brett Dowler later recounted that it " rained every day " . This put a strain on the cast and crew because almost every main shot needed was intended to be outdoors in the daylight . Because of the massive delays , changes were made : the actors ' schedules were rearranged and Kim Manners was brought in to assist Dowler in finishing the second unit of the episode . Filming later moved to a soundstage to avoid the incessant rain . Spotnitz later noted that " I thought I 'd come up with a very simple concept . Literally , one that was easy for the props people and all the other departments . " 
 Initially , it was decided that the antagonists of the episode would be dressed in elaborate " bark suits " so that they would blend into their surroundings . Special effects supervisors Toby Lindala created several elaborate suits made from faux bark . In the end , however , difficulties were so great that the show switched to digital effects . Visual effects supervisor Laurie Kallsen @-@ George was tasked with creating the glowing red eyes . Kallsen @-@ George digitized and blended various " eyeball images " — including shots of her family 's dog .

 The plot and nature of the episode bears a striking resemblance to the film Predator ( 1987 ) , in which a creature that is able to perfectly camouflage itself , almost to the point of complete invisibility , stalks several humans in a dense jungle . While camping in the woods overnight , Scully sings " Joy to the World " by Three Dog Night while Mulder rests so that he can know she is awake and on guard . Originally , Scully was supposed to sing " I 'm So Lonesome I Could Cry " , a 1949 country song by Hank Williams . However , series creator Chris Carter requested something more " off the wall " . Spotnitz , instead , chose " Joy to the World " and later said , " in retrospect , the song was perfect " . When talking , Mulder admits that the only time he has ever thought about " seriously dying " was at the Ice Capades .

While the character @-@ driven moments are a highlight , the actual ' case ' is far from special , often digressing from its purpose as a trigger for the character work . In the end , it ’ s fairly average . " Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four . She called the scene featuring Scully singing to Mulder " a failed attempt to create ' a special X @-@ Files moment ' " and noted that the sequence was " a poor substitute for meaningful dialogue " . Vitaris , however , did applaud the guest cast and called the creature 's effects " very creepy " . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode two stars out of five . The two noted that it replicated " Quagmire " too much for its own good and was " satisfied with the intention alone " . They reasoned that because " it 's so busy telling us how cute the interplay " between Mulder and Scully is , the episode " forgets to make it any good " . Shearman and Pearson also called the Spanish conquistador revelation " so utterly left field it feels self @-@ parodic . " 
 = Flora of Scotland = 
 The flora of Scotland is an assemblage of native plant species including over 1 @,@ 600 vascular plants , more than 1 @,@ 500 lichens and nearly 1 @,@ 000 bryophytes . The total number of vascular species is low by world standard but lichens and bryophytes are abundant and the latter form a population of global importance . Various populations of rare fern exist , although the impact of 19th century collectors threatened the existence of several species . The flora is generally typical of the north west European part of the Palearctic ecozone and prominent features of the Scottish flora include boreal Caledonian forest ( much reduced from its natural extent ) , heather moorland and coastal machair . In addition to the native varieties of vascular plants there are numerous non @-@ native introductions , now believed to make up some 43 % of the species in the country . 
 There are a variety of important trees species and specimens ; a Grand Fir in Argyll is the tallest tree in the United Kingdom and the Fortingall Yew may be the oldest tree in Europe . The Arran Whitebeams , Shetland Mouse @-@ ear and Scottish Primrose are endemic flowering plants and there are a variety of endemic mosses and lichens . Conservation of the natural environment is well developed and various organisations play an important role in the stewardship of the country 's flora . Numerous references to the country 's flora appear in folklore , song and poetry . 
 = = Habitats = = 
 Scotland enjoys a diversity of temperate ecologies , incorporating both deciduous and coniferous woodlands , and moorland , montane , estuarine , freshwater , oceanic , and tundra landscapes . Approximately 14 % of Scotland is wooded , much of it forestry plantations , but prior to human clearing there would have been much larger areas of boreal Caledonian and broad @-@ leaved forest . Although much reduced , significant remnants of the native Scots Pine woodlands can be found in places . 17 % of Scotland is covered by heather moorland and peatland . Caithness and Sutherland have some of the largest and most intact areas of blanket bog in the world , supporting a distinctive wildlife community . 75 % of Scotland 's land is classed as agricultural ( including some moorland ) with urban areas accounting for around 3 % of the total . The number of islands with terrestrial vegetation is nearly 800 , about 600 of them lying off the west coast . Scotland has more than 90 % of the volume and 70 % of the total surface area of fresh water in the United Kingdom . There are more than 30 @,@ 000 freshwater lochs and 6 @,@ 600 river systems . 
 Below the tree line there are several zones of climax forest . Birch dominates to the west and north , Scots Pine with Birch and oak in the eastern Highlands and oak ( both Quercus robur and Q. <unk> ) with Birch in the Central Lowlands and Borders . Much of the Scottish coastline consists of machair , a fertile dune pasture land formed as sea levels subsided after the last ice age . <unk> have received considerable ecological and <unk> attention , chiefly because of their unique ecosystems . 
 = = Flowering plants and shrubs = = 
 The total number of vascular species is low by world standards , partly due to the effects of Pleistocene glaciations ( which eliminated all or nearly all species ) and the subsequent creation of the North Sea ( which created a barrier to re @-@ colonisation ) . Nonetheless , there are a variety of important species and assemblages . Heather moor containing Ling , Bell Heather , Cross @-@ leaved Heath , Bog Myrtle and fescues is generally abundant and contains various smaller flowering species such as <unk> and Alpine Ladies @-@ mantle . Cliffs and mountains host a diversity of arctic and alpine plants including Alpine <unk> , Mossy <unk> , Mountain <unk> and Fir <unk> . On the Hebridean islands of the west coast , there are <unk> pastures , which grow well in locations exposed to sea spray and include Red <unk> , Sea Plantain and Sea Pink . The machair landscapes include rare species such as Irish Lady 's <unk> , Yellow Rattle and numerous orchids along with more common species such as Marram and Buttercup , <unk> , Bird 's @-@ foot Trefoil and <unk> Plantain . Scots <unk> , ( <unk> <unk> ) first recorded in 1684 by Robert Sibbald , and the Oyster Plant are common plants of the coasts .

 <unk> and Water Lobelia are common plants of moorland pools and <unk> . The Least ( Nuphar pumila ) , Yellow and White Water @-@ lilies are also widespread . <unk> has generated some botanical controversy regarding its discovery , classification and distribution . It was found growing on Skye in the 18th century , although there was subsequent confusion as to both the discoverer and the correct scientific name – now agreed to be Eriocaulon <unk> . The European range of this plant is confined to Scotland and western Ireland and it is one of only a small number of species which is common in North America , but very restricted in Europe . There are a few localised examples of the Rigid <unk> ( Ceratophyllum <unk> ) . 
 = = = Grasses and sedges = = = 
 Grasses and sedges are common everywhere except dune systems ( where marram grass may be locally abundant ) and stony mountain tops and plateaux . The total number of species is large , 84 have been recorded on the verges of a single road in West Lothian . Smooth Meadow @-@ grass and Broad @-@ leaved Meadow @-@ grass are widespread in damp lowland conditions , Wood Sedge ( Carex sylvatica ) in woodlands , and Oval Sedge and Early Hair @-@ grass on upland moors . In damp conditions Phragmites reeds and several species of Juncus are found abundantly including <unk> Rush , Soft Rush and Toad Rush , and less commonly the introduced species Slender Rush . Common <unk> is a familiar site on marshy land , but Saltmarsh Sedge ( Carex salina ) was only discovered for the first time in 2004 at the head of Loch <unk> .

 Shetland Mouse @-@ ear ( Cerastium nigrescens ) is an endemic plant found in Shetland . It was first recorded in 1837 by Shetland botanist Thomas <unk> . Although reported from two other sites in the 19th century , it currently grows only on two serpentine hills on the island of Unst . 
 The Scottish Primrose ( Primula scotica ) , is endemic to the north coast including Caithness and Orkney . It is closely related to the Arctic species Primula stricta and Primula <unk> . 
 Young 's Helleborine ( <unk> <unk> ) is a rare endemic orchid principally found on <unk> created by the coal @-@ mining industry in the Central Lowlands and classified as endangered .

 Some of Scotland 's flowering plant species have extremely restricted ranges in the country . These include <unk> lapponica , found only on the slopes of <unk> an Utha , Argyll and Mountain <unk> , recorded at only a few mainland locations , and on Skye and Orkney . The pinewoods of Strathspey contain rare species such as Creeping Lady 's <unk> , <unk> and the One @-@ flowered Wintergreen . Plans to protect the Intermediate Wintergreen , also found here , were introduced in 2008 .

 A number of non @-@ native , invasive species have been identified as a threat to native biodiversity , including Giant Hogweed , Japanese Knotweed and Rhododendron . In May 2008 it was announced that psyllid lice from Japan , which feed on the Knotweed , may be introduced to the UK to bring the plant under control . This would be the first time that an alien species has been used in Britain in this way . Scientists at the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux International do not believe the lice will cause any environmental damage . Over @-@ grazing caused by the large numbers of Red Deer and sheep has also resulted in the impoverishment of moorland and upland habitats and a loss of native woodland . 
 = = Deciduous trees = = 
 Only thirty @-@ one species of deciduous tree and shrub are native to Scotland , including 10 willows , four whitebeams and three birch and cherry species . 
 The <unk> Beech hedges located in Perth and Kinross were planted in the autumn of 1745 by Jean Mercer and her husband , Robert Murray Nairne . This European Beech hedge , which is 530 metres ( 0 @.@ 3 miles ) in length , reaches 30 metres ( 100 ft ) in height and is noted in the Guinness World Records as the tallest and longest hedge on Earth . 
 The Arran Whitebeams are species unique to the Isle of Arran . The Arran Whitebeam ( Sorbus arranensis ) and the Cut @-@ leaved Whitebeam ( S. pseudofennica ) are amongst the most endangered tree species in the world if rarity is measured by numbers alone . Only 236 S. pseudofennica and 283 S. arranensis were recorded as mature trees in 1980 . The trees developed in a highly complex fashion involving the Rock Whitebeam ( S. rupicola ) , which is found on nearby Holy Isle but not Arran , interbreeding with the Rowan ( S. <unk> ) to produce the new species . In 2007 it was announced that two specimens of a third new hybrid , the Catacol Whitebeam ( S. <unk> ) had been discovered by researchers on Arran . This tree is a cross between the native Rowan and S. pseudofennica . 
 Shakespeare makes reference to Birnam Wood being used as camouflage for Malcolm Canmore ’ s army before the battle at Dunsinane with MacBeth . There is an ancient tree , the Birnam Oak , standing a few hundred metres from the centre of Birnam . It may well have been part of Birnam Wood at the time of the battle 900 years ago , and remains part of the legend . 
 Research into the possible commercial use of Sea Buckthorn was undertaken by Moray College commencing in 2006 . The orange berries can be processed into jams , liquors and ointments and the hardy species grows well even on exposed west coasts .

 The Scots Pine and Common Juniper are the only coniferous trees definitely native to Scotland with Yew a possible contender . 
 The Fortingall Yew is an ancient tree in the churchyard of the village of Fortingall in Perthshire . Various estimates have put its age at between 2 @,@ 000 and 5 @,@ 000 years ; recent research into yew tree ages suggests that it is likely to be nearer the lower limit of 2 @,@ 000 years . This still makes it the oldest tree in Europe , although there is an older Norway Spruce root system in Sweden . 
 At 64 @.@ 3 metres ( 211 ft ) , a Grand Fir planted beside Loch Fyne , Argyll in the 1870s was named as the UK ’ s tallest tree in 2011 .

The Killarney Fern , once found on Arran was thought to be extinct in Scotland , but has been discovered on Skye in its gametophyte form . 
 Scotland 's populations of Alpine Woodsia and Oblong Woodsia are on the edge of their natural ranges . The UK distribution of the former is confined to Angus , Perthshire , Argyll and north Wales , and of the latter to Angus , the Moffat Hills , north Wales and two locations in England . The plants were first identified as separate species by John Bolton in 1785 and came under severe threat from Victorian fern collectors in the mid 19th century . <unk> <unk> , first discovered in a sea cave in Kincardineshire , is a rare fern in a UK context whose distribution is confined to Scotland , although recent research suggests that it may be a variant of C. fragilis rather than a species in its own right . 
 = = Non @-@ vascular plants = = 
 Scotland provides ideal growing conditions for many bryophyte species , due to the damp climate , absence of lengthy droughts and winters without protracted hard frosts . In addition , the country 's diverse geology , numerous exposed rocky crags and screes and deep , damp ravines coupled with a relatively pollution @-@ free atmosphere enables a diversity of species to exist . This unique assemblage is in marked contrast to the relative impoverishment of the native vascular plants . There are about 920 species of moss and liverwort in Scotland , with 87 % of UK and 60 % of European bryophytes represented . Scotland 's bryophyte flora is globally important and this small country may host as many as 5 % of the world ’ s species ( in 0 @.@ 05 % of the Earth 's land area , similar in size to South Carolina or Assam ) . The mountains of the North @-@ west Highlands host a unique bryophyte community called the " Northern Hepatic Mat " , which is dominated by a variety of rare liverworts , such as <unk> purpurea and <unk> alpinum . 
 Scotland has played an important part in the development of the understanding of <unk> , with pioneers such as Archibald Menzies and Sir William Hooker commencing explorations at the end of the eighteenth century . <unk> <unk> is named after Robert Brown who first discovered the plant growing at Roslin near Edinburgh and several other species such as <unk> atlantica and <unk> orcadensis were also first discovered in the country .

Endemic species include the Scottish Thread @-@ moss , Dixon ’ s Thread Moss and Scottish Beard @-@ moss . In the Cairngorms there are small stands of Snow Brook @-@ moss and Alpine Thyme @-@ moss , and an abundance of Icy Rock @-@ moss , the latter 's UK population being found only here and at one site in England . The west coast is rich in oceanic mosses such as <unk> <unk> and the Ben <unk> range also provides habitats for various rare species such as Tongue @-@ leaved Gland Moss .

Autumn <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , a nationally scarce species most commonly found in the sessile oak woods of western Scotland , was discovered at a site on Ben Lomond in 2008 . The species is named after the Scottish botanist , William Jameson . Northern <unk> is an endemic liverwort found only in the Beinn <unk> nature reserve . The high Cairngorms provide sites for a variety of other unusual liverworts including <unk> arctica , the European distribution of which is confined to two sites here and Svalbard .

Other nationally rare species found here are <unk> scotica , Cladonia <unk> and <unk> polymorpha . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 Conservation of the natural environment is well developed in the United Kingdom . There are various public sector organisations with an important role in the stewardship of the country 's flora . Scottish Natural Heritage is the statutory body responsible for natural heritage management in Scotland . One of their duties is to establish National Nature Reserves . Until 2004 there were 73 , but a review carried out in that year resulted in a significant number of sites losing their NNR status , and as of 2006 there are 55 . The Forestry Commission in Scotland serves as the forestry department of the Scottish Government and is one of the country 's largest landowners . The Joint Nature Conservation Committee is the statutory adviser to Government on UK and international nature conservation . 
 The country has two national parks . Cairngorms National Park includes the largest area of arctic mountain landscape in the UK . Sites designated as of importance to natural heritage take up 39 % of the land area , two thirds of which are of Europe @-@ wide importance . Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park includes Britain 's largest body of freshwater , the mountains of Breadalbane and the sea lochs of Argyll . 
 There are also numerous charitable and voluntary organisations with an important role to play , of which the more prominent include the following . The National Trust for Scotland is the conservation charity that protects and promotes Scotland 's natural and cultural heritage . With over 270 @,@ 000 members it is the largest conservation charity in Scotland . The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds promotes conservation of birds and other wildlife through the protection and re @-@ creation of habitats . The John Muir Trust is a charity whose main role is as a guardian of wild land and wildlife , through the ownership of land and the promotion of education and conservation . The trust owns and manages estates in various locations , including Knoydart , Assynt , and on the isle of Skye . Trees for Life is a charity that aims to restore a " wild forest " in the Northwest Highlands and Grampian Mountains . 
 Under the auspices of the European Unions Habitats Directive , as at 31 March 2003 a total of 230 sites in Scotland covering an area of 8 @,@ 748 @.@ 08 km2 ( 3 @,@ 377 @.@ 65 sq mi ) had been submitted by the UK government to the European Commission as candidate Special Areas of Conservation ( <unk> ) . 
 The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 prohibits the uprooting of plants without a landowner 's permission and the collection of any part of the most threatened species , which are listed in Schedule 8 . In 2012 the Scottish Government published a " Code of Practice on Non @-@ Native Species " to help people understand their responsibilities and provide guidance as to which public body has responsibility for the various habitats involved . 
 = = Flora in Scottish culture = = 
 Plants feature heavily in Gaelic and Scottish folklore , song and poetry . 
 The thistle has been one of the national emblem of the Scots nation since the reign of Alexander III ( 1249 – 1286 ) and was used on silver coins issued by James III in 1470 . Today , it forms part of the emblem of the Scottish Rugby Union . As legend has it , an invading army had attempted to sneak up at night on the Scots . One , perhaps barefooted , unwelcome foreign soldier stumbled upon a Scots Thistle , and cried out in pain , thus alerting Scots to their presence . Some sources suggest the specific occasion was the Battle of Largs , which marked the beginning of the departure of the Viking monarch Haakon IV of Norway , who had harried the coast for some years . Spiky plants such as brambles appear to have been used around forts since time immemorial , so the story , whether it factually relates to the Haakon episode or not , likely is the culmination of more than one such event over time . In some variants , it is invading English which stumble on a thistle , but the story predates this time . 
 Numerous plants are referred to in Scottish song and verse . These include Robert Burns A Red , Red Rose , Hugh MacDiarmid 's A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle , Sorley MacLean 's Hallaig , Harry Lauder 's I Love A Lassie and in the 21st century , Runrig 's And The <unk> Played . The last two lyrics include a reference to the bluebell . The " Scottish Bluebell " is Campanula rotundifolia , ( known elsewhere as the " Harebell " ) rather than Hyacinthoides non @-@ scripta , the " Common Bluebell " . 
 Trees held an important place in Gaelic culture from the earliest times . Particularly large trees were venerated , and the most valuable such as oak , Common Hazel and Apple were classed as " nobles " . The less important Common Alder , Common Hawthorn and <unk> were classed as " commoners " , and there were " lower orders " and " slaves " such as Eurasian Aspen and Juniper . The alphabet was learned as a mnemonic using tree names . Rowan was regularly planted close to Highland houses as a protection from witchcraft . 
 Various plants are said to have apotropaic qualities , notably Mountain Ash . <unk> ( <unk> niger ) may have been used as a hallucinogen as long ago as the Neolithic period . This tradition has recently been taken up once again by New Agers . 
 = Grasshopper = 
 Grasshoppers are insects of the order Orthoptera , suborder Caelifera . They are sometimes referred to as short @-@ horned grasshoppers to distinguish them from the katydids ( bush crickets ) which have much longer antennae . They are typically ground @-@ dwelling insects with powerful hind legs which enable them to escape from threats by leaping vigorously . They are hemimetabolous insects ( do not undergo complete metamorphosis ) which hatch from an egg into a nymph or " hopper " which undergoes five moults , becoming more similar to the adult insect at each developmental stage . At high population densities and under certain environmental conditions , some grasshopper species can change colour and behaviour and form swarms . Under these circumstances they are known as locusts . 
 Grasshoppers are plant @-@ eaters , sometimes becoming serious pests of cereals , vegetables and pasture , especially when they swarm in their millions as locusts and destroy crops over wide areas . They protect themselves from predators by camouflage ; when detected , many species attempt to startle the predator with a brilliantly @-@ coloured wing @-@ flash while jumping and ( if adult ) launching themselves into the air , usually flying for only a short distance . Other species such as the rainbow grasshopper have warning coloration which deters predators . Grasshoppers are affected by parasites and various diseases , and many predatory creatures feed on both nymphs and adults . The eggs are the subject of attack by parasitoids and predators . 
 Grasshoppers have had a long relationship with humans . Swarms of locusts have had dramatic effects that have changed the course of history , and even in smaller numbers grasshoppers can be serious pests . They are eaten as food and also feature in art , symbolism and literature . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Grasshoppers have the typical insect body plan of head , thorax and abdomen . The head is held vertically , at an angle to the body with the mouth at the bottom . It bears a large pair of compound eyes which give all @-@ round vision , three simple eyes which can detect light and dark and a pair of thread @-@ like antennae which are sensitive to touch and smell . The downward @-@ directed mouthparts are modified for chewing and there are two sensory palps in front of the jaws . 
 The thorax and abdomen are segmented and have a rigid cuticle made up of overlapping plates composed of chitin . The three fused thoracic segments bear three pairs of legs and two pairs of wings . The forewings , known as tegmina , are narrow and leathery while the hind wings are large and membranous , the veins providing strength . The legs are terminated by claws for gripping . The hind leg is particularly powerful ; the femur is robust and has several ridges where different surfaces join and the inner ridges bear stridulatory pegs in some species . The posterior edge of the tibia bears a double row of spines and there are a pair of articulated spurs near its lower end . The interior of the thorax houses the muscles that control the limbs . 
 The abdomen has eleven segments , the first of which is fused to the thorax and contains the auditory organ and tympanum . Segments two to eight are ring @-@ shaped and joined by flexible membranes . Segments nine to eleven are reduced ; segment nine bears a pair of cerci and segments ten and eleven house the reproductive organs . Female grasshoppers are normally larger than males , with short ovipositors . The name " Caelifera " comes from the Latin and means chisel @-@ bearing , referring to the sharp ovipositor . 
 Those species that make easily heard noises usually do so by rubbing a row of pegs on the hind femurs against the edges of the forewings ( stridulation ) . These sounds are produced mainly by males to attract females , though in some species the females also stridulate . 
 Grasshoppers are easily confused with the other sub @-@ order of Orthoptera , Ensifera ( crickets ) , but differ in many aspects , such as the number of segments in their antennae and structure of the ovipositor , as well as the location of the tympana and modes of sound production . <unk> have antennae that can be much longer than the body and have at least 20 – 24 segments , while <unk> have fewer segments in their shorter , stouter antennae . 
 = = Phylogeny and evolution = = 
 The phylogeny of the Caelifera based on mitochondrial RNA of 32 taxa in six out of seven superfamilies is shown as a cladogram . The Ensifera , Caelifera and all the superfamilies of grasshoppers except <unk> appear to be monophyletic . 
 In evolutionary terms , the split between the Caelifera and the Ensifera is no more recent than the Permo @-@ Triassic boundary ; the earliest insects that are certainly <unk> are in the extinct families <unk> and <unk> from the early Triassic . The group diversified during the Triassic and have remained important plant @-@ eaters from that time to now . The first modern families such as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> appeared in the Cretaceous , though some insects that might belong to the last two of these groups are found in the early Jurassic . Morphological classification is difficult because many taxa have converged towards a common habitat type ; recent taxonomists have concentrated on the internal genitalia , especially those of the male . This information is not available from fossil specimens , and the <unk> taxonomy is founded principally on the venation of the hindwings . 
 = = Diversity and range = = 
 The Caelifera includes some 2 @,@ 400 valid genera and about 11 @,@ 000 species . Many undescribed species probably exist , especially in tropical wet forests . The Caelifera have a predominantly tropical distribution with fewer species known from temperate zones , but most of the superfamilies have representatives worldwide . They are almost exclusively herbivorous and are probably the oldest living group of chewing herbivorous insects . 
 = = Biology = = 
 = = = Diet and digestion = = = 
 Most grasshoppers are polyphagous , eating vegetation from multiple plant sources , but some are omnivorous and also eat animal tissue and animal faeces . In general their preference is for grasses , including many cereals grown as crops . The mandibles chew the food slightly and salivary glands in the buccal cavity chemically begin to digest the carbohydrates present in it . The food is then passed via the oesophagus to the crop where it is stored temporarily and chemical digestion continues . Next it moves to the gizzard which has muscular walls and tooth @-@ like plates which grind the food . From here , food enters the stomach , where six hepatic caeca add further enzymes and digestion is completed . At the junction between mid and hind @-@ gut , several fine tubes known as malpighian tubules add the excretory products ( uric acid , urea and amino acids ) to the contents of the gut . Absorption of nutrients takes place in the ileum and any undigested residue is passed on to the colon . Here water is absorbed and the residue becomes solid . After storage in the rectum , the faeces are expelled as small dry pellets . 
 = = = Sensory organs = = = 
 Grasshoppers have a typical insect nervous system , and have an extensive set of external sense organs . On the side of the head are a pair of large compound eyes which give a broad field of vision and can detect movement , shape , colour and distance . There are also three simple eyes ( ocelli ) on the forehead which can detect light intensity , a pair of antennae containing olfactory ( smell ) and touch receptors , and mouthparts containing gustatory ( taste ) receptors . At the front end of the abdomen there is a pair of tympanal organs for sound reception . There are numerous fine hairs covering the whole body that act as mechanoreceptors ( touch and wind sensors ) , and these are most dense on the antennae , the palps ( part of the mouth ) , and on the cerci at the tip of the abdomen . There are special receptors ( <unk> sensillae ) embedded in the cuticle of the legs that sense pressure and cuticle distortion . There are internal " <unk> " sense organs specialized to detect position and movement about the joints of the exoskeleton . The receptors convey information to the central nervous system through sensory neurons , and most of these have their cell bodies located in the periphery near the receptor site itself . 
 = = = Circulation and respiration = = = 
 Like other insects , grasshoppers have an open circulatory system and their body cavities are filled with haemolymph . A heart @-@ like structure pumps the fluid to the head from where it percolates past the tissues and organs on its way back to the abdomen . It circulates nutrients throughout the body and carries metabolic wastes to be excreted into the gut . The haemolymph and the circulatory system are not involved in gaseous exchange . Respiration is performed using tracheae , air @-@ filled tubes , which open at the surfaces of the thorax and abdomen through pairs of <unk> spiracles . Larger insects may need to actively ventilate their bodies by opening some spiracles while others remain closed , using abdominal muscles to expand and contract the body and pump air through the system . 
 = = = Jumping = = = 
 A large grasshopper such as a locust can jump about a metre ( twenty body lengths ) without using its wings ; the acceleration peaks at about 20 g . Grasshoppers jump by extending their large back legs and pushing against the substrate ( the ground , a twig , a blade of grass or whatever else they are standing on ) ; the reaction force propels them into the air . They jump for several reasons ; to escape from a predator , to launch themselves for flight , or simply to move from place to place . For the escape jump in particular there is strong selective pressure to maximize take @-@ off velocity , since this determines the range . This means that the legs must thrust against the ground with both high force and a high velocity of movement . However , a fundamental property of muscle is that it cannot contract with both high force and high velocity , which seems like a problem . Grasshoppers overcome this apparent contradiction by using a catapult mechanism to amplify the mechanical power produced by their muscles . 
 The jump is a three @-@ stage process . First , the grasshopper fully flexes the lower part of the leg ( tibia ) against the upper part ( femur ) by activating the flexor tibiae muscle ( the back legs of the immature grasshopper in the top photograph are in this preparatory position ) . Second , there is a period of co @-@ contraction in which force builds up in the large , <unk> extensor tibiae muscle , but the tibia is kept flexed by the simultaneous contraction of the flexor tibiae muscle . The extensor muscle is much stronger than the flexor muscle , but the latter is aided by specializations in the joint that give it a large effective mechanical advantage over the former when the tibia is fully flexed . Co @-@ contraction can last for up to half a second , and during this period the extensor muscle shortens and stores elastic strain energy by distorting stiff cuticular structures in the leg . The extensor muscle contraction is quite slow ( almost isometric ) , which allows it to develop high force ( up to 14 N in the desert locust ) , but because it is slow only low power is needed . The third stage of the jump is the trigger relaxation of the flexor muscle , which releases the tibia from the flexed position . The subsequent rapid tibial extension is driven mainly by the relaxation of the elastic structures , rather than by further shortening of the extensor muscle . In this way the stiff cuticle acts like the elastic of a catapult , or the bow of a bow @-@ and @-@ arrow . Energy is put into the store at low power by slow but strong muscle contraction , and retrieved from the store at high power by rapid relaxation of the mechanical elastic structures . 
 = = = Lifecycle and reproduction = = = 
 Grasshoppers lay their eggs in pods in the ground near food plants , generally in the summer . The eggs in the pod are glued together with a froth in some species . After a few weeks of development , the eggs of most species go into diapause , and pass the winter in this state ; in a few species the eggs hatch in the same summer they were laid . Diapause is broken by a sufficiently low ground temperature ; development resumes as soon as the ground warms above a threshold temperature . The embryos in a pod generally all hatch out within a few minutes of each other . They soon shed their membranes and their exoskeletons harden . These first instar nymphs can then jump away from predators . 
 Grasshoppers have incomplete metamorphosis : they repeatedly moult ( undergo ecdysis ) , becoming larger and more like an adult , with for instance larger wing @-@ buds , in each instar . The number of instars varies between species . At the final moult , the wings are inflated and become fully functional . The migratory grasshopper , <unk> <unk> , spends about 25 – 30 days as a nymph depending on sex and temperature , and about 51 days as an adult . 
 Males stridulate , rapidly rasping the hind femur against the forewing to create a churring sound , to attract mates . Females select suitable egg @-@ laying sites , such as bare soil or near the roots of food plants according to species . Males often gather around an ovipositing female ; in some species she is mated as soon as she takes her ovipositor out of the ground . After laying the eggs , the female covers the hole with soil and litter . 
 = = Predators , parasites and pathogens = = 
 Grasshoppers have a wide range of predators at different stages of their life @-@ cycle . Eggs are eaten by bee @-@ flies , ground beetles and blister beetles . Hoppers and adults are taken by predators including other insects such as ants , robber flies and <unk> wasps ; spiders ; many birds ; and small mammals . 
 Parasitoids include blowflies , <unk> , and tachinid flies . External parasites include mites . It has been found that female grasshoppers parasitised by mites produce fewer eggs and thus have fewer offspring . This is probably because the individuals concerned allocate resources in response to the parasitism which are then not available for reproduction . 
 <unk> <unk> and Paragordius <unk> are parasitic worms that infect grasshoppers and alter the behaviour of their hosts . The grasshopper is persuaded to leap into a nearby body of water where it drowns , thus enabling the parasite to continue with the next stage of its life cycle which takes place in water . The grasshopper nematode ( Mermis nigrescens ) is a long slender worm that infests grasshoppers , living in the insect 's hemocoel . Adult worms lay eggs on plants and the host gets infected when it eats the foliage . 
 Grasshoppers are affected by diseases caused by bacteria , viruses , fungi and protozoa . The bacteria Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have both been implicated in causing disease in grasshoppers , as has the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana . This widespread fungus has been used to control various pest insects around the world , but although it infects grasshoppers , basking in the sun has the result of raising the insect 's temperature above a threshold tolerated by the fungus , and the infection is not lethal . The fungal pathogen <unk> <unk> is able to influence the behaviour of its grasshopper host , causing it to climb to the top of a plant and cling to the stem as it dies . This ensures wide dispersal of the fungal spores liberated from the corpse . 
 The fungal pathogen Metarhizium <unk> is found in Africa , Australia and Brazil where it has caused epizootics in grasshoppers . It is being investigated for possible use as a microbial insecticide for locust control . The microsporidian fungus Nosema <unk> , once considered to be a protozoan , can be lethal to grasshoppers . It has to be consumed by mouth and is the basis for a bait @-@ based commercial microbial pesticide . Various other microsporidians and protozoans are found in the gut . 
 = = = Anti @-@ predator defences = = = 
 Grasshoppers exemplify a range of anti @-@ predator adaptations , enabling them to avoid detection , to escape if detected , and in some cases to avoid being eaten if captured . Grasshoppers are often camouflaged to avoid detection by predators that hunt by sight . Their colouration usually resembles the background , whether green for leafy vegetation , sandy for open areas or grey for rocks . Some species can change their colouration to suit their surroundings . 
 Several species such as the hooded leaf grasshopper <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) are detailed mimics of leaves . Grasshoppers often have deimatic patterns on their wings , giving a sudden flash of bright colours that may startle predators long enough to give time to escape in a combination of jump and flight . 
 Some species are genuinely aposematic , having both bright warning coloration and sufficient toxicity to dissuade predators . <unk> productus ( <unk> ) is a " heavy , bloated , sluggish insect " that makes no attempt to hide ; it has a bright red abdomen . A Cercopithecus monkey that ate other grasshoppers refused to eat the species . Another species , the rainbow or painted grasshopper of Arizona , <unk> bicolor ( <unk> ) , has been shown by experiment with a natural predator , the little striped whiptail lizard , to be aposematic .

 Grasshoppers are occasionally depicted in artworks , such as the Dutch Golden Age painter Balthasar van der <unk> 's still life oil painting , Flowers in a Vase with Shells and Insects , c . 1630 , now in the National Gallery , London , though the insect may be a bush @-@ cricket . 
 Another orthopteran is found in Rachel <unk> 's still life Flowers in a Vase , c . 1685 . The seemingly static scene is animated by a " grasshopper on the table that looks about ready to spring " , according to the gallery curator Betsy <unk> , with other invertebrates including a spider , an ant , and two caterpillars . 
 = = = Symbolism = = = 
 Grasshoppers are sometimes used as symbols , as in Sir Thomas Gresham 's gilded grasshopper in Lombard Street , London , dating from 1563 ; the building was for a while the headquarters of the Guardian Royal Exchange , but the company declined to use the symbol for fear of confusion with the locust . 
 When grasshoppers appear in dreams , these have been interpreted as symbols of " Freedom , independence , spiritual enlightenment , inability to settle down or commit to decision " . Locusts are taken literally to mean devastation of crops in the case of farmers ; figuratively as " wicked men and women " for non @-@ farmers ; and " <unk> , misfortune , & ephemeral happiness " by " gypsies " . 
 = = = As food = = = 
 In some countries , grasshoppers are used as food . In southern Mexico , grasshoppers , known as <unk> , are eaten in a variety of dishes , such as in tortillas with chilli sauce . Grasshoppers are served on skewers in some Chinese food markets , like the <unk> Night Market . Fried grasshoppers ( <unk> goreng ) are eaten in the Gunung Kidul area of <unk> , Java in Indonesia . In the Arab world , grasshoppers are boiled , salted , and sun @-@ dried , and eaten as snacks . In Native America , the Ohlone people burned grassland to herd grasshoppers into pits where they could be collected as food . 
 It is recorded in the Bible that John the Baptist ate locusts and wild honey ( Greek : ἀκρίδες καὶ <unk> <unk> , <unk> kai meli <unk> ) while living in the wilderness ; attempts have been made to explain the locusts as suitably ascetic vegetarian food such as carob beans , but the plain meaning of ἀκρίδες is the insects . 
 = = = As pests = = = 
 Grasshoppers eat large quantities of foliage both as adults and during their development , and can be serious pests of arid land and prairies . Pasture , grain , forage , vegetable and other crops can be affected . Grasshoppers often bask in the sun , and thrive in warm sunny conditions , so drought stimulates an increase in grasshopper populations . A single season of drought is not normally sufficient to stimulate a massive population increase , but several successive dry seasons can do so , especially if the intervening winters are mild so that large numbers of nymphs survive . Although sunny weather stimulates growth , there needs to be an adequate food supply for the increasing grasshopper population . This means that although precipitation is needed to stimulate plant growth , prolonged periods of cloudy weather will slow nymphal development . 
 Grasshoppers can best be prevented from becoming pests by manipulating their environment . Shade provided by trees will discourage them and they may be prevented from moving onto developing crops by removing coarse vegetation from fallow land and field margins and discouraging luxurious growth beside ditches and on roadside verges . With increasing numbers of grasshoppers , predator numbers may increase , but this seldom happens sufficiently rapidly to have much effect on populations . Biological control is being investigated but with little success . On a small scale , neem products can be effective as a feeding deterrent and as a disruptor of nymphal development . Insecticides can be used , but adult grasshoppers are difficult to kill , and as they move into fields from surrounding rank growth , crops may soon become reinfested . 
 Grasshoppers , like the Chinese rice grasshopper , are a pest in rice paddies . Ploughing exposes the eggs on the surface of the field , to be destroyed by sunshine or eaten by natural enemies . Some eggs may be buried too deeply in the soil for hatching to take place . 
 = = = Locusts = = = 
 Locusts are the swarming phase of certain species of short @-@ horned grasshoppers in the family Acrididae . It has been shown that swarming behaviour is a response to overcrowding . Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin . This causes the grasshopper to change colour , feed more and breed faster . The transformation of a solitary individual into a swarming one is induced by several contacts per minute over a short period . 
 Following this transformation , under suitable conditions dense nomadic bands of flightless nymphs can occur , producing pheromones which attract them to each other . With several generations in a year , the locust population can build up from localised groups into vast accumulations of flying insects known as plagues , devouring all the vegetation they encounter . The largest recorded locust swarm was one of the now @-@ extinct Rocky Mountain locust in 1875 , which was 1 @,@ 800 miles ( 2 @,@ 900 km ) long and 110 miles ( 180 km ) wide . 
 An adult desert locust can eat about 2 g ( 0 @.@ 1 oz ) each day so the billions of insects in a large swarm can be very destructive , stripping all the foliage from plants in an affected area and also consuming stems , flowers , fruits , seeds and bark . Locust plagues can have devastating effects on human populations , causing famines and population upheavals . They are mentioned in both the Koran and the Bible and have been held responsible for cholera epidemics , resulting from the corpses of locusts drowned in the Mediterranean Sea and decomposing on beaches . 
 The FAO and other organisations monitor locust activity around the world . Timely application of pesticides can prevent nomadic bands of hoppers joining together and proliferating before dense swarms of adults are built up . Besides conventional control using contact insecticides , biological pest control using the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium <unk> which specifically infects grasshoppers has been used with some success . 
 = = = In literature = = = 
 The Egyptian word for locust or grasshopper was written <unk> in the consonantal hieroglyphic writing system . The pharaoh Ramesses II compared the armies of the Hittites to locusts : " They covered the mountains and valleys and were like locusts in their multitude . " 
 One of Aesop 's Fables , later retold by La Fontaine , is the tale of The Ant and the Grasshopper . The ant works hard all summer , while the grasshopper plays . In winter , the ant is ready but the grasshopper starves . Somerset Maugham 's short story " The Ant and the Grasshopper " explores the fable 's symbolism via complex framing . The Canadian philosopher Bernard Suits retells the story with the grasshopper as " the exemplification of the life most worth living . " Other human weaknesses besides <unk> have become identified with the grasshopper 's behaviour . So an unfaithful woman ( hopping from man to man ) is " a grasshopper " in " <unk> " , an 1892 short story by Anton Chekhov , and in Jerry Paris 's 1969 film The Grasshopper . 
 The 1957 film Beginning of the End portrayed giant grasshoppers attacking Chicago . In the 1998 film A Bug 's Life , the heroes are the members of an ant colony , and the lead villain and his henchmen are grasshoppers .

 = Ikuhiko Hata = 
 Ikuhiko Hata ( <unk> <unk> , Hata Ikuhiko , born 12 December 1932 ) is a Japanese historian . He acquired his PhD at the University of Tokyo and has taught history at several universities . He is the author of a number of influential and well @-@ received scholarly works , particularly on topics related to Japan 's role in the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War and World War II . 
 Hata is variously regarded as being a " conservative " historian or a " centrist " . He has written extensively on such controversial subjects as the Nanking Massacre and the comfort women . Fellow historian Edward Drea has called him " the doyen of Japanese military historians " . 
 = = Education and career = = 
 Ikuhiko Hata was born on 12 December 1932 in the city of <unk> in Yamaguchi Prefecture . He graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1956 and received his PhD there in 1974 . He worked as chief historian of the Japanese Ministry of Finance between 1956 and 1976 and during this period from 1963 to 1965 he was also a research assistant at Harvard University . After resigning his post at the Finance Ministry Hata served as a visiting professor at Princeton University from 1977 to 1978 and then was a history professor at <unk> University from 1980 to 1993 , at Chiba University from 1994 to 1997 , and at Nihon University from 1997 to 2002 . 
 = = Scholarship = = 
 Hata has been described by numerous historians as an important scholar on the history of modern Japan . Historian Edward Drea has called him " the doyen of Japanese military historians " , and has written that Hata 's " published works are models of scholarship , research , accuracy , and judicious interpretation " , and Joshua A. Fogel , a historian of China at York University , concurs that Hata " is an eminent scholar who has for over forty years been writing numerous excellent studies of Japan at war . " Masahiro Yamamoto called him " a leading Japanese scholar in the field of Japan 's modern history " . 
 Hata 's first published history book was <unk> <unk> ( " A History of the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War " ) , released in 1961 , which he began researching while completing his bachelor 's degree at the University of Tokyo . The work was well @-@ received , described by Chalmers Johnson as " the most thorough study of Japanese policies in China during the 1930s " and by James T.C. Liu as " a welcome and pioneering contribution " . Fifty years after its publication Edward Drea and Tobe Ryoichi called it " a classic account " of the war . Hata 's second book , the 1962 work Gun <unk> <unk> shi ( " A History of the Military Fascist Movement " ) , was promoted by the historian <unk> Domon as " a first @-@ rate narrative interpretation based on extensive use of documentary evidence . " 
 The Japan Association of International Relations selected Hata for a part of what historian James William Morley described as a team of " young , objective diplomatic and military historians " to be given unprecedented access to primary source records to write the history of the origins of World War II in Asia . The result was <unk> sensō e no michi ( " The Road to the Pacific War " ) , published between 1962 and 1963 and then translated into English in the 1970s and 1980s . Hata contributed three essays to the series . Roger Dingman described the first , " The Japanese @-@ Soviet Confrontation , 1935 – 1939 " , as " a wealth of new data " , and praised the second , " The Army 's Move into Northern Indochina " , for demonstrating " brilliantly how peaceful passage through northern Indochina became forceful occupation " . Mark Peattie wrote that Hata 's third essay , " The Marco Polo Bridge Incident 1937 " , was " the best overview we now have in English " of the event , and Hata would later expand it into a full @-@ length book which Edward Drea and Tobe Ryoichi called " the single best source on the incident " . 
 Starting in 1968 Hata headed a team of scholars with a task from the Ministry of Education to analyze all available sources and documents on the workings of the wartime and prewar armed forces of Japan . The fruit of their research was Nihon <unk> no Seido , <unk> , <unk> ( " Institutions , Organization , and Personnel of the Japanese Army and Navy " ) , released in 1971 , which Mark Peattie called " the authoritative reference work in the field " . Soon after Hata was tasked with coordinating another collaborative research project , this one for the Finance Ministry , on the subject of the occupation of Japan by the United States after World War II . John W. Dower , Sadao Asada , and Roger Dingman credited Hata for the key role he played in producing the multivolume project , which began to be published in 1975 , and deemed it the best work of scholarship on the occupation produced until that point . 
 In 1993 Hata wrote a two @-@ volume work on controversial incidents in modern Japanese history , entitled <unk> no <unk> wo ou ( " Chasing the Riddles of Showa History " ) , which was awarded the Kikuchi Kan Prize . 
 Hata co @-@ wrote two books with Yasuho Izawa on Japanese fighter aces of World War II , both of which were described by historians as the definitive treatments of the subject . 
 A work Hata had written in 1984 , Hirohito Tennō <unk> no <unk> ( " Emperor Hirohito 's Five Decisions " ) , attracted the attention of Marius Jansen , who arranged to have it translated into English as Hirohito : The Showa Emperor in War and Peace . According to Edward Drea , on the question of " whether the emperor was really Japan 's ruler and power @-@ holder or merely a puppet and robot ... [ Hata ] concludes that the answer to this complex question lies somewhere in between , although Hata credits Hirohito with considerable political savvy . " Apart from Drea the book also garnered highly positive reviews from Stephen S. Large and Hugh Cortazzi . 
 = = = Nankin Jiken and Nanking Massacre death toll estimates = = = 
 Hata 's major contribution to Nanking Massacre studies is his book Nankin jiken ( " The Nanking Incident " ) , published in 1986 , which is a detailed study of the event based on Japanese , Chinese , and English sources that was later noted by historians such as <unk> Yang to be one of the few impartial works of scholarship written on the massacre during the period . The book is known for its relatively low estimate of the death toll , which Hata put at about 40 @,@ 000 partly because , unlike most historians of the time , he excluded Chinese soldiers killed in action from his definition of the massacre . Hata 's book is acknowledged as the first to discuss what might have caused the massacre , whereas previous books had focused only on the event itself . Hata argued that the Japanese Army 's lack of military police and facilities to detain POWs , its ignorance of international laws , its excessive mopping @-@ up operations , and the Chinese General Tang Shengzhi 's decision to flee the city without formally surrendering were among the factors which led to the slaughter . 
 Some contemporary researchers including the historian Tomio Hora and the journalist Katsuichi Honda expressed strong disagreement with Hata 's death toll estimate , though both expressed admiration for Hata 's scholarship and sincerity . Hata is today recognized as the major scholar of the so @-@ called " centrist " school of thought on the Nanking Massacre , which in terms of the death toll believes that tens of thousands were killed and thus stands between the " great massacre " school which believes that hundreds of thousands were killed , and the " illusion " school of Nanking Massacre deniers . By contrast , <unk> Kimura has criticized Hata as a " <unk> " of the atrocity , while still acknowledging that his book on the massacre was " an excellent study " and Herbert Bix has described him as " the most notorious " of the " partial deniers " of the Nanking Massacre . However , historians Haruo Tohmatsu and HP Willmott have stated that Hata 's estimate for the death toll is regarded in Japan as being " the most academically reliable estimate " . 
 Hata 's Nankin jiken has continued to receive plaudits from some scholars . In 2000 Marius Jansen endorsed it as " the most reasonable of many Japanese studies " on the massacre and in 2001 prominent Nanking Massacre scholar Yutaka Yoshida deemed it one of the top five books he recommends that people read on the Nanking Massacre , despite disagreeing with its death toll estimate . In 2003 Joshua Fogel called the book " still an authority in the field " , and <unk> University professor David Askew designated it " the best introductory work on the Nanjing Incident in any language " . By 1999 the book was in its nineteenth printing . 
 In November 1997 at a conference in Princeton University Hata was confronted by Iris Chang , author of the book The Rape of Nanking , who asked him why he doubted the testimony of Japanese POWs who had stated that hundreds of thousands of Chinese were killed in the atrocity . When Hata replied that torture and coercion of Japanese POWs made their testimony unreliable Chang walked out and the audience became unruly , shouting Hata down and yelling insults at him . The moderator Perry Link barely kept the situation under control . In the wake of this incident , similar disruptions by Chinese students who disagreed with his death toll estimate prevented Hata from speaking at a number of universities that he visited . Bob Wakabayashi of York University argues that Hata became more strident in his tone following these attacks , once calling it the " Nanking industry " in comparison with Norman Finkelstein 's " Holocaust industry " . In the 1980s Hata had stated that the death toll was 38 @,@ 000 to 42 @,@ 000 while holding out the possibility that it might have been as high as 60 @,@ 000 , but when he wrote the second edition of Nankin Jiken in 2007 he indicated that 42 @,@ 000 massacred was the maximum possible and that the true number might have been lower . 
 = = = Research on comfort women = = = 
 Ikuhiko Hata is a leading historian on the subject of the comfort women who served alongside the Japanese Army in the 1930s and 1940s and is credited with being the first individual to expose as fraudulent the testimony of Seiji Yoshida , who claimed to have kidnapped Korean women for the Japanese military . Hata , who argues that the comfort women were not sex slaves but largely willing prostitutes with minority of them being sold by their parents and more crucially , no direct involvement by Japanese military except few incidents in South East Asia , summed up his views on the issue with , 
 " There were at most 20 @,@ 000 comfort women . None of them were forcibly recruited . Forty percent of them were from Japan , the most heavily represented nation . Many were sold to brokers by their parents . Some responded willingly to brokers ' offers ; others were deceived . I would add that , on the average , living conditions in the comfort stations were practically identical to those in brothels set up for American troops during the Vietnam War . " 
 Historian <unk> Sarah Soh notes that Hata had put the total number of comfort women at 90 @,@ 000 in 1993 but he later revised the number downward because of " his political alignment with the conservative anti @-@ redress camp in Japan that emerged in the latter half of the 1990s " . 
 Hata would expand his research into the 1999 book <unk> to <unk> no sei ( " Comfort women and sex on the battlefield " ) , described by Sarah Soh as " a 444 @-@ page treatise on the comfort women issue " . <unk> to <unk> no sei was noted for its extensive compilation of information , being praised by historian Haruo Tohmatsu as " probably the most well documented study on the question " and by Mainichi Shimbun reporter Takao Yamada as " an encyclopedia @-@ like collection of facts on comfort women " . In The International History Review , A. Hamish Ion stated that with this work Hata has succeeded in creating " a measured evaluation in the face of sensational and supposedly ill @-@ researched studies by George Hicks and others . " The book was also favorably reviewed by political scientist Itaru Shimazu and the journalist Takaaki Ishii . By contrast , historian Hirofumi Hayashi criticized the work for faulty use of documents , such as where Hata cites a document listing 650 comfort women allocated in five prefectures , when in fact the document said 400 comfort women . 
 Hata , who supports the retraction of the Kono Statement on comfort women , was the only historian appointed to the committee established by the government of Shinzo Abe to re @-@ examine the statement . In 2015 Hata led of group of Japanese historians in requesting that the publisher McGraw @-@ Hill make corrections to what they believed were erroneous descriptions of the comfort women in a world history textbook published in the United States . 
 = = Ideological leanings = = 
 Hata 's general ideological leanings have been described in a variety of manners . Some sources have referred to him as being a right @-@ leaning scholar , such as Thomas U. Berger who has called him , " a highly respected conservative Japanese historian " . Others , however , find characterizing Hata in these terms to be inaccurate , such as military historian Masahiro Yamamoto who notes that in the historical debate on the Nanking Massacre Hata was a centrist who actually leaned closer to the " traditionalist " scholars than the conservative " revisionists " . Takao Yamada likewise points out that Hata has criticized all sides in historical controversies and he argues that Hata can be better described as a " positivist " . 
 Hata is known as a strong opponent of the attempts by some Japanese nationalists to revise Japan 's wartime history in a way that he deems ideologically biased . Hata , whom the Wall Street Journal described as an advocate of the " we @-@ did @-@ wrong view " of Japanese history , has expressed grave concern about the advent of new historical revisionists seeking to apologize for Japan 's wartime aggressions and absolve former Prime Minister Hideki Tojo . In 1995 Hata stepped down from a government commission on the construction of a new war museum near Yasukuni Shrine in fear that the project would be used to glorify Japan 's wartime actions . He favors the de @-@ enshrinement of war criminals from Yasukuni Shrine and is also a critic of <unk> , a museum near the shrine , for its nationalist @-@ inspired portrayal of Japanese history . While he has been strongly critical of efforts by Japanese nationalist groups to alter history textbooks , Hata also agreed to testify for the Ministry of Education against left @-@ wing historian Saburo Ienaga who believed that his textbook was being censored by the Japanese government . Hata has supported the work of the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform , despite noting that the textbook which the Society had authored " was colored more strongly by nationalism than others " . 
 In 2007 Hata was vocal in his denunciation of an essay written by Toshio <unk> , a former general in the Japanese Air Self @-@ Defense Force , which sought to justify Japanese imperialism . Hata found <unk> 's essay to be " of extremely low quality " and full of " old conspiracy theories " . Because of his scholarship on the Nanking Massacre Hata has been attacked by Nanking Massacre deniers such as Masaaki Tanaka , who said that Hata was infected with " IMTFE syndrome " , and Shōichi Watanabe . 
 In 1990 Hata argued that the recently released monologue of Emperor Hirohito , the former Emperor 's recollection of wartime Japan which he recorded shortly after World War II , had likely been created to prove to the United States that he was not involved in war crimes and consequently Hata theorized that an English language translation must have also been drawn up at the same time , a theory which was mocked by right @-@ wing scholars who felt the monologue was created as a simple historical record without ulterior motives . In 1997 the English language draft was discovered .
