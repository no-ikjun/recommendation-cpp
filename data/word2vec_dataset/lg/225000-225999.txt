 In mid @-@ 1988 , Airbus engineers led by Jean Roeder began work in secret on the development of an ultra @-@ high @-@ capacity airliner ( <unk> ) , both to complete its own range of products and to break the dominance that Boeing had enjoyed in this market segment since the early 1970s with its 747 . McDonnell Douglas unsuccessfully offered its smaller , double @-@ deck MD @-@ 12 concept for sale . Roeder was given approval for further evaluations of the <unk> after a formal presentation to the President and CEO in June 1990 . The megaproject was announced at the 1990 Farnborough Air Show , with the stated goal of 15 % lower operating costs than the 747 @-@ 400 . Airbus organised four teams of designers , one from each of its partners ( Aérospatiale , British Aerospace , Deutsche Aerospace AG , CASA ) to propose new technologies for its future aircraft designs . The designs were presented in 1992 and the most competitive designs were used . 
 In January 1993 , Boeing and several companies in the Airbus consortium started a joint feasibility study of a Very Large Commercial Transport ( VLCT ) , aiming to form a partnership to share the limited market . This joint study was abandoned two years later , Boeing 's interest having declined because analysts thought that such a product was unlikely to cover the projected $ 15 billion development cost . Despite the fact that only two airlines had expressed public interest in purchasing such a plane , Airbus was already pursuing its own large plane project . Analysts suggested that Boeing would instead pursue stretching its 747 design , and that air travel was already moving away from the hub and spoke system that consolidated traffic into large planes , and toward more non @-@ stop routes that could be served by smaller planes . 
 In June 1994 , Airbus announced its plan to develop its own very large airliner , designated the A3XX . Airbus considered several designs , including an unusual side @-@ by @-@ side combination of two fuselages from its A340 , the largest Airbus jet at the time . The A3XX was pitted against the VLCT study and Boeing 's own New Large Aircraft successor to the 747 . From 1997 to 2000 , as the East Asian financial crisis darkened the market outlook , Airbus refined its design , targeting a 15 – 20 % reduction in operating costs over the existing Boeing 747 @-@ 400 . The A3XX design converged on a double @-@ decker layout that provided more passenger volume than a traditional single @-@ deck design , in line with traditional hub @-@ and @-@ spoke theory as opposed to the point @-@ to @-@ point theory with the Boeing 777 , after conducting an extensive market analysis with over 200 focus groups . Although early marketing of the huge cross @-@ section touted the possibility of duty @-@ free shops , restaurant @-@ like dining , gyms , casinos & beauty parlours on board , the realities of airline economics have kept such dreams grounded . 
 On 19 December 2000 , the supervisory board of newly restructured Airbus voted to launch an € 8 @.@ 8 @-@ billion programme to build the A3XX , re @-@ christened as the A380 , with 50 firm orders from six launch customers . The A380 designation was a break from previous Airbus families , which had progressed sequentially from A300 to A340 . It was chosen because the number 8 resembles the double @-@ deck cross section , and is a lucky number in some Asian countries where the aircraft was being marketed . The aircraft configuration was finalised in early 2001 , and manufacturing of the first A380 wing box component started on 23 January 2002 . The development cost of the A380 had grown to € 11 @-@ 14 billion when the first aircraft was completed . 
 = = = Production = = = 
 Major structural sections of the A380 are built in France , Germany , Spain , and the United Kingdom . Due to the sections ' large size , traditional transportation methods proved infeasible , so they are brought to the Jean @-@ Luc <unk> Plant assembly hall in Toulouse , France , by specialised surface transportation , though some parts are moved by the A300 @-@ <unk> Beluga transport aircraft , which is also used in the movement of other Airbus model components . A380 components are provided by suppliers from around the world ; the four largest contributors , by value , are Rolls @-@ Royce , Safran , United Technologies and General Electric . 
 For the surface movement of large A380 structural components , a complex route known as the <unk> à Grand <unk> was developed . This involved the construction of a fleet of roll @-@ on / roll @-@ off ( RORO ) ships and barges , the construction of port facilities and the development of new and modified roads to accommodate oversized road convoys . The front and rear fuselage sections are shipped on one of three RORO ships from Hamburg in northern Germany to the United Kingdom . The wings are manufactured at Broughton in North Wales , then transported by barge to Mostyn docks for ship transport . 
 In Saint @-@ Nazaire in western France , the ship exchanges the fuselage sections from Hamburg for larger , assembled sections , some of which include the nose . The ship unloads in Bordeaux . The ship then picks up the belly and tail sections from Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA in Cádiz in southern Spain , and delivers them to Bordeaux . From there , the A380 parts are transported by barge to Langon , and by oversize road convoys to the assembly hall in Toulouse . In order to avoid damage from direct handling , parts are secured in custom jigs carried on self @-@ powered wheeled vehicles . 
 After assembly , the aircraft are flown to Hamburg <unk> Airport ( <unk> ) to be furnished and painted . Airbus sized the production facilities and supply chain for a production rate of four A380s per month . 
 = = = Testing = = = 
 Five A380s were built for testing and demonstration purposes . The first A380 , registered F @-@ <unk> , was unveiled in Toulouse 18 January 2005 . It first flew on 27 April 2005 . This plane , equipped with Rolls @-@ Royce Trent 900 engines , flew from Toulouse Blagnac International Airport with a crew of six headed by chief test pilot Jacques Rosay . Rosay said flying the A380 had been " like handling a bicycle " . 
 On 1 December 2005 , the A380 achieved its maximum design speed of Mach 0 @.@ 96 , ( its design cruise speed is Mach 0 @.@ 85 ) in a shallow dive . In 2006 , the A380 flew its first high @-@ altitude test at Bole International Airport , Addis Ababa . It conducted its second high @-@ altitude test at the same airport in 2009 . On 10 January 2006 , it flew to José María Córdova International Airport in Colombia , accomplishing the transatlantic testing , and then it went to El Dorado International Airport to test the engine operation in high @-@ altitude airports . It arrived in North America on 6 February 2006 , landing in Iqaluit , Nunavut in Canada for cold @-@ weather testing . 
 On 14 February 2006 , during the destructive wing strength certification test on <unk> , the test wing of the A380 failed at 145 % of the limit load , short of the required 150 % level . Airbus announced modifications adding 30 kg ( 66 lb ) to the wing to provide the required strength . On 26 March 2006 , the A380 underwent evacuation certification in Hamburg . With 8 of the 16 exits arbitrarily blocked , 853 mixed passengers and 20 crew exited the darkened aircraft in 78 seconds , less than the 90 seconds required for certification . Three days later , the A380 received European Aviation Safety Agency ( EASA ) and United States Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) approval to carry up to 853 passengers . 
 The first A380 using <unk> engines — serial number <unk> and registration F @-@ <unk> — flew on 25 August 2006 . On 4 September 2006 , the first full passenger @-@ carrying flight test took place . The aircraft flew from Toulouse with 474 Airbus employees on board , in a test of passenger facilities and comfort . In November 2006 , a further series of route @-@ proving flights demonstrated the aircraft 's performance for 150 flight hours under typical airline operating conditions . As of 2014 , the A380 test aircraft continue to perform test procedures . 
 Airbus obtained type certificates for the A380 @-@ 841 and A380 @-@ 842 model from the EASA and FAA on 12 December 2006 in a joint ceremony at the company 's French headquarters , receiving the ICAO code <unk> . The A380 @-@ 861 model obtained its type certificate on 14 December 2007 . 
 = = = Production and delivery delays = = = 
 Initial production of the A380 was troubled by delays attributed to the 530 km ( 330 mi ) of wiring in each aircraft . Airbus cited as underlying causes the complexity of the cabin wiring ( 98 @,@ 000 wires and 40 @,@ 000 connectors ) , its concurrent design and production , the high degree of customisation for each airline , and failures of configuration management and change control . The German and Spanish Airbus facilities continued to use CATIA version 4 , while British and French sites migrated to version 5 . This caused overall configuration management problems , at least in part because wire harnesses manufactured using aluminium rather than copper conductors necessitated special design rules including non @-@ standard dimensions and bend radii ; these were not easily transferred between versions of the software . 
 Airbus announced the first delay in June 2005 and notified airlines that deliveries would be delayed by six months . This reduced the total number of planned deliveries by the end of 2009 from about 120 to 90 – 100 . On 13 June 2006 , Airbus announced a second delay , with the delivery schedule slipping an additional six to seven months . Although the first delivery was still planned before the end of 2006 , deliveries in 2007 would drop to only 9 aircraft , and deliveries by the end of 2009 would be cut to 70 – 80 aircraft . The announcement caused a 26 % drop in the share price of Airbus ' parent , EADS , and led to the departure of EADS CEO Noël <unk> , Airbus CEO Gustav Humbert , and A380 programme manager Charles Champion . On 3 October 2006 , upon completion of a review of the A380 program , Airbus CEO Christian <unk> announced a third delay , pushing the first delivery to October 2007 , to be followed by 13 deliveries in 2008 , 25 in 2009 , and the full production rate of 45 aircraft per year in 2010 . The delay also increased the earnings shortfall projected by Airbus through 2010 to € 4 @.@ 8 billion . 
 As Airbus prioritised the work on the A380 @-@ 800 over the A380F , freighter orders were cancelled by FedEx and UPS , or converted to A380 @-@ 800 by Emirates and ILFC . Airbus suspended work on the freighter version , but said it remained on offer , albeit without a service entry date . For the passenger version Airbus negotiated a revised delivery schedule and compensation with the 13 customers , all of which retained their orders with some placing subsequent orders , including Emirates , Singapore Airlines , Qantas , Air France , Qatar Airways , and Korean Air . 
 On 13 May 2008 , Airbus announced reduced deliveries for the years 2008 ( 12 ) and 2009 ( 21 ) . After further manufacturing setbacks , Airbus announced its plan to deliver 14 A380s in 2009 , down from the previously revised target of 18 . A total of 10 A380s were delivered in 2009 . In 2010 Airbus delivered 18 of the expected 20 A380s , due to Rolls @-@ Royce engine availability problems . Airbus planned to deliver " between 20 and 25 " A380s in 2011 before ramping up to three a month in 2012 . In fact , Airbus delivered 26 units , thus outdoing its predicted output for the first time . As of July 2012 , production was 3 aircraft per month . Among the production problems are challenging interiors , interiors being installed sequentially rather than concurrently as in smaller planes , and union / government objections to streamlining . 
 At the July 2016 Farnborough Airshow Airbus announced that in a “ prudent , proactive step , ” starting in 2018 it expects to deliver 12 A380 aircraft per year , down from 27 deliveries in 2015 . The firm also warned production might slip back into red ink on each aircraft produced at that time , though it anticipates production will remain in the black for 2016 and 2017 . “ The company will continue to improve the efficiency of its industrial system to achieve <unk> at 20 aircraft in 2017 and targets additional cost reduction initiatives to lower <unk> further . ” Airbus expects that healthy demand for its other aircraft would allow it to avoid job losses from the cuts .

 Nicknamed <unk> , the first A380 , <unk> , ( registered as 9V @-@ SKA ) was delivered to Singapore Airlines on 15 October 2007 and entered service on 25 October 2007 with flight number <unk> between Singapore and Sydney . Passengers bought seats in a charity online auction paying between $ 560 and $ 100 @,@ 380 . Two months later , Singapore Airlines CEO Chew <unk> Seng stated the A380 was performing better than either the airline and Airbus had anticipated , burning 20 % less fuel per seat @-@ mile than the airline 's 747 @-@ 400 fleet . Emirates ' Tim Clark claimed that the A380 has better fuel economy at Mach 0 @.@ 86 than at 0 @.@ 83 , and that its technical dispatch reliability is at 97 % , same as Singapore Airlines . Airbus is committed to reach the industry standard of 98 @.@ 5 % . 
 Emirates was the second airline to receive the A380 and commenced service between Dubai and New York in August 2008 . Qantas followed , with flights between Melbourne and Los Angeles in October 2008 . By the end of 2008 , 890 @,@ 000 passengers had flown on 2 @,@ 200 flights . 
 In February 2009 , the one millionth passenger was flown with Singapore Airlines and by May of that year 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 passengers had flown on 4 @,@ 200 flights . Air France received its first A380 in October 2009 . Lufthansa received its first A380 in May 2010 . By July 2010 , the 31 A380s then in service had transported 6 million passengers on 17 @,@ 000 flights between 20 international destinations . 
 Airbus delivered the 100th A380 on 14 March 2013 to Malaysia Airlines . In June 2014 , over 65 million passengers had flown the A380 , and more than 100 million passengers ( averaging 375 per flight ) by September 2015 , with an availability of 98 @.@ 5 % . In 2014 , Emirates stated that their A380 fleet had load factors of 90 @-@ 100 % , and that the popularity of the aircraft with its passengers had not decreased in the past year .

 During repairs following the Qantas Flight 32 engine failure incident , cracks were discovered in wing fittings . As a result , the European Aviation Safety Agency issued an Airworthiness Directive in January 2012 which affected 20 A380 aircraft that had accumulated over 1 @,@ 300 flights . A380s with under 1 @,@ 800 flight hours were to be inspected within 6 weeks or 84 flights ; aircraft with over 1 @,@ 800 flight hours were to be examined within four days or 14 flights . Fittings found to be cracked were replaced . On 8 February 2012 , the checks were extended to cover all 68 A380 aircraft in operation . The problem is considered to be minor and is not expected to affect operations . EADS acknowledged that the cost of repairs would be over $ 130 million , to be borne by Airbus . The company said the problem was traced to stress and material used for the fittings . Additionally , major airlines are seeking compensation from Airbus for revenue lost as a result of the cracks and subsequent grounding of fleets . Airbus has switched to a different type of aluminium alloy so aircraft delivered from 2014 onwards should not have this issue . 
 Airbus is changing about 10 % of all doors , as some leak during flight . One occurrence resulted in dropped oxygen masks and an emergency landing . The switch is expected to cost over € 100 million . Airbus states that safety is sufficient , as the air pressure pushes the door into the frame . 
 = = Design = = 
 = = = Overview = = = 
 The A380 was initially offered in two models , the A380 @-@ 800 and the A380F . The A380 @-@ 800 's original configuration carried 555 passengers in a three @-@ class configuration or 853 passengers ( 538 on the main deck and 315 on the upper deck ) in a single @-@ class economy configuration . Then in May 2007 , Airbus began marketing a configuration with 30 fewer passengers , ( 525 total in three classes ) , traded for 200 nmi ( 370 km ) more range , to better reflect trends in premium class accommodation . The design range for the − 800 model is 8 @,@ 500 nmi ( 15 @,@ 700 km ) ; capable of flying from Hong Kong to New York or from Sydney to Istanbul non @-@ stop . The second model , the A380F freighter , would carry 150 tonnes of cargo with a range of 5 @,@ 600 nmi ( 10 @,@ 400 km ) . The freighter development was put on hold as Airbus prioritised the passenger version and all cargo orders were cancelled . Future variants may include an A380 @-@ 900 stretch seating about 656 passengers ( or up to 960 passengers in an all economy configuration ) and an extended @-@ range version with the same passenger capacity as the A380 @-@ 800 . 
 = = = Engines = = = 
 The A380 is available with two types of turbofan engines , the Rolls @-@ Royce Trent 900 ( variants A380 @-@ 841 , − 842 and − <unk> ) or the Engine Alliance GP7000 ( A380 @-@ 861 and − <unk> ) . The Trent 900 is a derivative of the Trent 800 , and the GP7000 has roots from the GE90 and PW4000 . The Trent 900 core is a scaled version of the Trent 500 , but incorporates the swept fan technology of the stillborn Trent 8104 . The <unk> has a GE90 @-@ derived core and <unk> @-@ derived fan and low @-@ pressure turbo @-@ machinery . Noise reduction was an important requirement in the A380 design , and particularly affects engine design . Both engine types allow the aircraft to achieve well under the QC / 2 departure and QC / 0 @.@ 5 arrival noise limits under the Quota Count system set by London Heathrow Airport , which is a key destination for the A380 . The A380 has received an award for its reduced noise . However , field measurements suggest the approach quota allocation for the A380 may be overly generous compared to the older Boeing 747 , but still quieter . Rolls @-@ Royce is supporting CAA in understanding the relatively high A380 / Trent 900 monitored noise levels . 
 The A380 was initially planned without thrust reversers , incorporating sufficient braking capacity to do without them . However Airbus elected to equip the two inboard engines with thrust reversers in a late stage of development , helping the brakes when the runway is slippery . The two outboard engines do not have reversers , reducing the amount of debris stirred up during landing . The A380 has electrically actuated thrust reversers , giving them better reliability than their pneumatic or hydraulic equivalents , in addition to saving weight . 
 In 2008 , the A380 demonstrated the viability of a synthetic fuel comprising standard jet fuel with a natural @-@ gas @-@ derived component . On 1 February 2008 , a three @-@ hour test flight operated between Britain and France , with one of the A380 's four engines using a mix of 60 % standard jet kerosene and 40 % gas to liquids ( GTL ) fuel supplied by Shell . The aircraft needed no modifications for the GTL fuel , which was designed to be mixed with normal jet fuel . Sebastien Remy , head of Airbus SAS 's alternative fuel programme , said the GTL used was no cleaner in CO2 terms than standard fuel but contains no sulphur , generating air quality benefits . 
 The auxiliary power comprises the Auxiliary Power Unit ( APU ) , the electronic control box ( ECB ) , and mounting hardware . The APU in use on the A380 is the PW <unk> APU . The APU primarily provides air to power the Analysis Ground Station ( AGS ) on the ground and to start the engines . The AGS is a semi @-@ automatic analysis system of flight data that helps to optimise management of maintenance and reduce costs . The APU also powers electric generators which provide auxiliary electric power to the aircraft . 
 = = = Wings = = = 
 The A380 's wing is sized for a maximum takeoff weight ( MTOW ) over 650 tonnes to accommodate these future versions , albeit with some internal strengthening required on the A380F freighter . The optimal wingspan for this weight is about 90 m ( 300 ft ) , but airport restrictions limited it to less than 80 m ( 260 ft ) , lowering aspect ratio to 7 @.@ 8 which reduces fuel efficiency about 10 % and increases operating costs a few percent , given that fuel costs constitute about 50 % of the cost of long @-@ haul airplane operation . The common wing design approach sacrifices fuel efficiency ( due to a weight penalty ) on the A380 @-@ 800 passenger model , but Airbus estimates that the aircraft 's size , coupled with the uses of advanced technology , will provide lower operating costs per passenger than the 747 @-@ 400 and older 747 variants . The A380 also includes wingtip devices similar to those found on the A310 and A320 to reduce induced drag , thereby increasing fuel efficiency and range . 
 = = = Materials = = = 
 While most of the fuselage is aluminium , composite materials comprise more than 20 % of the A380 's airframe . Carbon @-@ fibre reinforced plastic , glass @-@ fibre reinforced plastic and quartz @-@ fibre reinforced plastic are used extensively in wings , fuselage sections ( such as the undercarriage and rear end of fuselage ) , tail surfaces , and doors . The A380 is the first commercial airliner to have a central wing box made of carbon fibre reinforced plastic . It is also the first to have a smoothly contoured wing cross section . The wings of other commercial airliners are partitioned span @-@ wise into sections . This flowing , continuous cross section optimises aerodynamic efficiency . Thermoplastics are used in the leading edges of the slats . The hybrid fibre metal laminate material GLARE ( glass laminate aluminium reinforced epoxy ) is used in the upper fuselage and on the stabilisers ' leading edges . This aluminium @-@ glass @-@ fibre laminate is lighter and has better corrosion and impact resistance than conventional aluminium alloys used in aviation . Unlike earlier composite materials , GLARE can be repaired using conventional aluminium repair techniques . The application of GLARE on the A380 has a long history , which shows the complex nature of innovations in the aircraft industry . 
 Newer weldable aluminium alloys are also used . This enables the widespread use of laser beam welding manufacturing techniques , eliminating rows of rivets and resulting in a lighter , stronger structure . High @-@ strength aluminium ( type <unk> ) reinforced with carbon fibre was used in the wing brackets of the first 120 A380s to reduce weight , but cracks have been discovered and new sets of the more critical brackets will be made of standard aluminium <unk> , increasing weight by 90 kg ( 198 lb ) . Repair costs for earlier aircraft are expected to be around € 500 million ( US $ 629 million ) . 
 It takes 3 @,@ 600 L ( 950 US gal ) of paint to cover the 3 @,@ 100 m2 ( 33 @,@ 000 sq ft ) exterior of an A380 . The paint is five layers thick and weighs about 650 kg ( 1 @,@ 433 lb ) . 
 = = = Avionics = = = 
 The A380 employs an integrated modular avionics ( IMA ) architecture , first used in advanced military aircraft , such as the Lockheed Martin F @-@ 22 Raptor , Lockheed Martin F @-@ 35 Lightning II , and Dassault Rafale . The main IMA systems on the A380 were developed by the Thales Group . Designed and developed by Airbus , Thales and Diehl Aerospace , the IMA suite was first used on the A380 . The suite is a technological innovation , with networked computing modules to support different applications . The data networks use Avionics Full @-@ Duplex Switched Ethernet , an implementation of <unk> 664 . These are switched , full @-@ duplex , star @-@ topology and based on <unk> fast @-@ Ethernet . This reduces the amount of wiring required and minimises latency . 
 Airbus used similar cockpit layout , procedures and handling characteristics to other Airbus aircraft , reducing crew training costs . The A380 has an improved glass cockpit , using fly @-@ by @-@ wire flight controls linked to side @-@ sticks . The cockpit has eight 15 by 20 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 by 7 @.@ 9 in ) liquid crystal displays , all physically identical and interchangeable ; comprising two primary flight displays , two navigation displays , one engine parameter display , one system display and two multi @-@ function displays . The MFDs were introduced on the A380 to provide an easy @-@ to @-@ use interface to the flight management system — replacing three multifunction control and display units . They include QWERTY keyboards and <unk> , interfacing with a graphical " point @-@ and @-@ click " display system . 
 The Network Systems Server ( NSS ) is the heart of A380 's paperless cockpit ; it eliminates bulky manuals and charts traditionally used . The NSS has enough inbuilt robustness to eliminate onboard backup paper documents . The A380 's network and server system stores data and offers electronic documentation , providing a required equipment list , navigation charts , performance calculations , and an aircraft logbook . This is accessed through the MFDs and controlled via the keyboard interface . 
 Power @-@ by @-@ wire flight control actuators have been used for the first time in civil aviation to back up primary hydraulic actuators . Also , during certain manoeuvres they augment the primary actuators . They have self @-@ contained hydraulic and electrical power supplies . Electro @-@ hydrostatic actuators ( <unk> ) are used in the aileron and elevator , electric and hydraulic motors to drive the slats as well as electrical backup hydrostatic actuators ( <unk> ) for the rudder and some spoilers . 
 The A380 's 350 bar ( 35 MPa or 5 @,@ 000 psi ) hydraulic system is a significant difference from the typical 210 bar ( 21 MPa or 3 @,@ 000 psi ) hydraulics used on most commercial aircraft since the 1940s . First used in military aircraft , high @-@ pressure hydraulics reduce the weight and size of pipelines , actuators and related components . The 350 bar pressure is generated by eight de @-@ <unk> hydraulic pumps . The hydraulic lines are typically made from titanium ; the system features both <unk> and air @-@ cooled heat exchangers . Self @-@ contained electrically powered hydraulic power packs serve as backups for the primary systems , instead of a secondary hydraulic system , saving weight and reducing maintenance . 
 The A380 uses four 150 kVA variable @-@ frequency electrical generators , eliminating constant @-@ speed drives and improving reliability . The A380 uses aluminium power cables instead of copper for weight reduction . The electrical power system is fully computerised and many <unk> and breakers have been replaced by solid @-@ state devices for better performance and increased reliability .

 The cabin has features to reduce traveller fatigue such as a quieter interior and higher pressurisation than previous generation of aircraft ; the A380 is pressurised to the equivalent altitude of 1 @,@ 520 m ( 5 @,@ 000 ft ) up to 12 @,@ 000 m ( 39 @,@ 000 ft ) . It has 50 % less cabin noise , 50 % more cabin area and volume , larger windows , bigger overhead bins , and 60 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 ft ) extra headroom versus the 747 @-@ 400 . Seating options range from 3 @-@ room 12 m2 ( 130 sq ft ) " residence " in first class to 11 @-@ across in economy . On other aircraft , economy seats range from 41 @.@ 5 cm ( 16 @.@ 3 in ) to 52 @.@ 3 cm ( 20 @.@ 6 in ) in width , A380 economy seats are up to 48 cm ( 19 in ) wide in a 10 @-@ abreast configuration ; compared with the 10 @-@ abreast configuration on the 747 @-@ 400 which typically has seats 44 @.@ 5 cm ( 17 @.@ 5 in ) wide . 
 The A380 's upper and lower decks are connected by two stairways , fore and aft , wide enough to accommodate two passengers side @-@ by @-@ side ; this cabin arrangement allows multiple seat configurations . The maximum certified carrying capacity is 853 passengers in an all @-@ economy @-@ class layout , Airbus lists the " typical " three @-@ class layout as accommodating 525 passengers , with 10 first , 76 business , and 439 economy class seats . Airline configurations range from Korean Air 's 407 passengers to Emirates ' two @-@ class 615 seats for Copenhagen , and average around 480 – 490 seats . The Air Austral 's proposed 840 passenger layout has not come to fruition . The A380 's interior illumination system uses <unk> LEDs in the cabin , cockpit , and cargo decks . The LEDs in the cabin can be altered to create an ambience simulating daylight , night , or intermediate levels . On the outside of the aircraft , HID lighting is used for brighter illumination . 
 Airbus 's publicity has stressed the comfort and space of the A380 cabin , and advertised onboard relaxation areas such as bars , beauty salons , duty @-@ free shops , and restaurants . Proposed amenities resembled those installed on earlier airliners , particularly 1970s wide @-@ body jets , which largely gave way to regular seats for more passenger capacity . Airbus has acknowledged that some cabin proposals were unlikely to be installed , and that it was ultimately the airlines ' decision how to configure the interior . Industry analysts suggested that implementing customisation has slowed the production speeds , and raised costs . Due to delivery delays , Singapore Airlines and Air France debuted their seat designs on different aircraft prior to the A380 . 
 Initial operators typically configured their A380s for three @-@ class service , while adding extra features for passengers in premium cabins . Launch customer Singapore Airlines introduced partly enclosed first class suites on its A380s in 2007 , each featuring a leather seat with a separate bed ; center suites could be joined to create a double bed . A year later , Qantas debuted a new first class seat @-@ bed and a sofa lounge at the front of the upper deck on its A380s , and in 2009 Air France unveiled an upper deck electronic art gallery . In late 2008 , Emirates introduced " shower spas " in first class on its A380s allowing each first class passenger five minutes of hot water , drawing on 2 @.@ 5 tonnes of water although only 60 % of it was used . Emirates , Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways also have a bar lounge and seating area on the upper deck , while Etihad has enclosed areas for two people each . In addition to lounge areas , some A380 operators have installed amenities consistent with other aircraft in their respective fleets , including self @-@ serve snack bars , premium economy sections , and redesigned business class seating . The Hamburg Aircraft Interiors Expo in April 2015 saw the presentation of an 11 @-@ seat row economy cabin for the A380 . Airbus is reacting to a changing economy ; the recession which began in 2008 saw a drop in market percentage of first class and business seats to six percent and an increase in budget economy travelers . Among other causes is the reluctance of employers to pay for executives to travel in First or Business Class . Airbus ' chief of cabin marketing , Ingo <unk> , told Aviation Week and Space Technology that the standard three class cabin no longer reflected market conditions . The 11 seat row on the A380 is accompanied by similar options on other <unk> : nine across on the Airbus A330 and ten across on the A350 .

 In the 1990s , aircraft manufacturers were planning to introduce larger planes than the Boeing 747 . In a common effort of the International Civil Aviation Organization , ICAO , with manufacturers , airports and its member agencies , the " 80 @-@ metre box " was created , the airport gates allowing planes up to 80 m ( 260 ft ) wingspan and length to be accommodated . Airbus designed the A380 according to these guidelines , and to operate safely on Group V runways and taxiways with a 60 metres ( 200 ft ) loadbearing width . The US FAA initially opposed this , then in July 2007 , the FAA and EASA agreed to let the A380 operate on 45 m ( 148 ft ) runways without restrictions . The A380 @-@ 800 is approximately 30 % larger in overall size than the 747 @-@ 400 . Runway lighting and signage may need changes to provide clearance to the wings and avoid blast damage from the engines . Runways , runway shoulders and taxiway shoulders may be required to be stabilised to reduce the likelihood of foreign object damage caused to ( or by ) the outboard engines , which are more than 25 m ( 82 ft ) from the centre line of the aircraft , compared to 21 m ( 69 ft ) for the 747 @-@ 400 , and 747 @-@ 8 . 
 Airbus measured pavement loads using a 540 @-@ tonne ( 595 short tons ) ballasted test rig , designed to replicate the landing gear of the A380 . The rig was towed over a section of pavement at Airbus ' facilities that had been instrumented with embedded load sensors . It was determined that the pavement of most runways will not need to be reinforced despite the higher weight , as it is distributed on more wheels than in other passenger aircraft with a total of 22 wheels ( that is , its ground pressure is lower ) . The A380 undercarriage consists of four main landing gear legs and one <unk> ( a similar layout to the 747 ) , with the two inboard landing gear legs each supporting six wheels . 
 The A380 requires service vehicles with lifts capable of reaching the upper deck , as well as tractors capable of handling the A380 's maximum ramp weight . When using two jetway bridges the boarding time is 45 min , and when using an extra jetway to the upper deck it is reduced to 34 min . The A380 has an airport turnaround time of 90 – 110 minutes . In 2008 the A380 test aircraft were used to trial the modifications made to several airports to accommodate the type . 
 = = = = Takeoff and landing separation = = = = 
 In 2005 , the ICAO recommended that provisional separation criteria for the A380 on takeoff and landing be substantially greater than for the 747 because preliminary flight test data suggested a stronger wake turbulence . These criteria were in effect while the ICAO 's wake vortex steering group , with representatives from the JAA , <unk> , the FAA , and Airbus , refined its 3 @-@ year study of the issue with additional flight testing . In September 2006 , the working group presented its first conclusions to the ICAO . 
 In November 2006 , the ICAO issued new interim recommendations . Replacing a blanket 10 nautical miles ( 19 km ) separation for aircraft trailing an A380 during approach , the new distances were 6 nmi ( 11 km ) , 8 nmi ( 15 km ) and 10 nmi ( 19 km ) respectively for non @-@ A380 " Heavy " , " Medium " , and " Light " ICAO aircraft categories . These compared with the 4 nmi ( 7 @.@ 4 km ) , 5 nmi ( 9 @.@ 3 km ) and 6 nmi ( 11 km ) spacing applicable to other " Heavy " aircraft . Another A380 following an A380 should maintain a separation of 4 nmi ( 7 @.@ 4 km ) . On departure behind an A380 , non @-@ A380 " Heavy " aircraft are required to wait two minutes , and " Medium " / " Light " aircraft three minutes for time based operations . The ICAO also recommends that pilots append the term " Super " to the aircraft 's callsign when initiating communication with air traffic control , to distinguish the A380 from " Heavy " aircraft . 
 In August 2008 , the ICAO issued revised approach separations of 4 nmi ( 7 @.@ 4 km ) for Super ( another A380 ) , 6 nmi ( 11 km ) for Heavy , 7 nmi ( 13 km ) for medium / small , and 8 nmi ( 15 km ) for light . In November 2008 , an incident on a parallel runway during crosswinds made the Australian authorities change procedures for those conditions . 
 For takeoff , " Light " and " Medium " aircraft must wait 3 minutes behind an A380 takeoff , compared to the standard 2 minutes for takeoffs behind other aircraft types . 
 Singapore Airlines describe the A380 's landing speed of 130 – 135 kn ( 240 – 250 km / h ) as " impressively slow " . 
 = = = = Maintenance = = = = 
 As the A380 fleet grows older , airworthiness authority rules require certain scheduled inspections from approved aircraft tool shops . The increasing fleet size ( to about 286 in 2020 ) cause expected maintenance and modification to cost $ 6 @.@ 8 billion for 2015 @-@ 2020 , of which $ 2 @.@ 1 billion are for engines . Emirates performed its first 3C @-@ check for 55 days in 2014 . During lengthy shop stays , some airlines will use the opportunity to install new interiors .

 = = = Improved A380 @-@ 800 = = = 
 In 2010 , Airbus announced a new A380 build standard , incorporating a strengthened airframe structure and a 1 @.@ 5 ° increase in wing twist . Airbus will also offer , as an option , an improved maximum take @-@ off weight , thus providing a better payload / range performance . Maximum take @-@ off weight is increased by 4 t ( 8 @,@ 800 lb ) , to 573 t ( 1 @,@ 263 @,@ 000 lb ) and the range is extended by 100 nautical miles ( 190 km ) ; this is achieved by reducing flight loads , partly from optimising the fly @-@ by @-@ wire control laws . British Airways and Emirates are the first two customers to have received this new option in 2013 . Emirates has asked for an update with new engines for the A380 to be competitive with the 777X around 2020 , and Airbus is studying 11 @-@ abreast seating . 
 In 2012 Airbus announced another increase in the A380 's maximum take @-@ off weight to 575 t ( 1 @,@ 268 @,@ 000 lb ) , a 6 t hike on the initial A380 variant and 2 t higher than the increased @-@ weight proposal of 2010 . It will stretch the range by some 150 nautical miles ( 280 km ) , taking its capability to around 8 @,@ 350 nautical miles ( 15 @,@ 460 km ) at current payloads . The higher @-@ weight version was offered for introduction to service early in 2013 . 
 = = = A380 @-@ 900 = = = 
 In November 2007 Airbus top sales executive and chief operating officer John Leahy confirmed plans for an enlarged variant , the A380 @-@ 900 , with more seating space than the A380 @-@ 800 . This version would have a seating capacity for 650 passengers in standard configuration , and approximately 900 passengers in an economy @-@ only configuration . Airlines that had expressed an interest in the − 900 included Emirates , Virgin Atlantic , Cathay Pacific , Air France , KLM , Lufthansa , Kingfisher Airlines , and leasing company ILFC . In May 2010 , Airbus announced that A380 @-@ 900 development was postponed , until production of the A380 @-@ 800 stabilises . 
 On 11 December 2014 at the annual Airbus Investor Day forum Airbus CEO controversially announced that " We will one day launch an A380neo and one day launch a stretched A380 " following speculation sparked by Airbus CFO Harald Wilhelm that Airbus could axe the A380 ahead of its time due to softening demand . On 15 June 2015 , John Leahy , Airbus 's chief operating officer for customers , stated Airbus was looking at the A380 @-@ 900 programme again . Airbus 's newest concept is a stretch of the A380 @-@ 800 offering 50 seats more , not 100 as originally envisaged . The stretch would be tied to a potential re @-@ engining of the A380 @-@ 800 . According to <unk> , an A380 @-@ 900 would make better use of the A380 's existing wing . 
 = = = A380neo = = = 
 On 19 July 2015 , Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier stated that the company will build a new version of the A380 featuring new improved wings and new engines . Speculation about the development of a so @-@ called A380neo ( neo for new engine option ) had been going on for a few months after earlier press releases in 2014 , and in 2015 the company was considering whether to end production of the type prior to 2018 or develop a new A380 variant . Later it was revealed that Airbus was looking at both the possibility of a longer A380 in line of the previously planned A380 @-@ 900 and a new engine version , i.e. A380neo . It was also revealed by Brégier that the new variant would be ready to enter service by 2020 . The engine would most likely be one of a variety of all @-@ new options from Rolls @-@ Royce , ranging from derivatives of the A350 's XWB @-@ 84 / 97 to the future Advance project due at around 2020 . 
 On 3 June 2016 , Emirates President Tim Clark stated that talks between Emirates and Airbus on the A380neo have " lapsed " . 
 = = = A380F = = = 
 Airbus originally accepted orders for the freighter version , offering the largest payload capacity of any cargo aircraft in production , exceeded only by the single Antonov An @-@ 225 <unk> in service . An aerospace consultant has estimated that the A380F would have 7 % better payload and better range than the 747 @-@ 8F , but also higher trip costs . However , production has been suspended until the A380 production lines have settled with no firm availability date . In 2015 Airbus removed A380F from the range of freighters on the corporate website . 
 = = Market = = 
 In 2006 , industry analysts Philip Lawrence of the Aerospace Research Centre in Bristol and Richard Aboulafia of the consulting Teal Group in Fairfax anticipated 880 and 400 A380 sales respectively by 2025 , whereas Airbus and Boeing estimate 1 @,@ 700 and 700 VLA ( very large aircraft ; those with more than 400 seats ) , respectively . According to Lawrence , parallel to the design of the A380 , Airbus conducted the most extensive and thorough market analysis of commercial aviation ever undertaken , justifying its VLA plans , while according to Aboulafia , the rise of mid @-@ size aircraft and market fragmentation reduced VLAs to niche market status , making such plans unjustified . The two analysts ' market forecasts differed in the incorporation of spoke @-@ hub and point @-@ to @-@ point models . The difference was illustrated in 2014 when British Airways replaced three <unk> flights between London and Los Angeles with two A380 , per day . 
 In contrast , the airline strategy of frequency ( offering multiple flights between the same two cities at different times of day ) typically relies on smaller aircraft . United Airlines told Reuters that it follows this strategy because it offers business travelers more choices . Moreover , United 's Chief Financial Officer observed that the airline 's Boeing 787 Dreamliners operate at a lower trip cost than the A380 . Hence , the A380 " just doesn 't really work for us . " Operators Air France and China Southern have found that the A380 's capacity is too large for some markets ; China Southern has faced mounting losses on A380 operations out of its Guangzhou hub , although Emirates ' Tim Clark sees a large potential for Asian A380 @-@ users , and criticised Airbus ' marketing efforts . In 2013 , Air France withdrew A380 services to Singapore and Montreal and switched to smaller aircraft . 
 In 2007 , Airbus estimated a demand for 1 @,@ 283 passenger planes in the VLA category for the next 20 years if airport congestion remains at the current level . According to this estimate , demand could reach up to 1 @,@ 771 VLAs if congestion increases . Most of this demand will be due to the urbanisation and rapid economic growth in Asia . The A380 will be used on relatively few routes , between the most saturated airports ; 15 of the world 's 20 biggest airports are saturated . Airbus also estimates a demand for 415 freighters in the category 120 @-@ tonne plus . Boeing , which offers the only competition in that class , the 747 @-@ 8 , estimates the demand for passenger VLAs at 590 and that for freighter VLAs at 370 for the period 2007 – 2026 . 
 At one time the A380 was considered as a potential replacement for the existing Boeing VC @-@ 25 serving as Air Force One , but in January 2009 EADS declared that they were not going to bid for the contract , as assembling only three planes in the US would not make financial sense . 
 The break @-@ even for the A380 was initially supposed to be reached by selling 270 units , but due to the delays and the falling exchange rate of the US dollar , it increased to 420 units . In 2010 , EADS CFO Hans Peter Ring said that break @-@ even ( on the aircraft that are delivered ) could be achieved by 2015 , despite the delays ; there should be around 200 deliveries by that time , on current projections . In 2012 , Airbus clarified that in 2015 , production costs to build the aircraft would be less than the sales price . As of March 2010 the average list price of an A380 was US $ 375 @.@ 3 million ( about € 261 million or £ 229 million ) , depending on equipment installed . As of July 2012 this list price was US $ 390 million , but negotiated discounts made the actual prices much lower , and industry experts questioned whether the A380 project would ever pay for itself . 
 On 11 December 2014 , after slower than expected orders for the aircraft in 2014 , Harald Wilhelm , the company 's Chief Finance Officer , voiced the possibility to end the program in 2018 . His statement was met by protests from customers and a fall in share prices . Airbus responded to the protests by playing down the possibility the A380 would be abandoned , instead emphasizing that enhancing the airplane was a likelier scenario . On 22 December 2014 , CEO Fabrice Brégier ruled out that the cancellation of the A380 program , stating that it will break even in 2015 but also that the A380 was introduced a decade too early . While no longer losing money on each plane sold , Airbus admits that the company will never recoup the $ 25 billion investment it made in the project . 
 As of mid @-@ 2015 , several airlines have expressed their interest in selling their aircraft , partially coinciding with expiring lease contracts for the aircraft . Several A380 which are in service have been offered for lease to other airlines . The suggestion has prompted concerns on the potential for new sales for Airbus , although these were dismissed by Airbus COO John Leahy stated that " Used A380s do not compete with new A380s " , stating that the second @-@ hand market is more interesting for parties otherwise looking to buy smaller aircraft such as the Boeing 777 . 
 On 15 June 2015 , Reuters reported that Airbus was discussing a stretched version of the A380 with a half dozen customers . This aircraft , which could also feature new engines , would accommodate an additional fifty passengers . Were this " A380neo " to be built , it would be delivered to customers sometime in 2020 or 2021 . On 9 July 2015 , Business Insider reported that Airbus had filed a patent application for an A380 " combi " which would offer the flexibility of not only carrying both passengers and cargo , but being rapidly reconfigurable to expand or contract the cargo area and passenger area as needed for a given flight . 
 An A380 's hourly cost is about $ 26 @,@ 000 , or around $ 50 per seat hour , which compares to $ 44 per seat hour for a Boeing 777 @-@ 300ER , and $ 90 per seat hour for a Boeing 747 @-@ 400 as of November 2015 . 
 = = Orders and deliveries = = 
 Nineteen customers have ordered the A380 . Total orders for the A380 stand at 319 as of May 2016 . The biggest customer is Emirates , which has ordered or committed to order a total of 142 A380s as of 31 May 2016 . One VIP order was made in 2007 but later cancelled by Airbus . The A380F version totalled 27 orders before they were either cancelled ( 20 ) or converted to A380 @-@ 800 ( 7 ) , following the production delay and the subsequent suspension of the freighter programme . 
 Delivery takes place in Hamburg for customers from Europe and the Middle East and in Toulouse for customers from the rest of the world . EADS explained that deliveries in 2013 were to be slowed temporarily to accommodate replacement of the wing rib brackets where cracks were detected earlier in the existing fleet . 
 In hopes of raising the number of orders placed , Airbus announced ' <unk> discounts ' to airlines who placed large orders for the A380 . Emirates soon after , ordered 50 aircraft , totalling $ 20 @.@ 75 billion . Airbus gave a $ 2 @.@ 75 billion total discount , equal to $ 55 million in savings per aircraft for Emirates . 
 Airbus says that some A380s may not be delivered to customers or even built . This decision came when Airbus had not met the ' Accord and Satisfaction ' for three already built aircraft for an undisclosed Japanese airline . " Without referring to any specific airline , I can assure you that we have cases where airlines are in the order backlog but not in the production plan , " chief executive officer Tom Enders said in August 2014 during a conference call to discuss earnings with Bloomberg . " We are watching the situation carefully , and know about the strengths and weaknesses of customers . " Among customers that have ordered <unk> yet remain undecided about actually taking them is Virgin Atlantic , with six units on the order book . Qantas had also planned to top up its existing fleet by as many as eight airplanes , an expansion that has been thrown into doubt amid a cost @-@ cutting drive . Amedeo , an aircraft lessor that ordered 20 A380s , has yet to find a single client for the jet .

 On 4 November 2010 , Qantas Flight 32 , en route from Singapore Changi Airport to Sydney Airport , suffered an uncontained engine failure , resulting in a series of related problems , and forcing the flight to return to Singapore . There were no injuries to the passengers , crew or people on the ground despite debris falling onto the Indonesian island of Batam . The A380 was damaged sufficiently for the event to be classified as an accident .

A380s powered by Engine Alliance GP7000 were unaffected but operators of Rolls @-@ Royce Trent 900 @-@ powered A380s were affected .

 " City Girl " is a song by the Irish alternative rock musician Kevin Shields . It is the second track from the soundtrack to the 2003 film Lost in Translation and was released as a standalone single in June 2003 . Recorded during summer 2002 with Lost in Translation 's music co @-@ ordinator Brian Reitzell , " City Girl " was among the first original material released by Shields since My Bloody Valentine 's second studio album , Loveless ( 1991 ) — on which he was the main composer , musician and producer . 
 Produced by Shields , " City Girl " has been described as a mid @-@ tempo garage @-@ influenced alternative rock song and since its original release , critics have drawn comparisons between it and songs from Loveless . An accompanying music video for " City Girl " was directed by Sofia Coppola , the director of Lost in Translation . " City Girl " was well received upon its release , and its inclusion on the Lost in Translation soundtrack , and earned Shields nominations for a number of awards ; these include a British Academy of Film and Television Arts ( BAFTA ) award for Best Film Music , an Irish Film and Television Academy ( IFTA ) award for Best Music in a Film and an Online Film Critics Society award for Best Original Score . 
 = = Origin and recording = = 
 " City Girl " is one of four songs Kevin Shields composed for Sofia Coppola 's 2003 film , Lost in Translation . Shields became involved with the film 's original score after being contacted by the film 's music co @-@ ordinator Brian Reitzell in Tokyo , Japan . Reitzell and Shields began impromptu jam sessions in London , United Kingdom during summer 2002 , where Shields composed " City Girl " . The duo " adopted a late @-@ night recording schedule " that consisted of them recording between midnight " and seven in the morning " . According to Shields , " it was [ their ] productive time . It 's basically as though the world 's disappeared . " 
 Describing the song 's origins in an interview with National Public Radio ( NPR ) , Shields said that the writing and recording of " City Girl " was " very simple , in the sense that it was just me teaching Brian the chord structure and Brian just jamming along to it . " The duo recorded an instrumental rehearsal version of the song , after which Shields said there was " no point in rerecording it . " He later wrote lyrics and recorded vocals for the song but emphasised that there was no need for " elaborations [ or ] overdubs . " Shields described this method of recording as a " slapdash approach " , noting that there was no " point in labouring over something … because you don 't know what 's going to work " . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 " City Girl " has been described as " mid @-@ tempo , with an unusual repeating melody and a two @-@ note chorus .

" Rolling Stone noted that the song — and other tracks Shields contributed to the Lost in Translation soundtrack — feature " My Bloody Valentine 's ethereal sensibility , but they are more fragile in their construction , without Shields ' furious sheets of guitar . " 
 Shields has referred to " City Girl " ' s composition as " average and vulnerable " and said of the lyrics : " It 's kind corny words , like ' I love you ' and ' you 're beautiful ' and the kind of corny , simple things that people tend to think when they actually get infatuated with somebody . " According to Rolling Stone , the song 's lyrics " aptly reflects the quiet nature of the film " and Shields has said that both he and Reitzell were " under the influence of the film " while Shields composed the song . 
 = = Music video = = 
 The music video for " City Girl " was directed by Lost in Translation director Sofia Coppola . The video was filmed in Tokyo , Japan — where Lost in Translation is based — and features the use of handheld cameras , production techniques such as jump cuts , and " blurry visuals " of the city . Coppola used footage from Lost in Translation that was not included in the final cut alongside selected sequences from the film to create the video . 
 Critic Geoff King said that the " City Girl " music video , like others Coppola directed around the same time period , " offer little else to go on for an auteurist account . " He noted the contrast between Coppola 's direction and overall quality in the " City Girl " video and her music video for " I Just Don 't Know What to Do with Myself " by The White Stripes , which was released the same year . The music video for " City Girl " was included as a bonus feature on the Lost in Translation DVD , released on 3 February 2004 . A high definition version of the video was later included as a bonus feature on the Blu @-@ ray release of the film , released on 7 December 2010 . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 " City Girl " was released as a one @-@ track promotional CD single in June 2003 on the Australian independent record label , Inertia . It was later released in the United States as a split 7 " single with The Jesus and Mary Chain song " Just Like Honey " , which was also featured on the Lost in Translation soundtrack . The split single was a limited edition release and pressed on yellow and clear vinyl . " City Girl " was later included as the second track on the Lost in Translation soundtrack , released in August 2003 on V2 Records , alongside three other songs Shields composed for the film : " Goodbye " , " <unk> " and " Are You Awake ? " 
 Upon its release , " City Girl " received moderate critical acclaim . Pitchfork Media writer Mark Richardson said that " on first listen it sounds like a demo of a pre @-@ Loveless track , possibly from the You Made Me Realise era " and while there was " no exploration on that front … the melody and voice are familiar and welcome . " Writing for Stylus Magazine , Andrew Unterberger called " City Girl " " a worthy opener " and added that " [ the song is ] where Kevin 's at right now — making pretty pop songs . There is so little to this song that it 's almost enough to make you think Kevin 's lost his mind . " Unterberger summarised the song as " gorgeous , and definitely has that sighing quality to it that makes the film so delectable . " Exclaim ! journalist Michael White noted that it was " the indisputable highlight of the soundtrack " and AllMusic 's Heather Phares described " City Girl " as an " open @-@ ended piece " and " naïve [ and ] guitar @-@ driven " but added that it did not compare to Shields ' compositions on Loveless ( 1991 ) . 
 " City Girl " was among the material that earned Shields nominations for a British Academy of Film and Television Arts ( BAFTA ) award for Best Film Music , an Irish Film and Television Academy ( IFTA ) award for Best Music in a Film , and an Online Film Critics Society award for Best Original Score in 2003 .

Annenberg was married to Walter Annenberg , who was an Ambassador to the United Kingdom and newspaper publishing magnate . She also served as the chairman and president of the Annenberg Foundation from 2002 until 2009 . 
 Born in New York City and raised in Los Angeles , she graduated from Stanford University . After her first two marriages ended in divorce , she married noted businessman Walter Annenberg , who was appointed U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1969 under President Richard Nixon . In her role as the ambassador 's wife , Leonore directed a major renovation of the ambassador 's official residence . The Annenbergs contributed to Ronald Reagan 's 1980 presidential campaign and upon his inauguration , Leonore was named Chief of Protocol , placing her in charge of advising the president , vice president , and Secretary of State on matters relating to diplomatic protocol . 
 The Annenbergs became major philanthropists , donating money to education facilities , charitable causes , and the arts . Leonore served on many committees and boards as well . After her husband 's death in 2002 , she continued to donate money and succeeded him as chairman and president of the Annenberg Foundation .

 = Sideshow Bob 's Last Gleaming = 
 " Sideshow Bob 's Last Gleaming " is the ninth episode of The Simpsons ' seventh season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 26 , 1995 . In the episode , Sideshow Bob becomes disturbed when he hears the other inmates laughing at the inane antics of Krusty the Clown 's television show and decides to rid the world of television . He escapes while on work duty at a local Air Force Base , which is being cleaned for an annual air show . He steals a 10 @-@ megaton nuclear weapon and threatens to detonate it unless Springfield gives in to his demand to shut down all television broadcasts . 
 The episode , the fifth of the series to feature Sideshow Bob , was written by freelance writer Spike Feresten . Although he received credit for the episode , the writing staff completely rewrote the episode and very little of Feresten 's original script was left in the finished version . It was the first episode of The Simpsons to be directed by Dominic Polcino , who described it as being very difficult to direct . R. Lee Ermey , known for his role in Full Metal Jacket , guest stars as Col. Leslie " Hap " Hapablap while Kelsey Grammer reprises his role as Sideshow Bob . 
 The episode is a parody of " ' 60s @-@ era nuclear war movies " and contains several references to Cold War films including Twilight 's Last Gleaming , Dr. Strangelove and Fail @-@ Safe . In its original broadcast , the episode finished 49th in ratings for the week of November 20 – 26 , 1995 , with a Nielsen rating of 8 @.@ 7 and a 13 % share of the audience . 
 = = Plot = = 
 While watching The Krusty the Clown Show , Homer asks what happened to Sideshow Bob , Krusty 's former sidekick . Bart and Lisa remind their father of Bob 's attempts to frame Krusty , kill Selma , rig an election and kill Bart. Meanwhile , at Springfield Minimum Security Prison , Sideshow Bob is disturbed when he hears the other inmates laughing at the inane antics of Krusty 's television show . He believes that television is a fountain of " mindless drivel " and wants to rid the world of it . Bob hatches a plan and escapes while on work duty at a local Air Force Base , which is being cleaned for an annual air show . He impersonates Air Force colonel Leslie " Hap " Hapablap in order to gain access to a restricted area of the hangar , where he finds a 10 @-@ megaton nuclear weapon . 
 The air show begins , with the Simpson family in attendance , but the signal on the big screen is interrupted by Bob . Bob announces that life would be better without television and so he threatens to detonate the nuclear bomb unless Springfield gives in to his demand to shut down all television broadcasts . Upon hearing the announcement , everyone flees the airfield in panic except for Bart and Lisa , who get separated from their parents during the crowd 's mad rush to evacuate . National Guardsmen frantically search the base for Sideshow Bob to no avail . All out of options , Mayor Quimby decides to give in to Bob 's ultimatum — despite Krusty the Clown 's objections . In accordance with Bob 's demands , television transmitters are destroyed and studios hastily plan farewell programs . Bob , who was televising his demands from a stolen Duff Blimp , celebrates the success of his plan . 
 Krusty , refusing to submit to Bob 's demands , takes refuge in a civil defense shed in the desert . He uses the emergency broadcast system to transmit a heavily improvised show . Bob finds out about this and becomes outraged . Bart and Lisa find their way into the cockpit of the Duff Blimp , where Bob , having lost his patience thanks to Krusty , tries to detonate the bomb . However , the bomb turns out to be a dud ( there was a label inside the bomb saying " Best Before November 1959 " ) and does not blow up . The police eventually find Bob , thanks to Lisa , who uses the controls inside the blimp to print a message on its electronic ticker outside . When Chief Wiggum tries to arrest Bob , Bob deflates the blimp and kidnaps Bart. Bob steals the original Wright Brothers aircraft , which had been an exhibit at the air show . He then reveals to Bart that he plans to start out a kamikaze attack into the civil defense shed where Krusty is hiding . However , the plane ends up merely bouncing harmlessly off the shack . The authorities quickly arrest Bob and take him into custody while Bart is reunited with his family .

 Sideshow Bob 's Last Gleaming " was the fifth episode of The Simpsons to feature Sideshow Bob after " Krusty Gets Busted " , " Black Widower " , " Cape Feare " and " Sideshow Bob Roberts " . Executive producers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein believed that every season of the show should contain an episode featuring Bob . However , Bob had already been in four episodes and the writers were having a difficult time coming up with new ways to include him . The first draft of the episode was written by Spike Feresten , a freelance writer who later became known for his work on Seinfeld . Although he received credit for the episode , the writing staff completely rewrote the episode and very little of Feresten 's original script was left in the episode . Oakley describes the episode as " one of the most arduous rewrites in the history of the show " because much of the dialogue had to be re @-@ written . 
 " Sideshow Bob 's Last Gleaming " was the first episode of The Simpsons directed by Dominic Polcino . Polcino had worked as an assistant director on the show and had left the show but was offered a chance to be a director . He describes the episode as a " tough one to start with , " especially the scenes with the Wright Flyer . An early version of the script featured a longer scene at the air show that featured Hans Moleman flying an early flying machine . The scene where Milhouse is in a jet pretending to fire missiles at his parents because he 's upset with them , would later inspire the episode " A Milhouse Divided " . In that episode , Milhouse 's parents become divorced . 
 A character modelled after Fox Network owner Rupert Murdoch briefly appears in a scene set in jail . The censors said that Murdoch could not be shown but Rupert Murdoch himself gave his permission for his caricature to be used . R. Lee Ermey , known for his role in Full Metal Jacket , guest stars as Col. Leslie " Hap " Hapablap . The role was specifically written for him and much of his dialogue was difficult to write . The line " What is your major malfunction ? " is based on dialogue from Full Metal Jacket .

 The episode is a parody of " ' 60s @-@ era nuclear war movies " and contains several references to Cold War films . There were also several references to Dr. Strangelove : the underground compound resembles the War Room from the film ; Professor Frink was redesigned to parody the title character ; The tune that Sideshow Bob whistles while preparing the bomb is " We 'll Meet Again , " as sung by Vera Lynn at the end of the film ; and Krusty 's acting whilst he defends television is based on George C. Scott 's performance as General Buck <unk> . The appearance of the stereotypical grey alien found in Hangar 18 is a reference to the Megadeth song of the same name . 
 Another parodied film is the 1964 thriller Fail @-@ Safe by Sidney Lumet : at the beginning of the third act of the episode , we see scenes of everyday life across Springfield , and one by one , with a " zooming " sound effect , they all freeze @-@ frame in anticipation of the ( supposedly ) imminent nuclear blast ; such was the ending of Fail @-@ Safe . One of the scenes before the supposed nuclear blast shows Maggie picking flowers in a field , with the camera zooming into her eye , and then the minuscule blast occurs . This is a parody of the infamous and controversial Daisy ad used by Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 United States presidential election . 
 The inmate who argues with Sideshow Bob about tabloids and network television has the likeness and Australian accent of Rupert Murdoch .

Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be when Milhouse was playing in the fighter jet at the air show . The website concluded its review by giving the episode a grade of B − . 
 = Epaulette shark = 
 The epaulette shark ( Hemiscyllium ocellatum ) is a species of <unk> carpet shark , family <unk> , found in shallow , tropical waters off Australia and New Guinea ( and possibly elsewhere ) . The common name of this shark comes from the very large , white @-@ margined black spot behind each pectoral fin , which are reminiscent of military epaulettes . A small species usually under 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) long , the epaulette shark has a slender body with a short head and broad , paddle @-@ shaped paired fins . The caudal peduncle ( to which the tail fin is attached ) comprises over half the shark 's length . Adults are light brown above , with scattered darker spots and indistinct saddles . 
 Epaulette sharks have nocturnal habits and frequent shallow water on coral reefs or in tidal pools . This shark has evolved to cope with the severe night time oxygen depletion ( hypoxia ) in isolated tidal pools by increasing the blood supply to its brain and selectively shutting down non @-@ essential neural functions . It is capable of surviving complete anoxia for an hour without ill effects , and at a much higher temperature than most other hypoxia @-@ tolerant animals . Rather than swim , epaulette sharks often " walk " by wriggling their bodies and pushing with their paired fins . This species feeds on a wide range of small benthic invertebrates and bony fishes . Epaulette sharks are oviparous , with females depositing pairs of egg capsules around every 14 days from August to December . Due to their hardiness and small size , epaulette sharks are popular with both public and home aquaria . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed this species as of Least Concern , as outside of the small aquarium trade it is of little interest to fisheries . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The epaulette shark was originally described as Squalus ocellatus by the French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in the 1788 Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique des trois règnes de la nature . The name was later changed to the currently valid Hemiscyllium ocellatum . The type specimen was a 35 cm ( 14 in ) long immature male caught near Cooktown , Queensland , Australia . Other common names for this species are the <unk> shark and the blind shark ( also used for <unk> <unk> ) . Goto 's 2002 morphological analysis of the carpet sharks showed the genus Hemiscyllium as a polytomy , meaning that the phylogenetic relationships between the epaulette shark and its sister species could not be resolved . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The range of the epaulette shark extends from the southern coast of New Guinea to the northern coast of Australia , as far south as Sydney . The Capricorn @-@ Bunker Group of the Great Barrier Reef contains a particularly large population , with thousands estimated to inhabit the reefs around Heron Island alone . Additionally , there are unsubstantiated reports of this species from Malaysia , Sumatra , and the Solomon Islands . Epaulette sharks are found in shallow water to a maximum depth of 50 m ( 160 ft ) , and are often seen in water barely deep enough to cover their bodies . They prefer tidal pools , coral flats , and stands of staghorn coral . 
 = = Description = = 
 The epaulette shark has an elongated body , over half of which is comprised by the slender caudal peduncle . The snout is short and rounded , with the nares placed almost at the tip along with a pair of tiny barbels ; there are grooves running from the nares to the mouth . There are 26 – 35 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 21 – 32 tooth rows in the lower jaw . The teeth are small , with broad bases and triangular cusps . The eyes are oval in shape and elevated , with a large spiracle below each . The five pairs of gill slits are small , with the fourth and fifth very close together . 
 The pectoral and pelvic fins are broad and rounded and are thickly muscled . The two similarly @-@ sized dorsal fins are placed well back on the body . The anal fin is low and positioned just in front of the caudal fin . The caudal fin has only an upper lobe , which contains a prominent ventral notch near the tip and is angled almost horizontally relative to the body . Adult epaulette sharks are beige to brownish above with many widely spaced brown spots and subtle darker bands . There is a very large black spot ringed in white located behind each pectoral fin ; this pair of spots are the origin of this shark 's common name . Juveniles have alternating light and dark bands over their body and fins , which break up as they mature . Epaulette sharks are typically 70 – 90 cm ( 27 – 35 in ) long ; the maximum reported length is 107 cm ( 42 in ) . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 As an adaptation for navigating its complex reef environment , the epaulette shark moves by seemingly walking , bending its body from side @-@ to @-@ side and pushing off of the substrate with its paddle @-@ shaped pectoral and pelvic fins . Its gait is similar to that of salamanders , an example of convergent evolution . The shark is capable of swimming , but often prefers to walk along the sandy or coral bottom even when the water is deep enough to allow it to swim freely . The cartilaginous supports of the epaulette shark 's paired fins are reduced and separated when compared to other sharks , allowing them to be rotated for use as limbs . This mode of locomotion even enables the shark to crawl out of the water to access isolated tidal pools . The gait of the epaulette shark is convergently similar to those of tetrapods such as salamanders , suggesting that the movements needed for walking on land may predate , and facilitated the evolution of , the first terrestrial vertebrates . Epaulette sharks are largely nocturnal and are most active in low water . They often hide inside or below coral heads , though it is enough for the head to be covered even if the rest of the body is exposed . Sometimes they perch in the open on sandy flats or atop reefs facing into the current , a form of orientation known as <unk> that may improve respiration or predator awareness . 
 Epaulette sharks are preyed upon by larger fishes such as other sharks . Its coloration provides protective camouflage , while its epaulette is speculated to be an eyespot for distracting or deterring predators . Epaulette sharks are almost all parasitized by the praniza ( parasitic ) larval stage of <unk> isopods . The larvae feed on blood and mostly attach to the skin around the cloaca and the claspers , though they are also found inside the mouth and on the gills . These parasites cause little damage and are not believed to adversely affect the health of the shark . Other parasites of this species include a species of myxosporean in the genus Kudoa , which infests the skeletal muscles , the <unk> protozoan <unk> <unk> , which infects the blood , the ostracod <unk> <unk> , which attaches to the gills , and the nematode Proleptus australis , which infests the stomach . 
 = = = <unk> tolerance = = = 
 At night , the shallow reef platforms inhabited by the epaulette shark often become isolated from the ocean by the receding tide . The amount of dissolved oxygen in the pool can drop 80 % or more overnight from the combined respiration of all the organisms within the pool . The epaulette shark has evolved to cope with these hypoxic conditions , being able to survive for over three hours in 5 % of the atmospheric O2 level without losing behavioral responsiveness . In the laboratory , epaulette sharks have survived for an hour without any oxygen at 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) , which is also unusual in that most animals capable of tolerating oxygen deprivation do so at low temperatures . 
 The physiological responses of the epaulette shark to low oxygen are mediated by the nucleoside adenosine . In hypoxic conditions , the heart and ventilation rates drop sharply . The shark 's blood pressure falls by half as the blood vessels dilate to deliver more blood to the brain and heart . Unlike in bony fishes and tetrapods , the blood flow rate remains constant and there is no elevation of blood glucose levels . The brains of sharks only consume a third as much ATP as those of teleosts . The epaulette shark is able to lower this energy demand further by reducing the metabolism of certain areas of its brain , e.g. keeping the sensory nuclei functional while deactivating the motor nuclei . This allows the shark to supply enough ATP to prevent neuron death , while still remaining alert to its environment . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The epaulette shark is an opportunistic predator of benthic crustaceans , worms , and small bony fish . Off Heron Island , over 90 % of the epaulette shark 's diet consists of polychaete worms and crabs , with juveniles taking mostly the former and adults mostly the latter . It hunts most actively at dawn and dusk , though feeding can occur at any time during the day . This shark relies mainly on its olfactory and electroreceptive senses to locate hidden prey . It is capable of sucking prey into its mouth by expanding its muscular buccal cavity . While searching for food , the epaulette shark sometimes turns over debris with its snout or thrusts its head into the sand , swallowing food items while expelling the sand grains through its gill slits . Unlike most sharks , the epaulette shark may chew its food for up to 5 – 10 minutes . Its teeth can be depressed to form a flat surface for crushing hard @-@ shelled prey . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 Mating in the epaulette shark takes place from July to December , though in captivity reproduction occurs continuously . Courtship may be initiated by the female following and biting the male . The male then holds onto the pectoral fin of the female with his mouth and lies alongside her , while inserting one of his claspers into her cloaca . Copulation lasts about one and a half minutes . Epaulette sharks readily breed in aquariums , even in tanks as small as 135 gallons , but larger tanks are recommended to allow room for the hatched offspring . This species is oviparous , with females depositing eggs from August to December . The female drops the egg capsules two ( rarely four ) at a time every 14 days , producing a total of 20 – 50 eggs per year . Each egg case measures 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) long and 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) wide . The young emerge after 120 – 130 days , at a length of 14 – 16 cm ( 5 @.@ 5 – 6 @.@ 3 in ) . The growth rate of the young is slow at first but increases to about 5 cm ( 2 in ) per year after three months . Both males and females mature sexually at a length of 54 – 64 cm ( 21 – 25 in ) , corresponding to an age of at least seven years . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 Epaulette sharks are harmless to humans , though if handled they may nip their captors . They are easily observed and handled by beachgoers as they move slowly whilst out of water , and show little fear of humans ; the shark is often injured by these encounters . This species adapts readily to captivity and is displayed by many public aquariums in the United States , Canada , and Australia . In an article for Aquarium Fish Magazine , Scott W. Michael referred to the epaulette shark as " the best shark for the home aquarium . " They will breed in captivity , even in tanks as small as 510 L ( 135 gal ) , though full @-@ grown sharks are best housed in tanks of 680 L ( 180 gal ) or more . They are not compatible with community tanks as they will eat other fish . 
 The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed the epaulette shark as of Least Concern . This species is common in Australian waters , where it is not captured by either commercial or recreational fisheries , and is minimally affected by collection for the aquarium trade and fishery bycatch . Much of its Australian habitat is encompassed by protected marine parks . Off New Guinea , the epaulette shark has been assessed as Near Threatened , as there it faces habitat degradation , destructive fishing practices , and over @-@ exploitation by artisan fishers . 
 In 2015 , the behaviour of an Epaulette shark was filmed in detail by the BBC for the first episode of a new documentary series named Shark , released around the 40th anniversary of Jaws . The documentary shows an Epaulette shark 's ability to walk over land , and its hunting behaviours in the ebbing tide . 
 = Renewable energy in Iceland = 
 About 85 percent of total primary energy supply in Iceland is derived from domestically produced renewable energy sources . 
 In 2011 , geothermal energy provided about 65 percent of primary energy , the share of hydropower was 20 percent , and the share of fossil fuels ( mainly oil products for the transport sector ) was 15 percent . In 2013 , Iceland also became a producer of wind energy . 
 The main use of geothermal energy is for space heating with the heat being distributed to buildings through extensive district @-@ heating systems . About 85 % of all houses in Iceland are heated with geothermal energy . 
 Renewable energy provides almost 100 percent of electricity production , with about 75 percent coming from hydropower and 25 percent from geothermal power . Most of the hydropower plants are owned by Landsvirkjun ( the National Power Company ) which is the main supplier of electricity in Iceland . In 2011 , the total electricity consumption in Iceland was 17 @,@ 210 GWh . 
 Iceland is the world ’ s largest green energy producer per capita and largest electricity producer per capita . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Iceland 's unique geology allows it to produce renewable energy relatively cheaply , from a variety of sources . Iceland is located on the Mid @-@ Atlantic Ridge , which makes it one of the most tectonically active places in the world . There are over 200 volcanoes located in Iceland and over 600 hot springs . There are over 20 high @-@ temperature steam fields that are at least 150 ° C [ 300 ° F ] ; many of them reach temperatures of 250 ° C. This is what allows Iceland to harness geothermal energy and these steam fields are used for everything from heating houses to heating swimming pools . Hydropower is harnessed through glacial rivers and waterfalls , which are both plentiful in Iceland . 
 = = Hydropower = = 
 The first hydropower plant was built in 1904 by a local entrepreneur . It was located in a small town outside of Reykjavík and produced 9 kW of power . The first municipal hydroelectric plant was built in 1921 , and it could produce 1 MW of power . This plant single @-@ handedly quadrupled the amount of electricity in the country . The 1950s marked the next evolution in hydroelectric plants . Two plants were built on the <unk> River , one in 1953 which produced 31 MW , and the other in 1959 which produced 26 @.@ 4 MW . These two plants were the first built for industrial purposes and they were co @-@ owned by the Icelandic government . This process continued in 1965 when the national power company , Landsvirkjun , was founded . It was owned by both the Icelandic government and the municipality of Reykjavík . In 1969 , they built a 210 MW plant on the <unk> River that would supply the southeastern area of Iceland with electricity and run an aluminum smelting plant that could produce 33 @,@ 000 tons of aluminum a year . 
 This trend continued and increases in the production of hydroelectric power are directly related to industrial development . In 2005 , Landsvirkjun produced 7 @,@ 143 GWh of electricity total of which 6 @,@ 676 GWh or 93 % was produced via hydroelectric power plants . Additionally 5 @,@ 193 GWh or 72 % was used for power @-@ intensive industries like aluminum smelting . In 2009 Iceland built its biggest hydroelectric project to date , a 690 MW hydroelectric plant to provide energy for another aluminum smelter — the <unk> Hydropower Plant . This project was opposed strongly by environmentalists . 
 Other hydroelectric power stations in Iceland include : <unk> ( 150 MW ) , <unk> ( 270 MW ) , <unk> ( 210 MW ) , <unk> ( 28 MW ) , <unk> ( 150 MW ) , <unk> ( 89 MW ) , <unk> ( 120 MW ) , and <unk> ( 90 MW ) . 
 Iceland is the first country in the world to create an economy generated through industries fueled by renewable energy , and there is still a large amount of untapped hydroelectric energy in Iceland . In 2002 it was estimated that Iceland only generated 17 % of the total <unk> hydroelectric energy in the country . Iceland ’ s government believes another 30 TWh of hydropower every year could be produced , whilst taking into account the sources that must remain untapped for environmental reasons . 
 = = Geothermal power = = 
 For centuries , the people of Iceland have used their hot springs for bathing and washing clothes . The first use of geothermal energy for heating did not come until 1907 when a farmer ran a concrete pipe from a hot spring that led steam into his house . In 1930 , the first pipeline was constructed in Reykjavík , and was used to heat two schools , 60 homes , and the main hospital . It was a 3 km pipeline that ran from one of the hot springs outside the city . In 1943 , the first district heating company was started with the use of geothermal power . An 18 km pipeline ran through the city of Reykjavík and by 1945 it was connected to over 2 @,@ 850 homes . 
 Currently geothermal power heats 89 % of the houses in Iceland and over 54 % of the primary energy used in Iceland comes from geothermal sources . Geothermal power is used for many things in Iceland . 57 @.@ 4 % of the energy is used for space heat , 25 % is used for electricity , and the remaining amount is used in many miscellaneous areas : swimming pools , fish farms , and greenhouses , for example . 
 The government of Iceland has played a major role in the advancement of geothermal energy . In the 1940s , the State Electricity Authority was started by the government in order to increase the knowledge of geothermal resources and the utilization of geothermal power in Iceland . It was later changed to the National Energy Authority ( <unk> ) in 1967 . This agency has been very successful and has made it economically viable to use geothermal energy as a source for heating in many different areas throughout the country . Geothermal power has been so successful that the government no longer has to lead the research in this field because it has been taken over by the geothermal industries . 
 Geothermal power plants in Iceland include <unk> ( 120 MW ) , <unk> ( 100 MW ) , <unk> ( 303 MW ) , <unk> ( 60 MW ) , and <unk> ( 46 @.@ 5 MW ) power plants . The <unk> power plant and the <unk> power plant produce both electricity and hot @-@ water for heating purposes . The move from oil @-@ based heating to geothermal heating saved Iceland an estimated total of US $ 8 @.@ 2 billion from 1970 to 2000 and lowered the release of carbon dioxide emissions by 37 % . The equivalent amount of oil that would have been needed in 2003 to heat Iceland ’ s homes was 646 @,@ 000 tons . 
 The Icelandic government also believes that there are many more untapped geothermal sources throughout the country , estimating that over 20 TWh per year of unharnessed geothermal energy is available . This is about 3 @.@ 3 % of the <unk> per year of electricity used in Germany . Combined with the unharnessed feasible hydropower , tapping these sources to their full extent would provide Iceland another 50 TWh of energy per year , all from renewable sources . 
 Iceland 's abundant geothermal energy has also enabled renewable energy initiatives , such as Carbon Recycling International 's carbon dioxide to methanol fuel process , which could help reduce Iceland 's dependence on fossil fuels . 
 = = Solar power = = 
 Iceland has relatively low insolation , due to the latitude , about 20 % less than Paris , and half as much as Madrid , with very little in the winter . Unlike geothermal , solar power is a non @-@ dispatchable renewable energy source - the sun follows a predictable path but the weather is not controllable . This makes both wind power and solar power variable renewable energy ( VRE ) sources . Net metering credits electricity generated during the summer for use during the winter . If net metering nor local energy storage is not available , the largest array that is practical for a consumer to install is that which will generate less than or equal to the amount of electricity used during the sunniest month , a much smaller array . 
 = = Hydrogen = = 
 Currently , imported oil fulfils most of Iceland 's remaining energy needs . This cost has caused Iceland to focus on domestic , renewable energy . Bragi Arnason , a local professor , first proposed the idea of using hydrogen as a fuel source in Iceland during the 1970s , which is also when the oil crisis occurred . At that point in time this idea was considered untenable , but in 1999 Icelandic New Energy was established to govern the project of transitioning Iceland into the first hydrogen society by 2050 . This followed a decision in 1998 by the Icelandic Parliament to convert vehicle and fishing fleets to hydrogen produced from renewable energy . 
 Iceland provides an ideal location to test the viability of hydrogen as a fuel source for the future , since it is a small country of only 320 @,@ 000 people , with over 60 % living in the capital , Reykjavík . The relatively small scale of the infrastructure will make it easier to transition the country from oil to hydrogen . There is also a plentiful supply of natural energy that can be harnessed to produce hydrogen in a renewable way , making it perfect for hydrogen production . Iceland is a participant in international hydrogen fuel research and development programs , and many countries are following the nation 's progress with interest . However , these factors also make Iceland an advantageous market for electric vehicles . Because electric vehicles are four times more efficient , and less expensive than hydrogen vehicles , the country may switch to electric vehicles . 
 Iceland already converts its surplus electricity into exportable goods and hydrocarbon replacements . In 2002 it produced 2 @,@ 000 tons of hydrogen gas by electrolysis — primarily for the production of ammonia for fertilizer . 
 ECTOS demonstration project 
 The first step towards becoming a hydrogen society was the ECTOS demonstration project , which ran from 2001 until August 2005 and was very successful . ECTOS ( Ecological City <unk> System ) involved three hydrogen fuel cell buses and one fuel station . Many international companies contributed to the project including Daimler Chrysler , who made the hydrogen fuel cell buses , and Shell which produced the hydrogen fuel station . The European Commission 5th framework programme sponsored the project . 
 The first hydrogen fuel station in Iceland opened in 2003 in Reykjavík . To avoid transportation difficulties hydrogen is produced on site using electrolysis to break down water into hydrogen and oxygen . All of the energy used to produce the hydrogen comes from Iceland ’ s renewable energies and the full cycle of energy , from the water to the hydrogen in the fuel cells , emits no CO2 . 
 During the project the researchers studied the efficiency of using hydrogen as a fuel source . They examined the reliability of the fuel and effectiveness of hydrogen as a fuel in buses . They also studied the cost effectiveness of using hydrogen as a fuel source and how the process of introducing hydrogen into the country could be implemented . They examined specific areas like the ease of incorporating fuel stations and producing hydrogen , and the safety precautions involved with distributing and using hydrogen , a very explosive fuel . 
 <unk> : CUTE project 
 In January 2006 it was decided to continue testing the hydrogen buses as part of the <unk> : CUTE project , which spans 10 cities in Europe , China and Australia and which is sponsored by the European Commission 's 6th framework programme . This project studies the long @-@ term effects and most efficient ways of using hydrogen powered buses . The buses are run for longer periods of time and the durability of the fuel cell is compared to the combustion engine , which can theoretically last a lot longer . The project also compares the fuel efficiency of the original buses with new buses from different manufacturers that are supposed to be more fuel efficient . 
 The project ended in January 2007 , and as a result of the research an improved bus prototype is expected in 2008 . Details of further demonstrations involving private cars and a boat were expected in April 2007 . 
 Other projects 
 Iceland has also begun many other projects involving hydrogen . 
 The EURO @-@ <unk> project is investigating the feasibility of exporting hydrogen fuel to Europe . Options include transporting the gas through an undersea pipeline or by boat , or exporting electricity generated in Iceland through a submarine cable . 
 Another project to build a hydrogen @-@ powered H @-@ ship started in February 2004 and is looking at the practicalities of using hydrogen as a fuel for Iceland 's fishing fleet , one of the country 's main industries . The project will identify and try to remove barriers that may prevent marine vehicles from using hydrogen as a fuel , such as problems caused by water and salt . It will also try to identify and remedy weakness within the fuel cell to ensure the protection of marine life . The H @-@ ship project is a major step in the plan for Iceland to become the first country to phase out the use of fossil fuels . Government funding as well as private organizations such as the World Renewable Energy Congress are the primary sponsors of research in this sector . 
 From hydrogen to electricity 
 Electric cars with strategically located charging stations make a lot of sense for Iceland , where 75 percent of the country ’ s residents live within 37 miles of the capital city . Hydrogen cars are not expected to be mass @-@ produced anywhere in the world until at least 2015 , and with the first electric cars rolling off production lines in 2010 , it will be faster to introduce electric vehicles . Iceland 's 840 @-@ mile @-@ long ring road could theoretically be covered with just 14 fast @-@ charging stations .

 = 18th Engineer Brigade ( United States ) = 
 The 18th Engineer Brigade ( Theater Army ) is an engineer brigade of the United States Army . It is currently a subordinate unit of 21st Sustainment Command ( Theater ) and is headquartered at Conn Barracks in Schweinfurt , Germany . Soldiers of the 18th Engineer Brigade provide various supportive duties to other Army units , including construction , engineering , and mechanical work on other Army projects . 
 The brigade served in Europe during World War II , a fact which was included on its Distinctive Unit Insignia when the 20th Engineer Brigade received one on 10 February 1966 . The four corners of the crenelated square allude to their four campaigns in World War II , Normandy , Northern France , Rhineland and Central Europe . 
 The 18th Engineer Brigade later deployed to Vietnam , during the Vietnam War , where its battalions saw six years of combat service and supported fourteen campaigns , building infrastructure for both military and civilian projects . The brigade participated in a massive number of road construction projects and airfield constructions , supporting numerous infantry units and operating all over Vietnam . After serving in Vietnam , the brigade became attached to Seventh United States Army . It has since undertaken and completed numerous projects in support of US Army , Europe , and participated in Operation Desert Storm , Operation Enduring Freedom , and Operation Iraqi Freedom .

 The lineage of the 18th Engineer Brigade can be traced to 29 July 1921 , when its predecessor , the 347th Engineers ( General Service ) , was constituted as an Organized Reserves unit . The 347th Engineers would not be activated for almost twenty years , until the military buildup after the United States entered World War II . The unit was ordered into active military service on 6 May 1942 at Camp Claiborne , Louisiana . 
 On 1 August 1942 , the unit was reorganized and re @-@ designated as the 347th Engineer General Services Regiment . The Regiment deployed to England in February 1944 . It entered combat in France on 29 June 1944 and participated in the Normandy , Northern France , Rhineland and Central Europe campaigns of World War II , earning its first Meritorious Unit Commendation . After V @-@ E Day , the regiment remained on occupation duty in Germany until its inactivation on 1 June 1946 . 
 On 15 June 1947 , the regiment was reactivated in the organized reserves headquartered in Salt Lake , Utah , and remained there until it was again inactivated on 16 March 1949 . On 25 October 1954 , the 347th Engineer General Services Regiment was re @-@ designated the 18th Engineer Brigade for the first time and activated as a Regular Army unit at Fort Leonard Wood , Missouri , where it remained until inactivation on 26 March 1963 . 
 = = = Vietnam War = = = 
 The 18th Engineer Brigade was reactivated on 16 July 1965 at Fort Bragg , N.C. and prepared for deployment to Vietnam . The 18th Engineer Brigade entered Vietnam in September 1965 with the responsibility for overseeing all Army Engineering operations in Vietnam until the establishment of the U.S. Army Engineer Command , Vietnam , in late 1966 . 
 Under the command of Colonel C. Craig Cannon , the Brigade prepared for deployment to Vietnam . The Advance Party of the 18th Engineer Brigade arrived at Saigon 's Tan Son Nhut Air Base on 3 September 1965 . Three days later , Brigadier General Robert R. <unk> assumed command of the Brigade . Within two weeks , the Brigade Headquarters at Tan Son Nhut was fully operational . It had been preceded by the 35th Engineer Group , which built Cam Ranh Bay on a peninsula of sand and in a hostile environment . The brigade assumed responsibility for I Corps and II Corps in the northern part of South Vietnam . The <unk> Engineer Group ( Combat ) at Qui Nhơn was assigned to the Brigade in June 1966 . 
 Its initial activities centered around rapid development of the port facilities , ammunition dumps , base camps and airfields necessary to support the build @-@ up of US combat forces deploying to Vietnam . During the initial construction phases its combat engineer battalions also provided support for search and destroy missions and defensive operations with the 101st Airborne Division near Ninh Hoa and the 4th Infantry Division at Pleiku . 
 On 18 January 1969 , an ammunition storage area was completed at Cam Ranh Bay . It had taken two years to build this complex , which covered over 191 @,@ 700 square feet ( 17 @,@ 810 m2 ) . English Airfield was completed on 21 March 1969 near Qui Nhơn . The runway was 3 @,@ 600 feet ( 1 @,@ 100 m ) long , 60 feet ( 18 m ) wide , and included a 150 — foot by 150 — foot turn around area . 
 On 3 May 1969 , Brigadier General John W. Morris assumed command of the Brigade . Soon afterwards , Brigade engineers finished construction of a cold storage warehouse at the Qui Nhơn Support Command , the first of its kind in Vietnam . Construction of the Tandem Switch Building at Vung Chau Mountain was also completed about this time . This 4 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 370 m2 ) building housed almost US $ 1 million of communications equipment . During the summer months of 1969 , Brigade engineers completed the 200 @,@ 000 @-@ barrel ( 32 @,@ 000 m3 ) capacity Air Force tank farm at Cam Ranh Bay , after laying over 12 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 700 m ) of pipe to complete the project . 
 The beginning of 1970 saw the initiation of the 18th Engineers Brigade 's Operation Last Chance , a program of command emphasis and organization for motivation and success of that year 's engineer operations . The goals of the program were to maintain primary missions of the combat support as well as insure the completion of the many projects planned for the 1970 construction operations . 
 February 1970 saw the completion of a project begun in the summer of the previous year at Qui Nhơn that replaced a temporary floating steel dock with a more permanent structure which could accommodate six ammo barges at once . The port of Qui Nhơn became one of the few supply points where ammunition for the First and Second Military Regions could be handled in bulk quantities simultaneously . Prior to the completion of this new facility , the handling of ammunition there had to take place in other areas , near public housing and fuel storage depots . 
 On 3 May 1970 , Brigadier General Henry C. Schrader assumed command of the 18th Engineer Brigade . Shortly after this , the most difficult stretch of the roadway that the Brigade had ever undertaken — the 27 @-@ kilometer stretch of National Highway QL @-@ 11 South in the central highlands region known as Tây Nguyên , commonly referred to as the " Good View Pass " , was completed . This road had been carved out from a dangerous mountain pass to a national road in less than one year . 
 The Lines of Communication Program , which represents the most significant contribution that the 18th Engineer Brigade had made to the economic growth of Vietnam , consisted of about 1 @,@ 500 kilometers of road upgrade from 1967 to 1972 . After a slow start in the beginning of this work , the Brigade finished some 560 kilometers of highway reconstruction , and improvement in 1970 and another 450 kilometers were scheduled for completion in 1971 by Brigade units . 
 In conjunction with the Brigade efforts on the Lines of Communication Program , 18th Brigade engineers was involved in a program of affiliation with ARVN ( Army of the Republic of Vietnam ) engineers . In addition to continuous training programs which the Brigade established to train ARVN equipment operators , the engineers of the 18th provided technical assistance and logistical support to several projects undertaken by the Vietnamese Army , most notably in the construction of the 3 @,@ 600 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 100 m ) bridge at Tuy Hòa . Upon its completion and opening on 13 February 1971 , this bridge became the longest overpass of its type ever constructed in the Republic of Vietnam . It would be one of 77 such bridges that the Brigade would construct in the country . 
 In support of the XXIV Corps , the 18th Brigade mounted what was described as the " most ambitious engineering effort in Vietnam " at the end of January 1971 . The Brigade engineers pushed a roadway across the rugged terrain of the northern Quảng Trị Province to the Laotian border and constructed a 3 @,@ 200 @-@ foot ( 980 m ) by 60 @-@ foot ( 18 m ) airfield in little more than a month at Khe Sanh . This construction effort was part of Operation Dewey Canyon II . 
 On 20 September 1971 the Brigade was inactivated . Over the six years that it served in Vietnam , the 18th Engineer Brigade was involved in 14 of 17 campaigns , earning four Meritorious Unit Commendations .

 On 21 October 1977 the 18th Engineer Brigade was reactivated at Karlsruhe , Germany . For 15 years , the Brigade served as the principal construction brigade for the United States Army , Europe and 7th Army . During this period , the Brigade performed numerous construction , rehabilitation and renovation missions in military communities and training areas of the 7th Army . These included an extensive range upgrade of the <unk> Major Training Area in the early 1980s and the construction of the Range 23 complex at the <unk> Major Training Area in 1989 and 1990 . Additionally , the Brigade was responsible for providing topographic support to the European Theater . 
 In 1990 and 1991 , during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm , the 18th Engineer Brigade provided rail and sea deployment support to the VII Corps and , in addition , deployed a Combat Heavy Battalion and Topographic Company to support VII Corps operations in Southwest Asia . In April 1991 , the Brigade Headquarters , along with elements of the 94th Engineer Battalion ( Combat ) ( Heavy ) , deployed to Zakho , Iraq in support of Operation Provide Comfort . While there , the Brigade coordinated all engineer efforts of a Joint and Combined engineer force providing construction and relief support to the Kurdish refugees . The 18th Engineer Brigade was awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit Award for its action during Operation Provide Comfort . As part of the reduction of forces in Europe , the Brigade was inactivated on 15 October 1992 .

Russell issued a memorandum to all soldiers that " preventable accidents " were the largest source of personnel and material losses during the deployment , enforcing a new safety policy throughout the brigade intended to prevent these from occurring . 
 In 2007 , the 18th Engineer Brigade was reassigned to V Corps , taking the place of the 130th Engineer Brigade , which returned to the United States . Some of the 130th 's units either merged or were reassigned to the 18th Brigade . During this time , the unit participated in road work , construction of Forward Operating Bases , and other activities that enhanced training readiness in and around Campbell Barracks .

 In 2008 , the unit was notified of another upcoming deployment to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom . It commands three to five engineer battalions in Multinational Division – North . The battalions support individual Brigade Combat Teams of other units in " Task Force Iron " , a combat group led by the 1st Armored Division . They are working to rebuild Iraqi infrastructure , with the cooperation of Iraqi engineers , including construction of roads , airfields , and land moving . The unit cased its colors on 29 April 2008 , formally signifying the beginning of its deployment to Iraq . 
 The Brigade spent the first six months of its deployment to Tikrit in central Iraq , working on projects there for Multinational Division @-@ Center under the 10th Mountain Division . On 6 November , the brigade relocated to Kirkuk , unfurling its colors at Forward Operating Base Warrior . The brigade conducted route clearance and construction projects in northern Iraq , while partnered with Iraqi engineers . It replaced the 1st Brigade Combat Team , 10th Mountain Division in Kirkuk and will was under the area of responsibility of Multinational Division @-@ North led by the 1st Armored Division . In February 2009 , the brigade again moved , this time to <unk> Province to focus on construction projects in areas in and around Mosul . It was relieved by 2nd Brigade Combat Team , 1st Cavalry Division . On 17 July 2009 , the brigade handed over responsibility of Mosul to the 130th Engineer Brigade .

 Three soldiers from the 18th Engineer Brigade have gone on to serve as Chief of Engineers , the head of the US Army 's Corps of Engineers , this is the highest number to come from a single engineer brigade . These three are Lieutenant Generals Joe N. Ballard , John W. Morris , and Walter K. Wilson , Jr .. In addition to commanding the brigade from 1987 to 1990 , while it was stationed outside of Karlsruhe in Germany , LTG Ballard had also commanded a company in one of the brigade 's subordinate battalions , the <unk> Engineer Battalion , during its earlier years in Vietnam . 
 = Earthsuit = 
 Earthsuit was a New Orleans @-@ based Christian rock band formed in 1995 . The band consisted of guitarist Dave Rumsey , keyboardist / vocalist Paul Meany , bassist Roy Mitchell , drummer David " Hutch " Hutchison , and vocalist Adam LaClave . Earthsuit 's sound was primarily rock , but also possessed strong hip @-@ hop , electronica , reggae , soul , and experimental elements . 
 The group recorded several independent EPs and played primarily in their New Orleans area before becoming noticed by Sparrow Records at a concert in 1999 . The ensuing record deal saw the band 's only commercial release , a critically acclaimed album entitled Kaleidoscope Superior , in 2000 . Shortly after , the band left Sparrow and drifted out of the public eye . A final album , entitled The Rise of Modern Simulation was independently released before the group disbanded in 2003 . Many of the band members continue to play together and collaborate in various bands , namely Mutemath and Club of the Sons . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Earthsuit began in 1995 as a collaboration between Adam LaClave and Paul Meany , who began composing music together after being introduced at a church in New Orleans . In an interview with Family Christian Stores , Meany explained that a sermon was the inspiration for the band 's name : " ... This man was preaching about how humans are really spirit beings encased in fleshly bodies . The term " earth suit " came up . At the time we liked it , and we took it . " The two regularly performed at Café Joel , a small coffeehouse their church had started where Meany was music director . These performances helped cultivate their unique sound and introduced them to future band member David Rumsey . 
 In 1997 they released a self @-@ titled EP , which is sometimes called the Headless Clown EP due to its album cover . The record featured an early version of " One Time " ( of which they later made a music video ) as well as portions of live performances where Earthsuit covered Roberta Flack 's " Killing Me Softly " , albeit with re @-@ written lyrics . Rumsey helped produce the EP and played guitar ; however , the official band lineup only comprised LaClave and Meany . Shortly after , Rumsey officially joined along with bassist Roy Mitchell , another Café Joel regular . The band played and ministered in their hometown and did not tour much . In 1998 , the band recorded and released a second EP , entitled Noise for Your Eyes . The EP included a remix of " One Time " and early song demos , which were interspersed with short clips of live performances . Drummer David Hutchison joined the band after they met him through a friend . In 1999 , Earthsuit performed two sets at the Cornerstone Festival , one in a label showcase and the other opening for P.O.D. on the main stage . This garnered the attention of several major Christian labels , and the band subsequently signed to Sparrow Records . 
 The band began working with Prince producer David Leonard on their debut record , which excited Meany : " [ Sparrow ] loved what we were doing musically , and they wanted to find the producer who would capitalize on that . " Kaleidoscope Superior was released on June 20 , 2000 and elicited positive reviews from critics . It also received a Dove Award nomination and experienced some success on Christian radio stations . Christian rock peers Rebecca St. James and dc Talk members , Kevin Max and Michael Tait , expressed excitement over the record . The same year , Earthsuit embarked on a tour called Festival Con Dios with other Christian bands , such as the Elms , PAX 217 , and Switchfoot . The following year saw the band embark on their " Do You Feel The Distortion " tour with Ill Harmonics and The Benjamin Gate . 
 Despite critical reception , Kaleidoscope Superior would remain the band 's only commercial release ; they were soon dropped from Sparrow 's lineup due to " creative differences and marketing conundrums " . Earthsuit disappeared from the public eye and began posting on a website about a new independent album . In September 2001 , Hutchison left the band so he could spend more time with his family . Rumors began circling that the band would break up . In 2003 , Earthsuit revealed they were disbanding and released their last record , The Rise of Modern Simulation . The final collection featured six original studio songs and ten bonus tracks , including a live remix of " Against the Grain " , practice sessions of concert material , and covers of various songs . The album could only be purchased on the internet . Meany would later state " most people didn 't care when [ they ] broke up " . 
 Shortly after Earthsuit 's break up , Meany began working with drummer Darren King in a production team called " The <unk> " . The name later changed to " Math " while the group helped produce music for Christian music stalwart TobyMac . The band recruited guitarist Greg Hill and changed their name to Mutemath . To accommodate new recordings , Meany and producer Tedd T started an independent label named <unk> Records . Their first release was an EP titled Reset in September 2004 . Earthsuit alumnus Roy Mitchell joined the venture in 2005 . <unk> later signed a distribution deal directly with Warner Bros. Records , allowing Mutemath to release a full @-@ length self @-@ titled album on September 26 , 2006 . 
 Adam LaClave formed two bands , <unk> and Club of the Sons . <unk> has released only an independent CD titled <unk> ; the Hurricane Katrina disaster of 2005 forced the band members to go on hiatus . LaClave then turned his attention towards Club of the Sons with friend and bassist Jonathan Allen . They released an EP called The <unk> in spring 2007 and an album entitled Young Quanta on July 7 , 2009 . 
 = = Musical style and influences = = 
 Earthsuit music was primarily rock , but also possessed strong hip @-@ hop , electronica , reggae , soul , and experimental elements . Their sound had sometimes been compared to The Police , while Meany 's rapping had been likened to the Beastie Boys . Adam LaClave stated the differing musical tastes of the band helped cultivate their sound : " Each one of us is really into a lot of different things ... it helps make our sound because you can hear all kinds of things " . Live performances were characterized by sunglasses , futuristic costumes , and energetic showmanship . Many bands have influenced Earthsuit 's style ; the group has performed covers of songs by Basement Jaxx , Black Sheep , Kraftwerk , and The Talking Heads . They have also utilized samples by DJ Shadow and The Verve . 
 Adam LaClave and Paul Meany were the primary songwriters for Earthsuit . As Christians , the two wrote lyrics that often communicated a Christian message . For example , the song " Said the Sun " is an allegory about God telling Christians to be carriers of light . " Whitehorse " was written to present a different view of the return of Jesus , as LaClave stated in an interview , " Most people , when they hear the term " white horse , " think of the analogy of Jesus coming back ... [ We ] wanted to bring a different meaning to it , because ... He comes to rescue us in our everyday life [ too ] . " The men 's lyrics also reflect experiences they have had . Meany once had a dream that inspired him to write " Gummy Buffalo " ; he found himself in a candy store and squeezed a gummy buffalo whereupon he heard the melody for the song . Christianity Today has proposed the lyrics in " Foreign " may have been inspired by their departure from Sparrow Records . The lyrics read " There 's no place in your world for me / I 've been from sea to shining sea / And I can 't retain your policies , excuse me / If I 'm just hanging around , I 'm foreign . "

 By June 1998 , the site was seeing as many as 100 @,@ 000 page views per day and advertisers began to take notice . By December 1998 , Slashdot had net revenues of $ 18 @,@ 000 , yet its Internet profile was higher , and revenues were expected to increase . On June 29 , 1999 , the site was sold to Linux <unk> Andover.net for $ 1 @.@ 5 million in cash and $ 7 million in Andover stock at the IPO price . Part of the deal was contingent upon the continued employment of Malda and Bates and on the achievement of certain " milestones " . With the acquisition of Slashdot , Andover.net could now advertise itself as " the leading Linux / Open Source destination on the Internet " . Andover.net merged with VA Linux on February 3 , 2000 , which changed its name to SourceForge , Inc. on May 24 , 2007 , and became <unk> , Inc. on November 4 , 2009 . 
 Slashdot 's 10,000th article was posted after two and a half years on February 24 , 2000 , and the 100,000th article was posted on December 11 , 2009 after 12 years online . During the first 12 years , the most active story with the most responses posted was the post @-@ 2004 US Presidential Election article " Kerry <unk> Election To Bush " with 5 @,@ 687 posts . This followed the creation of a new article section , <unk> , created at the start of the 2004 election on September 7 , 2004 . Many of the most popular stories are political , with " Strike on Iraq " ( March 19 , 2003 ) the second @-@ most @-@ active article and " Barack Obama Wins US Presidency " ( November 5 , 2008 ) the third @-@ most @-@ active . The rest of the 10 most active articles are an article announcing the 2005 London bombings , and several articles about Evolution vs. Intelligent Design , Saddam Hussein 's capture , and Fahrenheit 9 / 11 . Articles about Microsoft and its Windows Operating System are popular . A thread posted in 2002 titled " What 's Keeping You On Windows ? " was the 10th @-@ most @-@ active story , and an article about Windows 2000 / <unk> source @-@ code leaks the most visited article with more than 680 @,@ 000 hits . 
 Some controversy erupted on March 9 , 2001 after an anonymous user posted the full text of Scientology 's " Operating Thetan Level Three " ( OT III ) document in a comment attached to a Slashdot article . The Church of Scientology demanded that Slashdot remove the document under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act . A week later , in a long article , Slashdot editors explained their decision to remove the page while providing links and information on how to get the document from other sources . 
 Slashdot Japan was launched on May 28 , 2001 ( although the first article was published April 5 , 2001 ) and is an official offshoot of the US @-@ based Web site . As of January 2010 the site was owned by <unk> @-@ Japan , Inc . , and carried some of the US @-@ based Slashdot articles as well as localized stories . 
 An external site , New Media Services , has reported the importance of Online Moderation last December 1 , 2011 . 
 On Valentine 's Day 2002 , founder Rob Malda proposed to longtime girlfriend Kathleen <unk> using the front page of Slashdot . They were married on December 8 , 2002 , in Las Vegas , Nevada . 
 Slashdot implemented a subscription service on March 1 , 2002 . Slashdot 's subscription model works by allowing users to pay a small fee to be able to view pages without banner ads , starting at a rate of $ 5 per 1 @,@ 000 page views – non @-@ subscribers may still view articles and respond to comments , with banner ads in place . On March 6 , 2003 , subscribers were given the ability to see articles 10 to 20 minutes before they are released to the public . 
 Slashdot altered its threaded discussion forum display software to explicitly show domains for links in articles , as " users made a sport out of tricking unsuspecting readers into visiting [ <unk> ] . " 
 In observance of April Fools ' Day in 2006 , Slashdot temporarily changed its signature teal color theme to a warm palette of bubblegum pink and changed its masthead from the usual , " News for Nerds " motto to , " OMG ! ! ! Ponies ! ! ! " Editors joked that this was done to increase female readership . In another supposed April Fools ' Day joke , User Achievement tags were introduced on April 1 , 2009 . This system allowed users to be tagged with various achievements , such as " The <unk> " for tagging a story or " Member of the { 1 @,@ 2 @,@ 3 @,@ 4 @,@ 5 } Digit <unk> Club " for having a Slashdot <unk> consisting of a certain number of digits . While it was posted on April Fools ' Day to allow for certain joke achievements , the system is real . 
 Slashdot unveiled its newly redesigned site on June 4 , 2006 , following a CSS Redesign Competition . The winner of the competition was Alex <unk> , who built on the initial CSS framework of the site . The new site looks similar to the old one but is more polished with more rounded curves , collapsible menus , and updated fonts . On November 9 that same year , Malda wrote that Slashdot attained 16 @,@ 777 @,@ 215 ( or 224 − 1 ) comments , which broke the database for three hours until the administrators fixed the issue . 
 On January 25 , 2011 , the site launched its third major redesign in its 13 @.@ 5 @-@ year history , which gutted the HTML and CSS , and updated the graphics . 
 On August 25 , 2011 , Malda resigned as Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief with immediate effect . He did not mention any plans for the future , other than spending more time with his family , catching up on some reading , and possibly writing a book . His final farewell message received over 1 @,@ 400 posts within 24 hours on the site . 
 On December 7 , 2011 , Slashdot announced that it would start to push what the company described as " sponsored " Ask Slashdot questions . 
 On March 28 , 2012 , Slashdot launched Slashdot TV . Two months later , in May 2012 , Slashdot launched <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , three Websites dedicated to original journalistic content . The Websites proved controversial , with longtime Slashdot users commenting that the original content ran counter to the Website 's longtime focus on user @-@ generated submissions . Nick <unk> , the editor of the three Websites , told The Next Web that the Websites were meant to “ meant to complement Slashdot with an added layer of insight into a very specific area of technology , without interfering with Slashdot ’ s longtime focus on tech @-@ community interaction and discussion . ” Despite the debate , articles published on <unk> and <unk> attracted attention from io9 , NPR , Nieman Lab , Vanity Fair , and other publications . 
 In September 2012 , Slashdot , SourceForge , and <unk> were acquired by online job site <unk> for $ 20 million , and incorporated into a subsidiary known as Slashdot Media . While initially stating that there were no plans for major changes to Slashdot , in October 2013 , Slashdot launched a " beta " for a significant redesign of the site , which featured a simpler appearance and commenting system . While initially an opt @-@ in beta , the site automatically began migrating selected users to the new design in February 2014 ; the rollout led to a negative response from many longtime users , upset by the added visual complexity , and the removal of features , such as comment viewing , that distinguished Slashdot from other news sites . An organized boycott of the site was held from February 10 to 17 , 2014 . The " beta " site was eventually shelved . 
 In July 2015 , Dice announced that it planned to sell Slashdot and SourceForge ; in particular , the company stated in a filing that it was unable to " successfully [ leverage ] the Slashdot user base to further Dice 's digital recruitment business " . On January 27 , 2016 , the two sites were sold to the San Diego @-@ based <unk> , LLC for an undisclosed amount .

He shared editorial responsibilities with several other editors including Timothy Lord , Patrick " <unk> " McGarry , Jeff " <unk> " Boehm , Rob " <unk> " <unk> , and Keith Dawson . Jonathan " <unk> " Pater is another popular editor of Slashdot , who came to work for Slashdot as a programmer and systems administrator . His online nickname ( handle ) , CowboyNeal , is inspired by a Grateful Dead tribute to Neal Cassady in their song , " That 's It for the Other One " . He is best known as the target of the usual comic poll option , a tradition started by Chris <unk> .

 Slashdot runs on Slash , a content management system available under the GNU General Public License . 
 = = = Peer moderation = = = 
 Slashdot 's editors are primarily responsible for selecting and editing the primary stories daily from submitters ; they provide a one @-@ paragraph summary for each and a link to an external site where the story originated . Each story becomes the topic for a threaded discussion among the site 's users . A user @-@ based moderation system is employed to filter out abusive comments . 
 Every comment is initially given a score of − 1 to + 2 , with a default score of + 1 for registered users , 0 for anonymous users ( Anonymous Coward ) , + 2 for users with high " karma " , or − 1 for users with low " karma " . As moderators read comments attached to articles , they click to moderate the comment , either up ( + 1 ) or down ( − 1 ) . <unk> may choose to attach a particular descriptor to the comments as well , such as " normal " , " <unk> " , " <unk> " , " troll " , " redundant " , " insightful " , " interesting " , " informative " , " funny " , " overrated " , or " underrated " , with each corresponding to a − 1 or + 1 rating . So a comment may be seen to have a rating of " + 1 insightful " or " − 1 troll " . Comments are very rarely deleted , even if they contain hateful remarks . 
 Moderation points add to a user 's karma , and users with high " karma " are eligible to become moderators themselves . The system does not promote regular users as " moderators " and instead assigns five moderation points at a time to users based on the number of comments they have entered in the system – once a user 's moderation points are used up , they can no longer moderate articles ( though they can be assigned more moderation points at a later date ) . Paid staff editors have an unlimited number of moderation points . 
 A given comment can have any integer score from − 1 to + 5 , and registered users of Slashdot can set a personal threshold so that no comments with a lesser score are displayed . For instance , a user reading Slashdot at level + 5 will only see the highest rated comments , while a user reading at level − 1 will see a more " unfiltered , anarchic version " . 
 A meta @-@ moderation system was implemented on September 7 , 1999 , to moderate the moderators and help contain abuses in the moderation system . Meta @-@ moderators are presented with a set of <unk> that they may rate as either fair or unfair . For each moderation , the meta @-@ moderator sees the original comment and the reason assigned by the moderator ( e.g. troll , funny ) , and the meta @-@ moderator can click to see the context of comments surrounding the one that was moderated . 
 = = Features = = 
 Slashdot features discussion forums on a variety of <unk> and science @-@ related topics , or " News for Nerds " , as its motto states . Articles are divided into the following sections : 
 Apple – news related to products from Apple Inc . , such as Mac OS X or iPhone . 
 Ask Slashdot – articles that seek advice from users about jobs , computer hardware , software glitches , philosophical problems , or more . 
 Book Reviews – original book reviews on ( not necessarily ) tech books . 
 BSD – news about the various modern versions of UNIX derived from the UCB distribution . 
 Developers – news about software or programming . 
 Features – original , feature @-@ length articles . 
 Games – gaming news . 
 Geeks in Space – a web audio broadcast featuring several of the editors of Slashdot ( outdated ; no new episodes have been posted recently ) . 
 Idle – miscellaneous and humorous articles , pictures , and videos . 
 Interviews – interviews with various people related to science and technology . 
 Information Technology ( IT ) – anything that people with " Information Technology " in their job description might be interested to know . 
 Linux – news specific to the Linux operating system ( any variant or distribution ) . 
 Politics – news typically relevant to politics of the United States , but occasionally featuring international political news . It was originally created to cover the 2004 United States Presidential Election . 
 Polls – a poll is usually run on the site in the right @-@ hand margin , asking users their choice on a variety of topics . In the earlier years of the site , one of the options that could be selected was CowboyNeal , the handle of Jonathan Pater , an administrator of the site . This became known as the CowboyNeal option . During the summer of 2005 , he stopped being in charge of the polls , and as a result the CowboyNeal option disappeared . 
 Science – news on science @-@ related topics ( e.g. cool technology , space telescope observations , interesting medical research ) . 
 Your Rights Online ( <unk> ) – news on topics pertaining to internet privacy and digital rights . 
 = = = Tags = = = 
 Slashdot uses a system of " tags " where users can categorize a story to group them together and sorting them . Tags are written in all lowercase , with no spaces , and limited to 64 characters . For example , articles could be tagged as being about " security " or " <unk> " . Some articles are tagged with longer tags , such as " <unk> " ( expressing the perception of catastrophic risk ) , " <unk> " ( used when the community feels that the subject has finally figured out something obvious ) , " <unk> " ( used when scientific articles lack direct evidence ; see correlation does not imply causation ) , or " <unk> " ( commonly seen in articles about Mars or space exploration ) . 
 = = Culture = = 
 As an online community with primarily user @-@ generated content , many in @-@ jokes and internet memes have developed over the course of the site 's history . A popular meme ( based on an unscientific Slashdot user poll ) is , " In Soviet Russia , noun verb you ! " This type of joke has its roots in the 1960s or earlier , and is known as a " Russian reversal " . Other popular memes usually pertain to computing or technology , such as " Imagine a Beowulf cluster of these " , " But does it run Linux ? " , or " <unk> now confirms : BSD ( or some other software package or item ) is dying . " Some users will also refer to seemingly innocent remarks by correcting them and adding " you insensitive clod ! " to the statement – a reference to a February 14 , 1986 , Calvin & Hobbes cartoon . Also , on the television show Cheers , Season 8 Episode 23 ( 4 / 12 / 1990 ) , Frasier , in protest to a seance , rattles glasses to startle the participants . His wife Lilith remarks , " Frasier , don 't be such an insensitive clod ! " Or the 11th season of The Simpsons episode , " Last Tap Dance in Springfield " ( 5 / 7 / 2000 ) , wherein Frink exclaims to Homer , " I was merely trying to spare the girl 's feelings , you insensitive clod ! " Users will also typically refer to articles referring to data storage and data capacity by inquiring how much it is in units of Libraries of Congress . Sometimes bandwidth speeds are referred to in units of Libraries of Congress per second . When numbers are quoted , people will comment that the number happens to be the " combination to their luggage " ( a reference to the Mel Brooks film Spaceballs ) and express false anger at the person who revealed it . 
 Slashdotters often use the abbreviation <unk> which stands for The fucking article or <unk> ( " Read the fucking article " ) , which itself is derived from the abbreviation <unk> . Usage of this abbreviation often exposes comments from posters who have not read the article linked to in the main story . 
 Slashdotters typically like to mock United States Senator Ted Stevens ' 2006 description of the Internet as a " series of tubes " or Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer 's chair @-@ throwing incident from 2005 . Microsoft founder Bill Gates is a popular target of jokes by Slashdotters , and all stories about Microsoft were once identified with a graphic of Gates looking like a Borg from Star Trek : The Next Generation . Many Slashdotters have long talked about the supposed release of Duke Nukem Forever , which was promised in 1997 but was delayed indefinitely ( the game was eventually released in 2011 ) . References to the game are commonly brought up in other articles about software packages that are not yet in production even though the announced delivery date has long passed ( see vaporware ) . 
 Having a low Slashdot user identifier ( user ID ) is highly valued since they are assigned sequentially ; having one is a sign that someone has an older account and has contributed to the site longer . For Slashdot 's 10 @-@ year anniversary in 2007 , one of the items auctioned off in the charity auction for the Electronic Frontier Foundation was a 3 @-@ digit Slashdot user ID .

The primary stories on the site consist of a short synopsis paragraph , a link to the original story , and a lengthy discussion section , all contributed by users . Discussion on stories can get up to 10 @,@ 000 posts per day . Slashdot has been considered a pioneer in user @-@ driven content , influencing other sites such as Google News and Wikipedia . There has been a dip in readership as of 2011 , primarily due to the increase of technology @-@ related blogs and Twitter feeds . In 2002 , approximately 50 % of Slashdot 's traffic consisted of people who simply check out the headlines and click through , while others participate in discussion boards and take part in the community . Many links in Slashdot stories caused the linked site to get swamped by heavy traffic and its server to collapse . This is known as the " Slashdot effect " , a term which was first coined on February 15 , 1999 that refers to an article about a " new generation of niche Web portals driving unprecedented amounts of traffic to sites of interest " . Today , most major websites can handle the surge of traffic , but the effect continues to occur on smaller or independent sites . These sites are then said to have been " <unk> " . 
 Slashdot has received over twenty awards , including People 's Voice Awards in 2000 in both of the categories for which it was nominated ( Best Community Site and Best News Site ) . It was also voted as one of Newsweek 's favorite technology Web sites and rated in Yahoo ! ' s Top 100 Web sites as the " Best Geek Hangout " ( 2001 ) .

 Empire of the Sun is a 1987 American epic coming @-@ of @-@ age war film based on J. G. Ballard 's semi @-@ autobiographical novel of the same name . Steven Spielberg directed the film , which stars Christian Bale , John Malkovich , Miranda Richardson , and Nigel Havers . The film tells the story of Jamie " Jim " Graham , a young boy who goes from living in a wealthy British family in Shanghai , to becoming a prisoner of war in a Japanese internment camp , during World War II . 
 Harold Becker and David Lean were originally to direct before Spielberg came on board , initially as a producer for Lean . Spielberg was attracted to directing the film because of a personal connection to Lean 's films and World War II topics . He considers it to be his most profound work on " the loss of innocence " . The film received critical acclaim but was not initially a box office success , earning only $ 22 @,@ 238 @,@ 696 at the US box office , but it eventually more than recouped its budget through revenues in other markets . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Amidst Japan 's invasion of China during World War II , Jamie Graham — a British upper middle class schoolboy — is enjoying a privileged and spoiled life in the Shanghai International Settlement . After the Attack on Pearl Harbor , the Japanese begin to occupy the settlement , and in the ensuing chaos to escape the city Jamie is separated from his parents . Jamie 's mother shouts at him over the panicked mob to wait at their house and promises that they will come back for him . He spends some time living in his deserted home , but after eating all the food he ventures out into the city . 
 Hungry , Jamie tries to surrender to some Japanese soldiers , who shrug and laugh him off . After being chased by a street urchin , he is taken in by Basie — an American expatriate and hustler — and his partner Frank , who nicknames him " Jim " . They intend to leave the boy in the streets when they are unable to sell his teeth for cash , but Jamie promises to lead them back to his neighborhood where there are valuables to loot . There , Jamie finds his house lit and sees a figure in the window whom he thinks is his mother . He runs to the door only to discover the house is occupied by Japanese troops , who take the trio prisoner . They are then taken to <unk> Civilian Assembly Center in Shanghai for processing . A truck later arrives to take selected internees to the Suzhou Creek Internment Camp ; Basie is among those selected to go but Jamie is not . Because he knows of the camp 's location , a desperate Jamie convinces the soldiers to take him . On arrival at the camp Jim wanders to the airfield to witness workers servicing a squadron of Zero fighters . As Jim reaches out to touch one he is confronted by a trio of fighter pilots . Jim salutes the pilots , and they salute Jim in return . 
 It is now 1945 , nearing the end of the Pacific War . Despite the terror and poor living conditions of the camp , Jim survives by establishing a successful trading network — which even involves the camp 's commander , Sergeant Nagata . Dr. Rawlins , the camp 's British doctor , becomes a father figure and teacher to Jim . One night after a bombing raid , Nagata orders the destruction of the prisoners ' infirmary as reprisal . He only stops when Jim ( now fluent in Japanese ) begs forgiveness . Through the barbed wire fencing , Jim befriends a Japanese teenager , who is a trainee pilot . Jim also visits Basie in the American POW barracks , where Jim idolizes the Americans and their culture . Basie eventually sends Jim to set snare traps outside the camp 's wire ; though Jim succeeds , Basie is only using him to test the area for land mines — plotting to escape . As a reward , Basie allows Jim to move into the American barracks with him . 
 One morning at dawn , Jim witnesses a kamikaze ritual . Overcome with emotion , he salutes and sings the Welsh song " Suo <unk> " . The base is suddenly attacked by a group of American P @-@ 51 Mustang fighter aircraft . Jim is overjoyed and climbs the ruins of a nearby pagoda to better watch the airstrike . Dr. Rawlins chases Jim up the pagoda to save him , where the boy breaks down in tears — he cannot remember what his parents look like . As a result of the attack the Japanese decide to evacuate the camp . Basie escapes during the confusion , though he had promised to take Jim with him . The camp 's prisoners march through the wilderness where many die of fatigue , starvation , and disease . 
 Arriving at a football stadium near <unk> — filled with luxuries confiscated by the Japanese — Jim recognizes his parents ' Packard . Waking up next to the corpse of a woman , Jim witnesses flashes from the atomic bombing of Nagasaki hundreds of miles away . Jim slips away from the group and wanders back to Suzhou Creek . Along the way he hears news of Japan 's surrender and the end of the war . He encounters the Japanese teenager he befriended earlier , who has since become a pilot but is now disillusioned . The youth remembers Jim and offers him a mango , and will cut it for him with his katana . Basie reappears with a group of armed Americans who have arrived to loot the Red Cross containers being airdropped over the area . One of the Americans , thinking Jim is in danger , shoots and kills the Japanese youth . Basie offers to help Jim find his parents , but Jim — infuriated over his friend 's death — chooses to stay behind . 
 Jim is eventually found by American soldiers and placed in an orphanage . Here , the film ends with a deeply traumatized Jim reuniting with his mother and father over the sound of the Welsh lullaby . 
 The final scene shows " Jim ’ s suitcase floating in the river in Shanghai ( which he had thrown in the water during the march to <unk> stadium ) . We know that inside are Jim ’ s cherished cutouts of American magazines , the closest thing he has to memories , and aptly echoes the opening shot of a coffin floating in the same river . "

 Warner Bros. purchased the film rights , intending Harold Becker to direct and Robert Shapiro to produce . Tom Stoppard wrote the first draft of the screenplay , on which Ballard briefly collaborated . Becker dropped out , and David Lean came to direct with Spielberg as producer . Lean explained , " I worked on it for about a year and in the end I gave it up because I thought it was too similar to a diary . It was well @-@ written and interesting , but I gave it to Steve . " Spielberg felt " from the moment I read J. G. Ballard 's novel I secretly wanted to direct myself . " Spielberg found the project to be very personal . As a child , his favorite film was Lean 's The Bridge on the River Kwai , which similarly takes place in a Japanese prisoner of war camp . Spielberg 's fascination with World War II and the aircraft of that era was stimulated by his father 's stories of his experience as a radio operator on North American B @-@ 25 Mitchell bombers in the China @-@ Burma Theater . Spielberg hired Menno Meyjes to do an uncredited rewrite before Stoppard was brought back to write the shooting script . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Empire of the Sun was filmed at Elstree Studios in the United Kingdom , and on location in Shanghai and Spain . The filmmakers searched across Asia in an attempt to find locations that resembled 1941 Shanghai . They entered negotiations with Shanghai Film Studios and China Film Co @-@ Production Corporation in 1985 . After a year of negotiations , permission was granted for a three @-@ week shoot in early March 1987 . It was the first American film shot in Shanghai since the 1940s . The Chinese authorities allowed the crew to alter signs to traditional Chinese characters , as well as closing down city blocks for filming . Over 5 @,@ 000 local extras were used , some old enough to remember the Japanese occupation of Shanghai 40 years earlier . Members of the People 's Liberation Army played Japanese soldiers . Other locations included <unk> in Andalusia , Knutsford in Cheshire and Sunningdale in Berkshire . Lean often visited the set during the England shoot . 
 Spielberg attempted to portray the era accurately , using period vehicles and aircraft . Four Harvard <unk> aircraft were lightly modified in France to resemble Mitsubishi A6M Zero aircraft . Two additional non @-@ flying replicas were used . Three restored P @-@ 51D Mustangs , two from ' The Fighter Collection ' of England , and one from the ' Old Flying Machine Company ' , were flown in the film . These P @-@ 51s were flown by Ray Hanna ( who was featured in the film flying at low @-@ level past the child star with the canopy back , waving ) , his son Mark and " Hoof " Proudfoot and took over 10 days of filming to complete due to the complexity of the planned aerial sequences , which included the P @-@ 51s actually dropping plaster @-@ filled replica 500 lb bombs at low level , with simulated bomb blasts . A number of large scale remote control flying models were also used , including an 18 @-@ foot wingspan B @-@ 29 , but Spielberg felt the results were disappointing , so he extended the film contract with the full @-@ size examples and pilots on set in <unk> , Spain .

 = = = Critical response = = = 
 Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 83 % based on reviews from 40 critics . By comparison Metacritic calculated an average score of 60 out of 100 based on 17 reviews . J. G. Ballard gave positive feedback , and was especially impressed with Christian Bale 's performance . Critical reaction was not universally affirmative , but Richard Corliss of Time stated that Spielberg " has energized each frame with allusive legerdemain and an intelligent density of images and emotions . " Janet Maslin from The New York Times called the film " a visual splendor , a heroic adventurousness and an immense scope that make it unforgettable . " Julie Salamon of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the film as " an edgy , intelligent script by playwright Tom Stoppard , Spielberg has made an extraordinary film out of Mr. Ballard 's extraordinary war experience . " J. Hoberman from The Village Voice decried that the serious subject was undermined by Spielberg 's " shamelessly <unk> " approach . Roger Ebert gave a mixed reaction , " Despite the emotional potential in the story , it didn 't much move me . Maybe , like the kid , I decided that no world where you can play with airplanes can be all that bad . " On his TV show with Gene Siskel , Ebert said that the film “ is basically a good idea for a film that never gets off the ground ” . Siskel added , “ I don ’ t know what the film is about . It ’ s so totally confused and taking things from different parts . On one hand , if it wants to say something about a child ’ s @-@ eye view of war , you got a movie made by John Boorman called Hope and Glory that was just released that is much better , and much more daring in showing the whimsy that children ’ s view of war is . On the other hand , this film wants to hedge its bet and make it like an adventure film , so you ’ ve got like Indiana Jones with the John Malkovich character helping the little kid through all the fun of war .

 In his second starring role , Bale received a special citation for Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures , an award specially created for his performance in Empire of the Sun . At the 60th Academy Awards , Empire of the Sun was nominated for Art Direction , Cinematography , Editing , Original Music Score , Costume Design ( Bob Ringwood ) , and Sound ( Robert Knudson , Don Digirolamo , John Boyd and Tony Dawe ) . It did not convert any of the nominations into awards . Allen Daviau , who was nominated as cinematographer , publicly complained , " I can 't second @-@ guess the Academy , but I feel very sorry that I get nominations and Steven doesn 't . It 's his vision that makes it all come together , and if Steven wasn 't making these films , none of us would be here . " The film won awards for cinematography , sound design , and music score at the 42nd British Academy Film Awards . The nominations included production design , costume design , and adapted screenplay . Spielberg was honored by his work from the Directors Guild of America , while the American Society of Cinematographers honored Allen Daviau . Empire of the Sun was nominated for Best Motion Picture ( Drama ) and Original Score at the 45th Golden Globe Awards . John Williams earned a Grammy Award nomination .

 Flying symbolizes Jim 's possibility and danger of escape from the prison camp . His growing alienation from his prewar self and society is reflected in his hero @-@ worship of the Japanese aviators based at the airfield adjoining the camp . " I think it 's true that the Japanese were pretty brutal with the Chinese , so I don 't have any particularly sentimental view of them , " Ballard recalled . " But small boys tend to find their heroes where they can . One thing there was no doubt about , and that was that the Japanese were extremely brave . One had very complicated views about patriotism [ and ] loyalty to one 's own nation . Jim is constantly identifying himself , first with the Japanese ; then , when the Americans start flying over in their Mustangs and B @-@ 29s , he 's very drawn to the American . " 
 The apocalyptic wartime setting and the climactic moment when Jim sees the distant white flash of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki gave Spielberg powerful visual metaphors " to draw a parallel story between the death of this boy 's innocence and the death of the innocence of the entire world . " Spielberg reflected he " was attracted to the idea that this was a death of innocence , not an attenuation of childhood , which by my own admission and everybody 's impression of me is what my life has been . This was the opposite of Peter Pan . This was a boy who had grown up too quickly . " Other topics that Spielberg previously dealt with , and are presented in Empire of the Sun , include a child being separated from his parents ( The Sugarland Express , E.T. the Extra @-@ Terrestrial , Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Poltergeist ) and World War II ( 1941 , and Raiders of the Lost Ark ) . Spielberg explained " My parents got a divorce when I was 14 , 15 . The whole thing about separation is something that runs very deep in anyone exposed to divorce . "

 = Lovas killings = 
 The Lovas killings ( Croatian : <unk> u <unk> , Serbian : <unk> u <unk> , Cyrillic : <unk> у <unk> ) involved the killing of 70 Croat civilian residents of the village of Lovas between 10 – 18 October 1991 , during the Croatian War of Independence . The killings took place during and in the immediate aftermath of the occupation of the village by the Yugoslav People 's Army ( Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA ) supported by Croatian Serb forces and Dušan Silni paramilitaries on 10 October , two days after Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia . The occupation occurred during the Battle of Vukovar , as the JNA sought to consolidate its control over the area surrounding the city of Vukovar . The killings and abuse of the civilian population continued until 18 October , when troops guarding a group of civilians forced them to walk into a minefield at gunpoint and then opened fire upon them . 
 After the Croatian Serb forces , the JNA and the paramilitaries established their control in the village , the Croat population was required to wear white armbands and mark their houses using white sheets . The church in Lovas was torched and 261 houses were looted and destroyed , while 1 @,@ 341 civilians were forced to leave their homes . The bodies of the victims were retrieved from a mass grave and ten individual graves in 1997 . Lovas was rebuilt after the war , but its population size shrunk by one third compared to its pre @-@ war level . 
 The occupation of Lovas and the killing and expulsion of its civilian population was included in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) indictments of the President of Serbia , Slobodan Milošević , and Goran Hadžić — a high @-@ ranking official of the Croatian Serb @-@ declared wartime breakaway region of SAO Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Syrmia . Milošević died before his trial was completed , and as of 2014 Hadžić 's trial is ongoing . Serbian authorities tried and convicted a group of four for the killings , but a retrial was ordered following an appeal in 2014 . Croatia indicted 17 persons in connection with the killings , although only two were available to the authorities . One of them was acquitted and the other declared unfit to stand trial . 
 = = Background = = 
 After the Croatian Democratic Union won 1990 parliamentary elections in the Socialist Republic of Croatia , ethnic tensions between Croats and Serbs within the Republic worsened . The ethnic groups are also divided along religious lines as the Croats are Catholics while the Serbs are Orthodox Christians . The Yugoslav People 's Army ( Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA ) confiscated the weapons of Croatia 's Territorial Defence ( Teritorijalna obrana - TO ) forces to minimize resistance . On 17 August , tensions escalated into an open revolt by Croatian Serbs , centred on the predominantly Serb @-@ populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin , and parts of the Lika , Kordun , Banovina and eastern Croatia . This revolt was followed in January 1991 , by two unsuccessful attempts by Serbia , supported by Montenegro and Serbia 's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo , to obtain the Yugoslav Presidency 's approval for a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces . 
 After a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March , the JNA itself , supported by Serbia and its allies , asked the Federal Presidency to give it wartime authorities and declare a state of emergency . The request was denied on 15 March , and in consequence , Serbia abandoned the goal of a more centralised Yugoslavia for that of the Greater Serbia . The leadership of the JNA , fragmented between supporters of the federal government of Ante Marković and others aligned with Serbia since the breakup of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in 1990 , came under the control of Serbian President Slobodan Milošević . The control shifted after Milošević publicly declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the Federal Presidency and planned to establish a Serbian army which would draw JNA 's Serbian personnel to the new force . The initial objective of the JNA , that of Yugoslav unity , was either abandoned or sought through support for Milošević . Even though he preferred a campaign to expand Serbia rather than to preserve Yugoslavia , the JNA equated protecting Serbs in Croatia with preservation of Yugoslavia . By summer , Milošević had the JNA under full control through his control of the rump Federal Presidency and his influence over the federal defence minister and top @-@ ranked JNA officer , General of the Army Veljko Kadijević and JNA chief of staff , Colonel General Blagoje Adžić . 
 By the end of March , the conflict had escalated into the Croatian War of Independence . The JNA stepped in , increasingly supporting the Croatian Serb insurgents and preventing Croatian police from intervening . In early April , the leaders of the Croatian Serb revolt declared their intention to integrate the area under their control , known as SAO Krajina , with Serbia . The Government of Croatia viewed this declaration as an attempt to secede . 
 In May , the Croatian government responded by forming the Croatian National Guard ( Zbor narodne garde - ZNG ) , but its development was hampered by a United Nations ( UN ) arms embargo introduced in September . On 8 October , Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia . Late 1991 saw the fiercest fighting of the war , as the 1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia culminated in the Siege of Dubrovnik , and the Battle of Vukovar . 
 = = Timeline = = 
 Armed clashes in eastern Slavonia gradually intensified as the JNA committed significant new units to the Battle of Vukovar , including the 453rd Mechanised Brigade , the 1st Proletarian Guards Mechanised Division , and the 252nd Armoured Brigade . During the initial stage of the battle , the JNA bypassed a number of Croat villages southeast of the city of Vukovar — including Lovas . In late September 1991 , the easternmost Croatian positions in the area ran along a line connecting the villages of <unk> – <unk> – Lovas and those were defended by the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Guards Brigade and the 109th Infantry Brigade . 
 On 1 October , after the JNA took control of the Nuštar – Marinci – Bogdanovci – Vukovar road , the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Guards Brigade and the 109th Infantry Brigade were moved south of Vukovar in an attempt to restore Croatian control of the route between Vinkovci and Vukovar . The JNA tasked the 2nd Proletarian Guards Mechanised Brigade , to clear the Croatian pocket centered on Lovas . The JNA was supported by Dušan Silni Serbian paramilitaries under control of Dragoslav <unk> and the Serbian National Renewal party , as well as Croatian Serb TO forces . 
 The JNA , supported by the paramilitaries and the TO , entered Lovas unopposed on the morning of 10 October . According to court testimony of one of the paramilitaries who took part in the events , the troops moving against Lovas were told to expect 300 – 400 ZNG troops defending the village . Once the attacking force entered the village , the troops continued to throw grenades and shoot at houses at random for several hours . During the assault , 22 civilians were killed in their homes or back yards . In the immediate aftermath of the takeover of Lovas , Croat civilians were required to wear white armbands and their houses were marked using white sheets . The marked houses were looted and torched by the TO and paramilitaries . Authority in the village was turned over to <unk> Devetak , a member of the Dušan Silni paramilitaries . He was styled as the commander of the village , but the JNA remained in overall control of the entire region . Over the following week , 23 more civilians were killed by the paramilitaries and the TO troops in improvised detention facilities . The improvised prisons were also used for torture and abuse of captives , including war rape , causing serious injuries to 18 civilians . 
 On 17 October , all men aged 18 to 60 were ordered to report for a meeting , but were detained overnight instead on the pretext that someone had fired shots in the village the previous night . The detainees were beaten , and otherwise abused that night . Approximately 20 were released in the morning , and the rest were told that they were assigned to grape harvest duty . The civilians walked out of the village under a military escort . One of the civilians was killed by the guards , before the group reached a point within 1 to 2 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 62 to 1 @.@ 24 miles ) of the Vukovar – Tovarnik road , where they were ordered into a <unk> at gunpoint . The men were told to hold hands and sweep their feet in front of them across the ground . The JNA had previously placed land mines in the field . Several mines were set off , while the troops guarding the civilian detainees fired at the men in the field . The survivors were then forced to retrieve the dead and injured and clear the remaining mines . Out of 50 civilians forced into the minefield , 21 were killed in the minefield itself . The number of persons wounded by mine explosions or gunfire is variously reported as 14 or 15 . Three more civilians were killed in Lovas by the end of November . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 In the immediate aftermath of the takeover of the village by the JNA and the paramilitaries , 1 @,@ 341 civilians were forced to leave Lovas . The local Roman Catholic church of St. Michael was torched and 261 houses destroyed . In 1995 , the establishment of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Sirmium ( UNTAES ) and the gradual restoration of Croatian control in the region was agreed between Croatian authorities and Croatian Serbs in the region through the Erdut Agreement . United Nations experts began exhuming victims from a mass grave in Lovas on 2 June 1997 . Sixty @-@ eight bodies , including those of people killed in Lovas , were ultimately recovered from the mass grave , and ten more were recovered from nearby individual graves . The exhumed victims were reburied on 21 March 1998 . A monument to the civilian victims was erected at the site of the mass grave on 27 May 1999 , as was a cross to mark the location of the minefield . Another mass grave containing the bodies of six individuals was discovered in nearby <unk> Forest , along with three individual graves . Similar to the other burial sites , the victims buried there included those killed in Lovas , as well as others , killed elsewhere in the area . Lovas was rebuilt after the war , but its population declined by one third compared to the pre @-@ war level . 
 The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) included war crimes against civilians and property committed in Lovas in October 1991 in its indictment of Milošević . Milošević 's trial commenced on 12 February 2002 , but Milošević died in March 2006 before a verdict could be reached . 
 In 1994 and 2004 Croatian authorities filed two separate cases against a total of 17 persons , including Devetak , and indicted them on charges of genocide and war crimes committed against the civilian population of Lovas . The group included fifteen who were tried in absentia . In 2009 , the process was split for Milan <unk> and Ilija Vorkapić who were available to Croatian authorities , and once more a year later when <unk> was judged not fit to stand trial . Vorkapić was acquitted in 2012 . 
 Serbian authorities charged four persons associated with former Croatian Serb authorities in the eastern Slavonia with war crimes committed in Lovas , consisting of four JNA officers and six former members of the Dušan Silni paramilitaries . The trial started in 2008 . In 2012 , the group was convicted of killing of 70 Croat civilians and sentenced to a total of 128 years in prison . Devetak received a prison term of 20 years , while the others received prison sentences ranging from four to fourteen years . However , in 2014 , the court of appeals ordered a new trial . 
 The ICTY also indicted Goran Hadžić , the Croatian Serb political leader in the eastern Slavonia region and head of the SAO Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Syrmia government declared by the Croatian Serbs in the region at the time before it merged into the Republic of Serbian Krajina . The charges include war crimes of persecutions , extermination , murder , imprisonment , torture , inhumane acts and cruel treatment , deportation , forcible transfer of population , wanton destruction and plunder of property . As of March 2014 his trial , which commenced on 16 October 2012 , is in progress . 
 = Royal Tunbridge Wells = 
 Royal Tunbridge Wells ( often shortened to Tunbridge Wells ) is a large affluent town in western Kent , England , about 40 miles ( 64 km ) south @-@ east of central London by road , 34 @.@ 5 miles ( 55 @.@ 5 km ) by rail . The town is close to the border of the county of East Sussex . It is situated at the northern edge of the High Weald , the sandstone geology of which is exemplified by the rock formations at the Wellington Rocks and High Rocks . 
 The town came into being as a spa in the Restoration and had its heyday as a tourist resort under Beau Nash when the Pantiles and its chalybeate spring attracted visitors who wished to take the waters . Though its popularity waned with the advent of sea bathing , the town remains popular and derives some 30 percent of its income from the tourist industry . 
 The town has a population of around 56 @,@ 500 and is the administrative centre of Tunbridge Wells Borough and the UK parliamentary constituency of Tunbridge Wells . In the United Kingdom , Royal Tunbridge Wells has a reputation as being the archetypal conservative " Middle England " town , a stereotype that is typified by the fictional letter @-@ writer " Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells " . 
 = = History = = 
 Evidence suggests that during the Iron Age people farmed the fields and mined the iron @-@ rich rocks in the Tunbridge Wells area , and excavations in 1940 and 1957 – 61 by James Money at High Rocks uncovered the remains of a defensive hill @-@ fort . It is thought that the site was occupied into the era of Roman Britain , and the area continued to be part of the Wealden iron industry until its demise in the late eighteenth century — indeed , an iron forge remains in the grounds of <unk> Abbey , in use until 1575 and documented until 1714 . 
 The area which is now Tunbridge Wells was part of the parish of <unk> for hundreds of years , but the origin of the town as it is today , however , came in the seventeenth century . In 1606 Dudley , Lord North , a courtier to James I who was staying at a hunting lodge in Eridge in the hope that the country air might improve his ailing constitution , discovered a chalybeate spring . He drank from the spring and , when his health improved , he became convinced that it had healing properties . He persuaded his rich friends in London to try it , and by the time Queen Henrietta Maria , wife of King Charles I , visited in 1630 it had established itself as a spa retreat . By 1636 it had become so popular that two houses were built next to the spring to cater for the visitors , one for the ladies and one for the gentlemen , and in 1664 Lord Muskerry , Lord of the Manor , enclosed it with a triangular stone wall , and built a hall " to shelter the dippers in wet weather . " 
 Until 1676 little permanent building took place — visitors were obliged either to camp on the downs or to find lodgings at Southborough , — but at this time houses and shops were erected on the walks , and every " convenient situation near the springs " was built upon . Also in 1676 a subscription for a " chapel of ease " was opened , and in 1684 the Church of King Charles the Martyr was duly built and the town began to develop around it . In 1787 Edward Hasted described the new town as consisting of four small districts , " named after the hills on which they stand , Mount Ephraim , Mount Pleasant and Mount Sion ; the other is called the Wells ... " 
 The 1680s saw a building boom in the town : carefully planned shops were built beside the 175 yards ( 160 m ) long Pantiles promenade ( then known as the Walks ) , and the Mount Sion road , on which lodging house keepers were to build , was laid out in small plots . Tradesmen in the town dealt in the luxury goods demanded by their patrons , which would certainly have included Tunbridge ware , a kind of decoratively inlaid woodwork . 
 " They have made the wells very commodious by the many good building all about it and two or three miles around which are lodgings for the company that drink the waters . All the people buy their own provisions at the market , which is just by the wells and is furnished with great plenty of all sorts of fish and fowl . The walk which is between high trees on the market side which are shops full of all sorts of toys , silver , china , milliners and all sorts of curious wooden ware besides which there are two large coffee houses for tea , chocolate etc. and two rooms for the lottery and hazard board ( i.e. for gambling ) . " — Celia Fiennes , 1697 
 Following Dr Richard Russell 's 1750 treatise advocating sea water as a treatment for diseases of the glands , fashions in leisure changed and sea bathing became more popular than visiting the spas , which resulted in fewer visitors coming to the town . Nevertheless , the advent of turnpike roads gave Tunbridge Wells better communications — on weekdays a public coach made nine return journeys between Tunbridge Wells and London , and postal services operated every morning except Monday and every evening except Saturday . During the eighteenth century the growth of the town continued , as did its patronage by the wealthy leisured classes — it received celebrity cachet from visits by figures such as Cibber , Johnson , Garrick , Richardson and the successful bookseller Andrew Millar and his wife — and in 1735 Richard ( Beau ) Nash appointed himself as master of ceremonies for all the entertainments that Tunbridge Wells had to offer . He remained in this position until his death in 1762 , and under his patronage the town reached the height of its popularity as a fashionable resort . 
 By the early nineteenth century Tunbridge Wells experienced growth as a place for the well @-@ to @-@ do to visit and make their homes . It became a fashionable resort town again following visits by the Duchess of Kent , Queen Victoria and Prince Albert , and benefited from a new estate on Mount Pleasant and the building of the Trinity church in 1827 , and improvements made to the town and the provision of facilities such as gas lighting and a police service meant that by 1837 the town population had swelled to 9 @,@ 100 . In 1842 an omnibus service was set up that ran from Tonbridge to Tunbridge Wells , enabling visitors to arrive from London within two hours , and in 1845 the town was linked to the railway network via a branch from South Eastern Railway 's London @-@ Hastings Hastings Line at Tonbridge . During this time Decimus Burton developed John Ward 's Calverley Park estate . 
 In 1889 the town was awarded the status of a Borough , and it entered the 20th century in a prosperous state . 1902 saw the opening of an Opera House , and in 1909 the town received its " Royal " prefix . Due to its position in South East England , during the First World War Tunbridge Wells was made a headquarters for the army , and its hospitals were used to treat soldiers who had been sent home with a " blighty wound " ; the town also received 150 Belgian refugees . The Second World War affected Tunbridge Wells in a different way — it became so swollen with refugees from London that accommodation was severely strained . Over 3 @,@ 800 buildings were damaged by bombing , but only 15 people lost their lives . 
 = = = Toponymy = = = 
 Edward Hasted made the assertion that although the wells were originally named the " Queen 's @-@ Wells " , they soon took on the name of Tunbridge Wells due to their proximity to the town of Tonbridge ( then known as " Tunbridge " ) : 
 In compliment to [ queen Henrietta Maria 's ] doctor , Lewis Rowzee , in his treatise on them , calls these springs the Queen 's @-@ wells ; but this name lasted but a small time , and they were soon afterwards universally known by that of Tunbridge @-@ wells , which names they acquired from the company usually residing at Tunbridge town , when they came into these parts for the benefit of drinking the waters — Edward Hasted , 1797 
 The prefix " Royal " dates to 1909 , when King Edward VII granted the town its official " Royal " title to celebrate its popularity over the years among members of the royal family . Royal Tunbridge Wells is one of only three towns in England to have been granted this ( the others being Royal Leamington Spa and Royal Wootton Bassett , which became a Royal town in 2011 ) . 
 Although " Wells " has a plural form , it refers to the principal source , the chalybeate spring in the Pantiles ( where the waters were taken ) . 
 = = Governance = = 
 Royal Tunbridge Wells is the administrative centre for both Tunbridge Wells Borough and the parliamentary constituency of Tunbridge Wells . The Borough is governed by 48 Councillors , representing 20 wards ( eight wards fall within the town of Tunbridge Wells itself ) . Elections are held for 16 Council seats each year on a rotational basis , with elections to Kent County Council taking place in the fourth year of the cycle . Each councillor serves a four @-@ year term . 
 Tunbridge Wells local elections show a pattern since 1973 of Conservative party dominance , apart from a two @-@ year period from 1994 to 1996 of no overall control and a two @-@ year period from 1996 to 1998 when the Liberal Democrats held a majority . The most recent elections , held in May 2008 , gave the Conservatives a large majority with 44 seats compared with the Liberal Democrats ' four . The extent of the Conservatives ' dominance is further illustrated by the fact that in some wards ( e.g. Park ) Labour did not even field a candidate in the 2008 council elections . 
 The Member of Parliament for Tunbridge Wells is the Conservative Greg Clark , who was elected in 2005 with a majority of 9 @,@ 988 and held the seat in 2010 with a majority of 15 @,@ 576 . The constituency has been Conservative since its inception in 1974 for the 1974 General Election ; the two previous MPs were Sir Patrick Mayhew ( 1974 – 1997 ) and the former Asda chairman Archie Norman ( 1997 – 2005 ) .

 Tunbridge Wells is located at 51 ° 07 ′ 55 ″ N 00 ° 15 ′ 46 ″ E on the Kentish border with East Sussex , about 31 miles ( 50 km ) south of London ; the original centre of the settlement lies directly on the Kent / East Sussex border , as recalled by the county boundary flagstone that still lies outside the church of King Charles the Martyr . 
 The town is situated at the northern edge of the High Weald , a ridge of hard sandstone that runs across southern England from Hampshire along the borders of Surrey , West Sussex , East Sussex and Kent — the town 's geology is illustrated by the exposed sandstone outcrops at the Wellington Rocks and High Rocks ( a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to its exposed gulls ) , and the quarries at nearby Langton Green from which sandstone was taken to build houses in Tunbridge Wells . The town is sited at the head of a valley that runs south @-@ east to Groombridge ; like the River Teise , which originates in Tunbridge Wells , the stream in the valley is one of the many tributaries of the River Medway , which runs through a much larger valley north of the High Weald . 
 Nearby villages have been subsumed into the built @-@ up area of the town , so that now it incorporates High Brooms to the north , <unk> to the south , and <unk> ( whose name resonates with the iron content of the rocks ) to the west .

 Tunbridge Wells is at the hub of a series of roads , the primary ones being the <unk> , which runs from Maidstone to Newhaven ; the A264 , which runs from Five Oaks to Pembury ( via Crawley and East Grinstead ) ; and the <unk> , which runs south from Tunbridge Wells to Hailsham . The A21 passes to the east of the town , following the route of its turnpike ancestor , from London to Hastings . 
 Bus services are operated chiefly by Arriva Kent & Sussex , providing local town and rural services to Tonbridge , Paddock Wood and Sevenoaks , as well as express services to locations such as Bromley and Maidstone . Eastbourne and Brighton on the south coast are accessible on services run by Stagecoach in Eastbourne and Brighton & Hove respectively , and Metrobus operates hourly services to Crawley . 
 Tunbridge Wells town historically had three railway stations : two of these are still in use by National Rail services . Tunbridge Wells station is , as its former name of Tunbridge Wells Central suggests , centrally located within the town at the end of the High Street , whilst High Brooms station is situated in High Brooms , to the north of the town . Both stations are located on the double @-@ tracked electrified Hastings Line ; services are operated by the Southeastern train operating company . 
 Tunbridge Wells West station was opened by the London , Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1866 as the terminus of its competing line to Tunbridge Wells , but closed in 1985 along with that line . The station building — a Grade II listed building — is now a restaurant , and a Sainsbury 's supermarket occupies the former goods yard . In 1996 , however , part of the line was reopened by the Tunbridge Wells and Eridge Railway Preservation Society , which now — as the Spa Valley Railway — operates a steam heritage railway that runs from Tunbridge Wells West to Eridge via High Rocks and Groombridge . The western end of the service was extended from Groombridge to Eridge , on the London @-@ Uckfield line of Southern Railway , on 25 March 2011 , serving a platform at Eridge which had been disused for many years .

At Bragging Rights , Miz pinned Morrison to become the only member of the Raw roster to win an interpromotional match . The following month at Survivor Series , Miz captained a team of five wrestlers against Team Morrison in a five @-@ on @-@ five Survivor Series elimination match and once again bested his former partner .

 = Islands of the Forth = 
 The Islands of the Forth are a group of small islands located in the Firth of Forth and in the estuary of the River Forth on the east coast of Scotland . Most of the group lie in the open waters of the firth , between the Lothians and Fife , with the majority to the east of the city of Edinburgh . Two islands lie further west in the river estuary . 
 The islands have a varied geology and history and several have both ecclesiastical connections and were involved in military occupations throughout the centuries of recorded history . Various lighthouses and other aids to navigation have been erected on the islands and skerries , one dating to the 17th century , but only one of the islands is still permanently inhabited . The area has a diversity of bird and sea life and the scientific name for the northern gannet is derived from this bird 's connection with the Bass Rock . 
 There are few islands off eastern Scotland and most of any size are in this group . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Furthest east is the Isle of May , off the coast of Fife south of Crail . To the south in the outer Firth there is a group of islands off East Lothian near North Berwick and Gullane ; from east to west they are the Bass Rock ( also known simply as " The Bass " ) , Craigleith , The Lamb , Fidra and Eyebroughy . A second group lie in the inner Firth of Forth . Inchkeith and Inchcolm are off Kinghorn and Aberdour on the north shore , Inchgarvie lies midway between North and South Queensferry , and Inchmickery and Cramond Island are nearer to Edinburgh on the south shore . Alloa Inch and <unk> Inch are furthest west in the estuarine waters of the River Forth . 
 Only one of these islands , Inchcolm , has had a resident population in recent years , although there have been monasteries , hermitages , lighthouses and fortifications on most of them in the past . In the late 19th century the Isle of May had a population of over 20 . Many of the island names have the first element , " <unk> " ( from Innis , the Gaelic word for " island " ) . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Geologically , most of the islands are the remnants of igneous intrusions . The Isle of May 's rock is " fine grained basalt of a dark @-@ grey colour with tinges of green and greenstone " . Fidra is also largely basalt and The Bass is a <unk> volcanic plug . Craigleith is a laccolith made up of <unk> which is popular for making curling stones and Cramond island is made up of dolerite . Inchmickery and Inchgarvie are of igneous origin and the latter is partly made up of <unk> . Studies of the landscape beneath the waters of the firth have revealed that the visible surface of Inchgarvie is only the top of a larger crag and tail structure similar in structure to Edinburgh Castle and the Royal Mile created by glacial action . The tidal islet of Eyebroughy is about 1 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) to the west of Fidra . Its component rock is trachyte and Lower Carboniferous in origin . 
 Most of Inchkeith is of volcanic origin but there are also sections of sandstone , coal , limestone and shale , the last named containing numerous fossils . There are also several springs on the island . Inchcolm is similarly varied , consisting of greenstone , sandstone , shale and limestone . 
 = = Natural history = = 
 The Firth is an important area for nature conservation and has a range of habitats including extensive mudflats , shingle shorelines and saltmarsh . The last named , which is well developed on Alloa Inch , is typically dominated by saltmarsh rush , sea club @-@ rush , sea aster and common saltmarsh @-@ grass . The inner Firth is important for nationally and internationally important numbers of wintering wildfowl and wading birds and hosts populations of shelduck , knot , redshank , great crested grebe , teal and goldeneye . The outer islands support significant numbers of nesting seabirds . The Bass Rock has more than 150 @,@ 000 nesting northern gannets and is the largest single rock gannetry in the world . When viewed from the mainland much of the rock looks white due to the sheer number of birds ( and their droppings , which give off 152 tonnes of ammonia per year ) . The scientific names for this gannet , Sula <unk> and Morus bassanus , are derived from the rock . The bird was traditionally known locally as the <unk> goose , and its eggs and meat were considered delicacies . It is estimated that in 1850 almost 2000 birds were harvested from the rock . Other bird species on the rock include guillemot , razorbill , cormorant , puffin , eider duck and numerous gulls . 
 Craigleith lies close to North Berwick 's harbour and historically was used as a rabbit warren . The rabbits were bred for food but they were wiped out by myxomatosis in the 1950s . The Atlantic puffin colony on Craigleith , once one of the largest in Britain with 28 @,@ 000 pairs , became endangered from 1999 onwards , due to an invasion of the non @-@ endemic plant tree mallow , which choked the puffins ' burrows , preventing them from rearing their chicks , or " <unk> " . A five @-@ year project , SOS Puffin , led by the Scottish Seabird Centre at North Berwick , was launched early in 2007 . Since then , hundreds of volunteers have been working hard to rid the island of the problem , ferried out by boat from the Seabird Centre during the winter months , when the puffins are at sea . There are signs that the puffins are starting to return to the island to breed . Fidra , Inchmickery and Eyebroughy are RSPB reserves , the last being noted for its cormorants . Over 240 species of bird and 60 varieties of seaweed have been recorded on the Isle of May . 
 = = History = = 
 Several of the islands contain pre @-@ historic remains created by cultures whose names are unknown . They have also been affected by the successive influences of Celtic , Norse and English @-@ speaking peoples during the historic period and this is reflected in their names . The islands also came under attack from Vikings during the early Historic period . 
 = = = 15th century = = = 
 During the reign of King James IV Inchkeith was the site of an extraordinary experiment . According to the historian Robert Lyndsay of Pitscottie , in 1493 James directed that a dumb woman and two infants be transported to the island , to ascertain which language the infants would grow up to speak when isolated from the rest of the world . It was thought that this would be the " original " language , or language of God . There is no reliable account of how the infants spoke although Lyndsay of Pitscottie reported that " some say they spoke good Hebrew " . 
 In 1497 Inchkeith and Inchgarvie were used as an isolated refuge for victims of syphilis and in 1589 , history repeated itself when <unk> was used to quarantine the passengers of a plague @-@ ridden ship . ( More plague sufferers came from the mainland in 1609 and in 1799 , Russian sailors who died of an infectious disease were buried there . ) 
 Inchcolm is mentioned in Shakespeare 's Macbeth where it is described as " Saint Colmes <unk> " .

 Inchcolm was raided by English troops during the 14th century Wars of Independence . In the 16th century Inchkeith , Inchcolm and Inchgarvie all suffered English occupation . The Earl of Somerset garrisoned the islands in 1547 after the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh . His force of marines were ordered to reinforce Inchkeith , and they built a large square fort , with corner towers , on the site of the present day lighthouse . His forces , mainly Italian mercenaries , were ejected by a combined Franco @-@ Scottish force under General D ’ <unk> in 1549 .

 Several islands including Inchkeith and Inchgarvie were fortified in subsequent years both from fear of Napoleonic invasion , and during the two World Wars . Inchmickery was used as a gun emplacement during both World Wars and the derelict concrete structures were designed to make the island look like a battleship from a distance . These buildings were later used for filming scenes of the film Complicity . 
 = = = Ecclesiastical associations = = = 
 Many of the islands were said to have Culdee connections , and had chapels on them . Various saints also have connections with the islands . St <unk> or <unk> was reputedly the mother of St Kentigern and is said to have been cast adrift in an <unk> coracle in deep waters beyond the Isle of May by her father King <unk> , which resulted in an abundance of fish in the seas nearby . St Adrian of May was murdered there by invading Danes in 870 ( who killed St <unk> in the same raid ) . He was buried in a stone coffin on the island but is said to have floated across the Firth before coming to rest in a churchyard at Anstruther . The Isle of May has a long history of ecclesiastical activity and there are various remains including that of a 13th @-@ century Benedictine church . 
 The Irish missionary Saint Baldred of <unk> resided on The Bass in the 8th century and there is a ruined 12th century chapel on Fidra dedicated to St Nicholas . Inchcolm has connections to St Columba and King Alexander I was marooned on the island , and decided to make it the site of an Augustinian monastery . In the 7th century St Adomnán of Iona founded a " school of the prophets " on Inchkeith in the late 7th century having met St Serf there . Inchmickery 's name may be derived from the Gaelic for " island of the vicar " .

 Many of the isles act as an aid to navigation . There are various lighthouses and numerous devices to guide shipping in the busy waters near the ports of Leith and Rosyth . 
 In 1803 , construction was begun of Inchkeith Lighthouse , designed and built by Thomas Smith and Robert Stevenson . The lighthouse stands 67 metres high and was operational by 1804 . The Fidra light was built in 1885 and automated in 1970 . The light on the small rock of <unk> was automated as early as 1894 . At that time it was controlled by a clockwork timer and was powered using gas delivered weekly from Granton gasworks . A lighthouse was constructed on the Bass Rock in 1902 . 
 The Isle of May light has a long history having been in operation since 1635 when a crude coal @-@ fired structure was erected . The existing building was constructed in 1816 , which was converted to a " rock station " in 1972 and automated in March 1989 . The island is owned by the Commissioners of the Northern Lights although managed by Scottish Natural Heritage as a National Nature Reserve . 
 None of the islands are accessible by public transport except Inchcolm , which has a regular summer service .

 The Isle of May is in the north of the outer Firth of Forth , about 8 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) off the coast of mainland Fife . It is 1 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 1 mi ) long , less than 0 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 31 mi ) wide and has a total area of 45 hectares ( 110 acres ) making it by far the largest of the Forth islands . Although often inhabited in the past nobody has been recorded as living there since the automation of the lighthouse . Rona is a tidal islet to the north joined to the main island by a bridge . Further north are North Ness , the Mars Rocks and Norman Rock . <unk> and the Middens are stacks to the east and The Pillow is a skerry to the south east . Maiden Rocks and Maiden Hair lie just offshore to the south . 
 The Bass Rock is about 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) offshore , and 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) north @-@ east of North Berwick . This steep @-@ sided island is currently uninhabited , but was lived on for many centuries . It has a castle dating from the 14th century , which was later used as a prison and there are the remains of a chapel built circa 1491 . The Lauder family owned the island for almost six centuries , and it now belongs to Sir Hew Dalrymple whose family purchased it in 1701 . The rock features in various works of fiction , including Robert Louis Stevenson 's Catriona . At 7 @.@ 5 hectares ( 19 acres ) in extent the Bass Rock is the second largest of the islands of the Forth . The Middens is a small stack that lies just offshore to the northwest . 
 Craigleith lies north of North Berwick harbour . It was also purchased by Sir Hew Dalrymple , from North Berwick Town Council in 1814 . 
 The Lamb is an uninhabited island about 100m long by 50m wide , flanked by the skerries North Dog and South Dog . There are other skerries between it and the shore including Bubbly Buss , the Law Rocks and the Hummel Ridges . In February 2009 , the island was bought by the Israeli <unk> Uri Geller for £ 30 @,@ 000 . 
 Fidra , archaically <unk> , is 4 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) north @-@ west of North Berwick . Like the nearby islands it is the result of volcanic activity and has a substantial seabird population . It can be accessed via a primitive jetty on the eastern shore . It is said that R. L. Stevenson based his map of Treasure Island on the shape of Fidra . The island is also attended by companion islets called North Dog and South Dog and Castle Tarbet is another islet to the south separated from the main bulk at high tides . 
 = = = Inner islands = = = 
 Inchkeith is close to the shores of Fife . Its history has been dominated by religion , its use as a quarantine and military events ( see above ) . It is currently owned by Tom Farmer , founder of <unk> , although he doesn 't live there . 
 Inchmickery lies about 8 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) east of Inchkeith and it is about 3 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 2 mi ) north of the city of Edinburgh . It is only about 100 metres by 200 metres in size . Rocks known as the Cow and Calf lie to the north and beyond that , about half way to Inchcolm , are the <unk> , a hazard identified by a permanent light . 
 <unk> is the only island in the Firth with a recent resident population , of whom there were two in the 2001 census although there was no usually resident population recorded at the time of the 2011 census . There is a resident custodian employed by Historic Scotland who maintains the island and runs the shop during the summer . In the 14th century John of Fordun records the name as " <unk> " ( referring to the <unk> Sancti <unk> in insula <unk> ) . There are various skerries in the sea to the north including Swallow Craig , Car Craig , <unk> and <unk> . 
 Inchgarvie 's name is from Innis <unk> which is Scottish Gaelic for " rough island " or possibly " <unk> 's island " . This island has a long history of fortification and is now incorporated into the Forth Bridge . In 1878 , foundations for Thomas Bouch 's Forth Bridge were laid on Inchgarvie but after the Tay Bridge Disaster these plans were abandoned . When construction of the bridge recommenced in 1882 , the west end of the island was extended with a pier and used as the foundation for one of the cantilevers . The island was also used for a construction office and the castle buildings were re @-@ roofed to accommodate workers . Some of the stone from the former castle was used to build the caissons of the bridge . 
 Cramond Island in the Almond estuary is a tidal island that is 7 @.@ 7 hectares ( 19 acres ) in extent and is currently part of the Dalmeny Estate . It lies about a mile from the shore and is a popular recreation area . The speed with which the water rises can catch visitors unawares , leaving them stranded . 
 Alloa Inch is an island in the tidal reaches of the River Forth near Alloa that consists of reed beds and salt marshes . There is a derelict farmhouse on the island and the Scottish Wildlife Trust has managed the island as a nature reserve since 1996 . Just upstream is the smaller <unk> Inch - both are part of the Firth of Forth SSSI , which also includes the John Muir Country Park . 
 = = = Small outliers and former islands = = = 
 There are various other small islets and skerries in the Firth . Along the north shore , from west to east , Preston Island near Culross is an artificial former island . This reclaimed land was created c . 1800 for salt production . More land was then reclaimed using ash slurry from <unk> power station from 1970 onwards and it is now part of the mainland . Just offshore are the <unk> Rocks at grid reference <unk> , which were called " Kraig Maur " in Blaeu 's Atlas . " Dow Kraig " on the same 17th century map appears to be under reclaimed land just along the coast south of <unk> House at grid reference <unk> Nearby Rosyth Castle is a former tidal island and Long Craig is now part of the Forth Road Bridge . 
 There is another Long Craig south of Dalgety Bay and Haystack lies between it and Inchcolm . The Common Rocks are in <unk> Bay at Aberdour and West Vows , East Vows and another Long Craig lie off Kirkcaldy . Much farther along the coast there is another West Vows and East Vows at <unk> . The Carr Brigs are a hazard to shipping at the entrance to the Firth just off Fife Ness . 
 There are fewer skerries on the south coast of the Firth . Little Ox lies off Musselburgh and the Black Rocks , including the Middle and Eastern <unk> lie just outside the Port of Leith .
